The fields had only just begun to grow bricks and mortar, but not in sufficient quantity to blot out the ancient look of the place entirely. The majority of houses were old-fashioned \u2014 even Ba-. chelors' Buildings had an old look about them. The fact is that John Phillibert, their owner, had turned his an cestral home into chambers. The house was an old red brick house, with a courtyard in the middle, and a large garden behind. He had turned the courtyard into a neat little square, had opened doors in the wings, and divided the [ house into half-a-dozen sets of { course, a lady might be expected to pop the question touch ing such a quaint nomenclature. Well, madam, it was so called because old Phillibert let his chambers to bachelors only, who were bound by the terms of their agreement to leave the place on their marriage ! He had no difficulty in finding tenants on these conditions. The buildings filled, and the chambers were taken on long leases. The mere fact of going into residence in such a place was a pleasant sort of protest to poor fellows who had reasons to be angry with women and marriage. In this quiet spot \u2014 for, I must admit, Bachelors' Buildings was very quiet indeed \u2014 they could brood over their sorrows and say severe things about the sex. Each felt like a Saint Senanus when he took up his quarters there, and felt sure that old Phillibert would sink, burn, and destroy any wandering bptks that made sail for that sacred isle. Number One, Bachelors' Buildings, was in the occupation of William Gillray. He was by profession an artist, and highly esteemed of connoisseurs for his landscapes of Devon. In that fair county he had spent some very pleasant summer holidays \u2014 very pleasant when he stayed at his uncle's especially, in quaint Exeter. For Uncle Tobias had a daughter, Lucinda, who was wont to ramble with her artist-cousin among the fair lanes, and to stand beside him in the grand old cathedral, until her image became so dear to him that he saw her instead of nature in the loveli ness of the country \u2014 so that the devotion which the old cathe dral stirred within him was the worship of her. But there came to Exeter the son of one of the canons, a comfortable chambers, all of -jR-zi ~z^_ .. -~^- which, at the time this chronicle commences, were let to what Mr. Phillibert's legal adviser described as \"most desirable tenants.\" \" But why Bachelors' Buildings?\" asks a fair reader. Of"], [16, "6 THE \"FIFE ALLS.\" The old man loved nothing better than to smoke a pipe in the chimney-corner and listen while Calthrop discharged his batteries of sarcasm and cynicism against the sex. The tenant at Number Five was a harmless old gentleman, Timothy Jallett by name, and clerk in a house of business in the City by occupation. Timothy\u2014 or Tim, as they called him in the office\u2014 had been but a poor galley-slave all his life. He found himself chained to a desk, mast-headed on a high stool, at an age when other lads are enjoying rounders and cricket. He had accepted his position cheerfully. He was not a strong lad constitutionally, and his sedentary occu pation did not improve his health. His chief solace was reading, and his employer, whose father had been a pub lisher, lent him books\u2014 amongst others the Waverley novels, which filled our poor friend's brain with all sorts of wild dreams and gallant and romantic aspirations. But his aspirations took a practical form after all, for he worked away all the harder in order to get that increase of salary without which he felt he could not be a paladin and a hero. He would win a competence, and then he could look around him for a field for gallant enterprise, and some fair girl whose commendation should be his sweetest reward. dashing young fellow, the pride of his college, and the captain of the University Eleven at Oxford. What woman could resist so gallant and fascinating a fellow? There was a public ball during his stay, and he paid marked attention to Lucinda, whose head was turned by his preference. With a sad spirit and a sore heart William Gillray packed up his portfolio when he returned to his uncle's after the ball. In the grey of early dawn he slipped out of the house and hastened back to London, full of bitterness against the fickle ness of women. He still painted views of Devon, but he re visited it no more. His sketch-book supplied subjects : \u2014 \" We are glad to see,\" said the critics, \" that Mr. Gillray still makes the garden of England his sketching ground.\" But the real judges began to shake their heads after a time, and talk about \"pot-boilers,\" and a man's \"repeating himself, without going to nature.\" But the falling off in his work was perhaps not more on account of his refraining from seeking nature, than from the bitter, disappointed spirit that drove him to enter the solitary world of \" Bachelors' Buildings.\" Number Two was tenanted by Charles Lawes. He was a clerk in one of the humblest of Government offices \u2014 the Custom House \u2014 with less pay and more work than fall to the lot of his luckier brethren in Pall Mall and Whitehall. He was the son of an old officer, and a poor man \u2014 that worst kind of poor man, a poor gentleman. The friends and the society he had inherited from his father were richer and grander than they should have been for one with limited means. Captain Lawes had been a brave soldier, and had been courted by noble folk, who on his death did their best for his son. As, however, the father had only shed his blood for his country on the battle-field, instead of giving his vote for his party in the House, there was nothing better to be got for the lad than a post in the Customs. Brought up in the pride of birth, and as yet ignorant of the fulness of the meaning ot poverty, Charles had not felt that he was offering an insult, but rather an honour to the family of Mary Marville, the banker's daughter, when he asked to be allowed to become her suitor. Mr. Marville was one of that large and rather boastful class of men who began life with hali-a-crown, and soon made it half-a-million. He was no believer in blood \u2014 he thought gold, if it could be injected, would make the best currency for the human system, and he insulted poor Charles grossly when he sought an interview in the gloomy bank-parlour in Lombard Street. *9> Charlie had, perhaps, hardly waited for parental permis sion to become Mary's suitor. He and she had become attached to one another long before he dreamt of anything so practical as going to her father. I think it was Mary's sug gestion that he should do so, and that did not make him the less angry when, on his relating his interview with her father, she took a sensible view of the question, and finding Charles was too poor to make her his, said, with a sigh, that she must obey her parent. So Charles took up his quarters in Bachelors' Buildings. Number Three was the domicile of Martin James. Poor Martin suffered from the direst of all those afflictions of our nature that are not positive diseases. He was so shy and nervous that it was absolutely painful not only to himself, but to every one who knew him. But beneath this diffidence \u2014 possibly its very cause \u2014 were an intense earnestness and depth, which, could they only have displayed themselves, would have made him generally beloved. Grace Chantrey, to whose father, a Russian merchant, he acted as secretary, had discovered enough of his good qualities to make her very kind to poor Martin. But in consequence, although Martin fell every day more in love with her, he also became every day more fearful to breathe a word about his feelings. At last in despair he fled to Bachelors' Buildings, less from hatred of the fair sex than from a sense of shame at his own unworthiness. Alas, poor Tim ! while the rise of salary lingered, time sped on, and by the time his income was enough to support the humblest home and the most domesticated wife, his head had got a Httle bald atop, and the youthful freshness had died out of his cheek. But he had not noticed the change, so he sought out a fair one, laid his suit at her feet, and was repulsed with laughter. The shock opened his eyes. He felt he was an old and poverty-stricken man. In sorrow, not in anger, he retired to Bachelors' Buildings to conceal his bruised heart from the gaze of the world. He was still constant to his business, still devoted to reading ; but he no longer strove for a rise of salary \u2014 he no longer glowed at the charm of a romance. He was a weary, broken-spirited, prematurely old man. There remains but one more tenant to describe, Tom Ashby, who set up his tent at Number Six. Tom Ashby was a man of about thirty-six. He was of good family and had received a good education. He had originally been intended for a surgeon, but there was a strong spice of Bohemianism in him, and he had turned actor, to the intense disgust of his friends. Tom entered his new profession with a thorough love for it, and the opposition of his relatives only spurred him on to exert himself the more. He soon made a very fair reputa tion, and could command a capital salary. He played in the provinces, but he was so well known that it was merely a question of months \u2014 possibly weeks \u2014 how soon he would be wanted to join a London company. Meanwhile, Tom lost his heart to Miss Emily Fitz-Travers. Her real name was Jane Thomson, and a good little girl she was \u2014 only a dancer, whose highest elevation was the per formance of Columbine in the Christmas pantomime each year. There was no affectation about the love of these two young people. There is not much artificiality in such matters behind the scenes. They were engaged, and they went about to gether, and nobody thought any harm in it, or hinted at the necessity of a duenna \u2014 as, indeed, there was no necessity. Late in one year, when Tom and Emily were performing with the company at Bristol, he saw in a paper an advertise ment, entreating him to go to his dying father. Tom obeyed the summons, and was just in time to hear the old man's last words of grief and reconciliation. He was detained some time by the funeral and the business of administering his father's affairs. He found the will left everything to him, and, despite his natural sorrow at the loss of a parent, it was with an inward feeling of relief and comfort that he reflected, as he journeyed back to Bristol, that now he should be well off, and might marry Jane. She might retire from the stage, for which she had no love, while he could act or not, as he chose, and would only accept first-rate engagements. The pantomime had been running about a week when he reached Bristol and made his way into the theatre. As he was hurrying on from the stage-door to the green-room, there was a great deal of shrieking and shouting, which he supposed was the comic business. Imagine his horror, when he found in the green-room a group of scene-shifters and terrified actors gathered around a charred and blackened figure, which his heart told him was that of Jane ! Her dress had caught light from the fall of some coloured fire. She lingered m terrible agony for some hours, but Number Four was inhabited by Henry Calthrop, a young barrister. He had been educated at Oxford, where he had spent nearly all his money. He had lived a fast life there, and had imbibed a reckless and miserable philosophy. He did not believe in the honesty of man or the virtue of woman. In short, he was a sham \u2014 that very bad sham, a sham misogynist. He had been living in chambers in the Temple, but the life he led there with some congenial spirits had played such havoc with his health that his doctor had ordered him to live a short way out of town. He had heard of Bachelors' Build ings by chance, came down to see them, and was delighted with them. He and old Phillibert were especial cronies before long."], [17, "INTRODUCTORY 7 died before the morning, leaning on his shoulder and press ing her poor scarred lips to his. Then there was nothing else left in the world to care for. Tom gave away his theatrical properties among his brother actors, and bade farewell to the stage. He buried poor Jane, placed a stone, with a simple inscription, over her resting place, and then left Bristol, never to return. He could not bear to visit the grave. He could think of her sweet, pure spirit m the skies, but he could not bear the thought of the poor charred body mouldering away in the common earth. It so chanced that the lawyer who had arranged his father's affairs, was old Phillibert's lawyer too ; so finding Tom was looking out for some very quiet and retired home, he recom mended Bachelors' Buildings ; and Tom, without troubling to inquire much into the matter, found himself before long located in that haven of calm. In this way were Bachelors' Buildings occupied at the time when my story opens. Old Phillibert knew the histories of most of his tenants \u2014 men who have been disappointed in love are given to talking over their miseries, as old soldiers delight in telling how they lost a limb. Tom Ashby was the only one of the group who was silent about his past. It was too sacred a thing to speak of. But I see the gentle reader, who inquired the reason why the buildings bore that name, is anxious to put another question. I know what it is. She would like to know what made the old Phillibert establish his set of chambers on such an anti-matrimonial plan. My dear madam, the proprietor of a such a fine pro perty must have a chapter to himself. In that I will explain all. CHAPTER n. -OLD phillibert. Old Phillibert had, of course, been young Phillibert, once on a time, though you would hardly have thought so, to look at him. There was nothing of youth, childhood, or infancy left in him. I have seen some bald-headed old gentlemen with the same twinkle in their eyes that they must have had as babies. I know an old friend who has the same frank smile on his mouth as he had when we were boys at school. But there were no lingering traces of juvenility about old Phillibert. He was hke a mummy, brown, wrinkled, and seemingly ever lasting. As young Phillibert, he had early imbibed a hatred of the sex. His father, who was a poor man, used to relate how he ought to have married Miss Chump, the rich butcher's daughter, only she had served him so badly. In truth, she had done nothing worse than say \"no\" when he asked her to marry him; and \"yes\" when young Clancy, the gun smith, put a similar question on his own behalf. But the elder Phillibert never forgave her. He married a little meek woman, and bullied her fearfully, as a revenge on the sex. Our Phillibert had very little recollection of his mother. He had a faint memory of some one who used to give him physic, and get beaten \u2014 as he with infantine logic argued for giving it him \u2014 by his father. As he grew up and needed a start in life, and his father's want of money hampered him, he leamt the Phillibert version of the inconstancy of Miss Chump. When, later, he himself fell in love, not with a wealthy, but a poor girl, and she ran away on the eve of their marriage with a lawyer's clerk as poor as herself, the cup of Phillibert's hatred of the sex was filled to overflowing. His father had been dead some years, when our Phillibert, as next of kin to his uncle, who died intestate, inherited the little estate of which Bachelors' Buildings \u2014 then known as Phillibert Court \u2014 formed the chief part. Retaining the court for his own residence, he let the rest of the estate on very ad vantageous terms as building ground. He then looked about for a wife, as any one would look about for a dining table or a chest of drawers. Warned by the history of Miss Chump, he chose a girl without money \u2014 partly, also, per haps, because he thought a woman who brought him riches might be disinclined to take the menial position which in his idea a wife should occupy. He selected Polly Walmsley, the daughter of a needy doctor. Her father and mother were delighted at the notion of securing such a son-in-law. So though Polly refused him twice, Mrs. W. managed to prevail on him to ask her a third time, and Polly, having been parent ally tortured for several weeks, consented to become Mrs. Phillibert. But at the last moment her heart failed her \u2014 or rather, I should say, proved true to her, and she got the maid-servant to prevail on her lover, the baker's man, to take a note to Jack Gillett, at the offices of Messrs. Pobgee, Filt, and Mamberly, solicitors, of Bedford Row. The same night, Jack Gillett was at the door of the paternal mansion. Mamma was asleep, papa was ushering another little mortal into this world of trouble, and Mary, the maid, was friendly. So Jack and Polly ran away and got married, and had no reason to repent it. Old Phillibert was very savage. He was incapable of un derstanding that, after all, love was a slightly necessary household chattel to begin manied life withal. He felt that the fact of Polly's being poor and his being rich, ought to have settled the matter: \u2014 her running away with a poor man, was a piece of sheer dishonesty, quite inexcusable. Polly's mother and father were terribly disappointed at losing such a son-in-law as Phillibert. They had reckoned on getting a good deal out of him when he was one of the family. But there were no real grounds for disappointment, if they had only known all ; \u2014 Phillibert was not the man to marry tbe whole family. He knew they were poor, but he had made up his mind, as soon as Polly was his, to cut her parents adrift with a clear hint that they would not get a penny from him. What was he to do with Phillibert Court? At first he thought of selling it. But happening to look up at the house as he stood meditatively before it, he caught sight of an old carving over the entrance gate. It was a bas-relief of Eve giving Adam the apple, surrounded by a garland of nut boughs, the Phillibert badge in old days, when the Philli berts were a great family. The sight of the old stone suggested the opening of a tavern for single men only. But there wrere difficulties in the way of that which presented themselves on reflection, so old Phillibert determined to make a sort of inn of the old house \u2014like one of the inns of court. Before long he had the plan sketched out plainly, called in the bricklayers and carpenters, and speedily metamor phosed the old house into a very picturesque place, with a pretty square in the courtyard, and a sort of miniature park behind. The sets of chambers were most commodious and complete, the rent was low, the situation agreeable, and there was no lack of applicants to Timberland, old Philli bert's lawyer, who advertised the chambers. But when thev heard the conditions on which alone they could become tenants, a great many found they were disqualified, and some were afraid to tie themselves with such provisos. Nevertheless, as I have said, Bachelors' Buildings were full, and all the tenants had taken them on long leases. It was cheap, comfortable, and convenient, and Oh ; it was so quiet ! \u25a0' buildings besieged. CHAPTER III. \u2014 BACHELORS' \"Lie down \u2014 down ! Ugh, you fidgety brute !\" Old Phillibert was leaning on the gate, looking at the garden in front of Bachelors' Buildings, and his words were addressed to a wretched-looking cur that had jumped about his legs, as a hint that they had been resting too long. The wretched-looking cur was Phillibert's property \u2014 a stray that he had turned to account as a watch-dog. It was christened Rags by its most intimate friends. When Phil libert gave it a name, it was not even so complimentary as Rags. Rags understood his master's temper too well to disobey, so he squatted down in the wet road \u2014 not absolutely seating himself\u2014 and looked up at Phillibert with a shiver, saying as plainly as possible, \" It's so confoundedly damp, that I can't really sit down, but I'll look like it to oblige you.\" Phillibert was not feeling amiable. When he came up to the Buildings that moming, he had found old Jallett con versing affably with Mrs. Mumby, the buxom widow who was hostess of the \"Five Alls,\" a quiet little inn not two minutes' walk from the Buildings. Old P. had a dread of widows, and he at once concluded that Mrs. Mumby was scheming against the peace of his house. The only woman he ever had permitted to pass the gate was the laundress, Mrs. Jellifer, a feeble old girl of about sixty, who cleaned the doorsteps, made the beds, and looked after the washing. \"Confound that old Jallett i\" said Phillibert, \"hell be B 2"], [18, "THE \"FIFE ALLS.\" 8 \"My uncle dead ! And I have not seen him for so many years !\" And William Gillray sank down stunned into a chair. The two women busied themselves about him tenderly, and he recovered himself at last. The presence of Lucinda in his room was like a dream ; and it shed such a pure sun light over everything, that he felt lonely indeed when she and her mother went away, as they did presently, after he had promised to visit them at the hotel where they were staying. As Gillray was returning from escorting them to their cab, he met Charles Lawes hurrying out of the Buildings, looking very white and agitated. \"Good heavens, Lawes ! what's the matter? Are you ill?' \" No ; I have only received a sudden shock. An old friend of mine' from whom I have been estranged some years, has committed suicide :\u2014 Mr. Marville, the banker, who has just failed for a very large sum. I fear he leaves his family un provided for.\" At this moment Martin James came up. \"Are you going into the City, James?\" asked Lawes. \"Yes ; I fear I'm late\" \"Come along, we'll take a cab ; I want to get there as quickly as possible ; so we'll go together.\" So Lawes and James had a Hansom to the City, where the latter arrived in good time, after all. He need have been in no hurry, for it was a slack day at Mr. Chantrey's office. Mr. Chantrey had gone off to dine at Blackwall, with a few friends, to celebrate the success of a speculation they had been concerned in together. All that Martin had to do was to sit in Mr. Chantrey's room, and see any one who called on business. making a fool of himself\u2014 I know it ! There's no resisting those widows, if they set themselves deliberately to catch an old fool like him. I must go and see Calthrop. \" He strode across the little quadrangle and entered the barrister's room. Calthrop was seated at his table, which was strewn with bits of silk, swansdown, and slips of rice paper, with a large gum-bottle by his side, and a glue-pot on the fire. He blushed and looked very confused when Philli bert entered, for he was actually engaged in mending a fan ! \"Belongs to my sister \u2014 it does, indeed!\" said Calthrop, confusedly, as he saw Phillibert's keen eye fix itself on the toy. \" Humph !\" said the landlord. \" Fellows should not bring traps like that into Bachelors' Buildings. I shall have to come and live in the lodge, and search you all. I shall, indeed. Hang it, Calthrop, it's almost a breach of the covenant in the lease !\" \"No, it isn't. Don't talk law to me ! I don't take all your opinions as sound, Mr. P.,\" said Calthrop, glad enough to turn the conversation. \"Well, what do you think of old Jallett talking soft non sense to old Mrs. Mumby, within shadow of these buildings, Calthrop? Isn't that an infringement of the agreement ?\" \"She was probably dunning him for his score. I think the old gentleman frequents the parlour of the ' Five Alls' rather too frequently of late for either his health or his purse.\" \" Nonsense ! \u2014 he's in love with the widow, if that's the case. I must see to this ! I'll go and stop at the place myself and watch.\" \"Mind you don't fall in love yourself, Phillibert.\" (The old man made a gesture of disgust.) \"*Dh, there are more un likely things ! But what's the latest news ? You've been to the City to-day?\" ' ' Bad news. Two more banks gone ; and it is said another will go this afternoon !\" \"The deuce 1 Which are they?\" ' ' The Himalaya, Marville's, and Cutts and Ogleby's. The two first smashed hopelessly, the last tottering.\" \"Well, I've no money in 'em, thank goodness? Mine's the United East Anglian Bank, and I believe it's as sound as the Bank of England.\" \"Oh, that's safe enough ! But keep an eye on Jallett, If you see him at it, chaff him to death. Meanwhile, I'll go round and order a bed.\" Phillibert went out, and bent his steps towards the gate. Rags, who had waited outside the door, was lost in the study of a difficult problem. He was wondering whether, if he lived next door but two to a cat's-meat shop, he could ever grow as indifferent to its attractions as the dog he saw in Doctors' Commons, who passed his existence under those circumstances. Rags was so deep in the problem, that he did not notice his master until his master kicked him and told him to ' ' come on, \" at which adjuration he dismissed the con sideration of the cat's-meat question until more fitting time, and followed Phillibert to the \"Five Alls.\" Nobody did call ; so Martin had an easy time of it. At one o'clock he sent the office-boy out to the \" Stilton Cheese\" to order in his lunch \u2014 a couple of chops and a pint of stout, with a nice mealy potato, and some green peas. Martin was just about to commence this elegant repast, when the door opened, and who should walk in but his master's daughter. Poor Martin blushed up to the roots of his hair, and then turned the colour of foolscap outsides. His hand shook so that he very nearly emptied a spoonful of peas, that he was taking, into the stout. \" La ! Mr. James, who would have thought of finding you here? I was coming to lunch with papa. I've been shopping in the City.\" \"Ah \u2014 ah \u2014 allow \u2014 permit me \u2014 I'll have this removed into \u2014 below \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 can I send for any refreshment for you? Sponge cakes \u2014 ah \u2014 jelly ! There's a nice confectioner's up the \u2014 round the comer.\" ' ' Now, if you disturb yourself a single bit, Mr. James, I vow I'll go away, starving as I am. Do, please, sit down !\" Grace Chantrey had lost her mother when she was very young ; but her father had brought her up excellently. She had, perhaps, less reserve than she would have had if she had been brought up under feminine rule. But she was none the worse for that. Her great, frank, brown eyes, and her open smile, were a treat to behold : they could even inspire Martin with something that was not far from confidence. \" What beautiful chops !\" said Grace, admiringly. \" May I \u2014 will you \u2014 permit me to place them at your dis posal !\" \"No ; 1 couldn't think of such a thing.\" \"I assure you, I couldn't \u2014 wasn't going to eat them. I'm not hungry !\" ' ' Then you ought to be, you know, Mr. James. Suppose we settle it in this way \u2014 I'll eat one chop if you'll eat the other !\" Phillibert had barely turned the comer when a cab drew up at the gate of the Buildings, and a lady alighted. Tom Ashby was just coming out as the cab arrived, so the lady asked him to tell her where she could find Mr. Gillray. \"He is my cousin,\" she added, seeing how astonished Tom looked. \" My mother and I wish to see him !\" and then Tom saw a little old lady in deep black in one corner of the cab. He pointed out Gillray's chambers, and then, taking off his hat, moved off. \"Whew !\" said he to himself, as soon as he was out of hearing, \"that must be the pretty cousin who drove him to the Buildings. Will she be able to entice him out of old Phillibert's web ? That's the question ! The sly old fox has stuck on such penalties and conditions, that it is no joke to get out of his hands !\" In the meantime Gillray, who was painting up a little view on the Exe, was startled by a gentle tap at the door. \" Come in,\" he cried ; and was astonished to see his aunt enter, leaning upon Lucinda's arm. \" It's against the rules of this place, William, I know from Mr. Timberland,\" said the old lady, \" for us to come in here, but we came to London on purpose to find you ; so we have ventured to risk your landlord's anger.\" \"Oh, William!\" said Lucinda, \"you went away so strangely, and have never written nor come near us since, and now my father is dead ; and his last request was that we would find you out, for he has appointed you his executor and trustee.\" In about two minutes Martin, to his suiprise, found himself sitting tete-a-tete with Grace, with the tray between them, eating lunch with the greatest relish. How charmingly she did the honours of the tiny banquet ! And she would drink stout, and wouldn't dream of his sending for sherry ; and then she produced a pot of marmalade, so they had sweets after the chops ; and, oh ! didn't she spread it daintily, and wasn't it twenty times nicer for her spreading ! Artful\u2014 artful Grace ! Why, her father had told her that very morning that he was going to dine at Blackwall, and she had made up her mind to drop in upon Martin at lunch time, and carry him by storm. \" Isn't this nice?\" she said, as she sat, after lunch, pretend ing to tat\u2014 she had brought her work to spare Martin's blushes, for he flushed up fearfully whenever their eyes met \u2014\"isn't this nice? I think I must ask papa to take me for a clerk. Do you think I should do?\""], [19, "INTRODUCTORY. 9 Martin stammered out as complimentary an affirmative as he could manage. \" I wonder if mamma ever came and sat here with papa?\" Martin supposed she did not. Ladies seldom came into the City with their husbands. Grace wondered why they didn't \u2014 it would be so very plea sant. If Martin ever married, wouldn't he like his wife to come to the office with him ? Martin astonished himself by replying, ' ' Yes, he had met one.\" \"Then why don't you ask her?' He was afraid. She might refuse him. \" Oh, no ; she would not, I am sure !\" \" Did Miss Chantrey think so ?' asked Martin. And Miss Chantrey did think so. In short, that artful damsel quietly led him into a hurried confession of love, and then \u2014 well, and then they found they loved one another very much, and that it was six o'clock, and Grace must go home. I will leave you to imagine Martin's state of mind when he returned that evening to Bachelors' Buildings. His delight at having won Grace's love was far from enhanced by his re collection of the terms of his lease, and his terror at the thought of telling old Phillibert he was going to be married. We left old Phillibert en route for the \"Five Alls ;\" we will take the liberty of giving him the go-by, and arriving at that hostelry before him. Martin thought he should ; but he should never marry ; and if he did, perhaps she wouldn't care to come. Grace said, \"Oh, yes, she would if she loved him ;\" and then asked why he thought he should never marry. Martin got perplexed. Grace was obliged to help him out, which she did by asking him if he had ever tried to get mar ried. Martin grew worse confounded than ever, but managed to make himself understood to the effect that he had not. \"Then why don't you? Have you never seen any one you cared for enough ?\" \" FIVE ALLS.\" CHAPTER IV. \u2014 ' \u25a0THE The \"Five Alls\" was a quiet little inn, quite of the old fashioned sort, with gable ends, and galleries round a httle court in the centre, with a great spreading elm, with seats round it in front, and a horse-trough, and a tall sign-post with an enormous sign-board, that creaked hke a ship in a storm. quietly ignoring the allusion. \" Poor M. laid in the stock a year before he died, last Christmas three year. \" \"Did he, mum? Then I'll take a httle whiskey, mum! And what's more, I shall want a bed here for a week or so, for I've business that'll keep me here some time, and the Buildings are full \u2014 yes, mum, full \u2014 and plenty of applicants for the next vacant set, Mr. Jallett : yes, Mrs. M., plenty \u2014 though you told me I should never get a tenant !\" Old Phillibert was evidently in one of his crusty fits. Even Rags saw that : he had been sitting on the rug, smiling whenever he caught his master's eyes {a dog's smile, as you are of course aware, consists in the agitation of his caudal vertebrae) ; but when he heard the tone of his voice, he crept under the table, and lay down, with one eye on his master's foot, prepared to jump away in case of a kick. He might have placed himself safely beyond reach of the foot, but the dog was fond of his master, and preferred keeping near him, even at the risk of a blow. The sign-board was a very quaint one. It was divided into five compartments. In the centre stood a king in robes and crown, with the legend, \" I rule all,\" over his head. On his right were a parson in wig and gown, aud a councillor, also in wig and gown, with the mottoes respectively, \" I pray for all,\" and \" I plead for all.\" These two figures were balanced in the corresponding compartments on the mo narch's left by a soldier, over whose head was written, \" I fight for all ;\" and by a farmer, whose superscription ran, ' ' I pay for all. \" The sign had been cleaned and restored frequently, but the date of its original painting was beyond the memory of the oldest inhabitant. It was regarded as a local lion, and the whole parish would have risen in arms if its safety had been threatened. The inn was therefore supported by all the paro chial big-wigs, vestrymen, churchwardens, and guardians of the poor. The late lamented Mumby had been one of the grandees \u2014 he had been way-warden and auditor, and led the singers at church, besides being head of the ringers. A tumble down the belfry-stairs, aggravated by gin-and-water in the constitution, had thrown these various high offices open, and had committed the care of the \"Five Alls\" to his widow, Margaret Mumby, who had been a beauty in her day, and even at the time I am writing of looked very bonny indeed as she sat in the bar-parlour, whither only a few favoured customers were allowed to penetrate. On this particular evening there was but one visitor, and he sat in a cosy arm-chair on the same side of the fire as the widow. That visitor was Timothy Jallett, and he looked very happy, indeed, as he caressed his knee, sipped his whiskey-and-water, and smiled over his spectacles at the widow. Suddenly the door opened, and in stalked old Phillibert. \"Good evening, mum! Humph! Mr. Jallett\u2014 you here, eh?\" As Timothy Jallett, however, was not old Phillibert's dog, and certainly not tondly attached to him, he thought it pru dent to get out of the old man's reach ; so he quietly tossed off his glass of grog, bade Mrs. Mumby and his landlord good night, and took his departure. Old Phillibert devoted the rest of the evening to making himself unpleasant to Mrs. Mumby, and succeeded so com pletely that it made him go to bed happy. Poor Mrs. Mumby ! by the time Philhbert had been in the house a week, she had got heartily sick of him, and wished him gone. But he made no mention of going. In fact, he was determined to stop over Christmas, in order to see that that merry season did not sap the foundations of Bachelors* Buildings. He began to be uneasy about his tenants. He had called on Calthrop a dozen times, and invariably found he was out. Martin James had spent a good many evenings \"with some friends.\" Gillray had been into town on busi ness connected with his uncle's will very often, and Lawes was seldom at home. Jallett was the only one, except Tom Ashby, who spent much time in the Buildings. So old Phillibert determined to watch his tenants' doings. In order to spoil sport, if possible, he asked them all to dine with him on Christmas Day at the Five Alls \u2014 \"a pleasant bachelor party, you know, gentlemen \u2014 a pleasant bachelor party \u2014 no women ! I shall depend on your all coming ! \" They were obliged to accept the invitation, for he took them all by surprise, and they had no time to invent excuses. But they all internally prayed that something might happen within the next ten days to knock the engagement on the head. \"Well, ye-es !\" said Jallett, with a sickly attempt at a smile. \"I adore whiskey, and Mrs. Mumby 's is \" \"Oh, yes, Mrs. Mumby's spirits are excellent\u2014 better than her husband's were, poor fellow !\" said Phillibert, with savage meaning. \"Why, they're the very same, Mr. P.,\" said the widow, CHAPTER V. \u2014 CALTHROP BECOMES CONSULTING COUNSEL. Since he had come to live in Bachelors' Buildings, Calthrop had seen a good deal of Tom Ashby, and Tom Ashby had seen much to like in Calthrop, in spite of his faults. So Tom Ashby set himself quietly to cultivate the other's good qualities, and had succeeded in showing the young barrister that his philosophy was as silly as it was bad. Calthrop's worst points were assumed, in the idea that they made him remarkable; so that he had little difficulty in shaking them off as soon as he saw their folly. But what had done as much as all Tom's eloquence was the speaking glance of a pair of blue eyes that Henry had met at a ball. At first he paid Belle Brandon the careless attention he was wont to pay to every pretty face. But she was not a girl you could flirt with with impunity, and Henry Calthrop had to confess himself a captive in a very short space of time. Now, Belle Brandon had encouraged Cal throp at first, in order to pay him out for his sneers at her sex. She knew him, by reputation, as a heartless and designing flirt, and she had determined to pay him out in his own coin. But, before she had tortured him very long, she found herself first pitying, and then loving him. Calthrop was rising rapidly in his profession, and had some means of his own. He would fain have made Belle his wife at once. But over his head, as over the heads of the other"], [20, "THE \" FIFE ALLS.\" 10 H \" He'd imprison you, Jallett,\" said Tom, in an awful voice. \" Think of spending your honeymoon in Whitecross-street. Or he'd make your wife pay\" \"That's just it, Mr. Calthrop. Could he make her pay for my debts contracted before marriage?\" Before Calthrop could answer, another rap came at the door. \"That's Phillibert, this time !\" said Tom. \"Oh, I don't want to see him,\" said Timothy, waving his hands about helplessly ; \"please put me somewhere. I've avoided him since we met at the Five Alls,\" he added, in a whisper, as Calthrop pushed him into the coal-cupboard, and then called to the last arrival to come in. It was not Phillibert, after all \u2014 it was William Gillray. He flung himself into the chair so lately quitted by Jallett, and plunged at once in medias res. \"I'm glad you're here, Ashby. I came to consult Cal throp about this cursed lease of Phillibert's.\" \" What, do you want to cry off? \" said Tom. \"Yes, I do! I've been a confounded fool, and made myself miserable \u2014 and, what's more, made a poor girl, who truly loved me, miserable into the bargain.\" \"You want to know if there's a loophole whereby to slip out of a contract which you made with your eyes open, is that it?\" tenants in Bachelors' Buildings, there hung the lease which old Phillibert had burdened with pains and penalties, that would have entailed a serious sacrifice. Old Phillibert had made out the leases for seven years, and had inserted a condition whereby, if any tenant quitted the Buildings to marry before the expiration of the seven years, he was to pay down twice the rent for the unexpired period, to give a hundred pounds to any charity Phillibert might name, and surrender all furniture and fittings in his chambers. These conditions were severe enough to frighten away any but the most confirmed devotees to celibacy. But the six tenants who had taken the chambers smiled at the provisos, for, as we know, each came to Bachelors' Buildings with the strongest conviction that they could never \u2014 never want to -evade the conditions, for woman had ceased to exercise a spell over their desolate hearts ! One night, when Tom Ashby had dropped in to smoke a pipe with him, Henry Calthrop took heart of grace and confessed to his visitor that he was in love, and wished to marry. \" You've known Phillibert longer than I. Do you think he would release me, or relax his conditions?\" \" Not a jot \u2014 he'd exact the last farthing of the money, and seize the smallest tin-tack in the floor.\" \"Confound it, and I've got five years to run yet !\" At this moment there came a knock at the door. \" Come \"You needn't put it in that unpleasant way. My eyes were not open ; they were blinded by folly and anger.\" \" That plea wont stand you in much stead.\" \"No, but, look here, Calthrop, is there not something about what-ye-may-call-it's being void if they're drawn up for an improper consideration?\" \" Here's Phillibert coming,\" said Tom ; \" I can hear him on the stairs ; you'd better ask him.\" \"No, hang it, I'd rather not meet him just yet, for I stumbled on him yesterday near the Five Alls as I was walking with my cousin, and he looked as savage as a bear. I'll get behind this curtain !\" \"I'm afraid, Tom,\" said Calthrop, laughing, \"that from what we can see, old P. will have a very small meet at dinner next week. Come in ! \" in,\" shouted Calthrop, and Charles Lawes entered. He seemed a little surprised at seeing Tom \u2014 perhaps a little disconcerted. But he sat down, lit a pipe, and joined in conversation. But it was evident that he had come for some specific purpose, for he was very absent, and wandered in his talk. At last he gave a gulp, and said : \u2014 \" I came to consult you, Calthrop \u2014 but I don't mind your hearing it, Ashby \u2014 only don't say anything about it.\" \" What is it ?\" said Calthrop. \"Why, about this lease of ours.\" Tom and Calthrop exchanged a quick glance of surprise. \" I just happened to come on my copy of it to-day. I'd not read it carefully before. It's very strict, isn't it? Just as a matter of curiosity, now \u2014 would Phillibert be entitled to claim all the conditions if one left\" Again the door opened \u2014 but it was not old Phillibert this time either ! Poor Martin James slid quietly into the room \u2014 keeping as close to the wall as possible, as if for support. He turned red and white \u2014 not to mention any other colours \u2014 like a dying dolphin, and gasped for breath, and smacked his lips like a skate out of water. \"Well, James, what's the matter? Seen a ghost?\" Martin shook his head. \"And married?\" added Tom, with a smile. \" I'm afraid so,\" answered Calthrop. \" Ah ! \" said Lawes, with a heavy sigh. A long silence followed. \"You're not thinking of marrying, eh, Lawes?\" asked Tom. ' ' Me ! Oh dear, no ! Oh no ! At least \u2014 well, no ! But it occurred to me there might be a case in which a man might be placed somehow, so that \u2014 well, for instance, sup posing an old friend died and left an orphan daughter without a penny \u2014 oh, hang it, one may as well be honest ! There's poor Mary Marville \u2014 you've heard me speak of her \u2014 she's left without a friend or a farthing in the world, and really it seems as if the only thing a fellow could do would be to marry her. But hark ! there's some one at the door. It's that old Phillibert \u2014 I don't want to see him. I feel so un nerved with all this. Where can I go?\" ' ' What is it, then ? Speak up ! \" \"Well, if you please, Mr. Calthrop \u2014 will you \u2014 please I want to know \u2014 can you \u2014 would you mind \u2014 you see, the lease !\" Calthrop gave a long whistle. ' ' Well, James, if you've mustered courage to pop the question and are going to be married, it is time old Philli more pulled down Bachelors' Buildings !\" \" What do you mean, sir?\" \"Why, that Mr. Lawes, who's in my little room, and Mr. Jallett, who's in the coal-cupboard, and Mr. Gillray, who's behind the curtain, are all going to be married as well as you \u2014 and so am I. So, since we're all in the same boat, we'd better lay our heads together and consult what to do !\" Thus adjured, the three who were in hiding came out look ing a little shame-faced. Seeing which, Calthrop insisted on their filling a glass all round, and drinking confusion to old Phillibert and his lease. \"Step into the little room, there,\" said Calthrop, adding, \" Come in !\" as a tap sounded at the door. The new comer was Timothy Jallett. He started, and seemed about to retreat, when he saw Tom Ashby. \" Come in, Jallett,\" said Calthrop; \"Tom and I are only abusing the fair sex. Come and sit down.\" The old man took the chair just vacated by Lawes, and looked gravely at Tom. \"I've never heard you speak against women, Mr. Ashby. I \u2014 I \u2014 I hope you don't.\" \"Timothy Jallett,\" said Calthrop gravely, \"you are a traitor to these Buildings. You're in love, Timothy, and you know it.\" Timothy did not deny it, but made a sort of deprecatory flap with his bony hands. \"You'll have to break down, put up the banns, and pay forfeit to Phillibert, I see plainly.\" \"Mr. Calthrop, sir \u2014 I confess it, I came to you to ask about those conditions. I'm a poor man, sir \u2014 a very poor man, sir. He couldn't enforce the agreement against me. I'm a man of straw, sir \u2014 a man of straw !\" Then they sat down and discussed the question. But their united wisdom failed in discovering any way of evading the conditions of the lease. Tom Ashby took no part in the discussion, but sat looking into the fire very solemnly, and smoking his pipe with tremendous energy. When they had given up suggesting plans, and were silent from sheer despair and weariness, Tom looked up. \"You're all beaten, eh? Can't see your way out. Very well ! Leave it to me, and I'll get you out of the pickle. But you must wait patiently till Christmas Day, for it will take me till then to mature my plans !\" CHAPTER VI. \u2014 THE HAUNTED CHAMBER, Old Phillibert took a stiff tumbler of punch before he went j made his hand unsteady, too, for he droDoed hk o\u2122hi\u00bb \u2122a to bed on Christmas Eve.

In front of his window hung the sign-board. It was so near that he could hear it creak as the wind swung it. Tiiere was barely enough wind to sway the great board on this night, but all was so still out of doors that the least sound made itself distinctly heard. A sound that soon made itself distinctly heard was old Phillibert's snore. It was faintly re-echoed from outside the door, where Rags was reposing on the mat. All at once Rags gave a most unearthly howl. Old Phillibert woke in a fright, and sat bolt upright in his bed. He gazed round him and listened, holding his breath. compartments and the five legends. But the five compart ments were blank ! He rubbed his eyes and looked again. There was no mis take about it \u2014 the figures had disappeared. Again came the unearthly strain of music sighing into the room. Old Philli bert shivered \u2014 a sigh sounded at the foot of the bed \u2014 he looked towards it, and beheld a figure standing between the opening of the curtains. Old Phillibert broke into a cold sweat, and squeezed him self up against the head of the bed as far as possible from the apparition. It was a misty, indistinct figure, although the moonbeams fell full upon it. A battered gold crown encircled its grey locks \u2014 its white beard fell down over a faded purple mantle, and in its hands it bore the sceptre and orb. Old Phillibert's teeth chattered so that he could hardly jerk out the terrified question, \u2014 \" Who are you ? What do you want ?\" \"I am Human Affection. I rule all !\" said the ghost, in a hollow voice. \" On this night, in every year, I am permitted to visit earth with my companions, and to relate, when chal lenged by a living being, the history of a kingly hfe. Listen !\" And then, while old Phillibert sat up in bed shaking in every limb, the spectre related the following story : \u2014 Rags was silent, but he could hear a low, wild strain of music. He listened attentively \u2014 it sounded in the direction of the window. Phillibert drew back the curtain hurriedly and looked towards the window. The moon was still shining clearly \u2014 but he saw something shining that was brighter than the moon ! Along the bottom of the old sign-board was a line of bright-blue, flickering flame. It lighted up the sign with a weird, ghastly light, and old Phillibert saw .the five THE KING 'S STORY. I CANNOT say that I was exactly Porphyry \u2014 what is it? Porphyro-granitic ? \u2014 no, genitus, thank you! I cannot say that I was exactly Po rphyro genitus ; my parents, who loved me fondly, having been rather in the way of Retail Trade, which has returned the compliment by being rather in my way ever since ; but I had, from a comparatively early and a positively boyish age, the presentiment of Future Greatness. At my time of life, the pride of personal ap pearance is a passion almost extinct, though I hope I do not cany my years with less dignity than other men ; but there was, I am convinced, a good deal of truth in the early remark of my mamma, \u2014 \" Bless the little fellow, he looks every inch a king !\" This Royal look, I am told, to employ the language of the Bard, \"grew with my growth and strengthened with my strength.\" What a man the Bard must have been ! Look at his eye for character, my dear sir, and at the loveliness of his expressions ! [ n my choice of a profession, I was limited by circumstances over which it would have been the height of folly for me to pretend to have any control. The Bar, the Church, Medi cine, and Arms, were alike closed against me by the absence of capital. \"Who steals my purse, steals trash\" \u2014 Shak speare. To the calling of my parent, B. Magnus, Grocer, I had an invincible repugnance. There are aspirations which treacle cannot satisfy, nor sugar realize ; and when my father, after a long course of humble but unnoticed industry, was suddenly mentioned in the public prints, under the head \"Gazette\" and the sub-division \" Bankrupts\" \u2014 when he told me, I being then eighteen, that I must provide for my own support, I could think of nothing better than running away and seeking my fortune on the Stage. I am well aware that the avocation of a Strolling Player has often been made the theme of ridicule ; but I cannot forget that the late Mr. John Philip Kemble \u2014 my ideal of a tragic actor \u2014 was also a member of the more peripatetic branch of the profession. It is, I believe, on record that he frequently made his homely meal off turnips. They are, never theless, unsatisfactory as a solitary viand, though excellent as an accompaniment to boiled mutton. When I knew them it was chiefly by themselves ; and they did not always agree with me. Remarkable, perhaps, rather for stateliness of bearing and dignity of demeanour than for the lighter qualities of the Thospian art, I was generally called upon to fill the part of a Shakspearian monarch. There's a divinity doth hedge a king. Bard. Nor was I trusted with Lear, a ruler whose passionate style of oratory was perhaps a little beyond my powers \u2014 nor Macbeth, to whom the same remark applies. My Duncan (of Scotland), however, is still remembered as Roman in its classic majesty ; and myClaudius (of Denmark), might also have been cradled on the banks of Tiber. For once, upon a raw and gusty day, the troubled Tiber chafing with her shores. Bard. In fact, it was always my ambition to be Roman, like Mr. Kemble. I am glad to see that even the tragedians of the present day are actuated by the same honourable desires. In other branches of the art, there is an attempt to be what is called\" natural and realistic.\" Our tragedians, I am delighted to hear, are still faithful to the better traditions of the past. Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown. Bard. The remuneration of my efforts was trifling. Straw, as a pillow, was not unfamiliar to the mimic monarch. Beef, as a meal, was. My earlier years, however, were not unhappy. I doubt whether anybody is unhappy before five-and-twenty : \u2014 I mean, seriously wretched. So long as I had only myself to consider and to provide for, I slept soundly, and ate with an ex cellent appetite many a repast which would now appear un savoury, not to say abominable. My spirits \u2014 I allude, of course, to my temperament and not to liquor, for which I never really cared \u2014 were excellent. Your merry heart goes all the way, your sad one tires in a mile \u2014 a ! Bard. As a rule, we managed to be merry hearts. On my honour, I can scarcely tell you how we did it. Hunger, I know, we had to bear, and bad lodgings, and scanty pay, and contempt, and patronage that was worse ; but we kept toge ther, somehow. And \u2014 perhaps it was the habit of being familiar with the Bard \u2014 we were a company, with all our little jealousies, never weary of doing small kindnesses, which for us were large ones, to one another. I have invariably re marked this loving friendliness as a characteristic of the pro fession. We may not, all of us, be very clever ; I am informed that the British merchant is apt to despise us ; but there are at least two of his favourite virtues which we vaga bonds and strollers happen to possess ; \u2014 we are, in pro portion to our means, quite as charitable, and in punctuality we beat him hollow ! The quality of mercy is twice blessed. There is a tide in the affairs of men. Both, Bard. Few of us were old men. Wilding \u2014 \"Father Fred,\" we called him \u2014 was almost the only one of us who was at all in the sere and yellow leaf \u2014 Bard ; and his daughter Mary was the idol of us all. She was, particularly, mine. I took the liberty to love her with my whole heart and soul, and looked forward to the day when, after a successful appearance on the London boards, I might woo and win her. Such little services as I could render her papa, I did. I am afraid he was, collo quially putting it, a Bad Old Lot. The fathers of young actresses, I am afraid, often are. Many is the time and oit that I have assisted Mary to put him to bed, at a period when he was under the influence of combined gin-and-water and dramatic excitement. On such occasions, old Wilding \u2014 who was, like myself, well acquainted with the Bard \u2014 never seemed to be particularly grateful, but preferred to imagine himself King Lear. \" Do come to bed, papa 1\" Mary would say. \"How sharper than a serpent's \u2014 hiccup \u2014 tooth it is,\" replied the gin-and-watery old reprobate, \"to have a thank less \u2014 hiccup \u2014 child !\" I made my appearance on the London boards in due time. The criticisms of the press \u2014 which I could show you at your leisure, having always cut them out and pasted them in a book \u2014 would convince you that it was not altogether unsuc cessful. If I never created an excitement, like little Kean, I hope I trod faithfully in the measured footsteps of Mr."], [22, "12 THE \"FIFE ALLS.\" practise despair as a branch of the profession. I don't suppose that he was insincere ; the fact is, he had a real gift for affliction. His sympathies, I am sure, were always ready; and if nothing in particular had happened to himself, he usually had a tear at the service of his neighbour. So, when \" Father Fred\" expired, Edgar Lindsay's tastes made him mournfully agreeable to Mary. I am sure he was sincerely sorry for the death ; and his sorrow was all the more creditable, because he was, perhaps, the only man in our little circle who had never lent the old reprobate a shilling, and, consequently, was not a sufferer by his demise. Together they indulged in the luxury of woe, and at last, I think, they got to like it. Poor Mary, she had gone through so many real troubles already that a good cry came natural I Besides, she had time for it, now. As long as the old man lived, she managed \u2014 what a brave heart it was, of hers ! to keep a cheery face ; but now that her melancholy task was over, and he had gone to his account, hysteria supervened. When I spoke to her of comfort and courage, I fear I called upon her to make another effort for which her strength did not suffice her. Edgar Lindsay's voice was more welcome, when he spoke to her only of grief. By-and-bye, it was not distasteful when he spoke to her also of love. Within the year she married him. Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon it, Bard. Also hard upon \u2014 me. As an oppressed artist, Lindsay had rather a contempt for some of those minor virtues which the rest of us found it de sirable to practise. He was so conscious of his superior powers, and so certain of his ultimate success, that he never regulated his present expenditure by his actual income : \u2014 and he had such a disdain for the almost mechanical nature of his employment in the orchestra, that he took no particular pains to be punctual. After his marriage, more especially, he neglected his disagreeable, prosaic, humdrum work ; and, with Mary's little inheritance, they led a somewhat luxurious life. He got a fortnight's holiday, and I am sure he enjoyed it. But he was far too refined a nature to care for the coarse hob-nobbing to which some of us were partial : \u2014 and, instead of standing \"glasses round \" at our favourite public, near the stage-door, and consequently up a court, Lindsay, with a soul above gin-and-water, had some nice little dinners at more expensive places of resort. His wife did not accom pany him ; but no doubt she was pleased to see her husband make a sort of figure in the world, and was proud of him whenever \u2014 well, whenever he had not been exceeding. O, that man should put an enemy into his mouth ! Bard. At the end of their honey-half-moon, if you will allow me the expression, the leader of the orchestra had a good deal of difficulty with Edgar, whose fearless spirit spurned some of those petty restrictions to which the rest of us were accus tomed to submit. And as, after all, it is vexatious to find that you are a violin short, complaints were made. Let me be quite fair to Lindsay : I am sure I have earned the right to be so. He played well \u2014 far better, indeed, than the aver age of stage musicians. He might have become leader him self, if he hadn't wanted to be Paganini at a leap ! He would be content, however, with no ordinary modicum of success ; he wanted to be rich and famous without going through the preliminary ordeal ; and, by Jove, sir, he would rather sit at home and play classical music to his wife than keep his appointment at the theatre ! Nor was Mary the kind of woman to reclaim him. She believed in him, poor girl ! I have not a pleasant recollection of their married life \u2014 especially I have not a pleasant recollection of the visits that I paid them. I scarcely like to say it, even now ; but, on my honour, I believe that he was jealous ! You see, he had never learnt\u2014 I had, through him !\u2014 the lesson of self sacrifice ; and he could not quite see how I might love Mary Wilding as a sister, even after she had become Edgar Lind say's wife. That I did so love her, and loved her in no other way, nor dreamt of loving her in any other way, God is my witness ! My own life seemed suddenly to have lost much of its purpose and interest ; \u2014 somehow, I felt as though I were no longer an actor in it, but merely a spectator ; as though, in fact, I were on the wrong side of the footlights ; but I was, at any rate, a well-disposed audience. At length, the complaints at the theatre became more serious ; and ultimately Lindsay was discharged. I think that he rather relished his dismissal, looking upon it as a fresh proof that the sordid world was inimical to genius After that, he tried many things, never with any particular success For many months he was scarcely able to earn a living \u2022 and there were now three mouths to feed. I am sure havinsr seen a good deal of them at the time, and perhaps done my Kemble. It was, at any rate, my ambition so to do ; and to be \u2014 Roman. This was the noblest Roman of them all. Bard. I think that by dint of long and loving service, I had be come not indifferent to Mary Wilding ; and that, if no worthier suitor had appeared, she would have shared my regal lot, such as it was. But, at the very time when I was most successful \u2014 and the cuttings, sir, would show you what was thought of my Claudius by the writers for the public prints \u2014 she became acquainted with one who, I am sure, was far my superior. The course of true love never did run smooth. Bard. I did, I think, all that a man could do. My personal appearance \u2014 this was many years ago \u2014 was, they tell me, majestic. His was the reverse. Even without his robes of theatric state, George Magnus was a personable man. That, sir, sounds a little like blank verse. If I should ever unconsciously deviate into that medium of expression, be good enough to (ay it to the Bard. Edgar Lindsay was my rival's name. As a violinist in the orchestra of the Theatre Royal, his earnings were scarcely on a par with mine ; and in the earlier stages of our personal acquaintance, he was not averse from receiving at my hands an occasional accommodation, trifling in its amount, pecu niary in its character. Base is the slave who pays. Bard. There was nothing slavish or base about Edgar Lindsay. A thin, dark little man, with an oval face and long black hair ; he was fond of proclaiming himself to be an artist, and of declaring that he was unjustly slighted by a sordid world. And really, sir, he talked wonderfully well. As a rule, I think he confined himself mainly to a subject in which he felt a thorough interest \u2014 namely, himself. But I am, perhaps, un just to him. I am no orator, as the gentleman in question was. Bard, slightly altered. That he ever loved Mary Wilding as / loved her \u2014 was ever half so ready to bear trouble and hardship for her sake \u2014 I didn't believe, and I don't. That she preferred him to me, however, that I did believe, and I do. When \"Father Fred\" died it was found, to our intense astonishment, that he had saved a little money. How he did it I cannot tell ; but I fancy that in most conditions of life a thoroughly selfish man will never die penniless. Whether his accumulations do him much final good, you know, is a totally different question. But, at any rate, Wilding had never been known to spend a sixpence un necessarily ; those of his old companions who had prospered in the world made a whip round to bury him ; and a week afterwards Mary found what is called a \"nest-egg.\" It was not much ; but it was a good deal more ready money than any of the rest of us possessed. She wanted to pay back our little subscription ; but, as you may guess, we couldn't stand that I For my part \u2014 though God knows I was anxious enough to comfort the poor girl, \u2014 I hadn't the moral courage, I suppose, to go and sit with her of a morning in the first few weeks after his death. Lindsay was braver than I, no doubt, as he was far cleverer, far more brilliant. To my thinking, though, it was a wrong thing, a cowardly and cruel thing, to make those visits of condolence visits of courtship. I don't assume to judge a man who was better educated than I am, and who could, at any time, easily put me down in discussion. Besides, the temptation ! She must have been as beautiful to him as to me ; I daresay he loved her as ardently ; we only differed in the ways of showing it. For my part, as soon as I laid aside my crown and robes of state, I was plain George Magnus ; but he. though he had no robes\u2014 and, by-the-bye, it was not often that he had a crown\u2014 never would be plain Edgar Lindsay. He seemed to have the gift of making his own life into a sort of play. He was always an artist, as oppressed as you like, and re quiring a Ministering Spirit\u2014 meaning Mary\u2014 to cheer him in his struggle with the world. For myself, / wanted her as a Wife ; and it was my intention to cheer her quite as much as she could cheer me, looking upon that as part of a husband's business. If you come to neglect and want of sympathy on the part of the public, I had my grievances quite as much as he had, my first benefit, in which I played King John (by desire) proving a decided failure \u2014 but it never occurred to me as being the proper thing to do to go and whine to a woman. Now, Edgar \u2014 probably because he was a more refined organization, you know \u2014 always sought sympathy; whenever anything gave him a facer, if you will excuse the term, he poured hissorrows into another's bosom, which, as I thought, must have been rather inconvenient for another ; and he really seemed to me to cultivate melancholy as an art, and to"], [23, "THE KING'S STORY\u2014\" I RULE ALL.\" 13 best to help, as we say, a lame dog over the stile, that he was most kind to Mary through all her troubles, and some how, I began to believe that baby might do more to reform her father than either his wife or his friends could do. It is a statement that he could scarcely force himself to sit down at his desk. He hadn't a desk, by-the-by ; but that, of course, was what we call poetic license. I should be sorry, sir, to humbug you, or any other gentle man ; and if I were to tell you that the care of a female baby \u2014 somebody else's \u2014 aged twelve months \u2014 is either a sinecure or a delight, I should be telling fibs. From a high moral point of view, no doubt, such a charge has its interest ; but, my dear sir, it's downright rubbish to talk about mould ing the infant mind. A good many poets have written in praise of babies. My own opinion is, that the poets were not free agents. Their wives made 'em do it, sir : \u2014 made 'em do it ! Talk about the rosy lips of innocence ; pooh 1 The rosy lips of innocence open when they want pap ; kiss you as they lick a spoon \u2014 and not with half so much enjoyment. Lucy Lindsay \u2014 of whom you have probably heard under the name, subsequently assumed, of Miss Grace Montgomery \u2014 was, to the best of my knowledge and belief, not much different from other infants ; my opinion of whom I have already stated. As a Man, however, not to say a Monarch, what was I to do? One couldn't desert a baby ; at least, one could \u2014 her papa ! but she had never injured me, up to that period, by increasing responsibility and expenditure. Willy nilly I had to keep her ; and if, for a certain time, I felt it rather as a burden, you will be good enough to lay that to the nurse. Nurse had filled the same office in poor Lind say's house \u2014 I mean room ; and she was the most unpleasant piece of virtue I ever met. Look here, sir. Patience has its limits. Proverb. Nurse was Scottish by origin, Presbyter by persuasion, and, pre suming upon the homely nature of my establishment, she sought to reclaim me \u2014 me, George Magnus \u2014 by domestic sermons against the wickedness of stage plays I She had, like others, what is called a sweet tooth. I tried to propitiate her through that medium. At the end of a supper, at once succulent and Scottish \u2014 of which, upon my honour, she partook with zest \u2014 may good digestion wait on appetite, and health on both, Bard \u2014 she reviled me for \" wallowing on the wages of iniquity !\" We wallowed, however, on those wages, in tolerable com fort ; and when two or three years had passed, I began to find that little Lucy gradually detached her ideas from pap, on which hitherto they had mainly rested, and fixed them, partially, on me. It would take the Bard himself, sir, to tell you all the interest that there is in watching a Uttle baby-mind really grow. After they have got through their first period, \u2014 during which I still maintain that they are scarlet, doughy, and uninteresting, \u2014 there is a real charm about them. I don't speak as a father. I never had the advantage to occupy that position. It might, perhaps, have interfered with my im partiality. I speak, sir, as a spectator, who has been, to a certain extent, behind the scenes. I judge a baby as calmly as a drama ; and I say, speaking critically, that little Lucy was well constructed, full of incident, and \u2014 thank God ! \u2014 furnished with appropriate scenery, dresses, and decorations. troublesome, however, say what you will, to tend a baby, nor was domestic devotion Lindsay's real forte. If he began, at last, to look upon Uttle Lucy as only another burden added to a life already overweighted, I, for one, will not blame him over harshly. You see, he was weak, nervous, feverish, easily excited, easily depressed ; and men of that kind, so far as I have seen, bear misfortune rather badly. When Mary was strong and well again, he thought she might help. She sang well, and was \u2014 have I told you? \u2014 singularly pretty. He and I quarrelled about it ; but it ended in her doing what she could. \" She shall share, God bless her, in my triumphs!\" said Lindsay. \" Would you keep her from sharing in my trials ? Ask her I\" \"I sha'n't ask her!\" I answered. \"As for your tri umphs, why do you fling yourself out of work ? As for your trials, I, for one, vote dead against a woman's going to con cert rooms, and singing herself hoarse in the midst of bad tobacco.\" \" For shame, George, for shame !\" said Mary. \"Do you want me to be a burden on him all my life ? Do you think I could look my babe in the face if I \u2014 if I,\" and the speech ended. They became miserably poor. Poverty to a single man means little. Poverty with a wife and child is hideous, sir \u2014 hideous ! The poor fellow's health failed him. He seemed ready enough to work now ; but work was not to be had for the asking. Soon, his wife's earnings were their chief sup port ; and towards the end of their second year of married life, she too could earn no more. His friends \u2014 who were chiefly hers \u2014 did all they could, many of them doing far more than I. Amongst us all, we managed to keep their household together ; and we looked forward, as hopefully as we could, to better times. But for Mary, the season of trouble was nearly over. Her voice was ever soft, gentle, and low \u2014 an excellent thing in woman. Bard. But it grew softer, lower, and more gentle ; and one morning, when they held little Lucy to her breast, and Edgar sat by the bed-side, it was so faint, so pitifully faint, that he could scarcely hear the \"God bless you, dearest,\" which was the last thing she uttered upon earth. Thus, sir, my first love ended. By my own misery, per haps, I can gauge his. It was more than he could bear. On a dismal night in December, when I came back, rather late, to my room, I found a letter on the table. It com mended little Lucy to my charge ; and it told me that her father, \" heart-broken, \" as he said, \"had left the country.\" ******* I confess I was rather staggered. Sweet are the uses of adversity. Bard. The Bard, no doubt, knew what he was talking about ; and, accordingly, meant his words to be taken with a quali fication \u2014 cum grano sails, as we say in the classics. Some men, many, let us hope, are the better for adversity ; but others, most decidedly, are not. The regimen is one that don't suit all cases \u2014 alike. If you have a very keen sense of your own actual troubles, and only a dim, doubtful sense of the good that is to come from them, adversity, as a rule, floors you. It's all very well to talk of imagination ; but imagination isn't beef \u2014 it isn't clothes \u2014 it isn't house rent, nor yet siring. For who can hold a fire in his hand by thinking of the frozen Caucasus ? Bard. So, as you see, he gives the best answer to himself. What a man he was ! Poor Lindsay wouldn't have been half a bad sort of fellow, if he had been thoroughly successful, according to his own notions of success. He had ever, I think, a talent for patron izing people, as it was. But his wasn't a nature that could well bear wind and weather. He didn't stand ' ' four square, \" so to speak. He was full of talent, and full of affection, and full of susceptibility ; but, as I told you, he did run away, and he did desert his child. Perhaps, even then, he knew \u2014 at any rate, perhaps he believed \u2014 that he should come back to claim her, as a successful man. He said so in his letter \u2014 a remarkable document, full of the loveliest expressions. Ah, sir, 1 wish I had time to read you that beautiful passage \u2014 it would be rather too long, though, after all \u2014 in which he de picted the intensity of a father's affection for his babe ! The Bard himself, sir, would not have been ashamed of it ! The whole letter was a masterpiece. It must have taken him, I should think, a couple of days to write, though it began with My own professional career may be found recorded in the columns of my country's press. Speaking of it candidly, it is my impression that I was born too late, and that the taste for legitimate acting was already on the wane at the period when I first donned what you will probably allow me to call the sock and buskin. Fortunately for myself, however, there were still believers in the Shakspearian drama ; and although I have lived to see many startling innovations, I am proud to state that my own Claudius and my own Duncan still appear to be the types on which the existing representatives of those most important parts continue to model their conception of the character. And hence, although I gradually learnt to dismiss the notion of ever making my fortune on the boards, I managed to secure a tolerably fair remuneration, combined with \u2014 I trust \u2014 the esteem of the manager, the good-will of my fellow-actors, the appreciation of the gentlemen of the press, and the kind indulgence of our friends in front. The story of our lives from year to year (Bard) would, I fear, fail to interest you. The domestic drama depends, for a great deal of its attractiveness, upon incidents more start ling than I should like to relate. After all, measles and others of the ills that flesh is heir to (Bard), are scarcely susceptible of theatrical treatment. Let it suffice, then, that Lucy grew up, a fine child, then a fine girl \u2014 properly tended at first, and afterwards properly taught. She paid me, at any rate, abun dantly : \u2014 not that I brought her on the stage as an infant phenomenon, for I am not, I trust, a brute ; but by the great, deep love she always showed for me. We never talked"], [24, "THE \"FIFE ALLS.\" 14 bearing which lest the stage, I fear, for ever, with Mr. Kemble. She saw me, too, in my favourite character mat of Claudius. The tragedy of Hamlet was, I am afraid, a little above her juvenile power of appreciation ; for it is beyond a doubt that she preferred the ridiculous farce which followed\u2014 the chief actress in which she mimicked with, I admit, remarkable success, immediately on her return And from that day \" she would be an actress. I think now, judging both by my reasons at the tune, and by the light of the result, that I was wise, when at length I yielded to her strong predilection, and prepared her, to the best of my ability\u2014 as to which I would again refer you to the public press\u2014 for the profession. I had exceptionally good opportunities of training her ; as, during the recess, I was frequently engaged as manager of private theatricals, in which the services of a professional lady were occasionally required. Testimonials\u2014 which are still in my possession would show you what was thought of my exertions by my patrons, among whom were many conspicuous members of the fashionable world. It was during the rehearsals for one of these performances that she became acquainted with, the young man \u2014 a gentle man, I am bound to admit, of high principle and consider able talent, though, perhaps, the very worst Claude Melnotte I have ever had the melancholy honour of instructing \u2014 who subsequently, as we say upon the stage, became enamoured of her. Love at first sight strikes me as being a great deal more common than some of us are in the habit of supposing. At any rate, here was a clear case of it ; and, from a worldly point of view, two young people could hardly have succeeded in making greater fools of themselves. Henry Dering was a youngster of good family and no pecuniary means, except a younger son's allowance ; and, although I had certainly saved a little money, my name was assuredly not Cr\u0153sus, nor that of Lucy Lindsay, Angela Burdett Coutts. It must, I should say, be a miserable moment for a father \u2014 it is certainly not a happy one even for a guardian \u2014 when he first finds that he is no longer chief in his child's love. One knows it must come ; one knows it is all right ; \u2014 but, for all that, it is hard to bear; and I think that instinctively one has a strong distrust and dislike of the intruder who has ventured to poach upon one's private manor of affection. I suppose I am no worse than my neighbours ; and I confess that it was a long while before my feelings towards young Dering were friendly. Why couldn't he love one of his own set, one of his own grade ? what business had he to come between me and Lucy, making a fool of himself, and of her, and of me, too, perhaps, in the bargain? Honourable intentions ? Of course he had honourable intentions, for the lad was a fine lad, and a brave. Loved her? Why, of course he loved her ; he couldn't help it ; no reasonable person could ; no reasonable person did. But it was \u2014 at any rate, it seemed, a most childish piece of folly ; and when first I heard of it, I felt bound to speak to Lucy in a tone which I had never used before. to her about the theatre at home, Elspeth, her nurse, hold ing it to be sinful, and I myself considering such talk inju dicious : nor do I suppose the child ever troubled herself about my calling. The belief of children in those who stand towards them \u2014 excuse the apparent pedantry of the remark \u2014 in loco parentis \u2014 is, to my mind, very charming. How papa gets his living is one of the last questions that they think of asking, appearing to believe, rather, that papa is spontane ously provided for, and that money, when required, turns up. I sincerely wish the belief were more founded upon fact ! As she grew older, however, a clever girl like Lucy could not be kept in ignorance of my profession, of which let me assure you, to prevent misapprehensions, I am not ashamed, but proud. I kept it a secret from her as long as possible, fearing that it might make her more restless and romantic, of which there was no need ; but my poor little precautionary measures were as futile as you may imagine. I am sure that at one time I tried to keep her from the stage as carefully as if I had been an old hen who had reared a duckling in ignorance of its webbed feet, whereas, you know, I was like an old drake, with a strong partiality for the water. There is a slight confusion about those images, I am afraid ; but it is difficult to express one's self metaphorically in the language of ordinary life. In poetry, I suspect, it is easier ; because you can get off, you know, under cover of the rhyme. Whilst Lucy was a child, the responsibility of providing for her was not very onerous. She had the healthy appetite of her age and sex \u2014 the notion that young girls don't care about eating is bosh \u2014 but it's all nonsense to suppose that one little mouth can make all the difference in a household between a modest competency and want. Or dresses. Or scholastic instruction. A little retrenchment in my own ex penditure quite met the need for these things. The difficulty, however, was a good deal more serious when she had grown up. If you know what to do with a girl who has been tolerably well educated, and whose friends are poor, you know a great deal more than most people ; and I advise you to publish the secret in a book. It would sell ! Domestic sendee was out of the question. She was scarcely qualified for a governess \u2014 luckily for her I I did not choose to make her a milliner ; and at that period it was not considered desirable for young ladies to walk the hospitals. Really, sir, the stage, after all, is by no means the worst profession that a girl can choose who has friends to look after her. It has its dangers, no doubt ; but are you aware of any calling in which a girl who is poor and pretty can be considered positively safe ? Also, as I take the liberty to think, natural aptitude ought to count for something ; and the way in which that dear girl used to mimic her nurse would have elicited the com mendation of the late Mr. Mathews himself. From certain statements made by Elspeth, I am inclined to think that Lucy had another character in her repertoire \u2014 that of an old fool (so to speak) whom she regarded a a parent ; but I am quite sure, if so, that she played the part from a mere love of fun, and without any unbecoming irreverence. I never saw it ; but, judging from her imitation of Elspeth (which filled the latter with affright) it must have been rather good ; though, of course, it would be much easier for her to caricature the whimsical peculiarities of an old nurse than to give a faithful representation of my own demeanour. They were happy days ; I am sometimes selfish enough to wish that they could have lasted longer. The merry blue eyes, the curling golden hair, the bright musical voice with its frequent laughter, made my little home very cheerful. When I thought that her father might have had all this happiness, and with a better right to it, a deep pity for Edgar Lindsay took the place of the anger with which at first I had re garded his shameful desertion. News of him there was none ; nor, I confess, did I believe that, if any came, it would be good news. He had chosen his part ; his choice, no matter how great the misery that drove him to it, was the choice of a coward ; and I could hardly reconcile it to my own notions of justice at that time to believe that he would prosper. The worst of it was, however, that you couldn't be seriously angry with that dear girl. She kissed you out of it ; and, at the end of half an hour's scolding on my part, followed by an hour's coaxing on hers, the prevailing impression left on my mind was that I had acted like a monster and a brute. When she had gone to bed, to be sure, and I sat alone with my pipe by the fire-side, the affair seemed as ridiculous as ever ; but, Lord bless you, my dear sir, it looked quite different in the morning when she was buttering my toast for me ! Of course, I tried to put an end to it ; and I was about as successful as an old fool generally is, when he tries any thing of the kind. Lucy, however, though in this matter of affection as mad as a March hare, was too good a girl to disobey me, openly or secretly ; she must have known, also, that their marriage was out of the question, at an)trate, for years to come, that they couldn't live upon air, that his family would positively and absolutely refuse consent, and so on. All of which ought to have made her give up the idea ; and didn't. Young Dering behaved throughout like a perfect gentleman and a confirmed lunatic, obeying my injunctions not to see her in private, and protesting, never theless, that nothing earthly ever could, would, or should alter his deep and ardent, and profound, and passionate affection. Don't imagine I was without troubles or disappointments all this while ; and yet, though I had grave ones, I really think that what pained me most at the time \u2014 it makes me smile now \u2014 was that Lucy, when at last I had her taken to the theatre, was \u2014 well, was not so much impressed, I fear, by her guardian's acting as she would have been if her taste had been more carefully cultivated. Like most giddy young people, she preferred the style of the new school to the stately action, the measured declamation, and the classic And, sir, much as he had loved Lucy Lindsay, I think he loved Miss Grace Montgomery even more. He was not the only young fellow, I promise you, who would gladly have paid suit to the young actress when she came out with such brilliant success \u2014 success to which, I venture to hope, my care-"], [25, "i I THE KINGS STORY\u2014\"! RULE ALL.\" \u25a05 ful professional training may have materially contributed, though I could not indoctrinate her, so much as I desired, with my own ideas of legitimate art. She created, sir, what is known as a. furore. The gentlemen of the press \u2014 younger men, sir, than when / first courted the criticism of the public prints \u2014 became quite poetical in their notices ; and really I think the excitement of success might have turned the poor girl's head if it had not been for the ridiculous passion fn which she still persisted. As for him, sir, his conduct was almost a nuisance. The very box-keepers got to know him by sight, and grin when he entered ; and I am perfectly certain he would have ruined himself in floral purchases \u2014 sweets to the sweet, Bard \u2014 if I had not peremptorily forbidden him to be so demonstrative in his attentions. He was almost estranged, now, from his family \u2014 the young fool ! .... I can't help confessing, though, that I began to like him. Professional life, I have been told, has a certain tendency to make men unpractical and visionary. We are so used to the improbabilities of the drama, and live so much in an atmosphere of romance, that we are often subject to delu sions, from which grocers and other matter of fact people are exempt. We don't always take a reasonable view of life ; we are blind to practical difficulties, or fancy that they may be removed as suddenly in every-day existence as they are upon the stage. Difficulties, forsooth ! By heavens, methinks it were an easy leap to pluck bright honour from the pale faced moon. Bard. It had so engrossed me \u2014 and I was so bent upon its coming true after my fashion, and no other \u2014 that when good tidings came they troubled me : \u2014 that when at length I heard in directly of Edgar Lindsay, and how he was a thriving man, I could not rejoice, as I should have done, over the kind fate that might soon restore Lucy to a father whose amends for his great sin would be to make her happier than I could do \u2014 though, at least, what I had done had been my best \\ Heaven forgive me, but I grudged the girl the money that he sent her a year afterwards ! I had grown selfish \u2014 selfish to the core ; it must have been selfishness, though I never meant it. I could not bear, now, after long years, that any one else, even her father, should fill my place. The tender, trembling tears of joy in which a strange uncertainty, almost a strange fear was mingled \u2014 the tears that she shed when I told her of his gift, of his approaching return, yet never \u2014 I thank God for that! \u2014 revived the story of his desertion \u2014 those tears were bitter to see. That she should love Dering had long ceased to seem unnatural ; but there was still for me the love that is given to a father ; and that, too, I should soon have to share, if not utterly to lose. Hard it seemed, and almost cruel, and if at times I felt a rising anger in me, that sin may, perhaps, be pardoned, for it was the sin of one who loved and who suffered much. Unkind, jealous, unmanly thoughts possessed me. I was glad that Edgar Lindsay's wealth had not been gained in the way that would have also satisfied his pride ; that it was not as a successful artist he would return, but as a rich huckster, who, in trie great gold fever, had traded upon the passion of diggers for drink. I did not fall so low as to tempt my darling away from that love and reverence which was, after all, her father's due by the very right of nature ; I said no word against him, many in his favour ; but in my heart there was an indignant resentment of his claim \u2014 a stubborn mutiny against the fate which I knew awaited me. See you ; the man had ruined my youth \u2014 had taken my first love from me, and left me with an empty heart and the memory of a wasted passion. And now, when by the slow, merciful process of time, the wound was healed, and another love \u2014 ah, so much purer, and holier, and more unselfish than the first ! \u2014 had, through God's good ness, been given me \u2014 this also was to be torn away. And for whom ? There lay the bitterness of it \u2014 for the man who had fled from his wife's grave, and had deserted his child, and came back to claim her only when she could have done with out him. Put it down, then, to this characteristic of the profession \u2014 and also to the fact, that no one can be quite unmoved by the sight of two young and noble hearts very deeply loving each other \u2014 that I began to have day-dreams, which I suppose were altogether absurd. I hardly know, after all, whether their folly was so extreme ; that they never have been realized, I am perfectly and sorrowfully conscious. But, as I walked about in the mornings, when the day was bright and sunny, now strolling in the parks and now loiter ing in my favourite haunt, the cloisters of the Abbey \u2014 and stiU more at night, when Lucy had gone to bed and the house was stiU, and I sat alone with the pipe, always my friend and comforter, the dreams became more and more definite, and grew from mere shadowings of what I wished, into outlines of what might, I fancy, come to pass. That energy of character which made Harry Dering so firm and con stant in his love, would surelystand him in good stead for his battle with the world. England is crowded ; but if you are clever, and brave, and sive-and-twenty, you can either find room, or make it. The youngster would win his way. As for my darling, her success was won already ; and if it brought her as yet no such happiness as I desired, love was the one thing that would make it perfect. Some of the proudest names in England had been joined in marriage to those of actresses. The Stanleys themselves had taken a wife from the stage ; and the family had become cleverer than ever immediately afterwards ! . . . . Were the difficulties so insuperable ? was the passion so absurd? I grow unjust, always, when I think of it, and forget that he has raised her to wealth, and to that position which I know she was meant to adorn. But I can't comfort myself by such phrases tor the loss of my little girl. More than twenty years had passed since that dull De cember night when in my little room I found the letter that confided Lucy to my charge. I remember how the streets were miry, and how I shivered as I hurried home on foot ; how the room was fireless ; how I stumbled as I lit my lamp \u2014 a hundred Uttle incidents of that night, long forgotten, arose again in my memory, and filled me with a strange, dull pain. I fancied, not. And then, as I lit the final pipe \u2014 which, as smokers will, I stuffed fuller than any of the rest \u2014 my fancies became, more conspicuously than hitherto, those of an old fool. But the girl loved me very fondly I knew and know \u2014 nothing, thank God, can ever alter or abate my knowledge of that!\u2014 and Dering, too, though of course he must have growled at me, could not help feeling that what I did was for Lucy's good, and in the end, therefore, for his own. Then, with an amazing leap, almost as wonderful as that which Hotspur spoke of, my fancy jumped forward and began to be busy. It was busy as an attorney, bringing briefs to Dering ; and as a manager, pressing increased salary upon Lucy ; and then as a clergyman of the Established Church, engaged in the marriage service ; and then as a builder and upholsterer, preparing the residence of Henry Dering, Esq., Q.C., and his wife (formerly well known as Miss Grace Montgomery) ; and \u2014 but this was absurd \u2014 as a manufac turer of berceaunettes. At first the infant, mewling and puking in his nurse's arms. Bard ! On a December night he went away. The last gleams of a golden autumn sunset were yet lingering in the west on the night when he returned. I heard his carriage-wheels, I heard his footstep on the stair, I heard \u2014 oh, the pain is keen within me even now which I felt when I heard it ! \u2014 I heard Lucy's voice, half-choking, as she rushed towards him, and flung her arms round his neck, and cried, \"Oh, father, at last I\" Not on that night \u2014 for tire first pain of such a blow be numbs and silences \u2014 not on that night, but before many days, there were hot words between us. He offered me \u2014 me t \u2014 money. ... I think affliction must have worked for good upon my nature, for I did not strike him. ******* I will not hear it said that Lucy was ungrateful, nor believe that she ever ceased to love me. It was my own impetuosity of temper that caused any discord which may have arisen. Lindsay was most kind to her ; she was happy in her wedded life ; her husband became justly eminent at the bar. That I did not see them often was, I am persuaded, my own fault. If I had been less headstrong and more considerate, Lindsay and I need never have quarrelled. He said so, I am told, whenever he mentioned me, adding that he had long for given me, and would never have suffered me to come to want. He was \u2014 he was very good, d him ! Old fools are babes again. Bard. In the fanciful abode there was a little room \u2014 not unlike that in which I sat and dreamed my dream \u2014 set apart for An Old Fool, when he chose to trouble his friends ; and in this room \u2014 but here, often, the pipe went out, and the dream ended-\u2014 as it was right that it should end, forit was becoming selfish. Yes ; and I suppose that is the reason why all the rest of it came true, after a fashion \u2014 all except that little room, and what it meant to the dreamer. Slowly, as it seemed \u2014 but oh, how swiftly ! \u2014 the time went by ; and the dream seemed coming nearer, steadily nearer."], [26, "16 THE \"FIFE ALLS.\" gone through the floor. Again old Phillibert could hear the wailing of supernatural music, and see the flickering blue flame around the sign of the Five Alls. And now another figure took the place of the King. A tall figure this was, clad in the flowing robes of a priest. Its locks were iron-grey, and its brow was marked with deep lines of care. In a monotonous, but not unpleasant voice, it com menced, without any preamble, the following story :\u2014 The story had deeply interested old Phillibert, who gradually got over his alarm and listened eagerly. When he had finished his story the King held out his sceptre towards Phillibert and said ; \u2014 ' ' Speak not ! Move not 1 This chamber is filled with the spirits of the dead. You have unloosed my tongue, and I can command them to speak to thee !\" With these words the King sank out of sight \u2014 as if he had THE PARSON 'S STORY. How many of us are there who can sum up the history of their lives in two small words ? I can. I have to look back sometimes, as all of us have to do, upon the years that are past. I exhume my dead treasures, which friends imagine have long since decayed, and find them as perfect as ever. On the coffin-lid are written only two words, and while they remain the contents of the reliquary cannot decompose. Will you have the story of my life? Well, here it is. Charles Aylmer ! Those names are the fountain-head from which have sprung sweet and bitter waters. With them are associated the brightest and darkest days I have ever known. They are the pivot upon which all my existence has turned, the pegs on which all my actions have hung. In hours of deepest distress I have cried out in desperation, and said, \"Why was it that I was ever fated to know and love this man ?\" But had I not known and loved Charles Aylmer, my life might have had no story, and the curtain which has fallen over it might have been blacker than it is. Let me lift it up and breathe for a moment's space. was one of my warmest friends, and a constant adviser ; and the conversation soon turned, as I knew it would, upon Charles Aylmer. ' ' You know how these friendships are apt to be misunder stood,\" said the master ; \"but I think I can sufficiently rely upon you to insure good coming out of it in your case. The in terest you seem to take in getting Aylmer in the eleven assures me that you do not seek his society merely as a selfish whim, taking him out of his proper set, and making him idle and con ceited and unpopular. He is now a promising boy, high in the school for his age, at present quite unspoilt, and still a great favourite. If you set to work in the right way, you may do him a vast amount of good. You will think over this, will you not, for it is a serious matter?\" From that day our school friendship ripened, and just be fore I left for Oxford he played in my eleven against the Old Fellows, and got the top score in the first innings. After that I knew that the rest of his career at school would be plain sailing, and I left him behind me in the dear old place with every feeling of satisfaction, gratified with the thought that he was likely to do well and make a name, and pleased that there was so agreeable a tie to bind me still to school while up at Oxford. I must take you back many years \u2014 back past my London curate's life, away from great fields, full of weeds and desola tion, crying out to be cultivated ; away from those pleasant evenings in the company of Joe Armstrong, my college chum and fellow-curate, when, with all the energy and impetuosity of young men, we confided to one another our great plans for work \u2014 strong, hearty, manly, Christian work \u2014 and poured into one another's ears the records of our failures, our fears, our despair. Back again I must go, skipping over Oxford, its friendships, happiness, excitement, its lessons, amusements, wasted time, glory. Come back again with me to my school days, and let me show you where my character for good or evil was formed ; where I was first moulded and taught to think and act for myself ; where for the first time in my life it began to dawn upon me that according to the example I set, so would my school life be a blessing or a curse ; where I was in the sixth form and a prefect, the captain of my school eleven, the leader of a httle army, a mimic monarch, a toy hero, or what you will ; where, God help me, I first saw and loved Charles Aylmer. I remember as if it were yesterday how one evening it sud denly struck me that lor months past I had unconsciously been taking an interest in the pretty, bright-looking boy that sat opposite me in chapel. It was Sunday evening, when the vacant stalls in the chapel were always filled by the towns people, and when the organ, as I thought, seemed to pour forth sweeter sounds, and the choir to sing with grander effect. Charles Aylmer had one of the best voices in the school \u2014 a clear, ringing soprano, which he knew how to use ; and on this evening he sang a solo in the anthem ; \u2014 when the notes of his voice had quite died away, and the pealing organ was dumb, and we all clattered down, burying our faces in our hands, but few of us, I fear, thinking of the prayers we had heard night after night from the same reading-desk \u2014 hearing, all of us, but not listening to the voice that prayed them ; then it was that I knew that for months past I had been watching and thinking of Charles Aylmer. He was below me in the school, too far below me to suggest a friendship in the ordinary course of events. Our paths lay in a somewhat different direction, and it was rather a difficult matter to make them converge. I waited for him that night after chapel, and walked across the court with him, parting at the door of his house \u2014 a custom which never for one evening was interrupted after this until I left school. I invited him to come to my study whenever he liked, and offered to help him in his work, and every day at twelve o'clock I made him come up to the \" first eleven,\" and bowled steadily at him until dinner-time. I knew it would be the making of young Aylmer if I could get him into the eleven ; and despite the little jealousies and unkindnesses which necessarily arose out of my marked attention to the cricketing education of my protigt, I worked hard at it, and never flinched from my object. These school friendships are watched with great care by the masters, and it was not long before I was asked to tea by one of them. He In the early spring of the year 185- (my third at Oxford) I rowed in the winning crew of the trial eights, and some weeks afterwards, to my intense delight, was asked to take the bow oar when the \" 'varsity eight \" took its first paddle down to Iffley, and was told, moreover, to go into strict training. I knew little or nothing of rowing before I went up to Oxford, and to this I chiefly ascribe my luck in getting into the eight. The ' ' unlearning \"in rowing is the terrible business. Once get a bad fault, and it is uncommonly hard to break yourself of it. Not having been at Eton, Westminster, Radley, or Shrewsbury, school did not do much for me in this respect. My initiation into the mysteries of the art was somewhat peculiar. A college chum of mine came into my room one day just before we went down for the \" long,\" and acknowledging him self the owner of some thirty yards of outrageously gorgeous rainbow ribbon, and an out-rigged four-oar, proposed a pot hunting expedition on the Thames. \"We will call ourselves 'The Mandarins,' \" he said, \" and go in for all the junior fours on the river. I can't possibly waste the ribbon. It's rather loud, old fellow, is it not?' It certainly was loud, containing as it did every colour to be seen on a croquet stick, and was so wide that it completely covered the crown of a straw hat. But the captain did not stop at the ribbon. He had the audacity to order a coat of many colours, which our little coxswain was to wear, to say nothing of stockings and a flannel shirt to match. There were strict rules laid down for the observance of members of the club, the principal of which were that training was to be absolutely forbidden, and the more tobacco we smoked the better. It was certainly irritating to local amateurs, who had been training hard and practising over the course for weeks, to see their silver cups and tankards carried off by such an un orthodox crew. We annoyed them by sitting on the bank smoking and criticising their style and \" go \" the night before the race, and then they looked with pitying scorn upon us. But we generally managed somehow or other to beat them the next morning, and then the laugh was, of course, on our side. The expedition was a merry one, enjoyable, and highly successful. Our Mandarin captain, himself in the 'varsity eight, was at great pains in teaching me, and I took to row ing from that time. When we got back to Oxford we found that we were the holders of three challenge cups, and the owners of enough silver and electro-plate to deck out a shop window. From that day to this the approach of the Man darins has been dreaded at local regattas. I can't conceive any nobler position for man than to be one of the Oxford University Eight. It is a splendid privilege to fight for your University with the oar. I'm sure I appreciated it right well. A fellow can't help feeling proud at being one of the picked lot on which the whole University's hope is centred"], [27, "THE PARSON'S STORY\u2014\" I PRAY FOR ALL.\" 17 \u2014 one of the crew which the whole University watches and criticises and turns out to see day by day \u2014 for whose sake old University men come away from rectories and curacies and schools, from London courts of law and dusty chambers, and run along the towing-path shouting encouragement to the \"young uns\" till they can shout no more. The long weeks of training slipped away, and at last came the time when we helped to put our boat on the waggon in Salter's Yard, almost grieving to part with her for the short interval which would elapse before we could meet her again at Putney. It is nervous, anxious work that week at Putney. It is irritating to read the account of the work of the crew in the daily newspapers \u2014 giving false time and inaccurate state ments \u2014 and it's a nuisance to find what implicit faith is placed by the public in these trumpery accounts. Why, men of one's own University turn against us sometimes, and actually back the light blues ! I couldn't have done that if I had known the race was a moral certainty for them. We had just returned from a sharp row over the course one afternoon, and were making our way from the London Rowing Club boat-house to the White Lion, the Oxford quarters, when I heard some horses clattering behind us, and some body shouting out my name. There were two riders, a gen tleman and a lady. There was no mistaking the face of the former. It was Charles Aylmer, the same Charles Aylmer I had known it school, but httle altered since I had left him there, except that he had filled out a bit, and had a more manly appearance. It was not a difficult matter to guess who it was that accompanied him. I had decided the matter long before I was formally introduced to Isobel Aylmer. Would you like me to describe what I thought of her as I saw her there for the first time, sitting on her impatient bay mare, patting its neck and talking to me ? Blue \u2014 yes, dark blue, as to her habit and the ribbons in her hair, and dark blue as to her eyes, pleasant and confidential eyes, which told me we were friends before we had spoken half a dozen words. Her figure \u2014 perfect as I thought. Her hair \u2014 rich brown, and a profusion of it ; wilful hair that played about her face, and strayed from the blue ribbons that bound it. \"I have heard so much about you from Charlie,\" she said, \" that I can hardly believe I have never seen you before. It is very good of you to be in the Oxford crew, because now we shall have an additional interest in the race.\" first,\" he says: \"trust to me, catch it at the beginning, and for heaven's sake don't flurry.\" And now the starter is getting us into position. ' ' A little bit more forward, Oxford.\" \" Half a stroke further back, Cambridge, please.\" We are level now, and are all well forward for the first half-stroke. ' ' Why wont he speak T There it is ! \" Gentlemen, are you ready? Off!\" Dig goes the half-stroke, and then comes the long one, and we are swinging together in an instant. I could hear that Cambridge was forcing the pace. With my eyes firmly fixed on Number Two's back, of course I could see nothing. How they roar and scream as we force the boat along ! The captain heeds none of this : though Cambridge is a length ahead, he keeps us steadily to the same long terrible stroke. Every hundred yards we go, the yelling of the people seems to increase ; and now it becomes so loud, that we feel we are nearing Hammersmith Bridge. Cambridge is under first, but we are greeted with such a roar, that we know we are not far behind. Now the captain for the first time quickens his stroke, the little coxswain cheers us on with a well-known cry, and we come on with a rush. How madly they shout now ! ' ' Well done, Oxford ! Oxford wins ! Ox ford ! Oxford !\" is all we hear. There is a dazzle of light blue blades as we come on, and now inch by inch we draw up, now we are level, now ahead, now safe away. The captain gives us back his old steady stroke again, and we know that, barring accidents, we have won. It was a game race they said, and I think we had a right to be a bit proud as we rowed steadily back to Putney, getting cheered the whole way home. I could think then of Isobel Aylmer, as we shot through Hammersmith Bridge, and I was conceited enough to expect a flattering welcome at Fulham. Such a day as this only occurs once in a man's life you know, and in my triumph I needed no slaves to remind me that I was mortal. I was excited of course \u2014 supremely happy we had won, delighted to get out of training, and I thought Isobel Aylmer the sweetest girl I had ever met. I suppose it was because she had dark blue eyes. The Fulham luncheon was a great success, and I wished the Thames Subscription Club at Jericho for asking us to dinner, and forcing me back to town. ' ' Charlie tells me that you are fond of shooting, and that you will have done with Oxford in the summer,\" said Mr. Aylmer, when we parted. ' ' I shall expect you in September at Heathersett Hall.\" 1 ' Then you back Oxford ?\" \" Of course I do. Look at my colours. Charlie has pro mised to take me to Hammersmith on Saturday to see the race ; and if you can remember anything by the time you get there, you may rely upon the support of a most influential party whose hearts will be with you, but eyes upon you all. So mind and row your best.\" The horses, the bay mare in particular, were getting very impatient. \"I wish we could take you away with us, old boy,\" said Charlie, \"for I have lots to talk about ; but there's that captain of yours looking daggers at us, and evidently in a great state of mind, because you wont come in to take your ration of beefsteaks and old ale. We must be off, or we shall get into disgrace. By-the-by, there's a luncheon-doings on at Fulham after the race, and you're to come if you possibly can. I will wait for you when you get out of your boat.\" \"Oh, do come!\" said Isobel; \"victorious or defeated, you'll be welcome.\" Away they rode, and I went back and got chaffed by the crew. I took mydegree at the end of the summerterm after the race, and was then free to enjoy myself until Christmas, when I had made up my mind to come up to town to help a friend in his parish work, and read for my ordination, which I had fixed for the following Easter. I began my holiday campaign with a tour of cricket matches ; the first place I visited being the old school. It had always been an ambition of mine to take an eleven down to the old place, and as several of the masters were boys there with me, I anticipated rightly that we should have a jolly time of it. The sudden change from a schoolboy into an \"old fellow\" is, of course, most striking. I was just as much of a boy at heart as ever, as might have been guessed from the noise I made wherever I went, but in my new position I was led for the first time behind the scenes. Instead of holding in awe that portion of the court which was overlooked by the common room window, I was actually inside it, sitting with the masters at dinner, hearing them talk \"shop\" to an alarming extent. I often wondered, when at school, whether we were all dis cussed in the common room. I am now in a position to assert, without fear of contradiction, that the intellectual food of public-schoolmasters is found in marks, and their principal amusement consists of retailing the mis takes and sharp sayings of the boys under them. There is no doubt that masters are heart and soul with the boys in work and play, and it is greatly to their credit, I think, that they are never tired of the shop. I could smoke in the court now, and was not obliged to go to moming chapel ; the school bell was no longer terrible, and I had no repetition to learn. It sounded strangely when I was up in H. B.'s rocm, drinking tea and talking over old times, to hear a little fellow come into the room, and say, \"Please, sir, may I sit up a little later to-night? I've been to private tutor, and I don't know my first lesson.\" \"Ah! H. B., old fellow,\" said I, \"we were in the eleven once together, and went up to breakfast at the Savernake Arms, and now times have so changed that I Shall I tell you about the race? I wish I could. No words could describe my thoughts or feelings that day. We got up pretty early, paddled a few hundred yards up the river, practising starts, and breakfasted. Then we had a precious dull time of it, and sat gloomily in our room, watching the cabs, carriages, and people pour into Putney. We were not nervous, or anything of that sort ; but I am sure we all wished it was over. We were right glad, I know, when we were down at the water's edge ; and having shaken hands, as one by one we took our places, with the fine fellows who had given up so much time to teaching us, were soon fairly in our boat and away to the starting-place. The starting is an awful ordeal. Minutes, indeed, seem hours there. , The Cambridge boat has come out and is alongside, and the time has come for mufflers and Straw hats to be off, and to prepare for work. The captain, who happened to be stroke my year, gives his last direction through the coxswain. \"Never mind if they get away from us at"], [28, "18 THE \"FIFE ALLS.\" the society of women a pleasant meal or not? Can nothing be learnt from the repetition of a song which has been praised by one man to one woman, and is it as a matter of course that the song should be sung night after night, no matter what is asked for or insisted on by the company at large? Is it for nothing, and with no meaning, that women finger over the \"good night\" at the top of the big staircase; for nothing that they play all sorts of practical jokes; for nothing they make adventurous sallies into the billiard-room, ending in one more shake of the hand, and one more good night ? What do we learn or gather from all this ? Perhaps, indeed, that it is the nature of women to please, their disposition to flirt. So said, perhaps, many of my fellow-guests whose experience of country houses extended over many visits, and whose experience of women was not the most happy. But what did I learn or gather from it, ignorant as I was of women's ways, and inexperienced in women's wiles? In my helplessness I could but get into bed that night, and trust that I had read my own heart aright, and had not deceived myself, for Isobel Aylmer was dearer to me than life. The programme at Heathersett which I have sketched was occasionally varied. We got up riding excursions and pic nics, and had croquet parties, and long walks on Sunday evenings ; in all of which I had opportunities of learning Isobel's character, and of being more and more convinced of the value of the heart of such a woman. ask the boys up to breakfast, and you give them leave to go\" They crowded round the break, and gave us a good cheer as we drove away from the school gates ; and I'm sure they were sorry to part from the old boys, and knew that the old boys would be glad to come back and play cricket with them again. A few more weeks' cricketing, and I found that July was drawing to a close. On the ist of September I was to begin shooting at Heathersett Hall. The evening had closed in some time when I got to the little station, where I was told I should find Mr. Aylmer's trap waiting to take me on to Heathersett. I can't conceive anything much more melancholy than a railway journey in an empty carriage at the close of an autumn afternoon. No better proof can be given of the tranquil state of my mind at that period of my life than my assertion that not even the damp landscape or the deserted compartment depressed me in the least. I really think I should have liked a grievance at that moment, the occasion was so extremely appropriate. I had a few \"ticks\" left unpaid at Oxford, it is true, but they did not cause me much annoyance. The reminiscence of my school life and Oxford career was pleasant in every way. For the past, then, there was no regret. There seemed very few clouds to darken the future. My earnest wish all through my life was to go into the Church, and my wish was to be gratified. Hitherto I had had no time or opportunity to fall in love, so here again a fruitful source of despondency was denied me. I repeat, then, that I got out of the train at Heathersett station that autumn evening in as healthy a state of mind as a man could wish to be in, and very soon the lodge gates had clanged behind me, and I could see through the dripping trees the lights and red-curtained windows of Heathersett Hall. It is not every woman who would make a good parson's wife; but search the world round, and you would not find such a self-denying, pure-minded woman as Isobel Aylmer. I had fully made up my mind that what I had to say must be said before I left Heathersett, and had quite determined on my plan of action. The world says that a man is dishonourable if he does not open his heart to a woman's father before he lays it down to the woman herself, but I care not one iota for the dicta of the world in such matters. I flatter myself I know fully what the word honour means, and I am satisfied that I sacrificed none of it in my dealings towards Isobel or her parents. You shall see. The curtain was just falling upon the Heathersett domestic drama, and the grand tableau was to be a cricket-match against the neighbouring village. We got up an eleven at the Hall. It was a great day, and the excitement the match created among the ladies was intense. Our side was vic torious, and Charles Aylmer and I kept up the reputation of the old school by getting the highest scores. Isobel was sitting rather apart from the rest of the company; and, after my innings, I went and sat at her feet, and then told her all that was on my mind. The avowal of her love was as simple as it was touching. \"And now about the future,\" I said. \"It would be folly on my part to say anything to your father at present, because, as you know, I am not settled, and shall not be until I am ordained at Easter. Under such circum stances it would not be honourable to bind you in any way whatever. Let there be no engagement at all, but to morrow moming let us part, and see nothing more of one another for a year. In that time we shall surely know if this love of ours is worth anything at all. If it cannot last a year it is not deserving of the name of love. We shall each go our own way, and a year's absence will be a good test. If, during these next twelve months, either of us has reason to change the mind we are now in, much unhappiness may be saved. If we don't, our married Use cannot fail to be bright. And now,\" said I, drawing from my finger a plain gold ring, with one turquoise in it, \"take this, Isobel, will you? If I do not receive it back before this time next year, I shall come down to Heathersett and speak to your father. Mean while, let us think much of one another, and pray that all may turn out well.\" She took my ring from me, and kissing it, put it on, adding that there was no chance of its ever being removed from where it was at that moment. Mr. Aylmer was in look and feeling the type of an English country gentleman. There is no need to add that my wel come was warm and sincere. There were more guests than myself at the hall, besides some relations of the family. My old friend, Charles, was there, and had arrived only on the previous day from London. He was in a Government office now, and had saved up his \"leave\" for the shooting. And Isobel Aylmer was there, looking better, as I thought, in her simple white evening dress, unadorned except by a rich red rose in her bosom, than she had done either in her riding habit or walking attire. I had seen her in all these costumes now. But then, you know, as I said before, my experience of the fair sex up to this time had been very slight, and I was of that age and impressionable nature, as I afterwards dis covered, that to be in the society of a beautiful woman re lated in no way to me, belonging in no way to another, and liable to be captured by my snares if I happened to have any, as much as by the springes of any of the eligible young gentlemen guests that sat round that pleasant drawing-room, was rather too much for my nerves. Anyhow we promised to be a very jolly party. We men did not remain long in the billiard-room that night, as we had to be with the birds betimes in the moming; but, one by one, candle in hand, we went softly along the corridor where the ladies slept, each to his own room, to sleep and dream. I did not do either one or the other for some time, but flung open my bedroom window, and looked out into the clear moonlight. I felt as I had never felt before, and hoped I was not making a fool of myself. Why was it that another petition was added to my prayers, and that I longed for the night to pass ; and, waking early, watched for the dawn of my first moming at Heathersett ? Days repeat themselves at country houses. Shooting all day, broken only by luncheon, with, perhaps, happily a v^sit from the ladies during that most enjoyable repast \u2014 dinner, music, billiards, bed. This programme, though apparently monotonous, has its variations, and from it much harmony may be extracted. Is it impossible to leam anything from women's faces at breakfast-time \u2014 from women's last words before the shooting begins ? Are there no flowers gathered by women \u2014 rich flowers from the con servatory \u2014 to decorate old velveteen shooting-coats ? Is not much difficulty experienced in finding out a shooting party exactly at luncheon-time, in toiling over turnips and ploughed fields to get at it, and do not women overcome these diffi culties, and undergo these fatigues, and get their way ? Do women ever come down the avenue before the dressing-bell rings, and see the rabbits shot, and congratulate the man with the best bag; and is dinner, after a hard day's work, in \" Wont Charlie be pleased when he knows ?\" said she ; \" but even Charlie shall not know our secret yet awhile.\" What a sharp fellow Charlie Aylmer was, to be sure ! \"Why, Cecil, where's your blue ring?\" he said, at dinner. \"You haven't lost it at cricket, have you?\" I felt I was a little confused at the direct question, but got out some excuse. There was certainly a strange inquisitive look in Charles's face, and a glance towards his sister ; but she told me afterwards that she didn't think he really sus pected anything. Isobel sang that night Blumenthal's charm ing song, commencing \u2014"], [29, "THE PARSON'S STORY\u2014\"! PRAY FOR ALL.\" 19 I \" When we are parted let me lie Iii Bome far corner of thy heart ;\" The seniors made up their minds that Mr. Aylmer must be \"taken down a peg,\" and this might have been done by a very quiet and smooth process, soothing to the patient, and not dangerous to his constitution. They treated his case badly, however, and crippled him for life. The cure they adopted was strangulation by red tape, which to an irritable patient is known to be certain death. Old Eraser was selected to operate on him\u2014 a well known and skilful hand at the strangulation process. He quarrelled with Mr. Aylmer's writing, and sent back his reports because an i was not dotted, ora / was uncrossed. He complained of him for being prodigal in his use of official foolscap, and wasteful of departmental sealing wax. Eraser was the best fellow in the world at heart, and was the first to stick up for a man when he got into trouble ; but if one of his boys omitted to put T. o. at the bottom of a sheet of paper when he did turn over. Eraser scarified the offender. Eraser found out Charles's weak point, which was inaccuracy, and worked him up to a pitch of frenzy ; and as all this annoyance came upon Charles just about the time when he had decided that his official prospect was hopeless, he gave the whole thing up in despair, and went to the bad. It is easily done in London. I had just been ordained, and was working away at my first curacy up in the wilds of Islington. Charles had been in the habit of coming up to see me very frequently in the course of the week, and we sat many a long evening together smoking, reading, and talking over old times. I noticed the change that was coming over my friend gradually but surely, I saw that he was restless and irritable, and I fancied that he was not so careful in his dress as he used to be. These are bad signs in a young man, and I feared lest the demon drink should get hold of him, as it has got hold of many in the same unsettled state of mind. I made him confide in me. He told me he had been out of sorts of late, and mixing with careless companions, the end of whose career is merely a matter of so many months. He had been reckless and extra vagant, and was heavily in debt. He had applied to his father for assistance too frequently, and could not ask him again just yet. I lent him some money that evening, and this seemed to take a load off his mind, and he went away looking better than I had seen him for some time. I could not see Isobel's brother and my old friend go to the dogs, you know, and as long as I had money and could help him I determined I would do so, provided, of course, I saw that I was really studying his interest. A far longer time than usual elapsed without my seeing him. I wrote and asked him to come and see me ; but I received no reply. I got up a little party of old friends to meet him, and he promised to ' ' turn up ;\" but at the last moment he sent an excuse. Incidentally I heard that he was being pestered at the office with visits from greasy-looking men in suits of greenish black, armed with short sticks, coarse of face, and loud and impatient of tone; and it was whispered that his name was mixed up with bill transactions, and that he was keeping out of the way. I never thought matters were so bad as this. Still I hoped he would come to me. which I thought dangerous, particularly as her voice faltered every now and then ; but they were playing a round game in the next room, and were not alive to sentiment. The next morning we really were parted, and my year's transportation began. It was a thomsand pities that Charles Aylmer was not sent to Oxford. It would have been the making of the poor fellow, and might have entirely altered the course of his Use, which did not always flow through very smooth channels. Charles's father was, however, led into the temptation that has dazzled many a father before him, and which he, a comparatively wealthy man, could not resist. When Charlie was about eighteen, and before he had left school, Lord Alban, of Broad lands, happened to be presiding over the famous Docket and Precis Office, and, being an old college friend of Mr. Aylmer, offered his son a nomination to compete with some half-dozen others for a vacant clerkship. It is a tempting bait, you know, to get a son, /who is. after all, a very expensive luxury, off your hands when his public-school education is over \u2014 I wont say when his education is complete, for the popular theory that a boy's education is completed when he leaves school is absurd. Destine a boy for the clerical, military, legal, or medical profession, and you will have calls on your purse for years after he has left school ; train him up to be a man of business, or for any vocation in life, in fact, except the civil service, and it will be the same story. That delusive imme diate prospect of 90/. a year, paid quarterly, leads father and son alike by the nose. It certainly was too much for the Aylmers, pere et JUs. The father recommended Charles to take the appointment just till something better turned up ; the son, liking the thoughts of independence, went in for the competition, and won ; and it is needless to add that from that moment his friends, considering him a lucky fellow and provided for for hfe, never gave him another thought. The moral of all this is, that at the time at which I have now arrived, my friend Charles, who for the last six weary years had been plodding on, doing what work was required of him between the hours of ten and four, found himself in re ceipt of the gorgeous salary of 150/. a year, still in the very lowest class ; and not only in the lowest class, but with some hundred young and active men above him, all eligible for promotion before his turn came. This was a lively prospect, or rather, want of prospect, for Master Charles, certainly ; and now, at the end of his six years, he began to lose all heart, and to get idle, and careless, and worthless. He reasoned the matter out calmly and deliberately with himself. Were he to toil, work extra time, come early, stay late, and do prodigies of valour in the way of industry, he could not pos sibly kill these hundred men who were over his head. He might possibly pass over half a dozen of them, but not one more. There was a dead block in the Docket and Precis Office : the staff appointments and senior clerkships were filled with young men ; there was no promotion, no excitement, no hope whatever for the juniors ; and so the hearts of the juniors died within them, and many of them, like Charles Aylmer, got idle ; and the idleness which lost them the re spect of the seniors in the office unsettled them when they were out of it, and got them into scrapes, and debt, and troubles of all kinds. I was sent for at last to a dingy street out of Chancery lane. He was dreadfully cut up, and promised, on his word of honour, that he would not ask me for assistance again. He would be clear soon, he said. Again I thought of Isobel, and again \\ remembered our old school-days together. I put myself under obligation to my own re lations, and borrowed money to rescue him from the vile hole in which he was imprisoned, and then I told him frankly and distinctly that I could do no more for him. I was helping him with other people's money as it was, but it was for the last time. Weeks passed away, and I heard and saw nothing of Charles. I was annoyed at this treatment after all I had done, and felt that I had forgiven him and helped him too much already. At last, one evening he came to my lodgings, look ing more disreputable than ever. It was the old story. I refused point blank to help him any more. I had never seen him look so wild and desperate as he did that night. He said it was only a ten-pound note he wanted, sailing which he would be again arrested, and most probably dismissed from the office. Still I firmly refused. He got up from the chair in which he was sitting, and pushing it aside, strode excitedly two or three times up and down the room. At last he stopped before me, and said, \u2014 \"Cecil, have you got the money in the house? I know you wont tell me a lie.\" It was not always like this with Charles Aylmer. Six years before, when he had been asked to report himself at the Docket and Preeis Office, and was laughingly told, on being introduced into the room in which he was to sit, that \" there he would be buried alive,\" he was fresh from school, and full of life, and energy, and pluck, and thought that the gloomy prophecy of his guide would not be verified. He did what was given him to do bravely, conscientiously, and well, and gave huge delight to the conventional idlers, who were not ashamed to see themselves gradually stripped of their work, to be made into a new garment for their energetic junior. In the Docket and Precis Office a certain amount of business had to be done day by day, and the share of those who never could be got to do anything fell to the lot of those who would work. Charles Aylmer learnt his business quickly ; but unfortunately, his success as a very junior clerk indeed helped to work out his ruin. He tried to do too much, and in his mad and mistaken endeavour to \"make himself felt,\" he was placed most ignominiously on his back."], [30, "THE \"FIFE ALLS.\" 20 I add, was an eminent financier; but it was rather \"hard lines\" for his friend the boot-maker, whom he wanted co assist, for Charles Aylmer was declared a bankrupt, with no assets whatever. Before I returned to England, Charles Aylmer was on his way to New Zealand in an emigrant vessel. When I arrived in London, I had a very strong impression that Mr. Avlmer and his family would be in town for the season. Had I been asked to choose a torture at that moment, I could not have selected one more exquisitely painful than to meet Isobel Aylmer face to face ; and yet such is the per versity of human nature, instead of doing my best to avoid such a meeting, I actually courted it. I knew what I should suffer, and yet I continually found myself in the places to which she would in all probability resort. There was a dash of bravado in all this, I dare say. Although this woman, as I thought then, had behaved to me as badly as a woman well could, I still loved her. What fools men are ! And loving her as deeply as I did, the inclination was strong upon me to meet her, and stare at her vacantly as though we had never met. \" I will make this woman believe that I despise her,\" I thought; \"and though the punishment will be death to me, I will wound her pride. No woman can endure that without flinching.\" I met her at last. I was walking, in the afternoon of my last day in town, in the park with a friend. We chose the path which skirts Rotten Row under the trees, and in the distance I saw her coming. She was walking with a gentleman, whose face I did not recognise. A most disagreeable, sickly feeling came over me in an instant ; but on I went, pretending to laugh with my friend as I walked. She blushed deeply when she saw me coming, but soon turned very pale. I could not help fancying that as we passed she bowed. Anyhow, I took not the smallest notice, and never removed my eyes from her face. I did not appear surprised, I am sure. If my countenance moved at all, it was only with a little contemptuous curl of the lip. This was cowardly, I knew ; and if I did sneer, I have suffered suffi ciently for it since. My friend never knew what a little drama was being played in that minute by his side. We passed on, and I saw her no more. \"Yes, Charlie,\" I answered. \"I have got eleven pounds in my desk.\" \" Then you had better lend it me.\" \" I have told you, Charlie, that I cannot ; and I will keep to my word.\" \"By God, then, you shall lend it me ; for I will tell you a secret which you would pawn your coat to buy. Will you hear it?\" ' ' I don't want to purchase any secret that has been con fided to you.\" \" It is about Isobel, my sister.\" I gave a sudden start, and he knew that his shot had taken effect. \" Do you think I am blind ?\" he said. \"Do you think I shut my eyes and slept all the time that you were down with us at Heathersett, and that I was ignorant of what took place then? I may be very quiet, Cecil, but I am not a fool ! I tell you, man, that I know something about my sister which you would give the best part of your life to hear ; something which you must hear ; something which I will tell you. Will you lend me the money?\" I was powerless now, and mechanically I went to the desk, unlocked it, and threw the notes on the table. He fingered them greedily, and thrust them into his pocket. \"Cecil Brandon,\" he said, \"my sister can never be your wife. Before you spoke to her of love, she was engaged to another man, a man to whom she has been attached all her life, and to whom she will be married next year. They had had a quarrel just before you came down, and, out of pique, she so far forgot herself as to mislead you, and treat you in this shameful manner. Believe me, she is sorry for what she has done. \" \" Charles ! I cannot believe this of your sister. She must tell it me herself.\" \"That she cannot do. Is there no sign by which you will believe my story ? \" ' ' No sign !\" I said, not quite understanding what he meant. I reflected for a moment. \"Yes, there is one sign,\" I said. \" Is this sufficient, then ?\" and he threw upon the table a gold ring set with one turquoise. \"Quite, quite sufficient,\" I said. \"Oh, Charlie boy, if you only knew how I loved your sister !\" He left me ; but I sat there in the same place long after the candles had died out. The room was dark and cold, and the grey cheerless morning stole into the room, and found me still sitting there where he left me, not quite such a man as I was before, for my heart was gone. ******* I must now ask you to let me pass over three dull and uninteresting years of my life, the monotony of which was alone broken by my being presented to a small living in Wiltshire. I beg pardon ; there was an event which happened in the course of those three years' which may be considered inte resting. I got married. My wife was my senior by some few years. She had been a beauty in her time, and her experience of men and men's ways was great. She had seen so much love-making, that I really believe she was heartily sick of it ; and, to tell the truth, our courtship was a very prosaic affair. I am bound to say, a more domesticated or affectionate woman it would be difficult to find. Her heart and soul were in the parish ; she was a great hand at plum cake ; and the coal club, village library, and district visiting society, under her able administration, were very flourishing institutions. The sudden shock to my nervous system, caused by Charlie's unexpected revelation, brought on a serious illness. I tried to conquer my grief by working in my parish harder than ever, and though but little comfort came to my heart, I devoted my time to those who \"laboured and were heavy laden,\" trying to learn by their example how to bear pain un selfishly and nobly. I rather overdid the hard work, and had to succumb to a miserable low fever, which took all my strength away, and compelled me to leave London and give up my curacy. I was lucky enough to get a travelling tutor ship to a young fellow in ill-heakh. We wintered '\u25a0. :'ome, and in the early spring went on to Naples, g. - g 1 .ck to England just at the commencement of the Lc on. My doctors forbade my taking another London bi icy, and so my next move was to go and help an old coSeg friend, who had been presented with a living in Somersetshire. I had to pass through London on my way to the country, and determined to remain there for a day or two, in order tc good-bye to a few old chums before I went into exile The doors of the Docket and Precis Office had been closed at last against Charlie Aylmer. One of his creditors, a fa able boot-maker at the West-end, had made boots so noble feet of Lord Alban of Broadla.ids, who, as I have you before, presided over Charlie's office. The boot-ma. irritated at Charlie's unpunctuality, wrote to his lordship a complained, and his lordship was actually undignified enoug to take the matter up, officially, and call for an explanation from Mr. Aylmer. This was the spark which ignited the bonfire ; and when his lordship had fully satisfied himself that Mr. Aylmer was in serious difficulties, he dismissed him from the office, logically arguing that the best way of extri cating an embarrassed man from monetary troubles is to deprive him of salary altogether. This was no doubt a shrewd move on the part of his lordship, who, I need hardly I had been married just two years, when I received a letter which set my heart, that had grown torpid and inactive of late, in a flutter. I am sure my good wife shared my excite ment, for, of course, I had hidden nothing from her. This letter was from Mrs. Aylmer, of all people in the world, who, I had imagined, had forgotten all about me long ago. It ran as follows : \u2014 \"My dear Mr. Brandon,\u2014 By the aid of a clergy list I hope we have found you out, but if you will go and bury yourself alive in an obscure Wiltshire village, only appearing above the world's surface and letting us know ol your exist ence when you announce your marriage to the world, what are your old friends to do? You will be surprised to hear from me, and still more astonished, perhaps, when you learn the object of this letter. You see the very excellent example you have set has been \u2014 or rather, I should say, is going to be nved. My daughter Isobel\u2014 you remember Isobel, for, nemory does not deceive me, she was at home when y ai pa.dusyour only visit to Heathersett, you naughty man\u2014 \u25a0 engaged to be married, and the happy event ha? been fixed >t month. It is an excellent match, und we are all very 1 ibout it. She has expressed a very strong desire to be \"tied ni,\" as poor Charlie would have expressed it by my deal I i 's oldest and kindest friend. What do y m say thei .jou encourage this delicate little bit of sentiment"], [31, "THE SOLDIER'S STORY\u2014\" I FIGHT FOR ALL.\" 21 on the part of my daughter, and oblige us all at Heathersett with a glimpse of your face again ? ' ' Yours very sincerely, \"Alice Aylmer.\" band stayed behind. Old men may be able to make love but they are not energetic after dinner. It was the night before her wedding, and I walked with Isobel Aylmer. We had not spoken together alone since the night before I left Heathersett. \"Will you let me look at your hand?\" I said. \"Whose ring is that?\" \" Whose ring? I should think you ought to know, for you put it where it is yourself. I was wrong not to return it, I know, but I could not. It would have seemed as if I wished to change my mind, and God knows I never did \u2014 not even after your long, long silence\u2014 not after your cruel treatment in London. Of course, when you were married it was different ; but it is all over now. Please let me keep the nng.\" The terrible truth dawned upon me now for the first time, and from her lips, and on her wedding-eve ! I heard how she had been true and Charlie false to me. There was no going back now. Fate's cords were bound so tightly round us that no power on earth could sever them. It was an awful hour that last we spent together ; so hideously sweet, indeed, that even now it cuts me to the heart to recall it. \"We must never meet again,\" I said. \"I have a man's strength, but I can bear no more.\" \"We may meet again, Cecil,\" she whispered, \"but not here. Pray God that it may be so. \" We parted that night as if one of us were doomed to die on the morrow. It was the death of our love that we mourned, and after that night we dug a deep grave and buried it away out of sight, thinking over it, in the years that followed, silently and with bitter tears. On the next day I married them in the old church in which we had prayed for one another for the first time. My hands trembled a little when I joined theirs. \"What God has joined together, let no man put asunder.\" Those were the words I proclaimed in a loud voice ; and then, when the sounds of my voice had echoed through the church for the last time, and the exhortation was over, and when the organ was dumb, and the strains of the \" Wedding March \" had died away, the old church was left empty and deserted, and my cup of sorrow was drained to the dregs. When my wife had read the letter, she came across the room to where I was sitting, and kissing my sorehead, said, \u2014 \"You will go, Cecil, of course. The poor girl is sorry for having pained you, and cannot, I am sure, ask your forgive ness in a nicer way.\" \"You are right, quite right,\" I said. \"I think it is my duty to go.\" Again I was deposited on the platform of the nearest rail way station to Heathersett Hall ; but it was summer-time now, and when I drove up the avenue and came in sight of the house, I noticed that they were all on the circular croquet lawn. Isobel Aylmer was much altered. Like all of us, she had \u2022 'sobered down, \" as they call it, and lost the bright girlishness of manner for which in old days she had been so much praised and blamed. I was introduced to her future husband, a tall, gentlemanly man, whose hair\u2014 he had not very much left! poor fellow\u2014 was rapidly turning grey. It was close upon dinner-time, and I had only an oppor tunity of speaking a few words to Isobel before we went up stairs to dress. I noticed, however, directly I looked at her, that the same mysterious bond of union between us was in force. There was not much electricity left in the battery, I dare say, but it was possible to read a message every now and then, though the current was faint. You must know what I mean. I never did, and never could, feel awkward with Isobel Aylmer, and yet there are many people in whose society I am perfectly dumb, restrained, and foolish. I sat at dinner on Mrs. Aylmer's left hand. Isobel was next to me, her future husband being on the other side. We were talking about old times, and Mr. Aylmer was giving, with great gusto, an account of our celebrated Heathersett cricket-match, and telling them how Charlie and I stayed in and pulled the match out of the fire. I could not resist look ing at Isobel, for the day to which they were alluding was full of strange memories. From her face my eyes travelled to her hand, which rested on the table-cloth. There were rings on several of her fingers. On one finger alone my eyes were riveted. As the last words of the priest echoed through the room, the figure disappeared. The unearthly music moaned once more in the stillness of the night, and presently the moonbeams shone mistily on a figure in soldierly garb. Its fierce face was scarred and seamed with wounds, and its fretful hand toyed with the hilt of the sword that hung at its side. It told its story with a deep, husky voice, and with a soldierly decision. It was decorated with a plain gold ring, set with one tur quoise. Dinner dragged on drearily now, for I listened to no more conversation. I saw nothing, heard nothing. My thoughts were too engrossing. I said it was summer-time, and after dinner we all went out for a stroll in the cool of the evening. Isobel's future hus- THE SOLDIER 'S STORY. I WAS always fond of fighting. I don't know why, but I was. I'm told that I used to fight in my cradle, and on my mother's lap. My mother wore curls, and I used to fight one particular ringlet, because it hid her face from me. My mother considered this a remarkable proof of my affection, and the more I hurt her, the prouder she was of me. I can remember her face, \u2014 though I am an old man, and she died when I was young \u2014 her large dark eyes, and her look. Perhaps I shall see her again. The chaplain used to promise so. Well, if I see her, I shall know her \u2014 anywhere. I was an only child. I have said that I lost my mother young. Perhaps, had she lived, I should not have had so much fighting ; perhaps I should never have been a soldier \u2014 not that I regret it. I would not have been anything but a soldier for the world. me to a barn, where there was no parson, but a lot of the people in the village got up and spoke and sung just as they pleased ; and they said a great deal about regeneration. The word fixed itself in my mind, because it was a long word ; and I remember that when my father and mother quarrelled that night, he called her unregenerate. I can remember the day as well as if it were yesterday, for as we were walking home, my father said to me, \u2014 \"Johnny\" \u2014 my name, like his, was John Lamplough \u2014 \"Johnny, don't ee like t'sarvice we heerd to-day i' t' bam better nor t'sarvice i' t' church ?\" \"No,\" I answered ; and he fetched me such a clout of the head as made it sting again. When mother died, father drank harder than ever, and said he was converted. He didn't go into the fields with the men to work, as he had been used to do ; but three times a week he had what he called gatherings of the fold in the wilderness ; and about twenty men and women used to come and eat and drink, and sing psalms that they made up them selves out of their own heads as they went on. I used to be in my bed upstairs, and listen to them, and wonder how they could eat and drink and sing so late. The victuals and drink were provided by father. Father paid for all ! I wasn't comfortable at home. The regenerate made it un pleasant to me, particularly one old woman, who was always filling father's glass. I hated her. Her name was Murga troyd, and she squinted fit to break her neck. I was taken from school, and went out to work with the men. Father used to thrash me often, and severely, with a stick, for the purpose of making me regenerate. The parson came and My father was a small farmer in Yorkshire. The nearest village to our farm was called \" Sneedholme.\" It was a very small village, and contained nineteen houses \u2014 two of them were public-houses, the King's Arms, and the Royal Oak. My father was reckoned one of the strongest men in the county, and I took after him ; and the first time I fought was at dame's school \u2014 I forget what about ; but I know that I licked the other boy, which is pleasant to remember. When I was eight years old, I lost my mother. I recollect that she and my father were not very happy, for she was a fight hearted, high-spirited woman, fond of fun and frolic, and he was always grave and moody, as if he were studying. He was often drunk ; and they used to quarrel. One terrible quarrel I can remember the cause of. It was in the hay harvest, and instead of taking me to church, my father took p"], [32, "THE \"FIFE ALLS.' 22 tered Paris, Taddy and I being men of good conduct were quartered on an old French general named Chaubert who. lived at Passy. The Prussians behaved so badly during the occupation, that I and Taddy were among 'hose of the English army who had an order signed by Wellington and Blucher to protect the inhabitants. Every, night alter daik the Prussians would sally out and commit great outrages. They said it was no more than the French did when they were in Prussia. That was nothing to us. I only mention it to show that Taddy and I were considered officers rather than private soldiers, which may account for General Chau bert making us dine at his table. I objected at first, for I could speak French and Spanish pretty tolerably. I pointed out to him that he was an officer, and we were only soldiers, and that we knew our place, which here let me say few people do who are not in the army. But he made a great fuss, and said that in the eyes of brave men all brave men were equals, and that he considered it an honour to have under his root two gentlemen ; so he said, upon my word, who understood the courtesy due to a vanquished enemy, as well as the loyalty they owed to their own drapeau. So Taddy and I dined with the General nearly every day, and were treated with great respect by the servants, who believed we were officers of high rank, and who hated us like poison. Now, this General Chaubert had a daughter, named Artemise. She, like me, was an only child ; but uDhke me, she was highly educated and accomplished. Unlike me, too, she was clever. I think she could play upon every instru ment in the world, and could talk all languages except ing English. She made me teach her English. She was a different style of beauty from my poor Prudence. Prudence was tall, and fair-haired and blue-eyed, and mild, and re minded you of a May morning in England. Artemise was small and black-haired ; you could see her restless eyes in the dark. She had southern blood in her, and reminded you of a September night in Spain when a storm was coming. She could soon get into a passion, could Artemise, and then she would quiver like an aspen, and keep on quivering till she got her own way. I can't remember how it happened, but we\u2014 that is, Artemise and I\u2014 fell in love with each other. I think that Artemise mentioned it to me first, for I shouldn't have had the courage to make up to her. She used to frighten me, she was so terribly in earnest. She told me that when I left Paris she would leave with me. When I told her that I was forced to obey orders, and my captain and colonel, and the rules and regulations of the service, she said she didn't care for orders, or the captain or the colonel, or the rules and regulations of the service ; but that where I went she'd go\u2014 or die. Then she would begin to cry, and quote the Bible. I remember that I used to think that Taddy was in love with her a little, but I am so stupid \u2014 being only fit to fight that I never noticed it to myself, or, as it were, told myself of it, until one night when I was riding back from Paris, and I was nearing the General's house, which stood quite by itself, a shot was fired at me. I ducked and pulled up my horse's head, and the bullet passed over me. I spurred my charger to the spot where I thought the shot came from, but I could see nothing. I drew my sabre and trotted slowly to the stable. I dismounted at the gate, and as I was crossing the court-yard, the bridle over my arm, I met Taddy. The thought flashed across me : I stopped him and said, ' ' Taddy, it was you who fired at me !\" \" No, I didn't !\" he said, in a moment, which proved to me that he was guilty. \" How did you know I'd been fired at?\" I asked. \" I didn't know it,\" he answered. \"Yes, you did,\" I said, seizing him by the throat. \" Where is your carbine?\" He gasped out something. I don't know what. \"Where is it?\" I asked again, squeezing him tighter. I then remembered that his carbine was hung up in the room where he slept, and I said \u2014 \" March before me to your quarters, or I'll cut you down as you stand !\" Taddy went upstairs without saying a word. I took down his carbine from the nail ; it had been just fired. \"Taddy,\" I said to him, \" this was not the act of a com rade. You're no soldier to have done it. You're no friend 1 spoke to him about it ; but father called him names, and ordered him off the farm. It was all the fault of that old Mother Murgatroyd. She is dead now, but I hate her all the same. When I was about sixteen\u2014 old Mother Murgatroyd was father's housekeeper then \u2014 we used to have frightful rows, and I used to get so savage that I fought eveiy one, in the village and about, who would fight me. I always came off conqueror, except once, and that was when Bill Tredegarth, the miller's son, thrashed me. He was three years older than me, and he gave me a good thrashing. When I got home, father thrashed me for being thrashed. I must say for the old man that he was always proud of my pluck, and was game himself to the last. About this time Mother Murga troyd took down my mother's picture from over the mantel piece. It was done in black, on a white ground. I wouldn't let her take it down, and she struck me with the butt-end of a cart-whip. I didn't mind that ; but while we were scuf fling, she called my mother a name. I didn't mean to push her so hard, but the next moment she was on the floor. The village folk said that Fighting Jack had fought her. If I had, I fought for my mother. There was no more home for me, for between laudanum and brandv and Mother Murgatroyd and regeneration, my father was' like one crazed. I went into the service of a farmer, of the name of Savage, about a mile from my own home. It was then I fell in love with Prudence Tyson, the daughter of the man who kept the Royal Oak. I didn't know what was the matter with me \u2014 only I couldn't keep away from the Oak ; and I cared for nothing but talking to Prudence. In time she got to like me, and we used to wan- der over the fields together, till the boys in the village got to hear of it, and followed us, and jeered us. Then I nearly broke one boy's jaw ; and after that, we were left alone. Prudence's father rather favoured me ; for he knew that my father's land was his own, and must come to me. One night I saw Bill Tredegarth, whom I had long suspected of want- ing to make up to Prudence, give her a fairing he'd brought from York. So I left the Oak when Bill did, and we had it out by ourselves in the moonlight. I had to carry Bill home, and he was in bed for a week. I fought for my sweet- heart ! But it was fated that neither Bill nor I was to have her, for she took the fever and died. Bill and I went to the funeral \u2014 the whole village was there, for everybody loved her. I felt I should like to have died too; and the girls all tried to comfort me ; but it was no use. Sneedholme was no longer for me. I called at the farm, got a farewell screech from Mother Murgatroyd, and a parting growl from my father, and started for York. I got there on June the 16th, 1805 ; I spent all my money ; I was drunk for a week ; and on the 24th, I was a recruit in the th Dragoon Guards. I liked soldiering. There was a horse, and a uniform and accoutrements. One soldier's life is pretty much like another's, so I wont dwell on that. I fought through the Peninsula \u2014 but so many books have been written about that, that I'll skip over my adventures there, and only say that I enjoyed battle as if it were a fox-chase. When the bugle sounded, and I was tightly girthed, I thought of poor Prudence and felt no fear. It was grand to feel my horse bounding under me, and to protect it and myself from the three or four enemies nearest to me ; then, at the sound of another bugle, by a twist of the bridle rein to leave them, and to find myself fighting three or four others, but always to keep with my own troop, advance or retire, and to charge with them again \u2014 not that we had much chance of that. The French cavalry had orders not to meet our heavy cavalry. We used to ride them down by sheer weight. Some of the enemy were fine fellows, others were mere raw lads ; the officers were splendid. Whatever they took their men into, they took them out of. I fought for my king and country. There were many pleasures in the campaign, and there were many pains. Months and months together I have put my bare feet into the stirrups. Often my charger had to eat leaves, and so had I. Our colonel was kind, but the major was a brute. I had a good comrade, a Devonshire man. His name was Taddy. He was four years older than I was. He was very much attached to me, and I was to him. I saved his life at Talavera from four cuirassiers ; and after that we were hardly ever apart. His cup was my cup ; my rations, when we had any, were his. We rode side by side, and in an engagement we looked after each other. I sought for my friend. But that wasn't to last long. When the allied armies en- I forgive you, but if you mention a word to her \u2014 to frighten her \u2014 or breathe a syllable to the General, I'll fell you dead as a bullock. You're a blackguard !\" So I left him sobbing out, \" I didn't do it, John \u2014 indeed I didn't '.\""], [33, "THE SOLDIER'S STORY\u2014\" I FIGHT FOR ALL.\" 23 I didn't speak to Taddy for two or three days, but he seemed to be so sorry, and I thought that perhaps he had fired in a moment of excitement, or when he was drunk, and then I remembered that I had .saved his hfe, and so I spoke to him, and we were as good friends as ever. He was rather more disposed to give in to me than before he shot at me, and I must do him the justice to say that he never said a word to the General about Miss Artemise and me. The poor old gentleman found it out himself somehow. I suspected that a servant girl, called Mariette\u2014 who used to throw her great black eyes at me\u2014 told her master, because I wouldn't take notice of her. We were standing in a sort of balcony one evening, Artemise and I, watching the sun setting over Paris\u2014 the General came into the room suddenly. \"Artemise,\" said he sharply, \"go into your own chamber !\" Artemise left the room. I knew what was coming. The General locked the door, came up to me, and said in French \u2014 \"I know all ! It is unworthy of a gallant man to make love to a child. He should speak first to her father. \u2014 to her family. You are not a gallant man. You are a disgrace to the uniform you carry\u2014 which is noble. I made you free of my house. You take away my child's affections \u2014 my daughter, who is a lady. Leave my house. You shall not sleep in it to-night. I have spoken to your captain. You will be fetched away to-morrow. If you were of my own rank, my own arm should avenge me. As it is, go.\" There was a violent rapping at the door, and I heard Artemise's voice say on the other side of it, ' ' My father, he shall not go. He must not. I will not that he goes. It will kill me ! My big, fine John 1 Without him I shall die !\" The General went out of the room, and I could hear the two of them scuffling upstairs, and Artemise's voice crying out to me. I felt a great sneak. I slept in the stable that night \u2014 at least, I didn't sleep, but Taddy sat up with me. He told me that Mariette was the cause of it ; that she was jealous of her young mistress, and had made all the mischief, and that she was in high feather \u2014 the cruel wretch ! Next morning Taddy and I were relieved, that is, two other men \u2014 Hampton and Sowerby \u2014 took our places at the General's, and when I was outside the gate, in the saddle, Artemise came out \u2014 how she got from her chamber I don't know \u2014 and put her arms round my knees and wouldn't let go, and stayed there before the Lieutenant and half the troop. Her father took her away at last. I shall never forget his face, poor old gentleman, nor hers. I got a fine rating from the Captain. \" Lamplough,\" he said to me, \" I thought you were a steady man. You've de- ceived me. Since we've been here I've had nothing but trouble about girls. I thought you would know better. I think you're all mad \u2014 and the girls too. The Colonel's in a great rage, and makes most unpleasant remarks about the troop. I wish you wouldn't.\" We were ordered home shortly after. I got a furlough, and went down into Yorkshire. I went to Sneedholme, and I walked into the farm. Father was upstairs in the bedroom. He was quite daft, bedridden, and dying. It was about eight o'clock at night. Mother Murgatroyd was as tipsy as she could be, and she and a youngish man I had not seen before, but whom I took a dislike to from seeing Mother Murgatroyd fill his glass up, as she used to fill father's, were groaning out something, and father kept a-gasping. The young man's name was Podd. I am not much of a reader, but I have read the \" Pickwick Club,\" and I think it is the best book that ever was written. Well, the writer of \" Pick wick \" must have seen that fellow Podd, for he was in looks, talk, manner, and everything else, exactly like Mr. Stiggins. So when I went in father didn't know me, and Mother Mugg said I was a prodigal returned, and hoped that I didn't want to sleep there, as my bed was made up for blessed Mr. Podd. \"So will I,\" said she. \"Young man,\" began Mr. Podd. \" Hold your tongue, Podd,\" I shouted\u2014 I could stand the old woman, but not the man\u2014 \"and good night, Podd, and take my advice and go, for it's getting late, and you mayn't get a bed, cut be compelled to sleep in an out-house.\" Well, Podd went away muttering a text savagely. I brought my bed into my father's room and lay down on it, and when old Mother Mugg had gone I wept bitterly. I tried to make father recognise me next day, but I could not. I told him who I was \u2014 I talked to him about mother\u2014 but he didn't seem to hear. He knew old Mother Mugg, though, when she fed him with gruel and brandy. I stopped \\vith' him the whole day. Mr. Podd called, but I wouldn't let him in, and Mrs. Mugg handed him drink through the window. The next day father woke up about noon, and looked about him. I went up to the bedside and took his hand. I told him I was his boy, just come back from the wars. A look came over his face, and the hand I held in mine shook as with an ague. His eyes lighted up and he remembered me. \"Jack \u2014 Jack,\" he sobbed out, \" my boy \u2014 my own boy \u2014 yes\u2014 yes \u2014 yes\u2014 my poor boy. They frighten me, Jack\u2014 they frighten me. My poor boy\u2014 my Jack. I shall get better. Jack, and then they shall see. Kiss me, my great big boy, Jack. I'm sorry, my boy, but, never mind\u2014 when I'm better \u2014 when I'm better\" Here Mother Mugg brought some medicine\u2014 and the old man never spoke again. He died next day. We buried him, and his last will and testament was read. He had left all away from me. The will was dated three years before his death\u2014 and left half he had to Mother Murgatroyd, and the other half to build a place for Mr. Podd to hold forth in, which was to be called the Regenerate Fold. I was advised to contest the will, and I did. I sought for my birthright. It was while I was consulting with the lawyer who came from York for the purpose that one of the labourers came to the house and said : \u2014 \"Mister John, there's a lady give me a shillin' to gi' vou this.\" It was a piece of paper with this written on it : \u2014 \"John Lamplough, \u2014 th Dragoon Guards, Sneedholme, Yorkshire.\" I couldn't make it out. \"What lady ?\" I asked. \" I dunno', sir,\" said the man, \" I can't make out a word she says.\" \"Where is she?\" \"Just outside.\" I followed him to the door, and there stood Artemise ! \"My friend,\" she said, in her beautiful French voice, \"I have come to you. I could not stay from you. I told you that I would come to you \u2014 or die. I could not die, so I came to you !\" She told me afterwards how she found me. My address she knew, for I had told her all about myself when we were at Passy. She had sold her jewels, run away from home, embarked for London, and come down by the mail to York. I was wonder-stricken. ' ' But, \" I said, ' ' how could you get here from London ? Did you come alone?\" \"Yes.\" I took her in the house and asked the lawyer his advice. He gave it me at once, and accordingly, I took her to the house of the Rector, and arranged tor her to stop with him until he heard from General Chaubert, to whom he wrote off at once. In a fortnight we got an answer to say that General Chaubert would be at the Belle Sauvage, in London, on a certain day, and he requested us to meet him there. So the Rector, and Artemise, and I set off for York, and then took the mail for London. \"Mrs. Mugg,\" I said, \" father's gone childish, and I'm his only relative. I haven't seen him for years. I'm his son, and his only one, and I don't sleep anywhere but under his and my own roof-tree for man or woman. I rest in my own bed this night. As for blessed Mr. Podd, blessed Mr. Podd must turn out and get a bed at the Oak, or wherever else he pleases.\" \"You're not master here. You're not master here !\" said the old woman. It was a strange meeting. When the General saw the Rector he thanked him in French, of which the Rector did not understand a word, and he kissed him \u2014 which the Rector considered a liberty, and he asked him to bless him, which the Rector didn't do, perhaps because he didn't know how. He (the General) shook me by the hand. He took no notice of Artemise, and then he sat down and cried. It was a very strange meeting. There was a general and a private soldier, who had sought against each other; a Protestant clergyman, and two Catholics ; a runaway \"Yes, I am, Mrs. Mugg,\" I said, \"and mean to be till I see that I am dispossessed. I'll have a lawyer here to morrow.\" C 2"], [34, "THE \"FIFE ALLS.\" 24 that what cut him most was that his daughter should have married an Englishman, which he looked on as a disgrace. I need not say that the only fault I found with the aftair was that Artemise was French. Taddy visited us now and then, and was too delicate ever to refer to that little matter of the carbine, but then he had always had great good taste. We had three children. My eldest boy is in India, my second died when he was an infant, and my daughter is married, and lives two streets off. Artemise left this world five years ago. My fighting-days are over, and my march is ended. I have much to answer for when the trumpet is sounded, and must trust in the mercy of the Great Com mander. __^__ daughter, and an angry father ; two French, two English, all on different sides, and nobody could speak on account of the difference of language. The General said the Priest was a noble heart, and that I was brave heart, and that he would take Artemise back to Paris. But Artemise said she would not go, and the General grew loud and bitter. Then the Rector spoke, and persuaded the General to let Artemise remain to be my wife, or remain in England some time, till she had overcome her romantic fit, but as neither the General nor Artemise understood one word of what he said, he did not do much good. \" My father,\" said Artemise, \" I love you ! I honour you. But John is my love, and I cannot leave him. Take me back to your home. I shall come back to him again. I cannot live from him. I shall not try.\" Well, to make a long story short, the General had intended Artemise for a Count Somebody, but the Count didn't marry her, and I did. I lost my lawsuit. Mrs. Murgatroyd and Mr. Podd got all except two meadows, which didn't bring in much. Mrs. Murgatroyd died within the year, and left her share to Mr. Podd, so Podd flourishes, and is the leader of thousands of Yorkshire Regenerates. The General said With these words, the soldier-like spectre raised its gloved hand, saluted, and sank out of sight. Again the peculiar and melancholy notes floated through the room, and then arose a figure with a haggard, agonized face. It was dressed in homely fashion, like a yeoman in fair circumstances, and it bore in its hand a sickle. Its voice was abrupt and rugged, choking at times with emotion as it related this history. THE FARMER 'S STORY. I AM Jethro Hardrade, dead this two year. I must have been born with some malignant influence at work, such as men used to believe in. I've sometimes thought that a warlock, or an evil spirit, had power on the night that I came into the world. I've heard say that it was a wild November night, and that the wind tore up the old elm tree that stood before the great bam, and whirled off the thatch, so that the winter store of fodder was all flooded. People have been known who swore that they could hear the roaring of the sea at our out-field in the far corner looking westward, and that was three mile and more from the coast, where the deep coves lay under the cliff, and the waves sweep up the hollows like thunder in a north-east wind. The same bitter blast that struck down the old tree, struck my mother as she lay shud dering, and yet senseless, in the long low-ceiled room above stairs. My father had gone out to see what damage the storm had done, and to look after the doctor, who was belated, and for aught anybody could tell, had been blown over the ridge of Marshanger Fell, as he rode on his wall-eyed grey horse on such a night. I was an hour too late as it was. I wish I had never come. A knot of whispering women stood talking, and trying to rouse my mother, as she moaned and tossed her head from side to side in the great white bed. One of these women took me and held me on a low chair by the fire, and when my father came in again with the doctor, my mother's soul had gone out upon the wild wind into the black November night, and I was looked upon as the cause of her death ; and so, for all I had been bom too late, had better never have been born at all. I heard all this, and the last part too, when I was old enough to under stand my father's dark, moody looks, and to note his morose, silent temper. He had never shown much love for my mother in her lifetime, but he resented her death as much as if she'd been the apple of his eye. I've thought many times that he'd rather have worked out some sort of payment to be in this world than have had to live with remorse at his heart, waiting for the chances of the world to come. His looks seemed to say this to me, many a night when I was a younker, sitting watching the wood fire in the old kitchen, and seeing him glower at me from t'other side o' the chimney ; and for all that his eye looked straight at me, never seeming to think that I was a real five boy, that a word might have made better, or have helped to keep from the ruin of soul and body that was threatening me in years to come. You might have known what the room at that dreadful house was, by seeing what the house was like, as you stood and looked at it from the dreary yard and waste garden ground outside. There was a row of stunted pollards at that time by the side of the rank ditch that runs past the gable end under the bedroom window. The room where I lived was my home, and has been the only place that I have known, except the low timbered chamber above, where my mother died, where my father died, where my wife died, where I parted from my elder brother years ago, with a curse upon my lips. It has been the home of the Hardrades for four generations, and the first of my kin had it and the farm in payment for such service as a bad man gives to an evil master. You may have heard the story, though I think there are few alive now that know it to tell : \u2014 how Sir Jasper Beriton carried a young girl off to sea ; a young and beautiful lady, who was his wife's guest at the Hall beyond Marshanger, and how for years afterwards, before the old hall fell into ruins, Lady Beriton was shut up in one wing with only her maid and a keeper. She has been seen sometimes in wild winter nights wandering about the grounds \u2014 she, or her ghost, \u2014 spreading out her hands towards the angry sea, and screaming with the wind for Sir Jasper to come home : but he never has come, and he and the young lady have never since been heard of. They were wrecked off the coast of Holland. It was a Hardrade who enticed the girl down to Marshanger Cove, where the boat lay, that he had bribed the smugglers to have ready. He helped to gag her, and to shove off that crew into the surf, beyond which their black craft swung on and off the shore, and he had in his pocket the title to this house and land, over which a curse has brooded ever since, to blight the crops and sour the poor soil, to rot the roof-tree, and make the hearth-stone cold and bare. This, and most other things that I knew in the time that should have been my childhood, if I had ever had a childhood, I learnt from Alice Pomeroy, the woman who took me from my mother's pillow, and nursed me after she died, bringing me up by hand at her little cottage and general shop in Penthorpe village yonder, away by Stonewash End. I think Mrs. Pomeroy wanted to marry my father, after my mother's death, and she might have succeeded, but for me. I mean, that he was so angry at my birth and my mother's death in consequence, that he could never forgive me for coming into the world, nor Mrs. Pomeroy for helping to keep me in it when I had come. She didn't love me much, you may be sure ; but she was paid for keeping me till I was old enough to live at home with the two old servants and the three or four farm labourers, and she was the only woman that came to this wretched place \u2014 the only one my father would ever see inside the door, where few visitors came to lighten our heavy life. From her I heard all about the Hardrades, and how my mother was the daughter of old Clithorne, the saddler, and my father had married her because he thought she would have a pretty penny at the old man's death. When he found that the saddler was bankrupt, and had made over his business to a journeyman long before he died, for the sake of his keep and lodging, there was, if possible, less happiness than ever for my mother, and she had known very little before. My father never ill-used her with blows and hard usage ; but he broke her woman's heart, and sapped her life by a surer way. By a morose and unloving temper, by silent scowling, harsh sneers, neglect, and gloomy doubts and suspicions. You may judge what power a man like that could exercise in such a place as that. The overhanging room, like the lowering sky and plashy marsh outside, was full of deathly bodings. The great cheerless chimney could be warmed by no fire that has been lighted in our days; every black closet, and there is one in each comer, might be a coffin with a shrouded skeleton within it, and yet not be more ghostly than it was. The very wind sighed through the place, and shook and rattled at the quivering casements and rumbled in the broken roof as though it had an urgent'mes sage, and angrily sought to know how such an evil haunted building dared to stand so long."], [35, "THK FARMER'S STORY\u2014\"!

Perhaps he thought no more about it though, for presently in came Pendry, rather low spirited, and in deep mourning, for he had just lost his wile, and the shop was shut up. I don't know how it came about, but we got talking about investments, and the whole conversation ran on money and crops, and tithes and insurance. The others had insured their lives, but I hadn't ; and Pendry was saying how it was \u25a0every man's duty to leave something behind him. I was thinking of my father, and of this barren, cruel inheritance that had come to me, when somebody asked, what was a tontine? When I waked up enough to listen, I heard Pendry describing how a tontine was a sort of fund amongst a few people, where they each paid in something every quarter, or every year, or what not, and that it grew and .grew \u2014 interest added to principal \u2014 until all but one of the parties died, and then that him that lived longest had all. I don't remember how it happened, but one of the other three proposed that wre four should start a tontine amongst \u2022us. Pendry and I were the youngest, but the other two were as likely to live as we were, as far as we knew ; and after a little serious joking, the thing was made up. Each of us put twenty-five pounds down, which left me thirty-five out of the sixty I'd borrowed of Stradbrooke, and we were to pay once a quarter into the fund. So it stood, in point of age \u2014 Amos Plunkett, John Stradbrooke, Philip Pendry, Jethro Hardrade. I can remember what took possession of me when I'd signed my name to this agreement, and the thing was all settled. At first, I only began to wonder who'd come in for all the money \u2014 how long it would be before the three first died, and who would be the lucky fourth. From this I got to thinking what could be done with a little lump of money in three or four years' time, if the rest died before me ; and then I found myself gloating over the fancy of my being the owner of it, and giving up the farm to go into some other place. I've no space to tell you how these thoughts haunted me night and day, nor how I sat and muddled myself with drink. I turned them this way and that, and wondered what would be best to be done with the money, when It came to me. For I'd begun to look forward to it now as though it were settled to be mine, and I grew impatient for it. I couldn't repay John Stradbrooke his loan, and I had much to do to scrape together interest, though my wife pinched and starved, and grew thinner and weaker every day, till she wore away from this evil life, and went where I shall never meet her more. I was drunk when she died \u2014 drunk on the day of the funeral, sodden and senseless with drink all the week after ; and yet, amidst it all, the thought of the tontine, and of how I might outlive the three men who stood between me and the money, seemed to go round and round in my brain, and keep out everything else. I didn't go near the Lion all that time ; but I was pretty often down at Marshanger and at Deeping ; and the company I met there did me no good. I did them no good ; for not a desperate villain of them all was worse than I was, nor had blacker thoughts in his heart. The crops of contraband goods in the store field were heavy, and I was out almost every night when my mad, drunken fit was over. I was try- ing to drown care, and to get away from the thoughts of Ph\u0153be to my own damnation. There was very mixed com- pany at the Mariners, for some rough country fellows, with suspicious looks, had made it their head-quarters now ; and one of them I knew in old times as the man who had so often brought the donkey and panniers to the field. He was nick- named Dick Harefoot, and poaching and smuggling were alike to him. I soon found out that he was waiting an op- portunity for revenge against Amos Plunkett, who had stopped his trade in the Beriton preserves, and had turned him out of a cottage on the estate on suspicion, because he had been seen loitering about the wood with a gun after nightfall. The devil, who never left my elbow, told me what to say; and I left the Mariners that night, certain that I had put thoughts of murder in the poacher's heart, at the same time that I had let him know where Plunkett took his lonely round at early morning about the Beriton thickets. Three days afterwards, the bailiff's body was found in the plantation, and Dick Harefoot had not been heard of in Deeping. It was impossible to say how Amos Plunkett had been killed ; but he was lying on his face, with a wound through the left side, and his own piece was empty, as though it had been fired at the time of his death. Whether he died by accident, and Dick Harefoot saw his body and fled for fear, or whether the poacher's hand fired the shot, I have never heard to this day ; but I knew then, as I know now, that I was a murderer in my soul. Only two men now stood between me and four hundred pounds. John Stradbrooke had sent to inquire after me such times as I was away from the Lion more than a week or two. His messenger was his little motherless girl, Annie, a sweet, fair-haired, brown-eyed little wench then, but now a grown girl. Oh ! if I could live my hfe over again, or if I could hope to bring her happiness by years of suffering, I think that I could do it now, when all payment is too late, for what she was to me in those five weeks ; and yet there was so much of that same perverse and sullen, cruel devil in me yet, that even she had not quite cast it out : and I could not bear to know that she had been pro mised in marriage to my brother's son \u2014 a blithe young fellow, as I heard, a coast-guard officer, away beyond North over. My brother was lost at sea two years before, they say. His vessel \u2014 for he was a commander then \u2014 hadn't been heard of when it was long overdue, and so was given up for lost. John Stradbrooke, I say, sent after me because he had had another stroke and could not come himself, but he was hale and well again, all but that he dragged his leg still more and leaned upon a stick. I kept away, for I was at Deeping every night again now, and had heard that the smuggling about the creeks and caves thereby was getting wind, and that a party of king's men, with an officer, had been seen about the coast, where a sailing-boat was keeping off and on upon the watch. Some of the fellows who had been ready the night before to run a lot of goods along the path from the beach, and so up to Stonefield, had seen a man walking in that direction, and had taken him for a spy. They knew him too. Judge of my excitement when I heard that it was Philip Pendry. In a moment tbe evil thought flashed through me that Pendry had been to see me, and finding I hadn't been home, had strolled about the fields. He would come again, perhaps, that very night or the next. It took little to convince the men I talked to that Pendry was a Government spy \u2014 an informer \u2014 who had somehow scented the hidden plunder about Stonefield. I staggered home, drunk with liquor, but more drunk with terror at what I had done. Still I wouldn't undo it, and stayed at home all next day obstinate and full of remorse that led to no repentance. As night drew on and I sat there alone, I trembled at the least sound out of doors and started to the window, or stood bare-headed in the rain a dozen times. The smouldering fire had burnt out, the candle had guttered away, and I had dropped asleep, when I was wakened suddenly by a shout at some distance, followed by a pistol-shot, and a crashing sound like the trampling of men upon a road. I crept back and sat trembling in my chair all night. The next day there were traces of blood upon the ground in the footpath leading from Marshanger towards the Stonefield. The party which I had met at the Mariners had gone oft, and left a warning for me to keep quiet, and Philip Pendry had disappeared. I thought I knew where his body was, and that it would be found, what there was of it, some day after my death, under the wall fence, where so many other things were buried. I never looked for it \u2014 never sought to dig up those bundles and kegs which were worth so much money, lest I might come upon that dreadful sight \u2014 the corpse of the man I betrayed to his death. Whoever did the deed, I was the murderer of Philip Pendry, and only one man stood between me and five hundred pounds. That is five years ago ; and I went on living the life of a condemned felon in that accursed prison. My debt to John Stradbrooke increased by five pounds, advanced to enable me to buy some seed that year, and he had my signature in his pocket. How that man did live ! It seemed to me that he was out of the course of nature to be able to rally again after five strokes, but he did, and all my black evil heart gnawed itself to know that only he stood between me and that money, which might not, after all, be mine ; for drink was telling upon me, and as I had no smuggled kegs and carboys now, the filthy, drugged brandy of the taverns maddened me and made me old before my time. It was death to me to hear John Stradbrooke talk about our being the two sole survivors of the tontine, and to have have him shake hands with me at parting, and tell me that he"], [38, "28 THE \"FIFE ALLS. should try to outlive me yet, though he feared I should be too many for him. . 1 ' You'll pay what's between us to my little Annie, here, in case I should go first,\" he said to me one night, and there was something prophetic in his way of speaking. I called on him the next day. He was sitting in the porch of his house, with a pillow at his back and his legs upon a chair. I could see he was shaky, for he motioned me to sit down opposite, and then told me that he was afraid of another stroke. He had two bottles by his side, and told me how one was medicine that he kept quite near him that he might take it at a moment's notice if he felt his head getting queer, and the other a strong lotion for his limb \u2014 a poison, to be rubbed on now and then \u2014 which he put quite up in a corner of the seat, so that he might make no mistake. Do I look like a man in torture. I have been, and I must be, though the agony that then overset my heart is past. I've not the power to struggle, and that may seem to you to be a calm ; but under here, under this seeming body, there is a fire that may burn on and on through years ; a sire set alight of the hell that I have prepared for myself. And yet, although I put the thought from me, when I remember that gentle girl, and how she would come and go, how I felt the pressure of her hand, and had her to tend me, I feel as though there might be some mercy even for me far off in everlasting ages. In life I believed that I murdered John Stradbrooke with my own hands. While he was talking to me he went off into a doze. In an instant, before the temptation had left me time to think, I changed the places of those two bottles, and put the poison close to his hand. Then I went away, and walked slowly home, without once looking behind me. That night I heard that he was dead. His daughter had come back and found him stretched lifeless on the path, his face all twisted and his eyes staring. The news reached me, but I seemed as far as ever from the money, for I, too, was struck down, and a slow fire began to burn out my life. I never touched the money. I never shall touch it. It will all go, with the price of that accursed house {may it be pulled down and the site be sowed with salt !) and the cruel land, to the daughter of the murdered man ; she who came from her dead father to help and tend his dying friend. His friend ! The man who Hush ! Even I, a ghost, am carried back to the reality of that time ! I hear her step upon the path ; and I will confess to her, too. \"Annie! Annie! dear, 'twas I, 'twas I that killed your father. What ! you think I'm wandering in my mind? I put the poison near his hand, and of that he died. \"No ! do you say so? and that the bottle, a full bottle, was found where it had rolled away into a comer of the seat ? Thank Heaven for that, at least. Oh, thank Heaven for that, though I am still guilty ! \"A visitor for me \u2014 a man, an old man, one who should be dear to me? I know none such ! Onewho^w/slfbedear ! Not \u2014 not\u2014 my brother ? Ah ! Hosea Hardrade, forgive me ! \u2014 forgive a dying man whose curses have fallen on his own head ! What have I to forgive ? Forgive you ! \u2014 yes, whatever it may be. \"You \u2014 you \u2014 upon my land five years ago, up by the stone-field, under orders to take me ; but with orders to press some men into the service, too? You talk in riddles. Yes, I know what a pressgang is ! Your hair is quite grey, Hosea ! You took a man and pressed him on board your boat. Yes, yes, there was a boat lying off or on the beach. That man was in the path by the Stonefield, and ran towards this house, and was wounded ? His name, Hosea Hardrade, his name ? \"Philip Pendry ! did you say Philip Pendry ? or do I dream ? And so he died abroad ; and I \u2014 I am his murderer ; Oh ! thank Heaven, no ! no ! no ! Kneel down, and let me whisper to you, brother, and you, too, Annie, dear. The light is fading from my eyes, and all this place is dark ; but \u2014 but 'twill be better land maybe one day \u2014 better land for us all.\" ******* In a corner of Deeping churchyard may still be seen a grave marked by a plain stone on which is inscribed JETHRO HARDRADE, DIED NOVEMBER 23RD, 18 \u2014 , AGED 53 YEARS. I PAY FOR ALL. Wringing its hands in a paroxysm of dumb agony, this figure disappeared like its predecessors, and was succeeded by an apparition wearing the wig and gown of a barrister. Its voice was silvery and persuasive, and it accompanied by graceful and carefully-moderated action, the story which it related. THE LAWYER 'S STORY. Two boys, a big boy and a little boy, were sitting, one June evening, on a stile in a field. The big boy was about seven teen years old, and, as became a big boy of that age, smoked a black meerschaum pipe. The little boy was a little boy of twelve, and he appeared to have a great deal more upon his mind than so very little a boy ought in fairness to be encum bered with, for his eyes bore traces of very recent tears, and the brave gulps in his poor little throat showed that he was fighting hard with another threatened inundation. The big boy was a pleasant, good-natured young fellow, not particu larly handsome, and, perhaps, not particularly intelligent, but there was a fine honest stamp upon his pleasant brown face, which went far to compensate him for a decided irregu larity of feature. He was a great, brawny, clumsy fellow, with big hands and feet, and a great shock of wavy brown hair. The little boy was a poor, puny-looking little chap, with pretty, delicate features and canary-coloured hair. The big boy was Ted Brereton, the only son of an impoverished sporting baronet, and the little boy was Harry Osborne, whose father was the senior partner in theeminent banking firm of Osborne, Osborne, Bailey, and Cameron. Brereton and Osborne were fellow-pupils under the Reve rend Nicholas Calderby, who made a very capital thing out of the young aristocrats at three hundred a-year per aristo crat. The Reverend Mr. Calderby was a capital fellow in his way. He was a brilliant scholar, with nothing whatever of the conventional schoolmaster about him, but with a good deal of what a schoolmaster should be notwithstanding. His system was to treat his pupils \u2014 even the youngest of them \u2014 as grown gentlemen, which placed them on the best of all possible terms with themselves and with him. He made a point of accepting their word without hesitation, and he would as soon have thought of applying the cane to a member of the LIniversity Club as of touching one of his pupils with that objectionable instrument. The result of this course of treatment was that Calderby's became celebrated as an institution which rarely gave a dunce to the world, and never a snob. A man from Calderby's had all the engaging frankness and manly self-reliance which generally charac terize a boy educated at Eton or Harrow, without that dis tressing knowledge of the world (especially of its more discreditable features) which we now and then find in young gentlemen whose early days have been passed at a big public school within easy railway distance of London. Of course Brereton and Osborne had not been school fellows very long, but in the course of the year during which they had been associated at Calderby's, an attachment of a rather romantic kind had sprang up between the two boys \u2014 an attachment engendered of the little boy's admiration for his big, brawny, active companion, who, as far as every phy sical attribute was concerned, was an Admirable Crichton in little Osborne's eyes, and of that good-natured, half-compas sionate sympathy which strong active boys often feel towards their weaker associates. There was no \"fag\" principle recognised at Calderby's, but Calderby allowed fighting, and Brereton fought all poor little Osborne's battles, and, indeed, took him generally under his protection ; Osborne in return rendered, willingly and even enthusiastically, all those num berless little services which such a very big boy as Brereton might, if he liked, have exacted as a matter of course from such a very little boy as Osborne. After an intimate association of a year or so, there came a black day for poor little Osborne. Brereton was gazetted to. an ensigncy in the 19th Regiment of Foot, and must go. It was on the evening before Brereton's final departure from Calderby's that the two boys were sitting together on the stile in the big field. \"You must write to me jolly often, old fellow,\" said Osborne, \"for it will be awfully slow down here when'you've gone. And, I say, when you get any holi \u2014 leave, I mean you'll come and see us now and then, wont you ?\" \"Come and see you! I should think I would! If I'm in England (which I'm likely to be for the next two years) I'll ran down to Calderby's as often as I can get away.\""], [39, "THE LAWYER'S STORY\u2014\" I PLEAD FOR ALL.\" 29 \"It'll be awfully slow here now.\" \"Slow !\u2014 not a bit of it. There are lots of good fellows left. There's Collumpton, and Paynter, and Bob Travers, and\u2014 oh, lots of others ! Besides, I dare say I shall often run down to Calderby's for a week or two at a time.\" \" Ah, you think so now ; but, you see, to-morrow you'll be a man, and be getting on in the world like mad. I don't suppose you'll trouble yourself much about such a beastly old hole as Calderby's.\" Osborne was comparatively new to Calderby's, and had hardly yet reconciled himself to the change from a rollicking, not to say devil-may-care existence under the nominal sway of a weak-minded governess, to the discipline, mild as it was, of the Reverend Mr. Calderby's house. \"For matter of that,\" said Brereton, \" the career of a sub in a line regiment in country quarters doesn't appear (from what I'm told) to be particularly well calculated to turn a fellow's brain. It'll be a good long while before I have the chance at all, and when I do, promotion wont be so rapid as to take my breath away, Harry.\" ' ' You not get on ! Why, you can do anything ! I never, in the whole course of my life, knew such a fellow as you are \\ There, give you an old knife and a bit of wood, and you'll tum out a ship, or a \u2014 a pair of nutcrackers, or a\u2014 ah, anything !\" \"I'm afraid that that's an accomplishment which wont go far to get me my company, old fellow ! But we shall see.\" A big bell rang across the field. \"There's the prayer-bell,\" said Brereton ; \"we shall have to run for it.\" was seventeen, when owing, I suppose, to the valuable influ ence of his mamma, Lady Elizabeth, daughter of the Earl of Ovington, once Secretary of State for War, he was gazetted to a commission in the Scots Fusilier Guards. He and Brereton had seen a good deal of each other since Brereton's departure from Calderby's ; for not only had the good-natured linesman contrived to run down pretty often into Essex \u2014 for Calderby's was near Colchester, and Brereton could knock off Calderby's and half a dozen garrison friends in the same day \u2014 but C^borne had introduced him to Lady Elizabeth, who had taken a great fancy to the frank and clumsy lines man, and insisted upon his stopping at her house in Clarges Street whenever he had occasion to come up to town from Dover, where he was quartered. So whenever Osborne came home for his holidays, Brereton was sure to be invited to Clarges Street, and on one or two occasions \u2014 but these were when Osborne was seventeen \u2014 Brereton took him back with him to Dover, and Osborne dined at the regimental mess, and got, I am sorry to say, dreadfully tipsy. The school boy attachment that sprang up between the puny, pale-faced \u25a0 boy of twelve and the strapping young fellow of seventeen existed as strongly as ever when Osborne left Calderby's to join his regiment. Osborne had grown into a tall, delicate looking, gentlemanly lad, with girlish features and thick, soft, yellowish hair. Brereton, by this time, was a huge, burly, plain, ill-dressed, good-tempered, Newfoundland-dog sort of fellow, with a sunburnt face, thick brown whiskers, and a countenance expressive at once of extreme good-nature and unalterable resolution. It was when Ted Brereton came to spend a six-weeks' leave at Lady Elizabeth's, in the summer of 1853, that he heard of Osborne's appointment. 1 ' Ted, old boy, I'm free at last !\" shouted Osborne, as soon as he caught sight of Brereton's pleasant face in the hall. \"No more Calderby's \u2014 I've my commission \u2014 last night's Gazette \u2014 didn't you see it?\" \"No; I travelled all night, and this morning I was too ' done up' to look at anything. But I'm awfully glad. Tell us all about it.\" \"We !\" said Osborne ; \"I like that ! / wouldn't run for it if I was going to leave Calderby's to-morrow for good. I'd walk jolly slow, supposing I went at all.\" \" No, you wouldn't, Harry. You'd be doing it for the last time, and depend upon it you'll do it well ; and I'll tell you what, old fellow. When it comes to your turn to go, if you've had as jolly a time of it here as I have had, take my word for it, that you'll be as sorry as I am to see the last of any of the well-known features of the old place.\" And the two boys set off at a hard trot to the house. ******* \"Here you are: 'Scots Fusilier Guards: Ensign and Lieutenant Hon. George Conway to be Lieutenant and Captain, without purchase, vice Campbell, deceased. Henry Osborne, gent., to be Ensign and Lieutenant, with out purchase, vice Conway.' There \u2014 what do you say to that?\" Brereton left Calderby's, and in a couple of months or so he joined his regiment. I am sorry to say that his father, a client of mine, Sir Edward Brereton, had in the meantime lost a large sum of money on the turf \u2014 a Tom Tiddler's ground in which he had sown, at sundry times and in divers manners, a good deal of gold and silver for other and more fortunate men to pick up. The sum was so large that it came to be publicly talked about, otherwise, I suppose, no one would have known anything about it. Sir Edward became, in consequence, quite a public character, and was looked upon by the non-sporting world as a remarkable social phenomenon \u2014 a man who really had lost. My own experi- ence of turf characters is that they invariably win. I used to meet a dozen friends the day after the Derby, and they always told me that they had \"done uncommonly well,\" and, of course, I believed them, and was glad to hear it. But the fact that society at large invariably wins, would seem to argue that there must be some one who invariably loses. Then who is he? At the particular date which this story has reached, it was, I suppose, Sir Edward Brereton ; but he is long since dead, and if he were alive, he would have no money to lose. Then who is it? The unfortunate old gentleman's losses happened him so seriously, that he really found great difficulty in providing his son with the annual two hundred pounds which he required in order to support his position as an officer in her Majesty's service with anything like credit, or perhaps I shouldvsay without anything like credit. However, Ted Brereton con- trived to purchase his lieutenancy in about a couple of years after he entered the service, and was fairly on his road to a company, when his poor silly old father became still more impoverished ; and the immediate consequence to Ted Brereton was that his father was not only unable to deposit at his son's agents the money necessary to purchase his company, but he had, moreover, to cut down Ted's rather scanty allowance to one-half. Ted was a good fellow. He smoked fewer cigars, placed his horse on half-pay, and didn't run up to town quite so often as he used to ; which was, on the whole, per haps quite as well. The loss of his purchase-money was, however, a big blow to him. He had stood first for purchase, and now there were six lieutenants who were prepared to buy over his head. \"Say ! why, that I'm happier than I can tell you at your good fortune. Without purchase, too ! By Jove, I'm un commonly glad.\" \"And you, old boy, where are you in the Nineteenth?\" \" Still second in the lieutenants, \" said Brereton cheerfully. \"And,\" added he, \"small chance of ever being anything else !\" \" Nonsense \u2014 why, you're first for purchase !\" \" No. My father's heavy losses have done away with all hope of assistance for that object. I'm a poor devil of a lieutenant, with a hundred a year besides my pay, and in that particularly unsatisfactory capacity I'm likely to remain for a good many years, unless the war that people talk of between Russia and Turkey comes to anything.\" Osborne thought for a minute or two. \" Look here, old fellow,\" said he at last. \" Mind you, I mean what I'm going to say. I've got my commission (most unexpectedly) without purchase, so I've nearly two thousand pounds to spare \" \" Harry, my dear fellow \" \" Don't interrupt me, because if you do I shan't have the pluck to go on. I'm going to say a very cheeky thing, that will probably put you in a big rage ; but I'm determined to risk that, and so here goes. I've \u2014 I've \u2014 hang it ! I've a couple of thousand or so to spare \u2014 will you have them ? There, now it's out !\" Osborne blurted the words out very quickly, and looked extremely red and uncomfortable after he had done so. \" My dear fellow \u2014 you don't suppose for one moment \" \" No, I don't. I don't dare to take time to suppose. I'm speaking without thinking, but I mean what I say, never theless. If I had stopped to think about it, I shouldn't have had the pluck to say it, though I should have meant it all the same. I know my mother will let me do as I like in the matter \u2014 the money's mine, although I'm not of age \u2014 and it shall be paid in to your account at Cox's to-morrow.\" \"You're a good fellow, Osborne, and it's like you to offer it, but it wont do. You know me too well to suppose that I should ever consent to accept a loan which I could never, Young Harrv Osborne remained at Calderby's until he"], [40, "THE \" MS ALLS\" 3\u00b0 Indeed, Ins visit id rric- was thtr oagOBi fe tr-ason of his ojrniTij to town (for Sir Edwwd v;oi csnfiucd ta bis b\u00abl), ana J raiher think that (he propo-bi to Lucy was a p. aw.i.jent en gendered ol the fact ' l onbiswwio ray.

' , . <i. Lucy Bessemer was an uncommonly pretty girl of sixteen or so when Ted Brereton first met her at Lady Elizabeth's, a year and a half before Osborne left Calderby's to take up his commission. She was small, reasonably plump, with a bright round face, big brown eyes, and a quantity of barley sugar hair, which massed itself in great folds at the back of a particularly symmetrical little head. There was a singular vitality in the muscles of her face, which gave an extraordi nary animation to her neat little features, and especially to her mouth, towards which these same muscles appeared deli cately to converge \u2014 which doesn't sound pretty, I admit. I am a bad hand at describing a beauty r the fact of my alluding to Lucy's muscles at all argues that my mind is too grossly material to venture upon so delicate a subject. You must take it, if you please, that Lucy was a very pretty and animated little blonde. 1 ,n. . I .

PLEAD FOR ALL.\" 33 for Aunt Ruth is not a pleasant old lady, and Merthyr Tydvil is deplorably dull. I have written a letter to dear Harry, which I must ask you to convey to him, for I know that your long friendship for him and for me will induce you to plead my cause with him, if the terms of my letter do not suffice to convince him of my unalterable love. \" Believe me to be, ' ' Dear Captain Brereton, \" Ever yours most gratefully, \"Lucy E. Bessemer.\" find Mrs. Mumby, in a state of great alarm, by his bedside. She seemed immensely relieved to find he was recovering, and falling on her knees by the bedside, implored his pardon for letting him sleep in the haunted room on Christmas Eve. The events of the night came back, one after another, to his recollection. He glanced at his wrist ! There was the black mark of a hand burnt into tht skin. CHAPTER VII. \u2014 SUNLIGHT IN BACHELORS' BUILDINGS. Harry Osborne read the letter from beginning to end without saying a word. When he finished it, he folded it up, returned it to its envelope, and sat down. \" Harry \u2014 , \" said Brereton. \"Don't speak to me \u2014 let me think \u2014 I am trying to find something to say to you \u2014 something that will express in some measure my horror at my detestable behaviour. Dear old Ted Brereton\u2014 the oldest, best friend I have\u2014 I don't ask you to forgive me. I have insulted you as grossly as one man can insult another, and you have borne the insult as only a brave fellow and a true gentleman could. You can't forgive me, Ted, but you can, perhaps, make some allow ance for the awful state of mind I've been in for the last three weeks. The fact that Lucy's letters dropped off one by one, and then that damned newspaper paragraph coming, as it did, when I was miserable with apprehension \" \" Newspaper paragraph. What do you mean, old boy ?\" \"Why, this: about your row with that blackguard bar rister !\" Old Phillibert kept his promise to the ghost. As soon as he was dressed, he went to Bachelors' Buildings, and, calling on Calthrop, made him draw up a release of the conditions on which he let his chambers, and signed it in the presence of all. Tom Ashby suggested to old Phillibert that, perhaps, some of the gentlemen would like to be released also from their engagement to dine at the Five Alls, in order to spend the day with more attractive company. But old Phillibert would not hear of that. In the end, it was determined that each of the gentlemen might invite one or two friends of either sex. So they shook hands all round with Phillibert, and set out, it being still early in the day, in various directions and Hansom cabs. Dinner was laid at six, in the long room at the Five Alls. Old Phillibert took the chair, and Tom Ashby, who said, with a melancholy shake of the head, that he had no friends to invite, sat at the foot of the table. And he handed Brereton the paper that contained the paragraph in question. \"Harry,\" said Brereton, \"on my soul I never knew of this. You say you can't ask me to forgive you. Let me tell you, old fellow, that, with the facts before you, as they pre sented themselves to you, you would have been unworthy of the coat you wear if you had acted otherwise.\" William Gillray brought his aunt and his cousin Lucinda, Charles Lawes came with Mary Marville, Martin James had mustered up enough courage (on the strength of Mr. Chan trey's having told him on the previous night that he meant to take him into partnership) to invite Grace and her father, Henry Calthrop had exerted the eloquence which made him so successful at the bar, to persuade Belle Brandon and her mamma to honour old Phillibert's feast. As for Timothy Jallett, he arrived last, with Mrs. Mumby on his arm. The rich colour which suffused that lady's good humoured face, was due less to her blushes than to her anxiety that the dinner should be served up creditably. And a capital dinner it was, and a pleasant evening afterwards, when they had a bowl of punch, and drank prosperity to ' ' Well, the war at length came to an end, and Osborne and Brereton \u2014 Captain Osborne and Major Brereton \u2014 re turned home uninjured. That Lucy kept her promise to Brereton is scarcely to be doubted, for the only society that Aunt Ruth saw consisted of an elderly curate, a half-pay army-surgeon, and the local attorney. But as soon as the term of her banishment was at an end, she hurried to South ampton to meet her two lovers \u2014 the old and the new \u2014 and it was not long after her brave boy's return that Harry Osborne and Lucy Bessemer were married. And the old lover was the bridegroom's best man. The Five Alls ! Postscript. \u2014 It is some years since this chronicle was set down. Bachelors' Buildings are now known as the United States. There are women's figures moving about it, to bring sunshine there, and* the voices of children make its music. And the friend of the old folks, and the favourite and play- mate of all the little ones, is Tom Ashby. At Tom's feet reposes a grey, blind, deaf, wreck of a rough terrier. He answers to the name of Rags. It is our old friend, who has transferred his allegiance to Tom of late, be- cause his master has taken to spending much time at the house of a certain Miss Felicia Vince, a well-to-do and not ill-preserved spinster. It is whispered in the Buildings that there are chances of Miss Vince 's ceasing to exist, and pro- babilities that a Mrs. Phillibert may suddenly start into being. The Buildings are considerably altered. The requirements of the married folks demanded an enlargement \u2014 new wings have been added, and the whole place bears a modernized and civilized aspect. You can see the Buildings any day close to the Blankworth Station of the Blankdon, Blankham, and Blanker Railway, on the right as you come up to town. The only part that remains unchanged is that in which Tom Ashby resides. Now Tom Ashby is a bit of a ventriloquist. He can imi- tate the howl of a dog, and assume several aifferent voices. He has got an \u00c6olian harp, which discourses fairy-like music. There is in a cupboard in his room a square of canvas \u2014 for Tom is a bit of a scene-painter \u2014 and it is painted like the sign of the \"Five Alls,\" only the compartments are empty, because he has not painted in the figures. If you were to light it up with a little brandy and salt set on fire, it would look very odd. In that same cupboard there is a large piece of gauze, which makes you look very misty and ghostlike if you stand behind it ; and there are some bottles on a shelf there \u2014 for Tom is a bit of a chemist (his father was a doctor, you know) \u2014 and one contains chloroform, and the other contains caustic. There are several theatrical By the time the legal apparition had concluded his story, the moonlight was beginning to straggle with the first grey of the Christmas morning. The ghost cast an anxious glance toward the window. \" Methinks,\" it said, \" I scent the morning air. My time is short. Listen, therefore, old man, for my task is to plead for all. \" You have learnt from the words of my companions and myself, how great a part in life belongs to the human heart. Love is the king who rules all \u2014 but not the less does he pray for all, plead for all, fight for all, pay for all ! And yet you think to chain the human heart \u2014 to bind it within brick walls and fetter it with foolish phrases.

Perhaps you were never there. I do not censure you if you never were. This should not surprise you. Nothing that a modern novelist docs should excite asto nishment in any well-regulated mind. One can get on very well without going to Waterbury. Indeed, there are mil lions of meritorious per sons who were never there, and yet they are happy. In this peaceful hamlet lived a voung man named Pettingill. Reuben Pettingill. He was an agricul turist. IV.\u2014 INDEPENDENCE DAY, The 4th day of July is always celebrated in America with guns, and processions, and banners, and all those things. You know why we celebrate this day. The American Revolution, in 1775, was perhaps one of the finest revolutions that was ever seen. But I have not time to give you a full history of the American Revolution. It would consume years to do it, and I might weary you. One 4th of July, Reuben Pettingill went to Boston. He saw great sights. He saw the dense throngs ol people, the gay volunteers, the banners, and, above all, he saw the fireworks. A broad - shouldered, deep - chested agricul turist. I despise myself for using so low a word, but the fireworks \"licked \" him. He was contented to live in this peaceful hamlet. He said it was better than a noisy Othello. Thus do these simple children of nature joke in a first-class A new world was opened to this young man. He returned to his parents and the little farm among the hills, with his heart full of fireworks. manner. He said, \" I will make some myself.\" He said this while eating a lobster on top of the coach. He was an extraordinarily skilful young man in the use of a common clasp-knife. With that simple weapon he could make, from soft wood, horses, dogs, cats, &c. He carved excellent soldiers also. I remember his masterpiece. It was \" Napoleon Crossing the Alps.'1 Looking at it critically, I should say it was rather short of Alps. An Alp or two more would have improved it : but, as a whole, it was a wonderful piece of work ; and what a wonderful piece of work is a wooden man, when his legs and arms are all right. II.\u2014 MYSELF. I write this romance in the French style. Yes : something that way. The French style consists of making just as many para graphs as possible. Thus one may fill up a column in a very short time. I am paid by the column, and the quicker I can fill up a column \u2014 but this is a matter to which we will not refer. We will let this matter pass. III.\u2014 PETTINGILL. Reuben Pettingill was extremely industrious. He worked hard all the year round on his father's little farm. Right he was ! Industry is a very sine thing. It is one of the finest things of which we have any know ledge. Yet do not frown \u2014 \"do not weep for me\" \u2014 when I state V.\u2014 WHAT THIS YOUNG MAN SAID. He said, \"I can make just as good fireworks as them in Boston.\" Them\" was not grammatical, but why care for grammar that I don't like it. as long as we are good ?"], [45, "PYLOTECHNY. 35 Night closed in, and an immense concourse of people gathered on the village green. On a raised platform, amidst his fireworks, stood Pettin gill. He felt that the great hour of his hfe was come, and, in a firm, clear voice, he said : VI. \u2014 THE FATHER'S TEARS. Pettingill neglected the farm. He said that it might till itself \u2014 he should manufacture Some gorgeous fireworks, and exhibit them on the village green on the next 4th of July. He said the Eagle of Fame would flap his wings over their humble roof ere many months should pass away. \" If he does,\" said old Mr. Pettingill, \"we must shoot him, and bile him, and eat him, because we shall be rather short of meat, my son, if you go on in this lazy way.\" And the old man wept. He shed over 120 gallons of tears. That is to say, a puncheon. But by all means let us avoid turning this romance into a farce. \"The fust fireworks, feller-citizens, will be a rocket, which will go up in the air, bust, and assume the shape of a serpint.\" He applied a match to the rocket, but instead of going up in the air, ic flew wildly down into the grass, running some distance with a hissing kind of sound, and causing the masses to jump round in a very insane manner. Pettingill was disappointed, but not disheartened. He tried again. \"The next fireworks,\" he said, \"will go up in the air, bust, and become a beautiful revolvin' wheel.\" VII.\u2014 PYROTECHNY. But, alas ! it didn't. It only ploughed a httle furrow in the green grass, like its unhappy predecessor. The masses laughed at this, and one man \u2014 a white-haired old villager \u2014 said, kindly but firmly, \"Reuben, I'm 'fraid you don't understand pyrotechny.\" Reuben was amazed. Why did his rockets go down in stead of up? But, perhaps, the others would be more suc cessful ; and, with a flushed face, and in a voice scarcely as firm as before, he said : \"The next specimen of pyrotechny will go up in the air, bust, and become a eagle. Said eagle will soar away into the western skies, leavin' a red trail beliind him as he so soars.\" But the headstrong young man went to work, making fire works. He bought and carefully studied a work on pyrotechny. The villagers knew that he was a remarkably skilful young man, and they all said, \"We shall have a great treat next 4th of July.\" Meanwhile Pettingill worked away. viii. \u2014 THE DAY. The great day came at last. Thousands poured into the little village from far and near. There was an oration, of course. But alas ! again, fro eagle soared, but, on the contrary, that ordinarily proud bird buried its head in the grass. The people were dissatisfied. They made sarcastic re marks. Some of them howled angrily. The aged man, who had before spoken, said, \u2022 No, Reuben, you evidently don't understand pyrotechny.\" Pettingill boiled with rage and disappointment. \" You don't understand pyrotechny !\" the masses shouted. Then they laughed in a disagreeable manner, and some unfeeling lads threw dirt at our hero. \"You don't understand pyrotechny!\" the masses yelled again. \"Don't I?\" screamed Pettingill, wild with rage \u2014 \"don't you think I do ?\" Then seizing several gigantic rockets he placed them over a box of powder, and touched the whole off\". This rocket went up. It did, indeed. There was a terrific explosion. No one was killed, fortunately ; though many were injured. The platform was almost torn to pieces. But proudly erect among the falling timbers stood Pettin gill, his face flashing with wild triumph ; and he shouted : \" If I'm any judge of pyrotechny, that rocket has went off.\" Then seeing that all the fingers on his right-hand had been taken close off in the explosion, he added : \" And I ain't so dreadful certain but four of my fingers has went off with it,. because I don't see 'em here now !\" IX. \u2014 ORATORY IN AMERICA. Yes ; there was an oration. We have a passion for oratory in America \u2014 political oratory chiefly. Our political orators never lose a chance to \"express their views.\" They will do it. You cannot stop them. There was an execution in Ohio one day, and the Sheriff, before placing the rope round the murderer's neck, asked him if he had any remarks to make ? \"If he hasn't,\" said a well-known local orator, pushing his way rapidly through the dense crowd to the gallows \u2014 \" if our ill-starred feller-citizen don't feel inclined to make a speech, and is in no hurry, I should like to avail myself of the present occasion to make some remarks on the necessity of a new protective tariff ! \" x. \u2014 pettingill's fireworks. As I said in Chapter vm., there was an oration. There were also, processions, and guns, and banners. \"This evening,\" said the chairman of the committee of arrangements, ' ' this evening, fellow-citizens, there will be a grand display of fireworks on the village green, superintended by the inventor and manufacturer, our public-spirited towns man, Mr. Reuben Pettingill.\" THREE f HUNDRED By Henry S.

I don't think as ever I see a more beautifuler ead of 'air in human existence than I see on that young woman's 'ead, a layin' all over the pillar, and certainly a fine little boy as Sarah was a joggin' across her knees as if he'd been six weeks old, instead of them 'ours, and was dressed in nothin' suit- able, but a old flannin' petticoat and a shawl. So I says, \"You just keep him warm, and let 'im be,\" and I takes off my bonnet and shawl, and turns to for to make that poor thing more comfortable in her bed, for she was that low as I didn't 'ardly know what to do with her, and Mrs. Watson a-talking rubbish about red port-wine negus, and a bit ot something as she could fancy. \" Now,\" I says, \"whatever you do don't go a feedin' her up, or you'll kill her off; let her be quiet with a little gruel, and we shall see 'ow the cat jumps, as the sayin' is.\" So I puts her more comfortable in her bed, as was quite sensible, tho' very low. It's well as I went into the kitchen just then, for if they wasn't agoin' to feed that baby with a biled crust beat up with butter, sugar, and nutmeg. I pretty soon stopped that rubbish, as milk-and-water is quite sufficient for, and stepped 'ome for to look up some things for that infant, as 'ad been laid by ever since my 'Liza was short-coated ; and good they was, tho' a dreadful colour, as will turn yeller when put away. I didn't mind the colour much, and no more didn't nobody else. Jest as I'd dressed 'im, in came the doctor, as is Mr. Simkins. He said as soon as he see me \u2014 \u25a0 \"Ah, Mrs. Brown, we shall get on now ;\" and me and him 'ad a good talk over it, as he says, ' ' Do give a eye to her, there's a good soul, for she's very shaky, and Mrs. Watson will 'ave her out o' bed for to scour the room, or something, the day arter to-morrow.\" And true his words proved ; for the very next day when I went in if I didn't ketch Sarah with a pail of water on the stairs, as said she was agoing to take up the flue under the bed with a wet flannin'. I says, \"You're a fool, and your mother's a bigger.\" As was 'asty words, and not meant, as I 'ad to say, thro' Mrs. Watson a-takin' on. But law, we 'adn't no time for words, for the moment I see that young woman I says to Sarah, \"Run for Mr. Simkins,\" for I see she were a sinkin'. I says, ' ' 'Owever could you let her get that low ?\" \"Oh,\" says Mrs. Watson, \"I ain't as clever as you, and can't be a-watchin' lodgers day and night as I may be out of pocket thro'.\" I says, \"Ain't he come back ?\" \" No,\" she says ; \" I think they're a bad lot ; for her clothes is all new and not marked, except one or two things ; and not a rag for that infant.\" I says, \" She don't look a bad lot, but quite a gal, as could be expected to have no experience ; but,\" I says, \"didn't ought to be left to die neither.\" As soon as Mr. Simkins come in he shook his 'ead, and said as there wasn't much 'ope on 'er. \"But,\"Isays, \"she's been let sink, and I've seen wuss get thro' it.\" \"Yes,\" he says ; \" I couldn't be here sooner, for I've got a patient a-dyin' round the corner.\" I stood over that poor thing ever so long, and kep' a drop ping a little weak brandy-and-water down her throat, and then we got her to swallow a little beef-tea, as certainly did seem for to revive her. It was about three in the arternoon when a cab drove up, and in comes a 'andsome young man, as looked deadly pale, and says, in a 'urried way, \" 'Ow is Mrs. Cameron?\" I says, \"Are you her good gentleman, sir?\" a speakin' respectable, for I see as he were a gentleman. He says, \"Yes. Are you the nuss ?\" I says, \" O dear, no ! I'm only a neighbour.\" He says, \" You looks esperienced : tell me what you think of her.\" \" Well, \" I says, \" she's certainly very bad, but I've known worse, for there was Mrs. Portlock's daughter, as every one RS. WATSON she come a bustin' in all of a 'urry one moming, as is a quiet woman, and kep' herself, with three children, re- spectable, as two is mar . ried now, when he went off and left her, a good- for-nothing vagabond, as I never 'ad no patience j with ; and her, that fool, ii to be always a-spilin' 'im (j and a-pesterin' about his looks, and sayin' as her * Sam were the andsomest man in London, and 'im all the time a wallering I like a sow in his bed at twelve o'clock in the day, thro' what he'd took over- , night, as he'd pledged her I weddin'-ring for to get it. I As I says to her then, | it would 'ave been over I my body as ever he'd ha' \" got it from me, for no husband as ever were born nor thought on should make me give it up, as has never took it off since the day it were put on, and keeps my weddin' lines in a old chayney tea-pot, the same as my dear mother did use to afore me, and married in the same church, as is Hosleydown parish, over agin' Redriff, where Prince Le Boo is buried, as my dear mother shook hands with herself, and perished untimely with measles, or water on the brain, as never could get thro' that wool as is all they've got for 'air, no doubt scorched up by a burning sun over there. Well, as I was a sayin', in come Mrs. Watson, and says, \"I've got a pretty kettle of fish in my 'ouse.\" I says, ' ' Whatever is it ?\" \"Why,\" she says, \" they only come in late last night, in the name of Cameron, and nothing but a carpet-bag and a black leather portmantue with the lock broken, and the straps \u00b0-ive way with a gettin' it off the cab, and all the things a rolling all over the pavement, as it's lucky it was dried up since the mornin', or she wouldn't have a thing to wear ; and the child was born at ten minutes past seven.\" I says, \"Whatever child are you a talking about?\" \"Why,\" she says, \"my lodgers as took the apartments. Leastways, he did about three, and said as they'd be in be fore dark, and it was nigh on eleven afore ever I set eyes on 'em, and knows nothing about 'em, tho' he have paid two sovereigns in advance, but whatever is that under them cir cumstances?\" I says, \"Then ask him for more at once.\" ' ' Oh,\" says she, ' ' he's off.\" I says, \" Off ! However do you mean ?\" \"Why,\" says she, \" he went out just before nine, without sayin' a word, and me nat'rally thought as he'd gone out to fetch something for her ; but here's just one, and no signs on 'im a returnin'.\" I says, \" 'Ave she got a nuss ?\" \"Well,\" she says, \"not more than myself and Sarah.\" So I see pretty clear what that would be ; for as to Sarah, she's a born fool, with that cast in her eye thro' cuttin' her teeth cross, as would be sure to put the infant's food in its ear thro' not a seein' straight to its mouth ; and as to Mrs. Watson, tho' not a bad sort, she's one of them drivin' women as would 'andle a invalid for all the world like a 'edge'ogg. I says, \" Mrs. Watson, take my advice, and 'ave a nuss by aM means.\" She says, \"It's all werry fine to talk, but 'ow about the money \u2014 him out of tha way, and that poor thing delirous as it is?\" So when I heerd that I made up my mind as I'd better go and see 'ow things was agoin' on, and Mrs. Watson, she jumped at it, as the sayin' is ; for, says she, \" If ever there was any one as understood a sick-room it's you, Mrs. Brown.\" I says, ' ' I don't do no more than any one might as would use their common senses, but it does seem as everybody can't do- it ; for I'm sure there's Brown's own sister as is that"], [51, "MRS.

That is kind ;\" and he says, \"You won't mind not a mentionin' of it to the people of the 'ouse ?\" I says, ' ' I hopes I knows myself better than for to talk over parties' affairs as puts confidence in me.\" I got him fifteen pounds on that watch and chain, as seemed for to please him ; but law, he wasn't one to keep money, 1 could see ; for he'd go out and bring in grapes as was four shillin's the pound in a cab, with jellies and all manner like that, for to tempt her appetite 'as was a long time a-comin' round, and didn't pick up her strength in a 'urry. I used for to go in every day to wash and dress that baby, as was a remarkable fine boy, and throve on the bottle, for I know'd as that squinny-eyed Sarah would treat 'im like a alligator in the water. I could see as Mrs. Watson was 'arfjealous, tho' she never showed it no more than by a-sneerin' about my bein' that clever, and I think the thing as upset her most was me a stoppin' very often to tea with that young couple, thro' Brown being that took up as often didn't get 'ome before ten. Well, in course that fifteen pounds wouldn't last for ever, not with him a-grudging her nothing, and a extra bed-room to pay for, as wasn't that comfortable as I could 'ave wished for him. I says, \"The lady of the 'ouse, as is Mrs. Watson, don't know much about it. But,\" I says, \"while there's life there's 'ope.\" \"Oh,\"hesays, \" confound it, don't preach ; let me see her. I must get more advice. She mustn't die.\" I says, \" As you please about advice ; but, \" I says, \"what ever you do, don't go a-rushin* in there for to fluster her, as the least thing might upset fatal.\" \" Has she asked for me?\" he says. \"Not exactly,\" I replies, \"but 'as seemed that restless and fidgety, but not a taking much notice not even of her infant, as is a fine boy.\" \" Oh !\" he says, \"bother the infant.\" I says, ' ' Wouldn't you like to see it while I goes and sees if she's awake?\" \" No,\" he says, \" I can't bear children.\" I says, \" It's a pity then as you settled.\" He give a toss of his head and twirled his moustache, as there wasn't much on, for I should say two-and-twenty was his outside, and as thin as a lath. I do think as his comin' saved her, for when I went to the bedside and said in a low tone, a-seein' as she was awake, as there was somebody come to see her, she turns round and says, \" Oh, let me see him, let me see him !\" So I says, \" If you'll promise for to keep quiet, you shall ;\" and so I called him in, and run out of the room myself, not for to intrude upon them. She mended from that 'our, and would take everything as he give her, and I must say a kinder young man I never see, tho' he never took to the baby ; and it's well as he didn't, for he hadn't no more idea of 'oldin' it than Miss Biffin, as hadn't no arms, and if a family, must 'ave carried 'em in her mouth, like our cat, as would dash their 'eads agin' the ban nisters, as they didn't seem to mind, but wouldn't never suit a infant. He says to me on the day arter that very day as he come, \" Mrs. Brown, I can't say how obligated I am to you, as the doctor tells me 'as saved her life.\" I says, \"Oh, don't mention it, sir, pray.\" \"Well,\" he says, \" I feel as I can speak to you, and you'll escuse me a troublin' you with my affairs, but,\" he says, \" I'm in a great difficulty, and feel I've brought ruin on that sweet angel in the other room.\" I says, \"Sir, bein' of a gentleman, you will in course do the thing as is right, for I'm sure you ain't one to stoop to such a act as young Cooper, as is our grocer's son, and got 'Liza 'Arris to run away, with him, and then deserted her base, thro' not bein' married proper, in a false name, and her a standin' on the wrong side of the halter, as ain't lawful.\" So the young gentleman he smiled and says, ' ' Oh, it's all right,\" he says ; \"we was married over in France.\" I says, \"Oh, indeed !\" not a-fancyin' them French mar riages, as may 'old good the same as Gretna Green did used to, as a lady I know'd found to her sorrer in a runnin' away with the groom, and married over there by the blacksmith, as was kep' for the purpose, and couldn't never get rid on him, as was a beastly sot, and would drink rum by the gallon in the drawin'-room, and smoke a short pipe, and not even use the coal-scuttle, with muddy boots on the yaller satin sofa, and the music stool at her 'ead if she uttered a single syllabub, with langwidge as would make a dustman blush for to own to. , , I should say, afore the month was up, as he'd raised money up to near thirty pounds on his rings and pins. So I couldn't 'elp sayin' to him the last time as he asked me to get 'im something on his coral studs as had diamonds in 'em, I says, \"Sir, escuse me, but this can't never last,\" Isays, \"and all very well at a pinch, but not to live on, for, \" I says, ' ' I never let Brown rest till we got that tea-pot out, as,\" I says, \"interest is a thing as will eat you thro' and thro' in no time, and brings many to the workus, for I've know'd them my self as would go on a-payin' and a-payin' for years, and lose everything after all.\" He says, \"Oh, I shall get some money soon.\" I says, \" Whatever you do, don't go a borrowin' at them loan societies, for,\" I says, \"it's downright ruin, for there was poor Mrs. Casseris sold up thro' it, and never see the money, not a farthin' on it, as was ten pounds as she 'ad to receive, and had got the paper all right, as was to be paid off by the week, and only borrowed to furnish her two pair back as she never could let, and no wonder neither, for swarming ain't the word for them walls. Well I remembers her a losin' of it, for I'd dropped in for a cup of tea, and she was a sayin', \"Whoever can I get to go as far as Clerkenwell this evening for to receive it,\" she says, \" only young Peterson ?\" as 'is mother is a laundress, just opposite. I says, \" Well, do as you please, Mrs. Casseris, in course ; but,\" I says, \"I should say as that young man ain't one as I should trust myself.\" She says, \" He'd never wrong me, fork's often and often as I've giv'd him a meal \u2014 downright destitute \u2014 and his own mother shet the door on 'im.\" \"Well,\" I says, \"it's my opinion as that young man would take away a poor child's bread and butter, as the sayin' is ; for I know'd im well, a canting young thief, as come to my place only with some manglin', and took a old-fashioned silver snuff-box off the chimbly-piece, while a-waitin' for his basket, as I couldn't never bring 'ome to 'im.\" I don't know how it was, but Mrs. Casseris she seemed set on sendin' that young fellow for the money ; and so she did. I left her about eight for to go 'ome to Brown, and just on ten in she come to my place, as white as a sheet, to say he hadn't never come back ; and what was she to do? Brown, he says, \"Go to the police;\" and so she did; but law, they couldn't do nothing for her, nor yet the magistracy the next day, as told her it were only a breach of trust, as she must put up with ; and so she did, and brought to Stepney Work house, as I've seen her myself in the dress, and thankful for a cup of tea, as 'ad once a good business down by 'Ackney Road in the hardware line. That young gentleman he smiles, and says quite pleasant as he wouldn't try that, but must get money somehow. \" Well,\" I says, \"so must we all ; and as long as it's come by honest, nobody can say a word ; but,\" I says, \"in course y*>u've good friends?\" \" Well,\" he says, \"that's true ; but,\" he says, \" I must be off with my rigiment. \" I says, \"You don't mean as you've been and 'listed?\" \" No,\" he says ; \"I'm 'ome on leave, and must go back to Ingy next month.\" He goes on, that young gentleman, to say as he was short of cash, as I thought he must be, for he said as he'd been out of town for to raise the money, and all for nothing. 1^ see as he was a-drivin' at something, for he 'ammered and stammered, and at last he says, \" Mrs. Brown, escuse me, but did ever you pawn anything ?\" I says, \"Yes, and ain't a bit ashamed of it, as was my dear mother's silver tea-pot as I put away for three pounds for to make the money as Brown was bound for to that Joe Willis, together with his brother-in-law in the name of Barnes, as was twelve pounds of a loan society, and put a execution in our place, as was obligated for to be paid out on the spot, for I never could have laid down in my bed with sich a thing 'angin' over my 'ead. So says the young gentleman, \"Can you tell me what I could get lent me on this?\" a putting of his watch and chain on the table, as was solid goid."], [52, "42 THE \"FIFE ALLS.\" I says, \"She'll never be able for to bear the journey.\" He says, \"That's what I think ; and I don't see how I could take her, for,\" he says, \"it'll be a bit of a struggle to get back myself, and where to leave her, or what to do, I don't know.\" \"Oh I\" I says, \"all safe;\" and gets it out of my corner drawer; and when we opens it, there was wrote \u2014 \"Mrs. Brown, in case of an emergency, apply to General Cameron.\" And then 'is address was give up, near a grand square up at the West-end. \" But,\" I says, \" whatever is a emergency, Brown?\" \"Why,\" he says, \"anythir.k as 'appens sudden in pur tikler.\" \"Then,\" I says, \" this is something sudden and purtikler, if he's drownded, as I was a dreamin' about water myself only last night, thro' our pipes a-bustin' with the 'ard frost, and a sudden thaw settin' in.\" I says, \"She'll know it her self, (or she'll 'ave the Indy paper this very evening, and will read it the moment as the boy brings it, for she'll take it in her self thro' 'er urry.\" And just as I was a speakin', that paper boy come, as if by magic, with a ring as made me pretty nigh jump out of my skin ; and afore I could get up the stairs, she was at the door. Well, I didn't know what to do, but stood a listenin' ever so long ; and at last I heerd a lump like anyone a fallin' dead weight, as the sayin' is, and runs into the room, and there she was on the hearthrug in a faint. So I puts her on the sofy, and she soon comes round, but only to go off ag'in. I calls to Brown to fetch Mr. Simkins, for I found as winegar was useless, and hartshorn only made her nearly stifled. When Mr. Simkins come in we got her to bed, and he said as he was afraid of her mind, as never was strong, I should say ; for tho' no 'arm about her, she was more like a gal than a married woman, as was no doubt thro' bein' brought up French, as is very foolish in their ways, we all knows. I'm sure I'm right when I says as she raved werry nigh all night long, a-sayin' as she must go to him, and all manner like that ; but she got a little more calmer towards morning, and fell off for a bit, and then Brown, he says to me, ' ' Look here, Martha, this wont never do ; we must find out this General, and you'd better doit at once.\" \"Well,\" I says, \"p'raps I 'ad, but I must get a little rest, and will go this arternoon if she keeps quiet, \" and went for to lay down, and didn't get disturbed till jest on one, when Mr. Simkins come in, and Mrs. Challin, as 'ad been a watchin' her still a-sleepin' with constant moans. I talked it over with Brown that night, for thro' the death of a aunt of his we'd come into a bit of property, and was a goin' to move to Stepney Green, as, tho' not a large 'ouse, was more than we wanted ; so we agreed as she might 'ave our front rooms, thro' Jane bein' married, and 'Liza in place, and my Toe gone off to Canady. If ever you see a young couple pleased, it was them two, when I said as I'd take her in ; for it was only till he could get out there, and send for her, as wouldn't be more than three months at the outside. Mrs. Watson, she was very much put out, for she said as I'd been and underminded her with her lodgers ; but I says to her, \" Mrs. Watson, now it's a action as I'd scorn, as don't require lodgers ; but,\" I says, \" 1 shouldn't never 'ave thought on sich a thing as offerin' her my rooms if it hadn't been as you said as you'd not 'ave her left on your 'ands.\" But I know what put her out ; it was that young gentleman a-comin' in with money as she thought penniless, and a payin' her off, as 'ad been downright rude to 'im over a scuttle of coals, and sent her up a chop as black as a hat, and raw at the bone. I don't think as ever I shall forget them young people a' partin' in my front parlour ; for I see the tears trickle down his cheeks, and she reg'lar broke down on the sofy. He shook 'ands with me 'arty, and says, \"Mrs. Brown, if any thing should 'appen, you'll find directions in this packet, \u2014 I means if she should want anything in a 'urry.\" Off he went, and for many days she was dreadful low, but set to work at her baby's things, as she could embroider beautiful, but no workwoman I could see ; and as to cuttin' out, didn't know 'ardly 'ow to 'old the scissors. He wrote to her from Southampton, and then ag'in from some foreign part, and then she didn't 'ear for some time ; but at last a letter come, as proved that one as he had wrote never hadn't turned up. And the wonder is to me 'ow ever a bit of a letter ever finds its way thro' all them places, with out gettin' lost or stole. Them letters was life to her ; but she didn't get on as I could wish, and I used for to ketch her a sheddin' tears fre quent. So Mr. Simkins says \"She may rave ag'in. Not as I think as she will, but we must try to get her to take something, or she may slip thro' our fingers ;\" and as there was some beef tea in the 'ouse, made that good as you might throw it over the 'ouse, as the sayin' is, for strongness, I did get down a tablespoon or so. Then I dresses myself comfortable with my Angola shawl and a black velvet bonnet, and my Coburg cloth, as looked andsome, being just come in, and all the rage, as the sayin' is. I wasn't off till jest on three, but got the Stratford 'bus, as takes you to Regency Street, and that Geniral not a-livin' far off. So I says to her one day, ' ' Escuse me, mum, but you didn't ought to fret.\" She says, \"Mrs. Brown, I'm very wretched.\" I says, \"Whatever about?\" I says, \"I 'opes as you finds yourself comfortable, tho' the dumbly will smoke in a north-east wind, and only swept the week afore last.\" \" Oh, \" she says, \"I'm quite comfortable; but,\" she says, \"I'm afraid as my 'usband is too poor for to send for me.\" ' ' Well, \" I says, ' ' patience is a wirtue, as the sayin' is ; and p'raps he will be in time, so keep a good 'art. \" And so she did, till one day, just afore Christmas, just as her baby was six months, and been short-coated a foitriight, when she says to me, \"Mrs. Brown, I don't know what to do for money, for, \" she says, ' ' my husband 'asn't sent me none, and I've only a few shillin's left.\" She'd settled up with me a month before, and 'ad paid the gal as looked arter the baby. So I says, \"As far as I goes, mum, don't worret yourself; I can wait, and no doubt you'll 'ear soon.\" But she didn't, and weeks went on, and it was as much as I could do for to get 'er to 'ave her meals, as wasn't much more than a bird could eat, and not the least dainty ; and as to the baby, baked flour was his subsistency, as he'd gulp down like a whirlpool \u2014 and a finer-limbed boy I never see, and as 'ard as brawn. I'm sure the time as that 'bus took to get to Regency Street did seem a hage, as the sayin' is. But whatever can you espect for sixpence, as would 'ave cost five or six shillins' when 'ackney coaches was all the go? And I think I got a bit of a nap up in the corner, for we seemed to get there all of a sudden at last. That Geniral's 'ouse wasn't no great shakes to look at, so I rung the bell for servants, a-feelin' as I wasn't quite a wisitor, and a young fellow he opens it and asks my pleasure. I says \" It is not pleasure as I'm come about, but,\" I says, \"p'raps may prove pain to them as least espects it.\" So he says, \"What are you a-preachin' about?\" I says, \" I ain't a-preachin', but only Wants for to see the Geniral, your master.\" He says, \"You're drunk, it's my opinion. I ain't no master a Geniral, for my master's a missus.\" So I says, \"Stop a bit !\" and out I pulls my letter. I says, \" Pray isn't that the address ?\" \"No,\" he says, a lookin' at it ; \"that's the other side of the square \u2014 Upper Brook Street.\" I says, \" I begs pardon, I'm sure, \"and he only says, \"All right,\" and off I goes to that Upper Street. But why ever they can be so foolish as to talk about upper streets I can't make out, as ain't no more upper than they're under, but all in a straight line. The real Geniral's house was a deal grander than the wrong one as I went to, and the footman was in livery at the door, as a carriage drove up just as I got there, and out got two ladies. It was jest on February, when, one day, she was pretty nigh wild with no letters from 'im, and she says, \"I don't know where to make no inquiries about 'im.\" So Brown, he says, that werry arternoon, as soon as he '.vas come in, \" Martha, did ever you hear the name of his rigiment?\" I says, \"No.\" \"Well,\" he says, \"there's a Leeftenant Cameron, I've seen in the paper, as 'as been drownded over there, a crossin' of a river. \" I says, \"Don't say so, Brown ; it will be 'her death.\" And then I says, \"If its true, what is to be done? 'Ow about that letter as h* give me?\" \" What letter ?\" says Brown. So I told him about me a gettin' a letter from him the day as he went off. He says, \" Where 'ave you put it?\""], [53, "MRS. BROWN'S LODGERS. 43 I says to the footman, \" Can I see the Geniral?\" He says, \" He won't be home for a 'our or more. \" \"Well then,\" I says, \" I'll wait.\" \"You'd better call ag'in,\" says the fellow, and shets the door in my face. I says, ' ' There's manners for 'air powder and black v.elwet smalls !\" but walks away, and got myself a glass of '.. arm ale and a biscuit ; for tho' there was a thaw, it was that clinging cold as I felt, tho' well wrapped up. I give that Geniral a good 'our, and then back I goes, and that fellow said, \" He ain't come in !\" And just as I was a-tumin' away, up come a old figger in a cab, as proved to 'ue 'im. So I ups and says, \" Escuse me, sir, but I wants a word or two with you.\" He says, \"What is it?\" very short. So I says, \" It's a concernin' of your son as has been in Ingy.\" He says, \"I've no son in Ingy.\" I says, ' ' You aven't ?' ' \" No,\" says he. I says, \"Do you know that 'andwritin' ?\" a showin' him the bit of paper. \"Ah,\" he says, \"that's my rascally nephew's scrawl! What made him send you here ?\" \"Well,\" I says, \" prehaps as it would be as well for to speak of them things in private.\" He says, ' ' Step in here, my good woman, \" and I follows Iiim into a dingy room, where two wax candles was a-burnin' .n the table. He didn't take off his boots, tho' his slippers was afore the fire, but stood with his back to it, and says, \u25a0 ' Set down !\" arter she buried him, and come into three thousand pounds, as they emigrated with, and 'as done weU ever since, thro' a takin' to farmin', as is ealthy, tho' not to my tastes.\" So she says, \"You're very good to comfort me, but I don't feel any hope.\" So a wantin' to break good news gentle, I says, \"You never can believe 'arf them newspapers says, for I never shall forget the turn it give me a seein' my own death in the paper, tho' not my age for three years ; but there it was, Martha Brown, as plain as a pikestaff, as the sayin' is, tho' never lived at Nottin'-'ill in my life, and was, of course, some one else, and I'm sure the things as they've put in about me, a sayin' as I was a low character, and give to drink, on Pen tonwille-'ill, not many weeks ago.\" She says, \" Ah ! but such news as that is never false.\" Well, jest as we was talkin' quiet, me a-sayin' as I didn't think as it was true, the postman he come, as 'ad brought back a letter as he'd come with in the day, and wouldn't leave without the money, thro' bein' a stranger and me out, and I see at once it was one of them Injin letters. I paid the shillin' cheerful, but when I come to look at it I see as it must 'ave been wrote some time, and didn't know what to do about givin' it to her, as was too weak to read it ; but as luck would 'ave it, in come Mr. Simkins, and he's quite the scholar, of course, and looks at them marks at the back of the letter, as I never know'd meant anything, and he says, \"Why, this left Bombay arter the date of that drownin' in the paper ; and,\" he says, \" I'll risk givin' it her ;\" and so he did, for he went upstairs and broke it to her gentle as there was a letter, and took and read it to her. And a good letter it proved, too ; not only a sayin' as he was safe and well, but had money in it ; and it's lucky as them nigger post-offices over there didn't know it, for they'd been and bagged two a'ready as did ought to 'ave come to her. Well, of course she was soon all right, tho' two or three days afore she could set up and read that letter all reg'lar, and then she read it to me, as said she was to come to him at once, but for to leave the boy behind, as the climate wouldn't suit ; \u2014 nor more it would, I'm sure, for that boy will 'ave a struggle yet with his back teeth, as is that fractious now as there ain't no puttin' 'im about.\" It was a 'ard struggle for her ; and she says, \" My husband writes, ' If that dear good creature, Mrs. Brown, will be bothered with him, we shall both be satisfied ;' and, \" she says, a-turnin' to me, \"I'm sure there's no one else on earth as I would leave him with. Will you keep him ?\" I says, ' ' That I will, my dear.\" So at last she wrote to say as she'd come and feave 'im behind, as Mr. Simkins said Ingy would be certain death to 'im, and with that she seemed satisfied. Just three days arter that were settled there come a double rap at the door, as made my heart come into my mouth, as the sayin' is, and if there wasn't that old Geniral, as says, \" Is Mrs. Cameron at home?\" I says, \"Yes.sir.\" \"Ah,\"hesays, \"Mrs. Brown, is that you ? I hardly knowed you again without your bonnet,\" as puts amanyyears on the 'ead veryoften, as is well known. I says, \" I am that party ; but, \" I says, \"Mrs. Cameron ain't quite up to no visitors yet, tho' much better. \" \" Oh, \" he says, ' ' she'll see her uncle ;\" and he was a loud-talkin' old gen tleman, so she 'eard 'im, and rung the bell, thro' bein' still on the sofy. I puts me 'ead in at the door, and she says, \" Show 'im in, \"and I did; but, lawblessyou, there wasn't no cringin' about her, for she received him stately like, and afore I left the room I heerd 'im say, \" Mrs. Frank Cameron, I've come to apologize,\" but I didn't hear no more, for a-knowin' my place, I withdrawed myself away immediate. He stopped 'arf a 'our at the least, and see the baby, as he called a bouncer ; and I must say as the boy do a credit to tops and bottoms, as I've put him on lately, and begins for to crawl a'ready, tho' throwed back'ard thro' his teeth, as makes him one constant dribble. It turned out as her good gentleman was very near drowned, tho' as he didn't mention nothin' about it in his letter, as was foolishness, for he might 'ave knowed as them fools in the papers would go a-talkin' about it, the same as they did once as about Brown bein' caught in a fly-wheel, as nearly was my death, a neighbour a comin' in open-mouthed for to tell me, and turned out to be nothin' but a black boy ; and the Geniral come a purpose for to say how they'd been mistook about her as that young scamp had run away with, tho' I must say as I couldn't be angry with neither, as he was a 'andsome young chap, and she as pretty a gal as I'd wish to see, but no doubt very wrong in runnin' away, as frightened the good ladies as was a-educatin' on her pretty near to death, as couldn't make it So I did, and he eyed me over, and says, ' ' Well, now, your business?\" I begins by a-mentionin' 'avin' heerd say as Leeftenant Cameron was drownded. \" No such luck,\" says he. I says nothin', but goes on for to tell him about that poor thing at my 'ouse ; but, law bless you, he didn't hear aie two minutes afore he bust out in a rage, saying : \u2014 ' ' 'Ow dare you come here intrudin' on me with your cock and-bull stories about females as is deserted, as they can only expect? \" I says, \" Sir, you'll escuse me, as isa married woman, and mother of five, three livin', and two in Stepney churchyard ; but I am not one as would 'ave come here to pester you about no females, as I do not consider is any worse than the men, but p'raps the better; but,\" I says, \"this lady is a lady Ijred and born, and the lawful wife of that leeftenant ; least ways, as much as any one can be in the French way ; for I knows as it's all square, thro' the minister as christened the little boy, as was French hisself, a-seein' of her lines, and a-sayin' they was all right.\" Well, that old fellow he got a purple in the face. \"What,\" he says, \"married, and got a son? Why, you must be mistaken, as you was about the drownin', as I knows is wrong, for he was saved by a native, tho' supposed to 'ave perished.\" I says, \"Are you sure as he's saved?\" He says, \"Certain ; I've just heard it at the club.\" I jumps up and says, \" I don't care a straw for nothin , then. I'll go back and tell her, as will save her life, and I'm sure he's as good as gold, and will never let her want.\" \"Stop,\" says the old gent; \"are you any relation of hers ?\" I says, \"Me a relation! Why, she's a lady bred and horn, I tell you, and only a-lodging with me, thro' friends l.ein' that 'ard-'arted as wouldn't elp him ; but,\" I says, \"I must go.\" , \u00abo he says, ' ' Where do you live ? \"Well,\" I says, \"Stepney Green, just round the corner, as ;s a white house with green shatters, as any one will tell you ;\" and out of the 'ouse I goes all of a fluster. When I got 'ome I found her much the same, and so shewent on for all the next day, very dozy like ; but towards evening she was a good deal better, and seemed much more calmer like and took her tea quite reasonable, and at last she says,\u2014 \"Mrs. Brown,\" a speakin' low, \" I don't think as I m long Tor this world ; and.\" she says, \" now he's gone, what is to oecome of my boy?\" . , I savs, \"My dear young lady, don t you go a-takin on about nothing ; remember, when one door shets, another opens and\" I says, \"them as does what is right ain t never 'forsook, as we all knows ; for look at Mrs. Cundy, as was left with eleven, and her own uncle died the werry day"], [54, "the \u25a0\u25a0 t \u2022in; alls.\" 44 far, and mangoes and all manner. And the boy. he's nearly three now, and there's two more in Ingy, as must come 'ome, but they hopes to bring 'em themselves in two years. And the Geniral, he comes to see the boy, and give me quite a turn last time a-talkin' about his bein' nearly old enough to go to school. And the ladies, they comes, too, and had him once to spend the day ; but, bless you, he was a dose \u2014 not as ever I lets him break nothing, nor go on wiolent any more than I did my Joe ; but he's a child as will shout and hollar, as I considers a sign of health, and don't check when he's at play, as is very well in Stepney, but don't suit the West-end. I found out why as they're civil to him, and no wonder, as must come into all the property some day, as that old Geniral couldn't help, if he wished it ever so, thro' havin' no son, it's bein' all in a tail, as the sayin' is. So, arter all, you never can tell 'ow things will turn out ; and as to Mrs. Watson, she won't speak, even in passion, and her worst word is too good for me \u2014 not as it signifies, thro' our bein' that com fortable, as no one can say as we did it for money ; but she's a green-eyed monster for jealousy, as the savin' is, and I'm sure the life as she led that Sarah is like gallows-slave's ; and no wonder as she bolted with the pot-boy, as is that bandy as you could tell 'im a mile oft\", and I'm sure I pities them, as'll pretty soon find out their mis takes, \u2014 but it might 'ave been wuss. But that's 'ow it is as I come to have the care of that child, as seems to me to grow that fast as you can see 'im a shootin' up, as his father is over six feet in his socks. Dal thro' bein' nuns, and no father nor mother, and only a aunt by marriage, as treated her unkind, and quite the lady, as I knaw'd, the moment I see her.

A Legend of Leicestershire. By Henry Savile Clarke. fytte the first. IR EDAVARD TUR- VI LE, a Leicester- shire swell, Had a daughter, the love- liest Leicestershire belle ; She was high-born, of course, for her family then. As it is to this day, was an old race of men. And though Leicester- shire boasts, Of old houses in hosts, Though it pales before Cheshire, in that, I must say, Amid Famham and Bat- ington, Beaumont, and Grey \u2014 Earls of Stamford and Warrington, hight to this day, The Turviles ranked high, none were nobler than they. When young AValter Beaumont declared he would go Fair Edith was plunged in the wildest of woe ; She sobbed like a baby, and pulled at her hair. Till she found it was rather unpleasant to tear ; And had thoughts as the tears glimmered bright on her lashes, Of wrapping herself up in sackcloth and ashes ; But saw on reflection, That deepest dejection, Though very effective in smart robes of black Would fail when a lady was dressed in a sack, To bring out those shades of fine feeling in man That she meant to evoke. For on hearing the plan Of hard-hearted Walter she went to the cell Of Francis the friar, her troubles to tell. Father Francis, her uncle, was jolly and stout, . And welcomed his niece with stentorian shout : \" How now, pretty Edith, what brings you?\" he said, ' ' To my lonely retreat, thus down-hanging your head ? Has a man been insulting the rose of our race ? If he has just point out, \u2014 I reside at this place, And though tonsured and old I can give him a whack That'll make the churl measure his length on his back !\" But fair Edith she sighed and said sadly \"Ah, no, I have not been insulted, but uncle, dear, \u2014 Oh ! Say, what shall I do, of my tears in despite, Now Walter has gone with King Richard to fight !\" The monk he looked down, And the monk he looked up, And he dipped with a frown, A red nose in a cup That was filled to the brim with the best Q-prus wine, And he said, \" My advice is, niece Edith of mine, If your lover has flown, why, by Saint Kafoozleum, AVe'll follow and fight \u2014 Let's be off to Jerusalem !\" \" Ah yes, but my mother !\" \"Your mother ! oh, bother ! I'll put that all right,\" the stout friar replied, \" I'll ' make up' as a squire and a-near you will ride, While you shine as a gallant and debonnair knight, You ride well, have some pluck \u2014 'twill be jolly to fight, AVe'll polish off Paynims, you'll see, by the score, And show Master Walter a trick or two more Than he wots of, \u2014 so, niece, get that suit from Milan, And rig yourself out as a charming young man. \" And Miss Edith Turvile was stately and fair, -She'd the winsomest eyes and a glory of hair. Not disfigured by chignons, false plaits, or frisettes, The vile things that in these days disfigure our pets : But it curled very well, Was quite au naturel, . As the oyster should be that is now so expensive ; It hung down behind, To the kiss of the wind, And waved o'er her shoulders in ringlets extensive. So lovely a maiden you'll very soon see, Had lovers and suitors of every degree. Her old nurse declared she'd a good ' ' baker's dozen, \" And yet she was madly in love with her cousin, Young Walter, the idol of Leicestershire maids, Who was off, so they said, \" to those nasty Crusades.\" And you know that crusading was one of the ways, In which noble and rampant young men of those days, God rid of their ennui ; it wasn't a trifle, men Said to go east ; \u2014 just as now we turn riflemen."], [55, "EDMUND EVANS.

And she looked, as she was, just the prettiest pet In all Leicestershire ; then, with fluttering heart, She said, smiling, \" Dear uncle, in two days we'll start !\" And she just put her lips to the wine, and the toast Was, ' ' Good luck to the war with the Saracen host !\" But at length the fight was ended, and the serried lines extended Round the towers which they defended were all scattered o'er the plain, And they gave the wreath of honour, which her flashing sword had won her, To the maiden, gazing on her as they sought her rank in vain. Just two days after this came a grand cavalcade O er the drawbridge, strong knights in coat-armour arrayed, Men-at-arms and esquires, churls and villeins, and there 'Neath a gonfanon bearing the chevronels vair, At the head of them all men saw Edith the fair. She rode on, clad in mail ; then, too, close by her side Came the stout Father Francis, a charger astride, With a two-handled sword, he had sumamed \" Goodworks,\" And proclaimed that therewith he would tickle the Turks. So the battle was over, and Walter that Little knew the young knight was his fax* fiancee, And joined in the praises and shouts of acclaim, That after the onset men gave to the fame Of the young stranger knight, Who'd been first in the fight ; And for many days more when the Musselmen came, She fought well for the cross, and no man told her name. Sir Everard stood on the battlements high, And he bared his grey head to the wind and the sky, 'Twas such flowing grey hair that few men could twig That the lordly old Turvile made use of a wig. And he bid them \"Good speed ;\" while his lady, she cried, Till a tear ran down into the moat ; and men spied Where it fell on a fish, and they say that fish died! Now backward to England we hasten again, To Sir Everard thinking on Edith with pain, For she used to protect her poor henpecked papa, From the fearful assaults of her vicious mamma ; And Sir Everard's head since she'd gone to the wars, Lady T.'s nimble fingers had covered with scars. Again Castle Turvile was gay, and bedight With banners and standards and pennoncelles bright, From every hall in the county men came FYTTE THE SECOND. Now rises the curtain on scenes far away From old England and Leicestershire battlements grey. It rises on deserts where palm trees upspring, And turbaned Muezzins, and that sort of thing, Are quite common objects like those on the shore, Mr. Wood bids young ladies poke out and explore. We see the whole place full of curious men ; it Is proper to wear not a Lincoln and Bennett, But sport a huge Khizzilbash turban that's wound Like a very thick scarf your os frontis around. There are Turks there in plenty, but far on the plain See a banner whose blazon we welcome again. The host of our pet Edith Turvile has come, O'er sea and o'er land from her Leicestershire home, And with old Father Francis, they're camped on the right Of Walter de Beaumont, who's ready for fight The men of those days called Moohummedans hounds (I flatter myself that long word's oriental, 'Tis a queer way of spelling, I know it, but zounds It looks eastern, and so I'm entirely content), al- Though why they miscalled them, when mortals arn't dogs, I can't say. We've connected a Frenchman with frogs Far too often, in just the same manner of old, Our insular cheekiness making us bold. Such a name, you'll agree, was by no means polite, And they found, to their cost, that the said hounds could bite, So when Norman and Saracen mingled in strife, 'Twas a task tar from easy to get oft with life, For the Mussulman's falchion was tempered and true, As the one with which Saladin sundered in two To welcome the maid with a warrior's fame ; And a herald proclaimed that a tourney should be Held next day at the castle, when all men should see, That the pumps in the court-yard should run with red wine, To honour the heroes who'd won Palestine. And to grace this said tourney young Walter, of course, Who'd come back, would adventure his life and his horse ; For he'd asked for his Edith, and curtly been told That he'd see at the tourney the tresses of gold, And his lady's bright eyes, and could bow him in duty, As others would do to the high Queen of Beauty. The day dawned fair, And upon the air Came a thundering sound of trumpets and drums From the lists, that proclaims when a brave knight comes ; And heralds and jongleurs and head fools in motley, Are singing, or dancing, or else swearing hotly. No race than the Turviles is braver \u2014 the chance is A tap on the head from the sly Father Francis, Reminds the blasphemer that Holy Church keeps One eye on her children, though t'other one sleeps. Young Walter pricks forward, the clarions sound, And curvets, caracoles, makes a demi-volte round, And the heralds proclaim, As they shout out his name, What, with just the addition of one trumpet note, Means simply, \"Who'll tread on the tail of his coat?'' Other knights gallop forward, they're plucky enough, But De Beaumont gives each of his lance quantum sufj'.. And they roll on the ground with a terrible clatter. Mayhap some bones broken, but what does that matter ! The veil in the Talisman, teste Sir Walter, Who ne'er at a tale of such wonders would falter. And now were the fates not extremely propitious, Our friends were in danger \u2014 the Moslem looked vicious, And rolled up the whites of his tea-saucer eyes, You've seen a strange horse do the same when he shies. Young Walter de Beaumont had marshalled his men And the Turk did the same ; there was little care then For the talk of the camp or amusements, they tried To kill time as they stayed on the bare desert side. ;ch in attendance a skilful concocter Of potions is ; leech is their name for the doctor. Now again trumpets sound, And young Walter turns round. For he sees on a charger of orthodox white, The very identical peerless young knight He'd seen in the Holy Land first in the fight ! And he looked up to Edith, no Edith was there, In the balcony filled with a crowd of the fair ; So he straight set his teeth, and sat firm on his horse, And came thundering down in the midst of the course. The unknown knight stood firm, but 'ere Walter came near, The Turvile retainers set up a huge cheer, For their knight doffed his helmet before them, and there In the midst of the people stood Edith the Fair ! Little time for idle tattle, for anon began the battle, With a rush and roar and rattle, and the thunder of the fight ; Friend and foeman rushed together, like a flood in winter weather, When the ice has loosed its tether on some dark December night. And fair Edith and stout Francis were the first among the lances, She had often led the dances, and she led the fight that What need to tell more ? They were happy and married, And many small Turviles a grandfather carried. And this line, so men say, You can see to this day O'er Edith, where safe in the churchyard they've laid her, \" Here lies Mrs. Beaumont\u2014 the Female Crusader !\" day ; With a white plume high above her, while a-near her rode her lover, And his thoughts I wot were of her, though he guessed her far away."], [58, "46 \"MY LITTLE SISTER.\" By Frances V. Chilton. He requested that I would have a house comfortably fur nished at his expense, ready to receive her, and named a handsome sum, which he intended to allow me yearly for Lucy's maintenance. He had written to ask the child whether she would rather live with me or her mother's relatives, and she had evinced a marked desire to share my home. THERE certainly was something irresistible about ' ' Charlie Morgan ;\" a halo of confidential friendship seemed to surround him, and before you had known him many hours you found yourself thinking of him as an old friend. I am rather reserved in disposition, but he had only entered our office, and sat at the desk next mine, for a few days, when I invited him to dine with me at my chambers, a mark of attention I had not shown to young Ridley, Charlie's prede cessor, during the two years we had met daily in business, although we always got on very well together. Morgan complimented me on my comfortable quarters, and well he might. My chambers were certainly A. i, and Dawson, my valet, butler, and homme d'afaires generally, was the envy of all the single men of my acquaintance : he was simply perfection. How he would like the change from our present independent mode of living to the formalities and.regular habits which would devolve upon me as the head of a genteel establishment of my own, I hardly dared to contemplate, and I had made up my mind to double his wages sooner than part with this treasure of a servant, when I entered upon my new duties as head of a household. Yes ! these pleasant chambers must be given up. Farewell to the quiet social evenings, with one or two select friends, when neat little oyster suppers closed the enter tainment. When I received this letter, I had been engaged to Margaret for a few weeks only, and the letter announcing to my father the important step I had taken, was on its way to India. My betrothed was delighted at the plan. \"It would be so much nicer for me, \" she said, ' ' to have a bouse, of my own ; I must be so uncomfortable in those chambers.\" I could not very well tell her that I had contemplated sow ing what few wild oats I had left in the six months before I could claim her as my bride ; so I was forced to appear pleased myself at the arrangement, and prepare to settle down into a respectable householder at once. One thing I was determined about ; I would never invite to my house anybody whom I did not mean to introduce to my wife, and by that determination I devoted myself to com parative solitude ; for there were not many frequenters of my chambers who were calculated to shine in ladies' society. Perhaps that was the reason why I was so unusually sociable with Charlie Morgan, who, although he was manly and highly intellectual, was quite a ladies' man ; and there fore I felt that he would make a pleasant addition to our list of visitors when \"Mr.^nd Mrs. Robert Calthorpe were at home.\" Farewell to the choice little dinners, the remembrance of which would live long in the memory of many bachelors. Farewell to many other pleasant things indissolubly asso ciated with chambers, latch keys, and single blessedness ; for already had I signed an agreement with the landlord of a \"family residence\" in Pimlico, bordering upon Belgravia. On the next quarter-day I should take possessiop, my cham bers would know me no more, I should enter upon my career as a \"family-man.\" Of course, you will gather from this that I was about to be married, and will perhaps think me wanting in the ecstacy which at that period of a man's life is supposed to supplant every other feeling, and will consider my regrets as unbecoming a bridegroom-elect. The fact is I was, to a certain extent, jione out of six months of my freedom. I was rather puzzled in my arrangements in my new home for my little sister, and should have made some dreadful blunders but for Margaret's help and advice. For instance, I thought all little school-girls had nurseries, and I intended to furnish a good large room near the top of the house, with toy cupboards, and things of that sort. But Margaret laughed at the idea, and assured me that young ladies of eighteen did not care about dolls. She persuaded me to leave the choosing and arranging of Lucy's rooms to her, and I was only too glad to do so. When she showed me the suite of apartments completely fitted up, the little morning room, boudoir, and bed-room, chaste and pure-looking as an angel's wings, I felt that I had never before done justice to my Margaret's exquisite taste, but I could not help saying, ' ' These rooms seem to me more suitable for some one grown up, than a child.\" If, on the approaching Michaelmas-day, I had been about to conduct my charming Margaret to assume at once her position as mistress of my home and heart, I could have cheerfully drowned my latch-key, and turned my back for ever upon my chambers, without a sigh ; for no boy just out of his teens could have been more ardent in his affection than I, though bordering on my fortieth year. \"Lucy is not a child, Robert,\" she answered, laughing. \" Do you think people are not grown upiintil they are as old as I am?\" But Margaret had promised her aunt, with whom she had lived from her infancy, to stay with her until after her twenty fifth birthday, which would not be until the middle of March, and even if I had been selfish enough to wish her to break that promise, I don't think I could have persuaded her to do so, for she had strong notions of honour, and a promise from Margaret was like a decree of the Medes and Persians. ' ' Why, then, \" you naturally ask, ' ' should you burthen your self with a large establishment six months before you required it ?\" That is just what I am going to explain. My father married again after the death of my mother, and took his bride out to India with him, leaving me his blessing and a good appointment in Somerset House. I was only nineteen then, and as I have already let you into the secret of my age at the time of which I am writing, you will perceive that twenty years had passed since my father's second marriage. He was again a widower ; my step-mother left one child, a daughter, and this little girl was sent to England to be educated, when she was about ten years old, and had re mained ever since in a school at Richmond, where I paid her visits at stated times. I always wrote to my father regularly, giving him all particulars about little Lucy. The child was fond of me, and I of her. She was a good, tractable, little thing, and looked up to me like a father. She spent her holidays amongst her mother's relations, and I always supposed that when her education was finished, she would go to reside with them, or else go out to India to her father. She might say what she pleased, but I could only think of Lucy as a child ; and her pretty little ways, and innocent de light when we took possession of our home, were childlike in the extreme. As she danced in and out of the pretty rooms destined for her use, she was just like a Uttle girl with a new doll's-house. Charlie Morgan was our most frequent visitor. When I was first engaged to Margaret, her aunt gave me to understand that she should be glad to see me three even ings a week, and every Sunday, and although I chafed under these restrictions, there was an impenetrable decision about Aunt Emily's arrangements that no one ever attempted to infringe upon ; so three evenings out of every week were at my own disposal, and when I had contemplated ' ' having my fling\" before my marriage, it was to have been on these evenings when stern fate, in the shape of Miss Emily Mills, forbade my enjoyment of the company of my betrothed. Now, however, that my father's plans had placed me at the head of a family before my time, these evenings would have been insufferably slow but for Charlie ; of course Lucy was a dear, affectionate little creature, but hardly a com panion for grown-up men. When we had lived together for about a month, we were invited to a party given by a friend, in commemoration of his wedding-day, Margaret and I, and Lucy. I asked the latter if she would not rather stay at home. \"There will be no children there but yourself,\" I said ; \"you will perhaps feel uncomfortable.\" However, the wilful child elected to go, and very pretty she looked in her simple white dress, not to be compared, though, with my Margaret, who looked queenly in black lace and scarlet. \u25a0 Great was my surprise, then, on receiving a letter from \" the governor,\" telling me that Lucy was to leave school at Michaelmas, and it was her greatest wish to five with me, and be my little housekeeper"], [59, "\"MY LITTLE SISTER.\" 47 It was a very pleasant evening, though I must confess I am not so fond of dancing as I was ten years ago. We were agreeably surprised at meeting Morgan there ; he was an old Eton chum of our host, it appeared, and I did not know they knew each other. The greatest drawback was that fellow \"Snape\" being there. I never liked that man with his everlasting smile, and gleaming white teeth, and I felt quite uncomfortable when I saw him go up to Lucy and ask her to dance. Charlie Morgan disliked him as much as I did ; and before Lucy could answer Snape, Charlie rushed up to her and said, \"You are engaged for this set, remember,\" and walked her off before the other fellow could get to look at her card to put himself down for a later dance. This insolence overwhelmed me. \" And what of my feelings ?\" I gasped. \"And what is due to me ?\" \"Well, to tell you the truth, Bob, \"he said, \"I thought you would be pleased. I fancied that you felt her rather an incumbrance ; that you regretted your promise to \" If I had stayed in the room another instant, I should have done something rash. I rushed out of the house like a mad man, and ran all the way to Bayswater Square, where Miss Emily Mills resided. I was panting and speechless when I was ushered into Margaret's presence. I was glad to find her alone. I did not wish my little sister to witness the painful scene which I felt was coming. \"Margaret,\" I said, as soon as I could speak, \" I am the most wretched man on the face of the earth. I know all ! I have come straight from Morgan.\" Charlie gave me a sly wink as he passed, which I quite understood, and to reward him for the care he took of the child, I persuaded Margaret to put down two after-supper dances for him. She looked at me as if she thought I was deranged. \"How, in the world, can that make you so miserable, Robert ?\" For my own part, they were short of one at a whist table, so I left my ladies under Charlie's care, and had a quiet rubber. This hypocrisy was the crowning point of the wrong I smarted under. I had to go out of town the next day, and Margaret had invited Lucy to stay with her until I came back. I expected to be away about a fortnight, so they went home together after the party, and I started by an early train for the north. Considering the restrictions which were placed on my visits, I felt rather surprised when Margaret informed me in her first letter that Charlie had called at her aunt's twice since the party. \"I have not deserved this,\" I said, bitterly; \"but your duplicity is useless. Morgan did not even attempt to hide his love.\" The scared look on her face was supplanted by a beaming smile, and her clear honest laugh (so different from Snape's mocking one) convinced me before she spoke that I had made an egregious blunder. \"Why, you dear silly old boy,\" she said, winding her soft arm round my neck, \"it's Lucy that Charlie is in love with, not me.\" I said, when I wrote to her, that I thought he was not wanting in assurance to make so free on so slight an ac quaintance, and that I thought he 'had better have left it alone. \" Lucy!\" I said, \" that child !\" \"Will you never believe, you goose,\" she said, \"that Lucy is a woman ? Why, many a staid young matron, is no older than our little sister ; she will be nineteen next birthday. \" I felt dreadfully ashamed of myself, and so I suppose I ought. I had insulted my best friend, and doubted my own true Margaret ; but I felt now very happy as well as humi liated. To this she answered in her next letter, \" I shall begin to think you have imbibed some of Aunt Emily's prudish notions, Robert, from the way you write of Mr. Morgan. How can you be so ridiculous?\" After this, Charlie's name did not appear in our corres pondence, which was as regular as my visits were when I was in town, so I supposed his calls were discontinued. I returned home by a night train, and went to business the next day, before seeing Margaret or Lucy. Morgan did not make his appearance at the office that day ; he sent a message, that he was confined to the house with a severe cold. Just as I had made up my mind to go back to Charlie and ask, his forgiveness, a servant announced \" Mr. Charles Morgan.\" Yes, he had come, poor fellow, in spite of influ enza ; he could not rest, he said, until he had an explanation of my strange behaviour. He feared, as Margaret had done, that my brain was affected. Satisfactory explanations were soon offered, and full for giveness accorded me by my brother-in-law elect. Then we sent for Lucy, who came in fluttering like a httle bird. I held her in my arms one instant, kissing and blessing her, in my own name and our father's, then handed her over to Charlie, to whose manly breast the little dove clung, as if conscious that there she had found a safe and happy nest for life. Snape came sidling up to me when I was preparing to go home, and said, \"I suppose Charlie couldn't summon up pluck to meet you ? he had no cold yesterday. \" 11 What do you mean, Mr. Snape ?\" I asked indignantly. He looked at me with well-feigned astonishment, and then said \u2014 \" I beg your pardon, but I understood that your sudden absence was owing to Mr. Morgan having supplanted you in the favour of Miss Mills.\" Some hours afterwards Charlie and I were alone together, and I said, \" It seems absurd to me that you can think of Lucy as your wife.\" \" It's you that are absurd, Bob, talking of her as a child. I am on the sunny side of thirty, remember : there is not so much difference between us as between you and Margaret.\" \" By the bye, Charlie, what did you mean by saying you thought I regretted my engagement?\" \" I never said anything of the kind ; I was on the point of saying I thought you regretted your promise to your father about making a home for Lucy when she left school, when you rushed away in that insane manner.\" What a fool I had made of myself, to be sure ! Charlie and I, as well as Lucy, wrote to \"the governor\" by the next mail, and the returning one brought a joyful consent from the old boy to a union which promised such happiness to his darling. I pretended it was owing to me that my father agreed so readily to the match, but I believe in my own heart that no one could have resisted the manly, straightforward letter Charlie wrote to him. We had a double wedding at the end of March, and are now quite old married people ; but though Lucy has two children of her own, when I look at her dimpled face and sunny curls, I can hardly believe even now that my httle sister is grown up. I could have strangled him. as he stood there, with his mocking smile and deferential manner ; but I restrained my self with a violent effort, and said \u2014 \" Have the goodness to leave my affairs alone, Mr. Snape, or I shall feel bound, in honour, to resent your imperti nence.\" \"I am very sorry, I am sure, Mr. Calthorpe,\" he said, humbly; \"but people will talk, 'you know, and the fact of their being always together while you were away \" I turned abruptly on my heel, and left him ; but the last shaft had struck home. Something must be WTong ! If Margaret had not felt that she had no right to receive Morgan's visits in my absence, why had she never named him in her letters ? I was determined to sift the matter before seeing Margaret ; so I went straight to Morgan's chambers, where I found him Ijoking very poorly. His cold was genuine, however false his friendship. He received me very cordially, but I did not respond, and went straight to the point in question, saying \u2014 \" Do you think your conduct during my absence has been strictly honourable, Mr. Morgan?\" He winced a little, and said \u2014 \" I hope so ; I should never have acted as I have done, had I not felt that I was secure of the dear girl's affections.\" V"], [60, "4b ; *Vfl\u00a3 XDVEIffeVRBS OF THE FAMILY NOSE.

WRITTEN AND ILLUSTRATED BY W. S. GILBERT. A RGU M E N T. DON SALLUST, a nobleman attached to the train of Maria, Queen of Spain, has been sentenced to banish ment, in consequence of an intrigue which he has formed with one of the Queen's maids. Don Sallust determines to be revenged on the Queen, and, finding that a footman in his employ, one Ruy Bias, cherishes a mad love for her, he determines to dress him up in magnificent clothes, and pass him off as his cousin, Don C\u00e6sar de Bazan. He does so \u2014 the fictitious Don C\u00e6sar gains great favour at Court, and eventually rises to be Premier of Spain. Don C\u00e6sar, when he was only Ruy Bias, was in the habit of placing a bouquet, every morning in the Queen's bower, together with an anony mous letter, declaring his passion for her. Her curiosity was naturally excited, and on comparing the handwriting in the anonymous letter with that of Don C\u00e6sar, she finds that the two are identical. Ruy declares his love to the Queen, and is on the point of marrying her, when Don Sallust (who has obtained admission to the palace in the disguise of a footman) appears, and produces a paper which he had made Ruy Bias sign before his promotion, and in which Ruy acknowledges his bondage to Don Sallust. Ruy, in horror at the power which Sallust exercises over him by means of this paper, determines to leave the palace, take his own name, and seek a place as footman again. However, Don Sallust is a secret witness to a farewell scene between Ruy and the Queen, and then produces the paper, and explains to the Queen that the man whom she has loved is only a footman. Ruy, stung to madness by Sallust's taunts, challenges him! They fight\u2014 Sallust is killed, and the Queen, delighted with Ruy's behaviour on the occasion, offers him her hand, which he, of course, accepts. DRAMATIS PERSON\u00c6. Don Sallust.

This sounds enigmatical \u2014 but wait, and you'll see. Casilda. The original Maid of Honour. Her berth is Richmond, and unstained her crust. This sounds foolish, but it isn't. Gudiel (his Major Domo). A man with a good deal to look after, and who made yer at home, oh, when you came to stay with his master. Ruy Bias. A Footman in the service of Don Sallust, a steady youth, though accustomed to live-awry, and one who never brought the red plush of shame to the cheek of modesty, because, of course, modesty has no cheek to bring it to. As we are about it, we may remark en passant that he is in love with the Queen of Spain. It's of no consequence, but we just mention it. Don Diego. A scheming Noble, who only occupies the stage for a short wile. Servant. A complicated character (from his last place), which will unravel itself in the course of the piece. We should like to tell you more about him, but if we did, the plot would lose all its interest. V The airs introduced into this burlesque were selected on account of their being for the most part old and hackneyed, and at the tip of everybody's tongue.

ERMAN beer is cele- the drummers, sappers and miners, the conductor of the brass band and his accomplished son, who officiated on the serpent. The cavalry was limited, being only ten sabres \u2014 the horse patrol, in fact, occupying that important position ; but, as the Duchy was very hilly, this branch of the army was of less importance. The Cabinet Council was presided over by the Chancellor of the Duchy, HerrStrippenflayen, a thin, atrabilious man, with green spectacles, but of gigantic intellect, and an excellent accountant. The Duchy being deeply in debt, owing to the Thirty Years' War, this really great creature conceived that the Duke might derive a large revenue Irom taking the whole brewing of the Duchy into his high and puissant management, and gain a great increase of income by selling inferior beer at a higher price. The people might grumble ; but the inferior creatures were sent to serve man, and poor people were, every one knew, sent to work for the rich, and to minister to royal pleasure. The Duke being a philosopher, saw at once the profound wisdom (the greatest things are always simple) of the Chan cellor's new system of finance. The Duke himself was a dis coverer \u2014 but in a different world ; he devoted his royal time to the opera and to scientific pursuits. It was he who discovered the high-pressure steam and electric mouse-trap, and the remarkable hydrostatic boot-jack ; above all, he founded, while bathing at Heligoland, the Oleaginous Anti-shipwreck salvage Company, of which his Highness is still the only paid director. His system is to diffuse from the sides of vessels during a storm, a regulated current of cod-liver oil (this is selected from its peculiar specific gravity). This current, breathed out. as it were, by slow-working steam-pumps, with horizontal duplex pistons and bivalvular-pedal action, spreads over the nearest waves, reduces them in magnitude, and calms the circumambient sea in such a remarkable manner that the ship is always safely surrounded as it pro gresses, with a smooth, level, and undisturbed plain of water. This has been pronounced by Professor Pepper as the most extraordinary discovery since the use of burnt horse-beans instead of coffee ; and the professor only just wishes he could introduce the Atlantic Ocean and the Duke's experiment at the Polytechnic. The Duke, suffering from want of money, as one or two eminent men have, as we are told by history, done before him, consented to accept the monopoly of brewing. To brew beer without his licence, and except as his agent, was to in cur the penalty of imprisonment for life in the fortress of Ratzenmausen, on the inaccessible precipices of the Hardup pen mountains. To his faithful partner, for her pin money the generous Duke gave the right to alone print and sell the Government beer labels : Crest\u2014 a closed fist or hand, couped at the wrist ; Motto \u2014 Dakecareobihrtaschen, which means in English, the wise man takes care of himself. All the barley of the Duchy was bought for the Duke at a fixed price ; the size of the ducal pint was fixed by him ; the ducal beer houses smoked all over the Duchy, and the Rhine itself could not have held the beer annually brewed in that thirsty and well-regulated Duchy. All was peace, contentment, and high prices. But suddenly the Demon of Revolution, the Atropos of political discontent, deliberately struck a lucifer, and with grinning malice lighted the torch of discord. A Marat, as the one party called him, a William Tell, as the London Daily Cyclops denominated him, appeared ; and in his train \u2014to use the language of the court historian \u2014 came ruin, bankruptcy, assault and battery, one might also say, uni versal and indiscriminate intoxication. A serious loss to Baden (owing to the defalcation of a deputy croupier) had compelled the Duke to raise the price of beer one groschen a gallon. This bejng found still inadequate, the Chancellor suggested a tax of the thousandth part of ,n pfennig on every pint of beer drunk. The night this edict was issued, a man in the amphitheatre of the grand opera (a State endowment) actually hissed, but he was in stantly expelled, and the police only rightly deprived him of his hat and watch, as a punishment for having blackened the Oberhauptman's left eye. That man was a demagogue\u2014 what do I say?\u2014 a demigorgon\u2014 the originator of a tre mendous and ghastly revolution. The next morning a hideous fresco-drawing in chalk of the Duke's nose and brated all over Europe. Of all German beer, the creamiest, the most froth- ing, it has been long es tablished, is the beer of the Duchy of Oberkop fundohrendet. It was this beer, indeed, that led to the tremen- dous revolution that con- vulsed the four square miles of this Duchy in that eventful and efferves- cent year, 1848. History, often purblind and always partial, having left no re cord of this stupendous convulsion, it has occur- red to us, roused by a natural indignation at the shortcomings of the his toric muse, to supply that deficiency ; and we might here venture to observe, that if historians in gene ral devoted a little less lime to whitewashing Blackamoors, and a little more to perpetuating such great events as the great Beer Revolution in the aforementioned Bavarian Duchy, it would be better for all parties concerned. The population of O 1 (the name, though etymo logically profoundly significant, is rather long for repe tition) is about 1300, including the Duke and Cabinet Council, who are generally in Baden-Baden. The occupa tion of the people is chiefly brewing and ploughing, though a good deal of yarn is also spun at the weekly fair. The capital of the Duchy is the town of Moldydetten, remarkable for the Duke's palace, which has been described by a great living architect as not unlike a Greek cotton factory, and which occupies a space near the chief, and, in fact, the only square. The town is like Stuttgart in miniature, with some indistinct resemblance to Prague, and a flavour of Brussels. It consists of quaint old houses, bristling with gables, and full of all sorts of odd angles, queer out-of-door staircases, strange embrasures, tottering chimneys, and curious projections. The Town Hall is a grand building, of the Renaissance period, and is not unworthy of the capital. The townspeople are a grave, stolid \u2014 slanderers even assert a heavy and dull \u2014 race. The expressive Saxon word, \"jubbtr hens,\" has been, in fact, more than once applied to them by the great German poet, Dickerkopf. 'Patient citizens they indeed are, able to bear burdens, and slow to resent their imposition. But, even the worm, on one celebrated occasion, was known to turn and re-turn, though history fails to say to what events that remarkable occurrence gave rise. The Duke, when we last saw him at Hombourg, where he was in fact officiating as croupier, \u2014 such are the changes of all submoonary things \u2014 was a purblind, bald man, with shaven chin, and enormous, sour-looking Prussian moustachios, that grew backwards into his whiskers. He walked as if his knees were petrified, and carried his nose in the air, after the proud and gallant manner of his lamented father, who was distinguished for his untiring philanthropy to that persecuted race \u2014 we refer to the Jews. The last Duke's third wife was an excellent creature, and a severe economist. Her court wds a pattern of virtue, which is partly accounted for by the fact that the Duchess was of a jealous temperament, and a personal enemy of the Pope. The Cabinet Council consisted of one hundred and fourteen court officials, besides subordinates, among whom there were no less than forty-two general officers, and this reminds us of the army of O 1. That gallant body consisted of an overwhelming force of artillery \u2014 three hundred 18-pounders, not including the wooden cannon facing the statue of Duke Addlebald the Second, in the Grand Platz, and a honey combed gun on the great gate of the Town Hall, which no artilleryman, even under the penalty of death, had ever been prevailed upon to fire. The army comprised three regiments of fourteen men each, not, however, reckoning"], [71, "THE RESOLUTION IN THE DUCHY OF OBF.RKOPFUNDOHRENDET. 59 spectacles struck horror to all who passed the front door of the ducal palace. The guards were at once doubled \u2014 fourteen bayonets bristled, or would have bristled if they had not been sheathed, at the three gates. Loaded cannon were drawn up to face the Grand Platz, and one thousand cabbages were in stantly ordered, in case of a siege, at the nearest greengrocer's. The Duke, who knew something of beer by this time, began to gravely suspect that a storm was brewing, and in stantly prepared (the metaphor is not mine, but the court historian's) to crush it. It was two o'clock when the cabbages arrived at the gate of the palace ; at a quarter-past two a revolution did, indeed, break out \u2014 a stupendous and never-to-be-forgotten revolu tion. The landlord of the Golden Mermaid, the identical man who had hissed the Duke at the opera, and moreover, it was discovered, the leader of a vast secret conspiracy, was sitting drinking beer with four fellow citizens, all in a large way of business, when the ober-inspector, or military tax-col lector for the capital and environs, and a corporal, a spy by profession, entered the room, and demanded six kreutzers in excess of the sum paid the week before by the disaffected landlord into the ducal treasury. I do not know at all why the court historian, from whom I gather these particulars, has made the interlocutors use Elizabethan language \u2014 unless those idioms are still peculiar to the Duchy \u2014 but as it is so, I retain them. I had hitherto erroneously thought that that language was peculiar to sensa tion novels, melodramas, and the imitators of Mr. Sergeant Talfourd's plays. \" Malapert knave,\" said the Ducal tax-collector extraordi nary, flapping the landlord's glass with his thick white glove, \" by my sonties I must swinge thee for these defalcations, and that, too, ere the cream now mantling on the jug has melted to a level. Pay up, thou naughty knave, or I will aroint thee, and that soundly.\" \" Go to, thouinsolent Jack-in-office, ' ' replied the proud traitor, sweeping down all the glass on to the floor with a smash, and moreover, upon the Oberhauptman's dress-boots, ' ' take thy tithe and tax of that, and tell me now whether there is any tax on such swine's wash, unless it go down the throttle. Tell me that, man. We pay not a thaler more to thee, thy monkey of a Duke, or the old hag, his wife, either. Com rades, shall we submit to these indignities, shall we bear it till the beer becomes spoiled barley, water, and the price a florin a glass ? Fellow citizens, I pause for a reply.\" The stolid burghers arose, and without speaking a word, seized the Oberhauptman and put him under the pump in the back-yard. The tax-collector left, vowing vengeance and the sword, and went up to the palace to get troops to arrest the publican and his accomplices. His remark as he put on dry stockings was \u2014 \" Delenda est Carthago,\" and Cato, I be lieve, said it before him ; and on his cry to arms the Potztan sendeimer regiment turned out to a man. But the match was alight. The city had arisen. Discord was abroad with her ten thousand tongues, no doubt at all about it. The publican, Herr Schwarzundwein, was ha ranguing a dense mass of people in front of the Golden Mer maid. Fists were actually shaken at the grim battalions marching on to victory as fast as their corns and age would allow them. The Chancellor was at their head, the Ober hauptman inflexibly in their rear. The Duke's paternal orders had been to shoot down every rioter\u2014 to hang the rest and imprison the remainder. The Chancellor's heart was iron, his brow brass. He took snuff three times. howling a terrific curse in their native language, they fled to the palace, no less than half their force being so bruised or pommelled in their progress that they were unfit for service for the next three weeks, the consumption of brown paper and vinegar during that period being fearful to contemplate. The irritated people, jeering and howling, made a lane for their escape, a course to which the gallant citizens were pro bably driven by the fact that no water can prevent the efficacy of a musket-butt, and these myrmidons of a despotic govern ment were still armed. The cry was now \"To the palace !\" and thither the heroic Schwarzundwein would instantly have led them, had not a savage shout in the direction of the royal brewery, at the end of the Grand Platz, arrested the universal attention. At that place, a fearful struggle was taking place between the soldiery and the people. The drum-major of the royal body-guard, and his gallant but insufficient force of two bassoon players and three risers, were fighting hand to hand with tne excited and almost bloodthirsty mob. The struggle was still doubtful. To use Homeric language, Victory held her scales hovering over their heads. Discord was capping his insatiable breech-loader, and Murder was sharpening her gory and deep-notched knife. Already three fat German 'citizens had succumbed under the drum-major's relentless fist, and black eyes were literally flying about in every direction. Homicide exulted in contemplating the jets of German claret, while from the upper windows the maddened bassoon players poured down, with cruel carefulness, whole jugs of boiling beer. That, indeed, was a contest which the ancient scalds might have tuned their Erard harps \u2014 (am I here committing anyantiquarian error ? \u2014 if so, I beg to apologize) \u2014 to celebrate. But, alas ! \u2014 (there is a good deal of pathos in an alas ! well introduced, though it is not much patronized in real hfe) so alas ! Fate had set her hook-nosed face against the conservative party at the very moment when the inde fatigable and lion-hearted bassoon player had gone down stairs for his third pail full of hot beer (\"these were brave worts\"), Schwarzundwein, and his men, flushed with recent victory, and heated with unpaid-for beer, recklessly distributed among them at the conspirators' expense (N.B. \u2014 they never paid for it \u2014 this, the court historian sneeringly and unworthily observes, is note-worthy), appeared on the scene, and rushed at the principal entrance of the brewery. What can one foot do against ten thousand? \u2014 nor could even the kicks of an excited drummer stay the Atlantic violence of an exasperated and maddened populace. A rush \u2014 a jostle \u2014 a hat or two trodden under foot, and the brew-house was in the hands of the insurgents. A moment more, and its defenders were prisoners. In fifteen minutes, a thousand jugs of beer were waving in the air, a thousand spigots were thrust into ten thousand casks, and the result was \u2014 we blush to relate the fact \u2014 a uni versal tipple. The voices grew louder, the populace grew more revolutionary ; songs were shouted, the cry again was \"to the palace ! \" Schwarzundwein hoisted a brewer's apron upon a pole, drew a cross with red paint upon it, and led the mob to their terrible work of destruction. Stop them? \u2014 can you put a cork into Vesuvius and bottle up an eruption ? Can you stop a West Indian hurricane with a wall of mosquito net? But at the corner of the first street a terrible object met the popular eye\u2014 it was the Sauerkrautenwertz regiment, fourteen strong. The major had been taken suddenly faint as they started, and was left behind : and serve him right, too. Fourteen muskets covered fourteen ringleaders, and no one knowing who were the destined victims, fourteen hundred men shook like a leaf\u2014 shook visibly, and turned pale, in spite of the natural vermilion of their stalwart cheeks. Every one looked on Schwarzundwein \u2014 he alone remained impertur bable ; it is a positive fact that he winked, and an artful smile seemed to curl his hair \u2014 I mean his lip \u2014 \"Fear not, my roaring boys,\" he said, using that peculiar German which can only be adequately represented by Eliza bethan English, \" fear them not, my Rory Tories, regard not these scarlet hirelings, my lads of mettle\u2014 they are harmless. Behold\u2014\" . . The soldiers presented their muskets ; the mob shut their eyes\u2014 a great terror gloomed over the republicans ; the soldiers fired\u2014 but there was no report. \"I'fakins,\" cried Schwarzundwein, \"we have cozened them rarely, my sons of Troy\u2014 what they take for gunpowder is only black pepper. Behold, they sneeze.\" His first words were \u2014 \" Up, guards, and at them !\" His second\u2014 \" Charge that man that has already charged so many. Force open his till, and punish that proud traitor. We must crush this wasp-nest and the wasps will take warn ing. Forward !\" The mob wavered and retreated. They were lost. All persons who hesitate are. The Potztansendeimer regiment advanced and knocked and rang at the door of the Golden Mermaid. Did it instantly fly open ? No. For the landlord, putting his head out of window, asked them what they wanted. \"Your life, slave,\" was the Chancellor's gallant reply. \"Then, in the name of the Three Kings of Cologne, let all go!\" cried a voice as from each window there descended on the heads of the doomed soldiers Niagaras of bad beer\u2014 a hogshead from every window. Spluttering and cursing, the men raised their muskets to fire, but every gun was now a water spout ; the cartridges were soaked through, there was not a drv stitch on one of them \u2014 I mean on one soldier. To a man,"], [72, "60 THE \"FIFE ALLS. And the regiment sneezed, as he uttered these almost pro- phetic words. The sneeze spread to the mob \u2014 the Duke heard it \u2014 the houses shook \u2014 for four thousand people snoze at once ; the result was a young earthquake, heard almost as far as Munich, where it was not unnaturally taken for distant thunder. There was a rush of the people, and down went the terrified regiment like so many nine pins when the ponderous ball takes the right-hand corner of the centre pin. With some mysterious order, uttered in a whisper not heard by more than ninety-four conspirators, Schwarzundwein, dashed onward to the palace. Let us describe the palace. Imagine, reader \u2014 No, don't ; it might hurt you. Go and look at the front of Buckingham Palace. Regard the figure with the toasting-fork, and report progress. Double the number of windows, and Noah's Ark trees ; place in the centre of the quadrangle the statue of the Duke Karl Bigvig Hohensticfeln, granting the Mayor and citizens of O 1 after the insurrec- tion of 1802, permission to inhabit their own city ; surround the railings with the fragments of several regiments, and place before the chief gates three 18-pounders loaded to the muzzle with grape, knobs of pokers, tenpenny nails, and hand grenades. Suppose the Duke at the centre window over the door, and above him the Duchess beating the window-sill with her fan, impatient for the slaughter of the revolutionists. On the ground-floor introduce the atrabilious Chancellor waving his hat to the confident and indomitable troops. That horrible battery seemed waiting for the insane people with a terrible and insidious tranquillity. One wave of the Duke's eye-glass, of the Duchess's fan, of the Chancellor's bat, and death in a million ghastly shapes would be vomited upon the brutal crowd of would-be-reformers. It was a majestic thought, and the Duke sipped at it as the epicure sips at an expensive Neapolitan ice, which he half regrets buying, and yet gloats over as it slips, a delicious avalanche, down his bronchia.* The Duke was in the glorious and delightful position of the last man on board a fire-ship ; one spark of a match, and the fire will begin as he slides into his boat. It is remarkable how calmly a general in the extreme rear of his troops can regard the loss of 40,000 men. The Duke had two thoughts\u2014 the crawfish soup he had ordered for dinner, and the murderous milraille that was to mow down some eight thousand\u2014 (he had taken a heavy bet an hour before as to the number) \u2014 rebels. Would the rebels never come? \u2014 was the exquisite enjoyment of retaliation to be denied him by an unkind Providence ?\u2014 were 17,000,000 gallons of treble X to be drunk unavenged ? No, forbid it, Heaven ! \"Egad, here they come!\" cried the Chancellor, in his excitement beating in the crown of an aide-de-camp's hat. \"By Gis and by charity, here are the filthy fellows,\" simpered the old raven of a duchess, as eager for blood as any of them. \"Out on them, and with a wannion ! So the twopenny dogs are at last at hand ! \" screamed the Duke ; ordering the artillerymen \"all grape the next load, and then a dose of cannister. \" The men stood to their guns, their guns stood as near them as could be expected. A cataclysm was about to ensue \u2014one horizontal storm of fire, and the Grand Platz would be filled with eight thousand intensely dead and horribly maddened rebels. But no, a flag of truce\u2014 an ambiguous garment\u2014 some say a shirt, others a counterpane, advanced\u2014 woven, waved we should say, by the unflinching Schwarzundwein The artillerymen drew back their lighted fuses. The storm was for the moment ordered back. Death halted, the Duke took snuff fretfully. He was impatient for the fun to begin He had lost a good deal of money by that beer, and he was horribly out of temper. He leaped about like an India-rubber ball\u2014 what do we say ? \u2014 like a pea that is parched. \" Fire !\u2014 why the dickens don't the malapert knaves fire? .\\'o quarter \u2014 give it them hot\u2014 pshaw/\u2014 FIRE 1 But at that moment the front rank of the populace opened at a call of Schwarzundwein, and disclosed thirteen fire-engines loaded to the muzzle. Thousands sprang to the pumps It was the work of a moment for them to uncoil the hose and pour upon the touchholes of the guns and the open powder-casks ten tons of bad beer and brandy-and-water a minute The water dashed, splashed, and broke with irresistible violence. Cascades of it descended on the half-drowned artillerymen. In an instant the guns were useless. The liquid poured in vast silvery arches, and bore down all before it. The foremost soldier was in a moment drowned at the gates, and in a second streaming torrents of beer crashed against the palace windows, and wetted through the paralysed Duke, the frantic Duchess, and the horror-stricken Chancellor. They turned, and looking, fled by a back door just as the front door was stormed by the people. But why this waste of aqua vit\u00e6? Did Schwarzundwein ever shut his sleepless eyes ? This was his scheme, a scheme which \u2014 (Here imagine two pages of the best historical WTiting.) That brandy-and-water did its work, it saved the country. The artillerymen and soldiers exhausted with its violence and intoxicated with its fumes and strength, instantly, with a wild cry, sacked the palace, under the erroneous impression that they were defeating the rioters ; nor did they discover their fatal mistake till misty morning on the minster top awoke them to a splitting headache and an awful sense of then- degraded position in the public gutters of O 1. In half an hour all that was not yet begun was, we may almost say, over. Grenadiers in the Duchess's best gowns were pouring out beer in golden finger glasses, and performing play- ful fantasias with their musket-butts on the Duke's grand piano. China was flung out of window, and then removed with care. Pictures were collected on bayonets, and carried carefully to a safe place. Indeed, with the' single exception of 142,000/., there was not one stiver of the ducal property touched by these immortal and stainless patriots. If Schwarz- undwein, in a not unnatural fit of temper, did certainly play at skittles with nine Sevres jars, who are we, that we should blame him? Some amusement was found by the rebels in playfully cutting the chains that held the chandeliers, but then the result fully repaid them for any expenditure of trouble. Only sixteen looking-glasses were broken, and those chiefly by accidental chairs tossed somewhat recklessly about. Nor could the severest moralists of the conservative party grudge the brave fellows the exquisite fun obtained from cutting open twenty-two feather beds and dropping their contents down from the roof in a miniature snow-storm. What is a chandelier? \u2014 what is a feather bed ?\u2014 what even is a grand piano, when a nation's liberty is at stake ? I pause for a reply ; for if once the blood-stained features of Discord emerge above the sunny slopes of nature and (Here a want of space compels us reluctantly to omit three exquisitely rhetorical pages.) The price of beer had fallen for ever in O 1 ; the Duke had fled, liberty was restored. Schwarzundwein, slightly the worse for liquor, stood the avowed Masaniello of the moment, waving the brewer's banner above the highest chimney-pot of the ducal palace. It was a miracle he did not fall over, also the two tottering warriors who held him, and who occasionally let him go to wave their beer-drenched shakoes. It was a proud moment, and was almost too much for them. But the Duke ? where does he hide his prematurely bald head and his nose in the air? Has nature no dunghill readv for such emergencies ? And the Duchess, she also of the vul- ture nose, snuffy lip, and unnaturally white false teeth grin- ning in perpetual mockery of vacancy ?

At last she spoke \u2014 ' ' ' I've taken a fancy to the boy, Mary ; you don't want him, \u2014 leave him to me ; I will take care of him.' ' ' I daresay you have heard that I was not born, as some people have been, with a silver spoon in my mouth. Nature was satisfied with having provided me with a mouth of ordi nary capacity, wisely considering that a spoon would have been a superfluity in the family of a poor author, whose children, like young birds, are mostly fed with a quill. \" My father \u2014 I blush to confess \u2014 was a poet \u2014 a sort of in tellectual Eagle, who spent his time soaring to the Empyrean vault \u2014 wherever that may be \u2014 and stealing sacks of Prome thean coals from that famous depdt. Setting aside the ille gality of the proceeding, the stolen property did not appear to lessen the consumption of Wallsend in our house, and I have heard my poor mother declare, with tears in her eyes, that ' Promethean fire was the only fuel that did not keep the pot boiling.' At length the poor Eagle, tired and worn out by repeated efforts to rise above the humiliating necessities of butchers' and bakers' bills, and being left with out a feather to fly with, dropped one day from his perch \u2014 stone dead \u2014 bequeathing his six half-fledged eaglets to the protection of the wide world. I was the youngest of the brood, being only eighteen months old when the first oppor tunity of improving my position presented itself. Amongst the friends and relatives who on the death of my father kindly forbore to disturb our grief by offers of assistance, there was one remarkable exception. Sarah Jukes, an elderly maiden aunt, who enjoyed the reputation of an annuity of six hundred pounds, and of having, in a moment of impulsive generosity, given a halfpenny to a crossing-sweeper, arrived one morning to tender my mother her sincere condolences on her loss, with the unexpected offer of the loan of ' The Weekly Tribulation ' on the day after publication, as a means of keeping up her spirits. The six orphan eaglets being duly presented to my aunt, that excellent lady was pleased to recommend my mother not to neglect providing new flannel petticoats for the girls, and stout boots for the boys, to keep the poor things warm in the approaching winter. Looking on me as I lay on my mother's lap, my aunt remarked, as she might of a thriv ing puppy dog, ' He's a fine little fellow !' \"This was my opportunity.\u2014 I stretched my arms towards my aunt, laughed, crowed, and made sundry infantine efforts to express the pleasure I felt at being noticed by her. 'A very ' ' Great is a mother's love for her child, but as I was only one of six, my child's portion of maternal affection could not be very large. It was therefore, without much difficulty, arranged that my aunt should take me with her, and that I should for ever abandon the maternal roof. If any thought could have entered my tender mind as I rode towards my future home in my aunt's carriage, it must have been the gratifying one \u2014 that / had not missed my first opportunity. \"Next day, by my aunt's direction, I was arrayed in a mourn ing garb; \u2014 the whitest linen and the blackest sables com pletely altered my appearance, and I looked more like a glossy young raven of large expectations, than the poor ragged eaglet about whom nobody cared a straw. \"Infancy has a history of its own, if we could but trace it in the dim memories of the past. I have only indistinct recol lections of the events of this portion of my life, but I believe all my actions were regulated by the one great principle of my being ; for I have been told that when my aunt, in the pride of her assumed maternity, had me brought to table with the dessert, my instinct always prompted me to seize the oppor tunity, and the largest peach on the table, at the same moment. \" In due time I was sent to a boarding-school, highly recom mended to my aunt as the very garden of knowledge, where the apples of wisdom grew in bushels on birch trees. The Reverend Doctor Trounce had, like Le Sage's famous physi cian, one very simple but effectual mode of treatment with offending pupils. He tried in the first instance whipping and starving, and if that did not succeed, he changed the treat ment to starving and whipping. The doctor had also a theory that it was better to spoil the child than spare the rod ; but then, as has been said of the illustrious Mr. Cal craft, \u2014 out of his profession he was kind and gentle as a lamb. \"During the five years I passed at school, my character began to develope in various ways ; I never missed an oppor tunity of making friends with the boys who got the biggest plum-cakes from home. To one I especially paid the most devoted attention\u2014 he was the only son of a rich and in dulgent mother, who supplied him abundantly with pocket-"], [77, "SOME PASSAGES IN THE LIFE OF SAMUEL SMART. 65 -^ money, and every month forwarded a hamper to the school addressed to ' Master David Wotherspoon, Excelsior House Academy'\u2014 crammed full of all sorts of cakes, dried fruits, pots of jam and marmalade, and boxes of sardines, of which I was always invited to partake. But David had another and higher claim to my regard than marmalade or sardines. I discovered that, on his coming of age, he would have the patronage of the rich living of Snugstead, in Sussex. I thought this might prove a happy means for improving my temporal and spiritual interests, and being then of the ripe age of fourteen, I determined upon entering theChurch, and had already selected the text of my first sermon, when an incident occurred which I shall relate. \" Doctor Trounce, amongst other evidences of a cultivated taste, was passionately fond of peaches, and prided himself upon growing in his own garden the finest the country could produce. It happened one summer there was a general failure of wall fmit, and the doctor's cherished tree only bore six peaches, but these were of extraordinary promise, and he watched from day to day with all the anxiety of a tender parent, the growth of the succulent delicacies\u2014 not for him self\u2014no ! Doctor Trounce meditated an act of self-denial worthy of a Christian anchorite at a Lord Mayor's turtle feast: he had determined on presenting them to the bishop of his diocese ; and the very day on which the sacrifice was to be made, he walked into the garden to regale his eyes for the last time on his treasures. Never had peaches looked so ripe, so juicy, and so tempting. While gazing with the fond admiration of a lover upon the downy cheeks of his darlings \u2014glowing with the richest gold and softest crimson tints\u2014 his mouth watered, and his eyes filled with sympathetic tears. \" ' It is hard to part with them,' murmured the doctor ; ' but the bishop is grateful, and will appreciate the attention. How lovely they look ! The old Vicar of Gogswell is dying \u2014 and \u2014 who can tell ? Ah ! there's a wasp feasting on one of them \u2014 lucky fellow ! I should like just to smell them \u2014 a-ah ! Ambrosia ! Odours of Araby ! \u2014 ah \u2014 it's too much for poor weak human nature \u2014 the bishop must go without them. Here, John' (to the gardener), ' let me have these six peaches at dinner to-morrow.' ' ' I need not dwell on the painful scene that followed. Doctor Trounce's vigorous arm had never performed its duties more effectively. The result was, I preferred standing to sitting for a whole week. David Wotherspoon, although he had not the honest courage to prevent my self-immolation, was in private profuse of his professions of gratitude, and I had the consolation of knowing that I had not missed the epportunity of making a friend, who might one day remember that I had borne stripes for his fault. \" I believe my anticipations might have been realized, had not poor Wotherspoon been unfortunately carried off by a surfeit in the plum season. The parsonage of Snugstead became a dissolving view, and I had nothing for it but to watch for an opportunity in some other direction. ' ' About this time also, my Aunt Sarah died, deeply lamented \u2014 as testified by the two fat cherubs who to this day continue to shed white marble tears on her monument in the church of Saint Barnabas the Little. As my aunt had always lived up to her income, which died with her, she had little to leave me besides her furniture,' plate, horses and carriages ; these rea lized about a thousand pounds, and with this sum I began hfe, by being articled to Mr. Worrit, a solicitor in a large country town. Candidly speaking, I felt I should have more opportunities in the law than theChurch, and determining if I could help it not to miss one of them, I signed my indentures with a becoming degree of pride in the consciousness of being from that moment an integral portion of Magna Charta. \" I must do myself the justice to say, that I never missed any of those opportunities which fortune kindly threw in my way ; and if the proceeds were small, they were deliciously sweet. Many a crown and half-crown have I received from creditors of retiring habits against whom I had writs in my pocket, merely that I might look another way when we hap pened to meet at the corner of a street. Even a sovereign was now and then to be got out of a reluctant witness, who dreaded being dragged by a subp\u0153na into a cross examination by a bullying barrister. These small scraps of luck, which occasionally dropped into my dish, only whetted my appetite for more substantial windfalls. At length, one fell, as it were, from the clouds at my feet. Did I hesitate to pick it up? Did I miss the heaven-sent opportunity f Cer tainly not. ' ' Our firm, I should tell you, had a rich client, named Bond, a man of importance, too, in the town, who, for some reason best known to himself, died one night, without disturbing Mrs. Bond, who slept serenely by his side, happily uncon scious of his danger until human aid was too late. It was my especial business to attend the disconsolate widow on matters relating to the settlement of her late husband's affairs ; but these were so complicated, that we were obliged to devote a couple of hours every evening to the examination of intricate accounts. Yet Mrs. Bond did not \u2014 as many women might \u2014 grow weary of these dry investigations : on the contrary, she appeared particularly cheerful over them, and when I looked at her handsome, smiling face, surrounded by that frame of white muslin \u2014 the widow's cap, which she wore with an air of proud resignation \u2014 I could not help feel ing more than a professional interest in her fate. \" Months passed on, and every day gave new brightness to the widow's eye, fresh colour to her cheek : her smile had bubbled into a laugh, and her lips often melted into snatches of merry songs, which she immediately suppressed with the prettiest affectation of remorse imaginable. \"The dismal twelvemonth during which society consigns bereaved relicts to lugubrious weeds, approached its close ; but as yet I had not ventured to give utterance to the thought that lay nearest my heart. I was waiting my time. At length it came. A grand horticultural fete was to be given on a certain day in the grounds of the Earl of Rosely, and a numerous attendance of what the local papers called the rank, wealth, and beauty of the county were to be as sembled on the occasion. On that day, Mrs. Bond resolved to emerge from her sables, and burst into colours more gor geous than the combined tints of all the flowers at the fete. ' ' Preparations were made by the widow and her confidential maid on a scale of grandeur proper to the important event. The services of milliners and dressmakers were secured for a month previously, and the latest fashions from ' Le Follet' were copied with mathematical exactness ; and if the result was slightly incongruous, the fault lay with the Parisian ar chitect, not with the British builder. The bonnet \u2014 that crown and climax of the milliner's art \u2014 could not, however, be entrusted to any but a London artist : accordingly, an order was given for one to a first-rate Regent-street establish- \"That evening, returning home from a late walk, my way lay across the playground which adjoined the doctor's garden, when I was startled by somebody dropping within a few feet of me from the garden wall. There was sufficient light for me to recognise in this sudden apparition my friend David Wotherspoon, who, Jason-like, was carrying off the doctor's golden fruit in his pocket-handkerchief. He was confounded at seeing me, and could hardly stammer out, ' You wont split, Sam?' \"Avisionofthe parsonage of Snugstead was before my eyes, and I replied with a gush of generous enthusiasm, ' Never, Davy ! \u2014 Never ! I'll be flogged to ribbons first.' \"Terrible was the rage of the doctor when, on the following moming, the gardener reported the robbery of the peaches, adding his private opinion, that ' it could only have been done by one of the young gentlemen theirselves.\" Prayers said \u2014 we had always prayers before punishment \u2014 the doctor took his seat in his ample curule chair, and prefacing the business in hand by a few emphatic observations on the enormity of breaking the eighth commandment, concluded by requiring the boy who had stolen his peaches to stand forth and confess his crime. A dead silence pervaded the school \u2014 for no one seemed disposed to accept the invitation. The frown on the brow of the reverend preceptor became dark as night. \" ' Let the culprit stand forth,' repeated the doctor, with a vicious whisk of his cane. ' ' Nobody moved. \" 'One amongst you,' said the doctor, 'committed the deed. Once more, then, I ask who stole my peaches?\" ' ' Nobody spoke. \" 'We shall soon discover the thief,' said the doctor, red dening in his wrath. ' I'll flog the whole school till I extract the truth. A cold shudder crept down the backs of the forty nine pupils, who sat with white faces looking at their inflexible judge. \" ' I'll give you one last chance before I begin \u2014 mark me \u2014 only one. Who stole my peaches ?' \" ' I did, sir,' said I, standing boldly up. \" ' You, Samuel ? The last boy in the school I should have suspected of such an atrocious act. Let this be a timely warning to you, boys \u2014 peaches lead youth to the gallows. I pity the unhappy delinquent, but justice must be satisfied.

The widow held the beautiful object in her hand, looking at it from every point of view with increasing admiration. Her maid was in ecstacies\u2014 ' How lovely you will look in it to-morrow, ma'am, to be sure !' on her wedding tour, and which was half an hour later in the fashion than that which had been destroyed by the heartless ' Floss.' Returning home by the fast train in the morning, I sent my prize to the widow, with a neat little note, expres sing the great happiness I experienced in being enabled to request her acceptance of a bonnet \u2014 more diminutive than the one she had unfortunately lost. \"The transition from despair to joy \u2014 on the appearance of this unhoped-for present \u2014 can only be understood by the fe male mind. Mrs. Bond was in raptures, and Hannah ex pressed her conviction that I must have ' flown to London for it in the night.' Both agreed that it was a crowning effort of art, and must make quite a sensation at the fete. \u25a0 They were right. Mrs. Bond and her bonnet attracted more attention than even Sir Barnwell Bluff's enormous pumpkin. \"That evening Mrs. Bond invited me to a friendly cup of tea, and a quiet game of /carle: Never had I seen her so radiant \u2014 so dazzling \u2014 so generally irresistible. She was pro fuse in her thanks \u2014 unbounded in her expressions of era titude. 6 ' ' ' You think it becomes me, Hannah ? and my complexion?' \" 'Matches it, ma'am, to a nicety. What a pity, ma'am, you have been obliged to wear that 'orrid black scuttle for a whole year.' \" ' It wasn't cheerful,' said the widow, with a gentle sigh. \" ' Oh, ma'am, if Mr. Smart could but look at you now, looking as you should look !' \"A reproof rising to the widow's rosy lips was checked by a knock at the hall door. \"'There, ma'am, that's him \u2014 punctual as the clock \u2014 he always is \u2014 reg'lar with the muffins, ma'am.' \" ' Hold your tongue, girl, and open the door,\" said the widow, throwing off the new bonnet and hastily arranging her cap at the glass. That done, she turned to replace the bonnet in the band-box, when \u2014 horror upon horror ! she beheld that matchless work of art on the floor, and her lap- dog \u2014 the pampered ingrate, Floss \u2014 tearing it into shreds. ' ' When I entered the room, Mrs. Bond was dissolved in tears. Alarmed beyond expression, I ventured to inquire what had happened. \" 'Ruined \u2014 utterly ruined and destroyed!' she replied, pointing to the wreck of the bonnet. ' ' I comprehended the disaster in a moment, and attempted to speak words of comfort to the agitated widow ; but she refused to be consoled, and burst into a fresh passion of tears. I suffered the tide of her grief to flow without interruption until it had slackened, and then ventured to suggest that another bonnet might be procured by the following day. \" ' Impossible !' she exclaimed. ' I had to send to London for that, and there is no time to order another. Was ever woman so unfortunate !' \" ' It was so kind \u2014 so thoughtful of you,' she said, ' to have taken so much trouble, to gratify a foolish fancy of mine.' \" I protested I had done nothing \u2014 absolutely nothing worthy of being mentioned by a lady for whom I entertained the sincerest \u2014 ' affection' \u2014 I would have said, but the word stuck in my throat, and I was compelled to get it out of the way by swallowing a large piece of muffin. \"We sat down to {carti, but my mind wandered, and I could see nothing but hearts in my hand j Mrs. Bond did not seem more at her ease :\u2014 both had, in fact, an internal consciousness that we were playing a game not to be found in Hoyle.

It was a trying moment, but I felt I was equal to the occasion. \" ' I propose,' said I, firmly. \"The widow coloured to her eyes, and with pretty hesita tion replied, 'I accept.' \" 'For life?\u2014 shall it be?' \"The cards fell from her fingers, and in endeavouring to pick them up, I found a hand\u2014 not one that had ever belonged to Delarue's pack, but a soft, smooth, dimpled hand of Nature's own manufacture\u2014 clasped in mine. I did not part with it until she had consented to bestow it on me\u2014 along with a fortune of ten thousand pounds\u2014 at the parish church the next Sunday but one.

I made its acquaintance under a misapprehension, and did not, at the time, know that it had a history. I have since been told (though I do not vouch for that) that it belonged, in Oliver Cromwell's time, to one of his officers. The house of General Fairfax is not far off, and in its general characteristics it seemed to me to resemble the house which I have in my memory. At the time when I first knew the house at Putney, I. was in a situation of great difficulty. My uncle had threatened to cut me off with a shilling, and leave me to my prospects at the bar, if I did not marry the mean, middle-aged, and millionaire Matilda Moggs. An unconquerable dislike to public speaking made my look-out as a barrister rather dismal ; and an unconquerable dislike to Matilda Moggs made it impossible for me, as a man of honour, to marry her. In the meanwhile I was adding to the income allowed me by my uncle, by employing myself in literature. My business at Putney, on the morning which opens my tale was to see a Mr. Burgess who, being about to originate a Christmas Annual, had sought my co-operation. I was told that I should find Mr. Burgess at a particular large house, so many | doors past the railway station, and standing back from the ' street ; it does not matter on which side of the way. I followed minutely my directions. There was a high wall, covered with ivy, in front of the house ; and in the middle was an old-fashioned iron gate with a something rampant, \\ ex regardant, ox gules (I don't understand heraldry) carved on a 'scutcheon at the top. The fine old red-brick mansion, 1 with its carved doorway, stood some distance back, beyond a well-kept but formal front garden. I rang the visitors' bell, and the maid who answered it asked my business. It was between eight and nine o'clock on a cold November morning, and I thought she looked rather surprised to see anybody. \"Mr. Burgess,\" thought I, \"has forgotten to say I was coming to see him by appointment.\" My dislike to public speaking is not unconnected with an occasional bashfulness, which leads to a little indistinctness in private speaking ; but I told the girl I wanted to see Mr. Burgess, and told her, as I thought, pretty plainly. She looked at me with increased surprise, and saying, \" I'll see, sir,\" let me into the house, took my card, and went before me. I found myself in a very large hall. In the middle, on the ground floor, which was all of stone, there was a great fire burning. Right and left ran staircases, which extended themselves into an oaken gallery which took in three sides of the place. Round this gallery were doors, more than I remember, with several passages leading I did not know whither. The servant led me up the left-hand staircase and along the gallery to a door on the other side. In making this little journey I had been, not merely surprised, as the servant appeared to be, but utterly astonished. I had heard the ringing of half-a-dozen bells, the tinkling of half-a-dozen pianos, and the rustling of more than half-a-dozen female dresses. And what had I seen ? More girls than I could, at the moment, count. Girls of all ages, from seven or eight to seventeen or eighteen. Brown-eyed, grey-eyed, plump and thin. Black-haired, light-haired ; short and'tall. Some in curl-papers, and some in \"bands.\" Some in a state of decided half-dress, darting out inquisitively from doors and passages, and rustling back again in affright as they caught a glimpse of me. What was I to think of the household of this Burgess? Was it possible that, presuming on the charity of the season, he wanted me to write up in his Christmas Annual a domestic institution which is, at present, peculiar to the Salt Lake Valley, and to the hateful East ? Had he started a Model Hareem at Putney to begin with ? I knew that he was himself unmarried, so that his wife could not be the keeper of a ladies' school ; and it was not to be supposed that he kept one himself. Parents and guardians would never tolerate such an innovation, I felt sure. However, the maid asked me into a well-appointed little room, and in a short time I heard the door open, and distinguished the rustle of two gowns. One of the ladies was a middle-aged, matronly- looking person ; and .she held the other by the hand, introducing her as \u2014 \" Miss Burgess.\" The other was, at a guess, between seventeen and eighteen, \u2014 near eighteen ; a beautiful, tall, well-built girl, with bright, mesmeric eyes, gleaming powerfully from underneath broad thick bands of glittering hair, hastily arranged in masses over her lovely brows. 1 am, myself, peculiarly susceptible to the mesmeric influence, and now I felt that I was in the presence of a Medium. My wits and my will deserted me when I felt the force of those wonderful eyes, as they bash fully measured me and took stock of me. I sank into a chair at the bidding of the elder lady. \" This, sir,\" said she, \"is Miss Burgess;\" and whatever might be the meaning of it, she scrutinized me with an intense, overpowering, motherly interest, which was scarcely in the least disguised. \"I beg your pardon,\" said I; \"it was Mr. Burgess with whom I had an appointment ; and I fear that, by some mistake of my own, I am trespassing upon your \" I did not conclude my sentence, for the behaviour of the two ladies startled me a little. They lifted their hands in wonder ; they exchanged telegraphic glances ; the elder kissed the younger, .who blushed, and seemed half disposed to cry. Then the elder lady pulled the bell, and when tbe maid appeared, said \u2014 \" Lock and bolt the front and back doors, Jane, and bring me the keys.\" And then \u2014 in a minute it was done, and the keys were brought \u2014 and then my hostess turned to me again and resumed the conversation. \" Your name, sir, I see by your card, is Witherington.\" \"Yes,\" said I, feeling utterly bewildered and helpless. \" Probably not a descendant of the celebrated Witherington who fought at Chevy Chase ?\" \"Yes, I am,\" said I, again feeling that an absurdity, more or less, was no great matter in such a wild situation ; and feeling, also, quite ready to believe anything of myself. \"And permit me to ask you, for time presses, and the peril is great, what is your profession ? Pray excuse the liberty I take in asking these questions.\" \"Mr. Burgess,\" I replied, \"is aware of my profession.\" \u25a0' Probably ; but I am desirous that you should make Miss Burgess and me aware of it, if you will be so good as to dis pense with ceremony, on an occasion truly momentous.\" \"I am,\" said I, \"a banister, and a man of letters.\" \" I think, then,\" interposed the other, timidly, anc with a very sweet voice, \" I think, then, it is your poems, sir, that I have read in a recently published volume?\" To this I bowed a delighted assent, finding myself more and more in the power of the mesmeric eyes every instant. And now the two ladies again telegraphed to each other. After a moment or two, the elder one said, \" Constance, dear, come along with me ! Will you excuse us, sir, for a minute?\" And then I was left alone, and heard the key turn in the lock outside. A whispering, and going to and fro, in the gallery without, and an apparent delivery of messages, did not add much to the bewilderment of my feelings. Youth likes adventure. I had already threatened my iather that I would go for a soldier, if he pressed Matilda Moggs upon me, and felt very much inclined to let fate drift me whithersoever it pleased. But what was Mr. Burgess thinking all this time ? It was not long before the two ladies re-entered the room. The elder one addressed me in a respectfully affectionate manner \u2014 \" I have to announce to you, sir, that for the present you are my prisoner.\" \"Yes, our prisoner!\" echoed the mesmeric darling, in tones which would have made any chain he lightly on my arm. \" Your presence in this house, sir, on this occasion,\" re sumed the elder lady, \" is a Remarkable Interposition. We regard you as a deus ex machina, sir.\" \" I am too happy,\" I replied, \" to be regarded in so divine a light ; but I should like to know what is the nodus dignus that I am to cut ?\" \"Sir,\" said my hostess, \"your curiosity will be satisfied in due time \u2014 before many days are over. In the meanwhile, you are a captive : here,\" laying her hand on the plump white wrist of Constance, \"here is your jailer, sir. Under her, our page will be at your service. Everything will be done to"], [83, "MARRIED BY MAIN FORCE. 71 make your retirement agreeable. I am having two rooms prepared for your reception. Only a doubt or two remain to be settled. Oh, here they come, I think ! Constance, dear, if it is Mr. Smith and Mr. Jones, you will withdraw, will you ?\" And Mr. Smith and Mr. Jones entered the room, and looked very hard at me. ' ' We shall both have occasion, in the fulfilment of the duty which devolves upon us,\" said the taller, stouter, and more respectable-looking gentleman of the two, \"in fulfilling, I say, our duty, we shall both have occasion to trespass for some minutes upon your kindness. May we be permitted to take a few liberties with your Person, sir?\" \"That depends,\" said I, \"upon what they are. You are two to one, but I can smash the window, and alarm the passers-by, if you proceed to any un-English lengths with me.\" Theodore Hook did when asked the question, \"forty, if you please.\" \"Then,\" cried Mrs. Robinson, \"we are pleased, aren't we, Constance?\" And Constance blushed assent. I say assent, because it was evident that she really was pleased, though why she should blush I could not for the life of me divine. \"You are not a married man, with a wife living?\" asked Mrs. Robinson, with a penetrating glance. \" No, indeed,\" said I, and I shuddered at the thought of the woman who might have been my wife. \"Why do you shiver?\" said Mrs. Robinson; \"are you cold?\" \"No,\" I answered ; \" I shivered at the thought of Matilda Moggs.\" And then I poured forth my artless tale with such simple truthfulness of manner, that I could see both the ladies be lieved me, and were satisfied I was a bachelor. Yet feeling desirous to oblige, I added \u2014 ' ' An oath would be profane as well as extra-judicial. But perhaps you would like me to make a Solemn and Sincere Declaration under the provisions of the Statute I am not a married man, ' And I make this Solemn and Sincere Declaration, conscientiously believing the same to be true, and by virtue of the provisions of An Act made and passed' .... and all that . . . . ' and entitled An Act to Repeal an Act ' . . . . and all that . . . . ' extra-judicial Oaths and Affidavits' \u2014 and that's all !\" ' ' We do not propose to hurt you. This lady's presence is surely a sufficient voucher for the harmlessness of our in tentions.\" \" I don't know that,\" said I. \"Women have looked on coldly while men have been tortured .... and I believe that's an instrument of torture you are feeling for at this moment.\" But I was in error. It was only a stethoscope, with which the gentleman proceeded to \" sound\" me. He then punched my ribs, felt my pulse, and cracked my muscles with great assiduity. When he had done, he patted me on the back, and turning to the lady with a benignant look, said \u2014 \"He'll do. I stake my professional reputation on the soundness of every organ.\" \"Thank you, doctor,\" replied the lady. \" I am glad to hear it. \" \"Well done!\" said Constance, clapping her lovely white palms together. \"Perhaps after this Mr. Witherington would like a glass of wine?\" \"Well,\" said I, \" I think I should; I feel rather . . . . rather .... in fact \" \" So am I,\" said I ; \"is there anything to pay?\" This made them all laugh ; but I put the question with a grim and bewildered resignation which really seemed to awake the compassion of the mistress of the place. \" You see, doctor, \" said she, tenderly, \"he knows nothing about it all.\" \"Puzzled?\" said Mrs. Robinson; \"no doubt, sir. And you will have to remain so for a little time. You need not hope to escape ; you will find your jailer here\" \u2014 turning to Constance \u2014 \"very watchful ; and when you take exercise in the garden, which is of great extent, you will be attended by a page. I repeat, however, that infinite pains will be taken to make your stay in this retreat agreeable to you. To that end I am sure I can pledge myself that your young jailer here will cheerfully do her best. I dare say she will be willing to beguile the tedium of your imprisonment by singing and playing to you. Our library is entirely at your service, and I must own to you I have such confidence in the re sources of <our beloved Constance, that I do not think it likely you will exhaust them before the time arrives at which it will be in our power to release you.\" \" For which purpose,\" said my lovely turnkey, \"we can, I think, begin to take measures this very day.\" \"Well, my love, I think so,\" said Mrs. Robinson, kissing her repeatedly. \"It is very odd,' I observed, not without an all-overish sensation as I heard the little smack-smack of the kisses ; \"it is very odd that upon the day on which my incarceration commences, my custodians should begin to concert plans for setting me free.\" \" It certainly is, Mr. Witherington, as you say, odd, but I believe we shall in the end make it even. All we shall ex pect of you is implicit obedience,\" said the elder lady, with an air of maternal dignity, mingled with affection. \"Say, rather, kind compliance,\" suggested my turnkey; ' ' I am sure, sir, you will not mind promising compliance with my wishes?\" And the bright, soft mesmeric eyes seconding the soft mesmeric voice, I lost all my will, and said \u2014 \" I promise !\" \"There is, I feel certain, no necessity to ask you for any pledge. The honour of a gentleman is sufficient.\" \"Well,\" said I, \"I don't know. I feel as if I ought to take some sort of oath again.\" \"Why, to be sure!\" said Mrs. Robinson; \"swear Mr. Witherington on the key of his sitting-room.\" And the fair turnkey drew near and held me the key. Human stupidity is great ; I know it. But I. doubt if there is a single reader of these lines stupid enough to suppose that I did anything but kiss \u2014 the hand that held the key. ' ' Oh !\" said the darling, with a little fluttered cry, and fled, followed by the guardian, leaving a faint rustle of female attire in my ears, and a faint perfume in my nostrils. The door again closed. I was again locked in, alone with my thoughts. Alone with my thoughts. And what were they ? The only inconvenience that I seemed likely to be put to was one which, unluckily, involved another person \u2014 Mr. Burgess. But No,\" said I. \"Ah !\" said the medical gentleman, with an arch, patron izing smile, as if he thought I was in for a good thing, only that I didn't know it. It was now the turn of the seedy-looking thin man. He, also, produced an instrument, which had not, however, a very surgical appearance. \"What do you call those tongs?\" I exclaimed. \"Callipers,\" said he, proceeding to apply them to my head in various directions, while he dictated figures to the lady, who took them down on a blank form. When he had got as far as thirty-six, he stopped, saying \u2014 \" Highly satisfactory, ma'am, I assure you.\" \"Anything to pay you !\" said I. \"Nothing, sir,\" replied the seedy man, \"unless, indeed, you would like me to furnish you with a copy of the phreno logical analysis of your character, which I shall hand to Mrs. Robinson?\" \"Well,\" said I, \"that can wait. I don't know that a character is of much use.\" \"Indeed, I assure you, sir,\" interposed Mrs. Robinson, \"we wouldn't take you for the place \u2014 Constance and I \u2014 without a character.\" \"Oh,\" said I, \"very good; I hope you'll give me one to my next berth.\" \" I sincerely hope, sir, you will never need one. Indeed it is not likely. Our Constance has a strong constitution, hasn't she, doctor?\" ' ' Certainly ; fine, healthy girl, \" said the medical gentle man. And then he and the phrenologist were bowed out ; and Constance, with th; mesmeric eyes, was re-introduced. \" Constance, my love,\" said the elderly lady, \" what I am about to say is so momentous, that I wish you to be pre sent.\" \"Oh, certainly,\" says Constance ; \" I believe I know what is coming next.\" \"An explanation, perhaps, of all this mystery,\" thought I. \"Sir,\" said Mrs. Robinson, with matronly gravity, and laying her hand upon a prayer-book, ' ' I trust you have been brought up in our excellent Church of England?\" \"I have,\" said I. \"And could say the Apostles' Creed?\" \" No doubt.\" \"And would not object to sign the Thirty-nine Articles V \"Not in the least,\" said I, feeling inclined to add, as F 2"], [84, "THE \" FIFE ALLS.\" 72 I was so fascinated with the situation in which I found myself, that I at last resolved not to trouble myself about him, or about anything else in the world without. I was boarded and lodged for nothing. I was to have a pretty girl, accom plished and mesmeric, to talk to. I might, for what I knew, be destined for some Great End, towards which these women had the power of directing events. At all events, I was gain ing time, and I was away from Matilda Moggs ; and this was better than going for a soldier. I resigned myself, though of course not without fits of chafing and wonder. Two rooms were placed at my entire disposal : my bedroom was fur nished, as the advertisements say, with every luxury. My sitting-room, I was told, had been prepared extempora neously for me, all but the hangings on the walls, which had been there for some time. I found, in fact, that they had been put up for the purpose of concealing what was behind them. I was in a padded room ! After much reflection, I came to the conclusion that I was in an establishment of a new kind. \"This house,\" said I to myself, \"is a Madhouse for Love-sick Girls. Depend upon it, Constance is love-sick, and I am to be a deus ex machind to cure her. But what I am to do for her, goodness only knows !\" do I know whether she has got a mole anywhere?\" (I had been reading Sir Thomas More's \"Utopia.\") However, I re joiced a little in the opportunity which was given me by this advertisement of proving I was a person of some conse quence. So I showed it to Constance when she looked in to see me that evening, and asked her if she did not think I ought to go away. \"Certainly not !\" said the beautiful girl, with much em phasis. \" By no means,\" said Mrs. Robinson : \" we couldn't think of it. We are glad, sir, to have such a guarantee of the re spectability of your connexions. In fact, this advertisement is a reason for keeping you rather than for letting you go. My dear Constance, I am obliged to step into the pantry for a few moments. Will you carry on the argument with Mr. Witherington ?'\u2022' And the good soul left the room. As for Constance, she carried on the argument. \" And you are decidedly of opinion that I cannot be per mitted to leave this place at present?\" said I. \" Not until I give you up the key,\" replied the mesmeric darling, flushing. \" But how if I take it?\" I cannot, within the space at my disposal, give any detailed account of the manner in which my days passed, and of my frequent conversations with Constance and Mrs. Robinson \u2014 though I flatter myself they will be found interesting when I do relate them. Our chief topics were, what a nice girl once indicated to me as \" Love-and-Stuff. \" \"Oh, Mr. Wither ington,\" said she, \"I in so like your book ; it's all about love-and-stuff.\" But by the Law of Contrast, we necessarily came to speak of Nunneries. I believe I began it myself, by quoting Luther's letter of the 6th of August, 1524, to \"the Independent Nuns,\" and referring to \"the free convent at Kbnigfeld. \" In the course of these conversations I had fre quent reason to observe that Constance always appeared to lose self-control when convents and lay-sisterhoods came up, speaking of them with a vehement dislike for which I was at a loss to account. But it was very accountable, as I learned in the sequel. Reviewing my own position, I began to feel very easy about it. Every hour made me more in love with Constance, and the quiet manner in which I lived, together with good eating and drinking (for 'Mrs. Robinson kept an excellent table), were making me quite plump and vigorous. My anxieties in the conflicts with my uncle about Matilda Moggs had somewhat thinned and weakened me ; but I was now getting as strong as a prize-fighter, and as sleek as an Adonis. Whatever destiny awaited me, it would find me, then, in good condition. One morning, in pure vacuity of mind, I took an old penny from my pocket, and threw it up in the air, saying, gracious knows why, \" Head or Woman ?\" It came down Woman. ' ' I defy you. I can procure assistance. I can ring for James. Do not come so near !\" \" I think, dear Miss Burgess, we have pushed our logic as far as it will go,\" said I ; \" it is now time to have recourse to the ultima ratio.\" Uttering these words, I made a little spring towards the key, being just in time, and barely, to prevent Constance from putting it into her pocket. She did not, however, ring for James ; and we engaged in a dainty little struggle for the key. In short, I got it away from her, and held it up in triumph. \"And now you have got the key,\" said Constance, fixing her eyes upon me, so that I felt more than ever certain she was a medium {of some celestial force or other) \u2014 \"and now you have got the key, I will ask you to give it back to me, in virtue of your oath.\" \"Dear lady,\" I replied, speaking very softly; \"dear, beautiful lady ! pray accept the key, and let me renew the seal of my oath.\" Constance now drew nearer to me \u2014 of course, in order to receive the key. When she came close enough, I slipped one arm about her waist, and gave her a good sound kiss on her warm pink cheek. She snatched the key, and scuttled away. I was dreadfully in love with her. Time passed on, until my detention had lasted a sufficient number of weeks for my never very vehement feelings upon the mere subject of the restraint to have entirely cooled down ; and, in fact, I was a free man if I pleased to become so. Buttons, the page, was the only male person about the place, except now and then the gardener : and I could have made good my departure in a hundred ways, if I had so pleased. But I did not please, so strong was the fascination exercised by the eyes of that darling turnkey. Nay, I felt myself bound by a whimsical sense of honour not to attempt to penetrate the secrets of my prison-house. Only once did I trespass against the law I had laid down for my own guidance, when strolling in the garden I asked the page if this house I was in was a mad house. Did that mean that, after all, I was to marry Matilda? or that some hitherto unheard-of lot awaited me in this little world of women, where the very air I breathed was feminine ? The place was a very dovecot of girls ; my ears were yet filled with the fluttering and rustling of their plumage, as they had flitted about that gallery, on the morning from which my imprisonment took date. It was on Tuesday of the third week that I had again to be inspected and handled by another man ; this time it was a tailor. \"It were a maddus, once, sir,\" said he, \"but it ain't a maddus now : not without you're a madman, sir.\" \"No, my friend,\" I replied; \"no, I am not mad; I have, on the contrary, escaped madness.\" I was thinking, as you will guess, of what would have been my fate if I had married Matilda Moggs. Time flew quickly by, and Christmas was approaching. On the evening of the 23rd of December Constance was unusually serious. She had been crying, I saw, yet she did not look unhappy. Mrs. Robinson left her alone with me for a few minutes, and I, of course, inquired what she had been crying about. I say of course, because we had now come to be on terms of tenderness and freedom which had yet sufficient distance in them to make the situation piquante and stimulating in a degree that would, by itself alone, have prevented my life from stagnating. \"What, my beautiful turnkey, \" said I, \"is on your mind this evening ?\" \" Your fate, Mr. Witherington,\" she replied, \"is decided !\" and here she sighed deeply. ' ' Yes, it is all over so far as your destiny is concerned. Mrs. Robinson and I have done nothing but toss up for the last half-hour, and it keeps coming down Woman. It never came Heads once.\" \"Then my destiny is Woman?\" I was told that it was my duty to permit myself to be measured for a new suit of clothes, and that the \"style\" had been all settled for me beforehand. All I had to do was to submit my precious person to the tape of the artist. I did submit, without even asking who was to pay his bill. I must not omit to mention that I was permitted to see the Times. The maid who used to take away the breakfast things told me that Miss Burgess used to bring it into the room, and spread it out before the fire to dry, with her own hands. One morning I saw, in the second column, the fol lowing advertisement : \u2014 ' ' To George W ing ton. Unlesss you return be fore Christmas-day to your post and your duty, your uncle's will in your favour will be revoked. The said G. W. is sup posed to have enlisted for a soldier under a false name. Twenty Thousand Pounds will be paid to any one who secures him and restores him to his friends. He is about five feet ten,\" etc. etc. The advertisement proceeding to give an exact description of my person, down to a mole under the left shoulder-blade. \"Come,\" thought I, \"if Constance has read this advertise ment, she knows more about me than I do about her. How"], [85, "MARRIED BY MAIN FORCE. 73 \" Yes. That is the way we settled it beforehand.\" \" But, if you are unwilling to accept the oracle,\" said I, \" couldn't you toss up again, to see if you should abide by the result of the first toss-up ?\" \"Don't you think, Mr. Witherington,\" says the arch beauty, \" don't you think there would be something profane about that ? No ; I have invoked the oracle, and I will abide by what it says.\" Another, and a still deeper sigh. The white shoulders, as they rose and fell, nearly maddened me. pocket, and attend to the orders which she may send up by James.\" The morning was not so far advanced as to have lost its freshness when \" orders\" came, by the mouth of James, that I was to dress myself for going to church. For this purpose I was allowed an hour. At the end of that time my old friend the phrenologist was let into my room. After he had bade me good morning, he gave me a dig in the ribs, and inquired if I felt as if I could go through it. And James brought up a bottle of champagne, which we drank between us. \" You know I'm going with you?\" said the phrenologist, who, I perceived, had a new suit of clothes like myself. \"Yes ; come along, you know,\" said he, when James once more tapped at the door ; and before I knew where I was, I was hustled downstairs, across the front garden, and out of the gate into a carriage. We both got inside, and it drove off rapidly towards a church in the outskirts of the village. In a few minutes we found ourselves inside the sacred edifice. Not many seconds elapsed before I was followed by Constance, who was accompanied by Mrs. Robinson, the medical gentleman that pounded my ribs, and a couple ot young ladies. As for her dress, it was as little fit for the pur poses of baptism as my own. It was the dress of a bride, as mine was the dress of a bridegroom. The old doctor gave her away \u2014 to me ; \u2014 and the old phrenologist stood at my elbow. \"And is that what you have been crying about?\" said I. \"Believe me, dear Constance \u2014 dear Miss Burgess, I mean \u2014 I would accept an}- destiny that would gratify you! If it is Woman, let it be Woman. I dare say it might be worse, whatever it is. And as to Heads, let us lay our heads together, and see what can be done.\" Suiting the action to the word, I approached the mesmeric darling, and mingled my tresses with hers. She did not rebuke me, and I began to say incoherent things in plaintive murmurs. Then I kissed her\u2014 very much. But she suddenly started back. \" Mr. Witherington,\" said she, \" I forgot part of what I had to say. I am under the necessity of handing you over \u2014 \" \" Handing me over?\" I exclaimed, in much distress. \"Yes. To Mrs. Robinson.\" \"Oh, come now,\" said I, pleading hard: \"I'd rather you'd keep me.\" \" It's only for to-morrow \u2014 for part of to-morrow. But I want you to obey her implicitly in all that she commands. Promise me.\" Constance and I drove back to the house at Putney, in less than an hour, man and wife. I had been married by Main Force. At the first moment I could find I went anxiously up to Mrs. Robinson, and said to her \u2014 \" Must I ?\" said I : \" really f\" \"Yes, indeed you must. It would keep coming down Woman !\" \"This is all very well, and I love Constance madly ; but what am I to do with her ? I have made no way in my pro fession, and my uncle will cut me off with a shilling for not marrying Matilda Moggs !\" \" My dear boy,\" said she, \"Constance has a large fortune in her own right, and it is all even between you and her ; for you have been the means of saving her from a fate which she dreaded more than death.\" \"Well,\" said I, \" I promise.\" \"Thank you, George,\" replied my darling, and, turning crimson from her ears to her shoulders, darted out of the room, just as Mrs. Robinson entered it, handing to that lady her key \u2014 the symbol of her authority \u2014 as she passed out. \"Well, Mr. Witherington, your new suit is come home. You will find it in your sleeping apartment. And you will oblige me by reading over this evening in the prayer-book the Form of Baptism for such as are of Riper Years.\" \" Good heavens, ma'am !\" cried I, \"I assure you I've been christened and vaccinated, and all that ! Besides, what do I want new clothes for, to be baptized in ? Am I to be dipped ?\" Mrs. Robinson shook her kind matronly head, and reminded me of my vow of obedience. \"Oh, very good, ma'am !\" I said, \"then you and Constance are not going to spend the evening with me?\" \" No : we are very busy for a few hours. My advice to you is to calm your mind, and endeavour to obtain a good night's sleep. Is there anything Constance or I can do for you, in the way of preparing you for your destiny?\" Now the curious part of the business is that I was born on Christmas Eve ; and this question was put with as much solemnity as if I had been going to be hanged in the morn ing. Yet I felt sure I was not, and replied, with feigned nonchalance \u2014 And here we heard loud voices in the hall, and by-and-by an obstinate-looking old gentleman hurried in, crying, \"Where's Constance, where's my daughter?\" He was not long in finding her, and then fell upon her neck, exclaiming, \"Oh my dear! my dear! That horrid case in the Times has quite changed my views of conventual life ! I do not mean to put you into a nunnery now !\" \"And I don't mean to let you,\" said I, confronting Mr. Burgess. \"Pray, what have you to do with my Constance?\" he inquired. \"I am married to her, sir ! Married by Main Force this very morning !\" \"Married by Banns, papa,\" said Constance, weeping. \"It was my destiny,\" said I ; \"it would keep coming down, Woman.\" \"Yes, sir,\" interposed Mrs. Robinson ; \"we caught him just in the nick of time. We had him examined by a pro fessor of phrenology, and sounded by a physician, and we knew he was a deus ex machind.\" \" I assure you, sir,\" said I, \" that I was Married by Main Force. I couldn't help it. Up to the last moment I didn't know but I was going to be baptized ; for only last night your daughter's governess, the principal of this classical establishment, begged me to prepare myself for the morrow by reading the form provided by our church for the baptism of such as are of riper years. \" \"Yes, sir,\" says the widow ; \"and would you believe it, he thought it necessary to tell me he had been christened ? Ha, ha, ha ! Being a widow, sir, I know the ways of men. I wished him to make himself aware of the responsibilities which Constance and I intended he should take upon him self, and I knew very well, of course, that when young people sit down to the prayer-book they always read the service for the solemnization of matrimony, which is, in truth, a sort of baptism for those that be of riper years.\" \" And in fact, I did read it,\" said I. \" Nothing at all, thank you. I am quite ready.\" So, being left to myself, I took up the prayer-book, read first the part indicated, and then right on, Catechism, Con firmation, Matrimony, Visitation of the Sick, and even the Burial Service. I did not fail, either, to try on my new suit of clothes, and then to get early into bed, with an honest desire to obtain the good night's sleep which had been recommended to me. It was, when I awoke the next day, a beautiful morning. By some instinct or other I dressed myself in the new suit. I found a bouquet on my breakfast table, along with several pairs of white gloves. The Times was there as usual, and I read in it a long story of \"painful disclosures\" about some half-nunnery in the suburbs of London \u2014 neither Protestant nor Romanist, but something of a pinchbeck order \u2014 a story in which a bad \" priest\" and a worse \"Lady Superior\" had been playing at torture with the young ladies. Of course, I thought of the dislike which Constance always expressed for these institutions, but my mind rapidly came round to the bouquet. Inside the latter, I found two scented little billets. In one of them were the words, \u2014 \"From Constance,\" with the date, and nothing more. In the other was a plam gold ring, with these words \u2014 \" Mrs. Robinson has to request thai Mr. Witherington will place this ring in his left waistcoat \"But how does my Constance feel?\" asked the anxious father. ' ' Happy, papa !\" said the more-than-e ver-mesmeric darling. \" How, then does George feel?\" she added. \" Happy, papa !\" said I. \" If sir, there is any act of his life in which a man should be perfectly free to choose, it is that of his marriage. And I, in the exercise of the freedom of a Briton, chose to be Married by Main Force.\""], [86, "74 THE \" FIFE ALLS. \"Young man,\" said the grey-headed father, in a voice broken with emotion \u2014 \"young man, you have overcome me ; you have stiuck a chord.

Take her, then \u2014 with my fortune when I die, in addition to hers \u2014 take her, and bless you, my children, bless you !\" To end this romance. I soon leamt that my uncle had married Matilda Moggs, after having wasted a good deal of money on people with moles, and of about my own height. Whether Mrs. Robinson's Establishment for Young Ladies still flourishes at Putney, I do not know ; but I know it was illuminated on the evening of my marriage, and that, it that Christmas, any living soul in Putney missed having plenty of roast beef and plum-pudding, it was not my fault ; for I began squandering Constance's fortune directly. As for Burgess, his Christmas Annual never came to anything, but Constance has formed such a habit of bringing me a baby at Christmas time, that he is apt to joke me about my Christmas Annuals. If this goes on, I shall have \"about\" twenty children ; but that doesn't seem possible, does it ? A WICKED TFORLD! BY ANDREW HALLIDAY. IT is wonderful how many proverbial and popular sayings there are disparaging the world. Some of us \u2014 a good many of us, in fact \u2014 are constantly finding occasion to say it is a wicked world, a mad world, a weary world, a censorious world, a hard-hearted world ; but it is seldom that any of us find occasion to call it a good world. Taking the world in detail, we find many things to praise, but, viewing the world as a whole, we are always calling the world names. What has the world done as a well-regulated terrestrial ball \u2014 so well-regulated that it never makes a single mistake \u2014 to deserve this abuse ? dictions that it is possible to conceive. That idea is that we are to deny ourselves happiness in one state of existence that we may secure happiness in another. The enjoyments of the world are regarded as temptations \u2014 snares laid in our path by a Providence whose whole design in making this beautiful earth was to try us. The warm, bright sun is hung in the sky that we may prefer cold and darkness ; the fruits of the earth are made to grow in tempting forms that we may restrain our natural appetites ; the flowers are endowed with beauty and fragrance that we may have an opportunity of mortifying our senses. What a strange notion is this ! It presents to us a Garden of Eden, in which all the trees bear forbidden fruit. We are to leave all the sweet apples, so grateful to the taste, and sustain a miserable existence upon roots. Every one is to make a Tantalus of himself to please the whim of a capricious Jove, who has made man only to mock him. A fine idea this of infinite goodness and mercy ! ' ' Why man should feel pain, why our wretchedness should be requisite in the formation of universal felicity ; why, when all other systems are made perfect by the perfection of their subordinate parts, the great system should require for its perfec- tion parts that are not only subordinate to others but imperfect in themselves \u2014 these, \" says the good Dr. Primrose, ' 'are things that can never be explained, and might be useless if known.\" But there can be no obligation on man voluntarily to invite such evils, and it is quite possible for him to be good without suffering them. And with regard to those gloomy people who travel through life with solemn faces, protesting that the world is wicked and weary, I have always observed that when it comes to the push they are very loth to leave it. I cannot see that it is man's duty ever to be miserable or unhappy. Pleasure has got a bad name because we call those tilings pleasures which are not pleasures to the healthy soul and body. But real pleasures, those that we may enjoy innocently, why should we not pursue them always ? Your gloomy moralists talk of the pursuit of pleasure as if it were something very wicked. And I, forsooth, must be a very wicked person because I am always enjoying myself and always gay. The path of life is strewed with pleasures, which are clearly meant for man's enjoyment if he can enioy them. Man cannot put down his foot upon this so-called weary earth, this vale of tears, without treading upon some- thing that has been created to gratify his humanity. Look at the infinite variety of things that are provided for' the gratifi- cation of our animal appetites, and not only for our appetites, but for our most capricious tastes. The palate is endowed with the faculty of gratifying itself with a hundred\u2014 perhaps, I might say, a thousand \u2014 things not necessary to the mere sustenance of life. To take a very simple and familiar illus tration, our beef is not set before us without the accompani ment of salt, mustard, and pepper. The beauties of form and colour for the delight of the eye are infinite. Perfumes are as various as the flowers that gem the earth ; all nature is a choir of sweet sounds. And when the senses are weary with all this burden of earthly bliss, there is rest in the blessed forgetfulness of sleep. Science, the ingenuity of man, is every day discovering some secret treasure designed to assist the happiness of humanity. These things are hidden all about the earn like truffles, and we nose them out by the instinct of appetite or necessity. They are there for us, and it was meant that we should discover them, bring them to light, and enjoy them. A most remarkable example of the indulgence of Provi dence towards man is witnessed in the existence of the tobacco-plant. To my mind there could be no more signal proof of the Divine intention that man should have every Let us see who are the people who complain most fre quently and most loudly of the world. Strange to say, not the poor, the unfortunate, nor the habitually wretched, but the rich, the prosperous, and the well-to-do, those who have most cause to be satisfied with a world which yields them every gratification which the heart of man can desire. Poverty, misfortune, and disease give a wonderful zest to the pleasures which the world affords. It is not the hungry beggar in the street who rails against the world. Give him a meal, give him a bed whereon to rest his weary limbs, and he feels the world to be a very snug, comfortable place. He is ready for as much more of the world in the same kind as you like to give him. The victim of misfortune merely feels that he is in the wrong path. He is well assured that so soon as he gets upon the right one he will find the world a very delightful place. The invalid hopes for health, that he may be able to enjoy the good things with which the world abounds. The world is only wicked and weary to those who are sated with its delights, or who are incapable of ap preciating them. The material world itself sets such an example of brightness and cheerfulness, that it is quite won derful how any one can imagine for a moment that weariness could possibly be one of its attributes. The year dies in the gloom and bitterness of winter, but the fresh and young beauties of nature revive again in the spring. Nature is perpetually renewing her charms and multiplying her gifts. If man could only renew his life in like manner, he might live for ever without weariness, and find the world \u2014 even this so called wicked world \u2014 a paradise to all eternity. The sun is always shining, the flowers are always blooming, the birds are always singing, the golden grain is always waving some where in this wicked world. It is evidently intended to be a very pleasant world, and if we don t make it so it is our own fault. At any rate it is not the world's fault. I cannot imagine a more perverse, irra tional notion than that of certain gloomy people who regard the world simply as a place of probation, a place in which mankind has no right to be happy except in relation to another state of existence. Nothing, I think, can be more evident than that it is the purpose-of all created things on earth that man should enjoy himself \u2014 without abuse \u2014 to the full extent of his human nature. There is not a particle of anything which the world contains that is not designed for his use and enjoyment while he is here. The world is made for man's enjoyment, and man is made with every faculty for enjoying the world. We cannot well imagine \u2014 nor has any one ever contended for such a thing \u2014 that the gifts of the earth are intended to serve any purpose beyond the life on earth. It seems clear, therefore, that the earth was designed as a pleasant dwelling-place for man. And, having full opportunities of happiness here, why any one should be gloomy and sad in order to secure happiness hereafter passes all reasonable comprehension. The idea of the gloomy people with regard to life and its objects, man' and his destiny, is one of the strangest contra-"], [87, "THE DEAD OF THE YEAR. :\u25a0:\u25a0 kind of enjoyment on this earth than the existence of this peculiar plant. It grows in abundance ; it is not useful for the food of man or beast ; it appears to have no special medicinal qualities ; it is not an ornament, it is not a shelter. After three centuries we cannot discover that it has any other mission than that which it fulfils as a luxury for the enjoy ment of man in the form of tobacco to be smoked in a pipe. It is absurd to say that the taste for tobacco is entirely vicious and unnatural. The taste for it is universal, and the enjoy ment is the same in all cases. There can be little question, I think, that God made tobacco to be smoked ; that the weed is made to grow upon the earth for man's pleasure and enjoy ment. The whole world is a garden of Eden, teeming with fruits, not one of which is forbidden to those who can enjoy them without abuse. If a man be healthy in body and soul, it can be no part of his duty to be miserable. There is much cant, too, about the wicked people there are in this world. It is not the world that is wicked, some of the croakers sa)', but the people who are in it. I have known a good many of those people who are called wicked, whom society regards as bad and dangerous characters, and the better I have known them, and the more I have reflected about their cliaracters and their actions, the more reason I have found to regard them with charity, and even with liking. I have known, in my time, a good many of the world's bad men ; but I never knew but one who was utterly bad. In all cases but this one they had redeeming qualities, and in most cases the redeeming qualities preponderated. My experience of life leads me to exclaim, not ' ' what a num ber of bad people there are in the world, \" but \" what a num ber of good people there are !\" If I were to sit down with you now, and overhaul the characters of my friends and ac quaintances, I should find something good to say of all of them. I am encouraged to hope that some day I may discover an amiable trait in the single exception I have mentioned. Let me glance at one or two of the people whom society calls wicked. Here is a man who is always failing and becoming bankrupt. It is said that he is a systematic swindler, quite an inhuman person in his dishonesty. I know that he is nothing of the kind. He is merely speculative without the necessary talent for the business. He is more human than many who look upon him as a monster and a bird of prey. He is generous ; he has a tender heart. The wife and children who receive his loving embraces, and cling to his protecting arm, know nothing but his goodness. And the goodness is there. Here is another man who has the repu tation of being a ruffian and a blackguard. He is tender and kind to his old mother. Here is a liar, with a heart as true as steel for his friends. Here is a drunkard who will shake himself sober and go through fire and water for any one in distress. Here is a thief who will run his head into the jaws of Newgate to succour an unfortunate companion. They are not the worst men who break the laws and prey upon society. Cold, selfish, black-heartedness more frequently sits in a com fortable arm-chair, piously deploring the wickedness of the world. And yet these people, whom we regard as cold and selfish and unsympathetic, have their good qualities of one kind or another. We who look at them from a distance only see their bad points ; but there are intimate friends of theirs who know where to put their fingers upon some soft, tender spot which is hidden from us. I once knew a man who, for all practical purposes, was a very worthless person ; but theoretically, he had a great deal of good in him. He talked generous sentiments, and I believe, felt them ; he promised to do good to every one, and I believe, meant to perform his promises. But he was spoilt by a weakness \u2014 utter inability to carry his generous intentions into practice. It was so pleasant to hear him talk, that I could not think of him as an utterly bad man. Again, I knew a person who was gene rally very worthless, given to lying, not very honest, addicted to drink, a bit of a coward, disposed to boast ; yet he had a rare fund of humour, could tell a good story, could sing a good song. You could not detest him altogether. You said he was not such a bad brute, after all. And so you find some good in all things and in all men if you walk about looking closely at them with the aid of the lantern of charity. It is your surly Diogenes, with his flickering dip stuck behind the murky horn, who sees nothing upon the cheek but the stain of shame, nothing upon the brow but the brand of evil passions. For my part, with every new morn, I give you good day, my masters, and say, all things considered, it is a pleasant world for those who know how to five in it. THE DEAD OF THE YEAR. am Sawyer. By William And sound another form as meet. And poured my heart out at her feet, And swooned to yield her tearful face To the wild ocean for a space. And could I hold it fiercer pain To love and to be loved again ? Through the dead autumn days I go, Under cloud-skies that, hanging low, Deaden the colour and the light ; The clinging air is dense with blight, And ever falls on hill and plain A mist as heavy as a rain. I woke my heart from out its sleep, A later passion, pure and deep As a man's heart may know, I knew ; I saw her fair, I held her true, And thought her love my heart might bless, And crown my hfe with happiness. And, ah ! it was an autumn breeze Blew salt across the chafing seas, After a long night's angry gale, When I, at daybreak, sought the sail That from the offing, over-night, Had borne her almost to my sight. From the gaunt trees, else wholly bare, A wet leaf dangles here and there, Or shuddering drops. Beneath, the ground Is with a sudden drift embrowned, Not crisp or rustling to the tread, \u2014 The music of the leaves is dead. I held her true, I saw her fair ; No warning bade my heart beware The roseate lips that falsely smiled, The words that wantonly beguiled ; And, all too late, I grew to know My seeming joy my bitterest woe. This simple truth was hard to learn, \u2014 They are not harshest lips that spurn, They are not saltest tears that fall Above the dead, \u2014 worst, worst of all, Life's direst anguish 'tis to prove The loved unworthy of the love ! The httle sail I could not see, And, as in feverish agony I watched, methought the cresting waves On-rolling deepened into graves, Though their deep trough s were ever blue As heaven itself were shining through. All desolate ! And yet my heart Has in the sadness place and part, Nor mourns the autumn's golden prime, Ever a bright and treacherous time, That cheated it with light and bloom, And left it stricken for the tomb. From the rent clouds, as there up-stored, Sudden a stream of sunshine poured, Shaping a little isle of light. I did not shudder at the sight : Though to my eyes it marked the spot Where she had sunk, I knew it not ! Yes, I recall the splendrous glow Of autumn, when \u2014 the sun was low In kindled heavens quick with flame, \u2014 Through the red woods a goddess came A halo in her amber hair, And I looked on in heart-despair, I cannot doubt of this, as bent And crushed and broken, yet content In a dull, wondering sort I go ; This is the uttermost of woe, \u2014 And, see ! life's struggle wholly o'er, I curse the autumn days no more : And when I came to know, what praise Owed I the glorious autumn days, That all my misery had wrought ? I could but curse them in my thought ; Their treach'rous loveliness I cursed, Deeming my sorrow at the worst. Till my pale lips the silence broke ; Then, as in scorn, she answering spoke, And struck me with a pitiless, \" No !\" I reeled as reeling from a blow, And thought to die, yet was not slain, But lived to wonder at my pain. But now, low skies and stricken trees Can bring me comiort, bring me ease ; In the dull pauses of my grief The dead year comes to my relief : It is an echo to my fate, For it and I are desolate. The worst ! Not yet ; I did nqt know The taste of life's supremest woe.

By DUTTON Cook. myself unwittingly an intruder and trespasser in a Commercial Room, when my transgressions against its prescriptions have been somewhat rigorously regarded. I am inclined, there- fore, to rather republican principles in my opinions con- cerning inns. I like, at any rate, to find in them liberty and equality : about fraternity I am less particular. And I notice that in a Commercial Inn the existence of a privileged class, who pay much less the while they exact much more than I do myself, has had upon me an effect of a curiously irritating and annoying character. One autumn afternoon I stepped into the Crown omnibus at the Dunborough station. I purposed to remain one night at that hostelry \u2014 because, as I have shown, I could not pos- sibly help doing so \u2014 and proceed to Dunbay by the coach on the following morning. I had on my previous visits been very cordially received at the Crown. On my arrival they generally rang a loud-sounding bell, and the whole house, as it were, turned out and presented arms to me. I should have been contented, being an unassuming person, with a less ceremo- nious reception ; yet it had its flattering and gratifying side, in spite of the irrepressible suspicion that a welcome so im posing was somehow charged in the bill. The waiter had formerly overwhelmed me with attentions. He had appeared to devote himself absolutely to my service : sought to antici pate my smallest wants : supplied them with an anxious alacrity that was almost oppressive. I seemed to be the one particular guest to the assistance of whose necessities he had been looking forward since his earliest infancy. His grati tude for my presence in Dunborough appeared to be without bounds. He was never weary of contemplating me : even to the point of staring at me. I afforded him, so I could only con clude, an opportunity of employing satisfactorily his abundant leisure, for Which he could haidlybe too thankful. The land lord rubbed his hands as though he were rehearsing for Lady Macbeth's sleep-walking scene : such was his manner of demonstrating his delight at seeing me. The landlady curt sied when she beheld me, till her ribbons danced and ducked, as a ship might dip her flag in compliment to another vessel. The barmaid, framed and glazed in the bar, smiled at me from behind a barricade of decanters. The chambermaid, as I met her on the staircase, smirked approval of me to an extent that almost made me deem my going to bed at the Crown one of the most charming and meritorious actions of my life. As for the \"boots,\" the determined way in which that functionary pulled his forelock whenever I looked in his direction, must, I fear, have resulted ultimately in permanent injury to his scalp. My reception at the Crown was whilom of this nature. But now, it was clear things were changed. I had to lift down my portmanteau from the roof of the omnibus and carry it into the hall of the Crown myself : no friendly hands were eagerly outstretched as of old to aid me. The waiter did not recognize me when I informed him that I purposed to remain at the Crown for one night : nay, did not appear to hear me. I had to repeat my observation. He smiled vacantly ; gazed at the sky curiously ; flicked his napkin ; said at last he would see about it, and disappeared. He didn't see about it. I made my way to the bar. The bar maid was busy with the books : she did not even look at me. She ignored my presence altogether. The landlord brushed past me without paying me the slightest heed. The land lady said, \" In a minute,\" before I had opened my mouth to make my wishes known to her, and vanished. The chamber maid and \"boots\" did not present themselves at all. I stood in the hall of the Crown by the side of my portmanteau in a state of amazed discomfort, \"not unmingled, \" as novelists say, with indignation. Just then a man touched me on the shoulder \u2014 a tall, stout man, with a shiny broad-brimmed hat and blue spectacles. \"Why, what do you do here, old fellow?\" he demanded. I was some minutes before I recognized him. \" It's never you, Jack\" \u2014 I begun. ' ' flush !\" he interrupted me, and then lowering his voice, he went on ; \" Not so loud. Yes, it's me. But you needn't mention my name. In fact, I want it kept dark\u2014 I'm here incog.\" It was my old acquaintance, Jack Winter, whom I had known any time these fifteen years. And from all I knew and had heard of him, I was not so much surprised that he DUNBOROUGH is an old-fashioned market town in the West of England, returning two members to Par liament. It is very like a good many other old-fashioned market towns in other parts of England also returning two members to Parliament. It boasts a venerable stone church, a red brick Bank, stuccoed Assembly Ropms, and a lath-and plaster Town Hall. Its main or High-street is wide and open, well paved, and well lighted ; its diverging thoroughfares are narrow and confined, .ill-paved and ill-lighted. It is, upon the whole, tolerably clean, and exceedingly dull. Its chief interests are connected with the woolstapling trade and the com market. Probably by way of diversion, it further occupies itself with frequent squabbling with its rector ; with disagreement with the parish authorities concerning highway dues and turnpike trusts ; and with perplexing questions arising out of its water supply and the disposition of its sewage. But even these pleasant pursuits have not appa rently had the effect of exciting Dunborough to any excess of mental activity. In its High-street appear its two large hotels, the Bell and the Crown. The Bell is Commercial, and (speaking politically) Yellow. The Crown designates itself Family, and (still speaking politically} Blue. Allowance being made for these differences, the Bell and the Crown are pretty much of accord in relation to other matters. Both are firm supporters of the orthodox hotel keepers' creed : that men (and, for that matter, women too) are sent into the world expressly to sleep at inns in four-post beds heated to fever-heat ; to drink fiery port ; to devour greasy cutlets apparelled in bread-crumb suits ; to burn wax candles unceasingly ; to be attended by a large and mercenary army of waiters, chambeimaids, and \" boots ;\" and generally to pay exorbitant prices for tiresome services they don't require and for preposterous accommodations they would rather be without. It behoved any one wanting to go to Dunborough from London \u2014 it being far preferable not to want to go to Dun borough from anywhere \u2014 to travel down by means of one trunk railway line and two or three branches. The journey was not a pleasant one : involving much changing of car riages, shifting of luggage, tarrying at small stations, where refreshment or waiting rooms were unknown, and inevitable cold-catching from loitering on draughty platforms. Having arrived at Dunborough \u2014 as there was nothing whatever to see or to do when you had got there \u2014 the best thing was to quit the place again as soon as possible. The only excuse which reason able people ever had for going to Dunborough at all, consisted in the fact that they couldn't, without going there, ever hope to reach the charming watering-place of Dunbay, which was on the sea coast some miles further away. For the delights of Dunbay, travellers were content, for one night at any rate, to bear with the dolours of Dunborough. A four-horse coach for Dunbay started from the Crown at Dunborough every dayduring the season, and twice a week during thewinter months. By an ingenious combination on the part of the rail way officials and the coach proprietors, for the benefit of the Dunborough hotel-keepers, it was always arranged, howeve-r, thaLthe earliest train from London should reach Dunborough about five minutes after the coach had started for Dunbay. The traveller thither was constrained, therefore, to sojourn at the Bell or the Crown during some hours in the summer-time and some days in the winter : much to the taxing of his patience and his pocket, and to the enrichment of the land lords of the Bell and the Crown respectively. It was as a traveller to Dunbay \u2014 which place I took espe pecial pleasure in at one period of my life and frequently visited \u2014 that my acquaintance with Dunborough was forced upon me. I generally stayed at the Crown in preference to theBell, not because the Crown called itself a ' ' Family Hotel, \" for I was not a family-man but a lone bachelor \u2014 nor because it was politically Blue \u2014 for politics were matters of little con cern to me, and provincial politics still less. But it happened to be some dozen yards nearer the station than its rival ; and then, unlike the Bell, it did not proclaim itself Commercial. Unreasonably, perhaps, I have always entertained a prejudice against an establishment that sets apart certain of its cham bers to the mysterious uses, and recognizes the peculiar laws, tariffs, customs, and conventions of that class who were for merly known as Bagmen, and now call themselves Commercial Travellers. It has happened to me more than once to find"], [91, "DARK DEEDS AT DUNBOROUGH. 79 vvisncd his name to be kept dark, as he phrased it. On former occasions in the course of his career he had expressed a desire to the same effect : and for sufficient reasons. Indeed, I think he had remained incog, for the greater part of his life. \"I should hardly have known you,\" I said, \"with your beard cut off, and those spectacles on.\" He observed that he thought it was \"a good make up,\" and then again inquired my business in Dunborough ? I ex plained that I was only stopping there one night, and then moving on to Dunbay. He asked if I was quite sure that I had no other business in Dunborough? I answered, with some surprise, that of course I was \u2014 quite sure. He muttered something about some one being expected down from London, and then said he was afraid the Crown was full, and that I could not have a bed there. I said that in such case I would go over to the Bell. He assured me that the Bell was also full, but he thought a bed might be obtained for me somewhere in the town. I objected to that arrangement, and avowed I would quit the place altogether, if a comfortable bed in an hotel could not be provided for me. He said he would use his interest with the landladv, and see what could be done. I thought this rather a joke. But presently it appeared that he really did possess interest with the proprietors of the Crown. I was informed that a small upper chamber was at my disposal. Apologies were addressed to me on the score of the incommodious nature of this chamber : the Crown was very full, and no better arrangement could be made for me. I had no alternative but to accept these apologies and to take possession of my small sleeping apartment. It certainly was not a very ad mirable one. \"The Crown full,\" I said to myself, as I washed my hands before dinner, \"what's come to Dun borough? what's going to happen next, I wonder? Why, there's generally been room for a whole regiment of soldiers in the Crown !\" all men, to Dunborough. He had put to me a similar question. / had explained that I was journeying on to Dunbay ; but he had afforded me no information on the subject of his presence at the Crown. He had assumed an air of mystery which I felt it difficult to understand. He had declined to dine with me in the coffee-room ; pleading another engagement, letters to write, and business to attend to ; but he announced that he would take care to see me again in the course of the evening. Then it was evident that he was wearing a sort of disguise. Why had he shorn off his beard ? Why did he wear blue spectacles ? What did it all mean? I should have been more puzzled, I confess, if it had not happened that at all times Jack Winter had been rather an unaccountable person, with a kind of passion for the furtive and obscure, and a tendency about him to invest his every proceeding with a histrionic character, and a fictitious significance. His life, so long as I had known him, had .always been a kind of acted charade : the real solution of which was probably monetary embarrassment. At the same time his difficulties had always seemed to be a source of pleasure to him ; he had apparently enjoyed them, as other people are said to enjoy delicate health. He had never permitted himself to be depressed by them ; but rather regarded them as imparting a peculiar 'zest and stimulus to his appetite for the affairs of hfe. He had been long known to me as one of those ready, pleasant, sociable gentlemen, in whom the presence of per fect temper and good spirits is generally held to counterpoise the absence of any high tone of moral principle. He was liked without being quite approved of ; regarded without being much respected. With his abundant cleverness, he might, it was recognised, at any time bring his erratic and volatile career to a prosperous issue ; or it was equally on the cards that he might some day sink down inextricably deep in the slough of misfortune, and disappear from the eyes of his fellows \u2014 in which case of course the conventional sentence would be passed upon him : that he had only himself to thank for it all ; that no one could feel surprised at what had .hap pened ; that such a termination to his proceedings had been foreseen by everybody from the very first, and was only what might naturally have been expected under all the cir cumstances of the case. Of late I had rather lost sight of him ; his friends had avoided much mention of his name. It was generally concluded that he was under a cloud of a denser nature than ordinary. It was charged against him, too, by those who had the latest accounts to give of him, that he was now a more urgent borrower of money than for merly ; he had always been somewhat addicted to levying contributions upon his acquaintances. Men had overlooked this foible of his, so long as he had sought to borrow pounds ; but, rather unreasonably, they were inclined to be severe upon him when he reduced his request to shillings. They voted this \"really too bad of Winter !\" and seemed disposed to abandon all recognition of him for the future. How or where he lived was a mystery. He had no visible profession or means of support \u2014 though at one time it was said of him that he had been \"a dry goods\" merchant, whatever that maybe (I think \"wet goods\" were more in his way ) ; and at another, that he had been engaged in opera tions on the Stock Exchange. No one knew precisely where to find him ;,but then I am not aware that any one, except, perhaps, now and then a too-sanguine creditor, ever had any particular object in looking for him. He had lodgings at which he never lodged, and an address to which if you forwarded a letter it was sure not to reach him. He was a man who \" turned up\" at intervals. What became of him when he \" turned down,\" and disappeared, no one knew or cared to inquire. He was an adroit diver in the troubled waters of life, with a faculty for remaining a long time under the surface. He might come up bright, smiling, refreshed by his efforts, or he might exhibit himself, somewhat blown and distressed by the labours he had undergone. But which of the two he would do, was never certain. As to the exact point at which he had last gone down, I am without information. He emerged at Dunborough in apparently very good condition. He was well dressed, pros perous looking, and as it seemed enjoying the thorough confidence and regard of the host and hostess of the Crown. He had sacrificed his beard, and, as I noticed when he lifted his hat a little, he now wore a dark-brown wig. When I had last seen him, he had been very bald \u2014 for he was one of those fair good-looking men who lose their hair early in life, but whose luxuriant growth of auburn whiskers and beard seem to compensate for this diminution of their personal graces. Of I discovered afterwards that accommodation had been pro vided for me by compelling the waiter, notwithstanding his most strenuous remonstrances on the subject, to surrender to my use the room he usually occupied. My comfort, such as it was, was purchased at the price of the waiter's relegation to a most miserable loft over the stables. No wonder he regarded me thenceforward with a very evil eye. He had been on former occasions almost despicably subservient to me during the, comparatively speaking, adversities of the Crown. Now, in the days of its prosperity, he was disposed to be arrogant and insolent, with a feeling superadded that he had wrongs of a personal and private nature to avenge upon me. I had secured a bed-room in spite of him, but no other advantages should be mine if he could help it. My dinner, in the coffee-room, was made the means of a prolonged per secution on his part. He placed my table in a thorough draught. He mistook my orders, openly disregarded them ; he constrained me to consume my fish cold and flabby, and without melted butter. He carried away the cruet-stand when my want of it was at its keenest : he kept me short of bread, splashed me with gravy, deprived me as long as he could of the use of a fork, trod on my toes, and, making no apologies, turned a deaf ear to all my expostulations. When the barmaid outside made inquiry as to the number of my room, in order to debit the items I was responsible for to the proper account, he proclaimed publicly, with a loud laugh of derision, \" Oh, he aint got no number, bless yer ! It's the party as has took away my bed-room from me, without so much as saying thank yer for it !\" Finally, upon my ordering (dinner being concluded) the conventional half pint of port, \"for the good of the house,\" in the hopes that if it benefited me in no other way, its fire would at least warm me after my wretched repast, he brought for my con sumption a compound so execrable in its nature, that to drink it was to go as near to suicide as any man could, with a hope of surviving the operation. I could not have believed that humanity, under any conditions, could have displayed such an intenseness of malignity as that waiter demonstrated to me in revenge for my one night's occu pancy of his bed-chamber. Heartily I wished I had gone to the Bell. I felt I had been premature in my condemnation of Commercial Rooms and their rightful occupants. My only consolation was the reflection that after all it was but for one night, and that this dreadful man's pawer of annoying me must terminate on the morrow, when I turned my back on Dunborough, with no intention of revisiting it at an earlier period than I could possibly help. Meanwhile my thoughts turned to Jack Winter, and I asked myself what business could have brought him, of"], [92, "80 THE \"FIFE ALLS. say beforehand. We shall see what can be done. The ad mission will be by tickets only ; and the utmost caution has been exerted to prevent these tickets falling into the hands of improper or mischievously-disposed persons.\" \"I should very much like to be present,\" I said. ' ' Yes, of course ; no doubt ; to divert yourself by interrupt ing and disturbing the meeting, and endeavouring to hinder the manifestations, if there should happen to be any. No, thank you.\" course, he might be wearing a wig simply as a preventive against cold ; and he might have cut off his beard merely as a matter of caprice, or because it was turning grey. More over, his blue spectacles, it was possible, were the result of some visual infirmity. But taking all the three changes toge ther, I preferred to think that they signified a desire to disguise, for some pi \u00bb pose yet unknown to me, his personal identity. After dinner I stood on the steps of the Crown, smoking a cigar. Another traveller had arrived, bringing with him much and very heavy luggage. He had been expected apparently, and his rooms engaged for him beforehand. He was at once, and without parley, ushered upstairs. It seemed to me that he was received with all that obsequiousness on the part of the Crown and its servants with which I had been formerly greeted. Just then I found Jack Winter at my side. He now wore a thick great coat, with a comforter muffled round his neck, and concealing the lower part of his face : evidently still further for the purpose of concealment and mystification. The night was not nearly cold enough to warrant such provi sion against inclemency of weather. I offered him a cigar. ' ' The apparatus has arrived, \" he whispered, with alow laugh. \"What apparatus?\" I asked. He was busy lighting his cigar, and did not answer. \"Do you believe in spiritualism, old fellow?\" he asked presently. I answered, that I ratherthought I didn't. I inquired if \u00c6cdid. \"Well, the fact is, \"he said, laughing and winking as he spoke, \" I'm doing a little in that way just now.\" \"You don't mean to say, Jack, \" \u2014 I began, in a tone of indignation. \" Hush ! don't talk so loud, and don't give your mind to using needlessly strong language. If you don't believe in spiritualism, or animal magnetism, or electro-biology, or whatever else you like to call it, why, you know, there's plenty of people that do. Very respectable people, too. And if they want manifestations, or exhibitions, or lectures, or stances, why, of course, they must have them. Why shouldn't they ? The whole thing resolves itself into a question of supply and demand. If a certain lot of people keep up a steady demand for spiritualism, a certain other lot of people will, of course, take advantage of the state of the market, and supply the article required, with a due regard for their own profit. That's Adam Smith, that is ; and it's no use your saying anything against Adam Smith, you know, in these times. But I'm putting the thing on the lowest grounds in order to make it perfectly intelligible to you as a non-believer. For my part, I'm rather inclined to think \u2014 so far as I've stu died the matter at present \u2014 that there really is something in spiritualism.\" \"Jack, how can you \" \"Hear me out. I use the term spiritualism, because I find the word ready made for me, otherwise perhaps I should like to have adopted some other mode of expression. If I find myself possessed of certain powers \u2014 natural or unnatural I don't take upon myself to decide \u2014 over my fellow creatures \u2014 if I find particular actions of mind inducing very unexpected conduct on the part of others \u2014 if, by a peculiar course of ac tion on my part I can bend them to my will, and bring about results of a more or less desirable character, \u2014 well, it may be called electro-biology, spiritualism, or what not \u2014 I don't take upon myself lo decide \u2014 I simply say it's remarkable \u2014 quite worth while my looking into with a view of comprehending and reducing it to a system, if possible.\" \" Then, in point of fact, you've turned up at Dunborough a sort of Professor of Spiritualism?\" \" No. I am merely a vehicle or medium of influences to which \u2014 for very sufficient reasons \u2014 I forbear to give a name.\" Here he laughed and winked again. \"And are there many spiritualists \u2014 have you many fol lowers in Dunborough ?\" \"Well, a goodish number. But in Dunborough, as in other places, many devout believers in private, shrink from publicly announcing their belief. For, of course, the thing meets with a good deal of scoffing opposition. It's for the benefit of these retiring, bashful folks\" \u2014 he winked and nodded as he spoke \u2014 \"that we've arranged to hold a little private stance here to-night, in my room upstairs. It will be strictly private and confidential.\" \" And areyou going to lecture or operate?\" \"Lecture is not the word ; nor is operate either. I shall, of course, be present, and probably take an important part in the proceedings. But it will be more the meeting of a party of friends than anything else. There may or may not be manifestations of a remarkable character. It's impossible to I assured him that I would do nothing of the kind ; that my conduct should be unimpeachable ; that I would do all I was bid, and would not open my lips to say one word until he gave me leave. Finally, I prevailed upon him to accede to my request. He insisted upon my pledging myself to maintain absolute secresy as to all that might happen. Then he gave me a ticket \u2014 it was a whist counter. \" My number is No. i, \" he said, referring to his chamber in the hotel. \"In order to maintain strict privacy, my friends attending the stance will enter by the private entrance to the Crown, and gain my door by means of the back staircase.\" He lowered his voice as he continued : \"You will see a man outside the door of my room. Don't say a word, but slip the ticket into his hand, and he'll let you pass.\" At this moment, the traveller who had lately arrived with so much luggage, approached. It seemed that he knew Jack Winter. \"All right?\" said Jack to him, in a whisper. \"All right !\" he answered. Then Jack turned to me, and said \u2014 \" Come up in five minutes.\" And he went away with his friend. In five minutes I went up to room No. i, on the first floor. I gave my ticket or whist counter to the man I encountered at the door. That man was Jack's friend, the traveller. \"Take care, it's very dark, \" he whispered ; and then he admitted me into a large chamber, lighted at one end by a feeble jet of gas only. It was some time before I became accustomed to the dim light. When I had become so, in some measure, I perceived that about a score of persons occu- pied the room. It was too dark to make out their features, however. Moreover, the room was additionally obscured by clouds of tobacco smoke from pipes and cigars. I thought I detected also a strong odour of brandy-and-water. And my suspicions in this respect wrere confirmed when I pre- sently heard the sound of spoons stirring and glasses clatter- ing. I was somewhat surprised that the Dunborough spiritualists should prefer to give so convivial a tone to their stance. But, of course, I said nothing on that score. I was pledged to conduct myself with strict decorum, whatever I might see or hear. With some difficulty I found a vacant chair at the end of the room, and I took my seat in silence, waiting for the commencement of the proceedings. Presently there was a little shuffling of feet and some slight applause. I could just perceive that Jack Winter had entered at the other end of the room. But the first thing he did was to turn down the gas still lower. After which the room was almost totally dark, and it became impossible to make out with any degree of certainty what went on. I could not fail, however, to be struck by the fact that the persons attending the meeting appeared to take rather a jocose view of it, and its objects. There was some tittering audible and the buzz of amused conversation even after Jack Winter had begun to speak. Some moments elapsed, in- deed, before I was quite conscious, owing to the noise in the room, that he had commenced his introductory address. I concluded that either the Dunborough people were less .devout believers in spiritualism than my friend had led me to believe, or else the scoffers and sceptics in the town were not without representation in the meeting. There were cries of, \" Hear! hear!\" now and then, which certainly had a derisive ring about them, and must rather have dispirited than encouraged the lecturer. And once I heard a deep-toned voi\u00bbe, with a strong west of England accent, exclaim, \"All right, man! Cut it short! Come to the p'int!\" which adjurations seemed to receive approval and support from many persons present. I judged that the meeting was not composed of the most cultured and refined classes in Dun- borough, or surely more patience and self-restraint would have been evinced, considering the purposes for which the stance was held. In the situation I occupied I could not hear the words of the address very distinctly. It seemed to me that at the outset some explanation was being rendered as to the fact of"], [93, "DARK DEEDS AT DUNBOROUGH. 81 the room being darkened in the first instance, without, as was usual at such meetings, some attempt being made to encourage manifestations, if of an inferior kind, in a lighted chamber. Then the lecturer went on to state that all science, as the meeting must be well aware, was still in its infancy ; and that the science they had met there that night to inves tigate \u2014 if it could even be called a science \u2014 and he would not take upon himself to say whether it could or not \u2014 was in a more immature and inchoate condition than any other science. He reminded his audience that ridicule attended all discoveries, and incredulity dogged the heels of every inquirer. They must be prepared, therefore, for much derision and unbelief. He spoke humbly of his own position, and said that he was not himself able to explain the phenomena which he had witnessed on former occasions in connection with the subject before them, and which he trusted they might themselves have an opportunity of witnessing, at any rate, in some degree, in the course of that evening. He stated that he was only an instrument in more powerful hands \u2014 a vehicle, a medium, if they liked that form of ex pression \u2014 for the manifestation of an influence, concerning his possession of which, he found it impossible to give them a more particular account. But if any one present, more competent than himself \u2014 and he didn't doubt that there were many such before him \u2014 would come forward and throw more light upon the subject, he (the lecturer \u2014 Jack Winter) would be infinitely obliged to him. (At this there were cries of \"Turn up the gas!\" and some laughter.) Finally he expressed a hope that they would not quit their seats, nor move unnecessarily, while the manifestations \u2014 if any mani festation should ensue \u2014 were in progress. He said that he would not ask them to join hands, or \" form a chain,\" as it was commonly called, because he did not consider such a proceeding necessary to the successful development of the phenomena ; though he was aware a contrary opinion had sometimes prevailed. I do not profess to have given an exact account of the lecturer's address ; but its general effect was much as I have stated. What, however, I found it difficult to account for was a certain obviously burlesque tone about Jack Winter's manner and delivery. It was clear to me that he placed very little real faith in what he was stating. He had caught the conventional lecturer's method very happily ; yet he had added to it a certain element of levity and insincerity of his own. Whether this was as patent to the rest of the company as it was to me, I could not, of course, determine. They did not know him so well as I did \u2014 and it was possible this peculiarity escaped their atten tion. There was a pause of a few minutes. A few people coughed and cleared their voices, as they do in church, when the preacher rests to take breath in his sermon. But all conversation was stayed. Suddenly was heard the sound of an accordion, played by some one evidently very ill acquainted with the instrument. \"God save the Queen\" was feebly tendered, first on one side of the room, then on the other. But as it was perfectly dark, and the performer might, without difficulty, have moved to and fro while he played, this manifestation was not looked upon as very re markable. Presently there was some stir and excitement, and a good deal of murmuring. The figures \" i \" and \" o*| appeared on the wall, drawn with phosphorus. Then \"i\" and \"5,\" or \"15.\" After some hesitation these figures gave place to \"2\" and \"o,\" or \"20,\" with a note of ex clamation \" !.\" Thereupon the excitement of the audience was very great, and there was even some clapping of hands, though it seemed to me that it would not have been difficult for Jack Winter or his assistant to have performed this feat without spiritual aid. The accordion was next heard playing again. This time the air was, \"See, the Conquering Hero Comes !\" if anything, rather worse performed than had been the previous tune. And now I became positive that some person was walking about the room. Distinctly I heard a footstep near where I was sitting. Then I was lightly touched on the shoulder, then on the arm, then on the wrist. It was as though a hand were groping about in search of my hand. Another moment, and a small weighty packet was thrust into my palm and my fingers pushed down as though to enclose and hold it. After this I was left in peace ; and I heard the footstep moving away. Then came silence again for some few minutes \" I need not detain you any longer, gentlemen,\" said the lecturer's voice. \"I think we are not likely to witness any more manifestations to-night. Upon the whole, I think we have fair reason to be satisfied. Some really re markable phenomena have occurred, when you come to think of it. I have the honour to wish you all good evening.\" It was clear to me that he was laughing as he spoke, and I have no doubt that had there been sufficient light in the room, it would have been seen that he was winking, too. Then came a rush of light as the door opened. There was general hurrying towards it \u2014 great haste to get away \u2014 and much laughing, and pushing, and \" chaffing, \" even. The meeting did not seem to be at all seriously impressed by what it had witnessed. Whether everyone was as convinced as I was that the whole thing was a fraud and an imposture, I could not well determine. I made efforts to see Jack Winter, in order to put him in possession of my opinion ; but he was not forthcoming. I went down into the coffee-room, expecting that he would presently rejoin me there. But he did not come. I inquired of the waiter who occupied room No. i ? It seemed to me that he made an impertinent grimace at me as he answered that No. i had been engaged by a private party. I then asked, by way of saying something, and to show that I was not at all cowed or abashed by the waiter's enmity, as to the hour at which the coach for Dunbay started on the morrow. To my amazement and indignation I learnt that there would be no coach to Dunbay on the morrow ; the horses, I was informed, were required for other purposes. \"You mean to tell me, then, \" I said, \"that I shall have to stay here until the day after?\" \"Stay here until the day after? Certainly, sir,\" replied the waiter, with a smile of grim satisfaction at my discomfiture. Presently, I fancied it occurred to him that his triumph over me had its price. The longer I stayed in Dunborough, the longer I usurped possession of his bedroom, and condemned him to sleep in the stable loft. After awhile he said, with a change in his tone : ' ' There's the mail-cart. You might get on to Dunbay by the mail-cart, if you don't mind standing something to the driver.\" The mail-cart was the very thing. The mail-cart, how ever, as the waiter informed me, could not take my luggage. I resolved that that should be sent on afterwards by the coach. Better to be at Dunbay without any luggage, I argued, than to remain at Dunborough with it. At what time did the mail-cart leave Dunborough ? Well, the waiter admitted it was rather an \"ill-convenient\" hour. It left Dunborough at four o'clock in the morning, and generally arrived at Dunbay about half-past seven. \"You see,\" the waiter explained, \"the swells at Dunbay like to get their letters early. They subscribe for part of the expenses of the cart.\" It was an \" ill-convenient\" hour. Still I had said I'd go by it ; and go I would. After this the v. aiter regarded me with some return of his old approval. \" It ain't hardly worth while your going to bed, is it, now?\" he said, with an artful smile intended to betray me into an abandonment of the use of his apartment. \"Oh, yes,\" I replied sharply, \" it is. I shall get some few hours' rest, at any rate.\" The waiter's malign view of me returned. ' ' Perhaps you'd better pay your bill overnight,\" he said, \"for fear of acci dents.\" In saying this I fancy he dared to suggest a possi bility of my wishing to leave my account at the Crown unsatisfied. I asked him plainly what he meant? He ex plained, with an affectation of humility, that his only mean ing was that it wouldn't do to keep the mail-cart waiting : that was all. I asked if any one would be up at the Crown so early as four o'clock in the morning? He replied, with a sigh of despair, \"Oh, yes, there was no fear of his being asleep at that time,\" and murmuring a denunciation against stable-lofts regarded as sleeping apartments, he left me. I duly paid my bill. I left Dunborough by the mail-cart at four. There was nothing remarkable about the journey beyond the trifling fact that the driver never spoke a word all the way. He was sound asleep. We went over hill and down dale \u2014 the road sometimes being very steep and perilous and always very rough \u2014 but the man never woke. He held the reins in his hands, but he bowed his head upon his breast, fast locked in slumber. I suppose he had full confidence in his horse. Happily that excellent and sagacious animal was worthy of the trust reposed in him \u2014 betrayed it in no sort of way \u2014 maintained one steady pace, never swerving from the middle of the road, and brought us safe and sound into Dun bay, enormouslv, I don't mind confessing, to my relief and joy. Arrived at Dunbay, a thought occurred to me. In the confusion of quitting 'the stance, in my endeavours to find out Jack Winter and possess him with my views as to his shameful share in that imposture ; in my colloquy with the unfriendly waiter and my anxieties as to getting away from Dunbo rough by the mail-cart at four the next morning, I bad for-"], [94, "82 THE \"FIFE ALLS.\" gotten all about the little heavy packet placed in my hand during the so-called spiritual manifestations. I had slipped it into my pocket intending to examine it at the first conve nient opportunity, and never given it another thought. I would now examine it. I expected to find a stone or a lump of lead, such as I had heard were often employed at electro biological lectures. The packet contained neither one nor the other, but, to my great astonishment, twenty golden sovereigns! What was the meaning of that? I own I couldn't understand it at all. all now \u2014 there was a little miscalculation. That meeting you attended was composed of the members of the ' Dunborough Incorruptible Club.' Rather artful, wasn't it, converting it into a scientific spiritualistic stance ? Don't look so awfully shocked. ' The Incorruptibles' can turn any election at Dun- borough. It is necessary to secure them upon their own terms. Well, it seemed one of the members of the club couldn't attend the meeting : for a very good reason. He had died a few hours previously of excitement, it was said, brought on by the election. We didn't know it at the time, and somehow, in the dark, the little packet meant for him was slipped into your hands. But you don't seem to do justice to the idea of the stance It strikes me as splendid. I don't mind owning that I originated it. There were the ' Incor- ruptibles, ' if any question were asked, harmlessly attending a scientific meeting. The lights were put out as usual for the experiments \u2014 who can tell what happened in the dark ? I defy you to bring witnesses, or produce evidence, or to sus tain any charge you may choose to bring. Yet there they were all made comfortable, and their votes secured at a blow, as it were !\" A day or two afterwards I was walking up the charming little jetty at Dunbay, when I perceived before me a familiar figure sitting on a capstan smoking a short pipe. It was Jack Winter. He had discarded his blue spectacles and his wig and his broad-brimmed shiny hat. He now wore a wide-awake, and I saw by the prickly aspect of his chin that he had again abandoned the use of a razor. He recognised me and nodded and winked in the most friendly manner. \"I thought perhaps I should see you here,\" he said. \"I've come over for a breath of fresh air after that dreadful Dunborough, before I rush back to Babylon.\" ' ' I call it the most shameful case of bribery and corruption that I ever heard of.\" \" And now Jack, \" I began, \" about that stance f\" He in terrupted me with a loud laugh. \"Well, we did the trick,\" he said, \"You've seen the papers, I suppose?\" (I had seen no papers : nobody cared about papers at Dunbay. ) ' ' The ' Blues' triumphed. We brought in our man. We carried the election. A clean majority of twenty-four.\" \" What election?\" I demanded. \"Don't; don't call it that. I hate the word bribe. Call it sugar, or spice, or salt, or sauce, or paint, or varnish, or liquorice. Give it a sort of comic turn ; that's what people like ; that's the way to make things pleasant : even sin and wickedness ! We make the old gentleman himself rather an agreeable and attractive creature now by garnishing him with red tinsel and putting funny speeches in his mouth. I'm a nice beggar to preach, ain't I? But don't look so grave. Purity of election means being as pure as most other elections. Dunborough is no worse than plenty of other places. As for me \u2014 Oh, I'm simply ashamed of myself, if you mean that. But it is not my fault if you've formed exaggerated notions of my virtue. No ; I can't take care of the money. I wont have anything to do with it ! Dispose of it as you like. Drop it into the sea, or into the poor-box, or subscribe it to the next testimonial that's started. You wont have long to wait, I daresay. Good-by ! I must go now to catch the train.\" I but upon second thoughts, it forms no part of this history to relate to what use I applied the twenty pounds. As to my pledge to maintain secret the proceedings at the stance, I consider myself wholly released from that. A Royal Commission that has been lately sitting at Dunborough has brought its dark deeds to light very completely, and further concealment would be now absurd. \"The election at Dunborough, stupid. Was there an election at Dunborough ? \u2014 Of course there was. You saw no banners, bands, ribbons, placards \u2014 the usual signs of an election ? \u2014 No, of course you didn't. Nobody said anything to you about an election ? \u2014 No, because they took for granted that you knew all about it. You didn't come here by the coach, did you? No, because the horses were wanted to carry voters to the poll. For the rest we've gone in for per fect purity of election ! Only the legitimate expenses of poll ing, and hardly them, we were so awfully pure ! No treat ing \u2014 no opening of public-houses \u2014 no paid canvassers \u2014 nothing of the kind. Our candidate vowed he wouldn't spend a penny upon such objects \u2014 he'd rather forfeit his election ! They might take him or leave him, just as they pleased. But perfect purity ! \u2014 that was his motto \u2014 and it was carried out to the letter\u2014 perhaps/\" Here he laid his finger upon his nose and winked in a very curious manner. I began now to have suspicions as to the objects of the stance at the Crown ; to wonder, indeed, that my suspicions in regard to it had not been excited before. ' ' Look here, Jack,\" I said, and I took the packet of sovereigns from my pocket. \" How about this money?\" He laughed more than ever. ' ' You dropped into rather a good thing !\" he said. \"The fact is \u2014 I may as well tell you In conclusion, I have only to state that the unfriendly waiter at the Crown was true to himself and false to me. I make no doubt that to him I owe it that my luggage vas detained a week at Dunborough before it was forwarded to me at Dunbay. Meantime I was subjected to such annoy ances and discomforts as you can readily conceive. THERE'S 'S SOMETHING By Walter Thorni IN THAT. THORNBURY.

By the Author of \"Nicholas.\" will be all the happier if you think that you have helped to furnish at least one other table for the poor. The most dys peptic need not fear the consequences of this second banquet. There are good appetites amongst the destitute in workhouse or hospital, and the Christmas fare is relished wonderfully by those who do not often get so good a dinner ; but the founder of the feast, at any rate, need not be alarmed. Thus have we explained our assertion : do you not accept it ? The season of gifts is at hand ; and we, in a Gift-book, may surely say a word on the grace of giving ; we may recall, in type as well as picture, the necessities of the poor and the duties of the rich. \"There are so many impostors.\" Yes ; it is a lamentable fact, there are many impostors ; but hunger and cold are realities for all that. Nor shall we act wisely if we think that even all who ask for charity in the streets are necessarily rogues. True, the more sensitive suf ferers may creep away and he down in corners to die ; but some of them have the bad manners to come ' ' between the wind and our nobility.\" They are very rude ; but then, you see, they are also very hungry. Street-charity is the easiest ; and there is a great deal to be said against it ; yet, on the whole, perhaps the evils even of indiscriminate almsgiving may be exaggerated. You give sixpence to a ragged, squalid, miserable urchin ; your friend is quite right when he tells you the money will be taken from him by his mother, and spent in gin. Yes ; but if you don't give, his mother, deprived of her gin, will beat him within an inch of his life. The question is, whether it is worth a few pence to save him from a beating ? But, whatever may be said against charity of this some what questionable sort, no one need look in vain for institu tions which need his aid, and which deserve it. It is for these we plead. And now, as we commend the reader to his Two Dinners, we can only say, \" May good digestion wait on appetite, and health \u2014 on both. \" UNHAPPY \u2014 at any rate, in our opinion \u2014 is the man who does not thoroughly enjoy at least two hearty dinners every Christmas Day. The statement is a bold one. It may, perhaps, excite a little controversy. There is nothing we should like better. We shall have the children on our side at once. Two din ners ! Why, it is the very ideal Paradise of youthful Britons, who know not as yet what dyspepsia and indigestion mean. Two dinners \u2014 two turkeys \u2014 two plum puddings \u2014 why, there can be nothing to equal it \u2014 except, perhaps, four Clowns ! We speak, however, to those whose appetite, though good, is scarcely so all-devouring as a child's ; and we speak as men of a certain age \u2014 as men to whom the festivities of Christmas are, partially, a subject of terror and anxiety \u2014 as men who have suffered, and may probably suffer again. And yet, fearlessly, calmly, just a trifle defiantly, if you like, we re peat our assertion : unhappy are those who do not thoroughly enjoy at least two hearty dinners every Christmas Day. Patience, dear madam ! patience, dear sir ! Do not hurriedly denounce us as the greediest of gormandizers \u2014 do not cast aside the book under the idea that systematic gluttony is the favourite enjoyment of one of its contributors. Two dinners, we said, and we repeat. Let us analyse them, if you please, not with reference to the Bill of Fare solely. One of those dinners, of course, is the Christmas feast. Is there anything new to be said about that f Surely not ; and yet the things which are old may be said again and again, and no one shall find them trivial, or wearisome, or impertinent. Not easily do we tire, we home-loving English, of praising that one banquet in the year which, of all others, we care for most ; since still, much as the times may change, it does bring together the scattered members of many a family, and strengthens old loves, and turns away strife. But the other ? Well, the other you eat vicariously. That is all : \u2014 but it is a pleasant way of eating, too ; and your own enjoyment MY GREAT UNCLE BENJAMIN. My great uncle Benjamin \u2014 ages ago, When ruffles and powder were quite comme ilfaut \u2014 Was looked on as rather a bit of a beau, And a terrible pet with the ladies. Now wrists are unfettered by ruffles of lace, And powder has flown from the head to the face : Old-fashioned politeness is quite in disgrace, And my great uncle Ben is in Hades ! For, lo ! \u2014 he scarce knew how it all came to pass \u2014 He found himself down on one knee on the grass, Attempting a speech that was far from first-class, Wherein lifelong devotion he vowed her. And she \u2014 why, she whispered a word, which, he swore, Made the sunshine seem three times as bright as before- Made the buds and the blossoms burst forth more and more, And the lark carol sweeter and louder ! 'Twas a toast and a beauty he chose for my aunt \u2014 Just picture her face and her figure \u2014 you can't ? Her portrait hangs there, by the period's Grant, (At his zenith they reckon this one done) . She was highly accomplished, could play at piquet, Paint on velvet, knit, glide through a grave minuet, Sing a ballad, discourse on the harp and spinet, And talk French like a native \u2014 of London. Now her father, old Alderman Dendy, was rich, And my great-uncle Benjamin wasn't. The which In the course of true love had occasioned a hitch, But for nunky's devotion and courage. \" For her, welcome trouble !\" he cried, \" In life's cup, As in one of good cider \u2014 you'll own at a sup That a slight taste of bitter but brightens it up- Just a handful of blue-blossomed borage !\" So he went off to sea in a merchantman, bound For the Indies ; some dozen times sailed the world round ; Made a fortune ; returned in six years ; and then found That his Barbara'd faithfully waited ! They were wedded ; and \u2014 though I wont venture to say They ne'er had a tiff or a huff from that day \u2014 They vowed on their conscience, when old and grown grey, That neither repented they'd mated ! For the rest ! on that mantelpiece there, if you please, You'll see two small ivory-carven Chinese, That great-uncle Benjamin brought o'er the seas ; Some muslins from Hindustan's rare looms ; Aunt Barbara's portrait, a pretty French fan With some verses Ben wrote when a very young man, And some old silk brocade that you've seen on our Anne ; These are all that they left us as heirlooms. Hist'ry does not relate how acquainted they came : They did not make love, though, at first \u2014 they made game, And fluttered like two pretty moths round their flame \u2014 A weakness that moths are all apt to. Thus, for foolish young turtles, his surest of nets Dan Cupid, the fowler, ingeniously sets ; And, as soon as his prey within reach of them gets, Hey presto ! the cage-doors are clapt-to ! They walked out together one morning in May (I think it was somewhere down Kensington way), When the meadows were green, and the orchards were gay With blossom of cherry and apple. In vain now for meadow and orchard you'll search ; That spot, by all greenery left in the lurch, Is the site of four gin-shops, a terrace, a church, A crescent, two streets, and a chapel. Well, they came to a stile, where fair Barbara put On the cross-bar, in climbing, a neat little foot, Just a tootsie (diminutive, vide sub \" toot\"), And no longer the petticoat hid it. And Ben saw an ankle so dainty and slim \u2014 Well, she said her wit made a captive of him, But privately he \u2014 (keep it dark, at least dim !) \u2014 He vowed 'twas the ankle that did it. Heigho ! they've been buried these ages, alas ! Have grown up long since into daisies and grass. 'Tis enough (when we note how our little lives pass) To make poor humanity grovel ! To think such a heart, full of honour and trust, And such beauty (though beauty is only a crust) Should be now but a pinch of unlovable dust In a clown's indiscriminate shovel ! T. H."], [99, "( \u00ab7 ) SINGULAR SHOPS IN LONDON. I KNOW many people who come to London\u2014 run up for a week or so\u2014 not for its sights, certainly not for the season, but simply to look at its shops. These may be likened to a great picture-book ever opened, which affords pleasure to most people, and which all read with different eyes according to their lights. For it must not be imagined that a mind is cosmopolitan enough to take them all in. Indeed, different shops strike different tastes, as pictures do. Just as some connoisseurs will look at nothing but Turners, so others will notice nothing but the book-shops, or those famous for old china. Every man to his bent. To satisfy the extraordinary idiosyncrasies of human nature you must have a great popula tion ; and perhaps, in this respect London presents features such as no other city in the world can boast. Has any one ob served that in the anatomy of commercial London not two great thoroughfares are alike ? Let us take Regent Street, for instance, and compare it with Piccadilly ; what a different kind of life prevails in either. The former is pre-eminently the pleasure street, where the last new novelty is exposed, the bright but superficial ornaments, the attractive fashions, the pinchbeckery, if we may invent a term, which singularly con trasts with the staid respectability, or the solid worth to be found in the shop-windows of Piccadilly. The very people passing along the streets are of a different class\u2014 as different as the dwellers in one country differ from those in another. Let us take Fleet Street, again, and we find still another class, and we may go from street to street and yet find that London is made up of many parts, and Londoners match these different parts just as the fauna of the globe inevitably fit its flora. This fact gives to the different streets of the me tropolis an interest which otherwise would be wholly wanting. The sameness of continental towns arises from a want of this distinct variety. When you have seen the shops of Paris, you have seen the shops of France, one ' ' magazine \" is as like another as two peas. With us, on the contrary, to pass from street to street is hke passing into a new district, if we may be allowed to use a httle justifiable exaggeration. Go along the New Cut, for instance, at ten o'clock on a Saturday night, or any other night, and then stroll along the Strand \u2014 the contrast is like moving from China to Peru. The Hay market towards the small hours, again, though noisy and brilliant, is no more like the brilliancy of the Borough Road, than an apple is like a China orange. It is this charming diversity that redeems this great Babel of brick and mortar to those who know it, from that change of utter sameness, which it presents to mere superficial observers. As the people so are the shops ; we may take this as an axiom. And as the visitor wanders from street to street, he seems to be going upon his travels through different countries. But we are more particularly concerned in different shops, especially in those which minister to the wants of the curious and the artistic. Such can only be found in perfection in great cities ; where, for instance, could such an odd corner as Hanway Yard be found, except in a great capital. Imagine a street given up to cracked china, old coins, worm-eaten furniture, and clouded canes. We question if this quaint remnant of antiquity has changed since the days of Queen Anne, and we expect nothing less than to see a gilded coach clatter along, and people passing in and out of the shops in powdered wigs. W ardour Street is another quarter given up to the past, but we see with regret that it is gradually losing its medi\u00e6val character, possibly the antiquarian taste has got beyond the grotesque clumsy age of the Tudors ; at all events, the ecclesiastical establishments, where church fur niture may be seen, furnish far purer designs after a still more ancient date. The church furniture establishments are a genuine new growth. How the old Tory gentlemen of the days of George III. would have stared at the ranges of Apostles, the Virgin Marys, the St. Michaels, and St. Georges that meet our vision in these places \u2014 that England had gone over to the Beast would have been the lightest conclusion they would have come to. There are some old printshops about town, again, which still keep in the old ways, carefully excluding anything that is much less than a hundred years old. There is a curious and noted establish ment of this kind in Bedford Street, Covent Garden, where, from week to week, some quaint portrait by Sir Joshua of the old beauties is sure to be seen. There are habituts that as regularly pass this way to see some Lady Sally or Lady Betty (of an age when there seemed more beauty going than in the present day) as they eat their dinners. Old London here again meets the eyes of the curious in such matters. The scenes are shifted with great regularity, as though to meet the requirements of the old fogies who, hke woodlice, live upon the remnants of the past. Not far off, in King Street, there is another very curious estabhshment, which seems to be the great emporium for old caricatures. Gilroy lives again in this window, and a class of caricatures of a still more gross character. Nothing so well shows the change that has taken place in the public seeling of England within these last sixty years, as a portfolio of political prints that have been issued within that period. It seems scarcely credible, that our grandfathers and grandmothers should have habitually laughed at such disgusting sketches, and many of them withal so poor and gross in their humour. How they could have passed muster in West-end drawing-rooms, without raising a blush in any but the coarsest-minded persons, is cer tainly astonishing. The contrast between the political squibs of the time of Pitt and Chatham, to say nothing of those of an earlier date, and the public skits with which we are favoured now, is one of the best tests we have of the elevation of English sentiment in such matters ; and sentiment in this respect means intellectual refinement. There are other curious things in the window of this shop which always make it attractive. The odd fashions in dress that have pre vailed from time to time, the odd characters that this Eng land of ours has produced, may generally be seen set forth in some curious etching. It is scarcely necessary to observe, that it is to the by-streets that the purveyors of things that are curious generally retreat. The dealers in such articles are generally characters themselves, and feel out of place in the rush of business which distinguishes our great thorough fares. Covent Garden seems to be a favourite parish with these old dealers ; they seem to be the lingering ghosts of the tradesmen of the old generation, with whom this quarter was once fashionable. King Street, I am now lingering in, seems a nook \u2014 although now Garrick Street is opened not a quiet one \u2014 in which many old establishments flourish. For instance, there is Stevens, the auctioneer's, at which, perhaps, the most singular sales take place of any establishment of its kind in London. One day, it is a collection of the rare fowls, the next, perhaps, it is philosophical instruments ; then, again, it is rare plants, or the apparatus of the photographic studio that come under the auctioneer's hammer \u2014 anything, in fact, but what we ordinarily expect to fall within the province of this worthy. Not far off, at the corner of Southampton Street, to those interested in the photographic art, there are great attractions for the lounger. This is, we believe, the only establishment devoted to this beautiful art in London, consequently it has become, as it were, an institution \u2014 a public exhibition which is free to all. Although the art of photography was first perfected in England, we see, by the French and German specimens exhibited in these windows, that we by no means monopolize all the skill in their production. We may ask by the way, however, if some of the copies of the French pictures, especially those of Gerome, are not a little too nude to suit English ideas. Nevertheless, the exquisite art which distinguishes them takes them out of the category of simply voluptuous pictures. But the greatest attraction is the portrait gallery of English women and men. The new art as applied to portraiture is necessarily popular, as we are all desirous of knowing the features of those who are famous or infamous, as the case may be. There are very few persons that have not been photographed once in their lives, consequently their negatives are always in existence, and may be printed from at a moment's notice. It is odd to think that there is a double, as it were, of yourself lying by on some shelf, ready at any moment to send unlimited copies abroad of your visage. It is this power, used sometimes most unjustifiably, that keeps us posted up, as it were, in the fea tures of every person whom the public desire to know any thing about. It is rather hard, however, to know that if any misfortune happens to you, there are cunning fellows ready in the moment to buy up your effigy and sell it to the highest bidder ; some negatives thus surreptitiously obtained have proved little fortunes to the lucky possessor. There is one shop in Regent Street at which cartes de visite of every person in the world of any public notoriety may be pur chased. I don't allude to the great portrait gallery of notorieties which no one passes without inspecting, but a much quieter establishment higher up the street. Whilst in this fashionable thoroughfare we must not forget"], [100, "THE \"FIFE ALLS.\" 88 As a rule, it may be observed, that what may be termed curiosity shops, keep more particularly to the West End ; at all events, very few are to be found within the City proper. City shops are in the main devoted to the supply of living wants and modern tastes. People live too fast there to care much aboujt the left-off trifles of their great grandfathers ; it is questionable, indeed, if many of them had such respectable progenitors. It is to the future, rather, that the frequenters of London proper look, and the demand has called forth the supply in the shape of shops in which new inventions only are displayed. There are two or three such places in Fleet Street and Cheapside, the study of which the lounger should not neglect. Here he may see the domestic contrivances of the time to come : how we may draw a cork without disturb ing the bee's wing, shave without cutting the chin, pare apples and potatoes on scientific and exact principles, and cook a dinner for half-a-dozen people with twopennyworth of coal. No man can consider himself up to the level of the civilization of his day, unless he carefully watches these shops. To revert once more to toys, however, there is one class of shops which were not in the days of my youth. The model steam-engine shops. In back streets, even in work ing opticians' windows, miniature steam-engines, real work ing engines can be purchased, and a clever lad may now construct his working steam-packet, where of old his mind never soared above a cutter, and even those who stick to cutters find their labour wonderfully lightened by being able to purchase any part of a ship they may require. These model-ship shops are a singular example of the avidity with which the wants even of children are sought out and satisfied. the curious Japanese shop on the right side going down. There is always something strange and eccentric to be seen in its windows. We catch glimpses of Japanese literature in the illustrated books that are enticingly placed open for in spection. The woodcuts, or rather etchings, always dis play some sanguinary deed in the act of being perpetrated. It is either some gentleman committing the \" happy dis patch,\" in other words, disembowelling himself; or it is some vengeful husband sacrificing his wife. If this singular people are not belied by their own books, their domestic manners can be by no means attractive. But, irrespective of their literature, it is curious to see the ingenuity the Japanese display in the production of all the mechanical contrivances which we fancied the western nations alone understood or used. There is scarcely an implement ordinarily employed by an Englishman the Japanese are not also familiar with, and moreover they often construct them upon a more ingenious plan than we do ourselves. The Chinese and Japanese have long looked upon us as barbarians, and really, to judge from the civilization they have been possessed of for ages, there can be little doubt that we were indeed barbarians as compared with themselves only three or four hundred years ago. Even with all the expenses of carriage from the other side of the globe against them, in many articles they can undersell the Londoners, as we may see by the ticketed specimens in this shop. The schools of design are evidently beginning to tell upon our manufactures, especially upon those of a more delicate and precious nature. We need not leave Regent Street to see that within these last twenty-five years our glass and china have made a greater advance than they did for a century pre viously. All middle-aged men remember the willow pattern plate as the design to be met with in two out of every three middle-class houses. Now it is nowhere seen or met with but among the lower classes. Pottery of all kind, and ceramic ware havepassed from the domain of the mere manufacturer of old used patterns, to that of the artist. There are two shops in Regent Street where a man of artistic temperament may see many things that will delight him. A teacup or a glass, delicately fashioned and ornamented at a cheap price, is as great a sign of the improvement that has taken place in the artistic development of our nature as we could well show. Art manufacture has penetrated farther down in the scale than the houses of Minton or Copeland, although it is to their shops that we must really go for a refinement, which, price considered, at least gives us the lead of foreign nations. Perhaps, for instances of popular art, the children's stories and the fairy tales deserve to take as high a place as any other. The story of Johnny Gilpin, for instance, with its vivid pic tures painted and worked by machinery in many colours, is certainly a masterpiece. When we compare children's toy books of this age to those of the last, it looks as though we were .living in another world. The colour-printing of the present day ought to educate the rising generation in a sense they have long been deficient in. Towards Christmas, the popular booksellers' windows present a perfect posy of colour. What a shame it is that we are not all children ; once more to see Jack climb up the beanstalk, almost as naturally as he did in the life, as an Irishman would say ; or Cinderella drive away to the ball in still brighter hues than our liveliest imagination ever conceived her to have done. And whilst our young people are thus fed upon the brightest of flowers, the old and the curious are day by day finding their taste, for the most worm-eaten and grimest of folios, is by no means neglected. There are one or two shops in King William Street, Strand, filled with ancient books, half-opened, so as to display their frontispieces. This is a kind of ground bait thrown out to attract antiquarians, two or three of whom may generally be found lounging about the windows ready for a nibble at anything that is particularly worm-eaten. Nothing strikes the observer more than the manner in which the shops for the sale ot old books have increased in London of late years. We do not mean black-letter books only, but volumes printed in the middle of the last century. What were once the refuse of the old book-stalls, have now become valuable property ; the consequence is, that the old book-stall has lately entirely changed its character. It is no longer the resting-place of the sweepings of our grandfathers' libraries. The cheap books of the day now very largely take their place. Those who remember Holywell Street twenty-five years ago, now can scarcely recognise it ; the old books have moved up in the world, and the cheap literature of the pre sent day has taken their place in what was once their strong- Strangers are struck with an odd fancy the patentees of certain filters have of turning their shop windows into little specimens of landscape gardening. There is a shop in the Regent's Quadrant in which the countryman may fancy he is looking into a little shady pool in a country lane. It is certainly an odd thing to find ferns growing with almost tropical luxuriance in a shop window, and fish diving in and out beneath their deep shadow, as naturally as though they were in some quiet country pool. Another water-engineer, in Fleet Street, has made a pond in his window, adorned with foliage, for the purpose of displaying various forms of gar den fountains. Cheap-trippers gape at these trading freaks with astonishment, looking upon them as so many bits of country captured and confined within the heart of the town. These little contrivances are, however, a testimony to the powerful interest the citizen takes in the scenes of nature. He may be a slave to his shop or his warehouse, but in his villa he must reproduce \u2014 cockney fashion, it is true, and on a toy scale \u2014 the natural scenes of his youth. There is one class of shop which exists at the west-end of town, which I must by no means omit to notice : the cheap shops where every thing is sold from rocking-horses down to hair-pins. These shops seem to be instituted for the purpose of meeting the demands of persons with limited money, inasmuch as the purchaser may buy anything he sees, however imposing, for nalf-a-crown, or can command the range of a very large number of articles for a penny. The principle on which the shopkeeper appears to proceed is, to keep every article he sells within the limits of very small coin. It is really aston ishing how many things you can buy for a little money, and how many very respectable people there are who find it con venient to deal at these shops. I confess it is principally women who frequent these establishments in Westbourne Grove and the Edgware Road. Their success testifies to the fact that they supply a great want, and that there are a great many apparently well-to-do people who are obliged to look sharp after their coppers. The misfit shop is another mysterious establishment which puzzles many people. Under this \" blind\" there are various establishments in which articles of apparel, boots, shoes, eye-glasses, umbrellas, and odd personal matters are ticketed at exceedingly moderate prices : they do not look decidedly new, and they do not look worn : there is a suspi cion that they are unredeemed pledges, weeded out of their stock by pawnbrokers \u2014 at all events they represent a fading gentility of some kind, and are particularly mournful esta blishments. The odd features of commercial life in the metro polis are, however, inexhaustible, and I have only touched upon some of the more obvious examples. But a volume may be written upon the curious shops of the great metro polis. hold. A. W."], [101, "89 A FAIRY TALE. I built me a stately palace home, Set far in the crystal sea, \u2014 And which was the brightest, water or sky, I wot I could never agree ; For that calm blue lake, called \" Life,\" gave back The skies themselves to me ! While the days passed on like a fairy dream That ended too speedily. Alas ! for the beautiful towers and spires, And the faithless architects three, \u2014 Who built those lovely but fading forms. In the midst of that seething sea ! For a day of tempest and terror came, In the prime of my bliss to me ! To build that pleasant fairy bower, Deep hid in the silver sea, By mighty skill and magical art, I summoned architects three ! Who gave their united skill to rear This glorious home for me ! For careless Youth the foundations set On a shifting strip of sand, \u2014 And Beauty had laid her shining hues With a frail and a faithless hand ; While Hope's fair pinnacles fell before A viewless enchanter's hand. To earnest Youth, with his glowing eyes The foundations vast I gave, \u2014 And bid him plant them in ocean firm To strive with the wind and wave ; He promised to bury them deep and fast, Ay ! deep and fast as the grave ! Oh, slowly, slowly, and slowly down, \u2014 I witnessed it sink and flee, \u2014 The glorious arches, and beautiful hues, Faded and vanished from me, Till I stood alone, \u2014 in a little boat. On the pitiless dreary sea ! To Beauty I trusted the shining walls, And taxed her utmost skill, To raise me a fanciful fabric, bright With the hues of her own sweet will ! Then the graceful gilded cockle-shell Too frail for the stormy blast, \u2014 Reeled madly (its filmy butterfly sails All rent from the slender mast), \u2014 It quivered and rocked like a living thing, Till it sank in the sea at last ! Ah ! fair indeed was her handiwork, In my dreams I see it still ! To Hope I committed the delicate spires That rose in the cloudless air, \u2014 They soared so high with their slender shafts, They seemed to be reaching there. Sure never was palace builded yet With my sea-bower might compare. But a poor little bird I had slighted long, Lent me its wings, to flee From the terrible wreck of my fairy home, In the midst of the silver sea. Then Pleasure gave me a golden boat, To sail on the crystal sea, That girdled my spell-raised palace-bower And kept it secure for me : It taught me to soar on a higher flight, Where a better home might be, \u2014 And that little bird (whose name is Love), Is all the world to me ! 1 F F.

But with gravest look and air She says to one and other, \"I likes you all, but 'member this, I loves my only mother I\""], [102, "90 THE FIRST ENGLISHMAN IN JAPAN. BEING A HISTORY TRANSLATED FROM THE PICTURES ON A JAPANNIKIN.* IN the beginning of the reign of the Emperor Bri-Ksi- Wee-K see-Wi-Ksee, a certain Sin-Song- Pol-Liw-On-Tu, a Daimio, while taking the air upon the sea-shore not far from Kokodadi, in the island of Yeso, became aware of a large junk which was stranded on a reef a little way from land. His benevolent soul immediately busied itself in won dering whether the sailors had all perished, and if so whether he had not better take possession of the ship and its contents, when a curious-looking stranger approached, and explained by signs that he was the only survivor. The tender-hearted Sin-Song was moved by the thought, how lonely this poor creature was now he had lost his friends, to knock him on the head and bury him in the sand. But his charitable idea was immediately dismissed, the stranger being tall and mus cular, and likely, from an ignorance of the Japanese tongue, to mistake the nature of Sin-Song's disinterested kindness. Sin-Song's nobility of character was rewarded. The stranger drew forth a tall -bottle or flask of dark green, semi transparent porcelain, on one side of which was enamelled the maxim, \" Pi-Nap-Pel-Rum.\" He gave of its contents to the Daimio, and from that moment \u2014 or shortly after, for Sin-Song's first impulse was to secure the foreign curiosity for the Emperor \u2014 the stranger and the Japanese noble became inseparable. Through Sin-Song's interest the stranger, who presently learnt enough of the language to explain that his name was Vi-Li-Ams-Mit, was pardoned by the Emperor for coming on shore without permission. He became the private secre tary of Sin-Song, and he was allowed to retain all the pro perty on board the stranded junk. Vi-Li-Ams-Mit was a tall and strong person. He wore a long pig-tail, which proved the nation to which he belonged was not entirely uncivilized. But instead of being a beau tiful yellow, like the golden-souled inhabitants of Japan, he was a dirty white. This gave great anxiety of mind and un happiness to the Daimio Sin-Song, who called in his physi cian and friend, Ki-Moh-Kai-Mo, to consult him on the point. Ki-Moh-Kai-Mo at once advised that the Daimio's new friend should be japanned a rich yellow. The sugges tion was adopted. Vi-Li-Ams-Mit was placed in the hands of Ma-Ka-Rel-On-Pa-Vin, an artist of repute, who laid a ground of smoky gold over the ugly white skin, and then becoming enamoured of the surface thus presented, enamelled it all over with views and flowers, in forgetfulness of the in tention of the Daimio. He did not recover from this pensive abstraction until it was too late, as Vi-Li-Ams-Mit, having been varnished several times, was polished off with oil. The stranger seemed delighted at his appearance. A rudely traced figure of a woman, marked in blue on the skin of his left arm, had been an additional proof that his people were not utterly sunk in barbarian ignorance and uncivi lization. The only inconvenience he suffered from being japanned was that for three months he could neither stir, stand, sit, lie, eat, or wink, for fear of cracking his varnish. At the end of that period, however, he moved about with comparative ease, grace, and comfort. The Daimio Sin-Song rapidly rose to distinction in the Chamber of Taw-Kee-Tau-Ki, the Parliament of Japan. His speeches were the longest and the least intelligible ever made in that assembly, and he so impressed his brother Daimios, therefore, with a belief in his superior intellect that he rose to be Prime Minister. His eloquence, it should be here noted, was due to the effects of the strong tea which Vi-Li-Ams-Mit carried in his porcelain bottle. It was so potent that it made Sin-Song at times scarcely able to sup port himself on his feet under the weight of deep thought it induced. * It is conjectured hy the learned that this is an early number of the \"Illustrated Nagasaki News,\" which was published weekly on porcelain, in the form of a teacup, richly enamelled with the events of the day. The fragile nature of the material employed would, no doubt, facilitate the delicate operation called \"breaking the news.\" Vi-Li-Ams-Mit was by this time a proficient in the lan guage of Japan. He had been allowed, in consideration of his services against some pirates, whom he defeated single-"], [103, "THE FIRST ENGLISHMAN IN JAPAN. 91 1 handed, to wear two swords, and had been raised to an in ferior Daimio-ship. He was not slow to perceive to what Sin-Song owed his elevation. A noble ambition filled his generous soul \u2014 he desired to supplant the Prime Minister. By stopping all supplies of the Rum-Ti, as he styled his be verage, he deprived Sin-Song of the source of his eloquence. Sin-Song, beginning to be brief and intelligible, sank as rapidly as he had risen ; and Vi-Li-Ams-Mit, who now began to speak in the chamber of Taw-Kee-Tau-Ki, soon eclipsed him. As might be expected, the first office of state was ere long confided to him. Unfortunately, at the very acme of his greatness, Vi-Li- Ams-Mit, was fated to give an example of the instability of human dignity. Having enjoyed for a long time the confi dence of his emperor, he was one day returning from an in terview with his imperial master, when he chanced to meet the empress. Vi-Li-Ams-Mit had been partaking freely of Rum-Ti, and his spirits were in consequence elevated. His proper course, on encountering the empress, would have been to go down on all fours, and rub the back of his head against the pavement until she passed. Instead of this, he gazed at her imperial features, and was overcome by their loveliness. The Empress Pet-Si-Wet-See-Pop was the love liest woman in Japan. Her eyes were exquisitely lozenge shaped, and inclined down towards her nose, with a graceful slope. Her nose was of regal breadth, and of a commanding flatness, while her cheek-bones were of transcendent height. Vi-Li-Ams-Mit received the gift with profound awe and a chastened dehght. He well understood the meaning of this distinguished honour \u2014 which was in so many words that he was to retire from his high office of Prime Minister by a short cut \u2014 or, rather, two cuts across his abdominal region. He was, in fact, to perform a Happy Despatch. With expressions of gratitude and tears of joy he reverently bore the precious gift into his dwelling, where he placed it on a table, and contemplated it for some hours in silence. Towards evening, observing a strange junk out at sea, he thought it his duty, before retiring from his office, to inspect the stranger. Taking with him the imperial sword, in order to be able to perform the Despatch as soon as he had dis patched his business, he stepped into a small boat, and rowed off. ' He was observed to enter the strange junk, the crew of which, it is feared, made him a prisoner, for they bore him away. When last seen, he was standing on the stern of the junk, with the short finger of his right hand despairingly The enamoured Vi-Li-Ams-Mit was carried away by his admiration of beauty and his potations of Rum-Ti. Approach ing the Empress, he flung his arms around her, and imprinted a kiss on her royal lips. This was the first time such a salute as a kiss was intro duced in Japan. Up to that period, affection and friendship alike had expressed their delight by the rubbing of noses. Broad noses have not been so warmly admired since the intro duction of the new custom as they were formerly. The Empress was surprised yet delighted. In her cle mency she determined to conceal Vi-Li-Ams-Mit 's boldness, which, if related to the Emperor, would have signed his death warrant. She took frequent opportunities of encountering the Prime Minister accidentally, and he, finding her Majesty rather liked it, repeated his salute, until the Empress, tho roughly proficient in the new accomplishment, attempted, in a rash moment, to teach her royal husband. The Emperor was a man of acute intelligence. He knew his wife had not sufficient wit to invent this new fashion. A gentle application of bamboo to the soles of her feet over came her well-meaning silence about Vi-Li-Ams-Mit. The Emperor flew into a towering passion, and calling for Da-Shmi-Vig, the executor of imperial commands, he bade him select the most valuable sword in the imperial collection, and carry it, with the Emperor's compliments, to the Prime Minister. placed to the point of his nose, while the other four fingers were sorrowfully extended. This attitude is conjectured by the sages of Japan to be one in use among his people to ex press regret or despair. From that day Vi-Li-Ams-Mit has never been heard of ; but it is a consolation to all true Japanese hearts to remember that the unhappy man had the imperial sword with him, and could, therefore, execute his master's commands, and free himself from slavery at any moment.
