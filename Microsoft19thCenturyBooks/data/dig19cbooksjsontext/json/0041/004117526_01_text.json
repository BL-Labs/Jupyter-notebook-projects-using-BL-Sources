Very dttle is known of the early history of Britain, but it is generady supposed that its inhabitants were Celts. The same customs, the same form of government, the same doctrines and ceremonies of religion prevaded among the Britons as among the Gauls. Their druids or priests, and bards J), were of the same character, and enjoyed similar influence and author ity, and a close connection was maintained between those of the two nations. It is probable that the Phenicians traded to Britain for tin, and other products of the country, in the earliest periods. The ancient Britons appear to have joined agriculture with pasturage, for they kept numerous herds and docks , and yet cultivated a large extent of their lands, especiady in the southern parts of the island. Like all oncivilized people, their manners were rude and wdd. They dwelt in miserable hovels, painted their bodies, clothed themselves in the skins of animals, and were the superstitious slaves of their priests, though enthusiastic ad mirers of personal liberty. Upon a frivolous pretext, the fa mous Koinan commander, Julius Cesar, invaded Britain from Gaul. The Britons defended themselves bravely, with great personal strength; and by means of their war-chariots, winch they managed with astonishing dexterity, very nearly over came even the steadiness of Roman discipline. But, at last , mi litary skdl prevailed over inexperienced valour, and the Ro mans obtained nominal subjection from the Britons; they did not become actually masters of the country till the reign of the emperor Claudius , when Plautius and Ostorius completely vanquished the natives, and the vadant patriotic Caractacus, 1) Ihre Druiden oder Priester, und ihre Barden. A druid is one of the priests and philosophers ancient of the Celtic nations ; a bard , a Celtic minstrel."], [16, "2 rider of several of their united tribes, was carried to Rome, 48. The Romans retained the dominion of Britain untd 410, when Honorius, emperor of the west, renounced ad authority over it. During this period the Britons had made many noble but vain attempts to recover their liberty. Gradually the victors incorporated themselves with the vanquished ; introduced among them the conveniencies of civdized dfe; budt towns and forti fications; constructed roads, and cleared the lands; so that Britain became a considerable province of the Roman empire. When the Romans quitted Britain, its inhabitants were ener vated by luxury, and had lost that spirit of independence which characterized their brave and hardy forefathers. They were unable, therefore, to resist the fierce attacks of thePicts, northern pirates, and of the Scots, who, it is supposed, migra ted from Ireland about that time. The Britons, in despair, in vited to their assistance , the Saxons , a warlike tribe of nor thern Germany. The invitation was eagerly accepted, and a body of those impetuous warriors quickly landed in Britain, 449. The Saxons rescued the Britons from the Picts and Scots, but only to render them slaves to themselves. After various vi cissitudes during the space of 150 years, the heptarchy *) was estabdshed; the remnant of the Britons being driven to the mountains of Wales , and the wdds of Cornwall. The seven kingdoms were Kent, Sussex, Wessex, Essex, Mercia, North umberland, and that of the east Angles. The union of the seven kingdoms was completed under Egbert, 827. During this period, in the year 597, the gospel of Christ was first preached to the Kentish Saxons, by Augustine, a Roman monk, aided by forty associates, and soon spread considerably among the other states. From this era, the regular history ,of Britain properly proceeds, which may be conveniently divided into five epochas. The first epocha extends from the union of the seven kingdoms by Egbert, 828, to the conquest of England by Widiam , duke of Normandy, 1066. The second epocha is reckoned from the Norman conquest 2) to the elevation of the Tudor famdy to the throne in the' person of 1) Die Heptarchie, Siebenherrschaft , a seven-fold government. 2) Von der normannischen Eroberung, von der Eroberung durch die Normannen."], [17, "3 Henry the Seventh. The third epocha reaches from Henry the Seventh to the introduction of the Stuart family, 1603. The fourth epocha comprehends the time which elapsed between the accession of the Stuart line to the Revolution, which trans ferred the crown to William the Third and Mary the Second, 1689. The last epocha may be considered as extending from the Re volution to the complete union of Ireland with England, and the creation of the title of the British empire, 1801. The events presented to view in the first epocha of the English history are neither very interesting nor pleasing. Du ring the former part of it, the country was perpetuady devasta ted by Danes, who', after braving the dangers of the sea in their small vessels, sailed up the rivers, landed suddenly, burnt vdlages and towns, and carried off the cattle and their owners ; and though repeatedly defeated, yet they continued their de structive assaults, almost without intermission. Egbert appears to have been far superior to his countrymen in knowledge and manners. He had spent a considerable time at she court of the dlustrious Charlemagne *), and had enjoyed the advan tages of his example, and of the society of the men of science whom the emperor of the west had assembled around him. Egbert died in 838, and of those kings who ascended the tin-one, successively, between his death and the Norman con quest, scarcely any are worthy to be mentioned, excepting Al fred , Edmund Ironsides 2) , and Harold. Alfred manifested such exemplary virtues, and such abidties so wed directed, as justly entitied him to the appellation [of the Great. With in defatigable activity and undaunted courage, he restrained the ravages 'of the Danes ; he established laws and regulations ; he built castles, and constructed a navy for the defence of his country; he regulated the administration of justice, laid the foundation of the trial by jury 3), estabdshed the division of the kingdom into counties and hundreds, and encouraged arts, sciences, and commerce. He was truly a patriot king. He died in 901. In 1016, Edmund, surnamed Ironsides, on ac count of his hardihood and valour, succeeded to a perdous 1) Karl der Grosse. 2) Eisenseite, der eiserne Arm. 3) Trial by jury, Untersuchung vor einem Schwurgericht. 1*"], [18, "4 throne. The Danes were become powerful in the kingdom, and only the most vigorous and continued efforts could arrest their progress. Edmund struggled nobly, but struggled in vain ; and upon his death, which happened when he had worn the crown only one year, his rival, Canute, the Dane , became master of the su- preme authority, and used it well. Two unworthy sons succeeded him, and the Engdsh then threw oft the Danish yoke, and raised to the throne Edward the Confessor *), a prince of the Saxon dne, 1041. He was the last of the Saxon monarchs. Upon his death, Harold, a son of Earl Godwin, a powerful baron, who had gained possession of nearly the whole author ity of the state, was caded to the throne by the voice of the people, with whom he was justly a favourite. In the mean time, Wildam Duke of Normandy claimed the crown, as having been appointed by Edward to be his successor. He invaded England at the head of a formidable army. Harold, urged by natural valour, and elated by a victory which he had just gained over another invader, Harfager, king of Norway, eagerly flew to meet his rival. A battle was fought between the two rivals, at Hastings, in Sussex, which cost Harold his dfe, and gave the prize to Widiam. The Norman Conquest. Wildam, who was afterwards called the Conqueror, was the natural son of Robert, Duke of Normandy. He owed his greatness not only to his birth, but to his own personal merit. His body was vigorous, his mind capacious and noble, and his courage not to be repressed by apparent danger. His father Robert growing old resolved upon a pilgrimage to Jeru salem, contrary to the advice and opinion of all his nobdity. As his heart was fixed upon the expedition, instead of attend ing to their remonstrances, he shewed them his son William, whom, though idegitimate, he tenderly loved, and recommend ed to their care, exacting an oath from them of homage and fealty. He then put him, as he was yet but ten years of age, under the tutelage of the French king; and soon after 1) Der Bekenner."], [19, "5 going into Asia, whence he never returned , left young Widiam rather the inheritor of his wishes than the crown. In fact, William, from the beginning, found himself exposed to many dangers , and much opposition , from x) his youth and inexpe rience, from the reproach of his birth, from a suspected guar dian, a disputed title, and a distracted state. The regency2) appointed by Robert, were sunder great difficulties in support ing the government against tins application of dangers: and the young prince , when he came of age 3) , found himself re duced to a very low condition. But the great qualities which he soon displayed in the field and the cabinet4) gave encour agement to his friends, and struck a terror into his enemies. He on all sides opposed his rebedious subjects, and repressed foreign invaders, while his valour and conduct prevaded in every action. The tranquillity which he had thus established in his dominions induced him to extend his views ; and some over tures, made him by Edward the Confessor in the latter part of his reign, who was wavering in the choice of a successor, inflamed his ambition with a desn'e of succeeding to the English throne. Whether Edward ready appointed him to succeed , as Widiam ad along pretended, is uncertain; but it is beyond a doubt, that Harold, happening to pay a visit to the Norman coast, was induced by this prince to acknowledge his claims, and to give a promise of seconding them. This promise, however, Harold did not think proper to perform , when it stood in the way to his own ambition; and afterwards, when Wdliam ob jected to the breach, he excused himself, by alleging that it was extorted from him at a time when he had no power to refuse. On whatever side justice might lie, the pretext on Wd liam's part was , that he was appointed heir to the crown of England by Edward the Confessor, upon a visit he had paid that monarch during his dfetime. In consequence of these pre tensions, he was not remiss, after the death of Edward, to lay in his claims; but Harold would admit none of them, resolved to defend by his valour what his intrigues had won. Wildam 1) Durch (in Folge). 2) Die Regentschaft ; a regent is one ruling for another. 3) To be of age miindig sein, to come of age miindig werden. 4) Im Kabinet, im Kabinetsrathe."], [20, "6 finding that arms alone were to be the final deciders of this dispute, prepared to assert his right with vigour. The fame of his intended invasion of England being diffused over the whole continent, multitudes came to offer him their services in this expedition; so that he was embarrassed rather in the choice of whom he should take than in levying his forces. The pope himself was not behind the rest in favouring his pretensions; but, either induenced by the apparent justice of his claims, or by the hopes of extending the authority of the church, he immediately pronounced Harold a usurper. With such favourable incentives, Wdliam soon found himself at the head of a chosen army of60,000men, all equipped in the most war like and splendid manner. It was in the beginning of the summer that he embarked this powerful body on board a fleet of 300 sad: and after some small opposition from the weather, landed at Peversey, on the coast of Sussex, with resolute tranquillity. Harold, who seemed resolved to defend his right to the crown, and retain that sovereignty which he had received from the people, who only had a right to bestow it, was now re turning, flushed with conquest , from defeating the Norwegians, who had invaded the kingdom, with all the forces he had employed in that expedition, and ad he could invite or collect in the country through which he passed. His army was com posed of active and valiant troops, in high spirits, strongly attached to their king, and eager to engage. On the other hand, the army of Widiam consisted of the flower of all the Continent, and had long been inured to danger. The men of Bretagne, Boulogne, Flanders, Poictou, Maine, Orleans, France, and Normandy , were ad voluntarily united under his com mand. England never before, nor ever since, saw two such armies drawn up to dispute its crown. The day before the battle William sent an offer to Harold to decide the quarrel between them by single combat, and thus to spare the blood of thousands. But Harold refused , and said , he would leave it to the God of armies to determine. Both armies, therefore, that night pitched in sight of each other, expecting the dawn ing of the next day with impatience. The Engdsh passed the night in songs and feasting; the Normans in devotion and prayer."], [21, "7 The next morning, at seven, as soon as day appeared, both armies were drawn up in array against each other. Har- rold appeared in the centre of his forces, leading on his army on foot, that his men might be more encouraged, by seeing their king exposed to an equadty of danger. Wildam fought on horseback, leading on his army, that moved at once, singing the song of Roland, one of_the famous chiefs of their country. The Normans began to fight with their cross-bows, which, at first, galled and surprised the English ; and as their ranks were close, their arrows did great execution. But soon they came to closer fight, and the English, with their bdls, hewed down their adversaries with great slaughter. Confusion was spread- ing among the ranks, when Widiam, who found himself on the brink of destruction, hastened with a select band to the re- des of his forces. His presence restored the suspense of battie; he was seen in eveiy place , endeavouring to pierce the ranks of the enemy, and had three horses slain under him. At length, perceiving that the English line continued impenetrable, he pretended to give ground, which, as he expected, drew the enemies from their ranks, and he was instantly ready to take advantage of their desorder. Upon a signal given, the Nor- mans immediately returned to the charge with greater fury than before, broke the English troops, and pursued them to a rising ground. It was in this extremity, that Harold was seen flying from rank to rank, rallying and inspiring his troops with vigour; and though he had toded ad day till near night- fall, in the front of his Kentish men, yet he still seemed una- bated in force or courage, keeping his men to the post of hon- our. Once more, therefore, the victory seemed to turn against the Normans, and they fed in great numbers, so that the fier- ceness and obstinacy of this memorable battle was often re- newed by the courage of the leaders, whenever that of the soldiers began to slacken. Fortune at length determined a victory that valour was unable to decide. Harold, making a furious onset at the head of his troops against the Norman heavy-armed infantry, was shot into the brains by an arrow; and his two valiant brothers, fighting by his side, shared the same fate. He fell with his sword in his hand, amidst heaps"], [22, "8 of slain; and, after the battle, the royal corpse could hardly be distinguished among the dead. This was the end of the Saxon monarchy in England, which had continued for more than six hundred years. As soon as Widiam passed the Thames, at Wadingford, Stigand, the primate *), made submission to him in the name of the clergy; and, before he came within sight of the city, ad the chief nobility came into his camp, and declared an in tention of yielding to his authority. William was glad of being peaceably put in possession of a throne which several of his predecessors had not gained without repeated victories. But, in order to give his invasion all the sanction possible, he was crowned at Westminster, by the archbishop of York, and took the oath usual in the times of the Saxon and Danish kings; which was, to protect and defend the church, to ob serve the laws of the realm, and to govern the people with impartiality. Having thus secured the government, and, by a mixture of rigour and lenity, brought the English to an entire submission, he resolved to return to the Continent, there to enjoy the triumph and congratulation of his ancient subjects. In the mean time, the absence of the Conqueror in Eng land produced the most fatal effects. His officers, being no longer controlled by his justice, thought this a fit opportunity for extortion; whde the English, no longer awed by his pre sence, thought it the happiest occasion, for vindicating their freedom. The English had entered into a conspn-acy to cut off their invaders, and fixed the day for their intended massacre, which was to be on Ash- Wednesday 2), during the time of divine ser vice, when all the Normans would be unarmed as penitents, according to the discipline 3) of the times. But Widiam's re turn quickly disconcerted all their schemes. And, from that time forward, he' began to lose ad confidence in his Engdsh sub jects, and to regard them as inveterate and irreconcileable ene mies. He had already- raised such a number of fortresses in 1) Der Prirnas, the ecclesiastical chief. 2) Aschermittwoch , the first day of Lent, so called from the an cient custom of sprinkling ashes on the head. 3) Kirchenzucht."], [23, "9 the kingdom, that he no longer dreaded the tumultuous or transient efforts of a discontented multitude; he therefore de- termined to treat them as a conquered nation, to indulge his own avarice, and that of his followers, by numerous confis- cations, and to secure his power, by humbling all who were able to make any resistance. He proceeded to confiscate all the estates of the English gentry1), and to grant them liberally to his Norman followers. Thus ad the ancient and honourable families were reduced to beggary, and the English found them- selves entirely excluded from every road that led either to honour or preferment. The feudal law 2) had been before in- troduced into England by the Saxons; but this monarch re- formed it according to the model of that practised in his na- tive dominions. He divided all the lands of England, except the royal demesne3), into baronies, and conferred those, upon certain military conditions, on the most considerable of his fol- lowers. These had a power of sharing their grants to in- ferior tenants, who were denominated knights or vassals, and who paid their lord the same duty that he paid the sovereign. To the first class of these baronies the English were not ad- mitted ; and the few who were permitted still to retain their landed property, were content to be received in the second. The barons exercised all kinds of jurisdiction within their own manners, and held courts in which they administered jus- tice to their own vassals. This law extended not only to the laity, but also to the bishops and clergy. They had usurped a power, during the Saxon succession, of being governed within themselves ; but Widiam restrained them to the exercise of their ecclesiastical power only, and submitted them to a similitude of duties with the rest of their fellow-subjects. This they at first regarded as a grievous imposition; but the king's author ity was established by a power that neither the clergy nor the pope could intimidate. But, to keep the clergy, as much 1) The gentry is the class of people between the vulgar and the nobility. 2) Das Lehnsgesetz. 3) Demesne (or demain) Domane, that land which a man holds originally of himself, opposed to feodum or fee, which signifies lands hold of a superior lord; then, estate in land generally, Grundeigenthum"], [24, "10 as possible, in his interests, he appointed none but his own countrymen to the most considerable church dignities, and even displaced Stigand, archbishop of Canterbury, upon some frivo lous pretences. The Sons of William. William, having crushed different conspiracies, and, by punishing the malcontents, thus secured the peace of his do minions, now expected rest from his labours ; and, finding none either widing or powerful enough to oppose him, he hoped that the end of his reign would be marked with prosperity and peace. But such is the blindness of human hope, that he found enemies where he least expected them; and such, too, as served to embitter all the latter part of his life. His last troubles were excited by his own children, from the opposing of whom he could expect to reap neither glory nor gain. He had three sons, Robert, Widiam, and Henry, besides several daughters. Robert, his eldest son, surnamed Curthose, from the shortness of his legs, was a prince who inherited ad the bravery of his family and nation, but was rather bold than prudent; and was often heard to express his jealousy of his two brothers, William and Henry. These, by greater assiduity, had wrought upon the credudty and affections of the king, and consequently were the more obnoxious to Robert. A mind, therefore, so wed prepared for resentment, soon found or made a cause for an open rupture. The princes were one clay in sport together, and, in the idle petulance of play, took it into their heads to throw water over their elder brother as he passed through the court, on leaving their apartment. Robert, all adve to1) suspicion, quickly turned this frolic into a studied indig nity; and having these jealousies still farther inflamed2) by one of his favourites, he drew his sword, and ran up stairs with intent to take revenge. The whole castle was quickly filled with tumult, and it was not without some difficulty that the king himself was able to appease it. But he could not aday the animosity which, from that moment, ever after pre- 1) Sehr empfanglich fur \u2014 2) Da dieser Argwohn noch mehr entziindet wurde."], [25, "11 vailed in his family. Robert, attended by several of his confe derates, withdrew to Rouen that very night, hoping to surprise the castle; but his design was defeated by the governor. The flame being thus kindled, the popular character of the prince, and a sympathy of manners, engaged ad the young no bdity of Normandy and Maine, as well as of Anjou and Britany, to espouse his quarrel: even his mother, it is said, supported him by secret remittances x), and aided him in this obstinate re sistance by private encouragement. This unnaturel contest continued for several years to inflame the Norman state, and Wdliam was at last obliged to have recourse to England for supporting his authority against his son. Accordingly, draw ing an army of English together, he led them over to Nor mandy, where he soon compelled Robert and his adherents to quit the field, and he was quickly reinstated in ad his dominions. Widiam had scarcely put an end to his transaction, when he felt a very severe blow in the death of Matilda, his queen ; and, as misfortunes generally come together, he received in formation of a general insurrection in Maine, the nobility of which had always been adverse to the Norman government. Upon his arrival on the Continent, he found that the insur gents had been secretly assisted and excited by the king of France, whose policy consisted in thus lessening the Norman power, by creating dissensions among the nobles of its differ ent provinces. William's displeasure was not a little increased by the account he received of some radleries which that mo narch had thrown out against him. He levied a strong army, and entering the Isle of France, destroyed and buried all the vdlages and houses without op position, and took the town of Mante, which he reduced to ashes. But the progress of these hostidties was stopped by an accident, which shortly after put an end to William's life. His horse chancing to place his fore-foot on some hot ashes, plunged so violently, that the rider was thrown forward, and bruised upon the pummel of the saddle to such a degree, that he suffered a relapse, of which he died shortly after, at a little vidage near Rouen. 1) Gelds endungen."], [26, "12 William Rufus. William, surnanied Rufus from the colour of his hair, hast ened to take measures for securing himself on the throne. Arriving, therefore, before the news of Widiam's death had yet reached England, his first care was to take possession of the treasures left by the king of Winchester. He then addressed the archbishop Lanfranc , who instantly proceeded to the cer emony of coronation. At the same time Robert, who had been appointed successor to Normandy, took peaceable possession of that government. Nevertheless the Norman barons were, from the beginning, displeased at the division of the empire by the late king; they eagerly desired an union as before, looked upon Robert as the proper owner of the whole. A powerful conspiracy was therefore carried on against Widiam ; and Odo, the late king's brother, undertook to conduct it to maturity. William, sensible of the danger that threatened him, endeav oured to gain the affections of the native English, whom he prevailed upon, by promises of future good treatment, and preference in the distribution of his favours, to espouse his interests. He was soon, therefore, in the field; and, at the head of a numerous army , showed himself in readiness to op pose all who should dispute his pretensions. In the mean time, Robert, instead of employing his money in levies, to sup port his friends in England, squandered it away in idle expen ses, and unmerited benefits, so that he procrastinated his de parture till the opportunity was lost; while William exerted himself with incredible activity to dissipate the confederacy before his brother could arrive. Nor was this difficult to effect: the conspn-ators had, in consequence of Robert's assurances, taken possession of some fortresses; but the appearance of the king soon induced them to implore his mercy. He granted them their dves, but confiscated ad their estates, and banished them from the kingdom. A new breach was made some time after between the brothers, in which Rufus found means to encroach stdl farther upon Robert's possessions. Every conspiracy thus detected, served to enrich the king, who took care to apply to his own"], [27, "13 use those treasures which had been amassed for the purpose of dethroning him. But the memory of these transient broils and unsuccess ful treasons was now totally eclipsed by one of the most noted enterprises that ever adorned the annals of nations, or excited the attention of mankind: I mean the Crusades1), which were now first projected. Peter the Hermit, a native of Amiens in Picardy, was a man of great zeal, courage, and piety. He had made a pilgrimage to the holy sepulchre at Jerusalem, and beheld, with indignation, the cruel manner in which the Chris tians were treated by the Infidels, who were in possession of that place. He preached the Crusade over Europe by the pope's permission; and men of all ranks flew to arm with the utmost alacrity , to rescue the Holy Land from the Infidels ; and each bore the sign of the cross upon his right shoulder, as a mark of his devotion to the cause. In the midst of this universal ardour, that was diffused over Europe, men were not entirely forgetful of their temporal interests; for some, hoping for a more magnificent settlement in the soft regions of Asia, sold their European property for whatever they could ob tain, contented with receiving any thing for what they were predetermined to relinquish. Among the princes who felt and aknowledged this general spirit of enterprise, was Robert Duke of Normandy. The Crusade was entirely adapted to his incli nations and his circumstances ; he was brave, zealous, covetous of glory, poor, harassed by insurrections, and, what was more than all, naturally fond of change. In order, therefore, to supply money to defray the necessary charges of so expensive an undertaking, he offered to mortgage 2) his dukedom in Nor mandy to his brother Rufus, for a stipulated sum of money. This sum, which was no greater than thirty thousand marks 3), was readily promised by Rufus, whose ambition was upon the watch to seize every advantage. But though the cession of Maine and Normandy greatly increased the king's territories, they added but dttle to his real 1) Kreuzziige. 2) Hypothek (Unterpfand). 3) About sixty thousand pounds of English money."], [28, "14 power, as his new subjects were composed of men of indepen dant spirits, more ready to dispute than to obey his commands. Many were the revolts and insurrections which he obdged to quell in person; and, no sooner was one conspiracy sup pressed, than another rose to give him fresh disquietude. However, Rufus proceeded, careless of approbation or cen sure; and only intent upon extending his dominions, either by purchase or conquest. The earl of Poictiers and Guienne, inflamed with a desire of going upon the Crusade, had gathered an immense multitude for that expedition, but wanted money to forward his preparations. He had recourse, therefore, to Rufus , and offered to mortgage all his dominions , without much considering what would become of his unhappy subjects that he thus disposed of. The king accepted this offer with his usual avidity, and had prepared a fleet and an army, in order to take possession of the rich provinces thus consigned to his trust. But an accident put an end to all his ambitious projects ; he was shot by an arrow that Sir Walter Tyrrel discharged at a deer in the New Forest, which glancing from a tree, struck the king to the heart. He dropt dead instan taneously ; whde the innocent author of his death , terrified at the accident, put spurs to his horse, hastened to the sea-shore, embarked for France, and joined the Crusade that was then setting out for Jerusalem. William's body being found by some countrymen passing through the forest, was carried to Win chester, where it was next day interred in the cathedral, without ceremony, or any marks of respect. Henry, the late king's younger brother who had been hunting in the New Forest when Rufus was slain, took the earliest advantage of the occasion, and hastening to Winchester, resolved to secure the royal treasure, which he knew to be the best assistant in seconding his aims. The barons, as wed' as the people, acquiesced in a claim which they were unprepared to resist, and yielded obedience, from the fears of immediate danger. Henry, to ingratiate himself with the people, expeded from court ad the ministers of his brother's debauchery and arbi trary power. But what gave him the greatest share of popu larity was his recading Anselm, archbishop of Canterbury, who had been banished during the last reign. One thing only re-"], [29, "15 mainet do confirm his claims without danger of a rival. The English remembered their Saxon monarchs with gratitude, and beheld them excluded the throne with regret. There still remained some of the descendants of that favourite line ; and, among others, Matdda, the niece of Edgar Atheling; which lady , having declined all pretensions of royalty , was bred up in a convent, and had actuady taken the veil. Upon her Henry first fixed his eyes as a proper consort, by whose means the long breach between the Saxon and Norman interests would be finally united. It only remained to get over the scruple of her being a nun; but this a councd, devoted to his interests, readdy admitted ; and Matdda being pronounced free to marry, the nuptials were celebrated with great pomp and solemnity. It was at this unfavourable juncture that Robert returned from abroad, and, after taking possession of his native domin ions , laid his clahn to the crown of England. But proposals for an accommodation being made, it was stipulated, that Ro bert, upon the payment of a certain sum, should resign his pretensions to England; and that if either of the princes died without issue, the other should succeed to his dominions. This treaty being ratified, the armies on each side were disbanded; and Robert, having lived two months in the utmost harmony with his brother, returned in peace to his own dominions. But Robert's indiscretion soon rendered him unfit to gov ern any state; he was totally averse to business, and only studious of the more splendid amusements or employments of life. His servants pidaged him without compunction; and he is described as lying whole days abed for want of clothes, of which they had robbed him. His subjects were treated stid more deplorably ; for being under the command of petty and rapacious tyrants, who plundered them without mercy, the whole country was become a scene of violence and depredation. It was in this miserable exigence , that the Normans at length had recourse to Henry, from whose wise administration of his own dominions they expected a similitude of prosperity, should he take the reins of theirs. Henry very readdy promised to redress their grievances, as he knew it would be the direct method to second his own ambition. The year ensuing, there fore, he landed in Normandy with a strong arm, took some of"], [30, "16 the principal towns, and a battle ensuing, Robert's forces were totally overthrown, and he himself taken prisoner, with near ten thousand of his men, and all the considerable barons who had adhered to his misfortunes. This victory was fodowed by the final reduction of Normandy; while Hem-y returned in triumph to England, leading with him his captive brother, who, after a dfe of bravery, generosity, and truth, now found him self not only deprived of his patrimony and his friends, but also his freedom. Henry, unmindful of his brother's former magnanimity with regard to him, detained him a prisoner dur ing the remainder of his life, which was no less than twenty eight years; and he died in the castle of Cardiff, in Glamor ganshire. It is even said by some, that he was deprived of his sight by a red-hot copper basin appded to his eyes; whde his brother attempted to stide the reproaches of his conscience, by founding the abbey of Reading, an act which was then considered as a sufficient atonement for every degree of bar barity. Fortune now seemed to smile upon Henry, and promise a long succession of felicity. He was in peaceable possession of two powerfid states, and had a son, who was acknowledged undisputed heir, arrived at his eighteenth year, whom he loved most tenderly. His daughter Matdda was also married to the emperor Henry V. of Germany , and she had been sent to that court, whde yet but eight years old, for her education. Ad his prospects, however, were at once clouded by unforeseen mis fortunes and accidents, which tinctured his remaining years with misery. The king from the faedity with which he usurp ed the crown, dreading that his family might be subverted with the same ease, took care to have his son recognized as his successor by the states of England, and carried him over to Normandy to receive the homage of the barons of that duchy. After performing this requisite ceremony, Hem-y, re turning triumphantly to England brought with him a nume rous retinue of the chief nobdity, who seemed to share in his successes. In one of the vessels of the fleet, his son and sev eral young noblemen, the companions of his pleasures, went together, to render the passage more agreeable. The king set sad from Barfleur, and was soon carried by a fair wind out"], [31, "17 of sight of land. The prince was detained by some accident ; and his sailors, as wed as their captain, Fitz-Stephen, having spent the interval in drinking, became so disordered, that they ran the ship upon a rock, and immediately it was dashed to pieces. The prince was put into the boat, and might have escaped , had he not been caded back by the cries of Maude, his natural sister. He was at first conveyed out of danger himself, but could not leave a person so dear to perish without an effort to save her. He therefore prevailed upon the sailors to row back and take her in. The approach of the boat giv ing several others who had been left upon the wreck the hopes of saving their lives, numbers leaped in, and the whole went to the bottom. Above a hundred and fourty young noblemen, of the principal famdies of England and Normandy, were lost on this occasion. A butcher of Rouen was the only person on board who escaped; he clung to the mast, and was taken up the next morning by some fishermen. Fitz-Stephen, the captain, while the butcher was thus buffeting the waves for his dfe, swam up to him, and enquired if the prince was yet living; when being told that he had perished, \u201eThen I will not outlive him,\" 'said the captain, and immediately sunk to the bottom. The shrieks of these unfortunate people were heard from the shore, and the noise even reached the king's ship, but the cause was then unknown. Henry entertained hopes, for three days, that his son had put into some distant port in England; but when certain intedigence of the calamity was brought to him, he fainted away, and was never seen to smile from that moment to the day of his death. The rest of this prince's life seems a mere blame ; his rest less desires having now nothing left worth toding for, he ap peared more fond of repose than ambition. His daughter Ma tilda, however, becoming a widow by the death of the em peror, he married hera second time to Geoffrey Plantagenet,\" eld est son of the count of Anjou, and endeavoured to ensure her succession by obliging his barons to recognise her as the heir of ad his dominions. Some time after, that princess having been delivered of a son, who received the name of Henry, the king caused all the nobility of England and Normandy to re new their oaths of allegiance. His death then followed soon, 2"], [32, "18 at St. Denis, a dttle town in Normandy, from eating too plen tifully of lampreys, a dish he was particularly fond of. He died in the sixty- seventh year of Ids age, and the thirty -fifth of his reign. The Accession of the Blantagenets. No sooner was the king known to be dead, than Stephen son of Adela, the king's sister, and count of Blois, conscious of his own power and influence, resolved to secure to himself the possession of what he so long had desired. He speedily hastened from Normandy, and arriving in London, was imme diately saluted king by ad the lower ranks of people. Being thus secure of the people, his next step was to gain over the clergy; and, for that purpose, his brother, the bishop of Win chester, exerted ad his influence among them with good suc cess. Thus was Stephen made king by one of those speedy revolutions which ever mark the barbarity of a state in which they are customary. The first acts of a usurper are always popular. Stephen, in order to secure his tottering throne, passed a charter1), granting several privileges to the different orders of the state. To the nobility, a permission to hunt in their own forests; to the clergy, a speedy filling of ad vacant benefices2); and to the people, a restoration of the laws of Edward the Confessor. To fix himself stid more securely, he took possession of the royal treasures at Winchester, and had his title ratified by the pope with part of the money. It was not long however, that Matilda delayed asserting her claim to the crown. She landed upon the coast of Sussex, assisted by Robert, earl of Gloucester, natural son of the late king. The whole of Matdda's retinue, upon this occasion, amounted to no more than one hundred and forty knights, who immediately took possession of Arundel castle ; but the nature of her claim soon increased the number of her partisans , and her forces every day seemed to gain ground upon those of 1) Urkunde ; a charter is a paper bestowing or confirming privileges. 2) Pfriinden."], [33, "19 her antagonist. Meantime, Stephen, being assured of her arri val, dew to besiege Arundel castle, where she had taken re fuge, and where she was protected by the queen dowager1) who secretly favoured her pretensions. This fortress was too feeble to promise a long defence; and would have been soon taken had it not been represented to the king, that, as it was a castle belonging to the queen dowager, it would be an in fringement on the respect due to her to attempt taking it by force. There was a spn-it of generosity mixed with the rude ness of the times, that unaccountably prevailed in many trans actions. Stephen permitted to Matdda to come forth in safety, and had her conveyed2) with security to Bristol, another fortress equally strong with that from whence he permitted her to re tire. It would be tedious to relate the various skirmishes on either side, in pursuance of their respective pretensions ; it will suffice to say, that Matilda's forces increased every day, while her antagonist seemed every hour to become weaker; and a victory gained by the queen, threw Stephen from the throne, and exalted Matilda in his room. She was crowned at Win chester with all imaginable solemnity. Matilda, however, was unfit for government. She affected to treat the nobility with a degree of disdain, to which they had long been unaccustomed; so that the fickle nation once more began to pity their deposed king, and repent the steps they had taken in her favour. The bishop of Winchester was not remiss in fomenting these discontents ; and when he found the people ripe for a tumult, detached a party of Ids friends and vassals to block up the city of London, where the queen then resided. At the same time, measures were taken to insti gate the Londoners to a revolt, and to seize her person. Ma tilda, having timely notice of this conspiracy, fled to Win chester, whither the bishop, still her secret enemy, followed her, watching an opportunity to ruin her cause. His party was soon sufficiently strong to bid the queen open defiance, and to besiege her in the very place where she first received his be nediction. There she continued for some time, but the town 1) The queen dowager die verwittwete Kb'nigin. 2) Liess sie bringen. 5*"], [34, "20 being pressed by a famine, she was obliged to escape; while her brother, the earl of Gloucester, endeavouring to follow, was taken prisoner, and exchanged for Stephen, who still continued a captive. Thus a sudden revolution once more took place: Matilda was deposed, and obliged to seek for safety in Ox ford. Stephen was again recognized as king, and taken from the dungeon to be replaced on his throne. But he was now to enter the lists with a new opponent, who was every day coming to maturity, and growing more formidable: this was Henry, the son of Matilda, who had now reached his sixteenth year; and gave the greatest hopes of being one day a valiant leader, and a consummate podtician. With the wishes of the people in his favour, young Henry was resolved to reclaim his hereditary kingdom, and to dispute once more Stephen's usurped pretensions, and accordingly made an invasion of England, where he was immediately joined by almost all the barons of the kingdom. In the mean time, Stephen, alarmed at the power and po pularity of his young rival, tried every method to anticipate the purpose of his invasion ; but finding it impossible to turn the torrent, he was obliged to have recourse to treaty. It was therefore agreed', by ad parties, that Stephen should reign du ring his life; and that justice should be administered in his name. That Henry should, on Stephen's death, succeed to the kingdom; and Wddam, Stephen's son, should inherit Boulogne and his patrimonial estate. After ad the barons had sworn to his treaty, which filled the whole kingdom with joy, Henry evacuated England; and Stephen returned to the peaceable enjoyment of his throne. His reign, however, was closed about a year after the treaty. He died at Canterbury, and was in terred in the abbey of Feversham. The first act of Henry's government gave the people a happy omen of his future wise administration. Conscious of his power, he began to correct those abuses, and to resume those privileges, which had been extorted from the weakness or the credulity of his predecessors. He immediately dismissed all those mercenary soldiers who' committed infinite disorders in the nation. He resumed many of those benefactions which had been made to churches and monasteries in the former"], [35, "21 reigns. He gave charters to several towns, by which the citi zens claimed their freedom and privileges, independant of any superior but himself. These charters were the groundwork of English liberty. The struggles which had before this tune been whether the king, or the barons, or the clergy, should be despotic over the people, now began to assume a new aspect: and a fourth order, namely, that of the more opulent of the people, began to claim a share of administration. Thus was the feudal government at first impaired; and liberty began to be more equally diffused throughout the nation. Henry being thus become the most powerful prince of his age, the undisputed monarch of England, possessed of more than a third of France, and having humbled the barons that would circumscribe his power, might naturady be expected to reign with very little opposition for the future. But it happened otherwise. He found the severest mortifications from the quarter where he least expected resistance. Thomas Becket. The famous Thomas Becket, the first man of English ex traction who had, since the Norman conquest, risen to any share of power, was the son of a citizen of London. Having received his early education in the schools of that metropolis, he resided some time at Paris; and, on his return, became clerk in the sheriff's office x). From that humble station, he rose through the gradations of office, until at last he was made archbishop of Canterbury, a dignity second only to that of the king. No sooner was he fixed in this high station, which ren dered him for life the second person in the kingdom, than he endeavoured to retrieve the character of sanctity, which his former levities might have appeared to oppose. He was in his person the most mortified man that coidd be seeing He wore sackcloth next his skin. He changed it so seldom, that it was fided with dirt and vermin. His usual diet was bread, 1) A sheriff is the first officer of a county (shire), the reeve of a shire to whom within its circuit the execution of the laws is intrusted."], [36, "22 his drink water; which he rendered further unpalateable, by the mixture of unsavoury herbs. His bak was mangled with frequent discipline1). He every day washed on his knees the feet of thirteen beggars. Thus pretending to sanctity, he set up for being a defender 2) of the privdeges of the clergy, which had for a long time been enormous, and which it was Henry's aim to abridge. An opportunity soon offered, that gave him a popular pre text for beginning his intended reformation. A man in holy orders 3) had debauched the daughter of a gentleman in Wor cestershire ; and then murdered the father, to prevent the effects of his resentment. The atrociousness of the crime produced a spirit of indignation among the people ; and the king insisted that the assassin should be tried4) by the civd magistrate5). This Becket opposed, alleging the privileges of the church. In order to determine this matter the king summoned a general council of the nobility at prelates at Clarendon, to whom he submitted this great and important affair, and desired their concurrence. These councds seemed at that time convened rather to give authority to the king's decrees, than to enact laws that were to bind their posterity. A number of regu lations were there drawn up, which were afterwards well known under the title of the Constitutions of Clarendon, and were then voted without opposition. By these regulations it was enacted, that clergymen accused of any crime should be tried in the civil courts; that laymen should not be tried in the spiritual courts, except by legal or reputable witnesses. These, with some others of less consequence , or impded in the above , to the number of sixteen, were readdy subscribed to by all the bishops present; Becket himself, who at first shewed some re luctance, added his name to the number. But Alexander, who was at that time pope, condemned them in the strongest terms, abrogated , annulled , and rejected them.

In the midst of his dis pute, Becket, with an intrepidity peculiar to himself, arraying himself in his episcopal vestments, and with the cross in his hand, went forward to the king's palace, and entering- the royal apartments, sat down, holding up the cross as his banner of protection. There he put himself, in the most solemn manner, under the protection of the supreme pontiff; and upon receiv ing a refusal to leave the kingdom, he secretly withdrew in disguise, and at last found means to cross over to the Con tinent. \u2022 The intrepidity of Becket, joined to his apparent sanctity, gained him a very favourable reception upon the Continent, both from the people and their governors. The' pope and he were hot remiss to retort their fulmi nations, and to shake the very foundation of the king's author ity. Becket compared himself to Christ, who had been con demned by a lay tribunal, and who was crucified anew in the present oppressions under which the church laboured. But he did not rest in complaints only. He issued out a censure, ex communicating the king's chief ministers by name, all that were concerned in sequestrating J) the revenues of his see, and all who obeyed or favoured the Constitutions of Clarendon. Frequent attempts, indeed, were made towards an accom modation; but the mutual jealousies, that each bore to the other, and their anxiety not to lose the least advantage in the negotiation', often protracted this desirable treaty. At length, however, the mutual aim of both made a re concidation necessary but nothing could exceed the insolence with which Becket conducted himself upon first landing in England. Instead of retiring quietly to his diocese, with that modesty which became a man just pardoned by his king, he made a progress through Kent, in all the splendour and magni ficence of a sovereign pontiff. As he approached Southwark, the clergy, the laity, men of ad ranks and ages, came forth 1) To sequester, to sequestrate sequestriren , in Beschlag nehmen (ein streitiges Gut einem Dritten zur Verwaltung iibergeben)."], [38, "24 to meet him, and celebrated his triumphal entry with hymns of joy. Thus confident of the voice and the hearts of the people, he began to launch forth his thunders against those who had been his former opponents. The archbishop of York, who had crowned Henry's eldest son in his absence, was the first against whom he denounced sentence of suspension J). The bishops of london and Salisbury he actuady excommunicated. One man he excommunicated' for having spoken against him; and another for having cut off the tail of one of his horses. Henry was then in Normandy, while the primate was thus triumphantly parading through the kingdom; and it was not without the utmost indignation that he received information of his turbulent insolence. When the suspended and excommunicated prelates arrived with their complaints, his anger knew no bounds. He broke forth into the most acrimonious expressions against that arrogant churchman, whom he had raised from the lowest station to be the plague of his life, and the contin ual disturber of his government. The archbishop of York remarked to him , that so long as Becked lived, he could never expectj'to enjoy peace or tranquillity ; and the king himself burst out into an exclamation, that he had no friends about him, or he would, not so long have been exposed to the insults of that ungrateful hypocrite. These words excited the attention of the whole court, and armed four of his most resolute attendants, to gratify their monarch's secret inclinations. The conspirators, being joined by some assistants at the place of their meeting, proceeded to Canterbury with all that haste their bloody in tentions required. Advancing directly to Becket's house, and entering his apartment, they reproached him very fiercely for the rashness and insolence of his conduct. During their alter cation , the time approached for Becket to assist at vespers 2), whither he went unguarded, the conspirators following, and preparing for them attempt. As soon as he reached the altar, where it is just to think he aspired at the glory of martyr dom, they ad fell upon him, and having cloven his head with 1) Gegen den er das Urtheil der Amtsentsetzung aussprach. 2) Vesper, Abendstern, Abend; vespers die Vesper, der Abend gottesdienst."], [39, "25 repeated blows, he dropt down dead before the altar of St. Be nedict, which was besmeared with his blood and brains. Nothing could exceed the king's consternation upon receiv ing the first news of this prelate's catastrophe. He was in stantly sensible that the murder would be ultimately imputed to him; and at length, in order to divert the minds of the people to a different object, he undertook an expedition against Ireland. The Conquest of Ireland. Ireland was at that time in pretty much the same situation that England had been after the first invasion of the Saxons. They had been early converted to Christianity; and for three or four centuries after, possessed a very large proportion of the learning of the times. Being undisturbed by foreign in vasions, and perhaps too poor to invite the rapacity of con querors, they enjoyed a peaceful life, which they gave up to piety, and such learning as was then thought necessary to promote it. Of their learning, their arts, their piety, and even their polished manners, too many monuments remain to this day for us to make the least doubt concerning them: but it is equally true, that in time they fell from these advantages; and their degenerate posterity, at the period we are now speak ing of, were wrapped in the darkest barbarity. At the time when Henry first planned the invasion of the island, it was divided into five principalities; namely, Leinster, Meath, Minister, Ulster, and Connaught; each governed by its respective monarch. As it had been usual for one or other of those to take the lead in their wars, ;he was denominated sole monarch of the kingdom, and possessed of a power re sembdng that of the early Saxon monarchs of England. Roderic O'Connor, king of Connaught, was then advanced to this dig nity, and Dermot M'Morrogh was king of Leinster. This last named prince, a weak, licentious tyrant, had carried off and ravished the daughter of the king of Meath, who, being strength ened by the alliance of the king of Connaught, invaded the ravisher's dominions, and expeded him from his kingdom. The prince, thus justly punished, had recourse to Henry, who was"], [40, "26 at that time in Guienne; and offered to hold1) his kingdom of the English crown, in case he recovered it by the king's assis tance. Henry readily accepted the offer1; but being at that time embarrassed by more near interests, he only gave Dermot letters patent2), by which he empowered ad his subjects to aid the L'ish prince in the recovery of his dominions. Der mot, relying on this authority, returned to Bristol, where, after some difficulty, he formed a treaty with Richard, surnamed Strongbow, earl of Pembroke, who agreed to reinstate him in his dominions, upon condition of his being married to his daughter Eva, and declared heir of all his territory. Being thus assured of assistance, he returned privately to Ireland, and concealed himself during the winter in the monastery of Ferns, which he had founded. Robert Fitz-Stephens was the first knight who was able, the ensuing spring, to fulfil his engage ments, by landing with a hundred and thirty knights, sixty esquires 3), and three hundred archers. They were soon after joined by Maurice Pendergast, who, about the same time, brought over ten knights, and sixty archers; and with this smad body of forces they resolved on besieging Wexford, which was to be theirs by treaty. This town was quickly reduced; and the adventurers being reinforced by another body of men, to the amount of a hundred and fifty, under the command of Maurice Fitzgerald, composed an army that struck the bar barous natives with awe. Roderic, the chief monarch of the island, ventured to oppose them, but he was defeated; and soon after the prince of Ossory was obliged to submit, and give hostages for his future conduct. Dermot being thus reinstated in his hereditary dominions, soon began to conceive hopes of extending the limits of his power, and making himself master of Ireland. With these views, he endeavoured to expedite Strongbow ; who, being per sonally prohibited by the king, was not yet come over. Der mot tried to indame his ambition by the glory of the conquest, and his avarice by the advantages it would procure. He ex patiated on the cowardice of the natives , and the certainty of 1) Zu Lehn tragen. 2) Einen ofihen Brief, ein Diplom. 3) Knappen."], [41, "27 his success. Strongbow first sent over Raymond, one of his retinue , with ten knights and seventy archers ; and receiving permission shortly after for himself, he landed with two hun dred horse, and a hundred archers. All these English forces now joining together, became irresistible ; and though the whole number did not amount to a thousand, yet such was the bar barous state of the natives , that they were everywhere put to the rout. The city of Waterford quickly surrendered; Dublin was taken by assault ; and Strongbow soon after marrying Eva, according to treaty, became master of the kingdom of Leinster upon Dermot's decease. The island being thus in a manner wholly subdued, for nothing was capable of opposing the further progress of the English arms , Henry became willing to share in person those honours, which the adventures had already secured. He, there fore, shortly after landed in Ireland, at the head of five hun dred knights and some soldiers ; not so much to conquer a dis puted territory , as to- take possession of a kingdom. Thus, after a trifling effort, in which very little money was expended, and little blood shed, that beautiful island became an append age to the English crown, and as such it has ever since con tinued, with unshaken fidelity. Fair Rosamond. The joy which this conquest diffused was very great; but troubles of a domestic nature served to render the remaining part of Henry's life a scene of turbulence and disquietude. Queen Eleanor, whom he had married for motives of am bition, and who had been divorced from her former royal consort, had long become disagreeable to Henry; and he had fallen in love with Rosamond Clifford , better known by the name of Fair Rosamond, whose personal charms and whose death make so conspicious a figure in the romances and the ballads of the times. She is said to have been the most beau tiful woman that was ever seen in England, and Henry loved her with a long and faithful attachment. In order to secure her from the resentment of his queen, he concealed her in a labyrinth in Woodstockpark, where he"], [42, "28 passed in her company his hours of vacancy and pleasure. How long this secret intercourse continued is not told us; but it was not so closely concealed but that x) it came to the queen's knowledge, who, as the accoimts add, being guided by a clue of sdk to her fair rival's retreat, obliged her, by holding a drawn dagger to her breast, to swallow poison. Whatever may be the veracity of this story, certain it is, that this haughty woman, though formerly offensive by her own gadantries, was now no less so by her jealousy; and she it was who first sowed the seeds of his dissension between the king and his children. Young Henry , the king's eldest son, was taught to bedeve himself injured', when, upon being crowned as partner in the kingdom, he was not admitted into a share of the adminis tration. His discontents were shared by his brothers Geoffrey and Richard, whom the queen persuaded to assert their title to the territories assigned them. Queen Eleanor herself was me ditating an escape to the court of France, whither her sons had retired, and put on man's apparel for that purpose, when she was seized by the king's order, and put into confinement. Thus Henry saw ad his long perspective of future happiness totally clouded; his sons, scarce yet arrived at manhood, eager to share the spods of their father's possessions; his queen, warmly encouraging those undutiful princes in their rebedion; and many potentates of Europe not ashamed to lend them assistance to support their pretensions. It was not long before the young princes had sufficient in duence upon the Continent to raise a powerful confederacy in their favour. Henry, therefore, apprehensive that a part of his troubles arose from the displeasure of Heaven, resolved to do penance at the shrine of St. Thomas of Canterbury, for that was the name given to Becket upon his canonization. As soon as he came within sight of the church of Canterbury, adghting from his horse he wadced barefoot towards the town, and prostrated himself before the shrine of the saint. Next day he received absolution; and, departing for London, was acquainted with 1) But that dass nicht."], [43, "29 the agreeable news of a victory over the Scots, obtained on the very day of his absolution. From that time Henry's affairs began to wear a better aspect: the barons, who had revolted, or were preparing for a revolt, made instant submission ; they delivered up their castles to the victor; and England, in a few weeks, was restored to perfect tranquillity. Young Henry, who was ready to embark with a- large army, to second the efforts of the Engdsh insur gents, finding ad disturbances quieted at home, abandoned all thoughts of the expedition. This prince died soon after, in the twenty-sixth year of his age, of a fever, at Martel, not without the deepest remorse for his undutiful conduct towards his father. As this prince left no posterity, Richard was become heir in his room ; and he soon discovered the same ardent ambition that had misled his elder brother. A Crusade having been once more projected, Richard, who had long wished to have all the glory of such an expe dition to himself, and who could not bear ito have even his father a partner in his victories, entered into a confederacy with the king of France, who promised to confirm him in those wishes to which he so ardently aspired. By this, Henry found himself obliged to give up ad hopes of taking the cross, and compelled to enter upon a war with France and his eldest son, who were unnaturady leagued against him. At last, however, a treaty was concluded, in which he was obliged to submit to many mortifying concessions. But stdl more so, when, upon demanding a list of the barons that it was stipulated he should pardon , he found his son John , his favourite child, among the number. He had long borne an in- firm state of body with calm resignation ; he had seen Ids chd- dren rebel without much emotion; but when he saw that child, whose interest always lay next to his heart, among the number of those who were in rebellion against him, he could no longer contain his indignation. He broke out into expressions of the utmost despair; cursed the day on which he had received his miserable being; and bestowed on his ungrateful chddren a malediction, which he never after could be prevaded upon to retract. The more his heart was disposed for friendship and"], [44, "30 affection, the more he resented this barbarous return ; and now, not having one corner in his heart where he could look for comfort, or fly for refuge from his conflicting passions, he lost all his former vivacity. A lingering fever, caused by a broken heart, soon after terminated his life and his miseries. He died at the castle of Chinon near Saumur, in the fifty-eighth year of his age, and the thirty-fifth of his reign; in the course of which he displayed all the abilities of a podtician , all the sa gacity of a legislator, and all the magnanimity of a hero. He left only_ two legitimate sons, Richard, who succeeded him, and John, who inherited no territory, and therefore received the surname of Lackland. Coeur de Lion. Richard, who succeeded to the throne without opposition^ resolved upon an expedition te the Holy Land, and took every method to raise! money for so expensive an undertaking. Having even sold his superiority over the kingdom of Scotland, which had been acquired in the last reign, for a moderate sum, he set out for the Holy Land, whither he was impelled by repeated messages from the king of France, who was ready to embark in the same enterprise. The first place of rendezvous for the two armies of Eng land and France, was the plain of Vevelay, on the borders of Burgundy, where, when Richard and Philip arrived, they found their armies amounting to a hundred thousand fighting men. Here the French prince and the English entered into the most solemn engagements of mutual support ; and, having determined to conduct their armies to the Holy Land by sea, they were obliged, however, by stress of weather, to take shelter in Mes sina, the capital of Sicily, where they were detained d.\"uring the whole winter. Richard took up his quarters in the suburbs, and possessed himself of a small fort, which commanded the harbour. Philip quartered Ids troops in the town, and lived upon good terms with the Sicilian king. Many were the mistrusts and the mutual reconciliations between these two monarchs, which were very probably in flamed by the Sicdian king's endeavours. At length, however,"], [45, "31 having settled ad controversies, they set sail for the Holy Land, where the French arrived long before the English. Upon the arrival of the English army in Palestine, however, fortune was seen to declare more openly in favour of the com mon cause. The French and English princes seemed to forget their secret jealousies, and to act in concert. But shortly after, Phidp, from the bad state of his health, returned to France, leaving Richard ten thousand of his troops, under the com mand of the duke of Burgundy. Richard being now left con ductor of the war, went on from victory to victory. The Chris tian adventurers, under his command, determined to besiege the renowned city of Ascalon, in order to prepare the way for attacking Jerusalem with greater advantage ; Saladin, the most heroic of ad the Saracen monarchs, was resolved to dispute their march, and placed himself upon the road with an army of three hundred thousand men. This was a day equal l) to Richard's wishes , this an enemy worthy his highest ambition. The Engdsh Crusaders were victorious. Richard, when the wings of his army were defeated, led on the main body in person, and restored the battle. The Saracens fled in the ut most confusion, and no less than forty thousand of their num ber perished on the field of battle. Ascalon soon surrendered after this victory ; other cities of less note followed the example ; and Richard was at last able to advance within sight of Jeru salem, the object of his long and ardent expectations. But just at this glorious juncture, his ambition was to suffer a to tal overthrow; upon reviewing his forces, and considering his abilities to prosecute the siege, he found that his army was so wasted with famine, fatigue, and even with victory, that they were neither able nor wddng to second the views of their com mander. It appeared, therefore, absolutely necessary to come to an accommodation with Saladin ; and a truce for three years was accordingly concluded; in which it was agreed, that the sea-port towns of Palestine should remain in the hands of the Christians; and that all of that religion should be permitted to make their pilgrimage to Jerusalem in perfect security. Richard , having thus concluded his expedition with more 1) Angemessen, entsprechend."], [46, "32 glory than advantage , began to think of returning home : but being obliged to take the road through Germany, in the habit of a pilgrim, he was arrested by Leopold, duke of Austria, who commanded him to. be imprisoned, and loaded with shack les, to the disgrace of honour and humanity. The emperor soon after required the prisoner to be dedvered up to him, and stipulated a large sum of money to the duke as a reward for his service. Thus the king of England , who had \u25a0 long filled the world with his fame, was basely .thrown into a dungeon, and loaded with irons, by those who expected to reap a sordid advantage from his misfortunes. It was some time before his subjects in England knew what was become of their beloved monarch. So little intercourse was there between different nations of that time, that this discovery is said by some to have been made by a poor French minstrel, who, playing upon his harp near the fortress in which Richard was confined, a tune which he knew that unhappy monarch was fond of, was answered by the king from within, who, with his harp, played the same tune ; and thus discovered the place of his confinement. However, the English at length prevailed upon this bar barous monarch, who now saw that he could no, longer detain his prisoner, to listen to terms of accommodation. A ransom was agreed upon, which amounted ,to a hundred and fifty thou sand marks, or about three hundred thousand pounds of our money; upon the payment of which, Richard was once more restored to his expecting subjects. Nothing could exceed the joy of the Engdsh upon seeing their monarch return, after all his achievements and sufferings. He made his entry into London in triumph; and such was the profusion of wealth shown by the citizens, that the German lords, who attended him, were heard to say, that if the emper or had known of their affluence , he would not so easily have parted with their king. He soon after ordered himself to be crowned anew at Winchester. He convoked a general council at Nottingham, at which he confiscated ad his brother John's possessions, who had basely endeavoured to prolong his captiv ity, and had gone over to the king of France with that intent. However, he pardoned him soon after, with this generous re-"], [47, "33 mark, \u201eI wish I could as easily forget my brother's offence as he will my pardon.\" Richard's death was occasioned by a singular accident. A vassal of the crown had taken possession of a treasure, which was found by one of his peasants, in digging a field in France; and, to secure the remainder, he sent a part of it to the king. Richard, as superior lord, sensible that he had a right to the whole, insisted on its being sent him; and, upon refusal, attacked the castle of Chalus, where he understood this treasure had been deposited. On the fourth day of the siege , as he was ridmg round the place to observe where the assault might be given with the fairest probability of success, he was aimed at by one Bertram de Jourdan, an archer, from the castle, and pierced in the shoulder with an arrow. The wound was not in itself dangerous; but an unskilful surgeon endeavouring to disengage the arrow from the flesh, so rank- led the wound, that it mortified, and brought on fatal symp- toms. Richard, when he found his end approaching, made a wdl, in which he bequeathed the kingdom, with all his trea- sure, to his brother John, except a fourth part, which he distributed among his servants. He ordered, also, that the archer who had shot him should be brought into his presence, and de- manded what injury he had done him that he should take away his life. The prisoner answered, with dedberate intrepidity, \u201eYou killed, with your own hands, my father, and my two brothers, and you intended to Lave hanged me. I am now in your power, and my torments may give you revenge, but I wdl endure them with pleasure, since it is my consolation, that I have rid the world of a tyrant.\" Richard, struck with this answer, ordered the soldier to be presented with one hundred shidings, and set at liberty: but Marcade, the general who commanded under him, like a true ruffian, ordered him to be flayed adve, and then hanged. Richard died in the tenth year of his reign, and the forty second of his age, leaving only one natural son, caded Philip, behind him. Magna Charta. John, who was readily put in possession of the English throne, lost no time to second his interest on the Continent; 3"], [48, "t 34 and his first care was to recover the revolted provinces from young Arthur, his nephew. But from the pride and cruelty of his temper, he soon became hateful to his subjects ; and his putting his nephew, Arthur, who had a right to the crown, to death, with his own hands, in prison, served to render him completely hateful. Hitherto John was rather hateful to his subjects than con temptible ; they rather dreaded than despised him. But he soon showed that he might be offended, if not without resent ment, at least with impunity. It was the fate of this vicious prince to make those the enemies of himself whom he wanted abilities to make the enemies of each other. The clergy had for some time acted as a community independent of the crown, and had their elections of each other generady confirmed by the pope, to whom alone they owed subjection. However the election of archbishops had for some time been a continual sub ject of dispute between the suffragan bishops J) and the Augus tine monks 2), and both had precedents 3) to confirm their pre tensions. John sided with the bishops, and sent two knights of his train, who were fit instruments for such a prince, to expel the monks from their convent, and to take possession of their revenues. The pope was not displeased with these di visions; and instead of electing either of the persons appointed by the contending parties, he nominated Stephen Langton archbishop of Canterbury. John, however, refusing to admit the man of the pope's choosing, the kingdom was put under an interdict. This instrument of terror in the hands of the see of Rome was calculated to strike the senses in the highest degree, and to operate upon the superstitious minds of the people. By it a stop was immediately put to divine service, and to the administration of ad the sacraments, except baptism. The church doors were shut; the statues of the saints were 1) A suffragan bishop ein Unterbischof, a bishop who is not a metropolitan ; suffragan = assisting. 2) Augustiner Monche; an order of monks so named from St. Au gustine. 3) A precedent eine Pracedenz , der vorher geschehene , als Richt schnur fur die Zukunft dienende Fall."], [49, "35 laid on the ground; the dead were refused christian burial, and were thrown into ditches on the highways, without the usual rites, or any funeral solemnity. No situation could be more deplorable than that of John upon this occasion. Furious at his indignities, jealous of his subjects, and apprehending an enemy in every face, it is said, that fearing a conspiracy against his life, he shut himself up a whole night in the castle of Nettingham, and suffered no one to approach his person. But what was his consternation when he found that the pope had actually given away his king dom to the monarch of France, and that the prince of that country was actually preparing an army to take possession of hiscrown? John, who, unsettled and apprehensive, scarcely knew where to turn, was still able to take an expiring effort to receive the enemy. All hated as he was, the natural enmity between the French and English, the name of king which he still retained, and some remaining power, put him at the head of sixty thousand men, a sufficient number indeed, but not to be relied on, and with these he advanced to Dover. Europe now regarded the important preparations on both sides with im- patience; and the decisive blow was soon expected, in which the church was to triumph, or to be overthrown. But neither Phi- lip nor John had ability equal to the pontifi' by whom they were actuated; who appeared on this occasion too refined a politician for either. He only intended to make use of Phi- lip's power to intimidate < his refractory son, not to destroy him. He intimated, therefore, to John, by his legate, that there was but one way to secure himself from impending danger; which was, to put himself under the pope's protection, who was a merciful father, and stdl wdling to receive a repentant sinner to his bosom. John was too much intimidated by the mani- fest danger of his situation, not to embrace every means of- fered for his safety. He assented to the truth of the legate's remonstrances, and took an oath to perform whatever stipu- lation the pope should impose. Having thus sworn to the per formance of an unknown command, the artful Italian so well managed the barons, and so effectually intimidated the king, that he persuaded him to take the most extraordinary oath in ad the records of history, before ad the people, kneeling upon 3*"], [50, "36 his knees, and with his hands held up between those of the legate. \u201eI, John, by the grace of God, king of .England, and lord of Ireland, in order to expiate my sins, from my own free wdl, and the advice of my barons, give to the church of Rome, to Innocent and his successors, the kingdom of England, and ad other prerogatives of my crown. I wdl here after hold them as the pope's vassal. I will be faithful to God, to the church of Rome, to the pope my master, and his successors legitimately elected. I promise to pay him a tribute of a thousand marks yearly; to wit, seven hundred for the kingdom of Ireland.\" Having thus done homage to the legate, and agreed to reinstate Langton in the Primacy, he received the crown, which he had been supposed to have forfeited, whde the legate trampled under his feet the tribute which John had consented to pay. Thus , by this most scandalous con cession, John for once more averted the threatened blow. ' - - - -- ; - \u2014 - In this manner, by repealed acts of cruelty, by expeditions without effect, and humiliations without reserve, John was be come the detestation of all mankind. The barons had been long forming a confederacy against him; but their union was broken, or their aims disappointed, by various and unforeseen accidents. At length, however, they assembled a large body of men at Stamford, and from thence, elated with their power, they marched to Brackley, about fifteen miles from Oxford, the place where the court then resided. John, hearing of their approach, sent the archbishop of Canterbury, the earl of Pembroke, and oth ers of the council, to know the particulars of their request, and what those liberties were which they so earnestly im portuned him to grant. The barons delivered a schedule, containing the chief articles of their demands, and of which the former charters of Henry and Edward formed the ground work. No sooner were these shewn to the king, than he burst ,into a furious passion, and asked why the barons did not also demand his kingdom, swearing that he could never comply with such exorbitant demands. But the confe deracy was now too strong to fear much from the consequen ces of bis resentment. They chose Robert Fitzwalter for their"], [51, "37 general, whom they dignified with the title of \u201eMareschal *) of the army of God, and of the holy church\" and proceeded without farther ceremony to make war upon the king. They besieged Northampton ; they took Bedford ; they were joyfully received in London. They wrote circular letters to all the nobdity and gentlemen who had not yet declared in their fa vour, and menaced their estates with devastation, in case of refusal or delay. John, struck with terror, first offered to refer ad differen ces to the pope alone, or to eight barons, four to be chosen by himself, and four by the confederates. This the barons scornfudy rejected. He then assured them that he would sub mit at discretion; and that it was his supreme pleasure to grant ad their demands: a conference was accordingly ap pointed, and all things adjusted for this most important treaty. The ground where the king's commissioners met the ba rons was between Staines and Windsor, at a place called Ru nimede, stid held in reverence by posterity, as the spot where the standard of freedom was first erected in England. There the barons appeared with a vast number of knights and war riors, on the fifteenth day of June, while those on the king's part came a day or two after. Both sides encamped apart, like open enemies. The debates between power and precedent are generally but of short continuance. The barons, on car rying their aims, would admit of but few abatements; and the king's agents being for the most part in their interest, few de bates ensued. After some days the king, with a facility that was somewhat suspicious, signed and sealed the charter re quired of him: a charter which continues in force to this day and is the famous bulwark of English dberty, which now goes by the name of Magna Charta. This famous deed either granted or secured freedom to those orders of the kingdom that were already possessed of it, namely, to the clergy, the barons, and the gentlemen: as for the inferior, and the great est part of the people, they were as yet held as slaves, and it was long before they could come to a participation of legal protection. 1) Mareschal ~ marshal,"], [52, "38 John , however , could not wed brook those concessions that were extorted from his fears; he therefore took the first opportunity of denying to be in the least governed by them. This produced a second civd war, in which the barons were obliged to have recourse to the king of France for assistance. Thus England saw nothing but a prospect of being every way undone. If John succeeded, a tyrannical and implacable mo narch was to be their tormentor; if the French king should prevad, the country was ever after to submit to a more pow erful monarchy, and was to become a* province of France. What neither human prudence could foresee, nor policy sug gest, was brought about by a happy and unexpected event. John had assembled a considerable army, with a view to make one great effort for the crown; and, at the head of a large body of troops, resolved to penetrate into the heart of the kingdom. With these resolutions he departed from Lynn, which, for its fidelity , he had distinguished with many marks of favour, and directed his rout towards Lincolnshire. His road lay along the shore, which was overflowed at high water ; but not being apprised of this or being ignorant of the tide of the place, he lost ad his carriages, treasure, and baggage by its indux. He himself escaped with the greatest difficulty, and arrived at the abbey of Swinstead, where his grief for the loss he had sustained, and the distracted state of his affairs, threw him into a fever, which soon appeared to be fatal. Next day, being unable to ride on horseback, he was carried in a litter to the castle of Seaford, and from thence removed to Newark, where, after having made his will, he died in the fifty first year of his age, and the eighteenth of his detested reign. The House of Commons. A claim was made, upon the death of John, in favour of young Henry, the son of the late king, who was now but nine years of age. The earl of Pembroke, a noble man of great worth and valour; who had faithfully adhered to John in all the fluctuations of his fortune, determined to support his declining interests, and had him solemnly crowned, by the bishops of Winchester and Bath, at Gloucester. The young king was of a character the very opposite to"], [53, "39 his father; as he grew up to man's estate, he was found to be gentle, merciful, and humane; he appeared easy and good natured to his dependents, but no way formidable to^ his ene mies. Without activity or vigour, he was unfit to conduct in war; without distrust or suspicion, he was imposed upon in times of peace. As weak princes are never without governing favourites, he first placed his affections on Hubert de Burgh, and he be coming obnoxious to the people, the place was soon supplied by Peter de Roches, bishop of Winchester, a Poictevin x) by birth, a man remarkable for his arbitrary conduct, his courage, and his abilities. Henry, in pursuance of this prelate's advice, invited over a great number of Poictevins, and other foreign ers , who , having neither principles nor fortunes at home, were willing to adopt whatever schemes their employer should pro pose. Every office and command was bestowed on these un principled strangers, whose avarice and rapacity were exceeded only by their pride and insolence. So unjust a partiality to strangers very naturally excited the jealousy of the barons ; and they even ventured to assure the king, that if he did not dismiss all foreigners from court, they would drive both him and them out of the kingdom : but their anger was scarce kept within bounds, when they saw a new swarm of these intruders come over from Gascony, with Isabella, the king's mother, who had been some time before married to the count de la Marche. To these just causes of complaint, were added the king's unsuccessful expeditions to the Continent, his total want of economy, and his oppressive exactions, which were but the result of the former. The kingdom therefore waited with gloo my resolutions, resolving to take vengeance, when the general discontent arrived at maturity. This imprudent preference, joined to a thousand other ille gal evasions of justice, at last impeded Simon Montford, earl of Leicester, to attempt an innovation in the government, and to wrest the sceptre from the feeble hand that held it. This noble man was the son of the famous general who commanded 1) One of the town of Poictiers or the country of Poictou."], [54, "40 against the Albigenses x), a sect of enthusiasts that had been destroyed some time before in the kingdom of Savoy. He was married to the king's sister; and by his power and ad dress, was possessed of a strong interest in the nation, having gained equally the affections of the great and the dttle. The place where the formidable confederacy which he had formed first discovered itself, was in the pardament-house, where the barons appeared in complete armour. The king, upon his entry, asked them what was their intention; to which they submissively replied, to make him their sovereign, by confirm ing his power, and to have their grievances redressed. Henry, who was ready enough to promise whatever was demanded, instantly assured them of his intentions to give ad possible satisfaction ; and, for that purpose , summoned a pardament at Oxford, to digest a new plan of government, and to elect pro per persons, who were to be entrusted with the chief authority. This parliament, afterwards caded the mad parliament, went expeditiously to work upon the business of reformation. Twenty four barons were appointed, with supreme authority, to re form the abuses of the state, and Leicester was placed at their head. The whole state in their hands underwent a complete alteration ; all its former ofdcers were displaced, and creatures of the twenty-four barons were put in their room. They not only abridged the authority of the king, but the efficacy of pardament, giving up to twelve persons ad parliamentary power between each session. Thus these insolent noblesr after having trampled upon the crown, threw prostrate all the rights of the people, and a vde oligarchy was on the point of being estab dshed for ever. The first opposition that was made to these usurpations, was from a p'ower which but lately began to take place in the constitution. The knights of the shire 2) who for some time had begun to be regularly assembled in a separate house, 1) Die Albigenser , a sect of Protestants , so called from Albi in Upper Lauguedoc. where they originated. 2) Vertreter der Grafschaft.

The counties are re presented by knights elected by the proprietors of land: the cities and boroughs are represented by citizens and burgesses."], [55, "41 now first perceived these grievances, and complained against them. They represented that their own interests and power seemed the only aim of all their decrees; and they even call ed upon the king's eldest son, prince Edward, to interpose his authority, and save the sinking nation. Prince Edward was at this time about twenty-two years of age. The hopes which were conceived of his abilities and his integrity rendered him important personage in the trans actions of the times, and in some measure atoned for his fa ther's imbecibty. He had, at a very early age, given the strongest proofs' of courage, of wisdom, and of constancy. At first, indeed, when applied to, appearing sensible of what his father had suffered by levity and breach of promise, he refused some time to tisten to the people's earnest application; but being at last persuaded to concur, a parliament was called, in which the king assumed his former authority. This being considered as a breach of the late convention, a civd war ensued, in which, in a pitched battle, the earl of Leicester became victorious, and the king was taken prisoner, but soon after exchanged for prince Edward, who was to re main as a hostage to insure the punctual observance of the former agreement. With all these advantages, however, Leicester was not so entirely secure, but that he still feared the combination of the foreign states against him, as well as the internal machina tions of the royal party. In order, therefore, to secure his ill-acquired power, he was obliged to have recourse to an aid tdl now entirely unknown in England, namely, that of the body of the people. He caded a parliament, where, besides the barons of his own party, and several ecclesiastics, who were not immediate tenants of the crown, he ordered returns1) to be made of two knights from every shire; and also depu ties from' the boroughs 2), which had been hitherto considered as too inconsiderable to have a voice in legislation. \u25a0 This is 1) Abordnungen , Wahlen. 2) A borough, Burgflecken, prop, a corporate town which is not a city ; that is also a borough which sends burgesses to parliament, whether a corporate town or not."], [56, "42 the first confirmed outline of an English house of Commons 1). The people had been gaining some consideration since the gra dual diminution of the force of the feudal system. This parliament, however, was found not so very comply ing as he expected. Many of the barons, who had hitherto sted fastly adhered to his party, appeared disgusted at his immod erate ambition; and many ofdfhe people, who found that a change of masters was not a change for happiness, began to wish for the re-establishment of the royal family. In this exigence, Leicester finding himself unable to oppose the con curring wishes of the nation, was resolved to make a merit of what he could not prevent; and he accordingly released prince Edward from confinement, and had him introduced at Westminster had, where his freedom was confirmed by the un animous voice of the barons. But though Leicester had ad the popularity of restoring the prince, yet he was podtic enough to keep him stdl guarded by his emissaries, who watched ad his motions, and frustrated all his aims. Wherefore the prince, upon hearing that the duke of Glou cester was up in arms in his cause , took an opportunity to escape from his guards, and put himself at the head of his party. A battle soon after ensued ; but the earl's army having been exhausted by famine on the mountains of Wales, were but ill able to sustain the impetuosity of young Edward's at tack, who bore down upon them with incredible fury. During this terrible day, Leicester behaved with astonishing intrepidity ; and kept up the spirit of the action from two o' clock in the afternoon till nine at night. At last, his horse being killed under him, he was compelled to; fight on foot; and though he de manded quarter, the adverse party refused it, with a barbarity common enough in the times we are describing. The old king, who was placed in the front of the battle, was soon wounded in the shoulder; and not being known by his friends, he was on the point of being killed by a soldier; but crying out, \u201eI am Henry of Winchester, the king\", he was saved by a knight 1) Ever since the conquest of England by William of Normandy, the parliament had been composed only of the king, the barons and the bishops, and the great body of the people had no voice therein."], [57, "43 of the royal army. Prince Edward hearing the voice of his father, instantly ran to the spot where he lay, and had him conducted to a place of safety. The body of Leicester being found among the dead, was barbarously mangled by one Roger Mortimer; and then with an accumulation of inhumanity, sent to the wretched widow as a testimony of the royal party's success. This victory proved decisive; and the prince having thus restored peace to the kingdom, found his affairs so firmly es tablished, that he resolved upon taking the cross, which was at that time the highest object of human ambition. In persuance of this resolution, Edward sailed from Eng land with a large army, and arrived at the camp of Lewis, the king of France, which lay before Tunis; and where he had the misfortune to hear of that good monarch's death be fore his arrival. The prince, however, no way discouraged by this event, continued the voyage, and arrived at the Holy Land in safety. He was scarce departed upon this pious expedition, when the health of the old king began to decline; and he found not only his own constitution, but also that of the state, in such a dangerous situation, that he wrote letters to his son, pressing him to return with all despatch. At last, being overcome by the cares of government and the infirmities of age, he ordered himself to be removed, by easy journies, from St. Edmund's to Westminter, and that same night expired, in the sixty-fourth year of his age, and the fifty-sixth of his reign, one of the longest to be met with in the annals of England. Tlie subjugation of Wales. While the unfortunate Henry was thus vainly struggling with the ungovernable spirit of his subjects, his son and suc cessor, Edward, was employed in the Holy Wars, where he re vived the glory of the English name, and made the enemies of Christianity tremble. He was stabbed, however, by one of those Mahometan enthusiasts, called Assassins, as he was one day sitting in his tent, and was cured not without great difficulty. Some say that he owed his safety to the piety of"], [58, "44 Eleanora, his wife, who sucked the poison from the wound to safe his life, at the hazard of her own. Though the death of the late king happened while the successor was so far from home, yet measures had been so well taken, that the crown was transferred with the greatest tranquillity. As Edward was now come to an undisputed throne, the opposite interests were proportionably feeble. The barons were exhausted by long and mutual dissensions; the clergy were divided in their interests, and agreed only in one point, to hate the pope , who had for some time drained them with impunity : the people, by some insurrections against the convents, appear ed to hate the clergy with equal animosity. These disagreeing orders only concurred in one point, that of esteeming and re verencing the king. He therefore thought this the most favour able conjuncture for uniting England with Wales. The Welsh had for many ages enjoyed their own laws, language, customs and opinions. They were the remains of the ancient Britons, who had escaped the Roman and Saxon invasions, and still preserved their freedom and their country uncontaminated by the admission of foreign conquerors. But as they were, from their number, incapable of withstanding their more powerful neighbours on the plain, their chief defence lay in their in accessible mountains, those natural bulwarks of the country. Whenever England was distressed by factions at home, or its forces called off to wars abroad, the Welsh made it a constant practice to pour in their irregular troops , and lay the open country waste wherever they came. Nothing could be more pernicious to a country than several neighbouring independent principalities, under different commanders, and pursuing dif ferent interests; the mutual jealousies of such were sure to harass the people ; and wherever victory was purchased, it was always at the expense of the general welfare. Sensible of this, Edward had long wished to reduce that incursive people, and had ordered Llewellyn to do homage \"for his territories ; which summons the Welsh prince refused to obey,~unless the king's own son should be delivered as a hostage for his safe return. The king was not displeased at this refusal, as it served to give him a pretext for his intended invasion. He therefore lev-"], [59, "45 ied an army against Llewellyn, and marched into his coun try with certain assurance of success. Upon the approach of Edward, the Welsh prince took re fuge among the accessible mountains of Snowdon, and there resolved to maintain his ground, without trusting to the chance of a battle. These were the steep retreats that had for many ages before defended his ancestors against all the attempts of the Norman and Saxon conquerors. But Edward, equally vig orous and cautious, having explored every part of his way, pierced into the very centre of Llewellyn's territories, and ap proached the Welsh army in its last retreats. Here, after ex torting submission from the Welsh prince, the king retired. But an idle prophecy, in which it was foretold, by Merlin, that Llewellyn was to be the restorer of Brutus's empire in Britain, was an inducement sufficiently strong to persuade this prince to revolt once more, and hazard a decisive battle against the English. With this view he marched into Radnorshire; and passing the river Wey, his troops were surprised and defeated by Edward Mortimer, while he himself was absent from his army, on a conference with one of the barons of that country. Upon his return, seeing the dreadful situation of his affairs, he ran desperately into the midst of the enemy , and quickly found that death he so ardently sought for. David, the broth er of this unfortunate prince, soon after fell in the same cause; and with him expired the government, and the distinc tion of the Welsh nation. It was soon after united to the king dom of England, made a principality, and given to the eldest son of the crown. Foreign conquest might add to the glory, but this added to the felicity of the kingdom. The Welsh were now blended with the conquerors; and, in the revolution of a few ages, all national animosity was entirely forgotten. William Wallace and Robert Bruce. Soon after, the death of Margaret, queen of Scotland, gave Edward hopes of adding Scotland also to his dominions. The death of this princess produced a most ardent dispute about the succession to the Scottish throne, it being claimed by no less than twelve competitors. The claims, however, of all the other candidates were reduced to three, who where the des-"], [60, "46 cendants of the earl of Huntingdon by three daughters; John Hastings , who claimed in right of his mother x) as one of the coheiresses of the crown; John Baliol, who alleged his right, as being descended from the eldest daughter, who was his grandmother; and Robert Bruce, who was the actual son of the second daughter. This dispute being referred to Edward's decision, with a strong degree of assurance, he claimed the crown for himself, and appointed Baliol his deputy. Baliol being thus placed upon the Scottish throne, less as a king than as a vassal, Edward's first step was sufficient to convince that people of his intentions to stretch the preroga tive to the utmost. Upon the most frivolous pretences, he sent six different summonses for Baliol to appear in London, at different times in one year, so that the poor Scottish king soon perceived that he was possessed of the name only, but not the authority of a sovereign. Willing, therefore, to shake off the yoke of so troublesome a master, Baliol revolted, and procured the pope's absolution from his former oath of homage. But no power the Scots could bring into the field was able to withstand the victorious army of Edward. He over threw their forces in many engagements , and thus becoming undisputed master of the kingdom, he took every precaution to secure his title, and to abolish those distinctions which might be apt to keep the nation in its former independence. Baliol was carried a prisoner to London; and he carefully destroyed all records and monuments of antiquity that inspired the Scots with a spirit of national pride. These expeditions, however, terminated rather in glory than advantage : the expenses which were requisite for carrying on the war were] not only burthensome to the king, but even, in the event, threatened to shake him on his throne. In order at first to set the great machine in movement, he raised con siderable supphes by means of his parliament; and that august body was then first modelled by him into the form in which it continues to this day. As a great part of the property of the kingdom was, by the introduction of commerce, and the improvement of agriculture, transferred from the barons to the 1) Von Seiten seiner Mutter."], [61, "47 lower classes of the people, so their consent was thought ne cessary for the raising any considerable supplies. For this reason, he issued writs to the sheriffs, enjoining them to send to parliament, along with two knights of the shire (as in the the former reign) two deputies from each borough within their county; and these provided with sufficient power from their consti tuents x) to grant such demands as they could think reasonable for the safety of the state. One of the first efforts, therefore, was to oblige the king's council to sign the Magna Charta, and to add a clause, to secure the nation for ever against all impositions and taxes, without the consent of parliament. This the king's council (for Edward was at that time at Flanders) readdy agreed to sign and the king himself, when it was sent over to him, after some hesitation thought proper to do the same. These concessions he again confirmed upon his return; and though it is probable he was averse to granting them, yet he was at last brought to give a plenary consent to all the articles that were demanded of him. Thus, after the contest of an age, the Magna Charta was finally established; nor was it the least circumstance in its favour, that its confirmation was procured from one of the greatest and boldest princes that ever swayed the English sceptre. In the mean time, William Wallace, so celebrated in Scott ish story , attempted to rescue Scotland from the English yoke. He was younger son of a gentleman who lived in the western part of the kingdom. He was a man of a gigantic stature, incredible strength , and amazing intrepidity ; eagerly desirous of independance , and possessed with the most desinterested spirit of patriotism. To this man had resorted all those who were obnoxious to the English government; the proud, the bold, the criminal, and the ambitious. These, bred among dan gers and hardships themselves, could not forbear admiring in their leader a degree of patience, under fatigue and famine, which they supposed beyond the power of human nature to endure ; he soon, therefore, became the principal object of their affection and their esteem. His first exploits were confined to petty ravages, and occasional attacks upon the English; but 1) WUhler, Abordner."], [62, "48 he soon overthrew the English armies, and slew their ge nerals. Edward, who had been over in Flanders while these mis fortunes happened in England, hastened back with impatience to restore his authority, and secure his former conquests. He quickly levied the whole force of his dominions; and at the head of a hundred thousand men directed his march to the north, fully resolved to take vengeance upon the Scots for their late defection. A battle was fought at Falkirk, at which Edward gained a complete victory, leaving twelve thousand of the Scots, or, as some wdl have it, fifty thousand, dead upon the field, while the English had not a hundred slam. A blow so dreadful had not as yet entirely crushed the spirit of the Scotish nation ; and after a short interval, they be gan to breathe from their calamities. Wallace, who had gained all their regards by his valour, shewed that he still merited them more by his declining the rewards of ambition.' Perceiving how much he was envied by the nobdity, and knowing how prejudicial that envy would prove to the inter ests of his country , he resigned the regency of the kingdom,. and humbled himself to a private station. He proposed Gum ming as the most proper person to supply his room; and that nobleman endeavoured to shew himself worthy of this pre-emin ence. He soon] began to annoy the enemy; and not content with a defensive war, made incursions into the southern coun ties of the kingdom, which Edward had imagined wholly sub dued. They attacked an army lying at Roslin, near Edinburgh, and gained a complete victory. But it was not easy for any circumstances of bad fortune to repress the enterprising spirit of the king. He assembled a great fleet and army; and entering the frontiers of Scot land, appeared with a force which the enemy could not think of resisting in the open field. Assured of success, he marched along, and traversed the kingdom from one end to the other, ravaging the open countiy, taking all the castles, and receiv ing the submission of all the nobles.i There seemed to remain only one obstacle to the final destruction of the Scottish mon archy, and that was Wdliam Wallace, who stdl continued re-"], [63, "49 fractory; and wandering with a few forces from mountain to mountain, preserved his native independence and usual good fortune. But even their feeble hopes from him were soon dis appointed ; he was betrayed into the king's hands by Sir John Monteith, his friend, whom he had made acquainted with the place of his concealment, being surprised by him as he lay asleep, in the neighbourhood of Glasgow. The king, willing to strike the Scots with an example of severity, ordered him to be conducted in chains to London, where he was hanged, drawn, and quartered, with the most brutal ferocity. Robert Bruce, who was a grandson of the competitor for the crown, and had been long kept prisoner in London, at length, 'escaping from his guards, resolved to strike for his country's freedom. Having murdered one of the king's ser vants, he left himself no resource but to confirm, by desperate valour, what he had begun in cruelty; and he soon expelled such of the English forces as had fixed themselves in the king dom. Soon after, he was solemnly crowned king, by the bish op of St. Andrews, in the abbey of Scone; and numbers flocked to his standard, resolved to confirm his pretensions. Thus, afer twice conquering the kingdom, and as often par doning the delinquents; after having spread his victories in every quarter of the country, and receiving the most humble submissions, the old king saw that his whole work was to be gin afresh ; and that nothing but the final destruction of the inhabitants could give him assurance of tranquillity. But no difficulties could repress the ardent spirit of this monarch, who, though now verging towards his decline, yet resolved to strike a parting blow, and to make the Scots once more tremble at his appearance. He vowed revenge against the whole nation; and averred, that nothing but reducing them to the complet est bondage could satisfy his resentment. He summoned his prelates, nobility , and all who held by knight's service x), to meet him at Carlisle, which was appointed as the general ren dezvous ; and in the mean time he detached a body of forces before him to Scotland, under the command of Aymer de Valence, 1) Knight's-service Eitterdienst, lands held by knight's-service Eitter lehen. 4"], [64, "50 who began the threatened infliction by a complete victory over Bruce, near Methwen, in Perthshire. Immediately after this dreadful blow, the resentful king appeared in person, entering Scotland with his army divided into two parts, and expecting to find, in 'the opposition of the people, a pretext for punish ing them. But this brave prince, who was never cruel but from motives of policy, could not strike the poor submitting natives who made no resistance. His anger was disappointed in their humiliation; and he was ashamed to extirpate those who only opposed patience to his indignation. His death put an end to the apprehensions of the Scots, and effectuaUy res cued their country from total subjection. He sickened and died at Carlisle, of a dysentery; enjoining his son, with his last breath, to prosecute the enterprise, and never to desist, till he had finady subdued the kingdom. He expired July 7, 1307, in the sixty-ninth year of his age, and the thirty-fifth of his reign, after having added more to the solid interests of the kingdom than any of those who went before, or succeeded him. Gravestone and the two Spensers. Edward was in the twenty-third year of his age when he succeeded his father; of an agreeable figure, of a mild harm less disposition, and apparently addicted to few vices. But he soon gave symptoms of his unfitness to succeed so great a mon arch as his father, he was rather fond of the enjoyment of his power than of securing it; and, lulled by the flattery of his courtiers, he thought he had done enough for glory, when he had accepted the crown. Instead, therefore, of prosecuting the war against Scotland, according to the injunctions he had re ceived from his dying father, he took no steps to check the progress of Bruce; his march into that country being rather a procession of pageantry than a warlike expedition. Weak monarchs are ever governed by favourites, and the first Edward placed his affections upon was Piers Gavestone, the son of a Gascon knight, who had been long employed in the service of the late king. This young man was adorned with every accomplishment of person and mind that was ca pable of creating affection; but he was utterly destitute of those qualities of heart and understanding that serve to pro-"], [65, "51 cure esteem. He was beautiful, witty, .brave and active; but then he was vicious, effeminate, debauched, and trifling. These were qualities entirely adapted to the taste of the young mon arch, and he seemed to think no rewards equal to his deserts. Gavestone, on the other hand, intoxicated with his power, be came haughty and overbearing and treated the English nobil ity , from which it is probable he received marks of contempt, with scorn and derision. A conspiracy, therefore, was soon formed against him, at the head of which queen Isabel, and the earl of Lancaster, a nobleman of great power, were asso ciated. It was easy to perceive, that a combination of the nobles, whfle the queen secretly assisted then designs, would be too powerful against the efforts of a weak king and a vain favour- ite. The king, timid and wavering, banished him at their solicitation , and recalled him soon after. This was sufficient to spread an alarm over the whole kingdom ; all the great bar- ons flew to arms, and the earl of Lancaster put himself at the head of this irresistible confederacy. The unhappy Ed- ward, instead of attempting to make resistance, sought only for safety: ever happy in the company of his favourite, he embarked at Tinmouth, and saded with him to Scarborough, where he left Gavestone as in a place of safety, and then went back to York himself, either to raise an army to oppose his enemies, or, by his presence, to allay their animosity. In the mean time, Gavestone was besieged in Scarbourough by the earl of Pembroke: and had the garrison been sufficiently sup- plied with provisions, the place would have been impregnable. But Gavestone, sensible of the bad condition of the garrison. -took the earliest opportunity to offer terms of capitulation. He stipulated, that he should remain in Pembroke's hands as a prisoner for two months; and that endeavours should be used, in the mean time, for a general accommodation. But Pembroke had no intention that he should escape so easdy; he ordered him to be conducted to the castle of Deddington, near Ban- bury, where, on pretence of other business , he left him with a feeble guard, which the earl of Warwick having information of, he attacked the castle in which the infortunate Gavestone was confined, and quickly made himself master of his person. 4*"], [66, "52 The earls of Lancaster, Hereford, and Arundel, were soon ap prised of Warwick's success, and informed that their common enemy was now in custody in Warwick castle. Thither, there fore, they, hastened with the utmost expedition, to hold a consultation upon the fate of their prisoner. This was of no long continuance; they unanimously resolved to put him to death, as an enemy to the kingdom, and gave him no time to prepare for his execution. They instantly had him conveyed to a place called Blacklow-hill , where a Welsh executioner, provided for that purpose, severed his head from his body. To add to Edward's misfortunes, he soon after suffered a most signal defeat from the Scots army imder Bruce, near Bannockburn ; and this drove him once more to seek for relief in some favourite's company. The name of his new favourite was Hugh De Spenser, a young man of a noble English fam ily, of some merit, and very engaging accomplishments. His father was a person of a much more estimable character than the son ; he was venerable for his years, and respected through life for his wisdom, his valour, and his integrity. But these excellent qualities were all diminished and vilified, from the moment he and his son began to share the king's favour, who even dispossessed some lords unjustly of their estates, in order to accumulate them upon his favourite. This was a pre text the king's enemies had been long seeking for; the earls of Lancaster and Hereford flew to arms; sentence was pro cured from parliament of perpetuate exile against the two Spen sers, and a forfeiture of their fortune and estates. The king, however, at last rousing from his lethargy, took the field in the defence of his beloved Spenser, and at the head of thirty thousand men pressed the earl of Lancaster so closely, that he had no time to collect his forces together; and flying from one place to another, he was at last stopt in his way towards Scotland by Sir Andrew Harela, and made prisoner. As he had formerly shewn little mercy to Gavestone, there was very little extended to him upon this occasion. He was condemned by a court-martial1); and led, mounted on a lean horse, to 1) Kriegsgericht,"], [67, "53 an eminence near Pomfret, in circumstances of the greatest in dignity, where he was beheaded by a Londoner. A rebellion, thus crushed, served only to increase the pride and rapacity of young Spenser; .most of the forfeitures were seized for his use; and in his promptitude to punish the de linquents, he was found guflty of many acts of rapine and in justice. But he was now to oppose a more formidable enemy in Queen Isabella, a cruel, haughty woman, who fled over to France, and refused to appear in England till Spenser was re moved from the royal presence, and banished the kingdom1). By this conduct she gained two very considerable advantages ; she became popular in England, where Spenser was univer sally disliked; and she had the pleasure of enjoying the com pany of a young nobleman, whose name was Mortimer, upon whom she had placed her affections. The queen's court now, therefore, became a sanctuary for aU the malecontents who were banished their own country, or who chose to come ov%r. Accordingly, soon after, accompanied by three thousand men at arms, she set out from Dort harbour, and landed safely, without opposition, on the coast of Suffolk. She no sooner appeared than there seemed a general revolt in her favour; and the unfortunate king found the spirit of disloyalty was not confined to the capital alone, but diffused over the whole king dom. He had placed some dependence upon the garrison which was stationed in the castle of Bristol, under the command of the elder Spenser; but they mutinied against their governor, and that unfortunate favourite was delivered up, and condemned by the tumultuous barons to the most ignominious death. He was hanged on a gibbet, in his armour, his body was cut in pieces, and thrown to the dogs, and his head was sent to Win chester, where it was set on a pole, and exposed to the insults of the populace. Young Spenser, the unhappy son, did not long survive the father; he was taken with some others who had followed the fortunes of the wretched king, in an obscure convent in Wales, and the merciless victors resolved to glut their revenge ? in. 1) Aus dem Konigreiche."], [68, "54 adding insult to cruelty. The queen had not patience to wait the formality of a trial; but ordered him immediately to be led forth before the insulting populace, and seemed to take a savage pleasure in feasting her eyes with his distresses. The gibbet erected for his execution was fifty feet high; his head was sent to London, where the citizens received it in brutal triumph, and fixed it on the bridge. Several other lords also shared his fate ; all deserving pity, indeed, had they not them selves formerly justified the present inhumanity, by setting a cruel example. In the mean time the king, who hoped to find refuge in Wales, was quickly discovered, and delivered up to his adver saries, who expressed their satisfaction in the grossness of their treatment. He was conducted to the capital., amidst the insults and reproaches of the people, and confined in the Tower. A charge was soon after exhibited J) against him , 'in which no other crimes but his incapacity to govern, his indolence, his love of pleasure, and his being swayed by evd councillors, were objected against him. His deposition was quickly voted by parliament ; he was assigned2) a pension for his support ; his son, Edward, a youth of fourteen, was fixed upon to succeed him, and the queen was appointed regent during the minority. The deposed monarch but a short time survived his mis fortunes; he was sent from prison to prison, a wretched out cast , and the sport of his inhuman keepers. He had been at first consigned to the custody of the earl of Lancaster; but this nobleman shewing some marks of respect and pity, he was taken out of his hands, and delivered over to lords Berke ley, Montravers, and Gournay, who were intrusted with the charge of guarding him each for a month. Whatever his treat ment from lord Berkeley might have been, the other two seemed resolved that he should enjoy none of the comforts of life whde in their custody. They practised every kind of indig nity upon him, as if their design had been to accelerate his death by the bitterness of his sufferings. Among other acts of brutal oppression, it is said that 1) To exhibit a charge eine Klage anbringen, einreichen. 2) Ihm wurde angewiesen."], [69, "55 they shaved him for sport in the open fields, using water from a neighbouring ditch. He is said to have borne his former indignities with patience, but all fortitude forsook him on this occasion ; he looked upon his merciless insulters with an air of fallen majesty, and bursting into tears, exclaimed, that the time might come when he would be more decently attended. This, however, was but a vain expectation. As his persecutors saw that his death might not arrive , even under every cruelty, tdl a revolution had been made in his favour, they resolved to rid themselves of their fears, by destroying him at once. Accordingly, his two keepers, Gournay and Montravers, came to Berkeley castle, where Edward was then confined, and having concerted a method of putting him to death without any ex ternal violence, they threw him on a bed, holding him down by a table which they had placed over him. They then ran a horn pipe up Ris body, through which they conveyed a red hot iron, and thus burnt his bowels without disfiguring his body. By this cruel artifice they expected to have their crime concealed, but his horid shrieks, which were heard at a distance from the castle, gave a suspicion of the murder; and the whole was soon after divulged by the confession of one of the ac complices. Misfortunes like this must ever create pity; and a punishment so disproportionated to the sufferer's guilt, must wipe away even many of those faults of which Edward was un doubtedly culpable. Mortimer. The parliament by which young Edward was raised to the throne, during the life of his father, appointed twelve per sons as his privy-councd x) to direct the operations of govern ment. Mortimer, the queen's paramour, who might naturally be set down as one of the members, artfully excluded himself under a pretended show of moderation ; but, at the same time, he secretly influenced all the measures that came under their deliberation. He caused the greatest part of the royal reve nues to be settled on the queen dowager, and he seldom took the trouble to consult the ministers of government in any pub- 1) Der geheime Eath,"], [70, "56 lie undertaking. The king himself even was so besieged by the favourite's creatures, that no access coidd be procured to him, and the whole sovereign authority was shared between Mortimer and the queen, who took no care to conceal her crim inal attachment. At length, however, Edward was resolved to shake off an authority that was odious to the nation, and particularly re strictive upon him. But such was the power of the favourite, that it required as much precaution to overturn the usurper, as to establish the throne. The queen and Mortimer had for some time chosen the castle of Nottingham for the place of their residence; it was strictly \"guarded, the gates locked every evening, and the keys carried to the queen. It was therefore agreed between the king and some of his barons, who secretly entered into his designs, to seize upon them in the fortress; and for that purpose, Sir William Eland, trie governor, was induced to admit them by a secret subterraneous passage, which had been formerly contrived for an outlet, but was now hidden with rubbish , and known only to one or two. It was by this, therefore, the noblemen in the king's interests entered the castle in the night; and Mortimer, without having it in his power to make any resistance, was seized in an apartment adjoining that of the queen. It was in vain that she endeavoured to protect him; in vain she entreated them, to spare her \u201egentle Mortimer\" ; the barons, deaf to her entrea ties, denied her that pity which he had so often refused to others. Her paramour was condemned by the parliament, which was then sitting, without being permitted to make his defence, or even examining a witness against him. He was hanged [on a gibbet at a place called Elmes, about a mile from London, where his body was left hanging for two days after. The queen, who was certainly the most culpable, was shielded by the dignity of her situation ; she was only discarded from all share of power, and confined for life in the castle of Risings, with a pension of three thousands a year. From this confine ment she was never after set free; and though the king an nually paid her a visit of decent ceremony, yet she found her self abandoned to universal contempt and detestation; and con-"], [71, "57 tinued, for above twenty-five years after, a miserable monument of blasted ambition. The French war. In order still more to secure the people's affections, Ed ward made a successful irruption into Scotland, in which, in one battle, fought at Halidon-hill, about thirty thousand of the Scots were slain. Soon after, he turned his arms against France, which was at that time particularly unfortunate. Lewis Hutin having left only a daughter, his brother, Philip the Tall, Bad assumed the crown, in prejudice of the daughter; and vindicated his title by the Salic law x), which laid it down, that no female should succeed to the crown. Edward, however, urged his pretensions, as being, by his mother Isabella, who was daughter to Philip the Fair, and sister to the three last kings of France, rightful heir to the crown. But first, he, in a formal manner, consulted his parliament on the propriety of the undertaking, obtained their approbation, received a proper supply of wool, which he intended to barter with the Flemings; and being attended with a body of EngUsh forces, and several of his nobility, he sailed to Flanders , big with 2) his intended conquests. The first great advantage gained by the English was in a naval engagement on the coast of Flanders, in which the French lost two hundred and thirty ships, and had thirty thou sand of their seamen, and two of their admirals, slain. The intelligence of Edward's landing, and the devastation caused by his troops, who dispersed themselves over the whole face of the country, soon spread universal consternation through the French court. Caen was taken and plundered by the Eng lish, without mercy; the villages and towns, even up to Paris, snared the same fate; and the French had no other resource but by breaking down their bridges,, to attempt putting a stop to the invader's career. Philip, then king of France, was not idle in making preparations to repress the enemy. He had 1) The Salic law, or the Salique law das salische Gesetz (der alten Franken). 2) Voll von, stolz aus \u2014"], [72, "58 stationed one of his generals, Godemar de Faye, with an army on the opposite side of the river Somme, over which Edward was to pass; whde he him self, at te head of one hundred thousand men, advanced to give the English battle. As both armies had for some time been in sight of each other, nothing was so eagerly expected on each side as a 'battle; and although the forces were extremely disproportioned , the English, amounting only to thirty thousand,, the French to a hundred and twenty thousand, yet Edward resolved to indulge the impetuosity of his troops, and put all to the hazard of a battle. He accordingly chose his ground with advantage, near the village of Crecy; and there determined to await with tran quillity the shock of the enemy. He drew up his men on a gentle ascent, and divided them into three lines. The first was commanded by the young prince of Wales; the second was conducted by the earls of Nordhampton and Arundel; and the third kept as a body of reserve, was headed by the king in person. On the other side, Philip impelled by resentment, and con fident of his numbers, was more solicitous in bringing the enemy to an engagement, than prudent in taking measures for its success. He led on his army in three bodies, opposite those of the English. The first line consisted of fifteen thousand Genoese cross-bow men x) ; the second body was led by the king of France's brother ; and he himself was at the head of the third. About three in the afternoon, the famous battle of Crecy began by the French king's ordering the Genoese archers to charge; but they were so fatigued with their march, that they cried out for a little rest before they should engage. The Count Alencon being informed of their petition , rode up and revded them as cowards, commanding them to begin their onset without delay. Their reluctance to begin was still more in creased by a heavy shower, which fell that instant, and re laxed their bow- strings; so that the discharge they made produced but very httle effect. On the other hand, the English archers, who had kept their bows in cases, and were favoured by a 1) Genuesische Armbrustschutzen."], [73, "59 sudden gleam of sunshine, that rather dazzled the enemy, let fly their arrows so thick, and with such good aim, that noth- ing was to be seen among the Genoese but hurry, terror, and dismay. The young prince of Wales had presence of mind to take advantage of them confusion, and to lead on his line to the charge. The French cavalry, however, commanded by the count Alencon, wheeling round, sustained the combat, and began to hem the English in. The Earls of Arundel and Northampton now came to assist the prince, who appeared fore- most in the very shock; and whereever he appeared turned the fortune of the day. The thickest of the battle was now gathered around him, and the valour of a boy filled even vet- erans with astonishment; but their surprise at his courage coidd not give way to their fears for his safety. Being appre-. hensive that some mischance might happen to him in the end, an officer was dispatched to the king, desiring that succours might be sent to the prince's relief. Edward, who had all this time with great tranquility viewed the engagement from a wind- mill, demanded, with seeming deliberation, if his son were dead, but being answered that he still lived, and was giving aston- ishing instances of his valour; \u201eThen tell my generals, (cried the king,) that he shad have no assistance from me; the hon- our of the day shall be his ; let him shew himself worthy the professions of arms, and let him be indebted to his own merit alone for victory.\" This speech, being reported to the prince .and his attendants, inspired them with new courage; they made a fresh attack upon the French , cavalry, and coimt Alengon, them bravest commander, was slain. This was the beginning of their total overthrow ; the French, being now with- out a competent leader, were thrown into confusion; the whole army took to flight , and were put to the sword by the persuers without mercy, till night stopped the carnage. Never was a victory more seasonable, or less bloody to the English than this. Notwithstanding the great slaughter of the enemy, the conquerors lost but one squire, three knights, and a few of in- ferior rank. But this victory was attended with still more substantial advantages; for Edward, as moderate in conquest, as prudent in his methods to obtain it, resolved to secure an easy entrance"], [74, "60 into France for the future. With this view he laid siege to Calais, that then was defended by John de Vienne, an expe rienced commander, and supplied with every thing necessary for defence. These operations, though slow, were at length successful. It was in vain that the governor made a noble defence, that he excluded aU the useless mouths from the city, which Edward generously permitted to pass. Edward re solved to reduce it by famine, and it was at length taken, after a twelve month's siege, the defenders having been reduced to the last extremity. He resolved to punish the obstinacy of the townsmen, by the death of six of the most considerable citizens, who offered themselves, with ropes round their necks, to satiate the indignation; but he spared their lives, at the in tercession of the queen. Whde Edward was reaping victories upon the Continent, the Scots, ever wflling to embrace a favourable opportunity of rapine and revenge, invaded the frontiers with a numerous army, headed by David Bruce, their king. This unexpected invasion, at such a juncture, alarmed the English, but was not capable of intimidating them. Lionel, Edward's son, who was left guardian of England during his father's absence, was yet too young to take upon him the command of an army; but the victories on the Continent seemed to inspire even women with valour. Phdippa, Edward's queen, took upon her the con duct of the field, and prepared to repulse the enemy in per son. Accordingly, having made lord Percy general under her, she met the Scots at a place caded Nevil's Cross, near Durham, and offered them battle. The Scots king was no less impatient to engage; he imagined that he might obtain an easy victory against undisciplined troops, and headed by a woman. But he was miserably deceived. His army was quickly routed, and driven from the field. Fifteen thousand of his men were cut to pieces; and he himself, with many of his nobles and knights, were taken prisoners, and carried in triumph to London. A victory gained by the Black Prince near Poictiers follow ed not long after, in which John, king of France, was taken prisoner, and led in triumph through London, amidst an ama zing concourse of spectators. Two kings, prisoners in the same court, and at the same time, were considered as glorious achieve-"], [75, "61 ments; but all that England gained by them was only glory. Whatever was won in France, with all the dangers of war, and the expense of preparation, was successively, and, in a manner, silently lost, without the mortification of a defeat. The English, by their frequent supplies, had been quite exhausted, and were unable to continue an army in the field. Charles, who had succeeded his father John, who died in a prison in Savoy, on the other hand, cautiously forbore coming to any decisive engagement ; but was contented to let his ene mies waste their strength in attempts to plunder a fortified country when they were tired, he then was sure to sally forth, and possess himself of such places as they were not strong enough to defend. He first fell upon Ponthieu; the citizens of Abbe ville opened them gates to him; those of St. Valois, Rue, and Crotoy, imitated the example; and the whole country was, in a little time, reduced to total submission. The southern pro vinces were, in the same manner, invaded by his generals with equal success; while the Black Prince, destitute of supplies from England, and wasted by a cruel and consumptive dis order, was obliged to return to his native country, leaving the affairs of the south of France in a most desperate condition. But what of aU other things served to darken the latter part of this splendid reign, was the approaching death of the Black Prince, whose constitution shewed but too manifestly the symptoms of a speedy dissolution. This valiant and accom plished prince died in the forty-sixth year of his age, leaving be hind him a character without a single blemish; and a degree of sorrow among the people, that time could scarcely alleviate. The king was most sensibly affected by the loss of his son ; and tried every art to aUay his uneasiness. He removed him self entirely from the duties and burdens of the state, and left his kingdom to be plundered by a set of rapacious ministers. He did not survive the consequences of his bad conduct; but died about a year after the prince, at Sherne, in Surry, desert ed by all his courtiers, even by those who had grown rich by his bounty. He expired in the sixty-fifth year of his age, and fifty-first of his reign, 1377; a prince more admired than be loved by his subjects, and more an object of their applause than their sorrow."], [76, "62 It was in this reign that the order of the Garter1) was instituted ; the number was to consist of twenty - four persons, besides the king. A story prevails, that the countess of Salis burg, at a ball, happening to drop her garter, the king took it up, and presented it to her with these words, \u201eHonni soit qui mal y pense;\" \u2014 Evil be to him that evfl thinks. This acci dent, it is said, gave rise to the order and the motto. Edward left many children by his queen Philippa of Hai nault; his eldest son, the Black Prince, died before him, but he left a son named Richard, who succeeded to the throne. Wat Tyler. Richard II was but eleven years old when he came to the throne of his grandfather, and found the people discontented and poor, the nobles proud and rebellious. As he was a mi nor, the government was vested in the hands of his three uncles, the dukes of Lancaster, York, and Gloucester: and as the late king had left the kingdom involved in many dangerous and expensive wars, which demanded large and constant supplies, the murmurs of the people increased in proportion. The ex penses of armaments to face the enemy on every side, and a want of economy in the administration, entirely exhausted the treasury; and a new tax of three groats2) on every person above fifteen, was granted by parliament as a supply. The indignation of the people had been for some time increasing; but a tax so inequitable, in which the rich paid no more than the poor, kindled the resentment of the latter into a flame. It began in Essex, where a report was industriously spread, that the peasants were to be destroyed, their houses burned. and their farms plundered. A blacksmith, well known by the name of Wat Tyler, was the first that excited them to arms. The tax-gatherers, coming to this man's house while he was at work, demanded payment for his daughter; which he refu sed, alleging she was under the age mentioned in the act. One of the codectors insisted on her being a full grown woman ; and 1) Hosenbandorden ; a knight of the order of the Garter is the first personal dignity of the nobility. 2) A groat = four-pence; the coin is not now current."], [77, "63 treated her in a brutal manner. This provoked the father to such a degree, that he instantly struck him dead with a blow of his hammer. The standers-by applauded his spirit, and, one and all, resolved to defend his conduct. He was considered as a champion in the cause, and appointed the leader and spokes man of the people. It is easy to imagine the disorders com mitted by this tumultuous rabble; the whole neighbourhood rose in arms; they burnt and plundered wherever they came, and revenged upon their former masters ad those insults which they had long sustained with impunity. As the discontent was general, the insurgents increased in proportion as they approach ed the capital. The flame soon propagated itself into Kent, Hertfordshire, Surrey, Sussex, Suffolk, Norfolk, Cambridge, and Lincoln. They were found to amount to above a hundred thousand men by the time they were arrived at Blackheath. At the head of one party of these was Wat Tyler, who led his men into Smithfield, where he was met by the king, who invited him to a conference, under pretence of hearing and redressing his grievances. Tyler ordering his companions to retire, tdl he should give them a signal, boldly ventured to meet the king in the midst of his retinue, and accordingly began the conference. He required that all slaves should be set free ; that ad commonages J) should be open to the poor as well as rich; and that a general pardon should be passed for the late outrages. Whilst he made these demands, he now and then lifted up his sword in a menacing manner; which insolence so raised the indignation of WiUiam Walworth , then mayor 2) of London, attending on the king, that, without considering the danger to which he exposed his majesty, he stunned Tyler with a blow of his mace 3) ; while one of the king's knights, riding up, dispatched him with his sword. The mutineers, seeing them leader fad, prepared themselves to take revenge; and their bows were now bent for execution, when Richard, though not yet quite sixteen years of age, rode up to the rebels, 1) Gemeinderechte. 2) Biirgermeister ; the chief magistrate of a corporation, who, in London, York, and Dublin, is called Lord Mayor. 3) Keule , Scepter ; originally a club ; at present , an ensign of au thority carried before magistrates."], [78, "64 and, with admirable presence of mind, cried out, \u201eWhat, my people, wdl you then kill your king? Be not concerned for the loss of your leader ; I myself will now be your general ; follow me into the fields, and you shad have whatever you desire.\" The awed multitude immediately desisted; they foUowed the king as if mechanically into the fields, and there he grant ed them the same charter that he had before given to their companions, but which he soon after revoked in parliament. The House of Lancaster. Hitherto Richard had acted under the control of the re gency, who did all they could devise to abridge his power; however, in an extraordinary council of the nobility, assembled after Easter, he, to the astonishment of all present, desired to know his age; and being told that he was turned of1) two and-twenty, he adeged, that it was time then for him to govern without help; and that there was no reason that he should be deprived of those rights which the meanest of his subjects enjoyed. Being thus set at liberty to conduct the business of gov ernment at discretion, it quickly appeared that he wanted those arts that are usuafly found to procure a lasting respect; he was fond of luxurious pleasures, and idle ostentation; he admitted the meanest ranks to his familiarity; and his conver sation was not adapted to impress them with a reverence for his morals or abilities. The cruelty showr> to the duke of Gloucester, who, upon slight suspicion, was s at to confinement in Calais, and there murdered in prison, with some other acts equady arbitrary, did not fad to increase those animosities which had already taken deep root in the kingdom. The agran disement of some new favourites contributed stdl more to make the king odious; but though he seemed resolved, by ad his actions, to set his subjects against him, it was accident that gave the occasion for his overthrow. The earl of Hereford appeared in parliament, and accused de duke of Nordfblk of having spoken seditious words against his majesty in a private 1) To turn of \u2014 heraustreten aus -\u2014"], [79, "65 conversation. Norfolk denied the charge, gave Hereford the lie, and offered to prove his innocence by single combat. As proofs were wanting for legal trial, the lords readily acquiesced in that mode of determination ; the time and place were ap pointed; and the whole nation waited with anxious suspense for the event. At length, the day arrived on which this duel was to be fought, and the champions having just begun their career, the king stopped the combat, and ordered both the com batants to leave the kingdom. The duke of Norfolk he banished for life, but the earl of Hereford only for ten years. Thus the one was condemned to exile without being charged with any offence, and the other without being convicted of any crime. The duke of Norfolk was overwhelmed with grief and despondency at the judgment awarded against him; he retired to Venice, where, in a little time after, he died of a broken heart. Hereford's behaviour on this occasion was resigned and sub missive, which so pleased the king, that he consented to shorten the date of his banishment four years ; and he also granted him letters patent, ensuring him the enjoyment of any inheritance which should fall to him during his absense ; but upon the death of his father, the duke of Lancaster, which happened shortly after, Richard revoked those letters, and retained the possession of the Lancaster estate to himself. Such complicated injuries served to inflame the resentment of Hereford against the king; and although he had hitherto concealed it, he now set no bounds to his indignation, but even conceived a desire of dethroning a person who had shown himself so unworthy of power. Indeed, no man could be better qualified for an enterprise of this nature than earl of Here ford; he was cool, cautious, discerning, and resolute. He had served with distinction against the infidels of Lithuania l) ; and had thus joined to his other merits those of piety and valour. He was stimulated by private injuries; and had adiances and fortune sufficient to give weight to his measures. He only waited the absence of the king from England to put his schemes into execution; and Richard's going over into Ireland to qued an insurrection there, was an opportunity he had long looked for. 1) Lithauen. 5,"], [80, "66 Accordingly, he instantly embarked at Nantz, with a re tinue of sixty persons, in three smad vessels, and landed at Ravenspur, in Yorkshire. The earl of Northumberland, who had long been a malcontent, together with Henry Percy, his son, who, from his ardent valour, was surnamed Hotspur, immediate ly joined him with their forces. After, this junction, the con course of people coming to list under his banner was so great, that in a few days his army amounted to threescore thou sand men. While these things, were transacting in England, Richard continued in Ireland in perfect security. Contrary winds, for three weeks together, prevented his receiving any news of the rebellion which was begun in his native dominions; wherefore, upon landing at Mdford-haven, with a body of twenty thousand men, he saw himself in a dreadful situation, in the midst of an enraged people, without any friend on whom to rely; and forsaken by those, who, in the sun-shine of his power, had only contributed to fan his follies. His little army gradually began to desert him, till at last he found that he had not above six thousand men, who fodowed his standard. Thus, not know ing whom to trust, or where to turn, he saw no other hopes of safety but to throw himself upon the generosity of his enemy, and to gain from pity what he could not obtain by arms. He therefore sent Hereford word, that he was ready to submit to whatever terms he thought proper to prescribe, and that he earnestly desired a conference. For this purpose the earl ap pointed him to meet at a castle within about ten miles of Chester, where he came the next day with his army. Richard, who the day before had been brought thither by the earl of Northumberland, descrying his rival's- approach from the wads, went down to receive him; while Hereford, after some cere mony, entered the castle in complete armour; only his head was bare, in compliment to the faden king. Richard received him with that open air for which he had been remarkable, and kindly bade him welcome. \u201eMy lord the king (returned the earl, with a cool respectful bow), I am come sooner than you appointed, because your people say, that for one-and- twenty years, you have governed with rigour and indiscretion. They are very ill-satisfied with your conduct; but, if it please God,"], [81, "67 I wdl help you to govern them better for the time to come.\" \u2014 To this declaration the king made no other answer, but \u2014 \u201eFair cousin, since it pleases you, it pleases us likewise.\" But Hereford's haughty answer was not the only morti fication the unfortunate Richard was to endure. After a short conversation with some of the king's attendants, Hereford or dered the king's horses to be brought out of the stable; and two wretched animals being produced, Richard was placed upon one, and his favourite, the earl of Salisbury, upon the other. In this mean equipage they rode to Chester; and were conveyed to the castle with a great noise of trumpets, and through a vast concourse of people, who were no way moved at the sight. In this manner he was led triumphantly along from* town to town, amidst multitudes, who scoffed at him, and extolled his rival. Long live the good duke of Lancaster, our deliverer ! was the general cry ; but as for the king, to use the pathetic words of the poet, \u201eNone cried, God bless him.\" Thus after repeated indignities, he was confined a close prisoner in the Tower ; there, if possible, to undergo a still greater variety of studied insolence, and flagrant contempt. The wretched monarch, humbled in this manner, began to lose the pride of a king with the splendours of royalty, and his spirit sunk to his circumstances. There was no great difficulty, therefore, in inducing him to sign a deed, by which he renounced his crown, as being unqualified for governing the kingdom. Upon this resignation, Hereford founded his principal claim; but willing to fortify his pretensions with every appearance of justice, he caded a parliament, which was readdy brought to approve and confirm his claims. A frivolous charge of thirty-three articles was drawn up, and found vadd against the king; upon which he was solemnly deposed, and the earl of Hereford elected in his stead, by the title of Henry the Fourth. Thus began the contest between the houses of York and Lancaster ; which, for many years after, deluged the kingdom with blood; and yet, in the end, contributed to settle and confirm the constitution. When Richard was deposed, the earl of Northumberland made a motion in the house of peers 1), demanding the advice 1) In the house of Lords, Oberhaus; a peer ein Pair, a member of the upper house of parliament, so called because men of distinguished 5*"], [82, "68 of parliament with regard to the future treatment of the depo sed king. To this they replied, that he should be imprisoned in some secure place, where his friends and partizans should not be able to find him. This was accordingly put in practice, but while he still continued alive, the usurper could not remain in safety. Indeed, some conspiracies and commotions, which fodowed soon after, induced Henry to wish for Richard's death; in consequence of which, one of those assassins that are found in every court, ready to commit the most horrid crimes for reward, went down to the place of this unfortunate monarch's confinement, in the castle of Pomfret, and, with eight of his followers, rushed into his apartment. The king, concluding their design was to take away his life, resolved not to fad unrevenged, but to sed it as dearly as he could; wherefore, wresting a pole-axe x) from one of the murderers, he soon laid four of their number dead at his feet. But he was at length overpowered, and struck dead by the blow of a pole-axe; although some assert that he was starved in prison. Thus died the unfortunate Richard, in the thirty-fourth year of his age, and the twenty-third of his reign. Though his conduct was blamable, yet the punishment he suffered was greater than his offences ; and in the end his suf ferings made more converts to his family and cause, than even his most meritorious actions could have procured them. He left no posterity, either legitimate or otherwise. Henry soon found that the throne of a usurper is but a bed of thorns. Such violent animosities broke out among the barons in the first session of his parliament, that forty challen ges were given and received, and forty gauntlets were thrown down as pledges of the sincerity of their resentment. But though these commotions were seemingly suppressed by his moderation for that time, yet one conspiracy broke out after another, and was detected in the formation, or actuady pun ished in the field. That formed against him by the earl of Northumberland was the most formidable. It was in a skirmish between the birth were alone considered fit companions for the king (peer = equal, companion). i 1) Streitaxt. %."], [83, "69 Scots and the English , that Archibald , earl of Douglas , with many of the Scots nobility, were taken prisoners by the earl of Northumberland, and carried to Alnwick castle. When Henry received intelligence of this victory, he sent the earl orders not to ransom his prisoners, as he intended to detain them, in order to increase his demands in making peace with Scotland. This message was highly resented by the earl of Northumber land, who, by the laws of war that prevailed in that age, had a right to the ransom of all such as he had taken in battle. The command was stdl more irksome, as he considered the king as his debtor both for security and his crown. Accord ingly, stung with this supposed injury, he resolved to overturn a throne, which he had the chief hand in establishing. A scheme was laid, in which the Scots and Welsh were to unite their forces, and to assist Northumberland in elevating Mortimer, as the true heir to the crown of England. When ad things were prepared for the intended insurrection, the earl had the morti fication to find himself unable to lead on the troops, being seized with a sudden dlness at Berwick. But the want of his presence was well supplied by his son Henry Percy, surnamed Hotspur, who took the command of the troops, and marched them towards Shrewsbury, in order to join his forces with those of Glendower, a Welsh chieftain, who some time before had been exchanged from prison, and had now advanced with his forces as far as Shropshire. Upon the junction of these two armies, they published a manifesto, which aggravated their real grievances, and invented more. In the mean time, Henry, who had received no intelligence of their designs, was at first greatly surprised at the news of this rebellion. But fortune seemed to befriend him on this occasion; he had a small army in readiness, which he intended against the Scots, and knowing the importance of dispatch against such active enemies, he in stantly hurried down to Shrewsbury, that he might give the rebels battle. Upon the approach of the two armies, both sides seemed willing to give a colour to their cause, by shewing a desire of reconciliation; but when they came to open their mutual de mands, the treaty was turned into abuse and recrimination. On one side was objected rebedion and ingratitude; on the"], [84, "70 other, tyranny and usurpation. The two armies were pretty nearly equal, each consisting of above twelve thousand men; the animosity on both sides was inflamed to the highest pitch; and no prudence or mditary skid could determine on which side the victory might incline. Accordingly, a very bloody engagement ensued, in which the generals on both sides exerted themselves with great bravery. Henry was seen everywhere in the thickest of the fight; whde his valiant son, who was afterwards the renowned conqueror of France, fought by his side; and though wounded in the face by an arrow, stdl kept the field, and performed astonishing acts of valour. On the other side the daring Hotspur supported that renown which he had acquired in so many bloody engagements, and everywhere sought out the king as a noble object of indignation. At last, however, his death, from an unknown hand, decided the victory; and the fortune of Henry once more prevailed. On that bloody day, it is said that no less than two thousand three hundred gentlemen were slain, and about six hundred private men, of whom two thirds were of' Hotspur's army. Whde this furious transaction was going forward, North umberland, who had lately recovered from his indisposition, was advancing with a body of troops to reinforce the army of malcontents, and take upon him the command. But hearing by the way of his son's and brother's misfortune, he dismissed his troops, not daring to keep the field with so small a force, before an army superior in number, and flushed with recent victory. The earl, therefore, for a whde, attempted to find safety by flight ; but at last, being pressed by his pursuers, and finding himself totaUy without resource, he chose rather to throw him self upon the king's mercy, than lead a precarious and indigent fife in exile. Upon his appearing before Henry at York, he pretended that his sole intention in arming was to mediate between the two parties; and this, though but a very weak apology, seemed to satisfy the king. Northumberland, there fore, received a pardon; Henry probably thinking that he was sufficiently punished by the loss of his army, and the death of his favourite son. By these means, Henry seemed to surmount all his trou bles; and the calm which was thus produced, was employed"], [85, "71 by him in endeavours to acquire popularity, which he had lost by the severities exercised during the preceding part of his reign. For that reason, he often permitted the house of com mons to assume powers which had not been usuady exercised by their predecessors. In the sixth year of his reign, when they voted him the supplies, they appointed treasurers of their own, to see the money disbursed for the purposes intended; and required them to deliver in their accounts to the house. They proposed thirty very important articles for the govern ment of the king's household ; and, on the whole, preserved their privileges and freedom more entire during his reign than any of his predecessors. But whde the king thus laboured, not without success, to retrieve the reputation he had lost, his son Henry, prince of Wales, seemed equally bent on incurring the pubdc aversion. He became notorious for ad kinds of de bauchery, and ever chose to be surrounded by a set of wretch^ es, who took pride in committing the most illegal acts with the prince at their head. The king was not a little mortified at this degeneracy in his eldest son, who seemed entirely forget ful of his station, although he had already exhibited repeated proofs of his valour, conduct, and generosity. Such were the excesses into which he ran, that one of his dissolute compan ions having been brought to trial before Sir William Gas coigne, chief justice of the King's Bench x), for some misdemea nor 2), the prince was so exasperated at the issue of the trial, that he struck the judge in open court. The venerable magis trate, who knew the reverence that was due to his station, behaved with a dignity that became his office, and immediately ordered the prince to be committed to prison. When this transaction was reported to the king, who was an excedent judge of mankind, he could not help exclaiming in a transport: \u201eHappy is the king that has a magistrate endowed with courage to execute the laws upon such an offender; stdl more happy in having a son wdling to submit to such a chastisement!\" This, in fact, is one of the first great instances we read in the English history of a magistrate doing justice in opposition to 1) President des Oberhofgerichts. 2) Misdemeanor, Vergehen; an offence less atrocious than a crime."], [86, "72 power; since, upon many former occasions, we find the judges only ministers of royal caprice. Henry, whose health had for some time been declining, did not long outlive his transaction, he was subject to fits, which bereaved him, for the time, of his senses; and which at last brought on his death, at Westminster, in the forty- sixth year of his age, and the fourteenth of his reign. The Battle of Agincourt. The first steps taken by the young king confirmed all the prepossessions entertained in his favour. He caded to gether his former abandoned companions ; acquainted them with his intended reformation; exhorted them to follow his example; and thus dismissed them from his presence, allowing them a competency to subsist upon, till he saw them worthy of further promotion. The faithful ministers of his father, at first, began to- tremble for their former justice in the administration of their duty; but he soon eased them of their fears, by tak ing them into his friendship and confidence. Sir Wdliam Gas coigne, who thought himself the most obnoxious, met with praise instead of reproaches, and was exhortecb to persevere in the same rigorous and impartial execution of justice. About this time the heresy of Wickliffe , or Lollardism r), as it was called, began to spread every day more and more, whde it received a new lustre from the protection and preach ing of Sir John Oldcastle, baron of Cobham, who had been one of the king's domestics, and stood high in his favour. The primate, however, indicted 2) this nobleman , and , with the as sistance of his suffragans, condemned him, as a heretic, to be burnt alive. Cobham , however , escaped from the Tower , in which he was confined; the day before his exe'cution, privately went among his party, and stimulating their zeal, led them up to London, to take a signal revenge on his enemies. But the 1) A Lollard is one of the followers of.

Cobham himself found means of escaping for that time, but he was taken about four years after; and never did the cruelty of man invent, or crimes draw down, such torments as he was made to endure. He was hung up with a chain by the middle; and thus at slow fire burned, or rather roasted, alive. Henry, to turn the minds of the people from such hideous scenes, resolved to take advantage of the troubles in which France was at that time engaged ; and assembling a great fleet and army at Southampton, landed at Harfleur, at the head of an army of six thousand men at arms, and twenty-four thou sand foot, mostly archers. But although the enemy made but a feeble resistance, yet the climate seemed to fight against the English; a contagious dysentery carrying off three parts of Henry's army. The Eng lish monarch, when it was too late, began to repent of his rash inroad into a country, where disease and a powerful army everywhere threatened destruction ; he therefore began to think of retiring into Calais. The enemy, however, resolved to intercept his retreat ; and after he had passed the small river of Tertois at Blangi, he was surprised to observe from the heights, the whole French army drawn up in the plains of Agincourt; and so posted, that it was impossible for him to proceed on his march without coming to an engagement. No situation could be more unfa vourable than that in which he found himself. His army was wasted with desease; the soldier's spirits worn down with fa tigue, destitute of provisions , and discouraged by their retreat. Their whole body amounted to but nine thousand men; and these were to sustain the shock of an enemy near ten times their number, headed by expert generals, and plentifully sup plied with provisions. As the enemy were so much superior, he drew up his army on a narrow ground between two woods, which guarded each flank; and he patiently expected, in that"], [88, "74 position , the attack of the enemy. The constable J) of France was at the head of one army; and Henry himself, with Ed ward duke of York, commanded the other. For a time bosh armies, as if afraid to begin, kept sdently gazing at each other, neither willing to break their ranks by making the onset; which Henry perceiving, with a cheerful countenance cried out, \u201eMy friends, since they wid not begin, it is ours to set them the example; come on, and the Blessed Trinity be our protec tion.\" Upon this, the whole army set forward with a shout, whde the French stdl waited their approach with intrepidity. The English archers, who had long been famous for their great skid, first let fly a shower of arrows, three feet long, which did great execution. The French cavalry advancing to repel these, two hundred bowmen, who lay till then concealed, rising on a sudden, let fly among them, and produced such a confusion, that the archers threw by their arrows, and rushing in, fed upon them sword in hand. The French at first repulsed the assadants, who were enfeebled by disease ; but they won made up the defect by their valour; and resolving to conquer or die, burst in upon the enemy with such impetuosity, that the French were soon obliged to give way. They were overthrown in every part of the field; their numbers being crowded into a very narrow space, were inca pable of either flying or making any defence: so that they covered the ground with heads of slain. After all appearance of opposition was over, there was heard an alarm from behind, which proceeded from a number of peasants, who had faden upon the English baggage, and were putting those who guard ed it to the sword. Henry, now seeing the enemy of all sides of him, began to entertain apprehensions from his prisoners, the number of whom exceeded even that of his army. He thought it necessary, therefore, to issue general orders for putting them to death; but, on the discovery of the certainty of his victory, he stopped the slaughter, and was stdl able to save a great number. This severity tarnished the glory which his victory would otherwise have acquired ; but all the heroism of that 1) Der conne'table vonFrankreich; constable (comes stabuli), origin ally , a master of the horse , or commander of cavalry ; then applied to other officers of high rank."], [89, "75 age is tinctured with barbarity. In this battle the French lost ten thousand men, and fourteen thousand prisoners: the Eng lish only forty men in ad. Joan of Arc France was at that time in a wretched situation ; the whole kingdom appeared as one vast theatre of crimes, murders, in justice, and devastation. The duke of Orleans was assassina ted by the duke of Burgundy, and the duke of Burgundy, in his turn, fell by the treachery of the dauphin. A state of imbecility into which Charles had faden, made him passive in every transaction; and Henry, at last, by con quest and negotiation, caused himself to be elected heir to the crown. The principal articles of his treaty were , that Henry should espouse the princess Catherine, daughter to the king of France; that king Charles should enjoy the title and dignity for life, but that Henry should be declared heir to the crown, and should be entrusted with the present administration of the government ; that France and England should for ever be uni ted under one king, but should still retain their respective laws and privileges. In consequence of this, while Henry was everywhere vic torious, he fixed his residence at Paris ; and, while Charles had but a small court, he was attended with a very magnificent one. On Whit - Sunday the two kings and their two queens, with crowns on their heads, dined together in public; Charles receiving apparent homage, but Henry commanding with ab solute authority. Henry, at that time, when his glory had nearly reached its summit and both crowns were just devolved upon him, was seized with a fistula; a disorder, which, from the unskdfulness of the physicians of the times, soon became mortal. He ex pired with the same intrepidity with which he had dved, in the thirty-fourth year of his age, and the tenth of his reign. The duke of Bedford, one of the most accomplished prin ces of the age, and equady experienced both in the cabinet and the field, was appointed by parliament protector of England, defender of the church, and first counsedor to the king, during the minority, as he was not a year old; and as France was"], [90, "76 the great object that engrossed all consideration, he attempted to exert the efforts of the nation upon the Continent with ad his vigour. A new revolution was produced in that kingdom, by means apparently the most unlikely to be attended with success. In the vidage of Domremi , near Vaucouleurs , on the bor ders of Lorrain, there lived a country girl, about twenty-seven years of age, called Joan of Arc. This girl had been a servant at a small inn; and in that humble station had submitted to those hardy employments which fit the body for the fatigues of war. She was of an irreproachable life, and had hitherto testified none of those enterprising quahties which displayed themselves soon after. Her mind, however, brooding with mel ancholy stedfastness upon the miserable situation of her country, began to feel several impulses which she was willing to mis take for the inspiration of Heaven. Convinced of the reality of her own admonitions, she had recourse to one Baudricourt, governor of Vaucouleurs, and informed him of her destination by Heaven to free her native country from its fierce invaders. Baudricourt treated her at first with some neglect; but her importunities at length prevailed ; and wdling to make a trial of her pretensions, he gave her some attendants, who conducted her to the French court, which at that time resided at Chinon. The French court, to support their declining fortunes, easdy believed that Joan was actually inspired; she was able to dis cover the king among the number of his corn-tiers, although he had laid aside ad the distinctions of his authority; she had told him some secrets, which were only known to himself; and she had demanded and minutely described a sword in the Church of St. Catherine de Fierbois, which she had never seen. By these miracles the minds of the vulgar being prepared for her appearance, she was armed cap-a-pee '), mounted on a char ger, and shewn in that martial dress to the people. She was then brought before the doctors of the university, who declared that she had actually received her commission from above. When the preparations for her mission were completely blazoned, their oiext aim was to send her against the enemy. 1) Vom Kopf bis aus die Fiisse."], [91, "77 The English were at that time besieging the city of Orleans, the last resource of Charles, and every thing promised them a speedy surrender. Joan undertook to raise the siege ; and to render herself stid more remarkable, girded herself with the miraculous sword, of which she had before such extraordinary notices. Thus equipped, she ordered all the soldiers to confess themselves I) before they set out ; she displayed in her hand a consecrated banner, and assured the troops of certain suc cess. Such confidence on her side soon raised the spirits of the French army ; and evem the English, who pretended to des pise her efforts, felt themselves secretely influenced with the terrors of her mission, and, relaxing in their endeavours, the siege was raised with great precipitation. From being attacked, the French now in turn became the aggressors. One victory followed another, and at length the French king was solemnly crowned at Rheims, which was what Joan had promised should come to pass. A tide of success followed the performance of this solem nity ; but Joan having thrown herself with a body of troops into the city of Compiegne, that was then besieging by the duke of Burgundy, she was taken prisoner in a sady which she headed against the enemy, the governor shutting the gates behind. The duke of Bedford was no sooner informed of her being taken, than he purchased her of the count Vendome, who had made her his prisoner, and ordered her to be committed to close confinement. As Joan, but a little before, from her successes, was regarded as a saint, she was now, upon her captivity, con sidered as a sorceress , forsaken by the demon who had granted her a fallacious and temporary assistance; and accordingly, being tried at Rouen, she was found .guilty of heresy and witch craft, and sentenced to be burnt adve, which was executed ac cordingly. From this period the English affairs became totally irre trievable. The city of Paris returned once more to a sense of its duty. Thus ground was continually, though slowly, gained by the French; and in the lapse of a few years, Calais alone 1) Zu beichten."], [92, "78 remained of all the conquests that had been made in France, and this was but a small compensation for the blood and trea sure which had been lavished in that country, and which only served to gratify ambition with transient applause. The War between the Roses. In this period of calamity, a new interest was revived, which had lain dormant in the times of prosperity and triumph. Richard, duke of York , was descended , by the mother's side, from Lionel, one of the sons of Edward the Third; whereas the reigning king was descended from John of Gaun, a young er son of the same monarch ; Richard, therefore, stood plainly in succession before Henry ; and he began to think the weak ness and unpopularity of the present reign a favourable moment for ambition. The ensign of Richard was a white rose, that of Henry a red ; and this gave name to the two factions, whose ani mosity was now about to drench the kingdom with slaughter. Among the number of complaints which the unpopularity of the government gave rise to, there were some which even ex- cited insurrection; particularly that headed by John Cade, which was of the most dangerous nature. This man was a native of Ireland, who had been obliged to fly over to France for his crimes; but seing the people, upon his return, prepared for violent measures, he assumed the name of Mortimer; and, at the head of twenty thousand Kentish men, advanced towards the capital, and encamped at Blackheath. The king being in- formed of this commotion, sent a message to demand the cause of their assembling in arms; and Cade, in the name of the community, answered that their only aim was to punish evil ministers, and procure a redress of grievances for the people. But committing some \u00abbuaes , and engaging with the citizens, he was abandoned by most of his fodowers; and retreating to Rochester, was ,obdged to fly alone into the woods of Kent, where a price being set upon his head, by proclamation, he was discovered and slain. In the mean time, the duke of York secretly fomented these disturbances, and pretending to espouse the cause of the people, stdl secretly aspired at the crown; and though he wished nothing so ardently, yet he was for some time prevented by his"], [93, "79 own scruples from seizing it. What his intrigues faded to bring about, accident produced to his desire. The king falling into a distemper, which so far increased his natural imbecility that it even rendered him incapable of maintaining the appearance of royalty, York was appointed lieutenant and protector of the kingdom, with power to hold and open parliaments at pleasure. Being thus invested with a plenitude of power, he contin ued in the enjoyment of it for some time ; but at length the unhappy king recovered from his lethargic complaint, as if waking from a dream, perceived with surprise, that he was stripped of ad his authority. Henry was married to Margaret of Anjou, a woman of masculine understanding, who obdged him to take the field, and in a manner dragged him to it, where both sides came to an engagement, in which the York ists 1) gained a complete victory. The king himself being wounded, and taking shelter in a cottage, near the field of battle, was taken prisoner, and treated by the victor with great re spect and tenderness. Henry was now but a prisoner, treated with the splendid forms of royalty ; yet, indolent and sickly, he seemed pleased with his situation, and did not regret that power which was not to be exer cised without fatigue. But Margaret once more induced him to as sert his prerogative. The contending parties met at Bloreheath, on the borders of Staffordshire, and the Yorkists gained some advantages; but Sir Andrew Trollop, who commanded a body of veterans for the duke of York, deserted with all his men to the king ; and this so intimidated the whole army of the York ists, that they separated the next day, without striking a single blow. Several other engagements fodowed, with various suc cess ; Margaret being at one time victorious, at another in exile ; the victory upon Wakefield-Green, in which the duke of York was slain, seemed to fix her good fortune. But the earl of Warwick, who now put himself at the head of the Yorkists, was one of the most celebrated generals of his age; formed for times of trouble, extremely artful, and in contestably brave, equally skdful in councd and in field, and 1) A Yorkist, one who sided with Eichard of York; opp. to a Lan castrian."], [94, "80 inspired with a degree of hatred against the queen that nothing could suppress. He commanded an army in which he led about the captive king to give a sanction to his attempts. Upon the approach of the Lancastrians', he conducted his for ces, strengthened by a body of Londoners, who were very af fectionate to his cause, and gave battle to the queen at St. Al bans. In this, however, he was defeated. Above two thousand of the Yorkists perished in the battle, and the person of the king again fell into the hands of his own party, to Be treated with apparent respect, but real contempt. In the mean time, young Edward, the eldest son of the late duke of York, began to repair the losses his party had lately sustained, and to give spirit to the Yorkists. This prince , in the bloom of youth , remarkable for the beauty of his person, his bravery, and popular deportment, advanced to wards London with the remainder of Warwick's army; and obliging Margaret to retire, entered the city amidst the ac clamations of the people. Perceiving his own popularity, he supposed that now was the time to lay his claim to the crown ; and his friend Warwick, assembling the citizens in St. John's fields , pronounced an harangue , setting forth the tide of Ed ward, and inveighing against the tyranny and usurpation of the house of Lancaster. Both sides at length met near Towton, in the county of York , to decide the fate of the empire , and never was England depopulated by so terrible an engagement. It was a dreadful sight to behold a hundred thousand men of the same country engaged against each other; and all to sat isfy the empty ambition of the weakest, or the worst of man kind. While the army of Edward was advancing to the charge, there happened a great fad of snow; which driving fud in the faces of the enemy, blinded them ; and this advantage, seconded by an impetuous onset, decided the victory in their favour. Edward issued orders to give no quarter; and a bloody slaughter ensued, in which near forty thousand of the Lancastrians were slain. The weak unfortunate Henry, always imprudent, and al ways unsuccessful, was taken prisoner, carried to London with ignominy, and confined in the Tower. Margaret was rather more fortunate; she contrived to escape out of the kingdom, and took refuge with her father in Flanders. Edward being"], [95, "81 now, by means of the earl of Warwick, fixed upon the throne, reigned in peace and security; while his title was recognized by parliament, and universally submitted to by the people. He began, therefore, to give a loose to his favourite passions, and a spirit of gallantry, mixed with cruelty, was seen to prevail in his court. In the very same palace, which one day exhib ited a spectacle of horror, was to be seen the day fodowing a mask or a pageant ; and the king would at once gallant J) a mistress, and inspect an execution. In order to turn him from these pursuits, which were calculated to render him unpopidar, the earl of Warwick advised him to marry; and with his con sent went over to France to procure Bona of Savoy as queen, and the match was accordingly concluded. But whilst the earl was hastening the negociation in France, the king himself rendered it abortive at home, by marrying Elizabeth Woodville, with whom he had faden in love. Having thus given War wick real cause of offence, he was resolved to widen the breach, by driving him from the council. Warwick, whose prudence was equal to his bravery, soon made use of both to assist his revenge ; and formed such a combination against Edward, that he was, in turn, obliged to dy the kingdom. Thus, once more, the poor passive king Henry was re leased from prison, to be placed upon a dangerous throne. A parliament was called, which confirmed Henry's title with great solemnity ; and Warwick was himself received among the peo ple under the title of king-maker. But Edward's party, though repressed, was not destroyed. Though an exde in Holland, he had many partisans at home; and after an absence of nine months, being seconded by a smad body of troops, granted hhn by the duke of Burgundy, he made a descent at Ravenspur in Yorkshire. Though, at first, he was coody received by the English, yet his army in creased upon his march, while his moderation and feigned hu mility still added to the number of his partizans. London, at that time ever ready to admit the most powerful, opened her gates to him; and the wretched Henry was once more plucked from his throne, to be sent back to his former mansion. l)\"Would gallant \u2014 machte oft den Hof \u2014 6"], [96, "82 Nothing now, therefore, remained to Warwick, but to cut short a state of anxious suspense, by hazarding a battle. Ed ward's fortune prevaded. They met at St. Alban's, and the Lancastrians were defeated; while Warwick himself, leading a chosen body of troops into the thickest of the slaughter, fell in the midst of his enemies, covered with wounds. Margaret, receiving the fatal news of the death of the brave Warwick, and the total destruction of her party , gave way to her grief, for the first time, in a torrent of tears; and yielding to her unhappy fate , took sanctuary x) in the abbey of Beau lieu, in Hampshire. She had not long been in this melancholy abode before she found some few friends stdl waiting to assist her faden fortunes. Tudor, earl of Pembroke, Courtney, earl of Devon shire, the lords Wenlock and St. John, with other men of rank, exhorted her stdl to hope for success, and offered to as sist her to the last. She had now fought battles in almost every province in England; Tewkesburypark was the scene that terminated ner attempts. The duke of Somerset headed her army; a man who had shared her dangers, and had ever been steady in her cause. He was valiant, generous, and po lite; but rash and headstrong. When Edward first attacked him in his entrenchments', he repulsed him with such vigour, that the enemy retired with precipitation; upon which, the duke, supposing them routed, pursued, and ordered lord Wen lock to support his charge. But unfortunately this lord dis obeyed his orders; and Somerset's forces were soon overpow ered by numbers. In this dreadful exigence, the duke, finding that ad was over, became v ungovernable in his rage; and be holding Wenlock inactive,\" and remaining in the very place where he had first drawn up his men, giving way to his fury, with his heavy battle-axe in both hands, he ran upon the cow ard, and with one blow dashed out his brains. The queen and the prince were taken prisoners after the battle, and brought into the presence of Edward. The young prince appeared before the conqueror with undaunted majesty; and being asked, in an insulting manner, how he dared to in- 1) Zuflucht."], [97, "83 vade England without leave, more mindful of his high birth than of his ruined fortunes, he boldly- replied, \u201eI have entered the dominions of my father, to revenge his injuries, and re dress my own.\" The barbarous Edward, enraged at his in trepidity, struck him on the mouth with his gauntlet ; and this served as a signal for farther brutality; the dukes of Glou cester, Clarence, and others, like wild beasts, rushing on the unarmed youth at once, stabbed him to the heart with their daggers. To complete the tragedy, Henry himself, who had long been the passive spectator of ad these horrors, was now thought unfit to live. The duke of Gloucester, afterwards Rich ard the Third, entering his chamber alone', murdered him in cold blood. Of ad those that were taken, none were suffered to survive but Margaret herself. It was perhaps expected that she would be ransomed by the king of France; and in this they were not deceived, as that monarch paid the king of England fifty thousands crowns for her freedom. This extra ordinary woman, after having sustained the cause of her hus band in twelve battles, after having survived her friends, for tunes, and children, died a few years after in privacy in France, very miserable indeed; but with few other claims to our pity, except her courage and her distresses. Edward, being now freed from great enemies, turned to the punishment of those of lesser note ; so that the gibbets were hung with his adversaries, and their estates confiscated to his use. Whde he was rendering himself terrible on the other hand, he was immersed in abandoned pleasures on the other. Nature, it seems, was not unfavourable to him in that respect; as he was universady adowed to be the most beautiful man of his time. His courtiers also seemed willing to encourage those debaucheries in which they had a share; and the clergy were ever ready to lend absolution to ad his fadings. Among the number of his mistresses, was the wife of one Shore, a merchant in the city, a woman of exquisite beauty and good sense. Among his other cruelties, that to his brother the duke of Clarence is the most remarkable. The king hunt ing one day in the park of Thomas Burdet, a creature of the duke's, kided a white buck, which was a great favourite of the owner. Burdet, vexed at the loss, broke into a passion, 6*"], [98, "84 and wished the horns of the deer in the bedy of the person who had advised the king to that insult. For this trifling ex clamation, Burdet was tried for his life1), and publicly exe cuted at Tyburn. The duke of Clarence, upon the death of his friend, vented his grief in renewed reproaches . against his brother, and exclaimed against the iniquity of the sentence. The king, highly offended with this liberty, or using that as a pretext against him, had him arraigned2) before the house of peers , and appeared in person as his accuser. In those times of confusion, every crime alleged by the prevailing party was fatal; thej duke was found guilty; and being granted a choice of the manner in which he would die, he was privately drowned in a butt of malmsey3) in the Tower; a whimsical choice, and implying that he had an extraordinary passion for that liquor. However, if this monarch's reign was tyrannical, it was but short : while he was employed in making preparations for a war with France, he was seized with a distemper, of which he expired in the forty- second year of his age, and (counting from the death of the late king) in the twelfth of his reign. The Murder in the Tower. The duke of Gloucester, who had been made protector of the realm, upon a pretence of guarding the persons of the late king's chddren from danger, conveyed them both to the Tower. Having thus secured them, his next step was to spread a re port of their dlegitimacy ; and, by pretended obstacles ; to put off the day appointed for young Edward's coronation. His next aim was to dispatch Lord Hastings, whom he knew to be warmly in the young king's interest. Having summoned Lord Hastings to a councd in -the Tower, he entered the room knitting his brows, biting his dps, and shewing, by a frequent change of countenance, the signs of some inward perturbation. A silence ensued for some time; and the lords of the council looked upon each other, not with- 1) Aus Leben und Tod angeklagt. 2) Liess ihn zum Verhor stellen. 3) Malvasier; a luscious white wine prepared in many places, but originally from Malvasia of Peloponnesus."], [99, "85 out reason, expecting some horrid catastrophe. Laying bare his arm, ad shrivelled and decayed, he accused Jane Shore and her accomplices of having produced this deformity by their sorceries ; upon which Hastings cried : \u201eIf they have committed such a crime , they deserve punishment.\" \u2014 \u201e If! \" cried the Protector, with a loud voice; \u201edost thou answer me with ifs? I tell thee that they have conspired my death ; and that thou, traitor, art an accomplice in the crime.\" He then struck the table twice with his hand, and the room was instantly fided with armed men. \u201eI arrest thee\", continued he, turning to Hastings, \u201efor high treason\", and at the same time gave him in charge to the soldiers. Hastings was obliged to make a short confession to the next priest that was at hand; the Pro tector crying out, by St. Paul, that he would not dine till he had seen his head taken off. He was accordingly hurried out to the Little Green before the Tower chapel, and there be headed on a log of wood that accidentally lay in the way. Jane Shore, the late king's mistress, was the next that felt his indignation. This unfortunate woman was an enemy to6 humble to excite his jealousy; yet, as he had accused her of witchcraft, of which all the world saw she was innocent, he thought proper to make her an example for those faults of which she was really guilty. It was yery probable, that the people were not displeased at seeing one again reduced to former meanness who had for a whde been raised above them, and enjoyed the smiles of a court. The charge against her was too notorious to be denied; she pleaded gudty1) and was ac cordingly condemned to walk barefoot through the sity, and to do in St. Paul's church in a white sheet, with a wax taper in her hand, before thousands of spectators. She lived above forty years after this sentence, and was reduced to the most extreme indigence. The Protector now began to throw off the mask, and to deny his pretended regard for the sons of the late king, think ing it high time to aspire at the throne more openly. He had previously gained over the duke of Buckingham, a man of talents and power, by bribes and promises of future favour. 1) Sie erkannte die Klage an."], [100, "86 This nobleman, therefore, used all his arts to cajole the popu lace and citizens at St. Paul's cross1); and construing their silence into consent2), his followers cried, \u201eLong live king Richard !\" Soon after, the mayor and aldermen 3) waiting upon Richard with an offer of the crown, he accepted it with seem ing reluctance. 'One crime ever draws another; justice wid revolt against fraud, and usurpation requires security. As soon, therefore, as Richard was seated upon the throne, he sent the governor of the Tower orders to put the two young princes to death; but this brave man, whose name was Brackenbury, refused to be made the instrument of a tyrant's; and submissively answered, that he knew not how to embrue his hands in innocent blood. A fit instrument, however, was not long wanting; Sir James Tyrrel readily undertook the office, and Brackenbury was ordered to resign to him the keys for one night. Tyrrel , choos ing three associates, Slater, Deighton, and Forest, came in the night-time to the door of the chamber, where the princes were lodged, and sending in the assassins, he bid them exe cute their commission, while he himself stayed without. They found the young princes in bed, and fallen into a sound sleep : after suffocating them with bolster and pillows, they shewed their naked bodies to Tyrrel, who ordered them to be buried at the stair-foot, deep in the ground, under a heap of stones. But while he thus endeavoured to establish his power, he found it threatened in a quarter where he least expected an attack. The duke of Buckingham, who had been instrumental in placing him on the throne, now took disgust at being re fused some confiscated lands for which he solicited. He there fore levied a body of men in Wales, and advanced by hasty marches towards Gloucester, where he designed to cross the Severn. Just at that time, the river was swoln to such a de- 1) Among the various appendages to the old Cathedral of St. Paul, the most famous for several ages was the cross which stood in the northern part of the church-yard , and was used for various purposes, as well religious as secular and profane.

This inun dation continued for ten days; during which Buckingham's army, composed of Welshmen, could neither pass the river, nor find subsistence on their own side; they were therefore obb ged to disperse, and return home, notwithstanding ad the duke's efforts to prolong their stay. In this helpless situation, the duke, after a short deliberation, took refuge at the house of one Banister, who had been his servant, and who had re ceived repeated obligations from his family; but the wicked seldom find, as they seldom exert, friendship. Banister, unable to resist the temptation of a large reward, that was set upon the duke's head, went and betrayed him to the sheriff of Shrop shire; who, surrounding the house with armed men, seized the duke, in the habit of a peasant, and conducted him to Salis bury; where he was instantly tried, condemned, and executed, according to the summary method practised in those days. Amidst the perplexity caused by many disagreeable occur rences, he received information that the earl of Richmond was making preparations to land in England, and assert his claims to the crown. Richard, who knew not in what quarter he might expect the invader, had taken post at Nottingham, in the centre of the kingdom; and had given commissions to se veral of his creatures to oppose the enemy wherever he should land. Some time after, however, the earl of Richmond, who was a descendant from John of Gaunt, by the female line, re solved to strike for the crown. He had been long obnoxious to the house of York, and had been obliged to quit the king dom; but he now, knowing how odious the king was, set out from Harfleur, in Normandy, with a retinue of about two thou sand persons; and after a voyage of six days, arrived at Mil ford-haven, in Wales, where he landed without opposition. Upon news of this descent, Richard, who was possessed of cour age and midtary conduct, his only virtues, instantly resolved to meet his antagonist, and decide their mutual pretensions by a battle. Richmond, on the other hand, being reinforced by Sir Thomas Bourchier, Sir Walter Hungerford, and others, to the number of about six thousand, boldly advanced with the same"], [102, "88 intention ; and in a few days both armies drew near Bosworth field, where the contest that had now for more than forty years fided the kingdom with blood, was determined by the death of Richard, who was slain in battle, while Richmond was sa luted king, by the title of Henry the Seventh. Henry's first care, upon coming to the throne, was to marry the princess Elizabeth, daughter of Edward the Fourth ; and thus he blended the interests of the houses of York and Lancaster, so that ever after they were incapable of distinction. A great part of the miseries of his predecessors proceeded from their poverty, which was mostly occasioned by riot and dissipation. Henry saw that money alone could turn the scale of power in his favour; and therefore hoarded up all the con fiscations of his enemies with the utmost frugality. Immediately after his marriage with Elizabeth, he issued a general pardon to ad such as chose to accept it ; but people were become so turbulent and factious, by a long course of civil war, that no governor could rule them, nor any king please; so that one rebellion seemed extinguished only to give rise to another. Ir'erhin Warbeck. There lived in Oxford one Richard Simon, a priest, who, possessing some subtlety and more rashness, trained up Lam bert Simnel, a baker's son, to counterfeit the person of the earl of Warwick, the son of the duke of Clarence,, who was smothered in a butt of malmsey. But as the impostor was not calculated to bear a close inspection, it was thought proper to show him first at a distance ; and Ireland was judged the fittest theatre for him to support his assumed character. In this manner king Simnel, being joined by lord Lovel, and one or two lords more of the discontented party, resol ved to pass over into England; and accordingly landed in Lancashire, from whence he marched to York, expecting the coimtry would rise and join him, as he marched along. But in this he was deceived; the people, averse to join a body of Ger man and Irish troops, by whom he was supported, and kept in awe by the king's reputation, remained in tranquidity, or gave ad their assistance to the royal cause. The earl of Lin-"], [103, "89 coin, therefore, a disaffected lord, to whom the command of the rebel army was given, finding no hopes but in speedy victory, was determined to bring the contest to a short issue. The opposite armies met at Stoke, in the county of Not tingham, and fought a battle, which was more bloody, and more obstinately disputed, than could have been expected from the inequality of their forces. But victory at length declared in favour of the king, and it proved decisive. Lord Lincoln per ished in the field of battle; lord Lovel was never more heard of, and it is supposed he shared the same fate. Simnel, and his tutor Simon, were taken prisoners; and four thousand of the common men fell in the battle. Simon, being a priest, could not be tried by the civil power, and was only committed to close confinement. Simnel was too contemptible to excite the Icing's fear or resentment; he was pardoned, and made a scullion in the king's kitchen, whence he was afterwards ad vanced to the rank of falconer, in which mean employment he died. A fresh insurrection began in Yorkshire; the people re sisting the commissioners who were appointed to levy the taxes, the earl of Northumberland attempted to enforce the king's command; but the populace, being by this taught to believe that he was the adviser of their oppressors, flew to arms, at tacked his house, and put him to death. The mutineers did not stop there; but, by the advice of one John Archamber, a seditious fedowl of mean birth, they chose Sir John Egrc mont for their leader, and prepared themselves for a vigorous resistance. The king, upon hearing of this rash proceeding, immediately levied a force, which he put under the earl of Surrey; and this nobleman encountering the rebels, dissipated the tumult, and took their leader, Archamber, prisoner. Ar chamber was shortly after executed; but Sir John Egremont fled to the court of the duchess of Burgundy, the usual retreat of all who were obnoxious to government in England. One would have imagined, that, from the ill success of Simnel's imposture , few would be wildng to embark in another simdar kind; however, the old duchess of Burgundy, rather irritated than discouraged by the failure of her past enterprises, was determined to disturb that government which she could"], [104, "90 not subvert. She first procured a report to be spread, that the young duke of York, said to have been murdered in the Tower , was still living ; and finding the rumour greedily recei ved, she soon produced a young man who assumed his name and character. The person pitched upon to sustain this part was one Osbeck, or Warbeck, the son of a converted Jew, who had been over in England during the reign of Edward IV, where he had this son named Peter, but corrupted, after the Flemish manner, into Peterkin, or Perkin. The duchess of Burgundy found this youth entirely suited to her purposes; and her lessons, instructing him to personate the duke of York, were easily learned and strongly retained by a youth of very quick apprehension. In short, his graceful air, his courtly ad dress, his easy manner, and elegant conversation, were capable of imposing upon ad but such as were conscious of the im posture. The English, ever ready to revolt, gave credit to all these absurdities, while the young man's prudence, conversation, and deportment, served to confirm what their disaffection and cre dulity had begun. Among those who secretly abetted the cause of Perkin, were lord Fitzwalter, Sir Simon Mountford, Sir Thomas Thwaits, and Sir Robert Clifford. But the person of the greatest weight, and the most dangerous opposition, was Sir Widiam Stanley, the lord Chamberlain, and brother to the famous lord Stanley, who had contributed to place Henry on the throne. This per sonage, either moved by a bdnd credulity, or more probably by a restless ambition, entered into a regular conspiracy against the king; and a correspondence was settled between the mal contents in England and those in Flanders. While the plot was thus carrying on in ad quarters, Henry was not inattentive to the designs of his enemies. He spared neither labour nor expense to detect the falsehood of the pre tender to his crown; and was equally assiduous in finding out who were his secret abettors. For this purpose, he dispersed his spies through all Flanders, and brought over, by large bribes, some of those whom he knew to be in the enenr/s interest. Among these, Sir Robert Clifford was the most re markable, both for his consequence ,' and the confidence with"], [105, "91 which he was trusted. From this person Henry learnt the whole of Perkin's birth and adventures, together with the names of all those who had secretly combined to assist him. The king was pleased with the discovery; but the more trust he gave to his spies, the higher resentment did he feign against them. At first he was struck with indignation at the ingratitude of many qf those about him; but concealing his resentment for a proper opportunity, he, almost at the same instant, ar rested Fitzwalter, Mountford and Thwaits, together with William Danbury, Robert Ratcliff, Thomas Cressenor, and Thomas Astwood. All these were arraigned, convicted, and condemned for high treason. Mountford, Ratcliff, and Danbury, were im mediately executed, the rest received a pardon. The young adventurer, thus finding his hopes frustrated in England, went next to try his fortune in Scotland. In that country his luck seemed greater than in England; James IV, the king of that country, receiving him with great cordiality; he was seduced to believe the story of his birth and adven- tures; and he carried his confidence so far, as to give him in marriage lady Catherine Gordon, daughter to the earl of Hunt- ley, and a near kinsman of his own; a young lady eminent for virtue as well as beauty. But not content with these in- stances of favour, he was resolved to attempt setting him on the throne of England. It was naturally expected, that, upon Perkin's first appearance in that kingdom, all the friends of the house of York would rise in his favours. Upon this ground, therefore, the king of Scotland entered England with a nu- merous army, and proclaimed the young adventurer wherever he went. But Perkin's pretensions, attended by repeated dis appointments, were now become stale even in the eyes of the popidace ; so that, contrary to expectation, none were found to second his pretensions. In this manner the restless Perkin being dismissed Scot land, and meeting with a very cold reception from the Flemings, who now desired to be at peace with the English, resolved to continue his scheme of opposition, and took refuge among the wdds and fastnesses of Ireland. Impatient of an inactive life, he held a consultation with his followers, Herne, Skelton,"], [106, "92 and Astley, three broken J) tradesmen ; and by their advice he resolved to try the affections of the Cornish2) men; and he no sooner made his appearance among them at Bodmin, in Corn wad, than the populace, to the number of three thousand, flocked to his standard. Elated with this appearance of suc cess, he took on him, for the first time, the title of Richard the Fourth , king of England ; and not to suffer the spirits of his adherents to languish, he led them to the gates of Exeter. Finding the inhabitants obstinate in refusing to admit him, and being unprovided with artdlery to force an entrance, he broke up the siege of Exeter, and retired to Taunton. His fodowers by this time amounted to seven thousand men, and appeared ready to defend his cause ; but his heart faded him upon being informed that the king was coming down to oppose him ; and, instead of bringing his men into the field, he privately deserted them, and took sanctuary in the monastery of Beaulieu, in the New Forest. His wretched adherents, left to the king's mercy, found him still willing to pardon; and, except a few of the ringleaders, none were treated with capital severity. At the same time, some other persons were employed to treat with Perkin, and to persuade him, under promise of pardon, to deliver himself up to justice, and to confess and explain ad the circumstances of his imposture. His affairs being altogether desperate, he embraced the king's offers without hesitation, and quitted the sanctuary. Henry being desirous of seeing him, he \u2022was brought to court, and conducted through the streets of London in a kind of mock triumph, amidst the derision and insults of the populace, which he bore with the most dignified resignation. He was then compelled to sign a confession of his former life and conduct, which was printed, and dispersed throughout the nation ; but it was so defective and contradictory, that, instead of explaining the pretended imposture, it left it still more doubtful than before ; and his youth's real pretensions are to this very day an object of dispute among the learned.

There had been hitherto nothing in his reign but plots, treasons, insurrections, impostures, and executions; and it is probable that Henry's severity proceeded from the continual alarms in which they held him. It is certain, that no prince ever loved peace more than he; and much of the ill-will sub jects arose from his attempts to repress their incdnations of war. The usual preface to all his treaties was, \u201eThat when Christ came into the world, peace was sung; and when he went out of the world, peace was bequeathed.\" He had ad along two points in view; one to depress the nobidty and clergy, and the other to exalt and humanize the populace. With this view, he procured an act, by which the nobility were granting a power of disposing of their estates; a law infinitely pleasing to the commons, and not disagreeable even to the nobles, since they had thus an immediate resource for supplying their taste for prodigality, and answering the demands of their creditors. The blow reached them in their posterity alone; but they were too ignorant to be affected by such distant distresses. He was not remiss also in abridging the pope's power, whde at the same time he professed the utmost submission to his commands, and the greatest respect for the clergy. But while he thus employed his power in lowering the influence of the nobles and clergy, he was using every art to extend the privdeges of the people. In fact, his greatest efforts were directed to promote trade and commerce, because this naturady introduced a spirit of bberty, and disengaged them from ad dependence, except upon the laws and the king. Before this great aera, ad our towns owed their origin to some strong castle in the neighbourhood, where some powerful lords generady resided. These were at once fortresses for protection, and prisons for ad sorts of criminals. In this castle there was usually a garrison armed and provided, depending entirely on the noble man's support and assistance. To these seats of protection, artificers, victuaders, and shop-keepers naturady resorted, and settled on some adjacent spot, to furnish the lord and his attendants with all the necessaries they might require. The"], [108, "94 farmers, also, and the husbandmen in the neighbourhood, built their houses there, to be protected against the numerous gangs of robbers, called Robertsmen, that hid themselves in the woods by day, and infested the open country by night. Henry endeavoured to bring the towns \u2022from such a neighbourhood, by inviting the inhabitants to a more commercial situation. He attempted to teach them frugality, and a just payment of debts, by his own example; and never once omitted the rights of the merchants, in all his treaties with foreign princes. Henry having thus seen England, in a great measure, civilised by his endeavours, his people pay their taxes without restraint, the nobles confessing subordination, the laws alone indicting punishment, the towns beginning to live independant of the powerful, commerce every day increasing, the spirit of faction extinguished, and foreigners either fearing England, or seeking its adiance, he began to see the approach of his end, and died of the gout in his stomach, having lived fifty -two years, and reigned twenty-three. Since the times of Alfred, England had not seen such another king. He rendered his subjects powerful and happy, and wrought a greater change in the manners of the people , than it was possible to suppose could be effected in so short a time. About this time all Europe, as well as England, seemed to rouse from the long lethargy in which it had continued for above twelve hundred years. France, Spain, Portugal, and Sweden, enjoyed excellent monarchs, who encouraged and protected the rising arts, and spread the means of happiness. The Portuguese saded round the Cape of Good Hope, under the command of Vasquez de Gama; and the Spaniards, under the conduct of Columbus, had made the discovery of the new world of America. It was by accident only that Henry had not a considerable share in these great naval discoveries; for Columbus, after meeting wish many repulses from the courts of Portugal and Spain, sent his brother Bartholomew into Eng land, in order to explain his projects to the king, and to crave his protection for the execution of them. Henry invited Co lumbus to England: but his brother, in returning, being taken by pirates, was detained in his voyage; and Columbus, in the mean time, succeeding with Isabeda, happily effected his enter-"], [109, "95 prise. Henry then fitted out Sebastian Cabot, a Venetian, who discovered the main land of America to the north, but returned without making any settlement. The king, soon after, expended fourteen thousand pounds in building one ship, called the Great Harry. This was, properly speaking, the first ship in the English navy. Before this period, when the king wanted a fleet, he had no other expedient but to hire ships from the merchants. King Henry and his six wives. No prince ever came to the throne with a conjuncture of circumstances more in his favour than Henry VIII, who in the eighteenth year of his age, undertook the government of his kingdom. And he was at the head of a formidable army, fifty thou sand strong, and as a war with France was the most pleasing to the people, he determined to head his forces for the con quest of that kingdom. But France was not threatened by him alone ; the Swiss, in another quarter, with twenty five thousand men, were preparing to invade it, whde Ferdinand of Arragon, whom no treaties could bind, was only waiting for the con venient opportunity of attack on his side to advantage. Never was the French monarchy in so distressed a situation, but the errors of its assailants procured its safety. After an ostentatious but ineffectual campaign, a truce was concluded between the two kingdoms ; and Henry continued to dissipate, in more peaceful foldes, those immense sums which had been amassed by his predecessor for very different pur poses. In this manner, while his pleasures on the one hand engrossed Henry's time, the preparations for repeated expeditions exhausted his treasures on the other. As it was natural to sup pose the old ministers, who were appointed to direct him by his father, would not willingly concur in thee idle projects, Henry had for some time discontinued asking their advice, and chiefly confided in the councils of Thomas, afterwards Cardinal Wolsey, who seemed to second him in his favourite pursuits. Wolsey was a minister who complied with ad his master's in clinations, and flattered him in every scheme to which his san-"], [110, "96 guine and impetuous temper was inclined. He was the son of a private gentleman, and not of a butcher, as is commonly reported, of Ipswich. He was sent to Oxford so early, that he was a Bachelor J) at fourteen , and at the time was called the Boy Bachelor. He rose by degrees, upon quitting college, from one preferment to another, till he was made rector 2) of Lyming- ton by the marquis of Dorset, whose chddern he had instructed. He had not long resided at this living 3), when one of the justices of the peace 4) put him in the stocks for being drunk, and raising disturbances at a neighbouring fair. This disgrace, however, did not retard his promotion; for he was recommended as chaplain to Henry the Sevendi; and being employed by that monarch in a secret negociation, respecting his intended marriage with Margaret of Savoy, he acquitted himself to the king's sa- tisfaction, and obtained the praise both of diligence and dex- terity. That prince having given him a commission to Maxi- milian, who at that time resided at Brussels, was surprised in less than three days after to see Wolsey present himself be- fore him and supposing that he had been delinquent, began to reprove his delay. Wolsey however surprised him with the assurance that he was just returned from Brussels, and had successfudy fulfilled ad his majesty's commands. His dispatch, on that occasion , procured him the deanery 5) of Lincoln , and in this situation it was that he was introduced by Fox, bishop of Winchester, to the young king's notice, in hopes that he would have talents to supplant the earl of Surrey, who was favourite at that time, and in this Fox was not out in his con jectures. Presently after, being introduced at court, he was 1) Bachelor, Baccalaureus , one who takes his first degree at the university. 2) Pfarrer, vicar Unterpfarrer. 3) Pfrunde. 4) Friedensrichter.

Wol sey used every art to suit himself to the royal temper; he sung, laughed, and danced, with every libertine of the court: neither his own years, which were near forty, nor his character as a clergyman, were any restraint upon him, or tended to check, by ill-timed severities, the gaiety of his companions. To such a weak and vicious monarch as Henry, qualities of this nature were highly pleasing; and Wolsey was soon ack nowledged as his chief favourite, and to him was intrusted the chief administration of affairs. The people began to see with indignation the new favourite's mean condescensions to the king, and his arrogance to themselves. They had long regarded his vicious haughtiness and the unbecoming splendor of the clergy, with envy and detestation ; and Wolsey's greatness served to bring a new odium upon that body, already too much the object of the people's dislike. His character being now placed in a more conspicuous point of Ught, dady began to manifest itself the more. Insatiable in his acquisitions, but stid more magnificent in his expence; of extensive capacity, but still more unbounded in enterprise; ambitious of power but still more desirous of glory; insinuating, engaging, per suasive, and at other times lofty, elevated, and commanding; haughty to his equals, but affable to his dependents ; oppressive to the people, but liberal to his friends; more generous than grateful; formed to take the ascendant in every intercourse, but vain enough not to cover his real superiority. In order to divert the envy of the public from his in ordinate exaltation, he soon entered into a correspondence with Francis the first of France, who had taken many methods to work upon his vanity, and at last succeeded. In consequence of that monarch's wishes, Henry was persuaded by the car dinal to an interview with that prince. This expensive con gress was held between Guisnes and Ardres, near Calais, within the EngHsh pale 2), in compliment to Henry for crossing the sea. 1) Mitglied des geheimen Bathes.

Accordingly, the monarchs, now all gorgeously apparelled, entered the lists on horseback ; Francis surrounded with Henry's guards, and Henry with those of Francis. They were both at that time the most comely personages of their age, and prided themselves on their expertness in the military exercises. The ladies were the jud ges in those feats of chivalry ; and they put an end to the en counter whenever they thought proper. It is supposed that the crafty French monarch was willing to gratify Henry's vanity, by adowing him to enjoy a petty preeminence in these pastimes. He ran a tdt against Monsieur Crandveal, whom he disabled at the second encounter. He engaged Monsieur de Montmo rency, whom, however, he could not throw from the saddle. He fought at falchion2) with a French nobleman, who pre sented him his courser in token of submission. By this time ad the immense treasures of the late king were quite exhausted on empty pageants, guilty pleasures, or vain treaties and expeditions. But the king relied on Wolsey alone for replenishing his coffers; and no person could be fitter for the purpose. His first care was to get a large sum of money from the people, under the title of a benevolence 3), which, added to its being extorted, had the mortification of being con sidered as a free gift. Henry little minded the manner of its being raised, provided he had the enjoyment of it; however, his minister met with some opposition in his attempts to levy these extorted contributions. In the first place, having exacted a considerable subsidy from the clergy, he next addressed himself to the house of commons 4) ; but they only granted him 1) Im Lanzenstechen nnd Tournier.

Wolsey was at first highly offended at their parsimony, and desired to be heard in the house; but as this woidd have destroyed the very form and constitution of that august body, they replied that none could be permitted to sit and argue there, but such as had been elected members. This was the first attempt made in this reign to render the king master of the debates in parliament. Wolsey first paved the way ; and, unfortunately for the kingdom, Henry too well improved upon his plans soon after. Hitherto the administration of all affairs was carried on by Wolsey; for the king was contented to lose, in the inter course with his mistresses, all the complaints of his subjects; and the cardinal undertook to keep him ignorant, in order to continue- his own uncontroded authority. But now a period was approaching that was to put an end to this minister's exor bitant power. One of the most extraordinary and important revolutions that ever employed the attention of man was now ripe for execution. This was no less a change than the Re formation. Leo the Senth was at that time pope, and eagerly employed in budding the church of St. Peter at Rome. In order to procure money for carrying on that expensive undertaking, he gave a commission for seding indulgences1), a practice that had often been tried before, 'shese were to free the purchasers from the pains of purgatory2); and they would serve even for one's friends, if purchased with that intention. There were every where shops opened, where they were to be sold; but in gen eral they were to be had at taverns and gaminghouses. Martin Luther, professor in the university of Wittenberg, began to show his indignation by preaching against them efficacy: and being naturady of a fiery temper, and provoked by opposition, he inveighed against the authority of the pope himself. Being driven hard by his adversaries, still, as he enlarged his reading, in order to support his tenets, he discovered some new abuse or error in the church of Rome. In this dispute, it was the of Commons are those of imposing taxes and voting money for the public service. 1) Ablass. 2) Fegefeuer. 7*"], [114, "100 fate of Henry to be champion on both sides. His father, who had given him the education of a scholar, permitted him to be instructed in school divinity1), which then was the principal object of learned inquiry. Henry, therefore, willing to con vince the world of his abilities in that science, obtained the pope's permission to read the works of Luther, which had been forbidden under pain of excommunication. In consequence of this, the king defended the seven sacraments, out of St. Thomas Aquinas2); and shewed some dexterity in this science, though it is thought that Wolsey had the chief hand in directing him. A book being thus finished in haste, it was sent to Rome for the pope's approbation, which is natural to suppose would not be withheld. The pontiff, ravished with its eloquence and depth, compared it to the labours of St. Jerome 3) , or St. Au gustine, and rewarded the author with the title of Defender of the Faith : dttle imagining that Henry was soon to be one of the most terrible enemies that ever the church of Rome had to contend with. Henry had now been eighteen years married to Catherine of Arragon, who had been brought over from Spain, and mar ried to his elder brother, who died a few months after marriage. But notwithstanding the submissive deference paid to the indulgence of the church, Henry's marriage with this princess did not pass without scruple and hesitation, both on his own side and on that of the people. However, it was carried for ward, though perhaps not at first excited, by a motive much more powerful than the tacit suggestions of his conscience. It happened, that among the maids of honour then attending on the queen, there was one Anna Bud en, the daughter of Sir Thomas Buden, a gentleman of distinction, and related to most of the nobility. He had been employed by the king in several embassies, and was married to a daughter of the duke of Norfolk. The beauty of Anna surpassed whatever had hitherto appeared at this voluptuous court; and her education, which 1) Scholastische Theologie. 2) Thomas von Aquino (in Calabrien) , a celebrated theologian of the thirteenth century. 3) Hieronymus , he lived in the fourth century, a contemporary of St. Augustine."], [115, "101 had been at Paris, tended to set off her personal charms. Her features were regular, mild, and attractive ; her stature elegant, though below the middle size; while her wit and vivacity exceeded even her other allurements. Henry, who had never learned the art of restraining any passion that he desired to gratify, saw and loved her. As his own queen was now become hateful to him, in order to procure a divorce, he adeged that his conscience rebuked him for having so long lived in incest with the wife of his brother. In this pretended perplexity, therefore, he appded to Clement the Seventh, who owed him many obligations, desiring him to dissolve the bull1) of the former pope, which had given him permission to marry Cathe rine; and to declare that it was not in the power, even of the holy see, to dispense with a law so strictly enjoined in scripture. The unfortunate pope, unwilling to grant, yet afraid to refuse, continued to promise, recant, dispute, and temporize; hoping that the king's passion would never hold out during the tedious course of an ecclesiastical controversy. In this he was entirely mistaken. Henry had been long taught to dispute as well as he, and quickly found, or wrested, many taxes of scripture to favour his opinions or his passions. During the course of a long perplexing negotiation, on the issue of which Henry's happiness seemed to depend, he had at first expected to find in his favourite Wolsey a warm defender and a steady adherent; but in this he found himself mistaken. Wolsey seemed to be in pretty much the same dilemma with the pope. On the one haud, he was to please his master the king, from whom he had received a thousand marks of favour ; and on the other hand, he feared to disoblige the pope, whose servant he more immediately was, and who besides had power to punish his disbedience. He therefore resolved to continue neuter in this controversy; and thought of ad men the most haughty, he gave way, on this occasion, to Campegio, the pope's nuncio2), in all things, pretending a de ference to his skill in canon law 3). Wolsey's scheme of tem- 1) Bull , Bulle ; originally , a box, bulb, seal , or stamp ; whence , the seal appended to the pope's letter or edict ; whence, the edict itself. 2) Nuncius. 3) Canon law, kanonisches Gesetz, Kirchengesetz."], [116, "102 porizing was highly displeasing to the king, but for a whde he endeavoured to stifle his resentment, imtd he could act with more fatal certainty. He for some time looked out for a man of equal abdities and less art ; and it was not long before accident threw in his way one Thomas Cranmer, of greater talents, and probably of more integrity. Thus finding himself provided with a person who could supply Wolsey's place, he appeared less reserved in his resent ments against that prelate. The attorney general x) was ordered to prepare a bill of indictment 2) against him ; and he was soon after commanded to resign the great seal 3). Crimes are easily found out against a favourite in disgrace, and the courtiers did not fail to increase the catalogue of his errors. He was ordered to depart from York-place palace ; and all his furniture and plate were converted to the king's use. The inventory of his goods being taken, they were found to exceed even the most extravagant surmises. Of fine Hodand alone there were found a thousand pieces; the wads of his palace were covered with cloth of gold and silver; he had a cupboard of plate of massy gold; all the rest of his riches and furniture were in proportion, and probably their greatness invited the hand of power. He was soon after arrested by the earl of Northum berland, at the king's command, for eight treason, and pre parations were made for conducting him from York, where he then resided, to London, in order to take his trial. He at first refused to comply with the requisition, as being a cardinal; but finding the earl bent on performing his commission, he complied, and set out by easy journeys for London, to appear as a criminal, where he had acted as a king. In his way he stayed a fortnight at the earl of Shrewsbury's ; where one day at dinner he was taken ill, not without violent suspicions of having poisoned himself. Being brought forward from thence, he with difficulty reached Leicester abbey; where the monks 1) Kronanwalt. 2) Anklageakte. 3) Das grosse Staatssiegel ; the privy seal is that which the king uses in matters subordinate that do not require the great seal.

As his disorder increased, an. officer being placed near, at once to guard and attend him, he spoke to him a little before he expired, to this effect : \u201eI pray you have me heartdy recommended unto his royal majesty; he is a prince of a most royal carriage, and hath a princely heart , and rather than he wdl miss, or want any part of his will, he will endanger one half of his kingdom. I do assure you I have kneeled before him for three hours together, to persuade him from his wdl and appetite, but could not prevail. Had I but served God as diligently as I have served the king, he would not have given me over in my grey hairs. But this is the just reward that I must receive for my indulgent pains and study; not regarding my service to God, but only to my prince.\" He died soon after, in all the pangs of remorse, and left a life which he had all long rendered turbid by ambition, and wretched by mean assiduities. The tie that held Henry to the church being thus broken, he resolved to keep no farther measures with the pontiff. He therefore married privately Anna Bullen, whom he had created marchioness x) of Pembroke ; the duke of Norfolk, uncle of the new queen, her father, and Dr. Cranmer, being present at the ceremony. Soon after, he publicly owned his marriage, and to colour over his disobedience to the pope with an appearance of triumph, he passed with his beautiful bride through London, with a magnificence greater than had been ever known before. But though Henry had thus separated from the church, yet he had not addicted himself to the system of any other re former 2). As the monks had ad along shewn him the greatest resist ance, he resolved at once to deprive them of future power 1) Marquise. 2) The Pope declaring the proceedings against Catherine unjust, and ordering the king to take her back as his legitimate wife, Henry took a resolution to erect a separate and independent church within the realm. Act after act contradictory to the papal claims was debated, and passed in parliament; and the kingdom was severed by legislative authority from the communion of Eome, in 1534."], [118, "104 to injure him. He accordingly empowered Thomas Cromwell, who was now made secretary of state x) to send commissioners into the several counties of England, to inspect the monasteries, and to report, with rigorous exactness, the conduct and de portment of such as were resident there. This employment was readily undertaken by some creatures of the court, namely, Layton, London, Price, Gage, Peter and Belasis, who are said to have discovered monstrous disorders in many of the reli gious houses. Their accusations, whether true or false, were urged with great clamour against these communities, and a general horror was excited in the nation against them. A new visitation was soon after appointed, and fresh crimes were also produced ; so that his severities were conducted with such seeming justice and success, that in less than two years he became possessed of ad the monastic revenues. These, on the whole, amounted to 654, of which 28 had abbots who enjoyed a seat in parbament. Ninety colleges were demolished in several counties; 2374 chantries2) and free - chapels , and 110 hospitals. The whole revenue of these estabdshments amounted to 160,000 pounds, which was about the twentieth part of the national income. But as great murmurs were excited by some on this occasion, Henry took care that all those who could be useful to him, or even dangerous in case of opposition, should be sharers in the spoil. He either made a gift of the revenues of the convents to his principal cour tiers, or sold them at low prices, or exchanged them for other lands on very disadvantageous terms. Henry's opinions were at length delivered in a law, which, from its horrid consequences, was afterwards termed the Bloody Statute; by which it was ordained, that whoever, by word or writing, denied transubstantiation 3) ; whoever maintained that 1) Staatssecretar. 2) A chantry is an endowed chapel for priests to sing mass for the souls of the donors; a free-chapel is one exempted from the jurisdiction of the ordinary. 3) Transsubstantiation, change of substance, particularly of the elem ents of the eucharist into the real body and blood of Christ, as held by the Eoman church."], [119, "105 the communion in both kinds x) was necessary ; whoever asserted that it was lawful for priests to marry: whoever alleged that vows of chastity might be broken; whoever maintained that private masses were unprofitable, or that auricular confession 2) was unnecessary, should be found guilty of heresy, and burned or hanged as the court should determine. As the people were at that time chiefly composed of those who followed the opinions of Luther , and such as stid adhered to the pope , this statute, with Henry's former decrees, in some measure excluded both, and opened a field for persecution, which soon after produced its dreadful harvests. Bainham and Bilney were burned for their opposition to popery. Sir Thomas More and bishop Fisher were beheaded for denying the king's supremacy. These severities, however, were preceded by one of a dif ferent nature, arising neither from redgious nor political causes, but merely from tyrannical caprice. Anna Bullen, his queen, had always been a favourer of the reformation, and conse quently had many enemies on that account, who only waited some fit occasion to destroy her credit with the king; and that occasion presented itself but too soon. The king's passion was by this time quite paded with satiety; he was now fallen in love with another, and languished for the possession of Jane Seymour, who had for some time been maid of honour to the queen. In the mean time her enemies were not remiss in raising an accusation against her. The duke of Norfolk, from his attachment to the old religion, took cafe to produce several witnesses, accusing her of infidedty. Four persons were par ticularly pointed out as her paramours; Henry Norris, groom of the stole3); Weston Brereton, gentleman of the king's bed chamber4), together with Mark Smeton, a musician. Accor dingly soon after, Norris, Weston, Brereton and Smeton, were tried in Westminster hall, when Smeton was prevailed upon, by the promise of a pardon, to confess a criminal correspon- 1) Unter beiden Gestalten. 2) Auricular confession, Ohrenbeichte. 3) Oberkammerherr. 4) Koniglicher Kammerdiener."], [120, "106 dence with the queen ; but he was never confronted by her he accused; and his execution, with the rest, shortly after, served to acquit her of the charge. Norris, who had been much in the king's favour, had an offer of his life, if he would confess his crime, and accuse his mistress ; but he rejected the proposal with contempt; and died professing her innocence and his own. The queen was tried by a jury of peers l). Part of the charge against her was, that she had declared to her attend ants that the king never had her heart ; which was considered as a slander upon the throne, and strained into a breach of a law-statute, by which it was declared criminal to throw any slander upon the king, queen, or their issue. The unhappy queen , though unassisted by counsel 2), defended herself with great judgment and presence of mind ; and the spectators could not forbear declaring her entirely innocent. She answered distinctly to ad the charges brought against her: but the king's authority was not to be controded; she was declared guilty, and her sentence ran that she should be burned or beheaded at the king's pleasure. On the morning of her execution, her sentence being mitigated into beheading, she sent for Kingstone, the keeper of the Tower, to whom, upon entering the prison, she said: \u201eMr. Kingstone, I hear I am not to die till noon, and I am sorry for it; for I thought to be dead before this time, and free from a life of pain.\" The keeper attempting to comfort her, by assuring her the pain would be very little, she replied \u201eI have heard the executioner is very expert ; and (clasping her neck with her hands, laughing) I have but a little neck.\" When brought to the scaffold, from a consideration of her chdd Edsabeth's welfare, she would not inflame the minds of the spectators against her prosecutors, but contented herseff with saying \u201ethat she was come to die as she was sentenced by law.\" She would accuse none, nor say any thing of the ground upon which she was judged: she prayed heartly for the king, and caded him \u201ea most merciful and gentle prince: 1) Peer, an equal; a nobleman, so called because men of distin guished birth were alone considered fit companions for the king; at present, the word is limited to the members of the upper house of par liament. 2) A counsellor, one that pleads a cause."], [121, "107 that he always had been to her a good and gracious sover eign and that if any one should think proper to canvass her cause, she desired him to judge the best.\" She was beheaded by the executioner of Calais, who was brought over, as much more expert than any in England. The very next day after her execution, Henry maried the lady Jane Seymour, his cruel heart being no way softened by the wretched fate of one that had been so lately the object of his warmest affections. He also ordered his pardament to give him a divorce between her sentence and execution ; and thus he endeavoured to bastardize J) Edzabeth, the only child he had by her, as he had in the same manner formerly bastardized Mary, his only chdd by queen Catherine. In the midst of these commotions, the fires of Smithfield 2) were seen to blaze with usual fierceness. Those who had ad hered to the pope, or those who fodowed the doctrines of Luther, were equally the object of royal vengeance, and ecclesiastical persecution. From the nmltiplied alterations which were made in the national systems ot belief, mostly drawn up by Henry himself, few knew what to think, or what to profess. They were ready enough to follow his doctrines, how inconsistent or contradictory soever; but as he was continually changing them himself, they could hardly pursue so fast as he advanced be fore them. Thomas Cromwell, raised by the king's caprice from being a blacksmith's son to be a royal favourite (for ty rants ever raise their favourites from the lowest of the people) together with Cranmer, now become archbishop of Canterbury, were both seen to favour the reformation with all their endeav ours. On the other hand, Gardiner, bishop of Winchester, to gether with the duke of Nordfolk, were for leading the king back to his original faith. In fact , Henry submitted to neither ; his pride had long been inflamed by flattery, that he thought himself entitled to regulate, by his own single opinion, the re ligious faith of the whole nation. Soon after, no less than 500 persons were imprisoned for 1) Fur unehelich erklaren. 2) Smithfield is a famous place in London, which now serves as a market for cattle, but where formerly heretics were burnt."], [122, "108 contradicting the opinions delivered by the Bloody Statute ; and received protection only from the lenity of Cromwed. Lambert, a school-master, and doctor Barnes, who had been instrument al in Lambert's execution , felt the severity of the persecuting spirit; and by a bill in pardament, without any trial, were condemned to the flames, discussing theological questions at the very stake. With Barnes were executed one Gerrard, and Je rome, for the same opinions. Three Cathodes also, whose names were Abel, Fether stone and Powel, were dragged upon the same hurdles to execution; and who declared that the most grievous part of their punishment was the being coupled with such heretical miscreants as were united in the same calamity. During these horrid transactions, Henry was resolved to take another queen. Jane Seymour having had borne him a male child, had died a fortnight afterwards. After some ne gociations upon the Continent, he contracted a marriage with Ann of Cleves, his aim being, by her means, to fortify his al liances with the princes of Germany. His aversion, however, to the . queen secretly increased every day ; and he at length resolved to get rid of her and his prime minister together. He had a strong cause of disdke to him for his late unpropitious aidance ; and a new motive was soon added for increasing his displeasure. Henry had fixed his affection on Catharine Howard, niece to the duke of Norfolk, and the only method of gratifying this new passion was, as in former cases, discarding the present queen, to make room for a new one. The duke of Norfolk had long been Cromwell's mortal enemy, and eagerly embraced this opportunity to distroy a man he had considered his rival. He therefore made use of all his niece's arts to ruin the favourite; and when his project was ripe for execution, he obtained a commission from the king to arrest Cromwed for high treason. His disgrace was no sooner known, then ad his friends forsook him except Cramner, who wrote such a letter to Henry in his behalf, as no other man in the kingdom would have presumed to offer. However, he was accused in par liament of heresy and treason, and without ever being heard in his own defence, condemned to suffer the pains [of death, as the king should think proper to direct. When he was brought to the scaffold, his regard for his son hindered him"], [123, "109 from expatiating upon his own innocence; he thanked God for bringing him to that death for his transgressions; confessed he had often been seduced, but that he now died in the catholic faith. Henry had thought himself very happy in his new mar riage. He was so captivated with the queen's accomplishments, that he gave pubdc thanks for his felicity. This joy, how ever, was of very short duration. Catherine was accused of adultery, and found guilty; and six months after her marriage she was executed. In about a year after her death, Henry once more changed his condition, by marrying his sixth and last wise, Catherine Parr, the wife of the late lord Latimer, who was considered as a woman of discretion and virtue. She was already passed the meridian of Use J), and managed this capricious tyrant's temper with prudence and success. Stdl however, the king's severity to his subjects continued as fierce as ever. For some time he had been incommoded by an ulcer in his leg; the pain of which, [added to his cor pulence and other infirmities, increased his natural irascibility to such a degree, that scarce any of his domestics approached him without terror. Is was not to be expected therefore, that any who differed from him in opinion, should, at this time par ticularly, hope for pardon. Though his health was declining apace, yet his implacable cruelties were not the less frequent. His resentments were diffused indiscriminately to ad; at one time a protestant, and at another a catholic, was the object of his severity. The duke of Norfolk and his son, the earl of Surrey, were the last that felt the injustice of the tyrant's groundless suspicions. The duke was a nobleman who had served the king with talents and fidelity; his son was a young man of the most promising hopes, who exceded in every accomplishment that became a soldier, a courtier, and a scholar. He excelled in all midtary exercises which were then in request; he encouraged the fine arts by his practice and example; and it is remarkable, that he was the first who brought our language in his poetical pie- 1) Den Mittag des Lebens."], [124, "110 ces, to any degree of refinement. He celebrated the fair Ge raldine in ad his sonnets, and maintained her superior beauty in all places of public contention. These qualifications, however, were no safeguard to him against Henry's suspicions; he had dropt some expression of resentment against the king's ministers, upon being displaced from the government of Boulogne; and the whole family was become obnoxious from the late inconti nence of Catharine Howard, the queen, who was executed. From these motives, therefore, private orders were given to arrest the father and son ; and accordingly they were arrested both in the same day and confined to the Tower. Surrey being a commoner x), his trial was the more expeditious ; and as to proofs, there were many informers 2) base enough to betray the intimacies of private confidence and all the connections of blood. The duchess dowager3) of Richmond, Surrey's own sister, en listened herself among the number of his accusers ; and Sir Richard Southwell, also his most intimate friend, charged him with infidehty to the king. It would seem, that at this dreary period, there was neither faith nor honour to be found in ad the nation. Surrey denied the charge, and challenged his ac cuser to single combat*). This favour was refused him; and it was adeged, that he had quartered 5) the arms of Edward the Confessor on his escutcheon6), which alone was sufficient to convict him of aspiring to the crown. To this he could make no reply, and indeed any answer would have been needless; for neither parliament nor juries, during this reign, seemed to be guided by any other proofs but the will of the crown. This young nobelman was therefore condemned for high treason, notwithstanding his eloquent and spirited defence, and the sentence was soon after executed upon him on Tower bill. In the mean time, the duke endeavoured to mollify the king by 1) Burgerlicher, Nichtadliger. 2) Anklager. 3) Die verwittwete Herzogin. 4) Duell. 5) Im Wappen fiihrte (neben dem Erbwappen); to quarter, to bear as an appendage to the hereditary arms. 6) Escutcheon Wappenschild , Familien wappen , the shield of the fa mily , the ensigns armorial."], [125, "111 letters and submissions, but the monster's hard heart was rarely subject to tender impressions. The parliament meeting on the 14th day of January, a bid of attainder x) was found against the duke of Norfolk; and it was thought he could not so easdy have been convicted, on a fair hearing by his peers. The death-warrant 2) was made out , and immediately sent to the lieutenant of the Tower. The duke prepared for death; the fodowing morning was to be his last; but an event of greater consequence to the kingdom intervened, and prevented his exe cution. The king had been for some time approaching fast towards his end ; and for several days all those about his person plainly saw that his speedy death was inevitable. The disorder in his leg was now grown extremely painful; and this added to his monstrous corpulency, which rendered him unable to stir, made him more furious than a chained lion. He had been very stern and severe; he was now outrageous. In this state he had continued for near four years before his death, the terror of all, and the tormenter of himself; his courtiers having no inclination to make an enemy of him, as they were more ar dently employed in conspiring the death of each other. In this manner therefore, he was suffered to struggle, without any of his domestics having the courage to warn him of his ap proaching end; as more than once, during this reign, persons had been put to death for foretelling the death of the king. At last, Sir Anthony Denny had the courage to disclose to him this dreadful secret; and contrary to his usual custom, he re ceived the tidings with an expression of resignation. His an guish and remorse were at this time greater than can be ex pressed: he desired that Cranmer might be sent for; but be- 1) To attaint is to find guilty of crime, especially of felony or treason.

The late king, in his wid, which he expected would be impdcitly obeyed, fixed the majority of the prince at the completion of his 18th year, and in the mean time, appointed 16 executors of his will, to whom, during the minority, he intrusted the gov ernment of the king and kingdom; the duke of Somerset, as protector, being placed at their head. The Protector, in his schemes for advancing the Refor mation, had always recourse to the counsels of Cranmer, who being a man of moderation and prudence, was averse to vio lent changes, and determined to bring over the people by in sensible innovations to his own peculiar system. A committee of bishops and divines 2) had been appointed by the councd to frame a dturgy for the service of the church ; and this work was executed with great moderation, precision and accuracy. A law was also enacted, permitting priests to marry; the ceremony of auricular confession3), though not abolished, was left at the discretion of the people ; ad the prin cipal opinions and practices of the cathode religion, contrary to what the scripture authorises, were abodshed; and the Re formation, such as we have it, was almost entirely completed in England. With all these innovations the people and clergy in general acquiesced; and Gardiner and Bonner were the only persons whose opposition was thought of any weight: they were, therefore, sent to the Tower, and threatened with the king's further displeasure in case of disobedience. For ad these the Protector gained great applause and popu larity; but he was raised to an enviable degree of eminence, 1) Son of Jane Seymour. 2) Geistliche, Theologen. 3) Ohrenbeichte."], [127, "113 and his enemies were numerous in proportion to his exaltation. Of ad the ministers at that time in {the council, Dudley, earl of Warwick, was the most artful, ambitious, and unprincipled. Resolved at any rate, to possess the principale place under the king, he cared not what means were to be used in acquiring it. However unwilling to throw off the mask, he covered the most exorbitant views under the fairest appearences. Having associated himself with the earl of Southampton, he formed a strong party in the council, who were determined to face them selves from the control of the Protector assumed over them. That nobleman was in fact now grown obnoxious to a very prevailing party in the kingdom. He was hated by the nobles for his superior magnificence and power; he was hated by the catholic party for his regard to the Reformation; he was dis liked by many for his severity to his brother; besides the great estate J) he had raised at the expence of the church and the crown, rendered him obnoxious to all. The palace which he was then budding in the Strand 2), served also, by its mag nificence, and still more by the unjust methods that were taken to raise it, to expose 1dm to the censures of the public. The parish church of St. Mary, with three bishops' houses, were pidled down to furnish ground and materials for the structure. He was soon afterwards sent to the Tower; and the chief article of which he was accused, was his usurpation of the government, and the taking ad power into his own hands ; but his great riches was the real cause. Several others of a sdghter tint were added to invigorate this accusation, but none of them coidd be said to amount to high treason. In consequence of these, a bdl of attainder was preferred against him in the 1) Vermogen. 2) In ancient times the Strand was an open space, extending from Temple Bar to the village of Charing, sloping down to the river, and intersected by several streams from the neighbouring high grounds, which in this direction emptied themselves into the Thames. In after ages, when the residence of the court at Westminster had become more frequent, and the Parliament was held there, the Strand, being the road thence from the City, became the site of several magnificent mansions belonging to the nobility and clergy, most of which were situated on the south side , and had large gardens extending to the water's edge. 8"], [128, "114 house of lords : but Somerset contrived for this time to elude the rigour, of their sentence, by having previously, on his knees confessed the charge before the members of the councd.

This fine on his estate was soon after remitted by the king, and Somer set once more, contrary to the expectation of ad, recovered his liberty. He was even readmitted into the councd. Happy for him if his ambition had not revived with his security.' In fact, he could not help now and then bursting out into invectives against the] king and government, which were quickly carried to his secret enemy, the earl of Warwick, who was now become duke of Northumberland. As he was surrounded with that nobleman's creatures, they took care to reveal all the designs which they had themselves first suggested ; and Somer set soon found the fatal effects of his rival's resentment. He was, by Northumberland's command, arrested, with many more, accused of being his partisans: and he was, with his wife, the duchess, also thrown into prison. He was now accused of hav ing formed a design to raise an insurrection in the north ; of attacknig the train-bands 2) on a muster-day , of plotting to secure the Tower, and to excite a rebedion in London. These charges he strenously denied, but he confessed to one of as heinous a nature, which was, that he had laid a project for murdering Northumberland , Northampton, and Pembroke, at a banquet, which was to be given them by lord Paget. He was soon after brought to trial before the marquis of Win chester, who sat as high- steward 3) on the occasion, with 27 peers more, including Northumberland, Pembroke and North ampton, who were at j once the judges and accusers; and being found guflty, was brought to the scaffold on Tower-hill, where he appeared without the least emotion, in the midst of a vast concourse of the populace, by whom he was beloved.

The people attested their be lief of what he said, by crying out, \u201eIt is most true.\" A uni versal tumult was beginning to take place; but Somerset de siring them to be stid, and not to interrupt his last meditations, but to join with him in prayer, he laid down his head, and submitted to the stroke of the executioner. In the mean time, Northumberland had long aimed at the first authority ; and the infirm state of the king's health opened alluring prospects to his ambition. He represented to that young prince, that his sisters Mary and Elizabeth, who were appointed by Henry's will to succeed in fadure of direct heirs to the crown, had been declared illegitimate by parliament; that the queen of Scots, his aunt, stood excluded by the king's wdl, and being an aden also., lost all right of succeeding; and as the three princesses were thus legady excluded, the succession naturally devolved to the marchioness of Dorset, whose next heir was the lady Jane Grey, a lady every way accompdshed for government, as wed by the charms of her person as the virtues and acquirements of her mind. The king, who had long submitted to ad the podtic views of this designing minis ter, agreed to have the succession submitted to the council, where Northumberland had influence soon after to procure an easy concurrence. In the mean time, as the king's health declined, the min ister laboured to strengthen his own interests and connections. His first aim was to secure the interest of the marquis of Dor set, father to lady Jane Grey, by procuring for him the title of Duke of Suffolk, which was lately become extinct. Having thus obliged this nobleman, he then proposed a match between his fourth son, lord Guilford Dudley, and the lady Jane Grey, whose interests he had been at so much pains to advance. Stdl bent on spreading his interests as widely as possible, he married his own daughter to lord Hastings; and had this marriage solemnized with all possible pomp and] festivity. Meanwhile Edward continued to languish and several fatal symptoms of a consumption began to appear. It was hoped, however, that his youth and temperance might get the better of his disor- 8*"], [130, "116 ders: and from their love, the people were unwilling to think him in danger. It had been remarked, indeed, by some, that his health was visibly seen to decline from the moment that the Dudleys were brought about his person. The character of Northumberland might have justly given some colour to sus picion; and his removing ad, except his own emissaries, from about the king, stdl farther hicreased the distrust of the people. Northumberland, however, was no way uneasy at their mur murs; he was assiduous in his attendance upon the king, and professed the most anxious concern for his safety: but still drove forward his darling scheme of transferring the succession to his own daughter-in-law. The young king was put into the hands of an ignorant woman, who very confidently undertook his cure. After the use of her medicines, ad the bad symptoms increased to a violent degree ; he felt a difficulty of speech and breathing ; his pulse faded, his legs swelled, his colour became livid, and many other symptoms appeared of his approaching end. He expired at Greenwich in the 16h year of his age, and the 7th of his reign, greatly regretted by ad, as his early virtues gave a prospect of the continuance of a happy reign. What Avere the real qualities of this young prince's heart, there was not time to discover; but the cultivation of his understanding, if we may credit historians, was amazing. It is probable, however, that so much flattery as he received would have contributed to corrupt him, as it had formerly corrupted his father. Upon the death of Edward, two candidates put in then pretensions to the crown: Mary, Henry's daughter by Ca tharine of Arragon, relying on the justice of her cause; and ady Jane Grey, being nominated in the late young king's will, and upon the support of the duke of Northumberland, her father-in-law. Mary was strongly bigoted to the catholic faith, having been bred up among churchmen, and having been even thought to prefer martyrdom to a denial of her bedes. As she had lived in continual restraint, she was reserved and gloomy; she had, even during the dfe of her father, the reso lution to maintain her sentiments, and refused to comply with his new institutions. Her zeal had rendered her furious; and she was not only blindly attached to her redgious opinions, but"], [131, "117 even to the popish clergy who maintained them. On the other hand, Jane Grey was strongly attached to the reformers; and though yet but sixteen, her judgement had attained to such a degree o+\" maturity, as few have been found to possess. All historians agree, that the solidity of her understanding , im proved by continual application, rendered her the wonder of her age. Jane, who was in a great measure ignorant of ad the transactions in her favour, was struck with equal grief and surprise when she received intelligence of them. She shed a flood of tears, appeared inconsolable, and it was not without the utmost difficulty that she yielded to the entreaties of North umberland, and the duke her father. Orders were given also for proclaiming her throughout the kingdom; but these \"were but very remissly obeyed. When she was proclaimed in the city, the people heard her accession made public without any signs of pleasure; no applause ensued and some even expressed their scorn and contempt. In the mean time, Mary, who had retired, upon the news of the king's death, to Kenning Hall in Norfolk, sent circular letters to ad the great towns and nobility in the kingdom, re minding them of her right and commanding them to proclaim her without delay. Her claims soon became irresistible; in a dttle time she foimd herself at the head of 40,000 man; while the few who attended Northumberland continued irresolute, and he even feared to lead them to the encounter. Lady Jane, thus finding that all was lost, resigned her roy alty, which she had held but ten days, with marks of real satisfaction, and retired with her mother to them own habita tion. Northumberland also, who found his affairs desperate, and that it was impossible to stem the tide of popular oppo sition, attempted to quit the kingdom; but he was prevented by the band of pensioner guards x), who informed him that he must stay to justify their conduct in being led out against their lawful sovereign. Thus circumvented on all sides, he de livered himself up to Mary, and was soon after executed. Sen tence was also pronounced against Lady Jane and lord Guil- 1) Konigliche Ehrenwache."], [132, "118 ford , but without any intention for the present of putting it into execution. Mary now entered London, and with very dttle effusion of blood saw herself joyfudy proclaimed, and peaceably settled on the thrown. This was a nattering prospect; but soon this pleasing phantom was dissolved. Mary was morose, and a bigot ; she was resolved to give back their former power to the clergy ; and thus once more to involve the kingdom in all the horrors it had just emerged from. Gardiner, Tonstal, Day, Heath, and Vesey, who had been confined, or suffered losses, for their catholic opinions, during the late reigns, were taken from prison, reinstated in their sees, and their former senten ces repealed. A parliament, which the queen called soon after, seemed wdling to concur in all her measures; they at one blow re pealed ad the statutes with regard to religion, which had pas sed during the reign of her predecessor; so that the national religion was again placed on the same footing on which it stood at the death of Henry the Eigth. While religion was thus turning to its primitive abuses, the queen's ministers, who were wildng to strengthen her power by a cathode alliance, had been for some time looking out for a proper consort; they pitched upon Phdip, prince of Spain, and son of the celebrated Charles the Fifth. In order to avoid, as much as possible, any disagreeable remonstrances from the people, the articles of marriage were drawn as favourable as possible to the interest and honour of England; and this in some measure stilled the clamours that had already been be gun against it. The discontents of the people rose to such a pitch, that an insurrection , headed by Sir Thomas Wyat, succeeded; but Wyat being made prisoner, was condemned and executed, with some of his adherents. But what excited the compassion of the people most of all was the execution of lady Jane Grey, and her husband lord Gudford Dudley, who were involved in the punishment, though not in the guilt, of this insurrection. Two days after Wyat was apprehended, lady Jane and her husband were or dered to prepare for death. Lady Jane who had long before"], [133, "119 seen the threatening blow, was no way surprised at the mes sage, but bore it with heroic resolution; and being informed that she had three days to prepare, she seemed displeased at so long a delay. On the day of her execution, her husband desired permission to see her; but this she refused, as she knew the parting would be too tender for her fortitude to with stand. The place at first designed for their execution, was without the Tower; buth their youth, beauty, and innocence, being likely to raise an insurrection among the people, orders were given that they should be executed within the verge of the Tower. Lord Dudley was the first that suffered; and whde lady Jane was conducting x) to the place of execution , the of ficers of the Tower met her, bearing along the headless body of her husband, streaming with blood, in order to be interred in the Tower Chapel. She looked on the corpse for some time without any emotion, and then with a sigh, desired them to proceed. On the scaffold she made a speech, in which she al leged that her offence was not the having staid her hand upon the crown, but the not rejecting it with sufficient constancy ; that she had less erred through ambition than filial obedience; and she wildngly accepted death as the only atonement she could make to the injured state; and was ready by her punishment to shew, that innocence is no plea in excuse for deeds that tend to injure the community. After speaking to this effect, she caused herself to be disrobed by her women, and with a steady serene countenance submitted to the executioner. At the head of those who drove these violent measures forward, were Gardiner, bishop of Winchester, and cardinal Pole, who was now returned from Italy. Pole, who was nearly al lied by birth to the royal famdy, had always conscientiously ad hered to the catholic religion, and had incurred Henry's displeasure, not only by refusing to assent to his measures, but by writing against him. It was for this adherence that he was cherished by the pope, and now sent over to England as legate from the holy see. Gardiner was a man of a very different character; his chief aim was to please the reigning prince, and he had shown already many instances of his prudent conforndty. 1) Gefiihrt wurde."], [134, "120 A persecution therefore began by the martyrdom of Hooper, bishop ot Gloucester,, and Rogers, prebendary1) of St. Paul's. They were examined by commissioners appointed by the queen, with the chancellor at the head of them. Sounders and Taylor, two other clergymen, whose zeal had been distinguished hi carrying on the Reformation, were the next that suffered. Bonner bishop of London, bloated at once with rage and luxury, let loose his vengeance without restraint, and seemed to take a pleasure in the pains of the unhappy sufferers; whde the queen, by her letters, exhorted him to pursue the pious work without pity or interruption. Soon after, in obedience to her commands Ridley, bishop of London, and the venerable Latimer, bishop of Worcester, were condemned together. Ridley had been one of the ablest champions for the Reformation; his piety, learning, and soli dity of judgement , were admired by his friends and dreaded by his enemies. The night before his execution, he invited the mayor of Oxford and his wife to see him; and when he beheld them melted into tears, he himself appeared quite unmoved, inwardly supported and comforted in that hour of agony. When he was brought to the stake to be burnt, he found his old friend Latimer there before him. Of ad the prelates of that age, Latimer was the most remarkable for his unaffected piety, and the simplicity of his manners. He had never learnt to flatter in courts ; and his open re buke was dreaded by ad the great, who at that time too much deserved it. His sermons, which remain to this day, show that he had much learning and much wit, and there is an air of sincerity running through them, not to be found else where. When Ridley began to comfort his ancient friend, Lat imer was as ready, on his part, to return the kind office : \u201eBe of good cheer, brother, cried he, we shall this day kindle such a torch in England, as, I trust in God, shall never be extin guished.\" A furious bigot ascended to preach to them and the people, while fbe fire was preparing: and Ridley gave a most serious attention to his discourse. No way distracted by the 1) Domherr, Stiftsherr, an officiating canon.

At length fire was set to the pde: Latimer was soon out of pain; but Ridley continued to suffer much longer, his legs being consumed before the fire reached his vitals. Cramner's death followed soon after and struck the whole nation with horror. His love of life had formerly prevailed. In an unguarded moment he was induced to sign a paper con demning the Reformation, and now his enemies, after having rendered him completely wretched', resolved to destroy him. Being led to the stake, and the fire beginning to be kindled roimd him, he stretched forth his right hand, and held it in the flames till it was consumed, while he frequently cried out in the midst of his sufferings!\" \u201eThat unworthy hand, at the same time exhibiting no appearence of pain or disorder. When the fire attacked his body, he seemed to be quite insensible of his tortures; his mind was occupied wholy upon the hopes of a future reward. After bis body was destroyed, his heart was found entire; an emblem of the constancy with which he suffered. It was computed that during this persecution, 277 persons suffered by fire, besides those punished by imprisonment, fines and confiscations. Among those who suffered by fire were 5 bishops, 21 clergymen, 8 lay-gentlemen1), 84 tradesmen, 100 husbandmen, 55 women, and 4 chddren. All this was ter rible; and yet the temporal affairs of the kingdom did not seem to be more successful. Calais, that had now for above 200 years been in posses sion of the English, was attacked, and by a sudden and un expected assault, being blocked up on every side, was obliged to capitulate ; so that, in less than eigth days, the duke of Guise, recovered a city that had been in possession of the English since the time of Edward the Third, who had spent eleven months in besieging it. This loss fided the whole kingdom with mur murs, and the queen with : she was heard to say, that, 1) Nichtgcistliche, Laien aus der gentry.

These complicate evils, a murmuring people, an increasing heresy, a disdainful husband, and an unsuccessful war, made dreadful depredations on Mary's constitution. She began to appear consumptive, and this rendered her mind still more morose and bigoted. The people now therefore began to turn their thoughts to her successor; and the princess Elizabeth came into a greater degree of consideration than before. Mary had been long in a very declining state of health; she made use of an improper regimen, which increased the disorder. Every reflection now tormented her. The con sciousness of being detested by her subjects, and the prospect of Elizabeth's succession, whom she hated, preyed upon her mind, and threw her into a dngering fever, of which she died, after a short and unfortunate reign of 5 years, 4 months, and 11 days, in the 43d year of her age. Q,ueen Elizabeth. Nothing could exceed the joy that was diffused among the people upon the accession of Elizabeth, who now came to the throne without any opposition. This favourite of the people, from the beginning, resolved upon reforming the Church, even while she was held in the constraints of a prison; and now, upon coming to the crown, she immediately set about it. A parliament soon after com pleted what the prerogative had begun; act after act was passed in favour of the Reformation; and in a single session the form of religion was established as we at present enjoy it. A state of permanent felicity is not to be expected here; and Mary Stuart, commonly called Mary, queen or Scots, was the first person that excited the fears of the resentment of Elizabeth. Henry the Seventh had married his eldest daughter Margaret to James, king of Scotland, who, dying, left no issue that came to maturity, except Mary, afterwards surnamed queen of Scots. At a very early age this princess, being pos sessed of every accompdshment of person and mind, was mar-"], [137, "123 ried to Francis, the dauphin1) of France, who, dying, left her a widow at the age of 19. Upon the death of Francis, Mary, the widow, still seemed disposed to keep up the title; but finding herself exposed to the persecution of the dowager queen2), who now began to take the lead in France, she returned home to Scotland, where she found the people strongly impressed with the gloomy enthusiasm of the times. A dif ference of redgion between the sovereign and the people is ever productive of bad effects; since it is apt to produce con tempt on the one side, and jealousy on the other. Mary could not avoid regarding the sour manners of the reformed clergy, who now bore sway among the Scots, with a mixture of ridi cule and hatred ; while they, on the other hand, could not look tamely on the gaieties and levities which she introduced among them, without abhorrence and resentment. The jealousy thus excited began every day to grow stronger, the clergy waited only for some indiscretion in the queen to fly out into open opposition; and her imprudence but too soon gave them suf ficient opportunity. Mary, upon her return, had married the earl of Darnley, but, having been dazzled by the pleasing exterior of her new lover, she had entirely forgotten to look to the accompdshments of his mind. Darnley was but a weak and ignorant man; violent, yet variable in his enterprises, insolent, yet credulous, and easdy governed by flatterers. She soon, therefore, began to convert her admiration into disgust; and Darnley, enraged at her increasing coldness, pointed his vengeance against every person he supposed the cause of this change in her sentiments and behaviour. There was then in the court one David Rizzio, the son of a musician at Turin, himself a musician, whom Mary took into her confidence. She consulted him on all occasions ; no favours 1) Spr. daw'-fin.

A dowager is a widow with a jointure (Laibgeding) ; hence, generally, a title for ladies who survive their hus bands."], [138, "124 could be obtained but by his intercession ; and all suitors were first obdged to gain Rizzio to their interests, by presents or by fiattery. It was easy to persuade a man of Darnley's jealous temper, that Rizzio was the person who had estranged the queen's affections from him; and a surmise once conceived became to him certainty. He soon therefore consulted with some lords of his party, who accompanying him into the queen's apartment, where Rizzio then was, they dragged him into the anti-chamber, where he was dispatched with fifty six wounds ; the unhappy princess continuing her lamentations while they were perpetrating their horrid intent. Being informed, however, of his fate, Mary at once dried her tears, and said she would weep no more, for she would now think of revenge. She therefore concealed her resentment, and so far imposed upon Darnley, her husband, that he put himself under her protection, and soon after attended her to Edinburgh, where he was told the place would be favourable to his declining health. Mary dved in the palace of Holyrood House ; but as the situa tion of that place was low, and the concourse of persons about the court necessarily attended with noise, which might disturb him in his present infirm state, she fitted up an apartment for him in a sohtary house at some distance, called the Kirk of Field. Mary there gave him marks of kindness and attach ment, she conversed cordiady with 1dm, and she lay some nights in a room under him. It was on the ninth of February that she told him she would pass that night in the palace, because the marriage of one of her servants was there to be celebrated in her presence. But dreadful consequences ensued. About 2 o'clock in the morning the whole city was much alarmed at hearing a great noise ; the house in which Darnley lay was blown up with gunpowder. His dead body was found at some distance in a neighbouring field, but without any marks of violence or contusion. No doubt could be entertained but that Darnley was murdered; and the general suspicion fed upon Both well, a person lately taken into Mary's favour, as the perpetrator. One crime led on to another : Bothwed, though accused of being stained with the husband's blood, though universally odious to the people, had the confidence, whde Mary was on"], [139, "125 her way to Stirling, on a visit to her son, to seize her at the head of a body of 800 horse, and to carry her to Dunbar. It was then thought by the people that the' measure of his crimes was complete; and that he who was supposed to have killed the queen's husband, and to have offered violence to her person, could expect no mercy ; but they were astonished upon finding, instead of disgrace, that Bothwed was taken into more than former favour; and to crown all, that he was married to Mary, having divorced his own wife to procure this union. This was a fatal aidance to Mary, and the people were now wound up, by the complication of her gudt, to pay very bttle deference to her authority. An association was formed, that took Mary prisoner, and sent her into confinement to the castle of Lochlevin, situated in a lake of that name, where she suffered all the severities of. an unkind keeper, and an upbraiding conscience, with a feeling heart. The calamities of the great, even though justly deserved, seldom fail of creating pity, and procuring friends. Mary, by her charms and promises, had engaged a young gentleman, whose t name was George Douglas, to assist her in escaping from the place where she was confined, and this he effected by conveying her in disguise in a smad boat rowed by himself ashore. When the news of her enlargement was spread about, all the loyalty of the people seemed to revive once more, and in a few days she saw herself at the head of 6000 men. A battle was fought at Langside, near Glasgow, which was entn-ely decisive against her ; and now being totally ruined, she fled southward from the field of battle with great precipi tation, and came with a few attendants to the borders of Eng land, where she hoped for protection from Elizabeth, who, instead of protecting, ordered her to be put in confinement, yet treated her with ad proper marks of respect. She was accordingly sent to Tutbury castle, in the county of Stafford, and put under the custody of the earl of Shrews bury; where she had hopes given her of one day coming into favour, and that, unless her own obstinacy prevented, an accom modation might at last take place. The duke of Norfolk was the only peer who enjoyed that highest title of nobdity in England; and the qualities of his"], [140, "126 mind corresponded to his high station. Beneficent, affable, and generous, he had acquired the affections of the people; and yet, from his moderation, he had never alarmed the jealousy of the sovereign. He was at this time a widower, and being of a suitable age to espouse the queen of Scots, her own at tractions, as wed as his interests, made him desirous of the match. Elizabeth, however, dreaded such an union, and the duke was soon after made prisoner, and sent to the Tower. Upon his release from thence, new projects were set on foot by the enemies of the queen and the reformed redgion, secretly fomented by Rodolphi, an instrument of the court of Rome, and the bishop of Ross, Mary's minister in England. It was concerted by them, that Norfolk should renew his designs upon Mary, and raise her to the throne, to which it was probable he was prompted by passion as well as interest ; and this nobleman entering into their schemes, he, from being at first ambitious, now became criminal. His servants were brought to make a full confession of their master's guilt; and the bishop of Ross, soon after, finding the whole discovered, did not scruple to confirm their testimony. The duke was instantly committed to the Tower, and ordered to prepare for his trial. A jury1) of 25 peers unanimously passed sentence upon him; and the queen, four months after, reluctantly signed the warrant 2) for his execution. He died with great calmness and constancy; and though he cleared himself of any disloyal intentions against the queen's authority, he acknowledged the justice of the sentence, by which he suffered. These conspiracies served to prepare the way for Mary's ruin, whose greatest misfortunes proceeded rather from the violence of her friends, than the malignity of her enemies. Elizabeth's ministers had long been waiting for some signal instance of the captive queen's enmity, which they could easily convert into treason; and this was not long wanting. About this time, one John Badard, a popish priest, who had been bred in the English seminary at Rheims, resolved to compass 1) Ein Schwurgericht. 2) Der Befehl : A warrant is a writ conferring some right or authority; specially, a writ of caption."], [141, "127 the death of the queen, whom he considered as the enemy of his religion; and with that gloomy resolution came over to England in the disguise of a soldier, with the assumed name of captain Fortesque. He bent his endeavours to bring about at once the project for an assassination, an insurrection , and an invasion. The first person he addressed himself to was Anthony Babington of Dethick, in the county of Derby, a young gentleman of good family, and possessed o( a very plentiful fortune. This person had long been remarkable for his zeal in the catholic cause, and in particular for his attach ment to the captive queen. He therefore came readily into the plot, and procured the concurrence and assistance of some other associates, in this dangerous undertaking. The next step was to apprise Mary of the conspiracy formed in her favour; and this they effected by conveying their letters to her by means of a brewer that supplied the famdy with ale, through a chink in the wall of her apartment. In these, Babington informed her of a design laid for a foreign invasion, the plan of an insurrection at home, the scheme for her deliverance and the conspiracy for assassinating the usurper by six noble gentlemen, as he termed them, ad of them his private friends, who, from the zeal which they bore the catholic cause, and her majesty's service, would undertake the tragical execution. To these Mary replied, that she approved highly of the design; that the gentlemen might expect all the rewards which it should be ever in her power to confer; and that the death of Elizabeth was a necessary circumstance, previous to any further attempts, either for her delivery or the intended insurrection. The plot being thus ripe for execution, and the evidence against the conspirators incontestible , Walsingham, who was privately informed of all, resolved to surpend their punishment no longer. A warrant J) was accordingly issued out for the apprehending of Babington, and the rest of the conspirators, who covered themselves with various disguises, and endeavoured to keep themselves concealed. But they were soon discovered, thrown into prison, and brought to trial. In them examination, they contradicted each other, and the leaders were obliged to 1) Verhaftsbefehl, Steckbrief."], [142, "128 make a full confession of the truth. Fourteen were condemned and executed, seven of whom died acknowledging their crime. The execution of these -wretched men only prepared the way for one of still greater importance, in which a captive queen was to submit to the unjust decision of those who had no right, but that of power, to condemn her. Accordingly, a commission was issued to 40 peers, with five judges, or the major partof them, to try and pass sentence upon Mary, daughter and heir of James the Fifth, (king of Scotland, commonly caded queen of Scots, and dowager of France. 36 of these commissioners arriving at the castle of Fotheringay, pre sented her with a letter from Elizabeth, commanding her to submit to a trial for a late conspiracy. The principal charge against her was urged by sergeant Gaudy, who accused her with knowing, approving, and consenting to Babmgton's con spiracy. This charge was supported by Babington's confession, and by the copies which were taken of their correspondence, in which her approbation of the queen's murder was expressly declared. Whatever might have been this queen's offences, it is cer tain that her treatment was very severe. She desired to be put in possession of such notes as she had taken preparative to her trial; but this was refused her. She demanded a copy of her protest; but her request was not compded with; she even required an advocate to plead her cause against so many learned lawyers, as had undertaken to urge her accusations; but ad her demands were rejected; and after an adjournment of some days, sentence of death was pronounced against her in the Star-chamber :) , ad the commissioners except two being present. Whether Edzabeth was ready sincere in her apparent reluctance to execute Mary, is a question difficult to be de termined. Certainly there were great arts used by her corn-tiers to determine her to the side of severity; as they had every thing to fear from the resentment of Mary, in case she ever succeeded to the throne. Accordingly, the kingdom was now filled with rumours of plots,\" treasons, and insurrections; and the 1) Sternkammer, formerly a criminal court, in Westminster."], [143, "129 queen was continually kept in alarm by fictitious dangers. She therefore appeared to be in great terror and perplexity; she was observed to sit much alone, and to mutter to herself half sentences, importing the difficulty and distress to which she was reduced. In this situation, she one day caded her secretary, Davison, whom she ordered to draw out secretly the warrant for Mary's execution, informing him, that she intended to keep it by her in case any attempt should be made for the delivery of that princess. She signed the warrant, and then com manded it to be carried to the chancedor, to have the seal affixed to it. Next morning, however, she sent two gentlemen successi vely to desire that Davison would not go to the chancellor until she should see him, but Davison telling her that the warrant had been already sealed, she seemed displeased at his precipitation. Davison, who probably wished himself to see the sentence executed, laid the affair before the councd, who unanimously resolved that the warrant should be immediately put in execution, and promised to justify Davison to the queen. Accordingly, the fatal instrument was delivered to Beale, who summoned the noblemen to whom it was directed, namely, the earls of Shrews bury, Derby, Kent and Cumberland, and these together set out for Fotheringay castle, accompanied by two executioners, to dispatch their bloody commission. Mary heard of the ar rival of her executioners, who ordered her to prepare for death by 8 o'clock the next morning. Early on the fatal morning she dressed herself in a rich habit of silk and velvet, the only one which she had, reserved for this solemn occasion. Thomas Andrews, the undersheriff x) of the county, then entering the room, informed her that the hour was come, and that he must attend her to the place of execution. She replied, that she was ready, and bidding her servants farewell, she proceeded, supported by two of her guards, and followed the sheriff with a secure composed aspect, with a long ved of dnen on her head, and in her hand a crucifix of ivory. She then passed into another hall, the noblemen and 1) Der Unterlandrichter. A Sheriff is the reev e (Vogt, Schultheiss) of a shire, to whom within its circuit the execution of the laws is intrusted.

As soon as she was seated, Beale began to read the warrant for her execution. Then Fletcher, dean of Peterborough, standing without the rails, repeated a long exhortation, which she desired him to forbear, as she was firmly resolved to die in the cathode redgion. The room was crowded with spectators, who beheld her with pity and distress; whde her beauty, though dimmed by age and affliction, gleamed through her sufferings, and was still remark able in this fatal moment. The two executioners kneeling, and asking her pardon , she said she foregave them , and all the authors of her death, as freely as she hoped for forgiveness from her Maker, and then once more made a solemn protes tation of her innocence. Her eyes were then covered with a Unen handkerchief; and she laid herself down without any fear or trepidation. Then reciting a psalm, and repeating a pious ejaculation, her head was severed from her body, at two strokes, by the executioners. In contemplating the contentions of mankind we find almost ever both sides culpable: Mary, who was stained with crimes that deserved punishment, was put to death by a princess M'ho had no just pretensions to inflict punishment on her equal. In the mean time, Phidp, king of Spain, who had long meditated the destruction of England, and whose extensive power gave him grounds to hope for success, now began to put his projects in execution. The point on which he rested his glory and the perpetual object of his schemes, was to support the cathode religion, and exterminate the Reformation. The revolt of his subjects in the Netherlands stdl more inflamed his resentment against the Engdsh, as they had encouraged this insurrection, and assisted the revolters. He had therefore, for some time, been making preparations to attack England by a powerful invasion; and now every part of his vast empire resounded with the noise of armaments, and every art was used to levy supplies for that great design. The marquis of Santa Cruz, a sea officer of great reputation and experience, was destined to command the fleet, which consisted of 130 ves sels, of a greater size than any that had been hitherto seen"], [145, "131 in Europe. The duke of Parma was to conduct the land forces, 20,000 of whom were on board the fleet, and 34,000 more were assembled in the Netherlands, ready to be trans ported into England; no doubt was entertained of this fleet's success, and it was ostentatiously styled the Invincible Armada. Nothing could exceed the terror and consternation which all ranks of people felt in England, upon news of this terrible armada benig under sail to invade them. A fleet of not above 30 ships of war, and those very small, in comparison, Was all that was to oppose it by sea, and as for resisting by land, that was supposed to be impossible, as the Spanish army was composed of men wed disciplined , aud long inured to danger. HM Although the Engdsh fleet much inferior in number and seize of shipping x) to that of the enemy, yet it was much more manageable, the dexterity and courage of the mariners being greatly superior. Lord Howard of Effingham, a man of great courage and capacity as lord admiral 2) , took upon him the command of the navy. Drake, Hawkins and Forbisher, the most renowned seamen in Europe, served under him; whde a smad squadron, consisting of 40 vessels, Engdsh and Flemish, commanded by lord Seymour, lay off3) Dunkirk, in order to intercept the duke of Parma. This was the preparation made by the English; while ad the protestant powers of Europe regarded the enterprise as the critical event which was to decide for ever the fate of their redgion. In the mean time, whde the Spanish armada was preparing to sad, the admiral Santa Cruz died, as likewise the vice admiral4) Paliano, and the command of the expedition was given to the duke de Medina Sidonia, a person utterly inex perienced in sea affairs; and this, in some measure, served to frustrate the design. But some other accidents also contributed to its failure. Upon leaving the port of Lisbon, the armada met next day with a violent tempest, which sunk some of the smallest of their shippnig, and obliged the fleet to put back 1) Ships collectively. 2) Grossadmiral. 3) Aus der Hohe von \u2014 4) An admiral has two subordinate commanders, a vice-admiral aud a rear-admiral. 9*"], [146, "132 into harbour. After some time spent in refitting, they again put to sea, where they took a fisherman, who gave them in telligence that the English deet, hearing of the dispersion of the armada in a storm, was retired back into Plymouth harbour, and most of the mariners discharged. From this false intel ligence, the Spanish admiral, instead of going directly to the coast of Flanders, to take in the troops stationed there, as he had been instructed, resolved to sail to Plymouth, and destroy the shipping laid up in that harbour. But Effingham, the English admiral, was very wed prepared to receive them; he was just got out of port when he saw the Spanish armada coming full sad towards him, disposed in a form of a half moon, and stretching seven miles from one extremity to the other. However the Engdsh admiral, seconded by Drake, Hawkins, and Forbisher, attacked the armada at a distance, pouring in their broadsides x) with admirable dexterity. They did not choose to engage the enemy more closely, because they were greatly inferior in the number of ships, guns, and weight of metal; nor could they pretend to board such lofty ships without manifest disadvantage. However two Spanish gadeons 2) were disabled and taken. As the armada advanced up the Channel, the English stid followed, and infested their rear; and their fleet continuady increasing from different ports, they soon found themselves in a capacity to attack the Spanish fleet more nearly, arid accordingly fell upon them whde they were as yet taking shelter in the port of Calais. To increase their confusion, Howard took 8 of his smaller ships, and filling them with combustible materials, sent them, as if they had been fire ships 3) , one after the other , into the midst of the enemy. The Spaniards taking them for what they seemed to be, immediately took flight in great disorder; while the English, profiting by their panic, took or destroyed about 12 of the enemy. This was a fatal blow to Spain; the duke de Medina 1) Broadside is the side of a ship; also the discharge of all the guns from it. 2) Galionen. A galleon was a four-decked ship used by the Spaniards in their commerce with South America. 3) Brander."], [147, "133 Sidonia being thus driven to the coast of Zealand, held a council of war, in which it was resolved, that, as their ammunition began to fad, as their ships had received great damage, and the duke of Parma had refused to venture his army under their protection, they should return to Spain by sailing round the Orkneys, as the wind were contrary to his passage directly back. Accordingly they proceeded northwards, and were followed by the English fleet as far as Flamborough - head, where they were terribly shattered by a storm; 17 of the ships having 5000 men on board, were afterwards cast away on the Western isles, and the coast of Ireland. Of the whole armada, 53 ships only returned to Spain, in a miserable condition, and the seamen, as well as sadors, who remained, only served, by their accounts, to intimidate their countrymen from attempting to renew so dangerous an expedition. From being invaded, the Engdsh, in their turn, attacked the Spaniards. Of those who made the most signal figure in the depredations upon Spain, was the young earl of Essex, a nobleman of great bravery, generosity and genius; and fitted not only for the foremost ranks in war by his valour but to conduct the intrigues of a court by his eloquence and address. In ad the masques which were then performed, the earl and Elizabeth were generally coupled as partners; and although she was almost sixty, and he not half so old, yet her vanity- overlooked the disparity; the world told her that she was young, and she herself was willing to think so. This young earl's interest in the queen's affections, as may naturady be supposed, promoted his interest in the state ; and he conducted all things at his direction. But, young and unexperienced as he was , he at length began to fancy that the popularity he possessed, and the datteries he received, were given to his merits, and not to his favour. In a debate before the queen between him and Burleigh, about the choice of a governor for Ireland, he was so heated in the argument, that he entirely forgot both the rules and duties of civility. He turned his back on the queen in a contemptuous manner, which so pro voked her resentment, that she instantly gave him a box on the ear. Instead of recollecting himself and making the sub mission due to her sex and station, he clapped his hand to"], [148, "134 his svrord and swore he would not bear such usage, even from her father. This offence, though very great, was overlooked by the queen; her partiality was so prevalent, that she rein stated him in her former favour, and her kindness seemed to have acquired now force from that short interruption of anger and resentment. The death also of his rival lord Burleigh, whioh happened shortly after, seemed to confirm his power. At that time the earl of Tyrone headed the rebellious natives of Ireland; who, not yet thoroughly brought into subjection to the English , took every opportunity to make incursions upon the more civilised inhabitants, and slew all they were able to overpower. To subdue these was an employment that Essex thought worthy of his ambition ; nor were his enemies displeased at thus removing him from court, where he obstructed ad their private aims of preferment. But it ended in his ruin. Instead of attacking the enemy in their grand retreat in Ulster, he led his forces into the province of Munster, where he only exhausted his strength, and lost his opporturity against a people that submitted at his approach , but took up arms again when he retired. This issue of an enterprise, from which much was expected, did not fad to provoke the queen most sensibly; and her anger was still more heightened by the peevish and impatient letters which he daily wrote to her and her oouncil. But her resentment against him was still more justly let loose, when she found, that, leaving the place of his appointment, and without any permission demanded or obtained, he fiad returned from Ireland to make his complains to herself in person. Though Elizabeth was justly offended, yet he soon won upon her temper to pardon him. He was ordered to continue a prisoner in his own house tid the queen's further pleasure should be known; and it is probable, that the discretion of a few months might have reinstated him in all his former em ployments; but the impetuosity of his character would not suffer him to wait for a slow redress of what he considered as wrongs; and the queen's refusing his request to continue him in the possession of a lucrative monopoly of sweet wines, which he had long enjoyed, spurred him on the most violent and gudty measures. Having long budt with fond credulity"], [149, "135 on his great popularity, he began to hope, from the assistance of the giddy multitude, that revenge upon his enemies in the council, which he supposed was denied him from the throne. His greatest dependance was upon the professions of the citi zens of London, whose schemes of religion and government he appeared entirely to approve, and while he gratified the puritans1), by rading at the government of the church, he pleased the envious, by exposing the faults of those in power. Among other criminal objects, the result of bdnd rage and despah-, it was resolved that Sir Christopher Blount, one of his creatures, should, with a choice detachment, possess himself of the palace gates ; that Sir John Davis should seize the hall : Sir Charles Davis the guard - chamber ; while Essex himself should rush in from the Mews, attended by a body of his partizans, into the queen's presence, intreat her to remove his and her enemies , to assemble a new pardament, and to correct the defects of the present administration. Whde Essex was dedberating upon the manner he should proceed, he received a private note, by which he was warned to provide for his own safety. He now, therefore, consulted with his friends touching the emergency of their situation ; they were destitute of arms and ammunition, whde the guards at the palace were doubled, so that any attack there would be fruitless. While he and his confidants were in consultation, a person, probably employed by his enemies, came in as a mes senger from the citizen with tenders of friendship and assistance against ad his adversaries. Wdd as the project was of raising the city in the present terrible conjuncture, it was resolved on; but the execution of it was delayed till the day following. Early in the morning of the next day, he was attended by his friends the earls of Rutland and Southampton, the lords Sandes, Parker, and Mounteagle, with 300 persons of distinction. The doors of Essex house were immediately locked, to prevent all strangers from entering; and the earl now discovered his 1) Die Puritaner , a name given in England and Scotland to the most rigid presbyterians (the presbyterians exercise the ecclesiastical government by synods and assemblies subordinate to each other, and all of them subject to a general assembly), who pretend to eminent purity in religion: it is now seldom applied but in contempt."], [150, "136 scheme for raising the city more fudy to ad the conspirators. In the mean time, Sir Walter Raleigh sending a message to Sir Ferdinando Georges, this officer had a conference with him in a boat on the Thames, and there discovered all their proceedings. The earl of Essex, -who now saw that all was to be hazarded, resolved to leave his house, and to sady forth to make an insurrection in the city. But he had made a very wrong estimate in expecting that popularity alone would aid him in time of danger ; he issued out with about 200 fodowers, armed only by swords, and in his passage to the city, was joined by the earl of Bedford and lord Cromwell. As he passed through the streets, he cried aloud \u201efor the queen, for the queen ! A plot is laid for her life\" hoping to engage the populace to rise; but they had received orders from the mayor to keep within their houses; so that he was not joined by a single person. In this manner, attended by a few of his fodowers, the rest having privately retired, he made towards the river; and taking a boat, arrived once more at Essex house; where he began to make preparations for his defence. But his case was too desperate for any remedy from valour ; wherefore after demanding in vain for hostages and conditions from his be siegers, he surrendered at discretion, requesting only civil treatment, and a fair and impartial hearing. Essex and Southampton were immediately carried/ to the archbishop's palace at Lambeth, from whence they were they next day conveyed to the Tower, and tried by the peers on the 19th February following. Little could be urged in their defence ; their guilt was too flagrant, and though it deserved pity, it could not meet an acquittal. -Essex, after condemnation, was visited by that religious horror which seemed to attend him in ad his disgraces. He was terrified almost to despair by the ghostly remonstrances of his own chaplain; he was reconciled to his enemies, and made a full confession of his conspiracy. It is alleged, upon this occasion, that he had strong hopes of pardon, from the irresolution which the queen seemed to dis cover before she signed the warrant for his execution. She had formerly given him a ring, which she desfred him to send her in any emergency of this nature, and that it should pro cure his safety and protection. This ring was actually sent"], [151, "137 her by the coimtess of Nottingham, who being a concealed enemy to the unfortunate earl, never delivered it; while Eliza beth was secretly fired at his obstinacy in making no appli cation for mercy or forgiveness. The fact is, she appeared herself as much an object of pity, as the unfortunate nobleman she was induced to condemn. She signed the warrant for his execution; she countermanded it, she again resolved on his death, and again felt a new return of tenderness. At last she gave her consent for his execution, and was never seen to enjoy one happy day more. With the death of her favourite Essex, all Edzabeth's pleasures seemed to expire: she afterwards went through the business of the state merely from habit, but her satisfactions were no more. Her distress was more than sufficient to destroy the remains of her constitution; and her end was now visibly seen to approach. Her voice soon after left her; she fell into a lethargic slumber, which continued some hours, and she ex pired gently without a groan, in the 70'h year of her age and the 45th of her reign, haughty and severe. Though she was possessed of excellent sense, yet she never had the discernment to discover that she wanted beauty; and to flatter her charms at the age of 65, was the surest' road to her favour and esteem. But whatever were her personal defects, as a queen she is to be ever remembered by the English with gratitude. It is true, indeed, that she carried her prerogative in parliament to its highest pitch; so that it was tacitly adowed, in that assembly, that she was above all laws, and could make and unmake them at her pleasure; yet still she was so wise and good as seldom to exert that power which she claimed, and to enforce few acts of her prerogative, which were not for the benefit of her people. It is true,* in like manner, that the English, during her reign, were put in possession of no new or splendid acquisitions; but commerce was daily growing up among them, and the people began to find that the theatre of their truest conquests was to be on the bosom of the ocean. A nation which, hitherto, had been the object of every invasion, and a prey to every plunderer, now asserted its strength in turn, and became terrible to its invaders. The successful voy-"], [152, "138 ages of the Spaniards and Portuguese began to excite their emulation; and they planned several expeditions for discovering a shorter passage to the East Indies. The famous Sir Walter Raleigh, without any assistance from government, colonized New England, while internal commerce was making equal im provements; and many Flemings, persecuted in their native country, found together with their arts and industry, an easy asylum in England. Thus the whole Irland seemed as if roused from her long habits of barbarity; arts, commerce and legislation began to acquire new strength every day; and such was the state of learning at that time, that some fix the period as the Augustan age *\u25a0) of England. Sir Walter Raleigh and Hooker are considered as among the first improvers of our language. Spenser and Shakespeare are too wed known as poets to be praised here, but, of all mankind, Francis Bacon, lord Verulam, who dourished in this reign, deserves, as a philosopher, the highest applause; his style is copious and correct, and his wit is only surpassed by his learning and penetration. If we look through history, and consider the rise of kingdoms, we shall scarce find an instance of a people becoming in so short a time, wise, powerful, and happy. Liberty, it is true, still continued to ductuate ; Elizabeth knew her own power, and stretched it to the very verge of despotism; but now that commerce was introduced, liberty soon after followed; for there never was a nation that was perfectly commercial, that submitted long to slavery. The Gunpowder Plot. James, the Sixth of Scotland, and the First of England, the son of Mary, came to the throne with the universal appro bation of ad orders of the state, as in his person were united every claim that either descent, bequest, or pardamentary sanction could confer. However in the very beginning of his reign, a conspiracy was set on foot, the particulars of which are but obscurely related. It is said to be begun by lord Grey, lord Cobham and Sir Walter Raleigh, who were all condemned to 1) In the reign of Augustus the arts and sciences flourished at Borne."], [153, "139 die, but had their sentence mitigated by the king. Cobham and Grey were pardoned, after they had laid their heads on the block. Raleigh was reprieved x) , but remained in con finement many years afterwards, und at last suffered for his offence, which was never proved. Mild as this monarch was in toleration, there was a pro ject contrived in the very beginning of his reign for the re establishment of popery, which, were it not a fact known to all the world, could scarcely be credited by posterity. This was the gunpowder plot, than which a more horrid or terrible scheme never entered into the human heart to conceive. The Roman catholics had expected great favour and in dulgence on the accession of James, both as descendant of Mary, a rigid catholic, and also as having shown some par tiality to that religion in his youth; but they soon discovered their mistake, and were at once surprised and enraged to find James on ad occasions express his resolution of strictly execut ing the laws enacted against them, and of persevering in the conduct of his predecessor. This declaration determined them upon more desperate measures; and they at length formed a resolution of destroying the king and both houses of parliament at a blow. The scheme was first broached by Robert Catesby, a gentleman of good parts and ancient family, who conceived that a train of gunpowder might be so placed under the par liament house, as to blow up the king and all the members at once. How horrid soever the contrivance might appear, yet every member seemed faithful and secret in the league, and about two months before the sitting of parliament, they hired a house in the name of Percy, adjoining to that in which the parliament was to assemble. Their first intention was to bore a way under the pardament-house from that which they occupied, and they set themselves laboriously to the task, but when they had pierced the wall, which was three yards in thickness, on approaching the other side, they were surprised to find that the house was vaulted underneath, and that a magazine of coals 1) To reprieve, to respite after sentence of death, die Vollstreckung des Todesurtheils aufschieben."], [154, "140 was usually deposited there. From their disappointment on this account, they were soon relieved, by information that the coals were then seldng off, and that the vaults would then to be let to the highest bidder. They therefore seized the op portunity for hiring the place, and bought the remaining quantity of coals with which it was then stored, as if for their own use. The next thing done was to convey thither 36 barrels of gunpowder, which had been purchased in Hodand; and the whole was covered with coals, and with faggots brought for that purpose. Then the doors of the cellar were boldly thrown open, and every body admitted, as if it contained nothing dangerous. Confident of success, they now began to plan the re maining part of their project. The king, queen, and prince Henry, the king's eldest son, were all expected to be present at the opening of the pardament. The king's second son, by reason of\" his tender age, would be absent, and it was resolved that Percy should seize or assassinate him. The princess Elizabeth, a child likewise, was kept at lord Harrington's house in Warwickshire; and Sir Everard Digby was to seize her, and immediately proclaim her queen. The day for sitting of parliament now approached. Never was treason more secret, or ruin more apparently inevitable, the hour was expected with impatience , and the conspirators gloried in ther meditated guilt. The dreadful secret, though communicated to above 20 persons, had been religiously kept during the space of nearly a year and a half, but a remorse of private friendship saved the kingdom. Sir Henry Percy, one of the conspirators , conceived a design of saving the life of lord Mounteagle, his intimate friend and companion, who also was of the same persuasion with himself. About ten days before the meeting of parliament, this nobleman, upon his return to town, received a letter from a person unknown, and delivered by one who fled as soon as he had discharged his message. The letter was to this effect: \u201eMy lord, stay away from this parliament; for God and man have concurred to punish the wickedness of the times. And think not slightly of this advertisement, but retire yourself into your country', where you may expect the event in safety."], [155, "141 For though there be no appearance of any stir, yet I say they wid receive a terrible blow this parliament; and yet they shall not see who hurts them. \u2014 This counsel is not to be con demned, because it may do you good j and can do you no harm. For the danger is past as soon as you have burned the letter.\" The contents of this mysterious letter surprised and puzzled the nobleman to whom it was addressed; and though inclined to think it a foolish attempt to affright and ridicule him, yet he judged it safest to carry it to lord Salisbury, secretary of state x). Lord Sadsbury, too, was inclined to give little atten tion to it, yet thought proper to lay it before the king in council, who came to town a few days after. None of the council were able to make any thing of it, although it appeared serious and alarming. In the universal agitation between doubt and apprehension, the king was the first who penetrated the meaning of this dark epistle. He concluded that some sudden danger was preparing by gunpowder; and it was thought ad visable to inspect all the vaults below the houses of parliament. This care belonged to the earl of Suffolk, lord chamberlain2), who purposely delayed the search tdl the day before the meeting of pardament. He remarked those great pdes of faggots which lay in the vault under the house of peers, and seized a man preparing for the terrible enterprise, dressed in a cloak and boots, and a dark lanthorn in his hand. This was no other than Guy Fawkes, who had just disposed every part of the train for its taking fire the next morning, the matches and other combustibles being found in his pockets. The whole design was now discovered: but the atrociousness of his guilt, and the despan- of pardon, inspiring him with resolution, he told the officers of justice, with an undaunted air, that had he blown them and himself up together, he had been happy. Before the council he displayed the same intrepid firmness, mixed even with scorn and disdain, refusing to discover his associates, and showing no concern but for the failure of his enterprise. But his bold spirit was at length subdued; being T) Staatssecretar. 2) Oberkammerherr."], [156, "142 confined to the Tower for 2 or 4 days, and the rack1) just shewn him, his courage, fatigued with so long an effort, at last faded him, and he made a full discovery of all his ac complices. Catesby, Percy und the conspirators who were in London, hearing that Fawkes was arrested, ded with ad speed to Warwickshire, where Sir Everard Digby, relying on ad the success of the plot, was already in arms. But the country soon began to take the alarm, and wherever they turned they found a superior force ready to oppose them. In this exigency, beset on ad sides, they resolved, to about the number of 80 persons, to fly no farther, but make a stand at a house in Warwick shire , to defend it to the last, and sed their lives as dearly as possible. But even this miserable consolation was denied them; a spark of fire happening to fall among some gunpowder that was laid to dry, it blew up and so maimed the principal conspirators, that the survivors resolved to open the gate and sally out against the multitude that surrounded the house. Some were instantly cut to pieces; Catesby, Percy, and Winter, standing back to back, fought long and desparately ; till in the end the two first fed covered with wounds, and Winter was taken ahve. Those that survived the slaughter were tried and convicted; several fed by the hands of the executioner and others experienced the king's mercy. The Jesuits, Garnet and Oldcorn, who were privy to the plot, suffered with the rest; and notwithstanding the atrociousness of their treason, Garnet was considered by his party as a martyr, and miracles were said to have been wrought by his blood. The sagacity with which the king first discovered the plot, raise the opinion of his wisdom among the people; but the folly with which he gave himself up to his favourites, quickly undeceived the nation. In the first rank of these stood Robert Carr, a youth of a good family in Scotland, who after having passed some time in his travels, arrived in London, at about 20 years of age. Ad his natural accomplishments consisted in a pleasing visage; and all his acquired abilities in an easy 1) Folterbank ; to put to the rack aus die Foster spannen."], [157, "143 and graceful demeanour. This youth was considered as the most rising man at court ; he was knighted *), created viscount Rochester, honoured with the order of the garter2), made a privycounsedor, and to raise him to the highest pitch of honour, he was at last created earl of Somerset. This was an advancement which some regarded with envy ; but the wiser part of mankind looked upon it with contempt and ridicule, sensible that ungrounded attachments are seldom of long continuance. Some time after, being accused and con victed, from private motives, of poisoning Sir Thomas Over bury, in the Tower, he fed under the king's displeasure; and being driven from court, spent the remainder of his life in contempt and selfconviction. But the king had not been so improvident as to part with one favourite until he had provided himself with another. This was George Vdliers, a youth of 21, the younger brother of a good famdy; who had returned about that time from his trav els, and whom the enemies of Somerset had taken occasion to throw in the king's way, certain that his beauty and fashionable manners would do the rest. Accordingly, he had been placed at a comedy full in the king's view, and imme diately caught the monarch's affections. In the course of a few years, he created him viscount Vdliers, earl, marquis, and duke of Buckingham, knight of the garter, master of the horse, chief justice in Eyre, warden of the cinque ports, master of the king's bench office, steward of Westminster, constable of Windsor, and lord high admiral of England 3). 1) Made a knight.

The brave and learned Raleigh had been confined in the Tower almost from the very beginning of James' acces sion, for a conspiracy which had never been proved against him; and in that abode of wretchedness had written several valuable performances, which are stid in the highest esteem. His long sufferings, and his ingenious writings, had now turned the tide of popular opinion in his favour; and they who once detested the enemy of Essex, cotdd not now help pitying the long captivity of this philosophical soldier. He himself stid struggled for freedom; and perhaps it was with this design that he spread the report of his having discovered a gold mine in Guiana, which was sufficient to enrich not only the adventurers who should seize it, but afford immense treasures to the nation. The king, either believing his assertions, or willing to subject him to further disgrace, granted him a com mission to try his fortune in quest of these golden schemes; but stid reserved his former sentence as a check upon his future behaviour. Raleigh was not long in making preparations for this ad venture, which from the sanguine manner in wich he carried it on, many believe he thought to be as promising as he described it. He bent his course to Guiana, and remaining himself at the mouth of the river Oroonoko, with 5 of the largest ships, he sent the rest tip the stream, under the com mand of his son, and captain Keymis, a person entirely devoted to his interest. But instead of a country abounding in gold, as the adventurers were fought to expect, they found the Spaniards had been warned of their approach, and were pre pared in arms', to receive them. Young Raleigh, to encourage his men, called out, that \u201ethat was the true mine\", meaning the town of St. Thomas, which he was approaching; \u201eand that none but fools looked for any other:\" but just as he was determined pleas between the crown and the subjects) ; steward Haus hofmeiste?; constable Kommandant ; lord high admiral Oberadmiral (he is president of the court of admiralty)."], [159, "145 speaking he received a shot, of which he immediately expired. This was fodowed by another disappointment; for when the English took possession of the town, they found nothing in it of any value. Raleigh, hi this forlorn situation, found now that all his hopes were over; and saw his misfortunes still farther aggra vated by the reproaches of those whom he had undertaken to command. Nothing could be more deplorable than his situation, particularly when he was told that he must be carried back to England to answer for his conduct to the king. It is pretended that he employed many artifices, first to engage them to attack the Spanish settlements at a time of peace, and failing of that, to make his escape into France. But ad those proving unsuc cessful, he was delivered into the king's hands and strictly examined, as well as his fellow - adventurers before the privy council. Count Gondemar, the Spanish ambassador, made heavy complaints agamst the expedition; and the king declared that Raleigh had express orders to avoid all disputes and hostilities against the Spaniards. Wherefore, to give the court of Spam a particular instance of his attachment, he signed the warrant for his execution; not for the present offence, but for his former conspiracy. This great man died with the same fortitude that he had testified through life; he observed, as he felt the edge of the axe, that it was a sharp but sure remedy for ad evils; his harangue to the people was calm and eloquent, and he laid his head down on the block with the utmost indifference. But there soon appeared very apparent reasons for James's partiadty to the court of Spain. This monarch had entertained an Opinion which was peculiar to himself, that in marrying his son Charles, the prince of Wales, any alliance below that of royalty would be unworthy of him, he therefore was obdged to seek, either in the court of France or Spain, a suitable match, and he taught to think of the latter. Gondemar, who was an ambassador from that court, perceiving this weak monarch's partiality to a crowned head, made an offer of the second daughter of Spain to prince Charles; and that he might render the temptation irresistible, he gave hopes of an immense fortune which should attend the princess. However, this was a 10"], [160, "146 negotiation that was not likely soon to be ended; and from the time the idea was first started, James saw 5 years elapsed without bringing the treaty to any kind of conclusion. A delay of this kind was very displeasing to the king, who had all along an eye on the great fortune of the princess ; nor was it less disagreeable to prince Charles, who, bred up with the ideas of romantic passion, was in love without ever seeing the object of his affections. In this general tedium of delay, a project entered the head of Vdders, who had for some years ruled the king with absolute authority, that was fitter to be conceived by the knight of a romance, than by a minister and a statesman. It was projected that the prince should himself travel in disguise into Spain, and visit the princess of that country in person. Buckingham, who wanted to ingratiate himself with the prince, offered to be his companion; and the king, whose business it was to check so wild a scheme, gave his consent to this hopeful proposal. Their adventures on this strange project would fill novels ; and have actuady been made the subject of many. Charles was the knight-errant , and Buckingham was his 'squire1). The match, however, broke off, for what reason, historians do not assign; but, if we may credit the novedsts of that time, the prince had already fixed his affections upon the daughter of Henry IV. of France, whom he married shortly after. It may easely be supposed that these mismanagements were seen and felt by the people. The house of commons was by this time become quite unmanageable, and the prodi gality of James to his favourites had made his necessities so many, that he was contented to sell the different branches of bis prerogative to the commons, one after the other, to procure supplies. In proportion as they perceived his wants, they found out new grievances ; and every grant of money was sure to come with a petition for redress. The struggles between him and his pardament had been growing more and more violent every session, and the very last advanced their pre tensions to such a degree, that he began to take the alarm; 1) Esquire is originally the shield-bearer of a knight. This word is very commonly contracted in Squire."], [161, "147 but these evds fed upon the successor, which the weakness of this monarch had contributed to give birth to. These domestic troubles were attended by others stid more important in Germany, and which produced in the end the most dangerous effects. The king's eldest daughter had been married to Frederick, the elector palatine1) of Germany; and this prince revolting against the emperor Ferdinand II , was defeated in a decisive battle, and obdged to take refuge in Hodand. His affinity to the English crown his misfortunes, but particularly the protestant religion, for which he had con tended, were strong motives for the people of England to wish wed to his cause; and frequent addresses were sent from the commons to spur up James to take a part in the German contest, and to replace the exded prince upon the throne of his ancestors. James at first attempted to ward off the mis fortunes of his son in law by negociation; but this proving utterly uneffectual, it was resolved at last to rescue the palat inate from the emperor by force of arms. Accordingly, war was declared against Spain and the emperor; 6000 men were sent over into Holland, to assist prince Maurice in his schemes against those powers; the people were every where elated at the courage of their king, and were satisfied with any war which was to exterminate the papists. This army was followed by another, consisting to 12000 men commanded by count Mansfeld ; and the court of France promised its assistance. But the Engdsh were disappointed in all their views ; the troops being embarked at Dover, upon sailing to Calais, they found no orders for their admission. After waiting in vain for some time, they were obliged to sad towards Zealand, where no proper measures were yet concerted to their disembarkation. Meanwhde, a pestilential distemper crept in among the forces, so long cooped up in narrow vessels ; half the army died whde on board, and the other half weakened by sickness, appeared too smad a body to march into the Palatinate ; and thus ended this id-concerted and fruitless expedition. Whether this misfortune had any effect upon Jame's con stitution is uncertain; but he was soon after seized with a 1) Kurfiirst von der Pfalzr 10*"], [162, "148 tertian ague J), which, when his courtiers assured him from the proverb that it was health for a king, he replied, that the proverb was meant for a young king. After some fits, he found himself extremely weakened, and sent for the prince, whom he exhorted to persevere in the protestant redgion, then preparing with decency and courage to meet his end, he expired, after a reign over England of 22 years, and in the 59\"' year of his age. Bang Charles's Martyrdom Few princes ever ascended the throne with more apparent advantages than Charles; and none ever encountered more real difficulties. Indeed, he undertook the reins of government with a fixed persuasion that his popularity was sufficient to carry every measure. He had been loaded with a treaty for defending the prince palatine, his brother in law, in the late reign; and the war declared for that purpose was to be carried on with vigour in this. But war was more easdy declared than supplies granted. After some reluctance , the Commons 2) voted him two subsidies; a sum far from being sufficient to support him in his intended equipment. To supply the wants of parliamentary aids, Charles had recourse to some of the ancient methods of extortion, practised by sovereigns when in necessitous circumstances. That kind of tax caded a benevolence 3) was ordered to be exacted, and privy seals4) were issued accordingly.

Another pardament was accord ingly caded; and though some steps were taken to exclude the more popular leaders of the last house of commons, by nominating them as sheriffs of counties, yet the present parda ment seemed more refractory than the former. When the king laid before the house his necessities, and asked for a supply, they voted him only 3000 pounds; a sum no way adequate to the importance of the war or the necessities of the state. In order, therefore, to gain a sufficient supply, a commission was openly granted to compound with the cathodes, and agree for a dispensation of the penal laws against them. He borrowed a sum of money from the nobdity, where con tributions came in but slowly. But the greatest stretch of his power, was in levying of ship-money. In order to equip a fleet (at least this was the pretence made) each of the maritime towns was required, with the assistance of the adjacent counties, to arm as many vessels as were appointed them. The city of London was rated at 20 ships. This was the commencement of a tax, which afterwards being carried to such violent lengths, created such great discontents in the nation. War being soon after declared against France, a fleet was sent out, under the command of Buckingham, to relieve Rochede, a maritime town in that kingdom, that had long enjoyed its privileges independent of the French king, but that had for some time embraced the reformed religion, and now was besieged by a formidable army. This expedition was as un fortunate as that to the coast of Spain. The duke's measures were so ill-concerted, that the inhabitants of the city shut their gates, and refused to admit aides, of whose coming they were not previously informed. Instead of attacking the island of Oleron, which was fertile and defenceless, he bent his course to the isle of Rhe, which was garrisoned and wed fortified. He attempted there to starve out the garrison of St. Martii^ castle, which was plentifully suppded with provisions by sea. By that time the French had landed their forces privately at another part of the island; so that Buckingham was at last I) Verfassungsmiissig."], [164, "150 obliged to retreat, but with such precipitation, that two thirds of his army were cut in pieces before he could re-embark, though he was the last man of the whole army that quitted the shore. This proof of his personal courage, however, was but a small subject of consolation for the disgrace which his country had sustained, for his own person would have been the last they would have regretted. The contest between the king and the commons every day grew warmer. The officers of the custom-house were summoned before the commons, to give an account by what authority they seized the goods of the merchants who had refused to pay the tonnage and poundage 1), which they adeged was levied without the sanction of a law. The barons of the exchequer 2) were questioned concerning their decrees on that head; and the sheriff of London was committed to the Tower for his activity in supporting the custom-house officers. These were bold measures; but the commons went still further, by a resolution to examine into religious grievances , and a new spirit of intolerance began to appear. The king, therefore, resolved to dissolve a parliament which he found himself unable to manage; and Sir John Finch, the speaker3), just as the question concerning tonnage and poundage was going to be put, rose up, and informed the house that he had a command from the king to adjourn. The house upon this was in an uproar: the speaker was pushed back into his chair, and forcibly held in it by Holds and Valentine, tdl a short remonstrance was framed, and passed by acclamation rather than vote. In this hasty production, papists and Arminians 4) were declared capital enemies to the state, tonnage and poundage were condemned as contrary to 1) Tonnage, weight of goods in a vessel, the duty on such goods, Lastigkeit \u2014 Frachtzoll ; poundage, payment rated by the weight of the dmmodity, Pfundzoll. 2) Die vier Eichter im Schatzkammergerichte.

In consequence of this violent procedure, Sir Miles Ho bart, Sir Peter Hayman, Selden, Coriton, Lond- and Strode, were by the king's order, committed to prison, under pretence of sedition. But the same temerity that impelled Charles to imprison them, induced him to grant them a release. Sir John Elliot, Holds, and Valentine, were summoned before the King's Bench x) ; but they refusing to appear before an inferior tribu nal for faults committed in a superior, were condemned to be imprisoned during the king's pleasure, the two former to pay a fine of 1000 pounds each, and the latter, five hundred, and to find sureties for their good behaviour. The members triumphed in their sufferings, whde they had the whole king dom as spectators and applauders of their fortitude. In the mean time, while the king was thus distressed by the obstinacy of the commons, he felt a much severer blow by the death of his favourite, the duke of Buckingham, who fed a sacrifice of his unpopularity. It had been resolved once more to undertake the raising of the siege of Rochede; and the earl of Denbigh, brother in law to Buckingham, was sent thither, but returned without effecting any thing. In order to repair this disgrace, the duke of Buckingham went in person to Portsmouth, to hurry on another expedition, and to punish such as had endeavoured to defraud the crown of the legal assessments 2). In the general discontent that prevaded against this nobleman, it was dady expected that some severe measures would be resolved on, and he was stigmatized as the tyrant and betrayer of his country. There was one Felton, who caught the general contagion; an Irishman of a good family who had served under the duke as lieutenant, but had resigned, on being refused his rank on the death of his captain, who had been killed at the Isle of Rhe. This man was naturady melancholy, courageous, and enthusiastic, he felt for his coun- 1) The King's or Queen's Bench is the supreme court of common law.

He therefore resolved to kid the duke, and thus revenge his own private injuries, while he did service also to God and man. Animated in this manner with gloomy zeal and mistaken patriotism, he travelled down to Portsmouth alone, and entered the town whde the duke was surrounded by his levee x), and giving out the neces sary orders for embarkation. While he was speaking to one of his colonels, Felton struck him over an officer's shoulder in the breast with his knife. The duke had only time to say \u201eThe vidian has lulled me\" when he fed at the colonel's feet, and instantly expired. No one had seen the blow, nor the person who gave it, but a hat being picked up, on the inside of which was sewed a paper containing four or five lines of the remonstrance of the commons against the duke, it was concluded that this hat must belong to the assassm ; and while they were employed in conjectures whose it should be, a man without a hat was seen walking very composedly before the door, and was heard to cry out \u201eI am he\". He disdained denying a murder in which he gloried, and averred that he looked upon the duke as an enemy to his country, and as such deserving to suffer. When asked at whose instigation he had perpetrated that horrid deed, he answered, that they need not trouble themselves in that inquiry ; that his conscience was his only prompter, and that no man on earth could dis pose him to act against its dictates. He suffered with the same degree of constancy to the last; nor were there many wanting, who admired not only his fortitude, but the action for which he suffered. The king's first measure, now being left without a minister and a pardament, was a prudent one. He made peace with the two crowns against whom he had hitherto waged war, which had been entered upon without necessity, and conducted without glory. Being freed from these embarrassements , he bent his whole attention to the management of the internal podcy of the kingdom, and took two men as his associates in this task, 1) A French word signifying the time of rising; whence, a morning assembly of visitors, die Morgenaufwartung."], [167, "153 who still acted an underpart to himself. There were Sir Thomas Wentworth, afterwards created earl of Strafford; and Laud, afterwards archbishop of Canterbury. Whde Laud, therefore, during the long interval, ruled the church, the lung and Strafford undertook to manage the tem poral interests of the nation. A declaration was dispersed, implying, that during this reign no more parliaments would be summoned; and every measure of the king but too well ser ved to confirm the suspicion. Tonnage and poundage were continued to be levied by royal authority alone; custom-house officers received orders from*the councd to enter any house whatever, in search of suspected goods; compositions were openly made with papists; and their religion was become a regular part of the revenue. The high-commission court1) exercised its power, independant of any law, upon several bold innovators in liberty, who only gloried in their sufferings, and contributed to render govern ment odious and contemptible. Prynn, a barrister of Lincoln's inn2), Burton, a divine, and Bartwick, a physician, were tried before this tribunal for schismatical libels 3) , in which they attacked, with great severity, and intemperate zeal, the cere monies of the church of England. They were condemned to be pilloried, to lose then\" ears, and to pay 5000 pounds to the king. Every year, every month, every day, gave fresh instances, during this long intermission of parliaments, of the resolution of the court to throw them off for ever; but the levying of ship-money, as it was caded, being a general burden, was universady complained of as a national grievance. This was the tax which had, in former reigns, been levied without the consent of pardament; but then the exigency of the state demanded such a supply. John Hampden, a gentleman of 1) Der Gerichtshof der hohen Commission 2) The law is studied in England at the Inns of court. These are spacious old buildings almost entirely inhabited by barristers.

He had been rated at 20 shdlings for his estate, which he refused to pay; and the case was argued 12 days in the Exchequer chamber J), before ad the judges of England. The nation regarded, with the utmost anxiety, the result of a trial that was to fix limits of the king's power. All the judges, four only excepted, gave sentence in favour of the crown ; while Hampden, who lost his cause, was more than sufficiently recompensed by the applauses of the people. The discontent and opposition which the king met with in maintaining episcopacy among his English subjects, might, one would think, hinder him from attempting to introduce it among those of Scotland, where it was generally hateful. Having published an order for reading the dturgy in the principal church in Edinburgh, the people received it with clamours and imprecations. The seditious disposition in that kingdom, which had hitherto been kept within bounds, was now too furious for restrain; the insurrection became general over ad the country and the Scots flew to arms with great animosity. Yet stdl the king could not think of desisting from his design; and so propossessed was he in favour of royal right, that he thought the very name of king, when forcibly urged, would induce them to return to their duty. Instead, therefore, of fighting with his opponents, he entered upon a treaty with them; so that a suspension of arms was soon agreed upon, and a treaty of peace concluded, which neither side intended to observe ; and then both parties agreed to disband their forces. After much alternation, and many treaties signed and broken, both parties once more had recourse to arms, and nothing but blood could satiate the contenders. War being thus resolved on, the king took every method as before for raising money to support it. Ship-money was levied as usual; some other arbitrary taxes were exacted from the rebutant people with great severity, but these were far 1) Schatzkammer, Finanzkammer."], [169, "155 from being sufficient ; and there now remained only one method more, the long neglected method of a pardamentary supply. The new house of commons, however, could not be induced to treat the Scots, who were of the same principles with them selves, and contending against the same ceremonies, as enemies to the state. They regarded them as friends and brothers, who first rose to teach them a duty it was incumbent on all virtuous mnrds to imitate. The king, therefore, could reap no other fruits from this assembly than murmurings and complaints. Every method he had taken to supply himself with money was declared an abuse, and a breach of the constitution; so that, finding no hopes of a compdance with his request, but recrimina tion instead of redress, he once more dissolved the pariia ment, to try more feasible methods of removing his necessities. His necessities, however, continuing, that parliament was called, which did not cease sitting tid they overturned the con stitution. Without any interval, they entered upon business; and by unanimous consent, they struck a blow that might be regarded as decisive. Instead of granting the demanded sub sidies, they impeached1) the earl of Strafford, the king's first minister, and had him arraigned before the house of peers for high treason. After a long and eloquent speech, delivered without premeditation, in which he confuted all the accusations of his enemies, he was found guilty by both houses of parlia ment; and nothing remained but for the king to give his con sent to the bill of attainder. Charles who loved Strafford tenderly, hesitated, and seemed reluctant, trying every expedient to put off so dreadful a duty as that of signing the warrant 1) Impeachment by the commons is a proceeding which in modern times it has rarely been resorted to, but which in former periods of the English history was of frequent occurrence. An outline of the forms observed in the conduct of impeachments may be briefly given. A member of the House of Commons charges the accused of certain high crimes and misdemeanors, and moves that he be impeached. If the house agree to it, the member is ordered to go to the lords , and at their bar,_ to impeach the accused. A committee is then ordered to draw up articles of impeachment, which are reported to the house, and having been dis cussed and agreed upon, are engrossed and delivered to the lords. The accused sends answers to each article. After these preliminaries , the lords appoint a day for the trial, and then proceed to judgment."], [170, "156 for his execution. While he continued in this agitation of mind, not knowing how to act, his doubts were at last sdenced by an act of heroic bravery in the condemned lord. He re ceived a letter from that unfortunate nobleman, desiring that his hfe might be made the sacrifice of a mutual reconciliation between the king and his people; adding, that he was pre pared to die, and to a wdling mind there coidd be no injury. This instance of noble generosity was but id repaid by his master, who complied with his request. He consented to the signing the fatal bill; Strafford was beheaded on Tower hid, behaving with all that composed dignity of resolution that was expected from his character. In this universal rage for punishment, the pardament fell with great justice on two courts, which had been erected, under arbitrary kings, and had seldom been employed but in cases of necessity. These were, the high-commission court, and the court of star-chamber. A bill unanimously passed the houses to abolish both; and in them to annihilate the principal and most dangerous articles in the king's prerogative. In the midst of these troubles the papists of Ireland fan cied they found a convenient opportunity for throwing off the English yoke, and accordingly resolved to cut off all the pro testants of that kingdom at a stroke ; so that neither age, sex, nor condition received any pity. In such indiscriminate slaughter, neither former benefits, nor alliances, nor authority, were any protection ; numberless were the instances of friends murdering their intimates, relations their kinsmen, and servants their masters. In vain did dight save from the first assault; des truction, that had an extensive spread, met the hunted victims at every turn. The king took all the precautions in his power to shew his uffer detestation of these bloody proceedings ; and being sensible of his own inabdity to suppress the rebellion, had once more recourse to his English parliament, and craved their assistance; many insinuations were thrown out that he had himself fomented this rebellion, and no money could be spared for the extinction of distant dangers, when they pre tended that the kingdom was threatened with greater at home."], [171, "157 It was now that the republican spirit began to appear, without any disguise, in the present parliament; and that party, instead of attacking the faults of the king, resolved to destroy monarchy. The leaders of the opposition began their operations by a resolution to attack episcopacy, which was one of the strongest bulwarks of the royal power. They accused 13 bishops of high treason, for enacting canons without the consent of par- liament and endeavoured to prevail upon the house of peers to exclude ad the prelates from their seats and votes in that august assembly. The bishops saw the storm that was gather- ing against them and probably, to avert its effects, they re- solved to attend their duty in the house of lords no' longer. This was a fatal blow to the royal interest; but it soon felt a much greater from the king's own imprudence. Charles had long suppressed his resentment, and only strove to satisfy the commons by the greatness of his concessions; but, finding that all his compliance had but increased their demands, he could no longer retain it. He gave orders to Herbert, his attorney general1), to enter an accusation of high treason, in the house of peers, against lord Kimbolton , one of the most popular men of his party, together with 5 commoners, Sir Arthur Haslerig, Hollis, Hampden, Pym, and Strode. The articles were, that they had traitorously endeavoured to subvert the fundamental laws and government of the kingdom; to deprive the king of his regal powers, and to impose on his subjects an arbitrary and tyrannical authority. Men had scarce leisure to wonder at the precipitancy and imprudence of this impeachment, when they were astonished by another measure, still more rash and unsupported. The next day the king him- self was seen to enter the house of commons alone, advancing through the hall, while all the members stood up to receive him. The speaker withdrew from the chair, and the king took possession of it. Having seated himself, and looked round for some time, he told the house that he was sorry for the occasion that had forced him hither; that he was come in person to seize the members whom he had accused of high treason, 1) Kronanwalt, Generalfiscal."], [172, "158 seeing they would not dedver them up to his serjeant at arms l). He then sat for some time to see if the accused were present ; but they had escaped a few minutes before his entry. Thus disappointed, perplexed, and not knowing on whom to rely, he next proceeded, amidst the clamours of the populace, who continued to cry out \u201ePrivilege! Privilege!\" to the common council 2) of the city, and made his complaint to them.

Being returned to Windsor, he began to reflect on the rashness of his former proceedings ; and now, too late, resolved to make some atonement. He therefore wrote to the parlia ment, informing them that he desisted from his former pro ceedings against the accused members ; and assured them that, upon all occasions, he would be as careful of their privileges as of his dfe or his crown. Thus, his former violence had rendered him hateful to his commons, and his present sub mission now rendered him contemptible. The power of appointing generals, and levying armies, was still a remaining prerogative of the crown. The commons having therefore first magnified their terrors of popery, which, perhaps, they actuady dreaded, they proceeded to petition that the Tower might be put into their hands, and that Hud, Portsmouth, and the fleet should be entrusted to persons of their choosing. These were requests, the complying with which levelled all that remained of the ancient constitution; however, such was the necessity of the times, that they were at first contested, and then granted. At last, every compliance only increased the avidity of maknig fresh demands : the commons 1) Stabtrager.

It was here that Charles first ventured to put a stop to his concessions and being urged to give up the command of the army for an appointed time, he was so exasperated that he exclaimed, \u201eNo, not for an hour.\" This peremptory refusal broke off all further treaty; and both sides were now resolved to have recourse to arms. No period, since England began, could show so many in stances of courage, abdities, and virtue, as the present fatal opposition called forth into exertion. Now was the time, when talents of ad kinds, unchecked by authority, were called from the lower ranks of dfe to dispute for power and pre-eminence. Manifestoes on the one side and the other, were now dispersed throughout the whole kingdom; and the people were universally divided between two factions, distinguished by the names of Cavaders and Roundheads x). The knrg's forces ap peared in a very low condition ; besides the train-bands 2) of the county, raised by Sir John Digby, the sheriff, he had not got together 300 infantry.

However, he was soon gradually reinforced from ad quarters; but not being then in a condition to face his enemies, he thought it prudent to retire by slow marches to Derby, and thence to Shrewsbury, in order to countenance the levies which his friends were making in those quarters. In the mean time, the pardament was not remiss in pre parations on their side. They had a magazine of arms at Hud, and Sir John Hotham was appointed governor of that place by parliament. The forces also, which had been every where raised, on pretence of the service of Ireland, were now more openly enlisted by the parliament for then- own purpose, and the command given to the earl of Essex, a bold man, 1) Cavaliers, partizans of the king.

Edge -hill was the first place where the two armies were put in array agamgst each other, and the country drenched in civd slaughter. It was a dreadful sight, to see above 30,000 of the bravest men in the world, instead of employing their courage abroad, turning against each other, whde the dearest friends and nearest kinsmen embraced opposite sides, and prepared to bury their private regards in factious hatred. After an engagement of some hours, animosity seemed to be wearied out, and both sides separated with equal loss. 5000 men are said to have been found dead on the field of battle. It woidd be tedious, and no way instructive, to enter into the marchings and counter- marchings of these undiscipdned and ill-conducted armies ; war was a new trade to the English, as they had not seen a hostile engagement in the island for near a century before. The queen came to reinforce the royal party; she had brought soldiers and ammunition from Holland, and immediately departed to furnish more. But the parliament, who knew its own consequence and strength, was no way discouraged. Their demands seemed to increase in proportion to their losses; and as they were repressed in the field, they grew more haughty in the cabinet. Such governors as gave up their fortresses tojhe king, were attainted of high treason. It was in vain for the king to send proposals after any success; this only raised their pride and their animosity. But though this desire in the king to make peace with his subjects, was the highest encomium on his humanity, yet his long negotia tions, one of which he carried on at Oxfond, were faulty as a warrior. He wasted that time in altercation and treaty, which he should have employed in vigorous exertions in the field. However his first campaign, upon the whole, were a favour able aspect. One victory fodowed after another. Cornwall was reduced to peace and obedience under the king ; a victory was gained over the parliamentarians1), at Stratton Hid, in 1) Parlamentarier, those who sided with the Parliament against the king."], [175, "161 Devonshire ; another at Roundway Down, about two miles from Devizes; and a third at Chalgrave Field. Bristol was besieged and taken, and Gloucester was invested; the battle of Newbury was favourable to the royal cause; and great hopes of success M'ere formed from an army in the North, raised by the marquis of Newcastle. In this campaign, the two bravest and greatest men of their respective parties were kided, as if it was intended, by the kindness of Providence, that they should be exempted from seeing the miseries and the slaughter which were shortly to ensue : these were John Hampden and Lucius Gary, lord Falk land; the first in the skirmish against prince Rupert; the other in the battle of Newbury, which followed shortly after. Hampden , who we have seen in the beginning of these troubles, refused to pay the ship-money, gained by his inflexible integrity, the esteem even of his enemies. To this he added affability in conversation, temper, art, eloquence in debate, and penetration in council. Falkland was still a greater loss, and greater character. He added to Hampdon's severe principles, a politeness and elegance, but then beginning to be known in England. He had boldly withstood the king's pretensions while he saw him making a bad use of his power; but when he perceived the design of the parliament to overturn the religion and the constitution of his country, he changed his side, and stedfastly attached himself to the crown. From the beginning of the civil war, his natural cheerfulness and vivacity forsook him, he became melancholy, sad, pale, and negligent of his person, and seemed to wish for death. His usual cry among his friends, after a deep silence, and frequent sighs, was, \u201ePeace ! Peace!\" He now said, upon the morning of the engagement, that he was weary of the times, and should leave them before night. He was shot by a musket-bull in the belly; and his body was next morning found among a heap of slain. His writings, his elegance, his justice, and his courage, deserved such a death of glory, and they found it. The king that he might make preparations, during the winter, for the ensuing campaign, and to oppose the design of the Westminster parliament, called one at Oxford ; and this was the first time that England saw two parliaments sitting at the 11"], [176, "162 same time. His house of peers was pretty full, his house of commons consisted of about 140, which amounted to not above half of the other house of commons. From this shadow of a parliament he received some suppdes, after which it was pro rogued, and never after assembled. In the mean time the pardament was equally active on their side. They passed an ordinance, commanding ad the inhabitants of London and its neighbourhood to retrench a meal a week, and to pay the value of it for the support of the pubdc cause. But, what was much more effectual, the Scots, who considered their claims as simflar, led a strong body to their assistance. They levied an army of 14,000 men in the East, under the earl of Manchester; they had an army of 10,000 men under Essex, another of nearly the same force, under Sir William Waller. These were superior to any force the king could bring into the field; and were wed appointed with ammunition^, provisions, and pay. Hostidties, which even during the winter season, had never been whody discontinued, were renewed in spring with their usual fury, and served to desolate the kingdom, without a deciding victory. Each county joined that side, to which it was ad dicted from motives of conviction, interest, or fear, though some observed a perfect neutradty. Several frequently petitioned for peace, and all the wise and good were earnest in the cry. What particularly deserves remark, was an attempt of the women of London, who, to the number of 2 or 3000, went in a body to the house of commons, earnestly demanding a peace. \u201eGive us those traitors,\" said they, \u201ethat are against a peace; give them, that we may tear them to pieces.\" The guards found some difficulty in queding this insurrection, and one or two women lost their dves in the fray. The battle of Marston Moor was the beginning of the king's misfortunes and disgrace. The Scots and parliamentarian army had joined, and were besieging York, when prince Rupert, joined by the marquis of Newcastle, determined to raise the siege. Both sides drew upon Marston Moor, to the number of 50,000, and the victory seemed long undecided between them. Rupert, who commanded the right wing of the royalists, was opposed by Odver Cromwed, who now first came into notice,"], [177, "163 at the head of a body of troops whom he had taken care to levy and discipline. Cromwell was victorious; he pushed his opponents off the field, followed the vanquished, returned to a second engagement and a second victory; the prince's whole train of artillery was taken, and the royalists never after re covered the blow. William Laud, archbishop of Canterbury, was sent to the Tower in the beginning of this reign. He was now brought to his trial, condemned, and executed. And it was a melancholy consideration, that, in these times of trouble, the best men on either side were those who chiedy suffered. The death of Laud was followed by a total alteration in the ceremonies of the church. The liturgy was, by a public act, abolished the day he died, as if he had been the only obstacle to its former removal. The church of England was, in all respects, brought to a conformity to the puritanical establishment; while the citizens of London, and the Scots army, gave pubdc thanks for so happy an alteration. The well-disputed battle, which decided the fate of Charles, was faught at Naseby, a village in Northamptonshire. The main body of the royal army was commanded by lord Astley, prince Rupert led the right wing, Sir Marmaduke Langdale the left, and the king himself headed the body of reserve. On the opposite side, Fairfax and Skippon commanded the main body, Cromwell led on the right wing, and Ireton, his son-in law, the left. Prince Rupert attacked the left wing with his usual impetuosity and success; they were broke, and pursued as far as the village; but he lost time in attempting to make himself master of their artillery. Cromwell, in the mean time, was equally successful on his side, and broke through the enemy's horse, after a very obstinate resistance. While these were thus engaged, the infantry on both sides maintained the conflict with equal ardour, but in spite of the efforts of Fairfax and Skippon, their battalions began to give way. At this critical period, Cromwell returned with his victorious forces, and charged the king's infantry in flank with such vigour, that a total rout began to ensue. By this time, prince Rupert had rejoined the king, and the small body of reserve; but his troops, though victorious, could not be brought to a second 11*"], [178, "164 charge. The king, perceiving the battle wholly lost, was obliged to abandon the field to his enemies, who took all his cannon, baggage, and above 50000 prisoners. The battle of Naseby put the pardamentarians in posses sion of almost ad the strong cities of the kingdom, Bristol, Bridgewater, Chester, Sherborne, and Bath. Exeter was besieged ; and all the king's troops in the western counties being entirely dispersed, Fairfax pressed the place and it surrendered at discretion. The king, thus surrounded, harrassed on every side, retreated to Oxford, that, in all conditions of his fortune, had held steady to his cause; and there he resolved to offer new terms to his incensed pursuers. In the mean time, Fairfax was approaching with a power ful and victorious army, and was taking the proper measures for laying siege to Oxford, which promised an easy surrender. To be taken captive, and led in triumph by his insolent sub jects, was what Charles justly abhorred; and every insult and violence was to be dreaded from the soldiery, who had felt the effects of his opposition. In this desperate extremity, he embraced a measure which, in any other situation, might justly lie under the imputation of imprudence and indiscretion. He took the fatal resolution of giving himself up to the Scots army, who had never testified such implacable animosity against him; but he too soon found, that, instead of treating him as a king, they insulted him as a captive. The English parliament being informed of the king's captiv ity, immediately entered into a treaty with the Scots about delivering up their prisoner. This was soon adjusted. They agreed, that, upon payment of 400,000 pounds, they would deliver up the king to his enemies and this was cheerfully complied with. An action so atrocious may be padiated, but can never be defended; the returned home laden with plunder, and the reproaches of all good men. The civd war was now over, the kmg had absolved his followers from their adegiance, and the parliament had now no enemy to fear, except those very troops, by which they had extended their overgrown authority. But in proportion as the terror of the king's power diminished, the divisions between the members which composed the parliament became more"], [179, "165 apparent. The majority in the house were of the presbyterian sect, who were for having clergy; but the majority of the army were staunch independents, who admitted of no clergy, but thought that every man had a right to instruct his fellows x). At the head of this sect was Cromwell, who secretly directed its operations, and invigorated all their measures. Oliver Cromwell, whose talents now began to appear in full lustre, was the son of a private gentleman of Huntingdon ; but, being the son of a second brother, he inherited a very small paternal fortune. From accident or intrigue he was chosen member for the town of Cambridge in the long parlia ment ; but he seemed at first to possess no talents for oratory, his person being ungraceful, his dress slovenly, his elocution homely, tedious, obscure, and embarrassed. He made up, however, by zeal and perceverance , what he wanted in natural powers, and being endowed with unshaken intrepidity, much dissimil ation, and a thorough conviction of the rectitude of his cause, he rose, through the gradations of preferment, to the post of lieutenant-general under Fairfax ; but, in reality, possessing the supreme command over the whole army. The army now began to consider themselves as a body distinct from the commonwealth; and complained that they had secured the general tranquillity, while they were at the same time deprived of the privdeges of Engdshmen. In op position, therefore, to the parliament at Westminster, a military parliament was formed, composed of the officers and common soldiers of each regiment. The principal officers formed a council to represent the body of peers ; the soldiers elected two men out of each company to represent the house of commons, and these were caded the agitators of the army. Cromwell took care to be one of the number, and thus confrived an easy method under-hand of conducting and promoting the sedition of the army. The unhappy king, in the mean time, continued a prisoner at Holmby castle; and as his countenance might add some authority to the side which should obtain it, Cromwell, who 1) An independent, one who in religious affairs holds that every congregation is a complete church subject to no superior authority."], [180, "166 secretly conducted all the measures of the army, while he ap parently exclaimed against their violence, resolved to seize the king's person. Accordingly a party of 500 horse appearing at Holmby castle, under the command of one Joyce, conducted the king to the army, who were hastening to their rendezvous at Triplow-heath , near Cambridge. The next day, Cromwed arrived among them, where he was received with acclamations of joy, and was instantly invested with the supreme command. The House of Commons was now divided into parties, as usual, one part opposing, but the minority, with the two speakers at them head, encouraging the army. In such a univer-ai con fusion, it is not to be expected that anything less than a separation of the parties could take place; and accordingly, the two speakers, with 62 members, secretly retired from the house, and threw themselves under the protection of the army, which was then at Hounslow - heath. They were received with shouts and acclamations, their integrity was extolled, and the whole body of the soldiery, a formidable force of 20,000 men, now moved forward to reinstate them in their former seats and stations. In the mean time, that part of the house which was left behind, resolved to act with vigour, and resist the encroach ments of the army. They chose new speakers; they gave orders for enlisting troops; they ordered the train-bands to man the lines, and the whole city boldly resolved to resist the invasion. But this resolution only held whde the enemy was thought at a distance ; for when the formidable force of Crom wed appeared, ad was obedience and submission; the gates were opened to the general, who attended the two speakers, and the rest of the members, peaceably to their habitations. The eleven impeached members, being accused as causers of the tumult, were expelled, and most of them retired to the Continent. The mayor, sheriff and 3 aldermen x), were sent to the Tower, several citizens and officers of militia were com mitted to prison, and the dnes about the city were levelled to the ground. The command of the Tower was given to Fairfax, 1) Alderman , the member of a town or city corporation , Eathsherr."], [181, "167 the general ; and the parliament ordered him their hearty thanks for having disobeyed their commands. It now only remained to dispose of the king, who had been sent by the army a prisoner to Hampton Court; from whence he attempted to escape, but was once more made prisoner in the Isle of Wight, and confined in Carisbrook Castle. Whde the king continued in this forlorn situation, the parliament, new-modeded as it was by the army, was every day growing more feeble and factious. He still therefore con tinued to negotiate with the parliament for settling the un speakable calamities of the kingdom. The parliament saw no other method of destroying the midtary power, but to depress it by the kingly ; and frequent proposals for an accommodation passed between the captive king and the commons. But it was now too late, their power was soon totally to expire; for the rebellious army, crowned with success, was returned from the destruction of their enemies; and sensible of their own power, with furious remonstrances, began to demand vengeance on their king. At the same time they advanced to Windsor ; and sending an officer to seize the king's person, where he was lately sent under confinement, they con- veyed him to Hurst Castle, in Hampsldre, opposite the Isle of Wight. The commons, however, though destitute of all hopes of prevailing, had still courage to resist, and attempted, in the face of the whole army, to close their treaty with the king. But the next day colonel Pride, at the head of two regiments, blockaded the house, and seized in the passage 41 members of the presbyterian party, and sent them to a low room be- longing to the house, that passed by the denomination of Hell. Above a 160 members more were excluded; and none were allowed to enter but the most furuios and determined of the independents, in all not exceeding 60. This atrocious invasion of the parliamentary rights commonly passed by the name of Pride's Purge, and the remaining members were caded the Rump. These soon voted that the transactions of the house, a few days before, were entirely illegal, and that them general's conduct was just and necessary. A committee was appointed to bring in a charge against"], [182, "168 the lung; and a vote passed, declaring it treason in a king to levy war against his parliament. A high court of justice was accordingly appointed to try his majesty for this new invented treason. Colonel Harrison, the son of a butcher, was commanded to conduct the king from Hurst Castle to Windsor, and from thence to London. His afflicted subjects, who ran to have a sight of their sovereign, were greatly affected at the change that appeared in his face and person. He had allowed his beard to grow; his hair was become venerably grey, rather through the pressure of anxiety than the hand of time; while his apparel bore the marks of misfortune and decay. Thus he stood a solitary figure of majesty in distress, which even his adversaries could not behold without reverence and compassion. He had been long attended only by an old decrepit servant, whose name was Sir Philip Warwick , who could only deplore his master's fate, without being able to revenge his cause. All the exterior symbols of sovereignty were now withdrawn; and his new attendants had orders to serve him without ceremony. The duke of Hamilton-who was reserved for the same punish ment with his master, having leave to take a last farewell as he departed from Windsor, threw himself at the king's feet, crying out, \u201eMy dear master.\" The unhappy monarch raised him up, embracing him tenderly, replied, while the tears ran down his cheeks, ,,I have indeed been a dear master to you.\" These were severe distresses, however, he could not be persuaded that his adversaries would bring him to a formal trial, but he every moment expected to be dispatched by private assas sination. From the 6th to the 20'1' of January was spent in making preparations for this extraordinary trial. The court of justice consisted of 133 persons, named by the commons; but of these never above 70 sat upon the trial. The members were chieflv composed of the principal officers of the army, most of them of every mean birth, together with some of the lower house, and a few citizens of London. Bradshaw, a lawyer, was chosen president; Coke was appointed solicitor1) for the people of 1) Anwalt."], [183, "169 England; Dorislaus, Steele, and Aske were named assistants. The court sat in Westminster-hall. The king was now conducted from Windsor to St. James's l), and the next day was brought before the high court to take his trial. When he was brought forward, he was conducted by the mace - bearer 2) to a chair placed within the court. Though long detained a prisoner, and now produced as a crim inal , he still sustained the dignity of a king, he surveyed the members of the court with a stern and haughty air; and without moving his hat, sat down, while the members also were covered. His charge was then read by the solicitor, accusing him of having been the cause of all the bloodshed which followed since the commencement of the war; at that part of the charge, he could not suppress a smile of contempt and indignation. After the charge was finished, Bradshaw directed his discourse to the king, and told him that the court expected his answer. The king with great temper entered upon his defence by denying the authority of the court. He represented that, having been engaged in treaty with his two houses of par liament, and having finished almost every article, he expected a different treatment from that he now received. He perceived, he said, no appearance of an upper house, which was neces sary to constitute a just tribunal. That he was himself the king and fountain of law, and, consequently, could not be tried by laws, to which he had never given his assent ; that, having been entrusted with the liberties of the people, he would not now betray them by recognizing a power founded in usur pation ; that he was widing, before a proper tribunal , to enter into the particulars of his defence, but that, before them, he must decline any apology for his innocence, lest he should he considered as the betrayer of, and not a martyr for, the con stitution. Bradshaw, in order to support the authority of the court, insisted, that they had received their power from the people, 1) St. James's palace. 2) Mace-bearer, who carries the mace (an ensign of authority) before magistrates, Sceptertriiger."], [184, "170 the source of ad right. He pressed the prisoner not to decdne the authority of the court, which was delegated by the com mons of England, and interrupted and over-ruled the king in his attempts to reply. The conduct of the king, under all the instances of low-bred madce, was great, firm, and equal: in going through the hall from this execrable tribunal, the soldiers and rabble were instigated to cry out : Justice ! Execution ! They reviled him with the most bitter reproaches. Among other insults, one miscreant presumed to spit in the face of his sovereign. He patiently bore their insolence. \u201ePour souls!\" cried he, \u201ethey would treat their generals in the same manner for sixpence.\" Those of the populace who stid retained the feelings of humanity, expressed their sorrows and sighs and tears. A soldier, more compassionate than the rest, could not help imploring a blessing upon his royal head. An officer overhearing him, struck the honest centinel to the ground be fore the king, who could not help saying, that the punishment exceeded the offence. At his return to Whitehall, he desired the permission of the house to see his chddren, and to be attended in his private devotions by doctor Juxon, late bishop of London. These requests were granted, and also 3 days to prepare for the execution of the sentence. All that remained of his famdy now in England, were the princess Elizabeth, and the duke of Gloucester, a child of about 3 years of age. After many sea sonable and sensible exhortations to his daughter, he took his little son in his arms, and embracing him, \u201eMy child, said he, they wid cut off thy father's head: yes, they will cut off my head, and make thee a king. But mark what I say: thou must not be a king as long as thy brothers, Charles and James, are. adve. They will cut off their heads when they can take them, and thy head, too, they will .cut off at last; and therefore, I charge thee, do not be made a king by them.\" The child, bursting into tears, replied, \u201eI wdl be torn in pieces first.\" Every night during the interval between his sentence and execution, the king slept as sound as usual, though the noise"], [185, "171 of the workmen, employed in framing the scaffold, continually resounded in his ears. The fatal morning being at last arrived, he rose early, and calling one of his attendants, he bade him employ more than usual care in dressing him and preparing him for so great and joyful a solemnity. The street before Whitehall was the place destined for his execution; for it was intended that this should increase the severity of his punishment. He was led through the banquetting-house to the scaffold, adjoining to that edifice, attended by his friend and servant, bishop Juxon, a man endowed with the same mild and steady virtues as his master. The scaffold, which was covered with black, was guarded by a regiment of soldiers, under the command of colonel Tomlinson, and on it were to be seen the block, the axe, and two executioners in masks. The people, in great crown, stood at a greater distance, in dreadful expectation of the event. The king surveyed ad these solemn preparations with calm composure; and as he could not expect to be heard by the people at a distance, he addressed himself to the few persons who stood round him. He there justified his own innocence in the late fatal war; and observed, that he had not taken arms tdl after the parliament had shown him the example. That he had no other object in his warlike preparations than to preserve that authority entire which had been transmitted to him by his ancestors; but, though innocent towards the people, he acknowledged the equity of his execution in the eyes of his Maker. He owned that he was justly punished for having consented to the execution of an unjust sentence upon the earl of Strafford. He forgave ad his enemies, exhorted the people to return to their obedience, and acknowledge his son as his successor; and signified his attachemnt to the protestant religion, as professed in the church of England. So strong was the impression his dying words made upon the few who could hear him, that colonel Tomlinson himself, to whose care he had been committed, acknowledged himself a convert. While he was preparing himself for the block, bishop Juxon called out to him, \u201eThere is, Sir, but one stage more, which, though turbulent and troublesome, is yet a very short one. It will soon carry you a great way. It will carry you"], [186, "172 from earth to heaven, and there you shad find, to your great joy, the prize to which you hasten, a crown of glory.\" ,,I go,\" replied the king, from a corruptible to an incorruptible crown, where no disturbance can have place.\" \u201eYou exchange,\" replied the bishop, \u201ea temporary for an eternal crown ; a good exchange.\" Charles having taken off his cloak, delivered his George to the prelate, pronouncing the word \u201eRemember.\" Then he laid his neck on the block, and, stretching out his hands as a signal, one of the executioners severed his head from his body at a blow, while the other, holding it up, exclaimed, \u201eThis is the head of a traitor !\" The spectators testified their horror of the sad spectacle in sighs, tears, and lamentations; the tide of their duty and affection began to return , and each - blamed himself either with active disloyalty to his king, or a passive com pliance with his destroyers. Charles was executed in the 49th year of his age and the 24\"' of his reign. He was of a middling stature, robust, and well-proportioned. His visage was pleasing, but melancholy; but it is probable that the continual troubles in which he was involved might have made that impression on his countenance. As for his character, the reader will deduce it with more precision and satisfaction to himself, from the detail of his conduct, than from any summary given of it by the historian. The Commonwealth. Cromwed, who had secretly solicited and contrived the king's death, now began to feel wishes to which he had been hitherto a stranger. His prospects widening as he rose, his first principles of liberty were all lost in the unbounded stretch of power that lay before him. Having been appointed to command the army in Ireland, he prosecuted the war in that kingdom with his usual effect. He had to combat against the royadsts, commanded by the duke of Ormond, and the native Irish, led on by O'Neal. But such dl-connected and barbarous troops could give very little opposition to Cromwed's more numerous forces, conducted by such a general, and emboldened by long success. He soon overran the whole country ; and, after some time, all the towns"], [187, "173 revolted in his favour, and opened then- gates at his approach. But, in these conquests, as in all the rest of his actions, there appeared a brutal ferocity, that would tarnish the most heroic valour. In order to intimidate the natives from defending their towns, he, with a barbarous podcy, put every garrison that made any resistance to the sword. After his return to England, upon taking his seat, he received the thanks of the house, by the mouth of the Speaker, for the services he had done the commonwealth in Ireland. They then proceeded to deliberate upon choosing a general for conducting the war in Scotland, where they had espoused the royal cause, and placed young Charles, the son of their late monarch, on the throne. Fairfax refusing this command upon principal, as he had ad along declined opposing the presby terians, the command necessarily devolved upon Cromwell, who boldly set forward for Scotland, at the head of an army of 16,000 men. The Scots, in the mean time, who had invited over their wretched king to be a prisoner, not a ruler among them, pre pared to meet the invasion. A battle ensued, in which they, though double the number of the English, were soon put to flight, and pursued with great slaughter; while Cromwell did not lose above 40 men in all. In this terrible exigence, young Charles embraced a reso lution, worthy a prince who was willing to hazard all for empire. Observing that the way was open to England, he resolved immediately to march into that country, where he expected to be reinforced by ad the royadsts in that part of the kingdom. But he soon found himself disappointed in the expectation of increasing his army. The Scots, terrified at the prospect of so hazardous an enterprise, fed from him in great numbers. The English, affrighted at the name of his opponent, dreaded to join him; but his mortifications were still more increased as he arrived at Worcester, when informed that Cromwed was inarching with hasty strides from Scotland, with an army in creased to 40,000 men. The news scarce arrived, when that active general himself appeared, and falhng upon the town on all sides, broke in upon the disordered royalists. The streets"], [188, "174 were strewed with slaughter; the whole Scots army was either killed or taken prisoners; and the king himself, having given many proofs of personal valour, was obliged to fly. Imagination can scarce conceive adventures more romantic, or distresses more severe, than those which attended the young king's escape from the scene of slaughter. After various escapes, and 41 days' concealment, he landed safely at Feschamp, in Normandy ; no less than 40 men and women having, at different times, been privy to his escape. In the mean time, Cromwed crowned with success, returned in triumph to London, where he was met by the speaker of the house, accompanied by the mayor of London and the magistrates in all their formalities. His first care was to take advantage of his late success, by depressing the Scots, who had so lately withstood the work of the gospel, as he caded it. An act was passed for abodshing royality in Scotland, and annexing that kingdom, as a conquered province, to the English commonwealth. It was empowered, however, to send some members to the Engdsh parliament. Judges were ap pointed to distribute justice; and the people of that country, now freed from the tyranny of the ecclesiastics, were not much dissatisfied with their present government. The prudent con duct of Monk, who was left by Cromwell to complete their subjection, served much to reconcile the minds of the people, harrassed with dissensions, of which they never well under stood the cause. In this manner, the English parliament, by the means of Cromwell, spread their uncontested authority over all the British dominions. Ireland was totally subdued hy Ireton and Ludlow. All the settlements in America, that had been declared for the royal cause, were obliged to submit; Jersey, Guernsey, Scilly and the Isle of Man, were brought easily under subjection. Thus mankind saw, with astonishment, a parliament composed of 60 or 70 obscure and illiterate members, governing a great empire with unanimity and success. Without any acknowledged subordination, except a council of state, consisting of 38, to whom all addresses were made, they levied armies, maintained deets, and gave laws to the neighbouring powers of Europe. The finances were managed with economy and exactness."], [189, "175 Few private persons became rich by the plunder of the public : the revenues of the crown, the lands of the bishops, and a tax of 120,000 pounds each months, suppded the wants of the government, and gave vigour to all their proceedings. The parliament having thus reduced their native dominions to perfect obedience, next resolved to chastise the Dutch, who had given but very slight causes of complaint. It happened that one Doctor Dorislaus, who was of the member of the late king's judges, being sent by the pardament at their envoy to Holland, was assassinated by one of the royal party, who had taken refuge there. Some time after, also, Mr. St. John, ap pointed their ambassador to that court, was insulted by the friends of the prince of Orange. These were thought motives sufficient to induce the commonwealth of England to declare war against them. The pardament's chief dependence lay in the activity and courage of Blake, their admiral; who, though he had not embarked in naval command till late in life, yet surpassed all that went before him in courage and dexterity. On the other side, the Dutch opposed to him their famous admiral Van Tromp, to whom they never since produced an equal. Many were the engagements between these celebrated admirals, and various were their successes. Sea-fights in general, seldom prove decisive; and the vanquished are soon seen to make head against the victors. Several dreadful encounters, therefore, rather\" served to show the excellence of the admirals, than to determine their superiority. The Dutch, however, who felt many great disadvantages by the loss of their trade, and by the total suspension of their fisheries, were willing to treat for a peace ; but the parliament gave them a very unfavourable answer. It was the policy of that body to keep their navy on foot as long as they could; rightly judging, that, while the force of the nation was exerted by sea, it would diminish the power of general Cromwell by land, as this was now become very formidable to them. This great aspirer, however, quickly perceived their designs ; and, from the first, saw that they dreaded his growing power, and wished its diminution. All his measures were conducted with a bold inrepidity that marked his character, and he now saw that it was not necessary to wear the mask of sub-"], [190, "176 ordination any longer. Secure \u2014 therefore \u2014 in the attachment of the army, he resolved to make another daring effort; and persuaded the officers to present a petition for payment of arrears, and redress of grievances, which he knew would be rejected by the commons with disdain. The petition was soon drawn up and presented, in which the officers, after demanding their arrears, desired the parliament to consider how many years they had sat; and what professions they had formerly made of their intentions to new-model the house, and establish freedom on the broadest basis. The house was highly offended at the presumption of the army, although they had seen, but too lately, that their own power was wholly founded on that very presumption. They appointed a committee to prepare an act, ordaining, that all persons who presented such petitions, for the future, should be deemed guilty of high treason. To this the officers made a very warm remonstrance, and the parliament as angry a reply; whde the breach between them every moment grew wider. This was what Cromwell had long wished, and had long foreseen. He was sitting in council with his officers, when informed of the subject on which the house was deliberating; upon which he rose up, hi the most seeming fury, and turning to major Vernon, he cried out, that he was compeded to do a thing that made the very hair of his head stand on end. Then hastening to the house with 300 soldiers, and with the marks of violent indignation on his countenance, he entered. Stamping with his foot, which was the signal for the soldiers to enter, the place was immediately fided with armed men. Then, addressnig himself. to the members: \u201eFor shame,\" said he, \u201eget you gone. Give place to honester men ; to those who will more faithfully discharge their trust. You are no longer a pardament : I tell you, you are no longer a parliament : The Lord has done with you.\" Sir Hairy Vane exclaimed against this conduct: \u201eSir Harry\" cried Cromwell, with a land voice, \u201e0! Sir Harry Vane, the Lord deliver me from Sir Harry Vane.\" Taking hold of Martin by the cloak, Thou art an adulterer; to another, Thou art a drunkard; to a third, Thou art a glutton. \u201eIt is you\" continued he to the members \u201ethat have forced me upon this. I have sought the Lord night and"], [191, "177 day, that he would rather slay me, than put me upon this work.\" Then pointing to the mace, \u201eTake away,\" cried he, \u201ethat bawble.\" After which, turning out all the members, and clearing the hall, he ordered the doors to be locked, and put ting the key in his pocket, returned to Whitehall. The persons he pitched upon for his next parliament, were the lowest, meanest, and the most ignorant among the citizens, and the very dregs of the fanatics. He was well apprised, that, during the administration of such a group of characters, he alone must govern, or that they must soon throw up the reins of government, which they were unqualified to guide. Accordingly their practice justified his sagacity. One of them particularly, who was called Praise God Barebones, a canting leather- seller, gave his name to this odd assembly, and it was caded Barebones' parliament. The very vulgar began now to exclaim against so foolish a legislature, and they themselves seemed not insensible of the ridicule which every day was thrown out against them. Ac cordingly, by concert, they met earlier than the rest of their fraternity, and observing to each other that this parliament had sat long enough, they hastened to Cromwell, with Rouse, their speaker, at their head, and into his hands they resigned the authority with which he had invested them. Cromwell accepted their resignation with pleasure , but being told that some of the number were refractory, he sent colonel White to clear the house of such as ventured to remain there. They had placed one Moyer in the chair by the time that the colonel had arrived; and he being asked by the colonel what they did there, Moyer replied gravely, that they were seeking the Lord! \u201eThen you may go elsewhere,\" cried White: \u201efor, to my certain knowledge, the Lord has not been here these many years.\" This shadow of a parliament being dissolved, the officers, by their own authority, declared Cromwed protector of the commonwealth of England. He was to be addressed by the title of Highness, and his power was proclaimed in London, and other parts of the kingdom. Thus an obscure and vulgar man, at the age of 53, rose to unbounded power; first by 12"], [192, "178 fodowing smad events in his favour, and at length by directing great ones. Cromwed chose his council from among his officers, who had been the companions of his dangers and his victories, to each of whom he assigned a pension of one 1000 pounds a year. He took care to have his troops, upon whose fidelity he de pended for support, paid a month in advance; the magazines were also well provided, and the public treasure managed with frugadty and care; while his activity, vigdance, and resolution were such, that he discovered every conspiracy against his person, and every plot for an insurrection, before they took effect. His management of foreign affairs, though his schemes were by, no mean political, yet wed corresponded with his character, and, for a while, were attended with success. The Dutch, having been humbled by repeated defeats, and totally abridged in their commercial concerns, were obliged, at last, to sue for peace, which he gave them upon terms rather too favourable. He insisted upon their paying deference to the British flag: he compeded them to abandon the interest of the king, and to pay 85,000 pounds as an indemnification for former expenses; and to restore the English East India company a part of those dominions, of which they had been dispossessed by the Dutch during the former reign, in that distant part of the world., He was not less successful in his negotiations with the court of France. Cardinal Mazarin, by whom the affairs of that kingdom were conducted, deemed it necessary to pay de ference to the protector; and, desirous rather to prevail by dexterity than violence, submitted to Cromwell's imperious character, and thus procured ends equally beneficial to both. The court of Spain was not less assiduous in its endeavours to gain his friendship, but was not so successful. This vast monarchy, which, but a few years before, had threatened the dberties of Europe, was now reduced so low, as to be scarcely able to defend itself. Cromwell, however, who knew nothing of foreign politics, stid continued to regard its power with an eye of jealousy, and came into an association with France to depress it still more. He lent that court a body of 6000 men to attack the Spanish dominions in the Netherlands ; and, upon"], [193, "179 obtaining a signal victory by his assistance at Dunet, the French put Dunkirk, which they had just taken from the Spaniards, into his hands, as a reward for his attachment. But it was by sea that he humbled the power of Spain with stid more effectual success. Blake, who had long made himself formidable to the Dutch, and whose fame was spread over Europe, now became still more dreaded to the Spanish monarchy. He sailed with a deet into the Mediterranean, whither, since the time of the crusades, no English fleet had ever ventured to advance. He there conquered all that dared to oppose him. Casting anchor before Leghorn, he demanded and obtained satisfaction for some injuries which the English commerce had suffered from the duke of Tuscany. He next sailed to Algiers, and compelled the Dey to make peace, and to restrain his piratical subjects from farther injuring the Eng lish. He then went to Tunis, and, having made the same demands, he was desired by the Dey of that place to look at the two castles, Porto Farino and Goletta, and do his utmost. Blake showed him that he was not slow in accepting the chal lenge; he entered the harbour, burned the shipping there, and then sailed out triumphantly to pursue his voyage. At Cadiz, he took two galleons, valued at near two millions of pieces of eight J). At the Canaries, he burnt a Spanish deet of 16 ships ; and, returning home to England to enjoj^ the fame of his noble actions, as he came within sight of his native country, he expired. This gallant man, though he fought for an usurper, yet was averse to his cause : he was a zealous republican in prin ciple, and his aim was to serve his country, not to establish a tyrant. \u201eIt is stdl our duty,\" he would say to the seamen, \u201eto fight for our country, into whatever hands the government may fall.\" At the same time that Blake's expeditions were going forward, there was another carried on under the command of admirals Penn and Venables, with about 4000 land forces, to attack the island of Hispaniola, Failing, however, in this, and being driven off the place by the Spaniards, they steered for Jamaica, which was surrendered to them without a blow. So 1) A piece of sight , Achterstiick, Achter, Piaster. 12*"], [194, "180 little was thought of the importance of this conquest, that, upon the return of the expedition, Penn and Venables, were sent to the Tower, for their failure in the principal object of their expedition. But it must not be supposed that Cromwed's situation was at this time enviable. Perhaps no station, however mean or loaded with contempt, could be more truly distressful than his, at a time the nation was loading him with congratulations and addresses. He had by this time rendered himself hateful to every party; and he owed his safety to their mutual hatred and diffidence of each other. His arts of dissunulation had been long exhausted; none now could be deceived by them, those of his own party and principles disdaining the use to which he had converted his zeal and professions. The truth seemes to be, if we may use a phrase taken from common life, he had begun with being a dupe to his own enthusiasm, and ended with being a sharper. The whole nation silently detested his administration; but he had not still been reduced to the extreme of wretchedness, if he could have found domestic consolation. Fleetwood, his son-in-law, actuated with the wildest zeal, detested that character which could use religious professions for the purposes of tem poral advancement. His eldest daughter, married to Fleetwood, had adopted repubdcan principles so vehemently that she could not behold even her own father entrusted with uncontrollable power. His other daughters were no less sanguine in favour of the royal cause; but above all, Mrs. Claypole, his favourite daughter, who, upon her death-bed, upbraided him with all those crimes that had led him to trample on the throne. Every hour added som new disquietude. Lord Fairfax, Sir Widiam Waller, and many of the heads of the presbyterians, had secretly entered into an engagement to destroy him. His administration, so expensive both at home and abroad, had exhausted his revenue, and he was left considerably in debt. One conspiracy was no sooner detected, but another rose from its ruins, and to increase his calamity, he was now taught, upon reasoning principles, that his death was not only desirable, but his assassination would be meritorious. A book was pubdshed by colonel Titus, a man who had formerly been"], [195, "181 attached to his cause, entitled, Kdling no Murder. Of ad the pamphlets that came forth at that time, or perhaps of those that have since appeared, this was the most eloquent and masterly. \u201eShall we, (said this popular declaimer) who would not suffer the lion to invade us, tamely stand to be devoured by the wolf?\" Cromwell read this spirited treatise, and was never seen to smile more. All peace was now for ever banished from his mind. He now found, that the grandeur to which he had sacrificed his former peace, was only an inlet to fresh inquietudes. The fears of assassination haunted him in ad his walks, and were perpetuady present to his imagination. He wore armour under his clothes and always kept pistols in his pockets. His aspect was clouded by a settled gloom; and he regarded every stranger with a glance of timid suspicion. He always travelled with hurry, and was ever attended by a numerous guard. He never returned from any place by the road he went; and seldom slept above 3 nights together in the same chamber. Society terrified him, as there he might meet an enemy; solitude was terrible, as he was there unguarded by every friend. A tertian ague x) came kindly at last to deliver him from this dfe of horror and anxieties. For the space of a week no dangerous symptoms appeared; and in the intervals of the fits, he was able to walk abroad. At length the fever increased, and he became delirious. He was just able to answer yes, to the demand whether his son Richard should be appointed to success him. He died on the 3rd of September, that very day which he had always considered as the most fortunate of his life ; he was then 59 years old, and had usurped the government 9 years. Whatever might have been the difference of interest after the death of the usurper, the influence of his name was suf ficient to get Richard, his son, proclaimed protector in his room. But the army, discontented with such a leader, established a meeting at general Fleetwood' s, which, as he dwelt inWallingford house, was called the Cabal of Wallingford. The result of their 1) Tertianfieber, dreitagiges Wechselfieber. Tertian, occurring with one day's interval, so as to make three days, reckoning inclusively."], [196, "182 deliberations was a remonstrance, that the command of the army should be entrusted to some person in whom they might all confide, and it was plainly given to understand, that the young protector was not that person. Richard wanted resolution to defend the title that had been conferred upon him, he soon signed his abdication, and retired to live several years after his resignation, at first on the Con tinent, and afterwards upon his paternal fortune at home. He was thought by the ignorant, to be unworthy of the happiness of his exaltation, but he knew, by his tranquillity in private, that he had made a most fortunate escape. The officers, being once more left to themselves, deter mined to replace the remnant of the old pardament which had heheaded the king, and which Cromwell had so disgracefully turned out of the house. The Rump parliament, for that was the name it went by, being now reinstated, was yet very vigorous in its attempts to lessen the power by which it was replaced. The officers of the army therefore came to a resolution, usual enough in those times, to dissolve that assembly, by which they were so vehemently opposed. Accordingly, Lambert, one of the generals, drew up a chosen body of troops, and placing them in the street, which led to Westninister-had, when the speaker Lenthall proceeded in his carriage to the House, he ordered the horses to be turned, and very civilly conducted him home. The other members were dkewise intercepted, and the army returned to their quarters to observe a solemn fast, which generally either preceded or attended their outrages. During these transactions, general Monk was at the head of 8000 veterans in Scotland, and beheld the distraction of his native country with but slender hopes of relieving it. Whatever might have been his designs, it was impassible to cover them with greater secrecy than he did. As soon as he put his army in motion, to inquire into the causes of the disturbances in the capital, his countenance was eagerly sought by all the contending parties. He still, however, continued to march his army towards the capital ; the whole country equady in doubt as to his motives, and astonished at his reserve. But"], [197, "183 Monk continued his inflexible taciturnity, and at last came to St. Alban's, within a few miles of London. He there sent the Rump pardament, who had resumed their seat, a message, desiring them to remove such forces as remained in London to country quarters. In the mean time the House of Commons, having passed votes for the composure of the kingdom, dissolved themselves, and gave orders for the immediate assembling of a new parliament. As yet the new pardament was not assembled, and no persons had hitherto dived into the designs of the general. He stid preserved in his reserve; and although the cading a new pardament was but, in other words, to restore the king, yet his expressions never once betrayed the secret of his bosom. Nothing but a security of confidence at last extorted the con fession from him. He had been intimate with one Morrice, a gentleman of Devonshire, of a sedentary, studious disposition, and with him alone did he dedberate upon the great and dangerous enterprise of the Restoration x). Sn- John Granville, who had a commission from the king, applied for access to the general; he was desired to communicate his business to Morrice. Granville refused, though twice urged, to dedver his message to any but the general himself, so that Monk now finding he could depend upon his minister's secrecy, he opened to him his whole intentions; but, with his usual caution, still scrupled to commit anything to paper. In consequence of these the king left the Spanish territories, where he very narrowly escaped being detained at Breda by the governor, under the pretence of treating him with proper respect and formadty. From there he retired into Holland, where he resolved to wait for farther advice. At length the long expected day for the sitting of a free parliament arrived. The affections of ad were turned towards the king; yet such were their fears, and such dangers attended a freedom of speech, that no one dared for some days to make any mention of his name. All this time Monk, with his usual reserve, tried their tempers, and examined the ardour of their wishes: at length, he gave directions to Annesly, president of 1) Eestoring of the monarchy."], [198, "184 the council, to inform them that one Sir John Granvdle, a servant of the king, had been sent over by his majesty, and was now at the door with a letter to the Commons. Nothing could exceed the joy and transport with which this message was received. The members for a moment forgot the dignity of their situations, and indulged in a loud acclamation of applause. Granville was called in , and the letter eagerly read. A moment's pause was scarce allowed; all at once the house burst into a universal assent to the king's proposals ; and, to diffuse the joy more widely, it was voted that the letter and indemnity should immediately be published. Charles II. entered London on the 29\"' of May, which was his birth-day. An innumerable concourse of people lined the way wherever he passed, and rent the air with their accla mations. They had been so long distracted by factions, oppres sed and alarmed by a succession of tyrannies, that they could no longer suppress these emotions of delight, in beholding their constitution restored, or rather, like a phoenix *), appearing more beautiful and vigorous from the ruins of its former con flagration. Fanaticism, with its long train of gloomy terrors, fled at the approach of freedom; the arts of society and peace began to return; and it had been happy for the people if the arts of luxury had not entered in their train. The Habeas Corpus Act. When Charles came to the throne, he was thirty years of age, possessed of an agreeable person, an elegant address, and an engaging manner. His whole demeanour and behaviour were well calculated to support and increase popularity. Ac customed, during his exile, to dve cheerfully among his cour tiers, he carried the same endearing familiarities to the throne ; and, from the lenity of his temper, no injuries were dreaded from his former resentments. But it was soon found that all these advantages were merely superficial. His indolence and love of pleasure made him averse to all kind of business; his 1) The bird which is supposed to exist single, and to rise again from its own ashes."], [199, "185 familiarities were prostituted to the worst, as well as the best of his subjects, and he took no care to reward his former friends, as he had taken few steps to be avenged of his former enemies. Though an act of indemnity was passed, those who had an immediate hand in the king's death were excepted. Crom well, Ireton, and Bradshaw, though dead, were considered as proper objects of resentment; their bodies were dug from their graves, dragged to the place of execution, and after hanging some time, buried under the gallows. Of the rest who sat in judgment on the late monarch's trial, some were dead, and some were thought worthy of pardon. Ten only, out of fourscore, were devoted to immediate destruction. These were enthusiasts, who had all along acted from principle, and who, in the general spirit of rage excited against them, showed a fortitude that might do honour of a better cause. This was the time for the king to have made himself independent of all pardaments ; and it is said that Southampton, one of his ministers, had thought of procuring his master, from the commons, the grant of a revenue of two midions a year, which would have effectually rendered him absolute; but, in this, his views were obstructed by the great Clarendon, who, though attached to the king, was still more the friend of liberty and the laws. Charles, however, was no way interested in these opposite views of his ministers; he only desired money, in order to prosecute his pleasures : and, provided he had that, he little regarded the manner in which it was obtained. His continual exigencies drove him constantly to measures no way suited to his inclination. Among others, was his mar- riage, celebrated at this time, with Catherine, the infanta of Portugal, who, though a virtuous princess, possessed, as it should seem, but few personal attractions. It was the portion of this princess that the needy monarch was enamoured of, which amounted to three hundred thousand pounds, together with the fortress of Tangier, in Africa, and of Bombay, in the East Indies. The chancellor Clarendon, the Duke of Ormond and Southampton, urged many reasons against this match ; but the king disregarded their advice, and the inauspicious mar riage was celebrated accordingly."], [200, "186 It was probably with a view of recruiting the supply for his pleasures, that he was induced to declare war against the Dutch, as the money appointed for that purpose would go through his hands. In this naval war, which continued to rage for some years with great fierceness, much blood was spdt, and great treasures exhausted, until, at last, a treaty was con cluded at Breda, by which the colony of New York was ceded by the Dutch to the English, and considered as a most valuable acquisition. This treaty was considered as inglorious to the Engdsh, as they faded in gaining any redress upon the complaints which gave rise to it. Lord Clarendon, particularly, gained a share of blame, both for having advised an unnecessary war, and then for concluding a disgraceful peace. He had been long dechning in the king's favour, and he was no less dis pleasing to the majority of the people. This seemed the signal for the earl's enemies to step in, and effect his entire overthrow. A charge was opened against him in the house of commons, by Mr. Seymour, consisting of seventeen articles. These, which were only a catalogue of the popular rumours before mentioned, appeared, at first sight, false or frivolous. However, Clarendon, finding the popular torrent, united to the violence of power, running with impetuosity against him, thought proper to withdraw to France. Having thus got rid of his virtuous minister, the king soon after resigned himself to the direction of a set of men, who afterwards went by the appellation of the Cabal, from the initials of the names of which it was composed. The first of them, Sir Thomas Clifford, was a man of daring and impetuous spirit, rendered more dangerous by eloquence and intrigue. Lord Ashley, soon after known by the name of Lord Shaftesbury, was turbulent, ambitious, subtle, and enterprising. The Duke of Buckingham was gay, capri cious, of some wit, and great vivacity. Arlington was a man of very moderate capacity; his intentions were good, but he wanted courage to persevere in them. Lastly, the duke of Lauderdale, who was not defective in natural, and still less in acquiring talents ; but neither was his address graceful, nor his understanding just; he was ambitious, obstinate, insolent, and"], [201, "187 sullen. These were the men to whom Charles gave up the conduct of his affairs, and who plunged the remaining part of his reign in difficulties, which produced the most dangerous symptoms. From this inauspicious combination, the people had enter tained violent jealousies against the court. The fears and discontents of the nation were vented without restraint; the apprehensions of a popish successor, an abandoned court, and a parliament which, though sometimes assertors of liberty, yet which had now continued for 17 years without change, natur ally rendered the minds of mankind timid and suspicious, and they only, wanted objects on which to wreak their ill-humour. When the spirit of the English is once roused, they either find objects of suspicion, or make them. On the 12\"' of August, one Kirby, a chemist, accosted the king, as he was walking in the Park. \u201eSir, said he, keep within the company: your enemies have a design upon your life, and you may be shot in this very walk.\" Being questioned in consequence of this strange intimation, he offered to produce one doctor Tongue, a weak, credulous clergyman, who told him that two persons, named Grove and Pickering, were engaged to murder the king ; and that Sir George Wakeman, the queen's physician , had undertaken the same task by poison. Tongue was introduced to the king with a bundle of papers relating to this pretended conspiracy , and was referred to the lord treasurer x), Danley. He there declared that the papers were thrust under his door; and he afterwards asserted that he knew the author of them, who desired that his name might be concealed, as he dreaded the resentment of the Jesuits. This information appeared so vague and unsatisfactory, that the king concluded the whole was a fiction. However, Tongue was not to be repressed in the ardour of his loyalty; he went again to the lord treasurer, and told him, that a pack of letters, written by Jesuits concerned in the plot, was that night to be put in the post-house for Windsor, directed to one Bedingfield, a Jesuit, who was confessor to the Duke of York, and who resided there. These letters had actually been received 1) Oberschatzmeister."], [202, "188 a few hours before by the Duke; but he had shown them to the king as a forgery of which he knew neither the drift nor the meaning. Titus Oates, who was the fountain of all this dreadful intedigence, was produced soon after, who, with seeming reluct ance, came to give his evidence. This Titus Oates was an abandoned miscreant, obscure, iditerate, vulgar, and indigent. He had been once indicted for perjury, was afterwards chaplain on board a man of war, and dismissed for unnatural practices. He then professed himself a Roman Catholic, and crossed the sea to St. Omer's, where he was for some time maintained in the English seminary of that city. At a time that he was supposed to have been entrusted with a secret, involving the fate of kings,, he was allowed to remain in such necessity, that Kirby was obliged to supply him with daily bread. He had two methods of proceeding: either to ingratiate himself by this information with the ministry, or alarm the people, and thus turn their fears to his advantage. He chose the latter method. He went, therefore, with his companions, to Sir Edmondsbury Godfrey, a noted and active justice of peace, and before him, deposed to a narrative, dressed up in terrors fit to make an impression on the vulgar. The pope, he said, considered himself as entitled to the possession of England and Ireland, on account of the heresy of the prince and people, and had, accordingly, assumed the sovereignty of these king doms. The king, whom the Jesuits caded the Black Bastard, \u2022was solemnly tried by them and condemned as a heretic. Grove and Pickering, to make sure work, were employed to shoot the king, and that, too, with silver bullets. The Duke of York was to be offered the crown in consequence of the success of these probable schemes, on condition of extirpating the protestant religion. Upon his refusal, \u201eTo pot James must go 1),\" as the Jesuits were said to express it. In consequence of this dreadful information, sufficiently marked with absurdity, vulgarity, and contradiction, Titus Oates became the favourite of the people, .notwithstanding, during his examination before the council, he so betrayed the grossness 1) To go to pot, zu Grunde gehen."], [203, "189 of his impostures, that he contradicted himself in every step of his narration. A great number of the Jesuits mentioned by Oates were immediately taken into custody. Coleman, secretary to the Duke of York, who was said to have acted so prominent a part in the conspiracy, at first retired; but next day surrendered himself to the secretary of state, and some of his papers, by Oates's directions, were secured. In this fluctuation of passions, an accident served to con firm the prejudices of the people, and to put it beyond a doubt that Oates's, narrative was nothing but the truth. Sir Edmondsbury Godfrey, who had been so active in unraveding the whole mystery of the popish machinations, after having been missing some days , was found dead in a ditch by Primrosehill, in the way to Hampstead. The cause of his death remains, and must still continue, a secret; but the people, already enraged against the papists, did not hesitate a moment to ascribe it to them. The body of Godfrey was carried through the streets in pro cession, preceded by 70 clergymen; and every one who saw it, made no doubt that this death could be only caused by the papists. Even the better sort of the people were infected with this vulgar prejudice; and such was the general conviction of popish gudt, that no person, with any regard of personal safety, could express the least doubt concerning the information of Oates, or the murder of Godfrey. In order to continue and propagate the alarm, the parda ment affected to believe it true. An address was voted to a solemn fast. It was requested that all papers tending to throw light upon so horrible a conspiracy might be laid before the House x) : that all papists should remove from London ; that access should be denied at court to all unknown and suspicious persons; and that the train-bands in London and Westminster should be in readiness to march. Oates was recommanded by pardament to the king. He was lodged in Whitehall, and en couraged by a pension of twelve hundred pounds a year to proceed in forging new informations. The encouragement given to Oates did not fad to bring 1) Das Parlament."], [204, "190 in others also, who hoped to profit by the delusion of the times. Widiam Bedloe, a man, if possible, more infamous than Oates, appeared next upon the stage. He was, like the former, of very low birth, and had been noted for several cheats and thefts. This man, at his own desire, was arrested at Bristol, and conveyed to London, where he declared before the council, that he had seen the body of Sir Edmonsbury Godfrey at Sommerset- house, where the Queen lived. He said that a servant of lord Bellasis offered to give him four thousand pounds if he would carry it off; and finding all his information greedily received, he confirmed and heightened Oates's plot with aggravated horrors. Thus, encouraged by the general voice in their favour, the witnesses, who had all along enlarged their narratives in proportion as they were eagerly received, went a step farther, and ventured to accuse the Queen. The commons, in an ad dress to the king, gave countenance to this scandalous accusa tion; the lords rejected it with becoming disdain. Edward Coleman, secretary to the Duke of York, was the first who was brought to trial, as being most obnoxious to those who pretended to fear the introduction of popery. Bedloe swore that he had received a commission x) , signed by the superior of the Jesuits, appointing him papal secretary of state, and that he had consented to the king's assassination. After this unfortunate man's sentence, thus procured by these vipers, many members of both houses offered to interpose in his behalf, if he would make ample confession; but as he was, in reality, possessed of no treasonable secrets, he would not save his life by falsehood and imposture. He suffered with calmness and constancy, and, to the last, persisted in the strongest protesta tions of his innocence. The trial of Coleman was succeeded by those of Ireland, Pickering, and Grove. Nothing was proved, but they were found guilty. These unhappy men went to execution protesting their innocence, a circumstance which made no impression on the spectators ; but their being Jesuits banished even pity from their sufferings. Hill, Green, and Berry were tried, upon the 1) Bestallung."], [205, "191 evidence1) of one Miles Prance, for the murder of Godfrey; but though Bedloe's narrative, and Prance's information, were totady irreconcileable , and though their testimony was inva ddated by contrary evidence, ad was in vain; the prisoners were condemned and executed. They all denied their guilt at execution; and as Barry died a protestant, this circumstance was regarded as very considerable. Whitebread, provincial 2) of the Jesuits , Fenwick , Gavan, Turner, and Harcourt, all of them of the same order, were brought to their trial; and Langhorne soon after. Besides Oates and Bedloe, Dugdale, a new witness, appeared against the prisoners. This man spread the alarm stid farther, and even asserted that two hundred thousand papists in England were ready to take arms. The prisoners proved, by sixteen witnesses from St. Omer's, that Oates was in that seminary at the time he swore he was in London. But as they were papists, their testimony could gain no manner of credit. All pleas availed them nothing; but the Jesuits and Langhorne were condemned and executed, with their last breath denying the crime for which they died. The informers 3) had less success on the trial of Sir George Wakeman, the queen's physician, who, though they swore with their usual animosity, was acquitted. His condemnation would have involved the queen in his gudt; and it is probable the judge and jury were afraid of venturing so far. The earl of Stafford, near two years after, was the last man that fell a sacrifice to these bloody wretches ; the witnesses produced against him were Oates, Dugdale, and Tubervide. Oates swore that he saw Fenwick, the Jesuit, deliver Stafford a commission from the general of the Jesuits, constituting him paymaster of the papal army. The clamour and outrage of the populace against the prisoner were very great; he was found guilty, and condemned to be hanged and quartered; but the king changed the sentence into that of beheading. He was executed on Tower-hill, where even his prosecutors could not 1) Zeugniss. 2) Provinzial, an ecclesiastical governor. 3) Anklager."], [206, "192 forbear shedding tears of that serene fortitude which shone in every feature, motion, and accent of this aged nobleman. This parliament had continued to sit for 17 years without interruption, wherefore a new one was caded; in which passed the celebrated statute, caded the Habeas Corpus Act, which confirms the subject in an absolute security from oppressive power. By this act it was prohibited to send any one to prison beyond the sea: no judge, under severe penalties, was to refuse to any prisoner his writ of habeas corpus J) ; by which the gaoler was to produce in court the body of the prisoner, whence the writ had its name, and to certify the cause of his detainer and imprisonment. \u2014 If the gaol lay within 20 mdes of the judge, the writ must be obeyed in three days, and so proportionably for greater distances. Every prisoner must be indicted the first term of his commitment, and brought to trial the subsequent term. And no man, after being enlarged by court, can be re-committed for the same offence. The Meal-Tub Plot, as it was called, soon followed the former. One Dangerfield, more infamous if possible, than Oates and Bedloe, a wretch who had been set in the piflory, scourged, branded, and transported for felony and coining, hatched a plot, in conjunction with a woman, whose name was Celliar, a Roman Catholic of abandoned character. Dangerfield began by declar ing, that there was a design on foot to step up a new form of government, and remove the king and the royal famdy. He communicated this intelligence to the king and the Duke of York, who supplied him with money, and countenanced his discovery. He hid some seditious papers in the lodgings of one colonel Mansel; and then brought the custom-house officers to his apartment to search for smuggled marchandise. The papers were found ; and the council, having examined the affair, concluded they were forged by Dangerfield. They ordered ad the places he frequented to be searched; and, in the house of Cediar, the whole scheme of the conspiracy was discovered upon paper, concealed in a meal-tub, from whence the plot had its 1) Habeas Corpus, a latin expression; it is a writ (schriftlicher Be fehl) by which a goaler is directed to have or produce the body of a prisoner in court, and to certify the cause of his detainer."], [207, "193 name. Dangerfield, being committed to Newgate, made an ample confession of the forgery, which, though probably entirely of his own contrivance, he ascribed to the earl of Castlemain, the countess of Powis , and the five lords of the Tower. He said that the design was to suborn witnesses to prove a charge of perjury upon Oates, to assassinate the earl of Shaftesbury, to accuse the dukes of Monmouth and Buckingham, the earls of Essex, Hadifax, and others, of having been concerned in the conspiracy against the king and his brother. Upon this infor mation, the earl of Castlemain and the countess of Powis were sent to the Tower, and the king himself was suspected of encouraging this imposture. The chief point which the present house of commons laboured to obtain, was the Exclusion Bill, which, though the former house had voted, was never passed into law. Shaftes bury, and many considerable men of the party, had rendered themselves so obnoxious to the duke of York, that they could find safety in no measure but his ruin. Monmouth's friends hoped that the exclusion of James would make room for their own patron. The duke of York's professed bigotry to the catholic religion influenced numbers; and the tyrannies, which were practised without control while he continued in Scotland, rendered his name odious to thousands. In a week, therefore, after the commencement of the cession, a motion was made for bringing in a bill for excluding him from the suc cession of the throne, and a committee was appointed for that purpose. The debates were carried on with great violence on both sides. The king was present during the whole time ; and had the pleasure of seeing the bdl thrown out by a very great majority. Each party had now for some time reviled and ridiculed the other in pamphlets and libels ; and this practice, at last, was attended with an incident that deserves notice. One Fitzharris, an Irish papist, dependent on the duchess of Portsmouth, one of the king's mistresses, used to supply her with these occasional publications. But he was resolved to add to their number by his own endeavours; and he employed one Everhard, a Scots man, to write a libel against the king and the Duke of York. The Scot was actuady a spy for the opposite party; and sup- 13"], [208, "194 posing this a trick to entrap him, he discovered the whole to Sir William Weder, an eminent justice of peace; and to con vince him of the truth of this information, posted him and two other persons, privately, where they heard the whole conference between Fitzharris and himself. The libel composed between them was replete with the utmost rancour and scurrility. Waller carried the intedigence to the king, and obtained a warrant for committing Fitzharris, who happened at the very time to have a copy of the dbel in his pocket. Seeing himself in the hands of a party from which he expected no mercy, he resolved to side with them, and throw the odium of the dbel on the court, who he said were willing to draw up a dbel which should be imputed to the Exclusioners and thus render them hateful to the people. He enhanced his services with the country party by a new popish plot, stdl more tremendous than any of the foregoing. He brought in the Duke of York as a principal accomplice in this plot, and as a contriver in the murder of Sir Edmondsbury Godfrey. The king imprisoned Fitzharris ; the commons avowed x) his cause. They voted that he should be impeached by them selves, to screen him from the ordinary forms of justice: the lords rejected the impeachment; the commons asserted their right; a commotion was dkely to ensue; and the king, to break off the contest, went to the house, and dissolved the pardament, with a fixed resolution never to call another. This vigorous measure was a blow that the parliament had never expected, and nothing but the necessity of the times coidd have justified the king's manner of proceeding. From that moment, which ended the parliamentary commotions, Charles seemed to rule with despotic power, and he was resolved to leave the succession to his brother, but clogged with all the faults and misfortunes of his own administration. His temper, which had always been easy and merciful, now became arbi trary, and even cruel: he entertained spies and informers round the throne, and imprisoned all such as he thought most daring in their designs. He resolved to humble the presbyterians: these were divested 1) Vertheidigten."], [209, "195 of their employments and their places, and their offices given to such as held with the court, and approved the doctrine of non-resistance1). The clergy began to testify their zeal and their principles, by their writings and their sermons ; but though amongst these the partisans of the king were the most numerous, those of the opposite faction were the most enterprising. The king openly espoused the cause of the former ; and thus placing himself at the head of a faction, he deprived the city of Lon don, which had long headed the popular party, of their charter 2). It was not tdl after an abject submission that he restored it to them, having previously subjected the election of their magistrates to his immediate authority. Terrors also were not wanting to confirm his new species of monarchy. Fitzharris was brought to trial before a jury, and condemned and executed. The whole gang of spies, wit nesses, informers, and suborners, which had long been encour aged and supported by the leading patriots, finding now that the king was entirely master, turned short upon their ancient drivers, and offered their evidence against those who had put them in motion. The king's ministers, with a horrid satisfaction, gave them countenance and encouragement: so that soon the same cruelties, and the same injustice, were practised against presbyterian schemes, as had been employed against catholic treason. The first person who fell under the displeasure of the ministry, was one Stephan College, a London joiner, who had become so noted for his zeal against popery, that he went by the name of Protestant joiner. He had attended the city mem bers to Oxford, armed with sword and pistol; he had some times been heard to speak irreverently of the king, and was now presented by the grand jury of London as guilty of sedition. A jury at Oxford after half an hour's deliberation, 1) Nichtwiderstand, passive obedience, the principle of yielding without resistance to every act of power exerted by the hereditary and anointed king. 2) Charter, any written paper bestowing or confirming privileges, die Urkunde, wodurch ein Vorrecht bewilligt wird , Gnadenbrief, Ge rechtsame. 13*"], [210, "196 brought him in guilty x) , and the spectators testified then inhuman pleasure with a shout of applause. He bore his fate with unshaken fortitude; and at the place of execution denied the crime for which he had been condemned. The power of the crown became at this time irresistible; the city of London having been deprived of its charter, which was restored only upon terms of submission; and the giving up the nomination of their own magistrates was so mortifying a circumstance , that all the other corporations 2) in England soon began to fear the same treatment, and were sucessively induced to surrender them charters into the hands of the king. Considerable sums were exacted for restoring these charters; and all the offices of power and profit were left at the disposal of the crown. Resistance now, however justifiable, could not be safe; and ad prudent men saw no other expedient, but peaceably submitting to the present grievances. But there was a party in England that stdl cherished their former ideas of freedom, and were resolved to hazard every danger in its defence. The duke of Monmouth, the king's natural son by Mrs. Waters, engaged the earl of Maulesfield, lord Brandon, Sir Gdbert Gerrard, and other gentlemen in Cheshire in his cause. Lord Russel opened a correspondence with Sir Wddam Courtney, Sir Francis Rowls, and Sir Francis Drake, who promised to raise the west. Shaftesbury, with one Ferguson, an independant clergyman, and a restless plotter, menaged the city, upon which the confederatees chiedy reded. It was now that this turbulent man found his schemes mosj; likely to take effect. After the disappointment and destruction of a hundred 1) In criminal cases there are grand and petty juries.

But his scheme, like all the former, was disappointed. The caution of Lord Russel, who induced the Duke of Monmouth to put off the enterprise, saved the kingdom from the horrors of a civil war; whde Shaftesbury was so struck with the sense of his impending danger, that he left his house, and lurking about the city, attempted, but in vain, to drive the Londoners into open in surrection. At last, enraged at the numberless cautions and delays which clogged and defeated his projects, he threatened to begin with his friends alone. However, after a long struggle between fear and rage, he abandoned ad hopes of success, .and fled out of the kingdom to Amsterdam, where he ended his turbulent life soon after, without being pitied by his friends, or feared by his enemies. The loss of Shaftesbury, though it retarded the views of the conspirators, did not suppress them. A council of six was erected, consisting of Monmouth, Russel, Essex, Howard, Algernon Sydney, and John Hampden, grandson of the great man of that name. Such, together with the Duke of Argyle, were the leaders of this conspiracy. But there was also a set of subordinate conspirators, who frequently met together, and carried on pro jects quite unknown to Monmouth and his council. Among these men was colonel Rumsey, an old republican officer, together with lieutenat - colonel Walcot, of the same stamp; Goodenough , under - sheriff of London , a zealous and noted partisan; Ferguson, an independent minister1); and several attorneys, merchants, and tradesmen of London. But colonel Rumsey and Ferguson were the only persons that had access to the great leaders of the conspiracy. These men in their meetings embraced the most desperate resolutions. They pro posed to assassinate the king in his way to Newmarket. Rumbal, one of the party, possessed a farm on the road, called the Rye house, and from thence the conspiracy was denominated the Rye-House Plot. They deliberated upon the scheme of stopping the king's coach, by overturning a cart in the highway of this place, and shooting him through the hedges. The house in 1) Ein Prediger der Independenten."], [212, "198 which the king lived at Newmarket took fire accidentady, and he was obliged to leave that town eight days sooner than was expected, to which circumstance his safety was ascribed. Among the conspirators was one Keiling, who, finding himself in danger of a prosecution for arresting the lord mayor x) of London, resolved to earn his pardon by discovering this plot to the ministry. Colonel Rumsey, and West, a lawyer, no sooner understood that this man had informed 2) against them, than they agreed to save their lives by turning king's evidence 3), and they surrendered themselves accordingly. Monmouth ab sconded ; Russel was sent to the Tower ; Grey escaped, Howard was taken concealed in a chimney ; Essex, Sydney, and Hamp den, were soon after arrested, and had the mortification to find lord Howard an evidence against them. Walcot was first brought to trial and condemned, together with Hone and Rouse, two associates in the conspiracy, upon the evidence of Rumsey, West, and Sheppard. They died penitent, acknowledging the justness of the sentence by which they were executed. A much greater sacrifice was shortly after to follow. This was the lord Russel, son of the earl of Bedford, a nobleman of numberless good qualities, and who was led into the conspiracy from conviction of the duke of York's intention to restore popery. He was liberal, popular, humane, and brave. All his virtues were so many crimes in the present suspicious disposition of the court. The chief evidence against him was lord Howard, a man of very bad character, one of the conspirators, who was now contented to take life upon such terms, and to accept of infamous safety. This witness swore that Russel was engaged in the design of an insurrection ; but he acquitted him, as did also Rumsey and West, of being privy to the assassination. The jury, who were zealous roy adsts, after a short dedberation, found the prisoner guilty, and he was condemned to suffer beheading. The scaffold for his execution was erected in Lincoln's-inn-tields; he laid his head 1) Oberbiirgermeister. 2) Geklagt. 3) To turn king's evidence , gegen seine Mitschuldigen zeugen (wo durch der Zeuge seine eigne Freisprechuug bezweckt)."], [213, "199 on the block without the least change of his countenance, and at two strokes it was severed from his body. The celebrated Algernon Sydney, son of the earl of Lei cester, was next brought to his trial. He had been formerly engaged in the. parliamentary army against the late king and was even named on the high court of justice that tried him, but had not taken his seat among the judges. He had ever opposed Cromwed's usurpation, and went into voluntary banish ment on the Restoration1). His affan-s, however, requiring his return, he applied to the king for a pardon, and obtained his request. But all his hopes, and all his reasonings, were formed upon republican principles. For his adored republic he had written and fought, and went into banishment, -and ventured to return. It may easdy be conceived how obnoxious a man of such principles was to a court that now was not even con tent with dmitations to its power. They went so far as to take illegal measures to procure his condemnation. The only wit ness that deposed against Sydney was lord Howard, and the law required two. In order, therefore, to make out a second witness, they had recourse to a very extraordinary expedient. In ransacking his closet, some discourses on government were found in his own hand- writing, containing principles favourable to liberty, and in themselves no way subversive of a dmited government. By overstraining some of these they were con strued into treason. It was in vain he adeged that papers were no evidence ; that it could not be proved they were written by him ; that, if proved, the papers themselves contained nothing criminal. His defence was overruled ; the violent and inhuman Jeffreys , who was now Chief Justice 2) , easily prevailed on a partial jury to bring him in guilty, and his execution followed soon after. One can scarcely contemplate the transaction of this reign without horror.

Hampden was soon tried after, and as there was nothing to affect his life, he was fined forty thousand pounds. Hodoway, a merchant of Bristol, who had fled to the West Indies, was brought over, condemned, and executed. Sir Thomas Armstrong also, who had fled to Holland, was brought over, and shared the same fate. Lord Essex, who had been imprisoned in the Tower, was found in an apartment with his throat cut; but whether he was guilty of suicide, or whether the bigotry of the times might not have induced some assassin to commit the crime, cannot now be known. This was the last blood that was shed for an imputation of plots or conspiracies, which continued during the greatest part of this reign. At this period, the government of Charles was as absolute as that of any monarch in Europe ; but happdy for mankind, his tyranny was but of short duration. He was seized with a sudden fit, which resembled an apoplexy ; and though he was recovered by bleeding, yet he languished only for a few days, and then expired, in the 59th year of his age and the 25th of his reign. During his illness, some clergymen of the church of England attended him, to whom he discovered a total indif ference. Catholic priests were brought to his bed-side, and from their hands he received the rites of their communion. The Revolution. The duke of York who succeeded his brother by the title of James IL, had been bred a papist by his mother, and was strongly bigoted to his principles. He went openly to mass with all the ensigns of his dignity, and even sent one Caryl as his agent to Rome, to make submission to the pope, and to pave the way for the re-admission of England into the bosom of the catholic church. A conspiracy, set on foot by the duke of Monmouth, was the first disturbance of his reign. He had, since his last con spiracy, been pardoned, but was ordered to depart the king dom, and had retired to Holland. Being dismissed from thence"], [215, "201 by the prince of Orange, upon James' accession, he went to Brussels, where finding himself still pursued by the king's severity, he resolved to retaliate, and make an attempt upon the kingdom. He had ever been the darling of the people; and some averred that Charles had married his mother, and owned Monmouth's legitimacy at his death. The duke of Argyle seconded his views in Scotland, and they formed the scheme of a double insurrection; so that, while Monmouth should attempt to make a rising in the West, Argyle was also to try his endeavours in the North. Argyle was the first who landed in Scotland, where he pubdshed his manifestoes, put himself at the head of 2500 men, and strove to influence the people in his cause. But a for midable body of the king's forces coming against him, his army fell away; and he himself, after being wounded in attempting to escape, was taken prisoner by a peasant, who found him standing up to his neck in a pool of , water. He was from thence carried to Edinbourgh, where, after enduring many indignities with a gadant spirit, he was publicly executed. Meanwhile Monmouth was by this time landed in Dorset shire, with scarce a hundred followers. However, his name was so popular, and so great was the hatred of the people, both for the person and religion of James, that, in four days, he had assembled a body of above 2000 men. Being advanced to Taunton, his numbers had increased to 6000 men, and he was obliged eveiy day, for want of arms, to dismiss numbers who crowded to his standard. He entered Bridgewater, Weds, and Frome, and was proclaimed in all those places, but he lost the hour of action in receiving and claiming these empty honours. The king was not a little alarmed at his invasion, but still more at the success of an undertaking that at first appeared desperate. Six regiments of British troops were recalled from Holland ; and a body of regulars J), at the number of 3000 men, were sent, under the command of the earl of Feversham and Churchdl, to check the progress of the rebels. They took post at Sedgemore, a vidage in the neighbourhood of 1) Eegulare Truppen, a permanent army."], [216, "202 Bridgewater, and were joined by the militia of the country in considerable numbers. It was there that Monmouth resolved, by a desperate effort, to lose his life or gain the kingdom. The negligent disposition made by Feversham invited him to the attack ; and his faithful fodowers showed what courage and principle could do against discipdne and numbers. They drove the royal infantry from them ground, and were upon the point of gaining the victory, when the misconduct of Mon mouth, and the cowardice of lord Grey, who commanded the horse, brought ad to ruin. This nobleman fled at the first outset ; and the rebels, being charged in flank by the victorious army, gave way, after a three hours' contest. About 300 were killed in the engagement, and a 1000 in the pursuit; and thus ended an enterprise rashly begun, and more feebly conducted. Monmouth fled from the field of battie, above 20 mdes, tdl his horse sunk under him. He then alighted, and, changing clothes with a shepherd, fled on foot, attended by a German count, who had accompanied him from Hodand. Being quite exhausted with hunger and fatigue, they both lay down in a field, and covered themselves with fern. The shepherd being found in Monmouth's clothes by the pursuers, increased the ddigence of the search; and, by means of blood-hounds, he was detected in this miserable situation, with raw peas in his pocket, which he had gathered in the fields to sustain dfe. He wrote the most submissive letters to the king; and that monarch, willing to feast his eyes with the miseries of a fallen enemy, gave him an audience. At this interview, the duke fell upon his knees, and begged his life in the most abject terms. He even signed a paper offered him by the king, declaring his own idegitimacy, and then the stern tyrant assured him, that his crime was of such a nature as could not be pardoned. The duke perceiving that he had nothing to hope, from the clemency of his uncle, recovered his spirits, rose up, and retired with an air of disdain. He was followed to the scaffold with great compassion from the populace. He warned the executioner not to fall into the same error which he had committed in beheading Russel, where it had been necessary to redouble the blow. But this only increased the severity of the punishment: the man was seized with a universal trepidation, and he struck"], [217, "203 a feeble blow, upon which the duke raised his head from the block, as if to reproach him; he gently laid down his head a second time, and the executioner struck him again and again to no purpose. He at last threw the axe down ; but the sheriff compelled him, lo resume the attempt, and at two blows more, the head was severed from the body. Such was the end of James, duke of Monmouth, the dardng of the English people. He was brave, sincere, and good natured; open to flattery, and by that seduced into an enterprise which exceeded his capacity. But it were well for the insurgents, and fortunate for the king, if the blood that was now shed had been thought a suf ficient expiation for the late offence. The victorious army behaved with the most savage cruelty to the prisoners taken after the battle. Feversham, immediately after the victory, hanged up above 20 prisoners. The midtary severities of the commanders were still inferior to the legal slaughters committed by judge Jeffreys, who was sent down to try the dednquents. The natural brutadty of this man's temper was inflamed by continual intoxication. He told the prisoners, that if they would save him the trouble of trying them, they might expect some favour, otherwise he would execute the law upon them with the utmost severity. Many poor wretches were thus allured into a confession, and found that it only hastened their destruction. No less than 80 were exe cuted at Dorchester; and, on the whole, at Exeter, Taunton, and Weds, 251 are computed to have fallen by the hands of the justice. In ecclesiastical matters, James proceeded with still greater injustice. Among those who distinguished themselves against popery, was one Dr. Sharpe, a clergyman of London, who declaimed with severity against those who had changed their religion by such arguments as the popish missionaries were able to produce. This being supposed to reflect upon the king, gave great offence at court; and positive orders were given to the bishop of London to suspend Sharpe tid his majesty's pleasure should be farther known. The bishop refused to comply, and the king resolved to punish the bishop himself for disobedience."], [218, "204 To effect his design, an ecclesiastical commission was issued out, by which seven commissioners were invested with a full and unlimited authority over the whole church of England. Before this tribunal the bishop was summoned; and not only he, but Sharpe, the preacher, was suspended. The next step was to adow a liberty of conscience to all sectaries; and he was taught to believe, that the truth of the cathode redgion would then, upon a fair trial, gain the victory. He therefore issued a declaration of general indulgence, and asserted that nonconformity x) to the established religion was no longer penal. To complete his work, he publicly sent the earl of Cast lemain ambassador extraordinary to Rome, in order to express his obedience to the pope, and to reconcile his kingdoms to the catholic communion. The court of Rome expected but little success from measures so blindly conducted. They were sensible that the king was openly striking at those laws and opinions which it was his business to undermine in sdence and security. The Jesuits soon after were permitted to erect codeges in different parts of the kingdom; they exercised the catholic worship in the most public manner; and sour catholic bishops, consecrated in the king's chapel, were sent through the king dom to exercise their episcopal functions, under the title of apostolic vicars2). A second declaration for liberty of conscience was published, almost in the same terms with the former; but with this pecudar injunction, that all divines should read it after service in their churches. The clergy were resolved to disobey an order dictated by the most bigoted motives. Seven bishops concerted an address, in the form of a petition, to the king, which, with the warmest expressions of zeal and submission, remonstrated, that they could not read his declaration consistent with their consciences, or the respect they owed the protestant religion. The king in a fury summoned the bishops before the 1) Nichtubereinstimmung, Abweichung; a nonconformist is one who refuses to conform to the rites and mode of worship of an established church. 2) Grossvicare, papstliche Vicare."], [219, "205 council, and there questioned them whether they would acknow ledge their petition. They for some time declined giving an answer ; but being urged by the chancellar, they at last owned it. On their refusal to give bad1), an order was immediately drawn for their commitment to the Tower, and the crown lawyers2) received directions to prosecute them for a seditious libel. The twenty-ninth day of June was fixed for their trial; and their return was more splendidly attended than their im prisonment. The cause was looked upon as involving the fate of the nation; and future freedom, or future slavery, awaited the decision. The dispute was learnedly managed by the lawyers on both sides. Hodoway and Powel, two of the judges, declared in favour of the bishops. The jury withdrew into a chamber, where they passed the whole night ; but next morning they returned into court, and pronounced the bishops, Not gudty. Westminster-hall instantly rang with loud acclamations, which were communicated to the whole extent of the city. They even reached the camp at Hounslow, where the king was at dinner, in Feversham's tent. His majesty demanding the cause of those rejoicings, and being informed that it was nothing but the soldiers shouting at the delivery of the bishops, \u201eCall you that nothing?\" cried he, \u201ebut so much the worse for them!\" It was in this posture of affairs that all people turned their eyes upon Wddam, prince of Orange, who had married Mary, the eldest daughter of king James. Wdliam was a prince who had, from his earliest entrance into business, been immersed in dangers, calamities, and politics. The ambition of France, and the jealousies of Hodand, had served to sharpen his talents, and to give him a propensity to intrigue. This politic prince now plainly saw that James had incur- 1) To bail, to give bail, Biirgschaft leisten, Burgen stellen, is a law term signifying to liberate by giving a prisoner to his friends, who are security that he shall appear and answer in court ; in strictness , the magistrate bails the prisoner; but the sureties are also said to bail him by procuring his release. 2) Kronanwalte."], [220, "206 red the most violent hatred of his subjects. He was minutely informed of their discontents; and, by seeming to discourage, still farther increased them, hoping to gain the kingdom for himself in the sequel. The time when the prince entered upon this enterprise, was just when the people were in a flame from this recent insult offered to their bishops. He had before this made con siderable augmentations to the Dutch fleet, and the ships were then lying ready in the harbour. Some additional troops were also levied, and sums of money, raised for other purposes, were converted to the advancement of this expedition. So wed concerted were his measures, that, in three days, above four hundred transports were hired; the army fed down the rivers and canals from Nimeguen, with all necessary stores ; and the prince set sad from Helvoetsluys , with a fleet of near five hundred vessels, and an army of above fourteen thousand men. It was given out that this invasion was intended for the coast of France; and many of the English, who saw the fleet pass along their coasts, little expected to see it land on their own shores. Thus, after a voyage of two days, the prince landed his army at the vdlage of Buxholme, in Torbay, on the fifth of November, which was the anniversary of the gun powder treason. But though the invitation from the Engdsh was very general, the prince for some time had the mortification to find himself joined by very few. He marched first to Exeter, where the country people had been so lately terrified with the execu tions which had ensued on Monmouth's rebedion, that they con tinued to observe a strict neutrabty. He remained for ten days in expectation of being joined by the malcontents, and at last began to despair of success. But just when he began to deliberate about re-embarking his forces, he was joined by several persons of consequence, and the whole country soon after came flocking to his standard. The nobidty, clergy, officers, and even the king's own servants and creatures, were imanimous in deserting James. Lord Churchill had been raised from the rank of a page, and had been invested with a high command in the army ; had been created a peer, and owed his"], [221, "207 whole fortune to the king's bounty; even he deserted among the rest, and carried with him the duke of Grafton, natural son to the late king, colonel Berkeley, and some others. The prince of Denmark, and Anne, his favourite daughter, perceiving the desperation of circumstances, resolved to leave him, and take part with the prevailing side. When he was told that the prince and princess had followed the rest of his favourites, he was stung with the most bitter anguish. \u201eGod help me,\" cried he, in the extremity of his agony, \u201emy own children have forsaken me.\" The king, alarmed every day more and more with the prospect of a general disaffection, was resolved to hearken to those who advised his quitting the kingdom. To prepare for this, he first sent away the queen, who arrived safely at Calais, under the conduct of count Lauzun, an old favourite of the French king. He himself soon after disappeared in the night time, attended only by Sh- Edward Hales, a new convert; but was discovered and brought back by the mob. But shortly after, being confined at Rochester, and observing that he was entirely neglected by his own subjects, he resolved to seek safety from the king of France, the only friend he had stid remaining. He accordingly fled to the sea-side, attended by his natural son the duke of Berwick, where he embarked for the Continent, and arrived in safety at Ambleteuse in Picardy, from whence he hastened to the court of France, where he still enjoyed the empty title of a king, and the appel lation of a saint, which flattered him more. The king having thus abdicated the throne, the next con sideration was the appointing a successor. After a long debate in both Houses x) , it was agreed , that the prince and princess of Orange should reign jointly as king and queen of England, whde the administration of government should be placed in the hands of the prince only. The prerogatives of the sover eign and the rights of the nation were clearly defined. Pres byterianism was re-estabdshed in Scotland, where it still re mains the national redgion. Thus, in the course of a few months, was accompdshed 1) Im Parlamente."], [222, "208 that great revolution to which the three united kingdoms owe their civil and religious liberty, a revolution almost unparal leled in the history of the world, for the rapidity and unanimity with which it was effected, and the moderation with which it was accompanied. It cost only one dfe, that of the inhuman and guilty Judge Jeffries, who, attempting to make his escape in disguise, was discovered, and so roughly treated by the people that he died. Widiam was no sooner elected to the throne, than he began to experience the difficulty of governing a people who were more ready to examine the commands of their superiors than to obey them. His reign commenced with an attempt similar to that which had been the principal cause of ad the disturbances in the preceding reign, and which had excluded the monarch from the throne. Wdliam was a Calvinist, and consequently averse to prosecution; he therefore began by attempting to repeal those laws that enjoined uniformity of worship , and though he could not entirely succeed in his design, a toleration was granted to such dissenters as should take the oaths of allegiance, and hold no private conventicles. James's End. In the mean time, James, whose authority was still acknow ledged in Ireland, embarked at Brest for that kingdom, and on May 22d arrived at Kinsale. He soon after made his public entry into Dubdn, amidst the reclamations of the inhabitants. He found the appearance of things in that country equal to his most sanguine expectations. Tyrconnel, the lord lieutenant x), was devoted to his interests, his old army was steady, and a new one raised, amounting together to near 40,000 men. As soon as the season would permit, he went to lay siege to Londonderry, town of small importance in itself, but rendered famous by the stand it made on this occasion. The besieged endured the most poignant sufferings from fatigue and famine, until at last redeved by a store-ship, that 1) Vicekonig."], [223, "209 happdy broke the boom laid across the river to prevent a supply. The joy of the inhabitants at this unexpected relief was only equalled by the rage and disappointment of the besiegers. The army of James was so dispirited by the success of this enterprise, that they abandoned the siege in the night, and retired with precipitation, after having lost above 9000 men before the place. It was upon the opposite sides of the river Boyne that both armies came in sight of each other, inflamed with ad the animosities arising from religion, hatred, and revenge. The river Boyne at this place was not so deep, but that men might wade over on foot; however, the banks were rugged, and rendered dangerous by old houses and ditches, which served to defend the latent enemy. Wdliam who now headed the the protestant army had no sooner arrived, but he rode along the side of the river in sight of both armies, to make proper observations upon the plan of the battle ; but in the mean time, being perceived by the enemy, a cannon was privately brought out, and planted against him, where he was sitting. The shot kided several of his followers, and he himself was wounded in the shoulder. Early the next morning, at six o'clock, king Wdliam gave orders to force a passage over the river. This the army undertook in three different places, and after a furious can nonading, the battle began with unusual vigour. The Irish troops, though reckoned the best in Europe abroad, have always fought indifferently at home. After an obstinate resist ance, they ded with precipitation, leaving the French and Swiss regiments, who came to their assistance, to make the best retreat they could. Widiam led on his horse in person; and contributed by his activity and vigdance, to secure the victory. James was not in the battle, but stood aloof during the action, on the hid of Dunmore, surrounded with some squadrons of horse; and at intervals was heard to exclaim, when he saw his own troops repulsing those of the enemy, \u201e0 spare my English subjects.\" The Irish lost about 1500 men, and the protestants about one third of that number. The victory was splendid, and almost decisive, but the death of the duke of Schomberg, who 14"], [224, "210 was shot as he was crossing the river, seemed to outweigh the whole loss sustained by the enemy. The last battle fought in favour of James was at Aughrim. The enemy fought with surprising fury, and the horse were several times repulsed; but the English, wading through the middle of a bog up to the waist in mud and rallying with some difficulty on the firm ground on the other side, renewed the combat with great fury. St. Ruth, the Irish general, being killed by a cannon ball, his fate so dispirited his troops, that they gave way on ad sides, and retreated to Limerick, where they resolved to make a final stand, after having lost above 5000 of the flower of their army. Limerick, the last retreat of the Irish forces, made a brave defence, but soon seeing the enemy advanced within ten paces of the bridge - foot , and perceiving themselves sourrounded on all sides, they determined to capitulate, a negotiation was immediately begun, and hostil ities ceased on both sides. The Roman catholics, by this capitulation, were restored to the enjoyment of those liberties in the exercise of their religion which they had possessed in the reign of king Charles the Second. Ad persons were in dulged with free leave to remove, with their famides and effects, to any other country, except England and Scotland. In con sequence of this, above 14,000 of those who had fought for king James went over into France, having transports provided by government for conveying them thither. James was now reduced to the lowest ebb of despondency ; his designs upon England were quite frustrated, so that nothing was left his friends but the hopes of assassinating the monarch on the throne. These base attempts, as barbarous as they were useless, were not entirely disagreeable to the temper of James. It is said he encouraged and proposed them, but they ad proved unserviceable to his cause, and only ended in the destruction of the undertakers. From that time till he died, which was about seven years, he continued to reside at St. Germain's a pensioner on the bounties of Louis, and assisted by occasional dberadties from his daughter and friends in England. He died on the 16th Septb. 1700, after having laboured under a tedious sickness; and many miracles as the people thought, were wrought at his tomb. Indeed, the latter part of"], [225, "211 his life was calculated to inspire the superstitious with reverence for his piety. He subjected himself to acts of uncommon penance and mortification. He frequently visited the poor monks of La Trappe, who where edified by his humble and pious deportment. His pride and arbitrary temper seemed to have vanished with his greatness; and in his last dlness con jured his son to prefer religion to every worldly advantage, a counsel which that prince strictly obeyed. He died with great marks of devotion, and was interred, at his own request, in the church of the English Benedictines, at Paris, without any funeral solemnity. The Wars with France. Wdliam, upon accepting the crown, was resolved to pre serve, as much as he was able, that share of prerogative which still was left him. But at length he became fatigued with opposing the laws which parliament every day were laying round his authority, and gave up the contest. He admitted every restraint upon the prerogative in England, upon condition of being properly supplied with the means of humbling the power of France. War, and the balance of power in Europe, were ad he knew, or indeed desired to understand. Provided the parliament furnished him with supplies for those purposes, he permitted them to guide the internal podcy at then- pleasure. For the prosecution of the war with France, the sums of money granted him were incredible. The nation not contented with furnishing him with such sums of money as they were capable of raising by the taxes of the year, mortgaged those taxes, and involved themselves in debts, which they have never since been able to discharge. For all that profusion of wealth granted to maintain the imaginary balance of Europe, England received in return the empty reward of military glory in Flanders, and the con sciousness of having given their allies, particularly the Dutch, frequent opportunities of being ungrateful. The war with France continued during the greater part of this king's reign ; but at length the treaty of Ryswick put an 14*"], [226, "212 end to those contentions, in which England had engaged without policy, and came off without advantage. In the general paci fication, her interests seemed entirely deserted; and for all the treasures she had sent to the Continent, and all the blood which she had shed there, the only equivalent she received, was an acknowledgement of king Widiam's title from the king of France. After Widiam's death in 1702, Anne, married to prince George of Denmark, ascended the throne in the 38th year of her age, to the general satisfaction of ad parties. She was the second daughter of king James, by his first wife, the daughter of chancedor Hyde , afterwards earl of Claren don. Upon coming to the crown, she resolved to declare war against France, and communicated her intentions to the house of commons, by whom it was approved, and war was proclaimed accordingly. This declaration of war on the part of the English, was seconded by simdar declarations by the Dutch and Germans, on the same day. The French monarch could not suppress his anger at such a combination ; but his chief resentment fell upon the Dutch. He declared, with great emotion, that as for those gentleman pedlars, the Dutch, they should one day repent their insolence and presumption in declaring war against one whose power they had formerly felt and dreaded. However, the affairs of the allies were no way induenced by his threats. The duke of Marlborough had his views gratified, in being appointed general of the Engdsh forces ; and he was still farther flattered by the Dutch, who, though the earl of Athlone had a right to share the command, appointed Marlborough generalis simo of the allied army. And it must be confessed, that few men shone more, either in debate or action, than he, serene in the midst of danger, and indefatigable in the cabinet; so that he became the most formidable enemy to France that England had produced since the conquering times of Cressy and Agincourt. A great part of the history of this reign consists in battles fought upon the Continent, which, though of very little ad vantage to the interests of the nation, were very great additions to its honour. These triumphs, it is true, are passed away,"], [227, "213 and nothing remains of them, but the names of Blentheim, Oudenarde, and Malplaquet, where the adied army gained great, but (with respect to England) useless victories. A conquest of much greater national importance was gained, with less expense of blood and treasure, in Spain. The ministry of England, understanding that the French were employed in equipping a strong squadron in Brest, sent out Sir Cloudesly Shovel and Sir George Rooke to watch their motions. Sir George, however, had farther orders to convoy a body of forces in transport ships to Barcelona, upon which a fruitless attack was made by the prince of Hesse. Finding no hopes, there fore, from this expedition, in two days after the troops were re-embarked, Sir George Rooke joined by Sir Cloudesly caded a council of war on board the fleet, as they lay off the coast of Africa. In this they resolved to make an attempt upon Gibraltar, a town then belonging to the Spaniards, at that time id provided with a garrison, as neither expecting nor fearing such an attempt. \u2022 The town of Gibraltar stands upon a tongue of land, as the mariners call it, and is defended by a rock inaccessible on every side but one. The prince of Hesse landed his troops, to the number of 1800, on the continent adjoining, and sum moned the town to surrender, but without effect. Next day, the admiral gave orders for cannonading the town; and per ceiving that the enemy were driven from their fortifications at a place called the South Mole-head, ordered captain Whitaker to arm all the boats, and assault that quarter. Those officers who happened to be nearest the Mole, immediately manned their boats without orders, and entered the fortification sword in hand. But they were premature; for the Spaniards sprung a mine, by which two lieutenants, and about 100 men, were kided and wounded. Nevertheless, the two captains, Hicks and Jumper, took possession of a platform, and kept their groimd untd they were sustained by captain Whitaker, and the rest of the seamen, who took a redoubt between the Mole and the town by storm. Then the governor capitulated; and the prince of Hesse entered the place, amazed at the success of the attempt, considering the strength of the fortification. When the news of this conquest was brought to England, it was for"], [228, "214 some time in debate whether it was a capture worth thanking the admiral for. It was at last considered as unworthy public gratitude ; and whde the duke of Marlborough was extoded for useless services, Sir George Rooke was left to neglect, and soon displaced from his command, for having so essentially served his country ; a striking instance, that, even in the most endght ened age, popular applause is most usually misplaced. Gibraltar has ever since remained hi the possession of the Engdsh and continues of the utmost use in refitting that part of the navy destined to annoy an enemy, or protect our trade in the Medi terranean. Here the English have a repository capable of con taining all things necessary for the repairing of fleets, or the equipment of armies. Whde the Engdsh were thus victorious by land and sea, a new scene of contention was opened on the side of Spain, where the ambition of the European princes exerted itself with the same fury that had filled the rest of the Continent. Phdip. the Fourth, grandson of Louis the Fourteenth, had been placed upon the throne of that kingdom, and had been received with the joyful concurrence of the greatest part of his subjects. He had also been nominated successor of the crown by the late king of Spain's will. But in a former treaty among the powers of Eimope, Charles, son of the emperor of Germany, was appointed heir to that crown: and his treaty had been guaranteed by France herself, though she now resolved to reverse that consent in favour of a descendant of the house of Bourbon. Charles was still farther led on to put in for the crown of Spain by the invitation of the Catalonians, who declared in his favour, and by the assistance of the English and Portuguese, who pro mised to arm in his cause. He was furnished with 200 trans ports, 30 ships of war, and 9000 men, for the conquest of that extensive empire. But the earl of Peterborough, a man of romantic bravery, offered to conduct them, and his single service was thought equivalent to armies. The earl of Peterborough was one of the most singular and extraordinary men of the age in which he lived. When yet but fifteen, he fought against the Moors in Africa ; at twenty, he assisted in compassing the Revolution; and he now carried on the war in Spain almost at his own expense ; his friendship"], [229, "215 for the duke Charles being one of his chief motives to this great undertaking. He was deformed in his person; but of a mind the most generous, honourable, and active. His first attempt upon landing in Spain was the taking Barcelona, a strong city, with a garrison of 5000 men, while his whole army amounted to little more than nine thousand. These successes, however, were but of short continuance; Peterborough being recaded, and the army under Charles being commanded by the lord Galway. This nobleman having received intedigence that the enemy, under the command of the duke of Berwick, was posted near the town of Almanza, he advanced thither to give him battle. The conflict began about two in the afternoon, and the whole front of each army was fufly engaged. The centre, consisting chiefly of battadons from Great Britain and Holland, seemed at first victorious; but the Portuguese horse, by whom they were \u2022 supported , betaking themselves to flight on the first charge, the English troops were flanked and surrounded on every side. In this dreadful emergency, they formed themselves into a square, and retired to an eminence, where being ignorant of the country, and destitute of ad supplies, they were obliged to surrender pris oners of war , to the number of 10000 men. This victory was complete and decisive; and ad Spain, except the province of Catalonia, returned to their duty to Phdip their sovereign. The Union with Scotland. The councils of the queen had hitherto been governed by a whig ministry J) ; for though the duke of Marlborough had first started in the tory interest, he soon joined the opposite 1) Tory was a word of reproach applied by the country to the court party in the latter part of the reign of Charles II. ; these , in return, calling the country party Whigs. A Tory then signified an Irish outlaw or robber, who used to demand money by the exclamation \u201eToree!\" give me. Whig (sour milk) was a nickname for the sour-faced Scotch coven anters. In its present meaning, a Tory is understood to be one who, in political principles, always leans to the church and state; a Whig to be one who upholds the principles of the revolution of 1688, and such political measures as strengthen the liberty of the subjects."], [230, "216 faction, as he found them most sincere in their desire to humble the power of France. The whigs, therefore, stdl pursued the schemes of the late king; and impressed with a repubdcan spirit of liberty, strove to humble despotism in every part of Europe. In a government where the reasoning of individuals, retired from power, generally leads those who command, the designs of the ministry must alter as the people happen to change. The people, in fact, were beginning to change. But, previous to the disgrace of the whig ministry, whose fad was now hastening, a measure of the greatest importance took place in pardament; a measure that had been wished by many, but though too difficult for execution. What I mean is, the Union between the two kingdoms of England and Scotland; which, though they had been governed by one sovereign since the accession of James the First, yet were stid rided by then respective pardaments, and often professed to pursue opposite interests and different designs. The attempt for a Union was begun at the commencement of this reign; but some disputes arising relative to the trade to the East, the conference was broken up, and it was thought that an adjustment would be impossible. It was revived by an act in either pardament, granting power to commissioners named on the part of both nations, to treat on the preliminary articles of a Union, which should afterwards undergo a more thorough discussion by the legislative body x) of both king doms. The choice of these commissioners was left to the queen; and she took care that none should be employed but such as heartily wished to promote so desirable a measure. Accordingly the queen having appointed commissioners on both sides, they met in the council- chamber of the Cock-pit 2) near Whitehall, which was the place appointed for their con ferences. As the queen frequently exhorted them to dispatch, the articles of this famous Union were soon agreed to, and signed ; and it only remained to lay them before the parliaments of both nations. In this famous treaty, it was stipulated that the succession 1) Durch den gesetzgebenden Korper, d. h. durch das Parlament. 2) A cock-pit is a place where cocks fight."], [231, "217 to the united kingdoms should be vested in the house of Hanover; that the united kingdoms should be represented by one and the same parliament; that all the subjects of Great Britain should enjoy a communication of privileges and ad vantages ; that they should have the same allowance and privi leges with respect to commerce and customs; that the laws concerning public right, civil government, and policy, should be the same through the two united kingdoms; but that no alteration should be made in laws which concerned private rights, except for the evident benefit of the subjects of Scot land ; that ad courts of judicature x) in Scotland should remain as then constituted by the laws of that kingdom, with the same authority and privdeges as before the Union; that Scot land should be represented in the pardament of Great Britain by 16 peers and 45 commoners2), to be elected in such a manner as shoidd be settled by the present parliament of Scot land, that all peers of Scotland should be considered as peers of Great Britain, and rank immediately after the English peers of the like degrees, at the time of the Union, and before such as should be created after it; that they should enjoy all the privileges of English peers, except that of sitting in parliament, or voting the trial of a peer ; that ad the insignia 3) of royalty and government should remain as they were; that ad laws and statutes in either kingdom, so far as they might be in consistent with the terms of these articles, should cease, and be declared void by the respective pardaments of the two kingdoms. These were the principal articles of the Union; and it only remained to obtain the sanction of the legislature of both kingdoms to give them authority. The arguments in these different assemblies were suited to the audience. To induce the Scotch parliament to come into 4) the measure, it was alleged, by the ministry and their supporters, that an entire and perfect Union would be the solid fundation of a lasting peace. It would secure their redgion, liberty, and 1) Gerichtshofe. 2) In the year 1832, the number of the commoners was increased to 53 : 30 for counties, and 23 for towns. 3) Insignien, Wiirdezeichen. 4) Einwilligen in \u2014"], [232, "218 property; remove the animosities that prevailed among them selves, and the jealousies that subsisted among the two nations. It would increase their strength, riches, and commerce; the whole island would be joined in affection, and freed from ad apprehensions of different interests. It would be enabled to resist ad its enemies, support the protestant interests, and maintain the liberties of Europe. It was observed that the less the wheels of government were clogged by a multipdcity of councds, the more vigorous would be their exertions. They were shown that the taxes which, in consequence of this Union, they were to pay, were by no means so proportionably great as their share in the legislature was more than a tenth part. Such were the arguments in favour of the Union, addressed to the Scotch pardament. In the English houses it was observed that a powerful and dangerous nation would thus for ever be prevented from giving them any disturbance. That in case of any future rupture, England had every thing to lose, and nothing to gain, against a nation that was courageous and poor. On the other hand, the Scots were fired with indignation at the thought of losing their ancient and independent govern ment. The nobdity found themselves degraded in point of dignity and influence, by being excluded from their seats in parliament. The trading part of the nation beheld their com merce loaded with heavy duties, and considered their new privi lege of trading to the Engdsh plantations in the West Indies as a very uncertain advantage. In the English houses also it was observed, that the union of a rich with a poor nation woidd always be beneficial to the latter, and that the former could only hope for a participation of their necessities. It was said that the Scots reluctantly yielded to this coadtion, and it might be likened to a marriage with a woman against her consent. It was supposed to be a union made up of so many unmatched pieces, and such incongruous ingredients, that it could never take effect. It was complained, that the proportion of the land-tax r) paid by the Scots was smad, and unequal to their share in the legislature. 1) Grundsteuer."], [233, "219 At length, notwithstanding all opposition made by the tories, every article of the union was approved by a great majority in both parliaments. Thus all were obliged to acquiesce in a union, of which they at first had not sagacity to distinguish the advantages. Sacheverel. In the mean time, the whig ministry was every day de clining. Among the number of those whom the duchess of Marlborough had introduced to the queen, to contribute to her private amusement, was one Mrs. Masham, her own kinswoman, whom she had raised from indigence and obscurity. The duchess, having gained an ascendancy over the queen, became petulant and insolent, and relaxed in those arts by which she had risen Mrs. Masham, who had her fortune to make, was more humble and assiduous , she flattered the \u2022 foibles of the queen, and assented to her prepossessions and prejudices. She soon saw the queen's inclination to the tory set of opinions, their divine right, and passive obedience ; and instead of attempt ing to thwart her, as the duchess had done, she joined in with her partiality, and even outwent her in her own way. This lady was, in fact, the tool of Mr. Harley, secretary of state, who also some time before had insinuated himself into the queen's good graces, and who determined to sap the credit of the whig ministers. His aim was to unite the tory interest under his own shelter, and to expel the whigs from the ad vantages which they had long enjoyed under government. In his career of ambition, he chose for his coadjutor, Henry St. John, afterwards the famous lord Bolingbroke, a man of great eloquence, and greater ambition, enterprising, restless, active, and haughty, with some wit and little principle. To this junta l) was added Sir Simon Harcourt, a man of great abdities. It was now perceived that the people themselves began to be weary of the whig ministry, whom they formerly caressed. 1) In the original Spanish, Junta is a congress or council in a good sense ; as an English word, a set of men joined for a purpose not deemed praiseworthy, a cabal."], [234, "220 To them they imputed the burdens under which they groaned, burdens which they had been hitherto animated to bear by the pomp of triumph; but the load of which they felt in a pause of success. Harley, afterwards known by the title of lord Oxford, was the bottom of all these complaints: and though they did not produce an immediate effect, yet they did not fad of a growing and steady operation. At length the wig part of the ministry opened their eyes to the intrigues of the tories. But it was now too late, they had entirely lost the confidence of the queen. Harley soon threw off the mask of friendship, and took more vigorous measures for the prosecution of his designs. In him the queen reposed ad her trust, though he had now no visible concern in administration. The first triumph of the tories, in which the queen discovered the pubdc partiality in their favour, was seen in a transaction of no great importance in itself, but from the consequences it produced. The parties of the nation were eager to engage, and they wanted but the watch-word to begin. This was given by a man neither of abdities, property, or power, but whom accident brought forward on this occasion. Henry Sacheverel was a clergyman bred at Oxford, of narrow intellects, and an overheaded imagination. He had acquired some popularity among those who had distinguished themselves by the name of high- churchmen1), and had taken ad occasions to vent his animosity against the dissenters. At the summer assizes 2) for Derby, he held forth in that strain before the judges. On the 5\"1 of November, in St. Paul's church, he, in a violent declamation, defended the doctrine of non resistance 3) , inveighed against the toleration of dissenters, declared the church was dangerously attacked by its enemies, and slightly defended by its false friends. He sounded the trumpet for the zealous, and exhorted the people to put on the 1) Hochkirchliche ; High-Church die anglikanische Kirche; dissenter. nonconformist, one who differs from the High-Church. 2) Schwurgericht. 3) Non-resistance, Nichtwiderstand, passiver Gehorsam."], [235, "221 whole armour of God. Sir Samuel Gerrard, lord mayor, coun tenanced this harangue, which, though very weak both in the matter and style, was published under his protection, and extolled by the tories as a master -piece of writing. These sermons owed ad their celebrity to the complexion of the times, and they are now deservedly neglected. Mr. Dolben, son of the archbishop of York, laid a complaint before the House of Commons against these rhapsodies x), and thus gave force to what would have been soon forgotten. The most violent paragraphs were read, and the sermons voted scandalous and seditious libels. Sacheverel was brought to the bar 2) of the House, and he, far from disowning the writing of them, gloried in what he had done, and mentioned the en couragement he had received to publish them from the lord mayor, who was then present. Being ordered to withdraw, it was resolved to impeach him of high crimes and misdemeanors, at the bar of the House of Lords; and Mr. Dolben was fixed upon to conduct the prosecution, in the name of the Commons of England. A committee was appointed to draw up articles of impeachment, Sacheverel was taken into custody, and a day was appointed for his trial before the Lords in West minster-had. The eyes of the whole kingdom were turned upon this very extraordinary trial, which lasted three weeks, and excluded ad other public business for the time.

They surrounded the queen's sedan, exclaiming \u201eGod bless your Majesty and the church; we hope your majesty is for Doctor Sacheverel.\" They destroyed several meeting houses, plundered the dwedings of many eminent dis senters, and even proposed to attack the Bank. The queen, in compdance with the request of the Commons, published a proclamation for suppressing the tumults; and several persons being apprehended, were tried for high treason. Two were convicted, and sentenced to die, but neither suffered. When the Commons had gone through their charge, the managers for Sacheverel undertook his defence with great art and eloquence. He afterwards recited a speech himself, which, from the difference found between it and his sermons, seems evidently the work as another. In this he solemnly justified his intentions towards the queen and her government. He spoke in the most respectful terms of the Revolution, and the protestant succession. He maintained the doctrine of non resistance as a tenet of the church in whicv he was brought up; and in a pathetic conclusion, endeavoured to excite the pity of his audience. At length, after much obstinate dispute and virulent alter cation, Sacheverel was found guilty by a majority of 17 voices; but no less than 34 peers entered a protest against this decision. He was prohibited from preaching for three years; and his two sermons were ordered to be burned by the hand of the common hangman, in the presence of the lord mayor and the two sheriffs. The lenity of this sentence, which was in a great measure owing to the dread of popular resentment, was con sidered by the tories as a triumph. Such was the complexion of the times when the queen thought proper to summon a new parliament; and being a friend to the tories herself, she gave the people an opportunity of indulging themselves in choosing representatives to then mind. In fact, very few were returned but such as had distin guished themselves by their zeal against the whig adminis tration."], [237, "223 The Treaty of Utrecht. In the mean time, the campaign in Flanders was con ducted with the most brilliant success. The duke of Marl borough had every motive to continue the war, as it gratified not only his ambition, but hi3 avarice ; a passion that obscured his shining abdities. The king of France appeared extreemly desirous of a peace, and resolved to solicit a conference. He employed one Perkum, resident of the duke of Holstein at the Hague, to negotiate upon this subject; and he ventured also to solicit the duke himself in private. A conference was at length begun at Gertruydenburgh, under the induence of Marlborough, Eugene, and Rinzendorf, who were ad three, from private motives, entirely averse to the treaty. Upon this occasion, the French ministers were subjected to every species of mortification. Spies were placed upon ad their conduct, their master was insulted, and their letters were opened; till at last Louis resolved to hazard another campaign. It was only by insensible degrees that the queen seemed to acquire courage enough to second her incdnation, and dis miss a ministry that long had been disagreeable to her. Harley, however, who still shared her confidence, did not fail to incul cate the popularity, the justice, and the security of such a measure; and in consequence of his advice, she began the changes , by transferring the post of lord chamberlain x) from the duke of Kent to the duke of Shrewsbury, who had lately voted with the tories, and maintained an intimate correspond ance with Mr. Harley. Soon after, the earl of Sunderland, secretary of state, and son-in-law to the duke of Marlborough, was displaced, and the earl of Dartmouth put in his room. Finding that she was rather applauded than condemned for this resolute proceeding, she resolved to become entirely free. Soon after, the earl of Godolphin was divested of his office, and the treasury put in commission2), subject to the direction 1) Oberkammerherr.

The earl of Rochester was declared pre sident of the council, in the room of lord Somers. The staff of lord-steward 2) being taken from the duke of Devonshire, was given to the duke of Buckingham ; and Mr-. Boyle was removed from the secretary office, to make way for Mr. Henry St John. The lord chancellor3) having resigned the great seal, it was first put in commission, and then given to Sir Simon Harcourt. The earl of Wharton surrendered his commission of lord lieu tenant of Ireland; and that employment was conferred upon the duke of Ormond. Mr. George Grenville was appointed secre tary at war4), in the room of Mr. Robert Walpole; and, in a word, there was not one whig left in any office of the state, except the duke of Marlborough. He was stid continued the reluctant general of the army; but he justly considered him self as a ruin entirely undermined, and just ready to fad. But the triumph was not yet complete, until the parliament was brought to confirm and approve the queen's choice. The queen in her speech recommended the prosecution of the war with vigour. The parliament were ardent in their expressions of zeal and unanimity. They exhorted her to discountenance all such principles and measures as had lately threatened her royal crown and dignity. This was but an opening to what soon after fodowed. The duke of Malborough, who, but a few months before, had been so highly extolled and caressed by the representatives of the people, was now become the object of their hatred and reproach. His avarice was justly upbraided; his protracting the war was said to arise from that motive. Instances were every where given of his fraud and extortion. These might be true; but party had no moderation, and even his courage and conduct were caded in question. To mortify the duke still more, the thanks of the house of Commons were voted to the earl of Peterborough for his services in Spain, when they were refused to the duke for those in Flanders; 1) Kanzler der Schatzkammer. 2) Hofmarschall. 3) Grosskanzler , Grosssiegelbewahrer , the lord keeper of the great seal. 4) Kriegsminister."], [239, "225 and the lord keeper, who delivered them to Peterborough, took occasion to drop some redections upon the mercenary disposition of his rival. Nothing now, therefore, remained of the whig system, upon which this reign was begun, but the war, which continued to rage as fiercely as ever, and which increased in expense every year as it went on. It was the resolution of the present min istry to put an end to it at any rate, as it had involved the nation in debt almost to bankruptcy ; and as it promised, instead of humbling the enemy, only to become habitual , to the con stitution. It only remained to remove the duke of Marlborough from his post, as he would endeavour to traverse all their negotiations. But here again a difficulty was started : this step could not be taken without giving offence to the Dutch, who placed entire confidence in him; they were obliged therefore, to wait for some convenient occasion. Upon his return from this campaign he was accused of having taken a bribe of 6000 pounds a year from a Jew, who contracted to supply the army with bread; and the queen thought proper to dismiss him from all his employments. This was the pretext made use of, though his fall had been predetermined; and though his receiving such a bribe was not the real cause of his removal, yet candour must confess that it ought to be so. In the mean time Prior, much more famous as a poet than a statesman, was sent over with proposals to France; and Menager, also a dterary man, returned with Prior to London, with full powers to treat upon the preliminaries. The ministry having got thus far, the great difficulty still lay before them, of making the terms of peace agreeable to all the confederates. The earl of Stafford, who had been lately recaded from the Hague, where he resided as ambassador, was now sent back to Hodand, with orders to communicate with the pensionary x) Heinsius the preliminary proposals, to signify the queen's approbation of them, and to propose a place where the plenipotentiaries should assemble. The Dutch were very 1) Der (ehem.) erste Minister von Holland ; it was the name of the first minister of state under the old republican government of Holland. 15"], [240, "226 averse to begin the conference, upon the inspection of the pre dminaries. They sent over an envoy to attempt to turn the queen from her resolution; but finding their efforts vain, they fixed upon Utrecht as the place of general conference, and they granted passports to the French ministers accordingly. The conference began at Utrecht under the conduct of Robinson, bishop of Bristol, lord privy-seal1), and the earl of Stafford, on the side of the English, of Buys and Vanderdussen on the part of the Dutch, and of the marshal d'Uxelles, the cardinal Polignac, and Mr. Menager, in behalf of France. The ministers of the Emperor and the duke of Savoy assisted, and the other allies sent also plenipotentiaries, though with the utmost reluctance. As England and France were the only two powers that were seriously inclined to peace, it*-mayT be supposed that all the other deputies served rather to retard than advance its progress. They met rather to start new difficulties, and widen the breach, than to quiete the dissensions of Europe. The English ministers, therefore, finding multipded ob structions from the deliberations of their aides, set on foot a private negotiation with France. They stipulated certain ad vantages for the subjects of Great Britain in a concerted plan of peace. They resolved to enter into such mutual confidence with the French, as would anticipate ad clandestine transactions to the prejudice of the coalition. In the beginning of August, secretary St. John, who had been created Viscount 2) Bolingbroke, was sent to the court of Versaides, to remove ad obstructions to the separate treaty. He was accompanied by Mr. Prior and the Abbe Gaultier, and treated with the most distinguished marks of respect. He was caressed by the French king, and the marquis de Torcy, with whom he adjusted the principal interests of the duke of Savoy and the elector of Bavaria. At length the treaties of peace and commerce between England and France being agreed on by the plenipotentiaries 1) Geheimsiegelbewahrer. 2) Vicomte, a title of nobility next below an earl."], [241, "227 on either side, and ratified by the queen, she acquainted her pardament of the steps she had taken. The articles of this famous treaty were longer canvassed, and more warmly debated, than those of any other treaty read of in history. The number of different interests concerned, and the great enmity and jealousy subsisting between all, made it impossible that all could be satisfied; and indeed, there seemed no other method of obtaining peace but that which was taken, for the two principal powers concerned to make their own articles, and to leave the rest for a subject of future discussion. The first stipulation was, that Philip, how acknowledged king of Spain, should renounce all right to the crown of France, the union of two such powerful kingdoms being thought dangerous to the liberties of Europe. It was agreed that the duke of Berry, Philip's brother, and after him in succession, should also renounce his right to the crown of Spain, in case he became Icing of France. It was stipulated, that the duke of Savoy should possess the island of Sicily, with the title of king, together with Fenestrelles, and other places on the Con tinent ; which increase of dominion was in some measme made out of the spoils of the French monarchy. The Dutch had that barrier granted them which they so long sought after; and if the crown of France was deprived of some dominions to enrich the duke of Savoy, on the other hand the house of Austria was ' taxed to supply the wants of the Hollanders, who Mere put in possession of the strongest towns in Flanders. With regard to England, its glory and its interest was secured. The fortifications of Dunkirch, a harbour that might be dan gerous to their trade in time of war, was ordered to be demolished, and its ports destroyed. Spain gave up all right to Gibraltar, and the island of Minorca. France resigned her pretensions to Hudson's Bay, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland; but they were left in possession of Cape Breton and the liberty of drying their fish upon the shore. Among these articles, glorious to the English nation, their setting free the French protestants, confined in the prisons and gadeys for their redgion, was not the least meritorious. For the Emperor it was stipulated that lie should possess the kingdom of Naples, the duchy of Milan, 15*"], [242, "228 and the Netherlands. The king of Prussia was to have Upper Gueldern ; and a time was fixed for the Emperor's acceding to to these articles, as he had for some time obstinately refused to assist at the negotiation. Thus Europe seemed to be formed into one great repubdc, the different members of which were cantoned out to different governors, and the ambition of any one state rendered amenable to the tribunal of all. Thus it appears that the English ministry did justice to ad the world; but their country denied that justice to them. But whde the whigs were attacking the tory ministers from without, these were in much greater danger from their own internal dissensions. Lord Oxford and lord Bolingbroke, though they had started with the same principles and designs, yet, having vanquished other opposers, now began to turn their strength against each other. Both began to form separate interests, and to adopt different principles. Oxford's plan was the more moderate; Bolingbroke's the more vigorous, but the more secure. Oxford, it was thought, was entirely for the Hanover succession; Bolingbroke had some hopes of bringing in the Pretender 2). But though they hated each other most sincerely, yet they were for a while kept together by the good offices of their friends and adherents, who had the melancholy prospect of seeing the citadel of their hopes, while openly besieged from without, secretly undermined within. This was a mortifying prospect to the tories; but it was more particularly displeasing to the queen, who daily saw her favourite ministry declining, while her own health kept pace with their contentions. Her constitution was now quite broken. One fit of sickness succeeded another, and what completed the ruin of her health, was the anxiety of her mind. These dis sensions had such an effect upon her spirits and constitution, that she declared she could not outdve it, and soon after sunk into a state of lethargic insensibility. Notwithstanding ad the medicines which the physicians could prescribe, the distemper 1) The Elector of Hanover was descended, on the mother's side, from Elizabeth, daughter of James the First.

All the members, without distinction, being summoned from the different parts of the kingdom, began to provide for the security of the constitution. They sent a letter to the elector of Hanover, informing him of the queen's desperate situation, and desiring him to repair to Holland, where he would be attended by a British squadron to convey him to England. At the same time they dispatched instructions to the earl of Stafford, at the Hague, to desire the States-general x) to be ready to perform the guarantee of the protestant succes sion. Precautions were taken to secure the sea-ports; and the command of the deet was bestowed upon the earl of Berkely, a professed whig. These measures which were all dictated by that party, answered a double end. It argued their own alacrity in the cause of their new sovereign, and seemed to imply a danger to the state, from the disaffection of the opposite interest. On the 13'h of July, the queen seemed somewhat relieved by medicines, rose from her bed about eight o'clock, and walked a little. After some time, casting her eyes on a clock that stood in her chamber, she continued to gaze at it for some minutes. One of the ladies in waiting asked her what she saw there more than usual; to which the queen only ans wered by turning her eyes upon her with a dying look. She was soon after seized with a fit of apoplexy; she continued ad night in a state of stupefaction, and expired the following morning, in the 49th year of her age. She reigned more than 12 years, over a people who had now risen to the highest pitch of refinement, who had attained to opulence by their industry, and to security and power by their valour and conduct. 1) Generalstaaten, the assembly who transacted the concerns common to the United Provinces."], [244, "230 Conquest The Kings of England after the The Normans.
