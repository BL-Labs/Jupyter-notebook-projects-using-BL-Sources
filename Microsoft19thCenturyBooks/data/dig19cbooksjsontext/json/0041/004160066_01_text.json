The reasons which led the committee to begin their work with Bambnrghshire have been already mentioned in the preface to the first volume, where it is also stated that it was found necessary to confine that volume to the parish of Bamburgh and the chapelry of Belford, and to leave the district between Bamburgh and the Ain to be dealt with subsequently. The history of this district, which includes the parishes of Embleton, EUingham, Howick, Long Houghton, and Lesbury, is inves tigated in the following pages. As little more than a year has elapsed since the first instalment of this work was issued, it should be explained that the second volume was to a large extent prepared at the time of the publication of the first, but, not withstanding this, so much remained to be done that it would have been impossible to produce a second volume so soon, had it not been for the active help rendered by two members of the committee, namely, the Rev. William Greenwell, and Mr. Crawford Hodgson. The very valuable assistance afforded by these gentlemen in the production of the first volume has been already the subject of special acknowledgment, and the committee desire to again make known their deep indebtedness to them for the help they have given in the present instance. In order that their assistance may be properly appreciated, it will be sufficient to state that not only has Mr. Greenwell personally superintended all the affairs connected with the pro duction of this volume, but has devoted a large amount of valuable time to transcribing many of the records of the Dean and Chapter of Durham under his care, which have been so largely used in the preparation of this work. He has, moreover, written the architectural descriptions of the ecclesiastical buildings in the district now dealt with, and has thereby enabled the com mittee to have the benefit of his experience in antiquarian and architectural"], [14, "VI PREFACE. matters. Mr. Greenwell's other services are not more fully referred to here, because they are too numerous to mention. The same may be said of the help afforded by Mr. Crawford Hodgson, who has allowed the committee to derive the fullest advantage from his unrivalled knowledge of genealogy. All the pedigrees contained in this volume have been produced under his supervision, and the parts of those pedigrees which relate to family history after the sixteenth century have been exclusively compiled by him. The value of Mr. Crawford Hodgson's help will be readily perceived, as no amount of labour on the part of persons lacking his peculiar qualifications could have produced similar results. Nor has Mr. Crawford Hodgson's help been confined to pedigrees, for he has spared neither time, trouble, nor expense, to give additional completeness to every part of this work. In other departments also the committee have been so fortunate as to receive ungrudging voluntary aid, in some cases involving an expenditure of much time and money, from many persons to whom it is already under deep obligations. Among those to whom the committee are most indebted is Mr. Edmund Garwood, who has continued the very able series of geological articles which have already excited the admiration of students of that science. The committee also desire to thank Mr. Scott Bertram and Mr. C. J. Spence for their help in furnishing some of the illustrations. The photogravure engravings have again been made from photographs specially taken by Mr. J. P. Gibson, of Hexham. The committee are glad to be able to state that they have continued to enjoy the best possible facilities for the examination of private muniments. The frequent reference which is made to the Duke of Northumberland's manuscripts in the following pages will suffice to indicate the great freedom which his Grace has been so kind as to allow the committee in the exami- nation of the vast stores of records of every description in his possession. It is also with peculiar pleasure that the committee take this opportunity of thanking Mr. William Woodman, of Morpeth, for the help he has given."], [15, "PREFACE. VII The Rev. John Hodgson in the preface to one of his volumes, written more than sixty years ago, mentioned Mr. Woodman's name with gratitude, and it is a pleasing reflection that one who assisted Mr. Hodgson has been able to render not less valuable help to a work which is intended to complete and supplement the labours of the great historian of Northumberland. It is scarcely necessary to add that the Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle-upon- Tyne has continued to further the objects of the committee in every possible way. The committee are indebted to the society for permission to reprint the history of the castle of Dunstanburgh written by Mr. Bates. The architectural descriptions of the towers at Embleton vicarage, Craster, Rock and Proctor Steads have also been contributed by Mr. Bates. Amongst other gentlemen to whom the committee desire to make grateful acknowledgment are the following : Mr. Joseph Archer, Mr. John Bolam, Mr. Robert Bolam, Mr. Thomas Bosworth, Mr. William Brown, Mr. Frank Brumell, Mr. John Craster of Craster, Mr. John Craster of Penicuik, Mr. F. W. Dendy, Rev. H. G. Dickinson, the Rev. A. A. Edmondson, the Rev. W. R. Finch, the late Earl Grey, Sir Edward Grey, the Rev. C. E.

Hindmarsh, Mr. C. C. Hodges, Mr. J. J. Howe of the Durham Probate Registry, Professor Lebour, the bursar of Merton College, Oxford, the Rev. Canon M. Osborn, Mr. Stephen Sanderson of Berwick-on-Tweed, Mr. George Skelly, Lord Tankerville, the Marquis of Waterford, and the Rev. W. Wilson. With the publication of this volume the connection of Mr. Bateson with the History of Northumberland as Editor ceases. It is a matter of great regret to the committee that unavoidable circumstances should have prevented Mr. Bateson from remaining in his position as Editor, but, as he is to continue a member of the committee, it is hoped that the History will not altogether be deprived of his counsel and help."], [16, "VIII PREFACE. The favourable reception which has been accorded to the first two volumes is due, the committee venture to suggest, to their intrinsic merits, and those the committee have no hesitation in attributing, in a great measure, to the energy, research, and scholarly learning which Mr. Bateson has bestowed upon the work. The regret with which the committee regard his loss is equalled by the gratitude they feel for the way in which their labours have been lessened and their success ensured by the skill, thoughtfulness, and good temper with which Mr. Bateson has conducted his very difficult duty."], [17, "CONTENTS.

THE parish of Embleton lies immediately to the south of Bamburgh, and is bounded by the sea upon the east, by the parishes of AInwick, Long Houghton, and Howick on the south, and by Ellingham on the west. It is more than seven miles long from the mouth of Tuggal burn to the southern boundary of the township of Broxfield, and about five and a half miles broad from the promontory on which Dunstanburgh castle stands to Rock Nab, a point slightly to the west of the great north road. The parish includes the ten townships of Embleton, Stamford, Newton-by-the-sea, Brunton, Fallodon, Rock, Rennington, Broxfield, Craster, and Dunstan. The district contained within these limits will be found worthy of study and observation from very different points of view. The rocky outlines of the coast will attract those who love severity and grandeur in scenery ; whilst the phenomena of the igneous and stratified alternation of the rock masses themselves will repay their careful study by the geologist. The student of architecture will find much worthy of notice in the parish church and in the colossal ruins of Dunstanburgh castle, a fortress in striking contrast with the small but solid towers, still to be found built in as the core of many dwelling houses now adapted to more peaceful lives. The records of the parish will be found more than usually full. The history of the church is preserved in the muniments of Merton college, Oxford ; that of the ancient barony of Embleton and the fortress which sprang up in its midst, amongst the documents of the duchy of Lancaster. Lastly, there is scarcely a hamlet in the parish which does not yield material for family history. At Craster the representatives of one of the Vol. II. i"], [24, "2 EMBLETON PARISH. oldest families in Northumberland are still to be found, but of some nothing but the name and the descent of a few generations can be recovered from ancient and scattered deeds. The respective townships will be described in turn, but before proceed ing further, the geology of the parish requires a careful description. GEOLOGY.1 In this parish there is a modified repetition of the beds already described in Bamburgh parish, and here again, owing to the situation on the coast, there is an almost complete natural section of the strata. This section forms an important key to the geology of the district, and since it exhibits many inter esting features, and moreover constitutes one ofthe finest portions of the coast scenery of the county, it is worthy of somewhat detailed examination.2 Tuggal burn, which forms the northern boundary of the parish, falls into the sea through the low sand dunes known as Newton Links. This sandy tract, like others on the coast, suggests a dislocation in the immediate neigh bourhood, and a fault of some magnitude strikes the coast between the mouth ofthe burn and Newton North Farm. Close to the last-named place outcrops of shale occur containing a bed of coal, 10 inches thick, and dipping south at an angle of 8 degrees. These are seen passing under the whin, which, owing to its superior hardness, remains as a peninsula at Snook Point, and also forms Whit tingham Carr and Robin Wood's rock. Immediately overlying the whin is a thick buff fossiliferous limestone, the ' Ebb's Nook ' or ' Great ' Limestone, which constitutes the northern boundary of Football Hole. The succeeding sand dunes mark the trough of a synclinal, possibly faulted, so that, after passing an outcrop of false-bedded sandstone, the limestone is again encountered resting on the whin as before, but dipping in the opposite direction. A small fault then brings in the whin again, dipping in the usual direction to the south east at 8 degs., and overlain as before by the Great Limestone, with which it forms Newton Point. The shale bed is seen under the whin near the flag- 1 A general introduction to the geology of the parishes dealt with in this volume will be found at the beginning of volume i. It has been found necessary, for convenience of description and in order to avoid a disconnected treatment, to group the detailed geology ofthe parishes of Howick, Long Houghton and Lesbury in one article, which will be found at the beginning of the portion of this volume devoted to the parish of Howick. 2 References to previous notes and diagrams of this section will be found in vol. i. app. i. 7 12 to."], [25, "GEOLOGY. 3 staff, while in places the whin is seen to have varied its exact horizon and to have left some of the upper layers of the shale between itself and the overlying limestone. These outcrops ofthe whin are the first which appear on the coast to the south of Bamburgh, the absence of any whin in the intermediate area being no doubt due to the fact that the outcrop of the whin sweeps out under the sea to the Fame Islands, although there can be little doubt that the country between Spindleston and Newton represents a much-faulted anticlinal arch, the centre of which has undergone very great denudation, resulting in the entire removal of the once continuous dome of whin. Travelling south we find shales and shaly sandstone, until, at Embleton, the whin is again faulted in by one of the strike-faults prevalent in the district, and runs inland by Fish Carr, Newbiggin, and the mouth of the burn to Embleton and Embleton South Farm, always associated with the Great Limestone which is found on the coast at Jenny Bell's Carr. The whin next reappears on the coast at Dunstanburgh and forms the points on which the castle is built, and from here it runs uninterruptedly to Cullernose, being still overlain by the Great Limestone, which forms the island 'Carrs' off Craster. The position of the whin among the beds of the Carboniferous Limestone formation, after its reappearance at Newton, is therefore considerably higher in the series than when last seen to the north of Bamburgh. Tate estimates the relative difference of level at 400 feet,1 though its exact horizon at Bamburgh is somewhat conjectural. North of Dunstanburgh another fault, running past Dunstan Stead on to the links, brings in thick beds of sandstone and shales lower in the series, dipping south-east at angles of 3 degs. to 8 degs., which are succeeded by an outcrop of the Four-fathom Limestone. This limestone, owing to its proximity to the whin, immediately to the south, east, and west, here assumes a quaquaversal dip. On the shore, near high-water mark, the southern portion of the fold has been denuded, resulting in the formation of a beautiful undulating east and west outcrop, locally famous as the 'Grey mare' or 'Saddle' rock. The upper bed of limestone, 3 feet thick, is seen to have slid slightly over the lower layers, and to have been separated from them where it rises to form the crest of the fold. Numerous veins of calcite appear to be connected with this disturbance, and two sets of joints traverse the limestone in east- 1 Vol. i. app. i. 19."], [26, "EMBLETON PARISH. 4 south-east, and south-south-west directions respectively, the joints of each set being markedly parallel. Further on the limestone is seen dipping under the shales to the south-south-west. To the south, the low shore, thickly strewn with wave-worn boulders of glossy whin, terminates abruptly in the grand cliff forming Dunstanburgh Point, which, at Gull Crag and Castle Point, rises from the sea in a sheer precipice of upwards of 120 feet. Seventy feet of the lower portion of this cliff are composed of sandstones and shales overlain by 40 to 50 feet of columnar whin. Section in Dunstanburgh Cliff. Feet. Shale (much hardened) 4 Whin (columnar) 5\u00b0 Shales (black) *3 Sandstone (grey, full of iron and false-bedded) 8 Shales (dark, thin-bedded) 18 Shales (sandy) J6 passing down into Sandstone (pink, false-bedded) io In several places shales are found caught up in the whin or lying in metamorphosed patches on its surface. One layer, 3 feet thick and much altered, is visible about 60 yards from the castle wall, on the northern edge of the cliff, embedded vertically in the basalt. At the Rumble Churn included fragments of limestone and the sandstone underlying it are much altered, with the development of garnets and other secondary minerals of pyro-metamorphism, the vesicles in the whin near the contact often containing beautiful little bunches of quartz, frequently amethystine. The non-ame thystine crystals are locally famous as 'Dunstanburgh diamonds.' As far as Cullernose, two miles to the south of the Castle Point, the rocky coast-line is formed by the slope of the whin dipping gently to the east, its surface plastered with fragments of altered quartzite and overlain at the 'Carrs' at Craster by the Great Limestone, whilst, beneath its western escarpment, the thick sandstone bed crops out, which was formerly worked in 'Scotsman's quarry' under Craster Heugh. This bed passes, towards its base, into a coarse felspathic grit, the fragments of pink felspar often exceeding a quarter of an inch in diameter. From beneath the underlying shales to the west rises the Four-fathom Limestone, of which the outcrop can be seen sweeping"], [27, "GEOLOGY. 5 round from the ' Grey mare ' southward ; and further to the west again appear the Six-yard and Nine-yard Limestones and their intervening sandstones and shales in succession. At Cullernose Point the outcrop of the whin leaves the coast, while the sedimentary rocks are shifted to the north-east by a small dip fault. In Swine Den, the bay immediately to the south of Cullernose Point, there occurs one of the most interesting sections along the whole course of the whin.1 Here are seen embedded in the basalt large blocks of the underlying sedimentary rocks, the sandstone and shale still preserving their relative positions. These are usually much metamorphosed, the most noteworthy being a thin shale spotted and much brecciated, overlying the sandstone on the north side of the path leading down from the cliff, and fragments of the previously mentioned felspathic grit which have been completely enveloped in the basalt and recrystallized with the development of red garnets.2 On the south side of the path the whin rises up from beneath the sand stone and overflows on to the top of the underlying shale : small fragments of shale, sandstone and limestone in the form of a vertical breccia, here embedded in the neck of whin, seem to mark the spot where the fault already mentioned runs out to the coast, and therefore suggest that the formation of the dislocation was contemporaneous with the intrusion of the basaltic sheet. The position ofthe displaced blocks of sandstone and shale, in relation to their parent beds, is admirably displayed in this section. These appear to have been uprooted from below and carried bodily over the rest of the beds to the south, a fact which shows that the direction of flow of the basaltic sheet was approximately from north to south. This is confirmed by the tailing out of the whin on the cliff to the south, and by another section south of Embleton village, where, on the outcrop of the whin, a shale bed has been displaced in a similar direction. Immediately below the last boss of whin, to the south of Swine Den, the wide and undulating outcrop of the Four-fathom Limestone is covered by a thick calcareous shale ; both of these beds are remarkably fossiliferous, especially near their junction, where many of the shells, notably Strophomena, are preserved in iron pyrites on the surface of the bedding planes which are scoured by the breakers during high water.3 To the south the limestone passes down into a shaly sandstone, false bedded and enclosing stigmarian rootlets and the tracks of Nemertites, App. iii. and iv. 2 Ibid. 3 For list of fossils see vol. i. app. i. 7."], [28, "6 EMBLETON PARISH. Crassopodia, and Eione? It is intersected near the shore by a whin dyke, which has been weathered out into a remarkable wall-like ridge, owing to its relatively great powers of resisting marine denudation. This dyke is 4 feet wide, hades 85 degs. south, and strikes north-east and south-west, thus cutting diagonally across the strike of the sandstone and penetrating the limestone further out to sea, while it dies away shorewards and is only represented in the lower part of the cliff by a slight crack. In Tate's notes on the geology of Howick2 he appears to incline to the belief that, although not seen to be actually connected with the whin sill, nevertheless this dyke is an offshoot of it. There seems, however, to be no evidence to support this view, and it is much more probable from microscopic evidence that it belongs to the group of Tertiary dykes found in the district. The sandstones pass downwards into sandy shales with plants, and these again into thin-bedded black shales with ironstone nodules, which, in turn, overlie a calcareous shale filled with numerous individuals of Chonetes Har dr ensis, Productus longispinus, etc. Further south the Six-yard Lime stone rises from beneath these calcareous shales, but arching over in the bay a little north of Saker's Gate, disappears again under the shale at the point. From here the beds dip nearly east, and consequently run almost horizontally along the cliff, until they rise suddenly to the big fault at Howick, due east of Peep o'Sea Farm, where the Six-yard Limestone is again brought up sharply on the north side of the fault. In addition to the coast section, interesting outcrops occur in many parts of the parish. Tate states that the wdiin has a continuous range of six miles from the castle, but this has been found by the officers of the Geological Survey not to be the case. A large boss of whin, however, runs north and south through the village of Embleton, where it is quarried for sets and road metal. The intrusion is here upwards of 50 feet thick, and is markedly vesi cular and amygdaloidal in its upper portion, while in a small working in the village, west of the Glebe Farm, spheroidal weathering is most beautifully exhibited. It is brought up on the north by a fault against the Eight-yard Limestone, and is thrown out on the south by the fault running parallel to Embleton burn a little north of Spittleford bridge, where it is seen in contact with the Great Limestone, which is here magnesian as at Ebb's Nook. From this point the boss tongues up the north side of the burn nearly to the South Vol. i. app. i. 10, and vol. ii. app. i. 2 Vol. i. app i. 7."], [29, "GEOLOGY. 7 Farm, where it finally disappears. Smaller isolated bosses of whin also occur between Newton-by-the-sea and Newton Hall, and at Newton Barns ; while a somewhat larger exposure at Brunton forms the bed of the burn, and is cut off to the north by the fault running south-west from the coast near Newton North Farm. Mention may also be made of two little bosses immediately west ofthe castle, one close to the Saddle rock known as the 'Due,' the other further west on the farm road to Dunstan Stead. The Carboniferous rocks of the parish crop out with fair regularity inland to the east of the railway, the general direction of their strike being north and south ; their outcrop, is, however, discontinuous, owing to the set of north-east and south-west faults, and is also considerably disturbed where it is in proximity to the intrusive whin. This is especially the case immedi ately to the south and east of Embleton, where the relations of the whin to the various outcrops of the Great Limestone are exceedingly complicated. To the east of the railwav as far south as Gallow Moor, the lowest beds seen are about the horizon of the Nine-yard Limestone, but south of Dunstan Hill other beds come in, and the Posidonomya shales near Stamford may possibly represent the well-known shale at Budle. In the township of Rock considerable outcrops of limestone occur, notably between Rock Moor House, Doxford New Houses, Shell Rig, and Rock Mill, where quarries have been opened in the Nine-yard Limestone which crops out here over a large area. Two exposures of the Oxford Limestone have also been worked, one imme diately behind Wisplaw Farm, and the other at the lime-kiln about half a mile to the north-west, where the limestone and underlying coal were formerly burnt for lime. Both these exposures vield numerous fossils, and special interest attaches to the concretionary structures found in this bed, similar to those previously mentioned as occurring in the outcrop of the Oxford Limestone at Golden Hill in Bamburgh parish. Another outcrop of the Nine-yard Limestone occurs to the south of Rennington, while the out lier of limestone on which part of Rock stands, which can be seen cropping out in the village under the school-house, is considered to be the source whence the township derives its name. Coal beds occurring in the Calcareous group have been worked in different parts of the parish. West of Newton several old shafts and surface workings into various seams exist ; for instance, between Embleton and New ton Barns, at Cock Law Mount, Emmington Hill, Rock Moor House, Dry-"], [30, "8 EMBLETON PARISH. thropple, etc.; while larger collieries have been opened in the 'Shilbottle' seam at Christon Bank and the Hocket. This seam was formerly a good deal worked near Little Mill, where it is found about 40 feet below the Six-yard Limestone j1 the seam here, however, is poor, but where it runs out against a fault on the boundary of the parish, the coal is of good quality and was worked until recently. From notes by Mr. T. J. Taylor it would appear that the 'thill ' over this seam should make an excellent fireclay ; according to the following analysis, made by Dr. T. Richardson in 1846, it contains silica, 58*35 ; alumina, 22\"55 ; iron protoxide, 4*37; water, 12*55. Notes bv the Rev. R. W. Bosanquet2 show that a colliery had been worked for many years before 1767, between Rock Hall and Rock Moor House. The same notes also contain a report by William Westgarth on a lead vein or dyke, which is described as 'a vein of tolerable strength running pretty near south-west and north-east, discovered in working the coal upon a bed of stone called in that country the \"thill\" (i.e., a grey, hazel or freestone sill), and is in a place one would not have expected any ore would have been found, being too near the coal. The ore does not yield lead well (affording only ten ounces of lead from sixteen ounces of ore, made perfectly clean and assayed) and scarce any silver at all.' From subsequent documents the vein appears never to have been worked. EMBLETON AND STAMFORD. The village of Embleton is situated in the township of the same name, and lies about half a mile west of the sea. The name is spelt 'Emeldune' in the oldest documents,3 the termination denoting the fact that the village is built upon an eminence which, though slight, is conspicuous from the flatness of the neighbourhood. Most of the cottages are ranged in a row, running north and south along a ridge of whinstone, the quarrying of which pro vides occupation and good wages for a number of workmen.4 From the 1 App. i. \"- Ibid. 3 Reginald!

On the north of the church, in the vicarage grounds, is another old dovecote of red brick, which is both capacious and picturesque.

Two other brothers, John and Ernald, concur in the grant, to which Adam's seal is attached.4 The barony of Embleton eventually formed the inheritance of Odard's younger son, John, to whom Henry I. granted it for the service of three knights' fees, with six bovates in Bamburgh at a rental of seven shillings.6 It 1 The deed of confirmation is assigned by Mr. Round on good grounds to the year 1133.

John, son of Odard, reported to Henry II. in 1168 that, of the three knights' fees originally given to him, he had granted half a fee to William son of Adam, half a fee to Albert, half a fee to Ernulf and Aelard between them, whilst he retained a fee and a half in his own hands.1 He also held three townships which were not part of his barony, namely, Newton-by-the-sea in Embleton parish and Earle in Doddington parish from the lords of the barony of Vesci, and the township of Fenton near Wooler from the lords of the Muschamp barony.2 Reginald of Durham tells a remarkable story of the mother of John. He relates that a noble lady, well-known to all the inhabitants of the region of Embleton, where she dwelt, was afflicted with a grievous malady. He describes her as the mother of a knight to whom the vill belonged by heredi tary right,3 and he vividly depicts the complaint from which she suffered. The zeal of the medical men, who attended the unhappy lady, only served to aggravate the symptoms, and she eventually became almost a complete cripple. At length, however, when all other means had failed, she resolved to go to the Fame Islands to pray upon the spot where St. Cuthbert had died. She approached as near to the church as a woman was allowed to go, and then in answer to her earnest prayers she at once experienced a miraculous relief from her infirmity, and throwing away the stick with the help of which she had landed on the island, she returned to her home in perfect health.4 Reginald relates a similar miraculous cure which was effected in the case of John Viscount himself, who suffered severely from a species of dysentery.6 Not much else can be ascertained about him beyond the fact that he paid fifteen marks as scutage in 1 196, that he might be excused from taking part in \"Emeldon.

Some portions of the barony had been held by tenants in subin feudation since the time of Henry I. Of these tenants William de Rok held a quarter of a knight's fee, William de Craster held Craster as half a fee, Reyner de Dunstan held Dunstan for a quarter of a fee, Thomas de Warenton held Warenton, with the exception of one carucate, for half a fee.4 There were also several socage tenants in the barony,6 amongst whom was Everard Teutonicus, who had married Rametta, daughter of the third John Viscount, and held one hundred shillings' worth of land in Embleton as his wife's mar riage portion.6 The township of Burton, which occurs under the name ' Burnulfestona ' in the memorandum of King Stephen, was part of the ancient endowment of the shrievalty. John Viscount kept this place in his own hands and com muted the tithe due from it to Nostell priory.7 At about the same time he gave various lands in Newton-by-the-sea to Adam Ribaud, stipulating that Adam and his tenants should be amerced in the sum of twelve pence for every transgression, except for doing violence to his lord and lady, for which offence it may be presumed that a more condign punishment was reserved.8 John Viscount, the last male representative of the family, died in the year 1244, when a survey was made ofhis lands.9 Pipe Roll, anno 1196; Hodgson, Northd.

It was eventually agreed, in the year 1245, that Everard and Rametta should give to Patrick for his homage and service the lands in Stamford which Adam Thewe and William the reeve had formerly held. Patrick received as an addition to the estate a portion of land 60 feet in breadth on the west and on the east, corresponding to the length5 of the tofts and crofts ; with the croft which Adam Wyscard held, to which the same addition was to be made.

In return for these concessions he renounced, in favour of Everard and Rametta, all claim to other lands in Stamford.1 Rametta's first husband, Everard Teutonicus, died about the year 1248, and she afterwards paid the sum of a hundred marks that she might be at liberty to marry whomsoever she chose.2 Shortly afterwards she married for her second husband Hereward de Marisco, probably a relative of the bishop of Durham of that name.3 Hereward and Rametta conveyed the barony of Embleton to Simon de Montfort in 1255. Montfort ten years before had been made guardian ofthe lordship of Redesdale and the barony of Prudhoe during the minority of Gilbert de Umfreville. For this appointment he had to pay 10,000 marks, a larger sum than Richard de Cornwall, the king's brother, had offered for the same wardship. From 1248 to 1253 Montfort was abroad in Gascony, but on his return to England he obtained great influence among the Northum brian barons, and it is possible that in the purchase of Embleton he was alive to the strategic value of the rock of Dunstanburgh, so strongly fortified in after days. On April the 2nd, 1255, Richard Morin was sent to Stamford as the representative of the earl of Leicester, and in the presence of Hereward de Marisco and the lady Rametta took possession of the barony of Embleton. At the same time he took formal possession of the manor of Fenton near Wooler, which had belonged to the lady Rametta's father, John Viscount, and had been held by him of the barony of Muschamp.4 The formal transfer took place in the presence of the whole court of Stamford. Richard Morin at the same time appointed William, his clerk, to look after the barony, and informed Rametta that she would be provided with a residence at Harbottle and be allowed to remain there until the earl could provide other lands for her.6 On the following day (April 3rd) Richard Morin went to Fenton, and took over that manor on behalf of the earl in the presence of the whole vill, but, on the 3rd of May, Morin became the pur- 1 Witnesses: Walter, abbot of Alnewyk, William Heyrun, then sheriff\" of Northumberland, Master John Forti, Master Henry (rector of Emeldon church), William de Rok, Ingram de Waranham, Robert de Hibburn', Robert de Ulcestr', Ralf de Musgrave, Richard Frebern', Adam Ribaud, Walter de Prendwyk, Reyner de Dunstan.

Rametta agreed to accept the parish of Chawton in the north of Hampshire, and the large parish of Shapwick, adjoining the river Stour in Dorsetshire, as an equivalent for her northern lands.3 On July Sth, 1256, this exchange was formally ratified in the King's Court at Westminster.4 At the same time Rametta transferred to Simon de Montfort the chief tenants at Embleton, namely, Reyner de Dunstan, John de Craster, Ingelram de Warenton, and William de Roc, with the service due from each respectively, as well as the other free men and villeins of the barony.

She holds a falcon in jesses on the left hand, which is gloved and extended. She presses a smaller bird with the right hand to her breast. Round the seal is the inscription DAME ramette la tyeyze. The seal is reproduced on p. 15. 1 Great Cowcher, fol. 158 b, No. 50; cf. also Rot. Cart. 41 Hen. III. m. 8.

In the event of Rametta dying before her husband Hereward, Chawton and Shapwick were to revert to Montfort, but Hereward was to retain the chief court of Shapwick with twenty pounds' worth of land of reasonable extent.2 In order to make his property more complete the earl of Leicester pur chased some isolated tenements in the neighbourhood from their respective owners. He bought a tenement in Stamford from Patrick Harang and another in Embleton from Robert Walensis.3 On the 13th of December, 1257, the earl of Leicester had a grant of a market every week on Tuesday at the manor of Embleton, and of a fair there yearly to last for five days, beginning on the eve of the feast of St. Matthew the evangelist (September the 20th). He also had license to empark his wood at Shipley within the king's forest in Northumberland.4 1 They were Roger de Chaumpayne, Richard de Haveringes, Walter le Vineter, and Roger de la Dene.

One of his comrades on the battlefield, John de Vesci, contrived in his escape to carry home one of the earl's feet, which had been barbarously hacked off. This relic, encased in a silver shoe, was preserved at AInwick abbey as an object of veneration until the Dissolution. Many cures were attributed to its miraculous properties.1 The barony of Embleton was confiscated at Montfort's death, and was given by Henry III. on the 22nd of April, 1269, to his younger son, Edmund, earl of Lancaster.2 Earl Edmund gave the advowson of the parish church of Embleton to Merton college in 1274, and on December the 4th, 1285, he gave an annual sum of twenty shillings for the maintenance of lights at the tomb of St. Godric, in the church of the priory of Finchale. The money wras to be paid by the bailiff of Embleton, for the time being, from the proceeds of the mills there. The gift was made by the earl on behalf of himself and his consort, Blanche, queen of Navarre.3 The earl claimed that very extensive privileges appertained to his franchise of Embleton, and as the result of a quo warranto enquiry a report was made to the justices, in the year 1292, that the earl claimed the return of all writs, and the right to decide in his court pleas similar to those which were tried before the sheriff. The earl had also a prison at Embleton, and had power through his bailiff to condemn or acquit prisoners for felonies committed within the franchise. He had gallows moreover at Newton, Embleton, Dunstan, and Craster.4 The prison was in frequent use ; for instance, in 1292 Robert Jolef of Russedene was imprisoned for stealing wool, and was handed over to the custody of Thomas de Stokes, the bailiff of Stamford, who kept him 'in the house of Edmund, the king's brother, in the township of Embleton,' for four days. He escaped from the prison to the parish church and afterwards left the realm.6 1 In the survey of Dr. Layton and Dr. Legh at the Public Record Office, under the heading 'AInwick,' is this sentence : 'hie pedem habent Simonis Mounford et ciphum S.

It will be observed in the account that there was a chapel at Stamford, which was served by a priest at a salary of \u00a3_\\ a year, and that a hospital, possibly for lepers, existed in the neighbourhood of Embleton at a place called Spiteldene. The chapel at Stamford seems to have been in existence in the lifetime of John Viscount, Rametta's grandfather, when it was served by a chaplain named Nicholas.4 Nothing is now known of the hospital ; but it is noticeable that the road approaching Embleton from the south, crosses the Embleton burn shortly before entering the village at a spot called Spittleford. There were many leper hospitals in the district, of which one was at Bam- burgh and another at Warenford in the immediate neighbourhood. William Galoun, who is mentioned in the account as bailiff of Stamford, was a man of some wealth and influence. He took a very active part in resisting the just claim of Merton college to the advowson, and jealousy of the college may have been his motive for founding a chantry in 1316 at Bam- 1 In the West Riding of Yorkshire. 2 Donington, seven miles south-east of Derby. 3 Ministers' Accounts, P.R.O. 7-8 Ed.

The Subsidy Roll of that year contains very few names in comparison with the roll of 1296. The name of Thomas Galoun, son of William Galoun the former bailiff, may, however, be noticed.

In 1380 the duke of Lancaster was at the head of a large army upon the Border, in the hope of effecting a lasting peace, and at the close of that year, whilst at Dunstan burgh, he gave verbal instructions for certain alterations and repairs in the castle.3 The new gatehouse was ordered to be built in 1383, at a time when extensive repairs and restorations were in progress at the neighbouring fortress of Bamburgh.4 During the year 1384 also a Scottish army lay encamped in the fields of Embleton, and did so much havoc in the neigh bourhood that the bursar of Merton college could only obtain a very small part ofthe customary tithe. It is not surprising therefore that in 1392 the tenants were unable to pay any rent.5 The people of Embleton were in some degree affected by the revolution of 1399, as the duchy of Lancaster became vested in the Crown on the 1 Duchy of Lancaster Records, class 25, bundle R, No. 12 Johan, etc. A nostre treschere e bien ame bacheler, monsieur Thomas de Ildreton, conestable de nostre chastel de Dunstaneburgh, salus.

But so far from this being the case the tenants in the north seem to have lost rather than gained by the change.

He complained that the demesne lands were unlet to the great decrease of the value of the lordship, and he ordered John Harbottle to let the lands to a tenant for three years at a yearly rent of twenty marks ; if that was impossible the lands were to be let for one year at the highest obtainable rent. The king stated that the tenants had been in the habit of paying twenty-two shillings for every carue or carucate of land, but that they now refused to pay more than sixteen shillings. Harbottle was to endeavour to obtain the old rents, but if he could not do so, he might make an abatement of the odd two shillings from the rent of twenty-two shillings. He was ordered to appear before the chief seneschal of the duchy and the seneschal of the honour of Pontefract at Leicester, on the Sunday before Whitsuntide following, to give them his advice and tell them all that he had done in the matter.1 From a survey made in 1435 it appears that the old rents could not be maintained, and a substantial sum was deducted from the proceeds of the estate on account of the falling off and diminution of rents.

A temporary truce had been arranged, but was broken by many raids and skirmishes from which the men of Embleton suffered seriously. Many of them were taken prisoners and despoiled of their goods. In order to avoid conflagrations they w7ere warned to take the roofs off their dwellings, and to carry awav the timbers of their houses to a place of safety. Henry VI. instructed his auditor, Robert Symond, on the 22nd of May, 1438, to remit the sum of \u00a344 8s. 1 id. to the tenants as partial compensation for their losses.3 When war broke out again in 1449 the houses had once more to be unroofed, and for this reason the tenants were barely able to pay a half of their rents.4 1 ' Forinsecarum.' - Duchy of Lancaster Records, class 25, bundle D, No. 2 i. 3 ' Henricus, etc., dilecto nobis Roberto Symond, auditori nostro, etc., salutem.

In 1440 a tax was imposed nominally on all foreigners, but at Embleton it appears that none except Scots could be found to answer to this definition. For the purpose of the tax they were divided into householders and those who were not house holders, five belonging to the former and twelve to the latter class. Women were not exempt.1 The conflicts of the Wars of the Roses were now rapidly approaching, in which Northumberland was the scene of some of the most critical and violent struggles. During this period Embleton was exposed to the full force of the storm, so that the condition of the people became even worse than before. In the summer of 1462 the horses of ' Henry late king of England ' entirely destroyed the nine acre field in Embleton called Southwellmede, and the rent of iSs. was remitted to the tenant, John Swan.2 The accounts of the receivers and auditors during this period show that a large part of the rents had to be remitted from year to year, although they seem very moderate according to modern ideas. Probably few of the tenants possessed money, which would in itself constitute a source of danger. Those who had a few coins hastened to conceal them preparatory to flight, and being killed or taken prisoners were unable ever to return to recover the hidden treasure. A hoard of coins, probably buried in this way, was not long ago discovered in the churchyard.3 1 The writ for the assessment was directed to the various constables of the townships, who reported as follows : ' Qui dicunt quod hee sunt nomina personarum, per seipsas hospicia tenentes infra libertates pre- dictas non natarum Anglicanarum, unde in breve domini regis fit mentio, exceptis omnibus illis in eodem breve exceptis, videlicet, Willelmus Blanton de Emyldon, Thomas Webster de eadem, Robertus Ronson de Sheplee, Henricus Sproweston de Crawcestr' et Andrea Temple de Wardenham.

The groats were found in three rows on a bed of sand, with their edges upwards, surrounded by three stones, and ranged from the reign of Edward III. to that of Edward IV., the earliest having been minted about 135 1, and the latest about 1464.

Some protection was probably afforded to the people by the bailiffs, who were usually men of substance and influence. In 1478 Gilbert Maners, esquire, was made bailiff of Embleton, and was succeeded by Sir Henry Percy in 1485, wJio delivered up the office some time afterwards to Ralph Carr.1 The Carrs resided at Newlands near Belford, which they held by lease from the duchy of Lancaster. Ralph Carr seems to have allowed his accounts to fall into great confusion, and in 1529 he was unable to hand over a sum of 1 6s. io|d., which had been paid by the tenants of Embleton. Carr offered to use his influence with several merchants in Newcastle to pro cure this money, but could only guarantee payment by instalments of a year. He had handed over 17s. o|d. to Dame Margery Ellerker in an informal manner.2 Bertram Carr, a member of the same family, was involved in a dispute with several people of the district in his capacity as receiver of the lordship of Dunstanburgh. In the year 1535 Robert Johnson, John Arthur, and John Bowden complained, in the name of all the king's tenants of Embleton, that Bertram Carr claimed a certain meadow called Newbiggin, which the tenants had always held in common amongst themselves as apper taining to their farmholds. This meadow, described as the 'greatest com modity' to the whole of Embleton, was claimed by Carr 'for his own singular use,' and the tenants said that 'about Lammas last past he caused to be carried away therefrom four loads of hay, belonging to and made by Robert Johnson and one Thomas Watson and keeps the same.' The tenants further alleged that about 'St. Heleynstide last' Carr took from Watson a 'several garth,' attached to his farmhold, and kept it contrary to the verdict of twelve men ofthe lordship. Also at the time of harvest when John Arthur, John Bow den, and the tenants of Stamford were digging coal at Stamford, in a place which belonged to their farmholds, Carr came upon them with his servants and beat them ' and of certain of them brake the heddes and caused them to avoide.' The following day Carr caused holes to be dug for his own use, and would not allow the tenants to dig, but left the holes unfilled, so that the tenants could not pass wTith their carts and cattle, to their great annoyance. The tenants had great need of the coal, for the timber at Stamford had 1 Duchy of Lancaster Documents, class u, No. 19, Register ofthe duchy temp. Ed.

In a very short time it was said that there would be no timber at all for the maintenance of the farmholds. Bertram Carr also demanded four marks from the tenants for the rent of a certain meadow which had been formerly let according to its value, usually at twenty shillings. If the tenants did not pay four marks Carr ordered them to 'forgoo the fermeholdes, whiche were utterly their undoyng.' ' The tenants who complained of Carr seem not to have been natives, but to have come from the south as tenants of the duchy of Lancaster. At the conclusion of their petition they implored the king ' in tendre pitie and con sideracion, the premisses pituouslv considered ' to provide a remedy that they might be recompensed for their losses. They asked to be restored 'unto their rightes and holdes,' as 'they had commen three hundred myles for the same,' and they asked also that the 'king's peace be taken forthwith upon Carre and his accomplices, of whom, for this complaint, they are more in fear than before,' or else they dared not go home again. In answer to these serious allegations Bertram Carr said that the whole affair was a concoction 'for malice and evill will without any cause,' and that the complaints were inspired by one Thomas Grey, who was deputy constable of Dunstanburgh castle under Sir Arthur Darcy. With regard to the meadow called NewT biggin, Carr said that it was partly common of pasture and the rest arable, and that all the receivers of the lordship, time out of mind, had been allowed to let the meadow as they pleased. Carr, according to custom, discharged Robert Johnson and Thomas Watson, and took two loads of hay off the ground, by virtue of his office. Within fourteen days after, Thomas Grey, by the advice of Johnson and Watson, came to Carr's house with eighteen persons 'in deffensable arraye,' and there assaulted him, and with force and arms took away the hay and restored it to Johnson and Watson. Carr also said that the complaint about the coal was presented at the king's court held at Embleton at midsummer, and it was found that the 1 John Arthur particularly complained of the conduct of the Carrs. He had held a farm for some years by suit of court until about the year 1529. Thomas Carr, Bertram's brother, demanded a fine from him. Arthur paid the fine for fear of expulsion, and three years later the demand was renewed, and the fine again paid. Nevertheless at Easter, in the year 1535, Thomas Carr went into the farm and gave John Arthur warning ' to avoid the occupying of the same.' Arthur complained that if he were expelled he ' would never be able to succour his pore wif and children.' Bertram Carr also daily threatened the tenants with 'great and high words ' so that they were in fear of their lives."], [62, "38 EMBLETON PARISH. tenants had dug and broken the king's ground and taken coal there with out anv authority, for which they were fined, and a penalty set in the court rolls against anyone breaking the king's ground for coal. The tenants broke the order, and Carr, being at Embleton, and seeing this breach of the order, took his horse and 'with a white staff in his hand, as the king's officer there and according to the Act, discharged them of the same occupying, put them off the ground, and took to the king's use the coal they had made bare.' He did not beat them, or dig any holes or pits, or threaten any of the king's tenants.1 The plaintiffs in this case seem to have continued to live at Embleton, as the names of Bowdon, Arthur, and Watson appear on the Muster Roll of able men, capable of bearing arms, in the year 1538.

This manorial court was a most important institution whilst the village lands were held in common, and whilst the behaviour of individuals affected directly the welfare of the community. The king's court met in a building set apart for the purpose, called the Moot Hall, which is mentioned in several ancient documents. The court room seems to have been upon the first floor ofthe building, of which the ground floor was used as a stable. In 1532 the sum of forty-six shillings was spent on the repair of the hall and stable under neath it.1 Again on the 4th of July, 1543, Thomas Burgoyn, William Denton, and Robert Horseley were directed ' to view and survey the state of the Motehall in Emyldon, what decay it is in, the cost of repairing or rebuild ing it, what timber, stone, etc., the king has there towards the repairs, and where such may be had near and best chepe.' Burgoyn reported to Henry VIII. 'as towchyng the Motehall in Emeldon ' as follows: Pleaseth it you to be asserteyned for as myche as ther is old tymber suffycyent at the kynge's castell of Dunstanburghe, wheche dothe dayly consume and in processe of tyme [is] lyke to come to nought, except ther be other remedy founde for the safe garde therof, wheche tymber nowe wold serve to make a flatte rose unto the seyd Motehall, and, that done, to cover the same with leade, wheche remayneth in the seyd castell, wyth more than will serve for that purpose, soo that then it were made for many yeres, and that way least charge unto the kyng in my opynyon. And for the overplus of the leade to knowe further your pleasure what is to be done with all, for it is bribed and stollen away dayly, and wylbe more and more.2 Burgoyn's report is not very clear, but conveys the impression that the Moot Hall was considered worthy of preservation, and that he saw no prospect of restoring Dunstanburgh castle. Many disputes, throwing light on social life, were tried in the Moot Hall. In 155 1 the lordship and mills of Embleton had been let to Edward Bradford, who addressed a petition in 1554 to Sir Robert Rochester, the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster. Bradford complained that the tenants ought to grind their corn at his mills and pay him multure, but Henry Arthur, one ofthe tenants, ground his corn at mills 'without the lordship contrary to the liberties thereof,' and refused to do suit for the mills of Embleton, 'to the plaintiff's damage and the evil example of all the neighbours.'

Bradford complained further that though the king and queen had the sole right to hunt ' in the lordship so that no man shall hunt or hawk there without license of their officers, the said Henry Arthure and his company dailv hunt and destroy the game there, and will not abyde eny order of the kinge and quenes majesties courte, holden there for reformacion of the same.' A writ was issued restraining Henry Arthur from pursuing this course of conduct.1 Edward Bradford had another dispute about a very ancient customary due levied on the lordship. It was called 'Canefisshe' or ' Gaynfish,'2 by virtue of which one quarter of a fisherman's catch was appropriated by the bailiff on the return of the fisherman to shore.\" The custom was included in a lease of the lordship to Bradford who paid 13s. 4d. for this ancient due. The tenants brought a test case before the court of the duchy of Lancaster in 1557 about this custom, and Edward VI. issued a writ stating that 'whereas greate contencion, stryffe, and varyance hathe beyn betwene the saide Edward and the kinge and quene's tenantes of there saide lordship, concerninge the saide canefyshe, for that the saide Edwarde hathe taken of our tenauntes by colour of the same canefyshe the best fyshe that eny fyssherman there takethe, and albehit he take but one good fyshe by his great labour and travell to wardes his costes and charges, lyenge longe on the sea for yt, yett the saide Edwarde usethe to take that fyshe from them, and so they many tymes lease [i.e., lose] their hole labour and travell.

It was therefore ordered by the chan cellor and council of the duchy that for the remaining years of Bradford's lease, the tenants should ' peaceablie and quyetlie, occupie and enjoye the 1 Duchy of Lancaster Pleadings, vol. xxxiii.

A report of the expenses incurred upon this work is dated the ist of March, 1586. The reasons which led Ralph Grey to undertake the work show the very disturbed state of the district in the later years of the reign of Queen Elizabeth.

The raids were so fre quent that a sleuth hound was habitually kept by the bailiff for the purpose of tracking the cattle-stealers and marauders. The manor court issued an order on the 30th of October, 1598, in the following terms: 'It ys ordered that all tenantes and inhabitantes in Stamford, Emelton, and all other places within this mannour or lordshipp, as well horse as foote, shall all rvse to fray and following, and gyve theire attendance of the bailiffe or other officer to be redye to go with the dogg all together, upon paine of 6s. 8d. everv horseman four everye defalte in not riseing as aforesaid.'2 The Embleton estate remained a part of the duchy of Lancaster until the year 1604, when it was sold by James I., through Sir Thomas Windebank, to Sir Ralph Grey of Chillingham for the sum of 14s. The manors of Embleton, Stamford, Dunstan, with the castle of Dunstanburgh, were included in the deed of sale.3 The earlier rolls of the manor court are preserved among the duchy of Lancaster documents,4 but from 1531 onwards the rolls are in the possession of Lord Tankerville. From these the following extracts are given : On the roll of May 15th, 1522, the following free tenants are mentioned, viz. : Sir Edward Radcliff, Sir Thomas Ilderton, Edward Gray, William Heron, Robert Orde, Edmund Craster, Ralph Swinhoe, Sir John Mordant, Thomas Forster, John Carr, Thomas Hebburn, Henry Wetwang, Cuthbert Hoppen, and John Harbottle. \u2022 Duchy of Lancaster Surveys, 28 Eliz. bundle 48. 2 Manor Rolls of Stamford in the possession of Lord I ankervdle. \u2022 Deed of sale in the possession of Lord Tankerville. 4 Court Rolls, Duchy of Lancaster, bundle 107, No. 1540, etc."], [67, "EMBLETON AND STAMFORD. 43 On the 6th of October, 1531, a fine was specially ordered to be levied on persons breaking the order of the watch, and neglecting to preserve in good order the ditch, which had been made to protect the village from attack.1 The freeholders in Embleton and Stamford in the year 1 598 were Thomas Cryston, the heirs of John Harbottle, the heirs of William Lawson, and the heirs of George Lawson.2 In the same year the follow ing presentments were made by the sworn men of Embleton : Robt.

The later court rolls are of a purely formal character, but the court itself exists at the present day and its records (still carefully kept) are a survival of a once useful jurisdiction. Towards the close of the seventeenth century there were six proprietors in Embleton, as appears from the following table : 1 A boll of wheat is two bushels at AInwick. A boll of barley or oats at AInwick was six bushels.

According to this deed, Lord Tankerville held i6| farms2 and eight cottages or coat lands, which were enjoyed by eight cottars, each of whom had grazing for a horse and cow on the moor. The remainder was assessed as follows: Richard Witton 2 farms; George Darling ill farms; Ralph Christon iii farms; Robert Christon I farm ; Joan Darling 1 farm ; John and Thomas Wood I farm ; the vicar 3 farms ; and a charity school i farm. The total number of farms amounted to 27I. The 'farms' made up the 'in grounds' belonging to the freeholders. These ingrounds lay ' promiscuous and undivided,' and were held in common, with the exception of the East Field which was held by the vicar, Dr. Tovey, in severalty. Dr. Tovey was a party to the division on the understanding that the East Field, which he already held, should be a part of the land allotted to him in respect of his three farms, and that the commissioners for the award should only determine the amount of land adjoining the East Field, which ought to be allotted in respect ofthe vicarage lands called Stonycoats and Pricklawflatt. Dr. Tovey was awarded, in respect of the vicarage lands, 20 acres 2 roods 10 perches in Embleton Town field, with 5 acres for the charity school. The remainder of the ' infield grounds ' and of the moor was divided into three equal parts, viz., the west part containing 532 acres, the middle part containing 601 acres, and the east part containing 533 acres. Lord Tankerville received the west and east parts, and the middle part was assigned to Witton, the Darlings, the Christons, and the Woods. The general result was that Lord 1 Hodgson, Northd. III. i. pp. 248-249. 2 The meaning ofthe word 'farm' has been investigated by Mr. F. W. Dendy in Arch. Ael. vol. xvi. i. No. ix. p. 121 (New Series), 1893, and by the Rev. Canon Creighton (bishop of Peterborough) in an appendix to the Arch\u00e6ological Journal, vol. xlii. 1884. Mr. Dendy is of opinion that the word 'farm' in Northumberland and North Durham meant 'the full number of strips in the open arable fields which belonged to each customary homestead in the village, with the meadow and common rights also appurten- ant to it,' and that the word is equivalent to what is elsewhere called yardland, living, wista, full land, husband land, or whole tenement."], [70, "46 EMBLETON PARISH. Tankerville received an average of 64 acres for each of his 16^ farms, the vicar received 56 acres for each of his 3 farms, and the other freeholders 76 acres for each of their 8 farms.1 The 'coatlands' mentioned in the award of the commissioners appear to have been set apart from the rest of the common lands before the partition of 1730. At the court held on the 25th of November, 171 5, it was ordered ' that on some day before Candlemas next . . . Baron, widdow, tennent and farmer of Stamford, shall bring all the ancient witnesses she can procure before Thomas Taylor, of Dunstan Town, and Henry Darling, of Embleton, to give an account of the boundaries of the coate lands of Stamford, and after the said Thomas Taylor and Henry Darling have fully heard all the evidences that shall be brought concerning the same, they shall settle and ascertaine the boundary of the said coate lands by fixing or placing of stones, that the boundary be the better distinguished from the other lands of Stamford. And what the said Thomas Taylor and Henry Darling shall doe herein shall be reported by them at the next court in order to be inserted in the rolls of the court.' If the report was ever made it has been lost, as there is no defini tion of the coatlands in the court rolls. After the enclosure, which followed the partition, the townships of Embleton and Stamford assumed their modern aspect. The old village economy was the product of the common tenure of land ; when this common tenure was abolished the social life of the place underwent the revolution which has obliterated almost all traces of the older system.2 1 The deed is printed at length in app. iv. to the Rev. Canon Creighton's article in the Arch\u00e6ological Journal, vol. xlii. From a conveyance dated 29th September, 1738, it appears that the land held in com- mon by the smaller proprietors was enclosed immediately after the partition, and portions were assigned to each in severalty. 2 The court rolls contain several cases relating to the manufacture of cloth at Embleton. This cottage industry survived for a long time, and in connection with it the following documents are of interest : 'At a numerous meeting of the weavers of AInwick and places adjacent, they agreed to the following regulations for preparing and weaving yarn into cloth, viz. : yarn at 12 cuts in the pound and under at 3d per yard, yard wide ; from 12 to 16 [cuts] at 3IA. ; from 16 to 20 at 4d. ; from 20 to 24 at 4*d., etc \u2022 and so on in proportion for what is over a yard wide.

In the Newcastle Journal of the 23rd of January, 1779, the following announce- ment was made: Whereas an advertisement appeared in the Newcastle Journal, etc , setting forth an agreement among the weavers of AInwick of the prices of weaving linen cloth, the majority of the inhabitants of the parish of Embleton think it their duty to oppose such a plan, and have therefore subscribed an agreement not to employ any of the weavers who demand the new prices, but to employ such on y as are willing to weave at the prices they have formerly done, and they do hereby invite and exhort all the inhabitants of this part of the county to oppose a scheme so hurtful to their interest, so pre- judicial to the poor who manufacture for their own use, and so subversive of the spirit of industry throughout the county.

The whole of Embleton and Stamford is now the property of the trustees of Mr. Eyres, with the exception of the farm of Christon Bank called after the old copvholders of that name, and a small farm called Claysteads, which belong to Sir Edward Grey.

There is no evidence that there was a church at Embleton in pr\u00e6- Conquest times ; but the earliest portions of the existing fabric may reason ably be attributed to the time of John Viscount, who received the barony of Embleton from Henry I.1 The first rector of whom any record is preserved is a certain Adam, who lived at the end of the twelfth century.

It is recorded in the Liber Vit\u00e6, which contains the names of benefactors to the church of St. Cuthbert from the earliest times, that John, the parson of Embleton, promised to give a bezant annually on St. Cuthbert's day.2 In 1227 John wras involved in a quarrel with the prior and convent of Durham about the payment of tithes, which eventually came under the notice of Pope Honorius III. It is not clear, however, what were the precise points in dispute.3 John appears to have died before the year 1245, when Henry Gategang was rector.4 Gategang belonged to a Gateshead family, and is mentioned amongst those persons who contributed in the year 1251 to the fabric of Tyne bridge.5 The records bearing upon the history of the living are very scanty, until after the barony of Embleton had passed from the hands of Simon de Mont fort to the earls of Lancaster, when, on Feburary 24th, 1274, Edmund, earl of Lancaster, son of Henry III. and brother of Edward I., gave the advowson of Embleton church and of Rock chapel to Merton college, Oxford, for the support of the scholars and the increase of their number.6 1 This is one of the few early deeds of the Viscount family which are still extant.

Before the grant of the church to Merton, Earl Edmund had presented the living to Lewis de Salveya, who retained possession until 1279, and then resigned. Thereupon the earl, overlooking the grant which he had made to the college, presented Adam de Fileby, and he was instituted by the bishop of Durham. Immediately afterwards the warden of Merton presented his candidate, who by a curious coincidence of the same family name was called Robert de Fileby.1 The bishop of Durham, Robert de Insula, was thereupon led to enquire into the matter, and was satisfied that the advowson belonged to Merton.2 Accordingly Adam de Fileby, by deed dated February 10th, 1279, resigned in favour ofhis namesake Robert, and Earl Edmund, by a special charter, cancelled his illegal presentation.3 Robert de Filebv was instituted in 1280, and retained possession ofthe church till November 20th, 1287, when he resigned, because, according to his own account, he could not habendam et tenendam dictis scolaribus et fratribus bene et in pace, in libera et pura elemosina, cum omnibus ad dictam aduocationem spectantibus sive in capellis, redditibus, seu quibuscutnque libertatibus et rebus aliis in perpetuum.

The rectory was declared to be worth fifty-one marks a year (^34) according to the 'taxation of Norwich ; '4 but the jurors stated that it had greatly increased in value since this taxation was made.5 They at the same time described William de Hamelton in flattering terms as a man of prudence and discretion, adding that he was fit for the church of Embleton or even a ' fatter one.'6 At the time of his appointment to Embleton William de Hamelton was archdeacon of York. He was made dean of York in 1298, and in the year 1304 he attained to the high office of king's chancellor. He died on Wed nesday, April 14th, 1307, and wTas buried in the south transept of York Minster.7 In order to understand the disputes about the advowson of Embleton, which ensued on Hamelton's death, it should be remembered that Edmund, ' ' Quia cure, que michi [pertinet] in ecclesia de Emeldon, quam possideo, sufficere nequeo, sicut expediret' Ibid.

Earl Thomas claimed that the advowson still appertained to the manor or lordship of Embleton, as forming part of the forfeited estate of Simon de Montfort. He contended that the advowson had been entailed upon him by the grant of the barony by Henry III. to Earl Edmund, his father, and had not been alienated.1 Acting upon this supposition, immediately after the vacancy caused by the death of William de Hamelton, Earl Thomas presented the living on May ioth, 1307, to Master Peter de Dene.2 Merton college in this way became involved in a prolonged and arduous struggle with the most powerful man in the kingdom, and the story of this struggle constitutes for the next few years the history of the living. It was not to be expected that the college would acquiesce in this pre sentation, and Master Peter de L'isle was therefore sent to Northumberland as proctor for the college, and was present at Rothbury when the enquiry into the circumstances of the vacancy took place. The enquiry was held before a jury of Northumbrian parish clergy on May 31st, 1307. The clergy appear to have been so overawed by the influence of Earl Thomas and his bailiff, Thomas Galoun, that they professed entire ignorance of the fact that Merton college had presented the two last incumbents. They, therefore, contented themselves with reciting the preposterous claim of Earl Thomas, notifying the opposition of the proctor, Peter de L'isle, and reporting that Peter de Dene was very suitable for the place as a man of literary attainments. As a result of their verdict Peter de Dene was admitted to the living.3 A very interesting account of this enquiry at Rothbury, and the circum stances attending it, is contained in a confidential letter, written by the proctor, Peter de L'isle, to the warden pf Merton, John de Wanting.

Peter de L'isle says : ' Know, dear sir, that the enquiry about master Peres de Dene is taken, and that we were there, viz. : master Richard de Eryum,1 a notary, and Sir John de Pykerynge,2 Peres de Elaund and myself. Before the enquiry we said what we had to say on our part to inform the good people.' Richard de Eryum then made some formal protests, and the proctor continues: 'After that I went to York to speak to Sir Stephen de Maulay/ and I spoke to him in the presence of master Robert de Ripplyngham,' and he showed me the inquisition, and told me that he had given the transcript to master William de Walcotes, otherwise I should have sent the transcript to you. And Sir Stephen told me that he [? Peter de Dene] will not be instituted yet, because the inquisition says the church is in dispute, but on the other hand I cannot get inhibition yet because master Peres [de Dene] is a great man, as he is chancellor to the archbishop. And you must know that such an inquisition is of no force because there is no pardon in it.5 And those who were there did not dare to speak the truth because of the earl's bailiff. Never theless we got the people of the country on our side beforehand, as much as we could. And know that we have a great want, because we have not got the transcripts of our charters. And this being so, they fear much that we want to take the thing by force (approprier la chose). And the people of the country say that we want to do at Embleton even as we did at Ponteland, and know that we are much blamed about Ponteland.\" And the advice of our friends is that you should come as soon as possible to visit your parishioners and speak with the good people of the country, and that you should hasten to the earl and show him all that we had on our side, for I think that you will find more favour with him than with his bailiffs.

At the same time John de Pykeringe, vicar of Ponteland, wrote to the warden to sav that William Galoun, the bailiff of the earl of Lancaster, and others of his party, would not allowT him to enter the church, saying that he had no right there, because the living was entailed upon the earl and his descendants. The people of the country, on the other hand, declared that there was no entail, and that Earl Edmund had given away lands belonging to the barony of Embleton to Sir Lawrence de St. Maur, namely, the town ships of Newton-by-the-sea and Burton. Sir Lawrence de St. Maur having died in 1295, these lands had descended to his son, and it was evident that such a gift was incompatible with the theory of a strict entail.1 These letters show clearly the position in which the college was placed. The living belonged to Merton, but the warden did not dare to present, through fear of the earl's bailiff rather than of the earl. Peter de Dene, the new rector, or as he should rather be called 'the intruder,' was a very remarkable man, of whom little is generally known. A few particulars of his career will therefore be of interest. He was born about 1260, and appears to have been associated in early life with the monastery of St. Augustine, Canterbury. His rise in the church was rapid ; he was made a doctor of laws, and became a canon of York, London, Wells, Southwell, and Wimborne Minster. He was summoned as a clerical proctor to the Parliament of 1295, an<^ in 1297 became one of the council of Prince Edward. In the year 1300 he was granted a special pension of a year from the monastery of St. Augustine, Canterbury, in return for which he promised to generally supervise the business of the monastery when any special points were submitted to him. In 1306 he was summoned to the Parliament held at Carlisle preparatory to Edward I.'s intended expedition into Scotland. In 1307 he was presented by Earl Thomas to Embleton, as has been already stated, and in the same year he was appointed domestic chaplain and chancellor to the archbishop of York. On the 4th of August, 'A son chere amy et mestre Johan de Wentenge, gardayn de la sale de Merton, Johan de Pykeringe vicar de Pont Eylaund salut . . .

In the following year he was allowed to let his living of Elmley and to be non-resident for three years. He was now at the height of his prosperity, and the accumulation of offices in his possession exposed him to the jealousy of his rivals. On the 19th of October, 131 1, a commission was appointed to enquire how it was that he held the two livings of Elmley and Embleton,1 but the friendship of Earl Thomas probably sufficed to repel these attacks. He was therefore careful to show a proper gratitude to his patron, and in 13 14 we find him making a present of two cart horses to Earl Thomas to assist in building the earl's fortress at Dunstanburgh.2 It is evident that he was closely associated with York as canon of the cathedral church, chaplain and chancellor to the archbishop, and a fine window in the minster at York remains to the present day as a memorial of Peter de Dene's munificence. On a panel in an heraldic window in the north aisle of the nave there is represented the kneeling figure of an ecclesiastic. He is represented with tonsured head, and is habited in a blue cope and hood, almuce (the white fur of which is seen about the neck), white surplice, purple cassock, and purple shoes. The identitv of the figure so represented is shown by the inscription : $vk$ : pur : maistre : : tie : 3Dcnc : fee : ecste : fenc0trc : ftst : ferc :3 Peter de Dene resigned the living of Embleton before 1321,4 and after the execution of Earl Thomas in 1322 he suffered a reverse of fortune. He was exposed to so rigorous a persecution that he retired to the monastery of St. Augustine, Canterbury, to which he had been a great benefactor. The chronicler of St. Augustine's gives a vivid picture of the closing scenes of Peter de Dene's life.5 His position appears to have been such that he was able to make terms with the abbot and convent on his admission, but he did not take the usual vows or give up all his property. For several years he gave counsel to the abbot, taught canon law to the monks, conducted their most private and difficult affairs, and was allowed a reasonable time to walk about both within and without the walls of the monastery. At length, grow- 1 Register, Greenfield, York. 2 See history of Dunstanburgh castle. 3 An account of the window has been written.

He men tioned this again and again to the abbot and convent ; but they deferred the consideration of the matter, and would not consent to his departure. They were probably the more unwilling to offend him, or that he should leave them, because it was known that he had bequeathed to them several valuable books on canon law, and the greater part of his money and plate. Frustrated in his endeavours to obtain permission to depart, he meditated means of escape. He concerted a plan with two brothers, John de Bourne, rector of St. Martin's, Canterburv, and George de Bourne, who possessed a house at Bishopsbourne, about four miles from Canterbury. He paid them for their assistance, and on the day of St. Lucia (December 13th), 1330, John, the rector of St. Martin's, came by invitation to dine with the infirmarer of the abbey ; and during dinner he rose from table, and pretending some business, went to the chamber of Peter de Dene, and had a long conversation with him. In the evening at supper Peter mentioned to his attendant that he had celebrated Mass, but should not do so on the morrow ; and he therefore desired that he might not be disturbed in his morning's sleep. His servant retired to rest in another chamber, leaving a boy with his master, and the door un locked. Before midnight, having thrown off his monk's habit, he withdrew, accompanied by the boy. They took with them six silver dishes and six saucers ; and passing through his own cellar to a gate which led to the garden of the cellarer, the lock of which they had broken, thev found their way to the abbey wall. There they made a preconcerted signal to notify their arrival by throwing over a stone ; and the rector and his brother and two other persons, who had brought three horses to the spot, came and placed two ladders against the wall. Peter, having got over the wall, was placed on horse back, and conveyed to the house of George de Bourne. On his flight being discovered there was a great commotion in the monastery, and enquiries were made in all directions for the fugitive. At length it became known that he was concealed at Bishopsbourne. The house was watched all night, and on searching it next day he was found carefully rolled up in a bundle of canvas. He was brought back to St. Augustine's and confined in the infirmary. The chronicler proceeds to relate in detail how he was treated, and the conse quences of this flagrant breach of discipline. Peter de Dene contended that his qualified vows did not oblige him to remain in the monastery, and he"], [83, "J.WKfjOWLES. Bil. /+ FUtL SI3E. PETER DE DENE, RECTOR OF EMBLETON, FROM A WINDOW IN YORK MINSTER."], [84, ""], [85, "EMBLETON CHURCH. 57 appealed to the Pope. A bull in his favour was in due time produced, the genuineness of which was questioned by the abbot and convent. The result is not clearly stated, but it would seem that he eventually submitted to the abbot, and probably died in the monastery. Whilst Peter de Dene was in occupation of the living, legal proceedings had been progressing with regard to the advowson. In 1316 Earl Thomas requested Richard de Kellawe, bishop of Durham, to make search among the records at Durham, in order to ascertain whether Robert de Fileby had ever been presented by Peter de Abingdon, warden of Merton. If the records preserved at Merton college are to be believed, there can be no doubt that Robert de Fileby was instituted after the resignation of Adam de Fileby, as has been already stated. Bishop Richard however alleged that in answer to the earl's request he had searched all his predecessor's records, but could find no trace of Robert de Fileby's presentation.1 Strengthened by this singular fact Earl Thomas procured the admission of his clerk, Gilbert de Halughton, to the living.2 In this way Merton college was forced to bring an action in the Common Pleas for the recovery of the advowson. The action terminated in favour of the college, and in 1327 Edward III. issued a writ to the bishop of Durham, ordering him to admit to the living on the presentation of the warden of Merton.3 But this writ was only issued pending a claim of the king himself, because in the process of the action it had been discovered that the college had originally accepted the living from Earl Edmund without the royal license.4 It was in vain that the warden and scholars pleaded that the gift had been made long before the statute of mortmain.

After Gilbert de Halughton had ceased to be rector, Thomas de Bam burgh was presented by Edward III. The precise date of the presentation is not known, but it may be assigned with certainty to the year 1328, when the living was in the king's hands. The original name of Thomas de Bamburgh was Thomas Dughan. He was one ofthe clerks or masters in chancery from 1327 to 1341, and was also the owner of large property in Northumberland, especially in the vicinity of Bamburgh, where he founded a chantry.3 He acted as keeper of the Great Seal on several occasions, for instance, during the chancellorship of John de Stratford from April ist to June 23rd, 1332, and from January 13th to February 17th, 1334; also during the chancellorship of Richard de Bury, bishop of Durham, from July 6th to July 19th, 1336, and on the death of that prelate from December 8th, 1339, to February 16th, 1340, when he was made one of the receivers of petitions to Parliament.4 Whilst Thomas de Bamburgh was rector the authorities of Merton college obtained papal confirmation of their right to the next and succeeding presentations. Edward III. himself wrote to Pope John XXII. on behalf of the college in 1330, as did also the university of Oxford.5 The archbishop of 1 The principle of the statute ' De viris religiosis' was anticipated in 1258 by the ioth clause of the petition ofthe barons at Oxford (Stubbs, Select Charters, p. 383), and again in 1259 by the 14th clause of the Provisions of Westminster.

The endowment of the vicarage was to consist of forty acres of arable land in Embleton, Rennington, and Rock respectively ; and the vicar was to provide three chaplains and a deacon, i.e., a chaplain and deacon for the church of Embleton itself, and a chaplain for each of the chapels of Rock and Rennington, at his own expense. The college undertook to provide houses for the vicar in which he might live suitably, and entertain visitors decently, and to build the chancel as often as was necessary, and to repair dilapidations. A suitable amount of glebe was appropriated to the vicar, who was directed to pay a mark a year to the bishop of Durham as an acknowledgment.3 During the incumbency of Thomas de Bamburgh, a wealthy merchant of Newcastle, Richard de Emeldon, endowed a chaplain with some land in Ellingham, to pray for Richard de Emeldon, Sampson le Cotiller and his wife Agnes, at the altar of St. Katherine in Embleton church.4 About eight years after the living was converted into a vicarage, a vacancy was created by the death of Thomas de Bamburgh, the last rector in possession, who died on April 15th, 1340.5 It might have been supposed after the king's petition and the ordinances ofthe Pope and bishop of Durham, ' The letter is dated 14 Dec., 1330.

He was a prominent merchant of Newcastle, of which he was several times mayor (see Welford, History of Newcastle, vol 1. passim), and is frequently mentioned in the Close Rolls of the early fourteenth century. He was largely engaged in foreign trade and some episodes connected with his commerce are highly curious, as related in the Rolls. He died in 1333, leaving a widow, Christina, who married secondly William de Plumptoucher (Inq. p.m. 7 Ed. III. 48). He left four daughters: (1) Agnes, who married Peter Graper, and had issue; (2) Maud, who married ist Alexander de Hilton and 2nd Richard de Aton, whose grand-daughter Christina married Bertram Monboucher (Inq. p.m. 5 Hen.

It was not so, however, and the death of Thomas de Bamburgh was made the occasion for a final effort to wrest the living from the college. During the incumbency of Thomas de Bamburgh, Henry of Lancaster, created earl of Derby, had succeeded to the barony of Embleton, and he presented one of his clerks, John de Bredon, to the church, immediately after the vacancy occurred. The reasons for the earl's action are set forth in a lengthy argument, which, though highly ingenious, is inconsistent with the facts. He contended that the manor of Embleton, carrying with it the right of advowson, had been settled on his ancestor and limited to heirs male. To give his case a better aspect and to conceal the fact that Merton college was actually in possession of the living, he related the following story, namely, that Gilbert de Halughton, his father's nominee, after several years' incumbency, had resigned upon an exchange of benefices with Thomas de Bamburgh, and that the latter was presented by the king as temporarily lord of Embleton by way of escheat, the manor at that time being in the king's hands by virtue of the attainder and death of Earl Thomas in 1322. It has, however, been observed that Gilbert de Halughton was rector in 1326, when Earl Henry suffered judgment to be given against himself in favour of the college. This fact alone is conclusive against the earl's argument ; but it may also be said that the presentation of Thomas de Bamburgh could not have taken place until the extreme end of the reign of Edward II. when the attainder of Earl Thomas had already been partially reversed. There can be no real doubt that Thomas de Bamburgh was presented by Edward III. in 1328, when the attainder had been wholly reversed, and therefore the king presented, not as lord of Embleton by way of escheat, but in virtue of the special reservation of one presentation to the Crown on the conclusion of the action brought by the college in the court of Common Pleas.1 In the meantime the warden of Merton, doubtless anticipating difficul ties, had sent John de Hotham as proctor to Embleton. The proctor appeared at Embleton with remarkable promptitude on April 24th, 1340, for Thomas de Bamburgh had only died on April the 15th. John de Hotham proceeded to read his appointment as proctor in the church porch, and also the deed of 1 The earl's argument is given in a long document called ' Articuli et positiones Roberti de Walkyngton,' and the case for the college in a ' Libellus contra presentacionem ad ecclesiam de Emeldon.'

He said that he desired to take possession ofthe church in the name ofthe warden and scholars, and he therefore took the ring of the church door in his hand, saying frequently in a loud voice, ' Here I take corporal possession of this church of Embleton.' A crowd of bystanders witnessed this ceremony, and among them was a notary sitting on the ground. Thereupon a number of people came up, armed with swords and staves, bucklers, and other weapons, and at their head was the earl's bailiff, Thomas Galoun. The bailiff unceremoniously told the proctor and his companions to take themselves at once out of the parish, for he would not allow them to stay another night in Embleton, far less have possession of the church. The proctor wasted few words, but speedily betook himself elsewhere, 'in great anguish of body and fear of death.'1 Profiting by the advice which they had received on the former occasion, the college authorities lost no time in presenting their own candidate in opposition to John de Bredon, and William de Humberstan was appointed to the vicarage. William de Humberstan thereupon applied to the bishop of Durham for admission to the living, but his request was not complied with. He then appealed to the archbishop's court at York, and on the 15th of June, 1340, the bishop of Durham appointed William de Mont gate to be his representative when the appeal came on for hearing.2 In the meantime the outrageous conduct of the earl's partizans was brought to the bishop's notice, and a decree was promulgated against John de Bredon's influential friends in the district, whose threats rendered it unsafe for 1 'Quo quidem processu per dictum procuratorem puplice perlecto, idem procurator, asserens et protes- tans se veile nomine custodis et scolarium predictorum possessionem dicte ecclesie adhipisci, etc., apprehendit annulum hostii eiusdem ecclesie in manu sua, dicens alta voce et pluries, \"Hie apprehendo, etc., possessionem corporalem istius ecclesie de Emeldon,\" etc. Qua quidem prouocatione perlecta, idem procurator inuoeavit testimonium omnium circumstancium ac mei notarii publici infrascripti ibidem sedentis, super omnibus actibus prenotatis, cum protestacione predicta ; supervenerunt quidam cum gladns et fustibus, buculariis et armis, et incontinenti postmodum venit quidam Thomas dietus Galoun, et plures alii cum ipso, qui precepit eidem procuratori et soeiis suis ibidem cum ipso existentibus, quod ab dio loco festinanter et cum celeritate recederent extra parochiam illam et fines eiusdem, quia infra parochiam de Emeldon non sineret ipsos pernoctari ulterius nee morari ; unde metu mortis et cruciatu corporis sibi et suis soeiis, qui cum ipso venerunt, inferendorum, idem procurator cum sua comitiva recessit compulsus.

On May 1 3th, 1 34 1 , the representative of the college, William de Lynham, met Robert de Walkyngton in the church of the Carmelite Friars in London, and there showed him the notice and offered him a copy of it. But Robert de Walk yngton had neglected one summons and was not anxious to receive another ; so one of his supporters snatched the copy and also the original letter out of William de Lynham's hands and threw them away, making at the same time a stern face at the proctor and threatening him with corporal punishment if he met him outside the church. It appears that the seal attached to the document had aroused Walkyngton's suspicions, either feigned or real, for he declared it to be of a somewhat peculiar shape. It is described as being oblong, made of hard white wax on the outside and soft red wax on the inside, that is to say, the real substance of the seal was protected by an outer covering of white wax with a projecting rim, a very common arrange ment.5 The description of the device exactly agrees with that on a seal attached to another document of John Capice.6 1 ' Quia ad ecclesiam de Emeldon propter comminaciones et potenciam quorundam ibidem in partibus existencium, qui parti dicti Johannis fovere nituntur, tutus non patet accessus.'

Towards the close ofthe year 1341 the earl definitely renounced all claim to the church and compelled Robert de Walkyngton to resign.1 The act of resignation was completed in the evening of November 9th, 1341, in the great chamber in the deanery in the Cathedral Close at York, in the presence of a great multitude of clergy and laity.2 It only remained, therefore, for the college proctor to take formal possession of the church, a ceremony which again fell to the lot of the same John de Hotham who had met with such cruel indignities on a similar errand shortly before. On November 14th, 1 34 1, he proclaimed his errand in Embleton churchyard, and then in the presence of the warden of Merton he again took the ring of the church door in his hand and took possession. He then entered the church, rang the bells, and took a vestment lying on the high altar in his hands as a sign of possession. A large crowd both of men and women was present, as on the previous occasion, including Theobald de Baryngton, constable of Dun stanburgh castle. The proctor also entered and took formal possession of the vicarage house.3 On the same day William de Humberstan was formally instituted in the vicarage on behalf of the college.4 It would appear that Merton college paid to the earl of Lancaster for his renunciation of the advowson, as there is preserved amongst the college muniments a receipt dated February 21st, 1341, for one hundred 1 Ibid. 437. 2 ' Nono die mensis Novembris, in crepusculo noctis ejusdem diei, in camera manerii domini decani Eboracensis infra clausum cathedralis.' 3 ' Quibus procuratorione et processu sic perlectis, ac per clericos et layicos in multitudine copiosa ascultatis, idem procurator asserens et protestans se veile nomine custodis et scolarium predictorum possessionem dicte ecclesie de Emeldon adipisci, continuare et defendere, si et quatinus de jure potuit et non aliter, in presencia venerabilis viri magistri de Trong, custodis domus supradicte, ac nomine et man- date ejusdem custodis, cepit anulumostii ecclesie ejusdem in manu suadicens: \"Ego Johannes de Hotham, clericus Eboracensis diocesis, procurator custodis, etc., de Merton, hie apprehendo, accipio et admitto possessionem corporalem istius ecclesie de Emeldon nomine dictorum dominorum meorum, si et quatinus de jure mihi licet, virtute processus supradicti ; ac statim postea dietus procurator prefatam ecclesiam de Emeldon introivit et campanas ejusdem ecclesie pulsavit, et unum vestimentum jacens super magnum altare ipsius ecclesie in manibus suis accepit, animo, ut asserunt, apprehendendi, retinendi et defendendi nomine custodis corporalem possessionem ejusdem ecclesie cum suis juribus, etc., si et quatinus sibi licuit, virtute processus prelibati.

Farneylawe was admitted to the prebend of Bole in 1375, and by his will, dated in the year 1378, left two books to Embleton church.3 In this way the next presentation to Embleton fell into the Pope's hands, for according to custom the Pope had the right of collation to benefices rendered vacant by his promotion of the last incumbent. Pope Gregory XI. therefore presented Richard de Ireland to the vicarage in 1 37 1 .4 In the meantime, however, the warden of Merton, either overlooking or denying the papal right of presentation, had procured the institution of John Geffrei de Bloxham, M.A., on the 29th of October, 1369.5 Bloxham was unable to maintain his position, and the college sent a proctor to the north to effect a compromise with the papal nominee.6 The proctor and Richard de Ireland met on October 9th, 1372, in the churchyard of Gateshead. The proctor held in his hand a document, and refused to allow Richard possession of the living till he had assented to the clauses therein contained. Among other things, it was stipulated that the vicar should be faithful to the warden and scholars, and that he would not allow any harm to be done to the college, but would at least give warning to the warden.7 After other similar clauses had been read Richard de Ireland placed his hand upon his breast and promised obedience in every particular.8 A very short time afterwards, however, the nominee of the papacy proved faithless. He not only appropriated the great tithes, but in addition he set up a claim to them, and in 1383 the warden of Merton was forced to proceed 1 Kilners MS.

A letter of Robert Neville, bishop of Durham, shows that the living either of Embleton or Ponteland had been sequestrated in 1449. The letter is as follows : ' Right trusty and welbiloued we gret you wei, and charge you that in case ye haue sequestred any liuelod ethre in Northumberland or in the busshoprick, belonging .... to Marton college at Oxford, ye doo now therefro ammoue your handes, & hem deliuer to pe berar of thies, a felow of pe said college, as semblable we haue to our shirefe if he haue escheted pe said liuelod.

Endorsed, ' To our right trusty and welbiloued clerc, Master Thomas Tong, our general commissarie, or his depute.' 2 On some notes of receipts from Embleton church, between 1453 and 1464, there is an endorsement with some particulars of church expenses : e.g. for a flask of oil, 4s. 6d. ; paid to T. Holman, 4s. 8d. for 4i flasks of oil at is. id. the flask : ' pro locione corporalium,' is. 6d. ; paid to the church clerks for the vigils of St. Edmund, St. Katherine, and St. Mary, .\u00a31 os. iod.; for making wax candles, 9W. ; for 3 dozen candles for the choir, 4s. 4d. ; for 2,600 pieces of bread for the mass at 7d. the thousand, is. 7d. ('is. 7d. pro ij'\"1 vjc de pane missali juxta vijJ pro mille' ). 1464. In this year, being that in which the battle of Hexham took place, a bursar rode from Oxford to Embleton. The memoranda, which he kept during his journey, are preserved at Merton college, and have been printed.3 In 14S5, whilst Thomas Harbottle was vicar, a writ of privy seal was issued, directing all royal officers to assist the proctors of 'Marton, Oxford,' in making the best possible profit out of the parsonages of ' Emmyldon and Ponteyland.' The writ concludes: ' We late you wite that we, bering semblable zele and affection in that behalfe, haue straitly charged and commaunded the proctours of the saide college to lette and approwe the forsaid personages to theire moost availe and increace.' ' The tithes were shortly afterwards let for various periods. In 1499 the lessees were Eleanor Ogle, widow; Richard Errington of London, gent.; William Dychehand of London, brewer; Robert Bewyk of London, draper, and Clement Waugh of London, brewer. The names show that the lessees were natives of Northumberland, who had gone to London to seek their fortunes in trade. Since the fifteenth century Merton college has remained in undisturbed possession of the advowson. It will now be convenient to tabulate those incumbents whose names have been already mentioned, and to give brief biographical notes of the later vicars. ' Merton College Deeds, No. 657. 2 Ibid.

[Parker was condemned in costs.] There were afterwards proceedings against Parker's curate, Alexander Cunningham : ' Office against Alexander Cunningham, clerk, of the parish of Embleton. The said Alexander Cunningham in the months of September, October, and November in this present year 1719, intruded into the parish church of Emeldon and the chapels of Rennington and Rock, and usurped the desk ; and particularly on Sunday, November ist, you did usurp the reading desk in the chapel of Rennington, and tho' requested by Richard Parker, the vicar, to quit the same and suffer him to do his duty, you prevented him and said that you would cause him to lose his vicarage. You have got possession of and keep the keys of the chapels of Rennington and Rock which belong to the vicar. On Sunday last, 15th November, about 8 o'clock in the morning, when the church door was opening that the first bell might be rung, you intruded yourself and took possession of the reading desk, imposing upon the clerk by saying unjustly that you had authority from the court of Durham for these five years to get mto Mr. Parker's desks, by which you obstructed him in the execution of his office.

It would appear from this evidence that Parker's habits had been censured by Cunningham, and eventually the vicar was forced to take proceedings for slander against his curate. Parker seems to have paid some attention to business matters. In 1723 there was an action in the Consistory Court, 'Richard Parker, vicar of Embleton, v. Daniel Craster ; subtraction of Easter reckonings for the last two years, he [Craster] having eight communicants in his family.'

It is difficult to conceive how the impropriator, Mr. Carr, can make so little of his tithery under Merton college as ,\u00a32,000, the sum at which it was computed by my informants at the visitation. The Rev. G. D. Grimes is the present vicar, of course sometime Fellow of Merton, and, what is far better, a zealous, kind-hearted gentleman. He is making great additions and improvements to the vicarage house, under the plan of Mr. Dobson, an architect of some celebrity at Newcastle. It is satisfactory to find that the old tower is to be retained, as it is one of those mentioned in the license of Edward IV. to certain incumbents in this archdeaconry to \" crenellate \" and fortify their official houses.2 The more recent additions have been in a pitiful taste, and the rooms are so low as to be hardly wholesome. Mr. Boulter, Mr. Grimes's immediate predecessor, was, to say the best of him, a very unfit and discreditable person in the situation to which his college thought proper to present him. It is not pleasant to say so, but it appears to me that collegiate patronage is not the source from which the church is to expect its most profitable servants. Men idle away their best years in the questionable society of a common room, and take orders only at the moment when some favoured benefice becomes vacant. They are then transplanted to some remote country village, strangers to professional duties and habits and not having the ordinary shrewdness of mixed secular society. However, such things are and must be, and certainly Mr. Grimes is an exception in a great degree to my reasoning. Mr. Boulter put a new roof on the house, but never paid for it, and I have more than once been addressed by the poor workmen, in order that I might intercede with the bishop or the college ; of course I was not justified in any such interference. The new rooms are to look into the garden, and towards his present front Mr. Grimes has been accommodated by Lord Tankerville, the lord of the manor, with a long coveted extension under a lease. The population of Embleton amounts to 1,500 ; the church will contain 400; they have two services on Sundays and sacraments four times a year. The plate is really magnificent, the gift, as a very modest inscription declares, of Mr. Craister, that good man, who has a heart and a purse open to every generous impulse.

The registers commence in 1683 ; the average of burials in the year amounts to 14 ; marriages, 7 ; baptisms, 34. There are many Presbyterians in the parish, but no meeting house. The Hendersons of Newton are Catholics. General Grey of Fallodon has built a gallery for his own use about twenty years since, and worthy vicar Edwards's gallery is still in existence, and is let for \u00a31 18s. yearly. To be sure his ensigns armorial are none but a Welshman could bear, his motto is what none but a Welshman could read, and, I think I may add, the laudatory verses on the gallery are none but a Welshman could write. Mr. Craister has a vault under his porch. Upon the whole this is a very handsome church ; it has escaped the contagious chilly fit, with which \" the kirk \" has infected many of our Border parish churches, and has the varied ornaments, excrescences, and inconveni ences which different generations have contributed, and I tolerate and like them all, because they have been so contributed.

The money is paid by Mr. Bosanquet of Rock.

The village of Embleton is squallid enough .... the parish, however, is highly respectable; the Craisters and the Greys are patterns for parishioners.

Description of the Church The church, dedicated to the Holy Trinity, stands a little to the west of the village, and consists of a nave, with north and south aisles and a clere story, a chancel, an engaged western tower, and a south porch. In addition there is at the east end of the north aisle, and projecting northwards from it, 1 'Eikon Basilice.' 2 Diocesan Calendar. ' Proc. Soc. Ant. Newc. vol. iv. p. 241."], [103, "EMBLETON church. 75 a chantry chapel. The nave is 53 feet long and 16 feet wide, the aisles being, respectively, the north 12 feet, the south 13 feet wide ; the chancel is 37 feet long and 18 feet wide. There is nothing to indicate that there was a church at Embleton before the Conquest, no remains of such a building or of a memorial cross of that period at present existing. There are, however, some remains in the lower stage of the tower which show that there was a stone church built before the end of the eleventh or in the early part of the twelfth century. This church no doubt consisted of a nave without aisles, with a tower at the west end, and a chancel. Of the tower the lower portion is still left. It was lighted by two small narrow round-topped windows, widely splayed internally, placed opposite each other in the north and south wall, 7 feet above the ground, which remain though partly obscured and built up. Nothing exists of the Norman nave or chancel, except the walls of the nave in which the arcades were afterwards inserted. The first alteration seems to have been the replacing of the original chancel by one, probably larger, towards the end of the twelfth century, about 1 180. There is no certain proof that this change took place, but the present modern chancel arch is supported upon two capitals of very good design, having the Transitional volute of a late form carved upon them. These can scarcely have belonged to any other part of the church than the chancel arch. The next change that took place was the addition of aisles to the nave, and the insertion of an arcade of three bays on either side in the old walls about the year 1200. No further alteration appears to have been made until the fourteenth century, when, about 1330-40, the aisles were rebuilt on a more extended plan. They were made much wider, and were projected westwards as far as the west wall of the tower, so that the tower, which in the Norman church had been isolated, became an engaged one. The two upper stages of the tower were then rebuilt. At the same time a chapel was added, for the purposes of a chantry, at the east end of the north aisle, into which it opens by a segmental pointed arch of two orders with no hood-moulding. To resist the thrust of this arch a short massive buttress was constructed eastwards. No more additions or altera tions appear to have been made until the present century, when an entirely new chancel with its arch has superseded one which not many years before had replaced the old one. All the windows in the body of the church have been renewed, probably in the main being copies of those already existing."], [104, "76 EMBLETON PARISH The tower consists of three stages, the lower one retaining its original Norman features, with the two small windows, now blocked, which have already been mentioned. The two upper stages are of the time 1330-4\u00b0, when large alterations were made in the church. The middle stage has on the west side two small square-headed windows, and on the south a small trefoil-headed one. This stage may have constituted a chamber for tem porary or even more permanent residence, to which these windows would give light. The upper, the belfry stage, has on each side a window of two lights with cusped heads, and divided at mid-height by a transom. The parapet is an open one, with six trefoil-headed openings, stepped, on each side, and a square-crocketed pinnacle at each corner and one at the middle of each face. The belfry contains a peal of bells lately cast by Mears of London. The tower has a very picturesque and effective appearance as it rises above the surrounding trees, which give it an additional charm, their soft green shade contrasting pleasantly with its grey stones. It compares very favourably with many ambitious but unsightly towers with which the false and meretricious 'taste' of the present day has marred the repose and dignity of our churches. The nave has two aisles of the same date, and not differing except in some trifling details. The arcades are each of three bays, the arches being supported on octagonal shafts with moulded capitals. The eastern arch of both the north and south arcade springs from a corbel, which has incipient Early English foliage and a moulded abacus. The corresponding west ones are in each case modern. The arches have two chamfered orders, the outer one is ornamented with a single dog-toothed flower at the springings, those over the easternmost column of the south arcade being of an earlier form than the rest. The hood-mouldings have the nail head ornament. They terminate in the spandrels on the north with modern heads, which may possibly represent original ones ; on the south they are carved with floriated crosses of a very good and unusual design. In the north aisle, just above the eastern pillar, is a square-moulded bracket of the same date as the widening ofthe aisle, about 1330-40, probably inserted to hold a light or image in con nection with the adjoining chantry. There are two windows in the side walls and one at the east end of each aisle. They are all similar, of two lights, with foliated heads, and though modern probably reproduce the original windows. They correspond, except in their having no transom, with the"], [105, "EMBLETON CHURCH. belfry windows of the tower. The three windows at the west end are modern, of new and poor design, but the rear arch in each case is old. The Interior of Embleton Church (from the south-west). clerestory on each side, built about 1330-40, contains three windows of three lights, the rear arches being old, but the tracery modern. The arches open ing into the western extension of the aisles are both modern. The responds"], [106, "yg EMBLETON PARISH. of the tower arch are pear-shaped, and of the time of the nave arcades, but the arch itself is later, and may possibly be of the same date as the upper stages ofthe tower, about 1330-40.

A groove for the par close screen exists on each side of the arch. There appears to have been another chantry, or possibly two, at the east end of the north aisle, with which two niches, one on each side of the east window, were, no doubt, connected. The niches have ogee heads, cusped and moulded, and beneath each is a piscina (that to the Doorway into the Porch. north having a semi-circular head, the other one being of an ogee shape). There has been another chantry at the east end of the south aisle, connected with which is a square aumbry placed in the east wall just south of the corbel"], [107, "EMBLETON CHURCH. 79 from which the eastern arch of the nave arcade springs. There are two brackets at different levels on the north side of the east window of the aisle which are each carved with a female head. To the south ofthe window is a plain chamfered bracket. These three brackets may none of them be in situ though they probably all belong to the chantry. The font is modern, the old one having been given at the ' restoration ' to the church of Rennington. The nave is entered from a south porch by a moulded doorway, but there is no appearance of any doorway having ever existed on the north side. The south doorway is either a modern copy of the old one or has been rechiselled. The doorway into the porch has an obtusely-pointed arch with a continuous moulding and a hood-mould of good section, which terminates in angels holding scrolls, all the stone being much decayed. At the top of the arch is a demi-angel with spread wings, and above it is a niche which has been richly decorated ; the bracket at its base is carved with foliage, and there are buttresses on each side terminating in crocketed finials, which flank a fine semi-octagonal crocketed canopy, the soffit of which has vaulting ribs and a central boss cut upon it. On the walls of the porch are built in several grave-covers of somewhat unusual design, which will be better understood from the engravings of them than by any description.

In the north transept there is a monument inscribed, ' Shafto Craster Craster, esq., captain H.M. Eighth, the King's Regiment, third son of Thomas Wood Craster, esq., of Craster ; who died of fever at Kangra, British India, 11th April, 1856, aged 29 years. He is buried where he died; a tablet to his memory is placed in the church at Julundur by his brother officers and the soldiers of his company, the Grenadiers, in token of their sorrowing regard.' In the churchyard is the following inscription : ' In memory of Major-General Darling, who died 7th of September, 1835, aged 81 years. He served his king and country for 58 years, a great part of which time he was employed abroad. He desired his remains to be interred in this spot, the family vault being in the aisle of the church, near the vestry door.' The vicarage is to the south-west of the church. The garden to the south was tastefully laid out in 1828 during the incumbency of Mr. George Grimes, when large additions were made to the house by Dobson of Newcastle.1 The ancient tower, incorporated in the modern masonry, is almost completely obscured by the ivy and elms which surround it. The tower was built in 1395, at a cost of in consequence of the ravages of the Scots, who had recently encamped in the fields of Embleton.2 It is mentioned as the vicar's property in the list of towers drawn up in 1415.3 This tower is remarkable for having two vaulted chambers in its base ment, the vaults both resting on a partition wall in the centre. The northern chamber is 16 feet 7 inches long from north to south, and 12 feet 4 inches wide. In the middle of the north wall is a fire-place 5 feet 7 inches wide, the head being formed of one large stone. This fire-place slightly projects, and the outside corners of the jambs are worked with a concave chamfer. On the left of it is an aumbry 2 feet wide and deep, and 1 foot 9 inches high ; on the right is a smaller aumbry. Near the south-west corner of this vault are two pointed doorways side-by-side. That on the right, with the door-check on the outside, has led from a straight mural staircase which has now disappeared, but which can still be traced from the stones of the roof rising in steps. That on the left, with the door-check on the inside, opens into the southern chamber, 13 feet 8 inches long from north to south, and 10 feet 6 inches wide See p. 73. 2 See p. 67.

These vaults, now much encumbered with modern partitions, are approached from the house on the west by a door near the south-west corner of the northern vault. There is, however, reason to suppose that the original entrance to the tower was at the first floor level. The churchyard immediately to the north is so much higher than the ground on which the tower stands, that access to the first floor would have Embleton i Vicarage (from the north-east). been easy from that side, and there are signs outside of some opening in the middle of the north wall at that level, though it is difficult to determine the size and character of this opening owing to its being much concealed by a comparatively modern structure built up against it. It may have been a mere crack in the wall, as this end of the tower has been tied together with strong iron bars, and the chimney from the large fire-place in the basement seems to ascend at this point. There is also a square-headed original opening, 2 feet Vol. II. \""], [112, "82 EMBLETON PARISH. wide, at the north end of the east wall, extending too low down to have been a window of the first floor. It was certainly more than 5 feet, and may have been 6 feet long. Internally the first floor possesses little interest : the mural stair to the vaults, which went down from the south-west corner, is not now accessible ; some steps of the rough stair that led to the second floor are, however, to be seen in a. cupboard in the north-east corner. The second floor was originally, it would seem, one room, 34 feet 7 inches long, from north to south, and 14 feet 10 inches wide. Plain stone corbels are carried round all the walls of it. The roof rests on two thin gables at the north and south ends, with a lead walk round it. Judging from the water-tabling, the original roof was on a rather higher level than the present one, and the battlements, thin and low, dating possibly from the sixteenth century, would be useless for purposes of defence. The merlons are only 3 feet 8 inches in height from the water- tabling ; the embrasures are well proportioned, being 2 feet 2 inches wide by 2 feet 6 inches high. Externally, the tower, a rectangle, with a high, plain, chamfered base, measures 19 feet 8 inches from east to west, and 40 feet 7 inches from north to south. A chimney projects near to the centre of the east wall ; a three-light window, square-headed and labelled, and a small slit, have been blocked up to the south side of it. There is a two-light window of the same character on the second floor. The south side has been all either redressed or refaced, as also the lower portion of the south end of the west wall. NEWTON-BY-THE-SEA. Newton-by-the-sea is a township containing 1,211 acres and a population of 220 persons.1 The township is bounded on the north by the Tuggal burn, which, skirting the south side of Crookletch, falls into Beadnell Bay at the northern end of the Newton Links.

A conspicuous object near the Seahouses is the white cottage of the coastguard station, which stands on an eminence of about a hundred feet in height, and commands a wide view both of sea and land. One of the most striking views of Dunstanburgh can be obtained by climbing up the mound upon which the flagstaff stands. Immediately in the centre of the township stands the modern house called Newton Hall, the property of Mr. John Forster, which seems in vain to seek protection from the east wind by the shelter of a few stunted trees. There are three other substantial houses at Newton, namely, the North Farm, which stands close to the sea in the midst of the Links ; Newton Barns, near the boundary of Brunton ; and the house belonging to Mr. Edward Liddell. To the south of Newton Barns some old pits may be seen, which recall the time when coal was worked. The manor of Newton-by-the-sea was a part of the barony of Vesci, and was held along with the township of Earle, lying to the south-west of Wooler, by John Viscount for one knight's fee.1 By a deed, which may be assigned to the period between 1237 and 1244, John Viscount 'the third' gave a third part of Earle and a moiety of Newton to Robert de Hebburn to be held by the service of one knight.2 At about the same time he made various grants of land in Newton to Sir William Heron, who was afterwards constable of Bamburgh castle and sheriff of Northumberland. He gave to Heron his demesne land in Newton with the chief messuage, which had been enclosed, and a moiety of his stone quarry. Heron also received forty acres of land which had been in the actual possession of John Viscount, and forty acres which Adam Mandever and William de Bedenal held with two tofts. John Viscount moreover gave him the reversion of some land held by William Noreis and his wife Christina, after Christina's death, and two bovates held by William son of Reginald, along with William and his following, the meadow called ' Rafinspol,'3 the ' Milnacker,' and 'le Hesdacker.' It was 1 Testa de Nevill; Hodgson, Northd. III. i. pp. 209, 210. 2 Robert de Hebburn had held land in Newton at an earlier date. See a deed in Raine, North Durham, app. dccxiii., by which the father of John Viscount III. gave to the monks of Fame an acre at Newton between the meadow of Robert de Hebburn, knight, and that of Simon Barn' (? Baron). The deed of John Viscount III. is printed in the Northumberland Visitation, edited by Joseph Foster, p. 66. In the copy of the Visitation, edited by George Marshall, LL.D., the pedigree of the Hebburns begins with Robertus Hebborne, primus dominus manerii de Newton.' 8 This property afterwards belonged to Sir Thomas de St. Maur, who possessed the meadow called Ravenspol in 1345, see p. 87."], [114, "84 EMBLETON PARISH. stipulated that Sir William Heron and his men should grind their corn at the mill at Newton in the usual way, and that they should pay a fine of twelve pence if brought before the manor court for any offence, except that of shedding blood or doing personal violence to the lord and lady of the manor.1 During the same period John Viscount gave to Adam Ribaud two bovates in Newton, with the toft and croft which Adam Cementarius held, and the services of Adam and his following. Permission was given to Adam Ribaud to cut twenty cart-loads of peat in the moss called ' Wythtestrother ' under the superintendence of John Viscount's servant.2 Shortly afterwards, when the neighbouring barony of Embleton came into the possession of Simon de Montfort, Adam Ribaud surrendered his newly acquired rights. He gave to Earl Simon the land in Newton which he had received from John Viscount, along with Emma the serf, wife of Adam Cementarius, and her sons.3 At Simon de Montfort's death his interest in Newton, with the barony of Embleton, came into the hands of Earl Edmund of Lancaster, and on the 9th of November, 1278, Earl Edmund gave his holding in Newton to Sir Lawrence de St. Maur, a wealthy baron. It may be noted in the deed of gift that the earl makes no explicit mention of manorial rights, but gave to Sir Lawrence the ' holding which we held of the fee of Lord John de Vescy at a rent of forty pence, and a pound of pepper which we received from the vill of Yerdehull [Earle], to be held by homage, with wreck of the sea so far as it belongs to us.' Sir Lawrence also received the right to cut wood at Shipley for the maintenance of his mill at Newton, a provision which shows that the township must have been then devoid of timber.4 The family to 1 It was stipulated that the land should be held 'tam libere sicut aliquod aliud dominicum in Northum- bria liberius, quiecius tenetur et possidetur.'

Cer tain serfs living on the manor were also assigned to her as a portion of her dower, amongst whom are mentioned John Suter, Beatrice the widow, Robert Turpyn, and others.2 Sir Nicholas de St. Maur was succeeded by his son Sir Thomas, nine years of age at the time of his father's death, who afterwards founded the Gilbertine priory of Pulton in Wiltshire, attached to the priory of Sempring ham in Lincolnshire, He attained full age in the year 1330, and six years later another subsidy was levied on the inhabitants of his manor of Newton by-the-sea. Amongst those who paid this tax was John Suter, who was one of the serfs assigned to Sir Thomas de St. Maur's mother, Elena.

The meadow called Ravenspol, which had been granted to Heron, was included in the lease of the land, which was to be held for a rent of four pounds of silver during the life of William de Coundon, or until the death of the lessor.3 The lessee, William de Coundon, was Sir Thomas de St. Maur's bailiff, and was defendant in a suit concerning the custom of 'cane fish,' which pre vailed in the neighbouring manor of Embleton, but from which the tenants of Newton claimed exemption. On Monday, the 21st of August, 1346, Robert Wendout brought an action against William de Coundon in the manor court at Embleton to recover as damages for the seizure of cer tain fish.

A jury of inhabitants of the district, having been summoned to enquire into all the circumstances of the case, reported that Sir Thomas de St. Maur, as lord of Newton, held half the township in demesne and half in service,1 but that the toll of fish was not one of the legal profits of the manor. A formal ver dict was therefore entered on the roll in favour of Robert Wendout.2 Robert Wendout, the complainant in this suit, owned land in Newton, Hebburn near Chillingham, Earle near Wooler, and elsewhere. Matilda, the daughter of Isabella de Hebburn, and wife of William Darrayns,3 granted to Wendout all her land at Newton at a rent of one hundred shillings for the term ofher life from the 19th of March, 1350.' Two years after the date of this lease Sir Thomas de St. Maur trans ferred the manor of Newton to Sir John Stryvelyn, a well-known Scottish knight. By a deed dated the 5th of August, 1352, Sir Thomas de St. Maur confirmed to Sir John Stryvelyn all his rights in the manor and township of Newton-by-the-sea, with a revenue of a pound of pepper payable by the township of Earle, and all the holdings which John de Hebburn had held of Sir Lawrence de St. Maur, his grandfather, in Hebburn.5 The services of all the tenants at Newton were also formally transferred, amongst which are specified the services due from Sir Edmund de Craster, William Darrayns, Robert Wendout, Sir Thomas Grey, and Matilda Darrayns. A boat,6 speci ally maintained for the purpose of levying the obnoxious and illegal custom of 'cane fish,' was also handed over to Sir John de Stryvelyn 'with the right to take the best fish from all ships and boats coming with fish, which due is called le Cane.'1 It is evident that the lord of the manor attached slight 1 ' Qui dicunt quod Thomas de Seynt Maur est dominus ville de Newton, videlicet de medietate in dominico et medietate in servitio.' \"- A deed is preserved at Merton college by which Sir Thomas de St. Maur gave to William de Coundon in April, 1348, a piece of land at Newton on the east side of the road leading to Bamburgh.

When Robert Wendout died in 1379, his moiety of Newton was of very small value, because almost all the tenants had died of a pestilence.2 Two thirds of his share of Newton, equivalent to one-third of the whole manor, descended by inheritance to the Hebburns through Isabel, John Wendout's sister.3 In the meantime the portion of Newton which had been acquired by Sir John Stryvelyn in 1352, passed by settlement to Sir John Middleton and his wife, Christina.'1 Christina de Middleton survived her husband and died in 1422, being succeeded by her son, also named John.6 In 1427, therefore, when a subsidy was levied, Newton-by-the-sea was in the hands of four proprietors, namely, Sir Ralph Grey, Sir John Middleton, Edward Wetwang, and the heirs of Thomas Hebburn.6 The part belonging to Sir Ralph Grev had descended to him from his great-grandfather Sir Thomas Grey, a landowner in Newton- in 1352.7 Edward Wetwang and the heirs of Thomas Hebburn were co-heirs of Robert Wendout, as has been already stated.

Bradford and his son Roland refused to quit some of the farms and said that Sir John Mordaunt ' should as soon have both their lives as put them from their takkes and holdes.' The tenants were not removed from the property until a special writ had been obtained.2 Sir John Mordaunt himself was soon afterwards in some risk of losing his estate. Sir John Middleton, at his death, had left various debts unpaid, which he had incurred in his capacity of sheriff. On the 21st of October, 1534, the manors of Newton and Brunton were temporarily confiscated, as security for the debts due to the Crown from Sir John Middleton's repre sentatives, and they were not restored till Sir John Mordaunt brought an action in the Court of Exchequer, when he obtained restitution by a special order of court, dated the 16th of May, 1536.3 About a year afterwards Sir John Mordaunt, then Lord Mordaunt, sold Newton and Brunton to a certain Henry Whytreason of London for the sum of a thousand marks,4 reserving to Ralph Carr the interest he had acquired under the terms of a lease executed prior to the deed of sale.5 Whytreason seems to have sold the estate immediately, and Newton then became divided into several fragments. A moiety came into the possession of Sir Reginald Carnaby, who held it till his death in 1545,6 when it passed into the posses sion of George Lawson of Little Usworth, by his marriage with Sir Reginald Carnaby's daughter, Mabel. One-third of the manor became the property of Henry Wetwang of Dunstan, and the remaining one-sixth was held by Edmund Craster and John Carr.

On the 28th of May, 1653, George Clarkson and Samuel Foxlev contracted with 'the trustees for the sale of lands and estates forfeited to the Comonwealth for treason,' and amongst other lands they bought 'that farmehowse in the townshipp of Newton-by-the-sea called by the name of Newton farme, late parcel of Sir William Fenwicke's estate.'1 But the purchasers did not obtain the peaceful possession which they desired, as their claim was vigourously con tested by Sir Andrew Young of Burne, near Selby, in Yorkshire, who had married Sir William Fenwick's eldest daughter, Mary. From the following letter, written to a sister-in-law,2 it appears that Sir Andrew Young was negotiating a sale of Newton, regardless of the sequestration. In reading the letter it should be remembered that Sir William Fenwick died, whilst in strict retirement, in London, on May the 29th, and was buried on May the 31st, 1652.3 The fact of his death did not then become public, and Crom well's Parliament on November the 2nd, 1652, resolved that 'the name of Sir William Fenwick of Meldon, knight, be inserted in the bill for the sale of lands forfeited to the Commonwealth for treason.'

Newton-by-the-sea, where never any was held, and had no grant nor pre scription, and gott all his barnmen, servants, and coaters to gett up a jury.'1 The township was held in common until the 20th of November, 1725, when a division was agreed upon.2 The deed of division shows that the chief proprietors were Richard Witton of Wakefield and his mother Elizabeth, Joseph Forster, and George Davison. For convenience the township was divided into two parts, of which the Wittons took the east, and Forster and Davison the west part.3 The eastern half belonged 'to the heirs of John Witton, clerk' in 1787. The Rev. John Witton's widow, Mary, married Peregrine Wentworth. The latter answered for the freehold at the court at Stamford in 1788.4 The property was afterwards acquired by Miss Taylor, who by her will dated the 3rd of December, 1807, devised to Edward Henderson 'the reputed manor' of Newton-by-the-sea. It was conveyed by Edward Henderson in 1827 to John Potts. In 1860 the estate consisted of 601 acres, with 218 acres of sea beach, with a rental of \u00a3992. It was sold in that year by Mr. Potts of Benton Park near Newcastle to Mr. C. T. N. Mather of Longridge. It has recently been exchanged bv Mr. Mather's widow (now Lady Jerningham) for Morris hall near Norham, and at present belongs to Lady Jerningham's brother, Mr. Edward Liddell. The portion which belonged to Joseph Forster of Hartlaw now belongs to Mr. John Magennies Forster, the lineal representative of this branch of the family. Mr. Forster's property includes the Old Hall, which, notwithstand ing its name, does not preserve many traces of antiquity. 1 Duke of Northumberland's MSS. 2 A deed was drawn up on the 28th January, 1714, by which were conveyed 'a house, late in the occupation of Eleanor Mackdual, and one ridge of ground adjoining the dwelling house, one ridge in the tofts, one ridge without the mill gate bordering upon Waterfolds, one ridge in the west field adjoining to the pounder's meadow, and one in the Ryes Moor, and a third ofa deal of meadows lying along with Mrs. Hanna Baron's in the field called Tugle rod dale, in all amounting to four acres together.'

Edward Forster, described as 'of Elford,' who sold Brinkburn, 18th April, 1626, to George Fenwick, mentions his father Nicholas Forster, his grandfather Sir John Forster, and his brothers Sir Claudius and John Forster.

BRUNTON. The small township of Brunton lies between Newton-by-the-sea and Preston, and in its history has much in common with these two places. The old spelling 'Burneton' indicates that the name is derived from the situation of the two small hamlets of High and Low Brunton upon the stream which intersects the township.1 Brunton was a part of the barony of AInwick, and its first recorded owner was Walter Bataill, whose predecessors had held it with the adjacent 1 Brunton covers 971 acres, and its population is not one-sixth of what it was forty-three years ago, when the railway was being built.

From its connection with the Bataill family the place was in early times known as 'Burneton Bataill,' probably to distinguish it from East and West Brunton in the barony of Bolam and the parish of Gosforth.1 In the later part of the thirteenth century Walter Bataill gave a large amount of land in Preston to the canons of AInwick abbey to increase the gift which his father Henry had previously conferred upon them, and granted them leave to grind their corn at the Brunton mill.2 Very shortly afterwards Brunton became the property of Sir William de Middleton, whose heirs were in possession of the place in the year 1288.3 John de Middleton, Sir William's son, was then a minor, and his name does not appear among the half dozen persons who paid tax at Brunton in 1296.

The chief messuage was found to be waste, and attached to it there were 260 acres of demesne. There were thirteen bondage holdings and four cottage holdings ; there had been also in former times two water mills on the 1 ' Willelmus de Vescy tenet Burneton Batayll ....

There was one freeholder named Walter Mirre, and the usual brewery. The lands of Sir John Middleton in Northumberland were found to have greatly depreciated in value, for they had produced in times past \u00a371 7s. 7|d., but in 1333 they were only worth \u00a344 7s. 7^d.1 Very soon after this survey was made Brunton, with Preston, was granted to Sir John de Stryvelyn by Edward III. on the Sth of October, 1335. The grant states that Sir John de Stryvelyn had long rendered good service in the Scottish wars, and that he had been taken prisoner by the Scots and kept in strict custody, until he had paid a large sum of money for his ransom.2 Sir John's name appears as one ofthe three men who paid subsidy at Brunton in 1336.3 He seems to have rebuilt the house at Brunton, and to have founded and endowed a chantrv chapel there dedicated to the Virgin. On the 19th of July, 1343, Richard de Kellawe, bishop of Durham, admitted William de Multon, priest, to the chantry on the presentation of Sir John Stryvelyn.4 Sir John died on the 15th of August, 1378, leaving no issue, so far as was then ascertained.5 He had married for his second wife Jane, daughter of Richard de Emeldon,11 but had entailed Brunton on his kinsman, Sir John de Middleton and his wife Christina, and failing them on Roger de Widdrington and his wife.7 It is not clear in what way Sir John de Middleton was related to Sir John Stryvelyn, but he was a member of the family to which Brunton had previously belonged, and the transaction may have been regarded as a restitution. 1 'Summa hujus extente ut fuit in antiquo lxxj\" vii\" viia ob. et summa dicte extente ut valet nunc xliiij\" vij* vij'1 ob.'

Sir John Mordaunt, created Lord Mordaunt, sold his lands in the north about 1537,4 and Brunton then came into the hands of Sir Reginald Carnaby, whose daughter Katherine married Cuthbert, Lord Ogle. The relief due from Lord Ogle and his wife for their lands in Brunton and Fallodon was still unpaid in 1581.5 Mabel, another daughter of Sir Reginald Carnaby, married George Lawson of Usworth, and a large part of Brunton remained in the possession of the Lawson family till a comparatively recent date.6 Before passing to the later history of Brunton a few words may be said about the chapel founded by Sir John Stryvelyn. The wording of Bishop Richard's writ in 1343 shows clearly that the chantry chapel was dedicated to the Virgin, and was itself situated within the manor of Brunton. The endowment, however, consisted of various small parcels of land scattered throughout the parish, worth \u00a34 1 is. 5d. a year in the reign of Henry VIII.7 Shortly before the dissolution of the chantries the advowson was in the pos session of Sir Ralph Harbottle (who succeeded to much of Sir John Stry velyn's property) and it afterwards belonged to his grand-daughter, Eleanor, Lady Percy. The following curious depositions, taken about the year 1545, refer to a quarrel about the advowson : 1 ' Et [est ibidem] advocacio cujusdam cantarie presentande capellano idoneo domus.'

In a lease dated the 20th of February, 155 1, Edward Bradford became tenant of the chantry lands specified as follows : Chantry of the Virgin Mary in the parish of Emelton now dissolved and all lands thereto belonging, namely, one tenement now or lately held by George Swanne ; rent, \u00a31 3s.

Sir Thomas Gray, the receiver of Dunstan burgh, stated on the other hand that Bradford's complaints were untrue, and that he was 'notoriously knowne for a clamorous man and of an impudente condicione.'1 At the close of the sixteenth century, as has been already mentioned, Brunton belonged to the two daughters of Sir Reginald Carnaby, one of whom, Catherine, married Cuthbert, Lord Ogle. Upon the death of Lord Ogle, in 1 60 1, his estates descended to his two daughters, and a part of Brunton eventually became the property of Lord Ogle's grandson, Sir William Cavendish, better known as the duke of Newcastle (upon-Tyne). The duke of Newcastle's grand-daughter, Margaret, married Gilbert, earl of Clare, and in this way the estate became eventually the property of William, duke of Portland, great-grandson of the countess of Clare. On the 28th of February, 1788, the duke of Portland sold an estate of 204 acres at Low Brunton to Henry Taylor of Rock and William Taylor of Christon Bank for Henry Taylor and his brother William both died unmarried, and their property went to their sister, Mary Taylor,2 who, by will, dated 3rd December, 1807, devised Low Brunton to her kinsman, Edward Henderson, of Edinburgh. On the 15th of August, 1828, Henderson sold the property for to Henry Taylor (formerly Aynsley) of Christon Bank. Subse quently, on the 1st of May, 1839, Taylor sold Low Brunton for \u00a3gj20 to Mr. John Railston of North Sunderland, by whom again it was trans ferred on the nth of November, 1862, to Sir George Grey for \u00a315, ooo.3 Sir George Grey afterwards sold to Major A. H. Browne the large portion of his land lying east of the railway, retaining the remainder as a part of his property at Fallodon. The small portion of Brunton, which Sir George Grey retained, now belongs to Sir Edward Grey. Mabel, the other daughter of Sir Reginald Carnaby, married George Lawson of Usworth, and in this way an estate at High Brunton was united to the land which the Lawsons held at Newton-by-the-sea.4 This portion 1 Duchy of Lancaster Pleadings, vol. 51, No. 10 b, 4 Eliz. 1561/2. 2 A pedigree of Taylor will be found under Doxford. s Abstract of title in the possession of Mr. John Bolam of Bilton 4 The descent of this property is illustrated by the pedigree, etc., in the account of Newton-by-the-sea."], [138, "108 EMBLETON PARISH of High Brunton became the propertv of Elizabeth, the only daughter of Wilfrid Lawson of Wakefield, and was sold by her children on the 4th of November, 173 1, to Thomas Forster of Lucker and Brunton.1 Thomas Forster belonged to a branch of the family, which had been connected with Brunton since the sixteenth century. There is little doubt that he was de scended in direct line from Cuthbert Forster of Brunton, the second son of Thomas Forster of Adderstone ;2 so that on the extinction of the main line of the Forsters of Adderstone the Brunton Forsters became the elder branch.3 Cuthbert Forster's descendants increased the small property which the founder of their family possessed by careful management and judicious marriages. The younger members of the family were in the habit of entering the army or navy, and it will be seen that many of them were engaged on sea or land in the memorable campaigns of the eighteenth century. The pedigree with the evidence on which it is based is set forth as follows. It will be observed that Matthew Forster, by his will in 1786, left his three daughters in remainder to his estates in Bamburgh and Embleton. They survived both their brothers, and upon a partition of the property Brunton became the share of Mrs. William Burrell of Broom Park. The estate was bought by Sir George Grey on the 12th of May, 1840, and a large part was sold by him with Low Brunton to Major A. H. Browne.4 1 Richard Witton of Lupsett, York, esq., and the Rev. John Witton of Witton, Huntingdon, in con- sideration of .\u00a32,500 sold the one-third part of the manor of Brunton to Thomas Forster of Lucker, gent. (High Brunton, abstract of title, among the deeds of Sir Edward Grey, at Fallodon.) George Ritschel, perpetual curate of Hexham, in his Account of the Charities of Tyndale Ward (printed at Newcastle in 17 13) states that 'M\u2122 Jane Lawson, spinster, daughter of Edward Lawson of Hexham, gent., desired her father upon her death-bed (anno Dom. 1637) to give 40\" a year for ever to 40 poor widows in Hexham, which was done by him, and afterwards Richard Witton of Wakefield, esq., who married the only daughter of Wilfrid Lawson of Wakefield, esq., eldest son of the said Edward, settled the 40* upon a farm in AInwick, on March 9th, 17 12. Mr Edward Lawson came from Brunton in Northumberland where his estate lay, and he designed to have built a seat-house for himself and family, and had provided timber and other materials for that purpose, but was diverted from that design by the death of his dear consort, and [he] thereupon removed to Hexham.' 2 Vol. i. pp. 228, 231. 3 The Brunton Forsters, like the parent house of Adderstone, were at one time very prolific. Robert Forster of Brunton, by his marriage with Seton, daughter of William Pratt, in 1779, had more than twenty children. 4 Major Browne built a good house at Brunton. The moor of 209 acres was divided on the 26th of September, 1759, in the proportion of one-third to the duke of Portland, and two-thirds to Thomas Forster of Lucker.

In the records of the Consistory Court at Durham (1729/31) there are notes of a suit ' Blossiers Tovey L.L.D., vicar of Embleton v. John Ostens of High Brunton for subtraction of the tithe of hay, etc., for High and Low Brunton.' Ostens alleged that Mr. Thomas Forster of Lucker was owner of the tithes, and Tovey exhibited a lease between Mr. Thomas Forster of Brunton, and Mr. Anthony Walker, vicar of Embleton, dated 20th December, 1619 ; it was alleged that Thomas Forster of Lucker was a descendant of this Thomas Forster of Brunton.

Whilst captain in one of the 'reduced regiments,' he was married at St. John's, Newcastle, on the 5th of March, 1764, to Sarah, only daughter of William Temple of Berwick. Newcastle Courant, ioth March, 1764. (The bishop ofLondon, Dr. Temple, is descended from William Temple, who was sometime mayor of Berwick). He is described as 'of Hoppen' on the 28th of February, 1774. He afterwards resided at Denwick, and finally at Berwick, where he died in 1787, leaving a widow, together with three sons and four daughters, amongst whom may be mentioned: (1) George, midshipman on H.M. ship 'Coro mandel,' and (2) Ralph, midshipman on board the same vessel. Both took part in quelling the mutiny of the fleet at the Nore. Afterwards, in 1797, they were master's mates in the ' Belliqueux,' and fought at Camperdown, when"], [143, "FALLODON. 113 every fourth man on board their ship was either killed or wounded. In 1799, on board the same ship, they took part in the capture of Helder fort and the Dutch fleet in the Texel. In 1804 George Forster was appointed second lieutenant of the ' Ardent,' and-was engaged in three different attacks on the enemy's flotilla at Boulogne. From exposure in a night attack he died soon after at Deal unmarried. Ralph was appointed to the ' Minotaur,' and in 1805 served at Trafalgar. A few years afterwards he died on board the 'Brazier' off the river Ems.

The township of Fallodon lies to the south of Brunton and to the west of Embleton.1 It is very well wooded, and in this respect differs from most of the surrounding country. Fallodon hall is approached from the south-west by an avenue, a mile in length, which contains many fine specimens of the silver fir. From the middle of this another long avenue of trees leads in a south easterly direction towards Christon Bank, and there are well-grown planta tions all over the estate. The soil is rich and favourable to the growth both of trees and plants, but the luxuriance of vegetation is the result of the combination of natural advantages and shelter with the fostering care of successive owners of the place for the last two hundred years. At the close of the seventeenth century, as will presently be seen, Fallodon was in the hands of Samuel Salkeld, who devoted much of his time to gardening, a pur suit in which he showed both taste and enterprise. In a work published in 1695, then appropriately entitled a New Book of Geography, there is a passage which shows that Salkeld had attained a more than local celebrity. The author says: 'the improvement in tillage at Rock by John Salkeld, esq., and in gardening and fruitery at Fallodon by Samuel Salkeld, gentle men, are fineries hardly to be met with in these parts ; the latter is the more 1 The township consists of 1,060 acres and has a population of less than a hundred.

The house itself is built of red brick, a material rarely used in the buildings of the neighbourhood. A portion was probably built by Thomas Wood when he obtained the property in the middle of the last century, but the house has undergone some change, and is in large part modern. Amongst the pictures at Fallodon there is a full length portrait of Sir George Grey, the second baronet, for many years Home Secretary. It was painted by Grant, and was presented to Lady Grey by her husband's Parliamentary friends.4 There were formerly standing in the grounds two celebrated ilex trees, mentioned in Selby's British Forest TreesY There were also two very large silver firs, one of which is still standing.6 Fallodon was a part of the AInwick barony, and was held with Lucker and South Charlton by the predecessors of Simon de Lucker in the reign of 1 A New Book of Geography, 1695, P- 41- 2 Mag. Brit. Northumb. p. 650. 3 See p. 118. 1 There is also a crayon drawing of Sir George Grey by Richmond, executed for the Grillon Club. Among the other pictures are a portrait of Mary Whitbread (wife of the first baronet), represented as a girl in white muslin with blue sash and white hat ; a portrait ofthe same, as a child of 3 years of age by Sir Thomas Lawrence ; two portraits ofthe first Earl Grey, and one ofhis wife ; and portraits of Captain the Hon. Sir George Grey and General the Hon. Sir Henry Grey. * 'The largest was blown down in 1865, and the other about twenty years since.

Cf. Atkinson, Remarkable Trees of Northumberland and Durham, 1873, p. 19. 6 Selby (British Forest Trees, p. 481), writing in 1842, mentions these. He says that the circumfer- ence of the stems at 2 feet from the ground was then more than 9 feet 8 inches. The smaller was blown down last November, and there are 125 rings visible upon it. It measured 15 feet 4 inches in girth immediately above the ground, and 13 feet 1 inch at 3 feet 6 inches above the ground. The larger fir, which is still standing, measures 14 feet in girth at 2 feet above the ground. In 1873 it was 12 feet 7 inches in girth at the same spot. Cf.

Simon de Lucker III. was a benefactor to the church, and at various times conferred gifts of land on Alnwick abbey and other religious houses.5 It is very probable, therefore, that he or his brother, Robert, had made a grant to the abbey of land at Fallodon. However this may be it is certain that the abbot and convent had acquired an interest in the township before the year 1323, and that in the later inquisitions of the Lucker family no mention is made of the Fallodon estate.6 The property belonging to Aln wick abbey consisted of more than ten bovates of land, and royal license was given to the representative of the abbey to appropriate this estate to the use of the abbot and convent on the 3rd of July, 1323.7 Two persons only paid subsidy at Fallodon thirteen years later, and both appear to have been ecclesiastics.8 1 ' Willelmus de Vescy tenet Falwedon ....

During the remainder of the fourteenth and the whole of the fifteenth century there is a dearth of information respecting the township, but it may be presumed that on the death of David de Lucker, in 1379, any title or claim to the township, which he may have had, would escheat to the Percys as over-lords. It will be remembered that David's uncle, Henry de Lucker, was still living at the time of David's death, but had been declared an outlaw at Newcastle-upon-Tyne in 1365.1 It is however remarkable that no men tion is made of Fallodon in the list of knight's fees on the Percy estate, which was made before the death of David de Lucker, namely, in 1368, on the death of Henry de Percy f nor is any mention made of land at Fallodon in the schedule ofthe estates of AInwick abbey compiled at the dissolution.8 The township reappears in the sixteenth century as the property of Sir Reginald Carnaby in common with the adjoining townships of Newton-by the-sea and Brunton,4 and is mentioned in the schedule of his estates drawn up after his death in 1547.5 Fallodon was then divided between Sir Reginald's two daughters, Katherine, the wife of Cuthbert, Lord Ogle,0 and Mabel, the wife of George Lawson of Usworth. In 1581 it had become the property of William Law son, son of Robert Lawson of Rock, and cousin of Mabel Lawson.7 On the list of freeholders in the barony of AInwick, made in 1586, it is noted that 'William Lawson, esquire, holds ofthe said earl [of Northumberland] Fallo don, by the 4th part of a knight's fee and other services, which Symon de Luckre did sometime hold, and renteth by year for castle ward and cornage 1 See vol i. p. 239. \" Tate, AInwick, i. p. 139 and Fonblanque, Annals ofthe House of Percy, app. vol. i. 3 Roll 32 Hen.

Soc. p. 18) there is a petition from an inhabitant of Fallodon in the fourteenth century. The petition sets forth that Christopher Fairbarne of Fallodon on the 2nd of May, 1391, went to Durham cathedral, and there after ringing the bells, sought the sanctuary ofthe church and the immunity of St. Cuthbert ('libertatem Sancti Cuthberti'). The petition further shows that Fairbarne with the assistance ofa youth named Robert Wilkynson on the preceding 19th of November had killed a man, named William Scott, in the mill of the adjoining township of Brunton. Fairbarne struck Scott on the head with a stick, commonly called 'le yrneforkeshafte,' and felled him. Wilkynson stabbed Scott whilst on the ground in the breast, ' cum uno le dagger,' inflicting a mortal wound ; and Fairbarne there- upon immediately fled to Durham. 4 On the list of landowners, compiled in 1541, it is stated that 'the heirs of Reginald Carnaby' then held Fallodon.

Ralph Salkeld appears to have shortly afterwards taken over from his nephews and nieces their interest in the township. He had himself made his fortune at Berwick, where his children were born. He had risen to prom inence in municipal affairs before 1649, when he was appointed to the office of postmaster ofthe town,2 and in 1652 he bought from the Berwick Guild the old church of Berwick, for the sum of excepting the pulpit, coats of arms, and other fittings.3 In 1656 he made a further investment in landed property by purchasing Swinhoe with William Webb, the Berwick school master, from Robert Clavering of Brinkburn.\" In 1663 Salkeld is entered in the rate book as the proprietor of Fallodon with a rental of a year,5 and in 1679 ne died leaving the towmship to his son Samuel. The improve ments which Samuel Salkeld was carrying out in the year 1695 at Fallodon have been already referred to.6 Samuel Salkeld, the eminent gardener, died in 1699, and the estate then came into the hands of his son William, who was educated at St. Edmund's hall, Oxford.

In this way the estate descended to General Sir Henry Grey, second son of Charles, first Earl Grey. Sir Henry Grey died in 1845, and Fallodon then went to his nephew, Sir George Grey, grandson of the first earl, and eldest son of Sir George Grey, captain R.N., who died in 1828. The Rev. Mandell Creighton, now bishop of Peterborough, wrote a short biographical sketch of the career of Sir George Grey, bart., who was for many years Home Secretary. In estimating the qualities of that states man, he says : Careful in action and moderate in speech he never invited opposition. He never attempted to be smart, nor spoke with bitterness. Of tall and commanding figure, endowed with genuine kindliness and genial manners, he was known to be a man of high character whose word could be implicitly trusted. . . . Few statesmen of modern times have had more friends and fewer enemies than Grey. His moral excellence and social charm were obvious to all who met him. ... He was singularly free from personal ambition, and gave himself entirely to the work of carrying on the business ofhis department. His moral qualities made him a valuable member of a cabinet where he was skilful in composing difficulties. He is a rare instance of a man who retired from politics without bitterness, and was to the end of his life a valued counsellor to statesmen of different opinions to himself.2 Sir George Grey died in 1882, and was buried at Embleton.3 Fallodon then descended to his grandson, the present owner, Sir Edward Grey, bart., M.P., Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in Mr. Gladstone's administration of 1892, and in Lord Rosebery's administration of 1894.

There is also a sandstone quarry to the south of a small piece of water, on which the village faces, whence the stone for the Norman chapel and most of the houses has probably been won. The limestone and sandstone seem to run east and west in parallel strips, and it is likely that the name of the place is derived from the limestone outcrop, which must formerly have been more conspicuous than it is now. The situation is exposed, but the hall is surrounded by old trees, limes, horse chestnuts, ashes, and sycamores, dating probably from before 1700. About 1820 an avenue, a mile and a half long, was planted to connect the hall with the great north road, at that time the main artery of traffic. The township appears to have been one holding since the time of Henry I., and there is no reason to suppose that there has been any alteration ofthe boundaries since that period.1 The hall lies to the west of the village and the chapel. It has been built at several different times, but a blocked-up doorway, in an out-building now used as a bakehouse, is the only portion to which an early date can be assigned with confidence. It appears to belong to the middle of the fourteenth century, and was probably the entrance to the oratory in which Robert de Tuggal obtained permission to have divine service performed in the vear 1359.2 The nucleus of the present house is an oblong tower not quite rectangular, divided by a modern partition into an outer and inner hall. The walls are from 3 feet 7 inches to 4 feet 10 inches thick, and the structure may be assigned to the later part of the fifteenth century.3 There are traces of what appear to be gable lines at the east end of the main tower ; they may be due to rebuilding after dilapidation. Adjoining this tower to the south is a smaller one, the lower part of which seems to be of the same period. It appears to have contained living rooms, as the chimney stack in it is a pro minent feature in old sketches of the house. For some reason, not immedi ately obvious, the north-west angle of the main tower is acute, and the west walls of both towers and the east wall of the smaller one are built to correspond with it, instead of being parallel to the east wall of the main 1 The map, made in 1599, subsequently referred to, shows that the boundaries of the township were at that time the same as those now shown on the Ordnance map. 2 See p. 124. s No tower at Rock is mentioned in the list of towers compiled in 141 5.

The original entrance was probably on the north side, facing the entrance to the oratory.1 Attached to the main tower to the north-west is a third small tower, about 20 feet square, of which the walls are from 2 to 3 feet thick. It may have been added in the sixteenth century. A large manor house was added to the north side of the tower in the seventeenth century by the Salkeld family.2 In this house there was pro bably a hall, the site of which is now occupied by the modern dining room Rock Hall IN 1819.

It may be assumed, therefore, that the oratory would be embraced in some sort of outer defences, leaving a courtyard between it and the tower that succeeded the early manor house. 2 The map of 1599 shows only the tower itself. 3 An elevation on an estate map, dated 1743, shows that the east front then extended further to the north than it does now. * This doorway is lower than it appears to be in the sketch of the unrestored house, and has been blocked up since the restoration in 1819, or possibly earlier. 5 In the Visitation of 1615, the arms of the Salkelds of Bassington are stated to have been argent fretty gules, on a chief of the last a martlet for difference or.

In the middle of the fourteenth century Rock became the property of Robert de Tuggal, a man of some wealth, who also possessed an estate at Scremerston in the north of Northumberland.

Both before and after the division the cultivated land was divided from the moor by the road, called White Cross Street, which runs almost perpendicularly across the map. A division of the township was desired by both lord and tenants for various reasons. The lord desired to throw together the scattered por tions of the demesne which lay intermixed with the tenants' land ; and, as the township is a large one, the tenants in the village found themselves too far away from their lands in the north of the township. So the whole was divided for agricultural purposes into two parts, as had been done at Long Houghton about forty years before.2 There were twelve farms, and each farm consisted of approximately 83 acres in all, i.e., 43 acres of arable, meadow7, and pasture, and 40 acres of waste. At the time of the division five of the tenants took the Arksley field and the old demesne, and the other seven tenants took the remainder of Earsley field and Rockley field, after the lord of the manor had been compensated for the demesne, which he had held in severalty or jointly with the tenants. The demesne moor was also transferred to the north-west of the township, whilst the old demesne moor and the residue of the town moor, after the lord of the manor had taken his share, were allotted to the tenants. Within the limits of each half township the common field system probably went on as before. There is nothing in the map or schedule to suggest that land was allotted to any farm in severalty ; but an effort was made to adapt the existing boundaries to the new state of things. Each of the new half townships could be divided by the existing hedge-rows into three fields, as the old township had been.3 The map shows that the village was considerably larger in 1599 than it is now, but that the 1 The area of the demesne, deduced from the figures on the map, differs from the area stated in the schedule. This discrepancy would arise if the schedule represents the estimated areas prior to the division, and the figures on the map are the result of actual survey. The map is probably that ofthe lord of the manor, who measured the yarious parts allotted to him and recorded the results on the map itself. 2 Cf. the history of Long Houghton, where a contemporary account of such a division will be found. 8 The conformation of the hedges probably gave rise to the division into groups of 7 and 5, instead of 6 and 6.

A grandchild, John Salkeld, is men tioned in the will. The house which was then in process of construction at Rock was afterwards called the ' Mid Hall,' and stood until 1855 on the site of the present Sunday school. It had an upper floor which could only be approached by an outside stone staircase. This building, having become unsafe, was taken down ; and, on removing a sun-dial, there was found an inscribed stone, now set up over the door of the Sunday school. This stone bears the date of John Salkeld's will, 1623, and the initials TS | | AS, doubt less those of Thomas Salkeld and his wife.6 John Salkeld, the eldest son, became eventually the sole owner of Rock, as well as of Hulne abbey. He was an ardent supporter of Charles I., and no doubt he held personal communication with the king, when he encamped with his army on Rock Moor on the 22nd May, 1639, on his way north to Berwick.7 Salkeld, by his wTife Dorothy, daughter of William Carnaby of Farnham, had a son, also named John, who was intended for the profession of the law. This son, who will be referred to subsequently as Colonel Salkeld, to distinguish him from his father, played a prominent part in the stirring events of the seventeenth century. Whilst still a young man, twenty-seven years of age, he murdered Mr. John Swinburne of Capheaton, 1 Including Rock Mill farm there are now four farmsteads outside the village and 27 houses. 2 This is clear on the original.

Langdale retired to Carlisle upon the advance of Lambert, the Parliamentarian general, but he managed to send Colonel Tempest with 800 horse to meet Colonel Grey, who had been besieged in Berwick by Major Sanderson. Grey and Tempest effected a meeting at AInwick, but on the ist of July they allowed their forces to be surprised, and many of the officers and men were taken prisoners.

[Endorsed] 'For the worshipful his worthy friend Hugh Potter, esq., att Northumberland howse neare Chareing Crosse in the Strond, London.' ' In another letter Watson refers to ' Mr. Salkeld of the Little Parke.' He was Mr. John Salkeld of Hulne Park house, a distant connection of Colonel Salkeld of Rock, but as warm a Parliamentarian as the colonel was Royalist. Watson also alludes to Warkworth castle, which had been dis mantled in order that it might not be again captured by Scots or Royalists.2 The destroyers had showm an excess of zeal. Watson writes to Potter on the 22nd of November, 1648 : Worthiest Sir, after tender of my most humble service I call to mynd my promis in my last letter to yow, being to give yow an accompt of Sir John my master3 his returne and health. I was with him last weake att Blanchland with his sister the Lady Forster,' where I found him in a meane condicion of health, with a great swelling fallen into his leggs and seate, supposeing it to be the goute, or dropsy, but as yet not satisfied wheither. He is much disabled in his going, not being able to goe without assistance ; yet sound at hart, and eare long hopes to be at Wallington ; and soe for theis parts. 1 Duke of Northumberland's MSS. * Warkworth castle seems to have been captured by the Scots in 1644.

I understand that the governer of Newe Castle with the consent of the committee, have ordered that the county common gaole shal be removed from the high castle at Newcastle, to this towne, to a place under the Toulebooth and Bondgaite tower, being the gaole for the liberty, both which are not considerable for that purpose intended : by usurpping that power to settle a gaole heare, it may sometymes trench upon his lordshipp's privilidges, and disable his officer the baliffe in th' execucion of his authority when occacion requires. The now undersheriffe was moveing me, that, if any gentlemen of qualitie were taken, I would affoard accommodacion in this castle for secureing them. I answered that power was not mine to dispose of his lordshipp's howse ; neither would I without his lordshipp's spetiall order ; and that I mervailed how any inferiour subject durst presume to thinke to make the principall howse of a peare of the realme, a gaole. Mopitt castle haith bene imployed in that service,2 and being repared is more proper then this towne. And to remove the gaole from whence it is and to add the high castle to the garrison may in time incurrage the New Castle men to thrust it into the towne charter, and soe the county by that indirect meanes quite to lose it, which wil be very prejudiciall to the same, the power and liberty it hath their considered. Sir (if yow think it soe proper) in my poore opinion it will not be amisse his lordshipp were advertized of the committee their intended designe for this towne, and the castle, and the resolucion procured to Sir Arthur Haslerigg and the committee touching the same. For be assured till I receive direccions to the contrary (which I desire as soone as may be) I shall obstruct all proceadings about the castle, come upon it what will. Anthony Adston is county clarke this yeare ; it may perhapps cause a loytering of his lordshipp's service, and beget but small good service the other way. The viccaridge of Illderton is void by the death [sic] Mr. Wilkenson late incumbent their. Itis worth 20\" by yeare, and in his lordshipp's gift. The parish desires an honest man may be presented to it. If yow soe desire and thinke it fit, and that I may be sure to find yow at Yorke, I shall make a jorney to see yow of purpose.

[Endorsed] 'Forthe worshipful his worthy freind Hugh Potter, esqre., theis.'2 In the meantime Colonel Salkeld's father, already declared a delinquent, was reduced to poverty by confiscation and heavy fines. The sequestration of his goods is referred to in a letter from Watson to Potter on the 7th of March, 1648/49, in which the writer again refers to the damage done to Warkworth castle : Worthyest sir, yours dated London, 200 Febr. 1648, came to me per poast 40 instant and severall letters there inclosed, which I have sent away as directed; Anthony Adston3 hath sent particular notice to signifie yor prefixed tyme of coming into our parts.

The committee takes noe notice of seasures that way, but have sequestred the said goods, and forced the parties delinquents to compound according to inventaryes, and will not allowe of any arrears, saying they have noe order in that behalfe. If I may bouldly declare my opinion, his honor must procure an order from the committee of seques- tracions\" above to this committee, for allowing his lordshipps arrears or repayment, if any be by them received. The Lord Gray heare, being in the like condicion, intends the same course, as his officers tell me, but that order must be as well for all arrears in the county, as theis above mencioned. And Sir Arthur Hasellrigg (the principall man heare) being now at London, must be moved for his complyance to these order. 1 See p. 136. 2 Ibid.

It was the closing act of the second civil war, which Colonel Salkeld and his friends had promoted two years before. The wretched prisoners, to the number of 6,000, were huddled together in the open air, within the gates of AInwick castle, on their way south to Durham, where they were confined in the cathedral, in which building large numbers of them died. They used the woodwork for firewood, and mutilated many of the monuments. The survivors were divided among the officers set over them, and were sold into servitude abroad.4 Worthy Sir, this is the third tyme I have write concerning the rayseing of these 20 horse chargd upon his lordshipps lands in this county and presse it extremely with hard language [sic] , some saying they will informe the lord generall of his lordshipp's remissnes in this behalfe, and that theireby his lordshipp's lands may be sequestred.

He probably discharged his duties as a magistrate with pleasure on the occasion to which the following extract refers : Oct. 21, 1664. At Rock before John Salkeld and Jo. Clarke, esqs., Thomas Busby of Alnwicke, saith that on the 12th of August, being walking in company of Henry Elder of Alnwicke, and saying: 'What can become of all the money, that was collected in the cuntrey?' The said Henry replied: ' What should become of it ? There was non to destroy it but a company of ranting fellows ; and for his majesty hee had taken up the bones of an honester man than himselfe, and in his thoughts there would be noe quietness till hee went the way his father went.' ' In the meantime Colonel Salkeld was released or escaped from prison, and crossed to Ireland, where he fought for Charles II., and afterwards for James II.2 He subsequently returned to Rock, where his restless disposition soon made itself felt. The vicar and churchwarden of Embleton wrote to the bishop of Durham in 1688 about a pew in the parish church. They said : Whereas Collonell John Salkeld, esqr., of Rock in the parishe of Emildon, having been in his Majestie's service in Ireland when others erected pues in the said parish church : and being now by reason of his great age retired frome publick employ & desirous of a convenient pue in ye said church, particularly of a place, which Mr. Hemy Wetwang, gent., of Dunston, in ye said parish, pretends to : this is to certifie whom it may concerne y* we ye minister, churchwardens, and four and twenty of ye said parish met upon ye 17th of this instant Aprill (being Tuesday in ye Easter week) and upon enquiry cannot finde y' ye said Wetwang's pue was erected by any lawfull authority, or upon his own ground ; yet conceiving ourselves not sufficiently empowered to take downe a pue once erected, do humbly refer ye whole matter to whom it may concerne.

Colonel Salkeld died on the 2nd of June, 1705, at the age of 89, and was buried in the chancel of Rock chapel, where his monument now stands.1 His daughter, Elizabeth, married Martin Fenwick,2 a native of the neighbouring parish of EUingham, and had issue a daughter, also named Elizabeth, who married Thomas Proctor, son of John Proctor of Shawdon.3 About 1695, on the occasion of the marriage, John Proctor entailed his estates of Shawdon, Shawdon Woodhouse, and Crawley upon his son, and at the same time Colonel Salkeld settled a moiety of Rock on Thomas Proctor. 1 See p. 148. 2 There is an entry in the register of St. Andrew's church, Newcastle, which refers to Martin Fenwick's brother. 'Mr. John Fenwick of Rock stabd Mr. Ferdinando Foster, esq., Parliament man for Northumberland, the twenty second day of August, 1701, betwixt The White Cross and The Thorntree. Mr. John Fenwick of Rock was hanged the 25th day of September, 1701, for stabin Mr. Ferdinando Foster,' etc. In a copy of Patten's History of the Rebellion, in the possession of Mr. C. B. P. Bosanquet, is a manuscript note : ' In the Assize week ofthe year 1701, when William Ramsay was mayor and William Boutfiower sheriffe, on the 22nd of the month of August, when the principle gentry of the county were assembled at Newcastle, John Fenwick of Rock, in the county of Northumberland, killed Ferdinand Forster, one of the members of Parliament, and youngest son of [Sir William] Forster of Bamburgh. It appeared that Fenwick had long had an inveterate enmity against Forster lelative to some family matters, and while the latter was at a late dinner or supper at the principal inn ofthe town, the Black Horse in Newgate Street, John Hall of Otterburn called Forster out. Forster returning said: \"Hall has just brought a challenge from that villain Fenwick who thirsts after my blood : I may as well meet him now,\" which he did, and the company following (by the light ofthe moon) saw Fenwick standing near the White Cross, about half-way between that and a thorn tree which grew in the said street. He drew his sword and Forster the same, but slipping his foot he fell on his back, and Fenwick stabbed him through the heart when lying on the ground. Fenwick made off, but was soon taken. He was tried, and was executed at the White Cross for the crime, on the 25th September following. During the execution all the gates of the town were shut, for fear of a rescue from the people of the north, with whom the name of Fenwick was held in great veneration. Mrs. Fenwick, wife of John Fenwick, was in court at the trial; though great with child, she threw herself at the judge's feet begging her husband's life. The judge raised her up saying, \"Madam, I am sorry for you, but it cannot be granted; we are not to have our members of Parliament murdered in our streets unnoticed.\" ' 3 The gardens at Rock were at this time celebrated. An eighteenth century poem, entitled ' Cheviot,' says : ' Rock gardens would please Epicurus' grace ; brave Salkeld's once, now gen'rous Proctor's place.' See also p. 113."], [179, "ROCK 145 Shortly afterwards John Proctor bought the remaining moiety of Rock called the 'south side,' and in 1705 procured a special Act of Parliament enabling him to bar the previous entail, and to settle the newly purchased moiety of Rock upon his son in lieu of the Shawdon property,1 which was to be sold. These transactions explain the circumstance that Thomas Proctor was livino at Rock in 1704 before Colonel Salkeld's death.2 Thomas Proctor had a large family,3 and though the Rock estate had risen in value, the improvement did not save him from falling into financial straits. In 1732 the estate was sold to Lord Jersey in a heavily mortgaged condition, being then nominally worth or a year. About twenty years after the property had changed hands, the ' old hall ' was so nearly destroyed by fire that it fell into a ruinous condition, in which state it remained for about seventy years.4 In 1794 Lord Jersey sold Rock to Mr. Peter Holford, a master in chancery, whose son, Mr. Robert Holford, transferred it in 1804 to his brother-in-law, Mr. Charles Bosanquet. Mr. Bosanquet belonged to an old Huguenot family, formerly settled at Colognac in Cevennes, the English branch of which is descended from David Bosanquet who came to England in 1686, after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. Mr. Charles Bosanquet6 was a member ofthe firm of Manning, Anderdon, & Co., merchants, London, and purchased a number of pictures after the Napoleonic wars, when many good paintings came into this country. He brought the best down to Northumberland, and amongst those at Rock are : 'Christ and St. John the Baptist, as children, playing with a lamb,' 1 Petition of John Proctor of Rock.

The practice of hoeing was also introduced at this time.'

W. Bosanquet, of which free use has been made, is printed in vol. vi. of the Proc. Berw. Nat. Club. Mr. C. B. P. Bosanquet has supplied the following particulars as to the condition of the estate during the last 150 years. The annual value of Rock is stated in Proctor's Act of Parliament to have been .\u00a3330 in 1695. Proctor claimed to have raised the value to above ,\u00a3600 in 171 5. In 1732 the estate was sold to Lord Jersey, and a map 'plotted by Thomas Williams a.d. 1743' f\u00b0r Lord Jersey shows that Rock was divided into six large and three small holdings. The map and the names on it ' Midstead Moor,' ' North Moor Furze,' and ' South Moor,' show that a great part of the estate was still unenclosed. From a rent roll of 'half year's rents' payable in 1761, the annual rental at that time appears to have been .\u00a3698, and the Taylors were the largest tenants. In 1794 Lord Jersey sold the estate for ,\u00a329,000. In the present century the rental has varied greatly. The rental was, from 1806 to 1810, ,\u00a31,256; in 1810, \u00a32,710 ios. (the estate was then greatly improved, and war prices were paid for agricultural products) ; in 1826, \u00a32,287 i\u00b0s. In 1836 Mr. Bosanquet took the 'demesne farm' into his own occupation, and other changes took place. In 1863 the gross estimated rental in the rate book (exclusive ofthe hall, etc.) was \u00a31,612; in 1873, ; in 1894, \u00a31,842."], [181, "ROCK 147 Rock Chapel. The small Norman chapel, dedicated to St. Philip and St. James,1 stands between the hall and the village. It originally consisted of a nave and chancel only. It was carefully restored in 1855 by Mr. Salvin, and the apse was then added. In 1866 the size of the building was again increased by the addition of a north aisle of three arches from designs by the late Mr. F. R. Wilson. The most conspicuous features of the original structure still remaining are the west front and the fine chancel arch. The west front has a lofty shafted doorway, decorated with rich zigzag work. The flat but tresses are shafted at the angles, and the walls are crowned with a corbel table of heads. The chancel arch is richly ornamented in two orders, the inner order being well moulded, and the outer order carved in zigzags with an enriched label. The outer order has been cut away in three places, apparently for the insertion of the rood. On the south side of the chancel there is a fourteenth-century window of three lights, the original form of which is lost except as regards its in side jamb and arch. West Door of Rock Chapel. When the north aisle was added in 1866 the stones in the ancient wall were marked and moved out, one by one. The narrow Norman win dows widely splayed on the inside, now in the north wall, may therefore be considered original.2 1 There is no evidence of an ancient dedication. 2 The Rev. John Hodgson visited Rock 26th Oct., 1825. His notes show that the chancel was then 24 feet 10 inches long, 13 feet 7 inches wide. The nave was 35 feet 4 inches long, 17 feet 4 inches wide."], [182, "148 EMBLETON PARISH. There are many ancient stones, once belonging to the building, now preserved as relics. The font is partly ancient, and there is a fine grave cover on the floor of the chancel. The cover bears a floriated cross, between a sword and an axe. Monuments, etc. On the north wall of the chancel there are five stone shields bearing the three swine of the Swinhoes, who were for a long period the owners of Rock, and one shield bearing three water bougets, 2 and I, the arms ofthe Proctors.1 On the south side of the chancel is a brass plate inscribed : 'Here lyeth interred the bodie of John Salkeld of Rock, esqr, who departed this life the ioth of November, Anno D\"! 1629.' Also on the south side of the chancel is the monument of Colonel Salkeld. At the corners of the base of the monument are two small shields bearing the Salkeld arms. In the centre is a larger shield bearing the arms of Colonel Salkeld impaling those of his wife on a bend three eagles displayed surmounted by a chief.\" At the base of the monument is the The Arms ok Swinhoe A rgent three swine passant sable. motto 'Hie sum peregrinus.'

These various occupations did not cause him to neglect his landed estate at Rock, nor to forget the interests, temporal and spiritual, of those who dwelt upon it : he completed the division of the estate into farms : he restored the church which he found in a ruinous state: rebuilt the village and repaired and added to the old mansion, which, having been destroyed Here Lies in hope of a Blessed refurrec\" : the Body of y' truly Valiant & loyal gent : Coll.

The chapelry was in early times subordinate to the rectory or vicarage of Embleton. The incumbent of Embleton was bound to maintain a chap lain at Rock, and a suitable amount of glebe (40 acres) was set apart in 133 1 for his maintenance.1 Some time before 1663, however, the glebe was lost 2 and the chapel fell into disrepair, being generally destitute of an incumbent. At length in 1767 Rock and Rennington were constituted distinct cures with separate endowments, and at the present time the vicar of Rennington holds both parishes, and does duty at Rennington and Rock alternately.* Visitations, etc. 1577-8, 29 Jan., 'Andreas Haistings, Scotus,' was curate, and had no license 1 578, 30 July, George Pattison was curate.

Pursuant to the directions of the archdeacon the necessary repairs were effected in the following spring, the walls were in great part rebuilt, the windows altogether newly formed and sashed (the character of the chapel being thereby much altered), and a new blue slate roof put on.

A large black stone laid on piers, being the monument of Mr. John Salkeld, stood in the place of and was made use of as the communion table. This was removed, and the upper part of the stone, which was broken, placed against the wall at the south side of the east window.' A letter is also extant, dated 24th May, 1806, addressed by Mr. Bosanquet to ' Mr. William Crisp, chapel warden.' Mr. Bosanquet mentions in detail the repairs needed, and says that he has obtained an estimate for them amounting to \u00a3272. He offers to contribute \u00a380 towards this, and to add \u00a3120 more, the interest to be applied to the endowment of a school. He hopes that they will thus ' remove the reproach cast upon Rock of having no place fit for divine worship, nor any means of education for the children.' 1828.

Their population is 186; their church room accommodates 120. They have been more fortunate than their brethren of Rennington, as they still enjoy Mr. Edwards's legacy, which is secured and augmented by the care and generosity of Mr. Bosanquet. The following is the account which I received from him: he obtained from Mr. Hodges, formerly vicar of Embleton, \u00a324, which he deems to be Mr. Edwards's money, and he [Mr. Bosanquet] has added as much as has purchased \u00a3240 in the 3A per cents., the yearly interest of which is paid to the schoolmaster of Rock. The schoolmaster has other advantages from Mr. Bosanquet during pleasure, amongst others the use of the old house with a dial bearing the inscription : \"Dum spectas, fugit.\" On the whole I derived much satisfaction from my visitation of this snug and improved little chapelry.'

The road going south from Rock enters the township of Rennington at a spot where a small bridge crosses the Jingling burn. In ancient times Rennington included the hamlet of Broxfield, and extended much further west in the direction of Heiferlaw, and south-west in the direction of AInwick Moor or Aydon Forest.1 In advancing south from the bridge already mentioned the road traverses what in the early part of the seventeenth 1 The township has now an area of 1,772 acres.

To the east, adjoining the burn, were the 'Water Acres,' to the west the ' Rock Burn Butts ; ' in the north west corner of the township the ' Black Riggs Pasture.' Crossing the ' Long Mary Knows,' the ' Foggy Lands,' and the ' Fenman Butts,' the road enters the village, which has changed little in general plan during the last two hundred and fifty years. On the east a row of cottages terminates at the southern extremity in the vicarage and modern church, which stands on the site of a chapel of great antiquity, pulled down about sixty years ago.1 The remainder of the village, including a substantial school-house now in process of construction, is grouped round the village green to the south west of the church. In addition to the ' North field ' there were before the enclosure two other common fields at Rennington, viz., the 'West field' and the 'South field.' The latter lay on either side of the path now known as the ' Millway Loaning,' and included the 'West Award,' the 'Middle Awards,' and the ' Easter Awards.' A tract of land called the 'Black Butts' was so called because it projected between the west and the south field.2 There appears to have been a wood of oak trees in old times to the south east ofthe church. This part was called the ' Hockwood,' a name which is now recognisable in the corrupted form of 'the Hocket.' The southern apex of the township consisted of a large moor covering almost a thousand acres, in the midst of wdiich stood a cross called 'Luck's Crosse' or 'Fallen Crosse.' In a survey of the earl of Northumberland's estate,3 it is said that 'the mannor and towne of Renington is parcell of the barony of Alnewick, scituated in Bambrough ward in a good soyle both for corne and grasse, and is distant from Alnewick toward the north-east three miles. It was some- time parcell of the inheritance of Sir William Hilton, knight, then lord of the same, and of Shilbottle and others, in the right of Bona, daughter and heyre of Jermayne Tyson great grandchilde to Gilbert Tyson, whoe was sometime lord of the whole barony.'

Alexander acknowledged that the land within these marks was the property of AInwick abbey.1 Rennington with the rest of the Hilton estates came into the hands of Alexander's grandson of the same name, who received permission from the Crown in 1335 to give an estate in Broxfield to the canons of AInwick abbey. It was stated at the time that the donor retained Rennington and other lands in his own possession.2 The township afterwards descended to William de Hilton, born about the year 1356, who was declared the heir of his father, Robert, in 1377. It is evident that he was for many years owner of the township, which he was in the habit of visiting from time to time, but his connection with the place had terminated before the 31st of July, 1414,3 when he was still living. Rennington was shortly afterwards in the hands of the Percys, and was included in a grant made by Edward IV. to Robert, Lord Ogle, of lands which had belonged to the earl of Northumberland.4 The place is not men tioned in a survey of the lands of Lord Ogle made at the time of his death, and it was therefore probably restored by some private arrangement to the Percys. The families of Hilton, Percy, and Ogle were connected by marri age at the time, Lord Ogle's daughter-in-law, Eleanor Hilton, having married George Percy, third son of Sir Ralph Percy, for her second husband.5 From the fifteenth century to the present day the township has remained the pro perty of the Percy family. The following is a translation of a rental of Rennington made in 1498 : The abbot of AInwick holds his lands in Doxfeld6 by fealty and suit of court, as is said, and pays nothing. William Aske, esquire, holds there various lands and tenements which Conan Aske formerly held and pays ijs vid.

The lan guage used would seem to imply that all the common lands had been redivided, and that the arable land had not been excepted. The surveyor contemplated a redivision at an early opportunity in order to rectify the inequalities which had arisen. The losses which the people of the place had suffered from the cattle thieves and marauders were perhaps partly due to the attitude of non resistance which they had adopted. Their inertia encouraged the spoilers to revisit the place at frequent intervals. The following table refers to 1574 : Renington. John Rycheson, Will'\" Cayer, Robt. Richeson, Rich. Ledgerd, Willm.

It should be remembered that the township had been reduced in size by various gifts since the thirteenth century, and that 166 acres of demesne land had been absorbed by the tenants. The manor court rolls, preserved at Alnwick castle, contain a few passages referring to Rennington during this period; and there are records of courts held there from the year 15 19. The men of Rennington were com pelled to keep watch with the men of South Charlton every night 'at the Gallow' in the time of Queen Elizabeth. Some of the old feudal impositions continued to be exacted at a late date. In 1652 nine men from Rennington were presented, who had neglected 'to bring in turves' to Alnwick castle. Four men were also presented who had not 'brought in thorns to repaire the hedges of the demesne.' ' Rowland Philipson and Edmund Roddam were freeholders."], [193, "RENNINGTON AND BROXFIELD. 159 The names of Blythe and Philipson will have been observed on the lists of tenants at various dates. The descendants of the Blythes are still in the village, and the Philipsons remained for a long time as copyholders. An old man who was called as a witness in a lawsuit in 1676, said that he remembered 'one Thomas Phillippson was bailiff of the manor of Rennino- ton, and after him his son was and still is bailiff.' He went on to state that 'the townships of South Charleton and Dennicke appear and do service at the courts ofthe manor of Rennington,' and that Rennington was reputed to be 'a several and distinct manor by itself, without any dependance upon any other manor.' He also stated that the tenants were bound to plough a 'yoakinge' ofthe demesne at AInwick castle, and to bring lime for repairs, and straw for the castle stables. Every tenant of Rennington was bound to give the 'foreign bailiff of AInwick 'two pecks of oats to feed the bailiff's horses.'1 The township continued to be held in common until the beginning of the eighteenth century. In 1707 the tenants, with Mr. Edward Roddam of Little Houghton and the vicar of Embleton, addressed a petition to the duke of Somerset that the common lands might be divided 'because they were lying dispersedly in and throughout the lordshipp, by reason whereof your petitioners are very much demnified and cannot make any improvement without a division.' Eventually the land was divided, some of it in 1720, and the remainder in 1762. The effect of the division was an improvement in the condition of the tenants. In a survey made in 1727 it is said that the tenants 'were very poor and scarce able to pay their rents, but since they divided their farmes, having both coal and lymestones within their grounds they have improved their tenements to be worth per annum, and some improved to Each tenement, being tenn in number, doe x plow dargs2 in all to the north demesne of Alnwicke, and bring in straw for the use of the audits, for which each plow has sixpence or a dinner.' In comparatively recent times Rennington was the home of Henry Ogle, who in conjunction with John Common of Denwick has a strong claim to be considered the inventor of the reaping machine. The machine was improved 'Edmund Roddam has been mentioned as a landowner in Rennington in 1618. His predecessor, John Roddam, had acquired land there on the 14th of February, 1520, from John Taylor of Beadnell, and this land remained in the possession of the Roddams until August, 1710. Edward Roddam, late of Little Houghton, joined with his son of the same name in conveying the land to the Rev. Thomas Nesbit of Berwick. In 1758 Nesbit devised this estate to his son, John Nesbit.

Ogle profited nothing by his ingenuity ; he was schoolmaster and parish clerk at Rennington for twenty-four years, and was in the workhouse in AInwick at the time of his death on the ioth of February, 1848.1 Rennington is now wholly the property of the duke of Northumberland, with the exception of about 65 acres of glebe land, belonging chiefly to the vicar of Embleton. The Chapel. The modern church of Rennington, dedicated to All Saints, stands upon slightly rising ground at the south-east end of the village, and is built upon the site of an ancient Norman chapel. It is fortunate that sketches are in Rennington Chapel (from the south). From a sketch by Miss Frances Pulleine (afterwards Mrs. R. W. Bosanquet), 22nd September, 1828. existence which show what the old chapel was, and there are documents which throw some light upon its history. It has been stated, in the sixteenth century survey already quoted, that ' all maner of such devine service as is to be ministered and done in churches' was done in the chapel of Rennington. 1 Tate, AInwick, ii. pp. 408-9."], [195, "RENNINGTON AND BROXFIELD. 161 This statement refers to the fact that the chaplains of Rennington in the Middle Ages claimed to be independent of the incumbents of Embleton, and to administer all the rites of the church as if they were vicars or rectors of a parish. These pretensions naturally caused some friction, and the incum bents of Embleton seem to have often tried to put a stop to the celebration of Mass at Rennington when William de Hilton was the owner of the township. All that is known about the early history of the chapel is contained in a statement which he drew up on the 31st of July, 1414, after he had ceased to be the owner of the manor. He stated that his ancestors gave certain lands in Rennington to chaplains to say Mass, long before any vicar was ordained by any bishop in that region to administer the Sacraments in the parish. It was often urged whilst he was lord of Rennington that the cele bration of Mass at the chapel should be abolished. He thereupon gave orders that the tithes and land belonging to the chapel should be appropri ated, to make it clear that any such abolition would directly contravene the wishes of his ancestors. In consequence apparently of this vigorous action no good reason for the abolition was discovered, and Mass was always celebrated whilst William de Hilton was lord of the place. He added that Sir John Kellowe, parson of Hilton, would confirm his statements. Kellowe had been receiver ofthe rents at Rennington for sixty years, and used to be entertained by the chaplain, on the occasion of his visits. He had stayed several nights with the chaplain, who was then living at Rennington for the purpose of celebrating Mass.1 But the chaplains, though they enjoyed a measure of independence, were not wholly free from the control of the vicars of Embleton, who, by a deed dated the 23rd of June, 133 1, were bound to provide a chaplain at Rennington. Forty acres of land had been at the same time expressly assigned to them in the township for the chaplain's maintenance.2 1 'Copies of diverse antient charters & instruments relating to the barony of AInwick & the members thereof, viz' : the certificate of William, baron of Hilton, touching the assignment of certain lands in Renyngton by his ancestors in perpetuity to the chaplains there, for saying Mass for the souls ofhis said ancestors in the chapel of Rennyngton.' The document itself is in French: 'donne a Hilton la darroine joure de moys de Juyll, lan nostre tressoverain seignur le roy Henry quint, etc., secound.' The chapel had been founded ' longement devaunt ceo temps que fuyst ascun vicar ordeignes eiant ministracion icy de Sacraments de mesme parochain par ordeignaunce [ou constitucon] faitz par ascun evesque diocise en ceo partie.' The controversy was revived about 1524, when two men of Rennington were asked why they had usurped ['occupied'] the seven Sacraments. The following note follows the French deed: ' M. Tyndell vicar of Emyldon haith cited Rouland Blythe and Robert Schipl', my lordes tenauntes of Rennyngton, to appere at Newcastell on Tewsday the last day of Maye, to schewe why they cause the vij Sacramentes be occupied in the chapell at Rennyngton, and as is said it hath been used ther tyme oute of mynde.'

The Norman chapel was visited by the Rev. John Hodgson, the historian, on the 26th of October, 1825. His notes and the sketches which are here reproduced show that the chapel consisted of a nave and chancel.

The chancel was lighted by one window at the east end, one window on the north side, and two on the south, and there was a piscina on the south side adjoining the altar. The nave was lighted by one window at the east end of the rebuilt north wall, and by three windows on the south side as shown in the sketch by Miss F. Pulleine, afterwards Mrs. R. W. Bosanquet. The windows represented in the sketch appear to have been modern sash windows. At the west end on the south side there was a plain square-headed Norman door. The tympanum was enclosed by a semi-circular arch richly ornamented with the zigzag moulding, and the hood-mould rested upon imposts and detached shafts. In the centre of the chapel at the west end there was a font, and a bell turret stood on the west gable. The old chapel was pulled down in the year 1831, and was replaced by a fabric in the 'stvle' of that period. The new building consisted of a nave with a large square tower at the west end. A chancel was built in 1865, and an aisle was at the same time added to the north side of the nave. The following is a list of the incumbents whose names can be ascertained : Incumbents. Circa 1180.

The small township of Broxfield, 319 acres in extent, lies about a mile to the south-west of Rennington village, and borders upon the parish of AIn wick. It was not in ancient times a separate manor, but was subordinate to Rennington, and formed part of the Hilton's estate.1 In a survey ofthe earl of Northumberland's lands made in 1727, it is stated that 'the towne of Broxfeild is a hamlett of Rennington : after the Conquest it was given by one William Hylton to one Jermain Broxfeild att the request of Ivon Vescy, then lord of Alnwicke, and after descended to one Robert Soopeth, cousin and heire to the said Jermaine Broxfeild. The north syde of the towne is of the parish of Embleton, and the south syde of Alnwricke.' Jermaine, who is here stated to have been the recipient of Broxfield, appears to have belonged to a family named Rybaud, especially connected with the parish of Howick.

The part of Broxfield which Adam Rybaud held became the property of his son William, by whom it was retained until 1334. In that year Alexander de Hilton gave to the abbot and convent of AInwick the whole of the arable land and meadow which he had in the hamlet of Broxfield 'in respect of the villeinage of the heirs of William de Broxfield, at one time the property of Adam, son of Hugh Rybaud.' At the same time Alexander also gave to the abbey all the land in the same hamlet which John Tebbe had at one time held, with pas ture for two beasts used in husbandry, six oxen, and two hundred sheep.2 This gift to AInwick abbey is referred to in the survey of Rennington made in 1586, where it is described as the part adjoining Heckley Moor. The portion allotted to the abbey was equivalent to one-half of the town ship.3 The canons of AInwick would naturally exercise ecclesiastial jurisdic tion over the newly acquired territory which adjoined their parish, and the year 1334 may therefore be fixed as the date of the division of the township. From that time the north of Broxfield remained part of Embleton parish, whilst the southern half became a part of the parish of AInwick.4 The southern half was the inheritance of the heirs of Adam de Broxfield ; the northern moiety descended to the heir of Jermaine de Broxfield, namely, his cousin, Robert Soopeth. The latter was also a benefactor to the abbey, and gave to the canons a piece of ground called Broxshall.6 The remainder of the estate of Robert Soopeth appears to have come eventually into the hands of trustees, by whom it was conveyed on the 17th 1 Inq. 17 Ed.

The township of Craster, in its older spelling 'Craucestre,' is situated on the coast at the south-eastern extremity of the parish of Embleton. The name of the place is probably derived from a camp upon Craster Heugh, about one-third of a mile south-west of the village, and a quarter of a mile east of Craster tower. The camp is an irregular entrenchment, naturally protected on the north and west by the steep sides of the heugh, and artifici ally defended on the east and south sides by twTo parallel ramparts. The ramparts, composed of earth and rough unhewn stones, may still be clearly traced to the north of a stone wall wmich now intersects the camp. To the south of this wall the outer rampart has been ploughed down, but the inner one remains.4 The camp is 215 feet long and 102 feet wide from the edge of the heugh to the inner rampart at the southern end. At the northern end it is 92 feet in wTidth to the corner of the outer rampart. At the south-east corner of the camp a gap in the entrenchment has been made in recent times. The heugh on which the camp is placed is a high and undulating ridge of whinstone, which begins at Scrog Hill in the neighbouring township of Dunstan, and running southwards parallel to the coast terminates in the bay of Swine Den, two-thirds of a mile to the south of Craster village.6 From the ''Noverint, etc., nos Johannem Swynhowe de Rok, armigerum, Johannem Harbotell de Preston, generosum, Robertum Hoppyn de Hoppyn, generosum, et Henricum Wetwange de Newton super mare, generosum, remisisse Thome Ilderton de Ilderton totum jus, etc., in terris et tenementis nostris de Broxfeld, etc., juxta Alnewyk.

The rocky coast-line is formed of the sloping beds of black and glossy whin, polished and scoured by the sea. To the north-east is the village of Craster, standing upon the shore where an inden tation in the rock forms a natural haven for the cobles of the fishermen. Two limestone islets, the Little Carr to the north and the Muckle Carr to the south, act as a natural breakwater, and render the haven a N safe anchorage except in very boisterous weather. A small stream which finds its way through a gap in the heugh, divides the village into two parts, known as the 'north side' and 'south side.'

The similarity of their names (and it would be hard to find a Craster man who is not an Archbold or a Simpson) shows that the inhabitants of Craster, as of other fishing villages along the coast of Northumberland, are a colony apart.

The original tower, now only a small part of a modern dwelling house, was built before the year 141 5. It is mentioned as the property of Edmund Craster in the list of fortresses compiled at that time.1 It is built of excellent masonry, and is rectangular in plan, measuring externally 35 feet from north to south, by 29 feet 2 inches from east to west. The entrance, now approached from the offices of the hall, is in the east wall near the south end. There is an outer doorway, and an inner one which opens into the vaulted basement. In the passage between these doors, on the left in enter ing, is the door of the wheel-stair that went up in the wall, here 6 feet 5 inches thick, near the south-east angle of the tower. None of the steps of this stair are visible, and the drum has been closed in with a brick dome ; but above this it is believed that much of the stair remains, and its opening out would add considerably to the interest of the building by again disclosing the original entrances to the upper floors. The three doors mentioned are all of the same late fourteenth century character, having heads only slightly pointed and formed of two stones. The basement is 27 feet 7 inches long by 16 feet 5 inches broad ; the vault, composed of narrow ashlars, is somewhat flat, the centre ofthe arch being 10 feet from the ground.

The elder of these sons, William, inherited Craster, whilst his brother Yvo received from his uncle, William de Argenton, lands at Redcar in Yorkshire. Through his wife, Emma, Yvo was the father of a family which discarded the territorial name of Craster, and assumed the name of Redcar in its place.3 Much light is thrown upon the early pedigree of the Crasters through the evidence given in a legal action promoted by William de Craster's grand son, Richard, in the year 1292. In that year Richard de Craster claimed a certain serf, by name William son of Robert son of Stephen, who was born at Newton-by-the-sea. Richard de Craster alleged that William was a fugitive, and had fled from Richard's land shortly after the coronation of Henry III. William denied that he was a serf, and Richard de Craster in support of his claim alleged that his own ancestor, Albert, possessed a certain serf named Egardus, William's ancestor, in the reign of Richard I.

In order to prove that Egardus was a serf by birth, it was stated that Albert de Craster received from Egardus merchetttm carnis et sanguinis, that is to say, a payment made by a serf for a license to give his daughter in marriage ; and further that Albert de Craster taxed Egardus on his own authority and at his discretion.4 Richard de Craster stated that the posses- 1 See pp. 10, 13, note. - Black Book ofthe Exchequer, fol. 73 b, Northumberland.

Richard de Craster also stated that Egardus had two sons, Adam and Stephen, who had been the serfs of John de Craster, the claimant's father, in the reign of King John. Stephen had a son Robert, who had been a serf of Richard de Craster in the reign of Henry III., and was the father of two sons, William, the defendant in the suit, and Richard. In support of his allegations Richard de Craster produced a certain William son of Odulph (a second cousin of the defendant William, son of Robert), and also Richard, brother of the defendant, who both acknowledged that they were his serfs. William, notwithstanding the confession ofhis brother, denied that he was in any way a serf, and he also asserted that his grandfather, Stephen, was neither the son of Egardus nor the serf of any ancestor of Richard de Craster. The defendant, according to his own statement, was a free man and of free birth, originally living at Acklington, outside the lands of the ancestors of Richard de Craster. From Acklington Stephen went to Craster to the land of Richard de Craster's ancestors, and there married Asa, daughter of John son of Egardus. The defendant alleged that his brother Richard was there fore a free man, and that he might have been of free condition, had it not been for his foolish confession of serfdom.1 After this statement Richard son of Robert was again called and contradicted the defendant's statement. He deposed that Stephen was son of Egardus, born in lawful wedlock, and was the serf of Richard de Craster's ancestor, as he had previously stated. Eventually William paid half a mark for leave to make an agreement, and Richard de Craster acknowledged William to be a free man with all his family, renouncing all claim to serfdom,2 and giving to William a written acknowledgment to this effect.3 It is evident that Richard de Craster, like many other genealogists, was no. infallible, but the testimony which he gave with reference to his own pedigree was unquestioned, and may be accepted as a correct statement of the descent of the first five generations of the Craster family. Richard's father, John de Craster, was a joint owner of land in Dunstan wTith Reyner de Dunstan in the year 1245. The customs and services which 1 ' Stulta ejus recognition 2 ' Actionem nativitatis.' ' Assize Roll, 21 Edw. I. ' De native'"], [205, "CRASTER. 171 Reyner de Dunstan and John de Craster rendered to the owner of the barony of Embleton were estimated to be worth nine shillings and sixpence yearly.1 Ten years later John de Craster was acting as a juror for the country north of the Coquet,2 and is mentioned amongst those persons whose services were transferred by Hereward de Marisco and his wife Rametta, to Simon de Montfort in the year 1256. According to a family tradition John de Craster was killed at Evesham in 1265, and it is not improbable that he fell by the side of his lord to whom he owed military service. However this may be, Richard de Craster, the unsuccessful claimant in the suit already mentioned, succeeded his father in the possession of Craster before the close of the reign of Henry III., and the serf, Robert son of Stephen, rendered his services to Richard de Craster during the reign of that king. In 1278 in common with other men of similar degree Richard was called upon to provide sureties that he would take the degree of knighthood. The sureties which he provided were Richard de Wetwang, Alexander de Broxfield, Michael de Rock, and John de Kertingdon.3 The compiler of the family pedigree presents a perverted view of the affair when he states that Richard de Craster was 'knighted bv Edward I. for his services in the Scottish wars.' In a survey ofthe barony of Embleton, made in the year 1296, Richard de Craster is mentioned as holding the hamlet of Craster for half a knight's fee. He did homage and suit of court, paying 6s. 8d. for castle-guard, is. 3d. for cornage, and 2s. 6d. for an old mill pond. He was bound to plough with six ploughs, to harrow with twelve horses, to reap corn with twelve men, and to lead corn with twelve carts for one day. The men w^ere provided with food by the lord of the barony of Embleton at the rate of twopence for every plough, and the lord of the barony might either exact the work itself or take five shillings in commutation as he pleased.4 The manor was esti mated to be worth 12s. 4d. in ordinary years, a sum which agrees approximately with the gross rateable value of the township as assessed for the payment of subsidy in the same year. 1 ' In Dunstan consuetudines et servitia hominum Reyner de Dunstan et Johannis de Craucestr', que debebuntur capitali domino, valent per annum ix8 vi'1.

It is certain, however, that the head of the family bore the name Edmund for several generations in succession. In 1352 Edmund de Craster, knight, w7as an owner of land in the township of Newton by-the-sea, for which he rendered certain customary services to Thomas de St. Maur,4 and in 141 5 the tower at Craster is stated to have been the pro perty of Edmund Craster,5 who may have been his son or grandson. The latter may be identified with that Edmund who paid a subsidy in 1427, when he held a quarter of a knight's fee in Craster.6 Richard de Craster, a contemporary of Edmund, seems to have been a member of a younger branch of the family. He married Emma, the reputed daughter of Walter de Tynedale, and some remarkable evidence as to the circumstances attending his wife's birth is preserved in the Treasury at Dur ham.7 Richard de Craster, by virtue of his marriage, was temporarily lord of the manor of Dilston, and possessor of land at Corbridge. On the 12th of September, 141 6, when Richard de Craster died, this property passed to Sir William de Claxton, his wife's cousin. It is recorded that Richard de Craster did not possess any land in Northumberland at the time of his death.8 1 Account of William son of Reginald, bailiff\" of Embleton for the year 1313. 2 They were Edmund de Craster who paid ios., Edmund son of Alice, who paid 2s., and Richard Everard who paid is. 3 Rotuli Scotie, vol. i. p. 701 a.

John de Craster and Lionel de Craster, with Thomas Grey de Bamburgh, were men-at-arms in the retinue of Sir John Grey at the battle of Agincourt.1 Edmund Craster, assessed for his property at Craster in 1427, appears to have been still living twenty years later, when he is mentioned as a house holder in Bamburgh,2 and in 146 1 a man of the same name, perhaps his son, held a cottage at Embleton called 'Peyntows' by copy of Court Roll.3 The latter may be identified with that Edmund Craster, who, in conjunction with Richard Craster, probably his brother, received a grant of the confiscated estates of John Beaumont at North Charlton. The grant was made by Edward IV. on the 26th of November, 1465, in grateful recognition of the services which Edmund and Richard had rendered to him.4 King Edward had granted to Richard Craster the office of bailiff of Bamburgh four years before ;5 and it may therefore be presumed that the two men had been con spicuous for their activity in the Yorkist cause, whilst the castle of Dunstan burgh was being besieged.6 There is no evidence to show the date of the death of Edmund Craster, the recipient of North Charlton, and it is doubtful whether he should be identified with the man of the same name, who was appointed by Henry VII. on the Sth of July, 1489, to be constable of Dunstanburgh castle at a salary of 20 marks a year/ Edmund Craster, the constable of Dunstanburgh, continued to discharge the duties of that office in the year 1506,8 and on the 31st of July, 1509, he 1 'History ofthe battle of Agincourt,' by Sir Harris Nicolas, 1832, p. 347, where the name is spelled 'Chester,' a common misspelling of 'Craster.' It is not impossible that Craucestre was pronounced Crauchester, and that the misspelling arose in that way. 2 See vol. i. p. 130, note. In 1443 he was lessee of the demesne land at Embleton, being described as 'of Durham.'

Unfor- tunately the Bucks do not quote any authority. Richard Craster was also appointed by Edward IV. to be 'archiferrarius' or bow-bearer in the forest of Danby in Yorkshire, on the 27th of March, 1470. (See Guis- brough Cartulary, Surt. Soc. p. 105, n. 2; where it is suggested that 'archiferrarius' means 'ironmaster.') Rot. Pat. 10 Edw. IV. m. 12. Another member of the family, William Craster, was settled in Yorkshire at the same time, in the capacity of bailiff of the village of Sinnington.

The elder son, George, became the owner of Craster tower, for which he paid a fee-farm rent to Tynemouth priory.4 He died on the 6th of March, 1546, leaving a young son, Edmund, four years of age. It is stated in an inquisition that George Craster made a will in the English language,5 and a copy of this document is still preserved at Craster. It runs as follows : In the name of God, Amen. In the year of our Lord God M.CCCCC et xliiii the x'1' day of April, I, George Crawster of Crawster, hale in my remembrance and in my body, maketh this my last will and testa ment in forme as followithe. First, my soul I give unto Almighty God, our Lady St. Mary and unto all the saints of heaven, my body to be buried in the parish church of Emildon with my duties due to my curate accustomed and according to the king's actis. Also I give to the church of Emildon, to be prayed for, vs viiid and iiii serzes.\" Also I give iiii pound to a priest to sing a year for me and all Christian souls. Also I give to everyone of my servants 6\". Also I give all my lands and goods, moveable and immove able, to Eleanor my wife, and to Edmund my son (my debts and legacies paid) whom I make my executors, to dispose for the health of my soul. Also I will that Eleanor my wife, have the ordering of my son's lands so long as she is a widow, and, if she marry, then John Forster, Thomas Forster, and Thomas Crawster they jointly to have the ordering of him with his lands and goods, failing them my Lady Forster to have him. Also I give my child that my wife is withall, if it be a man child, the farm hold that Henry hath in Emildon, and, if it be a maid child, I will that she shall have three score pounds of the rent of my lands to her upbringing and to her marriage.

Eleanor Craster, the testator's wife, a younger daughter of Sir Thomas Forster of Adderstone,8 shortly afterwards gave birth to the 'maid child' for which provision was made in this will, and the two young children, Edmund and Eleanor, were both brought up under their mother's care. The daughter 1 Deed of entail, Craster MSS. 2 See p. 92. Inq. p.m. Craster MSS. By an inquisition held on June 5th, 1 51 1, it was found that Edmund Craster had held Craster in fee, and that it was worth \u00a314 a year, with certain lands on lease from the duchy of Lan- caster, viz., lands in Embleton and Dunstan and half the township of Warenton. In the inquisition it is stated that the heir was 5 years of age ; probably 5 is a mistake for 50. 4 ' Crawcetor : George Crawcetor, the possessor there, answers for x\" and one pound of pepper, for the fee farm of the tower of Crawcetor, which he held of the late priory.'

Edmund Craster discharged his delicate task of arbitrator with so much tact and judgment that he was able to announce on the 29th of August, 1588, that the hostile families had agreed to be 'lovers and friends as they ought to be.'1 Edmund Craster married Alice, a daughter of Christopher Mitford, an alderman of Newcastle, and was the father of a numerous family. By his will, dated the 7th of November, 1594, he left his 'lordship of Craister' and all his lands in Northumberland to his son John. He devised his lands at 'Barton in Richmondshire ' to his wife for life, with remainder to his younger sons, Edmund and Thomas, to whom he bequeathed '^60 for their portions.' To his two eldest married daughters he gave \u00a310 each, and to his five younger daughters 100 marks. He also left to his 'schoolmaster Sir Thomas xs,' and to his sons 'John Craister and Henrie Collingwood, each, one old ryall.'2 Alice Craster survived her husband for two years, and is described in her will, dated 23rd September, 1597, as 'Alice Craister, widow, of Dun stanburgh.' Amongst various bequests she left to 'my sonne John one ryall, to my sonnes Edmond and Thomas a pece, to my mother one ryall, to my son-in-law Henry Collingwood one silver salte with sixe silver spoones; to my daughter, Isabell Ogle, xx marks to buy hir a gowne, petticote and fore-kirtle which I did promise hir.'3 Two of Edmund Craster's grandsons became distinguished military officers, and served at home and abroad in the wars of the seventeenth cen tury. One of them, John Craster, became a colonel in the service of Gustavus Adolphus, and was killed at Lutzen in 1632. His brother, William, was governor of Morpeth castle during the Civil War. Other members of the family, however, possessing fewer talents or opportunities, fell into humble circumstances. One of them appears to have left Northumberland in order to live at Carlisle, where his widow made her will in 1648. 1 This interesting award has been frequently printed. See Fonblanque, A nnals of the House of Percy, ii. p. 385 ; Collins, Peerage, 5th ed. ii. p. 421 ; Bates, Border Holds, p. 303, etc. One curious fact in connec- tion with the affair has however escaped notice, namely, that Richard Storey had murdered Jasper Craster, a great uncle ofthe arbitrator. In 1523 Robert Carr, bailiff of AInwick, rendered account of 20s. the value ofa horse which he had seized in the year 1521 from the goods of the fugitive felon Richard Storey, who had fled on account of the death of Jasper Craster, the earl of Northumberland's servant. Carr claimed the money for his fee as coroner at the inquest held after Jasper Craster's death. Bishop Percy's Papers, c. iii. No. 56, p. 22. 2 The will was proved on the 17th of July, 1595.

Edmund Craster, their eldest son, was sheriff of Northumberland in 1683. It was probably a younger son of Edmund Craster who had the misfortune to kill one of the Forsters in a duel in the garden at Craster. The only evidence of this affray is contained in the brief deposition of a witness, now deposited in York castle : 8 March, 1679/80. At Craister ; Ellioner Gilchrist saith that upon Thursday last, betwixt 3 and 4 a'cloke afternoone, she, being in Esq. Craister's garden, and there she heard a noyse. Therupon she went to the top of the garden wall to se what made the noyse. There she saw Mr Edward Forster lyinge, and she also saw on Mr Tho. Craister walking from him, and she see two swords drawen lying besides Mr Ed. Forster's drawen. Then she called unto Mr Craister, saying, ' What have yow donn to Mr Forster?' but she heard no answere.4 John, eldest son of Edmund Craster the sheriff, was educated at Merton college, to which the living of his native parish of Embleton belonged. Upon the death of his grandson George, in 1772, the estate reverted to a collateral branch, namely, to Daniel Craster of Embleton, a nephew of Edmund Craster the sheriff. In this way Craster tower became the property of Daniel Craster's grandson, Shafto Craster of Craster, the last representative of the family in the male line so far as is known. He died on the 7th of May, 1837, aged 82, without male issue, and the Craster estate then devolved on his nephew, Thomas Wood. The latter had a grant of arms on the 2nd of May, 1838, and on the 22nd ofthe same month he received the royal license to use the surname of Craster in addition to that of Wood. His eldest son, Mr. John Craster of Craster, is the great grandson of Thomas Wood of Beadnell by his marriage with Anne, daughter of John Craster of Craster, and the grandson of John Wood of Beadnell by his marriage with Anne, daughter of Daniel Craster, the Craster heiress. Mr. John Craster therefore represents the direct line of this very ancient family through two channels.5 1 ' Commother, a godmother. The term was also used in addressing an aged woman.'

George Craster is represented as a captain in the Grenadier Guards in a red coat with green facings and a black cocked hat. His wife is in a blue dress and holds a squirrel. George Craster drew up the following petition, apparently for a title, for presentation to George III. : 'Petition of George Craster . . . your petitioner's family from whom he received his existence and his fortune have been usefully employed in the service of their king and country ever since the time of King Henry the first, and your petitioner hoping to imitate their industry and virtues earnestly wishes to add to their glory and to obtain the testimony of your majesty's approbation of their good conduct by the honour bestowed on their name,' etc. 9 14th April, 17:5, will of William Craster of Rock Moor house, gent., 'to my brother Daniel Craster 20\", to my brother John 20s, my brother Edmund /20, etc. ; to my wife Susanna all my estate and my lease of Rock Moor house under Thomas Procter of Rock, esq.'

A picture of himself and his wife Anne, with their children John, Daniel, Edmund, and Elizabeth, is at Craster tower in the dining room. 11 The portrait of Shafto Craster, painted when he was 82 years osage, is at Craster tower. He is represented wc.uing a buff waistcoat. There are also portraits of his sisters, Barbara, Anne (who married John Wood of Beadnell) 'aged 21, died 1832. aged 75 years,' and Mary (who lived at Annstead) ' 1771, died 1846, aged 91. Sykes delini1.' The last mentioned is a very graceful portrait. Shafto Craster is still well remembered by old people in the district. In reading the pedigree it will be observed that Edmund Craster, baptised 25th Feb., 1695, became an apprentice of the Barber Surgeons' Company, and resided in Newcastle. It is very probable, though no proof can yet be pro duced, that Mr. John Craster of Penicuik, Midlothian, is a representative of this branch of the family in the male line, and it has always been a tradition amongst his predecessors that they represented the ancient stock of Craster of Craster. Mr. John Craster of Penicuik has in his possession a ' Breeches ' Bible, printed at London in 1576. On a blank leaf before the Psalms is this note: 'This booke was gyven to the alderman of Stamford, 25 Maii, 1 577> 19 Elizabeth, by Robt. Johnson, bacheler of devynyty, parson of North Luffenham in Rutland, who was sone to Morice Johnson, some time one of the aldermen of this towne, and it is ment that it shal be from yeare to yeare delyvered over to the new alderman at his admission and entrance into his office.' The village of North Luffenham is about 6J miles south west of Stamford. At the end, on the inside of the cover, is the note ' Edward Christer his Bible. This Bible was given by my grandmother the 21 of September 1746.' The name of Edward Craster's grand mother seems to have been Margaret Whorledge, and there is a note on the fly-leaf, ' Edward Whorledge his book 1752,' and another note states that the volume was ' John Christer his Bibel : this Bibel was given by my grandfather April 23, I795-' The following pedigree is compiled from entries in the Bible and other sources : Edward Craster == Edward Cras- John Craster, born = Hannah Fen- William Craster, Margaret Craster, Ann, born ter, born 24th Dec, 1747 ; wick, mar. at born 25th Nov, born 7th March, l8thNov., 12th Sept, baptised at St. St. Nicholas, 1750; married 1753 [? buried 1760. 1745.

Dunstan is a manor and township situated on the sea coast between Embleton on the north, and Craster on the south.1 An ancient bridle path leads from the group of fishermen's houses known as 'Craster North Side ' along the sea coast to the walls of Dunstanburgh. No one who traverses this grass-grown path can be unmoved by the solitude of the scene and the stupendous grandeur of the ruined castle, rising with majesty above the sea, which beats against the base of the crags on which it stands. But before entering the fortress it will be well to describe the township of which it forms so conspicuous a feature. The hamlet of Dunstan adjoins the garden of Craster tower, and consists of a few cottages scattered round a small village green. To the east a whinstone ridge, a continuation of the Craster heughs, 1 The township has an area of 1,731 acres. The following are the Census Returns : 1801, 177 ; 1811, 209; 1821,213; 1831,185; 1841,218; 1851,256; 1861,303; 1871,312; 1881,221; i89i,'_244."], [218, "1 84 EMBLETON PARISH enters the township at the spot called 'Norwell Brow,' and running north for the distance of a mile terminates at Scrog Hill. On its western side the heugh rises abruptly to a height of 40 or 50 feet, and, sloping gently east ward, forms the black planes of whinstone, which here, as at Craster, constitute the sea beach. The continuity of this lofty ridge is broken in two places where small paths, called the Big and Little Shaird, give access to the sea. Beyond Dunstanburgh the bridle-path passes over the short wiry grass of the links near Dunstan Stead and, skirting the sands of Embleton Bay, reaches the northern boundary of the township where the Embleton burn falls into the sea. Dunstan Stead is one of the four chief farms. The other three are Dunstan Hill near the boundary of Stamford, Dunstan Square, and Proctor's Stead formerly known as Dunstan Hall.1 The last-mentioned building is most interesting and picturesque, and is best described by the illustration. The view was taken from the west in the late summer, when the red tiles of the roof rose above the thickly laden branches \"of the apple trees, standing in a garden gay with old-fashioned flowers. The building has undergone so many vicissitudes, that it is difficult to form a positive opinion as to its original ground plan or the date of its foundation. There appear to have been two distinct towers, both of which are still faced in parts with earlv fourteenth-century ashlar. They may have been originally connected with each other, but the masonry which now unites them is of a much later date than that of the tow7ers themselves. The eastern and larger tower (which is not visible in the illustration) faces the road from Embleton to Craster. Its eastern wall, containing two small lancet slits, has been cut down to form the gable of the seventeenth-century residence of the Proctors. That this has taken place is shown by a fire-place, 3 feet wide with a large stone head and plain chamfered jambs, which still remains immediately under the eaves of the south corner of the eastern gable. The floor of the garret, 23 feet 1 1 inches long, in which the fire-place is situated, has been so much raised that little of the fire-place is visible, and a portion of the rough doorway in the north-east corner is obscured. This door is one of a vertical series broken through the wall in order to com municate wath a late extension of the building to the east. The eastern tower of Proctor's Stead does not appear to have extended beyond the 1 See p. 190."], [219, "I^ROCTOR STEADS."], [220, ""], [221, "DUNSTAN. 185 massive wall containing the chimneys at the west end of the garret already mentioned. At the end of the sixteenth or beginning of the seventeenth century a gabled building appears to have been added in the angle formed by the west wall of the eastern tower and the north wall of the western one. A further projection, also gabled, was thrown out to the north to contain a square stone stair, placed in such a position as to give access both to the rooms in the eastern tower and to the Elizabethan addition to the west of it. The greater part of the south wall of the eastern tower appears to have been pulled down in 1669, to judge by the date over the doorway in the west end of it. This would be the easiest way to insert the numerous sash windows with the moulded heads and jambs of that period which it now contains. The present windows of the same character, probably inserted at that time, replaced the Elizabethan windows on the basement and first floor of the west gable of the house. The western tower is of very small dimensions at the ground level, measuring externally 17 feet 10 inches from east to west, 15 feet from north to south, and internally 10 feet 9 inches by 9 feet 9 inches respectively. The low^er portion of it, faced with whinstone, looks more modern than the upper part, which is faced with fourteenth-century ashlar. It is possible that the lower portion has been stripped of ashlar, and subsequently refaced with rubble, as in the case of the curtain walls at Warkworth and Etal. The second floor of the western tower has been cut down into a to-fall, and pre sents therefore the curious appearance visible in the illustration. The original height is fortunately marked by a piece of the string-course of the battlement at its north-east corner which still exists. The original open ings of this tower appear to have been very small square holes, and a series of doors have been pierced in the east wall near the angle formed with the eastern tower. The uppermost opening may have been a window and not a door. Externally two rough whinstone corbels, projecting beneath, give it the appearance of a latrine. These stones, whatever purpose they may have served, were probably late insertions. The manor of Dunstan was included in the grant of the barony of Embleton to John son of Odard,1 who allotted portions of it to various free tenants. In the early years of the reign of Henry III. these portions were See p. 14 Vol. II. 24"], [222, "186 EMBLETON PARISH. in the hands of Reyner de Dunstan, who held a quarter of the manor j1 of Robert, son of William, who held 24 acres ; and of William de Latymer, who held 100 acres by nominal services.2 In a survey made in 1249 it is stated that there were seven bondage tenants on the manor ; the estate of one hundred acres which had previously belonged to William de Latymer had passed into the hands of Ralph de Musgrave ; Reyner de Dunstan continued to hold a quarter of the manor, and John de Craster held a few acres by customary service.3 Seven years later, when Rametta la Vescuntesse transferred the barony of Embleton to Simon de Montfort, she specially mentioned the services due from Reyner de Dun stan as a portion of the proceeds of the barony.4 In 1269 Edmund, earl of Lancaster, having succeeded Simon de Mont fort as lord of Embleton, purchased several small parcels of land in Dunstan. He bought five tofts in the east part of Dunstan from Roger de Musgrave, son of Ralph de Musgrave/' He also bought from the same man three tofts in the north of Dunstan which William 'dietus Wyse' had held,6 and the land called Musecrofte with the meadow appertaining to it, except the three acres which Roger de Musgrave had given to Richard de Wet wang.7 By another deed Roger de Musgrave gave to Gilbert de Withill thirty -four acres of arable land in the tillage called Musecrofte.8 This piece of arable land probably lay between Spittleford and the Embleton tile works, as the name Musecrofte may still be recognised at that spot in the ' Mosscrop plantation.'9 Reyner de Dunstan died before the year 1296, when a subsidy was levied on the inhabitants of the township. Richard de Wetwang, whose name heads the list, had acquired his land from the Musgraves, and the family to which he belonged was settled in Dunstan for many centuries afterwards. 1 He appears to have been the son either of Ernulf or Aelard ; see p. 13, note 1, and p. 14. \u2022 Testa de Nevill; Hodgson, Northd.

Gunora, whose name appears on this list, was probably the widow of Reyner de Dunstan and guardian of his son Michael, who shortly afterwards succeeded to the property. In 1298 Dunstan was again surveyed. At that time there were only 60 acres and half a rood of arable in demesne, and two bondage tenants holding 24 acres each. Six acres of arable which had belonged to Adam Scot were worth three shillings, and the chief tenants were Richard de Wetwang and Michael son of Reyner. The former held 80 acres of land, and the latter held a third of Dunstan for which he was bound to render various services to the lord ofthe barony. He had to plough writh three ploughs, and to harrow7 with six horses, to reap with six men, and to lead corn with six carts. The men engaged in this work were supplied with food by the lord ofthe barony, at the rate of twopence for every ploughman or reaper. The services might be exacted at any time, but if not actually rendered a sum of 2s. 6d. was pay able in commutation. The township was estimated to be worth \u00a36 16s. o^d. usually, but having been recently burnt by the Scots was only worth \u00a3$ 6s. 8fd. at the time ofthe survey.1 A small holding is mentioned in this survey which had belonged to a man called Scot, and had reverted to the lord of the barony. The circumstance deserves special notice, as it is explicitly stated in one of the works of Duns Scotus, the celebrated thirteenth-century schoolman, that he was born at Dunstan in the parish of Embleton.2 On the other hand Dempster published a quarto volume, the main object of which was to prove by twelve distinct arguments that Duns Scotus was a native of Scotland. Without examining these arguments it may be observed that had one of them been conclusive, the remaining eleven would have been superfluous. The birth place of the great schoolman will probably never be ascertained with certainty, but it may be urged in favour of Dunstan that Duns Scotus was a 1 Inq. p.m. 25 Ed. I.

The founder of the Northumberland branch of the Wetwangs probably came to Dunstan after Earl Edmund of Lancaster became owner of the barony of Embleton. Many of the officials of the earldom of Lancaster were natives of Yorkshire, where the earls possessed large estates. Four years after Richard de Wet wang had acquired his mother's property he gave to his son of the same name the messuage which he had formerly held from Thomas, son of Michael and grandson of Reyner de Dunstan. The recipient of the gift promised to pay nineteen silver pennies to the lord of the barony of Embleton.3 Thomas the grandson of Reyner, and his brother Robert, were two of the three persons who paid subsidy at Dunstan in 1336.4 It is evident that the Wetwangs were gradually consolidating and aug menting their estate during the early years of the fourteenth century,5 and it is probable that the tw7o towers of Proctor's Stead were built by a member of this family. It was ascertained by an enquiry held at Newton-by-the-sea on the 22nd of April, 1359, that one quarter of Dunstan belonged to Richard de Wetwang at that time.6 1 Dunstan afterwards produced another worthy, namely, Captain John Wetwang (see p. 191). They are both mentioned in the poem called 'Cheviot,' published in Newcastle in 1817 from a MS. written by ' R. W.,' and composed at the time ofthe rebellion in 171 5. On p. 8 is this passage : ' On Dunstanburgh we cast our wand'ring eyes, Nigh this was John the subtle doctor born, The glory ofhis age, of ours the scorn, We love the rose, they doated on the thorn : He by the angelic men was fear'd as much As Captain John his townsman by the Dutch A book of logic was more dreaded far In those days than in these a man of war.' 2 'Omnibus, etc., Justa, uxor quondam Ricardi de Wetwang, salutem.

It is strange that no mention is made of the substantial towers at Dunstan in the list compiled in 14 15, although the small towers of the vicar of Embleton and Edmund Craster in the immediate neighbourhood are recorded. Very shortly after this list was made one of the Wetwangs was appointed to the important post of receiver of the lordship of Dunstanburgh,1 and at the same period a branch of the family was rising to prominence in municipal affairs at Newcastle, where the name of Wetwang was well known at a comparatively recent date.2 The main line of the family remained, however, at Dunstan, wrhere Edward Wetwang in 1440 was appointed constable of the township.3 It is possible that he was the father of that Henry Wetwang, who stands at the head ofthe pedigree made by the herald in 161 5. Henry Wetwang married Anne, daughter of John Clavering of Callaley, by whom he had a son of the same name, a freeholder in Dunstan from 1521 to 1 53 1 .'* Robert Wetwang, son of the last mentioned Henry, was a freeholder at Dunstan in 1598, being then described as of 'Dunstan hall,' the building now known as Proctor's Stead. His property descended to his son Richard, whose name frequently occurs on the manor rolls. In 1598 Richard Wet wang was presented 'for takeing a stooke of wheate of the land of Ellen Swynow, and setting the same on his owen land.' Again in 1603 he was fined 6s. 8d. for 'takeing in of an under tenaunte into the whole howTse at Dunstan,' whence it appears that no provision was made by the manorial system for a sub-tenant paying an annual rent to a freeholder or copyholder. Richard Wetwang died before 1628, leaving a son William, who was assessed as a freeholder at Dunstan for the five subsidies granted to Charles I. in 1628.5 1 Duchy of Lancaster, class ii.

In Spearman's MSS. is a note: 'Wetwang, a very old Northumberland family ; one of them proprietor of the Weigh house, Newcastle.

Their estate had never been large, and had been gradually diminishing.4 It is not surprising there fore that Henry Wetwang sold the family property in 1692 to Alexander Browne of Doxford for _^~i,8oo.5 Two years after the transfer was com pleted, an entry occurs on the rolls of the Embleton manor court, which shows that the jury 'did amerce Alexander Browne, who bought and pur chased lands of Henry Wetwang, gent., scituate in Dunstan within the jurisdicion of this mannour, for refusing to admitt himselfe to bee ent'red in the rolls of this court, according to the custome ofthe mannour, \u00a31 19s. nd.' Browme did not probably intend to retain his newly acquired land, and on the 26th of June, 1705, he found an opportunity of exchanging his estate at Dunstan amongst other property with John Proctor for the manors of Shaw don and Crawley. 1 William Wetwang was still living in 165 1, when he conveyed certain lands in Newton-by-the-sea to his son Joshua. Lambert MSS. 2 Joshua Wetwang died between 1663 and 1688. In 1663 he was rated for Dunstan. Hodgson, Northumberland, III. i. p. 248. Captain John Wetwang, the native of Dunstan, has already been mentioned (see p. 188). He was a celebrated sea captain in the Dutch wars, and may have been Joshua Wetwang's younger brother. In some notes copied by Mr. George Bouchier Richardson from the Newcastle Custom House books is the following letter : 'Gentlemen, by the direction of Sir Edmond Turner (who is lately come to town) I am to acquaint you t-hat one Capt. John Wetwang, an eminent comander in the fleet in the late Dutch warr is useing great endeavors to obteyne a patent for the making of all merchant bills of entryes in the port of London, etc. I am, gentlemen, your humble servant, Philip Marsh. Custom House, London, 3 June, 1676.' His son Robert was apprenticed to John Strangways, merchant adventurer and draper, nth November, 1665. On the 26th March, 1675, the term of apprenticeship having still eight months to run, he was admitted to the freedom of the drapers' fraternity, on which occasion ' Mr. Wettwang being called in, Mr. Governor acquainted him his petition had been reade, and that out of that high esteem they had off, and singular respect to, his father Captain Wettwang ... tbe company was pleased to admitt him.' Newcastle Tracts. John Wetwang the father was afterwards knighted, and was master oi the Trinity House of Newcastle in 1677 and 1683. He lived for many years in London, and many of his letters relating to the busine ss of the Trinity Houseare extant. On February 18th, 1697, Nicholas t en- wick, then mayor, wrote to Sir William Blackett, referring to Robert Wetwang, 'I am now importunde by my brethren to acquaint your worship that Mr Weatwange is looket upon to be a dyeinge man, and con- tinues very ill.' Ibid. 3 This was the opinion of Archdeacon Basire, who probably knew nothing of the antiquity of Wetwang's family (see p. 144)' 1 It seems never to have exceeded a quarter of the township. In 1663 Lord Grey held \u00a7 of Dunstan. The remaining 1 was divided between Joshua Wetwang and Edward Craster. 5 Lambert MSS."], [228, "192 EMBLETON PARISH. The Proctor family, originally settled in Yorkshire, was established at Shawdon at the beginning of the sixteenth century, through the marriage of William Proctor of Nether Bordley to Isabel, daughter of John Lilburn of Shawdon. John Proctor, who exchanged Shawdon for the Dunstan estate, married twice. Thomas Proctor, the eldest son of the first marriage, became ultimately the owner of Rock, whilst John Proctor, the second son of the second marriage, succeeded under his father's will1 to the land at Dunstan. The old tower, formerly known as Dunstan hall, received from its new proprietors the name Proctor's Stead, by which it is generally known at the present day. But though the name of the Proctors remains associated with the place, the family did not retain the property for any great length of time. John Proctor, son of John Proctor and Elizabeth Ion, sold his land at Dunstan in 1778 to Daniel Craster for \u00a37,700. In this w7ay the old estate of the Wetwangs was added to that part of Dunstan which from ancient times had been the property of the Craster family.2 This portion of the township has descended to Mr. John Craster of Craster. The remainder of Dunstan was sold with the barony of Embleton, and has become the property of the Eyres' trustees.3 PROCTOR OF SHAWDON, ROCK, AND DUNSTAN 1 Thomas Proctor non probavit arma.'

DUNSTANBURGH CASTLE.1 The rugged headland, on which the ruins of Dunstanburgh stand, is the grandest feature in the great basaltic range that traverses Northumberland from Kyloe to Glenwhelt, and appears most prominently in the castle rock of Bamburgh, the crags of Shafto and Sewingshields, and the Nine Nicks of Thirlwall. The situation of Dunstanburgh recalls in a manner those of the other great east coast fortresses of Scarborough, Tynemouth, and Tantallon, but is more romantic even than the last of these. No carriage road leads to Dunstanburgh, and the forced pilgrimage on foot has in itself an indescribable old-world charm. As the traveller comes along the shore from Embleton, a crescent of black cliffs rises a hundred feet out of the waves to form the northern rampart of the castle. He might almost expect to be challenged by the giant rocks of basalt that stand like so many warders drawn up round the base of the stately Lilburn tower, and might almost believe that the shattered turrets of the great gatehouse are sustained by power of enchant ment, so much do their fantastic outlines, towering mysteriously over the green slope of the western escarpment, seem to set all known principles of gravitation at defiance. High as is the curtain-wall, in a strong north-east gale the sea dashes its spray above it. In addition to this rare combination of natural and architectural beauty, Dunstanburgh possesses historical associa tions of no common interest, which in their unique and melancholy character are in complete harmony with the scene. The other castles of Northumber land are principally famous for the part they and their lords took in Border warfare, Dunstanburgh is connected only with the internal history of Eng land. It was owned by the two great popular leaders of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, Simon de Montfort and Thomas of Lancaster, and its fortunes became closely interwoven with those of the Red Rose in the civil wars of the fifteenth. The medi\u00e6val stronghold, the largest castle in Northumberland, which comprises ten acres within its walls, apparently occupied only the northern portion of the natural fortress.2 The great gatehouse was placed where the ' This account of Dunstanburgh, originally written and now revised by Mr. Bates, is reprinted from the Arch\u00e6ologia \u00c6liuna, vol. xiv. ii. part 38, by permission of the Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle-upon- Tyne. - Some ofthe ground within the castle walls was at one time under cultivation.

Traces of a rough stone rampart to the south of the present castle make it probable that the whole rock was fortified in pr\u00e6-historic days. The very name 'Donstanesburgh' shows that it was a 'burh' or fortified tribal centre ofthe Angles, possibly at as early a date as Bamburgh, and established perhaps by some forgotten Dunstan. Nothing is known as to the causes that led to its subsequent abandonment. After the Norman conquest it was contained, without being specially mentioned, in the manor of Dunstan and barony of Embleton.1 As a part of this barony Dunstanburgh eventually became the property of Rametta la Vescuntesse, who, in the year 1255, accepted lands in Hamp shire and Dorsetshire from Simon de Montfort, earl of Leicester, in exchange for her estate in Northumberland.2 The motives which may have influenced Earl Simon in the acquisition of this northern property have been already discussed. After Montfort's death Dunstanburgh, with the rest of the barony, came into the possession of Edmund, earl of Lancaster, whose son, Thomas Plantagenet, succeeded to the earldoms of Lancaster, Leicester, and Derby, in 1294. By his orders the stone for the erection of Dunstan burgh castle began to be quarried on the 7th of May, 1313.3 The reasons that prompted the lord of Kenilworth and Pontefract to raise a castle on the wild coast of Northumberland are as suspicious as those that led Simon de Montfort to purchase the rock on which it stands. Earl Thomas was in almost open rebellion against his cousin Edward II. , whose favourite Gaveston he had treacherously beheaded in the previous June, and he was not included in an amnesty till the following October. Dunstanburgh was not intended as a bulwark against Scotland, for Earl Thomas was not only one of the mal contents who stood aloof from the expedition which ended in the disaster of Bannockburn in June, 1314, but is even said to have jeered at the discomfited Edward as he passed under the battlements of Pontefract on his return. Indeed he stood accused of having come to a secret understanding with the Scots, and was mentioned as the price they paid for his benevolent neutrality. All this time work was steadily going on at Dunstanburgh. By 1 See p. 14. 2 See p. 17. 3 ' Opera castri et fossati de Donstanesburghe,' in the account of the receiver of Embleton.

Spanish iron had been purchased for the hinges, and the cramps for binding the stones together, and 'Eastland boards' procured for the doors and win dows. Four carts and a couple of wains had been kept constantly going for stone, sand, and mortar, over and above those which the bailiff had been able to impress from the peasantry. Sea coal for burning the lime had been brought from Newcastle and elsewhere. A hostelry 80 feet long by 20 feet broad had been erected as a shelter for the workmen at a cost of 36s. id., and Master Elias the mason had been proceeding with the contract he had entered into with the earl for rearing the bows of the gatehouse to the height of 80 feet, with a tower above on either side of the gateway. The whole con tract ran to .^224, and of this \u00a365 ios. had been paid for work already done.1 The great affection entertained for the earl by the clergy had been very practically attested by the presents they had sent for the 'garniture' of the castle of Dunstanburgh. The abbot of St. Mary's at York, the abbot of AInwick, the priors of Nostell and Tynemouth, Master Robert de Pykering, and Master Peter de Dene, whom Earl Thomas had presented to the rectory of Embleton,2 had each given him two cart horses ; the abbot of Newminster six oxen. One of the horses had been carried off by the Scots ; but the fact that this is the only trace of their ravages in Northumberland after Bannock burn to be found in the accounts of the bailiff, tends rather to confirm the tradition that they intentionally spared the earl's estates.3 William Galoun, the bailiff, appears to have taken a very active part in furthering the earl's political schemes.4 The colossal proportions of the great gatehouse serve to conjure up a vision of what the hall, chapel, and lodgings of Dunstanburgh would have been if Thomas of Lancaster, whose foible it was to assume the character of King Arthur in the pageants of the court, had carried out his evident inten tion of creating here a veritable 'Joyous Garde.' At the parliament held at Lincoln in January, 13 16, the government of the country was virtually made over to him, and it was there that, after a short summer session, the king granted him on the 21st of August a license for strengthening his house of 1 Ibid. \"- See p. 52. 3 ' Wamestura castri de Donstanburghe' in Duchy of Lancaster Records, Ministers' Accounts, bundle I, No. 3. 4 See pp. 23, 24."], [239, "DUNSTANBURGH CASTLE. 199 Dunstanburgh with a wall of stone and lime, and crenellating and holding it without interference.1 Either this license merely legalised facts already accomplished, or it marks the date of the completion of the battlements of the gatehouse and the occupation of it by a regular garrison. By a sudden and quite unexpected burst of energy on the part of Edward II. , Thomas of Lancaster was in 1322 made prisoner at Borough bridge, tried in his own castle hall at Pontefract, and, being convicted of secret dealings with the Scots, was executed forthwith on the 22nd of March. His advisers had in vain urged him to escape to Dunstanburgh before it was too late.2 The custody of Dunstanburgh was committed by the king to Roger Horseley, his seneschal in Northumberland.3 Horseley was afterwards directed to deliver it to Richard de Emeldon, a distinguished merchant of Newcastle, who on the 24th of March had been appointed keeper ofthe castles and lands of the late earl in both Durham and Northumberland.4 In the same year Richard de Emeldon furnished sixty-eight hobilars or light horsemen from the garrison for the invasion of Scotland.5 The constables of the castle were then John de Lilburn and Roger Mauduit, who, in common with other constables of Border castles, were severely rebuked by the king on the 26th of September for their negligence in not taking better precautions for pre venting the incursions of the Scots.6 John de Lilburn was still constable of Dunstanburgh in 1326, when he served on a commission to provide ships from Dunstanburgh and other northern ports to protect the king from his French queen ; 7 it seems impossible however to imagine where the port of Dunstanburgh can have been. About the same time the bishop of Durham was ordered to fortify and victual Dunstanburgh among other northern castles.8 Nothing important appears to have taken place at Dunstanburgh between the years 1326 and 1351, when the castle was in the possession of Earl 'Rot.

At his expense a new roof of thatch was placed upon the grange, the hall, and the constable's chamber. Some alterations were also made in the Lilburn tower which had probably been built by the late constable John de Lilburn. At the same time the 'tower beyond the gates' was partially reconstructed;1 the 'little towers over the hall beyond the gates,' and the garrets of the hall were covered with lead, and other small repairs were effected.2 In 1368, when the barony of Embleton had become the property of John of Gaunt,3 a new drawbridge was made at the gate-tower of Dunstan burgh, and charges appear for the custody of the water-gate and of the barbican.4 Four years later we find John of Gaunt, titular king of Castile, ordering his esquire, William de Querneby, the receiver of Dunstanburgh, to repair the castle and to build in it a new wall in accordance with the advice of William de Nesfeld his steward in those parts.5 A warrant from him, dated at Kenilworth the 17th of April, 1380, directs the constable of Dunstanburgh to buy a certain number of salmon at Berwick and send them to the Savoy.\" The same year he came north himself with a large army for the purpose of establishing a lasting peace on the Border. He appears to have been dissatisfied with the state of Dunstanburgh, and when at Bamburgh on the 25th of October, he engaged John Lewyn, a mason from Durham, to build a ' mantelett ' of freestone round the great tower in his castle of Dunstanburgh. The wall of this mantlet, estimated to be eleven rods in length, was to be 4 feet broad, and, with the battlement, 20 feet high from the ground. The work was to be completed by the following Michael mas at the cost of 10 marks a rod, to include everything except wood for burning the lime and cement.7 Subsequently, visiting Dunstanburgh in person, John of Gaunt determined to have a new work of masonry erected adjoining Lewyn's mantlet, and he himself pointed out the exact situation it was to occupy to his ' dear and well-beloved ' mason Henry de Holme.8 The work wras to be carried out under the superintendence of his 'very dear and 1 This was probably the tower between the Lilburn tower and the more recent outer gate of the castle. - See pp. 26-29. 3 See pp. 29, 30. 4 Duchy of Lancaster, Ministers' Accounts, bundle 361, No. 5971. 5 Duchy of Lancaster Reg.

His efforts to restore peace had been unsuccessful, and the Scots, encamped in the immediate neighbourhood of Dunstanburgh, were ravaging the country.3 Vigorous action was evidently necessary. The neighbouring fortress of Bamburgh was repaired at a great expense,4 and the masons were again busily employed at Dunstanburgh. In addition to the work previously con tracted for, Henry de Holme built six houses with their vaults, chimneys, and windows, and made a new entrance to the castle with a vaulted gate house, furnished with a portcullis and a 'vice,' for which he was to receive twenty pounds.5 On the 20th of July, 1383, he entered into a further agree ment with John of Gaunt at Durham for the erection of a new gatehouse of freestone at the castle of Dunstanburgh, renewing the voussoirs, jambs, and barbicans, and making use of the materials of the old gatehouse for the new work. The new gatehouse was to be vaulted, and to have a barbican, a postern, and the necessary arrangements for a draw7bridge.6 It will thus be seen that John of Gaunt, to whom Kenilworth is indebted for the most beauti ful portions of its castle, took a personal interest in the fortification of the great Lancastrian stronghold on the coast of Northumberland. On the accession of Henry IV. the duchy of Lancaster, in which Dun stanburgh was included, became practically vested in the Crown. Robert Harbottle of Preston was made constable of the castle on the 13th of June, 1409, 7 and on his death, ten or eleven years later, his brother, John Harbottle, was entrusted with its safe-keeping.8 In February, 142 1, Henry Lound was appointed constable,9 and in consequence, it would seem, of his representa- 1 Ibid. p. 120. 2 Ibid. p. 62. 3 See p. 67.

They burnt the neighbouring villages, carried off the inhabitants as prisoners, and did not spare the castle.2 On the death of Lound a reasonable allowance was ordered to be made to his sons, John and Peter, for their custody ofthe castle and for repairs made by them to houses within it, in the interval before the appointment of Stephen Hatfield on the 20th of February, 1427.3 Hatfield complained to the council of the duchy that the castle was in a ruinous condition, and they therefore instructed the receiver of Dunstan burgh, in February, 1430, to supply him with sufficient funds for its immediate repair.4 The next vear he informed them that the great gateway was so old and battered that it was on the point of falling to the ground, 'to the great peril of the safe guard of the castle, if a speedy remedy was not applied,' and, in consequence, renewed instructions were sent to the receiver on the subject.5 On the 8th of July, 1436, Ralph Babthorpe was appointed joint con stable with Hatfield.6 From about this period an almost unbroken series of minister's and receiver's accounts for Dunstanburgh has been preserved. They contain various items of expenditure on the fabric of the castle during the years preceding each successive Michaelmas on which they were rendered. Thus at Michaelmas, 1439, there is an entry stating that the houses and cham bers in the castle had been repaired and painted. An arched gutter had been made under the great tower. The foundations of the east tower of the castle had been repaired and strengthened at the cost of 9s. in masons' wrages.7 During the following year 72 stones of lead were purchased at New castle, and brought 30 leagues by sea for covering the broken lead tiles of the hall and of the great chamber of the tower called the 'dungeoun.'

Sir Ralph Percy, the fourth son of the second earl of Northumberland who was slain fighting for the Red Rose at St. Albans in 1455, seems to have been appointed joint constable of Dunstanburgh with Stephen Hatfield in succession to Ralph Babthorpe, who also fell there fighting on the same side.2 After the disaster of Towton on the 'Evil Palm Sunday' of 1461, Dunstanburgh was one of the castles retained by the Lan castrians and by them ' victualled, and stuffed ' with Englishmen, Frenchmen, and Scots.3 From Michaelmas, 1461 , however, we find that the demesne lands of Dunstan, with the dovecot near the castle, and the grange, ox-stall and other houses of husbandry within the castle, lately in the tenure of William Lilburn and Richard Forster, were demised by Edward IV. to Sir Ralph Percy at the yearly rent of 6s. 8d.4 The dovecot had been turned into a kiln for drying malt on account of its ruinous state.5 On the 25th of October, 1461, Queen Margaret landed in Northumber land, and, aided by troops from France and Scotland, in the course of the following month, obtained possession of Bamburgh, AInwick, and Dunstan burgh.6 Thereupon King Edward marched north with a great host, and by order of the earl of Warwick, who fixed his headquarters at Warkworth, the three castles were invested on the ioth of December.

John Gosse, the captain of the castle, who had been carver in the household of the duke of Somerset, wTas carried to York and there beheaded.8 The victorious earl of Warwick kept the feast of St. John Baptist at Dunstanburgh.9 1 Cotton Charter, xvii. io, printed in Excerpt a Historica, Bentley, p. 365. 2 Ibid. il The Wednesday by fore Cristmasse, anno Domini M\".cccc.lxij\u00b0 ....

On the 6th of March, 1465, Edward IV. appointed William Douglas porter of the castle of Dunstanburgh for life at the salary of 4d. a day, and four days later Robert, William, and Henry Haggerston were made joint constables of the castle.1 The castle and great barn were repaired in 1470,2 but after that date notices of expenditure on the maintenance of the fortress are seldom met with in the minister's accounts. On the 18th of December, 147 1, Sir Henry Percy received from Edward IV. an annual grant of and three years later we find that Henry, earl of Northumber land, was the constable.3 Afterwards, on the Sth of July, 1489, Edmund Craster was, in consideration of good service, appointed constable by Henry VII.4 Towards the end of January, 15 14, the ships of war, which Henry VIII. had ordered to proceed to the Firth of Forth under the command of William Sabyn of the Sabyne, had not been heard of since they victualled at Hull three weeks before. Thomas Beverley, who is described as 'an honest, sad and secret person,' was therefore ordered to look out for the missing vessels on the coast of Northumberland. He succeeded in finding Sabyn at Dunstanburgh, a rather singular harbour of refuge.1 Writing to Wolsey on the 24th of May, 1524, Lord Dacre suggested that lead for the repair of the roof of the donjon of Wark might be procured from Dunstanburgh castle.6 In his reply, dated the 1 1 th of June, the cardinal states that the king agreed to the proposal, and ordered as much lead to be taken as could be spared.7 Both Wark and Dunstanburgh were then in the custody of Sir William Ellerker, and when, in November, 1528, Ellerker lay 'at the mercy of God, not likely to recover,' we find the earl of Northumberland writing to his 'bedfellow' Arundel, asking him to use his influence in obtaining the appointments for him, as these posts had been filled by several former wardens of the Marches.8 The royal commissioners Bellysis, Collingwood, and Horseley presented the following report on Dunstanburgh to Henry VIII. in 1538 : ' Duchy of Lancaster Records, Receivers' Accounts, bundle 361, No. 5985. - Ibid, bundle 361, No. 5987. 3 Ibid, bundle 361, No. 5989.

Also ther ys muche stone about the seyd castell, wiche ys fallen into the seyd castell, and also without the wailes ; yf hyt were leed together, yt woll amount to very many loods of ston.1 At the time when this survey was made a report was also drawn up as to the condition of the Moot Hall at Embleton, in which it is suggested that the hall should be repaired with lead and timber from the castle.2 It is probable therefore that the castle, instead of being repaired, was dismantled and used as a quarry for buildings in the neighbourhood. Sir Robert Bowes in his Book ofthe State of the Marches, compiled in 1550, says : 'The castle of Dunstanborough is in wonderfull great decaye, and the utter wall thereof might be repayred with no great charge, also the gatehouse, and a house for a constable. And then surely it would be a great refuge to the inhabitants of those partes, yff enemies came to annove them, either arriving by sea or coming by lande out of Scoteland, soe that they brought no great ordynaunce or power to remayne any longe tyme theire.'3 Queen Elizabeth's commissioners, in 1584, thought the castle or fortress of Dunstan burgh ' not so needfull to be repaired, nor so necessarye, as other, for the defence of the country or annoance againstes the enemyes of the opposit border of Scotland, because the same is so farr distant from the sayd border of Scotland, and yet a howse of verye great force and strength, if it be thought gude by her majestye for any other respect, touchinge the sea coostes or otherwise, to be repaired.' They describe it as standing on the sea coast about 18 miles south-east of Berwick and as 'decaied for want of repairinge by long contynuance.' To restore it to its original condition would, they estimated, cost the large sum of 1,000; but it might in their opinion be made capable of holding a garrison of not more than a hundred horse or foot for about On the 27th of February, 1591, Queen Elizabeth issued a commission ' to view and survey the decaies and decaied places of the wailes about the castle of Dunstanburghe,' by virtue of which 'Mr. Delavale, Mr. Ra. Grey, Mr. Clavering and Mr. Luke Ogle ' repaired to the castle on the first of September following, and 'by the opinion and judgement of divers skilful artizans, freemasons and others, by perambulation and survey,' certified 1 Duchy of Lancaster Depositions, vol. xxxviii.

II. 27"], [252, "210 EMBLETON PARISH. that fifty-three yards of the north-east wTall of the castle towards the town of Embleton was utterly ruined in front, though the lining was ' in reasonable good state,' and that it would take the total sum of 6s. 8d. to repair it, 'which small time will make more chargeable to her majestie.'1 James I. sold Dunstanburgh on the 28th August, 1604, to Sir Thomas Windebank, Thomas Billott, and William Blake, and they resold it to Sir Ralph Grey on the 21st November, 1605, and it continued the property of his descendants until the earl of Tankerville sold it to the trustees of the late Mr. Samuel Eyres of Leeds in 1869. The wonderful strength of the masonry executed in the time of Thomas of Lancaster is strikingly brought out by the brave way in which the original towers and walls of the castle have withstood the assaults of time and tempest, while the subsequent works carried out by John of Gaunt and the Lancastrian dynasty have almost entirely disappeared. The great gatehouse of Thomas of Lancaster, afterwards converted into the donjon, is a block about 105 feet in breadth, consisting of an archway with two storeys over it, flanked by two towers each about 40 feet square, but having a semi-circular projection which extends 16 feet beyond the line of the square. These projecting bows, the cubenda said to have been raised to the height of 80 feet in 131 6,2 appear to have measured to the top of the battlements about 65 feet, above the present ground level near the entrance. They formed a sort of false front of two additional storeys, and attached to them on either side of the gateway were small turrets containing wheel-stairs. Shouldered doorways led into these turrets from the rampart-walk above the gate, and at the next floor level the turrets were slightly corbelled out beyond the sweep of the bows in a masterly fashion, so as eventually to make their walls rectangular. Each of these twin gate-towers is, with minor differences, so much the counterpart of the other, that the main features of their construction can be fairly ascertained by supplying what is fallen away in the one by what is left in the other. The umbrella-like groining, for instance, in which both turret stairs terminated, can still be seen through the uppermost doorway of the western turret, which opened on to the battlements ofthe bow. Three or four put-log-holes are still left high up inside the north wall ofthe eastern bow. 1 Duchy of Lancaster Depositions, 33 Eliz.

There is no sign of any provision for a portcullis near the outer arch, which however looks like a restoration. The entrance passage is 1 1 feet 2 inches wide. The buried bases of the side walls show that the road was formerly at a lower level. Mason-marks are plentiful on the four innermost ribs of the vault. At the far end of the passage there is, on either side, the doorway of a guard-chamber. The eastern guard-chamber, which is about 16 feet long by 6 feet 8 inches wide, has a three-ribbed vault, and contains two square aumbries and a small window to the north ; the western, now entered from the inner ward by what was originally a loop, has a small fire-place, and was probably the porter's lodge. Just within the inner arch of the gateway is the groove for the portcullis, 6 inches wide, the portcullis itself having been 12 feet wide. Both ends of the passage were at one time walled up in order to turn the gatehouse into a donjon. The flanking towers were entered from the courtyard by doors near the foot of the wheel-stairs in the north-east and north-west corners of the gate house. These wheel-stairs, the steps of which are about 3 feet broad, ter minated in umbrella-shaped vaults. The drums have cross-shaped loops to the east and west in the basement, and to the north in the first floor. The ashlars of which Dunstanburgh is built are often of Cyclopean dimen sions ; one stone that forms the lintel of the door of the large room in the basement of the western tower is over 7 feet long. This room, which measures about 24 feet by 12 feet in the rectangular portion, and is 12 feet in diameter in the bow, is now much filled with debris. The head of a door in the west wall leading to a latrine is only just visible. There is a fire-place in the north wall and there are two cross-loops recessed in the w7all of the bow, which is about 16 feet thick. The room on the first floor has a fire-place in the west wall, near which is the stair to a latrine. The second floor, unlike the two lower ones, which have intervening passages, is entered directly from the wheel-stair. The very similar interior of the eastern tower presents at the first floor level one of the most striking features in the castle ; the arch thrown across the bow on the second floor, in order to carry the north wall of the false two-storied front, being of the noblest proportions. The central room over the vaulted passage of the gatehouse is 26 feet long by 22 feet broad. In the south-west corner there is a mural chamber"], [254, "EMBLETON PARISH. 212 with a cross-looped opening commanding the entrance ; two slanting shafts in the south wall seem to have served the same purpose. Close to the north wall is the slit in the floor for raising the portcullis, and there are holes for two stays on which to rest it. The fire-place seems to have been in the west wall. This room was probably the great hall, the room above it being the chamber in the donjon, the windows of which were glazed in 1458.1 About 20 yards along the curtain-wall, which starts from the north-west corner of the original gatehouse, are the traces of what, when this was con verted into the donjon, became the main entrance to the castle. It may probably have been the outer gateway of the barbican ordered to be built by John of Gaunt in 1383.2 The portcullis groove, about 7 inches in width, remains on the north side of the passage, which was 12 feet broad. The jamb ofa door, opening into a recess, 3 feet 7 inches wide, is left at the first floor level on the south side of this ruined gatehouse. From the original curtain wall, near this door, the north wall of the inner ward, of subsequent erection, ran eastwards, but not quite parallel to the donjon, for about 100 feet, up to a mass of ruin at the north-east angle of the ward, which represents the site of a tower that possibly contained the chapel. It then turned south for about 40 feet to the door of the east tower of the donjon, which it blocked up. The gateway of the inner ward is at the north end of this east wall. It had a port cullis 8 feet 9 inches wide, but the archway was at some time built up and a smaller door inserted. The wall of the inner ward probably represents the mantlet ordered to be built by John of Gaunt in 1380,3 while the gateway may have been that constructed by Henry de Holme in 1383.4 The draw well in the inner ward has been filled up to within about 6 feet of the surface ; the kitchen was probably near it. On the west curtain-wall, about 30 yards north of the more recent outer gate ofthe castle, is another tower, probably 'the tower beyond the gates' of 1 35 1. This tower is indicated as almost perfect in the Bucks' view of Dunstanburgh in 1728, but, owing to the friable nature of the rock beneath, it has so fallen to ruin that the only masonry left is a few courses of the 1 See p. 203. 2 See p. 201. The road leading up to this gate is very distinct. 3 The length of the north and east walls of the inner ward seems to be about eleven rods, similar to the length of the mantlet, see p. 200. It must be borne in mind that variations in standard measures, and subsequent alterations to buildings make it often almost impossible to reconcile the documentary references to them with the existing remains, while, until the inner ward of Dunstanburgh is carefully excavated, its exact arrangements must continue more or less uncertain. 1 See p. 201."], [255, "DUNSTANBURGH CASTLE"], [256, ""], [257, "DUNSTANBURGH CASTLE. 213 lining of its south-east corner. Beyond this tower the west curtain is better preserved for a space of 40 yards, up to the angle where, adapting itself to the escarpment, it suddenly turns in a more easterly direction for another 40 yards when it joins the Lilburn tower. The Lilburn Tower (from the North-West). The Lilburn tower, built pro bably by John Lilburn, constable of Dunstanburgh about 1 325/ oc cupies the highest position in the castle area. The walls are 6 feet thick ; the space enclosed being about 13 feet 6 inches square. The stair went up in a turret at the south-east corner, which has all fallen away. In the east wall, im mediately north of this, is an en trance passage 5 feet 3 inches in width. In the south wall of the basement near the present ground level are three aumbries, and in the west wall is the plain-headed recess of a lancet-window, the stone round it having been cut away to fit a square window-frame. At the first floor level the wall is set back about 10 inches, and on this ledge the beams rested, a large one having been laid across from north to south. A mural passage, with a flat roof 1 The mason-marks differ from those on the donjon."], [258, "214 EMBLETON PARISH. of large flags supported on corbels, ran through the east wall, and formed a continuation of the walk round the ramparts of the curtain-wall. A peculiar double-window pierces both the inner and outer walls of this passage. The remaining north jamb of the inner window contains holes for the insertion of three stout bars. In the north wall near the north-east corner is a plain flat headed fire-place. Windows of two lights, of the usual Dunstanburgh character, with shouldered recesses and plain seats, look north and west. In the south-west corner is the entrance to a latrine. The arrangements of the second floor have been very similar, but there is only a single light in the plain-headed recess to the north, and above the mural passage, in the east wall of the floor below, is a shouldered window recess. At each angle of the roof a solid turret rose about 18 feet to the height of 60 feet or so above the tower base. The only portions left of the battlements between these turrets are two courses of large stones on the east side of the south-west turret ; below them is a rough spout. The north-west turret was struck by lightning during a terrific storm in June, 1885, when three sheep were killed by the lightning and three by the falling stones. The turret has since been carefully repaired by the present owners ofthe castle. Immediately under the north side of the Lilburn tower, a small postern, with a round arch of the Decorated period, opens on the steep escarpment in the direction of Embleton. The original height of the curtain-wall above this postern is shown by the shouldered doorway that led on to the rampart walk from the mural passage in the tower. The curtain continues in a northerly direction for 40 yards further, and then, after making a sharp bend westward in order to adapt itself to the contour of the slope, comes, at a distance of 20 yards, to the brink of the Gull Crag, a precipice that rises 100 feet above the sea round the whole north side ofthe castle. A mass of rubble marks the point where the curtain terminated. Returning across the castle green to the east side of the donjon, the great height of the southern curtain-wall is shown where it was tied into the donjon near the commencement of the eastern bow. A wooden stair led down on to the rampart-walk from a shouldered door on the second floor of the donjon. The curtain extends towards the east for a space of 35 yards, when it reaches the constable's tower, containing at one place the solid base of what looks like the platform for a mangonel or some such engine of defence, corbelled boldly out over the moat, here about 25 feet broad. The con-"], [259, "DUNSTANBURGH CASTLE. 215 stable's tower, of two storeys, about 15 feet square inside, projects 9 feet out wards beyond the line of the curtain-wall. At the north-east corner is the skeleton of a wheel-stair. The basement story in which is a small window at the north-west corner, is much filled up with rubbish. The upper floor has fire-places in the west wall, and good windows of two lights within recesses provided with stone seats, in the south wall. Passages lead off the stair into latrines in the thickness of the curtain, while at the second floor level a door, now built up, communicated with the rampart-walk. A little to the north of this tower are the ruins of a rough-walled building of late character, measuring inside 22 feet 4 inches in length, east to west, by 14 feet 4 inches in width. The courses of masonry projecting at the east end show that it was intended to be joined to another building, and there are also arches of similar masonry abutting on the north. From its close proximity to the con stable's tower we may reasonably consider this to have been the hall of the constabulary with its adjacent houses, mentioned as being repaired in 1444.1 To the east of the constable's tower, at a distance of 25 yards, is a small turret, measuring only 10 feet 9 inches by 7 feet 6 inches inside, projecting 7 feet towards the moat. The vault of the basement is formed by large flags resting on a single rib. Near this turret is a flight of steps leading to the rampart-walk. The southern curtain-wall terminates in the Elgyn,2 or Queen Margaret's tower, at a distance of about no yards from the donjon, and situated on the brink of the great chasm with its cliffs of columnar basalt and metamorphosed limestone. At the time of Samwell's survey this tower was known as the 'Egyngcloughe.' The basement ofthe tower, about n feet 9 inches square inside, served as a postern. The round-headed north door appears to have been restored. The south wall has nearly all fallen away, but the two bar holes of the door may still be seen on the east side.3 The basement is built of large ashlars, some nearly 2 feet square. It was covered with flat stones resting on two massive ribs. The masonry of the superstructure is of a 'See p. 203.

Had this postern-tower at the Egginclough not been of the same age as the donjon, the language of the Receivers' Account of 1459 would have led anyone to believe that the turret to the east of the constable's tower was the ' Elgyntour,' and that the Egginclough tower was the postern built in that year between this, and the sea.

A wheel-stair, four steps of which are still entire, led to the upper floors and to the battlements of the south curtain, at the junction of the latter with the tower. The first floor has a recess, provided with seats, for a window of two lights in the north wall, and a passage to a latrine in the north-east corner. There is a fire-place in the east wall. The second floor, with corresponding arrangements, was supported on eight beams, laid north and south, as can be seen from the put log-holes. The way in which the east side of this tower, with all the wild beauty of the Egginclough at its foot, was given over entirely to latrines, is an excellent example of the inability of medi\u00e6val minds to appreciate the romantic scenes in which, for purely practical reasons, their habitations were often fixed.1 A high piece of good ashlar-work is still standing round the northern edge of the Egginclough, but beyond this the east wall of the castle is of mere rubble, consisting of a whitish stone in some parts faced with basalt. In one place there is an opening to a narrow passage 5 feet long, in the thickness of the wall ; in another, further on, the foundations of two con verging walls run back westwards for 55 yards to what seems to have been a building about 35 yards long by 6 yards broad, possibly the grange in the castle. 1 That part of the tower which contained the latrines has fallen into the clough since Mr. Archer's sketch of it in 1862, preserved at AInwick castle."], [261, "GEOLOGY. 217 ELLINGHAM PARISH. The parish of EUingham is bounded by the parishes of Embleton on the east, Eglingham on the south and west, and Bamburgh on the north. The parish, which contains the six townships of EUingham, North Charlton, South Charlton, Doxford, Preston, and Chathill, is about five miles in length from Chathill on the north to Longlee Moor on the south, and four miles in breadth from Hangwell Law on the western moorland to Doxford hall near the boundary of Embleton. The g in EUingham is pronounced softly as in many other place-names in Northumberland, for example, Edlingham, Egling ham, and Bellingham. The parish of EUingham differs greatly in geological structure from that of Embleton, and presents many remarkable geological features which will be now briefly examined and described. GEOLOGY. The parish of Ellingham is situated to the west of Embleton, and in consequence of the south-easterly dip prevalent in the district we find, as might be expected, that only the lower beds of the 'calcareous' group and the sandstones, shales, and coals belonging to the 'carbonaceous' group of the series crop out in this parish. A limestone bed was, however, formerly quarried immediately to the north of South Charlton, and also at a place a little to the east of the north road opposite North Charlton, where extensive 'tips' and a ruined limekiln mark the position of the outcrop. As the limestone is no longer worked, and no trace of it is visible at the surface at the present day, the following section of the bed at North Charlton from the notes of the late Mr. George Tate,1 is of interest : Feet.

A slight displacement of the strata immediately north of East Linkhall, carrying a lode, appears to be the westerly termination of the fault which originates on the coast in the sandy flat near Newton North farm, and strikes south-westward in the direction of Brunton and Fallodon mill. Westward from the great north road the country rises into rounded sandstone hills forming the stretch of moorland, of which Hollinsheugh Hill (415 feet) on Longlee Moor, Crag Hill (520 feet) on Brockley Hall Moor, Camp Hill (595 feet) on North Charlton Moor, and Houghterslaw (609 feet) on the Middle Moor are the most prominent points. Extensive quarries have from time to time been opened in the sandstone, which is largely used for building pur poses. The stone, which is usually of different shades of yellow according to the quantities of iron oxides present, varies from a fine-grained sandstone to a coarse grit. In most of the beds the matrix contains a moderate quantity of felspathic material, and the stone, though soft when freshly quarried, hardens on exposure to the air. Several thin seams of coal, associated with these beds, have been worked in times past near Houghterslaw, Windylaw, and the Middle Moor. Old workings also occur on the east side of the road near Brownyside and Charlton Mires, and a shaft was sunk as recently as 1892 on Windylaw Moor, but was abandoned without being worked. It is difficult to assign to many of these seams their exact horizon, but the bed, the outcrop of which is faulted into the extreme north-west corner of the parish, probably represents the ' Main ' coal of the Scremerston district. To the east of the great north road the country is so thickly covered with glacial deposits that no outcrops of Carboniferous rocks are visible in this portion of the parish ; the glacial deposits, however, present some very remarkable surface features. The Carboniferous rocks, which rise in ranges of sandstone to the west, slope away eastward, forming almost a level tract over the centre and east parts of the parish, where thick deposits of glacial material are piled in disordered mounds and hillocks. The hillocks consist for the most part of purple coloured, sandy, boulder clay, filled with a mis cellaneous assortment of subangular, or rounded, boulders and pebbles, of which a few are scratched and polished by ice. The majority, however, are unmistakeably water-worn, and resemble the material forming the 'kaims' of Bradford and Hoppen to the north. Near the surface a large portion of the boulders consist of local sandstones and limestones, whilst whin, Cheviot"], [263, "GEOLOGY. 219 porphyrites and felsite, together with a hard white gannister, are plentifully scattered throughout the mass. It is also interesting to note the occurrence of two distinct varieties of limestone, the peculiar characters of which render them easy of detection. One of these is the altered pink limestone, with pale green crinoid stems, already mentioned as occurring plentifully in the boulder clay of the coast to the east. The origin of this rock has been traced to the south-west corner of Budle Bay, due north of North Charlton, and the line of transportation of the boulders at North Charlton from this source corre sponds in direction with the surface groovings over the district. The other characteristic limestone boulders consist of the peculiar concretionary variety which occurs in the outcrops of the ' Oxford ' limestone at Goldenhills near Bradford. This also is immediately on the line of striations from north to south. The reason for the accumulation of so great a mass of material at this spot is not at once apparent. It is true that the land on which it is piled would be the first level country that an ice sheet would pass over after traversing the sand stone hills to the west. It would therefore seem to be the natural place where material, washed down from such an ice sheet melting back westward, would accumulate ; and the numerous boulders of Cheviot porphyrite con tained in the deposit tend to support this view. But the scratches on the hills are approximately north and south, and the pink and concretionary limestones are almost certainly of northern origin. It is quite possible, how ever, that the deposit originally left by the Cheviot glacier was afterwards supplemented and re-arranged by the Scottish ice from the north, which brought with it its characteristic boulders and produced the striations which run north and south. The whole mass was afterwards scoured and re-arranged at the close of the glacial period by floods of water which removed the ice marks from the pebbles, and imparted to them their characttristic water-worn appearance. This theory will account for the ultimate mingling of the rocks from the north and west. But to whatever circumstances their aggregation at this spot may be attributed there is no doubt that they are true glacial deposits. The same can hardly be said of the curious parallel ridges and furrows which occur as excrescences on the surface of the drift in the immedi ate neighbourhood of North Charlton, and which have frequently been described as 'kaims.' Mr. W. C. Trevelyan, afterwards Sir W. C. Tre velyan, bart., pointed these out to Dr. Buckland in 1821, and the latter described them as a tortuous ridge of gravel, then supposed to be an inexpli-"], [264, "220 ELLINGHAM PARISH. cable work of art. Dr. Buckland, however, after an examination in 1838 of the upper glacier of Grindelwald and that of Rosenlaui, became convinced that the ridge was a lateral moraine, and he directed attention to the stri\u00e6 and other proofs of glacial action found in the district in support of his view.1 But although the land in the neighbourhood of the ridges is now under grass, there is no doubt that a considerable portion of it was formerly under tillage, and the north and south ridges and furrows can fairly be attributed to agricul tural operations. There is, however, a curious series of east and west ridges in a field bordering on the east side of the great north road, nearly opposite North Charlton, which cannot be so easily accounted for. Mr. George Tate2 attributed them to the moulding action of water, but their strict parallelism, and the equal distance at which they stand apart, render it difficult to attribute them to natural agencies. Only two isolated groups of these ridges remain at the present day, which, however, are merely remnants of a once continuous series, for there are evident traces of an intermediate set of similar ridges and furrows which have probably been levelled to supply the stone with which the neighbouring walls are built. If the idea of their natural origin is aban doned it is difficult to see for what purpose they could have been constructed ; and, though various surmises have been indulged in regarding their\" uses in cultivation or otherwise, no really satisfactory explanation of them has, as yet, been given. In many places the drift assumes the form of steep mounds, cut out on one or more of their sides into well-defined terraces. Examples of these are seen at Chathill, Dunstan Hill, and near ' the Grove ' at Charlton hall.3 The terraces on these hills have been attributed to the natural action of rivers and confined bodies of water in the form of lakes, but several facts connected with them are inconsistent with this theory, and tend to support the view that these terraces are also due to tillage. They usually occur only on the east and south sides of the hill, though occasionally they are continued round to the north, when that side is sheltered by neighbouring heights, but they never appear to occur on the west side, which is the quarter exposed to the winds prevalent in the district. Again, there is in no case any indication of a barrier opposite, which would have served to confine the 1 App. i. ' Ibid. 3 These hills are composed of small fragments of stone. The name ' Chat hill ' may refer to this fact. A 'chat' is a small piece of stone. See 'chat,' 'chatter,' Heslop, Northumberland Words."], [265, "ELLINGHAM TOWNSHIP. 221 water at a height sufficient to form the upper terraces ; and, where the ground does rise to any height, no remains are found on it of corresponding terraces. The terraces themselves are not by any means horizontal or parallel to one another, but slope away towards either end, usually merging into a common exit or slanting road. Their composition, also, is against the theory of their aqueous origin ; for, far from being composed of stratified river-sand and gravel, they consist almost entirely of soil. Perhaps the most complete example of such a terraced hillside is that occurring imme diately to the north of 'the Grove' at Charlton hall. Here river-gravel has been obtained from the side of the mound opposite the eastern terraces, but, on inspection, the gravel is seen to be confined to the southern base of the mound, that is, to the channel of the present stream, and facing towards the direction of its source. It seems probable therefore that these terraces are also due to tillage. The drift does not present many other features which require to be noticed, but in some places a purer stratified clay almost free from boulders is found occupying depressions in it. At Chathill, to the east of the railway station, on the boundary of the parish, the clay is employed for the manu facture of tiles, drain pipes, etc., and at Brockley hall, at the opposite extremity of the parish, a similar deposit is utilized for the same purpose. There are examples of recent deposits of peat in the bogs at South Charlton on both sides of the road, at Honeymug bog above Brownyside, and at Pres ton, where a strip of peat runs south towards Doxford hall. ELLINGHAM TOWNSHIP. The township of EUingham, forming the north-western portion of the parish ofthe same name, is bounded by Newham and Newstead upon the north, by the parish of Eglingham on the west, by North Charlton on the south, and by Doxford, Preston, and Chathill upon the east. The township is a large one, having an area of 3,176 acres, and is about three and a. half miles in length from east to west by two miles from north to south.1 At Chathill the main line of the railway passes at the distance of a mile to the north-east 'Census Returns: 1801, 228; 181 1, 221; 1821, 257; 1831, 328; 1841, 270; 1851,313; 1861, 280; 1871, 261 ; 1881, 225 ; 1891, 251."], [266, "ELLINGHAM PARISH. 222 of the village, which is concealed from sight by the plantations and rising ground which intervene. From Chathill the road, passing in a southerly direction through the township of Preston, enters EUingham at the bottom of a deep hollow, where a bridge crosses the burn which has been from time immemorial the boundary between the townships. The stream, now called the Long Nanny, formerly bore the name of the ' meadow burn ' from the fact that it drains a tract of rich meadow land flanked by wooded slopes on either side. Beyond the stream the road, after ascending a hill, reaches the village school-house, where a path branches off through the fields to the right in the direction of the vicarage. Shortly before reaching the vicarage a well or spring will be noticed at the bottom of a hollow spanned by a rude stone foot-bridge. This spring is the well of St. Maurice mentioned in some of the ancient documents connected with the neighbourhood. The well may be approached by a spiral flight of stone steps, and the water in it will be found to be clear and good. After passing St. Maurice's well the footpath rejoins the main road at the vicarage, which stands opposite EUingham hall. The church, hidden by the trees, is to the east, and the few houses which compose the hamlet of EUingham are to the west. EUingham hall, the residence of Sir John Haggerston, bart., is a seventeenth-century house to which various additions have from time to time been made. The central portion resembles in general outline many of the small medi\u00e6val towers which are found in the neighbourhood, at Embleton and elsewhere, but the masonry of which it is composed is not older than that of other parts of the building. The house was probably built in the seventeenth century by the Armorers who then possessed EUingham, and was afterwards enlarged by Edward Haggerston and his wife Mary, whose initials and the date, 1703, appear above the front door. The interior does not present any architectural features deserving special description, but the house contains several family pictures, some of which are portraits of members of the Errington and Charlton families, with whom the Haggerstons have been connected by marriage.1 There are also some antiquities preserved by Sir John Haggerston, amongst which may be men tioned a fifteenth or sixteenth-century bell, at present lying upon the roof. It is said to have hung in a tree near the hall until a few years ago, when it ' There are unfortunately no means of identifying the persons represented."], [267, "ELLINGHAM TOWNSHIP. 223 was placed in its present position. It bears upon a band the inscription elsabeto padsay, with a dragon and a cross moline.1 The west wing of EUingham hall contains a private Roman Catholic chapel, which has been used as a place of worship for almost two hundred years. The Society of Jesus, before its suppression in 1773, had divided Eng land into 'residences,' and in accordance with this scheme Northumberland and Durham were grouped together as the 'residence of St. John the evangelist, or the Durham district.' The 'residences' were further sub divided into 'missions,' one of which was at EUingham, those in the neigh bourhood being at AInwick, Callaly, and Haggerston.2 The priests in residence at EUingham appear to have been usually members of the Society of Jesus, and various facts connected with them have been recorded by the historian of the society.3 From the upper windows of EUingham hall a fine view may be obtained of the surrounding country. Immediately beneath is the garden containing flourishing ilexes, deodars, and Wellingtonias, with a well-grown araucaria. To the north is an avenue of beech trees of unusual size leading in the direction of the Broad wood and Hagg wood, which produced much valuable timber at the beginning of this century, when oak was used as material for the 1 There is no evidence to show whence the bell has come, but it appears from the inscription to have been in the possession of Elizabeth Pudsey, and a Roman Catholic lady of that name died in 1620.

EUingham was the centre of an ancient barony which belonged to the family of Grenville in the reign of Henry I. At the close of the twelfth century the baronv, having passed by marriage into the possession of the Gaugy family,- became known as the barony of Gaugy, and is referred to by that name in the Black Book of the Exchequer and the Testa de Nevill.3 In the last-mentioned record it is stated that the barony comprised EUing ham, 'Osberwic,' Doxford, Cramlington, Heaton, Hartley, Jesmond, and ' Witelawe.'4 The township of Doxford adjoins EUingham on the south-east, the townships of Heaton and Jesmond are in the neighbourhood of New castle-upon-Tyne, and the townships of Cramlington and Hartley are about ten miles north-east of the same place. There are, however, two places mentioned as belonging to the barony which it is not easy to identify, namely, 'Osberwic ' and ' Wytelawe.' The former name is variously spelled Osberwic, Oseberwyk,5 or Osburgh Wike,6 and the place is described in an ancient deed, preserved in the Durham Treasury, as a 'hamlet ' of EUingham,7 that is to say, a parcel of land adjacent and subordinate to the manor of EUingham. From documents, which will be subsequently referred to, it is evident that the resi dence of the owners of the barony of EUingham was originally situated at Osberwic, and it is natural to suppose that the land surrounding Osberwic was demesne land. It is also evident that the Gaugys in the early years of the thirteenth century quitted their old residence, and constructed a new one which was subsequently known as the ' Newbigginge ' or Newstead.8 A member of the Gaugy family was residing at the ' Newbigginge ' in or about the year 1230, when he received permission to have a private chapel there, and the Cliffords, who succeeded the Gaugys, continued to reside at the same place, and were therefore known as the Cliffords 'del Newstead.' It is, how ever, noticeable that no mention is made of Newstead in the Testa de Nevill, although the name occurs more than once in the Hundred Rolls which were 1 Sir John Haggerston shot a fine specimen of the Great Bittern (Botaurus Stellaris) in the Broad wood on January 19th, 1885. 2 Liber Niger Scaccarii ; Hodgson, Northd.

It therefore appears probable that the ancient vill or hamlet of Osberwic became merged in Newstead, and that the name of Newstead subsequently replaced that of Osberwic, just as the name Newtown was substituted for that of Warenmouth, the port of Bamburgh.2 The hypothesis that the two places are practically identical is corroborated in various ways. If the name was changed in the thirteenth century it is probable that the older name was afterwards occasionally used, and this will be found to have been the case.3 Again it has been already mentioned that the demesne land of the Gaugys and their successors must have been at Osberwic, and it will be found that there are abundant traces of ancient demesne lands at Newstead on the map of that place made in 1620 ;4 more over Newstead was stated to be 'all in demesne' in the year 1676.5 There can then be little doubt that Newstead represents Osberwic, but there is no direct evidence to show the exact site of the more ancient vill. On the whole it is probable that the name Oseburghwik survives in a corrupted form in the word Rosebrough, which is the name of a farm adjoining Newstead.6 Wytelawe, the other site included in the barony, cannot be identified with certainty, but it appears to have been a farm of moderate extent, and is defined in one document, dated 1421, as a hamlet ofthe manor of Cramling ton. The farm known as White Hall farm, in the township of Cramlington, in every respect corresponds with the description, and may be identified with Wytelawe.7 It will be seen that the barOny was naturally divided into two portions, of which EUingham, Osberwic, and Doxford composed the northern half, whilst the southern half was composed of Cramlington, Witelawe, Heaton, Jesmond, and Hartley. The barony of EUingham was granted by Henry I. to Nicholas de Grenville, to be held by the service of three knight's fees, and he was in possession ofthe barony in the year 1135, when Henry I. died.\" From what 1 Rot.

Most of the facts which can be gathered concerning Nicholas and his immediate successors are recorded in a number of original deeds, to which their seals are still attached, preserved in the Treasury at Durham.1 These deeds show that the Grenvilles were both wealthy and munificent, and conferred great benefits upon the convent of Durham. The series of deeds begins with one by which Nicholas de Grenville gave the church of EUingham and the land appertaining to it to St. Cuthbert and his monks. At the same time he gave to St. Cuthbert a carucate of land in Cramlington with three tofts, four perches in width and twenty feet in length, thirty acres of arable land in the same place with a proportionate amount of pasture, and a fishery on the Tyne called 'Bradayere.'2 The gift is stated to have been made by Nicholas de Grenville on behalf of the souls of himself, his wife, his father and mother, his nephew William de Grenville, and all his relations. Amongst the wit nesses are Hugh and Robert, nephews of Nicholas de Grenville's wife, Anschet and Ralph, nephews of William de Grenville, ' all the best and wisest men of Cramlington,' and many others.3 Attached to the deed is an oval seal,4 upon which is a device representing an animal like a panther galloping to the left.

The deed is attested by the donor's wife Emma, and by many men from each of the places which composed the southern half of his barony, namely, Jesmond, Heaton, Cramlington, and Hartley.2 William de Grenville appears to have died before 1 158,3 and at his death the EUingham barony was divided between his two sisters, Mabel the wife of Ralph de Gaugy, and another whose name is not mentioned, the wife of Hugh de Ellington, knight. Ralph de Gaugy, who, by virtue of his marriage with Mabel de Gren ville, inherited a moiety of the barony, appears to have belonged to a family of foreign origin, though there is no evidence to show whence it sprang. The name is spelled in various ways, but there is not any place which bears a name resembling Gaugy, unless it be the village of Chauche in La Vendee. It is evident, however, that the family of Ralph de Gaugy, though its origin is now lost, was not less rich and liberal than that of Grenville. There is still extant at Durham a deed of Ralph de Gaugy, addressed to 'all barons and his friends and the men of the holy man's folk,4 French and English.' The deed records that Ralph de Gaugy gave the church of EUingham to the convent of Durham with the consent of Ralph his heir, on behalf of the souls of the donor's wife and other relatives. The deed bears Ralph de Gaugy's autograph mark in the shape of a cross, which appears to have been made with labour and difficulty. Attached to the deed is an oval seal, deeply 1 Durham Treas. 4,a 2de Spec. No. 9. 2 Durham Treas. ima 3cic Spec. No. 32. Cf. Feodanum Prioratus Dunelmensis, Surt. Soc. p. 104, note. ' Testibus istis, Emma uxor mea, . . . et multis aliis hominibus de Gesemuthe et de Hetthona et de Cramlingatuna et de Hertalalve.' 3 This date is fixed by the fact that Hugh de Puiset confirmed the church of EUingham, the gift of Ralph de Gaugy, in the possession of the prior and convent of Durham, by means of a letter addressed to Absalon the prior. Absalon is known to have died before n 58, and Ralph de Gaugy must therefore have been in possession of EUingham before that date.

The seal bears the inscription frange l[ege] tege secreta.2 Hugh de Puiset, . bishop of Durham, subsequently addressed a letter to Absalon the prior, in which he informed him that Ralph de Gaugy had ratified the gift in his pre sence by placing a curved knife upon the altar of St. Cuthbert.3 Although neither the deed of Ralph de Gaugy nor the confirmation of Bishop Hugh bears any date, they must both have been executed before the year 1158, when Absalon the prior died. Shortly after the death of Absalon it was found desirable to define the terms of Ralph de Gaugy's gift more pre cisely, and Bishop Hugh wrote to Germanus the prior, who was appointed to that office in 1163, stating at greater length the conditions on which the gift was made.4 As the terms of the original grant were in some respects modified by the subsequent confirmations, Ralph de Gaugy personally ratified the arrangements of Bishop Hugh, Prior Absalon, and the, convent of Dur ham by a deed to which a seal is attached.5 Upon the seal is a device repre senting a bird with wings displayed and head nimbed.

The wardship of the heir was given to William de Vesci, who rendered account of thirty shillings in 1 1 66 for the land of Ralph de Gaugy then in his possession.1 About the same time Henry II. confirmed Vesci in the possession of the whole fee of Ralph de Gaugy, 'namely, Elingeham and Docheseffordam (Doxford), and Osberwyc and Hactonam (Heaton).'2 In the discharge of his duties as guardian of the heir William de Vesci was called upon to confirm Ralph de Gaugy's gift of the church of EUingham.3 In 1 167 Ralph de Gaugy was still a minor, and his guardian spent forty seven shillings in that year in stocking Hartley, 'the land of Ralph de Gaugy,' with 8 oxen, 1 horse, and 60 sheep.4 In the following year, however, Gaugy, then of age, took the management of the estate into his own hands, and dis charged some of the obligations incumbent upon it.5 At the same time, in common with other barons, he was called upon to draw up a short report on the history ofhis barony to be delivered to Henry II. In this document he states that in the time of Henry I. his ancestors had held their fee by the service of three knights, and had enfeoffed a certain knight named Galon with the fourth part of a knight's fee. Subsequently the barony had been divided between two sisters, of whom the eldest was Ralph de Gaugy's mother. He therefore had inherited a knight's fee and a half, for all of which he rendered service except for half the land given to Galon, namely, the eighth part of a knight's fee. He had not himself given away any land, but his aunt, the wife of Hugh de Ellington, had enfeoffed Ralph Baard with the sixth part and Gilbert de Hetton with the twelfth part of a knight's fee.6 Hugh de Elling ton, the owner of the other half of the barony, was called upon to make a 1 ' Idem vicecomes [Willelmus de Vesci] reddit compotum de xxxB de terra Radulphi de Calgi quam ipse tenet.'

He stated that he held half the barony which had belonged to William de Grenville, which William's- predecessor, namely, Nicholas de Grenville, had held at the time of the death of Henry I. A portion of the barony was still in the possession of William de Grenville 's widow, for which she made acknowledgment to Hugh de Ellington. The portion held in dower, with the eighth part of a fee held by Galon, amounted together to half a fee, and Hugh de Ellington had granted half a fee to his two daughters, who had married Ralph Baard and Robert de Bulmer. He therefore retained only half a fee in his own possession.1 The division of the barony was not permanent, and Mabel de Gaugy lived to see the whole of the three fees re-united in the person of her son, in the year 1181.2 Shortly afterwards her son died, and in 1187 Roger de Glanville the sheriff made a payment 'for the gift of the lands of Ralph de Caugi,'3 and in 1191 it is stated that Ralph son of Main owed forty marks 'for the wardship of the heirs of Ralph de Gaugy.'4 Ralph son of Main appears to have received the wardship before the earldom of Northumber land was made over on the 25th of November, 1 189, to Bishop Hugh de Puiset.5 In consequence of this arrangement Bishop Hugh took all the pro duce ofthe earldom into his own hands, and amongst other profits he enjoyed the revenues of the Gaugy barony.6 In 1 195 Ralph son of Main made a small payment that he might be released from the compact into which he had entered, as the bishop had received all the profits of the wardship.7 In the same year the heir, Ralph de Gaugy, grandson of Mabel de Gaugy, attained full age, and paid sixty marks as relief for the three fees of his barony.8 Ralph de Gaugy, the third of that name, was in possession of the barony from 1 195 until 1243, and various payments made by him in connection with his estate are entered upon the accounts of that period. In 1201 he paid as scutage, and \u00a36 for the expedition to Poitou in 12 13, that being the amount assessed on the three knight's fees of the barony.

The prior appears to have built a new mill which Philip regarded as an infringement of his rights, and it was said that the prior would not allow his men to use Philip's mill. The dispute was temporarily settled on the 6th of February, 1279, by the renunciation on the part of Philip of any right to enforce suit of mill from the prior's men ;6 but the 1 Testa de Nevill; Hodgson, Northd.

The latter complained in 1292 that the prior and Walter de Tuggal had diverted the water from his mill, and had set up a mill themselves, so that the men who had used Alexander's mill had deserted it in favour of the prior's mill. The matter was not finally settled until the following year.1 Ralph de Gaugy IV. died in the year 12 79/ and Thomas de Norman ville, the king's escheator, was directed to take possession of his lands until they could be delivered to the heir after homage had been rendered.3 But on enquiry being made it was found that Adam, the eldest son of Ralph de Gaugy, was a leper, and unable to come into the king's presence, and Thomas de Normanville was thereupon deputed to receive from him the oath of fealty and a reasonable relief.4 Adam, the leper, however died almost immediately after his father, and Robert de Clifford, a distant cousin of the deceased man, was called upon to discharge these obligations.6 Some evidence, given in a lawsuit in the year 1304, throws light on the connection which existed between the Clifford and Gaugy families.

Robert de Meryng, the plaintiff in the case, appears to have been a descendant of Roger de Meryng, who has already been mentioned as the owner of Doxford.1 Meryng, in order to prove his claim, was called upon to set forth the pedigree of Clifford and himself, and he stated that Adam de Gaugy the leper had a younger brother Ralph de Gaugy, who had a son of the same name. The latter likewise had a son, also named Ralph de Gaugy, who died childless. The inheritance then reverted to two sisters of Adam the leper, namely, Alice and Mabel. Meryng alleged that he was the great grandson of Alice the elder sister, and that Robert de Clifford was the great grandson of the younger sister Mabel. Meryng and Clifford were therefore, according to Meryng's statement, co-heirs to the Gaugy barony, and each was entitled to one moiety. Robert de Clifford, however, had obtained possession of the whole estate, and Meryng sought to reverse this. Robert de Clifford in his reply to Meryng's argument did not object to the plaintiff's statements except in respect to Mabel, who, according to Clifford, was the sister of the father of Ralph de Gaugy who died childless. If this statement was true Clifford was entitled to the whole of the estate as next of kin, but Meryng denied the truth of Clifford's assertion, and stated that Ralph de Gaugy, father of the deceased man, had not any sister named Mabel. There is unfortunately no record of the decision arrived at in connection with the case, and there is some reason to suppose that the facts were not accurately stated by either party. If the statement of Meryng is accepted, it is difficult to believe that he was of full age in 1304, being the great-great-grandson of a man who died in or about 1279, whilst the statement of Robert de Clifford is still more incredible. It is evident that doubts existed at that time in regard to some links in the pedigree, and it is probable that mistakes had arisen from the continuance of the same name through several generations of the Gaugys.

Adam de Gaugy, the leper, died in 1279, and Robert de Clifford was im mediately afterwards found to be in occupation of his estate.1 The new owner of the barony of EUingham belonged to a family of knightly rank in which the name Robert had been transmitted from father to son for several generations. In the early years of the thirteenth century the family was settled at Murton near Orde in Islandshire, and at some time between the years 1207 and 12 17 Henry de Orde transferred to Philip de Ulcotes the services due from Robert de Clifford for the vill of Murton.2 The heirs of Philip de Ulcotes subse quently gave their interest in these services to the convent of Durham,3 and after further negotiations Henry de Orde, who had been cast into prison and was anxious to obtain means of release, sold to the prior and convent 'all the homage and service of Robert de Clifford ' for the sum of one hundred and five marks.4 There is nothing in these passages whereby the special member of the Clifford family referred to can be identified, but it appears probable that he was the husband of Mabel de Gaugy. It may have been his son or grandson who was ordered by Bishop Walter de Kirkham to do homage to the prior and convent for a moiety of Murton on the 23rd of seisitus de integro predictorum tenementorum cum pertinenciis in dominico suo ut de feodo et jure tempore pacis, tempore domini Henrici regis patris domini regis nunc, capiendo inde explec' ad valen- ciam, etc., et qui nuper obiit, etc., et de ipso Radulfo descendit jus, etc., de integro predictorum tenementorem cuidam Ade ut filio et heredi, et de ipso Adam, quia obiit sine herede de se descendit jus, etc., cuidam Radulfo ut fratri et heredi, et de ipso Radulfo descendit jus, etc., cuidam Radulfo ut filio et heredi.

April, 1 25 1.1 The homage seems to have been duly rendered, as Robert de Clifford was soon afterwards discharging the duties of sheriff of Norhamshire, a post of some importance in the palatinate at that time.2 The new owner of Ellingham appears from these passages to have belonged to a family which was gradually becoming prominent. In 1292, after Robert de Clifford had been owner of the barony for twelve years, a survey was made of Ellingham. It was found that Robert de Gray and his wife Margaret held one-third of the manor from Robert de Clif ford, and that there were numerous other small proprietors.3 At the time when the survey was made Eva, the widow of Adam de Gaugy the leper, was still living, and in 1292 she brought an action against Robert de Clifford for the recovery of some land in Ellingham and Osberwic as her dower, but the action failed on the ground that Adam de Gaugy, her husband, had never been admitted to formal possession of the estate.4 Four years later a subsidy was levied on the inhabitants of Ellingham, in connection with which the following list was drawn up : Osburghwyk.

From this list it appears that Robert de Clifford and Robert Gray, to whom he had granted one-third of the manor, were living at Osberwic, which has been already identified with Newstead. Tinely, where Alexander de Newton and William de Hesselington were living, is a farm on the borders of EUingham and Doxford. Simon de Walmeden, whose name also occurs on the list, derived his name from the Alden or Walden burn, which is men tioned in some of the most ancient deeds connected with the church. Adam de Walmden, possibly a relative of Simon, is described as a chaplain in a deed by which he transferred to the prior and convent of Durham his interest in four tofts in EUingham, which lay on the south side of a mill pond, and seven acres appertaining to the tofts. He also conveyed to the prior and convent four acres in the field called Sunnildisflat, eighteen acres in a field called Etherisley, of which half was arable and half meadow, and more than six acres of waste between the 'red road and the limestone quarry.'1 By a deed, which may be assigned to the same period, Robert de Clifford granted certain concessions to the monks of Durham by making over to them his rights in a water-course after it left his mills at EUingham, in order that they might divert it on to their own land, by directing its course towards their mill pond near the chapel of St. Mary.

Not long after these transactions took place Robert de Clifford asked for the royal license to settle a portion of his estate upon his son Robert and his wife Elizabeth, daughter of John de Vaux. The license having been granted, in 1306 he settled upon his son a house at EUingham, fourteen tofts, one hundred and sixty-nine acres of arable land, sixteen acres of meadow, and twenty acres of wood. This estate was estimated to be worth a hundred and six shillings a year, and it was stated that Robert de Clifford, the father, con tinued to retain in his own hands the remainder of EUingham and the manor of Murton near Norham.1 Robert de Clifford the son, who in this way received an estate at EUing ham during his father's lifetime, had, by his wife Elizabeth de Vaux, three sons, Robert, John, and Thomas. Of these the eldest son, Robert, married Elena, daughter of John de Chilton, who appears to have acquired the manor of Murton near Norham between the years 1306 and 1328. On Wednesday, November 16th, 1328, John de Chilton ford after his marriage to his daughter panied the settlement, remainder was EUingham, the grandfather, to John settled Murton upon Robert de Clif- Elena.

One of the family at this time had incurred the royal displeasure, and it is possible that a confiscation was feared if the estates were permitted to descend from father to son in the usual manner.1 In the meantime Robert de Clifford, the husband of Elizabeth de Vaux, had parted with some of the property which his father had given to him in EUing ham, by conveying it to Richard de Emeldon, the merchant of Newcastle, in 1324.2 Robert de Clifford the grandfather died in 1339,3 when it was found that he had not held any lands 'in demesne as of fee' in Northumberland or else where, but he had held the manor of EUingham and land in Osberwick by grant from Michael de Presfen, except fourteen tofts and other lands which he had settled in his lifetime on his son Robert. The deed of entail relating o to the residue of the estate was then rehearsed, and John de Clifford, aged eighteen, was declared to be the heir, his brother Robert having died during his grandfather's lifetime. A few particulars were added as to the condition ofthe estate, which was held 'by the service of one-fourth part ofa barony.' The manor house was in a ruinous condition ; and a third part of the ninety-one acres which composed the demesne land had been sown with seed at the winter sowing.

There were forty acres of wood, free from undergrowth, of some value for feeding swine. The moorland and a piece of separate pasture upon it were worth eleven shillings. At Osberwick 'an appurtenance ofthe manor,' there were seven tofts and seven bovates of arable land (each bovate contain ing twelve acres) in the hands of tenants at will, who paid seventy shillings a year. There were five cottar holdings worth twenty shillings. The per quisites of the manor court were worthless on account of the poverty of the tenants and the damage done by the Scots.1 It is evident from this survey that EUingham had not escaped the numerous Scottish raids which took place after the departure of Edward III. for France in the year 1338. The king had left the management of affairs relating to Scotland in the hands of deputies, whose inactivity was in marked contrast to the renewed zeal of the partisans of David Brus.2 Robert de Clifford, father of John de Clifford the new owner of EUing ham, had died before his son succeeded to the property, and his widow Elizabeth assisted her son in the management of his affairs until he attained full age. Owing to the Scottish depredations and the poverty of the estate, the tithes due to the prior and convent of Durham fell into arrear, and it became necessary to provide means for payment of a portion of the debt. John de Clifford and his mother therefore granted a lease of Sunderland wood near EUingham to the convent of Durham for twelve years from Lammas day (August ist), 1342. The wood began at 'le suth corner' at a spot called 'le Aken buske,' marked by a ditch running westward, between 'le Hagg'3 and 1 ' Robertus de Clifford del Newested nullas terras tenuit in dominico suo ut intelligunt, sed dicunt quod idem Robertus tenuit ad terminum vite sue die quo obiit, ex concessione Michaelis de Presfen, manerium de Ellingeham simul cum quibusdam tenementis subscriptis in Osberwike, eidem manerio pertinentibus, exceptis i messuagio, 14 toftis, 169 acris terre, 16 acris prati, 16 acris bosci in eodem manerio, de domino rege in capite, ut de corona, per servicium quarte partis unius baronie.

Notwithstanding the careful discharge of his obligations with regard to tithes, Clifford was soon afterwards involved in a dispute with the prior and convent about rights of common of pasture on the moors of EUingham and Osberwick, 'the hamlet of EUingham.'

This portion was subsequently conveyed to John Heron.2 John de Clifford himself continued to reside at Newstead where his ancestors had lived, and on the 29th of June, 1347, he granted a certain annual portion of grain from his manor of Newstead to the friars of Hulne.3 By a deed dated in the same year he remitted to the abbot and convent of AInwick the homage and fealty due for a piece of land in EUingham called 'Brentehall fielde,' which they had received by the gift of Adam de EUing ham.4 In 1349 John de Clifford was sheriff of Northumberland,5 being at that time about twenty-eight years of age.

Brentehall field was probably at Tinely, where a parcel of land still bears the name of 'abbey lands.' Sir David Smith, in some manuscript notes, says that two fields to the east of Tinely are called 'the abbey lands,' and are tithe free. More than 2,000 loads of stones were removed from one of the fields, 'most of them flat and laid as if for a flagged pavement, but no vestige of the foundations of buildings were discovered. At no great distance from the place was a large stone cross. ... On the farm east of the house and east of the lane which goes down from Tinely to Doxford, on the field adjoining the lane, are the remains of a small barrow. Another, much less, situated in the next field, was conveyed away at the same time as the abbey lands were improved, and underneath it was found an earthen vase of common pottery, but ornamented with devices, of size sufficient to hold 6 or 8 gallons, and it was full of human bones.'

The apparently unprovoked murder of so prominent a man was an unpardonable crime, and Clifford and his associates, having been declared to be rebels, suffered confiscation of tbeir estates. The murder appears to have taken place on December 20th, 1362, at Bolton Moor,2 and on the 10th of February, 1366, all the lands of John de Clifford were granted to Joan de Coupland, the widow of the murdered man, as compensation for the death of her husband whilst engaged in the king's service.3 Six years after the date of this grant leave was given to Joan de Coup land to convey the manors of EUingham and Newstead to Sir Richard Arundell in trust for herself for life, with remainder to Sir John Arundell his brother.4 Sir John Arundell died in 1379, when it was found that he had conveyed EUingham and Newstead to trustees two years before his death.6 Through these trustees a portion of EUingham appears to have come into the hands of John Heron of Thornton, and subsequently of Sir Robert Har bottle.6 Other portions of the estate came into the possession of Sir Robert Ogle and the earl of Northumberland.7 1 Regist.

The marriage settlement dated the 14th of June, 1424, stipulated that the costs of the ceremony should be defrayed by Sir Robert Ogle, and that Dame Isabella and the bridegroom should settle all their lands in EUingham on the offspring of the marriage. The marriage was to take place within forty days after the betrothal, and Sir Robert Ogle, the father of the bride, promised to give the bridegroom ten pounds of gold before the ceremony.1 This dowry was afterwards increased, according to a deed dated 24th of August, 1424, by the gift of a piece of land, one acre in length and three half acres in width, at the 'netherend' ofthe 'Doufhyll' in the fields of EUingham, near the stream by the church, for the erection of a fulling mill, together with the right of cutting a water-course from the Walden burn2 through Prynscroft. Sir Robert Ogle also promised to give jjke bridegroom an estate at Newstead, until the receipts yielded fifty-five marks clear, or until that sum was paid. It was also stipulated that Sir Robert Ogle should keep and maintain his daughter and a damsel to wait on her constantly in his 'hostell,' with his son-in-law and his valet or other servant, together with their horses, when they came to visit him ; the bride, on her part, was to find her own vesture and attire.3 Four days later William 1 ' Cest endenture tesmoigne que accorde est et assentie Robert de Ogle et John Bartram chivalers, d'un parte, et Dame Isabell, qui fuist la feme Robert Herbotell, esquier, qui mort est, et Robert Herbotell, fitz et heire de dit Robert, d'autre part, que le dit Robert le fitz espousera et a feme prendra Margerie file de dit Robert de Ogle, quel maryage sera fait as costage le dit Robert de Ogle a certen temps et iour pour estre assignes et limites per lez ditz parties; et lez ditz dame Isabell et Robert le fitz ferront estre fait seure estate en ley as ditz Robert le fitz et Margerie, et a lez heires de corps dit Robert engendreres, des touts les terres, molyns, et possessions ove lez appurtenancez en Elyngham, quels furront le dit Robert le pier, et ceo deins quarront iours aprez ditz espousels celebrees, reversion et remayndrerent al dit Robert le fitz as sez heires et assignes entapaynes.

The survey is as follows : The bounder of EUingham, with the severall groundes therof.

Amongst the Duke of Northumberland's MSS. there are some documents connected with the administration of the EUingham estate at the end of the fifteenth century. In 1479/80 the sum of 20s. 2d. was paid to Thomas Forster 'nuper de Edyrstan, juniori' in return for his good services as bailiff of EUingham. There is also a rental for the year 1498. The following is a translation of the first sentence : 'Thomas French took of the lord a messuage and ij husband lands there, to be held for the term of 6 years, by warranty [plegium] of Edmund Preson and Henry- Browne, and pays yearly xxviii8.' The other tenants named on the rental are : Henry Browne, Edmund Preson, Richard Preson, John Thewe, Thomas Wodcok, William Thewe, John Allan, John Rome, Elizabeth Forster. At the end of the rental is the note: 'omnes tenentes predicti reddunt domino annuatim pro pastura habenda in le Lawfeld, alias vocato Warnerlawe, per plegium alter alterius, vj8 viij''.'

The water mill was part ofthe possessions ofthe Lady Elioner Percy, one ofthe co-heiresses of Sir Ralph Harbottell. The church was covered with lead and in good repair in all respects, with a cemetery containing half an acre of land by estimate. On the east of the church was some land called 'Set. Mowres wood' and 'le kirke crofte.' Attached to the vicarage were three husbandlands called 'le glebe lande,' and all the tenants had the right of grazing their cattle in 'le laire feilde' and 'the heighe comon more.' There was also a house in the tenure of William Atkinson, without any garden or croft attached, in which in times past the lord's court had been held.4] Adjoyninge to this towne of Ellingeham on yB northe side thereof ys y\" woode of EUingham,5 whiche lyeth open and not enclosed, wherin as well all y\" tenants as also y\" inhabitors of Ellingeham have hade tyme oute of memory comone and pasture ; nevertheless where any freholder ther hathe anie parcell of inherytaunce, wherin any spring of woode ys, the same ys by them enclosed to ther best commodetie, wherfore it is nedeful to be knowen whether my lord by lawe maye enclose y\u00b0 same and converse yt to his owne commoditie or not, or at y\" least cause y* same wood to be enclosed, and then fell all suche wood as ys nedefull to be cut downe to his lordshipp's tennants theraboute, y\" other to remayne and so to be hayned,6 whiche shold be to his lordshipp's and his heirs no small profett and to his lordshipp's said tennants nothinge hurtfull.

They attributed their poverty to the poor qualitv of the ground, but the surveyor suggested that the true causes were their hatred of one another, continual thefts, and the fact that they were 'over runne with gentlemen planted nowe amongst them.' The meaning of the latter phrase is obscure, but it is possible that some of the earl's friends or officers had been placed at EUingham to protect the village from the continual raids which then pre vailed. Ralph Grey of Horton went to live at the neighbouring village of Embleton during this period, in order to afford the protection of his presence to the people of that place. Whilst he was there he utilised the time and labour of the tenants in building for himself a substantial house, and the tenants, as they received no remuneration, became greatly impoverished. It is possible that the people of EUingham were exposed to similar abuses, and it is probable that the continual loss of cattle and goods had discouraged them from attempting to earn a livelihood. The great damage sustained by the whole of the neighbourhood through the raids of cattle stealers will be best illustrated by some extracts from official reports.2 The following report relates to the year 1573 : A colleccon of certaine spoyles comytted by the Scotts upon the tenents of the right hon. the earle of Northumberland synce the xvilb yere of her majesty's raigne,3 whereby they are in greate decaye of horse and armor, hetherto havinge no redress for theire said spoyles.

After the execution of Thomas Percy, seventh earl of Northumberland, on the 22nd of August, 1572, the manor of EUingham escheated to the Crown, and was not restored to the Percy family with the rest of their estates. For several years the place was granted on lease to various tenants, one of whom was Arthur Creswell. By a clause in his lease it was stipulated that he should provide a horse and armour for every tenant, that he should protect the village with a strong hedge, and provide every farmhold or tenement with an able man. These clauses appear to have been inserted in the lease for the protection of the people of the district, but they in some measure failed to produce the desired effect, as Creswell almost ruined his under-tenants by exacting heavy fines, perhaps in order to discharge the obligations imposed upon him. After Creswell's lease had expired, EUingham was placed 'under the rule ' of Ralph Harbottle, a member of a younger branch of the Harbottle family, who has been referred to in the letter of Robert Helme as a 'proper youth,' who was about to make an imprudent marriage. No formal lease appears to have been granted to him, but EUingham was placed under his general supervision. The unprotected state of the Border at this time was causing serious anxiety to the royal officials, and a searching enquiry was instituted in order to ascertain the true condition of all the villages and the number of armed men in them. The following extract from the report refers to EUingham and the villages in the neighbourhood.

In a few cases the tenants complained of the conduct of landlords or lessees, and in one instance they said that they had received no compensation for the damage done by a Scottish raid. At South Charlton, however, where this complaint was made, the state of the tenants was comparatively good, as six out ofthe total number of fifteen were 'furnished.' In consequence ofthe unsatisfactory nature of the report a more searching enquiry was made in 1584. The officials appointed to make the examination were required to classify the men more minutely, and to state in detail what weapons each man had. The report was on the whole more favourable. At EUing ham, for instance, where there was no tenant equipped in 1579, there were four men armed with a jack, spear, and steel cap, and ten footmen armed 1 See vol. i. p. 291.

William Armorer's son and afterwards of his grandson, as appears from the evidence of an old man, who was examined as a witness in a lawsuit on the 28th of May, 1708. His deposition is as follows : 'Robert Edington of New ham, yeoman, aged 75 years, says that when he first knew EUingham, it was in the possession of William Armorer, father of William Armorer ; after whose death the same was held by William Armorer his son, and after his death by Robert Armorer his son, until he sold the same to the defendant (Edward Haggerston) about six years ago.'1 From the depositions of other witnesses examined in the same suit it appears that William Armorer, senior, enclosed a portion of EUingham Moor with a stone wall in the year 1653, when Gilbert Davye was vicar of the parish. This enclosure was an infringement on the rights of all the freeholders whose consent had not been obtained, and was a manifest breach of the ancient agreement by which John de Clifford had confirmed to the prior and convent of Durham the right to pasture cattle throughout EUingham Moor.2 William Armorer, senior, died before 1675, and Lancelot Dobson, who had succeeded Davye as vicar, attempted to make some compromise with his son. It was temporarily arranged that Dobson should receive an allotment of seventy acres in lieu of common rights, but after an interval of a year and a half the chapter of Durham refused to sanc tion the compromise. Dobson thereupon continued to enjoy his right of pasture throughout the moor until the year 1687, when Armorer began to for my smal worldlie goods, I give them whollie to my brother William Nutton, his two doughters Beillie Nutton, wife to William Eddingtonne in Newhame, Margaret Nutton, hir sister in Ellingheme, of all I have two cyen [sic], of the which I leave the hawket cowe to William Eddingtonne his wife.

In the following year William Armorer, junior, died,1 and was succeeded by hisson Robert, who not only refused to sanction the old agreement but would not listen to any of the vicar's proposals. Dobson, being an old man of small means and in a weak state of health, felt himself unable to maintain the contest without assistance. He therefore entered into correspondence with Mr. Morton, a member of the chapter of Durham, with the view of procuring his help. Dobson wrote from Chillingham on the nth of June, 1690, to Morton as follows: Syr, had your anger been as deep rooted as I finde your friendship, then had I been more miserable than now I accompt my seise happy in haveing soe potent an advocate with the rest of my rever\" patrons. This informacons, though the cause some times of trouble and charge, yet afterwards may produce greater favours amongst wise men, when the truth is known. You have viewed the supposed trespass, in recompenc, for an attonement, on Monday next I have ordered the workmen to hedg in two acres of ground allready sprung 2 yards high,2 and, when the beasts have cropped, I have ordered them to be cut and fenced till they be past all danger ; neither shall they be touched during my life, and as soone as I can agree with the tennants, who have a lease, I shall spring more if you require it, with such care that the growth shall not be such refuse as is allreadye cutt.s Syr, seeing I consent to whatever you will require, I hope you will order your attorney to send a discharg to the sheriff and bayliffs, and think allsoe of sending a letter to Mr. Armourer, either to confirme the old division or make a new one, els you will assist me in throwing down his inclosures upon the common, for upon the word of a prest, the costs at law with his father and the loss of the benefit which might have accrued upon the confirmation of that division, made by consent, amount to above ,\u00a3400 (soe prejudiciall to me and the church was Cartwright's picque).4 Syr, might I be favoured with a letter from you per Belford post, it would be a great obligation to The humblest of your servants, Lanclt.

Raine, Testamenta. This inventory is not now at Durham, and no wills of the Armorers of EUingham can be found at the Probate Registry. The only notices of this family in the EUingham registers are : '9 June, 1696, Ann dau. ofMr Robert Armorer bap.' '21 March, 1695/6, William son of Mr Robert Armorer bur.' '14 Sept., 1696, Ann dau. of Mr Robert Armorer bur.' ' 21 Aug., 1698, Robert son of Mr Robert Armorer bap.' 2 The following note refers to Dobson's enclosure and plantation, which he appears to have substituted for the old wood called Maurice wood : 'EUingham, Julii 16th, '90. We, the curate & churchwardens of EUingham doe hereby certifie that Mr Dobson hath newly fenced thre sides of a parcell of ground, whereon there is a new spring of oakes growne 3 and 4 yards high ; and is ready to carry the fence further, if it be thought requisite ; but he is perswaded to stop because the oakes there and in the ground next adjoyning are allready sprung up past all danger of being cropped. There be growing there many more than were in Maurice wood, and if not cut will infinitely be better : this to be done : witnesse our hands, Ja. Basken, curat. Robert Atkinson, Geor. Morison.' Hunter MSS. vu. No. 203. Maurice wood had produced fine timber in the sixteenth century. On the Sth Sept., 1551, the dean and chapter granted a lease of certain houses in Holy Island. It was stipulated that the lessee should repair trie houses 'in all manner of reparacions, except great timber, which the said dean and chapter shall find to be taken within their woods of EUingham, called St. Maurice wood.' Raine, North Durham, p. 160. 3 Dobson seems to have incurred the anger of some of his patrons by felling trees on the glebe in Maurice wood. Dobson says that Maurice wood was ' refuse,' and the curate's certificate states that tne vicar's new plantation would soon be better than the old wood. 4 Dobson appears to allude to the fact that the dean and chapter had refused to sanction the compromise. 6 Hunter MSS. vii. No. 200."], [306, "260 ELLINGHAM PARISH. the records connected with the living, and he discovered that in times past the glebe had suffered from similar encroachments. Writing on the 17th of Julv, 1690, Dobson savs: 'Once Mr. Dean, upon examination ofthe vicarage endowment in the registry bv Johannes1 and Margaretta2 de Greenvilla, ordered Mr. Adamson to begin a suit, but it came to nothing. But if my reverend patrons will be pleased again to examine the grant, they will find I enjoy not a third part of what was given.3 All lost carelessly, and I doubt not past recovery, so that there is reason to look carefully to what is left, else ill men will be pinching on all hands.'4 In the summer of the following year the state of affairs was still unaltered, and Dobson describes the deadlock which had ensued in another letter to Morton. This letter, like the previous one, is dated from Chilling ham, and it appears therefore that Dobson, like many of the clergy at that time, was not a resident in the parish of which he was incumbent : Chillingham, May 4 [i6]gi. Reverend Sir, No sooner hath God enabled me to get out of my bed, but though with a weak arm, where the gout this time seised me, I give you this short account of my proceedings with Mr Armourer, heretofore my seeming kind friend, but now my enraged enemy : for, by letters pressing him to chuse arbitrators, in order either to confirm the old division made by his father or make a new agreement both about the common and also the pretended modus for hay tithe of EUingham and Preston, he at the last consented to a meeting on Thursday in Easter week, but when four men met about it, he would not suffer his party so much as treat about the legality or equity of it, but pretended that, if his father made any such agreement, he understood not himself. Neither would he consent that 1 should have any interest in the common, although his father consented to join 60 acres to the glebe in lieu thereof, nor pay any more than a pretended modus for the hay tithe, though his father gave 10 acres more upon that consideration, in all 70 acres. Truly, sir, the accomplishing the former agreement, in suit and otherwise, made me part with ,\u00a320 per annum of my wife's jointure ; yet it proved lost by the dean and chapter's unkindness to confirm it, which would have been more advantage to the church in future than possibly it can prove to me, and I perceive Mr Armourer confides on some or other in the chapter still to oppose their rigorous assistance before I die, but I hope you will take it into your more serious consideration than suffer the church's interest thus forcibly to be opprest. I sued Mr Armourer for the hay for which he agreed, and stopped him on the common from ploughing for which he also agreed, but now I am as infirm and poor as then I was active and had money. ... I enjoyed the former agreement a year and a half, but lost it when the chapter refused their consent, after which I enjoyed the moore in common till the year before Mr Armourer died, when again he enclosed and I hindered him (about four years gone), and then he appointed a meeting for a new agreement, but died before we got it ended ; but now his son will hear of no agreement, but encloseth apace all what I and my tenants enjoyed in common. . . . I am, sir, your most faithful servant, Lancelot Dobson.5 1 A mistake for ' Nicholas.' 2 A mistake for ' Mabel.' 3 The boundaries of the glebe are minutely specified in the ancient deed of Mabel de Grenville.

On the ioth of January, 1698, EUingham was sold by Robert Armorer for the sum of \u00a33,7 96 f1 to Edward Haggerston a younger son of Sir Thomas Haggerston, bart., of Haggerston, who had for many years filled the office of governor of Berwick. Edward Haggerston and his first wife Mary, daughter of Gerard Salvin of Croxdaie in the county of Durham, appear to have resided on their newly purchased estate. They to some extent rebuilt the house in which the Armorers had lived, and the letters 'E. H. M.,' being the initials of Edward and Mary Haggerston, with the date 1703, are at present visible over the door of EUingham hall. It might have been expected that the old dispute about the moor would terminate with the death of Dobson and the sale of the estate. This was, however, not the case, and the suit still dragged on, causing much ill feeling between the new squire and Dobson's successor, Robert Pattison. The transfer of the property had been scarcely completed when Edward Haggerston wrote from Haggerston on the 14th of February, 1698/9, to the clerk ofthe bishop of Durham's court as follows : I was att EUingham some time since I saw you, where I would have been glad to have seen the parson, which he was told of, tho' had not y\" civility as to come near me of late, or to send any mesage, so y' I could not bring myself to wait on him, nor indeed never shall till he seekes it of me, wcl1 if youle please to let him know you may, for I am resolved never to truckle to any such as he, especially as he has given me just occasion. In spite of this ill feeling a meeting between the squire and Pattison, the new vicar, was still contemplated, and is referred to by Pattison in a letter to a correspondent written on the ist of March, 1698/9. Some passages in the letter throw a side light upon the occupations and mode of life of a country clergyman at that time. He says : I have spoken with Mr Haggerston about our meeting at Durham, and was desirous that it might be upon the io,h of April, or soon after, but he would give me no positive answer as to that time, but would have it sooner, which I cannot assent to without great inconvenience, by reason we are now beginning to be very busy in plowing and sowing, and shall be till after Easter, so that I cannot spare horses till that time. Besides I would not willingly be out of the parish till after Easter. I perceive he will be at Croxdaie2 about that time. I desire therefore you would be pleased to write to him to meet me then, for he will be willing to comply with your motion more than mine. My house being so very ruinous I am forced to provide for building this spring, and accordmgly employed three masons in winning stones about a month or more, having already wun (as they compute) 1 Sir John Haggerston' s MSS. 2 The residence of Edward Haggerston's wife's family, see p. 263."], [308, "262 ELLINGHAM PARISH. about 200 futhers, and ordered my servant to begin to lead them [on] February 28\"1. But Mr Hagger- ston's steward by his master's orders stopt them, and would not suffer them to lead any away. Now this quarry, being in the common, my predecessors used always to win stones there .... so that I am very' much disappointed of my intention, for I intended by the Divine permission to have begun to build my house in April next, and in my journey to Durham to have bought firdales and other wood for that purpose at Newcastle. As the vicar became more impoverished his complaints became more urgent. He wrote on the 13th of December, 1699 : Haggerston is just now enclosing or letting to farme the best part of the moor or common, and endeavours to drive the poor vicar quite off it. I may very well be poor considering the hard circum stances I have had ever since I entered upon this living, the wood all cut down, the glebe very much impoverished, the vicarage house repairing every year, and now after all falling down, so that I am providing for building of it, God willing, the beginning of next summer; taxes and assessments very high every year since I came, for I pay part of all taxes of the townshipp of EUingham, and therefore ought to have a reasonable share of the common. I wish to God I were in a condition to maintain the rights of poor St. Maurice' without troubling my reverend patrons. [In a postscript the vicar adds]: We both give our most humble services to the Rev\" D' Morton2 and his lady, and also to the Rev'1 Dr Graham and his ladies, begging their furtherance and assistance in this affair. 3 Eventually Dr. Morton and the chapter of Durham began to render the vicar more active help, and Pattison was eager to show signs of proper grati tude.4 Various legal processes having been set in motion upon both sides with little result, Haggerston determined to appeal to the law as adminis tered bv the manorial court, a tribunal which had not been applied to for more than a quarter of a century. Pattison, writing on the 17th of October, 1 700, says : Yesterday Mr Haggerston held a Court Leet at Preston tower, and summoned my tenants to appear, he sent his bayliffe into the church to summon my dark to appear when he was ringing to prayers, but I would not suffer any of them to appear, whereupon they were all fined by the jury, one whereof is a papist. This court has not been holden this 35 years untill now, as I am credibly informed by ancient inhabitants, and none can remember that ever the vicar or his tenants did ever answer at that court. Neither the vicar of Embleton, nor the vicar of Eglingham, or any of their tenants answer to the earle of Tankerville's courts, which are holden every year in their parishes . . . . Mr Haggerston still delays to let us have our division ofthe common, and I am afraid our old witnesses many of them will drop off this winter, for Mr Hume5 is lying adying at my house. 1 Patron saint of EUingham church. 2 See p. 259. * MSS in the possession ofthe vicar of EUingham. 4 He adds in a postscript to one letter : ' My wife having this opportunity has sent Madam Morton a small present of Beudle cockles per bearer, my servant, who is going to Norton to fetch my son home this Easter.

MAURICE. 267 records the grant from Nicholas de Grenville of the church of EUingham to St. Cuthbert and his monks. The deed, which has been already printed,1 may be assigned to the first half of the twelfth century. The date of the death of Nicholas de Grenville cannot be ascertained, but the property which he possessed eventually descended to his nephew, William de Grenville, who died about the year 1 161, when the barony of EUingham was divided between William's two sisters, of whom the eldest, Mabel de Grenville, married Ralph de Gaugy.2 By this marriage EUingham passed into the possession of a new proprietor, who confirmed the gift of his predecessor Nicholas de Grenville. The charter of Ralph de Gaugy is similar in purport to that of Nicholas, and in it he states that he has granted the church to the convent, on behalf of himself, his wife, and other relations, with the assent and by the wish of Ralph his heir, and he expresses his desire that the monks shall hold the church of EUingham as freely as they held any other churches in the fee of other barons.3 It is possible that some dispute had arisen about the terms of the original grant, and it is noticeable that no reference is made in the deed of Ralph de Gaugy to the original grant of Nicholas de Grenville.4 The gift of Ralph de Gaugy was subsequently confirmed by Bishop Hugh de Puiset, by a deed executed before the year n 58. In the deed of confirmation Bishop Hugh mentions the fact that Ralph had ratified his gift in the bishop's presence by placing a curved knife on the altar of St. Cuth bert.5 It was at the same time stipulated that Geoffrey, then parson of EUingham, should retain possession of the church during his life, and that, after Geoffrey's death, the son of Ralph de Gaugy, who was best qualified, should be presented to the parsonage. It was agreed also that Ralph de Gaugy's son should pay five shillings a year to the convent of Durham, and that after his death the church should be the free property ofthe convent, and the prior and convent should keep the 'parsonage' freely in their possession. There is in the same document a subsequent clause which appears to be at variance with the provisions already specified. By this clause it was agreed that Ralph and his heirs should have the advowson ('advocationem') of the church, as other barons were wont to have the advowson of other churches 1 See p. 226. 2 See pp. 229, 230. ' See pp. 227, 228. 4 The deed is addressed to Prior Absolon, who died in 1158. 5 A knife was at that time not uncommonly used as a mark of ratification or attestation.

It is evident therefore that the gift was not entirely free from reservation, and it is possible that Ralph de Gaugy retained the right to confirm the nomination of the prior and convent. Lastly, Ralph and his heirs, by common consent of the chapter, were to be received into the fraternity of St. Cuthbert, and to be made partakers, both in life and death, in the alms and prayers of the church of Durham.1 Another deed of confirmation of somewhat later date is similar in tenor, but is attested by different witnesses.2 In this document some land attached to the church is mentioned, which con stituted the ancient endowment of the rectory. This endowment was further increased by the generosity of Mabel de Grenville, who gave to the church of St. Maurice of EUingham all the land of Elwold the dreng, and Aliz, and Gamel his son, and Michael his brother, and all the wood of St. Mary, extending from the bridge on the south side of the church, by the side of St. 1 'Confirmatio Hugonis, episcopi Dunelmensis, de ecclesia de Ellingeham.

St. Mary's wood, mentioned in this document, has long since disappeared, and the name is no longer remembered by the inhabitants of EUingham. The name was derived from the chapel of St. Mary in the valley, which pro bably stood in the wood or in the immediate neighbourhood of it. This chapel still existed in the year 1333, when a new thatch roof was placed upon it, but it is not mentioned in any document after that date. It too is now forgotten, and no trace of it has yet been discovered. It may be possible, however, to approximately identify the site of this ancient building, and, if excavations were made, traces of it might be found. It appears to have been situated near the burn running through St. Mary's wood, in the immediate neighbourhood ofa mill pond belonging to the monks of Durham.1 It may be supposed that the wood at one time comprised the land now called the glebe, which extends on the south-east of the church to the boundary of the township of Preston, which is divided from the township of EUingham by a deep and picturesque ravine, through which runs the stream formerly called the Meadow burn, and now known as the Long Nanny. This ravine is pro bably the valley in which St. Mary's chapel stood. It will be observed that Mabel de Grenville's deed is endorsed 'the charter of Mabel de Grenville concerning all the land of Elwold, the dryng, and of others, and concerning the wood of St. Mary of Elingham given to the church of EUyngham.'2 The language of this endorsement suggests the supposition that St. Mary's wood had at one time been attached to the chapel as its endowment, and it appears from other records that land had been specially conferred upon it, also by the gift of Mabel de Grenville, who had given to it half a carucate of land, namely, forty-eight acres with tofts and crofts. The land was given on condition that there should be a resident chaplain, finding all the necessaries for the chapel, and performing services regularly in it for the souls of the faithful departed.3 The deed, in 1 Robert de Clifford gave the monks leave to divert the stream, after it left his mills, to the pond belonging to the monks, near the chapel of St. Mary. See p. 237. 2 The endorsement is written by two different hands. The part written in the oldest handwriting is ' Carta Mabille de Greneuill de tota terra data ecclesie de EUyngham.' The words between ' terra ' and ' data ' have been subsequently inserted. 3 ' Carta Mabille de Greneuil de xlviii acris terre, etc., datis ecclesie de EUingham.

The endorsement shows that the land, nominally appropriated to the chapel, was absorbed in the glebe of the parish church to which the chapel was subordinate, and, when the two documents are compared, there can be little doubt that the land of Elwold the dreng and St. Mary's wood, mentioned in the endorsement of the first, is identical with the half carucate given to the chapel of St. Marv, and absorbed in the general endowment of the parish church, as stated in the endorsement of the second. After the chapel had fallen into ruins, the wood appears to have ceased to bear the name of St. Mary, and was called St. Maurice's wood. It continued to be so called until the seventeenth century, when Lancelot Dobson cut down the trees in it, and substituted for it a new plantation upon another site. Neither the wood of St. Mary nor that of St. Maurice is now in existence, but the glebe is still known as St. Maurice's park.1 Ralph de Gaugy, the husband of Mabel de Grenville, died about the year 1 166, leaving a son Ralph, a minor at the time of his father's death.2 Mabel de Grenville survived her husband, and a deed of confirmation is preserved at Durham which may have been executed during the period ofher widowhood.

It will be remembered that Mabel de Grenville had given to the church certain drengs, amongst whom were Aliz and Gamel his son. Gamel appears to have died in his father's lifetime, and Adam de Gaugy then assigned to his father Aliz, now called Aliz de March'a, the house which Gamel had occupied, and his land, with the croft called 'Alden,' and the house made near the 'Alden' land. He also gave to Aliz the croft called 'sunnolt,' with the arable land attached to it, and half the arable land of Etherislei, and half the meadow land in the same place, and the whole of the wood between the limestone quarry and the 'rubra via' or red path, previously called the 'via redarum' or Redepethe. Adam stipulated that Aliz should pay two shillings a year to the church of EUingham on the feast of St. Cuthbert during his lifetime, or as long as he wished to hold it. After the death of Aliz it was provided that the payment should be made to any one of the children of Adam whom Aliz might select.

It is clear, however, that 'ejus ' in ' post decessum ejus ' refers to Aliz, and that Aliz is the subject of the whole sentence ' Reddendo voluerit.' The deed as a whole should be compared with one of somewhat later date, which refers to the same parcels of land. It is as follows : ' Quieta clamacio Ade Walmden de iiij toftis in villa de EUingham.

The Walden burn is also mentioned in 1424 in the marriage settlement of Sir Robert Harbottle.

Ralph de Gaugy is stvled the founder of the church, but there can be no doubt that it was in existence in the lifetime of Nicholas de Grenville, and before the marriage of Mabel de Grenville to Ralph de Gaugy.1 Shortly after the promulgation of the papal bull, Ralph de Gaugy, the grandson of Mabel de Grenville, bv a deed executed between the years 1209 and 121 3, when William de Blunville was discharging the duties of sheriff, granted to the mother-church of EUingham, in exchange for other lands, a toft between the land of Thomas, the parson's man, and that of Agnes the widow, and the croft attached to it, extending as far as the Alden or Walden burn, which has been previously mentioned.

The latter place was the centre ofthe small baronv of Ralph Fitz Roger, a descendant of Ralph Fitz Main, who also held the township of North Charlton from the lords of the barony of AInwick.3 The moorland attached to these places was very extensive, and at a comparatively recent date the inhabitants of many of the townships in Bamburghshire were in the habit of driving their cattle through EUingham to graze upon these pastures.4 The rights enjoyed by the respective townships were, however, from an early time the subject of dispute, owing to the undefined nature of the boundaries. In consequence of a controversy which arose between the prior and convent and Ralph Fitz Roger an attempt was made on the 14th of July, 1266, to fix the limits of the commons and to determine the rights of the respective parties. The common in dispute stretched from a ditch near the gallows of EUingham in a southerly direction to the marshy ground called Bemelismersk letch, thence to Threperstrother and 'le Hengandewelle,' now called the Hangwell Law, a hill at the western extremity of EUingham, where that township joins North Charlton. The prior and convent renounced on their part their rights in the pasture from the stones fixed on the west of Threperstrother as far as Hangwell Law, and Ralph Fitz Roger gave to the prior and convent the residue of Threperstrother, marked off by the stones and a ditch or furrow extending to 'Suterpethletche,' now called Souterpot, a place between Honeymug bog and Brockdam Moor, where a pile of stones stands to this day, called Souterpot cairn. From Souterpot the dyke passed to Bemelismersk letch, and thence eastward to the north road, described as the 'king's road which leads from Charlton to Berwick.' The right of the prior to pasture cattle, to cut peats on the peat bog of Threperstrother, to dig turves and cut ling there, his ancient privilege, was expressly reserved. 1 'Honorius III. super ecclesia de EUingham, etc. Eapropter, dilecti in Domino filii, vestris justis precibus inclinati, ecclesiam de EUingham cum pertinenciis suis sustentacioni pauperum et hospitum vestri monasterii deputatam, etc., auctoritate apostolica confirmamus, etc. Datum Laterani, vii.

The arms on the seal are vair, on a chief a cross patonce) Not long after the settlement of this dispute a new incumbent, named Alexander, was instituted to EUingham. On the occasion of his induction some new regulations were made with reference to the revenues due to him. Alexander was summoned to appear before the official of bishop Robert de Stichill in the church of St. Mary's hospital in Newcastle, on the 17th of February, 1273, and it was then arranged that he should receive the ordinary altar dues of the church, namely, tithes of wool, lambs, hay, mills, and other petty tithes, and that he should have the use of a piece of land in EUingham suitable for building purposes, to be held with the land in North and South Charlton previously belonging to the church. In case of any extraordinary burden the vicar for the time being was to be answerable for the third part, and to render an account of such expenses to the ordinary.2 By this arrangement the living of EUingham was constituted a vicarage in the usual way, and the great tithes with the other profits of the rectory were reserved to the prior and convent, who maintained a house at EUingham apart from the vicarage,3 in which the monks, who were engaged in the administra tion of the rectorial estates, might live.

In 1472 they were sold to the vicar, Thomas Pulforth and Thomas Dowdell. In 1480 they were sold to Robert Herbotyll, Adam Browell and William Maxon, and they were sold to the same persons for several years following. In 1495 the tithes were sold to the prior of Hulne, the vicar of EUingham, R. Hart botill, Adam Browell (elsewhere called Adam Burrell) and W. Maxwell. In 1520 the tithe of EUingham was sold to the vicar, Thomas Davison and Thomas Franche ; the tithe of Preston was sold to the master of Fameland for xxvj* viij* ; the tithe of Doxford was sold to the prior of Hulne ; the tithes of North Charlton were sold to George Macrel, R. Taylzor, R. Mathoson of Berewyc ; and the tithe of South Charlton was sold to T. Maxson, then vicar of EUingham. In 1539 the tithes were divided between the vicar and Gabriel Forster. The tithes of North Charlton were held by George Mathowson and John Carr of Hulne. It is evident that the value of the benefice varied greatly in the four teenth and fifteenth centuries, in consequence of the disturbed state of the countiy. The great tithes appear to have produced between and \u00a32,0 in a year of fair prosperity, and in addition to them the convent of Durham received the proceeds of the mill and the rents of their estate ; on the other hand large sums were expended on the repairs and renewal of houses and build ings owing to the frequent Scottish depredations. It was therefore difficult to estimate the value of the benefice for purposes of taxation, and it was neces sary to re-adjust the valuation at frequent intervals, in accordance with the rapidly changing circumstances. The valuations afford fairly trustworthy evidence of the general condition of the country, and a comparison between them will demonstrate the rapid fluctuations in the value of property. In 1292, for the purpose of the taxation of Pope Nicholas, the rectory of EUing ham was estimated to be worth \u00a330 a year, and the 'portion of the vicar' was worth \u00a36 13s. 4d.3 Twenty-six years later, after the Scottish wars of the reign of Edward II., -both rectory and vicarage were estimated as worthless, and were stated to be devastated and entirely destroyed/ In 1340, however, 1 'De decimis tocius parochie de EUingham nichil hoc anno, quia occupantur per Dominum Radulfum Percy et per diversos homines ipsius, tamen reddere solebant, xj\" xvj* viij'1.'

Only two fragments of an ancient building are incorporated in the modern masonry. One of these is the head of a lancet window in the east wall of the south transept ; the other is a piscina in the south wall adjoining the altar at the east end. It is pro bable that large portions of the Norman building were in existence in 1567 when the church is stated to have been in everv respect in good repair and covered with lead.1 Between that date and 1604 the lead roof appears to have been removed, with the result that the whole structure became decaved and ruinous. In this condition the church seems to have remained throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, until in the year 1805 it was decided to build a new one.2 For this purpose money was obtained, and a new building was erected, but the work was so badly done that in 1859 it was necessarv to call the attention ofthe patrons ofthe living to its dilapidated state. On the recommendation of Mr. Salvin it was decided to entirely rebuild the church, as any attempt at repair would be costlv and unsatisfactory. The Rev. Charles Thorp, at that time vicar ofthe parish, accordingly procured designs for a new building from the Rev. J. F. Turner, afterwards bishop of Grafton and Armidale, which were adopted. The present church, built in 1862, is in the Early English style, and consists of a nave and chancel, with transepts and a central tower. The architectural features of the building do not require any detailed description. Inscriptions.

To the south of EUingham is the township of North Charlton, which has an area of 2,807 acres, and a population of 153 persons.1 The western portion of the township consists of high boggy moorland, upon which numerous prehistoric interments have been found at various times. The moor is divided into three parts, known as the Middle Moor, North Charlton Moor, and Linkhall Moor. About the year 1834, when search was being made on North Charlton Moor for building stones, four cists were found under a cairn, a little to the north of the spot called Heathery Tops. The cairn was said to be 10 feet in height and 60 feet in circumference. The cists, which were found after the cairn had been removed, were each 3 feet 6 inches in length, and were placed near the circumference, and almost in a line corresponding to it. In each cist an urn was found, three being upright and one inverted. Three of them were about 7 inches high, described as being of the 'usual or common shape like a flower pot ; ' they were ornamented with markings crossing each other, such as might be made by a twisted cord, and contained charred earthy matter. The fourth urn was larger, being 18 inches in height, tulip-shaped, and elegantly ornamented. It also contained charred remains. Six other cists were opened in other parts of Charlton Moor, but nothing was found in them.2 Similar remains have also been found in other parts of the township. On the 8th of January, 1824, during the removal of a cairn on the farm of Mr. Black at North Charlton, two cists were found on the east side of the high road. One of these was 6 feet long, 2 feet wide, and 2\\ feet deep. At the west end a stone was found placed as a pillow, with a skull resting upon it. Lying across the breast of the skeleton was a bronze knife-dagger, with a blade 6 inches in length, thin and tapering to the point. A haft, apparently of bone, was riveted on to it, but soon crumbled away. The stones of which the cist was composed were removed, but are still to be seen at the side of the drive which leads from the high road to Charlton hall. The spear was sent to Mr. John Cay of Edinburgh, at that time proprietor of the estate.3 1 Census Returns : 1801, 217; 1811, 179; 1821, 230; 1831, 244 ; 1841, 238; 1851, 239; 1861, 184; 1871, 168; 1881, 159; 1891, 153. 2 See the notes of the late Mr. George Tate.

The graveyard attached to the chapel appears to have occupied the ground to the south, between the hillock and the cross, the remains of which stand in the middle of the village near the high road. The ground is now laid down in grass, but numerous graves were formerly disturbed when the land was in cultivation. To the north west of the Castle Close plantation there is a similar clump of trees known as Camp plantation, in which the remains of a triangular entrenchment may 1 The origin of these ridges has been discussed.

On the south-west side is the Charlton burn, which, with the Sheperton burn, supplies the neighbourhood with water. The last mentioned stream rises in the western moorland, and, running through Edington dene,1 flows into the grounds of Charlton hall, which was formerly known as Sheperton. To the south of Charlton hall are two large farms, called East and West Linkhall. The township of North Charlton, forming part of the barony of AInwick, was held by the lords of the barony of Ditchburn near Eglingham, along with Adderstone, for a knight's fee of ancient feoffment.2 One of the founders of the family, which possessed the small Ditchburn barony, was Ralph son of Main, the progenitor of the numerous Fitz Ralphs, who afterwards succeeded to his inheritance. Ralph, son of Main, lived in the middle of the twelfth century, to which early period may be assigned a deed, preserved in the Treasury at Durham, by which he gave fifty acres of land to the chapel of St. Giles in North Charlton. In addition to this he gave to the chapel two 'mansions' and two acres of land, to defray synodal expenses, an ancient customary charge levied upon ecclesiastical benefices. He also granted to the chapel the land on which a hospital had been founded, as far as the Charlton burn, with a small addition to its previous endowment. The gift was made on behalf of the souls of Ralph son of Main, Agnes his wife, and Ralph his heir, and was attested by Richard abbot of AInwick, Geoffrey, probably the first recorded rector of EUingham, Simon de Lucker, Ralph de Gaugy, and other men of the locality. Attached to the deed is the seal of Ralph son of Main, bearing a wild boar as a device.3 1 The Edingtons were a well known family in the neighbourhood in the seventeenth century.

North Charlton passed with the rest of the barony of Ditchburn to the Beaumonts about 1320,1 and remained in their hands throughout the fourteenth and the greater part of the fifteenth century,2 until John de Beaumont, being taken prisoner at the battle of Towton, was attainted in 1464 for his adherence to the Lancastrian party.3 North Charlton was thereupon granted to Edmund and Richard Craster/ but, when Henrv VIL came to the throne in 1485, the Beaumonts were restored to their honours and estates. The connection of the Beaumonts with North Charlton was maintained until about 1532, when John Beaumont and his wife Alice conveyed North Charlton in trust to Sir Reginald Carnaby. In that year John Beaumont having the misfortune to be detained as a prisoner by the Scots, the earl of Northumberland wrote on the 22nd October, 1532, to make complaint to Henry VIII. on the subject. He informed the king that 'the comptroller of Scotland and Thomas Scott hath nowe delyvered Beamond, owner of Charl ton, which was taken prisoner, and gyven him a coote of velvet in recompence of hys hard interteignement in Scotland, yet nevertheles they do deteigne and hold hys broder with all other men goodes and insight, beyng taken at the same time, nor yet redressyng the slaughter of your subgiettes than slayn.'6 Four years later, in 1536, when Sir Ingrain Percy was on his way from New stead to AInwick, he 'took possession of North Charlton, a town which Carnaby had lately purchased, and of his lands there, proclaiming that he took them for his brother Sir Thomas.\"3 Upon the death of Sir Reginald Carnaby his property was divided among his three daughters, of whom the second, Ursula, became the wife of Edward Widdrington. Upon a partition of the estates North Charlton was allotted to her, and she shortly afterwards directed that the township should be care fully surveyed.

Ursula Carnaby by her marriage with Edward Widdrington had a son, Sir Henry Widdrington, knight, through whom the estate of North Charlton passed to Sir William Widdrington.5 The latter sold the place for to his sister Dorothv, wife of Sir Charles Howard of Naworth. In 1644, shortly after the outbreak of the Civil War, Sir Charles Howard's lands in North Charlton were 'sequestered for his recusancy,' but on his death, which occurred in 1652 'at Sir William Riddell's house in Gateshead,' his widow petitioned for the discharge of the sequestration, which appears to have been granted. ,; In 1663 Dame Dorothy Howard conveyed North Charlton to trustees, from whom it passed in 1669 to William Charlton, and eventually in 1695 to Jabez Cay and Jonathan Hutchinson.7 Jonathan Hutchinson, who purchased a moiety of North Charlton on the 28th August, 1695, was the son of William Hutchinson a prominent merchant of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, who had filled the office of mayor of that town. His son Jonathan afterwards became an alderman, and married Mary the eldest daughter of Ambrose Barnes. In the life of Ambrose Barnes8 it is stated that Jonathan Hutchinson, after his father's death, 'was chosen burgess for the town of Barwick-upon-Twede, and for the 12 years he sat in the House of Commons he made not a penny profit to himself, but spent his 1 Hangwell Law is at the north-west corner of North Charlton. 2 Now known as Souterpot. 3 i.e., the ' king's gate in y* king's heighe streate.'

The latter held a manor court at North Charl- ton on 29th Oct., 1685, when the following were summoned to appear : Sir Francis Radcliffe for lands in right of his wife ; John Patterson ; William Smith ; Matthew Quarrier for land in Togsden ; Richard Forster ; Edward Collingwood for land in East Ditchburn ; John Carr ; and various copyholders in North Charlton. s See p. 73."], [345, "NORTH CHARLTON TOWNSHIP. 297 own estate whilst he served the public' This excellent man was mem ber of Parliament for Berwick at the time of his death, which occurred on the 11th of June, 171 1. A few months later his widow sold North Charlton to John Cay of Laygate, South Shields, younger brother of Jabez Cay who had purchased the other moiety of the township. Jabez Cay, who purchased the other moiety of North Charlton, was descended from a family of Newcastle freemen.1 One of his descendants, John Cay, sheriff of Linlithgowshire, writing to the Rev. John Hodgson, the historian of Northumberland, on the ioth of April, 1832, says : 'as to my own pedigree it will require some time and research, and I must beg your indul gence for a while. The nut is not worth the cracking. It is but the history of some old freemen of Newcastle, who by industry and some good sense con trived to make enough of money to buy the land I now possess, and which it has been a struggle for my grandfather and father to retain, chiefly in con sequence of a grievous law plea with the earl of Northumberland,2 and which I fear will one day quit the family, for it is now heavily burdened, and its owner has too numerous a progeny to admit of his making a wealthy squire of the eldest.' Again on the ist of August, 1832, the same writer adds, 'our name was formerly spelt Kay, and it is a tradition in the family that Caius the founder of the college at Cambridge belonged to us, and that his fancy was a cause of the change of spelling. This I doubt.' From the following pedigree it will be seen that members of the Cay family have been distinguished in various ways.3 1 Among the Cay papers are some notes of the steward of North Charlton relating to a manor court held there in 1685. 'Whereas we find that the common pound fold belonging to this manner is out of repair, and in decay, and that it ought to be repaired by ye several farmers and cottagers within the said manner, we therefore order that the several farmers and cottagers shall, at or before St. Andrew's day next, repair the same, and from time to time so keep the same in good repair, upon pain of every farmer's and cottager's fault, iij8 iiijd. We find that there wants a paire of stocks within this manner. We therefore desire that the lords of this manner will be pleased to give wood and iron towards the making of the same, which the lords grant to doe. We thereupon order that the several farmers and cottagers shall severally contribute to the making up of the same and place them at the cross in North Charlton, and that they shall be set up, at or before St. Andrew's day next, upon pain of vis viijd.' The following is the will of a farmer ofthe township : '5 Oct., 1631. I, Humphray Forster of North Charletonn doe make my last will, etc. ...

SOUTH CHARLTON. In an old survey it is stated that ' the towne of South Charleton, being parcell of the barony of Alnewick, is situated in Bambrough ward, fyve miles distant from Alnewyck, which is the next market towne adjoyning to the same.\" In 1620, when this survey was made, the village consisted, as at present, of a small number of houses, running nearly east and west in the centre of the township. Towards the west the 'town gate,' or village street, led directly to open moorland stretching north to the land of North Charlton, then belonging to Sir Henry Widdrington, and west towards Bewick and Ditchburn. On the remaining sides the village was surrounded by the unenclosed arable fields, which were four in number, namely, the North field (153 acres), the East field (122 acres), the Middle field (96 acres) to the south-east, and the West field (153 acres) to the south-west of the village. At the north-east corner of the township was the ox pasture, 'called East Broom,' containing 69 acres, and at the south-eastern extremity were two parcels of land called Chirnsyde (125 acres) and Grauell Croft (55 acres), remnants of the ancient demesne land of the manor.

In February, 1824, a barrow was opened on the hill called Longlee, formerly known as Langley Hill, which is about three-quarters of a mile to the south-west of South Charlton, and forms the highest elevation in the neighbourhood. In the centre of the barrow a cist was found, made of four large stones placed upright and rudely jointed together. The cist was 3^ feet in length from east to west, 1^ feet in breadth, and 2 feet in depth. In the centre a fine urn or 'food vessel' was found, lying upon its side and filled with ashes. It is 5 inches in height, 5^ inches in diameter at the top, and 2^ inches at the bottom. It is dark in colour, and is ornamented round the shoulder by a grooved line, on which there are unpierced ears at regular intervals. The urn is now preserved in the museum at AInwick castle.1 Traces of similar prehistoric interments may be seen in many other places on the moors which surround South Charlton. There are also some remains of camps at Buck Law to the south, and at Chester Hill to the north-east of the village.2 The manor of South Charlton, formerly a part of the barony of AInwick, was in early times the property of the knightly family settled at Lucker, by whom it was held along with Hoppen and Fallodon for one knight's fee.3 The earliest record relating to the township is a deed preserved in the Treasury at Durham by which Simon de Lucker, the third of that name, who lived in the thirteenth century, gave five roods of land in South Charlton to the monks of Fame for the erection of a building upon it. The land was that which Thomas de Folebyri had formerly held at the west end of the vill called Upton.4 The monks also received pasturage for six cows and their 'following' up to the age of three years, and grazing for two oxen, a horse, and forty sheep with their 'following,' from the lambing season until Michael mas every year, the whole being given in exchange for half a quarter of wheat which Simon de Lucker had promised to give yearly by a former deed. Juliana, daughter of Thomas de Warenton and wife of Simon de Lucker, is mentioned in the grant, which was attested by Ralph Fitz Roger, lord of the 1 For an engraving of the vessel see plate viii. of the Catalogue of the A ntiquities at AInwick Castle.

A survey of South Charlton was then made, and it was found that David held two-thirds of the manor, the remaining one- third being in the hands of his aunt Christina. The two-thirds constituting David's portion contained one hundred acres of demesne land, twenty acres of meadow, twelve husbandlands, each containing twenty acres, and six cottar holdings,2 all of which escheated to the lords of the barony of AInwick in consequence of the treason of David de Lucker's uncle Henry, who would have been his heir.3 Since the death of David de Lucker, in 1379, the township has belonged to the Percy family, and the rolls ofthe bailiffs of South Charlton are preserved amongst the early accounts of the Percy estate. Unfortunately they are for the most part merely formal documents, and rarely throw light on social life or illustrate the condition of the property. The bailiff paid a small sum every year into the hands of the earl's receiver, until the year 1442, when there were no profits from South Charlton and Langeley (Longlee Moor), because they had been granted with EUingham, Newstead, and Lucker to Sir Henry Percy, who afterwards became the third earl of Northumberland.4 The tenants of South Charlton, in common with the inhabitants of the neighbouring villages, took an active part in the work of commissariat and transport connected with the various expeditions directed against James III. of Scotland between the years 1480 and 1482. In the middle ofthe summer of 1480 a commission was given to the duke of Gloucester, in conjunction with the chief men of the northern counties, to array and arm the men of these counties, in order to oppose an incursion which the Scots were then preparing to make.5 The summer was spent in actions of little consequence, but in the autumn greater activity was displayed by the English. A large army was raised, of which one detachment laid siege to Berwick, whilst another proceeded to Jedburgh under the command of Henry Percy, the fourth earl. The earl appears to have left AInwick in September, 1480, and 1 Inq. p.m. 26 Ed. III. 42. 2 Inq. p.m. 3 Ric.

Subsequently, on his return north, the tenants of Shilbottle, Lesbury, Bilton, Houghton, and Denwick combined to assist in carrying some of the materials and provisions of war on fifteen waggons from AInwick to Jedburgh. A wheel came off one of the waggons belonging to a tenant of Lesbury, and another wheel was bought from William Maxwell, a tenant of South Charlton, in order to replace it.1 Amongst other men from the district, who rendered similar help, are mentioned Allan Reed, who received two shillings for conveying the earl's stores to Jedburgh, and Richard Dycson who received sixteen pence for the same service.

In a survey of the barony of AInwick, made in the year 1727, it is stated that South Charlton consisted of 'xvi tenements besides cottages, each tenement does one plow darg to Alnwicke north demesne. The whole towne payes xviij rent hens and other bondage services for repaires ofthe castle of AInwick.' The tenement lands in the township seem to have been divided about the year 1685 into two portions for greater convenience of cultivation.1 The land belonging to four of the tenements was thrown together on the eastern boundary of South Charlton where it adjoins Rock, and the residue was allotted to the other twelve customary holdings. Afterwards it was found that the two parts had been very roughly and unequally estimated, owing to the varying quality of the soil, and the fact that no survey had been made.2 A similar partition had previously taken place at the neighbouring township of Rock, and at Long Houghton, where the partition also gave rise to similar complaint. It is stated that in the year 1829 each ofthe inhabitants of South Charl ton, serving in the yeomanry cavalry, possessed an allotment of 4^ acres of land, with an additional half acre in the 'coal ground,' which lay between the village and the main road. Similar parcels of land were held by all the local tenantry of the duke of Somerset, who performed military service before the Militia Acts were passed. The land held in this manner was locally known as 'bod-land.'3 The township is now the property of the duke of Northum berland.4 1 On a rental of South Charlton made in 1685 there are notes opposite the names of two tenants, 'not to grant this lease for refusing to come about the division,' ' not to grant this lease, his son refuseing to divide.' 2 Survey of South Charlton in 1727.

The land attached to the chapel is mentioned in the year 1273,1 anc- the name of Hugh, the 'kirkeman,' occurs on the list ofthe people living in the village in 1296.2 In early times the inhabitants of both North and South Charlton appear to have claimed to be independent of the vicar of EUingham in ecclesiastical matters, perhaps upon the same grounds as those on which Wil liam de Hilton based a similar claim at the neighbouring village of Renning ton.3 The quarrel terminated in a formal trial, which was heard before Ralph de Blaykeston, the official of the bishop of Durham, on the 1 8th October, 1343. The vicar of EUingham was represented by William Rok, and the parishioners were represented by John de Tughall, Thomas de Bednell, and Robert de Emylden. It was decided that the celebration of all the sacraments, with the fees for purifications and similar offerings, should be reserved as the exclusive right of the parish church. It was also ordered that the parishioners of North and South Charlton should attend the mother church four times a year, namely, on the three principal festivals, and on the day of the Purification of the Blessed Virgin. In addition to this they were bound to attend confession in Lent, and to pay tithes at the proper season. It was also ordered that two inhabitants of the townships should attend the mother church every Sunday in order to hear the vicar's injunctions, and to make arrangements with the rest of the parishioners with regard to the church and cemeterv. Lastlv, the inhabitants of North and South Charlton were ordered to provide fully for the celebration of Mass in their own chapels.4 Not long afterwards the divine services held in the chapels were entirely suspended, from the effects of war or some other cause. During the time of suspension the inhabitants of North and South Charlton were directed to contribute to the maintenance of the parish church by a decree dated the 8th of May, 1363.6 It is very probable that the chapels were allowed to fall into 1 See p. 277. 2 See p. 302. 3 See p. 161. \" Cessatio dissentionis inter vicarium de EUingham et parochianos de North et South Charleton.'

In 1450 these depredations had become so fre quent and serious that the earl of Northumberland built a tower at the end of South Charlton chapel, especially designed for the protection of the villagers in time of war.1 In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the chapel again lapsed into a semi-ruinous condition, being destitute of any regular incumbent.2 The building was, however, occasionally used until a comparatively recent date, and an old woman named Mary Weatherhead, who died in 18 14, aged 70, remembered a marriage and a funeral which took place in it when she was very young. The chapel stood at the east end of the village, where a parcel of land is still called Kirk Croft. In 1823 the steps leading up to the chapel yard gate still remained, but in 1829 the wall round the chapel yard was taken down, and the yard itself was included in the 'Half acres.' South Charlton was constituted a separate ecclesiastical district in October, 1860, and the present church, dedicated to St. James, was con secrated on the 1 2th of September, 1862. The church, which was built by Algernon, duke of Northumberland, at a cost of \u00a32,720, consists of a nave, with a porch on the south side, and a chancel with a vestry on the north side. Duke Algernon also built the vicarage house at a cost of and endowed the benefice with the sum of \u00a34, 108. The benefice was further endowed by the dean and chapter of Durham with the annual sum of \u00a376 14s., being the tithe rent charges arising from North and South Charlton.

The small township of Doxford is situated on the east of the parish of EUingham, between Preston on the north and North Charlton on the south.1 Doxford hall, a substantial house built in the Grecian stvle, stands on rising: ground where the township adjoins Preston. The country in the neighbour hood is well wooded, and less flat than the land nearer to the sea. To the south-west of the house is a steep mound of about 200 feet in height, known as Dunstan Hill, which is cut, especially upon its eastern side, into several well-defined ridges or terraces. The terraces are similar to those which exist at Charlton hall and other places in the neighbourhood, and mav be attributed to the opera- tions of agriculture. The mound is, however, well adapted to the purposes of fortification, and it is possible that traces of a camp existed formerlv upon the summit. Mr. MacLauchlan, who visited the A spot in 1864, traced the remains of what \u00c6(% he considered to be an oval entrench ment, with an entrance on the north-east, at the southern extremity of the hill, as shown in the plan made by him. Scale, 8 chains to an inch. The early history of Doxford is identical with that of EUingham. The township, the name of which was originally spelled 'Docheseffordam,'2 con stituted a hamlet of EUingham, and was held in the reign of Henry III. as a part of the barony of Gaugy by Roger de Mering for a quarter of a knight's fee.3 Roger de Mering's descendant, Robert de Mering, subsequently, in the year 1304, claimed a moiety ofthe whole barony of Gaugy, as his inheritance through his great-grandmother, Alice de Gaugy. Robert de Clifford, who was at that time in possession of the entire barony, appears to have succeeded in resisting the claim, and the name of Mering, after the year 1304, is not again mentioned in connection with either EUingham or Doxford.4 After Mering had ceased to possess Doxford the township became the property of a family deriving its name from the place. Thomas de Doxford, who appears on the Subsidy Roll for 1296, may be regarded as the founder of this family. 1 The township has an area of 608 acres.

The Doxfords did not attain to the degree of gentry, but belonged to the yeoman class of small freeholders, who frequently adhered to their patrimonial estate more tenaciously than the larger landed proprietors. Like the Hoppens, the Bustons, and similar families in the neighbourhood, the Doxfords remained in possession of their land for many centuries, but, as there are no inquisitions relating to them, there is not sufficient material for the construction of a pedigree. The names of the successive proprietors can only be ascertained from a few scattered and incidental references. In 1336 the head ofthe family appears to have been Adam de Doxford,1 who was succeeded by Richard de Doxford, his son, ten years later.2 Richard de Doxford, with other tenants, held the township as a quarter of a knight's fee, and contributed ten shillings in 1346 towards the expenses ofthe knight- hood of the Black Prince.3 After the confiscation of the estate of John de Clifford, at the close of the fourteenth century, the Doxfords became the free tenants of the earls of Northumberland, as lords of the barony of EUingham, and the names of some members of the family appear on the early lists of freeholders on the Percy estate. The name of Henry Doxford appears on a rental dated 1488, in which it is stated that he held one hundred and five acres in Doxford, a 'hamelette' of EUingham.4 Again, on a rental dated 1508, there is a memor andum that Henrv Doxford showed his charter before the earl's commissioner at AInwick on the 8th of February. According to the terms of the charter Henry Doxford held his land by the annual payment to the earl of a pair of white gloves or one penny, and was bound to pay a small fine in case of forfeiture in the earl's court at EUingham.5 In 1567 Doxford was in the 1 In 1336 the following paid subsidy at Doxford : 'Adam de Doxford, v5 iiij'1; Johannes Taillor, iiij' ; Thomas de Doxford, xij'1.

William Hadston was sub sequently convicted of felony, and executed at Newcastle-upon-Tyne in 1602. His estate would thereupon have escheated to the earl of Northumberland, but Edmund Roddam of Little Houghton, on behalf of his elder brother, John Roddam, then living in Scotland, claimed a part of the land on the ground that it had been conveyed to him by Hadston before his conviction.3 Robert Doxford, the last of an ancient family, died in 1635 without issue. By his will dated 7th November, 1631, he devised the portion of Doxford, which he had retained in his own possession, to his cousin, Gilbert Swinhoe of Berrington.

Under the terms of her will, dated the 3rd December, 1807, her relative, Henry Aynsley, inherited Doxford, and took the name of Taylor. After his death, which occurred on the ioth of August, 1839, his estates were directed to be sold by order of the Court of Chancery. Accordingly on the 1 8th of December, 1846, the township of Doxford was sold for to Thomas Thorp of AInwick, who died in 1854. On the 12th of May, 1859, Thorp's trustees sold Doxford to Sir George Grey, bart., of Fallodon, who, in 1873, s\u00b0ld the township for to Major Alexander Browne, some time chief constable of Northumberland, and a descendant of the Browns who had previously possessed the property. Major Browne died on 14th Jan., 1894, and Doxford is now the property of his son, Mr. A. H. Browne of Callaly castle. PRESTON. The township of Preston lies to the north of Doxford, where the land is broken into hill and dale, clothed with luxuriant plantations. Preston tower stands on high ground to the left of the road leading from Chathill to EUing ham, and is surrounded by trees.1 The tower itself is to the north-west of the modern house, and is detached from it. The house was built by Edmund Craster on the site of the older Preston hall, destroyed by fire in 1782.2 It is probable that the tower, when it was complete, closely resembled Haughton castle, though on a smaller scale.3 It was perhaps built by Robert Harbottle about the year 1415, and was originally a long building with turrets at the four angles. All that now remains of it is the south front, with the south east and south-west corner turrets, and portions of the side walls, running north from them.4 The interior ofthe main building was 16 feet 7 inches wide, 1 Amongst the trees are several fine specimens of ash, sycamore, and Spanish chestnut. In front of the tower there are some flourishing specimens of Cupressus Lawsoniana and Thujopsis borealis. See Proc. Berw. Nat. Club, part i. 1890, p. 266. 2 ' Friday se'nnight, Preston hall near AInwick, by some unknown accident, took fire and was burnt to the ground.' Newcastle paper, 12 Jan., 1782.

The south-west turret is about 13 feet 6 inches square externally, and is slightly larger than the south-east one. The height of the tower is 49 feet 9 inches to the top ofthe battlements. An entrance to the tower is at present afforded by a plain doorway, cut through the base of the south front, probably at the end of the seventeenth century. The basement of the south-east turret is entered through a pointed door, only 4 feet 9 inches high, set back like most of those in the building, in a recess under a half-arch. The rough pointed vaulting of the basement rises to a height of 7 feet, and the dimensions of the vault are 8 feet 9 inches from east to west, by 4 feet 7 inches from north to south. There is a slit, opening through the wall, at the east end. A similar vault in the south-west turret has a contrary direction, being about 8 feet 6 inches long from north to south, and 5 feet 6 inches wide from east to west. In this turret a slit, now blocked up, pierces the wall at the south end ; and in the west wall an opening has been made, which was doubtless in connection with the cottages that are shown built up against the tower in Mr. Archer's sketch of it, made in 1862.1 The vaulted rooms on the first floor of the turrets are provided with fire places. A water-tank now nearly fills the vault in the south-west turret, but there is a good plain fire-place still intact in the east wall. The fire-places on the second floor have both fallen away. A moulding has been worked on the east jamb of the fire-place in the south-west turret. At the top of the south-east turret is a room about 8 feet square inside, with rubble walls, pro bably of the sixteenth century. A similar room in the south-west turret contains the bell on which the clock strikes. The roof of this room has been removed for the purpose of obtaining a better view from the battlements. At the south end of the second floor of the main block is a fine window recess, like some in Warkworth donjon, 5 feet 2 inches in width and 7 feet in height to the springers of the the low arch.

At the close of the twelfth century Preston was held along with Brunton, of the barony of AInwick, by Walter Bataill as one knight's fee.2 One of the freeholders in Preston at that period was Robert, son of Brian, who became a monk in the abbey of AInwick.

In addition to the carucate, Robert, son of Brian, gave to the monks the meadow called Ewarde, which probably adjoined Ewart's Hill near the boundary between Preston and Fallodon, and half the small wood called Elwoldesside. He at the same time stipulated that if the villains of Preston brought into cultivation any waste land at some future time, as much as appertained to a carucate should be given to the abbey of AInwick. William, son of Eustace de Vescy, subsequently ratified the gift ofthe carucate which 'Walter Bataill by his charter confirmed, as well as that of twelve acres of land with appurtenances, which Walter Bataill, junior, had given to them in the territory ofthe same vill.'1 Another member of the family, namely, Walter, son of Henry Bataill, gave one hundred acres of land in Preston to AInwick abbey. The deed of gift states that the endowment included five score acres of cultivated land, composed of various scattered portions which are enumerated as follows : In Pelemer, 5^a. lr. ; in Fulway, i|a. ir. ; in Redepethe, ha., ; in Wolflatte, gia. ir. ; in Elle, ia. ip. ; in Titemue, 2a. ijp. ; in Toftes, ija. or. ; in Saltecroke, 2a. ip. ; in Swalemanflate, 6a. i^p. ; in Crukes, 2a. ; in Almundeflatte, 18a. 3r. ; in Chenhill, ia. ; near Newham Mill, 2a. ijr. ; in Morflate, 10a. i^r. ; in Middilflate, 4^a. \\x. ; in Meduesflatte, 7a. 3^r. ; in Fulflote, 7a. ir. ; in Hewicke, I2^a. ir.

The canons' men were permitted to have a 'common tavern' on their land in Preston. By the terms of the same deed it was agreed that if the abbot and canons cultivated these lands at their own cost, they should grind their corn at Walter Bataill's mill at Brunton without payment of multure, but if the canons let the lands to their men at ferm, they should grind their corn at the abbey mill. At the time when the deed was executed the lands enumerated in it were measured by a perch of seventeen and a half feet, instead of the more usual one of sixteen and a half feet. The abbot and convent were to enjoy all liberties pertaining to the land in proportion to its extent, as in the case of other land held in the diocese of Durham.2 Some time after this, Preston passed with Brunton into the possession of William de Middleton, whose heirs were in possession of the township in 1288.3 The name ofthe lord of the manor does not appear on the subsidy roll compiled in 1296, possibly owing to the minority of William de Middle ton's son. This tax is assessed in two equal portions, probably due to the modern township of Chathill having been considered a moiety of the manor of Preston.4 Preston. Subsidy Roll, 24 Ed.

He was declared a rebel, and, after his flight into Scotland, a survey was made of his lands on the 18th of September, 1333. It was found that he had held fifteen acres of arable land in demesne at Preston, with eight acres of meadow. There were six and a half bondage holdings in the manor, which in ordinary years paid eighteen pence in commutation of various customary works ; but in 1333 even this small sum was not forthcoming, owing to the state of war which then prevailed. There were several freeholders upon the estate, amongst whom are mentioned John Bell, holding 30 acres, Alexander de Preston, Adam son of William the smith, and Richard son of Ingelram. There was also an enclosed wood of oak, a species of tree which is now uncommon in the neighbourhood.1 One of these freeholders, Adam the smith, is mentioned on the roll of those who paid subsidy at Preston in 1336. Only two other persons in the township were able to pay this tax, namely, William son of John and Robert son of John. In 1333 Preston was confiscated and was shortly afterwards assigned to two royal officials, John de Crumbewell and Thomas de Bamburgh, for life, with reversion to Sir John de Stryvelyn.2 The connection of Sir John Stryvelyn with Preston was not long maintained, and in 1378 his estate in the township had so far dwindled that it consisted of only one tenement.3 His property appears to have passed gradually to Robert Harbottle, who is mentioned as the owner ofthe tower of Preston in 141 5/ Robert Harbottle's interest in Preston seems to have originated in a lease granted to him on 8th Oct., 1399, by Alice, daughter and heiress of William Clerk of Eglingham, of all her land at Preston in Bamburghshire 1 Inq. p.m. 17 Ed.

He married Isabell Monboucher, widow of Sir Henry Heton, and died in, or about, 1419.3 In 1424 the widow, Dame Isabell Harbottle, arranged a marriage between her son, Robert Harbottle, and Margerie, daughter of Sir Robert Ogle. The marriage settlement which was then drawn up, has been already referred to.4 Sir Robert Harbottle was sheriff of Northumberland in 1439, and onthe 1 8th of October in that year he settled the manor of Preston and 'town' of Walden* on his son Bertram, and Jane his wife, daughter of Sir Thomas Lumley.8 Bertram Harbottle, sheriff of Northumberland in 1447, is said to have died in 1462, and on 15th May, 1477, Thomas, Lord Lumley, solemnly protested in the presence of John, prior of Gisburne, Thomas Stitnam the sub prior, and others, at Kilton, that though lawful livery and seisin of Preston had been given to his daughter and her late husband, yet recently their son 'Raffe Harbotell wrongfully, withouten tytle of ryght, but with mastery, with howldeth it from his mother by uncourteous counsell.' 7 Sir Ralph Harbottle, here mentioned, married Margaret, daughter of Sir Ralph Percy, son of Henry second earl of Northumberland.8 He appears to have afterwards become involved in a dispute with Henry Swinhoe, of Rock and Scremerston, with reference to certain lands in Dunstan and Embleton. In order to effect an amicable settlement of the quarrel, it was arranged that a marriage should take place between Isabell, daughter of Sir Ralph Harbottle, and John, son of Henrv Swinhoe, and that Henry Swinhoe should give his son lands in Swinhoe, Beadnell and Rock as his portion, and that Sir Ralph Harbottle should assign to his daughter the disputed lands in Embleton and Dunstan as her dower. In order to make the agreement more stable, measures were taken to ensure a marriage between the two families in any contingency.

Bates, Border Holds, p. 195. 2 By deed dated at Barmoor, 26th Aug., 141 5, John de Presfen, 'armiger,' appointed Richard de Wet wang of Embleton, and John de Chatton of North Charlton, as his attorneys, to deliver a cottage to Robert Harbottle, 'armiger.'

In the meantime Sir Ralph Harbottle remained in possession of Preston tower, which he granted by lease on the 12th of May, 1499, to John Harbottle of Fallodon, gentleman, for a term of thirteen years, at an annual rent of \u00a38 13s. 4d. John Harbottle bound himself at his own cost, 'to set a roose upon the said tower and thack the same with hather, flaggs or strawe,' and Sir Ralph promised to provide timber for the roof.1 From Sir Ralph Harbottle the township of Preston descended with the EUingham estate to his grand-daughters, Eleanor, wife of Sir Thomas Percy, and Mary, wife of Sir Edward Fitton, knight, as co-heiresses of their brother George Harbottle.2 The sisters by deed, dated 3rd Nov., 1538, made arrange ments ' for partycon to be made bytwene the sayd Elynor [Percye, wedowe] and Edwarde Fiton, knyght, and Marye his wife, sister of the sayd Elynor, of the inheritance wiche was to Guycharde Harebotell, father unto the sayd Elynor and Marye, whos heres they be ; ' the inheritance consisting of lands in 'Preston, Horton, Woodon, Elyngham, Bednell, Chryston, Elforde, Tyndeley, Thrydlington, Doxworthe, Charleton, Chypley, Newcastell-upon-Tyne, and elswher.'3 As a result ofthe partition Preston became the property of Lady Eleanor Percy, and afterwards of her son, Thomas Percy, earl of Northum berland.4 After the execution of Thomas Percy, the seventh earl, on the 22nd Aug., 1572, Preston, with the township of EUingham, escheated to the Crown, and is described in the survey, made in 1580, as lately the property of the earl of Northumberland. The township was at that time ' under the charg of Raphe Harbottil,' gentleman, as Crown tenant, and there were five under-tenants on the manor.5 The tenant, Ralph Harbottle, here mentioned, was a grandson of John Harbottle, an Embleton copyholder, and perhaps a great-grandson of John Harbottle, the lessee of Preston in 1499.* He appears to have died in 1 Dodsworth MS. fol. 126 ; quoted in Bates, Border Holds, p. 196. 2 See p. 245 3 Marquis of Waterford' s MSS.

The direct male line of the main stem had terminated at the death of George, son of Sir Guischard Harbottle, and the bulk of the estates had been divided between his sisters, Lady Eleanor Percy and Lady Mary Fitton, as has been already stated. If George Harbottle had left any legitimate issue, such issue would have been heirs to his property, and the partition between the co-heiresses would not have taken place. These facts should be borne in mind in reading the following petition, which is undated, but was addressed to Algernon, tenth earl of Northumberland, who succeeded in 1623 : The petition of Margery Carnaby of Bilton, widow, to Algernon, earl of Northumberland. The humble peticon of Margery Carnaby, of Bilton, in the county of Northumberland, widdow, humblie shewing that your peticoner was grandchilde to Sir Wodgett Harbottle, knight, who had one sonne and one daughter, which daughter was your honor's grandmother, and sonne your peticoner's father.

The petitioner goes on to state that Arthur Strother, by whom she was maintained, 'att the division of the towne of Bilton had a parcell of ground inclosed allotted to him, called by the name of Wynola (it being about 5 acres),' and in conclusion asks that another close may be granted to him instead of it, in some more convenient situation.1 It will be noticed that Margery Carnaby does not mention her father's name, although she states that she was the daughter of a son of Sir Guischard (or 'Sir Wodgett') Harbottle; but it is probable that the language of the petition would have been more precise if her father had been recognised as a member ofthe family. It is also noticeable that the petitioner did not think it necessary to refer to any cause, in order to explain how a member of so illustrious a house had fallen into so dependent a condition. These circum stances tend to support the view, already suggested, that this branch of the family was of illegitimate origin. Nicholas Harbottle, who was in possession of Preston tower in 1621, died in the year 1629,2 when his estate at Preston appears to have come into the possession of Christopher Harbottle, whose will was proved on ist July, 1653.

In that year James Walker, of Newtown, settled the estate 'lately purchased by him of William Armorer, gent.,' on himself, with remainder to his son and grandson. By his will, however, dated 29th Aug., 17 14, James Walker authorised his trustees to sell Preston for the payment of debts, and accord ingly the estate was sold 2nd Aug., 171 5, to Thomas Wood of Burton. The latter afterwards, on 9th May, 17 19, bought Preston tower from Thomas Haggerston of EUingham, at the same time agreeing never to pull down or deface the tower, but to put a new roof upon it, and to permit the manor court to be held in it. From Thomas Wood Preston passed to his daughter Hannah, wife of Sir Henry Grey of Howick,4 who, by will dated ioth April, 1762, devised the estate to George Selby of Elwick, and Daniel Craster, in trust to raise for her daughter Elizabeth, with remainder to her son Ralph Grey for life. In 1762 Elizabeth Grey married James Pennyman, son of Sir William Penny man, of Ormesby, and Preston, becoming vested in the issue of that marriage, was sold in 1805 to Edmund Craster for Edmund Craster, dying childless and intestate in 1824, was succeeded by his only surviving brother Shafto Craster, who, by will dated ist Nov., 1834, devised Preston with other unentailed estates to his only child, Frances Isabel Craster. Miss Craster resided for some time at Preston, which she devised to her kinsman Charles Atkinson. The latter sold the estate in 1861 to Mr. A. J. Baker-Cresswell, and it is now the property of Mr. A. J. Baker- Cresswell's eldest daughter, Miss Baker-Cresswell. 1 Search has been made in the records of the Court of Chancery for the depositions connected with this suit.

The parish of Howick, which contains no dependent township, is situated on the sea coast, and is bounded on the north by Craster and Stam ford, on the west by Little Houghton, and on the south by Long Houghton.1 The village, with the rectory and school, now stand near the sea, three quarters of a mile to the east of Howick hall. The village was formerly situated to the south ofthe church, and to the south-east ofthe hall. From the geological point of view the district from Howick to the mouth of the Ain deserves special study. For convenience, and in order to avoid a disconnected treatment, it will be best to describe the geological structure of the parishes of Long Houghton and Lesbury together with that of Howick. GEOLOGY OF HOWICK, LONG HOUGHTON, AND LESBURY. Although immediately adjoining the parish of Embleton to the north, the coast section along the parish of Howick is as distinct as are the parishes themselves. Almost at the spot where the parish boundary reaches the cliff, the Six-yard Limestone and its overlying shales rise suddenly to the south, and a few yards further on thev are abruptly truncated and thrown out against a disturbance of considerable magnitude, known as the Howick fault. As a result of this, an entirely different set of beds are brought in on the south side of the fracture, consisting of sandstones and sandy shales. Although the main fault may be considered to be situated at this spot other slips occur in connection with it, so that the wedge-shaped mass of shales in the cliff abutting against the fault on the south really belongs to the strata on the north side,2 and is, in reality, a gigantic fragment of fault-breccia, filling up the chasm. This fault hades to the south, and striking roughly east-north-east and west-south-west at the coast turns round inland, and runs \u25a0The parish contains 1,638 acres.

West of this it bends to the south-west, and has not been traced beyond the Hocket. The amount of its displace ment at the coast was calculated by Tate at 400 feet, and Mr. Topley, who has recently surveyed the district, concurs in this estimate.1 It may therefore be concluded that the downthrow being to the south in the direction of the prevalent dip, a corresponding thickness of strata has been cut out, and does not appear on the coast at all. On the north side of the fault bosses of amygdaloidal Whin are intruded among the bedding planes of the limestone. Strings of calcite penetrate the shales, and Tate mentions a vein of galena, which may be contemporaneous with a similar lode formerly worked inland at Little Houghton. The general character of this intrusion of Whin, and the presence of amethystine quartz, seem to associate it rather with the Whin Sill than with the basaltic dykes ofthe Tertiary age. As previously stated faults occurring on this coast are in most cases hidden beneath sand, but a very fine section is displayed at the fault at Howick. The geologist standing opposite Howick at the south angle of the bay, which he has approached from the south, and looking north towards Cullernose Point, will perceive for the first time the structure of this portion of the district. At his feet stretch the false-bedded and shaly sandstones from the south, with their dip to the east, and their conspicuous north and south strike, forming reef-like islands when the tide is low. To the north they cease suddenly, and immediately beyond the truncated layers of the ter raced limestone rise, striking straight east and west, exactly at right angles to the former lines. The overlying shales, sandstone, and limestone crop out beyond, until the shattered and dislodged fragments of the sedimentary strata merge into the substance of the once molten Whin. A fault so well dissected is seldom seen, and the section of the strata visible in the cliff confirms the opinions derived from an examination of the surface.2 In the cliff, a little south of this disturbance, a good illustration is to be seen of the formation of a trough fault by the combination of normal faults hading in opposite directions. The sandy shales associated with these beds contain ironstone nodules, which give rise to several chalybeate springs on the coast. At Howick bathing-house the sandstones, which have been quarried for building material, are massive but false-bedded, and show beau- 1 Vol. i. app. i. 7. 2 See plates in Appendix. Vol. II. 42"], [380, "330 HOWICK PARISH tiful ripple-marked surfaces in some of their layers, where concretionary lenticular patches of limestone also occur. At the boat-house a thin impure limestone, about a foot thick, occurs among the more shaly beds, and contains Pinna flabelliformis and Echinocrinus Urii, both rare in Northumberland. The shales, penetrated in places by a series of vertical stigmaria rootlets and passing upwards into impure ganister and coal, afford an instructive section in support of the 'growth-in-place' theory of the origin of these coal-seams, notwithstanding their close association here with marine limestones. A small fault striking south-east near the mouth of Howick burn, displaces the beds on the south of it, slightly to the west. Evidence of recent incursions of the sea on this coast was afforded in 1849, when, in consequence of the exceptional tide in that year, a submarine forest was exposed. It contained the remains of a number of oak, fir, alder, and hazel trees, some lying prostrate, others still rooted and having short upright stems ; hazel nuts were also found embedded in peat.1 At Iron Scars a calcareous shale makes its appearance, filled with fossils, chiefly of Productus latissimus. This shell is especially characteristic ofthe succeeding limestone, which is separated from the shale by a small bed of sandstone. What particular limestone this represents is not clear, but there is little doubt that it occupies an horizon above the Great Limestone, which is found higher in Howick burn. The abundance of Productus latissimus, a shell very characteristic of the Felltop and upper part of the Great Lime stones in Weardale and Tynedale, supports this view ; though, whether it may be taken to represent the 'tumbler' beds at the top of the Great Limestone, locally separated from that bed, or whether it is to be considered an additional local limestone introduced below the Felltop, as frequently occurs further to the west, is uncertain. From Iron Scars massive false-bedded sandstones, passing in places into coarse red grits, extend to Seaton Point. These are interrupted, north of Boulmer, by a fault running due east through Long Houghton, which brings in a thin limestone near the cliff, and by a vertical whin dyke, 100 feet wide, running east and west immediately north of the life-boat station at the Torrs. Nothing deserving mention is seen in the sandy bay south of Seaton Point, which is occupied by a fault, but at Foxton hall a calcareous shale, full of fossils, is considered by Professor Lebour to represent the Felltop Limestone,2 1 Vol. i. app. i. 7. 2 Vol. i. app. i. 29."], [381, "GEOLOGY. 331 which makes its appearance again at Buston Granary on the other side of the Ain, at the extreme south-east corner of Lesbury parish. The exact position, where the line of demarcation between the top of the calcareous series and the base of the millstone grit should be drawn, is a matter of dispute. Tate and Lebour place it immediately above the Felltop Limestone, while the officers of the Geological Survey, bringing their boundary lines from the south, include a certain thickness of the overlying beds in the lower division. If we adopt the former classification, the line along the base of the grits may be drawn from Buston Granary to Fluke Hole, and, if the lime stone which occurs on the coast immediately north of Boulmer also repre sents the Foxton hall bed, then the whole of the grits dipping east and north-east, forming Red Ends and Marmouth Scars, will belong to the upper series. Inland these parishes contain sections of the greatest interest. The Whin Sill, which was last seen on the coast at Cullernose, reappears at Hips heugh, where it extends over a large area, and is cut off on the south by the Howick fault. The curious spiral-shaped outcrop of the Six-yard Limestone and associated shale is here contorted and metamorphosed at its centre ; a small outcrop also occurs in the burn immediately west of Howick hall. West of Peep-o'-sea, for a mile along the line of the Howick fault, no out crops are visible, but at the bend of the Howick burn, a little north-east of Pasture house, the basalt again sets in, in this instance on the south side of the fault, and continues southward in picturesque crags and bosses until it approaches the junction of the roads at Frank's plantation. Skirting south round Pasture house it tongues north-east to Little Mill station, where it is closely associated with the Six-yard Limestone on the west, and has been extensively quarried for many years past. Another outcrop winds westward from the Long Houghton Mere to Ratcheugh, where it divides into two attenuated portions ; one portion continues west to Long Lee, with an outlier at Harlaw Hill, while another, the south portion, forms the picturesque and precipitous Ratcheugh Crag, and terminates in an extended spread at Duns heugh and Snableazes. At Little Mill the Whin was formerly seen in contact with the Six-yard Limestone on the west, which Tate describes as 'about 720 feet from the top of the series and highly inclined against the Whin, the dip being to the south west from 45 degs. to 60 degs., while the upper shale beds are bent and"], [382, "HOWICK PARISH 332 thrown over ; blocks of limestone too are seen enveloped in the basalt, and metamorphosed and penetrated with veins of igneous rock, the whole being firmly welded, as it were, into one mass.' 1 Opposite Ratcheugh farm a large quarry has been worked for many years in the Whin, which is more than 50 feet thick, very columnar in places, and markedly vesicular in its surface layers. Large nests of quartz crystals occur, many of them being amethystine. Coarser patches of rock, containing augite crystals over an inch in length, are also found in this exposure, resembling similar coarsely crystalline patches in the Whin Sill at High Force, Teesdale, and Tyne Head. Pink coloured strings of more felspathic material, apparently of segrega tionary origin, rich in iron, occasionally penetrate the rock, often spreading into the substance of the Whin, and giving it the appearance of a fine-grained syenite. The intimate mixture of this material in places with the substance of the Whin shows that it was produced previous to the consolidation of the latter. Portions of the Whin are highly pyritous, this mineral being also developed along joint faces in the form of dendrites. On the summit of Ratcheugh Crag, a little to the north of the observatory, the previously mentioned felspathic material also occurs in the form of pink spots. The section at this crag has long been famous.2 The special interest of the section lies in the fact that whereas the Four-fathom Limestone, covered by its characteristic shales, is found reposing on about 80 feet of the basalt at Ratcheugh observatory, at Snableazes quarry, where the crag terminates to the south, the same limestone and shale appear to underlie the Whin, the shale being, in the latter place, much altered and converted into hornstone by the intrusive rock. Forster attributed this difference in the position of the limestone in the two parts of the section to a 'fault or dyke, cutting across the cliff, with an upcast to the north-east.' 'To this dyke,' he says: ' I should have considered that the whole of the basalt in the vicinity owed its origin (conceiving it to be an overlying mass similar to that at Bolam in the county of Durham), but for the reasons mentioned in favour of its being a continuation of the Dunstanburgh range to Harlaw Hill, thus exhibiting a 1 Vol. i. app. i. 18, 19. 2 As early as 1830 Francis Forster published an illustrated description of it (vol. i. app. i. 6), and in 1852 Tate again called attention to the curious structure of the basaltic sheet at this spot (ibid. 7, 19) ; Mr. T. J. Taylor, also, in notes made in 1846, draws a bed of limestone lying between masses of whin ; again in 1S59 Mr. W. S. Gibson gave a short description ofthe same exposure (vol. ii. app. i. 5)."], [383, "GEOLOGY. 333 much more extensive formation than our present knowledge of them would warrant us in attributing to basaltic dykes.' Unfortunately the space between the two exposures is obscured, and it is here that the key to the section is to be found. Forster apparently considered that the Whin had been extruded through a fault occupying this space, and could not reconcile this with the fact of its continuity with the basalt at Dunstanburgh and Harlaw Hill. Tate explains the difficulty by the supposition of two separate and wedge-shaped intrusions not connected with one another,1 of which he gives the following description : At Ratcheugh Crag, which is 400 feet above the sea level, the basalt rises from a steep talus of fallen rock in grand columns to a height of about 80 feet, with a cliff face to the west, and above it are beds of limestone 16 feet thick, peculiarly metamorphosed, for while the bed immediately above the basalt is in some parts but slightly altered, the next beds are highly crystalline. They dip with the whin, south-east 150 degs., and are, on the slope ofthe hill to the east, covered by a fossiliferous shale. About 500 yards to the south is another basaltic cliff at Snableazes, where the rock, which is 63 feet high, is quarried for a road-stone, the top of the cliff being 100 feet lower in level than the summit of the Ratcheugh Crag. For some distance between these basaltic cliffs the section is obscured ; but, by means of the fossiliferous shale overlying the limestone covering Ratcheugh Crag, we are enabled to connect the whole ; for this shale is traceable through the wood to Snableazes quarry. Here then we find two different overflows or intrusions, one of them overlapping the other, and a rapid thinning out of the basaltic pseudostratum, which has a wedge-shape, and, in course of about 500 yards, dwindles from about 80 feet at Ratcheugh to only 3 at Snableazes. At the present day no shale is visible for some distance where the section is obscured, and it is difficult to see how a continuous spread of it could ever have been present, as the Whin is seen rising into a boss at the top of the road through the plantation to Dunsheugh. It is highly probable that, though Tate's section is in the main correct, the Whin is actually continuous, and that at the point where the section is obscured the intrusive mass has risen through a dislocation in the strata and overflowed on to higher beds. This is confirmed by the section in Snableazes quarry where the Whin is seen traversing from the limestone on to the overlying shales, while the lime stone, cropping out in the field further to the south, is greatly folded and disturbed. According to this hypothesis the portion of the Whin, mentioned by Tate as being only 3 feet thick, would be situated at the highest point of traverse of the igneous rock through the sedimentary strata, and might represent merely the lower layer of the sheet, and not the original thickness, the upper portion having been removed by subsequent denudation. 1 Vol. ii. app. v. 6."], [384, "HOWICK PARISH. 334 The metamorphism of the beds in connection with the Whin at Snab leazes quarry is by far the most extensive in the district, the shales for a considerable distance from the basalt being completely altered into 'porcel lanite' (the 'Adinole' of modern German authors),1 whilst the upper layers of the limestone are recrystallized. According to both Forster and Tate there occurs, interbedded with this limestone, a thin layer of Whin, 2 feet thick. The succession of limestone outcrops are perhaps better exhibited in these parishes than in any other parts of the district hitherto described in these volumes. At Little Mill a large spread of the Six-yard Limestone has been quarried for many years ; it is here thrown into violent folds by its proximity to the basalt on the east. According to notes by Mr. T. J. Taylor the total thickness of the limestone and associated beds here is 36 feet,2 but this estimate includes a lower bed of black limestone and the intermediate shales and sandstones. The rock is worked to a depth of about 15 feet in the quarry, the upper layers being characterised by the occurrence of Saccammina Carteri, and Productus giganteus is found plentifully in the lower part ofthe 'bottom bed' and in the underlying pyritous shale. The 'quarry coal,' six inches thick, occurs immediately beneath the latter. Fine exposures of this and associated limestones crop out round the north and west sides of Harlaw Hill, where they have been extensively quarried ; while above and below the basalt, as it sweeps along the Ratcheugh Crag, crop out respectively the Eight-yard and the Six-yard Limestones, the former bed being marked at Snableazes quarry (where it occurs under the Whin) by well-preserved speci mens of its characteristic fossil Saccammina Carteri. South-east of the Bastile, to the east of the railway, an undulating outcrop of the Great Lime stone has been quarried, and appears to spread south for a mile, till it is cut out by the fault running from the east-north-east to the coast a little north of Foxton hall. To the west of Lookout farm the inferior limestone beds rise to the surface. The coal beds worked in these parishes are almost confined to the Shil bottle seam, occurring below the Six-yard Limestone. At the colliery near Bilton Bank on the western border of Lesbury parish, where the seam is still worked, it is upwards of 2 feet thick, and lies 26 feet below the Six-yard Limestone.3 The pit section shows also the occurrence of two additional thin seams immediately below the Six-yard and Four-fathom Limestones respec- 1 Vol. ii. app. v. figs. 4, 5, 6. 2 Vol. ii. app. ii. B. ' Ibid. C, D."], [385, "GEOLOGY. 335 tively. Tate considered the seam in this pit as 'the best coal in the Mountain Limestone Formation.' In a boring, at Long Dyke pit, a Whin dyke was encountered 80 yards south of the pit, which prevented the coal from being reached at this spot.1 Mr. Greenwell describes it 'as of a peculiar char acter, the coal being exceedingly durable and hard, and the ash of a dark brown or rather purple colour, and very heavy.'2 In the section from the old pit it appears that there are, beneath the clay, 331 feet of strata to the bottom of the Shilbottle Main coal seam, containing seven seams of coal of the aggre gate thickness of 10 feet 9 inches, and four beds of limestone ofthe aggregate thickness of 50 feet. At Little Mill the seam has also been quarried and is here only 18 feet below the limestone.3 It is described as inferior coal, and the associated beds are so highly ferruginous that the water pumped from the pit killed the trout in Howick burn. At Little Houghton, where the same seam was formerly worked, the coal, according to Mr. T. J. Taylor in 1846, occurs 37 feet below the limestone and is of good quality.4 Another section of an old coal pit at Dunsheugh, described by the same careful observer, would appear, as suggested by him, to represent the same beds worked under the Whin to the south of Ratcheugh Crag.5 The signs of glaciation in these parishes are as well marked as any in the county. The undulating surface of the Six-yard Limestone at Little Mill has long been famous for its sine exhibition of grooves and scratches running north-north-west and south-south-east, and at Hawkhill the limestone, which is covered by boulder clay, is finely glaciated in the same direction, some of the grooves being from 6 to 12 inches long. The following description, given by Tate, is of interest, when we consider the date (1849) at which it was written : 6 Immediately below the red tough clay, the surface of the limestone bed is polished, scratched, and grooved. An area of 20 feet by 6 feet has been bored in this state, and the same polished and scratched surface extends under the clay. One part of this surface was flat and even, presenting a smooth, bright face, like marble artificially polished ; other portions were rounded and undulating, but still exhibiting the same mirror-like polish. One part, in particular, was 1 foot below the general level ; but in this and similar cases the angular corners of the higher portions were removed, and a smooth and rounded outline was formed. Besides being polished, the Haw-khill limestone was more or less scratched ; the scratches varying both in depth and in length, some being very fine stri\u00e6, and a few being grooves j to an inch in depth. . . . The Hawkhill boulder clay contained a number of blue limestone blocks from 6 inches to 18 inches in diameter, basalts from 6 inches to 2 feet in diameter, and sandstones and shales generally of a smaller size. These rocks are the same as appear in situ in the neighbourhood. There were, however, a few rocks which cannot as yet be identified as of local origin ; among these was a block of light cream ' Vol. ii. app. ii. E. 2 Vol. ii. app. i. 11. 3 Vol. ii. app. ii. F.

A similar rock in situ I have observed at Beal, at a distance of 20 miles north by west. Another limestone ofa bright red colour, which is not uncommon in the boulder clay further north, was also found in the Hawkhill clay. After alluding to other similar sections in Northumberland, he concludes his description with a discussion as to the probable origin of the boulder clay formation, in which, after stating various objections to the theory attributing its origin to water or glacier ice, he concludes by naming icebergs as the agents which seem most likely to have transported the far-travelled blocks, and to have polished and striated the rocks. On the path immediately east of Bilton Banks, in the parish of Lesbury, the projecting portions of sandstone are seen to be deeply grooved in a north north-west and south-south-east direction. Deposits of boulder clay cover a considerable area, and sections through it are seen at several places along the coast, especially in the bay south of Howick burn, where enormous blocks of Whin and limestone, mixed with smaller fragments of Cheviot porphyrites, are washed out by the waves, many of them being scratched and polished. Large boulders of the baked pink limestone with green crinoid stems, already mentioned, are numerous in places. These boulders, the majority of which are of Whin, can be seen at low tide scattered along the shore in countless numbers, as far south as Alnmouth. At Seaton Point stratified sands occur as follows : Unstratified boulder clay ; clay, semistratified, 3 feet ; sandy clay, stratified, 1 foot ; broken and angular sandstone fragments, 3 feet ; sandstone. In the railway cutting at Lesbury, Tate mentions 'six distinctly stratified beds consisting of rolled smooth stones, chiefly porphyries, limestones and sandstones, about the size of ordinary paving stones : above these was a stiff bed of clay 8 feet high, without boulders, and above this again was another bed of clay 8 feet high, with large boulders ; the layers were arched, dipping away on both sides from a central axis.1 Near Alnmouth on the bank of the river is a similar compli cated section: Stratified sand, 15 feet; red tough clay with large glaciated blocks, 12 feet; sand irregularly stratified (in some parts, which are clavey, are scattered small subangular and rounded blocks), 30 feet ; tough red clay with glaciated boulders. 1 Vol. i. app. i. 14. 2 In the cliff at Howick there occurs a well-marked bed of stratified and recemented pebbles, 50 feet above present high water mark : the pebbles are derived from the Boulder clay and the deposit, which averages 18 inches in thickness, luns for upwards of 160 yards to the north of Saker's gate, till cut out by denudation. No marine shells have yet been found, but the formation may prove to be a ' raised beach.'"], [387, "HOWICK. 337 HOWICK. Howick has been well described by General Grey in the life of his father the second Earl Grey.1 'A minute description of Howick, its house and grounds,' says General Grey, 'would be of little interest to strangers.

Howick, though it has no pretensions to be classed amongst the fine places of England, and, though the surrounding country has little beauty to recommend it, yet may be confidently asserted to be, as it now exists, the creation of my father, one of the most comfortable and enjoyable residences to be found in the kingdom. The house stands on the north side of a little brook, which, issuing from woods, mostly of my father's own planting, to the west, makes a tolerably wide sweep directly in its front, and then again disappearing between high banks, winds its way through a pretty glen for about a mile and a half to the sea.' General Grey proceeds to describe the glen 'wooded on both sides to the verv beach,' and the 'long walk' down the glen, by the side of the stream. The 'long walk' emerges on the sea-shore, where it 'turns to the north and follows the indentures of the coast, above the rocks, of which it here almost entirely con sists, for a mile and a half to the northern boundary of the estate Other walks there are, all laid out by my father himself, formed and kept with the greatest care. But the walk down the glen, known as the \"long walk,\" and that along the sea-shore, have seemed to me to deserve special mention, not only as giving in fact a character to the place, but as the round, which each Sunday in succession my father would take with his familv. . . . . It is difficult to exaggerate the beautv and varietv of the sea-coast and views that met you at every turn on the sea-walk.' Howick hall, which General Grey describes as the creation of his father, was built by Sir Henry Grey, eldest brother of the first Earl Grey, in 1782, from designs by Newton of Newcastle. The house, which is a fine building in the 'classical' style, was subsequently enlarged and altered by the second 1 Some account of the Life and Opinions of Charles, second Earl Grey, by Lieut.-General the Hon.

It stands upon the site of a small medi\u00e6val tower, which was pulled down in 1780 to make way for the new building. Amongst the pictures, which the house contains, are two portraits, one of Dr. Benjamin Franklin, and the other of the Emperor Napoleon I., which are rendered of especial interest by the circumstances under which they came into the posses sion of the Grev family. The circumstances are narrated by the late Earl Grey as follows : l 'The picture of Dr. Franklin was sent here by my grand father,2 who, being in command of a brigade of the royal army during the war of the American Revolution, had received it from his aide-de-camp, Captain Andre. Mr. Bache, Franklin's son-in-law, wrote on the 14th July, 1778, after the evacuation of Philadelphia, that the British officers, who had occupied Franklin's house for eight months, left it in much better order than he expected, but that 'a Captain Andre took with him the picture of you which hung in the dining-room.'3 I have not the means of referring to a letter of Dr. Franklin himself on the same subject, which, unless my memory deceives me, is also to be found in Sparks's Life of Franklin. In this letter Dr. Franklin expresses his regret that this picture had been taken away, as it was considered very like him. The Captain Andr\u00a3, already mentioned, was the same officer, who afterwards was hanged as a spy by Washington. This, there is no reason to doubt, was a legitimate exercise of the rights of war, as recognised by civilised nations, but I have always considered it to have been a cruel one. With regard to the other picture, it was one ordered by Napoleon himself during the Hundred Days, and for which he sat, but after Waterloo he was no longer in a situation to be able to take it, and no one else cared to purchase a picture of the fallen emperor, so that the artist could not dispose of it as he wished to do. Sir Robert Wilson, an old friend of my father, being then in Paris, heard of this, and wrote to my father that if he wished to have the picture he could buy it for him at a moderate price, which my father desired him to do. M. de Flahault, who was one of Napoleon's aides-de-camp at Waterloo and accompanied him in his flight, was often here [at Howick] afterwards, and told me that this picture was exceedingly like Napoleon, as he was when it was painted, though so little like him in the early days of his career.'

It stands upon high ground overlooking the coast, and its form is shown in Mr. MacLauchlan's plan of it, which is here reproduced. The camp is 56 vards in diameter, and is well protected on the south and south-east sides by the formation of the ground, which slopes rapidly to the Howick burn, about 100 feet beneath.2 At the close of the twelfth century Howick was held as a fee of the baronv of AInwick J by a knight named Adam Ribalt or Rvbaud, who be- _i 1 longed to a family already mentioned in the history of Scale, 8 chains to an inch. the township of Broxfield.3 Adam Rybaud's land at Howick became after wards the property of his descendant, Hugh Rybaud, from whom it passed 1 Amongst these may be mentioned, the library of Holland house, with portraits of Lord and Lady Holland, and Mr. Allen, Leslie; Curran, Lawrence; the second Earl Grey, Lawrence; The Last Sleep of Argyle, Northcote; the Grey family, Thompson; the first and second Earls Grey, Lawrence; etc. In the outer hall is a statue of the second earl, by Campbell, presented to the Countess Grey by her husband's friends in 1834. 2 ' About four hundred yards east from the hall is a beautiful fish-pond which covers five acres, and was formed in 1819.

The latter, by a deed dated 19th Aug., 1281, conceded to John de Vesci, and his tenants of Long Houghton, rights of common and pasture at a place between Long Houghton and Howick, which had for a long time been the subject of dispute. The deed was executed at AInwick in the presence of William Rybaud's father, Adam.2 By another deed, dated at AInwick, 1 2th Jan., 1282, William Rvbaud transferred to John de Vesci the homage due from Robert Mautalent and his heirs for his tenements in Howick.3 By virtue of this deed Howick became divided between two freeholders, William Rybaud and Robert Mautalent, who held the township on the 7th May, 1289, as one knight's fee, by the annual payment of a mark to the owners of the barony of AInwick. The township is stated to have been worth a year at that time.4 The name of Robert Mautalent appears on the list of those who paid subsidy at Howick in 1296.

The family of Harang, or Hering, was one of great antiquity. The founder of the family was Gilbert de St. Clare, probably a Norman knight, who held the township of Little Houghton in the twelfth century. The earliest information relating to the Harangs is contained in an inspeximus by Edward I. of certain ancient deeds relating to Alnwick abbey, amongst which was one of Gilbert de St. Clare, granting to the abbey two bovates in Little Houghton.

Peter Harang married Margaret, daughter and heiress of Jermain Rybaud, by whom he had the son John, already mentioned, another son Thomas, and a daughter Rose. John Harang, who succeeded to his grandfather's land at Little Houghton,2 subsequently inherited, through his mother's father, Jermain Rybaud, an estate at Howick which he settled, in 1279, upon his son Robert.3 At about the same time John Harang's brother, Thomas, bestowed upon his sister, Rose, all the land in Howick which Margeria, his mother, had given him by her charter, 'that is to say Symon son of Ralph, my serf, with all his following and all his chattels,' with two bovates which Symon held of him, and two fields called Kengesflatte and Scortsflatte.

At the same period Walter de Wythill bestowed an annual revenue of half a mark upon the same religious house on behalf of his father Gilbert, Alice his mother, and Alice his wife. The pavment of this sum was charged upon the land of Gilbert de Wythill in Howick, which Adam, son of Bryan of Howick, and Leticia, his wife, had formerly held.2 In the middle of the fourteenth century the head of the family seems to have been Robert Hering, who received, by royal grant, the wardship of cer tain lands in Howick in 1352. 3 At his death he was succeeded by his son, Emeric Hering, who afterwards became a prominent citizen of Newcastle upon-Tyne. Emeric Hering is described as a 'chaplain' in a deed preserved in the Durham Treasurv, bv which, in conjunction with John Lange, he, as trustee, settled an estate in Howick on the illegitimate children of John del Chapell of Howick.

In 1415 he was in possession of a tower at Howick,1 which was described in 1538 as 'a little pile, a mile from the shore.'2 Shortlv afterwards, in the years 142 1-2, he was a representative of Newcastle upon-Tyne in Parliament,3 and five years later, in 1427, his land at Howick had become the property of Adomar Hering, probably his brother.4 Adomar Hering was a representative of Newcastle-upon-Tyne in the Parliament of 1425.5 The Herings retained a moiety of Howick during the remainder of the fifteenth and the whole of the sixteenth centurv, when they gradually lapsed into the small yeoman class. Owing to the subordinate position which they occupied information with regard to them becomes more scanty, but it is possible to trace various successive generations of the family throughout this period. In 1488-9 Peter Hering held a moiety of Howick,6 and in 1541 Robert Hering held the same portion of the township, Sir Ralph Grey being the owner of the other half.7 He may be identified with Robert Hering, whose son William was involved in a dispute with Archdeacon Lever, the rector of Howick, about the payment of tithes. The following are the depositions of witnesses in the suit, examined before the Durham Consistory Court in the year 1 57 1 : John Ladyman of Howick, curate, aged 25, saith the said Mr Levir haith bein parson of Howik by the spaice of ij yeres last past and more.

George Middleham's wife, to whom he refers in his will, was Barbara, daughter of John Carr of Lesbury. The latter in his will, dated 17th Oct., 1587, proved in 1589, savs: 'I commit Agnes Midlam to the tuicion of my wife, desiring John Carr of Hetton to defend her title to her father's inherit ance. And whereas I am charged by the executors of George Midlam to have conveyed some part of her evidences privily away, here I take it upon my conscience that I have not hurt or empared them the breadth of my naile, nor ever concealed anie part thereof from theme.' 1 Isabel Hering's son Robert, with Margaret his wife, shortly before his mother's death, had sold his share of Howick to Sir Edward Grey of Morpeth castle, by conveyances dated ioth May, 1597, and Sth Oct., 1599.2 The estate included 'all their lands in Howick called the town farm hold and the green, together with all evidences, escripts, and myniments.' Unfortunately these records, some of which were doubtless of great antiquity, have perished with the other old documents relating to Lord Grey's estate at Howick.3 The terms ofthe conveyance were soon afterwards the subject of dispute, as it was alleged that Robert Hering, who died about the 6th Sept., 1599, had only a life interest in his farmhold which he was not competent to sell. On a list of freeholders of the AInwick barony compiled in April, 1602, it is stated that 'Robert Herynge dyed seysed of the half of Howicke and ane estate for terme of lyes, and William Heryng is his sonne and next heare, and ofthe age of xvij yeres.'4 There is also a memorandum, dated 22nd March, 1603, directing the earl of Northumberland's officer 'to seaz the lands of William Heringe in Howyke, Alnewyk, and other places, agenst his lord ship's next audyt.'5 Eventually the dispute was settled, and the land was divided in 1607 between Sir Edward Grey and John Craster.6 After that date the Herings, whose ancestors had resided at Howick since the twelfth century, are not again mentioned in connection with the place. The descent of the other half of the township, which was granted by Adam Rybaud's successor, William Rybaud, to Robert Mautalent before the year 1282,7 remains to be traced. This portion became afterwards the pro perty of John Mautalent, who transferred his allegiance to the Scottish king during the wars in the reign of Edward II. For that reason his lands in Howick, stated to be of the annual value of \u00a39 6s., were confiscated by the 1 Durham Probate Registry. 2 Lord Grey's MSS. 3 Large masses of papers are said to have been destroyed by a fire which occurred at Howick hall.

It was stipulated that Thomas de Grey should also have the reversion of six husbandlands at Howick, then in the possession of Christiana, the mother of John Mautalent.2 At the same time a small parcel of John Mautalent's land, which was not in cluded in the grant to Thomas de Grey, was given to Adam de Benton. This land was generally worth thirty shillings a year, but in 1362 was only worth twenty shillings 'on account ofthe pestilence then lately passed.' From this it appears that Howick was not exempt from the effects of the plague which devastated the district in the middle of the fourteenth century.3 J The moiety of the township, acquired in 13 19, has remained in the hands of the Grey family from that time to the present. Howick does not, how ever, appear to have been the residence of any member of the family until the close of the sixteenth century, when, as has been already stated, Edward Grey of Morpeth (afterwards Sir Edward Grey, knight, of Howick) acquired the estate which had belonged to the Herings.4 He had previously, on the 1 Inq. ad quod damnum, 12 Ed.

The following is an abstract ofthe will of John Todd, in which Thomas Graye is men- tioned : 'Will, dated 7 Sept., 1597 [proved 1598], of John Todd of Howicke, coteman. Item, I give to my wife and my children, if my wife passe through this sickness that now she is visited wyth, my goods ; and if my wife dye, then I give all my goods to pay my debts withall, and for the use of my children, to my neighbour, Thomas Graye, and trust he will act as a father to my children ; after all debts are paid, and if my browne koue can be saved and two calves, I will that the said Thomas Graye give the same to my daughter, Jane Todd. I make my aforesaid neighbour and friend, Thomas Gray, executor of my will.'

He says : 'The historv of a family of this antiquitv, possessed of extensive estates, allied to the chief nobilitv ofEngland, nav, even to royalty itself, frequentlv employed in the service ofthe Borders or in wars at home or abroad, would of itself supply ample matter for a volume of a considerable size. No familv, perhaps in the whole of England, has in the course of the centuries through which the line of Grey can be traced, afforded so great a variety of character. It has had its warriors and its statesmen, its authors and its divines . . and to come to the present time [1845] it can boast of a statesman, whose name will descend to posterity as the chief promoter of one of the most important political changes which has been effected in the British constitution for many a century. But the nature of a work like that upon which I am engaged does not admit of matter belonging to general history.'3 It will be necessary here to recognise the same limitations with regard to the connection of the family with the general history of the kingdom at large, which Dr. Raine imposed upon himself, and it must suffice to place before the reader the pedigree of the Greys of Howick with such illustrations and evidences as space and the scope of this work will admit.

On 6 May, 1554, Ralph Grey entered into a covenant with Sir Francis Inglefield, master of the queen's Court of Wards, to maintain the castle of Wark at his own charges in as good order as it then was, and to keep a resident garrison consisting of a porter and eight soldiers. That he had been somewhat inattentive to his duties may be inferred from a letter in Sadler's State Papeis (vol. i. p. 414), by which the earl of Northumberland, as warden of the East and Middle Marches, and Sir Ralph Sadler were directed to call Sir Ralph Grey before them, 'to charge him to make his repair to that castle, and to follow also such order for the surety there of, as being agreeable to his covenant.' On 30 Nov., 1559, Sadler wrote to Cecil, informing him that he had promised 'x8 a day to Sir Ralph Grey for the Est Marches,' of which Sir Ralph Grey had been appointed deputy warden. In 1552 Sir Ralph Grey was one of the commissioners for the enclosure of the East Marches, and was sheriff of Northumberland, 1562-3.

Newcastle Courant, 7 March, 1752. 25 Charles Grey was born at Howick in 1729, and in 1746 became an ensign in the 6th Regiment ; he afterwards raised men to form an independent company, and was made captain in the 20th Regiment, 21 March, 1755. In 1758 he served with the 20th Regiment in the expedition to St. Malo. He accompanied the regiment to Germany, where he was wounded at the battle of Minden, 1 Aug., 1759. On the 16th of October, 1760, he was in command of the same regiment at the action fought at Kloster-Kampen, which lasted for twenty hours. Captain Grey was again wounded in this engagement. On 21 Jan., 1761, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-colonel, and received the command of the 98th Regiment, with which he served in Portugal. He was appointed aide-de-camp to the king in Dec., 1772, and major-general on 29 Aug., 1777. He afterwards commanded a brigade of General Sir William Howe's division in the American War, where he gained the soubriquet of 'No-flint-Grey ' from the following circum stances. On the night of the 20th of Sept., 1777, when the American general Anthony Wayne and his troops were occupying some houses in the village of Trudrufifin, about 20 miles from Philadelphia, he was attacked by a strong detachment under Major General Grey, and, although he had taken measures to guard against a surprise, the onslaught was so sudden that his men, who were sleeping on their arms, were unable to make an effective resistance, and above 150 were either killed or wounded with the bayonet. As the success of the attack depended on the completeness of the surprise, General Grey gave orders that his men's muskets should not be loaded, but, just before reaching the scene of action, he discovered that his second in command, being nervous about going into a fight with unloaded arms, had made the men load. Much displeased, General Grey, as it was impossible to draw the charges from the muskets, thought the only way, to guard against the risk of marring the completeness of the surprise, was to have the flints taken out of the muskets, and so make his men understand that they must trust entirely to the bayonet. In the following month Grey was opposed to Washington on 4 Oct., 1777, at German-town, Philadelphia, and fought in"], [408, "358 HOWICK PARISH. numerous engagements during the next five years. In Jan., 1783, he was nominated to the command of the forces in North America with the local rank of general, but in Sept. of the same year he was transferred to the command of an expedition against Martinique, St. Lucia, and Guadaloupe. In 1782 he was made Knight of the Bath, and was pro moted to the rank of general in 1796, when he was appointed to the command of the Southern District (Portsmouth). In the following year he became Governor of Guernsey and a member of the Privy Council. On 23 Jan., 1801, he was raised to the peerage with the title of Baron Grey de Howick, and on 11 April, 1S06, was created Viscount Howick, and Earl Grey. See History of the loth Regiment, by Lieutenant Smyth, and the Dictionary of National Biography. \" Charles Grey, afterwards the second Earl Grey, the eldest surviving son of the first earl, was born at Fallodon, 13 March, 1764. He was educated at Eton with Wellesley and Porson under Dr. Davies, and at King's college, Cambridge, which he quitted in 1784, before attaining his majority, to travel on the Continent in the suite of Henry, duke of Cumberland. A vacancy having occurred in the representation of his native county, he was recalled from his travels by his uncle Sir Henry Grey, who issued an address to the freeholders in which he assured the electors that ' nothing could have tempted me to take this liberty, but my persuasion that his principles and his future conduct will not disappoint the expectation of those with whose approbation he may be favoured.' He was returned as member for Northumberland in July, 1786, and made his maiden speech 21 Feb., 1787, in opposition to the address to thank the king for the commercial treaty which Pitt had just concluded with France, 'greatly condemning it.' Mr., afterwards Speaker, Addington, who was present on the occasion, says, ' he went through his first performance with an Sclal which has not been equalled within my recollection. He is not more than 22 years of age. I do not go too far in declaring that in the advantage of figure, voice, elocution, and manner he is not surpassed by any member of the House : and I grieve to say that he was last night in the ranks of opposition, from whence there is no chance of his being detached.' How the expectation and promises, alike of the partial uncle and of the generous political opponent, were amply justified and fulfilled, his fellow countrymen know. He was shortly afterwards named one of the managers charged with the impeachment of Warren Hastings. Of his conduct in that capacity Macaulay says in his essay on Warren Hastings : ' Nor, though surrounded by such men, did the youngest manager pass unnoticed. At an age when most of those who distinguished themselves in life are still contending for prizes and fellowships at College, he had won for himself a conspicuous place in Parliament. No advantage of fortune or connexion was wanting that could set off to the height his splendid talents and unblemished honour. At twenty-three he had been thought worthy to be ranked with the veteran statesmen who appeared as the delegates of the British Commons, at the bar of the British nobility. All who stood at that bar, save him alone, are gone, culprit, advocates, accusers. To the generation which is now [1841] in the vigour of life, he is the sole representative of a great age which has passed away. But those who, within the last ten years, have listened with delight, till the morning sun shone on the tapestries of the House of Lords, to the lofty and animated eloquence of Charles, Earl Grey, are able to form some estimate of the power of a race of men among whom he was not the foremost.' In 1806 Grey, as Viscount Howick (his father having been created Earl Grey), was for a short time First Lord of the Admiralty in the administration of Grenville and Fox, and became soon afterwards Minister for Foreign Affairs. Upon the death of Fox, Lord Howick became leader of the Whig section of the Government, and in 1807 was summoned to the House of Lords as Earl Grey, after his father's death. At about the same time the ministry resigned. For the next twenty-four years Grey, being out of office, did not take a very prominent part in politics, but con tinued to support the Catholic claims, and deprecated the assumption by England of the part of principal in the Spanish war. In 1830 he became identified with the party in savour of Parliamentary reform, when the ministry of the duke of Wellington was in power. Eventually, after a protracted straggle, authority was given by William IV. to Earl Grey, on 17 May. 1832, to create a number of peers sufficient to secure the passage of the Great Reform Bill through the House of Lords, and the opposition to the measure thereupon collapsed. In 1833 Earl Grey retired from public life, in which he had obtained distinction by his great powers of oratory and readiness in debate. Earl Grey was a Knight of the Garter, and governor of the Charter house. He died at Howick, 17th July, 1845. A monument, bearing a statue of Earl Grey, stands at the head of Grey Street in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, bearing the following inscription : ' This column was erected in 1838, to commemorate the services rendered to his country by Charles Earl Grey, K.G., who, during an active political career of nearly half a century, was the constant advocate of peace, and the fearless and consistent champion of civil and religious liberty. He first directed his efforts to the amendment of the representation of the people in 1792, and was the minister by whose advice, and under whose guid ance, the great measure of Parliamentary Reform was, after an arduous and protracted struggle, safely and triumphantly achieved in the year 1832.' See Dictionary of Nalional Biography. -7 Charles Grey, second son of the second Earl Grey, was born at Howick, 15th March, 1804. He entered the army in 1820.

He was private secretary to his father when First Lord of the Treasury, and soon after the Queen's accession became one of her equerries. He was private secretary to Prince Albert from 1849 until the Prince's death, from which time he served the Queen as private secretary and as joint keeper of the Privy Purse, until his own death, 31st March, 1870. He represented High Wycombe in Parliament from 1831 to 1837. He wrote a life of his father, entitled, Some .Account of the Life and Opinions of Charles, second Earl Grey, London, 1861, and compiled, under the Queen's direction, The Early Years of His Royal Highness the Prince Consort, London, 1867. 29 Henry, third Earl Grey, K.G., D.C.L., born 28 Dec., 1802, bap. 8 Feb., 1803, died 9 Oct., 1894, represented Winchilsea in Parliament as Viscount Howick in 1826, and Higham Ferrers in 1830. He was returned as repre sentative of Northumberland at the General Election of 1831, and afterwards sat as member for North Northumber land in the reformed Parliament till 1841. In the first Reform administration Viscount Howick was Under-Secretary for the Colonies, but resigned office because he disapproved of some of the details of the measure for the emancipa tion of the slaves. In 1835 he became Secretary for War in Lord Melbourne's administration which went out of office in 1841. In the General Election of that year Lord Howick lost his seat for North Northumberland, and became member for Sunderland. In 1845 he succeeded to the peerage on the death of his father, and became Colonial and War Secretary in Lord John Russell's ministry ; which was replaced by that of Earl Derby in 1852. Earl Grey published the following works : The Colonial Policy of Lord John Russell's Administration by Earl Grey, 2 vols., London, 1853 ; Parliamentary Government Considered with Reference to a Reform of Parliament, an Essay by Loi-d Grey, I vol., London, 1858 ; The Correspondence of King William IV. with Earl Grey, 2 vols., London, 1867. Earl Grey, who always took an active interest in politics, was one of the last of the great statesmen of the Reform era. The Church. Ralph Flambard, who was bishop of Durham from 1099 to 11 28, gave to the convent of Durham the land called 'Hewic,' which Aedward the monk (who built the priory church of Lindisfarne) had previously held. The bishop at the same time granted that the sheep belonging to the convent should enjoy pasture upon the common in 'Hewic,' where the sheep of the bishop and his men were accustomed to graze.1 From this deed it appears that some land at Howick had, from ancient times, belonged to the see of Durham, and it is probable that it constituted the glebe of the chapel, of which Aedward the monk was perhaps the chaplain before he was sent to Lindisfarne.2 How ever this may be, there was a chapel at Howick before the year 1158, of which the first recorded incumbent was Asket' the priest.3 ''Ranulfus, Dei gratia Dunelmensis episcopus, Papeden et omnibus hominibus de Aelandscire et Northamscire salutem.

A perfect seal of Bishop Ralph is appended to the deed, which is endorsed in a contemporary hand : ' Ranulfus episcopus de Hewic et communi pastura.' 2 The late Dr. Raine thought that 'Hewic' ought not to be identified with Howick, but did not suggest any other place with which it could be identified. A fifteenth-century endorsement of the deed and an entry in the Repertorium support the view that Hewic is identical with Howick. 3 See p. 228, note 2."], [410, "360 HOWICK PARISH. Since the time of Bishop Ralph the benefice of Howick appears to have remained in the possession of the convent until the time of the Dissolution, and after that time of the dean and chapter of Durham. The rectory was for a long time attached to the archdeaconry of Northumberland, until by an order in council, dated 27th Aug., 1842, it was separated from the arch deaconry, and constituted an independent benefice. It is now in the gift of the bishop of Newcastle. The modern church, dedicated to St. Michael, stands upon the site of the older chapel in the grounds of Howick hall. The adjoining graveyard is shaded by many ancient yews, which overhang the Howick burn.1 An inscrip tion in the church itself records the fact that 'this church was built at ye expence of Sr Hen. Grey, bart., 1746,' and another inscription states that 'this church was rebuilt and enlarged by Henry, third Earl Grey, in the year 1849.' A sketch preserved in the vestry shows that the church, built by Sir Henry Grey, was an entirely new building, intended to resemble a Greek temple, and retained no traces of the older Norman chapel which it probably super seded. The alterations and enlargement, carried out by the third Earl Grey in 1849, have done much to modify the design of his predecessor. Rectors.2 1822, 6 Jan. Oswald Head, M.

The parish of Long Houghton, which contains 4,007 acres, is bounded by the parishes of Howick and Embleton upon the north, AInwick on the west, and Lesbury on the south. The parish comprises the three townships of Long Houghton, Little Houghton, and Boulmer with Seaton House. It is about two miles in length along the sea-shore from Iron Scars to Seaton Point, and three and a half miles in breadth from Denwick Lane end on the western boundary to Long Houghton Steel, a promontory on the coast. The township of Long Houghton, containing 2,789 acres, constitutes the greater part of the parish. From the summit of Ratcheugh Crag, a precipi tous hill 400 feet in height near the western boundary, a fine view may be obtained of the surrounding country. To the east a long stretch of the sea coast is visible, broken by many jutting headlands, which form with broad curving sweeps the intervening bays. To the south and west the prospect embraces the fertile valley through which the Ain threads its way with con tinual windings to the sea. To the north-west the pale blue line of the Cheviots may be seen beyond the wooded slopes of AInwick and the higher moorlands of Eglingham. Beneath is the hamlet of Long Houghton, brightened by the red-tile roofs of the cottages, above which rises the massive grey tower of the church, the only place of strength to which the villagers could formerly resort in time of trouble.1 There was formerly a well defined prehistoric camp upon Ratcheugh Crag, which was so far destroyed about a century ago that it is difficult now to ascertain its dimensions or describe its shape. Traces of its outlines, however, were in existence when Mr. MacLauchlan visited the spot, which were sufficient to enable him to make the plan of the entrenchments here reproduced.

He and his widow, Constancia, ultimately resigned their interest in the mill to John de Vesci, for an annual revenue of twelve marks, and the whole of the township was afterwards held by small copyholders immediately of the lords of the barony.4 The earliest 1 Catalogue of Antiquities at AInwick castle, p. u, engraved on plate viii. 2 Tate MSS.

It is fortunate that the surveyor upon this occasion discharged his duties in a very conscientious manner, by writing a report in which he not onlv presents a faithful and finished picture of the conditions of life in the village at that time, but also refers to the state of affairs in times anterior to those in which he wrote, and to institutions which were passing away. In this report the surveyor, after briefly describing the nature of the soil, refers to the division of the township into two parts, and recites the reasons which had led to the division. His remarks Upon this subject are best illustrated and explained by refer ence to the map of Long Houghton made in 16 19. This map, when studied in conjunction with the survey, shows that in the early years of the sixteenth century Long Houghton contained three common fields of arable land, namely, the East field, the West field, and the South field. At some time shortly before the year 1567, these three fields were divided into two portions, in such a way that the West field, the northern half of the South field, and the northern part of the East field constituted one half of the township, and the south part of the South field with the south part of the East field con stituted the other half. The division was made in order that the tenants might enjoy greater convenience for the cultivation of their lands. Before the partition, in consequence of Long Houghton being 'a very long towne,' the tenants had been obliged to travel long distances to reach their strips, scattered in outlying portions of the township, but, when the partition was made, the land was rendered more accessible to the tenants dwelling in the north and south ends of the village respectively. The effect of the division was generally beneficial to the tenants, by whose wish it was made, but the advantages which resulted were not sufficient to silence the complaints of some who thought that they had sustained injustice. A brief time elapsed 1 On one of the rolls of the receivers of the earl of Northumberland's estate, dated 1 503, there are some entries relating to payments made by the bailiff of Long Houghton. The bailiff paid xiis. to the sacrist of AInwick abbey, to provide three stone of wax for the candles used at the obsequies of the earls. He also gave 3s. 4d. to Thomas Ryddall, chaplain, for taking care of the earl's clock in AInwick castle ('pro custodes. orilog' ejusdem domini infra castrum de Alnewyk'). Ibid."], [418, "368 LONG HOUGHTON PARISH. before the tenants of the north end discovered that their neighbours of the south end enjoyed the better half in all respects, and the disposition of the meadow and pasture under the new arrangement gave rise to general com plaint. The surveyor in 1567 found so much disorder prevailing, that he thought a good double dike, set with quick wood, should be made to separate the villagers of the north and south ends from one another. His advice appears to have been followed, as the map shows a well marked division between the respective portions. After referring to the division the surveyor proceeds to set out the boundaries of the township, and to give full particulars as to the names of the tenants and the size of their holdings.1 He then refers to the reduction of the number of husbandlands from twenty-eight to twenty-seven. He recom mends that the tenants should be obliged to render assistance to one another whenever it should be necessary to rebuild houses which had fallen into ruin, and that a good blacksmith should be maintained on the land set apart for that purpose. He then describes an institution which was falling into disuse, namely the division of the town into 'ploughdaylles' or groups of four tene ments. The possessor of each of these tenements had formerly a cottage appertaining to it, in which a fisherman was maintained. Every 'plough daylle' in this way provided a crew of four men for a coble, and the fish procured by the coble were a useful addition to the means of livelihood enjoyed by the tenants. Moreover in harvest time the crews of the cobles could be utilized as reapers. After briefly touching upon other topics, the surveyor states that persons had been formerly appointed by the lord's court to keep good houses of entertainment for travellers, and no one else had been allowed to make entertainments for profit, but a lax custom had been intro duced by which bridal feasts and dinners to celebrate the churching of women were provided -by unauthorised persons.

In the opinion of one of the earl of Northumberland's advisers nothing was so necessary, in order to stop the raids, as the appointment of a 'gentleman of worship' to be constable of Aln wick castle ; 3 but the earl was singularly unfortunate in his choice, when he selected his kinsman, Thomas Percy, for that office. The complaints against him were numerous. In 1602 Robert Clerke, one of the tenants of Long Houghton, whose name has been already mentioned, was examined before ft J 'John Ogle of Casse parke and Raphe Carre of Howbourne.' Clerke said that he had placed twenty sheep hogs in the charge of a neighbour, who shortly afterwards asked Clerke to send for them, as a disease had broken out among them, and several had died. Clerke asked how many were alive, and was informed that there were eleven left, but when he received them he could not count more than ten : Whereupon Clerke seemed to be verie angrie that he should lacke one of his nomber in one night, and said he would chardge him for all the whole ; notwithstandinge he receaved these tenne. The next day, they being put foorth to the feild, there comes a hogg to them with the same mark, and came home to his house with the said hogges, which Clerke seeinge thought it had bene his owne hogge that his neighbour had denyed the day before. He tooke it into his own house, and, perceavinge the marke wearinge away, did renewe it againe, and afterwards perceaved that it had not his eare marke ; but the matter rested untill one of his neighbors came and made claime to the said hogge, to whome Clerke answered that, if it were his, he had nothinge to say to it. The other refused it, sayinge he had sett his owne marke on yt. The poore man, for feare of trouble, was content to geve x' and his hogge againe, which the other tooke for his full satisfaccon. In processe of tyme it was made knowen to Mr Percye, who sent for the said Clerke and put him in Alnewick castle, who could not be releassed untill he had condiscended to geve Mr Percy xx11 for the said fault. And further did geve to one Thomas Adame 40\" to bringe him to that agreement who was at that instant bailifie of Longhoughton. We [the judges] asked him what he meant to geve so much money for so small a fault. He aunswered that a neighbor of his, dwellinge in Denneck, for the receipt of a waife shepe, notwithstandinge that he made proclamatioon the markets daies in Alnewick markett, was taken and put in Alnewick castle and paid x\" for the said fault and therefore made me compound.

The boy was, however, placed in the hands of Robert Mellet, Thomas Percy's servant, with his 'portion' of Mellet shortly afterwards dying, Thomas Carr of Boulmer and Mellet's father asked Percy to allow Dunne to have the tuition of the child, and Dunne gave Percy 20s. for his 'goodwill.' Dunne had the wardship for three years, but Percy then deprived him of it, and would not suffer Dunne to 'mowe his meadow nor shear his corne, until he was enforced bv the order of two spiritual men to pay Mr. Percy \u00a34.' Moreover, when he was sum moned to AInwick on the day of 'trewe,' Percy sent messengers ordering Dunne to send him his nag. Dunne replied that he himself 'was as sufficient to serve his lordship as any that he would set upon him, and going with his neighbours to meet Mr. Percy, he [Percy] took the said Dunne by the collar and pulled him off his horse, bidding him walk like a knave.'1 Several letters of this period, preserved among the duke of Northumber land's muniments, refer to Long Houghton mill. It will be remembered that, when the manor was surveyed in 1368, there were two water mills, only one of which was in working order. The manorial mill appears to have been afterwards transferred to the banks of the Ain in the township of Lesbury, where a mill was until recent times known as Long Houghton mill. It stood on the Ain between Lesburv mill and Bilton mill, in the hollow of the road near the railway viaduct. The mill, which was at all times an important part of the manorial economy, is specially referred to in the survey of Long Houghton made in 1567, as follows: The tenants of this towne of Great Howghton are bounde to grynde ther corne at Howghton mylne, and to be ther multerid at the xiij'1' corne ; they are grevously mercyed if they or any of them be convicted in the courte of Howghton for goyng awaye with anye corne to be grounde at any other mylne. They do also leaid the mylne stones great tymbre to the said mylne, and maynteneth the mylne house in reperations from the east ende of the said mylne to the mylne hirst and hopper, which is the chardge of the fermor to bylde and maynteyne ; the said tenants do lyckwyse repare the mylne dame so often as neade do require. The said tenants geve yearly to the said fenner certayne moulter malte, called drye malte, viz., everye tenant one boulle beire malte, to be paid unto the said fermor of the said mylne at or before Sainct Peter daye in June, amountyng to in all xxvij booles. It is to be noted that the mylne of Houghton standeth and is sett within the lordshippe of Lesburye, and was somtyme Lesburye mylne, but for that the same was by my lord's antecessors considered, that one mylne was sufficient to serve the inhabiters of the lordship of Lesburye, they having two mylnes, the one of them was taikyng by them 1 Duke of Northumberland's MSS."], [428, "376 LONG HOUGHTON PARISH. from Lesburye and maide parcell of Howghton, gevyng and grantyng unto the tenants of Howghton sufficient waye unto the same mylne, and chardgyng them with the lick services as the inhabiters of the said lordship of Lesburye was bounde to do or maike to the said mylne.1 At the end of the sixteenth century Long Houghton mill was in the tenure of Thomas Dackam, an old servant of the earl of Northumberland, as lessee. Writing to the earl on 18th April, 1605, Dackam asks for a renewal of the lease, and states that he was unable to appear before the earl's commis sioners because he 'was commaunded in the king's majestie's service att Dur hame aboute recusants' lands and goods, and made receyvor thereof.' In his absence grave accusations had been made against him, but he comforts him self with the reflection that 'your lordship did never charge me with one groate wrongfullie gotten, I thanke God for yt.'2 On 6th Sept., in the following year, the earl wrote to Robert Delaval, his officer, requesting him to ascertain what Houghton mill was worth 'at the rack,' and 'what the moulter maulte wil be worth at the uttermost valewe of Lesbury millnes.'3 Shortly afterwards some confusion arose with regard to the lease. The earl, who was then confined in the Tower, appears to have granted the mill to William Wycliffe, without informing his agents, who in the meantime had renewed Dackam's lease. Dackam, writing to the earl on the 20th Nov., 1607, says : Mr William Wycliffe by some graunte, as he pretended, from your honour, hath latelie forciblie putt me oute of the possession of the saide mylne, and . . . doth still detaine the same from me, contrarie to lawe, and receyved my rent due to me, ever synce Lammas last, was twelve monthes, which is extreame deallinge in hym, whom I did accompte of as my verie deare frende.

Stockdale, another of the earl's agents, writing on the 13th Dec. in the same year, attempts to dissuade him from this course. He writes to Wycliffe : Sr, I receaved your letter the laste weeke, at x of the clock at night, and am sorry to heare their should be any suite betweene you and Thomas Dackham. His lease of Houghton millne was graunted to him in the yeare 1585 by his lordship himself, and the enrollment thereof I tooke, and finding the rente reserved upon the same to be litle or lesse then the ould auncient rente, he was advised to renewe the same, and to my remembrance obtayned a warrant or letter to his lordship's commissioner, who demised the same to him accordingly with the moulter mault, to which demise Sir William Fenwick, \u2022 Duke of Northumberland's MSS. 2Ibid. 3Ibid.

And Thomas Dackham also, being an ould servitor to his lordship, and to his father as you knowe, I would pray you to suffer him, according to the meaning ofhis graunte, to have and enjoy his terme, which is not longe, for the courte at Yorke will construe the woorste of our behavior in his case. ' Soon afterwards Wycliffe was in possession of the mill, which did not, however, realise his expectations. Writing on the 31st Oct., 1610, he reminds the earl that he had received a lease ofthe mill 'towards the reparr ing of my losse and payments in Scotland.' The lease had formerly yielded him a year, but this sum, 'sence I have been estranged from that countrie, ys both slowly and unthankfullie paid, to my trowble and sore charges,' he therefore asks the earl to cancel his lease.2 The mill was accordingly transferred to other lessees.3 The customary services due to Long Houghton mill were a frequent source of friction between the miller and the tenants.4 In addition to this the miller of Long Houghton was exposed to the rivalry of his neighbour, the lessee of the adjoining mill which served the tenants of Lesbury. In 1658 Mrs. Lewen was the tenant of Long Houghton mill. Her son in-law, Nicholas Whitehead, writes to one of the earl's officers, on the 21st July, 1658, as follows : Sir, I must not only become your humble sewter myselfe, but also presents you with my mother's, who earnestly desires you will be pleasd not to further Mr Carr to have any hand [or] interest in Lesbury millne, for, if you should, he will make Longhoughton millne worth nothing to my lord nor to hir; now she, having bestowed great charges in makeing the said millne anew & building hir with stone and lyme, which will save wood hereafter; for he hath always bene a very bad troublesome nighbor to hir, and has indeavored to putt both strangers & others from my lord's millne of Houghton, by his threatninges to impound their horses if they come out of the millne dore upon his ground, and its lykly he will now be much wors & threaten common peoplle, when it may bring benefitt to himselfe in constrayning peoplle if possable from Houghton millne to Lesbury millne. And allredy, as few days as he has injoyed the millne, he has threatened the millnar of Houghton millne and others of Houghton for coming through his ground, althoe it be the ordinarye & accustomed way to Houghton millne, etc. She [Mrs Lewan] will be content with any partner you shall apoyntt except Mr Carr, for his caridg is so hye and boysterous that he is thought nether fitt partnor nor tennant. 5 1 Duke of Northumberland's MSS. 2 Ibid. 3 George Whitehead writes to the earl, 6th Feb., 1612 : ' I have made stay in Robert Clarkes handes and Raphe Frissell's, the tennants of the moulter maulte and Houghton Milne, soome twenty ode pounde. ... My servantes ar much troobled by a busye fellowe, one Nathaniell Orde, deputy to Sir William Selby, but I cannot say that it is Sir William Selbye's faulte, but rather excuse him bycause of late I have ever found him very observing of your lordship.

In addition to the farms there were several small cottar holdings. Looking at this terrier as a whole it will be observed that the primitive system of land tenure had survived the division of the township into two parts. The effect of the change which took place in the sixteenth century was to confine the land of each tenant, which had previously been scattered throughout the whole township, to a more limited area, but within the new limits the size of each tenant's holding was unchanged, and the land con tinued subdivided in innumerable strips, as it had been from time immemorial. The inconvenience of this system of agriculture became evident to the tenants by the experience of daily life, but it was only partially removed by the partition. The difficulties attending the partition were great, as it was necessary to calculate the exact size of a large number of strips, and to allot to each tenant strips of corresponding size and quality in other parts of the township. It is therefore surprising that the tenants did not make a more radical change, and, after calculating the total area of every man's strips,"], [436, "384 LONG HOUGHTON PARISH. assign to each his land in severalty. The only obstacle to such a change appears to have been the difficulty of making the necessary calculations, but this difficulty had been removed, to some extent at least, by the compilation of a highly complex and elaborate terrier. The causes, which prevented this change from taking place immediately, are scarcely intelligible to us, but the fact that it did not take place remains as a remarkable testimony to the effect of custom upon human action.1 The terrier illustrates the system of land tenure prevailing at Long Houghton in 1614, but it does not give any information as to the conditions upon which the tenants held their lands. In 1567 it appears, from the survey previously cited, that the tenants held their lands by the payment of small customary rents and fines. This system had continued almost unaltered until a few years before the terrier of 16 14 was compiled. A gradual change was then in progress, but the tenants still enjoyed great latitude in buying or selling or sub-letting their farms amongst one another. A curious instance of this is furnished by an undated petition of William Taylor of Long Houghton to Hugh Potter, the earl's commissioner, which describes with much obscurity the purchase of half a farm by Henry Reade from Robert Clerke.2 It appears from a letter, written by Robert Delaval to the earl of North umberland, 8th June, 16 10, that the old customary rents were at this time undergoing a great change. The concluding part of Delaval's letter throws an interesting light on Northumbrian horse breeding in the seventeenth century. Delaval writes : William Bowden of Longhoughton, I advartysed your honour by my last letter but one (for whom I writ to your lordship for a lease), that he had a sonn, but I was mystaken. There is too youthes about his house, and hath bene ever since there invancye brought upp by him, and they are both his brother's sonns. The man is some 50 yeares old and verye hcalthfull and as lykely as other wyse to wearr out a good many ofthe yeares ofa lease of his tenement. I formerely acquanted your lordship that he desired a lease for xxitie yeares at duble his ould rent, it is xxxs per annum, the [rent] he paid your honour afour but eight yeare agoe for his coppye hould estate ; if [it] please your honour to send him, with the old tennent of Rennington, a lease at duble his rent, the poore man wilbe verye glade thereof, and, if it maye please your honour, I would not have anye denyed a lease uppon the like condyssyons that be coppye houlders, that arr so likelye to leve as he is, and hath paid a fyne so latelye. I have seane a very fyne paseinge maire thats blacke and of a myddle syse, which I can buy for your lordship, and hath so good a forhand and heed, as I knowe not where the like is to be had in these parts. The puppe that Sir John Fenwicke 1 A number of other questions are suggested by this and similar surveys, which must be reserved for discussion in another part of the work. One point which requires explanation will be noticed in the schedules of strips. For instance, in Bastie lands, George Bowdon holds 3 'lands.' Why is the numeral 3 retained? 2 Duke of Northumberland's MSS."], [437, "385 LONG HOUGHTON. gave the kinge, that was the sweftest horse held to be [in] Ingland, which was geven to the duck of Hulster, is full brother by the horse to thise maire.1 She hath this year, thats some five weakes ould, a verye fayre horse coult, thats gotten with a horse that paseth of Sir Raiphe Graye's, that wyll not be sould for a hundreth pound, and the gent that owes her wyll not sell his mayre and coult under xx\", and, if I dislike the coult, he wyll abait me xx\"e nobles of the xxu. The maire is this yeare covered againe with a marvellus fayre graye Turke that paseth a lytle, but verye excellent good shapp. The onely salt that I fynd in the maire is her adge, for she is this yeare eather a xj or xij yeares ould, which makes me onely forbeare to buy her tyll I heare from your lordship. If your lordship wyll have me buy her, I shall have both maire and foole well keept heare tyll the next springe, and then the maire maye be sent upp, and the foole left heare, where, if it maye please your lordship, I desire verye much to breed him a horse for your lordship tyll he be thre yeare ould, befor he be sent upp.2 Another letter written by Robert Delaval to the earl, 17th April, 161 1, also illustrates the increase of the old customary rents. He writes : I have delyvered, to be geven your honour by Mr Fotherley, t te retorne ofthe last warrants touchinge the compoundinge with your tenents that oweth fynes for takeinge leases at treble the old rent, which was executed togeather with the warrant for compoundinge with George Salkeyld for his tenement in Hull parke. . . . The hopes the tennents hath nowe geven them in that your honour wyll raett [sic] there fynes, makes most of them all unwyllinge to take leases, so as I feare they will rather wyllinglye paye a fyne that maye happalye make them beggers all ther lifes, then geve treble rent for a lease. I received from your honour a warrant of laett to seese a tenement in Longhoughton late Ephraim Forster, and nowe in one William Hearon occupatyon, which Hearon oweth his fyne. I desire your honour wyl be pleased to send me a lease for Hearon, who humbly intreats it may be mayd in Thomas Tomson's name,3 a freind of his, under the rent of iij1' xs per annum. And the old rent of it was 308 per annum.

The whole course of events during this period evidently tended graduallv to the consolidation of the small farms in the hands of a few large holders. Edward Adams mentioned by William Locke, one of the earl's agents, in a letter written in 1696, was a farmer of this class. William Locke's letter is as follows : Alnwicke castle, June the 5th, 1696. M' Thornton, I received yours of the 28th May from York, and inclosed you will receive an account of the mulcture corne & miln rent for the yeare (95), I know not how we came to omitt it. I have not as yeat received the money for 20 Wooller bowles of it, which I sold to a carryer for 10s 6d per bowle. But indeed he would have paid me, but I refused his money. There is some small arrears besides which I must answer. I could not at first rightly understand how much every one paid, but now I am perfect in the account. I perceive that Lady day rent (95) for Longhoughton milne must be answered in with the mulcture corne, due for that yeare, being at St. Peter day following, which should have been accounted 1 The word 'maire' is written over the word 'puppe,' which is struck through. 2Duke of Northumberland's MSS.

I sinde there is a great deale of trouble in collecting the mulcture corne and the price uncertain, and I'le assure you I have found some losse in the measuring it out againe. I know not what George C allways answered for it, but he swears to me that he lost considerably by it : io\u00bb and 6'1 per bowle is a great price of what it used to be, and 9a per bowle for oates is a third parte more then the usuall price. There is not halfe the sucken to the milne that was formerly when the rent was but \u00a3S 6\" 8J, the towne being soe much depopulated. Edward Adames hath 12 farmes & severall cottages in his hand, in which farmes were formerly 12 severall familyes, and there is but 27 farmes in the towne. If you looke upon the account you'l give a guess who alsoe lives not upon their farmes, soe consequently the mulcture to the milne must abate, and when the present millers turne is out of Lesbury milne, who has now both the mills, if they are not letten again bothe together the rent must of nescessity abate. If his grace would be pleased to bestowe this lease on me it would be a great helpe to me. I sinde M' Clarke tooke it away from my father Whitehead, however I cannot claime a right to it. I can only say it would ease me ofa great deale of trouble both in the collecting & in my accounts, and be a profitt too, therefore, if you think fitt, speake a good word for me. We have sad rainey weather here, which putts a stop to our carrying on the worke of the dams at Warkworth. We have not ycat gott home the timber. WiUiam Milbourne tells me there has been above 350 salmon taken sence the audett, now there is a great flood in the river. I am afraid this will not prove a good yeare for the finishing the dams. When our worke goes effectually forward I'le give you an account. In the mean time, give me leave to tell you, we are putt hard to it to provide money to pay the workmen, that is passable. Our tennants are in daily expectation to be advised what to doe with their money, & soe am I too. You have pretty well dreand this countrey of the broad passable silver. If any money be dipt, its taken hereby weight only. Pray give me advise, as soon as you can, what I shall doe; if nothing but broad unclipt silver will pass, I shall make a great many hollydays, for it will be in vaine for me to seek that which is impossible to be found. I suppose you will have a relation of the keell bullyes and the colliers at Newcastle. They have putt a stop to the bringing coales down the river, and take provisions in the markett without money and without price.

I have nothing els at present save my humble service to Mr Beach and Mr Coles, & accept the same yourselfe from your humble servant, W\"' Locke.1 It will be seen that the change, which had been in progress at Long Houghton, had produced the partial depopulation of the village. Edward Adams had obtained possession of twelve of the twenty-seven farms, in addition to several cottages, and many of the tenants of the other farms were not resident in the township. During the same period another change was in progress which also greatly altered the aspect of the township, namely, the enclosure of the commons. The map of 1619 shows that about half the township consisted at that time of unenclosed common. A curious dispute took place about the year 1613 between the small farmers and cottagers of the township, helped by some ofthe inhabitants of Alnmouth, and 'George Whitehead, gentleman, of Warkworth,' who had enclosed some part of the common by virtue of a 1 Duke of Northumberland's MSS.

Different portions were enclosed by agreement of the few persons interested at various times. Some portions were enclosed in 1674, and other portions in 1726 and r807.3 The amalgamation of the farms and the decrease of population tended also to extinguish the old services, which were nevertheless maintained to some extent until a comparatively recent date. In 1676 it was stated that the tenants of Long Houghton still paid i6d. a year cornage rent, and that every farm there carried in yearly, for the use of AInwick castle, ten bolls of coals and a horse-load of straw for the stables, with seventeen pecks of barley.4 Edward Adams, son of Robert Adams, then bailiff of Long Houghton, has already been referred to as the tenant of twelve farms in 1696. At that time the greater part of the township was the property of the lord of the manor, but, in the course of the eighteenth and present cen turies, the few parcels of land which remained in the possession of small free holders have passed by purchase into the hands of the duke of Northumber- 11 Agreement between the fermers and cottagers of Longhoghton in county of Northumberland for defending their right of common.'

The pedigree shows how tenaciously families of this class adhered to their place of birth.

The church of Long Houghton before the Dissolution of the monasteries was a chapelry subordinate to the mother-church of Lesbury. Between the years 1143 and 1152, Eustace Fitz John, lord ofthe barony of AInwick, gave the chapelry of Long Houghton to the canons of AInwick abbey, with all the tithes of his demesne of Houghton;1 and it remained in the possession of that religious house until the Dissolution. There is no documentary evidence to show at what date the chapel was built, neither is there any evidence of an early dedication. In later times, however, it is spoken of as that of St. Peter.2 After the Dissolution the chapelry of Long Houghton was constituted an independent parish, as is stated in the survey of the manor of Long Houghton made about the year 1567. The writer of the survey, after incidentally remarking that the church and steeple were the only places of strength that the parishioners could withdraw to in time of war,3 proceeds as follows : In the same towne of Great Howghton is nowe one parishe churche, which before was chapell dependent to the churche of Lesburye, the same erection was at the dissolution ofthe monasterye of AInwick maide by Willm.

Before the Dissolu tion, one of the canons of AInwick abbey had been always resident at Long Houghton to perform the duties ofa parish priest. The advowson was after wards given to the earl of Northumberland.0 Some account of the later history of the benefice will be found in the following biographies of the vicars. 1 Dodsworth MSS. vol. 49, fol. 11. 2 Arch.

Some facts concerning his life are narrated in the proceedings of the Court of High Commission at Durham. In 1635 he was charged by his principal parishioners at the court with drunkenness. It was stated that, when he should have been reading prayers, he was occupied in making shirts out of the surplices. It was alleged that he was ' no preacher,' he had never been heard preaching, neither had he procured any preacher for the space of seven years. The parishioners had been forced to engage M* Stephenson, curate of AInwick, as preacher, and to remunerate him for his services. Moreover Burletson had proclaimed the banns of marriage between himself and different women on two successive Sundays. He was suspended for three years, and was ordered to make a public submission in the parish church in his ordinary apparel.7 1640, Feb. 3rd. Henry Lever, B.A., presented on the death of Burletson. He was son of Sampson Lever of Brancepeth and Scuteshouse, and grandson of Thomas Lever, master of Sherburn house, Dur ham, preacher to Edward VI., and prebendary of Durham. Henry Lever was baptised at St. Oswald's, Durham, 18th Jan., 1606, and became master of AInwick grammar school and monthly preacher there. In 1644 he was appointed rector of Brancepeth as successor to Dr Cosin, and was one of the first visitors appointed by Cromwell to inspect his new college at Durham.

He then removed to Shincliffe, to the house ofhis late wife's son, where he remained till 1665, when he returned to Newcastle and married again. ' I cannot learn,' says Calamy, ' that he had any settled congregation there after his ejection.' Brand states that about this period he was minister at Kirkby Lonsdale. In 1669 he was accused of preaching al conventicles in Newcastle, and in 1672, after the declaration of indulgence, he 'had a call' from the people of Darlington.

Charles Chambers presented, 'per spontaneam resignationem magistri Kidd.'3 The presentation may have been antedated, as the following petition, which refers to the vacancy of the benefice, was drawn up on 12 Dec., 1649, by John Roddam, William Burrell, George Burrell, and other parishioners : The humble petition of the parishioners of Long Houghton. To the Right Honorable Algernowne, earle of Northumberland. Humbly sheweth your honour's humble petitioners, being your lordshipp's tenants in the parish of Longe Houghton, among many miseryes in these sad tymes, have now for a long tyme lyen under one as sad as any can be, the want of a carefull and constant vicar.

Archdeacon Thorp directed that the church should be repaired, and the south wall of the chancel was taken down and rebuilt.

He also officiates as sexton, and has 6'1 for digging a grave.' Another ' tarrer of the vicarage of Longhoughton,' undated, records that the vicarage consisted of ' one hall house, one pariar, a ketchen, two chambers above a barne with little garth beside the barne to the west.' Among the vicar's perquisites was 6a 8d ' for every small line coble at Easter, for every hooking coble, five groats.' ' The value of the benefice is now \u00a3252, derived from tithe rent charge.

Cuthbert Chessman, who died nth Aug., 1729, bequeathed out ofhis quarter part ofhis tithes of Long Houghton, \u00a33 yearly, for the poor of Long Houghton town, to be paid at Christmas and Whitsuntide. The amount is distributed by the minister and churchwardens on Whitsunday yearly, to about 20 poor persons, in various small sums. Stanton Neale, by his will, proved at Durham, 4th April, 1814, gave to the vicar and churchwardens of Long Houghton an annuity of \u00a310, payable out ofhis fourth part of the tithes of corn and grain of the parish, to be paid the day before Christmas, yearly, to the poor of the township of Long Houghton on Christmas day. As the village is approached from the railway station the church forms a striking feature in the scene. Backed and partly hidden by trees, with its massive tower, presenting much of the appearance of a place of defence, for which purpose, indeed, we know it was used in days now long gone by, it dominates the neighbouring houses and gives an air of importance to the town. Nothing has been discovered during the ' restoration ' of the church, or at any other time, which shows that a church and cemetery, with its accompanying memorial crosses occupied the site, but there are indications 1 Duke of Northumberland's MSS."], [448, "396 LONG HOUGHTON PARISH. in the building itself, which tend to show that before the Norman conquest a church existed here. This appears to have consisted of a nave and chancel only. Of this early building nothing remains except the east wall of the nave with the chancel arch, the lower portion of the north wall, and the north-east angle of the nave as high as the eaves of the present roof. The plaster hides the nature of the walling internally, but the outside of the old north wall shows that it is built of irregularly coursed rubble, some large stones being used, and in its general character it is similar to that of the walls of pr\u00e6-Conquest churches generally. The lower parts of the jambs of the north door still remain, but the arch is all gone. They are certainly a later insertion in the old wall, and have a plain narrow chamfer on the angles. The chancel arch is quite plain, with square soffit and jambs. It has an impost moulding of slight projection, chamfered beneath, and this is carried along the east wall as a string-course. There is nothing in these details to show that it was built either before or after the Conquest, but it must have been erected within a very few years of that event. It differs entirely from, and\" is certainly earlier than, the tower arch, which can scarcely be later than the closing years of the eleventh century, by which time the country had begun to recover from the devastation inflicted in 1069 on Northumberland by King William, after the murder of his lieutenant, Earl Robert Cumin. At a time when the whole land was lying waste, and to some extent depopulated, by the terrible revenge which the king took for the rebellion against his authority, it was not likely, indeed it was impossible, that any church building could go on ; and when the condition of things had so far improved that men began again to resume their ordinary life and work, a new style of architecture had developed, from which the chancel arch of Long Houghton is widely separated in its general form and details. It seems, therefore, on the whole more probable that the first church, of which there are any remains, was built before the Conquest than after, though that opinion cannot be entertained with certainty. The first addition to the church was the tower, which appears to have been added a little before the close of the eleventh century. The stone used in this part, to which its use is confined, is of a red colour, and corresponds with that of which the Norman church at Lindisfarne is built, and indeed it is not impossible that the same men who worked upon Lindisfarne priory may also have been employed at Long Houghton. The"], [449, "INTERIOR OF LONG HOUGHTON CHURCH. J.P OtBSON PHOTO."], [450, ""], [451, "LONG HOUGHTON CHURCH. 397 tower opens into the nave by an arch of more than ordinary beauty and rich ness. It is interesting to observe that it is identical in section, except that its dimensions are less, with two of the three orders of the eastern tower arch of Durham cathedral, part of the work of William of St. Carilef, which cannot be later than 1096. The difference between the elaboration of the arch as compared with the jambs is curious, but there is no reason to suppose that both are not of the same date. The arch is of two orders, the outer one on the east face has a hollow and roll moulding and a plain soffit. The inner order consists of two deep hollows and a semi-circular roll. The outer order on the west face is unmoulded. There are no capitals, but a projecting impost, chamfered beneath, is carried over the square pilasters in the jambs. The west and south windows in the lower and earlier stage of the tower, the walls of which are 4 feet 3 inches thick, are original, though the west one has been partly reconstructed ; the north one is modern. An interesting feature in the tower is the presence, here and there, of a thin coat of gesso, with which the interior of the lower stage was covered. The upper, belfry, stage was added probably in the thirteenth century, but there is not enough of detail left to enable a precise date to be given. The windows are modern, and do not correspond in any way with those that must originally have been there ; in their design they belong to a time before that of the building of the belfry. At the west end of the south side, and at the north end of the west side, a massive buttress has been added in the fifteenth century to counteract the shrinking of the tower, which, however, is still going on. On the east face of the tower the line of the original nave roof is visible, and another grooved line represents a later roof which covered in one span the nave and aisle. The aisle, which is on the south side of the nave, is of the Early English period, and dates from about 1190. The arcade is of three bays, with cham fered arches of two orders, and a chamfered hood moulding towards the nave. The columns are octagonal, with plain moulded capitals and bases, the latter resting on square plinths. The east and west ends spring from corbels, which in their form follow the line of the inner order ofthe arches. The only old window is that at the east end ofthe aisle. This was originally a lancet, of which the head still remains visible on the exterior of the wall. It had a semi-circular inner arch. The jambs have been cut away, below the spring of the arch, to widen the splay, when the two-light traceried"], [452, "398 LONG HOUGHTON PARISH. window of the fourteenth century was inserted. The head of this window is cut out of one stone, and is somewhat similar to one still remaining in the ruined church at Jesmond. A heavy buttress of four stages was built at the south-east corner, probably when the later window was put in. There is a plain square squint on the south side of the chancel arch. The chancel is entirely modern though built of the stones from the ancient one. At the east end of the modern south wall two small arches are built in internally, one plain pointed, the other trefoil-headed. They may be the heads of piscinas. The font is an old one though not of an early date. It has been re chiselled and stands on a new shaft. In the vestry is preserved a Norman capital, probably belong ing to the south door of the nave, and contem porary with the tower arch ; and in the east wall of the chancel, on the out side, is built in a single arch stone, with a rich zig zag moulding, which also probably belonged to the same doorway. Window at the east end of the aisle. In the tower is preserved a shouldered stone coffin ; that of a young child, found with its lid, which is 2 feet 6 inches long, and has a plain cross of the saltire form upon it. A small grave cover with the shears, belonging to a young girl, is built into the east wall of the chancel, near to the piece of"], [453, "BOULMER AND SEATON. 399 zigzag moulding already mentioned. In the churchyard, to the south-east of the church, is a cross, which may possibly be part of the shaft and head of the old churchyard one. The head has three fleur-de-lys terminations, which are now cut down. A similar one still remains at Blanchland with the head complete. BOULMER AND SEATON. Boulmer, with Seaton, is a township consisting of two separate parcels of land, lying to the south of the promontory known as Long Houghton Steel.1 The small fishing village of Boulmer is very picturesquely situated near a natural haven, which, being a bow-shaped mere or inlet, may not improbably be the source from which the name of the hamlet is derived. The popula tion, which is wholly engaged in fishing, has increased since the construction of the main line of the North Eastern railway, which provides the means requisite for the prompt despatch to distant markets of the perishable produce of the place. It has been remarked that the natives of Northumberland are, on the whole, of very pure Anglian descent, but it is believed that the fishing folk of Boulmer and other places on the coast come of a Scandinavian stock. However this may be, it is certain that in size and weight the men of Boulmer compare favourably with those of other parts of England. The fact that it has not been their habit to intermix much or to intermarry with the agricultural inhabitants of neighbouring townships may have tended to develop the differences in speech and physique which now characterise them.2 During the last century their forefathers carried on a flourishing local industry by the manufacture of kelp, of which they made about 118 tons a year. The ashes of the kelp were very valuable, being sold for as much as \u00a3$ a ton, whilst the expense of manufacture was not more than fifteen shillings a ton. The proceeds of this industry were largely supple mented from less legitimate sources. Many stories of the old Boulmer smugglers are narrated in Wilson's Tales of the Borders. Seaton, the other parcel of land of which the township is composed, lies to the south of Boulmer. It was formerly divided into two parts, known as 1 Boulmer contains 246 acres, and Seaton contains 148 acres. Census Returns : 1801, 1 10 ; 181 1, 102 ; 1821,104; 1831,140; 1841,153; 1851,149; 1861,156; 1871,244; 1881,222; 1891,186. \" There is a local proverb, ' Better to wed over the midden than over the moor.' Out of 32 families, twelve bear the name Stephenson, and eight bear the name Stanton,"], [454, "400 LONG HOUGHTON PARISH. Easter Seaton and Wester Seaton, both of which appear to have belonged at one time to the manor of Alnmouth.1 The history of Boulmer in early times is identical with that of Long Houghton, the whole of the land in the township having originally constituted a part of the demesne of that manor. It was at a later date divided into four tenement holdings, which were afterwards amalgamated, and granted as a single holding to one large tenant farmer. As a part of the demesne Boulmer and Seaton were under the direct control ofthe lords ofthe barony of AInwick, and in 1279 the township was assigned to Isabella, wife of John de Vescy, as her dower. The name of Isabella de Vescy for this reason stands at the head of the Subsidy Roll of the township, compiled in 1296. For the assessment of this tax Boulmer was amalgamated with Denwick. The origin of family names is illustrated by some which occur upon the list, e.g., Robert 'at the town end,' Arnald 'at the hill,' Robert 'at the red side,' etc. The roll is as follows : BULMER DENEWIK'. \u00a3 s. d. s. d.

When Boulmer re-appears as a separate estate, in the sixteenth century, it is described as a messuage, formerly consisting of four tenements, having attached to it an estate of seven score acres of arable and meadow, as was 1 ' Notes whereby Boulmer is within the mannor of Longhoughton, and Seaton proves to be within the mannor of Alemouth.' Duke of Northumberland's MSS,"], [455, "BOULMER AND SEATON. 401 recorded in the ancient rolls.1 In 1559 this estate was in the hands of John Carr, as lessee,2 who died about the year 1567. In the survey of the manor of Long Houghton, which was made at that time, it is stated that, John Carre of Bowlmer, laite deceassed, hade, by the dimission of the said laite admissiones, iiij\"r cottinges in Howghton aforesaid, as is befor mentioned ; wherein dwelleth tenants by his appoyntment, agaynst the antient order of his lordship's courte and dimission of inheritance.

On 23rd Dec., 1565, a ship was wrecked upon the Hullie Carrs (now known as Bally Carr) off Seaton Point. Amongst other things, which the vessel contained, was a chest full of gold, which was being conveyed to Mary, queen of Scots.

In an undated petition, which may be assigned to the year 1591 or thereabouts, he states that he was with the earl at his 'enstalement at his own chardges, which cost him xxx11,' and was 'at the chardges of himselfe and three other persons by the space of xvj daies in London, to the some of xxxiij1'.' In con clusion he asks the earl that he may be admitted as 'tenant of the living which he now hath.'1 In 1602 he addressed another petition to the earl of similar purport, in which he complained bitterly of the spite entertained against him by Thomas Percy, the constable of AInwick castle. He appears to have obtained the lease which he desired, but he continued to incur the enmity of the earl's officers. In 1607 William Orde, one of these officers, was directed by the earl to make a survey of Boulmer and Seaton. Writing from Prudhoe, on 14th Sept., 1607, to the earl, then in the Tower, Orde reported as follows: It may please your lordship, that your honour may more securely and tymously resolve, I have taken the best viewe of Bowmer and Seaton I could ; which I esteeme of that woorth, as your lordship will gett xxx11 yearely for the same, and a tennaunt honestly live withall ; if so be he may be quitt of Carr the now leasor, who by his braggin speaches would seeme to terrifie any, either for bidding for it, or taking it of your lordship. And of this, as ofthe greatest impediment to your busines, a speciall care must be had, that your officers may honestly concurr, least the conteynance, or connivence of one may cause a greater imputation be laid on the rest.2 In the following year Carr's lease expired, and George Whitehead, one of the earl's officers, was put in his place. He did not, however, live peace fully at Boulmer during the early years of his tenancy. Writing on 16th July, 1608, he says, 'for Bolmer and Seaton, Carre and all his frendes ar in armes against me with many a bragge, his lease beinge alredy expired. I houlde he deserves no favour.'3 The sentiments entertained by Whitehead with regard to Carr were reciprocated with equal warmth by the latter, who, in 16 13, placed himself at the head of a party of armed men gathered together to resist certain enclosures made by Whitehead, which were considered to be encroachments on public rights.4 Thomas Carr appears to have died about four years afterwards.5 George Whitehead, the new tenant of Boulmer, belonged to a family 1 Duke of Northumberland's MSS. 2 Ibid.

In 'a true particular ofthe estate of George Whitehead of Bullmer' it is stated that, in addition to his leasehold at Boulmer, he held half a farm on lease in right of his wife, and was entitled to 'one half of 1511 in moneys payable to him and Mrs. Barbary Errington, at the surrender of the lease to John Errington.'1 The descendants of George Whitehead remained at Boul mer until the eighteenth century. The farm, which has been let to various persons in recent years, is still the property of the duke of Northumberland. LITTLE HOUGHTON. The township of Little Houghton, occupying the north-western corner of the parish of Long Houghton, is bounded by Howick on the east, and Rennington on the west.2 In the centre of the township is situated Little Houghton tower, which was for many centuries one of the residences of the Roddam family. The nucleus or core of the house is a small medi\u00e6val 1 Royalist Composition Papers, Second Series, vol. liv. No. 863. 2 The township contains 823 acres.

The medi\u00e6val portion of the building was partially demolished in 18 18, but it is stated by a person, who visited the place before the alterations, that the tower was about 25 feet square, with walls 5 feet thick. The lower storey was vaulted, and there was a newel stair in one of the corners ; the door was massive, and the wards of the key used in open ing it were 4 inches square.1 Sufficient is fortunately left of the ancient masonry to show that this description is in its general features correct. The original entrance to the tower appears to have been a square-headed door, now blocked up, upon the west side. At a later date a round-headed door was broken through the massive wall at the west end of the north side, to communicate with the present kitchen. The original entrance was then built up, and entrances to the lobby, separating the tower from the extension to the north, were formed on the east and west sides. Both these entrances were probably made in the seventeenth century, and their date may be approxi mately fixed by an inscription upon a plain but handsome fire-place in a bed room on the upper floor. It bears the letters E. R. M. and the date 1686. These letters are the initials of Edward Roddam and his wife Mary Sangwill, who were married on 24th July, 1674. A very large fire-place of the same date, 10 feet 4 inches wide by 4 feet 8 inches high, still remains in the room upon the ground floor now used as a study. The tower, owing perhaps to its small size, is omitted in the early lists of similar buildings, and has generally escaped observation at a later date. It is, however, referred to by Mark in his survey of Northumberland made in 1734, who states that the building was 'remarkable as a strong tower of great antiquity.'2 The first recorded owner of the township of Little Houghton is Gilbert de St. Clare, probably a Norman knight. Nothing is known of his parentage or place of birth, but an early transcript of a deed drawn up in his name is preserved amongst the duke of Northumberland's muniments. By this deed, which is addressed to all men, French and English, Gilbert de St. Clare gave to Magister Liulph, for his homage and service, a bovate of land in Little Houghton, consisting of twelve acres. The twelve acres were composed of various small parcels of land, namely, a toft and croft consisting of an acre (which had been in the tenure of Liulph), one acre at the garden, three roods which had also been in Liulph's tenure, half an acre at 'Belhc,' four acres in 1 Tate MSS. 2 Inedited Contributions to the History of Northumberland, Hodgson-Hinde, p. 68."], [460, "406 LONG HOUGHTON PARISH. Water- rig, two acres in 'Svelhc,' one acre and three roods of demesne land, and one acre of meadow at Stanibrigg. Gilbert de St. Clare at the same time gave to Liulph pasture for one hundred sheep in the vill of Houghton, and freedom from multure. The deed of gift may be assigned to the later part of the twelfth century.1 The estate of Little Houghton became afterwards the property of Peter Harang, who is styled son of Gilbert de St. Clare.2 Peter Harang married Margery, daughter and heiress of German Rybaud, by whom he had a son, John Harang. The latter is mentioned in the Testa de Nevill as holding Little Houghton of the barony of AInwick for one knight's fee.3 After the death of John Harang the township appears to have passed, through his son Robert, to Peter Harang, probably his grandson. In the year 1289 Peter Harang is recorded as the owner of Little Houghton, which was of the yearly value of His name does not, however, appear on the Subsidy Roll of 1296 Parua Hotton. \u00a3 s. d. s. d.

It was stipulated that Percy should provide for William de Roddam the same apparel which he gave to his other yeomen, in addition to hay, oats, nails and horse-shoes for six horses, waggons for six grooms, and compensation for horses lost in war.1 John de Roddam, the heir to the estate, was one of the two persons who paid subsidy at Little Houghton in 1336.2 The history of the family to which he belonged will be more appropriately dealt with in the history of Roddam, and it must for the present suffice to trace very briefly its connection with Little Houghton during the succeeding centuries. In the middle of the fourteenth centurv William de Roddam3 was the owner of the township, which in 1427 had passed into the possession of his descendants, Nicholas and Robert Roddam.4 In the sixteenth century members of the same family were still residing in the place. The name of William Roddam occurs in the list of men dwelling at Little Houghton in 1538,5 and Robert Roddam is recorded as the owner of Little Houghton in 1569.6 The management ofhis estates fell into the hands of his wife, whose conduct was unsatisfactory to the tenants. One of these, named John Aneill, complained that she had turned him out of his house, and had replaced him by a Scotsman. He stated his case as follows : To the right wo' M.

Robert Roddam, the husband of the lady mentioned in this petition, is referred to as a freeholder in Little Houghton in the surveys of the Percy estates compiled at this period. From these surveys it appears that he was not the owner of the whole of the township, some part of which was held by customary tenants of the earl of Northumberland by copy of the court roll of the manor of Long Houghton.2 At the beginning of the seventeenth century Edmund Roddam was pro prietor of Little Houghton. He died in 1631,3 leaving amongst other issue by his wife Margaret, daughter of Sir Ralph Grey, a son John. The latter by his will, dated 19th April, 1658, bequeathed all his lands in Little Houghton to his eldest son, also named John, whom he directed to pay an annuity of to his second son Edward, at the same time expressing his wish that 'hee [Edward] bee kept at Barwicke schoole, and if his genius lead him to bee a scollar, hee be made one.' He bequeathed also to his eldest daughter and a house in Bishopsgate Street, London.4 Edward Roddam, the second son of John Roddam who succeeded under this will, resided at Little Houghton at the close of the seventeenth century. 1 Border Papers, No. 435. 2 One of these tenants was Hugh Selby, whose will, dated 16th April, 1588, was proved the same year.

Brumell At the northern end of Little Houghton is situated the farm of Little Mill, which, in 1710, was computed as one-fifth ofthe township. In 1713 the farm was conveyed by the Roddams to Hannah Barron of Stamford for The latter on 21st Oct., 1727, transferred it to George Davison, her eldest son by her first husband. George Davison's son, Nathaniel Davison of AIn wick, some time consul at Nice, was a friend of Sir Henry Taylor, who makes reference to him when he writes : My father had a friend (a relative, I believe, though a distant one) of the name of Davison, much older than himself, an accomplished man, who had travelled in the East, had been British consul at Nice,"], [465, "LITTLE HOUGHTON. 411 had come home, married, and died, leaving a widow with the remains of great beauty, and four daughters, one of whom was brilliantly pretty, and all of whom were attractive (in one way or another and more or less) from simplicity and gracefulness of manner, brightness, singleness, and saliency of character, softness, and an uncultivated refinement. I can barely recollect the father. Probably I should not have recollected him at all but for his pigtail, one ofthe last survivors, I suppose, ofthe latest generation of pigtails.1 Nathaniel Davison sold Little Mill to Lord Grey.

LESBURY TOWNSHIP. The township of Lesbury, which has an area of 1,646 acres, was well described by a writer in the sixteenth century, who said that 'the towne of Lesburye ys scituate upon the river Alne, yt ys a very trime lordship, of grounde fertyle, yet yt ys very deare rented, havinge but very small pasture grounde perteininge therunto, for that yt ys a very goode corne soiie for all maner of graine, and that the most parte of ther land lyethe so nighe the sea that the same ys manured with sea wracke, which ys no lesse comoditye to the tenants than cause of the good corne that groweth there.' The village of Lesbury adjoins the boundary of the township of Bilton, and lies in a sheltered position in the lower portion of the valley of the Ain, which is here about three miles wide.2 The valley is bounded on either side by gently sloping banks, which in some places attain a height of 350 feet above the sea level. The proximity of the sea renders the climate so mild and genial that the crops come to maturity in the lower part of the valley at an earlier period than in other places in the county. The soil, which is still for the most part under the plough, has been rendered by improved methods of cultivation even more productive and valuable than it was when the description already cited was written.3 The township was in early times a part of the barony of AInwick, and, like Long Houghton, was not granted to any freeholder,' but was kept under 'Census Returns: 1801, 874; 1811, 858; 1821, 576; 1831, 561; 1841, 628; 1851, 750; 1861, 750 1871,814; 1881,960; 1891,943. 2 Cf. Mr. George Tate's description, Hist. Berw. Nat. Club, vii. p. 440, etc. 3 Few prehistoric remains have been found in the township. But, about 1823, a fine 'Drinking Cup' was found in a field called ' Birney-knowe,' in the township of Lesbury. It lay in a rudely-formed stone cist, which was divided into two parts. The cup is ornamented by five horizontal zones of dotted lines, the intermediate spaces being filled with upright or slightly slanting lines, which have been formed by a knotched strip of bone. The cup is 5 inches high, 4I inches wide at the top, and 2s inches wide at the bottom. It is engraved in the Catalogue of Antiquities at AInwick Castle, plate xii. (on the right hand side). Another vessel, similar in character, was found in the other compartment of the cist, and is in the museum ofthe Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle."], [470, "414 LESBURY PARISH. the direct control of the lords of the barony.1 It was occupied in the thir teenth century by a number of small copyholders, whose names are recorded on the Subsidy Roll of 1296 : LESSEBIRY.

From this list it will be seen that there were thirteen inhabitants of Lesbury who were able to contribute to a tax at the end of the thirteenth century.2 Forty years later, owing to the impoverished state of the country, less than half this number were able to make a similar payment ;3 but in 1352 the condition of the inhabitants had much improved. In that year a survey of the manor was made, from which it appears that there were 225^ acres of demesne land, worth sixpence an acre yearly, and 32 acres of pasture worth one shilling an acre. A water mill produced 13s. 46.. a year, and there were twenty bondage holdings, each consisting of 24 acres of land. Of these four were waste and uncultivated, but sixteen were each worth 13s. 46.. a year. There were also eleven cottar holdings, and some small freeholders.4 From records which will be subsequently referred to it will be found that the twenty bondage holdings or customary farms, mentioned in this survey, sur- vived at Lesbury for many centuries afterwards. 1 Testa de Nevill; Hodgson, Northd. III. i. p. 209. There was one small freeholder in the thirteenth century, viz. : William the falconer, who held half a carucate in Lesbury. Testa de Nevill; ibid. This land afterwards came into the hands of Robert the ship's carpenter, of Alnmouth, by whom it was transferred to John de Vesci. The deed of transference is attested by Ralph Fitz Roger and William de Turberuill. Duke of Northumberland's MSS. By another deed, executed in the thirteenth century, John de Vesci gave to William Scot, his ' valet,' and Christiana his wife, a toft and croft in Lesbury, which Eustacius Faber had held, for the increase of Scot's tenement in Swyneleischeles. The deed is attested by Robert de Hilton and Walter de Cambou. Ibid. 2 In 1288 the vill of Lesbury was estimated to be worth yearly ,\u00a382 14s. 3d. Inq. p.m. 17 Ed. I. No. 25.

Sir Ralph Grey died in 1443,1 and the amount which would have been due to him for the last half of that year was expended in the repair of the mill and tenants' houses at Les bury.2 Various other items of expenditure in connection with the mill are recorded on the rolls of the bailiff of the manor at the same period,3 and several payments were made to the tenants for their help in carrying the earl's baggage on the expedition to Jedburgh in 1480, which has been already referred to.* At the close ofthe fifteenth century, in the year 1498, a schedule of the freeholders in Lesbury parish was drawn up, which specifies the various parcels of freehold land, the customary rents which were paid for them, and the services due from some of the freehold tenants.

Before proceeding to examine this survey in detail it will be well to briefly summarise the subjects with which it deals. The surveyor, after describing the place and the nature of the soil, expresses his opinion that the township, although large, should not be divided into two parts.3 The system of cultivation by means of strips scattered through out the common fields, he states, was inconvenient in so large a township, and tended to impoverish the tenants. On the other hand the difficulties which hindered a division were great ; in the first place the quality of the soil varied very much ; and, secondly, if a division was made, it would be very difficult to provide each half of the town with an equally good water supply. Similar divisions had taken place elsewhere, with generally satisfactory results, and this fact probably suggested the same experiment at Lesbury. On the whole, however, it was thought better to allow things to remain as they were. After reciting the township boundaries, the surveyor then proceeds to refer to the bad condition of the houses in the village, which was partly due to the absence of any good stone quarry or clay for making mortar. If, however, the tenants could be made to render more help to one another in their building opera tions, a great improvement might be effected. It would be well if every tenant desiring to repair his house could have his materials ready at some time appointed by the manor court. All things being in readiness the tenant would then give formal notice to the reeve, whose duty it would be to see that every one rendered his proper proportion of assistance. Although there was an abundance of arable land, there was a deficiency of pasture in the township. In order to remove this inconvenience it had been 1 Duke of Northumberland's MSS. 2 See a paper by Earl Percy on 'The Ancient Farms of Northumberland,' Arch.

Moreover, in addition to the pasture set apart for the lord, the arable and meadow land of the freeholders was kept distinct from that of the copyholders. In the matter of pasture, however, the freeholders enjoyed the same rights of stint as the copyholders, in proportion to the size and value of their tenements, except those free holders who had no house or cottage in the township. These persons enjoyed no right of common. After referring to the mill and the services accustomed to be rendered to it, the surveyor mentions that the tenants of Lesbury and Hawkhill were often at variance about rights of common. It will be seen from the map of Lesbury, made in 1624, that the commons of Lesbury and Hawkhill adjoined one another. It would have been a good plan to clearly separate the com mons of the two townships. Such a course had been suggested, but could not be carried out for various reasons. In respect to the common forge the same abuses had arisen at Lesbury, which have been mentioned in the history of the township of Long Hough ton.1 In ancient times there had been a common forge provided with a suitable amount of land. The blacksmith, who occupied the tenement, had also formerly been the only person entitled to provide food for travellers, or to make any entertainment for which payment could be demanded. In this way the blacksmith's duties had been well discharged, and travellers had been provided with good hospitality. By degrees, however, every one con sidered himself at liberty to brew and bake in his own house, and to do blacksmith's work. This abuse should be corrected. In common with the neighbouring villages, Lesbury suffered from the cattle raids which prevailed at the time when the survey was compiled. In order probably to prevent the continuance of cattle stealing and thefts from houses, it was recommended that the tenants of Lesbury should make good dykes round their crofts. Some of these crofts were on the south side of the village near the river, where the soil is gravelly. For this reason the hedges did not grow so well as they would do if the ground was of clay. Another obstacle to the proper enclosure of the crofts was the fact that many of the ridges in the crofts were intermixed. An exchange might, however, be made. In any case it was necessary that the crofts should be strongly hedged. See pp. 371-2. Vol. II. 53"], [474, "418 LESBURY PARISH, The surveyor then mentions a plantation of alders, situated between Lesbury bridge and Long Houghton mill, which stood on the Ain, not far from the present railway viaduct. It was thought desirable that this planta tion should be more strictly preserved to provide timber to be used by the tenants in repairing their houses. After referring to the rent hens payable by the tenants, he then men tions William Herrison, the last abbot of AInwick, who had been a free holder in Lesbury and employed in the earl of Northumberland's service. He appears to have annexed certain lands to his tenement, and this fact was recorded in order that the circumstance might not be forgotten. Towards the end of the survey certain recommendations are made with a view to the general improvement of the condition of the tenants. The system by which cobles were maintained at Long Houghton has been already mentioned.1 In that village the demesne land had been allotted to the ten ants, and these, twenty-eight in number, had been grouped together in seven ploughe-daylles. By this means each plough-daylle had provided a crew for a coble. A similar institution had never been in use at Lesbury, which had been supplied with fish from Alnmouth. The latter place had originally been part of Lesbury, and had been specially founded, as the surveyor states, to be the seaport of the surrounding district. But the haven there had much deteriorated, and it was suggested that, by instituting ploughe-daylles at Lesbury, a new fishing hamlet might be created at a place called Grindla haven. Lastly, the surveyor mentions that the vicar of Lesbury had enjoyed from time immemorial the tithe of the multure of Lesbury and Long Hough ton mills, and he incidentally states that the church of Lesbury was the first parish church founded in that region. These preliminary remarks and the map ofthe township made in 1624 will be of assistance in reading the sur veyor's report, which is as follows : The towne of Lesburye ys scituate upon the river Alne ; yt ys a very trime Manerium de lordship, of grounde fertyle, yet yt ys very deare rented, havinge but very small Lesburye. pasture grounde perteininge therunto ; for that yt ys a very goode corne soiie for The discription all maner of graine, and that the most parte of ther land lyethe so nighe the ofthe towne. sea that the same ys manured with sea wracke, which ys no lesse comoditye to the tenants than cause of the good corne that groweth there.

In the original survey, after the recital of the boundary, there follows a list ofthe tenants upon the manor, and a schedule of the rental. The latter shows that the total rent ofthe manor was \u00a3$7 1 6s. 6|d., which was made up as follows: Demesne lands, \u00a317 is. 9d. ; twenty husbandlands, X6 8s.; the land formerly belonging to William Scott, 16s. ; twenty cottage holdings, \u00a33 8s. 4d. ; fee farm, 16s. 3X ; cotterell, 4s. ; mill, \u00a38 ; ' Hungere crofte' and 'Rose medowe,' 4s. iod.; 'Hepstrother hilles,' 3s.; an improvement, 8d. ; two selions of land, 6d. ; another improvement, is.; the common forge, is.; three selions of land near the 'hall crofte,' is. 2d. ; the brewery, ios.2 This schedule shows that the husbandlands were still estimated as twenty, being the number of bondage holdings on the manor in the year 1352.3 These husbandlands or farms contained on an average 31^ acres of arable land, 3 acres of meadow, and 4 acres of pasture. The normal rent of a farm was about 40s. a year, and the fine on a farm appears to have been generally about \u00a3b at the time of the survey. With three exceptions the farms were copyhold.1 At the beginning of the survey it will be observed that the tenants are described as holding their land 'lyeinge rigge by rigge, and not in flatts nor yet in parcells of grounde by yt seise.' The latter mode of tenure appears to have been considered more convenient, but in 1567 no attempt had been made on the part of the copyholders to adopt it. In process of time, how ever, experiments began to be made with the view of improving the old methods of cultivation, and on the 6th Dec., 1597, it was resolved by the tenants of Lesbury at the manor court, 'that they shall, between this and the ist of March next, procure a survey of the South field in Lesbury, and ' Duke of Northumberland's MSS. 2 The total is given as .\u00a357 17s. 2W. in the original. 3 See p. 414.

Whosoever shall repugn to dyke in his ground in several within one quarter of a year after the said survey and knowledge of his part, shall forfeit 40s. as above said, and in the meanwhile it is to lie as it is, without converting it to tillage upon pain of 40s., whosoever shall make default to the contrary.'1 This resolution of the manor court indicates that the tenants felt unable to improve their agricultural system until a complete terrier was compiled, but it was difficult to procure a surveyor capable of undertaking so onerous a task. No complete terrier appears to have been compiled until 1614, when an elaborate survey was made by one of the earl of Northumberland's officers. This survey is entitled 'The terror and true content of acres of all the lands, arrable, meadowe, and pasture, comons and wast grounds, within the said mannor of Lesbury, sett downe under the names of the severall tennants which doe now occupie the same.' Owing to the very voluminous nature of the terrier it is impossible here to give more than the following brief abstract of its contents. After a survey of the crofts, etc., there is a terrier of the West field : Lesbury, the West feild. South Brig haugh begining at the east side. Acres. R. Per.

The map shows that the manor or hall was at the east end of the village."], [485, "LESBURY TOWNSHIP. 427 Then follows a list of cottagers, after which is a schedule of the freeholders, who were: Robt. Fenwick, holding 59 acres; Mr. Rodham, holding 10 acres; vicar of Lesbury, holding 4 acres; the king's majesty, holding 1 acre ; Ephraim Armorer, holding 29 acres ; Thos. Bunyon, holding 9 acres ; Mr. Lawson, holding 8 acres ; Anthony Strother, holding 4 acres. John Carr held the water corn mill with 8 perches of land. The commons are specified as follows : The common land at south side of water of Ain, 9 acres ; the common land (another parcel) at south side of water of Ain, 5 acres ; Lesbury common, 266 acres; Lesbury common at the west side of Bastiford lands, another parcel, 108 acres; Lesbury town gate, 20 acres. This terrier shows that there were four common fields at Lesbury, namely, the West field, the North-east field, the East field, and the South field. Some inequality in the size of the farms had arisen before the terrier was compiled, owing probably to the fact that the early part of the seventeenth century was a period of transition, when copyhold was giving place to lease hold. It is, however, clear that the twenty bondage holdings, husbandlands or farms, which existed in 1352, and are again referred to in 1567, survived in a modified form in 16 14. The farm at Lesbury, as at other places, was used as a unit of assessment until the end of the eighteenth century, and for this purpose the farms were regarded as equal.1 It has been stated that the early part of the seventeenth century was a period of transition in the tenure of land from copyhold to leasehold. But this change, which greatly altered the social system, did not take place without dispute. The tenants at Lesbury, as at many other places in Northumberland and Durham, refused at first to acquiesce in taking leases, and endeavoured to retain their position as copyholders. Thomas Fotherley, one of the earl of Northumberland's agents, writing from Newcastle on 14th Aug., 1614, reported to the earl that 'in those trialls for some coppieholds in Newham, Lucker, and Lesburye, the judges making some haste awaie, because they would not ride uppon Sondaies, and that I feared a packt jurie, the matters being of a verie greate consequent to your lordship, I forbare the trialls of them for this present, and besides in mine owne hearing two causes concerning tennante rights passed on the tennants behaulfes : Mr. Baron Bromley, before whome the records of Nisi Prius were heard, seemed something to favour tennante rightes, which also made me forbeare.'2 But the resistance was not long maintained. Fotherley, writing to the earl on 16th Aug., 1615, says, 'I formerlie acquainted your 1 See resolution of the churchwardens, etc., 28th Sept., 1783, in Earl Percy's paper on 'The Ancient Farms of Northumberland.'

They are but gardians for the heire, being uncle to him whose name is George Salkeld ofthe age of xvi yeares, and in respect of his being under age still secure the rente. This I referre to your lordship's con sideracon, praieing your aunswere, for that I have proces against the parties for the debte.'1 William Armorer, another of the tenants at Lesbury mentioned in the terrier of 1614, wrote to Sir John Fenwick, the earl of Northumberland's agent, about the year 1633, saying that he had formerly been in possession of an estate at Brislee by patents from the earl, but had lost the same, 'he being left in minority to the tuicion ofhis unckle Cuthbert Armorer, who was over throwen and utterly undone with grevious suites concerning the slaughter of one Thomas Salkeild, which was done by your peticioner's unckle in the defence of the right and honor of my lord his father.' William Armorer stated these matters to the earl 'when my lord was in the country in his majestie's progress ; ' probably in 1633 on the occasion of the coronation tour of Charles I. to Scotland. After the earl had perused the patent 'he said he was sorry it was letten, but tyme would come, and in the meane tyme, if there were anything were neare him might pleasure him, he should be well respected and used.' William Armorer then stated that he held a farmhold in Lesbury by copyhold, and another at treble the old rent ; he asked for a lease of both farms for twenty-one years, and promised, if the lease was granted, that he would yield up his copy.2 William Armorer afterwards became tenant of Lesbury mill. One of the largest farms at Lesbury at this period was in the tenure of John Carr. His predecessors had been tenants of the mill since the middle of the sixteenth century, and had possessed much property, in the neighbour hood. The following pedigree and evidences will illustrate the history of this family : The change referred to had been in progress for several years. 'Oct., 1607.

He directed that his wife should have Woodhall and Woodhall mill for life, and bequeathed to his son John 'my lands in Lesbury, which I hold by licence of my lord of Northumberland.' He directed that his sons James, Lancelot, and Thomas should be maintained at the Grammar school with the tithes of North Charlton, until they were 18 years of age. He bequeathed to his son Roger his tenement lands in Long Hough ton and Hauxley, and to his base son George four 'quies and 20 ewes.' The testator added: ' I commit Agnes Midlam to the tuicion of my wife, desiring John Carr of Hetton to defend her title to her father's inheritance. And whereas I am charged by the executors of George Midlam to have conveyed some part of his evidences privily away, here I take it upon my conscience that I have not hurt or empared them the breadth of my naile, nor ever concealed anie part thereof from theme.' George Carr of Lesbury, the bastard son of John Carr, is described as a yeoman, in his will dated 23 July, 1607, by which he bequeathed to his wife Elizabeth, the third part of his goods and 'the tenant right of my two tenements, trusting my lord will give his consent.' The testator referred to a marriage ' intended between Thomas Carr of Bulmer's son and one of my daughters.' As the testator left no male heir the copyhold escheated, and Delaval wrote to the earl of Northumberland, 16 Jan., 1608 : ' I forgott to putt your lordship in mynd for a warrant to informe yow of the worth of the tow tenements in Lesbury, laet George Carr's, who was bas begotten and left noe chyldren but four doughters, whom the custome of the manner wyll not admytt as tennents.' Duke of Northumberland's MSS. 'John Carr of Hetton, in the parish of Chatton, by will dated 27 Feb., 1588, committed his body ' either to the earth, birdes, fewles, fyshes, seas or sands.' The testator appointed ' Roger, my cousin's son' his sole executor, and added, 'the said Roger is third son of John and Catherine Carr of Lesbury.' See History of the Carrs, privately printed, vol. i. p. 203. The testator died in 1589, whilst he was serving in the expedition to Portugal, sent to support Antonio against Philip of Spain. A dispute afterwards arose about the probate, in an action ' Katherine Car contra Ann Car.' The following is the deposition of a witness : ' 30 Jan., 1589-90. Archibald Harley of Lesbury, yeoman, \u00e6t. 26, says : \" that about Shrovetyde last this exam inate beinge in London, at signe of the Read Lyon in Flete streat, attendinge of John Car deceased, then his master, the said John Car beinge appointed a capitaine to goe in the Portingaile voyage, did in his chambre, in his inne aforesaid, tell this examinate that he ment then to make his will, and divers evenings wrote on the same, as this examinate thinketh, seing him write and read over some part thereof, and haveing finished the same will, as this examinate thinketh, the said John Car one eveninge in his chambre aforesaid did reade the same all over, and the next morneinge did deliver the same will, with divers other writings, to Mr. Thomas Car, parson of Ford, and willed him to deliver the will and some other of the writings to Mrs. Katheryne Car aforesaid, which will he then said was his last will and testament : and about a fortenight then next after, the said testator departed from London and went to Plimmoth, wher he ley till Easter weke, and then sailed with the rest of the souldiers to Portingale, and so came to Lisbuone, where in the assalt against Lisbuone, the said testator was shott in the bodie with a muskett ; whereupon this examinate and others conveyed him presently to his chamber in Lisbuone, where a gent of his company did ask him, the said testator, if he would make his will, and he, beinge of good and perfect memory, answered that he had maid his will at London, and had committed the same to his cosyng Thomas Car, to be delivered by him to the said Katheryne Carr, and that will he said should stande, and then said that his brother Valentyne Carr, beinge then with him, had drawne him to that doyng, and wished that God should forgive him, and said that he would give him dureing his life vj1' xiij8 iiij'1 yerely out of his lyveinge, and so within one houre after he dyed, this examinate holdinge him contynually in his armes, from the tyme that he entered into his chamber till he dyed.\" ' Depositions before the Durham Consistory Court. Roger Carr of Newmoor house, by his will dated I Ap., 1620, directed that he should be buried at Lesbury.

The mill, which was for a long time in the hands of the Carrs, was a very important institution in the township, and yielded a large rent William Archbold, writing to an agent of the earl of Northumberland on 25th June, 1658, suggested that the mill might be let to John Carr, as it had been long in the tenure of his predecessors. He also refers to some other matters in his letter, which is as follows : Right worshipfull, I received your letter the 19th of June, wherein your worship desires one accompte from me for Lesburie mill & Warkworth fishings ; as for Lesburie mill I did never see Mr Widdrington's letter, for it was not comd when I parted from your worshipe, but Mr Hunter tould me that your worshipe had written to him to forbid me to meddle with her, upon which I did forbeare ; Vol. II. 55"], [492, "434 LESBURY PARISH. till nowe I have harde from your worshipe.

During the whole of the seventeenth century the ancient manorial customs continued to be maintained at Lesbury, but the manorial court was falling into decay. In 1676 William Armorer was bailiff of the manor, and his father, of the same name, had been bailiff before him. The township of Bilton continued at that time to appear and do suit at the court of the manor of Lesbury, which had been held at Lesbury until a few years before this date, when it had been removed to AInwick.1 Every farm on the manor 1 Exchequer Depositions, 28 Chas.

These customs gradually fell into disuse, partly through the changes in the social system, and partly through the perfunctory manner in which they were performed. One of the agents connected with the manor named Anderson, writing on 20th Dec., 1724, lamented the changed state of things. He said ' Denwick, South Charlton, Lesbury, Shilbottle, and Bilton are obliged to doe bondage service to the castle [of AInwick], viz.: leading materialls for repair, coales, whins, straw, but now almost deny, or at least neglect to doe it, and nothing I can get from them to doe till just when the audit is appoynted, and then insist on 6d. for drinks for each fother of stones, and not half-loades. . . Mr Thomas Armorer, he is bailiff [of Lesbury] and has 2 farms, has brought in no coales to the castle for these 24 years by past. Please give me leave to demand so much money of them as is commonly given for the carriage, and then wee shall both gett better measure and better coales, and agree with a certain person to bring in the bondage coales : in summer the tenants, ther servants, when they goe to coal-hill, the fellows will not stay to gett good coales, but take up all the bad small coal, which is intended for burning lyme, saying anything will serve for the castle use, and, when brought, they will argue that they are to leave them without the castle gate, and not to bring them in.'1 Whilst the ancient customary services were falling into disuse and obliv ion the enclosure ofthe moor was in progress. In the survey of 1567 it is stated that the tenants of Lesbury, having very little pasture ground in their own township, had from time immemorial depastured their oxen in the com mon of the lord of the manor at Shieldykes, a piece of ground now within the township of AInwick.2 But, at the beginning of the eighteenth century the tenants had almost lost their right of common on this moor through long disuse, as they had found that their cattle, bred upon a fertile soil, did not thrive on the barren moorland. Lesbury Moor appears to have remained unenclosed until 1717, when stints on it were held by the vicar of Lesbury, Alexander Adams of AInwick, and Edward Gallon of AInwick. The portion of the latter was a 1 Duke of Northumberland's MSS. 2 In the court roll of the manor of Lesbury of 1702 is an order, ' Whereas there has been of late a great neglect in not riding the bounder of Lesbury West common, joining on with the Black Lough and the Shield-dykes, we order and appoint that upon St. Mark's day yearly every farmer shall be there and nde the bounder, and whoever shall be deficient shall be fined 3s 4d.'"], [494, "436 LESBURY PARISH.

The duke of Northumberland bought this plot in 1845, and at the same time pro cured the other freehold plots by purchase or exchange. The descendants of some of the freeholders living at Lesbury in the sixteenth century retained their property in the township until recent times. One of these was Michael Coulter, who was descended through the Fenwicks from William Herrison, the last abbot of AInwick, who became vicar of Lesbury after the Dissolution. The pedigree given on the preceding page shows how the property which he possessed came into the possession of the Fenwicks, and was added to the estate which they had previously held in Lesbury. From this pedigree it will be seen that the freehold belonging to the Fenwicks passed into the family of Coulter, by the marriage of Elizabeth daughter and co-heiress of William Fenwick, to Michael Coulter of Lesbury. It is interesting to trace the descent of the property of the last abbot of AInwick through the various generations of the Coulters to Michael Coulter, who sold his freehold estate in Lesbury in 1840 to the duke of Northumber land, who is now the sole owner of almost the whole township.

The Church of St. Mary.1 In the survey of the manor of Lesbury, made in 1567, it is incidentally mentioned that the church of Lesbury was the first parish church founded in that quarter. No authority is quoted in support of this statement, but it is possible that records referring to the foundation of the church existed in the sixteenth century which have since perished, or, more probably, that an oral tradition survived which has since been forgotten. However this may be, 1 For the evidence ofthe dedication, see p. 441."], [497, "THE CHURCH OF ST. MARY. 439 the statement is made in so definite a form that it should not be dis regarded. It is not necessary to suppose that there was any church at Lesbury, at a very early date ; on the contrary the statement might possibly support the supposition that the parish church was a comparatively late foundation, as a tradition as to the precise date of the building would other wise have been less likely to survive. Corroborative evidence tends to strengthen the same hypothesis. There is no doubt that the small chapels in many townships are survivals of an ecclesiastical system anterior to the division of the country into parishes, and some records relating to Rennington suggest that the chapel in that township was an earlier founda tion than the parish church of Embleton to which it became afterwards dependent. An ancient chapel of the same kind existed at Alnmouth in the parish of Lesbury, and remains of a memorial cross have been discovered at Alnmouth which show that a church existed at that place in Anglian times. On the other hand no remains of pr\u00e6-Conquest masonry exist in the church of Lesbury, and no portions of a cross or other memorial of that time have been found in the vicinity. There is no record relating to the church before the year 1147, when Eustace, son of John Monoculus, otherwise known as Eustace Fitz-John, gave to Baldwin, his clerk, who became the first abbot of AInwick, the church of Lesbury with the chapels of AInwick, Houghton, and Alnmouth.1 From this it appears that before the year 1 147 the church of Lesbury was the mother-church, and that the chapels of AInwick, Long Houghton, and Alnmouth were subordinate to it. After that date the church became subordinate to the recently founded abbey of Alnwuck, to which the advow son belonged, and so lost somewhat of its independent position. In a subse quent confirmation of his gift, Eustace Fitz-John stated that he had given to the abbey the church of Lesbury with its appendages, namely, the chapel of Houghton, and the chapel of St. Waleric, and the chapel of AInwick, from which it appears that the chapel at Alnmouth was dedicated to St. Waleric.2 He also gave to the abbey all the tithes of the parish of Lesbury, and a plot of ground in the borough of St. Waleric.3 In a later confirmation by William, son of Eustace de Vescy, this plot of ground is described as being in ' Alne- 1 ' Eustachius filius Johannis monoculi, qui duxit in uxorem Beatricem filiam unicam et heredem Iuonis de Vescy, dedit abbati de Alnewick ecclesiam de Lesbury cum capellis de Alnewick, Hoghton, Elmouth, Baldwino clerico suo, et fuit primus abbas de Alnewicke, anno Domini 1147.' Dodsworth MSS. lxii. fol. 89. 2 Dodsworth MSS. vol. 49, fol. 11, etc. 3 ' Et unam mansuram in burgo de Seo. Walerico.' Ibid."], [498, "LESBURY PARISH. 440 mue, where the chief house of the canons is situated.' Alnmouth therefore was otherwise called the borough of St. Waleric. At the same time William de Vescy gave to the canons the fishery of Lesbury with all the privileges appurtenant to it.1 The church of Lesbury, although it had been granted to the abbey of AInwick, continued to be served by secular clergy, until the middle of the fourteenth century. In the year 1331, however, the abbot and convent addressed a petition to the bishop of Durham, Lewis Beaumont, in which they stated that the churches of Lesbury, Shilbottle, and Alnham, belonging to them, had been in times past served by seculars, and that on this account much litigation and discord had arisen. They asked, therefore, for per mission to present members of their own body to these livings. By a decree dated 31st July, 1331, Bishop Lewis granted their request, but omitted to make any stipulation as to the income to be paid to the new vicars. It will be understood that the new arrangement was very beneficial to the abbey, as it was not only within the power of the canons to confer the benefices upon members of their own house, but also to pay the vicars a stipend regulated by themselves, and to appropriate the residue to their own uses.2 The benefice at this time was very valuable.3 After 133 1 the history of the benefice becomes merged in that of AInwick abbey until the Dissolution, when the advowson became vested in the Crown. The Lord Chancellor retained the right of presentation until 1892, when the advowsons of Lesbury and Shilbottle were transferred to the duke of Northumberland, who granted to the Lord Chancellor the right of presentation to Alwinton, Holystone, and Ilderton, in exchange. Further facts, illustrating the history of the benefice, will be found in the following list of the incumbents, which is as complete as the materials will admit, and in the visitations, etc. Vicars. 1306, July 20.

Stockdale, in some lengthy replies to questions addressed to him by Bishop Barrington, stated that he was not constantly resident. He had expended ,\u00a3200 on the vicarage house ; there was a school at Lesbury and another at Alnmouth, containing 60 and 50 scholars respectively. 1840. Archdeacon Singleton reported that the 'steeple is, if not unsafe, at all events in an unsatisfactory state, resulting I should think from injudicious repairs after some neglect. . . I was shy of giving any orders, which might awake a church-rate war.' 1846. Under the direction of Mr. Salvin, the south wall and a portion of the north wall were rebuilt, and the roof and tower were repaired at the expense ofthe duke of Northumberland and Earl Grey.

There is a house at Lesbury, the use of which is granted by the duke of Northumberland for a school, and residence for the master.

Whether or not there was a church at Lesbury before the time to which some parts of the present building belong, it is impossible to ascertain, but there is nothing left which can be attributed to an earlier date than the beginning of the twelfth century. Though it has been much damaged by injudicious repairs and rebuilding, which render its architecture somewhat difficult of interpretation, it still possesses many features characteristic of a medi\u00e6val Northumberland church. From some points of view the sturdy tower, covered though it is by a modern and incongruous roof, as it rises above the surrounding trees, makes a prominent object in the landscape. The plan comprises a tower at the west end, a nave and chancel ; the latter of more than ordinary proportionate length, being in excess of that of the nave. Both nave and chancel have a north aisle of two bays, the latter extending to a little beyond the middle of the chancel, and having at its east end an additional building, probably of the seventeenth century, which is now used as a vestry. 1 1730, May.

The original church apparently consisted of a nave, a chancel, and a tower. Of this church there still remain the greater part of the nortii and east walls of the nave, which have an original string-course on the inner face ; the jambs and the impost of the chancel arch ; and the lower portion of the south wall of the tower. It was probably built in the earlier years of the twelfth century. The arcades were broken through the original walls apparently about the end of the same century, but the way in which the capitals and bases have been damaged by re-chiselling, both here and in A VIEW OF LESBURY (Beilby, 1773). From a portfolio in the possession of the duke of Northumberland, the chancel arch, makes it difficult to speak with any certainty of their date.1 At the beginning of the thirteenth century the present chancel, with the chancel arch, replaced the older and smaller one. There are three lancet windows on the south side of the chancel, wffiich, though renewed exter nally, appear to retain their original internal arches and jambs. The east window of three lights, inserted about the middle of the fourteenth century, is all original, with the exception of the tracery and mullions, which are no doubt to a large extent a reproduction of the old ones. On the out- 1 An aisle added to a chancel in the twelfth century is a very unusual feature in a parish church, but the architectural details in this case appear to make the date assigned the most probable one."], [505, "LESBURY CHURCH. 447 side the original hood moulding, with carved heads as terminations, is a noticeable feature. At the time when the chancel was enlarged the tower also appears to have been extended, and to a great extent rebuilt. It is of two stages, there being a set-off about mid-height ; and the belfry has two old lancet windows on the north and west sides, the first not being in the middle of the wall, but towards the north. A modern lancet on the east side probably represents an old one. A string-course on the south side, a little above mid-height, appears to mark the extent of the twelfth-century walling, as on this side the set-off is of two deep slopes moulded beneath. The tower arch, which is very lofty, seems to be of fifteenth-century date. It has a chamfered arch, with roll moulding on the soffit, which is treated in the jambs as a shaft, with semi-octagonal capitals and bases. The roof -was put on to the chancel about the end of the fifteenth century. It is a very fine example, though perhaps a little rude, of the wood work of the period. It has the peculiarity of having beneath the ridge beam a thin moulded straining piece connecting the tie beams. The beams have deep hollows carved with bosses of conventional leaf and flower patterns, with grotesque creatures, one an animal like a pig, and with the crescent and shackle bolt, Percy badges, and a scallop shell.1 The font, placed on an octagonal shaft, is itself octagonal, with slightly hollowed faces, which have upon them four plain shields and two crescents, and two shackle bolts. It is of very rude work, and is pro bably of the same date as the chancel roof. The occurrence of the Percy badges on these two pieces of work seems to point to their being due to the munificence ofthe then earl of Northumberland. The two arches of the chancel arcade, leading into what was, no doubt, at least one chantry, are now of the same width, but originally the east one was wider. The alteration was made in 1853, and power to make it is con tained in the application for a faculty then granted. In the two western angles of the chancel are stone brackets, set across the angle, for the purpose of carrving the rood beam. There are three buttresses at the east end of the chancel, the middle one, which is shorter than the others, and the north one are old, the south one being modern. On the north side of the church are four massive buttresses, one of the middle ones having much less projection than the others. The east one marks the end of the chancel aisle ; the wall 1 A bend charged with three escallops is part of the armorial bearing of the family of Middleham of Alnmouth, for a long period large owners in the parish of Lesbury.

There are two modern windows in the chancel aisle, the eastern one of two, the other of three lights ; they are most likely reproductions of old windows, for they are of quite a different character to the bald and featureless windows placed in the church at its 'restoration.' The porch is modern. HAWKHILL. The township of Hawkhill, having an area of 736 acres, lies to the north-west of Lesbury, and contains a substantial farm house, situated on the road from AInwick to Alnmouth. A smaller house adjoining the railway at the south-west corner of the township, is known as Old Hawkhill, and marks the site of the manor house and hamlet. Old Hawkhill stands on rising ground overlooking the valley of the Ain, and commands one of the most picturesque views to be obtained in the neighbourhood. Numerous pre historic interments were found in stone cists in 1850 on the hill called Shell-law, which is about 182 feet in height, and close to Hawkhill farm. The cists were of various sizes and of the usual type, but one was double, and contained a fine specimen of the so-called ' Drinking Cup,' as well as a ' Food Vessel ' of ruder manufacture.1 In the thirteenth century the township was held of the lords of the barony of Alnwick by Richard de Haukhill, as one knight's fee.2 He was succeeded by Nicholas de Haukhill, who was the owner in 1289.3 His name stands at the head of the list of the persons who paid subsidy at Hawkhill in 1296 : Haukill.

His con nection with Hawkhill appears, however, to have been severed in 1299, when the sheriff was ordered to arrest him for an assault which he had committed on the person of German de Broxfield, the king's bailiff of Coquetdale.2 It is probable that Hawkhill was confiscated after Nicholas's conviction, for when it is again mentioned, in the year 13 14, it is stated to have been the property of John de Burghdon.3 The name of John de Burghdon does not appear on the list of the inhabitants of Hawkhill in 1336,4 but in 1346 Alice de Burghdon, perhaps his widow, continued to hold the township of Henry de Percy.5 In the course of the fourteenth century, Hawkhill passed again into the hands of new proprietors, being granted by Henry de Percy to Thomas de Grey. The latter was in possession of it in 1368,6 and the township remained in the hands of his descendants until a few years ago, when Lord Grev exchanged it with the duke of Northumberland. Hawkhill being a small and comparatively unimportant township, never possessed an independent manor court, but was subordinate to the court of Lesbury. The tenants were bound to do suit to Lesbury mill, as is stated in the survey of the township made in 1567, which is as follows : The towne of Hawkle, althoughe yt be holden of the lordship of Alnewick by The town knight's service, as at lengthe yt appeareth in the charge of the forayne balyff, and of Hawcle. oweth sute to the knight's courte in Alnewick, yet, for that yt ys within the bounder of Lesburye and parcell of that lordship, the lord and tenants there are bounde to answer at the courte of Lesburye, as well for the servyce there as that the said towne of Hawkle ys parcell ofthe lordship of Lesburye as ys beforesaid.

Frissell died in 1599, and the inventory taken at his death shows that 'fyve oxen and two quys, upon the tenement in Hawkle, were stole by the Scottes the night after he dyed.'3 Upon the death of Sir Thomas Grey of Chillingham, in 1590, Hawkhill became a part of the inheritance of his brother Edward Grey of Morpeth, who was the proprietor when the following survey was made in 16 14: Hawkle towne and closes : Hawkle, houses and garthes, feilds, closes, pastures, lying on the north side of the water of Alne with the comon thereunto adjoyning, belonging unto Mr Edward Grey and cont' 689a. ir. o),p.

Among the debts which John Grey owed at the time of his death was a sum of ios. due to 'Sir Arthur Gray for his rent and his crop.'6 1 Duke of Northumberland's MSS. 2 See p. 254. 3 Durham Probate Registry. 4 Duke of Northumberland's MSS. 5 See vol. i. p. 184, note. 6 Will of John Gray of the parish of Lesburie, yeoman [dated 4 Sept., 1631, proved 1632], 'my bodie to be buned in Lesbury church.

In a survey of the barony of AInwick, made in 1 704, three years after Lord Tankerville's death, it is stated that ' Hawkell alias Hawockhill,' was the property of the late earl of Tankerville, ' and before him Thomas Grey, knight, son and heir of Ralph Grey, held by one knight's fee, which Richard Hawkell sometime held.'-' The township remained the property ofthe Grey family until 1871, when, as has been already stated, Earl Grey transferred it to the duke of Northumberland in exchange for land in the township of Long Houghton. The tithes of Hawkhill, with those of Bilton, were in the possession of Francis Brandling of Bilton Banks in 1723. One of Brandling's daughters married Thomas Ilderton, and her descendants resided at Hawkhill during a great part of the eighteenth century, probably on account of the facilities which they enjoyed in the collection of their tithes when living there. In 1839, when an award was made under the Tithe Commutation Act, a rent charge of was allotted to Sanderson Ilderton on account ofhis tithes of Hawkhill. BILTON. The township of Bilton, containing 1,382 acres, is bounded by Shilbottle on the west, High Buston on the south, and the river Ain upon the north. The village is situated in the centre of the township, which is touched by the main line of the North Eastern railway. Bilton formerly contained three common arable fields, namely the North, East and South fields, as is shown by the map of the township made in 1624.3 The manor house and garth then stood at the west end of the village, at the north side of the road leading from Bilton common in the direction of the river. The map shows also a series of coal pits upon Bilton common, lying in two parallel rows, which were evidently worked by what is known as the bell-pit system. By this system pits or shallow shafts were sunk down to the level of the coal- George his three children, when they come to lawful years, 40s. each.

The system was a very rudimentary one, and the workmen were unable to extend their operations by means of galleries, probably owing to the difficulty of providing suitable drainage and ventilation. In addition to the village of Bilton and the houses grouped round the railway station, the township contains several farm steads, amongst which may be mentioned the ' Walk mill,' Spy-law, Bilton Barns, and Bilton Banks. The farm, which stands on the site of the old Walk-mill, lies in the valley of the Ain, below old Hawkhill and above Long Houghton mill. The township of Bilton was subordinate to the manor of Lesbury, and constituted a part of the barony of AInwick. At the close of the twelfth century it appears to have been held as one knight's fee by Herevicus Coleman, who is mentioned in the Black Book of the Exchequer among the tenants of William de Vesci, holding by military service.1 His descendant, styled Hervicus de Bilton in the Testa de Nevill,2 held the township in the thirteenth century, but seems to have died before 1296, when the following list of the inhabitants of Bilton was compiled for the assessment of a subsidy : Biltona. \u00a3 s. d. s. d.

The township remained in the hands of the same family until the middle of the fourteenth century,3 when, in 1358, William, son of Henry de Bilton, granted to Robert de Umfreville, senior, knight, the reversion of the township of Bilton, which John de Belyngham held during the life of Eleanor, widow of Richard de Bilton.4 In consequence of this conveyance Robert de Umfreville is stated to have been the proprietor of the place in 1368.5 Shortly after that date Bilton, with Prudhoe and other estates belonging to the Umfrevilles, passed to the earls of Northumberland. 1 Liber Niger Scaccarii; Hodgson, Northd.

William Tod and John, the quarryman, were engaged in 1479, for the sum of \u00a31 1, to sink a shaft through the limestone, in order to reach the coal. A large number of workmen were employed in the operations connected with this undertaking. It was necessary to obtain fifteen cartloads of timber from Cawledge park and Shilbottle wood, and to adjust the timber so as to support the sides of the pit. Eight stone of iron and steel were also bought, with an iron hammer, a hook, 2 pickaxes, 400 wedges, and other iron implements. It was moreover necessary to make a long rope, in order to draw stones, earth, and water out of the pit by means of a bucket.2 The coal mine was very valuable in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, as it produced a rental of XT5 a year in X^i when it was let to William Tod, William Algud, and Thomas Fyife for a term of six years. It was stipulated in the lease that the lessees should sink only two new pits, one within the first three years and the other in the last three years of their lease.3 This clause was probably inserted to prevent the lessees from prema turely exhausting the coal by the construction of several new shafts. A similar clause was inserted in the lease of the coal mine granted to George Clarkeson of AInwick, merchant, 14th June, 1533, for a term of sixty years. By this lease it was arranged that Clarkeson should have ' free passage from the said cole-pyttes and also staythe lies, and place bothe at the said colefield and also at the water syde at Aylnemouthe for uttering and carving away the said coles for his most advantage and 1 'Et in considerabilibus custibus et expensis hoc anno factis super reperacione molendini de Bylton valde defect' in fine Radulfi Gray, militis, qui habuit dictum dominium ad terminum vite cvijs ijd.'

If so much coal could not be obtained on anv day ' bv reason of dampe or other impedyment,' leave was given to the lessees to take more on another day, and it was arranged that Clarkeson should pay the earl 40s. a year for the first ten years, and \u00a34 13s. 4d. yearly for the remaining fifty years. The earl also let to Clarkeson ' four lee landes, lving and bounding on the east parte of the wellyng dubbes in Bylton field, and of the sowthe parte to the dyke of Haresyde, and on the northe parte to the pytt called the pallese pytt,' on which to build cottages for his workmen and servants.1 At the close ofthe fifteenth century Thomas Slegge was the chief tenant in Bilton. He appears to have occupied the manor house and to have farmed the demesne ground. His holding, in 1499, included three husband lands, and one husbandland called Randellysland. The other tenants at that time were Thomas Andreson, Edward Mantyll, Edmund Browne, Edward Robynson, William Lapyn, William Frost, Edward Shephird, Thomas Clerk, John Andreson, and John Sand. Each of these held one husbandland at a small customary rent.2 There were, therefore, fourteen husbandlands or farms at Bilton at this time. In 1567 a survey was made of Bilton, in common with other town ships on the earl of Northumberland's estate. As the surveyor had fully described the state of agriculture and other matters in his survey of the township of Lesbury, to which Bilton was subordinate, his remarks with regard to the latter place are comparatively brief. He specially mentions, however, the limestone quarry, and the coal-mine. He then refers to the losses which the tenant had incurred in recent raids, and states the terms on which William Grey held his lease of the coal-mine. His remarks are as follows : Bilton, Quarrey of stone. There ys, within the sayde feilds of Bilton, good frestone quarrell and good slate quarrell, but yt will requyre a greate caste of earth or yt be maide bayre and redy to b3 brought in. Lymestone.

Edmund Slegg, Edward Blythe, John Forster and others lost a large quantity of cattle, and Thomas Anderson, one of the tenants, was killed in an attempt to rescue his property.2 In course of time the demesne land at Bilton appears to have become intermixed with the tenement land, and there was some probability that, unless it was resumed by the earl, its extent would be forgotten and the land would become absorbed by the copyholders. Whitehead, one of the earl's officers, writing to the earl 30th Aug., 1608, says: Mr Delavell and myselfe have had the tennantes of Bilton befor us, accordinge to your lordship's warrante, touchinge the demesne ther. Ther answere is that they have it by copye, and will stand to it that they have, and will not yield to any leasse.

It was said that Clarke 'goeth about to disposesse this peticioner and other your poor tenants of their said costomarie tenaments.' Clarke had instituted a suit at London, but, accord ing to Slegg's version of the story, 'seing your poor tenants there redie to joyne with him in tryall, and knowing his title not good, he did not certify the record.' The tenants sought to bring the matter to a trial, but 'were per swaded and intreated not to troble them selves any further, but to go home and be contented ;' if they did so 'they should never be further troubled by Clarke or any other.' Slegge said, however, that Clarke had brought other actions, and the tenants being 'poor simple men greatly feare further troble (for which they are unfitt) in regard that for a yeare and a halfe now last [past], their rent will not be receyved, though they have lawfully tendered the same, at the dayes or feastes in which they were dew.' In conclusion Slegg asked the earl to weigh their cause and maintain their custom.1 Thomas Slegg was especially interested in the matter of the demesne ground, as the farm which he occupied was composed exclusively of demesne.

One of the farms which he held had formerly belonged to John Heppell, who has been already mentioned in the survey of 1567. It remained in the possession ofthe Heppell family until about 1609, when Widhouse invited Katherine Heppell 'to bring hir cheste and goodes to his howsse, promesing to keepe them safe to the use of the said Katherine ; and, haveing gotte the chest in possession, did take out of the same all the copies of the said farme.' John Heppell, Katherine's brother, implored the earl not to allow his tenants ' to be by such coosenage and wrongfull evidence wrested from their possessions.'1 Notwithstanding this high handed proceeding Widhouse appears to have obtained great influence among the tenants. In the year 161 2 the lessees of Bilton fulling mill stated that when the earl's ' forraine balif did goe to deliver your power suppliants possession of the said parcell of ground, by vertue of the said lease, divers of them [the tenants of Bilton] came weaponed in most outragious manor, and did withstand your officer therein, offering him strokes, sayinge neither lord or officer should come one that ground, never theless divers tymes your honour's officer hath bene there, and, in your lordship's name, comandinge them to deliver possession thereof, which most contemptuously they refused to doe, and in most ryotus manor doe plowe the same, and specially by the meanes and procurement of one Richard Widowes, a tenant of Bylton, who is a setter on of all the tenants there, to oppose them selves therin against your lordshipp, and sent his sonne theither with wTeapons giveinge him directions to kill one of us your power suppliants, and ... he hath drawen all the tennants to this dissoluedyance in bynding them to him in good somes of mony.'2 About ten years after the terrier of Bilton was compiled, the township was ' divided.' It is not always easy to understand what is meant when the lands in a township are said to be 'divided,' as the word may signify either 1 Duke of Northumberland's MSS. 2 Ibid. The following will shows the amount of property possessed by one of these tenant farmers : ' Will of Thomas Alnewick of Biltowne, yeoman [dated 28 Nov., 1619, proved 1619], my bodie to be buryed in Lesburye church.

One or other of these things may have taken place at Bilton, as the language of the petition of Margery Carnaby, in which the division is referred to, will bear either interpretation. The object of her petition was to procure for Arthur Strother, at whose expense she was maintained at Bilton, another piece of land instead of a parcel called Wynola, which he had received at the division of the township.1 The estate, which belonged to the Strothers at Bilton, was the farm called Bilton Banks, which had belonged to AInwick abbey. On the death of Arthur Strother of Bilton Banks in 1696,2 the farm became the property ofhis son Arthur, who married ioth May, 1689, Sarah, daughter of Henry Johnson of Low Buston, and was buried at Lesbury 29th Sept., 1708. He left issue, an only son, Henry Strother, afterwards of Bilton Banks, who married 5th Oct., 17 14, Frances Carr of Lesbury, whose initials, with those ofher husband, and the date, 17 13, may still be seen on the door ofthe small mansion house at Bilton Banks. Henry Strother was buried at Lesbury 17th July, 1718, and under the terms of his will, dated 27th June, 1 7 18, his farm became the property of his uncle, Richard Strother of AInwick. The latter died in April, 1 7 19, and the farm at Bilton Banks was sold on 6th Oct., 1 72 1, by his widow, Jane Strother, and her son, Richard Strother of AInwick, apothecary, to Edward Grey of AInwick, merchant, for \u00a3210. Edward Grey, the purchaser of the estate, was a member of a younger branch of the Greys of Howick, as will be seen from the pedigree on the following page. Edward Grey, the new proprietor of Bilton Banks, settled the farm on William Cooper of Newcastle, M.D., on 29th Oct., 1723, on the occasion of his marriage to Mary, one of Edward Grey's daughters.

The descendants of many of the ancient copyholders at Bilton continued to reside in the township until a comparatively recent date. One of these was Arthur AInwick, who, in 1727, held a tenement farm at Bilton ' called a six ox-gate farm.' A similar farm was in the occupation of Henry Rosedon.1 The tithes of the township were in early times the property of AInwick abbey. At the Dissolution they became the property of the Brandlings, through whom they descended to the Ildertons.2 The township of Bilton is now the property of the duke of Northumberland.3 WOODEN. Wooden, pronounced Ooden in the vernacular, is a small township at the south extremity of Lesbury parish, which contains 276 acres. It appears in early times to have formed a part of the barony of AInwick, and to have been granted by the lords of that barony to a member of the Gaugy family. The place may be identified with the croft called 'Alden,' which was given by Adam de Gaugy in the twelfth century to Aliz de March'a. It will be remembered that Adam de Gaugy, rector of EUingham, gave to Aliz de March'a, at the same time, the croft called 'Sunnolt' or 'Sunnildisflat,' which appears to be identical with Sunderland flat, a parcel of land at the south of Lesbury East field, on the north side of the Ain, not far from Wooden.4 There is no doubt that much of the land afterwards incorporated in the borough of Alnmouth and the township of Lesbury, was at one time a part of the township of Wooden, and it is probably due to this circumstance that the chapel of Alnmouth was known until recent times as ' Woden's chapel.' The small estate of Aliz de March'a became afterwards the property of Adam de Walmden, who renounced his rights in ' Sunnildisflat' to the prior and convent of Durham.5 The Alden or Walden croft, however, appears to have remained for some time in the hands of a family deriving its name from the place,6 until some portion was conveyed to Richard de Emeldon, from whom it passed to his widow Christina, wife of William de Plumpton. At the time of her death, in 1364, she held land in ' Wolden,' Alnmouth, and Lesbury,7 and thirty-two years afterwards her daughter Jane, who had 1 The Rosedons were tenants on the farm called Bilton Barns. 2 See vol. i. p. 247. 3 The Threap Moor was divided in 1815 between the duke of Northumberland and Edward Henderson. 4 See pp. 272, 273, note, etc. 5 Ibid. \u25a0 See pp. 236, 237.

The survey is as follows : Woulden.

The tenants of Bylton and Overbuston do troble the tenants of Woulden for the common pasture, which wold also be ordered by his lordship and councell.6 In another survey, made at the same period, it is stated that 'Wooden was parcell ofthe manor of Preston,' and was let to two tenants with other lands which had descended to the earl of Northumberland, on the death of Lady Eleanor Percy, his mother.7 1 Inq. p.m. 14 Ric.

Sir John Forster, writing to Burghley, 30th June, 1590, enclosed the following list of their complaints : Complaines William Awder and Johnne Branxtoun of Woodenn vpponn James Hall of Hevisid and his complices, for stealinge and receiptinge xv kye and oxenn, and thre horses and meares, and insight goodes to the valewe of xl\" sterling, the xxvij1\" of October, 1589.

John Branxton of Wooden, for instance, whose losses were exceptionally heavy, was the son of a man who could only bequeath four sheep and one cow to his family at the time of his death.3 When Wooden was surveyed in 16 14 the township belonged to two free holders, Edward Roddam and Ephraim Armorer.

Before the year 1663 it had passed into the hands of Henry Thompson.1 In 1704, it is stated that 'Samuel Bell, gent., late Jonathan Thompson, and Mr. William Brown' held at Wooden 'several messuages, some time in the tenure of the Lady Ellinor Percy, the pryor of Brenck burn, Robert Roddam, and Robert Ord.'2 Very shortly afterwards the estate passed into the hands of Samuel Gill, a merchant of Newcastle, who by his will, dated 17 19, bequeathed annuities from his land at Wooden to his nieces Elizabeth, wife of Ralph Lazenby of Hexham, and Frances Dawson of Hexham, widow. The farm eventually became the property of John Gill of Edinburgh, who was a freeholder in the township from 1748 to 1778. In 1778, William, son of Francis Forster of Low Buston, contracted to purchase Wooden from Dr. Gill, and Francis Forster, by his will dated 31st July, 1778, bequeathed to his son to complete the purchase. But the sale was never carried into effect, as the purchase money was sent to Ireland, and was afterwards lost through the failure of a bank in Dublin.3 Owing to the abandonment of these negotiations Wooden was sold in 1801 to Thomas Buston of High Buston, and Edward Gallon.4 The duke of Northumberland acquired the portion belonging to the Gallons about 1845, and that belonging to the Bustons about 1880. The old thatched mansion-house, lighted by small windows with stone mullions, was pulled down about ten years ago. ALNMOUTH.

The hill, on which the village stands, is a wedge-shaped promontory, sloping sharply away to the river on the west and to a long stretch of sandy links towards the north. The large granaries which still remain in the midst of the red-tiled cottages show that in former times the mouth of the river was used as a harbour for the export of grain. Now, however, they have been for the most part converted into dwelling-houses to meet the requirements of a modern watering-place. The prehistoric remains, which deserve to be noticed in connection with the township, are not numerous.

The fragments are very richly sculp tured, and may reasonably be taken to mark the site of a large church built to meet the needs of an important town.

Ain, which flows beside the mound on which the church once stood, marks the ancient boundary between the diocese of Lindisfarne and that of Hexham, of which Cuthbert was chosen bishop in the year 684. ! The circumstances which attended his election may be briefly explained. In the year 681 Trumbriht had been appointed bishop of Hexham, but was deposed for misconduct in 684, when it was found difficult to find a suitable person to fill his place. A synod to elect his successor was held in the presence of King Ecgfrith, and under the presidency of Archbishop Theodore at Twysord, on the banks of the Ain, when the suffrages of those present fell on Cuthbert. Beda, who records the proceedings of this synod, is unusually precise in his description of the place where it was held. He says it was ' near the river Alne, in a place which is called Adtwifyrdi, which means ad duplex vaditm,' or at the two fords.2 There is not now any town upon the Ain called Twysord, but Alnmouth corresponds to the description, as two fords across the river exist there. Moreover, it is probable that the synod was held at a spot which could be reached by sea, and no more suitable meeting place could have been found than a town on the boundary of the diocese over which the new bishop would have to exercise jurisdiction.3 In the course of time the town which was at Twysord seems to have disappeared, but it is probable that some remains of the church were in existence in the twelfth century when the lord of the barony of AInwick determined to create a new town and harbour at the mouth of the river. The date of the rebuilding of the town may be approximately fixed by a charter, of which an ancient transcript is preserved among the duke of Northumberland's muniments. By this deed William, who became earl of Northumberland in 1152, and was afterwards better known as William the Lion, king of Scotland, granted leave to William de Vescy to have a court at ' St. Waleric, which is called the new-building [Neubiginge].' The deed, which was executed at Edinburgh, is attested by many illustrious persons, 1 The Priory of Hexham. Surt.

To provide a place of worship for the burgesses it was not necessary to build a new church, for one was already standing at the mouth of the river, which it would only be necessary to enlarge or rebuild. After the enlarging or rebuilding of the chapel, it appears to have been reconsecrated in honour of the patron saint of the new town. It had been apparently heretofore called Walden or Wooden chapel, from the name of the township in which it stood. Hence forth it was intended to be called the chapel of St. Waleric, but nevertheless it continued to be popularly referred to as Woden's chapel until recent times. The borough and chapel of St. Waleric were named after a saint whom a Norman baron would naturally select as the patron of a new seaport. St. Valery was the founder and first abbot of the monastery of Leuconaus at the mouth of the Somme, which with the adjacent town took his name in the ninth century. St. Valery died in 622, and after his death his body was, like that of St. Cuthbert, frequently moved from place to place. In the course of time it became celebrated for its wonder-working properties, of which the Conqueror on a famous occasion was anxious to avail himself. It will be remembered that Earl William's expedition was hindered at the outset by contrary winds, when attempting to set sail from the harbour of St. Valery. There was danger of a panic when William ordered the body of the saint to be brought forth and exposed to the air, whilst he implored from the saint a favourable wind. The ultimate success of the expedition was attributed to the miraculous properties ofthe relics,2 and it was natural that the Conqueror's followers should delight to honour the saint to whom they ascribed their victory. St. Valery was not, however, a saint whose name would recall any 'This ancient charter is now printed for the first time directly from the original manuscript: 'Willelmus comes Northumbr', illustris suis, constabulariis suis, vicecomitibus suis, ministris suis omnibus, neenon omnibus hominibus suis, Francis et Anglicis Northumbr', qui sunt et qui venturi sunt, salutem.

Nevertheless, St. Waleric's day, April ist, was observed until the sixteenth century by the inhabitants of the district, although the name of St. Valery is not included in the Roman Calendar.1 The new town of Alnmouth so far prospered that Eustace de Vescy, on 2nd Jan., 1207-8, procured permission from King John to have a port there, and a market every Wednesday.2 The chief product sold at the market was fish, which are still caught in large quantities within a short distance of the place. Some questions connected with the payment of tithes of fish gave rise to a serious dispute which continued for some time, and was not settled until the year 1249. On St. Oswin's day in that year a meeting took place at which the abbot and convent of AInwick were present on the one part, and the community of the borough of Alnmouth on the other, under the presi dency of William de Vescy. Certain regulations were then drawn up for the payment of tithe in the future, which throw much light on the conditions under which the fishing industry at Alnmouth was carried on. The regulations are somewhat obscurely expressed, but the general result was as follows. Fishermen, who went to the fishery of Doggedrawe,3 in some cases borrowed tackle or perhaps fish from other persons, and it was agreed that anything borrowed in this way should be restored without payment of tithe, but anything remaining over was liable to tithe. A fisherman who went to the fishery of Doggedrawe with his own tackle was bound to pay tithe from the whole of his catch, subject to a fair deduction for labour and expense. In some cases tackle, or even the boat itself was lost, but the abbot and convent were not liable to contribute anything out of their tithes to repair 1 'Complains Mistres Karr of Lesburie, upponn Davie Graye of Mowe, for a blacke horse stollenn att Wallrishe day laste, 1589, price v1'.'

Permission was given to the abbot and convent and their chaplains of Alnmouth thrice a year to excommunicate all persons in the town who fraudulently borrowed in order to enjoy exemption from tithe, and any persons suspected of this habit might be called on to specify upon oath the borrowed articles. In cases of damage to a boat's equipment or nets, or the boat itself, when they were borrowed, a sufficient quantity of herrings should be restored to the owner as compensation, and the residue was liable to tithe. Should there not be sufficient herrings in the boat to compensate the damage, the abbot and convent were in no case bound to restore more fish than was found in the boat. The fishermen were lastly bound to pay a fair tithe of all other kinds of fish, whether caught by large vessels, boats, or in a siene net, and oil and hemp were also liable to tithe.1 The abbot and convent of AInwick, in addition to their right to tithe of fish caught in the sea, were sole owners of the fishery in the Ain at Aln mouth, which they enjoyed by grant from John de Vescy. The latter had granted to the convent the fishery in the Ain from Rolandscarres to the sea.2 Shortly after the death of John de Vescy the town appears to have attained a high degree of wealth and prosperity, as shown by the list of the inhabitants who were assessed for taxation in 1296, which is as follows: 1 'Anno gracie M\u00b0CCXLIX, die Sci.

This list shows that the town was gradually becoming larger and more prosperous, as the harbour gave good anchorage to vessels engaged in foreign trade as well as to the smaller fishing boats. The port is often mentioned in the records of this period. In 13 14, for instance, Richard de Emeldon, the great merchant of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, addressed a complaint to Edward II. touching the seizure of skins from ships belonging to him which had set sail from Alnmouth, and in 13 16 the bailiff of Alnmouth was directed to pro- vide vessels suitably equipped for the military expedition to Gascony. Again in 1326 all the ships of Alnmouth, capable of carrying 30 tons or more, were ordered to proceed to Orwell in Suffolk for the defence of the kingdom, and not long afterwards the bailiff of Alnmouth was directed to send three or four men to Norwich to take council for the defence of the realm.1 1 Rot.

The town appears to have been almost entirely destroyed about the year 1336, as at that time only one inhabitant was able to contribute to a subsidy. The name of this person was John de Alemouth, who possessed the sum of five shillings in goods.2 For some years after this date the town was partially abandoned and in a state of disorder. Geoffry Sergeant, one of the few inhabitants, had been forced to flee into Scotland because he had killed a man in Alnmouth. For this reason the Lady de Vescy had confiscated his land, which was afterwards given to Richard de Soppett in 1349.3 Owing to its deserted condition the borough appears to have been granted to various lessees, who were allowed to make such profit as they could without payment of any rent. One of these lessees was John Barker, who held the place during the lifetime of John Lematon, by a grant dated 3rd Aug., 1440.4 Twenty-four years later, on 9th April, 1464, Henrv VI. granted leave to the burgesses of AInwick to ship coals, wool, and other produce obtained between the Blythe and the Tweed, at Alnmouth, on condition that no portion of such produce was allowed to fall into the hands of his rebellious subjects.5 Shortly afterwards, with the re-establishment of peace, the fortunes of the town again revived. In a rental, compiled in the year 1498, a large number of burgesses are mentioned, in addition to the freeholders. Amongst the latter were the heirs of Thomas Midlam, the abbot and convent of AInwick, and the vicar of the church, who held 30 acres of land.6 The family to which Thomas Midlam belonged had been connected with the place since the fourteenth century.7 1 Inq. p.m. 7 Ed.

In 1503 only seven ships paid the customary toll of eight pence,1 which was exacted by the bailiff of the port. This official was succeeded in his office by John Carr, son of John Carr a former bailiff of AInwick, who was appointed on May 4th, 1528, 'at the waig and fe thereunto used and of olde tyme due and accustomed, that is to say one peny by the daie every daie in the yere.'2 In order to develop the trade of Alnmouth, many of the burgesses of AInwick, who were interested in the fortunes of the seaport town, entered into an agreement with the earl of Northumberland, on 5th Dec., 1529, whereby they arranged to make a weir or haven at Alnmouth, on condition that the earl should give them wood for the purpose. On behalf of the earl it was undertaken that he should, after the haven was constructed, confirm to the burgesses by a formal writing ' all such liberties as his noble auncestours hath aforetyme givyn unto the burgesses of the seid town of Alnewyke and Ailemouth.'3 The result of the improvements in the accom modation provided by the harbour was soon visible in an increase in revenue, and on 18th April, 1535, the earl was able to assign to his servant George Clarkson an annual sum of \u00a35 8s. 4d. from the issues of his lordship of Alnmouth.4 About the year 1567 a survey of Alnmouth was made, which is a very valuable record bearing on the social life of that period. A brief summary of the topics with which it deals will render the survey more clear and intelligible. In the first place reference is made to the destruction of the town by the Scots. The date of the destruction is not mentioned, but from what has been already said, it is probable that a long time had elapsed between the date of the destruction and that of the survey. The liberties which the town had enjoyed are then recapitulated, and it is stated that since the destruction the privileges of the place had been extinguished, and the site of the town had been granted to lessees. After a description of the site of Alnmouth the surveyor proceeds to narrate its history, and to specify the reasons which led to the foundation of the borough, and the benefits which its existence had conferred on the neighbouring district. These advantages had been lost since the town had fallen into ruin, and many lax customs had been allowed to spring up which ought to be speedily abolished. 1 Duke of Northumberland's MSS. s Ibid. 3 Tate, AInwick, i. p. 251. ' Duke of Northumberland's MSS,"], [535, "ALNMOUTH. 475 After a full description of the church at the mouth of the river and its constitution, the boundary of the borough is briefly described, and a schedule of the tenants is set forth. Certain recommendations are then made which, if carried into effect, might lead to the reformation of many abuses, and the dues to be paid to the lord are formally recorded. It was thought that a profit might be made out of the rabbit warren, if it was let to a good tenant on suitable terms. The reasons which had led to the enclosure of the scattered strips of arable land at Alnmouth are then enumerated, and the way in which the enclosure had been effected is fully described. After a survey of the commons and highways the writer refers to a parcel called Sergeant lands, which derived its name from a tenant in the fourteenth century, who has been previously mentioned. He then records the services which the burgesses had been accustomed to render in the maintenance of the beacons of the district ; after which he again alludes to certain good customs of the borough which were no longer observed, but which ought to be revived. The concluding passages are perhaps the most remarkable in this very valuable record. The writer deprecates the narrow-minded criticisms of certain persons who treated his recommendations as those of a good natured but unpractical man. He alludes to the rapid change of fortune which had always been manifest in the history of the North, and records his conviction that not only Alnmouth but also AInwick, the towers and walls of which had been begun and not finished, should be cherished and maintained for the common wealth of the country. The survey, which deserves very careful study, is as follows : Aylemouthe, Surveyed. The browghe of Aylemouth, before the same was invaded and destroyed by the Scots, in every thinge was used and then ordered as th'auncyent browghes of this realme at that tyme were, and had the like liberties for ther trade of living as any of the said browghes scituat upon any port, haven, or cryk, nowe have, or have had, in all respects ; and was then governed and ruled by one baliff and one burrowe greave, over and beside other officers, and wer elected and chosen by the freemen of the said browghe yerly, and then nothing chargeable to the lord by fees or otherwise ; for at that tyme the lord had only a certaine fre rent called burrowe rent, paid yerly for all the burgage of the sayd towne and land perteyning thereunto, as for the rent which was dewe to the lorde for any tenement, burgage, or lande, fallinge unto him and his heires by waye'of escheate or other wayes, with the rent of the common bake howse, towle, and stalladge, and the profett that grewe or did come from the ankeradge, chimiadge, and for measures, with the said burrowe rent, was collected and answered at termes usuall by the sayd bayliff\" and burrowe greyve, with such profitts and casualtyes that did fall to the lord by streat of the court, all wich was yerly aunswered and dewly accompted for by the said bayliff and burrowe greave ; and, since the said invasion, the said browghe did fall into the lorde's hands, and thereby the libertyes"], [536, "476 LESBURY PARISH. extinct, wich was th'onlie cause that the lord hath the rent and services decresed, the good and auncyent rule & government of the browghe abolished, and also the comon welthe of the country nighe therabowt much is dampnyfyed, and now all the sayd burgages and ther appurtenances are letten by copye of corte, saveinge suche tenements with certain landes perteyning to the same and holden of his lordship by certain services, as hereafter shall appeare, and the rest of the land there is the lord's and letten by his lordship's dimission, the inhabytors ther nowe in greate povertye.

They were for the most part Scots, as is shown by an alien subsidy roll for the year 1541 which gives the names of eighteen Scots men then living in the town.2 They formed about a third of the whole population, as in 1567 there appear to have been sixty inhabitants, composed of twenty fishermen, the bailiff, the vicar, six persons living by the proceeds of various industries, and thirty-two persons engaged in the unlawful occupa tion of baking and brewing. It was not to be expected that the remarks of the surveyor would pass unnoticed, as he was evidently animated by a sincere desire to see just dues rendered to his master, and the revival of the prosperity of the town. But nothing appears to have been done in order to carry his recommendations into effect until 1594, when the earl wrote to one of his officers from Petworth, on 27th June, as follows : Beinge credyblie enformed that my towne of Alemouth, which heretofore hathe ben able to doe good servyces, and retayned and brought upp dyvers seamen and fyshers for the service of my howses and the generall reliefs of moste parte of the countrye thereabowtes, is nowe all most utterlye depeopled and brought to waste, partlye in respecte thatt men of the countrye for theire particular ease have bought the burgages in Alemouth which they suffer to laye waste, caryenge from theme the profyttes of the soyle in the harveste, and not doinge so muche as the deutyes of nighberhood towardes the people there left, much less any services due to my selffe, and yeat neverrtheles they clayme the ease of my tollage in Alnewicke in respecte they be burgagers of Alemouth, accordinge to an auncyent allowed prescripsion in that behalff.

In a survey of the town, made in 16 14, it is stated that : Alnemouth in tymes past was used for a creeke and haven for all shippes, crayes, cobles, and fisher boats, to land in, and before the same was destroyed by the Scotts it was used as the auncient burroughes, and as such like creekes and havens of this realm then were, and had the like liberties, freelage, and free customs as the burgesses of AInwick, etc. But, since the tyme the said burrough was soe destroyed, the trafifique by water hath ceased and the haven not soe much frequented as before, and for lack of government the same hath falne into the lord's hands together with the liberties thereof, and so remayne at this day ; the inhabitants there very poore and the toune and burrough in great ruine and decay. There is within the said mannor and burroughe a benefice which was of auncient tyme given by the lord of Alnewicke to the late dissolved monastery of St. Marie's in Alnewicke, whereof the kings ma1\", by reason of the dissolucion, is patron, and one Sir John Spence is now viccar and incumbent there, and is now worth by yeare [blank]. At this time the site of the town with the adjoining fields and commons contained 252a. 3r. 27T7Tp., and the town consisted of two rows of houses, the East row in which were thirty-six tenements, and the West row in which were thirty-eight tenements.1 Some of the burgesses of Alnmouth at this time were involved in a dis pute with George Whitehead about the enclosure of a piece of common. In 161 3 Ephraim Armorer, John Spence, and Robert Soulby 'for themselves and the burgesses of Aylemouth' addressed a petition to the earl of Northumber land in which they stated that, Whitehead having enclosed a piece of ground alleged to be common, they had 'in peaceable manner entered into the same ground, and with their feete cast downe to the quantitie of one roode of the hedge, without doing vyolence to anye person whatsoever.' Whitehead, on the earl's behalf, had 'preferred two severall suits in his majestie's High Court of Starr Chamber,' and threatened the tenants' ruin. Another aspect of the matter is shown in a letter written by Whitehead from Tynemouth to the earl, 1 6th Aug., 16 13. At the beginning of the letter Whitehead refers to a great social change which was in progress when he wrote, and the conclud ing passages show that the behaviour of the Alnmouth burgesses had not been quite so peaceful as it had been represented to be. The letter is as follows : For your tryalls of coppy houlde estates against Hunter of Rothebury Forrest, the matter was much debated, and great adoe ther was, but in the end the day was ours. Coppye houldes ar downe the wynde, Amongst the burgesses were Arthur Strother, Thomas Carre, Ephraim Armorer, Joseph Forster, Thomas Dand, Thomas Binnion, Edmund Roddam, George and Arthur Castles, George Lawson.

This fishery is now the property of the duke of North umberland, who receives \u00a38 a year from the fishing boats, being at the rate of \u00a31 for each boat. In the course of the seventeenth century the commons, which have been already referred to in the survey of 1567, underwent some change. In the sixteenth century the commons are described as consisting of all the hills and plain ground lying about the town, and no large enclosures took place until 1688, when a part ofthe common was enclosed for the use of William Brown of Ewart, at that time the principal freeholder in Alnmouth. It was at the same time agreed that the remainder of the freeholders should continue to enjoy rights of common over the greater part of the remaining moor, which was not enclosed. The tenants of Alnmouth, with the tenants of Long Houghton, continued to enjoy a large tract of land as common which was situated at Long Houghton, until it was divided in 1807 by Act of Parliament, as has been alreadv stated in the history of Long Houghton. A piece of land at Alnmouth, estimated to contain 80 acres, not divided under the terms of this Act, still remains unenclosed. The manor court of Alnmouth, which is still occasionally held, con tinued to impose fines and to maintain certain old customs at the end of the seventeenth century. A rental, drawn up at the manor court about the year 1700, gives the names of various persons into whose hands the ancient tenements had descended by inheritance or purchase. A few extracts from this rental are as follows : Maner de Alnemouth. Liberi tenentes.

In the course of the eighteenth century the town regained some of its old prosperity. In a survey of Northumberland, made by Mark in 1730, it is stated that it was ' a very good harbour for ships, and is the only flourishing place for trade and shipping, except Blythes nook, between Newcastle and Berwick.' Many stories are told of the adventures which befel the shipping which frequented the port. In 1744, a vessel the Thomas and Margaret of Sunderland, and a Berwick brigantine laden with corn, were captured off Alnmouth by a privateer after a five hours' engagement, in which 27 men were killed. Again, in a letter written at Alnmouth, dated 5th April, 1747, it is stated that ' last week a privateer off here took a fishing-smack, which was ransomed for and believes she took another sloop which we had no particular account of. In the fishing smack was a young lad, a passenger going to London, in hopes (being a surgeon) of getting into an East India ship. He was stript of in cash, and all his clothes, which he valued at upwards of \u00a330. He came ashore in a melancholy condition, and had not so much as a coat left, save a wide one, that he wore above his night gown, and had not a wig left him, and in that condition rode home to Berwick next dav.'1 Many similar stories are still remembered in the district, and some of the Alnmouth ships, for instance the Express and the Alnwick Packet are not yet forgotten.2 At the same period many large granaries were built, which are no longer required for the storage of grain, as no vessel now enters the river. Whilst the trade of the port was in its most prosperous 1 Newcastle Gazette, Sth April, 1747. \u2022 See Proc. Berw. Nat. Club, vol. viii. p. 250, etc."], [549, "489 THE CHAPEL OF ST.

Various Acts of Parliament refer to this highway, which no longer serves the purpose for which it was constructed. The Chapel of St. Waleric. In July, 1789, two fragments of an inscribed cross, of pr\u00e6-Conquest workmanship, were found near the ruins of St. Waleric's chapel at the mouth of the Ain. The illustrations represent the front and the back of the cross. The height of the two fragments, when put together, is 3 feet, and their greatest width is 1 foot 5 inches. On the front of the stone is a representation of our Lord upon the cross, the thieves are on each side of him, but, being a good deal mutilated, are not very easily distinguishable. Two soldiers stand at the foot of the cross, one holding the spear and the other the reed. At the top of this side of the stone, which may be regarded as the front, is a single line of inscription. The central portion of the back of the stone is defaced, but the other parts of it are filled with bold but graceful knot-work, and a single line of inscription. The narrow sides of the shaft have been decorated with a pattern similar to that seen on other parts of the stone, and on one of the sides there are three short lines of inscription. With the excep tion of two, or perhaps three, Runic char acters, the whole inscription is formed of Roman letters. The line on the front of the stone above the cross has been read as follows : [hl]vdwyg . meh . feg[de], i.e., Hludwyg me fixed. The three lines on the side may be read [? s]avl eadvlfes thr[vh]. The word 'Savi' is supposed to be some form of exhortation, and the last two Vol. ii. 62"], [550, "4QO LESBURY PARISH. words may mean ' Eadulf 's grave.' The line on the back of the cross is mvredeh . meh . wo[rhte], i.e., 'Myredeh me wrought.'1 The fragments are now preserved in the museum at AInwick castle. The chapel of St. Waleric, near which these fragments were found, probably marked the site of a large pr\u00e6-Conquest church, as has been alreadv said. It was perhaps rebuilt in 1 147, when it was given by Eustace Fitz John to AInwick abbey, and was at that time endowed with land on which one of the chief houses of the canons was built.2 The hill, on which the chapel stood, is surrounded on three sides by the river Ain, and was formerly con nected with the north shore by a narrow neck of land, which was broken through by the river in 1806. In recent times the chapel has usually been referred to as ' Woden's chapel,' perhaps, as has been already suggested, because it was built on land which formed a part of the township of Wooden. The early records connected with the chapel are not numerous, but it is mentioned in the year 1305, when Peter de Dunstan was accused of stealing a chalice and vestments from it, but was acquitted.3 In the survey of Alnmouth, com piled in 1567, it is stated that the chapel was at one time served by three priests and a clerk, whence it is evident that it was a church of large size. Two of the priests were maintained by AInwick abbey, and the third priest was maintained by the inhabitants of Alnmouth, who also paid the clerk. At the time of the Dissolution Roger Spence, a canon of AInwick abbey, was incumbent, but it was feared that there would not be sufficient funds to justify the appointment of a successor. 1 See Catalogue of Antiquities at AInwick Castle, No. 279, etc. ' See p. 439.

[16 March.] 1663. 'To certify we have no terrier nor have we glebe land, except one butt of land which payeth 12 pence by year. There is not a house belonging to the curate, only the Easter reckonings, tithe lamb and wool, geese and pigs, and tithe hay in some places, which will not amount above \u00a3_ by year.' Thomas Burletson, and William Walker, had been churchwardens. In 1714 the chief bell was taken from Alnmouth to Shawdon, and was there used as a dinner bell until the fire of 1849, when it was melted. 1734. Mark says in his survey, 'the church is now quite ruined and the covering entirely gone, there having been no service except burying of the dead for many years.' The last fragments of the chapel were blown down on Christmas Day, 1806, but a few grave stones, the inscriptions on which are comparatively modern, may still be seen on the hill where the chapel stood. In 1859, Algernon, duke of Northumberland, gave the people of Lesbury a temporary chapel, and a new chapel, dedicated to St. John the Baptist, was built by public subscription on a new site given by the duke. The present vicar is the Rev. D. Moore, who has a stipend of ,\u00a3230 a year.2 The great tithes which had been the property of AInwick abbey, became afterwards the property of the Gallon family, and are now merged. The town has from time to time been visited by eminent Noncon formists. John Wesley, writing in his Journal, 19th July, 1748, says, 'we rode to Alemouth, a small sea port town famous for all kinds of wickedness.' Three years afterwards he came again, and 'then found the largest congregation he had seen in all Northumberland,' but in 1752 he laments that 'with all our care and skill, we cannot in nine years time form a society in this place, even though there is none that opposes, poor or rich, nay, though the two richest men in the town, and the only gentlemen there, have 1 See p. 476. 2 The former vicars were: 1860, Laurence J. Stephens; 1865, John Carter Brown; 1866, Henry Lewis Winter."], [552, "492 LESBURY PARISH. done all which was in their power to further it.' A chapel for the Methodists was built in 1830 by John Appleby of Low Buston, which was used till three years ago, when a new chapel was built on land held by lease from the duke of Northumberland. The chapel of St. Waleric stood on a piece of rising ground to the south of the present village, and separated from it by the river Aln, which, however, seems to have made its way to the sea by a channel, at one time to the north and at another to the south of the church. That a church, either of wood or stone, existed there in Anglian times is shown by the remains of the memorial cross discovered on the mound in 1789, (A.) ' J. Vilet delin', 177 1 . South-east view of an ancient church near Alemouth.' and if Ad Twifyrdi is the present Alnmouth, there must have been a church there as early as the synod of a.d. 684. But of that building nothing seems to have been left in the chapel which appears to have been built in the twelfth century. What was the nature of that chapel is only known to us now through some drawings preserved, among other local sketches, in a portfolio belonging to the duke of Northumberland, and by an engraving in Grose's Antiquities, dated 1775. The earliest of these drawings are two, A and B, here reproduced, made in 1771, and another, C, made about 1804, which shows that in the interval some part of the building had been destroyed."], [553, "THE CHAPEL OF ST. WALERIC. 493 We learn from these views that the chapel at the time they were made was without a roof and much ruined. It also appears that the nave was the first part which disappeared, probably by the river and sea breaking through the space which had connected the mound with the land lying to the north. So far as can be inferred from the drawings it would seem that the arches opening into the nave from the transept were then built up, and that the chapel at that time consisted of the transept and chancel. The east wall of the chancel was the next part to be destroyed, which occurred before the year 1775, the date of the copper plate engraved by Sparrow and published in (B.) ' J. Vilet delin', 1771. North-west prospect.' the fifth volume of Grose's Antiquities. This was followed by the disappear- ance of the east wall of the chancel and of the east and north walls of the transept, the last part that remained being the greater part of the west and south walls of the transept. The chapel was of considerable size and of some architectural import- ance, and it is fortunate that it is possible, from these old drawings, to reconstruct, in some measure, an ecclesiastical building of more than common interest. It consisted of a nave with aisles, at least three bays in length, but possibly longer ; a transept of considerable projection, but without aisles, of"], [554, "494 LESBURY PARISH equal height with the nave; a long aisleless chancel, and a small porch, added, possibly, in the seventeenth-century, at the south end of the transept. The nave and transept had each a clerestory. There was no central tower, the roofs of the nave and transept simply mitreing where their ridges joined one another ; nor was there probably any tower at the west end. The ridge of the chancel roof was placed just beneath the corbel table on the east side of the transept. (C) Woden's Chapel, Alemouth. From Lady Emily Percy's book. The chapel, the remains of which existed until last century, was built dur ing the latter part of the twelfth century, some time between 1 170 and 1 190. The arches of construction were pointed, whilst those of decoration, the doorways and windows, were all round-headed. The nave opened into the transept by three pointed arches, the central one rising above the clerestory level. The treatment of the piers supporting these arches was peculiar and unusual. Heavy clustered piers of eight members rose as high as the spring of the aisle arches. The outer portions of the capitals of these piers carried the aisle arches, whilst the inner halves, towards the nave, carried groups of"], [555, "THE CHAPEL OF ST. WALERIC. 495 clustered shafts, which, rising as high again as the piers, supported in their turn the main central arch. The effect of this arrangement as seen from the chancel, and that produced by the contrast between three lofty arches on the west, and the lower one opening to the chancel on the east, as seen from the transept, must have been very striking. The transept had a double range of windows on the east side, two windows, one above another, in the north wall, two coupled lights in the south wall, and windows in the gables, circular to the south and coupled to the north, above a set-off in the walls. It had a bold corbel table on the east and west sides, that on the west side is shown as being above the nave arch in the north-west view (B), clearly by an error on the part of the draughtsman, as the tie-stones of the nave clerestory are shown projecting from the transept wall, and distinctly indicate a nave roof of the same level as that on the transept. The occurrence of a window in the buttress on the north-west angle seems to indicate a newel-stair to give access to an upper gallery, for which the evident thickness of the walls gives some warrant. It will be observed that the doorways in the ends of the transepts are not placed centrally, but towards the west in each case. This shows that altars existed on the east side of the transept, one at least in each wing. The doorways were placed towards the west, so that the traffic from one to the other along the transept might interfere as little as possible with the use of the altars. An instance of the same arrangement is seen in Newbald church, Yorkshire, a fine late Norman building, with a transept, having a doorway at its north and south end, placed opposite to each other and near the west wall of the transept. The chapels of the Nine Altars at Fountains and Durham have each two doorways in a similar relative position. The chancel appears to have been extended towards the east in the thirteenth-century, as both the two-light window in the east bay on the south side and the two lights in the east wall would seem to be of greater size and later character than the other windows. The work of the whole chapel was of a very plain and bold character, and the windows were small in propor tion to the size of the building. The views are as follows: A, south-east view, showing chancel, tran sept, and porch ; B, north-west view, showing north and west walls of the transept, and the remains of the nave ; C, south-west view, showing nave arch built up and north aisle arch gone."], [556, "496 APPENDIX I.

Professor Thorold Rogers has published an account ofthe charges incurred by John de Middleton and his servant on a journey from Oxford to Avignon and back, in the years 1330 and 1331. (History of Agri culture and Prices in England, vol. ii. pp. 631-634). The object of the journey was to procure the appropria tion of the church of Embleton to Merton college, with the sanction of the Roman Curia. The journey occupied seven months, from 21 Jan., 1330, to 24 Aug., 1331. The record of it, which is printed at length by Professor Rogers, gives the various stages and four rates of exchange. Professor Rogers also printed (ibid. pp. 635-642) an itinerary of a journey from Oxford to Embleton and back in 1331 (Jan. 5-March 16), when various representatives of Merton college travelled to the north in order to procure the appropriation of the great tithes of Embleton in the bishop of Durham's court. The account of this journey should be compared with a similar record printed in Arch. Ael. vol. xvi. 1, p. 113, relating to the year 1464. APPENDIX VII. The Arms of the Viscount Family, Land in the chapelry of Horton, in the parish of Woodhorn, appears to have been at an early date in the possession of the sheriffs of Northumberland, and afterwards of the Viscount family. Probably for this reason the place was known as Horton Shireve in the thirteenth century. See Hodgson, Northumber- land, II. ii. p. 260. The following deed, a conveyance of land by Walran de Horton, or Walran Vicecomes, is preserved in the Marquis of Waterford's MSS. at Ford castle. There is no evidence to show in what way Walran de Horton was related to the Vicounts of Embleton, but there can be little doubt that he was their kinsman and that his seal bears the arms of the Viscount family.
