It is a chapter in the History of English litera- ture, which the student will peruse and reperuse with feelings of mingled delight and pain ; but which he must needs linger over, if he desires to understand the character of the age which the writings of Goldsmith contributed so greatly to enlighten, refine and amuse. The following \u2014 the chief materials for which have been derived from the laborious Biography of the Poet, by Mr. Prior \u2014 ia necessarily limited to a brief sketch. Oliver was the fifth child of the Reverend Charles Goldsmith, at that time curate of Forney, in the County of Longford, and Kingdom of Ireland. He was born on the 10th of November, 1728, at a place called Pallas, in the Parish of Forney. The income of his father was exceedingly limited, and, as he had seven children, he was reduced to considerable straits to maintain his family with any shew of respectability. Henry, the eldest son, was destined for the church, and consequently a good education was to him indispensible. To obtain this, the other branches of the family were compelled to be comparatively neglected. It was proposed from his birth to bring up Oliver to some mercantile profession, which at that period was supposed to require little learning or accomplishments. Reading, z,2"], [12, "MEMOIR OF THE AUTHOR. VI writing and arithmetic Avere deemed as much as men of the ledger could digest with ease; and these were set down as the sum of knoAvledge the future painter of life and manners was to derive from his tutors. His first school was one kept by a dame at Lissoy ; in the Parish of Kilkenny West, County Westmeath, to the rectory of which Charles Goldsmith was inducted in 1730. The characteristics of the child's mind appeared any thing but promising. Mrs. Delap, his schoolmistress, admitted that he was one of the dullest boys ever placed under her charge, and doubted for some time whether anything could be made of him. In the words of a Mr. Handcock, who supplied Mr. Prior with some of his information, he seemed \" impenetrably stupid !\" or as Dr. Strean ascertained, \" he Avas considered by his contemporaries and schoolfellows, as a heavy blockhead, little better than a fool, whom every body made fun of.\" From the terrors and mortifications of Mrs. Delap's nursery for rising critics, young Goldsmith was removed to the domus of the village school master, Thomas Byrne \u2014 a man who had been a soldier in the wars of Queen Anne, and had seen some service in Spain. This old campaigner had more reverence for military orders of the day, than for the rules of syntax, and preferred recounting his strange adventures beyond the Pyrenees to solving the abstrusities of arithmetical compounds. He was, moreover, of a. romantic^urn, wrote poetry, and was well versed in the fairy lore of the country. His pupils, doubtless, had similar predilec tions ; at all events, Master Oliver had ; and to the marvellous relations which he was then accustomed to hear, his family afterwards attributed that wandering and unsettled disposition which was remarked in him through hfe. His eldest sister, Mrs. Hodson, has furnished an account of him at this period. \" His temper, though peculiar, was kind and affectionate ; his manner for the most part uncommonly serious and reserved ; but, when in gay humour, none was more cheerful and agreeable. He was then, as he afterwards appeared to his acquaintances in London, solemn and yet gay, good-natured yet irritable, petulant sometimes, and instantly appeased by the smallest concession \u2014 so that such as did not understand or enquire into the occasional peculiarities of genius were puzzled by this contrariety of disposition ; and the remark is preserved, that he seemed to possess tA\\7o natures.\" But though in all this there were some indications of the superficial man, there was little to reveal the spirit of genius which was struggling for birth within him. He plodded on with his \" impenetrable stupidity,\" and picked up some knowledge of the horn-book, a facility at pot-hooks, and, it may be, a smattering of figures. He at the same time read and learned by rote many of the wild ballads common among the peasantry ; and took great delight in listening to the fairy tales and superstitions with which every hill and valley \u2014 every stream and thicket, was rendered classical. But among his associates he was still made fun of, and mis understood. It was Avhile at the day-school at Lissoy, when Goldsmith was eight or nine years old, that he Avas attacked by the small-pox, the ravages of which left indelible traces upon a countenance which had always been uncommonly plain. On his recovery he was sent to a superior schoolkept by a clergyman, at Elphin, in Roscommon ; in the neighbourhood"], [13, "MEMOIR OF THE AUTHOR. VII of which lived one of his uncles, Mr. John Goldsmith, with whom he spent much of his time, and who was the first to notice the indications of talent which he exhibited. His trials of temper and bufferings with the world had already com menced. He was scoffed and jeered by his schoolmates, as being ugly ; and was nicknamed \u00c6sop in derision. His sensitive nature felt these ribald taunts keenly : for his happiness always depended more upon the good opinion of others than upon himself ; but the little of peevishness that was suffered to escape him, consisted of smart repartees, in which he sought to turn the jests discharged on him upon the head of his assailants. He did something better, however, in his leisure, than squabble with the idle and the brutal. He began to make verses, and to fancy that nature had designed him for a poet. It is not improbable that he aud mankind owe the discovery and developement of his genius to his want of personal beauty ; \u2014 to that which made it necessary for him to draw upon himself for his enjoyments ; \u2014 to the creative power iu his bosom, which loved to people its ideal world with happy human faces, in order to compensate for the repulses it was continually meeting with in actual life. He read much, grew intoxicated with literature, and became an incurable rhymer. Fortunately his uncle and mother were capable of seeing through his \"impenetrable stupidity,\" and discerning the dawn of genius beyond. They had a good opinion of 01iA7er, encouraged his studies, and desired that he should have such an education given to him as might afford him a chance of making his way through life in a manner more congenial to him than at the desk of a merchant's counting-house. His father, with little demur, though it must have sorely tasked his means, \u2014 whose narrowness had, from youth upwards, kept him engaged in that perpetual struggle of the poor man, whose table is surrounded by \"olive branches,\" to \"make one guinea do the work of two,\" \u2014 acquiesced with the general entreaty, and it was decided that Oliver, at a fitting age, should be sent to the University. To prepare him for his altered destiny, he was removed first to a school at Athlone, and subsequently to one at Edgeworthstown in Long ford \u2014 his relatives contributing a trifle each to ease the extra burden thus cast upon the poor old rector of Kilkenny. A singular anecdote is related of Oliver's last journey to Edgeworthstown, previously to his entrance at college. Having left home on horseback, he reached Ardagh, where it was necessary for him to sleep, at night-fall. He had a guinea in his pocket, and was determined to enjoy himself. He asked for the best house in the place, and from a piece of Irish literal comprehension, or waggery, was directed to a prirate house instead of an inn. Goldsmith had no thought of a mistake, and, being readily admitted by the servants, who, from his confidence concluded that he was some well known friend and invited guest of their master, he gave directions concerning his horse, and being shewn into the parlour, found there the owner of the mansion at his fire-side \u2014 a Mr. Featherstone, a gentleman of fortune, and somewhat of a wit. Goldsmith began to call about him with authority, as one entitled to attention ; and, his host having soon detected the youth's error, and being willing to enjoy an evening's amusement,"], [14, "MEMOIR OF THE AUTHOR. VIII humoured his guest, caused Avine, and vshatever else Oliver chose to order to be brought him ; accepted with his wife and daughters an invitation to supper at his oato table, and received with becoming attention strict injunctions to have a hot cake ready for breakfast on the following morning. It was not till he called for his bill before quitting the house that the abashed school-lad discovered his blunder, and learned that he had been entertained at the residence of an old acquaintance of his father. The adventure was subsequently made to furnish the main incident in the comedy of ' She stoops to Conquer.' Goldsmith Avas sent to Dublin and entered at Trinity college, the 11th of June, 1745, as a sizar. His brother Henry had been a pensioner, and it is said that the pride of Oliver revolted at the humbler condition into which the diminished means of his parents caused him to be thrust. In his own opinion his sizarship was the cause of many of his subsequent mortifications, in depriving him of that consideration among his companions on which so much value is set by youth. The duties and costume of the sizar certainly furnish a revolting picture of the humiliations to which the poor scholar was then subjected. He wore and still wears a black gown of coarse stuff without sleeves, and dines at the Fellows' table after they have withdrawn. In addition to this, at the period in question, he wore a red cap, and was compelled to perform menial offices, such as sweeping parts of the court in the morning, carrying the dishes from the kitchen to the dining table of the Fellows, and waiting behind their chairs till that body had dined. This treatment, added to that of his tutor, one Wilder, whose savage brutality and malice are said to haA'e shone conspicuous, checked for a time eA-ery aspiring hope in the student and repressed the exertion of his talents. Of the fitness of this Wilder to direct the studies of such a pupil as Oliver Goldsmith, one anecdote is sufficient. A hackney coachman having accidentally touched his face with the whip while his vehicle was proceeding at a fast pace through the street, he sprung at a bound from the pavement to the box, and felled the driver to the ground. Disgust and hopelessness naturally produced irregularities, and these in turn led to scrapes. Between the author of 'The Deserted Village,' and his college life \"there was no great love from the beginning, and it pleased heaven to decrease it upon further acquaintance.\" In the midst of these distresses, Goldsmith's father died, and his remit tances from home, which were sufficiently scanty before, now ceased alto gether, and his prospects were proportionately darkened. An uncle occasionally supplied his most pressing necessities hoAvever, and Avith this resource, and another which he discovered about this time, added to his constitutional \"knack at hoping;\" he contrived to maintain himself in tolerably good spirits. His discovery Avas of a means of disposing of original street-ballads, for which he found a ready sale at a shop in Mountrath Street, at the price of five shillings each. Tliis was the be ginning of the career of Goldsmith as a professional litterateur. In 1748, in consequence of the gross violence and insolence of the ruffian Wilder, his tutor, who inflicted personal chastisement upon him, he took a sudden resolution to forsake not only the scene of his morti fication, but his country, and to seek his fortune in a kinder region. He"], [15, "MEMOIR OF THE AUTHOR. IX accordingly disposed of his books and clothes, and quitted the University, but loitered in Dublin till he had but a shilling left, with which he set out for Cork. It was his intention to take ship thence for some other land, but his resources did not hold out long enough to carry him to the place of embarkation. On his single shilling he supported himself nevertheless for three days ; and when that was gone, he parted by degrees with his clothes, till at length he was reduced to such extremity of famine that, after fasting for tAventy-four hours, he thought a handful of grey peas, given him by a girl at a wake, the most refreshing meal he had ever made. Fatigue and destitution induced him to return, and his brother, to whom he communicated his situation, clothed and carried him back to his college, where a sort of reconciliation was brought about between Wilder and him. The latter continued as before to detest mathematics, and to perpetrate poetry ; \u2014 the tutor resumed his tyranny with increased malignity and hatred. But notwithstanding his poverty and misery, which would have hardened and corrupted the heart of many of less noble natures, Goldsmith had the most enlarged sympathy for the distresses of others. Mr. Edward Mills, a rich relative and fellow student of his, who occasionally furnished him with small supplies of money, and frequently invited him to partake his meals, used to relate a story characteristic at once of his improvidence and goodness of heart. \" Being summoned on one occasion to breakfast, Oliver declared from within to the messenger his inability to rise, and that to enable him to do so they must come to his assistance, by forcing open the door. This was accordingly done by Mills ; Avho found his cousin not on his bed, but literally in it, having ripped part of the ticking, and immersed himself in the feathers, a situation from which he found it difficult to extricate himself. By his own account, in explanation of this strange scene, after the merriment it occasioned had subsided, it appeared that, while strolling in the suburbs on the preceding evening, he had met a poor woman with five children, who told a pitiful story of her husband being in the hospital, and herself and offspring destitute of food, and of a place of shelter for the night ; and that, being from the country, they knew no person to whom, under such circumstances, they could apply with hope of relief. The appeal to one of his sensitive dis position, was irresistible ; but unfortunate!! he had no money. In this situation he brought her to the college gate, sent out his blankets to cover the wretched group, and part of his clothes to be sold for their present subsistence ; and finding himself cold during the night, from want of the usual covering, he had hit upon the expedient just related for supplying the place of his blankets.\" This anecdote tells the whole secret of the life of Goldsmith \u2014 of his pleasures and his anguish ; of his want of worldly tact and prudence to preserve or value money as he undoubtedly ought to have done, at least as a means of independence, and of his exquisite sense of the sufferings, aud his earnest desire to relieve the wants, of others, even before he had provided for his own. He was conscious, sometimes painfully so, of his own imprudence ; but he could never repress the spirit which prompted his uncalculating generosity. The following is a lesson on the subject, sent"], [16, "X MEMOIR OF THE AUTHOR. in a letter to his brother Henry in 1759. \"Frugality and even avarice in the lower orders of mankind are true ambition. These afford the only ladder for the poor to rise to preferment. Teach then, my dear Sir, to your son thrift and economy : let his poor wandering uncle's example be placed before his eyes.\" It might have been desired that Goldsmith had never been compelled to write thus ; but if he had never felt both the w^nt which led to the sentence, and the sympathy which set his lectures at defiance, he would assuredly never have been the exquisite writer of poetry and prose that he was. Oliver quitted the university in the spring of 1 749-50 immediately after taking his degree of Bachelor of Arts, and for about two yeai > lived chiefly at home with his mother, visiting among his friends, a listing his brother Henry in the management of his school, and joii tng in the rustic sports of the neighbourhood. His friends wished him to be ordained, but he had no great liking for the clerical profession and for a long time declined. At last, however, he consented to apply to the Bishop of the Diocese, and was rejected \u2014 according to one account, as being too young ; to another, from his having neglected the proper professional studies, and the Bishop having received an exaggerated statement of his iirregularities at College ; and according to a third, in consequence of his thoughtlessness and reputed love of gay dress, and a prejudice arising in the mind of the Bishop from the appearance before him of the candidate in scarlet breeches. At all events the now obscure Dr. Svnge had the honour of \"crowing over\" poor Oliver Goldsmith, and of adding a small taste of wormwood to his cup of gall. The mortification, however, was not of a kind to break the heart of him who sustained it. He returned home and consoled himself by writing verses, telling stories, aud singing songs ; by shooting, fishing, playing the flute, and throwing the sledge. The improvident poet next became tutor in a private family, and was subsequently furnished with fifty pounds by an uncle, in order that he might proceed to London, and keep the usual terms of Irish students, preparatory to being called to the bar. Oliver's evil genius attended him on his journey. He was seduced into a gaming house in Dublin, and stripped of every penny of his money ; but, being ashamed to com- municate his loss to his friends, he remained till nearly starved in the metropolis, when he was forgiven and invited back into the country Ihysic was next selected for him as a profession; and by the united contributions of his uncle, brother and married sister, Mrs.\" Hodson he was enabled to go, in the autumn of 1752, to Edinburgh to fit himself for taking his degree. He had not grown more reflecting in consequence of his repeated experience. The first thing he did after procuring a lodoing in the Scottish capital is of a piece with most of the incidents of his life He sallied forth to view the city, was rambling about during the whole day and never bethought himself till night overtook him, that he had ne\u00b0-lected to enquire the name of his landlady, and even that of the street in which he was to live He was fortunate enough, however, to meet the porter who him SSd\u00a3\u00a3\"\" * * ** * ** \u2014** \u2122 * The progress of our medical student at Edinburgh is believed not to"], [17, "MEMOIR OF THE AUTHOR. XI nave been very satisfactory. He remained about a year and a half- long enough to get into more than one unpleasant predicament for want of money - and then proceeded to Leyden, Avhere he is said to have been less attentive to the acquisition of professional than miscellaneous knowledge, and where he was frequently known to be in his usual pecuniary distress. Occasionally he subsisted ou loans of small sums of money from friends, sometimes he \" taught English to the natives,\" and at others he had recourse to gaming in hopes of extricating himself from his difficulties by some lucky turn of fortune. But his irregularities seem to have always pro ceeded from his poverty, and never from depravity or wilfulness. It is necessary to bear this in mind, as he has been accused, by such people as could see nothing in his childhood but impenetrable stupidity, of wrong heartedness as well as want of thought. After a year's residence at Leyden, Goldsmith set out on his travels over the continent. He had no resources, but he had an ardent thirst for information, an unconquerable spirit of hope and gaiety, some learning, and a little medical skill. He was moreover young, vigorous, and accustomed to privation and hardships. Like the Baron Louis de Holberg of whom he has spoken in one of his works, \" His ambition was not to be restrained, nor his thirst of knowledge satisfied until he had seen the world. Without money, recommendations or friends, he undertook to set out upon his travels and make the tour of Europe on foot. A good voice and a trifling skill in music were the only finances he had to support an undertaking so extensive : so he travelled by day, and at night sang at the doors of peasants' houses, to get himself lodging.\" He commenced his rambles, according to Dr. Ellis, who was one of his occasional companions at Leyden, with scarcely any cash and but one clean shirt : \u2014 \" Remote, unfriended, melancholy, slow.\" There is little doubt that the wanderings of George Primrose, in the ' Vicar of Wakefield,' Chap. XX, are, in all the main points, a correct description of the travels of the Author, who has left few other records of this interesting period of his life. Even the fact of his having had a pupil part of the way, is believed to be accurately stated \u2014 the name of the liberal young gentleman, being said to be Smyth or Smyly. After traversing Flanders, part of France and Germany, Switzerland, Italy and France again, he returned early in the year 1 756 to England, and in future fixed his abode in London. His opening prospects were of the most discouraging kind. He had neither \" introductions, acquaint ances nor impudence,\" to help him forward in the populous wilderness, and he was often put to the utmost shifts, for a meal and a lodging. There was once a rumour, which is not improbable, that he tried the Stage in a country town, as a low comedian. It is at all events certain that, in after life, he once expressed a desire to play a low comedy character \u2014 that of Scrub in the 'Beaux Stratagem.' It has also been reported that he set up in a country town as an Apothecary, aud failed ; and that he afterwards returned to London and accepted the situation of usher to a School. That he occupied the latter situation is universally admitted, and that he hated it with as thorough a detestation as he was capable of indulging, has been"], [18, "XII MEMOIR Ol' THE AUTHOR. recorded in various places by himself, and by divers of his friends and familiars. That his means of life at this period were uncertain, is placed beyond dispute by the concurrent testimony of all who afterwards enjoyed his confidence ; and of the dreadful necessities to which he was then subjected, a story told by him at one of those brilliant parties to which the Poet was welcome when his fame was established, will afford a faint but sickening idea. It commenced \"when I lived among the beggars of Axe Lane.\" Well may he, as he subsequently did, have claimed some merit for not having had recourse to \"the friar's cord, or the suicide's halter.\" He gradually picked up a few acquaintances and renewed some old friendships, and was enabled by them to establish himself as Physician in a humble way, at Bankside, Southwark, where his poorer neighbours found him useful, but fee-paying patients cautiously avoided his re- sidence. He had ample leisure, however, to turn his attention to lite- rature, which he had always liked much better than pills and potions ; and this brought him acquainted with Richardson, the celebrated novelist and printer, who is beheved to have employed him occasionally as corrector of the press, and who introduced him to Dr. Young. His personal appear- ance at this time has been noticed by one who had known him at Dublin, aud who now met him in London. \"He was dressed, according to the fashion of the day, in a suit of green and gold, but old and tarnished, and his shirt and neckcloth appeared to have been worn at least a fortnight. He said he was practising physic and doing very well.\" Sir Joshua Reynolds used afterwards to relate a story to the same effect, on the same subject, and relative to the same period. \"In conformity to the prevailing garb of the day for physicians, Goldsmith, unable to obtain a new, had procured a second-hand velvet coat ; but either from being deceived in the bargain, or by subsequent accident, a considerable breach in the left breast was obliged to be repaired by the introduction of a new piece. This had not been so neatly done as not to be apparent to the close observation of his acquaintance, and such persons as he visited in the capacity of medical attendant. Willing, therefore, to conceal what is considered too obvious a symptom of poverty, he was accustomed to place his hat over the patch, and retain it there carefully during the Aisit. But this constant position becoming noticed, and the cause being soon known, occasioned no httle merriment at his expense.\" While struggling for the precarious and humiliating existence which his Bankside business yielded, he fell in with an old fellow-student from Edinburgh, the son of Dr. John Milner, who kept a classical school at Peckham in Surrey. An offer was made to Goldsmith to take charge of this establishment during the illness of the elder Milner, and it was readily accepted, as offering at least a security from starvation, which seemed im- pending. \" AU the ambition \" of Oliver, according to his OAvn statement, \" was now to live ;\" and here he could live in comparative comfort. His character, as developed at Peckham, has been thus stated from re collection by Miss Milner, the sister of his friend: \u2014 \"He was very good natured, played tricks, somewhat familiar, and occasionally a little coarse, upon the servants and boys ; told very entertaining stories, and found amusement in his flute. With the scholars he was a favourite, being ever"], [19, "MEMOIR OF THE AUTHOR. XIII ready to indulge them in certain school-boy dainties, wheneAer his pecu niary means permitted ; and he was not over strict in discipline. His benevolent feelings appeared always active ; mendicants rarely quitted him without relief, and a tale of distress roused all his sympathies. His small supplies were thus exhausted frequently before his stated salary became due, when Mrs. Milner would say to him with a smile, upon application for an advance \u2014 'You had better, Mr. Goldsmith, let me take care of your money, as I do for some of the young gentlemen ;' to which he would reply in the same spirit of good humour, 'In truth, Madam, there is equal need.' \" It was at Peckham he first procured what may be termed regular literary employment, This was from Mr., afterwards Dr., Griffiths, a friend of the Milners', then a bookseller in Paternoster Row, and pro prietor of the 'Monthly ReAieAV.' The terms on which he engaged with this literary vampire were his board and lodging in the house of his employer, and \"an adequate salary.\" At the end of five months this strange contract was brought to a premature close. Goldsmith was tired of his drudgery, and Griffiths was dissatisfied with the labours of an author who regarded quality as more essential than quantity in his compositions. But this was not all. Both the bookseller and his wife interfered with the articles of the poor scribe, in a manner that made their production altogether irksome ; and they had no regard to his domestic comfort or convenience. It was consequently a release from bitter thraldom, when Oliver found himself at liberty to write once more when and as he chose ; although perhaps he was compelled, as a set off against this privilege, to put up with less and coarser food. His connection with the Review did not close with his change of re sidence. He continued for many months, after ceasing to be a domestic in the establishment of Mr. and Mrs. Griffiths, to be one of their hacks, and wrote articles to order on Politics, Poetry, Medicine, Mathematics, History and Romance ; filling his leisure by translating Memoirs and Novels from the French, and by preparing occasional contributions to the ' Literary ' and the ' Grand Magazine.' He appears now to haAre worked almost incessantly ; and if we may except the satisfaction he must haA-e derived from the introduction his labours procured him to Dr. Johnson, Mr. (afterwards Bishop) Percy, Edmund Burke, and a few other dis tinguished men, his toil seems to have met with little reward. In a letter, written at this time [August, 1758] to a friend in Ireland, he gives a lively picture of his mind and his miseries. \"I sat down,\" he says, \"with an intention to chide, and yet methinks I have forgot my resentment i heady. The truth is, I am a simpleton with regard to you. I may attempt to bluster ; but, like Anacreon, my heart is respondent only to softer affections. And yet, now I think on't again, I will be angry, God's curse, Sir! who am I? Eh! what am I? Do you know whom you have offended ? A man whose character may one of these days be mentioned with profound respect in a German comment or Dutch dic tionary ; whose name you will probably hear ushered iu by a Doctissimus Doctissimorum, or heel-pieced with a long Latin termination. Think how Goldsmithius, or Gubblegurchius, or some such sound, as rough as a 33"], [20, "MEMOIR OF THE AUTHOR. XIV nutmeg-grater, will become me ? Think of that !\u2014 God s curse. Sir ! who am I ? I must own my ill-natured contemporaries have not hitherto paid me those honours I have had such just reason to expect. I have not yet seen my face reflected in all the lively display of red and white paint on any sign-posts in the suburbs. Your handkerchief-weavers seem as yet unacquainted with my merits or physiognomy, and the very snuff-box makers appear to have forgot their respect. Tell them all from me, they are a set of Gothic, barbarous, ignorant scoundrels. There will come a day, no doubt it will\u2014 I beg you may hve a couple of hundred years longer only to see the day\u2014 when the Scaligers and Daciers will vindicate my\u00b0character, give learned editions of my labours, and bless the times with copious comments on the text. You shall see how they will fish up the heavv scoundrels who disregard me now, or will then offer to cavil at my productions. How will they bewail the times that suffered so much genius to lie neglected ! . . . . Let me stop my fancy to take a view of my future self; and, as the boys say, 'light down to see myself on horseback. Well, now I am down, where the d 1 is I? Oh ! Gods ! Gods ! here in a garret, writing for bread, and expecting to be dunned for a milk score !\" The melancholy conclusion of this was not overcharged. Goldsmith was then living in a miserable house in Green Arbour Court, between the Old Bailey and what is now Farringdon Street. Bishop Percy who visited him there has described his condition and abode. \" He was employed in wTiting his 'Enquiry into the present state of Taste and Literature in Europe,' in a wretchedly dirty room, in which there was but one chair, and when, from civility this was offered to his visitant, he himself was obliged to sit in the window. While they were conversing some one gently rapped at the door, and on being desired to come in, a poor ragged little girl of very decent behaviour entered, who dropping a curtesy, said ' My mamma sends her compliments, and begs the favour of you to lend her a chamber-pot full of coals.' \" Other accounts correspond with the Bishop's ; yet neither poverty nor hopelessness could breed in him a feeling of misanthropy. His good-humour, his sociality, his benevolence were undiminished. He still petted the children of his humble neigh bours, gave them cakes and SAveetmeats, and coaxed them to dance to the music of his cheerful flute ; and, little as he had to spare for the necessities of others, he contrived occasionally to alleviate the distresses of those who, in his eyes, had more wretchedness and less resources than himself. The landlord of the house in which he lodged, having fallen into difficulties, was arrested. Goldsmith owed a small sum for rent, and being applied to by the wife of the prisoner to assist in releasing her husband, he at once sent a new suit of clothes to the pawnbroker, and ap plied the whole proceeds \u2014 more than sufficient to discharge his own debt \u2014 towards liquidating the demand of the bailiff. It is believed to have been on account of this identical suit of clothes, obtained on the security of the inexorable bookseller and reviewer, Griffiths, that the latter and Gold smith quarrelled, and closed their connexion. Griffiths had become bound for him to the tailor, on condition that the clothes should be paid for by a certain date, or returned ; and neither of the stipulations having"], [21, "MEMOIR OF THE AUTHOR XV been fulfilled, the hapless creditor was branded as dishonest, and threatened with the utmost severity of the law. The reply of the poor author to his heartless accuser exhibits the despair to which he was driven by the treat ment he experienced. \" I know of no misery,\" he says, \" but a gaol, to which my own imprudencies and your letter seem to point. I have seen it inevitable these three or four weeks, and, by heavens ! request it as a favour\u2014 as a favour that may prevent somewhat more fatal. I have been some years struggling with a wretched being\u2014 with all that contempt that iudigence brings with it \u2014 with all those strong passions which make contempt insupportable. What then has a gaol that is formidable ? I shall at least have the society of wretches, and such is, to me, true society Had I been a sharper, had I been possessed of less good nature and native generosity, I might surely now have been in better circumstances.\" The debt, it scarcely need be added, was subsequently paid \u2014 dearly paid by literary labour : but there was no renewal of inter course between Goldsmith and Griffiths. The two men, it is evident, could never have understood each other. Griffiths was a mere money grubber, and the authors in whom he dealt were regarded by him but as butchers regard their calves \u2014 with a keen eye to what they would fetch, on the instant, across the counter. Even this incident, deeply as it affected the poet at the moment, failed to sour his temper or disposition. He made a number of half-resolutions to be more prudent for the future ; but, even while framing them, he knew that their observance was not in Iris nature. He thus alludes to the subject in a strain of delicate jest, wound up with the gentlest and most unaffected pathos, in a letter to his cousin Mrs. Lauder : \u2014 \" I have already given my landlady orders for an entire reform in the state of my finances. I declaim against hot suppers, drink less sugar in my tea, and check my grate with brick-bats. Instead of hanging my room with pictures, I intend to adorn it with maxims of frugality. Those will make pretty furniture enough, and won't be a bit too expensive ; for I shall draw them all out with my own hands, and my landlady's daughter shall frame them with the parings of my black waistcoat. Each maxim is to be inscribed on a sheet of clean paper, and wrote with my best pen ; of which the following will serve as a specimen: \u2014 'Look sharp;' 'Mind the main chance ;' ' Money is money now ;' ' If you have a thousand pounds, you can put your hands by your sides, and say you are worth a thousand pounds every day of the year;' ' Take a farthing from a hundred and it will be a hundred no longer.' Thus, which way soever I turn my eyes, they are sure to meet one of those friendly monitors ; and as we are told of an actor who hung his room round with looking-glass to correct the defects of his person, my apartment shall be furnished in a peculiar manner, to correct the errors of my mind. \" Faith ! Madam, I heartily wish to be rich, if it were only for this reason \u2014 to say, without a blush, how much I esteem you ; but alas, I have many a fatigue to encounter before that happy time comes, when your poor old simple friend may again give a loose to the luxuriance of his nature, sitting by Kilmore fireside, recount the various adventures of a hard-fought life, laugh over the follies of the day, join his flute to your"], [22, "XVI MEMOIR OF THE AUTHOR. harpsicord, and forget that ever he starved in those streets where Butler and Otway starved before him.\" The asperities of literary life, indeed, seem at last to have worn out his patience, and he made an effort to obtain a better provision for his wants. Through the uniform kindness of the Milner family he procured an appointment, in his medical capacity, under the East India Company ; but on presenting himself at the College of Surgeons to pass the required examination to qualify him for his post, he was rejeeted. \" Accident, or something akin to accident,\" says his biographer, Mr. Prior, \" did for him what it has done for others of our eminent men, who had determined to proceed abroad in pursuit of wealth, \u2014 it kept him at home to acquire fame ; and, as in the instances of Burke and Burns, to elevate the literature of our country.\" He was doomed, that is, to drudge through many tedious years, instructing and amusing mankind for barren applause, and to haA-e his end hastened by mental anxieties occasioned by debts and duns. Fame, however it may sound, is one of the most illusory of all objects of pursuit. No man can be sure that it will be vouchsafed to him by posterity, which can alone award it ; and present want sadly dims its lustre in the prospect. Goldsmith was sustained in his struggle after the phantom, by his genial love of humanity, his capacity to see a bright side in every thing, and to extract pleasure from the most unpromising materials. He had nothing morbid in his constitution ; and, loA-ing literature for its OAvn sake, he was content to live and labour to prolong the pleasures of mere exist ence ; while, for the rest, he was an inveterate hoper. That sickness of heart and despondency occasionally preyed on his spirits may well be conceived ; and that the privations to Avhich he was subjected did their work on his frame is certain. In a letter to his brother Henry, written in February, 1759, the following passages occur : \" It gives me some pain to think I am almost beginning the world at the age of thirty-one. Though I never had a day's sickness since I saw you, yet I am not that strong active man you once knew me. You scarcely can conceive how much eight years of disappointment, anguish, and study have worn me down. If I remember right, you are seven or eight years older than me, yet I dare venture to say that, if a stranger saw us \"both, he would pay me the honours of seniority. Imagine to yourself a pale, melancholy visage, Avith two great wrinkles between the eyebrows, with an eye dis gustingly severe, and a big wig ; and you may have a perfect picture of my present appearance. On the other hand, I conceive you as perfectly sleek and healthy, passing many a happy day among your own children, or those who knew you a child. \" Since I knew what it was to be a man, this is a pleasure I have not known. I have passed my days among a parcel of cool designing beino-s, and have contracted all their suspicious manner in my own behaviour. I should actually be as unfit for the society of my friends at home, as I detest that which I am obliged to partake of here. I can now neither partake of the pleasure of a revel, nor contribute to raise its jollity. I can neither laugh nor drink; have contracted a hesitating, disagreeable manner of speaking, and a visage that looks ill-nature itself. In short, 1 have thought myself into a settled melancholy, and an utter disgust of all that life brings \"with it.\""], [23, "MEMOIR OF THE AUTHOR. XVII Calmer and better days soon followed. He became known to the Dodsleys, to Mr. Hamilton, proprietor of the Critical Review, to Dr Smollett, and finally to Mr. Newbery, \"the philanthropic bookseller of St. Paul's Churchyard, who has written so many little books for children, who found and relieved the ' Vicar of Wakefield,' at the roadside inn, and who, through life, was Goldsmith's best patron. While these friendships were ripening, however, he was at work extending his reputation and in fluence by writing ' The Bee,' a short series of periodical papers in the manner of the ' Spectator,' and contributing to ' The Busy Body,' and 'The Lady's Magazine.' It was the merit of 'The Bee' in all probability that led Newbery to seek his assistance in a new paper of his, 'The Public Ledger,' commenced in January, 1 760. This was enriched with ' The Chinese Letters,' since so universally known under the title of the ' Citizen of the World,' which had sufficient popularity to be pirated during their progress through the press, and which, immediately on their completion, were reprinted and took their stand among the English Classics. These several works procured their author a somewhat better income than he had at any previous time enjoyed ; and he accordingly removed from Green Arbour Court, to Wine-Office Court, Fleet Street, where he enlarged at once his establishment and his list of friends. He still worked hard, however, without growing rich, or even acquiring the means of com fort ; and still, though known to be capable of the highest literary achievements, he was condemned to flounder on amid the lowest \u2014 now penning a newspaper criticism, a puff, or a preface, or tagging a new close to an old work. Among other things which he did at that time, was ' A pamphlet respecting the Cock Lane Ghost ' for three guineas ; a ' History of Mecklenburgh, from the first settling there of the Vandals ;' an ' Abridgment of Plutarch's Lives,' for twelve, and a 'Life of Beau Nash,' for fourteen, guineas. The rate of remuneration which he was accustomed to receive is ascertainable from the last mentioned work, which consists of not less than 240, 8vo. pages, the composition of which employed him for five weeks. The whole produce of the year was about fourteen volumes \u2014 the pay less than one hundred and twenty pounds. Gold smith has been accused of want of industry and want of economy. With these facts before him, the reader will require no formal refutation of such absurd and twaddling calumnies. It will be rightly judged from this that the upward career of Oliver was scarcely less chequered than his outset in hfe. Although mixing with men of the highest mark, his means were still of the humblest ; and poverty is sure to bring adventures, \u2014 grave or ludicrous as they may be but always disagreeable, and not unfrequently painful, to their hero. In 1762, in consequence probably of his incessant labour, we find the health of Goldsmith so impaired that for several weeks he was compelled to keep his chamber, and to abstain, for a period, from writing ; and at the end of that year he took lodgings at Islington, in order partly to be near the residence of Newbery, who hved at Canonbury House, and partly for the benefit of country air. It was here that he wrote, to say nothing of minor and forgotten things, thrust upon him by the hard"], [24, "XVIII MEMOIR OF THE AUTHOR. necessities of the moment, one of his most popular works, ' The History of England in a series of Letters from a Nobleman to his Son,' which was attributed by some to the Earl of Chesterfield, by others to the Earl of Orrery, and \"finally they settled down in pubhc estimation as being the property of Lord \" Lyttleton ;\u2014 a name which they retain in booksellers' catalogues to the present day. There is reason to believe that the putative author was pleased to be deemed the writer of so elegant and useful a work ; and Goldsmith, although known among his friends to have produced the book, took no pains to set the general reader right in a matter which might have given offence to one who, it is said, promised, but forgot, to patronize and befriend him. The success of the work exceeded all expectation. New editions were called for continually, and still the book is read with delight and instruction, and has been recom mended by no less an authority than Sir Walter Scott, in one of his intro ductions to the 'Tales of a Grandfather,' as the best compendium of English History extant. Goldsmith, it is beheved, received for the two volumes, of which the work consists, about -\u00a350 ! It was at Islington also, according to contemporary accounts, that he wrote his 'Vicar of Wakefield,' the first work which he composed without its being previously ordered, or at least bargained for, by a publisher. There is a story connected with the completion and sale of this delightful book Avhich must not be omitted. It was related by Dr. Johnson to Bos- Avell, who has thus recorded it : \"I received one morning,\" said Johnson \" a message from poor Goldsmith that he was in great distress, and as it Avas not in his power to come to me, begging that I would come to him as soon as possible. I sent him a guinea, and promised to come to him directly. I accordingly went as soon as I was dressed, and found that his landlady had arrested him for his rent, at which he was in a violent passion. I perceived he had already changed my guinea, and had got a bottle of Madeira and a glass before him. I put the cork into the bottle, desired he would be calm, and began to talk to him of the means by which he might be extricated. He then told me he had a novel ready for the press, which he produced to me. I looked into it, and saw its merit ; told the landlady I should soon return, and, having gone to a bookseller, sold it for sixty pounds. I brought Goldsmith the money, and he dis charged his rent, not without rating his landlady in a high tone for having used him so ill.\" Cumberland has added to this anecdote a piece of Romance \u2014 related afterwards, perhaps as a jest, among the poet's friends, but certainly not founded on fact\u2014 that the landlady, while the bailiffs were waiting without, had proposed to her lodger the startling alternative of instant payment or marriage ! Francis Newbery \u2014 not the poet's friend\u2014 was the purchaser of 'The Vicar,' but although, on the recommendation of Johnson, he had consented to give a higher price than was usually paid for the works of the same author, he thought so indifferently of his bargain that he kept it by him unpublished for two years, till the success of the ' Traveller ' had placed the name of the writer in the very highest rank of Literature. The ' Traveller ' was published in December, 1 764, and was everywhere read and everywhere praised. Johnson spoke highly of it in public and"], [25, "MEMOIR OF THE AUTHOR. XIX private, and quoted it in his writings and in society. It was said to be \" without one bad line \u2014 without one of Dryden' s careless verses.\" Burke, Fox, Reynolds \u2014 all the Reviewers, and all men of taste and literature conspired to applaud it as \"one of the finest poems in the English lan guage.\" But Goldsmith was not to be permitted to step thus easily upon the pedestal of fame. Though nobody could dispute the merit of the poem, certain critics who, from his easy good-nature and simplicity, had long considered themselves entitled to laugh and sneer at \"poor Goldy,\" now disputed the paternity of his work, and declared that the finest passages of 'The Traveller' had been written by Johnson; \u2014 an imputation which the Doctor's disavowal failed for some time to remove. Johnson is known to have revised the poem for press, and to have rewritten nine lines of it ; but beyond this he had no share in its design or construction. In eight months ' The TraA-eller ' went through four editions ; and five more were subsequently published during the life of the author, who profited by its production and popularity to the extent of twenty-one pounds sterling ! The sensation produced by the poem, led to an invitation from the Earl of Northumberland, who seems to have been inclined to render him assistance. The account of his interview is thus related by Sir John Hawkins ; who, having been with the Earl on business, waited to accom pany his friend home : \"Upon his coming out,\" says Sir John, \"I asked him the result of his conversation. ' His Lordship,' says he, ' told me he had read my poem, and was much delighted with it ; that he was going out as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and that hearing I was a native of that countrv he should be glad to do me any kindness.' 'And what did you answer,' asked I, ' to this gracious offer ?' ' Why,' said he, ' I could say nothing, but that I had a brother there, a clergyman, who stood in need of help. As for myself, I have no dependance on the promises of great men ; I look to the booksellers for support ; they are my best friends, and I am not inclined to forsake them for others.' Thus,\" adds the brutal knight, \"did this idiot in the affairs of the world trifle with his fortunes, and put back the hand that was held out to assist him ! \" Goldsmith having been, on an after occasion, subjected to a similar charge of idiocy in the affairs of the world, was so absurd as to say, \" I can earn as much as will supply my wants, without writing for party ; assistance therefore is unneces sary to me.\" This was the secret of his indifference to the offer of the Lord Lieutenant. One Robert Burns, whom Sir John Hawkins would also have treated as an idiot, has left on record a sentiment similar to that of Goldsmith : \u2014 \" I was bred to the plough, and am independant.\" These men \u2014 to whom must be added one Andrew Marvel \u2014 were content with an honestly-earned, though homely, subsistence, and left to the seekers after wealth, and ribbons, and titles, like Sir John Hawkins, the office of pander to the fortuitously great. Goldsmith continued to write for bread, and preserved his integrity. But, though he did not care to aA-ail himself of his reputation to acquire political patronage, he enjoyed considerable advantage from it in the in creased estimation in which he was held among booksellers. In June, 1765, his admirable 'Essays' were published. Ln March, 1766, appeared"], [26, "MEMOIR OF THE AUTHOR. XX the 'Vicar'\u2014 the interval between the publication of these being filled with anonymous articles for Magazines and Reviews ; with translations from the French, and Historical, and Scientific compdations. The revenue brought him by these labours, enabled him to take and furnish chambers in the Temple, first at No. 2, Garden Court, and subsequently at No. 2, Brick Court, which last he continued to occupy till his death. In the beginning of 1767 he completed his first Comedy 'The Good- Natured Man,' which, after being shelfed for some months by Garrick, was brought upon the stage in January, 1768, at Covent Garden, and was eminently successful, being played twelve nights during the season \u2014 ten of the performances succeeding each other nightly. The profits are believed to have been from .\u00a3350 to -\u00a3400, besides what he derived from sale of the copyright, which, from the fact that four editions were sold off within a month, is likely to have been considerable. His habits at this period appear to have been unchanged. He lodged during a part of the summer of 1767 in the old turret of Canonbury House, where he had several authors of different degrees of eminence as fellow-residents, who were accustomed to spend their evenings toge ther at the Crown Tavern, in the Lower-road, Islington. A 'shoemaker's holiday,' as he termed it, was a favourite recreation. Lee Lewes, in his Memoirs, has described one of these festive days. He had called upon the poet one morning and found him working at the 'Deserted Village,' After reading what he had written, Goldsmith observed : \u2014 \" Come, let me tell you this is no bad morning's work ; and now, my dear boy, if you are not better engaged, I should be glad to enjoy a shoemaker's hohday with you.\" The day was commonly spent thus : \u2014 \" Four or five friends assembled at his apartments to a remarkably plentiful and rather expensive breakfast ; and when finished, he had usually some poor women in attendance, to whom the fragments were consigned. On one occasion a wealthy city acquaintance, not remarkable for elegance of mind or manners, who observed this liberality, said with some degree of freedom, ' Why Doctor, you must be a rich man ; / cannot afford to do this.' ' It is not wealth, my dear Sir,' was the reply of the Doctor, willing to rebuke, without offending his guest, ' but inclination. I have only to suppose that a few more friends than usual have been of our party, and then it amounts to the same thing.' \" About eleven o'clock the party proceeded to Blackheath, Highgate, Hampstead, Wandsworth, or some other suburban village or hamlet to dine, returned to some place of popular resort nearer town, such as the White Conduit Gardens, to tea, and concluded by spending the evening at the Grecian, Temple, or Exchange Coffee House, at the Globe, Fleet Street, or the Crown, Islington. In February, 1/69, Goldsmith commenced his 'History of Animated Nature,' one of the most profitable of his hterary undertakings. In May, -jf the same year, his ' Roman History ' was published, and in June he entered into an engagement to write a 'History of England.' In De cember he was elected Professor of Ancient History to the newly esta blished Royal Academy of Arts\u2014 a situation to which no salary was annexed, and which he accepted, he says, \" rather as a compliment to the Institution, than any benefit to himself: \u2014 Honours to one, in his situation,"], [27, "MEMOIR OF THE AUTHOR. XXI being something like ruffles to one that Avants a shirt.\" In May, 1770, appeared ' The Deserted Village,' of which five editions were sold in less than three months ; in June, was published his ' Life of Parnell,' pre fixed to an edition of that poet's works; and in December his 'Life of Bolingbroke ' appeared. His comedy, ' She Stoops to Conquer,' although completed some time before, was not played till the 15th of March, 1773, when, contrary to the expectation of all his friends, it was received with the most unqualified approbation, and six thousand copies of it were speedily sold, when published. In June, 1773, his 'History of Greece' was published. This, with the exception of a few minor pieces of prose and verse, some new editions of his former works, and the publication of the 'History of the Earth and Animated Nature,' was the poet's last labour. Pecuniary embarrassments, over exertion, and mental disquietude, from various causes, had affected his health ; and he gradually sank into despondency. Fever ensued, and on the morning ofthe 4th of April, 1774, he expired at his chambers in the Temple, at the age of forty-five. The last years of Goldsmith's life had been passed iin comparative com fort, among friends who esteemed aud could apprec ate him. He occa sionally made excursions into the country \u2014 to Derbyshire, Hampshire, Sussex, Suffolk, Yorkshire, Leicester and Lincoln ; and once he proceeded with some friends, for a few weeks, as far as Paris. One of his favourite places of retirement was a farm-house, near the Aillage of Hyde, on the Edgeware-road, about six miles from London. His mode of life in this pleasant seclusion has been related by the son of the occupier at the time Oliver was a frequent inmate. \"The poet boarded with the family, but usually had his meals sent to his own apartment, where his time was chiefly spent in writing. Occasionally he wandered into the kitchen, took his stand with his back towards the fire, apparently absorbed in thought, till something seeming to occur to his mind, he would hurry off to commit it, as was supposed, to paper. Sometimes he strolled about the fields, or was seen loitering or musing under the hedges, or perusing a book. Frequently he visited town and remained absent many weeks at a time, or paid visits to private friends in other parts of the country. \" In the house he usually wore his shirt collar open, in the manner represented in the portrait by Sir Joshua Reynolds. Occasionally he read much at night when in bed ; at other times, when not disposed to read, and yet unable to sleep, which was not an unusual occurrence, the candle was kept burning ; his mode of extinguishing which when out of his reach was characteristic of his fits of indolence or carelessness \u2014 he flung his slipper at it, which in the morning was in consequence usually found near the overturned candlestick daubed with grease. No application of a charitable description was made to him in vain. Itinerant mendicants he always viewed with compassion, and neA-er failed to give them relief; while his actions generally evinced much goodness of heart and great com miseration for the poorest classes of society. . . . On one occasion he took the young people of the house to Hendon in a carriage, to see a company of strolling players ; and proved not only very jocular on the road, but in his comments on the performance, which afforded all the party, and more particularly himself, by the laughter in which he indulged infinite amusement.\" 34"], [28, "MEMOIR OF THE AUTHOR. XXII Of the pleasure which he derived from the society of children\u2014 no bad test of the disposition of the man \u2014 many anecdotes are related. In all the diversions of such companions he took such interest as to become rather a leader than a mere participator. He joined readily and heartily in blind-man's buff, romping, forfeits, or trivial games at cards, in which by affecting to cheat, or shewing an eagerness to win, he rendered his playmates exceedingly boisterous and mirthful. George Colman, the Dramatist, has related a pleasant story of his introduction, when a child, to our author. Goldsmith took the boy on his knee and h^gan playing with him ; but his familiarity was recompensed with a smart slap on the face from the urchin caressed.' The elder Colman inflicted summary justice on his peevish son for the outrage, by locking him up in the dark in an adjoining room. George howled and screamed at the top of his lungs, till at length a friend appeared to liberate him \u2014 the tender-hearted Doctor, whom he had so wantonly molested \u2014 with a smile on his coun tenance, still red from the violence of assault. \" I sulked and sobbed,\" says the narrator, \"and he fondled and soothed, till I began to brighten; when seizing the propitious moment of returning good-humour, he put down the candle and began to conjure. He placed three hats, which happened to be in the room, upon the carpet, and a shilling under each. The shillings he told me were England, France, and Spain. ' Hey, presto, cockolorum ! ' cried the Doctor, and lo ! on uncovering the shillings which had been dispersed, each beneath a seperate hat, they were all found con gregated under one. I was no politician at the time, and therefore might not have wondered at the sudden revolution which brought England, France, and Spain all under one crown ; but as I was also no conjurer, it amazed me beyond measure.\" Thenceforward Goldsmith and young Col man Avere always cordial friends and merry playfellows. Northcote, the Bio grapher of Reynolds, has expressed himself to the same effect. \"When Goldsmith entered a room, Sir,\" said he, \"people who did not know him became for a moment silent from awe of his literary reputation ; when he came out again, they were riding upon his back.\" The venerable Irish Judge Day, who, in 1831, retained a distinct recollection of his illustrious countryman, thus describes his person and manners : \u2014 \"He Avas short, about five feet five or six inches; strong but not heavy in make ; rather fair in complexion, with brown hair, such at least as could be distinguished from his wig. His features were plain but not repulsive, certainly not so when lighted up by conversation. His man ners were simple, natural, and perhaps on the whole, we may not say polished\u2014 at least without that refinement and good-breeding which the exquisite polish of his compositions would lead us to expect. He was always cheerful and animated, often indeed boisterous in his mirth ; entered with spirit into convivial society ; contributed largely to its enjoyments by solid information, and the naivete and originality of his character ; talked often Avithout premeditation, and laughed loudly without restraint. . . . He was fond of exhibiting his muscular httle person in the gayest apparel of the day, to which Avas added a bag wig and a sword.\" Testimonials as to the moral worth of Goldsmith, both as a man of literature and of the world, are abundant. Johnson wept over him; Burke burst into tears on hearing of hi= death, and Sir Joshua Reynolds"], [29, "MEMOIR OF THE AUTHOR. XXIII abstained, for a space, from the use of his brush. The folloAving summary of his character is said to have proceeded from the pen of Burke : \u2014 \" In an age when genius and learning are too generally sacrificed to the purposes of ambition and avarice, it is the consolation of virtue as well as of its friends, that they can commemorate the name of Goldsmith as a shining example to the contrary. \" Early compelled, hke some of our greatest men, into the service of the muses, he never once permitted his necessities to have the least im proper influence on his conduct ; but, knowing and respecting the honour able line of his profession, he made no farther use of fiction than to set off the dignity of truth ; and in this he succeeded so happily that his writings stamp no less the man of genius than the universal friend of mankind. Such is the outline of his poetical character, which perhaps will be remembered whilst the first-rate poets of the country have any monument left them. But alas ! his noble and immortal part \u2014 the good man \u2014 is only consigned to the short-lived memory of those who are left to lament his death. \" Having naturally a powerful bias on his mind to the cause of virtue, he was cheerful and indefatigable in the pursuit of it ; warm in his friend ships, gentle in his manners, and in every act of charity and benevolence ' the very milk of human kindness.' Nay, even his foibles and little weaknesses of temper may be said rather to shew the simplicity of his nature than to degrade his understanding ; for, though there may be many instances to prove that he was no man of the Avorld, most of these in stances would attest the unadulterated purity of his heart.\" After the instances of his benevolence, which have been cited concerning his early life, little need be said of his later acts of kindness. DaA-ies, one of his publishers, and the Biographer of Garrick, says, \" His disposition of mind was tender, and compassionate. No unhappy person ever sued to him for relief Avithout obtaining it if he had anything to give ; and rather than not relieve the distressed he would borrow. The poor woman with whom he had lodged during his obscurity several years in Green Arbour Court, by his death lost an excellent friend ; for the Doctor often supplied her with food from his table, and visited her frequently with the sole pur pose of being kind to her He was so sincere a man that he could not conceal what was uppermost in his mind. So far from desiring to appear in the eye of the world to the best advantage, he took more pains to appear worse than he was, than others do to appear better than they are.\" His invariable kindness and good-nature caused him to be frequently duped by sharpers, and victimised by the indolent and un worthy ; but even the detection of such frauds upon him did not check the stream of charity which was always welling from his heart. He had no gloomy suspicions of the rascality of mankind to close the portal of his affections \u2014 no remembered impositions of his own to narrow his soul. Guileless himself, he believed all men to be full of natural goodness ; and when he found evil in their deeds, he was willing to ascribe it to perverse circumstances, rather than an inherent propensity to vice, and to trust them again, in the hope of their repentance and amendment."], [30, "XXIV MEMOIR OF THE AUTHOR. Ot nis eccentricities many anecdotes have been preserved by his con temporaries. Some of them, however, evidently sprung from his sen sitiveness\u2014his horror of being-thought harsh to others, of witnessing dis tress, or being made in his own person the subject of ridicule. Others proceeded from his poverty. He could not always in purse or appearance keep pace with his wealthier associates, and, unwilling to have his true circumstances known, he sometimes affected singularity to escape the imputation of being needy. Besides, he was a bachelor, and had mixed with all kinds of society, at home and abroad, to such an extent that he must, in a great measure, have despised the genteel conventionalities of those who expected to find in him a pattern of silver-fork elegance. One anecdote of a species of eccentricity in which he is likely to find few imitators, is worth remembering. \" He had more than once offered the use of his purse to a friend named Cooke (a young barrister of the Temple), which Avas at last accepted \u2014 the temptation of an evening at Marylebone, or Ranelagh Gardens, with several companions, being irresis tible ; although at the moment destitute of funds for the occasion. On applying to the Poet, however, he was told very seriously, and no doubt truly, that he had not a guinea in his possession. This being con sidered an evasion, something like a reproach escaped the applicant, that he regretted having made such a request, where, notwithstanding voluntary offers of assistance, there existed so little disposition to afford it. Nettled by the remark, Goldsmith, as evidence of his desire to oblige, borrowed the money. In the mean time Cooke, provided from another quarter, had locked his chambers, and proceeded to his amusement ; but returning at an early hour in the morning, found a difficulty in opening the door, which on examination proved to arise from the sum he had requested, in silver, being wrapped in paper and thrustunderneath. On being thanked for this proof of sincerity on the following day, but told that the money might as readily have fallen into strange hands as of him for whom it was meant, he characteristically replied, ' In truth, my dear fellow, I did not think of that.' \" Boswell, the Biographer of Johnson, and some others, have charged him with envy. Mr. Prior has very judiciously disposed of this accusation. Instead of envy, the rivalry Avhich he exhibited should have been called emulation. \"He was willing to believe he could do whatever he saw done by another. On his first entering into literary hfe, he found the attention of the reading part of the people fixed upon\" the Essays of John son, and thence he became an Essavist. The novels of Smollet were universally read, and he aimed to be\" a Novelist. Gray, Mason, Arm strong, Akenside and others claimed the honours of poetry, :.nd he aspired to be a Poet. Hume, Smollet, and Robertson, having acquired hio-h re putation in history, he desired to be a Historian ; and dramatic writers were so numerous and many so fortunate, that, believing his own powers not inferior to theirs, he became a successful Dramatist. To call honest ambition of this kind envy, is an obvious misapplication of language.\" As a poet all that he has written has been pronounced good by Lord Byron, while in the passage which contains this judgment, his Lordship says that not one half is good of the \u00c6neid, of Milton or of Dryden"], [31, "MEMOIR OF THE AUTHOR. XXV Campbell, the author ofthe 'Pleasures of Hope' says that \"Goldsmith's poetry presents a distinct and unbroken view of poetical delightfulness. His descriptions and sentiments have the purest zest of nature. He is refined without false delicacy, and correct without insipidity He unbends from graver strains of reflection to tenderness, and even to playfulness, with an ease and grace almost exclusively his own ; and con nects extensive views of the happiness and interests of society with pictures of life that touch the heart by their familiarity.\" As a writer of prose, Dr. Anderson in his 'British Poets' says \"Gold smith must be allowed to have rivalled and even exceeded Dr. Johnson and his imitator Dr. Hawksworth, the most celebrated professional prose writer of his lime. His prose maybe regarded as the model of perfection, and the stand vd of our language ; to equal which the efforts of most will be vain, and, to exceed it, every expectation folly.\" Johnson, according to Boswell, said of his friend, \" Whether we take him as a poet, as a comic writer, or as a Historian, he stands in the first class. He has the art of saying everything he has to say in a pleasing manner.\" In his works the Doctor has pronounced him to be, \"A man of such variety of powers, and such fehcity of performance that he always seemed to do best that which he was doing ; a man who had the art of being minute withont tediousness, and general without confusion ; whose language was copious without exhuberancej exact without constraint, and easy without weakness.\" \u2014 \"He was,\" said Johnson emphatically, on another occasion, \"a very great man. Every year he hved he would have deserved Westminster Abbey the more !\" Sir Walter Scott has added his tribute to the throng. \" The wreath of Goldsmith,\" he says, \" is unsullied. He wrote to exalt virtue and expose Vice ; and he accomplished his task in a manner which raises him to the highest rank among British authors. We close his volume [The Vicar of Wakefield] with a sigh that such an author should have written so httle from the stores of his own genius, and that he should have been so prematurely removed from the sphere of literature which he so highly adorned.\" To these ample praises it is unnecessary to make any addition. It may however be interesting to the reader to be informed that, both in his poetry and prose, Goldsmith usually drew from nature, not only in the common acceptation of the phrase, but literally and in fact. ' The Traveller ' in his poem of that name was himself, and the sentiments and feelings contained in the work are undoubtedly his own, founded on personal observation, during his peregrinations on the Continent. In his ' Deserted Village' \u2014 Lissoy is the village of Auburn. \"The sheltered cot, the cultivated farm, The never-failing brook, the busy mill, The decent church that topped the neighbouring hill, The hawthorn bush, with seats beneath the shade, For talking age and whispering lovers made!\" This is a true picture of the actual scene. And not less true is that o the village preacher, \"passing rich Avith forty pounds a year,\" his modest mansion and its hospitality. The depopulation of Auburn also"], [32, "MEMOIR OF THE AUTHOR. XXVI appears not to have been an imaginary circumstance. General Naper, it is said, on his return -with a great fortune from Spain, purchased a large estate at Lissov, and, in order to create an extensive park, ejected most of the inhabitants of the village, and pulled down their cottages. In like manner he drew upon his recollection for the Primrose family in the 'Vicar of Wakefield.' The pastor was his father. His own adventures are related in those of George Primrose ; the private marriages of two of his own sisters, which gave some uneasiness to their parents, are supposed to have supplied the incident of Olivia's elopement, and the name of Burchell was that of one of his connexions by marriage. The adventure which gave rise to ' She stoops to Conquer' has been already related. Goldsmith was buried in the Temple burial ground on the evening of Saturday the 9th of April. It had been proposed to give him a public funeral in Westminster Abbey ; but when it was ascertained that he had died considerably in debt, this design was abandoned, and a subscription entered into among his friends to erect there a monument to his memory. This was fulfilled. Nollekins executed a medallion likeness of the poet, and Johnson added a latin epitaph, from which the following is translated : \u2014 \"0lia7er Goldsmith, Poet, Natural Philosopher, Historian, who left no species of writing untouched, or unadorned by his pen ; whether to move laughter or draw tears, he was a powerful yet gentle master over the affections : of a genius sublime, lively and versatile ; in expression noble, pure and elegant. His memory will last while Society retains affection, Friendship is not void of truth, and Reading is held in esteem.\" A word only need be added. Goldsmith throughout his life worked and studied hard ; and owed to his perseverance and the artistical skill which he acquired thereby, not less than to his genius, the graces of his inimi- table style, and hence no small share of his reputation. His personal peculiarities, how characteristic soever of the man, had no part in raising him to the eminence he attained ; but his moral rectitude, purity of heart, and superiority to those meannesses which, in the estimation of many, would have seemed venial in his circumstances, added to a courage and endurance which enabled him to overlook and surmount the most formi- dable obstacles, rendered him great, in spite of his peculiarities. This view \u2014 especially in perusing the biography of a favourite poet, who has passed on to Fame through the ordeal of poverty \u2014 is apt to be overlooked by young readers and young writers ; and some mischief has resulted to both classes in consequence. To omit all consideration of so essential a circumstance here, would be absolute injustice to the name and unques tionable merits of"], [33, ""], [34, ""], [35, "CHAPTER I THE DESCRIPTION OF THE FAMILY OF WAKEFIELD, IN WHICH A KINDRED LIKENESS PREVAILS, AS AVELL OF MINDS AS OF PERSONS. was ever of opinion, that the honest man who married and brought up a large family, did more service than he who continued single and only talked of population. From this motive, I had scarcely taken orders a year before I began to think seriously of matri- mony, and chose my wife, as she did her wedding-gown, not for a fine glossy surface, but for such qualities as would wear well. To do her justice, she was a good-natured, notable woman ; and as for breeding, there were few country ladies who could shew more. She could read any English book without much spelling ; but for pickling, pre serving, and cookery, none could excel her. She prided her self also upon being an excellent contriver in housekeeping ? though I could never find that we grevv richer with all her contrivances."], [36, "4 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. However, we loved each other tenderly, and our fondness increased as we grew old. There was, in fact, nothing that could make us angry with the world or each other. We had an elegant house, situated in a fine country, and a good neighbourhood. The year was spent in moral or rural amuse- meats, in visiting our rich neighbours, and relieving such as were poor. We had no revolutions to fear, nor fatigues to undergo ; all our adventures were by the fire-side, and all our migrations from the blue bed to the brown. As we lived near the road, we often had the traveller or stranger visit us to taste our gooseberry Avine, for which we had great reputation ; and I profess, Avith the veracity of an historian, that I never knew one of them find fault with it. Our cousins, too, even to the fortieth remove, all remembered their affinity, without any help from the herald's office, and came very frequently to see us. Some of them did us no great honour by these claims of kindred ; as Ave had the blind, the maimed, and the halt, amongst the number. However, my wife always insisted, that as they were the same fiesh and blood, they should sit with us at the same table. So that if Ave had not very rich, we generally had very happy, friends about us ; for this remark will hold good through life, that the poorer the guest, the better pleased he ever is Avith being treated : and as some men gaze with admiration at the colours of the tulip, or the Avings of a butterfly, so I was, by nature, an admirer of happy human faces. HoAvever, when any one of"], [37, "5 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. our relations was found to be a person of very bad character, a troublesome guest, or one we desired to get rid of, upon his leaving my house, I ever took care to lend him a riding-coat, or a pair of boots, or sometimes a horse of small value, and I always had the satisfaction of finding he never came back to return them. By this the house was cleared of such as we did not like ; but never was the family of Wakefield known to turn the traveller or the poor dependent out of doors. Thus we lived several years in a state of much happiness, not that but Ave sometimes had those little rubs which Provi dence sends to enhance the value of its favours. My orchard was often robbed by schoolboys, and my wife's custards plun dered by the cats or the children. The squire would some times fall asleep in the most pathetic parts of my sermon, or his lady return my wife's civilities at church with a mutilated curtsey. But we soon got over the uneasiness caused by such accidents, and usually in three or four days began to wonder how they vexed us. My children, the offspring of temperance, as they were edu cated Avithout softness, so they were at once well formed and healthy ; my sons hardy and active, my daughters beautiful"], [38, "6 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. and blooming. When I stood in the midst of the little circle, which promised to be the supports of my declining age, I could not avoid repeating the famous story of Count Abensbergh, who, in Henry the Second's progress through Germany, while other courtiers came with their treasures, brought his thirty two children, and presented them to his sovereign as the most valuable offering he had to bestoAV. In this manner, though I had but six, I considered them as a very valuable present made to my country, and consequently looked upon it as my debtor. Our eldest son was named George, after his uncle, who left us ten thousand pounds. Our second child, a girl, I intended to call after her aunt Grizzel ; but my wife, who during her pregnancy had been reading romances, insisted upon her being called Olivia. In less than another year Ave had another daughter, and now I Avas determined that Grizzel should be her name ; but a rich relation taking a fancy7 to stand godmother, the girl Avas, by her directions, called Sophia, so that Ave had two romantic names in the family ; but I solemnly protest I had no hand in it. Moses was our next, and after an interval of twelve years, yve had tAvo sons more. It would be fruitless to deny exultation when I saw my little ones about me ; but the vanity and the satisfaction of my Avife were even greater than mine. When our visitors would say, \" Well, upon my word, Mrs. Primrose, you have the finest children in the whole country ;\" \u2014 \" Ay, neighbour,\" she would ansAver, \" they are as heaven made them, handsome enough, if they be good enough ; for handsome is that handsome does.\" And then she Avould bid the girls hold up their heads ; who, to conceal nothing, were certainly very handsome. Mere out-"], [39, "VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. 7 side is so trifling a circumstance with me, that I should scarcely have remembered to mention it, had it not been a general topic of conversation in the country. Olivia, now about eighteen, had that luxuriancy of beauty, with which painters generally draw Hebe \u2014 open, sprightly, and commanding. Sophia's features were not so striking at first, but often did more certain execution ; for they were soft, modest, and allu ring. The one vanquished by a single blow, the other by efforts successively repeated. The temper of a woman is generally formed from the turn"], [40, "8 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. of her features : at least it was so with my daughters. Olivia wished for many lovers ; Sophia to secure one. Olivia was often affected, from too great a desire to please ; Sophia even repressed excellence, from her fears to offend. The one entertained me with her vivacity Avhen I was gay, the other with her sense when I was serious. But these qualities were never carried to excess in either, and I haA7e often seen them exchange characters for a Avhole day together. A suit of mourn- ing has transformed my coquette into a prude, and a new set of ribbons has given her younger sister more than natural vivacity. My eldest son George was bred at Oxford, as I intended him for one of the learned professions. My second boy Moses, whom I designed for business, received a sort of. miscellaneous education at home. But it is needless to attempt describing the particular characters of young people, that had seen but very little of the world. In short, a family likeness prevailed through all, and properly speaking, they had but one character \u2014 that of being all equally generous, credulous, simple, and inoffensive."], [41, "CHAPTER II FAMILY MISFORTUNES.

The profits of my living, which amounted to but thirty-five pounds a-year, I made over to the orphans and widows of the clergy of our diocese ; for, having a fortune of my own, I was careless of temporalities, and felt a secret pleasure in doing my duty without reward. I also set a resolution of keeping no curate, and of being acquainted with every man in the parish, exhorting the married men to temperance, and the bachelors to matrimony ; so that in a feAv years it was a common saying, that there were three strange wants at Wakefield \u2014 a parson wanting pride, young men wanting Avives, and alehouses wanting customers. 2"], [42, "10 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. Matrimony was always one of my favourite topics, and I wrote several sermons to prove its happiness : but there was a peculiar tenet which I made a point of supporting \u2014 for I main tained with Whistoh, that it was unlawful for a priest of the Church of England, after the death of his first wife, to take a second ; or, to express it in one word, I valued myself upon being a strict monogamist. I was early initiated into this important dispute, on which so many laborious volumes have been written. I published some tracts upon the subject myself, which, as they never sold, I have the consolation of thinking were read only by the happy few. Some of my friends called this my weak side ; but, alas ! they had not, like me, made it the subject of long contemplation. The more I reflected upon it, the more impor tant it appeared. I even went a step beyond Whiston in displaying my principles : as he had engraven upon his Avife's tomb that she was the only wife of William Whiston, so I wrote a similar epitaph for my wife, though still living, in which I extolled her prudence, economy, and obedience till death; and haA'ing got it copied fair, with an elegant frame, it was placed over the chimney-piece, where it answered several very useful purposes \u2014 it admonished my wife of her duty to me, and my fidelity to her \u2014 it inspired her with a passion for fame \u2014 and constantly put her in mind of her end. It was thus, perhaps, from hearing marriage so often recom mended, that my eldest son, just upon leaving college, fixed his affections upon the daughter of a neighbouring clergyman, who was a dignitary in the church, and in circumstances to give her a large fortune. But fortune was her smallest accom plishment. Miss Arabella Wilmot was allowed by all (except my two daughters) to be completely pretty. Her youth, health, and innocence, were still heightened by a complexion so transparent, and such a happy sensibility of look, as even age could not gaze on with indifference. As Mr. Wilmot knew that I could make a very handsome settlement on my son, he was not averse to the match ; so both families lived together, in all that harmony Avhich generally precedes an expected"], [43, "11 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. alliance. Being convinced, by experience, that the days of courtship are the most happy of our lives, I was willing enough to lengthen the period ; and the various amusements which the young couple every day shared in each other's com- pany, seemed to increase their passion. We were generally awaked in the morning by music, and on fine days rode a-hunt ing. The hours between breakfast and dinner the ladies devoted to dress and study ; they usually read a page, and then gazed at themselves in the glass, which, even philosophers might own, often presented the page of greatest beauty. At dinner, my wife took the lead ; for, as she always insisted upon carving every thing herself, it being her mother's way, she gave us, upon these occasions, the history of every dish. When we had dined, to prevent the ladies leaving us, I gene-"], [44, "12 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. rally ordered the table to be removed ; and sometimes, with the music-master's assistance, the girls would give us a very agreeable concert. Walking out, drinking tea, country dances, and forfeits, shortened the rest of the day, without the assistance of cards, as I hated all manner of gaming, except back gammon, at which my old friend and I sometimes took a tAvopenny hit. Nor can I here pass over an ominous circum stance that happened the last time we played together : I only wanted to fling a quartre, and yet I threw deuce, ace five times running. Some months were elapsed in this manner, till at last it Avas thought convenient to fix a day for the nuptials of the young couple, Avho seemed earnestly to desire it. During the preparations for the wedding, I need not describe the busy importance of my Avife, nor the sly looks of my daughters. In fact, my attention Avas fixed on another object \u2014 the completing a tract, which I intended shortly to publish, in defence of my favourite principle. As I looked upon this as a masterpiece, both for argument and style, I could not, in the pride of my heart, avoid showing it to my old friend Mr. Wilmot, as I made no doubt of receiving his approbation ; but not till too late I discovered that he was most violently attached to the contrary opinion, and with good reason, for he was at that time actually courting a fourth Avife. This, as may be expected, produced a dispute, attended with some acrimony, Avhich threatened to interrupt our intended alliance ; but, on the day before that appointed for the ceremony, we agreed to discuss the subject at large. It was managed with proper spirit on both sides. He asserted that I Avas heterodox : I retorted the charge : he replied, and I rejoined. In the meantime, while the con troversy was hottest, I Avas called out by one of my relations, who, with a face of concern, advised me to give up the dispute, at least till my son's wedding was over. \" How ! \" cried I, \" relinquish the cause of truth, and let him be a husband, already driven to the very verge of absurdity ? You might as well advise me to give up my fortune as my argument.\" \u2014"], [45, "13 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. \" Your fortune,\" returned my friend, \" I am now sorry to inform you, is almost nothing. The merchant in town, in whose bands your money was lodged, has gone off to avoid a statute of bankruptcy, and is thought not to have left a shilling in the pound. I was unwilling to shock you or the family with the account till after the wedding ; but now it may serve to moderate your Avarmth in the argument, for, I suppose, your own prudence will enforce the necessity of dissembling, at least, till your son has the young lady's fortune secure.\" \u2014 \" Well,\" returned I, \" if what you tell me be true, and if I am to be a beggar, it shall never make me a rascal, or induce me to disavow my principles.

With this proposal I joyfully closed, having determined to increase my salary by managing a little farm. Having taken this resolution, my next care was to get together the wrecks of my fortune ; and, all debts collected and paid, out of fourteen thousand pounds we had but four hundred remaining. My chief attention, therefore, was now to bring down the pride of my family to their circumstances, for I well knew that aspiring beggary is wretchedness itself. \"You cannot be ignorant, my children,\" cried I, \" that no prudence of ours could have prevented our late misfortune ; but prudence may do much in disappointing its effects. We are now poor, my fondlings, and wisdom bids us conform to our humble situation.

The poor hve pleasantly without our help, Avhy then should not we learn to live pleasantly without theirs ? No, my children, let us from this moment give up all pretensions to gentility ; Ave have still enough left for happiness if we are wise, and let us draw upon content for the deficiencies of fortune.\" As my eldest son was bred a scholar, I determined to send him to town, where his abilities might contribute to our support and his own. The separation of friends and families is, perhaps, one of the most distressful circumstances attendant on penury. The day soon arrived on which we were to disperse for the first time. My son, after taking leave of his mother and the rest, who mingled their tears with kisses, came to ask a blessing from me. This I gave him from my heart, and which, added to five guineas, was all the patrimony I had now to bestow. \" You are going, my boy,\" cried I, \" to London on foot, in the manner Hooker, your great ancestor, travelled there before you. Take from me the same horse that was given him by the good bishop Jewel, this staff; and take this book, too, it will be your comfort on the Avay : these tAvo lines in it are worth a million \u2014 ' I have been young, and now am"], [49, "VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. 17 old ; yet never saw I the righteous man forsaken, nor his seed begging their bread.' Let this be your consolation as you travel on. Go, my boy ; Avhatever be thy fortune, let me see thee once a-year ; still keep a good heart \u2014 and farewell.\" As he was possessed of integrity and honour, I was under no apprehensions from throwing him naked into the amphi theatre of life, for I knew he would act a good part whether vanquished or victorious. His departure only prepared the way for our own, which arrived a few days afterwards. The leaving a neighbourhood in which we had enjoyed so many hours of tranquillity, was not without a tear, which scarcely fortitude itself could suppress. Besides, a journey of seventy miles to a family that had hitherto never been above ten from home, filled us with apprehensions ; and the cries of the poor, who followed us for some miles, contributed to increase it. The first day's journey brought us in safety within thirty miles of our future retreat, and we put up for the night at an obscure inn in a village by the Ava}7. When we were shown a room, I desired the landlord, in my usual way, to let us have his company, with which he complied, as what he drank would increase the 3"], [50, "18 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. bill the next morning. He knew, however, the ivhole neighbourhood to which I was removing, particularly Squire Thornhill, who was to be my landlord, and who hved within a few miles of the place. This gentleman he described as one who desired to know little more of the Avorld than its pleasures, being particularly remarkable for his attachment to the fair sex. He observed, that no virtue Avas able to resist his arts and assiduity, and that there was scarcely a farmer's daughter Avithin ten miles round but what had found him successful and faithless. Though this account gave me some pain, it had a very different effect upon my daughters, whose features seemed to brighten with the expectations of an approaching triumph : nor was my wife less pleased and confident of their allurements and virtue. While our thoughts were thus employed, the hostess entered the room to inform her husband that the strange gentleman, Avho had been tAvo days in the house, wanted money, and could not satisfy them for his reckoning. \" Want money! \" replied the host, \"that must be impossible; for it Avas no later than yesterday he paid three guineas to our beadle to spare an old broken soldier, that was to be whipped through the town for dog-stealing.\" The hostess, however, still persisting in her first assertion, he was preparing to leave the room, swearing that he would be satisfied one way or another, Avhen I begged the landlord would introduce me to a stranger of so much charity as he described. With this he complied, showing in a gentleman Avho seemed to be about thirty, dressed in clothes that once Avere laced. His person Avas well formed, and his face marked with the lines of thinking. He had something short and dry in his address, and seemed not to understand ceremony, or to despise it. Upon the landlord's leaving the room, I could not avoid expressing my concern for the stranger at seeing a gentleman in such circumstances, and offered him my purse to satisfy the present demand. \" I take it with all my heart, sir,\" replied he, \" and am glad that a late oversight in giving Avhat money I had about me, has shown me that there are still some men like you. I must, however, previously entreat being informed of the name"], [51, "VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. 19 and residence of my benefactor, in order to repay him as soon as possible.\" In this I satisfied him fully, not only mentioning my name and late misfortunes, but the place to which I was going to remove. \" This,\" cried he, \"happens still more luckily than I hoped for, as I am going the same way myself, having been detained here two days by the floods, which I hoped by to-morrow will be found passable.\" I testified the pleasure I should have in his company ; and my wife and daughters joining in my entreaty, he was prevailed upon to stay to supper.

As the floods were not yet subsided, we were obliged to hire a guide, who trotted on before, Mr. Burchell and I bringing up the rear. We lightened the fatigues of the\" road with philosophical disputes, which he seemed to understand perfectly. But what surprised me most was, that though he was a money borrower, he defended his opinions with as much obstinacy as if he had been my patron. He now and then also informed me to whom the different seats belonged that lay in our view as we travelled the road. \" That,\" cried he, pointing to a very magnificent house Avhich stood at some distance, \"belongs to Mr. Thornhill, a young gentleman who enjoys a large fortune, though entirely dependent on the will of his uncle, Sir William Thornhill, a gentleman who, content with a little himself, permits his nepheAV to enjoy the rest, and chiefly resides in town.\" \u2014 \"What!\" cried I, \"is my"], [54, "22 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. young landlord then the nephew of a man whose virtues, generosity, and singularities, are so universally known ? I have heard Sir William Thornhill represented as one of the most generous yet whimsical men in the kingdom; a man of consummate benevolence.\" \u2014 \" Something, perhaps, too much so,\" replied Mr. Burchell; \"at least he carried benevolence to an excess when young \u2014 for his passions were then strong, and as they were all upon the side of virtue, they led it up to a romantic extreme. He early began to aim at the qualifica tions of the soldier and the scholar \u2014 was soon distinguished in the army, and had some reputation among men of learning. Adulation ever follows the ambitious ; for such alone receive most pleasure from flattery. He was surrounded Avith crowds, who showed him only one side of their character ; so that he began to lose a regard for private interest in universal sympathy. He loved all mankind \u2014 for fortune prevented him from know ing that there was rascals. Physicians tell us of a disorder, in which the whole body is so exquisitely sensible that the slightest touch gives pain. What some have thus suffered in their persons, this gentleman felt in his mind \u2014 the slightest distress, Avhether real or fictitious, touched him to the quick, and his soul laboured under a sickly sensibility of the miseries of others. Thus disposed to relieve, it will be easily conjectured he found numbers disposed to solicit ; his profusions began to impair his fortune, but not his good-nature \u2014 that, indeed, was seen to increase as the other seemed to decay ; he grew improvident as he grew poor ; and, though he talked like a man of sense, his actions were those of a fool. Still, however, being surrounded with importunity, and no longer able to satisfy every request that was made of him, instead of money, he gave promises. They were all he had to bestow, and he had not resolution enough to give any man pain by a denial. By this he drew round him crowds of dependents, whom he Avas sure to disappoint, yet wished to relieve. These hung upon him for a time, and left him with merited reproaches and contempt. But in proportion as he became contemptible to others, he became despicable to himself. His mind had leaned upon"], [55, "23 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. their adulation ; and that support taken away, he could find no pleasure in the applause of his heart, which he had never learnt to reverence. The world iioav began to wear a different aspect : the flattery of his friends began to dwindle into simple approbation \u2014 approbation soon took the more friendly form of advice \u2014 and advice, when rejected, produced their reproaches. He now therefore found, that such friends as benefits had gathered round him, were little estimable ; he now found, that a man's own heart must be ever given to gain that of another. I hoAv found that \u2014 that \u2014 I forget what I was going to observe \u2014in short, sir, he resolved to respect himself, and laid down a plan of restoring his falling fortune. For this purpose, in his own whimsical manner, he travelled through Europe on foot ; and now, though he has scarcely attained the age of thirty, his circumstances are more affluent than ever. At present, his bounties are more rational and moderate than before ; but still he preserves the character of an humorist, and finds most pleasure in eccentric virtues.\" My attention was so much taken up by Mr. Burchell's account, that I scarcely looked forward as he went along, till we were alarmed by the cries of my family ; Avhen, turning, I perceived my youngest daughter in the midst of a rapid stream, throAvn from her horse, and struggling Avith the torrent. She had sunk twice, nor was it in my power to disengage myself in time to bring her*elief. My sensations were even too violent to permit my attempting her rescue : she must have certainly perished, had not my companion, perceiving her danger, instantly plunged in to her relief, and, with some difficulty, brought her in safety to the opposite shore. By taking the current a little farther up, the rest of the family got safely over, where we had an opportunity of joining our acknowledgments to hers. Her gratitude may be more readily imagined than described : she thanked her deliverer more with looks than Avords, and continued to lean upon his arm, as if still willing to receive assistance.

A feast also was provided for our reception, at which we sat cheerfully down, and what the conversation wanted in wit, was made up in laughter. Our little habitation was situated at the foot of a sloping hill, sheltered with a beautiful underwood behind, and a prattling river before ; on one side a meadow, on the other a green. My farm consisted of about twenty acres of excellent land, having given a hundred pounds for my predecessor's good-will. Nothing could exceed the neatness of my little enclosures : the elms and edge-rows appearing Avith inexpressible beauty. My house consisted of but one story, and Avas covered with thatch, Avhich gave it an air of great snugness ; the Avails, on the inside, were nicely whitewashed, and my daughters under- took to adorn them with pictures of their own designing. Though the same room served us for parlour and kitchen, that only made it the warmer. Besides, as it was kept with the utmost neatness, the dishes, plates, and coppers being well"], [59, "27 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. scoured, and all disposed in bright rows on the shelves, the eye was agreeably relieved, and did not want richer furniture. There were three other apartments ; one for my wife and me, another for our two daughters within our own, and the third, with two beds, for the rest of the children. The little republic to which I gave laws, was regulated in the following manner : \u2014 By sunrise we all assembled in our com mon apartment, the fire being previously kindled by the servant. After we had saluted each other with proper ceremony \u2014 for I always thought fit to keep up some mechanical forms of good breeding, without which, freedom ever destroys friendship \u2014 we all bent in gratitude to that Being who gave us another day. This duty being performed, my son and I went to pursue our usual industry abroad, while my wife and daughters employed themselves in providing breakfast, which was always ready at a certain time. I allowed half an hour for this meal, and an hour to dinner ; which time was taken up in innocent mirth between my wife and daughters, and in philosophical arguments between my son and me. As we rose with the sun, so we never pursued our labours after it was gone down, but returned home to the expecting family, where smiling looks, a neat hearth, and pleasant fire, were prepared for our reception. Nor were we without guests \u2014 sometimes farmer Flamborough, our talkative neighbour, and ofter the blind piper, would pay us a visit, and taste our gooseberry wine, for the making of which we had lost neither the receipt nor the reputation. These harmless people had several ways of being good company; Avhile one played, the other would sing some soothing ballad \u2014 \" Johnny Armstrong's last good night,\" or \" The cruelty of Barbara Allen.\" The night was concluded in the manner we began the morning, my youngest boys being appointed to read the lessons of the day ; and he that read loudest, distinctest, and best, Avas to have an halfpenny on Sunday to put into the poor's-box. When Sunday came, it Avas, indeed, a day of finery, which all my sumptuary edicts could not restrain. How well soever I fancied my lectures against pride had conquered the vanity"], [60, "28 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. of iny daughters, yet I still found them secretly attached to all their former finery\u2014 they still loved laces, ribands, bugles, and catgut ; my wife herself retained a passion for her crimson paduasoy, because I formerly happened to say it became her. The first Sunday in particular, their behaviour served to mortify me. I had desired my girls the preceeding night to be dressed early the next day, for I always loved to be at church a good while before the rest of the congregation. They punctually obeyed my direction ; but when we were to assemble in the morning at breakfast, down came my wife and daughters, dressed out in all their former splendour \u2014 their hair plastered up with pomatum \u2014 their faces patched to taste \u2014 their trains bundled up in a heap behind, and rust ling at every motion. I could not help smiling at their vanity, particularly that of my Avife, from whom I expected more discretion. In this exigency, therefore, my only resource was to order my son, Avith an important air, to call our coach. The girls where amazed at the command ; but I repeated it with more solemnity than before. \" Surely, my dear, you jest,\" cried my wife ; \" we can Avalk it perfectly well \u2014 we Avant no coach to carry us noAv.\" \u2014 \" You mistake, my child,\" returned I, \" we do want a coach ; for if we Avalk to church in this trim, the very children in the parish will hoot after us.\" \u2014 \" Indeed,\" replied my Avife, \" I ahvays imagined that my Charles was fond of seeing his children neat and handsome about him.\"\u2014\" You may be as neat as you please,\" interrupted I, \" and I shall love you the better for it ; but all this is not neatness, but frippery. These minings, and pinkings, and patchings, will only make us hated by the wives of all our neighbours. No, my children,\" continued I, more gravely, \" those gowns may be altered into something of a plainer cut, for finery is very unbecoming in us Avho want the means of decency. I do not know whether such flouncing and shredding is becoming even in the rich, if we consider, upon a moderate calculation, that the nakedness of the indigent world might be clothed from the trimmings of the vain.\" This remonstrance had the proper effect. They Avent with"], [61, "29 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. great composure, that very instant, to change their dress, and the next day I had the satisfaction of finding my daughters, at their own request, employed in cutting up their trains into Sunday waistcoats for Dick and Bill, the two little ones ; and, what was still more satisfactory, the gowns seemed improved by this curtailing."], [62, "CHAPTER V A NEW AND GREAT ACQUAINTANCE INTRODUCED. WHAT WE PLACE MOST HOPES UPON GENERALLY PROVES MOST FATAL. At a small distance from the house, my predecessor had made a seat, overshadowed by a hedge of haw thorn and honeysuckle. Here, when the weather was fine, and our la\"bour soon finished, we usually sat together, to enjoy an extensive landscape in the calm of the evening. Here, too, we drank tea, which now was become an occasional banquet ; and as Ave had it but seldom, it diffused a new joy, the prepa rations for it being made with no small share of bustle and ceremony. On these occasions, our two little ones always read to us, and they were regularly served after we had done. Sometimes, to give a variety to our amusements, the girls sang to the guitar ; and while they thus formed a little con cert, my wife and I would stroll down the sloping field, that Avas embellished with blue bells and centaury, talk of our chil dren with rapture, and enjoy the breeze that wafted both health and harmony."], [63, "VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. 31 In this manner we began to find that every situation in life may bring its own peculiar pleasures \u2014 every morning awaked us to a repetition of toil, but the evening repaid it with vacant hilarity. It was about the beginning of autumn, on a holiday \u2014 for I kept such as intervals of relaxation from labour \u2014 that I had drawn out my family to our usual place of amusement, and our young musicians began their usual concert. As we were thus engaged, we saw a stag bound nimbly by, Avithin about twenty paces of where we were sitting, and by its panting it seemed pressed by the hunters. We had not much time to reflect upon the poor animal's distress, when we perceived the dogs and horsemen come sweeping along at some distance behind, and making the very path it had taken. I was instantly for returning in with my family ; but either curiosity, or sur prise, or some more hidden motive, held my wife and daughters to their seats. The huntsman who rode foremost, passed us with great swiftness, followed by four or five persons more, who seemed in equal haste. At last, a young gentleman, of a more genteel appearance than the rest, came forward, and for a while regarding us, instead of pursuing the chase, stopt short, and, giving his horse to a servant who attended, approached us with a careless superior air. He seemed to want no introduction, but was going to salute my daughters, as one certain of a kind reception ; but they had early learnt the lesson of looking presumption out of countenance. Upon which he let us know that his name was Thornhill, and that he was owner of the estate that lay for some extent around us. He again therefore offered to salute the female part of the family ; and such was the power of fortune and fine clothes, that he found no second repulse. As his address, though confident, Avas easy, we soon became more familiar ; and per ceiving musical instruments lying near, he begged to be favoured with a song. As I did not approve of such dispro portioned acquaintances, I Avinked upon my daughters in order to prevent their compliance ; but my hint was counteracted by one from their mother \u2014 so that, Avith a cheerful air, they gave"], [64, "32 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. us a favorite song of Dryden's. Mr. Thornhill seemed highly delighted by their performance and choice, and then took up the guitar himself. He played but very indifferently ; hoAvever, my eldest daughter repaid his former applause with interest, and assured him that his tones Avere louder than even those of her master. At this compliment he bowed, which she returned Avith a curtsey. He praised her taste, and she commended his understanding ; an age could not have made them better acquainted : Avhile the fond mother too, equally happy, insisted upon her landlord's stepping in, and tasting a glass of her goose berry. The whole family seemed earnest to please him : my"], [65, "VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. 33 girls attempted to entertain him with topics they thought most modern ; while Moses, on the contrary, gave him a question"], [66, "34 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. or two from the ancients, for which he had the satisfaction of being laughed at. My little ones were no less busy, and fondly stuck close to the stranger. All my endeavours could scarcely keep their dirty fingers from handling and tarnishing the lace on his clothes, and lifting up the flaps of his pocket holes, to see what was there. At the approach of evening he took leave ; but not till he had requested permission to reneAv his visit, which, as he was our landlord, we most readily agreed to. As soon as he was gone, my wife called a council on the conduct of the day. She was of opinion that it was a most fortunate hit ; for she had known even stranger things than that brought to bear. She hoped again to see the day in which we might hold up our heads with the best of them ; and con cluded, she protested she could see no reason why the two Miss Wrinklers should marry great fortunes, and her children get none. As this last argument was directed to me, I pro tested I could see no reason for it either, nor why Mr. Simpkins got the ten thousand pound prize in the lottery, and we sat down with a blank. \" I protest, Charles,\" cried my wife, \" this is the way you always damp my girls and me when we are in spirits. Tell me, Sophy, my dear, what do you think of our new visitor ? Don't you think he seemed to be good natured ?\" \u2014 \" Immensely so, indeed, mamma,\" replied she : \" I think he has a great deal to say upon every thing, and is never at a loss ; and the more trifling the subject the more he has to say.\" \u2014 \" Yes,\" cried Olivia, \" he is well enough for a man ; but for my own part, I don't much like him, he is so extremely impudent and familiar ; but on the guitar he is shocking.\" These two last speeches I interpreted by contra ries. I found by this, that Sophia internally despised, as much as Olivia secretly admired him. \" Whatever may be your opinions of him, my children,\" cried I, \"to confess the truth, he has not prepossessed me in his favour. Dispropor tioned friendships ever terminate in disgust ; and I thought, notwithstanding all his ease, that he seemed perfectly sensible of the distance between us.

It is true, I have no apprehensions from the conduct of my children ; but I think there are some from his character.\" I would have proceeded, but for the interruption of a servant from the Squire, who, with his compliments, sent us a side of venison, and a promise to dine with us some days after. This well-timed present pleaded more powerfully in his favour than any thing I had to say could obviate.

I was pleased with the poor man's friendship for two rea sons ; because I knew that he wanted mine, and I knew him to bo friendly as far as he was able. He was known in our neighbourhood by the character of the poor gentleman, that would do no good when he was young, though he was not yet thirty. He would at intervals talk with great good sense ; but, in general, he was fondest of the company of children, whom he used to call harmless little men. He was famous, I found, for singing them ballads, and telling them stories, and seldom went out without something in his pockets for them \u2014 a piece of gingerbread, or a halfpenny whistle. He gene rally came for a few days into our neighbourhood once a-year, and lived upon the neighbours' hospitality. He sat down to supper among us, aud my wife was not sparing of her goose-"], [70, "38 TICAR OF WAKE/FIELD, berry-wine. The tale went rortnd ; he sang us old songs, and gave the children the story of the Buck of Beverland, with the history of Patient Grizzel, the adventures of Catskin, and then Fair Rosamond's Bower. Our cock, which always crew at eleven, now told us it was time for repose ; but an unforeseen difficulty started about lodging the stranger \u2014 all our beds were already taken up, and it was too late to send him to the next alehouse. In this dilemma, little Dick offered him his part ofthe bed, if his brother Moses would let him lie with him. \" And I,\" cried Bill, \" will give Mr. Burchell my part, if my sisters will take me to theirs.\" \u2014 \" Well done, my good chil dren,\" cried I, \" hospitality is one of the first Christian duties. The beast retires to its shelter, and the bird flies to its nest ; but helpless man can only find refuge from his fellow-creature. The greatest stranger in this world was he that came to save it. He never had a house, as if willing to see what hospitality was left remaining among us. Deborah, my dear,\" cried I to my wife, \" give those boys a lump of sugar each ; and let Dick's be the largest, because he spoke first.\" In the morning early I called out my whole family to help at saving an after-growth of hay ; and our guest offering his assistance, he was accepted among the number. Our labours went on lightly ; we turned the swath to the wind. I went foremost, and the rest followed in due succession. I could not avoid, however, observing the assiduity of Mr. Bur chell in assisting my daughter Sophia in her part of the task. When he had finished his own, he would join in hers, and enter into a close conversation , but I had too good an opinion of Sophia's understanding, and was too well convinced of her ambition, to be under any uneasiness from a man of broken fortune. When we were finished for the day, Mr. Burchell was invited as on the night before, but he refused, as he was to lie that night at a neighbour's, to whose child he was carry ing a whistle. When gone, our conversation at supper turned upon our late unfortunate guest. \"What a strong instance,\" said I, \" is that poor man, of the miseries attending a youth of levity and extravagance ! He by no means wants sense,"], [71, "VICAU OF WAKEFIEI.D. 39 which only serves to aggravate his former folly. Poor forlorn creature ! where are now the revellers, the flatterers, that he could once inspire and command ? Gone, perhaps, to attend the bagnio pander, grown rich by his extravagance. They once praised him, and now they applaud the pander : their for mer raptures at his wit are now converted into sarcasms at his folly : he is poor, and perhaps deserves poverty ; for he has neither the ambition to be independent, nor the skill to be useful.\" Prompted, perhaps, by some secret reasons, I deli vered this observation with too much acrimony, which my Sophia gently reproved. \" Whatsoever his former conduct may have been, papa, his circumstances should exempt him from censure now. His present indigence is a sufficient punish ment for former folly ; and I have heard my papa himself say, that we should never strike one unnecessary blow at a victim over whom Providence holds the scourge of its resentment,\" \u2014 \" You are right, Sophy,\" cried my son Moses ; \" and one of the ancients finely represents so malicious a conduct, by the attempts of a rustic to flay Marsyas, whose skin, the fable tells us, had been wholly stripped off by another. Besides, I don't know if this poor man's situation be so bad as my father would represent it. We are not to judge of the feelings of others, by what we might feel if in their place. However dark the habitation of the mole to our eyes, yet the animal itself finds the apartment sufficiently lightsome. And, to confess a truth, this man's mind seems fitted to his station ; for I never heard any one more sprightly than he was to-day, when he conversed with you.\" This was said without the least design ; however, it excited a blush, which she strove to cover by an affected laugh, assuring him that she scarcely took any notice of what he said to her, but that she believed he might once have been a very fine gentleman. The readiness with which she under took to vindicate herself, and her blushing, were symptoms I did not internally approve ; but I repressed my suspicions. As we expected our landlord the next day, my wife went to make the venison pasty, Moses sat reading, while I taught the little ones. My daughters seemed equally busy with the"], [72, "40 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. rest ; and I observed them for a good while cooking something over the fire. I at first supposed they were assisting their mother, but little Dick informed me, in a whisper, that they were making a wash for the face. Washes of all kinds I had a natural antipathy to ; for I knew that, instead of mending the complexion, they spoil it. I therefore approached my chair by sly degrees to the fire, and, grasping the poker, as if it wanted mending, seemingly by accident oA'erturned the whole composition, and it was too late to begin another."], [73, "CHAPTER VII. A TOWN WIT DESCRIBED. THE DULLEST FELLOWS MAY LEARN TO BE COMICAL FOR A NIGHT OR TWO. hen the morning arrived on which we were to entertain our young landlord, it may be easily supposed what pro- visions were exhausted to make an appearance. It may also be conjec- tured that my wife and daughters expanded their gayest plumage on this occasion. Mr. Thornhill came with a couple of friends, his chaplain, and feeder. The servants, who were numerous, he politely ordered to the next alehouse ; but my wife, in the triumph of her heart, insisted on enter taining them all, for which, by the bye, our family was pinched for three weeks after.

Olivia, too, could not avoid whispering, loud enough to be heard, that he had an infinite fund of humour. After dinner, I began with my usual toast, \" The Church :\" for this I was thanked by the chaplain, as he said the Church was the only mistress of his affections. \" Come, tell us honestly, Frank,\" said the Squire, with his usual archness, \" suppose the Church, your present mistress, dressed in lawn sleeves, on one hand, and Miss Sophia, with no lawn about her, on the other, which would you be for ?\" \u2014 \" For both, to be sure,\" cried the chaplain. \" Right, Frank,\" cried the Squire ; \" for may this glass suffocate me, but a fine girl is worth all the priestcraft in the creation ! For what are tithes and tricks but an imposition, all a confounded imposture, and I can prove it.\" \u2014 \" I wish you would,\" cried my son Moses ; \"and I think,\" continued he, \"that I should be able to"], [75, "43 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. answer you.\" \u2014 \" Very well, Sir,\" cried the Squire, who imme- diately smoked him, and winked on the rest of the company to prepare us for the sport, \"if you are for a cool argument upon that subject, I am ready to accept the challenge. And, first, whether are you for managing it analogically or dialogi- cally ?\" \u2014 \" I am for managing it rationally,\" cried Moses, quite happy at being permitted to dispute. \" Good again,\" cried the Squire ; \" and, firstly, of the first, I hope you'll not deny, that whatever is, is. If you don't grant me that, I can go no farther.\" \u2014 \" Why,\" returned Moses, \" I think I may grant that, and make the best of it.\" \u2014 \" I hope, too,\" returned the other, \" you'll grant that a part is less than the whole.\" \u2014 \" I grant that too,\" cried Moses, \" it is but just and reasonable.\" \" I hope,\" cried the Squire, \" you will not deny, that the two angles of a triangle are equal to two right ones.\" \u2014 \" Nothing can be plainer,\" returned t'other, and looked round with his usual importance. \" Very well,\" cried the Squire, speaking very quick, \" the premises being thus settled, I proceed to observe, that the concatenation of self-existences, proceeding in a reciprocal duplicate ratio, naturally produce a problema- tical dialogism, which, in some measure, proves that the essence of spirituality may be referred to the second predicable.\" \" Hold, hold !\" cried the other, \" I deny that ; do you think I can thus tamely submit to such heterodox doctrines ?\" \"What!\" replied the Squire, as if in apassion, \"not submit! Answer me one plain question. Do you think Aristotle right when he says that relatives are related ?\" \u2014 \" Undoubtedly,\" replied the other. \" If so, then,\" cried the Squire, \" answer me directly to what I propose. Whether do you judge the analytical investigation ofthe first part of my enthymem defi- cient secundum quoad, or quoad minus ; and give me your reasons \u2014 give me your reasons, I say, directly.\" \u2014 \" I protest,\" cried Moses, \" I don't rightly comprehend the force of your reasoning ; but if it be reduced to one simple proposition, I fancy it may then have an answer.\" \u2014 \"Oh, Sir!\" cried the Squire, \" I am your most humble servant ; I find you want me to furnish you with argument and intellects too. No,"], [76, "44 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. Sir, there I protest you are too hard for me.\" This effectually raised the laugh against poor Moses, who sat the only dismal figure in a group of merry faces ; nor did he offer a single syllable more during the whole of the entertainment. But though all this gave me no pleasure, it had a very different effect upon Olivia, who mistook it for humour, though but a mere act of the memory. She thought him, therefore, a very fine gentleman ; and such as consider what poAverful ingredients a good figure, fine clothes, and fortune, are in that"], [77, "VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. 45 character, will easily forgive her. Mr. Thornhill, notwith standing his real ignorance, talked with ease, and could expa tiate upon the common topics of conversation with fluency. It is not surprising then, that such talents should win the affections of a girl, who by education was taught to value an appearance in herself, and consequently to set a value upon it in another. Upon his departure, we again entered into a debate upon the merits of our young landlord. As he directed his looks and conversation to Olivia, it was no longer doubted but that she was the object that induced him to be our visitor. Nor did she seem to be much displeased at the innocent raillery of her brother and sister upon this occasion. Even Deborah herself seemed to share the glory of the day, and exulted in her daughter's victory as if it were her own. \" And now, my dear,\" cried she to me, \" I'll fairly own, that it was I that instructed my girls to encourage our landlord's addresses. I had always some ambition, and you now see that I was right ; for who knows how this may end ?\" \u2014 \" Ay, who knows that indeed!\" answered I, with a groan: \"for my part I don't much like it ; and 1 could have been better pleased with one that was poor and honest, than this fine gentleman with his for tune and infidelity ; for depend on't, if he be what I susspect him, no free-thinker shall ever have a child of mine.\" \" Sure, father,\" cried Moses, \" you are too severe in this ; for Heaven will never arraign him for what he thinks, but for what he does.

Thinking freely of religion may be involuntary with this gentleman; so that, allowing his sentiments to be wrong, yet, as he is purely passive in his assent, he is no more to be blamed for his errors, than the governor of a city without walls for the shelter he is obliged to afford an invading enemy.\" \"True, my son,\" cried I; \"but if the governor invites the enemy there, he is justly culpable. And such is always the case with those who embrace error.

So that, though our erroneous opi nions be involuntary when formed, yet as we have been wilfully corrupt, or very negligent in forming them, we deserve punish ment for our vice, or contempt for our folly.\" My wife now kept up the conversation, though not the argument : she observed, that several very prudent men of our acquaintance were free-thinkers, and made very good husbands; and she knew some sensible girls that had skill enough to make converts of their spouses. \" And who knows, my dear,\" con tinued she, \" what Olivia may be able to do P\" the girl has a great deal to say upon every subject, and, to my knowledge, is very well skilled in controversy.\" \u2014 \" Why, my dear, what controversy can she have read ?\" cried I ; \"it does not occur to me that I ever put such books into her hands : you certainly overrate her merit.\" \u2014 \" Indeed, papa,\" replied Olivia, \" she does not : I have read a great deal of controversy. I have read the disputes between Thwackum and Square ; the con troversy between Robinson Crusoe and Friday, the savage ; and I am now employed in reading the controversy in Religi ous Courtship.\" \u2014 \" Very well,\" cried I, \" that's a good girl ; I find you are perfectly qualified for making converts, and so go help your mother to make the gooseberry pie.\""], [79, "CHAPTER VIII AN INCIDENT, WHICH PROMISES LITTLE GOOD FORTUNE, YET MAY BE PRODUCTIVE OF MUCH. he next morning we were again visited by Mr Burchell, though I began, for certain reasons, to be displeased with the frequency of his return ; but I could not refuse him my company and my fireside. It is true, his lab our more than requited his entertain- ment; for he wrought amongst us with vigour, and, either in the meadow or at the hay-rick, put himself foremost. Besides, he had always something amusing to say that lessened our toil, and was at once so out of the way, and yet so sensible, that I loved, laughed at, and pitied him. My only dislike arose from an attachment he discovered to my daughter. He would, in a jesting manner, call her his little mistress, and when he bought each of the girls a set of ribands, hers was the finest.

To heighten our satisfaction, two blackbirds answered each other from oppo- site hedges, the familiar redbreast came and pecked the crumbs from our hands, and every sound seemed but the echo of tran quillity. \" I never sit thus,\" says Sophia, \" but I think of the two lovers so sweetly described by Mr. Gay, who were struck dead in each other's arms. There is something so pa thetic in the description, that I have read it a hundred times with new rapture.\" \u2014 \" In my opinion,\" cried my son, \" the finest strokes in that description are much below those in the Acis and Galatea of Ovid. The Roman poet understands the use of contrast better ; and upon that figure, artfully managed, all strength in the pathetic depends.\" \u2014 \" It is remarkable,\" cried Mr. Burchell, \" that both the poets you mention have equally contributed to introduce a false taste into their respec tive countries, by loading all their lines with epithet.

Or grief for friendship unreturned, Or unregarded love ? \" Alas ! the joys that fortune brings Are trifling, and decay ; And those';who prize the paltry things, More trifling still than they. \" And what is friendship but a name \u2014 A charm that lulls to sleep \u2014 A shade that follows wealth or fame, But leaves the wretch to weep ?"], [85, "53 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. \" And love is still an emptier sound, The modern fair one's jest ; On earth unseen, or only found To warm the turtle's nest. \" For shame, fond youth, thy sorrows hush, And spurn the sex,\" he said ; But while he spoke, a rising blush, His love-lorn guest betray'd. Surprised he sees new beauties rise, Swift mantling to the view ; Like colours o'er the morning skies, As bright, as transient too.

But our tranquillity was soon disturbed by the report of a gun just by us, and immediately after, a man was seen bursting through the hedge, to take up the game he had killed. This sportsman was the Squire's chaplain, who had shot one of the blackbirds that so agreeably entertained us. So loud a report, and so near, startled my daughters \u2022 and I could perceive that Sophia in the fright had thrown herself into Mr. Burchell' s arms for protection. The gentleman came up, and asked pardon for having disturbed us, affirming that he was igno rant of our being so near. He therefore sat down by my youngest daughter, and, sportsman like, offered her what he had killed that morning. She was going to refuse, but a private look from her mother soon induced her to correct the mistake, and accept his present, though with some re luctance. My wife, as usual, discovered her pride in a whisper, observing, that Sophy had made a conquest of the chaplain, as well as her sister had ofthe Squire. I suspected, however, with more probability, that her affections were placed upon a different object. The chaplain's errand was to inform us, that Mr. Thornhill had provided music and refreshments, and intended that night giving the young ladies a ball by moonlight, on the grass plot before our door. Nor can I deny,\" continued he, \" but I have an interest in being first to deliver this message, as I expect for my reward to be honoured with Miss Sophia's hand as a partner.\" To this my girl repfied, that she should have no objection, if she could do it with honour \u2022 \" but here,\" continued she, \" is a gentleman,\" looking at Mr. Burchell, \"who has been my companion in the task for the day, and it is fit he should share in its amusements.\" Mr. Burchell returned her a compliment for her intentions, but resigned her up to the chaplain ; adding, that he was to go that night five miles, being invited to a harvest supper. His refusal appeared to me a little extraordinary ; nor could I conceive how so sensi- ble a girl as my youngest, could thus prefer a man of broken 8"], [92, "58 A'lCAR OF WAKEFIELD. fortunes to one whose expectations were much greater. But as men are most capable of distinguishing merit in women, so the ladies often form the truest judgments of us.

Burchell had scarcely taken leave and Sophia consented to dance with the chaplain, when my little ones came running out to tell us that the Squire was come with a crowd of com pany. Upon our return, we found our landlord, with a couple of under gentlemen, andtwo young ladies rich- ly dressed, whom he introduced as women of very great dis tinction and fashion from town. We happened not to have chairs enough for the whole company; but Mr. Thornhill immediately proposed, that every gentleman should sit in a lady's lap. This I positively objected to, notwithstanding a look of disapprobation from my wife. Moses was therefore dispatched to borrow a couple of chairs; and as we were in want of ladies to make up a set at country dances, the two"], [94, "60 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. gentlemen went with him in quest of a couple of partners. Chairs and partners were soon provided.

This at first discomposed us, however, after a little shoving and dragging, they at last went merrily on. Our music consisted of two fiddles, with a pipe and tabor. The moon shone bright. Mr. Thornhill and my eldest daughter led up the ball, to the great delight of the spectators; for the neighbours, hearing what was going forward, came flocking about us. My girl moved with so much grace and vivacity, that my wife could not avoid discovering the pride of her heart, by assuring me, that"], [95, "61 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. though the little chit did it so cleverly, all the steps were stolen from herself. The ladies of the town strove hard to be equally easy, but without success. They swam, sprawled, languished, and frisked ; but all would not do : the gazers indeed owned that it was fine ; but neighbour Flamborough observed, that Miss Livy's feet seemed as pat to the music as its echo. After the dance had continued about an hour, the two ladies, who were apprehensive of catching cold, moved to break up the ball. One of them, I thought, expressed her sentiments upon this occasion in a very coarse manner, when she observed, that, \" by the living jingo, she was all of a muck of sweat.\" Upon our return to the house, we found a very elegant cold supper, which Mr. Thornhill had ordered to be brought with him. The conversation at this time was more reserved than before. The two ladies threw my girls quite into the shade; for they would talk of nothing but high life, and high-lived company; with other fashionable topics, such as pictures, taste, Shakspeare, and the musical glasses. 'Tis true they once or twice mortified us sensibly by slipping out an oath ; but that appeared to me as the surest symptom of their distinction (though I am since informed that swearing is perfectly unfashionable). Their finery, however, threw a veil over any grossness in their conversa tion. My daughters seemed to regard their superior accom plishments with envy; and what appeared amiss, was ascribed to tip-top quality breeding. But the condescension of the ladies was still superior to their other accomplish ments. One of them observed, that had Miss Olivia seen a little more of the Avorld, it Avould greatly improve her ; to which the other added, that a single winter in town would make her little Sophia quite another thing. My wife warmly assented to both, adding, that there was nothing she more ardently wished than to give her girls a single winter's polish ing. To this I could not help replying, that their breeding was already superior to their fortune, and that greater refine- ment would only serve to make their poverty ridiculous, and give them a taste for pleasures they had no right to possess."], [96, "62 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. \" And what pleasures,\" cried Mr. Thornhill, \" do they not deserve to possess, who have so much in their power to bestow ? As for my part,\" continued he, \" my fortune is pretty large \u2014 love, liberty, and pleasure, are my maxims ; but curse me, if a settlement of half my estate could give my charming Olivia pleasure, it should be her's, and the only favour I would ask in return would be to add myself to the benefit.\" I was not such a stranger to the world as to be ignorant that this was the fashionable cant to disguise the insolence of the basest proposal ; but I made an effort to suppress my resentment. \" Sir,\" cried I, \" the family which you now condescend to favour with your company, has been bred with as nice a sense of honour as you. Any attempts to injure that may be attended with very dangerous conse quences. Honour, Sir, is our only possession at present, and of that last treasure we must be particularly careful.\" I was soon sorry for the warmth with which I had spoken this, when the young gentleman, grasping my hand, swore he commended my spirit, though he disapproved my sus picions. \" As to your present hint,\" continued he, \" I protest that nothing was farther from my heart than such a thought. No, by all that's tempting ! the virtue that will stand a regular siege was never to my taste ; for all my successes are achieved by a coup-de-main.\" The two ladies, who affected to be ignorant of the rest, seemed highly displeased with this last stroke of freedom, and began a very discreet and serious dialogue upon virtue : in this my wife, the chaplain, and I, soon joined ; and the Squire himself was at last brought to confess a sense of sorrow for his former excesses. We talked of the pleasures of temperance, and of the sunshine in the mind unpolluted with guilt. I was so well pleased, that my little ones were kept up beyond the usual time to be edified by so much good conversation. Mr. Thornhill even went beyond me, and demanded if I had any objection to giving prayers. I joy fully embraced the proposal ; and in this manner the night was passed in a most comfortable way, till at last the com-"], [97, "VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. 63 pany began to think of returning. The ladies seemed very unwilling to part with my daughters, for whom they had conceived a particular affection, and joined in a request to have the pleasure of their company home. The Squire seconded the proposal, and my wife added her entreaties ; the girls, too, looked upon me as if they wished to go. In this perplexity, I made two or three excuses, which my daughters as readily removed ; so that at last I was obliged to give a peremptory refusal, for which we had nothing but sullen looks and short answers the whole day ensuing."], [98, "CHAPTER X THE FAMILY ENDEAVOUR TO COPE WITH THEIR BETTERS THE MISERIES OF THE POOR, WHEN THEY ATTEMPT TO APPEAR ABOVE THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES. now began to find, that all my long and painfullecturesupon temperance, simplicity, and contentment, were en tirely disregarded. The distinctions lately paid us by our betters awaken ed that pride which I had laid asleep, but not removed. Our windows, again, as formerly, were filled with Avashes for the neck and face. The sun was dreaded as an enemy to the skin without doors, and the fire as a spoiler of the complexion witbin. My wife observed that rising too early would hurt her daughter's eyes ; that working after dinner would redden their noses ; and she convinced me that the hands never looked so white as when they did nothing. Instead, therefore, of finishing George's shirts, we now had them new-modelling their old gauzes, or flourishing upon"], [99, "65 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. catgut. The poor miss Flamboroughs their former gay com panions, were cast off as mean acquaintances, and the whole conversation ran upon high life, and high-lived company; with pictures, taste, Shakspeare, and the musical glasses. But we could have borne all this, had not a fortune-telling gipsy come to raise us into perfect sublimity. The tawny Sibyl no sooner appeared, than my girls came running to me for a shilling a-piece to cross her hand with silver. To say the truth, I was tired of being always wise, and could not help gratifying their request, because I loved to see them happy. I gave each of them a shilling ; though, for the honour of the family, it must be observed, that they never went without money themselves, as my wife always let them have a guinea each, to keep in their pockets, but Avith strict injunctions never 9"], [100, "66 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. \u25a0t to change it. After they had been closetted up with the fortune teller for some time, I knew by their looks, upon their return ing, that they had been promised something great. \" Well, my girls, how have you sped ? Tell me, Livy, has the fortune teller given thee a penny-worth?\" \u2014 \" I protest, papa,\" says the girl, \" I believe she deals with somebody that's not right ; for 6he positively declared, that I am to be married to a Squire in less than a twelvemonth !\" \u2014 \" Well now, Sophy, my child,\" said I, \" and what sort of a husband are you to have 1\" \u2014 \" Sir,\" replied she, \" I am to have a Lord soon after my sister has married the Squire.\" \u2014 \" How,\" cried I, \" is that all you are to have for your two shillings ? Only a Lord and a Squire for two shillings ! You fools, I could have promised you a Prince and a Nabob for half the money.\" This curiosity of theirs, however, was attended with very serious effects ; we now began to think ourselves designed by the stars to something exalted, and already anticipated our future grandeur. It has been a thousand times observed, and I must observe it once more, that the hours we pass with happy prospects in view, are more pleasing than those crowned with fruition. In the first case, we cook the dish to our own appetite ; in the latter, nature cooks it for us. It is impossible to repeat tht train of agreeable reveries we called up for our entertainment. We looked upon our fortunes as once more rising ; and as the whole parish asserted that the Squire was in love with my daughter, she was actually so with him; for they persuaded her into the passion. In this agreeable interval, my wife had the most lucky dreams in the world, which she took care to tell us every morning with great solemnity and exactness. It was one night, a coffin and cross-bones, the sign of an approaching wedding ; at another time she imagined her daughters' pockets filled with farthings, a certain sign of their being shortly stuffed with gold. The girls themselves had their omens. They felt strange kisses on their lips ; they saw rings in the candle ; purses bounced from the fire ; and true love knots lurked in the bottom of every tea-cup."], [101, "67 VICAR OF AVAKEF1ELD. ToAvards the end of the week we received a card from the two ladies, in which, with their compliments, they hoped to see all our family at church the Sunday following. All Satur- day morning I could perceive, in consequence of this, my wife and daughters in close conference together, and now and then glancing at me with looks that betrayed a latent plot. To be sincere, I had strong suspicions that some absurd pro- posal was preparing for appearing with splendour the next day. In the evening, they began their operations in a very regular manner, and my wife undertook to conduct the siege. After tea, when I seemed in spirits, she began thus : \u2014 \" I fancy, Charles, my dear, we shall have a great deal of good company at our church to-morrow.\" \u2014 \" Perhaps we may, my dear,\" returned I, \" though you need be under no uneasiness about that ; you shall have a sermon whether there be or not.\" \u2014 \" That is what I expect,\" returned she ; \" but I think, my dear, we ought to appear there as decently as possible, for who knows what may happen?\" \u2014 \" Your precautions,\" replied I, \" are highly commendable. A decent behaviour and appearance in church is what charms me. We should be devout and humble, cheerful and serene.\" \u2014 \" Yes,\" cried she, \" I know that ; but I mean we should go there in as proper a manner as possible ; not altogether like the scrubs about us.\" \u2014 \" You are quite right, my dear,\" returned I, \" and I was going to make the very same proposal. The proper man- ner of going is, to go there as early as possible, to have time for meditation before the service begins.\" \u2014 \" Phoo, Charles,\" interrupted she, \" all that is very true, but not what I would be at : I mean we should go there genteelly You know the church is two miles off, and I protest I don't like to see my daughters trudging up to their pew all blowzed and red with walking, and looking for all theAvorld as if they had been winners at a smock race. Now, my dear, my pro posal is this : there are our two plough horses, the colt that has been in our family these nine years, and his companion Blackberry, that has scarcely done an earthly thing for this month past. They are both grown fat and lazy. Why should"], [102, "68 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD not they do something as well as we ? And let me tell you, when Moses has trimmed them a little, they will cut a very tolerable figure.\" To this proposal I objected, that walking would be twenty times more genteel than such a paltry conveyance, as Black berry was wall-eyed, and the colt wanted a tail ; that they never had been broke to the rein, but had a hundred vicious tricks ; and that we had but one saddle and pillion in the whole house. All these objections, however, were overruled, so that I was obliged to comply. The next morning I per ceived them not a little busy in collecting such materials as might be necessary for the expedition ; but as I found it would"], [103, "69 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. be a business of time, I walked on to the church before, and they promised speedily to follow. I waited near an hour in the reading desk for their arrival ; but not finding them come as I expected, I was obliged to begin, and went through the service, not without some uneasiness at finding them absent. This was increased when all was finished, and no appearance of the family. I therefore walked back the horse-way, which was five miles round, though the foot way was but two, and when I got about half way home, perceived the procession marching slowly forward towards the church ; my son, my wife, and the two little ones, exalted on one horse, and my two daughters upon the other. I demanded the cause of their delay ; but I soon found by their looks they had met with a thousand misfortunes on the road. The horses had at first refused to move from the door, until Mr. Burchell was kind enough to beat them forward for about two hundred yards with his cudgel. Next, the straps of my wife's pillion broke down, and they were obliged to stop to repair them before they could proceed. After that, one of the horses took it into his head to stand still, and neither blows nor entreaties could prevail upon him to proceed. He was just recovering from this dismal situation when I found them : but perceiving every thing safe, I own their present mortification did not much displease me, as it would give many opportunities of future triumph and teach my daughters more humility."], [104, "CHAPTER XI THE FAMILY STILL RESOLVE TO HOLD UP THEIR HEADS. jy) ichaelmas-eve happening on the next day we were invited to burn nuts and play tricks at neighbour Flamborough's. Our late mortifica tions had humbled us a little, or it is probable we might have rejected such an invitation with contempt : how ever, we suffered ourselves to be happy. Our honest neighbour's goose and dumplings were fine, and the lamb'swool, even in the opinion of my wife, who was a connoisseur, was excellent. It is true his manner of telling stories was not quite so well. They were very long, and very dull, and all about himself, and we had laughed at them ten times before : however, we were kind enough to laugh at them once more. Mr. Burchell, who was of the party, was always fond of"], [105, "71 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. seeing some innocent amusement going forward, and set the boys and girls to blind-man's-buff. My wife, too, was per suaded to join in the diversion, and it gave me pleasure to think she was not yet too old. In the meantime, my neigh bour and I looked on, laughed at every feat, and praised our own dexterity when we were young. Hot cockles succeeded next, questions and commands followed that, and last of all, they sat down to hunt the slipper. As every person may not be acquainted with this primeval pastime, it maybe necessay to observe, that the company in this play plant themselves in a ring upon the ground, all except one, who stands in the middle, whose business it is to catch a shoe, which the com pany shove about under their hams from one to another, something like a weaver's shuttle. As it is impossible, in this case, for the lady who is up to face all the company at once, the great beauty of the play lies in hitting her a thump with the heel of the shoe on that side least capable of making a defence. It was in this manner that my eldest daughter was hemmed in, and thumped about, all blowzed, in spirits, and bawling for fair play, with a voice that might deafen a ballad-singer ; when, confusion on confusion ; who should enter the room but our two great acquaintances from town, Lady Blarney, and Miss Carolina Wilelmima Amelia Skeggs ! Description would but beggar, therefore it is unnecessary to describe this new mortification. Death ! to be seen by ladies of such high breeding in such vulgar attitudes! Nothing bet ter could ensue from such a vulgar play of Mr. Flamborough's proposing. We seemed stuck to the ground for some time, as if actually petrified with amazement. The two ladies had been at our house to see us, and finding us from home, came after us hither, as they were uneasy to know what accident had kept us from church the day before. Olivia undertook to be our prolocutor, and delivered the whole in a summary way, only saying, \" We were thrown from our horses.\" At which account the ladies were greatly concerned \u2014 but being told the family received no hurt, they were extremely glad \u2014 but being informed that we were almost"], [106, "72 VICAR OF WAKEEIELD. killed by the fright, they were vastly sorry\u2014 but hearing that we had a very good night, they were extremely glad again. Nothing could exceed their complaisance to my daughters \u2014 their professions the last evening were warm, but now they were ardent. They protested a desire of a more lasting acquaintance. Lady Blarney was particularly attached to Olivia ; Miss Carolina Wilelmina Amelia Skeggs (I love to give the whole name) took a greater fancy to her sister. They supported the conversation between themselves, while my daughters sat silent, admiring their exalted breeding. But as every reader, however beggarly himself, is fond of high lived dialogues, with anecdotes of lords, ladies, and knights of the garter, I must beg leave to give him the concluding part of the present conversation. \" All that I know of the matter,\" cried Miss Skeggs, \" is this, that it may be true, or it may not be true ; but this I can assure your Ladyship, that the whole rout was in amaze \u2014 his Lordship turned all manner of colours, my Lady fell into a sound, but Sir Tomkyn, drawing his sword, swore he was hers to the last drop of his blood.\" \" Well,\" replied our Peeress, \" this I can say, that the Duchess never told me a syllable of the matter, and I believe her Grace would keep nothing a secret from me. This you may depend upon as fact, that the next morning my Lord Duke cried out three times to his valet-de-chambre, ' Jernigan ! Jernigan ! Jernigan ! bring me my garters !' \" But previously I should have mentioned the very impolite behaviour of Mr. Burchell, who, during this discourse, sat with his face turned to the fire, and, at the conclusion of every sentence, would cry out \" Fudge !\" \u2014 an expression which displeased us all, and in some measure damped the rising spirit of the conversation. \" Besides, my dear Skeggs,\" continued our Peeress, \" there is nothing of this in the copy of verses that Dr. Burdock made upon the occasion.\" \" Fudge !\" \" I am surprised at that,\" cried Miss Skeggs ; \" for he seldom leaves any thing out, as he writes only for his o irn"], [107, "VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. 73 amusement. But can your Ladyship favour me with a sight of them?\" \"Fudge!\" \" My dear creature,\" replied our Peeress, \" do you think I carry such things about me ? Though they are very fine, to be sure, and I think myself something of a judge \u2014 at least I know what pleases myself. Indeed, I was ever an admirer of all Dr^ Burdock's little pieces ; for, except what he does, and our dear Countess at Hanover Square, there's nothing comes out but the most lowest stuff in nature \u2014 not a bit of high life among them.\" \" Fudge ! \" \"Your Ladyship should except,\" says the other, \"your own things in the Lady's Magazine. I hope you'll say there's nothing low-lived there ? But I suppose we are to have no more from that quarter ? \" \" Fudge ! \" \"Why, my dear,\" says the lady, \"you know my reader and companion has left me, to be married to Captain Roach ; and as my poor eyes won't suffer me to write myself, I have been for some time looking out for another. A proper person is no easy matter to find; and, to be sure, thirty pounds a-year is a small stipend for a well-bred girl of character, that can read, write, and behave in company : as for the chits about town, there is no bearing them about one.\" \" Fudge ! \" \" That I know,\" cried Miss Skeggs, \" by experience. For, of the three companions I had this last half year, one of them refused to do plain work an hour in a day ; another thought twenty-five guineas a-year too small a salary ; and I was obliged to send away the third, because I suspected an intrigue with the chaplain. Virtue, my dear Lady Blarney, virtue is worth any price; but where is that to be found ? \" \"Fudge !\" My wife had been, for a long time, all attention to this dis course, but was particularly struck with the latter part of it. Thirty pounds, and twenty-five guineas a-year, made fifty-six pounds five shillings English money, all which was in a manner going a-begging, and might easily be secured in the family. She for a moment studied my looks for approbation; and, to own a truth, I was of opinion that two such places would fit our two daughters exactly. Besides, if the Squire had any 10"], [108, "74 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. real affection for my eldest daughter, this would be the way to make her every way qualified for her fortune. My wife, therefore, was resolved that we should not be deprived of such advantages for want of assurance, and undertook to harangue for the family. \" I hope,\" cried she, \" your Ladyships will pardon my present presumption. It is true, we have no right to pretend to such favours; but yet it is natural for me to wish putting my children forward in the world. And, I will be bold to say, my two girls have had a pretty good education and capacity \u2014 at least the country can't show better. They can read, write, and cast accounts \u2014 they understand their needle, broadstitch, cross and change, and all manner of plain"], [109, "VICAR OF WAKEFIELD, 75 work \u2014 they can piuk, point, and frill, and know something of music \u2014 they can do up small clothes, and work upon catgut \u2014 my eldest can cut paper, and my youngest has a very pretty manner of telling fortunes upon the cards.\" \" Fudge ! \" When she had delivered this pretty piece of eloquence, the two ladies looked at each other a few minutes in silence, with an air of doubt and importance. At last Miss Carolina Wilhelmina Amelia Skeggs condescended to observe, that the young ladies, from the opinion she could form of 'them from so slight an acquaintance, seemed very fit for such employ ments. \" But a thing of this kind, madam,\" cried she, addressing my spouse, \" requires a thorough examination into characters, and a more perfect knowledge of each other. Not, madam,\" continued she, \" that I in the least suspect the young ladies' virtue, prudence, and discretion ; but there is a form in these things, madam \u2014 there is a form.\" My wife approved her suspicions very much, observing that she was very apt to be suspicious herself, but referred her to all the neighbours for a character; but this our Peeress declined as unnecessary, alleging that her cousin Thornhill's recommendation would be sufficient : and upon this we rested our petition"], [110, "CHAPTER XII FORTUNE SEEMS RESOLVED TO HUMBLE THE FAMILY OF WAKE- FIELD.

The only obstacle to our preferment was in obtaining the Squire's recommendation ; but he had already shown us too many instances of his friendship to doubt of it now. Even in bed, my wife kept up the usual theme : \" Well, faith, my dear Charles, between ourselves, I think we have made an excellent day's work of it.\" \u2014 \"Pretty well,\" cried I, not knowing what to say. \"What! only pretty well ? \" returned she : \" I thiuk it is very well.

Entre nous, I protest I like my Lady Blarney vastly \u2014 so very obliging. However, Miss Carolina Wilhelmina Amelia Skeggs has my warm heart. But yet, when they came to talk of places in town, you saw at once how I nailed them. Tell me, my dear, don't you think I did for my children there?\" \u2014 \"Ay,\" returned I, not know ing Avell what to think of the matter ; \" Heaven grant they may be both the better for it this day three months ! \" This was one of those observations I usually made to impress my Avife with an opinion of my sagacity : for if the girls succeed ed, then it was a pious wish fulfilled ; but if any thing unfor tunate, ensued, then it might be looked upon as a prophecy. All this conversation however was only preparatory to another scheme; and, indeed, I dreaded as much. This was nothing less than that, as we were now to hold up our heads a little higher in the Avorld, it would be proper to sell the colt, which was grown old, at a neighbouring fair, and buy us a horse that would carry single, or double upon an occasion, and make a pretty appearance at church, or upon a visit. This at first I opposed stoutly ; but it was as as stoutly defended. However, as I weakened, my antagonist gained strength, till at last it was resolved to part with him. As the fair happened on the following day, I had intentions of going myself; but my Avife persuaded me that I had got a cold, and nothing could prevail upon her to permit me from home. \" No, my dear,\" said she, \" our son Moses is a dis creet boy, and can buy and sell to a very good advantage : you know all our great bargains are of his purchasing.

The business of the toilet being over, we had at last the satisfaction of seeing him mounted upon the colt, with a deal box before him to bring home groceries. He had on a coat made of that cloth they call thunder and lightning, which, though grown too short, was much too good to be thrown away. His waistcoat was of gosling green, and his sisters had tied his hair with a broad black riband. We all followed him several paces from the door, bawling after him, \" Good luck ! good luck ! \" till we could see him no longer. He was scarcely gone, when Mr. Thornhill's butler came to congratulate us upon our good fortune, saying, that he over heard his young master mention our names with great com mendation. Good fortune seemed resolved not to come alone. Another footman from the same family followed, with a card for my daughters, importing, that the two ladies had received such pleasing accounts from Mr. Thornhill of us all, that, after a few previous inquiries, they hoped to be perfectly satisfied. \" Ay,\" cried my wife, \" I now see it is no easy matter to get into the families of the great ; but when one once gets in, then, as Moses says, one may go to sleep.\" To this piece of humour, for she intended it for Avit, my daughters assented with a loud laugh of pleasure. In short, such was her satis faction at this message, that she actually put her hand in her pocket, and gave the messenger sevenpence halfpenny. This Avas to be our visiting day. The next that came was Mr. Burchell, who had been at the fair. He brought my little ones a pennyworth of gingerbread each, Avhich my wife undertook to keep for them, and give them by letters at a time. He brought my daughters also a couple of boxes, in which they might keep wafers, snuff, patches, or even money, when they got it.

When he read the note from the two ladies, he shook his head, and observed, that an affair of this sort de manded the utmost circumspection. This air of diffidence highly displeased my wife. \" 1 never doubted, sir,\" cried she, \" your readiness to be against my daughters and me. You have more circumspection than is wanted. However, I fancy when we come to ask advice, we will apply to persons who seem to have made use of it themselves.\" \u2014 \" Whatever my own conduct may have been, madam,\" replied he, \" is not the present question \u2014 though, as I have made no use of advice myself, I should in conscience give it to those that will.\" As I was apprehensive this answer might draw on a repartee, making up in abuse what it wanted in wit, I changed the subject, by seeming to wonder what could keep our son so long at the fair, as it was now almost nightfall. \" Never mind our son,\" cried my wife ; \" depend upon it he knows what he is about. I'll warrant we'll never see him sell his hen of a rainy day. I have seen him buy such bargains as would amaze one. I'll tell you a good story about that, that will make you split your sides with laughing ; \u2014 but, as I live, yonder comes Moses, without a horse, and the box at his back.\" As she spoke, Moses came slowly on foot, and sweating under the deal box, which he had straps round his shoulders like a pedlar. \" Welcome, welcome, Moses ! well, my boy, what have you brought us from the fair ?\" \u2014 \" I have brought you myself,\" cried Moses, with a sly look, and resting the box on the dresser. \" Ay, Moses,\" cried my wife, \" that we know ; but where is the horse?\" \u2014 \"I have sold him,\" cried Moses, \"for three pounds five shillings and twopence.\" \u2014 \" Well done, my good boy,\" returned she ; \" I knew you would touch them off.

I had them a dead bargain, or I should not have bought them. The silver rims alone will sell for double the money.\" \u2014 \" A fig for the silver rims,\" cried my wife in a passion : \" I dare swear they won't sell for above half the money at the rate of broken silver, five shillings an ounce.\" \" You need be under no uneasiness,\" cried I, \" about selling the rims, for they are not worth sixpence ; for I perceive they are only copper varnished over.\" \u2014 \" What ! \" cried my wife \"not silver ! the rims not silver!\" \u2014 \" No,\" cried I, \"no more silver than your saucepan.\" \u2014 \" And so,\" returned she, \" we have parted Avith the colt, and have only got a gross of green spectacles, with copper rims and shagreen cases !

He now saw that he had been imposed upon by a prowling sharper, who, observing his figure, had marked him for an easy prey. I therefore asked the circumstances of his deception. He sold the horse, it seems, and walked the fair in search of another. A reverend looking man brought him to a tent, under pretence of having one to sell. \" Here,\" continued Moses, \" we met another man, very well dressed, Avho desired to borrow twenty pounds upon these saying that he wanted money, and would dispose of them for a third of the value. The first gentleman, who pretended to be my friend, whis pered me to buy them, and cautioned me not to let so good an offer pass.

They made a bargain, that they would never forsake eacn other, but go seek adventures. The first battle they fought was with two Saracens ; and the dwarf, who was very courageous, dealt one of the champions a most angry blow. It did the Saracen very little injury, who, lifting up his sword, fairly struck off the poor dwarfs arm. He was now in a woful plight; but the giant coming to his assistance, in a short time left the two Saracens dead on the plain, and the dwarf cut off the dead man's head out of spite. They then travelled on to another adventure. This was against three bloody-minded Satyrs, who were carrying away a damsel in distress. The dwarf was not quite so fierce now as before: but for all that struck the first blow, which was returned by another, that knocked out his eye : but the giant was soon up with them, and had they not fled, would certainly have killed them every one. They were all very"], [120, "84 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. joyful for this victory, and the damsel who was relieved fell in love with the giant, and married him. They now travelled far, and farther than I can tell, till they met with a company of robbers. The giant, for the first time, was foremost now; but the dwarf w as not far behind- The battle was stout and long. Wherever the giant came, all fell before him; but the dwarf had like to have been killed more than once. At last the victory declared for the two adventurers ; but the dwarf lost his leg. The dwarf had now lost an arm, a leg, and an eye, while the giant was without a single wound. Upon which he cried out to his little companion, ' My little hero, this is glorious sport ! let us get one victory more, and then we shall have honour for ever.' \u2014 ' No,' cries the dwarf, who was by this time grown wiser, ' no, I declare off ; I'll fight no more : for I find in every battle that you get all the honour and rewards, but all the blows fall upon me.' ' I was going to moralise this fable, when our attention was called off to a warm dispute between my wife and Mr. Burchell, upon my daughters' intended expedition to town. My wife very strenuously insisted upon the advantages that would result from it : Mr. Burchell, on the contrary, dissuaded her with great ardour ; and I stood neuter. His present dissuasions seemed but the second part of those which weie received with so ill a grace in the morning. The dispute grew high ; while poor Deborah, instead of reasoning stronger, talked louder, and at last was obliged to take shelter from a defeat in the clamour. The conclusion of her harrangue, however, was highly displeasing to us all : she knew, she said, of some Avho had their own secret reasons for what they advised ; but, for her part, she wished such to stay away from her house for the future. \" Madam,\" cried Burchell, with looks of great composure, which tended to inflame her the more, \" as for secret reasons, you are right ; I have secret reasons, which I forbear to mention, because you are not able to answer those of which I make no secret ; but I find my visits here are become troublesome ; I'll take my leave therefore now, and perhaps come once more to take a final farewell when I am"], [121, "85 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. quitting the country.\" Thus saying, he took up his hat, nor could the attempts of Sophia, whose looks seemed to upbraid his precipitancy, prevent his going. When gone, we all regarded each other for some minutes with confusion. My wife, who knew herself to be the cause, strove to hide her concern with a forced smile, and an air of assurance, which I was willing to reprove. \" How, woman,\" cried I to her, \" is it thus we treat strangers ? Is it thus we return their kindness ? Be assured, my dear, that these were the harshest words, and to me the most unpleasing, that ever escaped your lips !\" \u2014 \" Why would he provoke me then ?\" replied she ; \" but I know the motives of his advice perfectly well.

We debated there fore, in full council, what were the easiest methods of raising money, or more properly speaking, what we could most con veniently sell. The deliberation was soon finished : it was found that our remaining horse was utterly useless for the plough, without his companion, and equally unfit for the"], [124, "88 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. road, as wanting an eye ; it was therefore determined that we should dispose of him for the purpose above mentioned, at the neighbouring fair, and, to prevent imposition, that 1 should go with him myself. Though this was one of the first mer cantile transactions of my life, yet I had no doubt about acquitting myself with reputation. The opinion a man forms of his own prudence is measured by that of the company he keeps \u2014 and as mine was mostly in the family way, I had con ceived no unfavourable sentiments of my worldly wisdom. My wife, however, next morning, at parting, after I had got some paces from the door, called roe back to advise me, in a whisper, to have all my eyes about me. I had, in the usual forms, when I came to the fair, put my horse through all his paces, but for some time had no bidders. At last a chapman approached, and after he had for a good while examined the horse round, finding him blind of one eye, he would have nothing to say to him \u2014 a second came up, but observing he had a spavin, declared he would not take him for the driving home \u2014 a third perceived he had a wind- gall, and would bid no money \u2014 a fourth knew by his eye that he had the botts \u2014 a fifth wondered what a plague I could do at the fair with a blind, spavined, galled hack, that was only fit to be cut up for a dog kennel. By this time I began to have a most hearty contempt for the poor animal myself, and was almost ashamed at the approach of every customer : for though I did not entirely believe all the fellows told me, yet I reflected that the number of witnesses was a strong presumption they were right \u2014 and St. Gregory, upon Good Works, professes himself to be of the same opinion. I was in this mortifying situation, when a brother clergy man, an old acquaintance, who had also business at the fair, came up, and, shaking me by the hand, proposed adjourning to a public house, and taking a glass of whatever we could get. I readily closed with the offer, and, entering an alehouse, we were shewn into a little back room, where there was only a venerable old man, who sat wholly intent over a large book, which he was reading. I never in my life saw a figure that"], [125, "VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. 89 prepossessed me more favourably. His locks of silver grey venerably shaded his temples, and his green old age seemed to be the result of health and benevolence. However, hi\u00b0 presence did not interrupt our conversation : my friend and I discoursed on the various turns of fortune we had met \u2014 the Whistonian controversy, my last pamphlet, the archdeacon's reply, and the hard measure that was dealt me. But our 12"], [126, "90 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. attention was in a short time taken off by the appearance of a youth, who, entering the room, respectfully said something softlv to the old stranger. \" Make no apologies, my child,\" said the old man ; \" to do good is a duty we owe to all out fellow creatures \u2014 take this, I wish it were more ; but five pounds will relieve your distress, and you are welcome.\" The modest youth shed tears of gratitude, and yet his gratitude was scarcely equal to mine. I could have hugged the good old man in my arms, his benevolence pleased me so. He continued to read, and we resumed our conversation, until my companion, after some time, recollecting that he had busi- ness to transact in the fair, promised to be soon back ; adding, that he always desired to have as much of Dr. Primrose's com- pany as possible. The old gentleman hearing my name men- tioned, seemed to look at me with attention for some time, and when my friend was gone, most respectfully demanded if I was any way related to the great Primrose, that courageous monogamist, who had been the bulwark of the church. Never did my heart feel sincerer rapture than at that moment. \" Sir,\" cried I, \" the applause of so good a man as I am sure you are, adds to that happiness in my breast Avhich your bene- volence has already excited. You behold before you, sir, that Dr. Primrose, the monogamist, whom you have been pleased to call great.

We talked upon several subjects : at first I thought he seemed rather devout than learned, and began to think he despised all human doctrines as dross. Yet this no way lessened him in my esteem, for I had for some time begun privately to harbour such an opinion myself. I therefore took occasion to observe, that the world in general began to be blameably indifferent as to doctrinal matters, and followed human speculations too much. \" Ay, sir,\" repfied he, as if he had reserved all his learning to that moment, \" ay, sir, the world is in its dotage ; and yet the cosmogony, or creation of the word, has puzzled philosophers of all ages. What a medley of opinions have they not broached upon the creation of the world ! Sanchoniathan, Manetho, Berosus, and Ocellus Lucanus, have all attempted it in vain. The latter has these words, Anarchon ara kai atelutaion to pan, which imply that all things have neither beginning nor end. Manetho also, who lived about the time of Nebuchadon-Asser \u2014 Asser being a Syriac word, usually applied as a surname to the kings of that country, as Teglat Phael-Asser, Nabon- Asser \u2014 he, I say, formed a conjecture equally absurd ; for, as we usually say, Ek to biblion kubernetes, which implies that books will never teach the world, so he attempted to investigate But, sir, I ask pardon, I am straying from the question.\" That he actually was ; nor could I, for my life, see how the creation of the world had anything to do with the business I was talking of; but it was sufficient to shew me that he was a man of letters, and I now reverenced him the more. I was resolved, therefore, to bring him to the touchstone ; but lie was too mild and too gentle to contend for victory. Whenever I made an observation that looked like a challenge to contro- versy, he would smile, shake his head, and say nothing ; by which I understood he could say much, if he thought proper. The subject, therefore, insensibly changed from the business of antiquity to that which brought us both to the fair : mine, I told him, was to sell a horse, and very luckily, indeed, his was to buy one for one of his tenants. My horse was soon produced ; and, in fine, Ave struck a bargain. Nothing now"], [128, "92 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. remained but to pay me, and he accordingly pulled out a thirty pound note, and bid me change it. Not being in a capacity of complying with this demand, he ordered his footman to be called up, who made his appearance in a very genteel livery. \" Here, Abraham,\" cried he, \" go and get gold for this ; you'll do it at neighbour Jackson's, or any where.\" While the fellow was gone, he entertained me with a pathetic harangue on the great scarcity of silver, which I undertook to improve by deploring also the great scarcity of gold; so that, by the time Abraham returned, we had both agreed that money was never so hard to be come at as now: Abraham returned to inform us, that he had been over the whole fair, and could not get change, though he had offered half-a-crown for doing it. This was a very great disappoint ment to us all ; but the old gentleman, having paused a little, asked me if I knew one Solomon Flamborough in my part of the country. Upon replying that he was my next door neighbour: \" If that be the case, then,\" returned he, \" I believe we shall deal. You shall have a draft upon him, payable at sight ; and, let me tell you, he is as warm a man as any within five miles round him. Honest Solomon and I have been acquainted for many years together. I remember, I always beat him at three jumps ; but he could hop on one leg farther than I.\" A draft upon my neighbour was to me the same as money; for I was sufficiently convinced of his ability. The draft was signed, and put into my hands, and Mr. Jenkinson, the old gentleman, his man Abraham, and my horse old Blackberry, trotted off very well pleased with each other. After a short interval, being left to reflection, I began to recollect that I had done wrong in taking a draft from a stran ger, and so prudently resolved upon following the purchaser, and having back my horse. But this was now too late : I therefore made directly homewards, resolving to get the draft changed into money at my friend's as fast as possible.

My wife and girls were all in tears, Mr. Thornhill having been there that day to inform them that their journey to town was entirely over. The two ladies having heard reports of us from some malicious person about us, were that day set out for London. He could neither discover the ten dency, nor the author of these ; but whatever they might be, or whoever might have broached them, he continued to assure our family of his friendship and protection. I found, there fore, that they bore my disappointment with great resignation. as it was eclipsed in the greatness of their own.

As we were in this perplexity, one of our little boys, who had been playing abroad, brought in a letter case, which he found on the green. It was quickly known to belong to Mr. Burchell, with whom it had been seen, and, upon examination, contained some hints upon different sub jects ; but what particularly engaged our attention was a sealed note, superscribed, \" The copy of a letter to be sent to the two ladies at Thornhill Castle.\" It instantly occurred that he was the base informer, and we deliberated whether the note should not be broken open. I was against it ; but Sophia, who said she was sure that of all men he would be"], [132, "96 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD, the last to be guilty of so much baseness, insisted upon its being read. In this she was seconded by the rest of the family, and, at their joint solicitation, I read as follows : \u2014 \" Ladies \u2014 The bearer will sufficiently satisfy you as to the person from whom this comes \u2014 one at least the friend of innocence, and ready to prevent its being seduced. I am informed for a truth, that you have some intention of bringing two young ladies to town, whom I have some knowledge of, under the character of companions. As I would neither have simplicity imposed upon, nor virtue contaminated, I must offer it as my opinion, that the impropriety of such a step will be attended with dangerous consequences. It has never been my way to treat the infamous or the lewd with severity ; nor should I now have taken this method of explaining my self, or reproving folly, did it not aim at guilt. Take, there fore, the admonition of a friend, and seriously reflect on the consequences of introducing infamy and vice into retreats where peace and innocence have hitherto resided.\" Our doubts were now at an end. There seemed, indeed, something applicable to both sides in this letter, and its cen sures might as well be referred to those to whom it was written as to us ; but the malicious meaning Avas obvious, and we went no farther. My wife had scarcely patience to hear me to the end, but railed at the writer with unrestrained resentment. Olivia was equally severe, and Sophia seemed perfectly amazed at his baseness. As for my part, it appeared to me one of the vilest instances of unprovoked ingratitude I had ever met with ; nor could I account for it in any other manner than by imputing it to his desire us detaining my youngest daughter in the country, to have the more frequent opportunities of an interview. In this manner we all sat ruminating upon schemes of vengeance, when our other little boy came running in to tell us that Mr. Burchell was approach ing at the other end of the field.

For this purpose we agreed to meet him with our usual smiles \u2014 to chat in the beginning with more than ordinary kindness, to amuse him a little \u2014 and then, in the midst of the flattering calm, to burst upon him like an earthquake, and overwhelm him with a sense of his own baseness. This being resolved upon, my wife undertook to manage the business herself, as she really had some talents for such an undertaking. We saw him approach \u2014 he en- tered, drew7 a chair, and sat down. \"A fine day, Mr. Burchell,\" \" A. very fine day, doctor ; though I fancy we shall have some rain by the shooting of my corns.\" \u2014 \" The shooting of your 13"], [134, "98 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. horns !\" cried my wife, in a loud fit of laughter, and then asked pardon for being fond of a joke. \" Dear Madam,\" replied he, \" I pardon you with all my heart, for I protest, I should not have thought it a joke had you not told me.\" \u2014 \" Perhaps not, sir,\" cried my wife, winking at us ; \" and yet I dare say you can tell us how many jokes go to an ounce.\" \u2014 \" I fancy, Madam,\" returned Burchell, \" you have been read ing a jest-book this morning, that ounce of jokes is so very good a conceit ; and yet, Madam, I had rather see half an ounce of understanding.\" \u2014 \" I believe you might,\" cried my wife, still smiling at us, though the laugh was against her ; \" and yet I have seen some men pretend to understanding that have very little.\" \u2014 \" And no doubt,\" returned her an tagonist, \" you have known ladies set up for wit that had none.\" I quickly began to find that my wife was likely to gain but little at this business; so I resolved to treat him in a style of more severity myself. \" Both wit and understanding,\" cried I, \" are trifles, without integrity \u2014 it is that which gives value to every character. The ignorant peasant without fault is greater than the philosopher with many; for what is genius or courage without a heart ? 'An honest man 's the noblest work of God.' \" I always held that hacknied maxim of Pope,\" returned Mr. Burchell, \" as very unworthy a man of genius, and a base desertion of his own superiority. As the reputation of books is raised, not by their freedom from defect, but the greatness of their beauties, so should that of men be prized, not for their exception from fault, but the size of those virtues they are possessed of.

This rule seems to extend even to other animals \u2022 the little vermin race are ever treacherous, cruel and cow ardly, whilst those endowed with strength and power are generous, brave and gentle.\" \" These observations sound well,\" returned I, \" and yet it would be easy this moment to point out a man\"\u2014 and I fixed my eye stedfastly upon him-\" whose head and heart form a most detestable contrast.

Don't you know, now, I could hang you all for this ? All that I have to do is to swear at the next Justice's that you have been guilty of breaking open the lock of my pocket-book, and so hang you all up at this door.\" This piece of unexpected insolence raised me to such a pitch that I could scarcely govern my passion. \" Ungrateful wretch ! begone, and no longer pollute my dwelling with thy baseness ! begone, and never let me see thee again ! Go from my door,"], [136, "100 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD and the only punishment I Avish thee is an alarmed conscience, which will be a sufficient tormentor !\" So saying, I threw him his pocket-book, which he took up with a smile, and shutting the clasps with the utmost composure, left us, quite astonished at the serenity of his assurance. My wife Avas particularly en raged that nothing could make him angry, or make him seem ashamed of his villanies. \" My dear,\" cried I, willing to calm those passions that had been raised too high among us, \" we are not to be surprised that bad men want shame : they only"], [137, "A7ICAR OF AVAKEF1ELD 101 blush at being detected in doing good, but glory in their vices. \" Guilt and Shame, says the allegory, were at first com panions, and in the beginning of their journey, inseparably kept together. But their union was soon found to be disa greeable and inconvenient to both. Guilt gave Shame frequent uneasiness, and Shame often betrayed the secret conspiracies of Guilt. After long disagreement, therefore, they at length consented to part for ever. Guilt boldly walked forward alone, to overtake Fate, that went before in the shape of an execu tioner; but Shame, being naturally timorous, returned back to keep company with Virtue, which in the beginning of their journey they had left behind.

Though he - had been disappointed in procuring my daughters the amusements of the town, as he designed, he took every opportunity of supplying them with those little recreations which our retirement would admit of. He usually came in the morning ; and, while my son and I followed our occupations abroad, he sat with the family at home, and amused them by describing the town, with every part of which he was particularly acquainted. He could"], [139, "103 A71CAR OF AVAKEFIEI.D. repeat all the observations that were retailed in the atmos phere of the playhouses, and had all the good things of the high wits by rote, long before they made their way into the jest-books. The intervals between conversation were employed in teaching my daughters piquet, or sometimes in setting my two little ones to box, to make them sharp, as he called it : but the hopes of having him for a son-in-law, in some measure blinded us to all his imperfections. It must be owned, thnt my wife laid a thousand schemes to entrap him ; or, to speak more tenderly, used every art to magnify the merit of her daughter. If the cakes ate tea at short and crisp, they were made by Olivia ; if the gooseberry wine was well knit, the gooseberries were of her gathering ; it Avas her fingers which gave the pickles their peculiar green ; and in the composition of a pudding, it was her judgment that mixed the ingredients. Then the poor woman would sometimes tell the Squire, that she thought him and Olivia extremely of and size, a would bid both stand up to see which was tallest. These instances of cunning, which she thought impenetrable, yet which every body saw through, were very pleasing to our benefactor, who gave every day some new proofs of his passion, which though they had not arisen to proposals of marriage, yet we thought fell but little short of it ; and his slowness was attri buted sometimes to native bashfulness, and sometimes to his fear of offending his uncle. An occurrence, however, which happened soon after, put it beyond a doubt that he designed to become one of our family; my wife even regarded it as an absolute promise. My wife and daughters happening to return a visit at neighbour Flamborough's, found that family had lately got their pictures drawn by a limner, who travelled the country, and took likenesses for fifteen shillings a-head. As this family and ours had long a sort of rivalry in point of taste, our spirit took the alarm at this stolen march upon us ; and, notwithstanding all I could say, and I said much, it was resolved that we should have our pictures done too. Having, thei fore, engaged the limner \u2014 for what could I do? \u2014 our"], [140, "104 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. next deliberation was to shew the superiority of our taste in the attitudes. As for our neighbour's family, there were seven of them, and they were drawn with seven oranges \u2014 a thing quite out of taste, no variety in life, no composition in the world. We desired to have something in a brighter style ; and, after many debates, at length came to a unamimous reso- lution of being drawn together, in one large historical family piece. This would be cheaper, since one frame would serve for all, and it would be infinitely more genteel ; for all families of any taste were now draAvn in the same manner. As we did not immediately recollect a historical subject to hit us, we were contented each with being drawn as independant histo- rical figures. My wife desired to be represented as Venus, and the painter was requested not to be too frugal of his dia- monds in her stomacher and hair. Her two little ones were to be as Cupids by her side ; while I, in my gown and band, was to present her with my books on the Whistonian contro- versy. Olivia would be drawn as an Amazon, sitting upon a bank of flowers, dressed in a green Joseph richly laced with gold, and a whip in her hand. Sophia was to be a shepherdess. with as many sheep as the painter could put in for nothing ; and Moses was to be dressed out with a hat and white feather, Our taste so much pleased the Squire, that he insisted on be- ing put in as one of the family, in the character of Alexander the Great at Olivia's feet. This was considered by us all as an indication of his desire to be introduced into the family, nor could we refuse his request. The painter was therefore set to work, and, as he wrought with assiduity and expedition, in less than four days the whole was completed. The piece was large, and it must be owned he did not spare his colours ; for which my wife gave him great encomiums. We were all per- fectly satisfied with his performance ; but an unfortunate cir cumstance,which had not occurred till the picture was finished, now struck us with dismay. It was so very large, that we had no place in the house where to fix it. How we all came to disregard so material a point, is inconceivable ! but certain it is, we had been all greatly remiss. The picture, therefore,"], [141, "VICVR OF AVAKEFIELD. 105 instead of gratisying our vanity, as we hoped, leaned, in a most mortifying manner, against the kitchen wall, Avhere the canvass was stretched and painted, much too large to be got through any of the doors, and the jest of all our neighbours. One compared it to Robinson Crusoe's long boat, too large to be removed ; another thought it more resembled a reel in p bottle : some wondered how it could be got out, but still more how it got in. U"], [142, "\u25a0i oa VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. But though it excited the ridicule of some, it effectually raised more malicious suggestions in many. The Squire's portrait being found united with ours, was an honour too great to escape envy. Scandalous whispers began to circulate at our expense, and our tranquillity was continually disturbed by persons, who came as friends to tell us what was said of us by enemies. These reports we always resented with becoming spirit ; but scandal ever improves by opposition. We once again, therefore, entered into a consultation upon obviating the malice of our enemies, and at last came to a resolution which had too much cunning to give me entire satisfaction. It was this : as our principal object was to dis- cover the honour of Mr. Thornhill's addresses, my wife under- took to sound him, by pretending to ask his advice, in the choice of a husband for her eldest daughter. If this was not found sufficient to induce him to a declaration, it was then resolved to terrify him with a rival. To this last step, how- ever, I would by no means give my consent, till Olivia gave me the most solemn assurances that she would marry the person provided to rival him upon this occasion, if he did not prevent it by taking her himself. Such was the scheme laid, which, though I did not strenuously oppose, I did not entirely approve. The next time, therefore, that Mr. Thornhill came to see us my girls took care to be out of the way, in order to giA7e their mamma an opportunity of putting her scheme into execution ; but they only retired to the next room, whence they could overhear the whole conversation. My wife artfully intro duced it by observing, that one of the Miss Flamborough's Avas like to have a very good match of it in Mr. Spanker. To this the Squire assenting, she proceeded to remark, that, they who had warm fortunes were always sure of getting good husbands : \" But Heaven help,\" continued she, \" the girls that have none ! What signifies beauty, Mr. Thornhill ? or Avhat signifies all the virtue, and all the qualifications in the world, in this age of self-interest ? It is not. What is she ? but What has she ? is all the cry.\""], [143, "VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. 107 \" Madam,\" returned he, \" I highly approve the justice, as well as the novelty, of your remarks, and if I were a king, it should be otherwise. It should then, indeed, be fine times Avith the girls without fortunes \u2014 our two young ladies should be the first for whom I Avould provide.\" \" Ah, sir,\" returned my wife, \" you are pieased to be facetious; but I wish I were a queen, and then I know where my eldest daughter should look for a husband. But, now that you have put it into my head seriously, Mr. Thornhill, can't you recommend me a proper husband for her ? she is now nineteen years' old, well grown, and well educated, and. in my humble opinion, does not Avant for parts.\""], [144, "108 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. \" Madam,\" replied he, \" if I were to choose, I would find out a person possessed of every accomplishment that can make an angel happy. One with prudence, fortune, taste, and sin cerity; such, madam, would be, in my opinion, the proper husband.\" \u2014 \" Ay, sir,\" said she, \" but do you know of any such person ?\" \u2014 \" No, madam,\" returned he, \" it is impossi ble to know any person that deserves to be her husband : she's too great a treasure for one man's possession \u2014 she's a goddess ! Upon my soul, I speak what I think \u2014 she's an angel !\" \u2014 \" Ah, Mr. Thornhill, you only flatter my poor girl \u2014 but Ave have been thinking of marrying her to one of your tenants, whose mother is lately dead, and who wants a manager \u2014 you know whom I mean \u2014 farmer WTilliams : a warm man, Mr. Thornhill, able to give her good bread, and who has several times made her proposals,\" (which was actually the case) \u2014 \" but, sir,\" concluded she, \" I should be glad to have your approbation of our choice.\" \u2014 \" How, madam,\" replied he, \" my approbation ! \u2014 my approbation of such a choice ? Never. What ! sacrifice so much beauty, and sense, and goodness, to a creature insensible of the blessing ! Excuse me, I can never approve of such a piece of injustice ! And I have my reasons.\" \" Indeed, sir,\" cried Deborah, \" if you have your reasons, that's another affair ; but I should be glad to know these"], [145, "109 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. reasons.\" \u2014 \" Excuse me, madam,\" returned he ; \" they lie too deep for discovery,\" (laying his hand upon his bosom) \u2014 \" they remain buried, rivetted here.\" After he was gone, upon a general consultation we could not tell what to make of these fine sentiments. Olivia con sidered them as instances of the most exalted passion ; but 1 was not quite so sanguine \u2014 it seemed to me pretty plain, that they had more of love than matrimony in them; yet whatever they might portend, it was resolved to prosecute the scheme of Farmer Williams, who, from my daughter's first appearance in the country, had paid her his addresses."], [146, "CHAPTER XVII SCARCELY ANY VIRTUE FOUND TO RESIST THE POWER OF LONG AND PLEASING TEMPTATION s I only studied my child's real happiness, the assiduity of Mr. Williams pleased me, as he was in easy circumstances, prudent, and sincere. It required but very little encouragement to revive his former passion \u2014 so that in an evening or two he and Mr. Thorn hill met at our house, and surveyed each other for some time with looks of anger ; but Williams owed his landlord no rent, and little regarded his indignation. Olivia, on her side, acted the coquette to per fection, if that might be called acting which was her real character, pretending to lavish all her tenderness on her new lover. Mr. Thornhill appeared quite dejected at this prefer ence, and with a pensive air took leave, though I own it"], [147, "111 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. puzzled me to find him in so much pain as he appeared to be, when he had it in his power so easily to remove the caus;e, by declaring an honourable passion. But whatever uneasiness he seemed to endure, it could easily be perceived that Olivia's anguish Avas still greater. After any of these interviews between her lovers, of which there were several, she usually retired to solitude, and there indulged her grief. It Avas in was in such a situation I found her one evening, after she had been for some time supporting a fictitious gaiety. \" You now see my child,\" said I, \" that your confidence in Mr. Thornhill's passion Avas all a dream : he permits the rivalry of another, every way his inferior, though he knows it lies in his power to secure you to himself by a candid declaration.\" \u2014 \" Yes, papa,\" returned she ; \" but he has his reasons for this delay: I know he has. The sincerity of his looks and Avords convinces me of his real esteem. A short time, I hope, will discover the generosity of his sentiments, and convince you that my opinion of him has been more just than yours.\"\u2014\" Olivia,"], [148, "112 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. my darling,\" returned I, \" every scheme that has been hitherto pursued to compel him to a declaration, has been proposed and planned by yourself, nor can you in the least say that I have constrained you. But you must not suppose, my dear, that I will ever be instrumental in suffering his honest rival to be the dupe of your ill-placed passion. What ever time you require to bring your fancied admirer to an explanation shall be granted; but at the expiration of that term, if he is still regardless, I must absolutely insist that honest Mr. Williams shall be rewarded for his fidelity. The character which I have hitherto supported in life demands this from me, and my tenderness as a parent shall never influence my integrity as a man. Name, then, your day; let it be as distant as you think proper ; and in the meantime, take care to let Mr. Thornhill know the exact time on which I design delivering you up to another. If he really loves you, his own good sense will readily suggest that there is but one method alone to prevent his losing you for ever.\" This proposal, which she could not avoid considering as perfectly just, was readily agreed to. She again reneAved her most positive promise of marrying Mr. Williams, in case of the other's insensibility; and at the next opportunity, in Mr. Thornhill's presence, that day month was fixed upon for her nuptials with his rival. Such vigorous proceedings seemed to redouble Mr. Thorn hill's anxiety: but what Olivia really felt gave me some uneasiness. In this struggle between prudence and passion, her vivacity quite forsook her, and every opportunity of solitude was sought, and spent in tears. One week passed away; but Mr. Thornhill made no efforts to restrain her nuptials. The succeeding week he was still assiduous, but not more open. On the third, he discontinued his visits entirely, and instead of my daughter testifying any impatience, as I expected, she seemed to retain a pensive tranquillity, which I looked upon as resignation. For my own part, I was now sincerely pleased Avith thinking that my child was going to be secured in a continuance of competence and peace, and"], [149, "113 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. frequently applauded her resolution in preferring happiness to ostentation. It was within about four days of her intended nuptials, that my little family at night were gathered round a charming fire, telling stories of the past, and laying schemes for the future \u2014 busied in forming a thousand projects, and laughing at whatever folly came uppermost. \" Well, Moses,\" cried I, \" we shall soon, my boy, have a wedding in the family : what is your opinion of matters and things in general ? \u2014 \" My opinion, father, is, that all things go on very well ; and I was just now thinking, that when sister Livy is married to farmer Williams, we shall then have the loan of his cyder-press and 15"], [150, "114 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. brewing tubs for nothing.\"\u2014\" That we shall, Moses,\" cried I, \" and he will sing us ' Death and the Lady,' to raise our spirits into the bargain.\"\u2014\" He has taught that song to our Dick,\" cried Moses ; \" and I think he goes through it very prettily.\" \" Does he so ?\" cried I ; \" then let us have it : where is little Dick? let him up with it boldly.\"\u2014 \" My brother Dick,\" cried Bill, my youngest, \" is just gone out with sister Livy : but Mr. Williams has taught me two songs and I'll sing them for you, papa. Which song do you choose, the ' Dying Swan,' or the ' Elegy on the Death of a Mad Dog' ? \"\u2014\" The elegy, child, by all means,\" said I ; \" I never heard that yet ; and Deborah, my life, grief you know is dry ; let us have a bottle of the best gooseberry wine, to keep up our spirits.

And in that town a dog was found, As many dogs there be, Both mongrel, puppy, whelp, and hound, And curs of low degree. This dog and man at first were friends ; But when a pique began, The dog, to gain his private ends, Went mad, and bit the man. Around from all the neighbouring streets The wondering neighbours ran, And swore the dog had lost his wits, To bite so good a man. The wound it seem'd both sore and sad To every Christian eye ; And while they swore the dog was mad, They swore the man would die. But soon a wonder came to light, That show'd the rogues they lied The man recover'd of the bite \u2014 The dog it was that died. \"A very good boy, Bill, upon my word; and an elegy that may truly be called tragical.

Put the glass to your brother, Moses. The great fault of these elegiasts is, that they are in despair for griefs that give the sensible part of mankind very little pain.

Colin meets Dolly, and they hold a dialogue together; he gives her a fairing to put in her hair, and she presents him with a nose gay ; and then they go together to church, where they give good advice to young nymphs and swains to get married as fast as they can.\" \"And very good advice, too,\" cried I; \"and I am told there is not a place in the world where advice can be given with so much propriety as there \u2014 for, as it persuades us to marry, it also furnishes us with a wife ; and surely that must be an excellent market, my boy, where we are told what we want, and supplied with it when wanting.\" \" Yes, sir,\" returned Moses, \" and I know but of two such markets for wives in Europe \u2014 Ranelagh in England, and Fontarabia in Spain. The Spanish market is open once a-year, but our English wives are saleable every night.\" \" You are right, my boy,\" cried his mother ; \" Old England is the only place in the world for husbands to get wives.\" \u2014 \" And for wives to manage their husbands,\" interrupted I, \" It is a proverb abroad, that if a bridge were built across the sea, all the ladies of the continent wordd come over to take pattern from ours ; for there are no such wives in Europe as our own.

He soon ap- peared with the most open familiar air, and seemed perfectly amazed at my daughter's elopement, protesting, upon his honour, that he was quite a stranger to it. I now therefore condemned my former suspicions, and could turn them only on Mr. Burchell, who, I recollected, had of late several private conferences with her ; but the appearance of another witness left me no room to doubt his villany, who averred, that he and my daughter were actually gone towards the Wells, about thirty miles off, where there was a great deal of company.

I walked along with earnestness, and inquired of several by the way ; but received no accounts, till, entering the town, I was met by a person on horseback, whom I remem- bered to have seen at the Squire's, and he assured me that if I followed them to the races^ which were but thirty miles farther, I might depend upon overtaking them ; for he had seen them dance there the niglt before, and the whole assem- bly seemed charmed with my daughter's performance. Early the next day, I walked forward to the races, and about four in the afternoon, I came upon the course. The company made a very brilliant appearance, all earnestly employed in one pursuit \u2014 that of pleasure : how different from mine \u2014 that of reclaiming a lost child to virtue ! I thought I per- ceived Mr. Burchell at some distance from me ; but, as if he dreaded an interview, upon my approaching him, he mixed among a crowd, and I saw him no more. I now reflected that it would be to no purpose to continue my pursuit farther, and resolved to return home to an inno cent family, who wanted my assistance. But the agitations of my mind, and the fatigues I had undergone, threw me into a fever, the symptoms of which I perceived before I came off"], [161, "123 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. the course. This was another unexpected stroke, as I was more than seventy miles distant from home : however, I retired to a little alehouse by the roadside ; and in this place, the usual retreat of indigence and frugality, I laid me down patiently to Avait the issue of my disorder. I languished here for nearly three weeks ; but at last my constitution prevailed, though I was unprovided Avith money to defray the expense of"], [162, "124 VICAR OF AVAKEF1ELD. my entertainment. It is possible the anxiety from this last circumstance alone might have brought on a relapse, had I not been supplied by a traveller, who stopped to take a cursory refreshment. This person was no other than the philanthropic bookseller in St. Paul's Churchyard, who has written so many little books for children : he called himself their friend, but he was the friend of all mankind. He was no sooner alighted but he Avas in haste to be gone ; for he Avas ever on business of the utmost importance, and was at that time actually compiling materials for the history of one Mr. Thomas Trip. I imme- diately recollected this good-natured man's red pimpled face, for he had published for me against the deuterogamists of the\" age ; and from him I borrowed a few pieces, to be paid at my return. Leaving the inn, therefore, as I was vet but weak, I"], [163, "125 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. resolved to return home by easy journies of ten miles a-day. My health and usual tranquillity were almost restored, and I now condemned that pride Avhich had made me refractory to the hand of correction. Man little knows what calamities are beyond his patience to bear, till he tries them : as in ascending the heights of ambition, which look bright from below, every step we rise shows us some neAv and gloomy prospect of hidden disappointment ; so, in our descent from the summits of pleasure, though the vale of misery beloAv may appear at first dark and gloomy, yet the busy mind, still attentive to its own amusement, finds, as we descend, something to flatter and to please. Still as we approach, the darkest objects appear to brighten, and the mental eye becomes adapted to its gloomy situation. I now proceeded forward, and had Avalked about two hours, Avhen I perceived what appeared at a distance like a wagon, which I was resolved to overtake ; but when I came up with it, found it to be a strolling company's cart that was carrying their scenes and other theatrical furniture to the next village, where they were to exhibit. The cart was attended only by the person who drove it and one of the company, as the rest"], [164, "126 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. of the players were to follow the ensuing day. \" Good com pany upon the road,\" says the proverb, \" is the shortest cut.\" I therefore entered into conversation with the poor player ; and as I once had some theatrical powers myself, I disserted 0n such topics with my usual freedom ; but as I was pretty much unacquainted with the present state of the stage, I demanded who were the present theatrical writers in vogue \u2014 Avho the Drydens and Otways of the day? \u2014 \"I fancy, sir,\" cried the player, \" few of our modern dramatists would think themselves much honoured by being compared to the writers you mention. Dryden's and RoAve's manner, sir, are quite out of fashion \u2014 our taste has gone back a whole century \u2014 Fletcher, Ben Jonson, and all the plays of Shakspere, are the only things that go down.\" \u2014 \"How,\" cried I, \" is it possible the present age can be pleased with that antiquated dialect, that obsolete humour, those overcharged characters, AA7hich abound in the works you mention?\" \u2014 \" Sir,\" returned my companion, \" the public think nothing about dialect or humour, or charac ter, for that is none of their business ; they only go to be amused, and find themselves happy when they can enjoy a pantomime, under the sanction of Jonson's or Shakspere 's name.\" \u2014 \" So then, I suppose,\" cried I, \" that our modern dramatists are rather imitators of Shakspere than of nature.'' \" To say the truth,\" returned my companion, \" I don't know that they imitate any thing at all \u2014 nor indeed, does the public require it of them ; it is not the composition of the piece, but the number of starts and attitudes that may be introduced into it, that elicit applause. 1 have known a piece, with not one jest in the AA7hole, shrugged into popularity, and another saved by the poet's throwing in a fit of the gripes. No, sir, the works of Congreve and Farquhar have too much wit in them for the present taste ; our modern dialect is much more natural.\" By this time the equipage of the strolling company was arrived at the A7illage, which, it seems, had been apprised of our approach, and was come out to gaze at us ; for my com panion observed, that strollers always haA-e more spectators"], [165, "VICAR OF WAKEFIELD 127 without doors than within. I did not consider the impropriety of my being in such company, till I saw a crowd gather about me. I therefore took shelter, as fast as possible, in the first alehouse that offered ; and' being sliOAVn into the common room, was accosted by a very well dressed gentleman, who demanded whether I was the real chaplain of the company, or Avhether it was only to be my masquerade character in the play ? Upon my informing him of the truth, and that I did not belong in any sort to the company, he was condescending enough to desire me and the player to partake in a bowl of punch, over which he discussed modern politics with great earnestness and interest. I set him down, in my own mind, for nothing less than a parliament-man at least ; but Avas almost confirmed"], [166, "128 VICAR OF AVAKEFIEt.D. my conjectures, when upon asking Avhat there Avas in the house for supper, he insisted that the player and I should sup with him at his house ; with which request, after some entreaties, we Avere prevailed on to comply."], [167, "CHAPTER XIX THE DESCRIPTION OF A PERSON DISCONTENTED WITH THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT, AND APPREHENSIVE OF THE LOSS OF OUR LIBERTIES. The house where we were to be I entertained lying at a small distance from the village, our inviter obser- ved, that as the coach was not ready, he would conduct us on foot ; and we soon arrived at one of the most magnificent mansions I had seen in that part of the country. The apartment into which we were shown was perfectly ele gant and modern : he went to give orders for supper, while the player, with a wink, observed that we were perfectly in luck. Our entertainer soon returned ; an elegant supper was brought in ; two or three ladies in easy dishabille were intro duced, and the conversation began with some sprightliness. Politics, however, was the subject on which our entertainer chiefly expatiated ; for he asserted that liberty was at once 17"], [168, "130 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. his boast and his terror. After the cloth was removed, he asked me if I had seen the last Monitor ? to which, replying in the negative, \" What ! nor the Auditor, I suppose ?\" cried he. \" Neither, sir,\" returned I. \" That's strange, very strange !\" replied my entertainer ! \u2014 \" now, I read all the poli tics that come out : the Daily, the Public, the Ledger, the Chronicle, the London Evening, the Whitehall Evening, the seventeen Magazines, and the two Reviews ; and though they hate each other, I love them all. Liberty, sir, liberty, is the Briton's boast ! and, by all my coal mines in Cornwall, I reve rence its guardians.\" \u2014 \"Then it is to be hoped,\" cried I, \" you reverence the king ?\" \u2014 \" Yes,\" returned my entertainer, \" when he does what we would have him ; but if he goes on as he has done of late, I'll never trouble myself more with his matters. I say nothing ; I think, only, I could have directed some things better. I don't think there has been a sufficient number of advisers ; he should advise with every person Avilling to give him adAdce, and then we should have things done in another guess manner.\" \" I Avish,\" cried I, \" that such intruding advisers were fixed in the pillory. It should be the duty of honest men to assist the weaker side of our constitution, that sacred power which has for some years been every day declining, and losing its due share of influence in the state. But these ignorants still continue the same cry of liberty, and, if they have any weight, basely throw it into the subsiding scale.\" \" How !\" cried one of the ladies, \" do I live to see one so base, so sordid, as to be an enemy to liberty, and a defender of tyrants ? \u2014 liberty, that sacred gift of Heaven, that glorious privilege of Britons !\" \" Can it be possible,\" cried our entertainer, \" that there should be any found at present advocates for slavery ? \u2014 any who are for meanly giving up the privileges of Britons ? Can any, sir, be so abject ?\" \" No, sir,\" replied I, \" I am for liberty, that attribute of gods ! Glorious liberty ! that theme of modern declamation. I would have all men kings. I would be a king myself. We have all"], [169, "131 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. naturally an equal right to the throne : we are all originally equal. This is my opinion, and was once the opinion of a set of honest men who were called Levellers. They tried to erect themselves into a community, where all should be equally free. But, alas ! it would never answer : for there were some among them stronger, and some more cunning, than others, and these became masters of the rest ; for, as sure as your groom rides your horses, because he is a cunninger animal than they, so surely will the animal that is cunninger or stronger than he, sit upon his shoulders in turn. Since, then, it is entailed upon humanity to submit, and some are born to command and others to obey, the question is, as there must be tyrants, whether it is better to have them in the same house with us, or in the same village, or still further off in the metropolis. Noav, sir, for my oaati part, as I naturally hate the face of a tyrant, the farther off he is removed from me, the better pleased am I. The generality of mankind also are of my way of thinking, and have unanimously created one king, whose election at once diminishes the number of tyrants and puts tyranny at the greatest distance from the greatest number of people. Now, the great, who were tyrants them selves before the election of one tyrant, are naturally averse to a power raised over them, and whose weight must ever lean heaviest on the subordinate orders. It is the interest of the great, therefore, to diminish kingly power as much as pos sible ; because, whatever they take from that, is naturally restored to themselves ; and all they have to do in the state, is to undermine the single tyrant, by which they resume their primeval authority. Now, the state may be so circumstanced, or its laws may be so disposed, or its men of opulence so minded, as all to conspire in carrying on this buisness of un dermining monarchy. For, in the first place, if the circum stances of our state be such as to favour the accumulation of wealth, and make the opulent still more rich, this will increase their ambition. An accumulation of wealth, however, must necessarily be the consequence, Avhen, as at present, more riches flow in from external commerce than arise from inter-"], [170, "132 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. nal industry : for external commerce can only be managed to advantage by the rich, and they have also at the same time all the emoluments arising from internal industry; so that the rich, Avith us, have two sources of wealth, whereas the poor haA'e but one. For this reason, wealth, in all com mercial states, is found to accumulate; and all such have hitherto in time become aristocratical. Again, the very laws also of this country may contribute to the accumulation of Avealth ; as when, by their means, the natural ties that bind the rich and poor together are broken, and it is ordained that the rich shall only marry with the rich ; or when the learned are held unqualified to serve their country as counsellors, merely from a defect of opulence, and wealth is thus made the object of a wise man's ambition : by these means, I say, and such means as these, riches will accumulate. Now, the possessor of accumulated wealth, when furnished with the necessaries of life, has no other method to employ the super fluity of his fortune but in purchasing power. That is, differently speaking, in making dependents, by purchasing the liberty of the needy or the venal, of men who are willing to bear the mortification of contiguous tyranny for bread. Thus, each very opulent man generally gathers round liim a circle of the poorest of the people ; and the polity abounding in accumulated Avealth may be compared to a Cartesian sys tem, each orb with a vortex of its own. Those, however, who are willing to move in a great man's vortex are only such as must be slaves, the rabble of mankind, whose souls and whose education are adapted to semtude, and who know nothing of liberty except the name. But there must still be a large number of the people without the sphere of the opulent man's influence ; namely, that order of men which subsists between the very rich and the very rabble \u2014 those men who are pos sessed of too large fortunes to submit to the neighbouring man in power, and yet are too poor to set up for tyranny themselves. In this middle order of mankind are generally to be found all the arts, wisdom, and virtues of society. This order alone is knoAATi to be the true preserver of freedom, and may be called"], [171, "133 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. the people. Now, it may happen that this middle order of mankind may lose all its influence in a state, and its Aroice be in a manner droAvned in that of the rabble; for, if the fortune sufficient for qualifying a person at present to give his voice in state affairs be ten times less than was judged sufficient upon forming the constitution, it is evident that greater num bers of the rabble will thus be introduced into the political system, and they, ever moving in the vortex of the great, will folloAV Avhere greatness shall direct. In such a state, therefore. all that the middle order has left, is to preserve the preroga tive and privileges of one principal governor with the most sacred circumspection. For he divides the power ofthe rich, and calls off the great from falling with tenfold Aveight on the middle order, placed beneath them. The middle order may be compared to a toAvn, of which the opulent are forming the siege, and of which the governor from without is hastening the relief. While the besiegers are in dread of an enemy over them, it is but natural to offer the townsmen the most specious terms \u2014 to flatter them Avith sounds, and amuse them Avith privileges ; but if they once defeat the governor from behind, the walls of the town will be but a small defence to its inhabitants. What they may then expect, may be seen by turning our eyes to Holland, Genoa, or Venice, where the laAVS govern the poor, and the rich govern the law. I am then for, and would die for monarchy, sacred monarchy : for if there be any thing sacred amongst men, it must be the anointed sovereign of his people; and every dimunition of his power, in war or in peace, is an infringement upon the real liberties ofthe subject. The sounds of liberty, patriotism, and Britons, have already done much ; it is to be hoped that the true sons of freedom will prevent their ever doing more. I have knoAvn many of these pretended champions for liberty in my time, yet do I not remember one that was not in his heart and in his family a tyrant.\" My warmth, I found, had lengthened this harangue beyond the rides of good breeding ; but the impatience of my enter tainer, who often strove to interrupt it, could be restrained no"], [172, "134 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. longer. \"What !\" cried he, \" then I have been all this while entertaining a Jesuit in parson's clothes ! but by all the coal mines of Cornwall, out he shall pack, if my name be Wilkin son.\" I now found I had gone too far, and asked pardon for the warmth with which I had spoken. \" Pardon !\" returned he, in a fury, \"I think such principles demanded ten thousand pardons. What! give up liberty, property, and, as the Gazetteer says, lie down to be saddled with wooden shoes ! Sir, I insist upon your marching out of this house immediately, to prevent worse consequences: sir, I insist upon it.\" I was going to repeat my remonstrances ; but, just then, we heard a footman's rap at the door, and the two ladies cried out, \" As sure as death, there is our master and mistress come home !\" It seems my entertainer was all this while only the butler, who, in his master's absence, had a mind to cut a figure, and be for a whde the gentleman himself; and, to say the truth, he talked politics as well as most country gentlemen do. But nothing could now exceed my confusion upon seeing the gentleman and his lady enter; nor was their surprise at finding such company and good cheer less than ours. \" Gentlemen,\" cried the real master of the house to me and my companion, \" my wife and I are your most humble servants ; but, I pro test, this is so unexpected a favour, that we almost sink under the obligation.\" However unexpected our company might be to them, theirs, I am sure, was still more so to us, and I was struck dumb with the apprehensions of my own absurdity, when whom should I next see enter the room but my dear Miss Arabella Wilmot, who was formerly designed to be married to my son George, but whose match was broken off as already related. As soon as she saw me, she flew to my arms with the utmost joy. \" My dear sir,\" cried she, \" to what happy accident is it that we owe so unexpected a visit ? I am sure my uncle and aunt will be in raptures, when they find they have the good Dr. Primrose for their guest.\" Upon hearing my name, the old gentleman and lady politely stepped up, and Avelcomed me with the most cordial hospitabty. Nor could they forbear smiling, upon being informed of the nature"], [173, "VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. 135 of my present visit ; but the unfortunate butler, whom they at first seemed disposed to turn away, was, at my intercession, forgiven. Mr. Arnold and his lady, to whom the house belonged, now insisted upon having the pleasure of my stay for some days ; and as their niece, my charming pupil, whose mind in some measure had been formed under my instructions, joined in their entreaties, I complied. That night I was shown into a magnificent chamber; and the next morning, early, Miss Wilmot desired to walk with me in the garden, which was decorated in the modern manner. After some time spent in pointing out the beauties of the place, she inquired, with seeming unconcern, when last I heard from my son George ? \" Alas ! madam,\" cried I, \" he has now been nearly three years absent, Avithout ever writing to his friends or me. Where he is I know not ; perhaps I shall never see him or happiness more. No, my dear madam, we shall never more see such pleasing hours as were once spent by our fireside at Wakefield.

It was, however, some consolation to me to find that time had made no alteration in her affec tions, and that she had rejected several offers that had been made her since our leaAdng her part of the country. She led me round all the extensive improvements of the place, point ing to the several walks and arbours, and at the same time catching from every object a hint for some question relative to my son. In this manner we spent the forenoon, till the bell summoned us to dinner, where we found the manager of the strolling company that I mentioned before, who was come to dispose of tickets for the \" Fair Penitent,\" which was to be acted that evening \u2014 the part of Horatio by a young gentle man who had never appeared on the stage. He seemed to be very warm in the praise of the new performer, and averred that he never saw any one who bade so fair for excellence. \" Acting,\" he observed, \" was not learned in a day ; but this gentleman,\" continued he, \" seems born to tread the stage. His voice, his figure, and attitudes, are all admirable. We caught him up accidentally in our journey down.\" This account in some measure excited our curiosity, and, at the entreaty of the ladies, I was prevailed upon to accompany them to the play-house, which was no other than a barn. As the company with which I went was incontestibly the chief of the place, we were received with the greatest respect, and placed in the front seat of the theatre, where we sat for some time with no small impatience to see Horatio make his appear ance. The new performer advanced at last ; and let parents think of my sensations by their own, when I found it was my unfortunate son ! He was going to begin ; when, turning his eyes upon the audience, he perceived Miss Wdmot and me, and stood at once speechless and immoveable. The actors behind the scenes, who ascribed this pause to his natural timidity, attempted to encourage him; but instead of going on, he burst into a flood of tears, and retired off the"], [175, "137 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. stage. I don't know what were my feelings on this oocasion, for they succeeded with too much rapidity for description ; but I was soon awaked from this disagreeable reverie by Miss Wilmot, who, pale, and with a trembling voice, desired me to conduct her back to her uncle's. When got home, Mr. Arnold, who was as yet a stranger to our extraordinary beha viour, being informed that the new performer was my son, sent his coach and an invitation for him ; and as he persisted in his refusal to appear again upon the stage, the players put another in his place, and we soon had him with us. Mr. Arnold gave him the kindest reception, and I received him with my usual transport ; for I could never counterfeit false resentment. Miss Wilmot's reception was mixed with seem ing neglect, and yet I could perceive she acted a studied part. The tumult in her mind seemed not yet abated \u2014 she said twenty giddy things that looked like joy, and then laughed loud at her own want of meaning. At intervals she would take a sly peep at the glass, as if happy in the consciousness of irresistible beauty ; and often would ask questions without giving any manner of attention to the answers. 18"], [176, "CHAPTER XX. THE HISTORY OF A PHILOSOPHIC VAGABOND, PURSUING NOVELTY, BUT LOSING CONTENT fter we had supped, Mrs. Arnold politely offered to send a couple of footmen for my son's baggage, which he at first seemed to decline ; but upon her pressing the request, he was obliged to inform her, that a stick and Avallet were all the move- able things on this earth that he could boast of. \" Why, ay, my son,\" cried I, \" you left me but poor, and poor I find you are come back : and yet I make no doubt you have seen a great deal of the Avorld.\" \u2014 \" Yes, sir,\" replied my son ; \" but travelling after fortune is not the Avay to secure her; and, indeed, of late I have desisted from the pursuit.\" \u2014 \"I fancy, sir,\" cried Mrs. Arnold, \" that the account of your adA7entures would be amusing: the first part of them I have often heard from my niece ; but could the company preA'ail for the rest, it would be an additional obliga-"], [177, "VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. 139 tion.\" \u2014 \" Madam,\" replied fmy son, \" I promise you the pleasure you have in hearing will not be half so great as my vanity in repeating them ; yet in the whole narrative I can scarcely promise you one adventure, as my account is rather of what I saw than what I did. The first misfortune of my life, which you all know, was great ; but though it distressed, it could not sink me. No person ever had a better knack at hoping than I. The less kind I found fortune at one time, the more I expected from her another ; and being noAv at the bottom of her wheel, every new revolution might lift but could not depress me. I proceeded, therefore, towards Lon don in a fine morning, no way uneasy about to-morrow, but cheerful as the birds that carroled by the road ; and comforted myself with reflecting, that London was the mart where abilities of every kind were sure of meeting distinction and reward. Upon my arrival in town, sir, my first care was to deliver your letter of recommendation to our cousin, who was himself in little better circumstances than I. My first scheme, you know, sir, was to be usher at an academy, and I asked his advice in the affair. Our cousin received the proposal with a true Sardonic grin. ' Ay,' cried he, ' this is indeed a very pretty career that has been chalked out for you. I have been an usher at a boarding-school myself ; and may I die by an anodyne necklace, but I had rather be an under-turnkey in Newgate. I was up early and late. I was broAvbeat by the master, hated for my ugly face by the mistress, worried by the boys within, and never permitted to stir out to meet civility abroad. But are you sure you are fit for a school ? Let me examine you a little. Have you been bred apprentice to the business ?' \u2014 'No.' \u2014 ' Then you won't do for a school. Can you dress the boys' hair ?' \u2014 ' No.' \u2014 ' Then you Avon't do for a school. Have you had the small-pox ?' \u2014 \u2022 No.' \u2014 ' Then you won't do for a school. Can you lie three in a bed ?' \u2014 \u00ab No.' \u2014 ' Then you will never do for a school. Have you got a good stomach ?' \u2014 'Yes.'\u2014' Then you will by no means do for a school. No, sir : if you are for a genteel easy profession,"], [178, "140 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. bind yourself seven years an apprentice to turn a cutler's wheel ; but avoid a school by any means. Yet come,' conti nued he, * I see you are a lad of spirit and some learning \u2014 what do you think of commencing author, like me ? You have read in books, no doubt, of men of genius starving at the trade. At present I'll show you forty very dull fellows about town that live by it in opulence \u2014 all honest jog-trot men, who go on smoothly and dully, and write history and politics, and are praised \u2014 men, sir, who, had they been bred cobblers, Avould all their lives have only mended shoes, but never made them.' Finding that there Avas no great degree of gentility affixed to the character of an usher, I resolved to accept his proposal ; and having the highest respect for literature, hailed the antiqua mater of Grub Street with reverence. I thought it my glory to pursue a tract which Dryden and Otway trod before me. I considered the goddess of this region as the parent of excel lence ; and however an 'intercourse with the world might give us good sense, the poverty she entailed I supposed to be the nurse of genius ! Big with these reflections, I sat down, and finding that the best things remained to be said on the wrong side, I resolved to write a book that should be wholly new. I therefore dressed up three paradoxes with some ingenuity. They were false, indeed, but they were new. The jewels of truth have been so often imported by others, that nothing was left for me to import but some splendid things that at a distance looked every bit as well. Witness, ye powers, what fancied importance sat perched upon my quill while I was writing ! The whole learned Avorld, I made no doubt, would rise to oppose my systems ; but then I was prepared to oppose the whole learned world. Like the porcupine, I sat self-col lected, Avith a quill pointed against every opposer.\" \"Well said, my boy,\" cried I; \"and what subject did you treat upon ? I hope you did not pass over the importance of monogamy. But I interrupt \u2014 go on. You published your paradoxes \u2014 well, and what did the learned world say to your paradoxes ?\""], [179, "VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. 141 \" Sir,\" replied my son, \" the learned world said nothing to my paradoxes \u2014 nothing at all, sir. Every man of them was employed in praising his friends and himself, or condemning his enemies ; and unfortunately, as I had neither, I suffered the cruellest mortification \u2014 neglect. As I was meditating one day in a coffee-house on the fate of my paradoxes, a little man happening to enter the room, placed himself in the box before me : and after some prelimi nary discourse, finding me to be a scholar, drew out a bundle of proposals, begging me to subscribe to a new edition he was going to give to the world of Propertius, with notes. This demand necessarily produced a reply that I had no money ; and that concession led him to inquire into the nature of my expectations. Finding that my expectations were just as great as my purse \u2014 ' I see,' cried he, ' you are unacquainted with the town \u2014 I'll teach you a part of it.

If they subscribe readily the first time, I renew my request to beg a dedication fee\u2014 if they let me have that, I smite them once more for engraving their coat of arms at the top. Thus,' continued he, * I live by vanity and laugh at it. But, between ourselves, I am now too well known \u2014 I should be glad to borrow your face a bit. A noble man of distinction has just returned from Italy \u2014 my face is familiar to his porter; but if you bring this copy of verses, my life for it you succeed, and we divide the spoil.' \" \" Bless us, George,\" cried I, \" and is this the employment of poets now ? Do men of their exalted talents thus stoop to beggary ? Can they so far disgrace their calling, as to make a vile traffic of praise for bread ?\" \" Oh, no, sir,\" returned he, \" a true poet can never be so base ; for wherever there is genius there is pride. The crea tures I now describe are only beggars in rhyme. The real poet, as he braves every hardship for fame, so he is equally a coAvard to contempt ; and none but those who are unworthy protection condescend to solicit it. Having a mind too proud to stoop to such indignities, and yet a fortune too humble to hazard a second attempt for fame, I was noAv obliged to take a middle course, and write for bread. But I was unqualified for a profession Avhere mere industry alone was to insure success. I could not suppress my lurking passion for applause, but usually consumed that time in efforts after excellence which takes up but little room, when it should have been more advantageously employed in the diffusive productions of fruitful mediocrity. My little piece would therefore come forth in the midst of periodical publications, unnoticed and unknown. The public were more importantly employed than to observe the easy simplicity of my style, or the harmony^of my periods. Sheet after sheet was thrown off to oblivion. My essays were buried among"], [181, "VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. 143 the essays upon liberty, Eastern tales, and cures for the bite of a mad dog ; while Philautus, Philathes, Philelutheros, and Philanthropos, all wrote better, because they wrote faster than I. Now, therefore, I began to associate with none but dis appointed authors like myself, who praised, deplored, and despised each other. The satisfaction we found in every cele brated writer's attempts, was inversely as their merits. I found that no genius in another could please me. My unfortunate paradoxes had entirely dried up that source of comfort. I could neither read nor write with satisfaction ; for excellence in another was my aversion, and writing was my trade, In the midst of these gloomy reflections, as I was one day sitting on a bench in St. James's Park, a young gentleman of distinction, who had been my intimate acquaintance at the university, approached me. We saluted each other with some hesitation ; he almost ashamed of being known to one who made so shabby an appearance, and I afraid of a repulse. But my suspicions soon vanished ; for Ned Thornhill was at the bottom a very good-natured fellow.\""], [182, "144 VICAR OF WAKE1FELD. \" What did you say, George ?\" interrupted I. \" Thornhill, was not that his name? It can certainly be no other than my landlord.\" \u2014 \"Bless me,\" cried Mrs. Arnold, \"is Mr. Thornhill so near a neighbour of yours ? He has long been a friend in our family, and we expect a visit from him* shortly.\" \" My friend's first care,\" continued my son, \" was to alter my appearance by a very fine suit of his own clothes, and then I Avas admitted to his table, upon the footing of half friend, half underling. My business was to attend him at auetionsj to put him in spirits Avhen he sat for his picture, to take the left hand in his chariot when not filled by another, and to assist at tattering a kip, as the phrase was, when he had a mind for a frolic. Besides this, I had twenty other little employments in the family. I Avas to do many small things without bidding : to carry the corkscrew ; to stand godfather to all the butler's children ; to sing when I was bid ; to be never out of humour ; always to be humble, and, if I could, to be very happy. In this honourable post, however, I was not without a rival. A captain of marines, who Avas formed for the place by nature, opposed me in my patron's affections. His mother had been laundress to a man of quality, and thus he early acquired a taste for pimping and pedigree. As this gentleman made it the study of his life to be acquainted with lords, though he was dismissed from several for his stupidity, yet he found many of them who were as dull as himself that permitted his assiduities. As flattery was his trade, he practised it with the easiest address imaginable; but it came awkward and stiff from me : and as every day my patron's desire of flattery increased, so, every hour, being better acquainted with his defects, I became more unwilling to give it. Thus, I Avas once more fairly going to give up the field to the captain, when my friend found occasion for my assistance. This was nothing less than to fight a duel for him with a gentleman, whose sister, it was pretended, he had used ill. I readily complied with his request ; and though I see you are dipleased"], [183, "VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. 145 at my conduct, yet, as it was a debt indispensably due to friendship, I could not refuse. I undertook the affair, dis armed my antagonist, and soon after had the pleasure of finding, that the lady was only a woman of the town, and the fellow her bully and a sharper. This piece of service was repaid with the Avarmest professions of gratitude ; but as my friend was to leave town in a few days, he knew no other method of serving me but by recommending me to his uncle, Sir William Thornhill, and another nobleman of great distinc- l?"], [184, "146 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. tion, Avho enjoyed a post under the government. When he was gone, my first care was to carry his recommendatory letter to his uncle, a man whose character for every virtue was universal, yet just. I was received by his servants with the most hospitable smiles ; for the looks of the domestics ever transmit their master's benevolence. Being shown into a grand apartment, where Sir William soon came to me, I delivered my message and letter, which he read, and, after pausing some minutes \u2014 ' Pray, sir,' cried he, ' inform me what you have done for my kinsman to deserve this warm recommendation ? But I suppose, sir, I guess your merits \u2014 you have fought for him ; and so you would expect a reward from me for being the instrument of his vices. I wish, sin cerely wish, that my present refusal may be some punishment for your guilt ; but still more, that it may be some induce ment to your repentance.' The severity of this rebuke I bore patiently, because I kneAv it Avas just. My whole expectations now, therefore, lay in my letter to the great man. As the doors of the nobility are almost ever beset with beggars, all ready to thrust in some sly petition, I found it no easy matter to gain admittance. HoAvever, after bribing the servants with half my worldly fortune, I was at last shown into a spacious apartment, my letter being previously sent up for his Lordship's inspection. During this anxious interval, I had full time to look round me. Every thing was grand and of happy contrivance : the paintings, the furniture, the gildings, petrified me with awe, and raised my idea of the owner. Ah, thought I to myself, how very great must the possessor of all these things be, Avho carries in his head the business of the state, and whose house displays half the wealth of a kingdom ! sure his genius must be unfathomable ! During these awful reflections, I heard a step come heavily forward. Ah, this is the great man himself; No ; it was only a chambermaid. Another foot was heard soon after. This must be he ! No ; it Avas only the great man's valet-de-chambre . At last his Lordship actually made his appearance. ' Are you,' cried he, ' the bearer of this here letter ? I answered"], [185, "147 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. with a bow. ' I learn by this,' continued he, ' as how that \u2014 But just at that instant a servant delivered him a card, and, without taking farther notice, he went out of the room, and left me to digest my own happiness at leisure. I saw no more of him, till told by a footman that his Lordship was going to his coach at the door. Down I immediately followed, and joined my voice to that of three or four more, who came, like me, to petition for favours. His Lordship, however, went too fast for us, and was gaining his chariot door with large strides, \u00bb when I halloed out to know if I was to have any reply. He was, by this time, got in, and muttered an answer. half of which only I heard, the other half was lost in the rattling of his chariot wheels. I stood for some time with my neck stretched out, in the posture of one that was listening to catch the glorious sounds, till, looking round me, I found myself alone at his Lordship's gate. \" My patience,\" continued my son, \" was now quite exhausted : stung with the thousand indignities I had met with, I was willing to cast myself away, and only wanted the gulf to receive me. I regarded myself as one of those vile things that Nature designed should be thrown by into her lumber-room, there to perish in obscurity. I had still, how ever, half-a-guinea left, and of that I thought fortune herself should not deprive me ; but in order to be sure of this, I was resolved to go instantly and spend it while I had it, and then trust to occurrences for the rest. As I was going along with this resolution, it happened that Mr. Crispe's office seemed invitingly open to give me a welcome reception. In this office, Mr. Crispe kindly offers all his majesty's subjects a generous promise of \u00a330 a-year, for which promise all they give in return is their liberty for life, and permission to let him transport them to America as slaves. I was happy at finding a place where I could lose my fears in desperation, and entered this cell (for it had the appearance of one) with the devotion of a monastic. Here I found a number of poor creatures, all in circumstances like myself, expecting the arrival of Mr. Crispe, presenting a true epitome of English"], [186, "148 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. impatience. Each untractable soul at A'ariance with fortune wreaked her injuries on their OAvn hearts : but Mr. Crispe at last came down, and all our murmurs were hushed. He deigned to regard me with an air of peculiar approbation, and indeed, he was the first man who, for a month past, had talked to me with smiles. After a few questions, he found I was fit for every thing in the world. He paused a while upon the properest means of providing for me ; and, slapping his forehead as if he had found it, assured me, that there was at that time an embassy talked of from the synod of Pensylvania to the Chickasaw Indians, and that he Avould use his interest to get me made secretary. I knew in my own heart that the fellow lied, and yet his promise gaA7e me pleasure, there was something magnificent in the sound. I fairly therefore divi ded my half-guinea, one half of which went to be added to his thirty thousand pounds, and with the other half I resolved to go to the next tavern, to be there more happy than he. As I was going out with that resolution, I was met at the door by the captain of a ship with whom I had formerly some little acquaintance, and he agreed to be my companion over a"], [187, "VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. 149 bowl of punch. As I never chose to make a secret of my circumstances, he assured me that I was upon the very point of ruin, in listening to the office-keeper's promises ; for that he only designed to sell me to the plantations. ' But,' continued he, ' I fancy you might, by a much shorter voyage, be very easily put into a genteel way of bread. Take my advice. My ship sails to-morrow for Amsterdam : what if you go in her as a passenger ? The moment you land, all you have to do is to teach the Dutchmen English, and I'll warrant you'll get pupils and money enough. I suppose you understand English,' added he, ' by this time, or the deuce is in it.' I confidently assured him of that ; but expressed a doubt Avhether the Dutch would be willing to learn English. He affirmed, with an oath, that they Avere fond of it to distraction ; and upon that affirmation I agreed with his proposal, and embarked the next day to teach the Dutch English in* Holland. The wind was fair, our voyage short ; and after having paid my passage with half my moveables, I found myself, fallen as from the skies, a stranger in one of the principal streets of Amsterdam. In this situation I was unwilling to let any time pass unemployed in teaching. I addressed myself, therefore, to two or three of those I met, whose appearance seemed most promising ; but it was impossible to make ourselves mutually understood. It was not till this ver}7 moment I recollected, that in order to teach the Dutchmen English, it was necessary that they should first teach me Dutch. How I came to overlook so obvious an objection, is to me amazing ; but certain it is, I overlooked it. This scheme thus blown up, I had some thoughts of fairly shipping back to England again, but falling into company Avith an Irish student, who was returning from Louvain, our conversation turning upon topics of literature (for, by the way, it may be observed, that I always forgot the meanness of my circumstances when I could converse upon such subjects), from him I learned that there were not two men in his Avhole university who understood Greek. This amazed me. I instantly resolved to travel to Louvain, and there live by"], [188, "150 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. teaching Greek\u2014 and in this design I was heartened by my brother student, who threw out some hints that a fortune might be got by it. I set boldly forward the next morning. Every day lessened the burden of my moveables, like \u00c6sop and his basket of bread ; for I paid them for my lodgings to the Dutch, as I travelled on. When I came to Louvain, I was resolved not to go sneaking to the lower professors, but openly tendered my talents to the Principal himself. I went, had admittance, and offered him my service as a master of the Greek language, which I had been told was a desideratum in his university. The Principal seemed at first to doubt of my abilities ; but of these I offered to convince him, by turning a part of any Greek author he should fix upon into Latin. Finding me perfectly earnest in my proposal, he addressed me thus: \u2014 ' You see me, young man ; I never learned Greek, and I don't find that I have ever missed it. I have had a doctor's cap and gown without Greek \u2014 I have ten thousand florins a year without Greek \u2014 I eat heartily without Greek \u2014 and, in short,\" continued he, 'as I don't know Greek, I do not believe there is any good in it.' I was too far from home to think of returning ; so I resolved to go forward. I had some knoAvledge of music, with a tole rable voice, and now turned what was my amusement into a present means of subsistence. I passed among the harmless peasants of Flanders, and among such of the French as were poor enough to be very merry ; for I ever found them sprightly in proportion to their wants. Whenever I approached a pea sant's house toAvards nightfall, I played one of my most merry tunes, and that procured me not only a lodging, but subsistence for the next day. I once or twice attempted to play for people of fashion, but they always thought my performance odious, and never rewarded me even with a trifle. This was to me the more extraordinary, as, whenever I used, in better days, to play for company, when playing was my amusement, my music never failed to throw them into raptures, and the ladies especially ; but as it was iioav my only means, it was"], [189, "VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. 151 received with contempt \u2014 a proof how ready the world is to under-rate those talents by which a man is supported. In this manner I proceeded to' Paris, with no design but just to look about me, and then go forward. The people of Paris, are much fonder of strangers that have money than those that have wit. As I could not boast much of either, I was no great favourite. After walking about the town four or five days, and seeing the outsides of the best houses, I was prepa ring to leave this retreat of venal hospitality, when, passing through one of the principal streets, whom should I meet but our cousin, to whom you first recommended me. This meet ing was very agreeable to me, and I believe not displeasing to him. He inquired into the nature of my journey to Paris, and informed me of his own business there, which was to collect pictures, medals, intaglios, and antiques of all kinds, for a gentleman in London, who had just stepped into taste and a large fortune. I was the more surprised at seeing our cousin pitched upon for this office, as he himself had often assured me he knew nothing of the matter. Upon asking how he had been taught the art of a cognoscento so very suddenly, he assured me that nothing was more easy. The whole secret consisted in a strict adherence to two rules: the one, always to observe the picture might have been better if the painter had taken more pains ; and the other, to praise the works of Pietro Perugino. ' But,' says he, ' as I once taught you how to be an author in London, I'll now undertake to instruct you in the art of picture-buying in Paris.' With this proposal I very readily closed, as it was a living, and now all my ambition was to live. I went therefore to his lodgings, improved my dress by his assistance ; and, after some time, accompanied him to auctions of pictures, where the English gentry were expected to be purchasers. I was not a little surprised at his intimacy with people ofthe best of fashion, who referred themselves to his judgment upon every picture or medal, as to an unerring standard of taste. He made very good use of my assistance upon these occasions ; for, when asked his opinion, he would gravely take me aside"], [190, "152 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. and ask mine, shrug, look wise, return, and assure the com pany that he could give no opinion upon an affair of so much importance. Yet there was sometimes an occasion for a more important assurance. I remember to have seen him, after giving his opinion that the colouring of a picture was not mellow enough, very deliberately take a brush with brown varnish, that was accidentally lying by, and rub it over the piece with great composure before all the company, and then ask if he had not improved the tints. When he had finished his commission in Paris, he left me strongly recommended to several men of distinction, as a per son very proper for a travelling tutor ; and after some time, I was employed in that capacity by a gentleman who brought his ward to Paris, in order to set him forward on his tour through Europe. I was to be the young gentleman's gover nor: but with a proviso, that he should always be permitted to govern himself. My pupil, in fact, understood the art of guiding in money concerns much better than I. He was heir to a fortune of about tAvo hundred thousand pounds, left him by an uncle in the West Indies ; and his guardians, to qualify him for the management of it, had bound him apprentice to an attorney. Thus, avarice was his prevailing passion : all his questions on the road were, how money might be saved? which was the least expensive course of travel ? whether any thing could be bought that would turn to account when disposed of again in London ? Such curiosities on the way as could be seen for nothing, he was ready enough to look at; but if the sight of them was to be paid for, he usually asserted that he had been told they were not worth seeing. He never paid a bill that he would not observe how amazingly expensive travelling was ! and all this though he was not yet twenty-one. When arrived at Leghorn, as we took a walk to look at the port and shipping, he inquired the expense of the passage by sea home to England. This, he was informed, was but a trifle compared to his returning by land ; he was therefore unable to withstand the temptation \u2014 so paying me the small part of my salary that Avas due, he took leave, and embarked with only one attendant for London."], [191, "A'lCAR OF WAKEFIELD. 153 I now, therefore, was left once more upon the world at large ; but then it was a thing I was used to. However, my skill in music could avail me nothing in a country where every peasant was a better musician than I : but by this time I had acquired another talent, which answered my purpose as well, and this was a skill in disputation. In all the foreign universities and convents there are, upon certain days, philo sophical theses maintained against every adventitious dispu tant ; for which, if the champion opposes with any dexterity, he can claim a gratuity in money, a dinner, and a bed for one night. In this manner, therefore, I fought my way towards England; walked along from city to city; examined mankind more nearly ; and, if I may so express it, saw both sides of the picture. My remarks, however, are but few : I found that monarchy was the best government for the poor to live in, and commonwealths for the rich. I found that riches in general were in every country another name for freedom ; and that no man is so fond of liberty himself, as not to be desirous of subjecting the will of some individuals in society to his own. 20"], [192, "154 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD Upon my arrival in England, I resolved to pay my respects first to you, and then to enlist as a volunteer in the first expedition that was going forward ; but on my journey doAvn, my resolutions were changed by meeting an old acquaintance, who I found belonged to a company of comedians that were going to make a summer campaign in the country. The company seemed not much to disapprove of me for an associate. They all, however, apprised me of the importance of the task at which I aimed ; that the public was a many-headed monster, and that only such as had very good heads could please it; that acting was not to be learned in a day ; and that without some traditional shrugs, which had been on the stage, and only on the stage, these hundred years, I could never pretend to please. The next difficulty was in fitting me with parts, as almost every character was in keeping. I was driven for some time from one character to another, till at last Horatio was fixed upon, which the presence of the present company has happily hindered me from acting.\""], [193, "CHAPTER XXI.

The butler, who was now become my friend in the family, informed me, with a whisper, that the Squire had already made some overtures to Miss Wilmot, and that her aunt and uncle seemed highly to approve the match. Upon Mr. Thornhill's entering, he seemed, at seeing my son and me, to start back ; but I readily imputed that to surprise, and not displeasure. However, upon our advancing to salute him, he returned our greeting"], [194, "156 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. with the most apparent candour; and after a short time his presence served only to increase the general good humour. After tea, he called me aside to inquire after my daughter ; but upon my informing him that my inquiry was unsuccessful, he seemed greatly surprised, adding, that he had been since frequently at my house in order to comfort the rest of my family, whom he left perfectly well. He then asked if I had communicated her misfortune to Miss Wilmot or my son ; and upon my replying that I had not told them as yet, he greatly approved my prudence and precaution, desiring me by all means to keep it a secret : \" For at best,\" cried he, \" it is but divulging one's own infamy ; and perhaps Miss Livy may not be so guilty as we all imagine.\" We were here interrupted by a servant who came to ask the Squire in, to stand up at country-dances; so that he left me quite pleased with the interest he seemed to take in my concerns. His addresses, however, to Miss Wilmot, were too obvious to be mistaken ; and yet, she seemed not perfectly pleased, but bore them rather in compliance to the will of her aunt than real inclina tion. I had even the satisfaction to see her lavish some kind looks upon my unfortunate son, which the other could neither extort by his fortune nor assiduity. Mr. Thornhill's seeming composure, however, not a little surprised me. We had now continued here a week at the pressing instances of Mr. Arnold ; but each day the more tenderness Miss Wilmot showed my son, Mr. Thornhill's friendship seemed proportion ably to increase for him. He had formerly made us the most kind assurances of using his interest to serve the family ; but now his generosity was not confined to promises alone. The morning I designed for my departure, Mr. Thornhill came to me with looks of real pleasure, to inform me of a piece of service he had done for his friend George. This was nothing less than his having procured him an ensign's commission in one of the regiments that were going to the West Indies, for which he had promised but one hundred pounds, his interest having been sufficient to get an abatement of the other two. \" As for this trifling"], [195, "VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. 157 piece of service,\" continued the young gentleman, \" I desire no other reward but the pleasure of having served my friend ; and as for the hundred pounds to be paid, if you are unable to raise it yourselves, I will advance it, and you shall repay me at your leisure.\" This was a favour we wanted words to express our sense of \u2014 I readily, therefore, gave my bond for the money, and testified as much gratitude as if I neA'er intended to pay. George was to depart for town the next day to secure his commission, in pursuance of his generous patron's directions, who judged it highly expedient to use despatch, lest, in the meantime, another should step in with more advantageous proposals. The next morning, therefore, our young soldier Avas early prepared for his departure, and seemed the only person among us that was not affected by it. Neither the fatigues and dangers he was going to encounter, nor the friends and mistress \u2014 for Miss Wilmot actually loved him \u2014 he was leaving behind, any way damped his spirits. After he had taken leave of the rest of the company, I gave him all I had \u2014 my blessing. \" And now, my boy,\" cried I, \" thou art going to fight for thy country \u2014 remember how thy brave grandfather fought for his sacred king, when loyalty among Britons was a virtue. Go, my boy, and imitate him in all but his misfortunes, if it was a misfortune to die with Lord Falkland. Go, my boy, and if you fall, though distant, exposed, and unwept by those that love you, the most precious tears are those with which Heaven bedews the unburied head of a soldier.\" The next morning I took leave of the good family, that had been kind enough to entertain me so long, not Avithout several expressions of gratitude to Mr. Thornhill for his late bounty. I left them in the enjoyment of all that happiness which affluence and good breeding procure, and returned towards home, despairing of ever finding my daughter more, but sending a sigh to Heaven to spare and to forgive her. I was now come within about twenty miles of home, having hired a horse to carry me, as I was but yet weak, and comforted myself with the hopes of soon seeing all I held dearest upon"], [196, "158 VICAR OF WAKEIFELD. earth. But the night coming on, I put up at a little public house by the roadside, and asked for the landlord's company over a pint of wine. We sat beside his kitchen fire, which was the best room in the house, and chatted on politics and the news of the country. We happened, among other topics, to talk of young Squire Thornhill, Avho, the host assured me, was hated as much as his uncle Sir William, who sometimes came down to the country, AA7as loved. He went on to observe, that he made it his whole study to betray the daughters of such as received him to their houses, and, after a fortnight of three weeks possession, turned them out unrewarded and abandoned to the world. As we continued our discourse in"], [197, "VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. 159 this manner, his wife, who had been out to get change, return ed, and perceiving that her husband Avas enjoying a pleasure in which she was not a sharer, she asked him, in an angry tone, what he did there? to which he only replied, in an ironical way, by drinking her health. \" Mr Symonds,\" cried she, \" you use me very ill, and I'll bear it no longer. Here three parts of the business is left for me to do, and the fourth left unfinished, while you do nothing but soak with the guests all day long ; whereas, if a spoonful of liquor were to cure me of a fever, I never touch a drop.\" I now found what she would be at, and immediately poured her out a glass, which she received Avith a curtsey, and, drinking towards my good health, \" Sir,\" resumed she, \" it is not so much for the value of the liquor I am angry, but one cannot help it when the house is going out of the windows. If the customers or guests are to be dunned, all the burden lies upon my back \u2014 he'd as lief eat that glass as budge after them himself. There, now, above stairs, we have a young woman who has come to take up her lodgings here, and I don't believe she has got any money, by her over civility. I am certain she is very slow of payment, and I wish she were put in mind of it.\" \u2014 \" What signifies minding her ?\" cried the host ; \" if she be slow, she is sure.\" \u2014 \" I don't know that,\" replied the wife ; \" but I know that I am sure she has been here a fortnight, and we have not yet seen the cross of her money.\" \u2014 \" I suppose, my dear,\" cried he, \" we shall have it all in a lump.\" \u2014 \" In a lump !\" cried the other : \" I hope we may get it any way ; and that I am resolved we will this very night, or out she tramps, bag and baggage.\" \u2014 \" Consider, my dear,\" cried the husband, \" she is a gentlewoman, and deserves more respect.\" \u2014 \" As for the matter of that,\" returned the hostess, \" gentle or simple, out she shall pack with a sassarara. Gentry may be good things where they take ; but, for my part, I never saw much good of them at the sign of the Harrow.\" Thus saying, she ran up a narrow flight of stairs that went from the kitchen to a room over-head ; and I soon perceived, by the loudness of her voice, and the bitterness of her reproaches,"], [198, "160 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. that no money was to be had from her lodger. I could hear her remonstrances very distinctly : \" Out I say ; pack out this moment ! tramp, thou infamous strumpet, or I'll give thee a mark thou won't be the better for this three months. What ! you trumpery, to come and take up an honest house without cross or coin to bless yourself with ; come along, I say !\" \u2014 \" Oh, dear madam,\" cried the stranger, \" pity me \u2014 pity a poor abandoned creature, for one night, and death will soon do the rest !\" I instantly knew the voice of my poor ruined child Olivia. I flew to her rescue, while the Avoman was dragging her along by the hair, and I caught the dear forlorn wretch in my arms. \" Welcome, any way welcome, my dearest lost one \u2014 my treasure \u2014 to your poor old father's bosom !

After we had talked ourselves into some degree of tranquillity, I could no"], [199, "VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. 161 longer avoid desiring some account of the gradations that led her to her present wretched situation. \" That villain, sir,\" said she, \" from the first day of our meeting, made me honour able, though private proposals.\" \" Villain, indeed ! \" cried I : \" and yet it in some measure surprises me, how a person of Mr. Burchell's good sense and seeming honour could be guilty of such deliberate baseness, and thus step into a family to undo it.\" \" My dear papa,\" returned my daughter, \" you labour under a strange mistake.

But tell me, my child, sure it was no small temptation that could thus obliterate all the impressions of such an education, and so virtuous a disposition as thine ? \" \" Indeed, sir,\" replied she, \" he owes all his triumph to the desire I had of making him, and not myself, happy, I knew that the ceremony of our marriage, which was privately performed by a popish priest, was no way binding, and that I had nothing to trust to but his honour.\" \u2014 \" What ! \" inter rupted I, \"and were you indeed married by a priest in orders ? \" \u2014 \" Indeed, sir, we were,\" replied she, \" though we were both sworn to conceal his name.\" \u2014 \" Why, then, my child, come to my arms again ; and now you are a thousand times more welcome than before, for you are now his Avife to all intents and purposes ; nor can the laws of man, though written upon tables of adamant, lessen the force of that sacred connection.\" \" Alas, papa,\" replied she, \" you are but little acquainted with his villanies : he has been married already by the same priest to six or eight wives more, whom, like me, he has deceived and abandoned.\" \" Has he so ?\" cried I ; \" then we must hang the priest, and you shall inform against him to-morrow.\" \u2014 \" But, sir,\" returned she, \" will that be right, when I am sworn to secrecy ?\" \u2014 \" My dear,\" I replied, \" if you have made such a promise, I cannot, nor will I tempt you to break it. Even though it may benefit the public, you must not inform against him. In all human institutions a smaller evil is allowed to procure a greater good ; as, in politics, a province may be given away to secure a kingdom ; in medicine, a limb may be lopped off to preserve the body : but in religion, the law is written, and inflexible, never to do evil. And this law, my child, is"], [201, "VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. 163 right ; for otherwise, if we commit a smaller evil to procure a greater good, certain guilt would be thus incurred, in expec tation of contingent advantage. And though the advantage should certainly follow, yet the interval between commission and advantage, which is allowed to be guilty, may be that in Avhich we are called away to answer for the things we have done, and the volume of human actions is closed for ever. But I interrupt you, my dear ; go on.\" \" The very next morning,\" continued she, \" I found what little expectation I was to have from his sincerity. That very morning he introduced me to two unhappy women more, whom, like me, he had deceived, but who lived in contented prostitution. I loved him too tenderly to bear such rivals in his affections, and strove to forget my infamy in a tumult of pleasures. With this view I danced, dressed, and talked ; but still was unhappy. The gentlemen who visited there told me every moment of the power of my charms : and this only contributed to increase my melancholy, as I had thrown all their power quite away. Thus, each day I grew more pensive and he more insolent, till at last the monster had the assurance to offer me to a young baronet of his acquaintance. Need I describe, sir, how his ingratitude stung me ? My answer to this proposal was almost madness. I desired to part. As I was going, he offered me a purse ; but I flung it at him with indignation, and burst from him in a rage that for a while kept me insensible of the miseries of my situation. But I soon looked round me, and saw myself a vile, abject, guilty thing, without one friend in the world to apply to. Just in that interval, a stage coach happening to pass by, I took a place, it being my aim to be driven to a distance from a wretch I despised and detested. I was set down here, where, since iny arrival, my own anxiety and this woman's unkindness have been my only companions.

I took every opportunity, from the prospect of a fine country, through which we passed, to observe how much kinder Heaven was to us than we to each other ; and that the misfortunes of Nature's making were very few. I assured her, that she should never perceive any change in my affections, and that, during my life, which yet might be long, she might depend upon a guardian and an instructor. I armed her against the censure of the world, showed her that"], [204, "166 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. books were SAveet uureproaching companions to the miserable, and that, if they could not bring us to enjoy life, they would at least teach us to endure it. The hired horse that we rode was to be put up that night at an inn by the way, within about five miles from my house ; and as I was Avilling to prepare my family for my daughter's reception, I determined to leave her that night at the inn, and to return for her, accompanied by my daughter Sophia, early the next morning. It was night before we reached our appointed stage ; however, after seeing her proA'ided with a decent apartment, and having ordered the hostess to prepare proper refreshments, I kissed her, and proceeded towards home. And now my heart caught new sensations of pleasure the nearer I approached that peaceful mansion. As a bird that had been frighted from its nest, my affections outwent my haste, and hovered round my little fireside Avith all the rapture of expectation. I called up the many fond things I had to say, and anticipated the welcome I was to receive. I already felt my wife's tender embrace, and smiled at the joy of my little ones. As I walked but slowly, the night waned apace. The labourers of the day were all retired to rest ; the lights were out in every cottage ; no sounds were heard but of the shrilling cock, and the deep-mouthed watch-dog, at a hollow distance. I approached my little abode of pleasures, and, before I was within a furlong of the place, our honest mastiff came running to welcome me. It Avas now near midnight that I came to knock at my door \u2014 all was still and silent \u2014 my heart dilated with unutter able happiness ; when, to my amazement, I saw the house bursting out in a blaze of fire, and every aperture red Avith conflagration. I gave a loud convulsive outcry, and fell upon the pavement insensible. This alarmed my son, Avho had till this been asleep, and he, perceiving the flames, instantly awaked my wife and daughter ; and all running out, naked, and wild with apprehension, recalled me to life with their anguish. But it Avas only to objects of new terror ; for the flames had, by this time, caught the roof of our dwelling, part"], [205, ""], [206, "THE FIRE"], [207, "VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. 167 after part continuing to fall in, while the family stood, Avith silent agony, looking on, as if they enjoyed the blaze. I gazed upon them and upon it by turns, and then looked round me for my two little ones ; but they were not to be seen. O misery! \"Where,\" cried I, \"where are my little ones?\" \" They are burnt to death in the flames,\" said my wife, calmly, \" and I will die with them.\" That moment I heard the cry of the babes within, who were just awaked by the fire, and nothing could have stopped me. \" Where, where are my children ? \" cried I, rushing through the flames, and bursting the door of the chamber in which they were confined ! \u2014 \" Where are my little ones ?\" \u2014 \" Here, dear papa, here we are,\" cried they together, while the flames were just catching the bed where they lay. I caught them both in my arms, and snatched them through the fire as fast as possible, while, just as I was got out, the roof sunk in. \" Now,\" cried I, holding up my children, \" now let the flames burn on, and all my possessions perish. Here they are \u2014 I have saved my treasure. Here, my dearest, here are our treasures, and we shall yet be happy.\" We kissed our little darlings a thousand times ; they clasped us round the neck, and seemed to share our transports, while their mother laughed and wept by turns. I now stood a calm spectator of the flames ; and, after some time, began to perceive that my arm to the shoulder was scorched in a terrible manner \u2014 it was, therefore, out of my power to give my son any assistance, either in attempting to save our goods, or preventing the flames spreading to our corn. By this time the neighbours were alarmed, and came running to our assistance ; but all they could do was to stand,. like us, spectators of the calamity. My goods, among which were the notes I had reserved for my daughters' fortunes, were entirely consumed, except a box with some papers that stood in the kitchen, and two or three things more of little consequence, which my son brought away in the beginning. The neighbours contributed, however, what they could to lighten our distress. They brought us"], [208, "168 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. clothes, and furnished one of our out-houses with kitchen utensils; so that by daylight we had another, though a wretched dwelling to retire to. My honest next neighbour and his children were not the least assiduous in providing us with every thing necessary, and offering whatever consolation untutored benevolence cought suggest. When the fears of my family had subsided, curiosity to know the cause of my long stay began to take place. Having therefore informed them of every particular, I proceeded to prepare them for the reception of our lost one ; and though we had nothing but wretchedness now to impart, I was willing to procure her a welcome to what we had. This task would have been more difficult but for our recent calamity, which had humbled my wife's pride, and blunted it by more poignant afflictions. Being unable to go for my poor child myself, as my arm grew very painful, I sent my son and daughter, who soon returned, supporting the Avretched delinquent, Avho had not the courage to look up at her mother, whom no instruc tions of mine could persuade to a perfect reconciliation ; for women have a much stronger sense of female error than men. \" Ah, madam,\" cried her mother, \" this is but a poor place you are come to after so much finery. My daughter Sophy and I can afford but little entertainment to persons who have kept company only with people of distinction. Yes, Miss Livy, your poor father and I haA7e suffered very much of late ; but I hope Heaven will forgive you.\" During- this reception the unhappy victim stood pale and trembling, unable to weep or to reply ; but I could not continue a silent spectator of her distress \u2014 Avherefore, assuming a degree of severity in my voice and manner, which was ever followed with instant submission \" I entreat, woman, that my words may be now marked once for all.

The kindness of Heaven is promised to the penitent, and let ours be di rected by the example. Heaven, we are assured, is much more pleased to view a repentant sinner, than ninety-nine persons who have supported a course of undeviated rectitude.

Our good neighbours, too, came every day, with the kindest condolence, and fixed a time in which they were all to assist at repairing my former dwelling. Honest farmer Williams was not last among these visitors, but heartily offered his friendship. He would even have re newed his addresses to my daughter ; but she rejected him in such a manner as totally repressed his future solicitations. Her grief seemed formed for continuing, and she was the"], [211, "171 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. only person of our little society that a week did not restore to cheerfulness. She now lost that unblushing innocence which once taught her to respect herself, and to seek plea sure by pleasing. Anxiety noAv had taken strong possession of her mind ; her beauty began to be impaired Avith her con stitution, and neglect still more contributed to diminish it. Every tender epithet bestowed on her sister, brought a pang to her heart, and a tear to her eye ; and as one vice, though cured, ever plants others where it has been, so her former guilt, though driven out by repentance, left jealousy and envy behind. I strove a thousand ways to lessen her care, and even forget my own pain in a concern for her's, collect ing such amusing passages of history as a strong memory and some reading could suggest. \"Our happiness my dear,' I would say, \" is in the power of one who can bring it about a thousand unforeseen ways that mock our foresight.

As she stood one day caressing her infant son in the open window of an apartment which hung over the river Volturna, the child, with a sudden spring, leaped from her arms, into the flood below, and dis appeared in a moment. The mother, struck with instant sur prise, and makin g an effort to save him, plunged in after ; but far from being able to assist the infant, she herself with great difficulty escaped to the opposite shore, just when some French soldiers were plundering the country on that side, who imme diately made her their prisoner. \" As the war was then carried on between the French and Italians with the utmost inhumanity, they were going at once"], [213, "173 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. to perpetrate those two extremes suggested by appetite and cruelty. This base resolution, however, was opposed by a young officer, who, though their retreat required the utmost expedition, placed her behind him, and brought her in safety to his native city. Her beauty at first caught his eye ; her merit, soon after, his heart. They were married : he rose to the highest posts ; they lived long together, and were happy. But the felicity of a soldier can never be called per manent : after an interval of several years, the troops which he commanded having met with a repulse, he was obliged to take shelter in the city where he had lived with his wife. Here they suffered a siege, and the city at length was taken. Few histories can produce more various instances of cruelty than those which the French and Italians at that time exercised upon each other. It was resolved by the victors, upon this occasion, to put all the French prisoners to death ; but par ticularly the hnsband of the unfortunate Matilda, as he was principally instrumental in protracting the siege. Their de terminations were, in general, executed almost as soon as re solved upon. The captive soldier was led forth, and the exe cutioner with his sword stood ready, Avhile the spectators Avith gloomy silence awaited the fatal bloAv, which was only sus pended till the general, who presided as judge, should give the signal. It was in this interval of anguish and expectation, that Matilda came to take her last farewell of her husband and deliverer, deploring her wretched situation, and the cruelty of fate, that had saved her from perishing by a prema ture death in the river Volturna, to be the spectator of still greater calamities. The general, who was a young man, was struck with surprise at her beauty, and pity at her distress ; but with still stronger emotions when he heard her mention her former danger. He was her son, the infant for whom she had encountered so much danger. He acknoAvledged her at orce as his mother, and fell at her feet. The rest may be easily supposed; the captive was set free, and all the happiness that love, friendship, and duty, could confer on earth, were united.\" In this manner I would attempt to amuse my daughter :"], [214, "174 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. but she listened with divided attention; for her own mis fortunes engrossed all the pity she once had for those of another, and nothing gave her ease. In company she dreaded contempt ; and in solitude she only found anxiety. Such was the colour of her wretchedness, when we received cer tain information that Mr. Thornhill was going to be married to Miss Wilmot, for whom I always suspected he had a real passion, though he took every opportunity before me to ex press his contempt both of her person and fortune. This news only served to increase poor Olivia's affliction : such a flagrant breach of fidelity was more than her courage could support. I was resolved, however, to get more certain infor mation, and to defeat, if possible, the completion of his designs, by sending my son to old Mr. Wilmot's with instruc tions to know the truth of the report, and to deliver Miss Wilmot a letter, intimating Mr. Thornhill's conduct in my family. My son went in pursuance of my directions, and in three days returned, assuring us of the truth of the account; but that he had found it impossible to deliver the letter, which he was therefore obliged to leave, as Mr. Thornhill and Miss Wdmot were visiting round the country. They were to be married, he said, in a few days, having appeared together at church the Sunday before he was there, in great splendour, the bride attended by six young ladies, and he by as many gentlemen. Their approaching nuptials filled the Avhole country with rejoicing, and they usually rode out together in the grandest equipage that had been seen in the country for many years. All the friends of both families, he said, Avere there, particularly the Squire's uncle, Sir William Thornhill, Avho bore so good a character. He added, that nothing but mirth and feasting were going forward ; that all the country praised the young bride's beauty, and the bridegroom's fine person, and that they were immensely fond of each other ; concluding, that he could not help thinking Mr. Thornhill one of the most happy men in the world. \" Why, let him if he can,\" returned I; \" but my son, observe this bed of straw, and unsheltering roof ; those"], [215, "VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. 175 mouldering walls and humid floor ; my wretched body thus disabled by fire, and my children weeping round me for bread : you have come home, my child, to all this \u2014 yet here, even here, you see a man that would not for a thousand worlds exchange situations.

A supply of provisions, charitably sent us by my kind parishioners, seemed to diffuse new cheer fulness among the rest of the family, nor was I displeased at seeing them once more sprightly and at ease. It would haA7e been unjust to damp their satisfactions, merely to condole with resolute melancholy, or to burden them with a sadness they did not feel.

FRESH CALAMITIES. he next morning the sun rose with peculiar warmth for the season, so that we agreed to breakfast together on the honeysuckle bank ; where, while we sat, my youngest daughter, at my request, joined her voice to the concert on the trees about us. It was in this place my poor Olivia first met her seducer, and every object served to recal her sadness. But that melancholy which is excited by objects of pleasure or inspired by sounds of harmony, soothes the heart instead of corroding it. Her mother, too, upon this occasion, felt a pleasing distress, and wept, and loved her daughter as before. \" Do, my pretty Olivia,\" cried she, \" let us have that little melancholy air your papa was so fond of: your sister Sophy 23"], [218, "178 A'lCAR OF AVAKEFIELD. has already obliged us. Do, child ; it will please your old father.\" She complied in a manner so exquisitely pathetic as moved me : \u2014 AVhen lovely Avoman stoops to folly, And finds too late that men betray, What charm can soothe her melancholy ? AVhat art can wash her guilt aAvay ? The only art her guilt to cover, To hide her shame from every eye, To give repentance to her lover, And wring his bosom, is \u2014 to die. As she was concluding the last stanza, to Avhich an inter ruption in her voice from sorrow gave peculiar softness, the appearance of Mr. Thornhill's equipage at a distance alarmed us all, but particularly increased the uneasiness of my eldest daughter, who, desirous of shunning her betrayer, returned to the house with her sister. In a few minutes he alighted from his chariot, and, making up to the place where I was still sitting, inquired after my health with his usual air of familiarity. \" Sir,\" replied I, \"your present assurance only serves to aggravate the baseness of your character ; and there Avas a time when I would have chastised your insolence for presuming thus to appear before me. But now you are safe; for age has cooled my passions, and my calling restrains them.\" \" I vow, my dear Sir,\" returned he, \" I am amazed at all this ; nor can I understand what it means ! I hope you don't think your daughter's late excursion with me had anything criminal in it ?\" \" Go!\" cried I; \"thou art a wretch, a poor pitiful wretch, and every way a liar : but your meanness secures you from my anger !

We can marry her to another in a short time, and, what is more, she may keep her lover beside ; for I protest I shall ever continue to have a true regard for her.\" I found all my passions alarmed at this new degrading proposal : for though the mind may often be calm under great injuries, little villany can at any time get within the soul, and sting it into rage. \" Avoid my sight, thou reptile !\" cried I, \" nor continue to insult me with thy presence. Were my brave son at home, he Avould not suffer this ; but I am old and disabled, and every way undone.\" \" I find,\" cried he, \" you are bent upon obliging me to talk in a harsher manner than I intended.

My attorney to whom your late bond has been transferred, threatens hard, nor do I knoAv how to prevent the course of justice, except by paying the money myself; Avhich as I have been at some expenses lately, previous to my intended marriage, is not so easy to be done. And then my steward talks of driving for the rent \u2014 it is certain he knows his duty ; for I never trouble myself with affairs of that nature. Yet still I could wish to serve you, and even to have you and your daughter present at my marriage, which is shortly to be solemnized with Miss Wilmot ; it is even the request of my charming Arabella herself, whom I hope you will not refuse.\" \" Mr. Thornhill,\" replied I, \" hear me once for all. As to your marriage with any but my daughter, that I never will consent to ; and though your friendship could raise me to a throne, or your resentment sink me to the grave, yet would I despise both.

My wife and son, who Avere present at this interview, seemed terrified Avith apprehension. My daughters also, finding that he was gone, came out to be informed of the result of our conference, Avhich, Avhen known, alarmed them not less than the rest.

The consequence of my incapa city was his driving off my cattle that evening, and their being appraised and sold the next day for less than half their value. My wife and children now therefore entreated me to comply upon any terms, rather than incur certain destruction. They even begged of me to admit his visits once more, and used all their little eloquence to paint the calamities I was going to endure \u2014 the terrors of a prison in so rigorous a season as the present, with the danger that threatened my health from the late accident that happened by the fire.

If we are to be taken from this abode, only let us hold to the right ; and Avherever we are thrown, we can still retire to a charming apartment, when we can look round our own hearts with intrepidity and with pleasure !\" In this manner we spent that evening. Early the next morning, as the snoAV had fallen in great abundance in the night, my son was employed in clearing it away, and opening a passage before the door. He had not been thus engaged long, when he came running in, with looks all pale, to tell us that two strangers, whom he knew to be officers of justice, were making towards the house. Just as he spoke they came in, and, approaching the bed where I lay, after previously informing me of their employ ment and business, made me their prisoner, bidding me prepare to go with them to the county jail, which was eleven miles off. \" My friends,\" said I, \" this is severe Aveather in Avhich you haA7e corne to take me to a prison ; and it is particu larly unfortunate at this time, as one of my arms has lately been burnt in a terrible manner, and it has thrown me into a slight fever, and I want clothes to cover me, and I am now too weak and old to walk far in such deep snow ; but if it must be so \" ,3 I then turned to my wife and children, and directed them to get together what few things were left us, and to prepare immediately for leaving this place.

My son led one of the little ones by the hand, and my wife the other, while I leaned upon my youngest girl, whose tears fell not for her own, but my distresses.

The con sequences might have been fatal had I not immediately inter posed, and with some difficulty rescued the officers from the hands of the enraged multitude. My children, who looked upon my delivery now as certain, appeared transported with joy, and were incapable of containing their raptures. But they were soon undeceived, upon hearing me address the poor deluded people, who came, as they imagined, to do me service. \" What ! my friends,\" cried I, \" and is this the way you love me ? Is this the manner you obey the instructions I have given you from the pulpit \u2014 thus to fly in the face of justice, and bring down ruin on yourselves and me ? Which is your ringleader ?

I shall yet, perhaps, one day see you in greater felicity here, and contribute to make your lives more happy. But let it at least be my comfort, when I pen my fold for immortality, that not one here shall be wanting.\" They now seemed all repentance, and, melting into tears, came one after the other to bid me farewell. I shook each tenderly by the hand, and, leaving them my blessing, pro ceeded forward without meeting any further interruption. Some hours before night we reached the town, or rather village \u2014 for it consisted but of a few mean houses, having lost all its former opulence, and retaining no marks of its ancient superiority but the jail. Upon entering, we put up at the inn, where we had such refreshments as could be most readily procured, and I supped with my family with my usual cheerfulness . After seeing them properly accommodated for that night, I next attended the sheriff's officers to the prison, which had formerly been built for the purposes of war, and consisted of one large apartment, 24"], [226, "186 A'lCAR OF WAKEFIELD. strongly grated and paved with stone, common to both felons and debtors at certain hours in the four-and-twenty. Besides this, every prisoner had a separate cell, w7here he was locked in for the night. I expected, upon my entrance, to find nothing but lamen tations, and various sounds of misery; but it was very different. The prisoners seemed all employed in one common design, that of forgetting thought in merriment and clamour. I was apprised of the usual perquisites required upon these oc casions, and immediately complied Avith the demand, though the little money I had was very near being all exhausted. This was immediately sent away for liquor, and the whole prison soon was filled with riot, laughter, aud profaneness. \" How,\" cried I to myself, \" shall men so very wicked be cheerful, and shall I be melancholy ? I feel only the same confinement with them, and I think I have more reason to be happy.\" With such reflections I laboured to become cheerful ; but cheerfulness was never yet produced by effort, which is itself painful. As I was sitting, therefore, in a corner of the jail, in a pensive posture, one of my fellow-prisoners came up, and, sitting by me, entered into conversation. It was my constant rule in life, never to avoid the conversation of any man who seemed to desire it ; for if good, I might profit by his instruction ; if bad, he might be assisted by mine. I found this to be a knoAving man, of strong unlettered sense, but a thorough knowledge of the world, as it is called, or more properly speaking, of human nature on the wrong side. He asked me if I had taken care to provide myself with a bed, which was a circumstance I had neA7er once attended to. \" That's unfortunate,\" cried he, \" as you are allowed here nothing but straw, and your apartment is very large and cold. HoAvever, you seem to be something of a gentleman, and as I have been one myself in my time, part of my bed-clothes are heartily at your service.\" I thanked him, professing my surprise at finding such humanity in a jail, in misfortunes ; adding, to let him see that"], [227, "VICAR OF WAKEF'ELP 187 I was a scholar,\" That the ancient sage seemed to understand the value of company in affliction, when he said,'Ton kosmon aire, ei dos ton etairon .-' and in fact,\" continued I \" Avhat is the w7orld if it affords only solitude ?\" \" You talk of the world, sir,\" returned my fellow-prisoner ; \" the world is in its dotage ; and yet the cosmogony or creation of the world has puzzled the philosophers of every age.

The latter has these words, 'Anarchon ara kai atelutaion to pan,' which implies \u2014 \" \u2014 \" I ask pardon, sir,\" cried I,\" for interrupting"], [228, "188 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. so much learning, but I think I have heard all this before. Have I not had the pleasure of once seeing you at Wellbridge fair ; and is not your name Ephraim Jenkinson ?\" At this demand he only sighed. \" I suppose you must recollect,\" resumed I, \" one Doctor Primrose, from whom you bought a horse ?\" He now at once recollected me ; for the gloominess of the place and the approaching night had prevented his distin guishing my features before. \" Yes, sir,\" returned Mr. Jen kinson, \" I remember you perfectly well ; I bought a horse but forgot to pay for him. Your neighbour Flamborough is the only prosecutor I am any way afraid of at the next assizes, for he intends to swear positively against me as a coiner. I am heartily sorry, sir, I ever deceived you, or indeed any man ; for you see,\" continued he, shoAving his shackles, \" what my tricks have brought me to.\" \" Well , sir,\" replied I, your kindness in offering me as sistance when you could expect no return, shall be repaid with my endeavours to soften, or totally suppress, Mr. Flam borough's evidence, and I will send my son to him for that purpose the first opportunity ; nor do I in the least doubt but he will comply with my request; and as to my own eAadence you need be under no uneasiness about that.\" \" Well, sir,\" cried he, \" all the return I can make shall be yours. You shall have more than half my bed-clothes to night ; and I'll take care to stand your friend in the prison, where I think I have some influence.\" I thanked him ; and could not avoid being surprised at the present youthful change in his aspect, for at the time I had seen him before he appeared at least sixty. \" Sir,\" answered he, \" you are little acquainted with the world ; I had, at the time, false hair, and have learned the art of counterfeiting every age from seventeen to seventy. Ah, sir ! had I but bestowed half the pains in learning a trade that I have in learning to be a scoundrel, I might have been a rich man at this day. But, rogue as I am, still I may be your friend, and that, perhaps, when you least expect it.\""], [229, "189 VICAR OF AVAKEFIELD. We were now prevented from further conversation by the arrival of the jailor's servants, who came to call over the prisoner's names, and lock up for the night.

They informed me that yesterday's uneasiness and fatigue had increased her fever, and it was judged proper to leave her behind. My next care was to send my son to procure a room or two to lodge the family in, as near the prison as conveniently could be found. He obeyed ; but could only find one apartment, which Avas"], [231, ""], [232, "THE VICAR IN PRISON."], [233, "VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. 191 hired at a small expense for his mother and sisters, the jailor with humanity consenting to let him and his two little brothers lie in the prison with me. A bed was therefore prepared for them in a corner of the room, which I thought auswered very conveniently. I was willing, however, pre viously to know whether my little children chose to lie in a place which seemed to fright them upon entrance. \" Well,\" cried I, \" my good boys, how do you like your Ded ? I hope you are not afraid to lie in this room, dark as it appears ?\" \" No papa,\" says Dick, \" I am not afraid to lie anywhere where you are.\" \" And I,\" says Bill, who was yet but four years old, \" love every place best that my papa is in.\" After this I allotted to each of the family what they were to do. My daughter Avas particularly directed to watch her sister's declining health ; my wife was to attend me ; my little boys were to read to me. \"And as for you, my son, con tinued I, \" it is by the labour of your hands we must all hope to be supported. Your wages as a day-labourer will be fully sufficient, with proper frugality, to maintain us all, and comfortably too. Thou art now sixteen years old, and hast strength ; and it was given thee, my son, for very useful pur poses, for it must save from famine your helpless parents and family. Prepare, then, this evening to look out for work against to-morrow, and bring home every night what money you earn for our support.\" Having thus instructed him, and settled the rest, I walked down to the common prison, where I could enjoy more air and room. But I was not long there when the execrations, lewd ness, and brutality that invaded me on every side drove me back to my apartment again. Here I sat for some time pondering upon the strange infatuation of wretches, who, finding all mankind in open arms against them, were labour ing to make themselves a future and a tremendous enemy. Their insensibility excited my highest compassion, and blotted my OAvn uneasiness from my mind. It even appeared"], [234, "192 A7ICAR OF AVAKEFIELD. a duty incumbent upon me to attempt to reclaim them. I resolved, therefore, once more to return, and, in spite of their contempt, to give them my advice and conquer them by my perseverance. Going, therefore, among them again, I in formed Mr. Jenkinson of my design, at which he laughed heartily, but communicated it to the rest. The proposal was received with the greatest good humour as it promised to afford a new fund of entertainment to persons who had now no other resource for mirth but what could be derived from ridicule or debauchery. I therefore read them a portion of the service with a loud unaffected voice, and found my audience perfectly merry upon the occasion. Lewd whispers, groans of contrition burlesqued, winking and coughing, alternately excited laughter. How ever, I continued with my natural solemnity to read on, sensible that what I did might mend some, but could itself receive no contamination from any. After reading, I entered upon my exhortation, which was rather calculated at first to amuse them than to reprove. I previously observed, that no other motive but their welfare could induce me to this ; that I was their fellow- prisoner, and now got nothing by preaching. I was sorry, I said, to hear them so very profane ; because they got nothing by it, but might lose a great deal : \" For be assured, my friends,\" cried, I \u2014 \" for you are my friends, however the world may disclaim your friendship \u2014 though you swore a thousand oaths in a day, it would not put one penny in your purse. Then what signifies calling every moment upon the devil, and courting his friendship, since you find how scurvily he uses you?

And yet, how are you more wise ?

I therefore promised to repeat 25"], [236, "194 VICAR OF AVAKEFIELD. my lecture next day, and actually conceived some hopes of making a reformation here ; for it had ever been my opinion, that no man was past the hour of amendment, every heart lying open to the shafts of reproof, if the archer could but take a proper aim. When I had thus satisfied my mind, I went back to my apartment, where my wife prepared a frugal meal, while Mr. Jenkinson begged leave to add his dinner to ours, and partake of the pleasure, as he was kind enough to express it, of my conversation. He had not seen my family ; for as they came to my apartment by a door in the narrow passage already described, by this means they avoided the common prison. Jenkinson, at the first interview, therefore, seemed not a little struck with the beauty of my youngest daughter, which her pensive air contributed to heighten ; and my little ones did not pass unnoticed. \" Alas, Doctor,\" cried he, \" these children are too handsome and too good for such a place as this !\" \" Why, Mr. Jenkinson,\" replied I, \" thank Heaven, my children are pretty tolerable in morals ; and if they be good it matters little for the rest.\" \"I fancy, sir, returned my fellow-prisoner, \" that it must give you great comfort to have all this little family about you \" \" A comfort, Mr. Jenkinson !\" replied I ; \" yes, it is indeed a comfort, and I would not be without them for all the world ; for they can make a dungeon seem a palace. There is but one way in this life of Avounding my happiness, and that is by injuring them.\" \" I am afraid, then, sir,\" cried he, \" that I am in some measure culpable ; for I think I see here (looking at my son Moses) one that I have injured, and by whom I wish to be forgiven.\" My son immediately recollected his voice and features, though he had before seen him in disguise, and taking him by the hand, with a smile, forgave him. \" Yet,\" continued he, \" I can't help wondering at what you could see in my face, to think me a proper mark for deception.\""], [237, "A'lCAR OF WAKEFIELD. 195 \" My dear sir,\" returned the other, \" it was not your face, but your white stockings, and the black riband in your hair that allured me. But, no disparagement to your parts, I have deceived wiser men than you in my time ; and yet, with all my tricks, the blockheads have been too many for me at last.\" \"I suppose,\" cried my son, \"that the narrative of such a life as yours must be extremely instructive and amusing.\" \" Not much of either,\" returned Mr. Jenkinson. \" Those relations which describe the tricks and vices only of mankind, by increasing our suspicion in life, retard our success. The traveller who distrusts every person he meets, and turns back upon the appearance of every man who looks like a robber, seldom arrives in time at his journey's end. \" Indeed, I think, from my own experience, that the knowing one is the silliest fellow under the sun. I w7as thought cunning from my very chilhood : when but seven years old, the ladies would say that I was a perfect little man; at fourteen, I knew the world, cocked my hat, and loved the ladies ; at twenty, though I Avas perfectly honest, yet every one thought me so cunning that not one would trust me. Thus I was at last obliged to turn sharper in my own defence, and have lived ever since, my head throbbing with schemes to deceive, and my heart palpitating with fears of detection. I used often to laugh at your honest, simple neighbour Flamborough ; and, one way or another, generally cheated him once a year. Yet still the honest man went forward without suspicion, and grew rich, while I still continued tricksy and cunning, and was poor, without the consolation of being honest. How ever,\" continued he, \" let me know your case, and what has brought you here ; perhaps, though I have not skill to avoid a jail myself, I may extricate my friends.\" In compliance with his curiosity, I informed him of the Avhole train of accidents and follies that had plunged me mto my present troubles, and my utter inability to get free"], [238, "196 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD.

Yes, my treasures, if I can mend them, I will : perhaps they will not all despise me. Perhaps I may catch up even one from the gulf, and that will be great gain : for is there upon earth a gem so precious as the human soul ?\" Thus saying, I left them, and descended to the common prison, where I found the prisoners very merry, expecting my arrival ; and each prepared with some j ad trick to play upon the doctor.

A third would cry \" Amen !\" in such an affected tone as gave the rest great delight. A fourth had slily picked my pocket of my spectacles. But there was one Avhose trick gave more universal pleasure than all the rest; for, observing the manner in which I had disposed my books on the table before me, he very dexterously displaced one of them, and put an obscene jest-book of his OAvn in the place. However, I took no notice of all that this mischievous group of little beings could do, but went on, perfectly sensible, that what was ridiculous in my attempt would excite mirth only the first or second time, Avhile what was serious would be permanent. My design succeeded, and in less than six days some Avere penitent, and all attentive. It was now that I applauded my perseverance and address at thus giving sensibility to Avretches divested of every moral feeling, and now began to think of doing them temporal services also, by rendering their situation somewhat more comfortable. Their time had hitherto been divided between famine and excess, tumultous riot and bitter repining. Their only employment was quarrelling among each other, playing at cribbage, and cutting tobacco-stoppers. From this last mode of idle industry I took the hint of setting such as chose to work at cutting pegs for tobacconists and shoemakers \u2014 the proper wood being bought by a general subscription \u2014 and Avhen manufactured, sold by my appointment ; so that each earned something every day \u2014 a trifle indeed, but sufficient to maintain him. I did not stop here, but instituted fines for the punishment of immorality, and rewards for peculiar industry. Thus, in less than a fortnight I had formed them into something social and humane, and had the pleasure of regarding myself as a legislator, Avho had brought men from their native ferocity into friendship and obedience. And it were highly to be wished, that legislative power would thus direct the laAv rather to reformation than severity:"], [242, "200 A'lCAR OF AVAKEFIELD that it w7ould seem conAinced, that the work of eradicating crimes is not by making punishments famdiar, but formidable. Then, instead of our present prisons, which find or make men guilty, w7hich enclose wretches for the commission of one crime and return them, if returned alive, fitted for the perpretration of thousands, we should see, as in other parts of Europe, places of penitence and solitude, where the accused might be attended by such as could give them repentance, if guilty, or new motives to virtue, if innocent. And this, but not the increasing punishments, is the Avay to mend a state. Nor can I aA'oid even questioning the validity of that right which social combinations have assumed, of capitally punishing offences of a slight nature In cases of murder their right is obvious, as it is the duty of us all, from the law of self-defence, to cut off that man who has shown a disregard for the life of another. Against such, all nature rises in arms : but it is not so against him who steals my property. Natural law gives me no right to take away his life, as by that, the horse he steals is as much his property as mine. If, then, I have any right, it must be from a compact made between us, that he who depriA7es the other of his horse shall die. But this is a false compact; because no man has a right to barter his life any more than to take it away, as it is not his own. And besides, the compact is inadequate, and would be set aside even in a court of modern equity, as there is a great penalty for a very trifling convenience, since it is far better that two men should live than that one man should ride. But a compact that is false between tAvo men, is equally so between a hundred, or a hundred thousand ; for as ten millions of circles can never make a square, so the united voice of myriads cannot lend the smallest foun dation to falsehood. It is thus that reason speaks; and untutored nature says the same thing. Savages, that are directed by natural law alone, are very tender of the lives of each other ; they seldom shed blood but to retaliate former cruelty. Our Saxon ancestors, fierce as they were in war, had but few executions in times of peace ; and in all commencing"], [243, "VICAR OF AVAKEFIELD. 201 governments that have the print of nature still strong upon. them, scarcely any crime is held capital. It is among the citizens of a refined community that penal laws, which are in the hands of the rich, are laid upon the poor. Government, while it grows older, seems to acquire the moroseness of age ; and, as if our property were become dearer in proportion as it increased \u2014 as if the more enormous our wealth, the more extensive our fears \u2014 all our possessions are paled up with new edicts every day, and hung round with gibbets to scare every invader I cannot tell whether it is from the number of our penal laws, or the licentiousness of our people, that this country should show more convicts in a year than half the dominions of Europe united. Perhaps it is owing to both ; for they mutually produce each other. When, by indiscriminate penal laws, a nation beholds the same punishment affixed to dissi milar degrees of guilt, from perceiving no distinction in the penalty, the people are led to lose all sense of distinction in crime, and this distinction is the bulwark of all morality: thus the multitude of laws produce new vices, and new vices call for fresh restraints."], [244, "202 A1CAR OF AVAKEFIELD. If it were to be wished, then, that power, instead of con- triving new laws to punish vice ; instead of draAving hard the cords of society till a convulsion come to burst them ; instead of cutting away wretches as useless before we have tried their utility ; instead of converting correction into vengeance \u2014 it were to be wished that we tried the restrictive arts of goA7ernment, and made law the protector, but not the tyrant, of the people. We should then find that creatures, whose souls are held as dross, only wanted the hand of a refiner : we should then find that creatures, noAV stuck up for long tortures, lest luxury should feel a momentary pang, might, if properly treated, serve to sinew the state in times of danger ; that as their faces are like ours, their hearts are so too ; that few minds are so base as that perseverance cannot amend ; that a man may see his last crime without dying for it ; and that very little blood will serve to cement our security."], [245, "CHAPTER XXVIII.

He observed, that the rest of my family was not to be sacrificed to the peace of one child alone, and she the only one that had offended me. \" Besides,\" added he, \"I don't know if it be just thus to obstruct the union of man and wife, which you do at present, by refusing to consent to a match you cannot hinder, but may render unhappy.\" \" Sir,\" replied I, \" you are unacquainted with the man that oppresses us.

I would advise you to send him a letter by the post, intimating all his nepheAv's ill usage, and my life for it, that in three days you shall have an answer.\" I thanked him for the hint, and instantly set about complying ; but I wanted paper, and unluckily all our money had been laid out that morning in provisions\u2014 howeA'er, he supplied me. For the three ensuing days I was in a state of anxiety to know what reception my letter might meet with ; but in the meantime was frequently solicited by my wife to submit to any conditions rather than remain here, and every hour received repeated accounts of the decline of my daughter's health. The third day and the fourth arrived, but I received no answer to my letter \u2014 the complaints of a stranger against a favourite nephew were no way likely to succeed ; so that these hopes soon vanished like all my former. My mind, however, still supported itself, though confinement and bad air began to make a visible alteration in my health ; and my arm that had suffered in the fire grew worse. My children, however, sat by me, and, while I was stretched on my straw, read to me by turns, or listened and wept at my instructions. But my daughter's health declining faster than mine, every message"], [248, "206 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD from her contributed to increase my apprehensions and pain. The fifth morning after I had Avritten the letter which was sent to .'Sir William Thornhill, I was alarmed with an account that she was speechless. Now it was that confinement was truly painful to me ; my soul was bursting from its prison to be near the pillow of my child, to comfort her, to strengthen her, to receive her last wishes, and teach her soul the way to Heaven ! Another account came \u2014 she was expiring \u2014 and yet I was debarred the small comfort of weeping by her. My fellow-prisoner, some time after, came with the last account ; he bade me be patient \u2014 she was dead ! The next morning he returned, and found me with my two little ones, now my only companions, who were using all their innocent efforts to comfort me. They entreated to read to me, and bade me not to cry, for I was noAv too old to weep. \" And is not my sister an angel now, papa ?\" cried the eldest ; \"and why, then, are you sorry for her ? I wish I were an angel, out of this frightful place, if my papa were with me.\" \u2014 \"Yes,\" added my youngest darling, \"Heaven, Avhere my sister is, is a finer place than this, and there are none but good people there, and the people here are very bad.\""], [249, "207 A/I0AR OF AVAKEFIELD. Mr. Jenkinson interrupted their harmless prattle by observing, that, noAv my daughter was no more, I should seriously think of the rest of my family, and attempt to save my OAvn life, which was every day declining for want of neces saries and wholesome air. He added, that it was now in cumbent on me to sacrifice any pride or resentment of my own to the welfare of those Avho depended on me for support ; and that I Avas now, both by reason and justice, obliged to try to reconcile my landlord. 'Heaven be praised,\" replied I, \" there is no pride left me now : I should detest my own heart if I saw either pride or resentment lurking there.

I am now willing to approve his marriage; and if this submission can do him any pleasure, let him know that if I have done him any injury, I am sorry for it.\" Mr. Jenkinson took pen and ink, and wrote down my sub mission nearly as I have expressed it, to which I signed my name. My son was employed to carry the letter to Mr. Thornhill, Avho was then at his seat in the country. He went, and, in about six hours, returned Avith a verbal ansAver.

He continued to inform us that he stept up in the humblest manner, and de livered the letter, which, when Mr. Thornhill had read, he said that all submission was now too late and unnecessary \u2014 that he had heard of our application to his uncle, which met with the contempt it deserved ; and, as for the rest, that all fu ture applications should be directed to his attorney, not to him.

I am now drawing towards an abode that looks brighter as I approach it. This expectation cheers my afflictions ; and though I leave a helpless family of orphans behind me, yet they will not be utterly forsaken. Some friend, perhaps, will be found to assist them for the sake of their poor father, and some may charitably relieve them for the sake of their Heavenly Father.\" Just as I spoke, my wife, whom I had not seen that day before, appeared with looks of terror, and making efforts, but unable to speak. \"Why, my love,\" cried I, \"Avhy will you thus increase my afflictions by your own ?

My Sophia, my dearest, is gone \u2014 snatched from us, carried off by ruffians !\" \u2014 \"How, madam !\" cried my fellow-prisoner, \" Miss Sophia carried off by villains ! sure it cannot be.\" She could only answer with a fixed look, and a flood of tears. But one of the prisoner's wives, who was present, and came in with her, gave us a more distinct account. She in formed us, that as my wife, my daughter, and herself, were taking a walk together on the great road, a little way out of the village, a post-chaise and pair drove up to them, and in stantly stopped ; upon which a Avell-dressed man, but not Mr. Thornhill, stepped out and clasped my daughter round the waist; and, forcing her in, bade the postillion drive on, so that they were out of sight in a moment. \"Now,\" cried I, \"the sum of my miseries is made up, nor is it in the poAver of anything on earth to give me another"], [251, "A' I CAR OF AVAKEFIELD. 209 pang.

Our distresses are great, but I could bear this and more, if I saw you but easy. They may take away my children and all the world if they leave me but you.\" My son, Avho was present, endeavoured to moderate our grief; he bade us take comfort, for he hoped that we might still have reason to be thankful. \" My chdd,\" cried I, \" look round the world, and see if there be any happiness left me now.

His letter brings nothing but good news ; he is the favourite of his colonel, who promises to procure him the very next lieutenancy that becomes A7acant.\" \" And are you sure of all this ?\" cried my wife ; \" are you sure that nothing ill has befallen my boy ?\" \u2014 \" Nothing, indeed, madam,\" returned my son ; \"you shall see the letter, which will give you the highest pleasure ; and if anything can procure you comfort, I am sure that will.\" \u2014 \" But are you sure,\" still repeated she, \"that the letter is from himself, and that he is really so happy ?\" \u2014 \" Yes, madam,\" replied he, \" it is certainly his, and he will one day be the credit and support of our famdy.\" \u2014 \" Then, I thank Providence,\" cried she, \" that my last letter to him has miscarried. Yes, my dear,\" continued she, turning to me, \" I will now confess, that though the hand of Heaven is sore upon us in other instances, it has been favourable here.

Olivia and Sophia, too, promised to Avrite, but seem to have forgotten me. Tell them they are two arrant little baggages, and that I am, at this moment, in a most violent passion with them ; yet still I know not how, though I want to bluster a little, my heart is respondent only to softer emotions. Then, tell them, sir, that, after all, I love them affectionately ; and be assured of my ever remaining Your dutiful son.\" \" In aU our miseries,\" cried I, \" what thanks have we not to return, that one at least of our family is exempted from what we suffer.

I wounded one avIio first assaulted me, and I fear desperately ; but the rest made me their prisoner.

Though we should ex- amine the whole world, we shall not find one man so happy as to have nothing left to wish for ; but we daily see thousands, Avho, by suicide, show us they haA7e nothing left to hope. In this life, then, it appears that we cannot be entirely blest, but yet Ave may be completely miserable."], [261, "VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. 217 Why man should thus feel pain : why our wretchedness should be requisite in the formation of universal felicity ; why, when all other systems are made perfect by the perfection of their subordinate parts, the great system should require for its perfection parts that are not only subordinate to others, but imperfect in themselves \u2014 these are questions that never can be explained, and might be useless if known. On this subject, Providence has thought fit to elude our curiosity, satisfied with granting us motives to consolation. In this situation man has called in the friendly assistance of philosophy ; and Heaven, seeing the incapacity of that to console him, has given him the aid of religion. The con solations of philosophy are very amusing, but often fallacious \u2014 it tells us that life is filled with comforts, if we wdl but enjoy 28"], [262, "218 A7ICAR OF WAKEFIELD. them \u2014 and, on the other hand, that though we unavoidably have miseries here, life is short, and they will soon be over. Thus do these consolations destroy each other ; for, if life is a place of comfort, its shortness must be misery, and if it be long, our griefs are protracted. Thus philosophy is weak ; but religion comforts in a higher strain. Man is here, it tells us, fitting up his mind, and preparing it for another abode. When the good man leaves the body, and is all a glorious mind, he will find he has been making himself a heaven of happiness here ; while the wretch that has been maimedand contaminated by his vices, shrinks from his body with terror, and finds that he has anticipated the vengeance of Heaven. To religion, then we must hold, in every circumstance of life, for our truest comfort ; for if already we are happy, it is a pleasure to think that we can make that happiness unending \u2014 and if we are miserable, it is very consoling to think that there is a place of rest. Thus, to the fortunate, religion holds out a continuance of bliss ; to the wretched, a change from pain. But though religion is very kind to all men, it has promised peculiar reAvards to the unhappy ; the sick, the naked, the houseless, the heavy laden, and the prisoner, have ever most frequent promises in our sacred law. The author of our religion everywhere professes himself the Avretch's friend, and unlike the false ones of this world, bestows all his caresses upon the forlorn. The unthinking have censured this as partiality, as a reference without merit to deserve it. But they never reflect, that it is not in the power even of Heaven itself to make the offer of unceasing felicity as great a gift to the happy as to the miserable. To the first, eternity is but a single blessing, since at most it but increases what they already possess. To the latter, it is a double advantage ; for it diminishes their pain here, and rewards them with heavenly bliss hereafter. But Providence is in another respect kinder to the poor than to the rich ; for as it thus makes the life after death more desirable, so it smooths the passage there. The wretched have had a long familiarity with every face of terror. The"], [263, "VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. 219 man of sorrows lays himself quietly down, without possessions to regret, and but few ties to stop his departure ; he feels only nature's pang in the final separation, and this is no way greater than he has often fainted under before \u2014 for, after a certain degree of pain, every new breach that death opens in the constitution, nature kindly covers with insensibility. Thus Pro-vidence has given the wretched two advantages over the happy in this life \u2014 greater felicity in dying, and in Heaven all that superiority of pleasure which arises from contrasted enjoyment. And this superiority, my friends, is no small advantage, and seems to be one of the pleasures of the poor man in the parable ; for though he was already in Heaven, and felt all the raptures it could give, yet it was mentioned as an addition to his happiness, that he had once been wretched, and now was comforted \u2014 that he had known what it was to be miserable, and now felt what it was to be happy. Thus, my friends, you see religion does what phdosophy would never do \u2014 it shows the equal dealings of Heaven to the happy and the unhappy, and levels all human enjoyments to nearly the same standard. It gives to both rich and poor the same happiness hereafter, and equal hopes to aspire after it ; but, if the rich have the advantage of enjoying pleasures here, the poor have the endless satisfaction of knowing what it was once to be miserable, when crowned with endless felicity here after ; and even though this should be called a small advantage, yet, being an eternal one, it must make up by duration Avhat the temporal happiness of the great may have exceeded by intenseness. These are, therefore, the consolations which the wretched have peculiar to themselves, and in which they are above the rest of mankind ; in other respects they are below them. They who would know the miseries of the poor, must see life and endure it. To declaim on the temporal advantages they enjoy, is only repeating what none either believe or practise. The men Avho have the necessaries of living are rot poor ; and they Avho want them, must be miserable. Yes, my friends,"], [264, "220 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. we must be miserable. No vain effort of a refined imagination can sooth the wants of nature, can give elastic sweetness to the dank vapour of a dungeon, or ease the throbbings of a broken heart. Let the philosopher from his couch of soft ness tell us that we can resist all these \u2014 alas ! the effort by which we resist them is still the greatest pain. Death is slight, and any man may sustain it ; but torments are dreadful, and these no man can endure. To us then, my friends, the promises of happiness in Heaven should be peculiarly dear ; for if our reward be in this life alone, we are then, indeed, of aU men the most miserable. When I look round these gloomy walls, made to terrify as well as to confine us \u2014 this light, that only serves to show the horrors of the place \u2014 those shackles, that tyranny has imposed or crime made necessary \u2014 when I survey these emaciated looks, and hear those groans \u2014 oh ! my friends, what a glorious exchange would Heaven be for these ! To fly through regions unconfined as air \u2014 to bask in the sunshine of eternal bliss \u2014 to carol over endless hymns of praise \u2014 to have no master to threaten or insult us, but the form of good ness himself for ever in our eyes ! \u2014 when I think of these things, death becomes the messenger of very glad tidings \u2014 when I think of these things, his sharpest arrow becomes the staff of my support \u2014 when I think of these things, what is there in life worth having ? \u2014 when I think of these things, what is there that should not be spurned away ? Kings in their palaces should groan for such advantages ; but we, humbled as we are, should yearn for them. And shall these things be ours ? Ours they will certainly be, if we but try for them ; and, what is a comfort, we are shut out from many temptations that would retard our pur suit. Only let us try for them, and they wiU certainly be ours ; and, what is stdl a comfort, shortly too : for, if we look back on a past life, it appears but a very short span, and whatever we may think of the rest of life, it will yet be found of less duration ; as we grow older, the days seem to grow shorter, and our intimacy Avith time ever lessens the percep-"], [265, "221 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. tion of his stay.

I thanked him for his clemency, and, grasping my boy's hand, bade him farewell, and be mindful of the great duty that was before him. I again, therefore, laid me down, and one of my little ones sat by my bed-side reading, Avhen Mr. Jenkinson entering, inform ed me that there was news of my daughter ; for that she Avas seen by a person about two hours before in a strange gentle man's company, and that they had stopped at a neighbouring"], [267, "VICAR OF AVAKEFIELD. 223 village for refreshment, and seemed as if returning to town. He had scarcely delivered this news, when the jador came, with looks of haste and pleasure, to inform me that my daughter was found. Moses came running in a moment after, crying out that his sister Sophia was below, and coming up with our old friend Mr. BurcheU. Just as he delivered this news, my dearest girl entered, and with looks almost Avild with pleasure, ran to kiss me, in a transport of affection. Her mother's tears and sdence also showed her pleasure. \" Here, papa,\" cried the charming girl, \" here is the brave man to whom I owe my delivery ; to this gentleman's intrepidity I am indebted for my happiness and safety \u2014 \" A kiss from Mr. Burchell, whose pleasure seemed even greater than hers, interrupted what she was going to add. \" Ah ! Mr. Burchell,\" cried I, \" this is but a wretched habitation you now find us in ; and we are now v7ery different from what you last saw us. You were ever our friend : we have long discovered our errors with regard to you, and re pented of our ingratitude. After the vile usage you then received at my hands, I am almost ashamed to behold your face ; yet I hope you'll forgive me, as I was deceived by a base ungenerous wretch, who, under the mask of friendship, has undone me.\" \" It is impossible,\" cried Mr. Burchell, \" that I should for give you, as you never deserved my resentment. I partly saw your delusion then, and as it was out of my power to res train, I could only pity it.\" \" It was ever my conjecture,\" cried I, \" that your mind was noble ; but now I find it so. But tell me, my dear child, how thou hast been relieved, or who the ruffians were who carried thee aAvay.\" \" Indeed, sir,\" replied she, \" as to the villain who carried me off, I am yet ignorant. For, as my mamma and I Avere walking out, he came behind us, and, almost before I could call for help, forced me into the post-chaise, and in an instant the horses drove away. I met several on the road to whom I cried out for assistance, but they disregarded my entreaties."], [268, "224 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. In the meantime, the ruffian himself used every art to hinder me from crying out : he flattered and threatened by turns, and swore that, if I continued but silent, he intended no harm. In the meantime I had broken the canvas that he had drawn up, and whom should I perceive at some distance but your old friend, Mr. Burchell, walking along with his usual swiftness, with the great stick for which we used so much to ridicule him. As soon as we came within hearing, I called out to him by name, and entreated his help. I repeated my exclamations several times, upon which, with a very loud voice, he bade the postilion stop ; but the boy took no notice, but drove on with stdl greater speed. I now thought he could never over take us, when, in less than a minute, I saw Mr. BurcheU come running up by the side of the horses, and, with one blow, knocked the postilion to the ground. The horses, when he was fallen, soon stopped of themselves, and the ruffian, stepping out, with oaths and menaces, drew his sword, and"], [269, "225 VICAR OF AVAKEFIELD. ordered him, at his peril, to retire ; but Mr. Burchell, running up, shivered his sword to pieces, and then pursued him for near a quarter of a mile , but he made his escape. I was at this time come out myself, willing to assist my deliverer, but he soon returned to me in triumph. The postilion, who was recovered, was going to make his escape too ; but Mr. Bur chell ordered him, at his peril, to mount again, and drive back to tOAvn. Finding it impossible to resist, he reluctantly com plied, though the wound he had received seemed, to me at least, to be dangerous. He continued to complain of the pain as we drove along, so that he at last excited Mr. Bur chell's companion, who, at my request, exchanged him for another, at an inn where we called on our return.\" \" Welcome, then,\" cried I, \" my child ! and thou, her gallant deliverer, a thousand welcomes ! Though our cheer is but wretched, yet our hearts are ready to receive you. And now, Mr. Burchell, as you delivered my girl, if you think her a recompence, she is yours : if you can stoop to an alliance with a family so poor as mine, take her, obtain her consent as I know you have her heart \u2014 and you have mine. And let me tell you, sir, that I give you no small treasure : she has been celebrated for beauty, it is true, but that is not my meaning \u2014 I give you up a treasure in her mind.\" \" But I suppose, sir,\" cried Mr. Burchell, \" that you are apprised of my circumstances, and of my incapacity to support her as she deserves?\" \" If your present objection,\" replied I, \" be meant as an evasion of my offer, I desist, but I know no man so worthy to deserve her as you ; and if I could give her thousands, and thousands sought her from me, yet my honest brave Burchell should be my dearest choice.\" To all this his silence alone seemed to give a mortifying refusal ; and, without the least reply to my offer, he demanded if he could not be furnished with refreshments from the next inn ; to which being answered in the affirmative, he ordered them to send in the best dinner that could be provided upon such short notice. He bespoke also a dozen of their best 2.9"], [270, "226 VICAR OF AVAKEFIELD wine, and some cordials for me ; adding, with a smile, that he would stretch a little for once, and though in a prison, asserted he was never better disposed to be merry. The Avaiter soon made his appearance, with preparations for dinner ; a table was lent us by the jador, who seemed remarkably assiduous ; the Avine was disposed in order, and tAvo very well dressed dishes were brought in. My daughter had not yet heard of her poor brother's melancholy situation, and we all seemed unwilling to damp her cheerfulness by the relation. But it was in vain that I attempted to appear cheerful : the circumstances of my un fortunate son broke through ad efforts to dissemble ; so that I Avas at last obliged to damp our mirth by relating his mis fortunes, and wishing that he might be permitted to share with us in this little interval of satisfaction. After my guests were recovered from the consternation my account had pro duced, I requested also that Mr. Jenkinson, a fellow-prisoner, might be admitted ; and the jailor granted my request with an air of unusual submission. The clanking of my son's irons was no sooner heard along the passage, than his sister ran impatiently to meet him ; while Mr. Burchell, in the mean time, asked me if my son's name was George ; to which replying in the affirmative, he still continued silent. As soon as my boy entered the room, I could perceive he regarded Mr. Burchell with a look of astonishment and reverence. \" Come on,\" cried I, \" my son ; though we are faden very low, yet Providence has been pleased to grant us some small relaxation from pain Thy sister is restored to us, and there is her deliverer \u2014 to that brave man it is that I am indebted for yet having a daughter ; give him, my boy, the hand of friendship ; he deserves our warmest gratitude.\" My son seemed all this while regardless of what I said, and still continued fixed at a respectful distance. \" My dear brother,\" cried his sister, \" Avhy don't you thank my good deliverer ? the brave should ever love each other.\" He still continued his silence and astonishment, till our guest at last perceived himself to be known, and, assuming"], [271, "VICAR OF AVAKEFIELD. 227 all his native dignity, desired my son to come forAvard. Never before had I seen anything so truly majestic as the air he assumed upon this occasion. The greatest object in the universe, says a certain philosopher, is a good man struggling with adversity ; yet there is still a greater, which is the good man that comes to relieve it. After he had regarded my son for some time with a superior air, \" I again find,\" said he, '\" unthinking boy, that the same crime \u2014 \" But here he was interrupted by one of the jailor's servants, who came to inform us that a person of distinction, who had driven into town Avith a chariot and several attendants, sent his respects to the gentleman that Avas with us, and begged to know Avhen he should think proper to be waited upon. \" Bid the fellow Avait,\" cried our guest, \" till I shall have leisure to receive him ;\" and then turning to my son, \" I again find, sir,\" pro- ceeded he, \" that you are guilty of the same offence for which you once had my reproof, and for Avhich the law is now preparing its justest punishments. You imagine, perhaps,that a contempt for your own life gives you a right to take that of another : but where, sir, is the difference betAveen a duellist, who hazards a life of no value, and the murderer who acts with greater security ?

Here, sir, is the letter, which wdl serve to convince you of her imprudence, and diminish his guilt.\" He took the letter, and hastily read it over. \" This,\" says he, \" though not a perfect excuse, is such a palliation of his fault as induces me to forgive him. And now, sir,\" continued he. kindly taking my son by the hand, \" I see you are surprised at finding me here ; but I have often visited prisons upon occasions less interesting. I am now come to see justice done a worthy man, for whom I have the most sincere esteem. I have long been a disguised spectator of thy father's benevolence. I have, at his little dwelling, enjoyed respect uncontaminated by flattery ; and have received that happiness that courts could not give, from the amusing simplicity around his fire side. My nephew has been apprised of my intention of coming here, and, I find, is arrived. It would be wronging him and you to condemn him without examination : if there be injury, there shall be redress ; and this I may say, without boasting, that none have ever taxed the injustice of Sir Widiam Thornhill.\" We now found the personage Avhom we had so long enter tained as an harmless amusing companion, was no other than the celebrated Sir William Thornhid, to Avhose virtues and singularities scarcely any were strangers. The poor Mr. Burchell was in reality a man of large fortune and great interest, to whom senates listened with applause, and whom party heard with conviction ; Avho was the friend of his country, but loyal to his king. My poor wife, recodecting her former familiarity, seemed to shrink with apprehension ; but Sophia, who a few moments before thought him her own, now perceiving the immense distance to which he was removed by fortune, was unable to conceal her tears. \" Ah ! sir,\" cried my wife, with a piteous aspect, \" how is it possible that I can ever have your forgiveness ?

We were waited upon at dinner by the jailor himself, who was willing to do our guest all the honour in his power.

I waited on her father in person, willing to clear the thing to his satisfaction, and he received me only with insult and abuse. As for the rest, with regard to his being here, my attorney and steward can best inform you, as I commit the management of business entirely to them. If he has con tracted debts, and is unwilling or even unable to pay them, it is their business to proceed in this manner; and I see no hard ship or injustice in pursuing the most legal means of redress.\" \" If this,\" cried Sir William, \" be as you have stated it, there is nothing unpardonable in your offence ; and though your conduct might have been more generous in not suffer ing this gentleman to be oppressed by subordinate tyranny, yet it has been at least equitable.\" \" He cannot contradict a single particular,\" replied the Squire\u2014\" I defy him to do so\u2014 and several of my servants are ready to attest Avhat I say.

His face became pale with conscious guilt, and he would have withwrawn; but Jenkinson, who perceived his design, stopped him. \" What, Squire,\" cried he, \" are you ashamed of your two old acquaintances, Jenkinson and Bax ter? But this is the way that all great men forget their friends, though I am resolved we will not forget you. Our prisoner, please your honour,\" continued he, turning to Sir William, \" has already confessed all. This is the gentleman reported to be so dangerously wounded. He declares that it was Mr. Thornhill Avbo first put him upon this affair \u2014 that he gave him the clothes he now wears, to appear like a gentleman, and furnished him with the post-chaise. The plan was laid between them, that he should carry off the young lady to a place of safety, and that there he should threaten and terrify her ; but Mr. Thornhill was to come in, in the meantime, as if by accident, to her rescue ; and that they should fight a while, and then he was to run oft' \u2014 by Avhich Mr. Thornhill would have the better opportunity of gaining her affections himself, under the character of her defender.\" Sir William remembered the coat to have been Avorn by his nepheAV, and all the rest the prisoner himself confirmed by a more circumstantial account; concluding that Mr. Thornhill had often declared to him that he was in love with both sisters at the same time. \" Heavens !\" cried Sir William, \" what a viper have I been fostering in my bosom ! And so fond of public justice, too, as fie seemed to be ! But he shall have it ; secure him, Mr. Jailor. Yet hold ; I fear there is not legal evidence to detain him.\" Upon this Mr. Thornhill, Avith the utmost humility, en treated that two such abandoned wretches might not be ad mitted as evidences against him, but that his servants should be examined. \" Your servants !\" replied Sir William ; \"wretch ! call them yours no longer; but come, let us hear what those felloAvs have to say: let his butler be called.\" When the butler was introduced, he soon perceiA7ed, by his former master's looks, that all his poAver Avas iioav over. \"Tell"], [280, "236 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. me,\" cried Sir William, sternly, \" have you ever seen your master, and that fellow dressed up in his clothes, in company together?\" \u2014 \"Yes, please your honour,\" cried the butler, \" a thousand times : he was the man that always brought him his ladies.\"\u2014\" How !\" interrupted young Mr. Thornhill, \" this to my face ?\" \u2014 \" Yes,\" replied the butler, \" or to any man's face. To tell you a truth, Master Thornhill, I never either loved or liked you, and I don't care if I tell you now a piece of my mind.\" \u2014 \" Now, then,\" cried Jenkinson, \" ted his honour whether you know anything of me.\" \u2014 -\" I can't say,\" replied the butler, \" that I know much good of you. The night that gentleman's daughter was deluded to our house, you were one of them.\" \u2014 \" So, then,\" cried Sir William, \" I find you have brought a very fine Avitness to prove your in nocence : thou stain to humanity ! to associate with such wretches ! But,\" continuing his examination, \" you tell me, Mr. Butler, that this was the person who brought him this old gentleman's daughter.\" \u2014 \"No, please your honour,\" replied the butler, \"he did not bring her, for the Squire him self undertook that business ; but he brought the priest that"], [281, "VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. 237 pretended to marry them.\" \u2014 \"It is but too true,\" cried Jenkinson ; \" I cannot deny it \u2014 that was the employment assigned me, and I confess it to my confusion.\" \" Good heavens !\" exclaimed the Baronet, \" how every new discovery of his villany alarms me ! All his guilt is now too plain, and I find his prosecution was dictated by tyranny, cowardice, and revenge. At my request, Mr. Jailor, set this young officer, now your prisoner, free, and trust to me for the consequences. I'll make it my business to set the affair in a proper light to my friend the magistrate, who has com mitted him. But where is the unfortunate young lady her self? Let her appear to confront this wretch: I long to know by what arts he has seduced her. Entreat her to come in. Where is she ?\" \" Ah ! sir,\" said I, \" that question stings me to the heart : I was once indeed happy in a daughter, but her miseries \" Another interruption here prevented me ; for who should make her appearance but Miss Arabella Wilmot, who was next day to have been married to Mr. Thornhill. Nothing could equal her surprise at seeing Sir William and his nephew here before her ; for her arrival was quite accidental. It happened that she and the old gentleman, her father, were passing through the town, on their way to her aunt's, who had insisted that her nuptials with Mr. Thornhill should be consummated at her house ; but stopping for refreshment, they put up at an inn at the other end of the town. It was there, from the window, that the young lady happened to observe one of my little boys playing in the street, and instantly sending a footman to bring the child to her, she learned from him some account of our misfortunes; but was stdl kept ignorant of young Mr. Thornhill's being the cause. Though her father made several remonstrances on the impropriety of going to a prison to visit us, yet they were ineffectual ; she desired the child to conduct her, which he did, and it was thus she surprised us at a juncture so unexpected. Nor can I go on Avithout a reflection on these accidental meetings, which, though they happen every day, seldom"], [282, "238 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. excite our surprise but upon some extraordinary occasion. To what a fortuitous occurrence do we not owe every pleasure and convenience of our lives! How many seeming accidents must unite before we can be clothed or fed ! The peasant must be disposed to labour, the shower must fall, the wind fid the merchant's sail, or numbers must want the usual supply. We all continued silent for some moments, while my charming pupil, which was the name I generally gave this young lady, united in her looks compassion and astonishment, Avhich gave new finishing to her beauty. \" Indeed, my dear Mr. Thornhill,\" cried she to the Squire, who she supposed Avas come here to succour, and not to oppress us, \" I take it a little unkindly that you should come here without me, or never inform me of the situation of a family so dear to us both : you know I should take as much pleasure in contri buting to the relief of my reverend old master here, whom I shall ever esteem, as you can. But I find that, like your uncle, you take a pleasure in doing good in secret.\" \" He find pleasure in going good,\" cried Sir William interrupting her : \u2014 \" No, my dear, his pleasures are as base as he is. You see in him, madam, as complete a villain as ever disgraced humanity. A Avretch, who, after having deluded this poor man's daughter, after plotting against the innocence of her sister, has thrown the father into prison, and the eldest son into fetters, because he had the courage to face her betrayer. And give me leave madam, now to congratulate you upon an escape from the embraces of such a monster.\" \" Oh goodness !\" cried the lovely girl, \" how have I been deceived ! Mr. Thornhill informed me for certain that this gentleman's eldest son, Captain Primrose, was gone off to America with his new-married lady.\" \"My sweetest miss,\" cried my wife, \"he has told you nothing but falsehoods. My son George neA7er left the kingdom, nor ever was married. Though you have forsaken him, he has ahvays loved you too well to think of anybody else ; and I have heard him say he would die a bachelor for your sake.\" She then proceeded to expatiate upon the"], [283, "VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. 239 sincerity of her son's passion; she set his duel with Mr. Thornhill in a proper light : from thence she made a rapid digression to the Squire's debaucheries, his pretended mar riages, and ended with a most insulting picture of his cowardice. \" Good heavens,\" cried Miss Wilmot, \" how very near have I been to the brink of ruin ! Ten thousand falsehoods has this gentleman told me. He had at last art enough to persuade me, that my promise to the only man I esteemed was no longer binding, since he had been unfaithful. By his falsehoods I was taught to detest one equally brave and generous.\" But by this time my son was freed from the encumbrances of justice, as the person supposed to be wounded was detected to be an impostor. Mr. Jenkinson, also, who had acted as his valet-de-chambre, had dressed up his hair, and furnished him"], [284, "240 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. with whatever Avas necessary to make a genteel appearance. He now therefore entered, handsomely dressed in his regi mentals ; and, without vanity (for I am above it), he appeared as handsome a fellow as eA7er wore a military dress. As he entered, he made Miss Wilmot a modest and distant boAV, for he was not as yet acquainted with the change which the elo quence of his mother had wrought in his favour- But no decorums could restrain the impatience of his blushing mis tress to be forgiven. Her tears, her looks, all contributed to discover the real sensations of her heart, for having forgotten her former promise, and having suffered herself to be deluded by an impostor. My son appeared amazed at her condes cension, and could scarcely believe it real. \" Sure, madam,\" cried he, \" this is but delusion ! I can never have merited this ! to be blessed thus is to be too happy.\"\u2014 \" No sir,\" replied she ; \" I have been deceived, basely deceived, else nothing could have eA7er made me unjust to my promise. You know my friendship \u2014 you have long known it \u2014 but forget what I have done, and as you once had my warmest vows of constancy, you shall now have them repeated ; and be assured that if your Arabella cannot be yours, she shall never be another's.\" \u2014 \" And no other's you shall be,\" cried Sir William, \" if I have any influence over your father.\" This hint was sufficient for my son Moses, Avho immediately flew to the inn where the old gentleman Avas, to inform him of every circumstance that had happened. But, in the mean time, the Squire, perceiving that he was on every side undone, now finding that no hopes were left from flattery or dissimu lation, concluded that his Avisest way would be to turn and face his pursuers. Thus, laying aside all shame, he appeared the open hardy villain. \" I find then,\" cried he, \" that I am to expect no justice here ; but I am resolved it shall be done me. You shall know, sir,\" turning to Sir William, \" I am no longer a poor dependent upon your favours. I scorn them. Nothing can keep Miss Wilmot's fortune from me, which, I thank her father's assiduity, is pretty large. The articles and a bond for her fortune are signed, and safe in my"], [285, "241 A7ICAR OF WAKEFIELD. possession. It was her fortune, not her person, that induced me to wish for this match ; and, possessed of the one, let who Avill take the other.\" This Avas an alarming blow. Sir William was sensible of the justice of his claims, for he had been instrumental in drawing up the marriage articles himself. Miss Wilmot, therefore, perceiving that her fortune Avas irretrievably lost, turning to my son, she asked if the loss of fortune could lessen her value to him? \" Though fortune,\" said she, \"is out of my power, at least I have my hand to give.\" \" And that, madam,\" cried her real lover, \" Avas indeed all that you ever had to give ; at least all that I ever thought worth the acceptance. And I now protest, my Arabeda, by all that's happy, your Avant of fortune this moment increases my pleasure, as it serves to convince my SAveet girl of my sincerity.\" Mr. Wilmot now entering, he seemed not a little pleased at the danger his daughter had just escaped, and readily con sented to a dissolution of the match. But finding that her fortune, which was secured to Mr. Thornhill by bond, Avould 31"], [286, "242 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. not be\" given up, nothing could exceed his disappointment. He now saw that his money must ad go to enrich one who had no fortune of his own. He could bear his being a rascal, but to want an equivalent to his daughter's fortune was wormwood. He sat, therefore, for some minutes employed in the most mortifying speculations, till Sir WiUiam attempted to lessen his anxiety, \" I must confess, sir,\" cried he, \" that your present disappointment does not entirely displease me. Your immoderate passion for wealth is now justly punished. But though the young lady cannot, be rich, she has stid a competence sufficient to give content. Here you see an honest young soldier, who is wdling to take her without fortune : they have long loved each other ; and, for the friend ship I bear his father, my interest shall not be wanting in his promotion. Leave, then, that ambition which disappoints you, and for once admit that happiness which courts your acceptance.\" \" Sir Wdliam,\" replied the old gentleman, \" be assured I never yet forced her inclination, nor will I now. If she still"], [287, "243 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. continues to love this young gentleman, let her have him, with all my heart. There is still, thank Heaven, some fortune left, and your promise will make it something more. Only let my old friend here (meaning me) give me a promise of settling six thousand pounds upon my girl if ever he should come to his fortune, and I am ready, this night, to be the first to join them together.\" As it now remained with me to make the young couple happy, I readily gave a promise of making the settlement he required ; which, to one who had such little expectations as I, was no great favour. We had now, therefore, the satis faction of seeing them fly into each other's arms in a transport. \" After all my misfortunes,\" cried my son George, \" to be thus rewarded ! Sure this is more than I could ever have presumed to hope for. To be possessed of all that's good, and after such an interval of pain ! My warmest wishes could never rise so high !\" \" Yes, my George,\" returned his lovely bride, \" now let the wretch take my fortune ; since you are happy without it, so am I. Oh, what an exchange have I made \u2014 from the basest of men to the dearest, best ! Let him enjoy our for- tune ; I now can be happy even in indigence.\" \u2014 \" And I promise you,\" cried the Squire, with a malicious grin, \" that I shall be very happy with what you despise.\" \u2014 \" Hold, hold, sir,\" cried Jenkinson, \" there are two words to that bargain. As for that lady's fortune, sir, you shad never touch a single stiver of it. \" Pray, your honour,\" continued he to Sir Wil- liam, \" can the Squire have this lady's fortune if he be married to another ?\" \u2014 \" How can you make such a simple demand ?\" replied the Baronet : \" undoubtedly he cannot.\" \u2014 \" I am sorry for that,\" cried Jenkinson ; \" for as this gentle- man and I have been old fellow-sporters, I have a friendship for him. But I must declare, well as I love him, that this contract is not worth a tobacco-stopper, for he is married already.\" \u2014 \" You lie, like a rascal,\" returned the Squire, who seemed roused by this insult ; \" I never was legally married to any woman.\""], [288, "244 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. \" Indeed, begging your honour's pardon,\" replied the other-., *' you were ; and I hope yuo will show a proper return of friendship to your OAyn honest Jenkinson, who brings you a wife; and if the company restrain their curiosity a few minutes, they shall see her.\" So saying, he went off with his usual celerity, and left us all unable to form any probable conjecture as to his design. \" Ay, let him go,\" cried the Squire; \" whatever else I may have done, I defy him there. I am too old now to be frightened Avith squibs.\" \" I am surprised,\" said the Baronet, \" what the fellow can intend by this. Some low piece of humour, I suppose.\" \u2014 \u25a0 \"Perhaps, Sir,\" replied I, \"he may have a more serious meaning. For when we reflect on the various schemes this gentleman has laid to seduce innocence, perhaps some one, more artful than the rest, has been found able to deceive him. When we consider what numbers he has ruined, how many parents noAv feel, Avith anguish, the infamy and contamination which he has brought into their families, it would not surprise me if some one of them \u25a0 Amazement ! Do I see my lost daughter ? do I hold her ? It is, it is my life, my happi ness ! I thought thee lost, my Olivia, yet still I hold thee \u2014 and still thou shalt live to bless me !\" The warmest trans ports of the fondest lover were not greater than mine, when I saw him introduce my child, and held my daughter in my arms, whose silence only spoke her raptures. \" And art thou returned to me, my darling, to be my comfort in age?\"\u2014 \"That she is,\" cried Jenkinson ; \"and make much of her, for she is your own honourable child, and as honest a woman as any in the whole room, let the other be who she will. And as for you, Squire, as sure as you stand there, this young lady is your lawful wedded wife ; and to convince you that I speak nothing but the truth, here is the licence by which you were married together.\" So saying, he put the licence into the Baronet's hands, who read it, and found it perfect in every respect. \" And now, gentlemen,\" continued he, \" I find you surprised at all this ; but a few words will explain the difficulty. That there Squire of"], [289, "VICAR OF AVAKEFIELD. 245 renown, for whom I have a great friendship (but that's between ourselves), has often employed me'in doing odd little things for him. Among the rest, he commissioned me to procure him a false licence and a false priest, in order to de ceive this young lady. But as I was very much his friend, what did I do, but went and got a true licence and a true priest, and married them both as fast as the cloth could make them. Perhaps you'll think it was generosity that made me do all this \u2014 but no \u2014 to my shame I confess it, my only de sign was to keep the licence, and let the Squire know that I could prove it upon him whenever I thought proper, and so make him come doAvn whenever I wanted money.\" A burst of pleasure now seemed to fill the Avhole apartment. Our joy reached even to the common room, where the prisoners them selves sympathised, And shook their chains In transport and rude harmony. Happiness was expanded upon every face, and even Olivia's cheek seemed flushed Avith pleasure. To be thus restored to reputation, to friends, and fortune at once, was a rapture sufficient to stop the progress of decay, and restore former health and vivacity. But, perhaps, among all, there was not one who felt sincerer pleasure than I. Still holding the dear loved child in my arms, I asked my heart, if these transports were not a delusion. \" How could you,\" cried I, turning to Mr. Jenkinson, \" how could you add to my miseries by the story of her death ? But it matters not ; my pleasure in finding her again is more than a recompense for the pain.\" \" As to your question,\" replied Jenkinson, \" that is easily answered. I thought the only probable means of freeing you from prison, was by submitting to the Squire, and consenting to his marriage with the other young lady. But these you had vowed never to grant while your daughter was living ; there was, therefore, no other method to bring things to bear, but by persuading you that she was dead. I prevailed on your wife to join in the deceit, and we have not had a fit opportunity of undeceiving you till now.\""], [290, "246 VICAR OF AVAKEFIELD. In the Avhole assembly there now appeared only two faces that did not glow with transport. Mr. Thornhill's assurance had entirely forsaken him: he now saw the gulf of infamy and want before him, and trembled to take the plunge. He therefore fed on his knees before his uncle, and, in a voice or piercing misery, implored compassion. Sir William was going to spurn him away, but at my request he raised him, and, after pausing a few moments. \" Thy vices, crimes, and in gratitude,\" cried he, \" deserve no tenderness ; yet thou shalt not be entirely forsaken \u2014 a bare competence shall be supplied to support the wants of life, but not its follies. This young lady, thy wife, shall be put in possession of a third of the for tune which once was thine, and from her tenderness alone thou art to expect any extraordinary supplies for the future.\" He was going to express his gratitude for such kindness in a set speech ; but the Baronet prevented him, by bidding him not aggravate his meanness, which was already but too"], [291, "247 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. apparent. He ordered him at the same time to be gone, and from his former domestics to choose one, such as he should think proper, which was ad that could be granted to attend him. As soon as he left us, Sir William very politely stepped up to his new niece with a smde and wished her joy. His ex ample was followed by Miss Wilmot and her father. My wife, too, kissed her daughter with much affection ; as, to use her own expression, she was now made an honest woman of. Sophia and Moses followed in turn ; and even her benefactor Jenkinson desired to be admitted to that honour. Our satis faction seemed incapable of increase. Sir William, whose greatest pleasure was in doing good, now looked round with a countenance open as the sun, and saw nothing but joy in the looks of all except that of my daughter Sophia, who, for some reasons we could not comprehend, did not seem per fectly satisfied, \" I think now,\" cried he, with a smile, \" that all the company except one or two seem perfectly happy. There only remains an act of justice for me to do. You are sensible, sir,\" continued he, turning to me, \" of the obliga tions we both owe to Mr. Jenkinson; and it is but just Ave should both reward him for it. Miss Sophia wid, I am sure, make him very happy, and he shall have from me five hundred pounds as her fortune ; and upon this I am sure they can live very comfortably together. Come, Miss Sophia, what say you to this match of my making ? Will you have him ?\" My poor girl seemed almost sinking into her mother's arms at the hideous proposal. \" Have him, sir?\" cried she, faintly : \" No sir, never !\" \u2014 \"What !\" cried he again, \" not have Mr. Jenkinson, your benefactor, a handsome young fellow, with five hundred pounds, and good expectations ?\" \u2014 \" I beg, Sir,\" returned she, scarcely ab le to speak, \" that you'll desist, and not make me so very wretched.\" \u2014 \" Was ever such obstinacy known ? \" cried he again, \" to refuse a man whom the family has such infinite obligations to, who has preserved your sister, and who has five hundred pounds ! What ! not have him ?\" \u2014 \" No, sir, never,\" replied she, angrily ; \" I'd sooner die first.\""], [292, "248 VICAR OF AVAKEFIELD. \u2014 \" If that be the case, then,\" cried he, \" if you will not have him, I think I must have you myself.\" And so saying, he caught her to his breast with ardour : \" My loveliest, my most sensible of girls,\" cried he, \" how could you ever think your OAvn Burchell could deceive you, or that Sir Wdliam Thornhill could ever cease to admire a mistress that loved him for himself alone ? I have for some years sought for a woman, who, a stranger to my fortune, could think that I had merit as a man. After having tried in vain, even amongst the pert and ugly, how great at last must be my rapture to have made a conquest over such sense and such heavenly beauty !\" Then turning to Jenkinson : \" As I cannot, sir, part AA-ith this young lady myself, for she has taken a fancy to the cut of my face, all the recompense I can make is to give you her for tune ; and you may call upon my steAvard to-morrow for :five hundred pounds.\" Thus we had all our compliments to repeat, and Lady Thornhill underwent the same round of ceremony that her sister had done before. In the mean time, Sir William's gentleman appeared to tell us that the equip ages were ready to carry us to the inn, where everything was prepared for our reception. My wife and I led the van, and left those gloomy mansions of sorrow. The generous Baronet ordered forty pounds to be distributed among the prisoners, and Mr. Wrilmot, induced by his example, gave half that sum. We were received below by the shouts of the villagers, and I saw and shook by the hand tAvo or three of my honest parish ioners, who were among the number. They attended us to our inn, where a sumptuous entertainment was provided, and coarser provisions were distributed in great quantities among the populace. After supper, as my spirits were exhausted by the alterna tion of pleasure and pain Avhich they had sustained during the day, I asked permission to withdraw ; and leaving the company in the midst of their mirth, as soon as I found myself alone, I poured out my heart in gratitude to the Giver of joy as well as of sorrow, and then slept undisturbed till morning."], [293, "THE VICAR AND FAMILY LEAVING THE PRISON"], [294, ""], [295, "CHAPTER XXXII. THE CONCLUSION ijt he next morning, as soon as I aAvaked, I found my eldest son sitting by my g? bed-side, who came to increase my joy with another turn of fortune in my favour. First having released me from the settlement that I had made the day before in his favour, he let me know that my merchant, who had failed in town, was arrested at Antwerp, and there had given up effects to a much greater amount than Avas due to his creditors. My boy's generosity pleased me almost as much as this unlooked-for good fortune ; but I had some doubts whether I ought, in justice, to accept his offer. Whde I was pondering upon this, Sir Wdliam entered the room, to whom I communicated my doubts. His opinion Avas, that as my son was already possessed of a very affluent fortune by his marriage, I might accept his offer without any hesitation. His business, however, was to inform me, that as he had the night before sent for the licenses, and expected them every 35"], [296, "VICAR OF WAKEFIELD 252 hour, he hoped that I would not refuse my assistance in making all the company happy that morning. A footman entered whde we were speaking, to ted us that the messenger was returned , and as I was by this time ready, I went down* where I found the whole company as merry as affluence and innocence could make them. However, as they were now preparing for a very solemn ceremony, their laughter entirely displeased me. I told them of the grave, becoming, and sublime deportment they should assume upon this mystical occasion, and read them two homilies, and a thesis of my own composing, in order to prepare them. Yet they stdl seemed perfectly refractory and ungovernable. Even as we were going along to church, to which I led the way, all gravity had quite forsaken them, and I was often tempted to turn back in indignation. In church, a neAv dilemma arose, which promised no easy solution. This was, Avhich couple should be married first ? My son's bride warmly insisted that Lady Thornhill (that Avas to be) should take the lead ; but this the other refused with equal ardour, protesting she would not be guilty of such rudeness for the world. The argument w7as"], [297, "COINC TO CHURCH.-THE WEDDKVCS"], [298, ""], [299, "VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. 255 supported for some time between both, with equal obstinacy and good breeding. But, as I stood all this time with my book ready, I Avas at last quite tired of the contest ; and, shutting it, \" I perceive,\" cried I, \" that none of you have a mind to be married, and I think we had as good go back again ; for I suppose there will be no business done here to day.\" This at once reduced them to reason. The Baronet and his lady were first married, and then my son and his lovely partner. I had previously, that morning, given orders that a coach should be sent for my honest neighbour Flamborough and his family: by which means, upon our return to the inn, we had the pleasure of finding the two Miss Flamboroughs alighted before us. Mr. Jenkinson gave his hand to the eldest, and my son Moses led up the other (and I have since found, that he has taken a real liking to the girl, and my consent and bounty he shall have, Avhenever he thinks proper to demand them). We were no sooner returned to the inn, but numbers of my parishioners, hearing of my success, came to congratu late me ; but, among the rest, were those who rose to rescue me, and whom I formerly rebuked with such sharpness. I told the story to Sir Widiam, my son-in-law, who went out and reproved them with great severity ; but finding them quite disheartened by his harsh reproof, he gave them half-a-guinea a-piece to drink his health, and raise their dejected spirits. Soon after this, Ave were called to a very genteel enter tainment, which was dressed by Mr. Thornhill's cook. And it may not be improper to observe, with respect to that gentle man, that he now resides in quality of companion, at a relation's house, being very well liked, and seldom sitting at the side-table, except when there is no room at the other ; for they make no stranger of him. His time is pretty much taken up in keeping his relation, who is a little melancholy, in spirits, and in learning the French horn. My eldest daughter however, stid remembers him with regret ; and she has even told me, though I make a great secret of it, that when he reforms, she may be brought to relent. But to return ; for I"], [300, "256 VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. am not apt to digress thus When we were to sit down to dinner, our ceremonies were going to be renewed. The ques tion was, whether my eldest daughter, as being a matron, should not sit above the two young brides ; but the debate was cut short by my son George, who proposed that the company should sit indiscriminately, every gentleman by his lady. This was received with great approbation by all, excepting my wife, who, I could perceive, was not perfectly satisfied, as she expected to have had the pleasure of sitting at the head of the table, and carving the meat for ad the com pany. But, notwithstanding this, it is impossible to describe our good humour. I cannot say whether we had more wit among us now than usual ; but I am certain we had more laughing, which answered the end as wed. One jest I particu larly remember. Old Mr. Wilmot drinking to Moses, whose head was turned another way, my son replied, \" Madam, I thank you.\" Upon which the old gentleman, winking upon the rest of the company, observed, that he was thinking of his mistress. At which jest I thought the two Miss Flamboroughs would have died with laughing. As soon as dinner was over, according to my old custom, I requested that the table might be taken away, to have the pleasure of seeing all my famdy assembled once more by a cheerful fire-side. My two little ones sat upon each knee, the rest of the company by their partners. I^had nothing now on this side of the grave to wish for ; all my cares were over \u2014 my pleasure was unspeak able. It now only remained, that my gratitude in good for tune should exceed my former submission in adversity. WILLOUGHBY AND CO., PEISTEKS. 97, ST.
