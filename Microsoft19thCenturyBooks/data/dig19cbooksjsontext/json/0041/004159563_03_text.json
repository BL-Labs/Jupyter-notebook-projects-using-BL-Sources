RICHARD of Cirencester says that this county took its name from the Carnabii; it is more probable on the contrary, that those people took their name from that of the country they inhabited : the truth seems to be that the country was called by its antient inhabitants, Kernou, or as the Welch write it, Kerniw, or the Horn, from, its projecting promontories; that it was latinized to Carnubia or Cornubia; that when the Saxons gave the name of Wealas to the Britons, they distinguished those who had retired into Kernou or Cornubia, by the name of Corn-wealas ; and their country was thus called Cornuwall or Cornwall: that is, Cornish- Wales. * Antient Inhabitants, Language, and Government. From the map of Roman Britain, it appears that the northern part of this county, as far as the river Camel and Padstow haven, was antiently inhabited by a British tribe called the Cimbri ; the eastern part, as far as Falmouth haven, by the Danmonii, and the remainder by the Carnabii. Before the coming of the Romans, the Danmonii had subdued the two other tribes and usurped their do minions b. When the Romans divided Britain into fix provinces, Cornwall formed part of Britannia Prima; after their departure it became one of the last retreats of the Britons, who seem to have been sometimes under the dominion of the kings of Wales, and sometimes to have been governed by independent sovereigns a See Dr. Borlase's Antiquities, p. 325s, and Whitaker's Cathedral of Cornwall, I. 14, ij. b See Whitaker's History of Manchester, I. 94. of a 2"], [22, "CORNWALL. IV of their own, either by the names of dukes or kings % till their country was con quered by King Athelstan, and annexed to the crown of England. By its royal privileges, and the retention of its antient language, Cornwall still continued nevertheless to retain some semblance of a distinct sovereignty. The language, which was a dialect of the antient British, was generally spoken till the reign of Henry VIII., when the introduction of the English liturgy paved the way towards its gradual disuse. It is said to have been at the desire of the Cornish, that the English service was enjoined in preference to that of their native tongue ; whilst in Wales, a contrary system, which has proved the preservation of their language, was adopted d. Dr. Moreman, the learned vicar of Menheniot, is said to have been the first in those days (speaking of the kingdom at large), who \" taught his parishioners and peo ple to fay the Lord's prayer, the belief, and the commandments, in the English tongue, and did teach and catechize them therein e.\" Mr. Carew, in his survey of Cornwall, published in the year 1602, speaks of the language as then growing fast into disuse. \" The principal love and knowledge of this language,\" fays ha, \" lived in Dr. Kennall the civilian, and with him lyeth buried, for the English speech doth still encroach upon it, and hath driven the same into the uttermost skirts of the shire. Most of the inhabitants can speak no word of Cornish, but very few are ignorant of the English, and yet some so affect their own, as to a stranger they will not speak it ; for if meeting them by chance you enquire the way, or any such matter, your answer shall be, ' Mee a navidra cowza Sawzneck,' I can speak no Saxonage.\" Hals tells us that in the reign of Charles the First, some of the aged people in the neighbourhood of Penryn were quite ignorant of the English language, and that the Rev. Mr.Jackman, vicar of St. Feock, was obliged to administer the sacra ment to them in the Cornish. Ray found only one person who could write the language in 1663, but we are told by Mr. Scawen, that not long before the year 1678, a sermon was preached in it by the Rev. Mr. Robinson, rector of Lande wednack. In the early part of the last century, as Dr. Borlase informs us, it was still generally spoken by the fishermen and market-women in the extreme southern part of the peninsula ; in his Natural History, published in 17,8, he speaks of the language as having altogether ceased, so as not to be spoken anywhere in conver sation. Some aged people however retained it rather later ; Mr. Daines Barrington gives an account of an old fish-woman of Mousehole, the only person he could find or hear of, who spoke the Cornish language, when he made the tour of c Polwhele's Cornwall, Vol. II. p. n. in the notes. language, by W. Scawen Esq. d Treatise on the Cornish ' See Hooker's Synopsis of Devon. Cornwall"], [23, "CORNWALL V Cornwall in 1768, as related in a communication to the Society of Antiquaries. In 1776, in a further communication on the fame subject to the society, it is stated on the authority of a fisherman of Mousehole, that there were then four or five persons besides himself who could converse in Cornish. Dr. Pryce of Redruth, in his preface to his Arch\u00e6ologia Cornu-Britannica, published in 1790, speaks of a very old man then living at Mousehole, as the only person, to the best of his knowledge, who was capable of holding half an hour's conversation on common subjects in the Cornish tongue. He afterwards fays, that there were a few other ancient persons who pretended to jabber it, but that they were very illiterate, and their speech very much corrupted, although their pronun ciation was generally correct. Mr. Whitaker, in his tour to the Lands-End, in 1799, heard of two persons who even then spoke it, but he had not an opportu nity of ascertaining the fact. We find, upon inquiry, that there is no person now who can converse in the language, though some old people are acquaint ed with many words of it, which they have learned from those of the last generation. A few MSS. are extant in the Cornish language, the most remarkable of which are some interludes f, partly written in the fifteenth century, and a poem called Mount Calvary, all of which were translated by Mr. J. Keigwin. Mr. Edward Lloyd, who made a journey into Cornwall to collect materials for that purpose, in 1700, published a Cornish grammar, in 1707. Dr. Borlase gives some Cornish proverbs in his Natural History ; and at the end of his Antiquities of Cornwall has printed a Cornish Vocabulary. Dr. Pryce of Redruth, in 1790, published Arch\u00e6ologia Cornu-Britannica, or an attempt to preserve the ancient Cornish language, comprising a Cornish grammar, a copious vocabulary, lists of Cornish names of places with their etymology, the Lord's prayer, creed, and command ments in Cornish, colloquies, a Cornish s<^\\ &c. &c. It seems most probable, that the Dukes anclEarls of Cornwall continued to possess that shadow of sovereignty which they were allowed to retain immediately after the conquest of the county by Athelstan. Carew speaks of it as an entire state by the name of a kingdom, principality, duchy or earldom. We are told that the Earls of Cornwall were always privileged with \" royal jurssdiction and crown rights, giving of liberty to fend burgesses to parliament, and appointing a sheriff, admiral, and other officers f\" before the creation of the duchy, which -took place in the year 1337, when 1 There are two MSS. of these interludes in the Bodleian library; one on parchment, written in the fifteenth century, the other on paper, written by W. Jordan, in 161 1. 8 Carew, so. 79. \u2014 With respect to the appointment of sheriff, it appears that when the men of Cornwall gave King John the large sura of 2,000 marks, besides 200 marks in lieu of ten palfreys, to"], [24, "CORNWALL VI when Edward the Black Prince was created Duke of Cornwall, and the duchy settled by act of parliament on the eldest son of the King of England. Large revenues were annexed to the duchy h, and the immediate government of the county vested to have their county disforested, to be exempt from the forest laws, and other privileges ; one of these privileges was, that they should have a sheriff from among their own countrymen ; that they should present certain of the best men of the county to the King, who should nominate one of them ; that if he should misbehave, he would be removed by the King\u201eand another appointed in his room, but that it should be one of their own countrymen, if one should be found fit for the office, other wise the King should appoint a sheriff from another county, but one who was not ill-affected to wards the men of Cornwall, and would be likely to use them well. Madox's History of the Ex chequer, p. 279. The sheriff was to be resident. It appears that the 290 marks was a peace offering to appease the King's displeasure conceived against the men of Cornwall. See p. 283. * The original revenues of the duchy of Cornwall, as granted by the charter of Edward III., consisted of the castle, borough, manor and honor of Launceston, with the park, Sec. the castle, manor, and park of Trematon, with the town of Saltash ; the castle, borough, and manor of Tintagel ; the castle, manor, and park of Restormel ; the manor of Climesland, with the park ef Keribullock ; Tybesta, with the bailiwick of Powdershire ; Tewington, with its appurtenances ; Helston in Kerrier, with its appurtenances ; Moresk, with its appurtenances ; Tywarnail, with its appurtenances ; Penkneth, with its appurtenances ; Penlyn, with the park, &c. ; Rillaton, with the beadleship of East Wyvelshire ; Helston inTrigshire, with the park of Hellesbury, &c. ; Lis keard, with the park, &c. ; Calstock, with the fishery, &c. ; Talskedy, with the appurtenances ; the town of Lostwithiel, with the mills, &c. ; the profit of ports, with wrecks, &c. ; profits of the hundreds and courts ; the coinage of tin, and all the Stannary profits, besides certain manors and boroughs in Devonshire. The whole revenue of the duchy, as computed on an average of three years, after the death of the Black Prince, the latter end of his father's reign, amounted to 2,4931. 7s. 3 Jd. per annum. Of this, 2,2191. 7s. 9^d. arose from the Cornish estates, including 1, 01 61. is. 4d. per annum, which was then the profit of the Stannaries. (See the particulars printed from the original at the Tower, at the end of Lord De Dunstanville's edition of Carew's Survey. ) Of the above-mentioned antient manors, Tybesta, Helston in Kerrier, Moresk, Tewington, Ty- warnail and Calstock, have been sold within the last fourteen years under the powers of the land tax redemption act. In the reign of Henry VIII. the honour of Wallingford was annexed to the duchy, but the King wishing to resume it, settled on the duchy in lieu thereof, the manors of Welt Anthony, Crofthole, Landreyne, Portloo, and Port-Pigham ; Northill, Trelowia, Tregameere, Trelugan, Treverbyn-ourtney, Landulph, Leigh-Durant and Tinten, which had been forfeited by the Marquis of Exeter ; the manors of Austell, Fentrigan, Trevenen, Gridiow, Porthea-Prior, and the manor and borough of Fowey with the fishery there, all which had belonged to the priory of Ty, wardreth ; and the manors of Carnedon-Prior, Climfland-Prior, Treworgye, Stratton Sanctuary, Eastway, Boyton, Bucklawren and Bonyalva, and the barton of Bradridge, with the advowsons of Treneglos, Warbstow, Stratton and Davidstow, all of which had belonged to the priory of Laun ceston. The manors of West-Anthony, Crofthole, Landreyne, Austell and Fowey, have been fold under the powers of the act of the redemption of the land-tax. The clear revenues of the duchy, in the fifteenth year of King Henry VIII., amounted to 10,0951. us. 9^d., of which the issues of manors and boroughs amounted to 624I. 17s. 2|d., the profits of the coinage of tin in Cornwall and Devon, to 2,7711. 3s. 9^. ; other profits connected with Cornwall, 204I. os. 5d. It appears, that in the 44th year of Queen Elizabeth (1602.), the 12 revenues"], [25, "CORNWALL.

(Sir John Dodridge's ancient and modern Account of the Duchy of Cornwall, &c.) The present gross amount of the revenues of the duchy of Cornwall, is 22,000!.; of which, 8,5001. arises from the tin-duty in the county of Cornwall, and 3,5001. from rents of manors, fines, &c. in the fame county. The tin-duty, before the war, had been nearly 14,000!. per annum. The tenants of the duchy manors are either free tenants, or conventionary or customary tenants (liberi conveneionarii) ; the former hold their lands as freehold of inheritance, subject only to a chief, or as it is called in Cornwall, a high rent to the lord. The conventionary tenants hold from seven years to seven years, under a small reserved rent, and suit and service to the courts, and payment of a heriot. The custom of the manor as to descent is, that the widow has an estate for life, and in cafe of no male heir, the eldest daughter inherits. In former times there were also bond conventionary tenants ( natiiii conveneionarii) , the other being called free conventionary tenants ; these bond tenants' estates were subject, on the death of the holders, to the payment of all their chattels to the lord : there were tenants also termed bond in blood snativi destipitej, who held upon like terms, but could not put their sons to school, or marry their daughters, without the lord's conf?nt, and the youngest son inherited the estate.

This he states on the authority of Mr. Wm. Carnsew (vice-warden), who had seen the charter ; by which it is said, that the tax of a halfpenny to the Earl for every pound of tin was first fixed, and the coinage of it appointed. Mr. Tonkin, on the authority of a book which he quotes, called \u00ab The Bailiff of Blackmore,\" fays that this charter was obtained of King Edward I. in 1305 ; that it was kept in the tower of Luxulian church, whence, for greater security during the civil war, it was removed to Lostwithiel, and there destroyed with other Stannary records, by the Earl of Essex's army, in 1644. (See Lord de Dun ftanville's edition of Carew's Survey.) 1 Issues"], [27, "CORNWALL. IX Issues are frequently directed by the Vice- Warden to be tried in the Stannary courts which are held at the end of every three weeks (except in the Stannary of Foy More in which there is scarcely any business for the court), before the steward of each Stannary, and a jury for trying all civil actions arising within the Stannaries in which either the plaintiff or defendant is a privileged tinner. Appeals may be made from this court to the Vice- Warden, and from him as in the other cafes. ' King Henry VII., when he confirmed their ancient privileges, granted, that no new laws affecting the miners should be enacted by the Duke and his council with out the consent of twenty-four persons called Stannators, chosen six out of each of the four Stannaries or mining districts m. The meeting of these Stannators, who \u00abre some of the principal gentlemen of property in the mining districts, is called a Stannary parliament, and, on their assembling, they choose a speaker. These par liaments have been convened occasionally by the Lord Warden, as the circum stances of the times have called for new laws, or a revision of the old. The last Stannary parliament was held at Truro in 1752, and continued, by adjournments, to the 1 ith September 1753. The Stannary laws of Cornwall were published in an octavo volume in the reign of Queen Anne, and again in folio with the laws and customs of the Stannaries of Devon, by Thomas Pearce, in 1725 and 1750. The Stannary prison is at Lost withiel : at the fame town were kept the ancient records of the Stannaries which were burnt in the civil war. The assizes for the county were invariably held at Launceston from an early period, till the time of Richard, King of the Romans, who, having built a palace at Lostwithiel, transferred the assizes thither ; but on a petition from the men of Launceston, he consented, on the payment of a fine, that they should be held as had been accustomed ; and it so continued (except during the ravages of the plague, when the assizes were held at Saltafh), till the reign of George I. In the year 1715, an act of parliament was passed, by which it was enacted, that after the 20th of May 1 7 1 6, the assizes should not be confined to the town of Launceston. In consequence of this act, they were held alternately at Launceston and Bodmin, till the year 1727, after which they were held solely at Launceston as before, till the summer assizes in the year 1738, when the alternate arrangement, which has ever since continued, was again adopted n ; the spring assizes being held at Launceston, the summer at Bodmin. .

About the year 1580, as we find from Carew's survey, this arrange ment was altered, and the whole sessions held at each place alternately ; but this having been found liable to inconveniences, before the publication of his work (1602), it had been arranged, that the sessions ssiould, \" interchangeably, one quar ter begin at Bodmin and end at Truro, and the next begin at Truro and end at Bodmin.\" The Michaelmas sessions are now held wholly at Bodmin, the Easter sessions at Truro, and the Epiphany and Mid-summer sessions at Lostwithiel. This arrangement has subsisted many years. The county-gaol was formerly at Launceston, being the old prison within the, precincts of the castle. It is described by Dr. Borlase n as a narrow wretched place for human creatures to be confined in, all supposed innocent till convicted ; but here, he says, the \" innocent and the guilty must be contented to remain till their fate is determined, or a better one is built.\" This has since been happily accomplissi ed, a commodious and well-arranged county gaol, upon Mr. Howard's system, from a plan of the late Sir John Call, having been erected at Bodmin, under the powers of an act passed in 1778. It was completed in 1780. Historical Events. The early part of the history of this county is enveloped in obscurity, and mingled with monkissi fable ; few local events have been handed down to us, and even those are to be received with caution. Till the time of the renowned ArthuB, indeed, we have little more than a catalogue of the real or imaginary names of a long succession of princes. Even the story of Arthur is so interspersed with fiction, that some writers have gone so far as to doubt his existence ; and Giraldus Cam brensis, though himself of the monkissi school, and sufficiently credulous, has taxed the historian of Arthur with falsifying the page of history0. However his story may have been disguised by fable, and whatever doubts [there may be re specting the place of his birth, the circumstances attending it, as related by Gessery, being so palpably fictitious v, yet the existence of such a monarch is confirmed by n In his MS. addition to Carew's Survey, in the possession of Sir John St. Aubyn, Bart. \u2022 See Leland's Collectanea, II. p. 78. p The fabulous circumstances relating to Arthur's birth, taken principally from Gessery of Mon mouth by Hals, may be seen at large in Polwhele's History of Cornwall, II. p. 4. An ancient French chronicle, translated by Leland, simply says, that Tintagel and Divilioc castles, in this county, were kept by Gorlois Earl of Cornwall against Uter Pendragon ; that Tintagel was delivered up to him, and that he married Igerne, the Earl of Cornwall's wife. Arthur was the son of Uter and lgerne ; but all his historians agree that he was begotten in adultery. 12 other"], [29, "CORNWALL. XI other ancient writers ; and the learned Leland, who was so deeply versed in British chronicles, has given us as the result of what he had gathered from them on this subject, a life of this celebrated hero, in which he has taken much pains to sepa rate truth from fiction. ' The only part of Arthur's history connected with this county, excepting what relates to his birth, is the battle in which he received his death's wound. This battle is generally supposed to have happened near Camelford, on the banks of the river Cambula or Camblan, as historians relate'. Sylvester Giraldus calls it \" bellum de Kemelen\\\" Leland, in confirmation of the general tradition of the county, that this bloody contest, which proved fatal both to Arthur and his rebel lious nephew Modred, happened in the neighbourhood of Camelford, tells us, that on what was supposed to have been the field of battle, various antiquities, such as rings, fragments of armour, ornaments of bridles, and of other trappings, had been found. This spot is about a mile and a half from Camelford, near Worthyvale, in the parissi of Minster. Although there was frequent warfare between the Cornissi Britons and the Saxons, there are few local incidents during these conflicts of which we have any notice in history. In the reign of Ivor, King of Wales, which commenced in 680, the Cornissi Britons, with the assistance of that monarch, defeated the Saxons in three engage ments ; one of which happened at Heyle, in Cornwall '. Ina, King of the West Saxons, is said to have got much renown by his wars with the Cornissi, and, par ticularly, to have defeated their King, Gerentius or Gerein, in 710.\" Ethelard, his successor, is said to have defeated the Britons at Heilyn, in Cornwall, in the year 728.\u2122 Another victory was obtained over the Cornissi Britons by Cuthred king of the West Saxons, and Ethelbald king of Mercia, in 743.\" The Britons, at length finding themselves unable to cope with the Saxons, called in the Danes to their assistance. The Danissi fleet arrived on the coast of Cornwall in 806 r, but even with this succour they were not able to withstand the power of the victo rious Egbert, who, in 813, over-ran their country from east to west2. In 823, a great battle was fought at Camelford \", between the Cornissi Britons and the * Collectanea, Appendix, Part I. ' See Lei. Collect. II. p. 38 ; and Gals. Monmouth. inter Rer. Brit. Scrip.

Twelve years afterwards, another severe battle was sought at Hengston Hill, in the parish of Stoke-Climsland, in which the Britons and their allies, the Danes, were put to flight by Egbert. c The next remarkable event, and one of the most important in the history of Cornwall, is the conquest of that province by Athelstan. Till this time, the Britons occupied great part of the west of Devonshire) and inhabited Exeter, which was not then fortified, in common with the Saxons. Athelstan, having defeated Howell, King of Cornwall, near Exeter, not only drove the Britons out of that city, but obliged them to retire to the west of the Tamer. This happened, according to Florence of Worcester, in 926; nine years afterwards, the Cornish having shown symptoms of revolt, Athelstan entered their country, traversed its whole extent without opposition to the Lands-End, where he embarked his army, and, having succeeded in his intention of reducing the Scilly Isles, is supposed to have completed the conquest of Cornwall. d In 981, some Danissi pirates plundered the monastery of St. Petroc, in Cornwall. e In 997, the Danes ravaged the territories of their old allies the Cornissi with fire and sword f. In 1068, the county was plundered by Goodwin and Edmund, sons of Harold, on their return to Ireland, after they had gained a victory over King William's general in Somersetssiire. g From its remote situation, the county of Cornwall appears to have had very little ssiare in the military transactions of the three following centuries. In the reign of Stephen, we are told that the Cornissi people declared openly for the Empress Maud, and, although the war did not extend into their country, they fought bravely for her under their Earl, who was her brother \\ Mr. Polwhele observes, that \" the story of Henry de la Pomeray, in rebellion against Richard I., stands alone (during a certain period) as a detailed account of warlike enterprize in Corn wall \\\" During the captivity of that monarch in Germany, Henry de la Pomeray or Pomeroy, who had large possessions in Cornwall, seized on St. Michael's Mount \u2022> The battle is mentioned by Henry Huntingdon, (Scrip, post Bedam, 197, b.), and in the Saxon Chronicle. c Sax.

' In the year 1471, Queen Margaret having landed at Weymouth, the whole powers of Cornwall and Devonssiire, having been raised in her behalf, as it appears, through the influence of Sir Hugh Courtenay of Boconnoc, and Sir John Arundell of Lanherne, joined her at Exeter, and accompanied her to the fatal field of Tewkefbury m. The fame year, in the month of September, John Vere Earl of Oxford, having by subtlety got possession of St.Michael's Mount, establissied him self in that fortress with a garrison of nearly 400 men, and held it till the 3d of February, when he surrendered to Sir Thomas Fortefcue, on condition of his life being spared, which the King granted, but sent him prisoner to the castle of Hannes or Hammes, where he remained several years.\" In the year 1497, being the 12th of Henry VII., in consequence of discontents occasioned by the levy of a tax for the Scottissi war, the commons of Cornwall, instigated by Thomas Flammock or Flamank, the head of a respectable family in the county, and, as Holinssied calls him, learned in the laws of the realm, and Michael Joseph, a smith of Bodmin, rose in rebellion. Having prevailed on Lord Audley to be their general, they marched without interruption through Somer setssiire, Wiltssiire, Hampssiire, and Surrey, till they came to Blackheath in Kent, where they were defeated by Lord Daubeny, and their ringleaders taken prisoners and executed \u00b0.

His wife, the Lady Catherine Gordon, daughter of the Earl of Huntley, and a relation of the King of Scots, having been left at St. Michael's Mount as a place of security, after her husband's flight, was, by the King's command, taken from thence by a party of horse, and brought to court. r In the year 1548, another rebellion arose in Cornwall, of which Hugh Arundell, governor of Mount St. Michael, seems to have been the principal leader s. Their pretence was, the want of a reformation in religious matters. They proceeded to besiege Exeter as Perkin Warbeck had done, but though that city was sorely distressed for want of provisions, it held out till relieved ; the rebels were soon afterwards defeated, and Arundell, with some other of their captains, taken prisoners and executed '. During this rebellion the town of Marazion was burnt, as ap pears by the charter of Queen Elizabeth, Tonkin and Hals speak of its having experienced a similar calamity in 1513 or 1514, when a party of soldiers landed from a French fleet then cruising in the channel, and took possession of the town, but retreated to their ssiips on the approach of the ssieriff with the posse comitatus. On the 23d of July 1595, a small party of Spaniards landed near Mousehole, and burnt that town, Newlyn and Penzance. Previously to the commencement of the civil war in the seventeenth century, a petition for redress of grievances was presented to the House of Commons from the county of Cornwall ; a part of the prayer of this petition was, that the castles of Pendennis and St. Mawes, both much decayed in their fortifications, &c. ssiould be repaired and put into trusty hands, and that the havens of Fowey and Helford, being very good harbours, were fit to be fortified and put also into trusty hands. In the early part of the war, Sir Alexander Carew of Anthony, and Sir Richard Buller of Morval, active committee men, and the latter one of the members for the county, possessed themselves of the eastern part of Cornwall, placed garrisons in Launceston and Saltassi, and the parliament thought themselves secure of the whole county excepting Pendennis castle, whose governor, Sir Nicholas Slanning, was a zealous royalist. Such was the situation of affairs when the Marquis of Hertford, the King's general in the west, having embarked with his foot at Minehead to join his Royal Master in Wales, Sir Ralph Hopton and Sir John Berkeley, with a party of about 150 horse, which had been attached to the Marquis's army, retired into Cornwall : they were immediately joined by Sir Bevill Grenville, who accompanied them to Truro.

With this force thus suddenly assembled, Sir Ralph Hopton marched to Launceston, then in the occupation of Sir Richard Buller, who quitted it at his approach and it was taken possession of without resistance. Saltassi was the next object of attack, and surrendered also without opposition. The King's party being now in the entire possession of Cornwall, dismissed the trained bands, and some of his most active friends began to raise volunteer regiments, in which, from the general loyalty of the county, they met with great success. About the fame time w, Lord Mohun, who had a large estate in Cornwall, and had not as yet attached himself to either party, having declared for the King, was joined in com mission with Sir Ralph Hopton, Sir John Berkeley, and Colonel Assiburnham, to command the Cornissi forces. The parliament in the mean-time, hearing that the King's army was in complete possession of Cornwall, and occasionally made incursions into Devonssiire, sent the whole of their force out of Dorsetssiire and Somersetssiire to join with those of Devon- ssiire in recovering what they had lost in that quarter. These forces with all expedition entered the county under the command of General Ruthen, governor of Plymouth, at a bridge six miles above Saltassi, and advanced to Liskeard. Mean-time, the King's army, much inferior in numbers, had retired to Bodmin, whence, having been joined by the trained bands who had been again summoned on foreseeing the approaching storm, they advanced towards Liskeard, and Sir Ralph Hopton being chosen general for the day, Ruthen's army, which had been drawn up upon Broad- oak or Bradock down, was there defeated.

The parliamentary forces having thus failed in their attempt to subdue Cornwall, and the war being now actively prosecuted in Devonssiire, a proposal was made by .some of the Cornissi gentlemen attached to the parliament, that a treaty might be entered into, whereby the peace of the counties of Cornwall and Devon might be settled, and the war removed into other parts. This treaty took effect, and was ratified by the most solemn oaths ; but, like the Chessiire articles of neutrality,, proved insufficient to its object, for it was declared null and void by the parliament, and both counties were fated to become the scene of repeated bloodssied. An order for Mr. Nicolls and Mr. Prideaux, two Cornissi gentlemen, members of the house, to go down and break the pacification, passed on the nth of March a ; but it appears that the truce which was- to precede the intended peace, was suffered to remain in force ; for we are told that it was net till the beginning of May, just before the expiration of the truce, that Major General Chudleigh advanced with a strong party of the parlia mentary forces against Launceston, then the head quarters of the King's army : by coming thus unawares, they gained some advantage at the first, but were in the end repulsed, and obliged to retire into Devonssiire \\ Not long afterwards, the King's forces being still at Launceston, the Earl of Stamford marched with a large army into the north of Cornwall, the only part of the county eminently disaffected to the King's cause, and encamped on the top of a steep hill near Stratton, from whence he sent Sir George Chudleigh with a considerable party of horse to sur prise Bodmin, and prevent the high ssieriff with the trained bands from coming to the assistance of the army at Launceston. Mean-time, the King's generals resolved to advance and engage the enemy notwithstanding any disadvantage of situation or numbers. On the fifteenth of May, they took their station within a mile of the parliamentary army ; the next morning, they divided into four detachments, all of which, with wonderful perseverance, gained the summit of the hill on which their enemies were stationed, and obtained a complete victory. Major General Chud leigh was taken prisoner ; the Earl of Stamford fled to Exeter. Considering the great disadvantages of the ground, and the superiority in numbers of the parlia mentary army, which was more than double that of the King's, this has been esteemed by historians as one of the most brilliant victories in the whole course of that unhappy war. A late writer calls it \" the most signal and most astonissiing instance of what determined valour can effect c.\" The King, to ssiew his sense of its importance, soon afterwards created Sir Ralph Hopton, Lord Hopton of Strat ton : after whose death, Sir John Berkeley, another of the generals who ssiared in the glories of this action, being created a baron by King Charles II., had the fame 2 Heath. \u25a0 Dugdale's View of the Troubles, p. 589. * Lord Clarendon, Whitlock, and Vicars. \u00ab Granger's Biographical History, II. p. 236. 1 honourable"], [35, "CORNWALL. XVII honourable distinction. The consequence of this victory was, that the whole of the parliamentary camp, with all the baggage, provisions, ordnance, ammunition, and a great number of prisoners, fell into the hands of the King's generals. When Sir George Chudleigh, who had succeeded without difficulty in surprising the town of Bodmin, and preventing the high ssieriff from assisting the King's forces with the train bands, heard the news of the Earl of Stamford's defeat, he made a hasty retreat with his horse to Exeter. The county of Cornwall being now in a state of security, the King's generals left garrisons in Saltassi and Milbrook, to check any incursions from the parliamentary garrison at Plymouth ; and marched with their forces to join Prince Maurice, and the Marquis of Hertford, in Somersetssiire. Here the Cornissi army gained as much honour, as they had done in their own county, and particularly distinguissied themselves at tht battle of Lansdowne, and at the siege of Bristol. The former proved fatal to the brave Sir Bevill Grenville, the latter to Sir Nicholas Slanning, governor of Pendennis Castle, and Col. John Trevanion, men of distinguissied gallantry ; they all commanded the regiments of volunteers, which they had raised to assist Sir Ralph Hopton, at his first coming into Cornwall. To ssiew his sense of these repeated proofs, which the Cornissi men had given of their attachment to his cause, the King wrote the following letter, which is not noticed by the noble historian, from whose work the greater part of this brief recital has been collected ; although he is not sparing in his commenda tions of the bravery and loyalty of the Cornissi : \u2014 \" C.

After the battle of Stratton, nothing worthy of note occurred in the county of Cornwall till the middle of July 1644, wheen the Queen retreated to Pendennis Castle, whence ssie embarked for France d. On the 20th of that month the Earl of Essex marched into Cornwall % contrary as it is said to his own judgment, being swayed by the advice of Lord Robarts and some Cornissi gentlemen, who were sanguine in their expectations, that by their presence and interest they ssiould be able to do great matters for the service of the parliament. Essex passed the Tamer at Newbridge f, after a ssiarp skirmissi with Sir Richard Grenville and a party of the King's forces who defended that pass g. He then took possession of Launceston and Saltassi*1. Sir Richard Grenville's house, which was garrisoned for the King, was taken by storm ' : the general then marched to Bodmin, and after-' wards to Lostwithiel and Fowey, where he fixed his head-quarters, and summoned the county to come in to his assistance k. Sir Richard Grenville retired before Essex's army, and having suffered some loss in a ssiirmissi at Lostwithiel with Lord Robart's brigade ', made good his retreat to Truro m. Mean-time the King having determined to pursue Essex's army, entered Cornwall on the 1st of August, at Polston-bridge. Previously to entering the county, he reminded his soldiers that they were going among a people who had ssiewn themselves much attached to his cause, and gave them the strictest caution to abstain from plunder. The King passed through Launceston, and slept that night at Trecarrel, Mr. Manaton's house, in the parissi of Lezant, his army being quartered around him in the fields.

Boconnoc-housc became afterwards the King's head-quarters. About this time His Majesty sounded the Earl of Essex, about detaching himself from the parlia ment, and with his own hand wrote a letter, in which he invited him to a pacific accommodation ; but the Earl peremptorily refused to listen to terms of any kind without the concurrence ol parliament. When the King advanced from Lissieard on the 7 th, he encamped his army on the entrance of Pinnock (or Broadoak), down, on the very spot where Governor Ruthen was defeated by the Cornissi in 1642. The next day the army advanced over Broadoak down towards Boconnoc, and in the evening towards Glynford ; the King encamped on the heath, where he spent the night in the midst of his army. He afterwards occupied Boconnoc house. The two armies remained nearly in the fame situation for several days, the King's- foot among the enclosures between Boconnoc and the heath, and his horse in and about St. Veep ; the Earl of Essex's forces occupying Lostwithiel and Fowrey, with the intermediate ground for their horse. Meanwhile Sir Richard Grenville advanced from Truro to Grampound, and thence to Bodmin, where he was successful in a ssiirmissi with the parliamentary horse. On the 1 ith of Au gust he took possession of Lord Robarts's seat at Lanhydrock, and of Resprin Bridge without opposition. On the 13th they took possession of the pass at St. Veep, and the ford below it, Hall-house n belonging to Lord Mohun, over against Fowey haven, and Pernon fort at its mouth, of which fort Colonel Page was made go vernor.

Restormel Castle was taken on that day by Sir Richard Grenville, and a square battery raised on the Beacon Hill at the extent of the King's quarters towards Lostwithiel. On the 26th General Goring and Sir Thomas Basset took possession of St.Austell and the western part of St.Blazey, and a place called the Parre, on the river which was the chief landing-place for provisions for the supply of the parliamentary army. The King's line at this time extended to Grampound, St. Enoder, Fowey, and to St.Blazey bridge p. Being now reduced to great straits, the Earl of Essex began to devise how to escape, and to make good a retreat for his army. Sir William Balfour, favoured by the darkness of the morning, it being about three o'clock, succeeded in his attempt of passing through the King's quarters with the whole body of the parliamentary horse on the 31st of August, and got safe out of the county by way of Carraton Down, Pillaton, and Saltassi. Essex with his army quitted Lostwithiel on the fame day ; the soldiers, on the morning of their departure, are said to have blown up the church, which, during their stay there, they desecrated and profaned in the most wanton manner q. During their inarch to Fowey, a kind of running fight was kept up between the two armies. In one of these ssiir missies the parliamentary army retreated to the ruins of an old castle called Castle-Dore r. That night the King encamped in the fields with his army very near the parliamentary quarters. The next day, Essex sent to propose a parley, but without waiting for the result, took ssiip at Fowey the same morning, with Lord Robarts and a few of their particular friends, and embarked for Ply mouth. General Skippon, who was left in command of the parliamentary army, then consisting of about 6000 men, immediately capitulated, and the whole of their arms, artillery, and ammunition was delivered up the next day. A parlia mentary diurnal 5 of that time, fays, that previously to the capitulation, the King's forces attacked those of the Parliament, that General Skippon, who fought like a lion, animated his men to make a brave resistance, and intimates that they forced the King to yield to his proposals for a capitulation, a copy of which is there given. By this agreement, the arms and the whole of the ammunition were to be given up, the parliamentary army were to have a safe convoy of 1 00 horse to Poole and Wareham ; the sick and wounded to lie at Fowey till cured ; the army to have on their march all the money they could procure from Plymouth, and other accom modations ; no soldier to be moved to turn to the King, except such as ssiould come voluntarily.

He had hitherto been very active for the King's service, yet, in consequence of some unpleasant misunderstandings then subsisting between Lord Goring and himself, he caused a proclamation to be read in all the churches throughout Cornwall, that if any of Lord Goring's forces ssiould offer to come into Cornwall, they ssiould ring the bells, and, thereupon, the whole county ssiould rise and beat them out. These divisions among the officers had already proved, in a great measure, fatal to the King's cause, before Sir Ralph, then Lord Hopton, was made commander in-chief of the western army. Sir Richard Grenville, although he had himself advised the measure of appointing a superior officer, from whom all others might receive orders, refused to obey Lord Hopton, and was in consequence, by the Prince's command, committed to prison at Launceston, from whence he was after wards sent to St. Michael's Mount : there he remained till the Parliament was possessed of the whole county, when, lest he ssiould fall into their hands, the Prince gave him leave to retire to the continent. Lord Hopton having (though sorely against his inclination) accepted the command of a divided, broken, and dis orderly army, was defeated by Sir Thomas Fairfax, at Torrington : from thence he retired to Stratton, the scene of his former honours, where he staid two or three days, till he was joined by the remainder of his foot. Sir Thomas Fairfax followed his steps into Cornwall, and the latter end of February, 1646, forced ' The dates of the greater part of the account of the King's expedition into Cornwall, in 1644, are taken from the narrative of his secretary, Sir Edward Walker.

Lord Hopton retired to Bodmin. About this time, Saltassi was finally abandoned by the King's forces. d The following particulars are given more at large by Sir Bulstrode Whitelocke than by any other historian : \u2014 Sir Thomas Fairfax marched to Bodmin, which was quitted by the King's forces the beginning of March. Cromwell was sent with a large party of horse to secure the pass, at \" Ware-bridge c.\" Sir Thomas Fairfax's army was quartered about Bodmin and Lostwithiel f, and spent some days securing all the neighbouring passes. During this time, Mount Edgcumbe was surrendered to the general, and many of the principal persons g of the county, among whom was Lord Mohun, came and submitted themselves to the Parliament. Sir Thomas Fairfax advanced from Bodmin towards Truro ; on the 7th of March, the army h held a rendezvous, and halted one night, four miles beyond Bodmin. The King's forces were quartered at this time near St.Columb, where a smart ssiir missi took place between the Prince's regiment and a detachment of the Parliamen tary army under Colonel Rich, in which the latter was victorious'1. On the 8th, Fairfax was quartered within three miles of Truro. A treaty was now set on foot, and, after having been some days in agitation, it was agreed by Lord Hopton, that his army, consisting of nearly 3,000 horse, ssiould be dissianded, and the horses, arms, ammunition, baggage, and artillery, delivered up to Sir Thomas Fairfax ; Lord Hopton to have a convoy of fifty of his own, and fifty of the parliamentary horse, to accompany him to Oxford k. Lord Clarendon fays, that Lord Hopton's officers were all in a state of mutiny, and that, on his ssiewing a reluctance to capitulate, they declared, that if he would not treat, they would treat for themselves ; that from that time, they neither kept guard, nor performed any other duty ; that Lord Hopton, being reduced to this dilemma, and having first sent his ammunition and foot to Pendennis and the Mount, gave the horse leave to capitulate, but declared, that he would not treat for himself or the gar risons ; and, quitting the army, repaired with Lord Capel ' to the Mount, whence, \u2022 Whitelocke. \" Lord Clarendon. c Ibid. * Heath. \u25a0 Whitelocke; most probably Wadebridge. f P.

Heath says, that at the time of this treaty, Lord Hopton's head-quarters were at Truro ; that the treaty was concluded at Tresilian Bridge ; and that immediately afterwards, though with much reluctance on the part of Lord Hopton, Sir Thomas Fairfax made Truro his head-quarters. This seems to be somewhat inaccurate ; for there is extant an official letter, addressed to Speaker Lenthall, printed by authority of parliament, dated Truro, March nth and 12th, 1645-6, Sir Thomas Fairfax's head-quarters being then in that town, and the treaty not completed. Whilst this treaty was in agitation, Mount Edgcumbe and Fowey were surrendered to Sir Thomas Fairfax \". The governors of Penryn and St. Mawes soon after sent in their submission \u00b0.

Mount surrendered to Colonel Hammond p, an event which is said to have been hastened by the influence of the Duke of Hamilton, at\" that time a prisoner there S. Pendennis was now the only garrison in Cornwall that remained in the King's hands, and, though closely in vested, both by sea and land, by Captain Fortefcue and Admiral Batten, was defended by its brave old governor John Arundell of Trerice to the last extremity ; and although the garrison had not provisions sufficient to last twenty-four hours, the treaty for capitulation was carried on with such spirit, that their real situation was never suspected, and they obtained as good terms as any garrison which had been surrendered during the war. Ragland and Pendennis Castles were the last garrisons in England which held out. Pendennis was surrendered about the middle of August 1646, when Captain Fortefcue, who commanded the besieging army, was appointed governor. r Whilst the Prince remained in Scilly, where he was much straitened for pro visions, the Parliament caused a letter S to be written to him, inviting him to place himself under their protection ; soon afterwards, a fleet of twenty-seven or twenty eight fail surrounded the island where he was, with the intention, as was supposed, of taking possession of his person, but was dispersed by a storm. On the 1 6th of April, the Prince quitted the island, which had afforded him but an insecure and incommod'ous retreat. The next day he landed in Jersey, and from thence sailed to France1.

Mr. Godolphin appears to have commanded these under Sir John Grenville\". In the month of April 1 651, the Dutch admiral, Van Tromp, lay before Scilly, and declared that he would assist the Englissi b in the reduction of these islands. The following month, Admiral Sir George Ayscough, with the parliamentary forces, took all the islands, except St. Mary's, which was not surrendered till June c, when Sir John Grenville was amongst the prisoners there taken. In the year 1667, the Dutch made an attempt to land near Cawland, in Cornwall, but were beaten off by the infantry on ssiore d. De Ruyter, the Dutch admiral, made an attempt also on Fowey harbour, but was repulsed. e Ancient and modern Division of the County. When the survey of Domesday was taken, the county of Cornwall was divided into seven hundreds ; Conarton, Fawiton, Pawton, Rialton, Stratton, Tibesta or Tibester na, and Winneton or Winnenton. There are now nine hundreds; East, West, Powder, and Kerrier, in the southern part of the county ; Stratton, Lesnewth, Trigg, Pyder, and Penwith, in the north and north-west. The alteration of the hundreds took place between the years 1088, when the survey was taken, and 1288, the time of the Lincoln taxation. Dr. Borlase says, that it would not be easy to discover the limits of the ancient divisions, or to reconcile it with the present. \" Conarton,\" he continues, \" it may be asserted with great probability, included the present hun dred of Penwith ; for the lord of the manor of Conarton has been lord also of all the hundred of Penwith from the time of Henry III. ; among the rest there is not the like connexion, but what was anciently called Tibesta, included, as I imagine, u Moderate Intelligencer, Feb. r8 \u2014 25, 1647. \u00bb Whitelocke x P.

Norden calls the hundred of Trigg the hundred of Bo- dannan alias Trigg. All the hundreds of Cornwall, from time immemorial, belonged to the Earls, and still continue to be attached to the duchy, except the hundred of Penwith ; and of this, two-thirds continued to belong to the duchy in the reign of James I., the other third, together with the bailissry of the hundred, as attached to the manor of Conarton, was granted, at an early period, to the family of Pincerna, and descended to the Arundells, who eventually became possessed of the entire lordssiip of the hundred. The manor of Conarton, and the hundred of Penwith, were lately purchased of Lord Arundell, of Wardour, by Sir Christopher Hawkins, Bart. The bailissry of the hundred of Stratton was attached to the manor of Norton-Rolle, in Lawncells ; that of East to an estate called Tymbrelham, or Temple-park ; that of West to Pengelly, in St.Neot ; that of Trigg to Bodannan, in Endellion ; that of Pyder to Rialton ; and that of Kirrier to Penwarne, in Mawnan. Some of them still continue to be so attached ; others have been separated. As no mention is made, either in the printed Domesday or in the MS. belonging to the church of Exeter, of the hundreds in which the manors described were severally situated, except certain manors, which appear by the Exeter MS. to have been in the hundred of Winianton, it would be impossible to form thence (except partially with respect to that hun dred now Kirrier) any comparative view of the respective limits of the ancient and modern hundreds. The fame circumstance renders it very difficult to appropriate the ancient names of manors to more modern names ; but it will be attempted, as far as possible, in the tables of Domesday manors, which will be given under the head of Ancient Landholders. Ecclesiastical Jurisdiclion and Division of the County. The county of Cornwall was anciently under the jurisdiction of Bissiops ot its own. It had been supposed, that their see was originally at Bodmin ; but the late learned Mr. Whitaker, in his elaborate work, intituled, \" The Cathedral of Cornwall,\" has clearly ssiown that it was first establissied at St.Germans, and there remained, till the reign of Canute, when the sees of St. Germans and Cre diton were united ; and Cornwall and Devonssiire were placed under the jurisdic tion of one Bissiop, who had his see at Exeter, as it has continued to the present Vol. III. d day."], [44, "CORNWALL. XXVI day. The limits of the archdeaconry of Cornwall are nearly the fame as those of the county3, but within it are thirty-two parissies of exempt jurisdiction b ; it is divided into eight deaneries ; East, Kirrier, Penwith, Powder, Pyder, Trigg- Major, Trigg-Minor, and West. The archdeacon's visitations are held annually about a month after Easter, at Launceston, Lissieard, Bodmin, Truro, Flelston, and Penzance. .The office of dean-rural, which, in many parts of the kingdom, is become merely nominal, is in Cornwall an efficient office. The deans-rural, who are appointed annually, make regular visitations to every church within their deanery, and report the state of the churches at the archdeacon's visitations. The spiritual court for the archdeaconry was held at St.Neot, till about the year 1750, when it was removed to Lostwithiel, and from thence, ssiortly after wards, to Bodmin, where it is still held. The courts are held once a fortnight, on Fridays; except during the holidays at Easter and Christmas. * Three Devonshire parishes, St. Giles in the Heath, Noilh-Petherwin, and Werritigton, are in the archdeaconry of Cornwall and in the deanery of Trigg-Major. It extends also over the islands of Scilly. b Of these, the following, being twenty-one in number, are in the peculiar jurisdiction of the Bishop of Exeter ; St.Anthony in Roseland, St. Breock, Budock, St.Evall, Eglofhayle, St.Erney, St. Ervan, Falmouth, St.Germans, Gerrans, Gluvias, St.Issey, Landrake, Lawhitton, Lezant, Mabe, St.Merrin, Milor, Padftow-town (the remainder of the parish being in the archdeacon's jurisdiction), Little-Petherick, South-Petherwin, and Trewen. The visitations for these peculiars are held at Launceston, Wade-bridge, St.Agnes, Falmouth or Penryn, Lostwithiel, and St. Ger mans. Wills and administrations for these parishes are registered, either at Doctors-Commons, or the Bishop's consistory at Exeter. The five parishes of St.Agnes, Boconnoc, Broadoak, Perran-zabuloe, and St.Winnow, are in the, peculiar jurisdiction of the Dean and Chapter of Exeter. Wills and administrations for these parishes are registered, either at Doctors-Commons, or in the registry of the Dean and Chapter at Exeter. The three parishes of Burian, St.Levan, and Sennen, are in the peculiar jurisdiction of the Dean of Burian. Wills and administrations for these parishes are registered, either at Doctors-Commons, or in the Dean of Burian's registry at Penzance. The courts for the deanery of Burian are held at Penzance. The wills and administrations of the parishes of Lanhydrock and Temple, the ecclesiastical juris diction of which is in lay hands, are registered, either at Doctors-Commons, or in the Archdeacon's registry at Bodmin. The wills and administrations for all other parishes in the county, as well as for St. Giles's in the Heath, North-Petherwin, and Werrington, in Devonshire, have been, and are registered, either at Doctors-Commons, or in the Archdeacon's registry at Bodmin, where, indeed, previously to the year 1740, they will generally be found. The registers commence with the year 1569, but there are few wills or administrations of an earlier date than 1602. The register is kept alphabetically as to parishes ; the wills and administrations being entered under each parish in chronological order. 1 Carew,"], [45, "CORNWALL. XXVII Carew, in his Survey of Cornwall, fays, \" Of parissies this county hath 161, as Master Camden noteth ; and, as others have, about 1 80.\" The former number, which was taken from Wolsey's list, must certainly have excluded all those parissies which had subordinate churches, called, in Cornwall, Daughter-churches ; such as Cury, Germoe, and Gunwallo, are esteemed with respect to their mother church, Breage ; yet these, and many others of the fame kind, have long since been esteemed separate parissies. Hals, in his Parochial Survey, makes the num ber of parissies 203 : among these, he includes the Devonssiire church of Bridge rule, Helston, and St.Thomas, near Launceston. Martyn, in his alphabetical table, makes the number also 203 ; but in this number, he includes not only Bridgrule, but North-Petherwin, a parissi solely in Devonssiire, and St.Erney, which is not\" in Hals's list ; whilst he omits Helston, Lostwithiel, Stratton, and Truro. Adopting St.Erney, Flelston, and St.Thomas, as separate parissies, but omitting Bridgrule and North-Petherwin, the number will be the fame as stated by Hals and Martyn, namely, 203. Of these, eighty-five are rectories, 100 are vicarages, and eighteen donatives or curacies ; the great tithes of most of the two latter descriptions are now lay-impropriations. Hals has given a calculation of the value of the several Cornissi benefices in the early part of the last century, in which that of St. Columb is estimated at 400I. per annum, being the only benefice stated to have been then worth more than 300I. He values the deanery of Burian, the rectories of St. Breock, St.Mi chael-Carhayes, Southill, and Stoke-Climsland, at 300I. Two of the other benefices are valued at 220I., fifteen at 200I., one at 170I., nine at 150I., twelve between iool. and 150L, and twenty-seven at iool. per annum, the remainder under iool.c ' St.Columb, Menheniot, Wendron, Liskeard, and Probus, are among the most valuable bene fices of the present day. d 2 Table"], [46, "CORNWALL XXVIII Table of Parishes.* \u2022 Those marked with an asterisk, are Peculiars. are subordinate or daughter-churches ; those printed in italics, Davidstow Rectory, Vicarage, or Ancient Names, where they can be ascertained.

XXXIII persons who had migrated thither from Ireland and Wales, we are assured by several respectable historians ; it seems probable that in process of time most of the parishes being called after \"the names of their patron-faints, the Cornish began to imagine that others, which perhaps retained the secular name, had been designated in the same manner, as St. Creed, St.Gluvias, St. Gorran, St. Gulvall, St. Kenwyn, St.Mabe, St.Mawgan, St.Mawnan, St.Mewan, St. Newlyn, St.Pinnock, St.San cred, St.Sithney, St. Wendron, &c. of whose history or whose festivals we know nothing, nor do we find their names in any of the martyrologies. Of late years, on the contrary, some parishes which take their names from saints, whose legends are well known, are generally spoken of and written without the addition of saint, such as Burian, Budock, Colan, Probus, Sennen, &c. Among the patron-faints of Cornish churches, who were known beyond the limits of Cornwall, were St. Blaze, Bishop and martyr, patron of the Wool-combers ; St. David, Archbishop of Carleon, and his mother St.Nonnette; St. Dennis; St. German, Bishop of Auxerre ; St.Wyn walloe, Abbot of Tauracum; St.Hilary ; St. Martin ; St.Neot ; St.Paulinus, Bishop of Rochester ; St. Olave and St. Nicholas, and a few other well-known saints of the Calendar. Among the native saints were Keby, son of Solomon, King of Cornwall (patron of St. Cuby, &c.) ; Melianus, King of Cornwall/and his son Melor (patrons of St.Mellion and Milor); Gerennius, King of Cornwall (patron of Gerrans) ; and St. Columba, a virgin and martyr, who gave name to St. Columb. Among the Welch saints we have Carantoc, son of Careticus, a King of Wales ; St. Colan ; St. Rumon, a Bishop ; and several of the twenty-four sons and daughters of Brechan, another King of Wales, mentioned by Leland and William of Wor cester, such as Keyne, Nectan, Endelient, Menfrede or Menfre, Tetha, Maben, Wenna, Morwenna, Cleder, and Adwen ; in whom we recognize the patron-faints of St. Keyne,' St. Nigh ton's chapel, St.Endellion's church, St.Minver, St.Teath, St.Mabyn, St.Wenn, Marham-church, Morwinstow, St. Cleather, and Advent. The most celebrated Irish saints were St. Petrock, patron of the priory of Bodmin; Fimbarrus, Bishop of Cork; St. Piran d, patron of the Tinners; and St. Burienne the Virgin, who built an oratory on or near the church which now bears her name ; Breaca, who appears to have been a noble female of high estima tion, came attended, as Leland informs us from an ancient history of her life, by d Mr. Whitaker supposes St. Piran and St.Kieran or Keverne to be the fame, but we think it can scarcely be supposed that they were so esteemed when the survey of Domesday was compiled, the latter being in that survey called St.Achebran? and it appears that they had distinct festivals, St.Piran's being March 5, St.Keveme's April 8.

St.Paternus, the Bishop, gave name to the Petherwins ; St. Probus the Con fessor to Probus. Among the patron-faints not giving name to the churches or parishes with which they were connected, may be reckoned St. Pratt, patron of Blisland; St.Simphorian, patron of Forrabury, Tintagel, and Veryan; St.Brevit or St.Vorek, Lanlivery ; St.Marnack, Lanreath ; St.Cyric and St. Juliot, of Luxu lion; St. Metherian or St. Mather, of Minster (perhaps the fame with St.Maddern); St.Torney, of Northill; and St.Nunn (Nonnette before-mentioned), of Pelynt. The chapels of ease in this county are few : at Grampound there is a chapel of ease to Creed ; at Penzance to Maddern ; at Marazion to St. Hilary ; St.Maw7esc to St.Just in Roseland; Trevenson, newly built by Lord de Dunstanville, to Illoggan ; St.Enodoc and St.Michael to St. Minver; East-Looe lo St. Martin ; Salt ash to St.Stephen ; and St.Nighton to St.Winnow. St.Michael's Mount is extra parochial: its church is supposed to have been the mother-church of St.Hilary. The ancient chapels, most of which have been wholly demolished, whilst of of others, generally speaking, small ruins only remain, Were very numerous. Mention will be made of them under the parishes in which they were severally situated. Among them were chapels said to have been dedicated to the following Irish or British saints, whose names we have not met with as patronizing any of the parish churches : \u2014 St.Aldhelm, Bishop of Sherborn, in St. Kew; St.Bellarmin in Cardinham; St.Cannock, one of the sons of King Brechan, in St. Veep; St. Congar in Lanivet ; St.Daye in Gwennap; St. Derwe in Camborne ; St. Dillower in Burian ; St.Elidius or St.Loy in Burian and St.Mellin; St. El van, Bishop of London, in Sithney ; St.Ethelred, King and martyr, in St.Dominick ; St.Ewin in Towednack ; St. Henry, the hermit, in Wendron ; St.Ildract (most probably Indract, a martyr, son of a King of Ireland who emigrated to Cornwall,) in St.Dominick; St.Illick in Endellion; St. Julian, or Ulian, in Tintagel; St. Laud (probably Laudatus, abbot of Bardsey,) in Milor ; . St. Sidwell in Launceston ; and St. Wynnel in St. Germans. Leland says that the patron of this chapel was Machutus, a Bishop. ic Among"], [53, "CORNWALL. XXXV Among the gilds at Bodmin was one dedicated to St. Anianus, the Bishop, of whom we find no mention in the Martyrologies ; he was so called to distinguish him from St.Anian, a King of Cumbria, of whom there is mention. There was a gild also at Bodmin dedicated to St. Erasmus the Bishop. Monasteries, Colleges, and Hospitals. The principal monasteries in this county were the Austin priories of Bodmin, Launceston, and St.Germans; the Austin monks had also a cell at Launcels, subject to Hertland, in Devonshire, and another at St. Anthony's, in Roseland, sub ject to Plympton, in the same county. The Benedictines had an alien priory at Tywardreth, to which there was a cell at Anthony, in Meneage ; another priory at St.Michael's Mount, a third at Minster or Talcarne, and a cell at Lammana, in the parish of Talland, subject to the abbey of Glastonbury. Dr.Borlase says, that there was a priory of Black Canons at Bonury, in Cornwall, but could not ascertain where Bonury was. The Cluniacshada cell at St. Cyric or St.Carrock, in St. Veep, subject to Montaeute, in Somersetshire. The Cistercians had a cell at St.Keverne, subject to Beaulieu, in Hampshire. The Knights-Hospitallers had a preceptory at Trebigh, in St.Ive. The Black Friers had a convent in Truro; the Grey Friers at Bodmin. Carew mentions also a house of friers at Launceston, but of what order is not known. The Poor Clares had a nunnery at Liskeard, another at Truro, and there is said to have been a third at Tresilian-bridge. There were nunneries, but of what order we have not been able to ascertain, at St. Bennets in Lanivet, at Credis in Padstow, a cell to St. Bennets; and at Hell noweth in St. Martins, in Meneage. Hals speaks of a nunnery at Trugan, in the parish of St. Michaels-Penkevill, but on very vague authority. At Padstow was a monastery, supposed to have been founded by St. Petrock, destroyed by the Danes in 981. There were colleges or collegiate churches at St.Burian, St.Columb, Constantine; at Penryn, calledGlaseny college; St. Karantoc or Crantoc'; Endellion; St.Neots; Probus; St. Piran, and St.Teath ; besides the more modern short-lived college, founded by Thomasine Bonaventure, at Week-St.Mary, not long before the Reformation. Near Bodmin was the ancient hospital of St. Lawrence, and in the town those of St.Anthony and St. George ; near Helston, in the parish of Sithney, an hospital under the government of a Prior, dedicated to St.John the Baptist. There were ancient hospitals also at Launceston, at Newport near Laun ceston, and in the parish of Menheniot, near Liskeard. Market e 2"], [54, "CORNWALL. XXXVI Market and Borough Towns. This county returns forty-four members to parliament, two knights of the shire and forty-two burgesses, the borough-towns being twenty-one in number. \" Cornwall,\" fays Carew, \" through the grace of its Earl, sendeth an equal if not a larger number of burgesses to any other shire. The boroughs so privileged, more of favour (as the case now standeth with many of them) than merit, are these following, Launceston,\" &c. (he omits Grampound and Penryn). How ever honourable this privilege may be esteemed, and whatever advantages may have been derived from it of later days, it appears that there have been times, and those not very remote, when the burden of maintaining their burgesses in London, during their attendance in parliament, was esteemed a grievance which was ill compensated by the honourable privilege of electing them. The following letter from Mr. Richard Edgcumbe', then one of the burgesses for Totness, to his constituents, written in the year 1565, seems to intimate that the customary fees or wages were not then paid with the greatest alacrity : \u2014 \" To the Right Worshipful the Mayor and Burgesses of Totness. \" After my most harty commendations : where I at my brothers request and for your fakes have been your burgess for the parliament to my no small coste, for myne expence were above twenty marks over and above the forty shillings g I received of you ; and forasmuch as it is like the parliament will go forward at this time, which causeth me to call to mind the charge I took in hand, which with like charge should be prosecuted if otherwise I prevented not the same. These are therefore to require you either to bestowe the same upon some other, or else to allow me but the bare fee, which is two shillings a day, and as I have begun so will I end, God willing, to your contentation. Truly at this present season I have no occasion, as I know of, to travel up to London, which considered, I think it reason that I demand, and hope you will take it as very reasonably de manded. Thus trusting you will return an answer of your determination herein with convenient speed, I most hardly commit you to God. From Mount Edgcumbe this 8th of September 1565.

XXXVII It appears that the custom of the boroughs maintaining their members ', had not been discontinued in the early part of the last century ; Hals, whose collections were brought down till about the year 1739, speaking of Helston, says, \" this place, and many others in Cornwall, are not able to maintain their burgesses in London, during the sessions, at their own proper costs and charges (as old was accustomed), in any tolerable port or grandeur, but have found that profitable expe dient (as many others) of making country-gentlemen free of their town, who bear the burden and heat of the day for them, and many times, for the honor of their corporations, distress their paternal estates, to exalt the reputation, and per petuate the privileges of a petty society, made up of mechanics, tradesmen, and inferior practitioners of the law.\" The fame kind of connection, probably, is still kept up in many instances, between country-gentlemen and the boroughs, though not exactly for the fame purpose, since it is not so difficult now to find persons who will accept a feat in the House of Commons, without insisting on the payment of daily wages, during their attendance on parliament. It is said that Padstow, Lelant, and Marazion, formerly sent members to parliament, but were excused, upon their petition, on the score of poverty. We cannot find any records to con firm the tradition, but it is certain that Marazion elected two members for the parliament of 1658 (Thomas Westlake and Richard Myll), though it does not appear that they ever took their feat.

The largest cattle fairs are those of Bodmin (Whitsun fair), Grampound (June 1 1.), Probus (July 5.), Menheniot (June n.), and Launceston (Novem ber 17.). Population. The number of persons in Cornwall, assessed, in the year 1377, to a poll-tax, from which only mendicants and children, under fourteen years of age, were exempted (including the religious of both sexes, who were taxed separately, and amounted to 686), was 34,960. This tax was levied immediately after a great plague, by which this county, and particularly the town of Bodmin, had been much depopulated. Carew fays, that it had been a question, whether Cornwall had been better stored with people than it was in his time ; some holding the affir mative, fays he, \" vouch to prove it, the general decay of inland towns, where whole streets, besides particular houses, pay tribute to Comdowne castle, as also the ruines yet resting in the wilde moores, which testifie a former inhabitance :\" \" touching the decayed inland townes,\" he observes truly, that \" they are counter vayled with a surplusage of increase of those on the coast, and the desolate walles in the moores have begotten a seven-fold race of cottages near the sea-side.\" The decay of the Cornish towns appears to have attracted the attention of parliament before Carew's time, and it seems not to have been confined to the inland towns, Truro as well as Bodmin, Launceston, Liskeard, and Lostwithiel, being included in an act of Parliament, passed in 1540, for the repairing those towns, and others therein mentioned. By this act, it was provided, that proclamation should be made for all owners of void places, which had been occupied by buildings, or of decayed and dilapidated houses, to rebuild on those sites ; if they should neglect this for three years, the High Lord, under whom such houses had been held, had power given him to rebuild on his own account ; if such High Lord neglected it for the space of two years after the expiration of the former time, the fame power was given to any persons or bodies politic, who had rent-charges on the premises ; on 2 their"], [69, "CORNWALL. XLIII their failure so to do for the space of one year\", the same power to go to the corpo rations of the several towns ; and in case of their neglect for three further years, the power to revert to the first owner, and so on as before d. It does not appear that any thing of consequence was done under this act. Since Carew's time, in consequence of the extension of the mining works, particularly since the copper mines have been worked to so great an extent, some of the most desolate moors, particularly in the neighbourhood of St.Agnes and Redruth, have become \" very well stored with people ;\" indeed Redruth itself has long since Carew's time grown into a town; St.Austell also, from its vicinity to the great mine at Polgooth, and from its having become a great thoroughfare on the road from Plymouth to the Lands-End, has grown from a mere village to be a considerable town. The populous town of Falmouth, containing, with its suburbs, near 5,000 souls, has risen from a village, almost too insignificant for notice. Mevagissey also, now very populous, is of more modern date as a town of any consequence. The total population of Cornwall, according to the census of 1801, was 188,269 persons, that of 181 1, 216,667, making an increase, within the last ten years, of 28,398, supposing the account of both periods to have been taken with equal accuracy. \" Rastall's Statutes. f 2 Callingtoi Inhabited Houses.

The climate of this county has been ascertained, by experience, to be pecu liarly favourable to life and health, its inhabitants having been long noted for their longevity. \" For health,\" fays Carew, \" eighty and ninety years of age is ordinary in every place, and in most persons accompanied with an able use of the body and senses. In the parish where God hath seated my poor dwelling, I remember the decease of four, within fourteen weeks space, whose years, added together, made up the sum of 340.\" A Cornish correspondent of Mr.Polwhele's observes3, that in the language of the West, they lhould not call a person of seventy or eighty aged. In Worgan's agricultural survey of this county is an interesting paper, drawn up by the Rev. John Trist, vicar of Veryan, on the population of that parish, which, in 1810, consisted of 1220 persons. Having kept his registers, as it appears, with great accuracy, during an incumbency of thirty years, and very judiciously noted, as ought to have been done in all cafes, and as is now enjoined by authority, the ages of all persons buried, he has ascertained that, infants in cluded, the proportion of persons buried within these thirty years, who had ex ceeded eighty years of age, was one in eight ; those who had exceeded ninety, one in fifty -three and a half. Mr. Trist, in a note, has quoted an opinion of Mr. Jonas Hanway, that the general average of those who attain the age of eighty is one in thirty-two. By the London bills of mortality it appears, that one only in forty lives to eighty. Dr.Price has quoted, as an extraordinary instance, a parish in Shropshire, in which one in twenty-four had attained the age of eighty. Mr. Trist supposes that the result of his data will afford a fair estimate of the state of the other parishes in Cornwall, situated as Veryan is, on the southern coast. \" The proportion of deaths,\" he observes, \" to the sum total of the living, is less than has been recorded in any political computation whatever, being as one to ninety b.\" In Cumberland, where, throughout the diocese of Carlisle, the ages of all persons buried have been noted in the parish register for thirty-five years past, in consequence of an injunction of a former Archdeacon, we have had the opportunity in many, particularly in some of the most populous parishes, of ascertaining the proportion of persons who had attained the ages of eighty and ninety. We were induced to 1 Vol. IV. p. 52. J! Dr. Haygarth has stated, that in Chester (it being a remarkably healthy town) one in forty dies annually. Mr. Arthur Young fays, that in the neighbourhood of his parish, Bradfield-Combust, in Suffolk, one in forty dies annually ; in that parish, one in sixty-two ; in Lowestoff, one in forty -six. 1 2 undertake"], [75, "CORNWALL. XLIX undertake the search in that county as often as we had the opportunity, in con sequence of the prevailing opinion of the longevity of its inhabitants ; the circum stance of the registers was peculiarly favourable, and the result was in general the fame as Mr. Trist found it to be in his parish of Veryan, that one in eight had attained the age of eighty ; in some parishes we found that one in seven had attained that age, and even in the populous parishes of Carlisle, so much more un favourable to longevity, the average, including infants, was one in ten. Carew has recorded the following extraordinary instances of longevity : \u2014 \" One Polzew,\" fays he, \" lately living, reached unto 1305a kinsman of his to 1 j 2 ; one Beauchamp to 1 06 ; Jean Brawne, the beggar, a Corniihman by wandering (for I cannot fay by inhabitance), though Irish by birth, outscoreth a hundred winters by I wote not how many revolutions.\" He speaks, in another place, of one Prake, of Talland, aged no. The Rev. Thomas Cole, minister of Landewednack, who died and was buried there in 1683, is said, in the register, to have been above 120 years of age. Dr. Borlase relates an anecdote of his walking to Penryn and back, a distance of thirty miles, not long before his death, on the authority of Mr. Erisey, who met him on the road. Michael George, sexton of the same parish, was buried March 20, 1683, aged, as is said in the register, upwards of 100 years. Dr.Bor lase speaks also of an old man of the name of Collins, upwards of 100, whom he saw on a tour to the Lizard : this man (Sampson Collins) was buried at Ruan-Major in 1754, aged 104. Dr.Borlase tells us also, on the authority of Mr. Scawen, of Molineck, of a woman who died at Gwythian, in 1676, at the age of 164. There is no entry of this woman's burial in the register, but by an inquiry, obligingly instituted by the present rector, Mr. Hockin, we find she is well known by tradition among the oldest inhabitants. Her name was Cheston b Mar chant. The tradition of the place is, that she had a new set of teeth and new hair in her old age, and that travellers, who came to see her out of curiosity, frequently took with them a lock of her hair : it is said also, that she spoke only the Cornish language, and that she was many years bedridden. Mr. Polwhele mentions Henry Brenton, a weaver, of St.Wenn, who died in the reign of George I., aged 103 ; Mrs.Trevanion, who died at Bodmin in 1769, aged 107 ; Mr. Richardson, of Tregony, who died in 1770, aged 102 ; Mrs.Blanch Littleton, of Lanlivery, aged 101 (the three last on the authority of the Annual Register) ; a lady at Eglofhayle, aged 112 ; Maurice Bingham, a fisherman of St.Just, who died in 1780, aged 116; Elizabeth Kempe, of Wendron, who died in 179 1, b The name of Cheston occurs more than once as a female name in the pedigree of the Nanspe rians, a family who lived in the neighbouring parish of St. Erth.

With respect to Elizabeth Woolcock, Mr. Polwhele was misinformed ; although, by common report, she was considered many years older, her age, we are informed, did not exceed ninety, at the time of her death, which happened about two years ago. Mrs.Zenobia Stevens, of Skilly- Waddon, in the parish of Towednack, who was buried at Zennor in 1763, at the age of 102, was tenant for ninety-nine years of the tenement of Trevidgia-Warra, held under the Duke of Boston's manor of Ludgvan-Lees ; and we are informed from good authority, that when she went, on the expiration of the term, being of course in her 100th year, to the Duke's court at St.Ives, she excused herself from drinking a second glass of wine, because it was growing late, and she had some way to ride home upon a young colt. Her daughter, Mrs.Zenobia Baragwanath, lived to the age of ninety-eight or ninety nine.' Elizabeth Fradd, aged 103, was buried at St. Kew in 1803. Henry Martin, aged 1 01, was buried at Stithian in 1812. Division of Property at the Time of the Domesday Survey. At the time of the Domesday survey, the landed property of Cornwall was chiefly divided between the King, Robert Earl of Mortaine, in Normandy, (by English writers called Moreton,) and of Cornwall, the King's half brother, and those who held under him ; the Bishop of Exeter, the Prior and convent of Bod min ; the Abbot and convent of Tavistock ; and a few other monasteries and colleges. Twenty manors were held by various persons under the Earl, who held them under the King's great manor of Wineton (Wynianton). This, and fourteen other manors,then in the crown,had belonged to Earl Harold \\ The Queen, Matilda, had four manors in her own hand, and a fifth was held under her, as described in the Exeter MS. : after her death, in 1 083, these fell to the crown. The Bishop of Exeter e From the information of her great nephew, communicated by the Curate of St. Ives. * Three of the Earl of Cornwall's manors also had belonged to Earl Harold. 2 held"], [77, "CORNWALL. LI held seven manors in his own hand ; four others were held under him. The Prior and convent of Bodmin held six in their own hands ; nine manors were held under them by the Earl of Cornwall, and three by other persons ; seven manors, which had been taken away from that church, were then held under the Earl. The Abbot and convent of Tavistock held six manors ; four -others are stated to have been unjustly taken away from them by the Earl of Cornwall. The Prior and convent of St. Michael had one manor ; another had been taken away from them by the Earl. The collegiate churches of St.Carantoc, St.Achebran (St.Keverne), St.Burian, St. Constantine, St.Neot, St. Piran, and Probus, had one manor each; that of St.Stephen at Launceston, four. The remainder, except one manor, which belonged to Goscelmus, and another which belonged to Judhil de Totenais, were vested in Robert Earl of Moreton and Cornwall, or those who held under him. The number of manors held by this great Earl has been incorrectly represented. Dugdale states them at 248 ; Hals, and other writers of later date, at 288. Am ple as his possessions were, these numbers give a very exaggerated view of them. According to the Exeter copy of the Domesday survey, including all his usurpa tions from the church, he possessed the fee of 285 manors in Cornwall ; but of these, he held only thirty-six in his own hands, and of the thirty-six, ten are stated to have been held, not by Comes ipfe, as the others, but by Comes et villani, that is, his tenants in villenage. This, therefore, must be considered as the actual amount of his landed property ; from the other manors, which appear to have been 249 in number, he received certain high or chief rents, as lord-paramount. As he had numerous manors in eighteen other counties, it is probable that he was the greatest landholder then in the kingdom.* The greatest landholder under the Earl was Rainaldus or Reginald, who held thirty-nine manors, including the manor and castle of Trematon. There can be no doubt that this was Reginald de Valletort, who is known to have possessed the honor of Trematon at a period not much later. Dugdale mentions Reginald de Valletort as witnessing a deed in the reign of William Rufus, which he speaks of as the first mention he had found of the family : he does not seem to have been aware, that his property is described in the Domesday survey. Ricardus held twenty-nine manors. Reginald, who was created Earl of Corn wall in 1 1 40, married the daughter of William Fitz-Richard, of Cornwall, who is described as having Comitatus Cornubiensts ampliffimum principatum f ; no doubt * Kelham fays, that he held 793 manors, in various counties, including, of course, those which were held under him. 1 Gejta Stephani inter Hist. Normannorum Scriptores, p. 950. g 2 this"], [78, "CORNWALL. LII this was a son, and the Fitzwilliams immediate descendants of the Ricardus of Domesday. They were all possessors of the manor of Tywardreth, and bene factors to the monastery at that place. Hamelin, supposed to have been the ancestor of the Trelawny family, and to have resided at Treloen, one of the manors described in the survey, as his property, held twenty-two manors under the Earl ; Turstin, the sheriff, twenty-seven ; Nigell, eleven ; Offers or Osferd, ten ; Bernerus, twelve, and Joinus, thirteen. We know nothing of the posterity of these persons. Alured and Bristicius held seven manors each ; Algar, Brient, Ermenald, and Odo, six each ; Alnod, Blohin g, and Roger, five each ; Alward, four ; Andrew, Erchenbald, Levenot, and Ulsi, three each ; Alwin, Alric, Dodo, Godwin, Griffin, Osfil, and Rabel, two each ; twenty-nine others, one manor each. Among these are several Saxon names, as Almar, Brixi, Ulric, Ulward, &c. It appears by the survey, that some of the Saxons, who still continued to possess landed property in Cornwall, had much more extensive property in the reign of Edward the Confessor, particularly Algar and Dodo. The above statement is made from the Exeter copy of the Domesday survey, which, in some particulars, varies from the copy printed from the Exchequer re cord h. The following table of the Domesday manors is taken from the Exeter manuscript ; for an analysis of which (by permission of the Dean and Chapter) we were indebted to Mr. Ralph Barnes. It contains the owners of each manor in the reign of Edward the Confessor, and at the time of taking the survey, with the ancient names appropriated to existing manors, as far as we have been able to do so, either with certainty or by probable conjecture. * In this name we recognize the ancestor of the ancient family of Bloyhon or Bloyowe, which became extinct (at least in its elder branch) in the fourteenth century, when the heiress married Tinten. h According to the Exchequer Domesday, Nigel had twenty-three manors, twelve of which were in other hands, at the taking of the former survey ; Turstin, on the contrary, had only twenty manors, according to the Exchequer Domesday, according to the other, twenty-seven ; Ermenald, whose name does not appear in the Exchequer Domesday, is stated, in the ether record, to have held six manors. These are some of the chief variations of property ; some of the smaller land holders vary in the number of manors also, from three to five, two to four, &c. It is evident that the Exeter MS. is of prior date, and that the survey was taken before 1083, as it appears that the Queen was then living. The printed survey states the King to be possessed of those manors which bad been settled on Queen Matilda."], [79, "CORNWALL LIII Names of Manors in the Domesday Survey. Modern Names.

Towards the close of the twelfth century, about five and thirty years later than the Liber Niger d, there are two scutage-rolls in the Exchequer, which give us the principal land-holders of that period, and so fluctuating was then the state of pro perty, that although they must have been within two or three years of each other % yet they exhibit a considerable change. Robert de Cardinan, by far the greatest land-holder, is, in both of these, stated to hold seventy-one knights-fees. These appear to have been the fame which were held by Robert Fitz- William, in 166 $ ; and it is evident from this, and other circumstances, that he married the heiress of Fitz- William. In the Liber Niger, Fitz- William is said to hold twenty of his knights lees under Walter Hay. In one of the scutage-rolls before-mentioned, Walter Hay is said to hold forty knights-fees, in right of Agnes his wife. We have not been able to find any thing further relating to this great land-holder, or who his wife Agnes was. Reginald de Valletort, in one of these rolls, is stated to hold fifty-nine fees, in the other only fifty-one. Half of the fees which had belonged to Richard de Lucie are said to have been held, 8 Richard I., by Geffrey de LacelP. Robert Lord Fitz- Walter (who was not many years after, generalissimo of the barons army, at the celebrated convention of Runnemede), is stated, in one of the rolls, to have been possessed of eleven knights-fees, which had belonged to his uncle Richard de Lusti (Lucy). This Robert, in 1198, succeeded his father, Walter Fitz-Robert, who had married Maud s, one of the daughters and coheirs of the Justiciary. Nine other knights-fees are said, in the same roll, to have been held by Robert b Brother of Reginald Fitz-Henry, Earl of Cornwall, and of course one os the illegitimate sons of King Henry I. by the daughter of Robert Corbet. e Roger de Mandeville's estate must have been that which belonged to Queen Matilda, and was parcel of the honor of Gloucester. d Printed in Carew's Survey, f. 44, b. and 49, b. \" It is difficult to fay which is the earlier of these : one of them, referring to the date of 8 Rich I., could not have been earlier than 1 196 ; the other could not have been before 1198, as in that year Robert Fitz-Walter succeeded his father, Walter Fitz-Robert.

LXVI Peverell, as trustee, probably, for Rohesia de Lucy h, the other coheiress. Robert Fitz- Walter's lands, in Cornwall, were seized by King John, and given to the cus- tody of his own son Henry, and were perhaps never restored, as we find no men- tion of his posterity possessing lands in Cornwall. Rohesia afterwards granted all her lands, in Cornwall, to William de Briwere '. In one of the rolls, Nicholas Fitz- Geossrey is said to have held ten knights-fees, being, no doubt, son of Geoffrey Fitz-Baldwin, who held the fame number in 1 165 ; and it seems to have been the fame property which, according to the other roll, was held by Thomas de Mid- dleton de honore de Middleton. These fees were granted by King John, in 1203, to William Briwere above-mentioned. This property, of course, we trace no far- ther. William de Botterell, or Bottreaux, continued to hold twelve knights-fees in the reign of Richard I., as his ancestor had done in that of Henry II. ; and this property continued in the family till the reign of Edward IV., after which it passed, by successive female heirs, to Hungerford and Hastings, and was sold to various persons by the Earls of Huntingdon. Robert de Tintagel and William de Albe- marle are stated, in one of the rolls, to hold five knights-fees each. The latter possessed his estate in right of his wife, the relict of Robert de Bikehat. These names do not occur in the other record, but, in their stead, appear those of Wil- liam Fitz-Richard and Gervase Fitz-William, holding the fame number. Ralph Bloyon (Bsoyowe), and Archenaund Flandrensis (Fleming), according to one of the rolls, held seven knights-fees each. In the other roll, these fees are stated to be held by Alan Blund (Bloyon or Bloyowe), and Stephen Flandrensis. The Flemings had their chief seat in Devonshire, and large property in Ireland, where they were, at an early period, barons of Slane. They continued to possess property in Cornwall as late as the sixteenth century, and are supposed to have given name to the parish of Botesfleming. The possessions of the Bloyowes, whose seat was at Polrode, in St.Tudy, passed, by female heirs, to the families of Tinten, Carminow and Courtenay. William Earl Reginald's brother, when the entry respecting him on one of these rolls was made, continued to hold the four knights-fees which he held in 1 1 65 ; and we are of opinion, that this circumstance will determine the priority of the two rolls, if Henricus Fil-Willielmi of the other roll, holding the fame number of knights-fees, should be supposed to be, as is very probable, the son and heir of this * The mother of Fulbert de Dover, wlio married Rohesia de Lucy, was one of the coheiresses of Pain Peverell of Cambridgeshire.

One of the coheiresses married Reginald Mohun ; but we do not find these manors among the possession* of the Mohuns. 5 William,"], [93, "CORNWALL. lxvii William, whose name does not appear in the other roll \\ It is not unlikely that he was ancestor of the Fitz- William family, whose heiress married Mohun. Ralph de Rupe, who held three knights-fees in the reign of Richard I., was ancestor of Odo de la Roche, whose name appears in the record of Edward III., hereafter mentioned. In one of the rolls, Richard Wallensis and William de Bosco Roardi held two knights-fees each. Among those who held one knights-fee each were Henry Fitz-Count, afterwards, for a time, Earl of Cornwall : Simon Pincerna, the heiress of whose family married Arundell ; and in one of the rolls (which we believe to be that of prior date), Alan, and in the other Walter de Dunstanville. Alan's daughter brought an estate in Cornwall, as a marriage-portion, to the Bassets, whose landed property, in this county, appears to have been considerably krger than the Dunstanvilles had been, before the 17th year of Edward H., when they were returned in the first class of land-holders. In what we suppose to be the latter roll, we find, for the first time, the name of Henry de Pomeroy. The num ber of knights-fees which he held is not specified. In the 40th of Henry III., this family was returned among the first class of land-holders, and they continued to possess considerable landed property in Cornwall for several generations, their chief seat being at Tregony. The next record which furnishes us with an account of the principal Cornish land-holders, is one of 40 Henry III. (1255.) It includes all those who were possessed of fifteen librates of land, or more, and held by knight-service. Richard de Grenville, whose family now appear on record for the first time, as possessed of landed property in Cornwall, appears to have been then the largest land-holder, being possessed of fifty librates of land. Thomas de Tracy, in right of his wife, heiress of the Cardinans, had forty librates' and more; the Val letorts, forty ; the Pomeroys, thirty ; the Carminows, whose property, as well as the family, spread far and wide, both continuing to be esteemed among the first in the county, till the reign of Queen Elizabeth, appear on record here for the first time, being stated to have held sixteen librates of land ; the Flamancks, whose name still continues, although most of the landed property has passed to the heiresses of elder branches, held the fame quantity. Roger de Mesy, and William Wise, held also sixteen librates each. The Beauchamps still remaining, and possessed of k We think it more likely also, that Walter should be the successor of Alan, than Alan of Wak ter de Dunstanville. 1 A small part of this seems to have passed to the Traceys, for we find John Tracey holding a small estate in Coirwall, in the 20th of Edward III. It is probable that this was John Tracey, the last heir-male of the Traceys of Wollecombe Tracey.

This estate passed, by successive female heirs, to the Archdeknes and Carews. In the 17th year of Edward II. (1323), we have a list of knights and esquires (the latter somewhat mutilated), all of whom held forty librates of land. Among these, we find, for the first time, the name of Champernon, as a great Cor- nish land-holder, having by marriage with Joan Plantagenet, a natural daughter of Richard, King of the Romans, acquired large estates m, which were dispersed among coheiresses in the reign of Queen Elizabeth ; the Blanchminsters ( De a/bo monasterio), whose estates passed successively to the Coleshills and Arundells ; the Archdeknes, representatives of the Hacumbes, a part of whose estates passed to the Carews of Anthony ; the Bodrugans, whose large possessions were forfeited in the reign of Henry VII., and granted to Edgcumbe, Trevanion, and Pawlet ; the Dawneys, whose estates passed to the Courtenays ; the Ferrers family \", whose estates passed to the Vyvyans ; the Bassets, before-mentioned, whose estates, con- siderably augmented by heiresses of later date, are inherited in a direct line by Lord de Dunstanville ; the Dinhams, who appear to have acquired, by grant or purchase, a part of the large property of the Cardinans, and whose estates were divided among coheiresses in the reign of Henry VIII. ; the Mohuns, whose large estates having been purchased by his Lady's ancestor, are now, in her right, vested in Lord Grenville; the Refkymers, whose estates passed to co- heiresses in the sixteenth century ; the Prideaux family, whose male-line still continues possessed of considerable property, although the original estate of their ancestors passed, with the heiress of the elder branch, to the Herles, about the reign of Richard II. ; the family of Serjeaux, or Cereseaux, whose estates were about the fame time divided among coheiresses ; the Lambourns and the family of Le Sor or Sore of Talverne, the heiresses of which brought their estates to two branches of the Arundells ; the Petits, whose estates were divided among co- heiresses, in the fifteenth century ; the Tintens, whose estates passed, by a female heir, to the Carminows, in the reign of Edward III. ; the Beaupres (Bello prato), whose estates passed, through female heirs, to the Trevanions ; the De Pyns or Pynes, long since removed into Devonshire ; and the families of Bendys and De \" In the record of 20 Edw.

The former had been some time settled in Cornwall, and had married the heiress of Trembleith, but had then lately acquired considerable estates, by marrying the heiress of Lanherne. By matches with other heiresses, their landed property increased to so large an extent, that they obtained the appella tion of the Great Arundells. The greater part of these estates descended to Lord Arundell, of Wardour, as will be hereafter explained more at large. Most of this property has, of late years, been sold. The estates of the Arundells of Trerice, upon the extinction of that family, passed, under a settlement, to the Acklands of Devonshire. In this record also appear, for the first time, the following names: \u2014 Cornwall, descended from a natural son of Richard, Earl of Cornwall, and King of the Romans, whose estates passed, by successive female heirs, to Hendower and Tanner, and have since been alienated ; Hewis or Hiwis, whose estates passed, by inheri tance, to the Coleshills ; Peverell, of Park, whose estates were divided between the Bassets and Hungerfords ; Cheynduit, whose estates were divided between the families of Trejago and Roscarrock; Beville, whose estates were inherited by the Grenvilles; De Kan (De Cant of Cant, in Minver) ; the baronial family of Lansladron, whose heiress married Govely and the heiress of Govely Trerice ; the Kyrnyells, whose estates passed to the St.Aubyns ; Meules (Moyle of Bake), whose estates are now possessed by their immediate descendant, Sir Joseph Copley, Bart. ; Killi- \u2022 There is a record of nearly the fame date (20 Edw.

Among families of later date, who have been considerable land-holders (exclu sively of those of the present day), may be mentioned the Tregians, whose large estates were seized by Queen Elizabeth, and granted chiefly to the Hunsdon family, when Francis Tregian was convicted of concealing Cuthbert Mayne, a popish priest. The greater part were purchased of Lady Hunsdon, thirty years afterwards, by Francis Tregian the younger, but were soon afterwards sold either by himself or his brother ; Ezekiel Grosse, Esq. became possessed of most of this property by purchase, and it is now, by inheritance from his daughter, vested in the Buller family. The Godolphin family, whose estates have descended to the Duke of Leeds, are not mentioned among the land-holders of the periods before spoken of. The Robartes family acquired their large possessions, now vested in their descendant, the Hon. Mrs. Agar, in the reign of James I. The family of Treise became possessed of large landed property in the last century, which passed, with the heiress of Sir Christopher Treise, to Sir John Morshead's father. A great part of this has been alienated. Exclusively of the duchy estate p, which is still of considerable value, although much diminished by the sale of several manors, under the act for the redemption of the land-tax, the three principal land-holders in the county are Lord de Dunstan ville, who, besides what remained of the ancient patrimony of his ancestors, after the losses sustained in consequence of their loyalty in the civil war, inherits large estates from the families of Hele and Pendarves; Lord Eliot, whose valuable estates, comprising two-thirds of the large and fertile parish of St.Germans, were acquired chiefly by an exchange, in 1565, for lands in Devonshire; and Lord Falmouth, whose paternal estates have been from time to time augmented by matches with Cornish heiresses, of the families of Tregothnan, Albalanda, Bret, Tregarrick, Halep, and Carminow.

Nobility os the County. It is an observation of Dr. Borlase's, that peerages planted in Cornwall have seldom been long-lived, have seldom arrived at the third, never at the fourth gene ration ; and that this observation was equally applicable to the illustrious persons who had taken their title from the county ; and that whilst other counties, as Devonshire, Oxford, Norfolk, &c, had transmitted their titles to several successive generations in the fame family, it might be said of the title of Cornwall, as of other titles connected with the county, \" vix gaudet tertius hares.\" Earldom of Cornwall. The history of this title, before it was settled upon the King's eldest son, justifies Dr. Borlase's observation. William the Conqueror gave it to his relation, Robert Earl of Morteyne, commonly called Moreton, by whose son William, it was for- feited in the reign of Henry I. The natural son of that monarch, Reginald Fitz-Henry, who was invested with the title by King Stephen, left no legitimate male issue. King Henry II. gave the Earldom to his son John. After this, Henry Fitz-Count, natural son of Reginald above-mentioned, enjoyed it for a few years by sufferance. In 1 2 1 9, he resigned it into the hands of King Henry III., and in 1224, the King's son Richard, afterwards King of the Romans, was created Earl of Cornwall. This Richard, Earl of Cornwall, left an only son Edmund, who dying without legitimate male issue, in 1300, the title again lapsed to the crown. King Edward II. gave it to his favourite, Piers de Gaveston, who was beheaded at Warwick in 1312. After this, the title was not revived till the year 1328, when it was bestowed by King Edward III. on his second brother, John of Eltham. The following year the King created his eldest son (afterwards known by the name of the Black Prince) Duke of Cornwall, and some years after procured an act of parliament for settling this title (together with the large possessions annexed to it) on the first-begotten son of the King of England. On the death of this illustrious Prince, his son, afterwards Richard II., being not entitled to the dukedom by the act then lately passed, was created Duke of Cornwall by his 9 grand-"], [99, "CORNWALL. lxxiii grandfather. Since his time, the title has been enjoyed under this act r, without creation, by the following illustrious personages: \u2014 Kings Henry V. and Henry VI., before their accession to the throne ; Edward, son of the latter ; Edward V. ; Edward, son of Richard III. ; Arthur, son of Henry VII., and his younger brother Henry, afterwards Henry VIII. ; Henry, son of James I., and his younger brother Charles, afterwards Charles I.; Charles II. ; King George II.; Frederick Prince of Wales, and its present possessor, His Royal Highness the Prince Regent. The Earls of Cornwall had their chief residence at Launceston castle; they also re sided occasionally at the castles of Tintagel, Liskeard, Rostormel, and Moresk. Tre maton was not in the immediate possession of the Earls till the reign of Edward III., from which time they have all ceased to be inhabited ; for the county has never been honoured with the ducal residence, \" by reason of which,\" says Carew, \" the strength of their castles could not so guard them against the battery of time and neglect, but that from fair buildings, they fell into foul reparations ; and from foul reparations, are now sunke into utter ruine.\" Cornish Families which have been ennobled. Edgcumbe, Earl Mount-Edgcumbe. \u2014 Although this nobleman's mansion of Mount-Edgcumbe, whence he takes his title, and which is his constant country residence, is situated in Devonshire, yet, as his demesne extends into Cornwall, the church-town of Maker, the parish in which Mount-Edgcumbe is situated, being in that county ; \u2014 as Cotehele, the ancient residence of his ancestors, before they pos sessed Mount-Edgcumbe, still kept up and occasionally visited by the family, is on the Cornish bank of the Tamar; \u2014 as he possesses large estates in Cornwall, forfeited by Sir Henry Bodrugan, whose capital mansion of Bodrugan was many years a scat of the Edgcumbes; \u2014 his family comes expressly under the title prefixed to this head.

The site of the priory became the residence of the Eliot family, and acquired the name of Port Eliot. Daniel Eliot, Esq., who died in 1702, left an only daughter married to Browne Willis, Esq., the celebrated antiquary. To keep up the name of his family, he bequeathed his estate to Edward Eliot, grandson of Nicholas, fourth son of Sir John Eliot, who died in 1632, as we are informed on Browne Willis's authority. Edward Eliot, Esq., a nephew of Edward above-mentioned, was created Baron Eliot of St.Germans, in 1784, and was succeeded by John Eliot Craggs, the pre sent and second Lord Eliot. The Eliot family, after their settling in Cornwall, married the coheiress of Carfwell, and sole heiress of Gedy. The late Lord Eliot married the heiress of Ellison, of South-Weald in Essex. Arms of Eliot : \u2014 Argent, a fesse Gules between two bars gemelles wavy Azure ; but the late Lord Eliot assumed the name and arms of Craggs (his father having married a natural daughter of Secretary Craggs).

Trefusis, Lord Clinton and Say. \u2014 Although the ancient Cornissi family of Trefusis did not acquire the barony of Clinton and Say till 1794, we are aware that his barony stands fourth in the list of Englissi barons. The Trefusis family is to be traced, as resident at Trefusis, in Milor, the seat of their descendant Lord Clinton, four generations before 1292. During the course of twenty-three descents, they have married the heiresses of Delechamp, Treviados, and Balun ; and coheiresses of Martin, Halep, Tresithney, Colan, Trevanion, Gaverigan, and k 2 Cotton;"], [102, "lxxvi CORNWALL. Cotton ; besides the match with Rolle, through which the barony of Clinton and Say was acquired, Francis Trefusis, Esq. having married Bridget, daughter of Robert Rolle, Esq., of Heanton, who had married Arabella, the elder daughter and coheir of Theophilus Clinton, Earl of Lincoln. The barony of Clinton and Say being in abeyance between the coheirs of this Earl, was given by King George I., in 1721, to Hugh Fortefcue, son and heir of Hugh Fortefcue, Esq., of Filleigh, in Devonssiire, by Bridget, sole heiress of Hugh Boscawen, of Tregothnan, who had married one of the coheiresses of Clinton, and who in 1746 was created Baron Fortefcue, and Earl Clinton. On His Lordssiip's decease without issue, in 1751* the barony of Clinton and Say ' devolved to Margaret, only daughter of Samuel Rolle, Esq. (only brother of Bridget above-mentioned), then recently become the widow of Robert Walpole, second Earl of Orford. On the death of her son George, Earl of Orford, in 1791, this title was claimed by George William Trefusis, Esq., the descendant, in the fourth generation, of Francis Trefusis and Bridget Rolle. The claim was allowed by the House of Lords in 1794. Robert Cotton St.John Trefusis, the present Lord Clinton and Say, succeeded his father in 1797, being then a minor. Trefusis house is still the family-seat. Arms of Trefusis : \u2014 Argent, a chevron, between three wharrow spindles, Sable.

A younger branch of the Trefusis family, settled at Landew in Lezant, became extinct in the reign of Charles I., when the coheiresses married Herle and Killiow. Basset, Lord de Dunstanville. \u2014 The ancient family of Basset of Cornwall and Devonssiire are descended from Osmund Basset, most probably a younger son of Sir Ralph Basset, the justiciary, in the reign of Henry I., as Sir Ralph was, in all probability, the grandson of Osmund Basset of Normandy, whose name appears, in 1050, as witness to an agreement respecting the abbey of St.Ebrulf, at Utica. The connection of the Bassets of Cornwall with the ancient family of Dunstanville is incorrectly slated in pedigrees apparently of the first authority, which represent them as descended from Thomas Basset and Alice Dunstanville. The fact is, that Thomas Basset, son of Gilbert, a younger son of the justiciary, and himself one of the justices of England (22 Henry III.), did marry Alice, daughter of Robert de Dunstanville, by whom he had three sons, Gilbert, Thomas, and Alan : Gilbert, the eldest, was founder of Bicester priory, in Oxfordssiire, and to him King Henry II. confirmed the manors of Shalefeld and Aldeford, in Surrey, as 1 The barony of Fortefcue devolved, according to the patent, to his brother Matthew, father of the present Earl Fortefcue. 1 1 having"], [103, "CORNWALL. Ixxvii having been the marriage-portion of his mother Alice Dunstanville u ; the sole heiress of this Gilbert married Verdun, and afterwards Camville, and the sole heiress of Cam ville, William de Longespee, Earl of Salisbury. Thomas, the second son of Thomas Basset, and Alice, above-mentioned, inherited part of the barony of Namptwich in Chessiire, and left three daughters coheiresses ; Sir Alan, the third son, possessed Compton in Oxfordssiire, by the gift, as some fay, of his uncle, Walter de Dunstan ville, or, according to Dugdale, of his elder brother Gilbert \", to whom it had been given by the said Walter. This Sir Alan, who died 17 Henry III., had a son and heir, Gilbert, who was ancestor of the Bassets of Wycombe, Bucks, (a baronial family,) whose sole heiress married Roger de Bigod, Earl of Norfolk. Having traced the posterity of Thomas Basset and Alice Dunstanville, to show that the Bassets of Cornwall are not descended from them, we have only to state briefly, that William Basset, Lord of Stoke- Basset and Ipsden, in Oxfordssiire, (son of John, son of Osmund, which Osmund lived in the reign of Richard I.% and was, as we suppose, a younger son of the justiciary) married Cecilia, daughter of Alan de Dunstanville y, with whom he is said to have had Menalida, in Cornwall, as a marriage-portion. Sir Alan, son of William Basset, had Whitechapel and Heyne in Devonssiire, as a marriage-portion with Lucy Peverell. Their chief Devonssiire seats were Umberlegh, and Heanton-Court, both of which came into the family with the heiress of Beaumont. From an early period, they resided also at Tehidy, in Cornwall, the mansion-house, probably, of the same estate which, at the time of the first William Basset's marriage, might have been called Menalida. William Basset had the royal licence to embattle his manor-house of Tehidy in Cornwall, in 1 330. About the middle of the sixteenth century, the family of Basset became divided into two branches ; the Devonssiire branch descended from John, elder son of Sir John Basset, by Honora Grenville, which branch became extinct, in the male line, by the death of Francis Basset, Esq., about the year 1796 ; and the Cornish branch descended from George, younger son of Sir John and Honora above-mentioned. Before the separation of the branches, this ancient family had married the heiresses of Balun, Walleis, Helligan1, Beaumont, and Budockside. Since that separation, the Cornissi branch has married the heiresses of Delbridge, Hele, and Pendarves, and coheiresses of Spencer and Prideaux.

Extincl Peers and Baronial Families. Carew, speaking of the several degrees of its inhabitants, fays, \" for noblemen, I may deliver in a word, that Cornwall, at this present (1602), enjoyeth the resi dence of none at all, the occasion whereof groweth partly, because their issue female have carried away the inhabitance, together with the inheritance, to gentle men of the eastern parts ; and partly for that their issue-male, little affecting so remote a corner, liked better to transplant their possessions to the heart of the realm.

The heiress of this opulent, and, as it appears, baronial family, married Tracy c, and, in her widowhood, conveyed Cardinan Castle and manor, in or about the year 1259, to Oliver de Dinan. It is probable that this Oliver was of the fame family with the Cardinans ; Leland seems to have been of that opinion, for, speaking of Robert de Cardinan as founder of Tywardreth priory, he calls him \" quidam ex Dinamiis ;\" we cannot find any thing in the writings of Sir William Dugdale or Sir William Pole, two very industrious genealogists, to support the conjecture, although the latter speaks very frequently of the Dinham family, and gives some account of the Cardinans, yet, from the similarity of the arms d, and other circumstances, it seems very probable '.

They had a castle in that town, and founded there a monastery, endowed, among other possessions, with lands in Devonssiire; in which county they were originally settled and had large estates. Oliver de Dinan of Cardinham, was summoned to parliament as a baron, from the year 1295 to 1298. The immediate descendant of Oliver, Sir John Dinham, was summoned to parliament in 1464, and, in 1485, was made, by King Henry VII., Treasurer of the Exchequer. He died in or about the year 1501, leaving no surviving issue. His sisters and coheirs married Sir Foulke Fitz- Warren ; John Lord Zouche, Sir Nicholas Carew, and Sir Thomas Arundell. A younger branch of this family, calling themselves Denham, con tinued the male line at Wdrtham, in Devonssiire, and were, for some time also, of Nancallan in Gorran. -The Dinhams married the heiresses of Hydon and De Arches, and a coheiress of the Lord Moells.

This family became extinct in the male line of its principal branch, in the reign of Richard II., when the heiress married Courtenay, Earl of Devonssiire.

Richard de Grenville, who married Isabel, daughter of Walter Giffard Earl of Buckingham, was common ancestor of the Grenvilles of Devonssiire and Cornwall, and the Grenvilles of Buckinghamssiire. The former were originally settled at Bideford, in Devonshire, and appear to have had a seat at Stowe, in the parissi of Kilkhampton, from a very early period. Sir Richard Grenville, the brave naval commander, who married the heiress of Beville, ap- pears, by the pedigrees, to have been the fifteenth in descent. His grandson was the celebrated Sir Beville Grenville, whose son, Sir John, was, in 1661, created Lord Grenville of Kilkhampton and Bideford, Viscount Grenville of Lansdowne, and Earl of Bath, with a warrant to use the foreign titles of Carboil, Thorigny, and Granville. This nobleman, and his descendants, wrote their name Granville. His younger son, John, was created, in 1702, Lord Granville of Potheridge, in Devonssiire, and died without issue, in 1709. Charles, his eldest son, who suc- ceeded him, was killed by the accidental discharge of a pistol before his father's funeral ; so that it was observed that there were three Earls of -Bath above ground at one time\". William Henry, son of Charles, became third Earl of Bath, but dying without issue in 171 1, the title became extinct. The last of the male line of this noble family was George Granville, the poet, who was created Lord Lansdowne in 171 1, and died in 1734, leaving issue only daughters. Dr. Borlase observes, that the family may be said, like the swan, to have sung most melodiously just before it expired1. The aunts and coheiresses of the last Earl of Bath married Sir William Leveson Gower, Bart., ancestor of the Marquis of Stafford, and Sir George Carteret, afterwards Lord Carteret, of Hawnes. The younger of the coheiresses was created Countess Granville. The sisters and coheiresses of her grandson, the second and last Earl Granville, married Thomas Viscount Weymouth, father of the present Marquis of Bath ; and the Earl of Shelbourne (after Marquis of Lansdowne), father of the present Marquis.

Dr.Borlase observes, nevertheless, (in his MS. heraldic notes), that the family of Grenfell, which had been long settled in the parish of St.Just, near the Land's-End, where the Grenvilles had a considerable estate, were, in all probability, of a younger branch of this family. In the more ancient parish registers, their name is spelt Grenfeld, as that of the Grenvilles frequently was at an early period ; and they appear to have used the fame arms. The representative of this family is Paseoe Grenfell, Esq., of Taplow, in Buckingham shire, M.P. for Great Marlow. 2 Arms"], [111, "CORNWALL. lxxxv Arms of Granville Earl of Bath : \u2014 Gules, three rests, Or.

Arundell, Lord Arundell, of Trerice in Newlyn. \u2014 The account of this family by Collins, as descended from a younger branch of the Arundells of Tol vern, who were a younger branch of the Lanherne family, is very erroneous. It is a doubtful point, whether they were at all connected with the Arundells of Lan herne ; we think it most probable that they were at a very early period, but have not been able to ascertain it. Both Tonkin and Dr. Borlase m assert the con trary, on the authority of a pedigree formerly at Trerice, which Dr.Borlase speaks of as having seen. He fays that it was drawn up from original documents at the Heralds' college, by which it appeared, that they were a distinct family, and that their ancient bearing was, Gules, a lion rampant Or. Tonkin fays, that this pedigree was drawn up by Camden himself. That learned writer does not mention the Arundells of Trerice in his Britannia. On inquiry at the Heralds' college, we cannot find that any thing is known there of the bearing before spoken of, or of the pedigree of this family, beyond the match with Trerice. The Lords Arundell of Trerice bore latterly, Sab. six swallows, three, two, one Argent, (the fame coat as Arundell of Lanherne,) quartered with the arms of the ancient baronial family of Lansladron (Sab. three chevronels Arg.). It seems probable, nevertheless, that the Arundells of Trerice, in the sixteenth cen tury, bore either the lion rampant or some other coat different from that of Arundell of Lanherne. Leland fays, that Arundell of Trerice gave no part of the arms of the great Arundells, and that he told him that he thought his family came from the Arundells of Normandy.

If so, it must have been Ralph the elder, who, in 1346, had an estate at Trekening, in St. Columb ; for this Ralph, in a record of 1351, is called the son of Oliver. We think it extremely probable, from the frequent recurrence of the family-names of Nicholas and John, that the Arundells of Trerice were descended from a younger son of Sir Nicholas Arundell, of Hempston- Arundell, in Devonssiire, the elder branch of which failed by the death of his son Sir John, in the reign of Henry III. ; and as the arms of the two families of the Arundells in Devonssiire (the one of Yewton- Arundell, and the other of Hempston-Arundell) differ only in colour (the coat of the latter being, Arg. six swallows, three, two, one, Sab.), there is every reason to suppose, although we do not find any pedigree setting forth the connection, that they were originally of the same stock. The immediate descendant of the Arundells of Trerice was created Lord Arundell of that place, in 1 664. The title and the family became extinct by the death of the fourth Lord Arundell, in 1773. The Arundells of Trerice married the heiresses of Trerice, Pollor, Durant, St.John of Pennark, Thurlebere, and Cofwarth, and the coheiress of Beville. The younger branches of Arundell of Trerice are treated of amongst the extinct families of the gentry.

Godolphin, Baron and Earl of Godolphin. \u2014 The pedigree of this noble house is involved in some obscurity. It appears pretty evident that an ancient family, who, from the barton of that name, were called De Godolghan, became extinct in the male line about the year 1400. The heiress married Rinsey, who took the name of Godolghan. Hals fays, that John Knava, who possessed Go dolphin, by marrying the heiress of Stevens, first assumed the name of Godolphin in the reign of Henry VII. ; but Carew, who lived so much nearer to the time, fays"], [113, "CORNWALL. lxxxvii says nothing of this, but observes, that the family had softened the name from Godolghan to Godolphin. It is certain that, from the reign of Henry VII., the name of Godolphin was continued uninterruptedly through six descents (the family being of much note in the county), to William Godolphin. Esq., who was created a baronet in 1661. This title became extinct at- his death, in 1710: his nephew, Sidney Godolphin (who became prime minister to King William and Queen Anne), was created, in 1684, Lord Godolphin of Rialton; and in 1706, Viscount Rialton and Earl of Godolphin. These titles became extinct in 1766; but Francis, the second Earl of Godolphin, having, in 1735, been created Lord Godolphin of Helston, with remainder to the heirs-male of Dr. Henry Godolphin, Dean of St. Paul's, Francis, the Dean's son, succeeded to that title, and, on his death without issue, in 1785, that title also, and the male line of the noble family of Godolphin, became extinct. The daughters and coheiresses of Francis, the second and last Earl of Godolphin, married the Dukes of Newcastle and Leeds. The elder branch of the Godolphins had married an heiress of the Killigrew family, the heiresses of Bonithon and Sydney, and coheiresses of Trenowth and Glynn.

A younger branch of the Godolphins settled at Trewarveneth p, in St.Paul's, about the reign of Henry VIII., and became extinct in 1689. The heiress of this branch married the ancestor of John Godolphin Nicholls. Esq., now of Trewarveneth. Another younger branch of the Godolphins, the first of which married one of the coheiresses of Gaverigan, settled at Treveneage, in St. Hilary, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and became extinct after two descents. The heiress of this branch married the ancestor of Sir John St.Aubyn, Bart. Pitt, Lord Camelford. \u2014 Thomas Pitt, Esq., Governor of Fort St. George, common ancestor of Pitt, Earl of Chatham ; Pitt, Earl of Londonderry in Ireland, and Pitt, Lord Camelford, purchased Boconnoc a few years after the death of the last Lord Mohun, and fixed his residence there.

Charles Berkeley, Lord Botetourt, was created Earl of Falmouth in 1664; the title became extinct, by his death without issue, the en suing year. The title of Viscount Falmouth was given to George Fitzroy when he was created Earl of Northumberland, in 1674; it became extinct in 1716. Viscount Launceston was one of the titles given to Frederic Prince of Wales, in 1726, as Viscount Trematon was one of those given the fame year to William Duke of Cumberland. When the Right Hon. Thomas Erssiine was created a peer on receiving the Great Seal, in 1806, he took the title of Baron Erssiine of Restormel Castle, in the county of Cornwall.

Trelawney of Trelawney in Pelynt. \u2014 This ancient family are supposed to be descended from Hamelin, who held Treloen, and several other manors, under the Earl of Moreton, when the survey of Domesday was taken. They derive their name from the manor of Trelawney, in Alternon, the ancient residence of the family, which is supposed to have passed intu other hands when the male line of the elder branch became extinct, on the death of Richard Trelawney, in the reign of Henry VI. This Richard was son of Sir John Trelawney, who signalized him- self in the wars with France under King Henry V., and had a grant of twenty pounds per annum for his eminent services, besides an honourable augmentation to his arms, which is the present bearing of the family.

His descendant, Sir Jonathan Trelawney of Pool, in Menheniot, which had then been for a considerable time the seat of the family, purchased (out of regard to the name) the manor of Trelawney, in Pelynt, in the year 1600. His son, John Trelawney, Esq., was created a baronet in 1628, and was immediate ancestor of the Rev. Sir Harry Trelawney, Bart., who is descended from a younger brother of the Right Rev.

On the death of Charles Trelawney, Esq., the last heir-male, this estate was inherited by the Darells of Trewornan, who took the name of Trelawney. The present infant possessor of Coldrinnick is representative of the Darells of Trewornan, and this branch of the Trelawneys. Vyvyan of Trelowarren, in Mawgan (Meneage). \u2014 This ancient family was originally of Trevidern in Burian, where they are traced, in their pedigree, some what earlier than the year 1300 ; they removed to Trelowarren about the begin ning of the reign of Edward IV., in consequence of a marriage with the heiress of Ferrers, of that place.

Crest: \u2014 A horse passant, furnissied, all proper. Most of the families, if not all, bearing the name of Vyvyan or Vivian, in Corn wall, were derived from the fame stock as the baronet's family. The name is spelt indiscriminately on ancient tombs of the nearest relations. Prior Vivian is supposed to have been a son of Robert, the second son of Richard Vyvyan, of Trelowarren, who married the heiress of Arundell. The Prior seems to have assumed a different coat of arms, which was confirmed to him by Wriothesley, Garter King of Arms : viz. Or, a chevron Az., charged with three annulets of the field, between as many lions' heads erased purple : on a chief Gules, three martlets, Argent. This coat was borne by the descendants of his brother John, who was of Bodmin, and had a son of the fame name, who married the heiress of Tregoofe of Penpol. Edward, second son of the last-mentioned John, left an only daughter and heir, married to Haweis. We have not been able to ascertain who is the representative of this branch. There are families of Vivian who bear the arms above-mentioned. The Vivians or Vyvyans of Trenowth appear to have been descended from a younger son of John Vyvyan of Trelowarren, who married the coheiress of Tre thurfe. John Vivian alias Trenowth died in 1 545 : his son married the heiress of Tresaster ; his grandson, the heiress of Lower of Truro ; his great grandson, a coheiress of Cavell. This branch became extinct r by the death of Francis Vivian, who married the heiress of Minard by the heiress of Cofwarth. The daughter and only child of this Francis married Sir Richard Vyvyan of Trelowarren, grandfather. of the present baronet. The Trenowth Vivians bore nearly the fame arms as Prior Vivian, indeed the fame coat without the annulets or the martlets. These arms were confirmed to Vyvyan of Trenowth by Sir John Borough, Garter King of Arms, in 1637.' Trevelyan. \u2014 Although the ancestor of Sir John Trevelyan was of Nettle combe, in Somersetssiire, when created a baronet in 1661, yet as he then possessed Trevelyan in St. Veep, the ancient seat of the family ' (which indeed is 'still their property), and in the early part of their history they were wholly Cornissi, it will be necessary to speak of them here. This ancient family were settled at Tre velyan at a very early period, and were afterwards, for several descents, of Basil in St.jCleather. In the reign of Edward IV., they removed into Somersetssiire, ' In the elder line, at least ; it is very probable that there are maie descendants from younger sens.

They acquired Clowance, in the latter part of the fourteenth century, by the marriage of Sir Geffrey St.Aubyn (son of Sir Guy, who had married one of the coheiresses of Serjeaux of Colquite) with the heiress of Kimiell, who had married the coheiress of Helligan of Clowance. Sir John St.Aubyn, the eighth in descent from Sir Geffrey, was created a baronet in 1671, and was great-great- grandfather of Sir John SuAubyn, the present baronet.

This conjecture is countenanced by the arms which, in a MS. history of the family, are said to have been given by that Prince to Ralph de Killigrew, the first of the family there mentioned. The Killigrews removed to Arwenick, near Falmouth -Harbour, on marrying the heiress of that house and name in the reign of Richard II.

Robert Killigrew, a younger son of this family, married the heiress of Woolston, in St. Ive ; one of the coheiresses of this branch brought the Trebigh estate to the Wreys. From a branch of this family, settled in Middlesex, sprung Thomas Killigrew, the celebrated wit of King Charles the Second's reign, Sir William Killigrew, Dr. Henry Killigrew, all dramatic writers, Mrs. Ann Killigrew the poetess, daughter of the latter, Admiral Killigrew, a celebrated naval officer in the reign of Wil liam III., and General Robert Killigrew, who died in 1707, and has a monument in Westminster Abbey.

It has been very justly remarked by Mr. Tonkin, that the names of most of the Cornissi gentry are local. Indeed there are scarcely any exceptions but those families which have removed from other counties into Cornwall. \" The Cornissi,\" fays Carew, \" entitle one another with his owne and his father's Christian name, and conclude with the place of his dwelling, as, John Thomas Pendarves ; Richard, his younger brother, is named Richard Thomas Pendarves, &c. Through which means, divers gentlemen, and others, have changed their names by removing their dwellings, as Trengove to Nance, Bonithon to Carclew ; two brethren of the Thomasses, the one to Carnsew, the other to Roscrowe, and many other.\" Tonkin fays, that the custom of assuming the names of their habitation, and changing on the next removal, was quite left off (1736), though he could instance some who had done so within a hundred years. The practice of families taking their names from the place of their abode 7, with the addition of de, was, at an early period, more or less prevalent throughout England. \" Most of the Cornissi names,\" fays Carew, \" begin with Tre, Pol, or Pen ; which signifie, a town, a top, and a head, whence grew the common bye-word :\u2014 By Tre, Pol, and Pen, You shall know the Cornish men.\" In Camden's Remains, this saying is thus amplified : \u2014 By Tre, Ros, Pol, Lan, Caer, and Pen, You may know most Cornish men. Tre is by far the most common beginning among the names of old Cornissi families derived from their habitations. Tre, in the Cornissi or Britissi language, signifies a town, village, or dwelling, as \u2014 Trevean \u2014 the Little \"1 Trevear \u2014 the Great Trewartha-the Higher \\ town' vilIaSe' or dwelling, Trewolla \u2014 the Lower Tre also signifies the numeral three, and this sense appears to have been adopt ed in the appropriation of family-arms \\ It would be entering into a very wide field, 7 It is a very prevalent, but a very mistaken notion, that families generally gave name to the places they inhabited. It is, on the contrary, a practice, which has very rarely, if ever, occurred, unless where the family-name has been given as an adjunct, as Newton-Ferrers, in Cornwall, and many others in various parts of the kingdom. It has in some few instances happened, that the ori ginal name has, in progress of time, been dropped, and the distinctive name only retained in general use, as in Buckinghamshire, Isenhampsted-Cheneys, and Isenhampsted-Latimers, formerly scats of the ancient families of Cheney and Latimer, are now called Cheneys and Latimers. * Either in allusion to the Cornish derivation, as three frogs in the arms of Tre-vroneck, three blackbirds in those of Tre-woof, three owls in those of Tre-wolla, and three stone pillars in those of"], [125, "CORNWALL.

It is probable that the two branches became again united on the extinction of the younger, Pendavy being described as the residence of that branch in 1620; which manor, together with Kestell, belonged afterwards to an elder branch. John Kestell, Esq., the present representative, whose grandmother was the heiress of Lower of Tremere in St.Tudy, has no son ; his only daughter is mar- ried"], [135, "CORNWALL.

Arms of Kingdon : \u2014 Arg. a chevron Sable, between three magpies, proper. Lanyon of Lanyon in Madron, and of Lanyon in Gwinnear. \u2014 The popular tradition of these families is, that they were descended from two brothers who came over from France with Isabel, consort of Richard II., and gave their names to the two bartons in which they fixed their residence ; and as a confirmation of this tradition, it is said, that their arms were the fame as those of the town of Lanion in Britanny. This tradition we know to be, in some respects, erroneous ; but contrary as it is to the general practice, we have reason to believe, that the tenement of Lanyon, within the barton of Coswin in Gwinnear, was so called by the family on its becoming their residence ; but so far from there being any truth in the story of the brothers being founders of the two families, it is certain that the Lanyons of Lanyon in Gwinnear are descended from Edward, a younger son of Richard Lanyon, who married Margaret Tressiillard. This Edward is called by Leland, Lanyon of Coswin. That this statement is correct, is proved by the circumstance of Lanyon of Madron and Lanyon of Gwinnear being, at the time of the visitation of 1620, related so nearly as in the degree of cousin-germans. The elder branch of the Lanyons of Madron is extinct, but some of the family, descended from younger branches, are still remaining at Burian. Mr. Tobias Lan yon, now of Camborne, surgeon and apothecary, is the representative of the Lanyons of Lanyon in Madron and Gwinnear.

The Prideauxes of Netherton in Devonssiire, baronets, are also descended from a younger branch of Prideaux of Thuborough.

Arundell of Lanherne. \u2014 The origin of this family is very incorrectly stated in the peerages, and with great confusion of erroneous dates ; nor have we been able to explain it very satisfactorily by any pedigrees to which we have had access. Some accounts make the founder of the Lanherne family marry the heiress of Lanherne, who had married the heiress of Pincerna; others make Arundell and Umphraville,"], [145, "CORNWALL. CXIX Umphraville marry coheiresses of Pincerna. None of the heraldic writers, who have treated of this family, seem to have been aware that they came from Yewton- Arundell in Devonssiire, which continued to be the property of the Arundells of Lanherne, till about the year 1 600. Sir William Pole tells us, that Ralph Arundell was of Yewton as early as the reign of King Stephen. The earliest intimation we have of the Arundells in Cornwall from public records is in 1 346, at which time it appears that John Arundell held the manors of Treloy and Trembleth. One of the Arundells (probably Sir Ralph, who was ssieriff of the county in 1 260) had long before this married the heiress of Trembleigh or Trembleth in St. Ervan, and this we believe was the origin of their settling in Cornwall. Nearly contemporary was Sir Renfrey Arundell, of whom we have intimation in a pedigree of the Roscarrocks, which Sir Renfrey is said to have married the heiress of Treffry (supposed of Treffry in Linkinhorne), and to have had a son, Lawrence Arundell ofBlayboll (probably Blable in St.Issey), whose daughter and heir married Ros- carrock. It appears that in 1346 John de Umphraville held Lanherne in right of Alice his wife, which Alice, no doubt, was the heiress either of Lanherne or Pin- cerna, for it appears to have been the fame family1. If the pedigree as given by Sir William Pole be correct (as in most particulars it appears to be, though we suspect that a link or two have been lost), it seems probable that John de Umphraville married the widow of Sir Renfrey, and thus held Lanherne jure uxorism. The name of John does not occur in Sir William Pole's pedigree, but it is certain that in 1346 he possessed Trembleth, the original Cornissi seat of the family, and that either he or his heirs soon afterwards became possessed of Lanherne, and removed thither their residence. From the Lanherne stock branched out the Arundells, who were of Tremoderet in Duloe in the fifteenth century ; those of Tolverne in Filleigh ; those of Trevithick in St.Columb; and those of Wardour-Castle in Wiltssiire. The ancestor of the last mentioned family, Sir Thomas Arundell, a younger son of Sir John Arundell of Lanherne, married Margaret, daughter and coheir of Lord Edward, and sister of Queen Catherine Howard. The Lanherne Arundells became extinct, in the year 1701, by the death of Sir John Arundell, who settled his estates on Richard Bealing, Esq., his daughter's son, on condition of his taking the name of Arundell. The sole heiress of this Richard was married, in 1739, to 1 Richard Pincerna had, in 1 154, a grant of the manor and hundred of Conarton ; his son assumed the name of Conarton, and his immediate posterity, removing to Lanherne, took their name from that barton. (See Mr. Bowles's \" Short Account of the Hundred of Penwith.\") \" Sir Renfrey, who married Alice Lanherne, is represented as great grandson of Ralph, who lived in the reign of King Stephen. Henry"], [146, "CORNWALL. CXX Henry Lord Arundell n, of Wardour, in consequence of which match the present Lord Arundell is representative of the elder as well as of one of the younger branches of Arundell of Lanherne.

Sir John Arundell of Lanherne, in the reign of Edward III., bore a lion passant between the swallows, as appears by his seal appendant to a deed of that date.

In or about the reign of Charles I., they removed to Trevarnoe and Truthall in Sithney, and were also of Methleigh in Breage, which was sold by John Arundell, Esq. in the early part of the last century. This John, who died in 1718, left a sole heiress married to William Jago, Esq., ances tor of Thomas Jago, Esq., of Launceston p. His younger brother continued the male line, and resided at Marazion. The last of this family, by whose death the name of the Lanherne Arundells expired in Cornwall, was Mr. John Arundell, who died in 1766, being the collector of the customs at the port of Falmouth: his sisters married St.Aubyn of Plymouth, Powell, and Robinson. The Arun dells, who were of Tremoderet in Duloe in the fifteenth century, were descended from Sir Renfrey, a younger son of Sir John Arundell of Lanherne (by the heiress of Lambourn), which Sir Renfrey married the heiress of Colessiill of Tremoderet. This family (of which was John Arundell, Bissiop of Exeter) became extinct after three descents, by the death of Sir Edmund Arundell. Some pedigrees represent Elizabeth, the aunt and only heir, as married to Whittington, and afterwards to Stradling : others, more correctly, represent two coheiresses married to Whitting ton and Stradling. Sir John St.Aubyn is descended from the Whittingtons. The Arundells of Trevithick in St.Columb, a younger branch of the Lan herne family, settled there in or about the reign of Edward VI., and became extinct about the year 1740. The heiress married Rawe of Endellion : Richard Rawe, Esq. is the representative of this branch of the Arundell family. 1 \" In his epitaph at Tilbury, in Wiltshire, it is said, \" Mariam Arundel, Lanherni\u00e6 in Cornubia stirpis, riobliffimam accepit conjugem ; inde filio ex ea suseepto. clarisfima h\u00e6c prosapia qu\u00e6 ultra duo s\u00e6cula fuerat divulsa, jam feliciter unita floret.\" 0 This family had married the heiress of a younger son of Archdekne.

CXXI A younger branch of the Arundells of Trevithick, was of Carvynick in St.Eno der. The sole heiress of this branch married a younger son of the Tanners of Comb in Brannell, from two of whose coheiresses are descended the Rev. Thomas Penwarne of St. Germans, and Richard Taunton, M.D., of Truro. A younger branch of the Arundells descended from Thomas, a younger son of Sir John Arundell, and Anne Moyle, settled at Clifton in Landulph, about the year 1500, and became extinct about 1620. The coheiresses married Killigrew and Lower. John Arundell of Trerice, who lived in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, had, by his first wife, the heiress of Cofwarth, four daughters, married to Carew of Anthony, Somaster, Cofwarth, and Dinham. Thomas, a younger brother of John Arundell, the brave defender of Penden nis Castle, settled at Tremoderet in Duloe (which, at a former period, had been the seat of a younger branch of the Lanherne Arundells), in the reign of Charles I. This branch of the Arundells became extinct in the early part of the last century. Tonkin fays, that a younger branch of the Arundells of Trerice was settled for some time at Trerice in St. Allen. The son of Sir John Arundell of Trerice, by the coheiress of Beville, settled at Gwarnick : this branch soon became extinct, by the death of John Arundell, Esq., commonly called Black Arundell, in 1597. The Arundells of Menadarva in Camborne were descended from a younger son of Sir John Arundell of Trerice, who died in the early part of the seventeenth cen- tury. It has been supposed that this was an illegitimate branch, but it is most probable, that the tradition on this subject have arisen from the expression of natural son, applied to the first owner of this estate, in his father's will ; but as it is well known, and now generally admitted, that the expression of natural son was at that time never used in the acceptation it now bears, it is, in fact, a proof of the contrary. The immediate descendant of this branch, and the only Arundell remaining in Cornwall, in the male line, is William Harris, Esq., of Pem- broke-College in Oxford, whose grandfather, William Arundell, Esq., took the name of Harris on succeeding to the Kenegie estate, as before-mentioned. John, a younger son of William Arundell (grandfather of the present William Harris), retained the name of Arundell, and left male issue, who reside in Devonssiire. It is probable that the Arundells of Trevelver in St. Minver, extinct in the latter part of the last century, were descended from a younger branch of the Menadarva family.

After treating of the Cornish families, Dr. Borlase, in one of his manuscripts, observes : \u2014 \" It is a melancholy reflection to look back on so many great families * as have formerly adorned the county of Cornwall, and are now no more ; the Grenvilles, the Arundells, Carminows, Champernons, Bodrugans, Mohuns, Kille grews, Bevilles, Trevanions, which had great sway and possessions in these parts. The most lasting families have only their seasons, more or less, of a certain consti tutional strength. They have their spring, and summer-sunshine glare, their wane, decline, and death ; they flourish and shine perhaps for ages ; at last they sicken ; their light grows pale, and, at a crisis when the off-sets are withered and the old stock is blasted, the whole tribe disappears, and leaves the world as they have done Cornwall. There are limits ordained to every thing under the fun : Man will not abide in honour. Of all human vanities, family-pride is one of the weakest. Reader, go thy way ; secure thy name in the book of life, where the page fades not, nor the title alters nor expires ; \u2014 leave the rest to Heralds and the Parish- Register.\" 1 In Norden's time there were twelve feats of the Arundells in Cornwall. The name, we be lieve, is now quite extinct in the county. (See p. lxxxvi. and cxix, cxxi.) Of the Carminows, who were almost equally numerous, there has not been a male left, for more than a century. Of the Trevanions, who had five feats in Cornwall in Norden's time, J. B. P.

Tonkin speaks of the last-mentioned, which has been wholly taken down more than forty years ago, as having had a magnificent Gothic hall. Among those which remain, either wholly or in part, in a dilapidated state, and for the most part occupied as farm-houses, are, Rialton, formerly a seat of the Priors of Bodmin, afterwards of the Mundays ; Golden, of the Tregians; Clifton, of a branch of the Arundells; Halwyn, of the Champernowns; Crocadon, of the Trevisas, and afterwards (till within a few years) of the Corytons ; Pengerfick, of the Millitons ; Bochym, of the Bcchyms and Bellots : Benhellack, of the Gerveys family; Shilling ham, of the Bullers ; Trecarrreil, of the Trecarrells ; Trevedoc, of the Beres; Poole, of the Trelawneys (now the parish-workhouse of Menheniot) ; Tresunger, of the 10 Vyvyans"], [205, "CORNWALL. clxxix Vyvyans and Matthews ; Treworgan, of the Trencreeks and Polwheles ; Pen hele, of the Grenvilles and Speccots ; and Nanswidden, a more modern mansion, reduced by fire to a shell, the seat of the Hoblyns. Deer-Parks. Among the most ancient deer-parks in the county, were the duchy parks of Launceston, Hellesbury; Lantegloss, in the hundred of Lesnewth ; Carybullock, Liskeard, and Restormel : Trelawney-Park, belonging to the family of that name, in the hundred of Lesnewth ; Pawton, the Bishop of Exeter's park, in the nun* dred of Pyder ; Bodrugan-Park, belonging to the family of that name, in the hundred of Powder ; and Lanfladron-Park, in the fame hundred, belonging to the Arundells, which, as Norden fays, was \" the most stateliest park in the shire.\" \" Cornwall was stored, not long since,\" fays Carew (1602.) \" with many parks of fallow deere, but King Henrie the Eight being persuaded (it is said by Sir Richard Pollard) that those belonging to the Duke could steed him with little pleasure in so remote a part, and would yield him good profit if they were leased out on an improved rent, did condiscend to their disparking ; so foure of them tooke a fall together, to wit, Carrybullock, Liskerd, Restormell, and Lanteglos. Howbeit this good husbandry came short of the deviser's promise and the King's expectations, wherethrough the one was slient for the attempt, the other discon- tented with the effect. Notwithstanding, as Princes' examples are ever taken for warrantable precedents to the subject, so most of the Cornish gentle- men, preferring gain to delight, shortly after followed the like practice, and made their deere leap over the pale to give the bullocks place. Parkes yet remaining are, in East hundred, Poole, Sir Jonathan Trelawney's, newly revived ; Halton, M. Rouses, lately impaled ; and Newton, Mr. Corington's, almost decayed. In West hundred, Boconnock, Sir Reginald Mohun's. In Powder hundred, Carhayes, Mr. Trevanion's. In Stratton, Launcels, Mr. dia- mond's. In Kirrier hundred, Mr. Vivian's, and Merther, Mr. Reskymer's.\" Norden describes Mr. Trevanion's park as being at Trevanion, the ancient resi dence of the family, not at Carhayes. His map describes a park at Mr. Edg cumbe's at Cothele, but it is not mentioned in his Survey. Mr. Tonkin, writing about the year 1730, fays, that the parks at Poole, Lawncels, Halton, Trelowarren, 1 In the extent of the Duchy of Cornwall, 1 1 Edw. III., Launceston park is described as con taining, in circuit, one league, and having then in it fifteen deer, but capable of sustaining forty. In Restormel park were 300 deer : in Liskeard park, 200 : in the park of Kerybollok (containing, in circuit, three leagues), 150 deer ; and in Trematon park, on the north side of tke Castle, forty-tw\u00bb deer. z 2 and"], [206, "CORNWALL. clxxx and Merther, had been disparked ; the deer-parks then in the county were, in the hundred of East, Bradrige, Mr. Coster's ; and Newton, Sir Joseph Cory ton's. In the hundred of West, Boconnoc, Mr. Pitt's; and Pinchley, Lord Radnor's. In the hundred of Powder, Carhayes, Mr.Trevanion's; and Tregothnan, Lord Falmouth's. In the hundred of Pyder, Lanhidrock, Lord Radnor's; and Trevaunance, Mr.Ton kin's ; Treluddra in this hundred, although a park by royal patent, as Mr.Ton kin observes, had been disparked. In Kirrier hundred, Godolphin, Lord Godol phin's; and Tremogh, Mr. Worth's (then lately imparked). Of these parks Mr. Tonkin observes, Godolphin, Carhayes, and Boconnock, were most esteemed for their venison. Of the parks enumerated by Mr. Tonkin, there remained, about the year 1760, as Dr. Borlase observes in his MS. notes on Carew, Godolphin, Tregothnan, Lan- hidrock, Pinchley, Boconnoc, and Carhayes. In addition to these, he mentions, Pencarrow, Sir John Molesworth's; Tehidy, Mr. Bassett's; Trevethow, Mr.Praed's; and Werrington, a great part of which is in Cornwall, Mr. Morice's. Since Bor- lase's time, the parks of Lanhidrock, Pinchley, Pencarrow, Tehidy, and Treve- thow, have been disparked. Trenant, late Sir John Morshead's, in the hundred of Kirrier, has been impaled and since disparked. There are now in the hundred of East, the parks of Werrington and Mount-Edgcumbe, a great part of both being in the county of Cornwall. In the hundred of West, Boconnoc, now Lord Gren- ville's. In the hundred of Powder, Tregothnan, Lord Falmouth's ; Carhayes, Mr.Trevannion's ; Penrice, Mr. Grave's ;\u2022 and a paddock of Sir Christopher Haw- kins's at Trewithen. In the hundred of Pyder, a small park at Padstow, Mr. Pri- deaux Brune's. In the hundred of Kirrier, Godolphin, now belonging to the Duke of Leeds ; Carclew, Sir William Lemon's ; and a small paddock belonging to Mr. Rogers, at Penrose. \" Red deere this shire breedeth none,\" says Carew, \" but only receiveth such as in the summer-season range thither out of Devon : to whom the gentlemen bordering on their haunts afford so coarse entertainment, that without better pleading their heeles, they are faire to deliver up their carcases for a pledge to answer their trespasses.\" Norden mentions the hundreds of East and Stratton as the only parts of the county where they were found straggling as estrays from Dartmoor and other parts of Devonshire. In King John's time, as he observes, the whole county was a forest, and he disforested it. Borlase says, that red deer were found also sometimes on the downs about Bodmin, but more fre- quently in the north of the county, between Launceston and Stratton. They are said to be found occasionally in the neighbourhood of Bodmin, and more frequently in the north-east part of the county. In the north-west of Devon, on the borders of Exmoor forest, they are more abundant. 1 1 Geogba-"], [207, "CORNWALL. clxxxi Geographical and Geological Description of the County. Boundaries, Extent, &c. \u2014 The county of Cornwall, which is supposed to have taken its name from its resemblance to a horn, is surrounded by the sea, except on the east, where it is bounded by Devonshire, from which county it is sepa rated, except for the space of a few miles, by the river Tamar. Its length, from the extremity of the parish of Morwinstow to the Land's-end, is seventy-eight miles and a half: its width at the eastern extremity of the county, measuring from the northern point of Morwinstow to Rame-head, is forty-three miles and a quarter. At about a third of its length, measuring from Fowey to Padstow, it is only eighteen miles wide ; and at the end of about another third part, measur ing from Pendennis castle to Portreath, on the northern coast, only thirteen. From St. Ives to Mount's-bay, the distance is only five miles. This county contains, according to Martyn's measurement, 758,484 statute acres : it has been calculated, that of this quantity, nearly a fourth part, \" from i5o,oooto2oo,oooacres, consists of uninclosed waste lands, which are appropriated to no other use than a scanty pasturage for a miserable breed of sheep and goats throughout the year ; and about 1 0,000 acres, to the summer pasture of cattle and sheep. The principal and most profitable tract of these waste lands extends from south to north, between the towns of Liskeard, Bodmin, and Camelford, and thence to within a few miles of Launceston ; particularly those called Roughtor, Temple, and Alternon moors.\"\" Much of the dreary waste land in the mining district has been greatly improved in appearance and value by the good policy of the landholders, who have granted leases to the labouring miners, for ninety-nine years determinable on three lives, of portions of the waste land, each consisting of three acres, at an annual rent of ten shillings, on condition of building a cottage and cultivating the land. This practice tends much to the general benefit of the community by the eventual improvement of estates, and is the source of considerable advantage and comfort to the miners, whilst it affords them a profitable employment for their spare hours. Among the most considerable inclosures of waste lands by individuals, mentioned in the Agricultural Survey of this county, are those of Charles Rashleigh, Esq., of Duporth, and E. J. Glynn Esq. Lord Grenville has lately obtained an act for the inclosure of a very great extent of waste lands in the neighbourhood of Boconnoc. a Worgan's Agricultural Survey, from the information of Mr. Wallis, Secretary to the Agri cultural Society of Cornwall. Soils"], [208, "clxxxii CORNWALL. Soils and Strata. \u2014 The soils of this county are various, the principal of them are the black growan or gravelly; the Jhelfy or Jlaty, and loam differing in colour, texture, and degrees of fertility. The first prevails on all the higher grounds, and occupies a considerable part of the area of Cornwall, the substratum being granite, frequently in a decomposed state. This soil is not so generally fertile as the others, but is particularly well suited to the culture of potatoes : and in some parts of the county, where the growan is mixt with a large proportion of loam, the land is remarkably pioductive. The fhelfy or slaty soil takes its name from the rock of schistus or soft slate on which it lies, and of which, with a mixture of light loam, it consists. There are three large and very fertile districts in which this soil prevails, on the banks of the Alan, the Fowey, and the Fal. The loamy or alluvial soils, of various descriptions, more or less mixed with clay, which is their substratum, are very rich and fertile ; they occur in many parts of the county, m the valleys, and on the banks of rivers b. There are other soils in Cornwall which derive their specific characters from the strata which lie beneath them, and from the decomposition of which they have originated ; such are the elvan or porphyritic, and the ire-stone or horn-blend soils, both of which are very fertile ; but they occur only, in small narrow districts, and occupy a small portion of the surface of the country. The serpentine soil, or that which covers the serpentine rock on Goonhilly downs, is distinguished by the production of that remarkable plant, the erica vagans, which is peculiar to it in this country. Some of the high grounds on the north coast are covered, to the depth of many feet, with sea-sand. This sand, which is composed of very minute fragments of sea-shells, or coral, appears to have been deposited by the spray of the sea, at a remote period. The substratum which prevails in the greater part of the county is that species of stratified rock, which is usually called argillaceous slate or schijlus, but is known in the mining district of Cornwall by the name of killas ; this, varying in substance and in colour, is found in every part of Cornwall, with the exception of those spaces which are occupied by the granite or moor-stone, the serpentine, and a few others of small extent. Of the granite there are four considerable districts : the first nearly bounded by the church-towns of North-hill, St.Neots, Blisland, St.Breward, and St. Clether ; the second by those of Lanlivery, Roche, St. Dennis, St. Stephens, St. Austell, and St. Blazey ; the third by those of Constantine, Crowan, Redruth, and Stithians ; the fourth occupying the western extremity of the county from St. Paul and Zennor to the Land's'-end; and four small spots, one of them between Calstock and Callington; another east of Redruth; a third west of Breage; and * Worgan's Survey.

In the southern part of the district of Meneage, the sub stratum is serpentine, except a small portion of green-stone, being a species of trap, in the parish of St.Kevern. There are also three narrow strips of what is called ire-stone or iron-stone, two of them bounding the granite of the Land's end to the eastward and westward, the third bounding the granite in the neigh bourhood of Redruth to the north-west. Some thin beds of lime-stone occur alternately with the slate near Padstow, and in the parishes of Carantoc, and Lower St.Columb; and there are some insulated stratifications of lime-stone between Liskeard and the Tamar. Strata of clay of various colours are also found in several parts of Cornwall. Surface and Scenery. \u2014 The high grounds of Cornwall, through which chiefly the great roads pass, present in general so dreary a prospect, as to impress travellers with a more unfavourable idea of this county than it deserves ; for there is a great deal of beautiful scenery near the southern coast, particularly at East and West Looe, Fowey, and Polperro, and on the banks of the Lynber, near Trematon Castle and Nottar-bridge. The bay of Falmouth, and Mount's-bay, are ex ceeded in beauty by none in this island. Many of the valleys are well wooded ; particularly in the south-east part of the county0, and the neighbourhood of Lost withiel and Bodmin; and there are extensive plantations at Tregothnan, Clowance, Tehidy, Port-Eliot, Carclew, &c* Cornwall has also its share of the beautiful scenery on the banks of the Tamar, in the neighbourhood of Calstock, Cothele, Pentilly, and many other places. The surface of this county, in many parts of the mining district, has been greatly disfigured, particularly by the stream-works of successive ages. Cuiclaze tin mine, nevertheless, one of the ancient open-works, affords some picturesque scenes, a view of one of which is annexed. Some of the most remarkable and interesting scenery in Cornwall is that which occurs along a line of bold and abrupt coast, bounded by the Atlantic Ocean and c Much of the wood in Cornwall had been consumed for fuel in the smelting of tin, before the introduction of pit-coal for that purpose, and used for the underground timbers of the mines. a Mr. Worgan, in his Agricultural Survey, observes, \" that most of the proprietors of lands in this county are directing their attention to planting, so that in thirty or forty years, Cornwall will present extensive wood-land scenery, both useful and ornamented.\" Some of the principal planters of the present day, are Lord de Dunstanville, Sir John St. Aubyn, Sir William Lemon, Mr. Charles Rashleigh, Lord Grenville, Mr. Vyvyan, and Mr. Thomas of Chiverton. The late Lord Falmouth also planted very extensively. Besides the more common forts of forest trees, great quantities of the pinaster fir, (which was first introduced in this county by H.M. Praed, Esq., about the year 175c,) have been slanted generally on the south-west side of other plantations, for the purpose of shelter. the"], [214, "CORNWALL. clxxxiv the Bristol Channel ; where, amidst a great variety of striking objects may be enumerated, the magnificent groups of granite rocks at the Land's-end, Cape Cornwall, and Castle-Treryn ; the rocks of schistus at Tintagel, and the stupendous rock near Basset's Cove, with a very lofty perforation called Tabbin's Hole. The rocks of serpentine at Kynans Cove, near the Lizard Point, exhibit a great variety of picturesque forms. The inland parts of the county also present some remarkable objects in the rude masses of granite, in various fantastical forms, which appear above the surface, on the moors ; many of which have been supposed in a great measure to have received their present form or situation from art ; though they may be referred to natural causes, and considered as the insulated remains of stratified beds of granite-rock, which, in consequence perhaps of some inequality in their original mixture, have unequally resisted the corrosive influence of the atmosphere. The most remarkable of these are the Cheese- Wring or Wring-Cheese, a large mass of granite rock, thirty-two feet high, consisting of several layers of large dimensions, poised on others so small as to excite surprise that it ssiould have stood for so many ages; the great stone in the tenement of Men, in the parissi of Constantine, thirty-three feet long, and 14 feet 6 inches high, of an oval form, placed on the points of two other stones, with a passage under it of about three feet wide* ; and the two logan or rocking-stones, being large masses of granite so nicely poised that they may be easily moved, one of them in she parissi of St. Just f, the other on the summit of the lofty rocks of granite called Castle-Treryn. There was a third in the parissi of Sithney, called Men-amber, which is said to have been thrown off its poise in the time of the rebellion, by order of the governor of Pendennis Castle8. To these may be added the Kairns, and remarkable stones on Carnbre hill, which have been so often described, and termed Druidical, though their present ap pearance may be reasonably referred to natural causes, and attributed to the operation of timeh. Most of these granite rocks have on their surface round hol lows or basins ; these too have been considered, by several writers on the sub ject, as relicks of Druidifm, though Dr. Stukeley, who was one of the first that referred all the rude monuments of the early ages to the Druids, did not go so far as to suppose the rock-basins to have been produced by them, or even by e Figured in the antiquities of Cornwall by Dr. Borlase, (p. 174), who says that every stone of this kind is called in Cornwall and Scilly tolmen, i. e. the hole of stone. 1 \" In the large heap of rocks called Bofworlas Lehau.\" (Borlafe's Antiquities, p.180.) s Ibid. 181. \" See Dr.Berger's paper on the physical stru' are of Devonshire and Cornwall, in the Transactions of the Geological Soeiety, Vol.1. 154. art ;"], [215, ""], [216, ""], [217, "Strand \u25a0"], [218, ""], [219, ""], [220, "Cape Cornwall, wit I"], [221, "Lands bm"], [222, ""], [223, "A ynans Cove."], [224, ""], [225, "fuiUsluJ M.tt-Jt im%i >\\- T- iTuldl & WmDMitu, Smmd. .

Rivers. \u2014 The principal rivers of this county are the Tamar, the Lyner, the Tide or Tidi, the Seaton, the Looe, the Fawy, the Fal ; the Hel or Heyl in Kirrier, the river of the fame name in Penwith, and the Alan or Camel. The Tamar rises in the parish of Morwinstow, about three miles from the north sea : passing near Whitstone, about ten miles from its source, it reaches Tamerton which takes its name from this river ; at the corner of the parish of St. Stephen it 1 In a letter from Dr. Stukeley to Smart Letheuillier, Esq.

In the parilh of Stoke-Clims land, the Tamar has a high, strong stone-bridge, called by Leland, Hawtebrig or High-bridge, now commonly Horse-bridge : the last bridge on this river is in the parish of Calstock, begun, according to Leland, by Sir Piers Edgcombe. Five miles further down, the Tamar receives the Tavy on the east, and having made a creek into the parishes of Botesfleming and Landulph on the west, becomes a spacious harbour ; and after passing near the ancient borough of Saltash, is joined by the Lynher creek and river ; a little further to the south it forms the noble harbour of Hamoaze, formerly called Tamarworth : having made two large creeks, one called St. John's, the other Milbrook, on the west, and Stonehouse creek on the east, (after a course of about forty miles nearly south.) the Tamar falls into the sea, having Mount-Edgcumbe for its western, and the lands of Stonehouse and St. Ni cholas island, in Plymouth sound, for its eastern boundary. The river Lynher or Lyner rises in Alterton parish, about eight miles west of Launceston, andin its course, south- south-east, passes through theparifhes of Northill, Linkinhorne, and Southill, near Callington, through the park at Newton-Ferrers, by Pillaton and Lanrake, to Noddetor or Notter bridge, where it becomes navi gable, and spreads into what is called Lynher creek ; four miles further, continuing its course between St. Stephen's on the one side, and the parishes of Sheviock and Anthony on the other, it joins the Tamar, after a course of about 24 miles. The river Tide or Tidi rises on the south side of Carraton-hill, near Lilkeard, and, dividing the parishes of Quithiock and Menheniot, enters that of St. Germans, near Molinec ; about two miles below it becomes navigable, at a place called Tidiford ; two miles beyond which it passes the town of St. Germans ; beyond this town it is called St. Germans creek, which being joined by Lynher creek, the two rivers pro ceed together and form a junction with the Tamar. The river Seaton rises in St. Cleer, about four miles to the north-east of Lilkeard, and passing within a mile of that town to a place called from ifrLanseaton, runs through the parish of Menheniot, and dividing St. Germans on the east from Mor val and St. Martins, falls into the sea after a course of twelve miles. The East-Looe river rises also in the parish of St. Cleer, and having passed under Lilkeard park, divides the parishes of St. Keyne and Morval from those of Lilkeard and Duloe ; at Sand-place it becomes navigable, and three miles from thence empties itself into the sea, after a course of ten miles, between East and West Looe. The West-Looe river rises in the parish of St. Pinnock, and passing between Lan- 1 1 reath"], [243, "COR N.W ALL. clxxxvh* reath and Duloe, becomes navigable at Trelawn-wear ; a mile beyond which it joins the East-Looe river. The Fawy rises in the parish of Alternon, at a place called Fawy-well, not far from Brownwilly, one of the highest hills in Cornwall. Passing between St.Neots (in which parissi three bartons take their names from this river) and St. Cleer before it arrives at Resprin bridge, in the parish of Lanhydrock, it receives some smaller streams from St.Neots, Warlegon and Cardinham ; three miles beyond this bridge it reaches Lostwithiel, to which town it is navigable at high water for small vessels. About three miles further, having in the midway received the water of Pelyn brook from the west, passing between St. Sampson's and Tywardreth on the west and St. Winnow on the east, it joins Leryn creek and river (which rises between Broadoak and Lanhydrock) ; here it becomes a wide and deep haven: two miles further it reaches the town of Fowey, and being joined a little below by Polruan creek, falls into the sea after a course of twenty-six miles. The Fal rises at a place called Fonton-Val, about two miles west of Roche hills. Passing near St. Dennis and St. Stephens, it becomes a considerable stream before it reaches Grampound bridge ; about a mile below which it was formerly navigable for small-craft. Passing near Creed, in about three miles further it reaches the town of Tregony. An act of Parliament was passed in the year 1677, f\u00b0r mak- ing the Fal navigable; but it is said to have been abandoned when it had been completed nearly as far as Grampound : a mile below Tregony the waters begin to spread, and form Lamorran creek, having the parishes of Lamorran and St.Michael- Penkevil on the north, and Filleigh and Ruan-Lanihorn on the south : at the distance of three miles from Tregony it joins Maples or Mopas-Road (a body of water formed by the junction of Truro creek and St. Clement's creek): Leland mentions a naval fight which had then lately happened (in the reign of Henry VIII.) in this road, between a ssiip of war of Dieppe, and a fleet of eighteen Spanish mer- chantmen ; the Frenchmen, it seems, had been chaced thither by the Spaniards. Truro creek is supplied by several streams, particularly the rivers of Kenwyn and St. Allen, which, rising in theparissies of those names, meet at the town of Truro, to which the creek is navigable at high tide for ships of small burden \\ St. Clement's creek, supplied by some streams which rise a little to the north of Ladock, is navi gable for barges as far as Tresilian bridge. After the junction of Mopas-Road and Lamorran creek, the Fal, after a further course of two miles, having the village and parish of Feock on the west, reaches Falmouth harbour.

On the west side of it are three creeks, Rest ronguet, Milor, and King's-Road; on the east, St.Just and St.Mauditsor St.Mawes. Restronguet creek is formed by the Tretheag river, which rises between Stithians and Gwennap, the Chase-water, which rises to the north-east of St.Dye, and some other brooks ; the small creek of Milor (so called from the village of that name) is sup plied by a brook which rises near Enys : the great creek or harbour of King's- Road extends from Falmouth to Penryn, two miles in length, and is navigable for ships of 1 oo tons burden. At the foot of Falmouth harbour the Fal opens into the ocean, between Pendennis Castle on the western bank, and St.Mawes and Anthony-Point on the east, its channel being nearly a mile wide : near the middle is a large rock, concealed at high water, on the highest part of which, to obviate its dangers, the heirs of Killigrew, formerly Lords of Arwennack, are obliged to keep a tall pole fixed. The river Hel or Heyl, in Kirrier, rises on the hills of Wendron parissi, near Penhal-Guy, about three miles\" above Gweek, to which place barges come up at high tide ; a mile further down the Hel is joined by Mawgan creek on the south ; and three miles further by Kestel or Helford creek ; and at its mouth, three miles further, by Gillan creek, formed by the small river Durra, which rises between Manaccan and St.Keverne; on the north it has first Polpenwith or Polperre, and Polwhevrell creeks, running up towards Constantine church ; and a mile further down Chiclow or Calamansack creek. Helford haven, within a mile, of its mouth, is secure for ssiips of 200 tons, and at its passage into the sea is about a mile wide. The river Lo or Low, in Kirrier, rises in the northern part of Wendron parissi, about five miles above Helston ; about a mile below which it forms the lake called Lo-pool. The river Heyl or Hayle, in Penwith, is formed by the junction of four brooks, which unite at Relubbas, three miles from St.Erth bridge, where the land of Cornwall is at its narrowest dimensions, the distance being only three miles from the full sea-mark of the Heyl on the north sea, to the full sea-mark at Marazion on the south sea. From St.Erth the Heyl bears directly north, and near its mouth is joined by a brook from the east, which, under the village of Phillack makes a branch of this haven, for ssiips of 100 tons : small ships only go up to the village of Lelant, on account of the fandsr which have not only choaked up the 5 harbour,"], [245, "CORNWALL. clxxxix harbour, but formed a bar, which causes it to be only a half-tide haven, the tide ebbing and flowing only half of its customary time. The river Conner, which gives name to the ancient manor and barton of Connarton, rises to the north-east of Crowan, passes near Camborne, and being joined by a stream from the neighbourhood of Tehidy, falls into the sea a little beyond Gwithian. Ganal creek, which falls into the north sea near Crantock, is supplied by a stream which rises in the parissi of Newlyn, near Trerice. The river Alan or Camel rises about two miles north of the town of Camelford: after a course of about twelve miles, passing by Advent, between Michaelstow and Breward, near Blisland and Helland, it becomes navigable for sand-barges at Par brook, and near Eglossiayle is joined by the Laine, which, rising a little to the north of Lantegloss, passes near St.Teath and St.Mabyn: a mile further down, the Camel reaches the ancient bridge called Wadebridge, whither barges of sixty tons come up ; a little further the river forms two small creeks on the east ; and still further, two on the west, running up to St.Issey and Little Petherick : in a mile more it reaches the ancient town of Padstow, where it is a mile wide ; but the navigation is much impeded by the sands. The mouth of the harbour is about two miles below the town. Further to the north there is no Considerable river, but there are the creeks of Portisic or Port-Isaac, Bottreaux-castle, and Bude-haven. The mouths of all the tide-rivers on the north side of Cornwall have been nearly choaked with sand thrown up by the surge, or drifted in by the north-westerly winds. Lakes. \u2014 The most considerable lake in this county is the Lo-Pool, between the parissi of Sithney on.the west, and those of Helston and Mawgan on the east. It is about two miles long, and a furlong wide, being formed by a bar of pebbles, sand and ssiingles, forced up against the mouth of the creek by the south-west winds. Towards the west it makes a little creek, stretching up to Penrose ; and to the east another called Carminow creek, half a mise in length, and about half a furlong wide. These are the dimensions of the Lo-Pool in the summer ; the superfluous water draining through the bar into the sea ; but in the winter the whole valley is frequently overspread with water, from the town of Helston to the sea. ' About twenty years ago, a jette was laid at the mouth of the harbour, and a back-water-dam across Phillack creek, since which, by the flow but united operation of these two works, the harbour has been much scoured, and a strait channel formed across the bar, which has greatly improved the navigation. This has been executed at the expence of the Heyle Copper Company, who are proprie tors of most of the lands contiguous to Phillack creek. When"], [246, "CORNWALL. CCXC When the town-mills at St. John's bridge have their wheels stopped by the swelling of the lake, the mayor of Helston applies to the Lord of Penrose ; and, on presenting him with a few half-pence in a leathern purse, has a right to cut through the bar, and make a passage for the water. So long ago as the reign of Henry VIII. it was observed by Leland, that \" if this bar might be always kept open, it would be a goodly haven up to Helston.\" This lake abounds with a peculiar and excellent trout, called the Lo-trout. There isa small pool or lake of the same kind between the parissi of Budock and that of Falmouth, separated from the sea by a bar of sand and ssiingles, formerly called Le-vine-pool, now Swan-pool. It is somewhat less than half a mile in length, atid a quarter of a mile in width. The eels of this water are esteemed par ticularly good. The only inland lake in this county is called Dosmery-pool, in the parissi of Alternon, near the borders of St. Clere's parissi, formed from a junction of the waters of the neighbouring hills. It is about a mile in circumference, and Leland describes it as fifteen fathom deep ; but Mr. Carew fays that, upon trial, no part of it was found deeper than nine feet, and no fissi in it but eels. Navigable Canals. \u2014 An act of Parliament was passed in 1796, for making a navigable canal (to be called the Polbrook canal) from Guinea-port, near Wade bridge, to Dunmeer-bridge, in the parissi of Bodmin, and also a collateral cut to or near Ruthern-bridge in the fame parissi : it was proposed to have continued a com munication to Lostwithiel, but it was found necessary to have a tunnel, and the undertakers were discouraged from proceeding by the great expence with which it would have been attended. Mr. Rennie was the engineer. Dr. Borlase, in his Natural History, recommends making the Tamar navigable to Launceston, and uniting the Fawy and the Alan from Dunmeer-bridge to Resprin bridge. \" The advantages of such an union,\" says he, \" are too obvious to be particularized, and the difficulties too few to discourage the undertaking, whenever a public spirit for making rivers navigable shall arise in this nation. It is, indeed, to be wissied, that as the eyes of all begin to see the advantage of good roads for trade and travellers, so they may in time awake and perceive the greater, at least equal, advantage of improving the water-carriage of this nation.\" In the reign of Charles I. a bill was brought in and passed the Commons, for making all the rivers in Cornwall navigable. It was brought into the House of Lords, and declared to be a noble design, which might give a pattern for all England to follow; but it being at the close of a session, the bill did not go through its stages, and the civil war soon afterwards ensuing, put an end to the design.

The road from Stratton to Camelford passes near Davidstow, where it joins the turnpike-road from Launceston to Camelford, about three miles from the latter town. This road passes through the villages of Trelkinnick-crose (yulgo Skinney-cross) andWainhouse corner, over the high ground called Touchbarrows, leaving the village of Bude and the church-town of Poundstock to the right, and the church-towns of Marhamchurch, Otterham, and Davidstow to the left. From Camelford, a carriage-road, not turnpike, passes to Bodmin, (twelve miles,) through the village of Penpont, and over the race-downs, leaving the church-towns of Advent, St.Breward, and Blifland on the right, and those of Michaelstow and St. Teat h on the left. The mail-coach roads are very good. The cross-roads are not much travelled. There are no post-chaises kept at Stratton, Padstow, Camelford, St.Columb, St.Ives, Looe, Fowey, Tregony, Grampound, Saltassi, nor even at Callington, although two or three roads meet at that town. f The ferry at this place is seldom used for carriages.

Tojfils and Minerals1. \u2014 \" As it is not the purpose of this work to enter into a particular description of the natural productions of Cornwall, we shall take only a general or enlarged view of its mineral riches. And first, it may be observed, that the whole of this peninsular county is com posed of Jlrata which bear the marks of the most ancient formationb, insomuch that no extraneous substances or organic remains in a petrified state have ever been discovered here. On the other hand, there is no country, perhaps, of equal extent, which pre sents a greater variety of metallic substances, or the ores of some metals, for instance, those of tin and copper, in such variety or abundance. We must refer the reader to the sketch already given of the general aspect of the county, in which some particulars are mentioned of its geological constitution. The granitic hills, which, like the vertebrae of the human body, run through the centre of the pen insula, and appear to form the basis of all the others, abound in veins of tin-ore, and the lower hills of Killas, which skirt these, or are recumbent on them, are more peculiarly the site of the richest mines both of tin and of copper which are known to exist in Europe. These metals are found in veins or lodes, which intersect the strata in an easterly or westerly direction, and extend a great way both in length and depth, under various degrees of inclination to the horizon. They are usually intermixed with other metallic substances, such as the sulphurets of iron and zinc (which are not objects of mining research), or with more valuable ores, such as those of lead and cobalt, which, if they occur in any quantity, are separated and reserved for use. As we retire from the central ridge of granite, towards the sea-coast, we find numerous veins of lead and antimony intersecting the lower Killas hills, the former of which are sometimes richly impregnated with silver; and in the alluvial strata of the vallies have been deposited, at an early period of our globe, the mineral contents of numerous veins of tin, which have evidently been brought hither by the cur rents of water from the higher grounds1; these too are the objects of mining * For this concise account of the minerals of Cornwall, we are indebted to a friend, a native of that county, particularly conversant in mineralogy. \" It is hardly worth while to notice the very few exceptions to the above general remarks, exem plified in a few patches of secondary limestone in the south-eastern extremity of the county, and or. the northern and southern coasts. c Among the substances deposited in the vallies occur the horns of the moose deer, and those of the Urus or wild ox. adventure,"], [251, "CORNWALL CCXCV adventure, under the name of stream-works, and furnissi a considerable portion of the mineral riches of the county. It is a fact now well known, that the veins of mineral districts abound in those crystallized bodies which may be said to represent the wonders of the creation in the mineral kingdom ; and accordingly, since the passion for studying this branch of natural history has become so ardent and so general, the Cornissi mines have enriched the cabinets of the curious in all parts of Europe. And here we cannot omit to notice the very laudable exertions of some of the natives of this county, to collect and preserve whatever might illustrate its mineral history, and promote the science of mineralogy. We owe to Dr. Borlase the first seientifical' account of Cornissi minerals, whose collection (now comparatively small) was deposited in the Assimolean Museum at Oxford. A more enlarged collection of these was formed by the late Mr.Soper, of St.Columb, which, since his death, has been sold and dispersed. But by far the most numerous and seientifical collection of the mineral productions of this county, is that which was formed\"by the late Phillip Rassileigh, Esq., at Menabilly. The choicest specimens are here preserved, of whatever crystallized substances have been discovered in the Cornissi mines, during the latter half of the eighteenth cen tury. To this noble repository of mineral curiosities, the late worthy owner always granted the most easy access ; and here travellers were received with hospitality, and had the means of acquiring the most extensive knowledge of the mineral productions of the county, before they entered upon the tour of its mining districts. In the following enumeration of these productions, we shall endeavour to com prise all those which are remarkable for their beauty, their rarity, or their utility, some of which are peculiar to Cornwall ; specifying the places where they have been found or are still found, but omitting a much greater number of mineral substances which are of general occurrence. Native gold (alluvial), \u2014 from the stream-works of Probus, Ladock, Creed, St.Mewan, Carnan, and Perran-Zabulo.d Native silver, \u2014 from Herland mine, in Gwinnear% in St.Mewan, and Huel Mexico in Cubert. Muriat of silver, horn silver, \u2014 from Huel Mexico in Cubert c We call it seientifical, in reference to the times when it was drawn up, i.e. in the infancy of chemical and mineralogical knowledge. * It is worthy of remark, that no veins have hitherto been discovered in the neighbourhood of these stream-works, which contain native gold. The fame remark is applicable to wood-tin. See an account of this discovery in the Philosophical Transactions for 1801. b b 2 Native"], [252, "CORNWALL. CCXCVI Native copper. \u2014 Most of the Cornissi copper-mines produce copper in their metal- lic state, chiefly in the upper parts of the veins ; rarely in the deeper. The finest crystallizations have been found in Botallack Adit, in St. Just. It is not unusual to find veins of native copper in the serpentine rock of Mullion and Landewednack, a most remarkable instance of which is recorded by Dr. Borlase. Red oxid of copper, red or ruby copper. \u2014 This beautiful ore of copper usually accompanies the native copper above-mentioned, and both are most abundant in the mines of Gwennap. Green carbonat of copper, \u2014 Malachit. Blue carbonat of copper, blue copper. Arseniat of copper, olive copper ore. \u2014 A species almost peculiar to the mines of Cornwall, and to those of Gwennap in particular. There are numerous varieties of this ore, most of which distinguissi themselves by their great beauty, and have been described in the Philosophical Transactions for 1801. Sulphuret of copper, vitreous copper ore. \u2014 The mines of Camborne are re- remarkable for their fine crystallizations of this ore. Grey copper ore, fabler?, of the Germans. \u2014 This ore occurs only in the veins of lead or of antimonv. No discovery has yet been made of native tin in this county, the substance formerly described as such being now considered as the produce of ancient smelt ing works. This metal usually occurs in the form of an oxid, the crystallizations of which are very beautiful, particularly the very minute prismatical crystallizations from Glasten ing mine in St.Mewan, and the larger from Trevaunance and Seal-Hole in St. Agnes. The substance called wood-tin, (from its resemblance to the fibres of wood,) is a very singular variety of the oxid of tin. It is almost peculiar to this county, and is found only in the alluvial strata of Ladock, St.Columb, Roche, St.Dennis, St.Austin, St.Mewan and Madron. It has lately heen discovered in Mexico. In the mines of Huel Rock in St. Agnes, and Huel Speed near St.Ives, upwards of thirty years ago, tin was discovered in the state of sulphuret, mixt or combined with the sulphuret of copper. The same substance has been since discovered at Stenna Gwyn, and in other places. The lead-mines of Cornwall have produced fine specimens of crystallized carbonat and phofphat of lead ; and not long since, in the neighbourhood of Penzance lead was dis covered in combination with the sulphuric acid, in well defined crystals. A still rarer, and no less beautiful species of the arseniat of lead, is the produce of a copper-mine called Huel Unity, in the parissi of Gwennap. In the mines of antimony, which are confined to the parissies of Pillaton and Endellion, occurs the usual sulphuret of that metal ; and in the mine of Huei- Boys"], [253, "CORNWALL. CCXCVII Boys in Endellion was found, about twenty years ago, a triple sulphuret of anti mony, lead, and copper, which has been described in the Philosophical Trans actions for 1804. The fine tetraedral crystals of the sulphuret of zinc from St.Agnes deserve notice in this place. No metal occurs in this county under a greater variety of forms than iron. Besides the usual oxides of this metal, viz. the magnetic (from St.Just), the specular and spathose (from the Lizard), the brown iron-stone and brown h\u00e6ma tites from Lanhidrock, there are found here the cupreous arseniat of iron (in the mines of Gwennap), and all the known crystallizations of the common sulphuret and arseniat of iron. The more common ores alone have been found of bismuth, cobalt, arsenic, and manganese. Of the newly-discovered metals, Cornwall produces the ores only of titanium, of uraniumf, and of tungsten. The ferri ferous oxid of the former, in the form of a sand at Manaccan, together with the properties of this new metal, were first difcbvered by the Rev. Wm. Gregor, of Creed, in this county. The ferriferous oxid of tungsten, called Wolfram, is found in the mines of Kit-hill, near Callington, and in various tin-mines in the west of the county ; but the substance called tungsten, which consists of the combination of the oxid of tungstic acid with lime, has been found hitherto only at Pengelly, in the parissi of Breage. r None of the stones denominated precious have been found in Cornwall, except the white topaz, which has been found in the rock at St. Michael's mount. The slate-quarries of Dennybal have supplied the curious with the largest speci mens of transparent and colourless rock-crystals; the mines of St.Agnes with the finest groups or druses of the fame substance ; that of Hewissi in St.Mewan, with the most beautiful crystallizations of amethystine quarz ; and that of Tra vascus in Gwinnear, with the so much admired stalactitical chalcedony. Denny bal quarries, and the rocks of the neighbouring northern coast, furnissi some specimens of adularia*. Crystals of axinite are found at Botallack in St.Just, and in the parissi of Lanlivery, and other places. Crystallized apatite, or phosphat of lime, occurs at Godolphin-Bal in Breage, and at Stenna-gwynn in St.Stephen; which last mine has produced specimens remarkable for their beauty, of the rare mineral, at first c died Hydrargillite or Hydrat of Alumina, but now Wavelliteh. Both the cubic with bevilled edges, and octaedral, crystals of fluor, or fluat of lime, in the mines of St.Agnes. ' The oxid of uranium, in the form of uran-glimrrer, has been found by the Rev. Wm. Gregor, at Stenna-Gwyn, in the parish of St.Stephen. 8 From the information os the Rev. William Gregor. '\u2022 Ibid. Carbonat"], [254, "CCXCVIII CORNWALL. Carbonat of lime is rarely found in the Cornissi veins, although so abundant in the fame situations elsewhere ; nor have the least traces been found in these veins of the earths of Barytes or Strontian. Cornwall produces three materials of primary importance in the manufacture of porcelain : \u2014 the steatite of the Lizard, and the granite and decomposed feltspar (petuntze of the Chinese) of the parissi of St.Stephen. It produces, too, some varieties of serpentine, which readily take a fine polish ; and of greenstone, which emulate the finest antique granitellos. Indigenous Plants. \u2014 There are a few plants which may be considered as peculiar to this county, having been found in no other part of England, as the Ugujiicum Cornubienfe, the erica vagans, and illocebrum verticillatum : herniaria glabra, we be lieve, has been found only in Cornwall and near Newmarket; andftbthorpiaEurop\u0153a only in this county and in Devonssiire. We saw the Ugujiicum Cornubienfe growing abundantly on the skirts of St. Margaret's wood, about a mile north of Bodmin, where, having been lost to the botanists ever since Ray's time, it was re-discovered by Mr. Pennington of the Priory, about twenty-five years ago : we heard of it, also, as growing plentifully between Dunmere wood and the river ; but it has never been found except within a few miles of Bodmin. The erica vagans has seldom been found out of the peninsula of Meneage ; never, we believe, far from it : we observed a few plants in the parissi of Constantine. In Meneage it is con fined almost wholly to Goonhilly downs, where it grows most abundantly : the hedges3 near Trelowarren are covered with it. Contrary to the usage of other heaths, it grows in a soil which is rather stiff; its substratum is a serpentine rock. We found the herniaria glabra growing plentifully on hedges near the Lizard, and the illecebrum verticillatum on the turf, in the way from the village of Sennen to the Land's-end. The sibthorpia Europ\u0153a, although one of the most common plants in the southern parts of Cornwall, is not one of those which readily presents itself to the notice of a traveller, being small and delicate in its organization, and growing in obscure situations, where it is frequently hidden among taller plants. The bartfia vifcosa grows in almost every little valley in the south of Cornwall : we did not observe it anywhere to the north of Bodmin. We found the Silene Anglica growing plentifully in corn-fields near Towednack. That elegant little plant, the campanula haderacea grows abundantly wherever thegrowan or granite soil prevails. We found a few plants of the exacum filiforme near St. Blazey bridge, ' It is necessary to explain to the botanist who is not acquainted with Cornwall, that the hedge* which are often spoken of as the habitats of plantt, are high mounds of stone and earth, wholly destitute of trees or brusti-wood. in"], [255, "CORNWALL. CCXCIX in the habitat described by Mr. Stackhouse, and the melittis grandiflora, between Cotehele and St. Dominic. We observed the hyper icum androfamum growing more universally in Cornwall, than we had seen it in any other part of England ; indeed, we saw it occasionally in all our rides, but never growing abundantly. The anthemis nobilis (chamomile) is to be remarked for its very abundant growth on all the Cornissi downs, which it scents with its aromatic smell. We could not find the tamarix Gallica growing in what appeared to be a wild state, either on St. Michael's Mount or elsewhere, though we have been informed that it is to be seen in that state at Coverack-Cove, near St. Kevern. This ssirub is said to have been imported into England in the reign of Queen Elizabeths by Bissiop Grindall. It is certainly well suited to the soil and climate of the south of Cornwall, and it is probable that no part of England can shew tamarisks of such a size as are to be seen in a hedge-row surrounding an old inclosure near Landewednack, where they are as large as good-sized willow-trees. Tonkin mentions fig-trees as growing in a wild state in the parissi of St.Gorran, and fays, that in some seasons the fruit ripened, if not destroyed by birds ; but he supposes that they might have belonged to a garden.0 In the parissi of Gwythian the fig-tree appears to be naturalized to a greater degree than perhaps anywhere in the kingdom. We observed a considerable group in. the church-yard, and were assured that there were many in the neighbouring hedge-rows. The arundo arenaria or common sea-russi, happily for the inhabitants of the north coast, is most abundant in that district, and indeed is planted as the only means of arresting, by its long-spreading fibrous roots, the progress of the moving sand-heaps. The value of this useful russi has been long known. There was an act of Parliament in Scotland, so long ago as the year 1695, to prevent persons who collected this russi (then known by the name of Jlarre or bent) for the pur pose of making mats and baskets, from plucking it up, and thereby loosening the sands, to the injury of the land-owners. A clause to the same effect was intro duced in a multifarious act of Parliament in the year 174c The operation of this clause extends generally to the north-west coasts of England; but such persons as claimed a prescriptive right of cutting Jlarre or bent, on the sea-coast of Cumberland, are exempted from its operation. Dr. Borlase speaks of a peculiar furze of humble growth, called the dwarf or Cornissi furze. This is what Ray, who saw it in Cornwall, calls genifta fpinofa minor. It has been since recognized as a distinct species, under the name of idea nanus. This ssirub is not peculiar to Cornwall, but particularly abundant on 1 Darcie's Annals of Queen Elizabeth, Book III. p. 45. c Lord Dunstanville's edition of Carew, p. 70. the IO"], [256, "CORNWALL. CCC the downs of that county, to which, in the autumn, it gives a great richness, being intermixed with the common heath, and flowering in profusion at the fame time. Borlase and Ray speak of the linaria monspejfulana (now called antirrhinum repens), as growing plentifully along the hedges near Penryn. They also mention pep/is maritima, now euphorbia peplis, as growing plentifully on the sands between Penzance and Marazion. This plant, as we were informed by the late Mr. Thompson, of Penzance, (who ssiewed us some dried specimens formerly found there,) has been quite lost from that habitat by the ssiifting of the sands. Panicum daclylon, by the name of gramen daily hides, is mentioned by Dr. Borlase, as it had been before by Ray, as having the fame habitat. Mr. Turner, in his Botanist's Guide, enumerates among other rare plants observed by himself, an chufa fempervirens, as growing near Liskeard, and viola laclea on heaths between Liskeard and Lostwithiel ; corrigiola littoralis, growing on the banks of Loo-pool; alifma ranunculoides, between Penzance and Marazion, on the authority of Mr. E. Forster, jun.; and Jlellaria faxifraga in the fissures of rocks at Castle- Treryn, on that of Dr. Maton, besides several rare lichens and fucic. The genifla pilofa (a very rare plant) was found by Sir Thomas Gery Cullum, Bart., grow ing profusely on the heath near the soapy rock : it was found also by the late Dr.Sibthorpe, near Kinan's Cove. It may be remarked, that several of the rarer plants found in this countv are, strictly speaking, natives of .the south-eastern parts of Europe ; Jibthorpia Europ\u0153a being found in Crete and Thessaly; panicum daclylon in Greece; corrigiola littoralis on the Bosphorus ; and Ugujiicum Cornubienfe on Mount Athos. Birds, Zfc. \u2014 With respect to this department of natural history we have little to fay ; there is, however, one bird so connected with the county, that we think it ssiould be noticed : that species of graculus which is distinguissied by its red bill and feet, though it is found in other parts of this island, has obtained the name of the Cornissi chough, from its having been very abundant in Cornwall : it is now become rather scarce. Upton, in his heraldic work, written in 1440, speaks of this bird as particularly abundant in Cornwall, and notices the circumstance of its being adopted as an armorial bearing by many of the Cornissi gentry. Dr.Borlase has given an account of the rarer birds of passage, which occasionally frequent this country : to these may be added, the merops apiajler or bee-eater, a bird c A full account of the Cormsli fuel will be sound in Mr.Stackhousc's work' (published in 1801), entitled \" Nereis Britannica.\" rarely"], [257, "CORNWALL.

Dr. Borlase has described such rare fissi as are occasionally caught on the Cornissi coast, and the rarer shells which are found on the ssiores. Mineral Waters and remarkable Wells. \u2014 Dr.Borlase fays that there are no saline, aluminous or sulphureous waters in the county : he mentions a spring near Redruth called Carnkei, said to be impregnated with tin, and several chalybeate springs. The most remarkable of these were one at Treleven in Mevagissey, called the brass well, from the colour of the scum upon it ; and that of Colurian, in the parissi of Ludgvan, which he speaks of as the strongest, and fays that it was much in request as a chalybeate water ; that it was used in various complaints, both external and internal, and particularly was esteemed a good collyrium\\ Two springs in St. Minver are still in some repute for curing disorders of the eye. There is a chalybeate spring on the barton of Trewoof in Burian. Several springs of pure water, which do not appear to be impregnated with any mineral, were in great repute formerly for wonderful effects in the cure of diseases, as that of St.Maddern, near Penzance ; Holy-well in Cubert ; St.Uny's in Sancreed, &c. Norden, speaking of the first-mentioned, says, \" its fame in former ages was greate for the supposed vertue of healinge, which St.Maderne had thereinto infused : and manie votaries made annale pilgrimages unto it as they doe even at this daye, unto the well of St.Winifrede beyonde Chester, in Den bighssiire, whereunto thowfands doe yearelye make resorte ; but of late St.Ma derne hath denied his or hers (I know not whether) pristine ayde ; and as he is coye of his cures, so now are men coye of coming to his conjured well ; yet * It had pedcs scansorii, with the long feathers of the thighs reaching to the toes, and does not exactly resemble any known species, but has been supposed to be a degenerate variety of our cuckoo. It was preserved by the Rev. John King of Stratton, and presented by him to the President of the Royal Society, who has deposited it in Mr. Bullock's Museum. k The late Mr. Hitchins, in a paper communicated to the Society of Antiquaries observes, that \" it is singular that, in speaking of this well, and its virtues, Dr. Borlase, although he notices its efficacy in diseases of the eye, does not remark that its name is pure Greek, KoMvqun, meaning a medicine for the eyes.\" The affinity and the corresponding circumstances mentioned by Mr.Hitchinfi are very striking. The fame may be observed of the Cataclusc rocks in St.Merran parish. The affinity of the Cornish language with the Greek in many of its words has been noticed by Carew, Lhuyd, &c. . Vol. III. c c soom"], [258, "CORNWALL. CCCII soom a daye resorte.\" A circumstance happened not many years afterwards, which again raised the credit of St.Maddern's well to its former height. A man, said to have been restored to the use of his limbs by the water of this well, was seen by the learned Bissiop Hall, whilst in Cornwall on his visitation ; and the Bissiop, after conversing with him, was so thoroughly convinced of the reality of the cure, that he recorded it in one of his publications, entitled, \" The Mystery of Godliness.\" There was formerly a chapel belonging to this well, which was destroyed in Cromwell's time by Major Ceely, of St.Ives. Dr. Borlase mentions another superstition attached to St.Maddern's well, which, on enquiry, we find is not yet worn out. \" Hither,\" fays he, after speaking of its supposed medical virtues, \" upon much less justifiable errands, come the uneasy, impatient, and superstitious, and by dropping pins and pebbles into the water, and by ssiaking the ground round the spring, so as to raise bubbles from the bottom ; at a certain time of the year, moon and day, endeavour to settle such doubts and enquiries as wilLnot let the idle and anxious rest. Here, therefore, they come, and instead of allaying, deservedly feed their uneasiness, the supposed responses serving equally to increase the gloom of the melancholy, the suspicions of the jealous, and the passion of the enamoured.\" In the neighbouring parissi of Gulvall is a well much resorted to formerly, for similar purposes, particularly by those who wissied to make enquiries after absent friends. \" An old woman,\" fays Hals, \" attended to shew the well ; before whom, on their approach, the question was to be assied aloud. If the person enquired after were in health, the water was instantly to bubble ; if sick, to be suddenly discoloured; and if dead, to remain in its natural state.\" Dr. Borlase, who writes in 1 749, speaks of this woman as then lately dead, and fays, that \" ssie was supposed to be so conversant with the mysteries of the well, that ssie was daily resorted to by numbers of persons, who wissied to consult its oracular waters, and have their curiosity satisfied, particularly as to goods or cattle lost or stolen.\" We find on enquiry, that this superstition still keeps its ground, and that the spring is called Gulfwell, \" the Hebrew brook.\" Norden speaks of our Lady of Nants well, in Cornwall, in the parissi of St^Colan, to which men and women came, and children were brought to \" foreknow of the Ladye of the well, (by givinge an offring, and castinge a palme croffe. into the water on Palme-Sunday,) what fortune ssiould befall them that yeare ; so blind were people to followe and beleve such deceyvinge oracles.\" Precisely the same superstitions and customs respecting wells are to this day pre valent in several parts of Wales. Produce."], [259, "CORNWALL. CCCIII Produce. Camden says, that the county of Cornwall yielded such plenty of corn as not only to have supply enough for its own use, but to export large quantities annu ally to Spain. Some parts of the county still produce great abundance of corn, particularly from Endellion to St.Columb on the north coast, the district called Meneage, the neighbourhood of Burian and of St.Germans, the lands near the Fowey, and great part of the hundred of Stratton ; but the superfluities of these districts are supposed to be scarcely enough to supply the deficiencies of other parts of the county.\" The avena nuda or naked oat, called in Cornwall pillis or pill-corn, from the Cornissi word />//^z(bald), is still cultivated, though perhaps, not in so great abundance as it was in Ray's time; it yields, as it then did, the fame price as wheat. Its chief use is for making gruel for calves, and as food for poultry. The peculiar manures of this county are sea-sand b, sea-weeds, and damaged pilchards. The sand, which is carried inland in great quantities, and occasionally to the distance of 20 miles or more, is known to have been in use as early as the reign of Henry III.C This county produces potatoes in great abundance, and it appears that they have been cultivated to a great extent in Cornwall, longer than in other parts of the kingdom, for Dr. Borlase speaks of potatoes as the chief support of the poor in 1758. Both the soil and climate, particularly in the southern part of the county, are well adapted to the culture of this useful root. About Penzance the lands produce two crops in the year ; and an acre has been known to yield 300 bussiels (Winchester measure) of the early kidney potatoes at the first crop, and at the second, 600 bussiels of apple potatoes.d Large quantifies of potatoes are exported from Cornwall to London, Plymouth, and Portsmouth ; \"besides which, and the home consumption as human food, a large overplus is applied to the feeding of pigs.e Orchards abound in all the southern parts of the county, in some parts of trie hundred of Stratton, and in that part of the hundred of East which borders on the Tamar, particularly in the parissies of Calstock, Stoke-Climsland, St.Do- * The mining districts are supplied in a great measure from the Isle of Wight, and from the neigh bourhood of Chichester; the populous town of Plymouth, on the other hand, is supplied with a great quantity of wheat from Cornwall. k The sea-sand of Cornwall is peculiarly adapted for the purposes of manure, from the abundant mixture which it contains of pulverized shells and coral. The sand from the mouth of the Fal is wholly composed of coral. * The liberty of taking sand for manure from the sea-shores was granted by Richard, King of the Roman3, and confirmed by King Henry III.

The parissies of Calstock and Stoke-Climsland abound also in cherry-orchards. Carew speaks of great quantities of garlick cultivated in the neighbourhood of Stratton for exportation : its culture is now chiefly confined to private gardens j it is, however, occasionally exposed to sale in the market, and purchased by the cattle-doctors. Cornwall has been celebrated for the produce of its tin-mines from very remote antiquity. We learn from Strabo, Herodotus, and other ancient writers, that the Ph\u0153nicians, and after them the Greeks and Romans, traded for tin to Corn wall, under the name of the islands Cassiterides, from a very early period. Dio dorus Siculus, who wrote in the reign of Augustus, gives a particular account of the manner in which that valuable metal was dug and prepared by the Britons. It would be beside the purpose of our work, and would unnecessarily increase its bulk, if we were to enter into any detailed history of the tin and copper mines, the manner of working them, or of preparing the ore, which have been treated of at large by authors who have written expressly upon the subject. It may be deemed sufficient that we give a few leading facts as to the history and extent of the trade in these most important and staple commodities of the county, with a brief mention of some of the principal mines. In the reign of King John, the annual toll or duty on tin, payable to the Earl of Cornwall, was farmed at 200 marks f; but we are not certain what the rate of the duty then was. In the beginning of Henry III.'s reign, the earldom of Cornwall being then in the hands of the crown, the coinage and the stannaries were granted to William de Pucot during pleasured In the reign of Edward I. the payment to the Earl was fixed at four shillings for every hundred-weight of white tin ; and for the better security of that payment, it was agreed, that all tin ssiould be brought to certain places appointed for that purpose, to be weighed and stamped, or as it is usually termed, coined u; and that no tin ssiould be sold till this stamp had been affixed. It is stated in a record of 1337, that the profit of the coinage to the Earl was then on the average 3000 marks per annum ; but ' Madox's History of the Exchequer, p. 631. s Pat. 4 Hen.

Dr. Borlase says, that the richest tin-mine he ever heard of, as to the quality of the ore, was that of Polberrow in St.Agnes, near the Beacon, and that in the year 1750, it was so abundant that they could not get horses to carry the tin to the smelting- house ; but he adds, that the mine which had turned out the most gain and the greatest quantity of tin then known, was that of Polgooth in St. Mewan, by which, as appeared by the old books, the adventurers got 20,000k per annum for many years following.

To the above productive tin-mines may be added Huel Peevor in Red ruth, Seal Hole in St.Agnes, and Poldice in Gwennap. In Dr. Berger's treatise on the physical structure of Cornwall and Devon % it is stated0, \" that there were, about the year 1800, 28 tin-mines then worked in Cornwall, of which seven were in the parissi of St.Agnes, four in Wendron, three in Gulvall ; two each in Lelant, Redruth, and Perran-Zabuloe. Besides these, there were thirteen mines producing tin and copper; of which there were four in Redruth, four in Gwennap, three in St. Agnes, and two in St. Neot ; and one mine worked for tin and cobalt, in Madron. Drakewill's tin-mine, on Hengeston-down, in the parissi of Calstock, is said to be the oldest mine now working, in the county, having been in working about 1 50 years.p The most productive tin-mines now working are Cook's Kitchen, in Illogan; Huel Unity, in Gwennap ; Trevenen, near Helston ; and Botallack, in St. Just. The mineral rights of tin in the duchy manors have been lately sold, for a term of years, to Edward Smith, Esq. of Ince. The process of working mines is fully detailed by Dr. Borlase, Pryce, and other writers on that subject, to whose works the reader is referred. It will be sufficient here to mention, that in the earliest times the mines were worked only to the depth of eight or ten fathoms, by open fosses, (the rock being first softened by firing, and then broken by pick-axes and wedges,) and that the present method of working them by perpendicular ssiafts, and under-ground galleries or adits, has not been practised much more than 300 years. The art of blasting with gun powder, which forms another sera in the history of mining, was introduced about i century and a half ago. The power of working the mines to a greater depth increased as the improved state of mechanics provided the means of getting rid of the water by which the miners' works were interrupted ; for, as Pryce ob serves, a ssiaft could not be worked, a hundred years since, more than 1 5 fathoms deep, from the quantity of water, where, in his time, it could be funk 50 fathoms without a drop. The introduction of steam-engines, as invented by Newcomen, about the year 1710, formed an important \u00e6ra in the history of mining. Watt's improved engine, which gave a considerable increase of power, whilst it lessened in a great degree the consumption of fuel, was introduced into Cornwall about the year 1778. \" Published in the Transactions of the Geological Society.

CCCVII The tin-ore has always been smelted in the county. Sir Francis Godolphin introduced some improved methods of stamping and dressing tin from the con tinent ; and Sir Beville Grenville made an attempt to smelt the tin with pit-ceal ; but it was not till the early part of the last century that the present mode of smelting was adopted. Mr. Lyddell obtained a patent in the year 1705 for smelting tin in iron furnaces, and set up works at Angarrack in the parissi of Phillack. The use of reverberatory furnaces soon followed ; and the blowing houses, in which the tin had before been smelted, grew into disuse. For many years the blowing-houses at St. Austell were the only works of the kind in Corn wall. A new one was erected in 1 8 1 1 near Penzance. For some purposes (particularly for fixing the grain of the scarlet dye) the tin smelted in blowing houses is esteemed more valuable than the other, and bears a higher price. Norden, in his address to King James (annexed to his Speculum Britannia') speaking of the copper of Cornwall, says, \" it is a metall whose qualitie and quantitie woulde so farre excede the former (tin), as, were the workes assumed into Your Majestie's own handes, duly searched, trtilie managed, and effectually fol lowed, woulde rayse a greater yearlie profite than the value of Your Majestie's land revenues, so riche are the workes, especially some lately founde, as by the opinion of the skilfull in that misterie the like have not bene elsewhere founde.

It is said that the first copper-mines which were worked with success were those en Lord Falmouth's manor of Albalanda or Blanchland, in Kea. Borlase, writing in 1758, says, that \" it was computed that for 14 years then past, the copper-mines had produced i6o,oool. per annum.\" This considerably exceeds the calculation of that period as given by Pryce, whose statement is as follows : Tons. 1726 \u2014 1735. average 6,480 - #47,350 173\u00b0\u2014 1 745- - - 7>552 '\u25a0 56>OI\u00b0 1746\u20141755- - - 9-879 - 73>I45 1756 \u2014 J765- \" '- l6>97\u00b0 ' I24>3\u00b04 1766\u20141775. - - 26,427 - i77>833 We"], [264, "CCCVIII CORNWALL.

Borlase says, that the greatest and most sudden gain ever heard of, was in the mine of Huel Virgin, in July and August 1757 : \u2014 the first fortnight, 5,700k ; in the next three weeks and two days, as much as sold for 9,6oq1. There are now several mines in the parissi of Gwonnap more productive. In the year 1806, when, on account of the high price of copper, the quantity raised considerably exceeded the average, the copper raised from this mine was 252 tons; from Huel Fortune, about 293 ; Tressierby, 335 ; Poldice, 402 ; Huel Unity, 496 ; and Huel Damsel, 539. The total produce of the Gwennap mines that year was 2962 tons. The most productive copper-mines within the last 20 years may be considered Huel Unity, Huel Damsel, Huel Virgin, United Mines, and Trelkerby, in Gwen- nap ; Cook's Kitchen, and Tin Croft, in Illogan ; Dolcoath in Camborne ; Oat- field, and Godolphin in Crowan ; Herland, and Huel, Alfred, in Gwinnear ; Huel Towan, in St. Agnes ; and North Downs, in Redruth and Kenwyn. Some of these, mines, although they have produced great quantities of copper, owing to the very heavy expences attending the working of them, have not yielded a large profit to the adventurers. About the year 1800, there were 45 copper-mines worked in Cornwall ; of which, eleven were in the parissi of Gwennap, six in St.Agnes, five in Camborne, four in Gwinnear, four in St. Hilary, three each in Germoe, Crowan, and Illogan, and two in St.Neot; the remainder scattered singly in other parissies. Besides these, there were 1 8 mines worked both for copper and tin, as before stated ; one in Gwinnear, for copper and silver, and one in Camborne, for copper and cobalt/ ' Dr. Berger's paper, before quoted. The"], [265, "CORNWALL. CCCIX The most productive copper-mines now working are Huel Alfred, near Hayle ; Crennis, near St. Austell ; Dolcoath, in Camborne ; Huel Unity, United Mines, Huel Damsel, and . Treskerby, in Gwennap;. Huel Abraham, in Crowan; Huel To wan, in St. Agnes ; and Gunnis Lake, in Calitock. These mines, however, owing to the low price of copper, and the great expence of working them, yield little profit to the adventurers, except Crennis and Huel Alfred ; it being calcu lated that Crennis yields about 2000I. a month, and Huel Alfred about half as much. The mineral rights of copper, lead, &c. in the duchy manors, have been lately sold for 31 years, to John Williams, Esq. of Scorrier-house; Mr. Robert Were Fox, of Falmouth ; Charles Carpenter, Esq. of Moditonham, and others : an agreement has been since made by the fame parties for the silver. Tonkin speaks of several unsuccessful attempts at smelting copper, even before the year 1700: one of these was made by Mr. Scobell and others, at Polruddan in St. Austell, where copper-ore is said to have been first smelted in Cornwall. This writer proposed that all the copper ssiould be smelted in the county, as the tin was ; and that it ssiould be coined, and pay a duty to the Duke. About the year 1754, Mr. Sampson Swaine, and some other gentlemen of Camborne, erected furnaces for smelting copper at Entrall in that parissi ; but on account of the convenience of importing coal, the works were removed to Hayle. Some other works were established about the year 1770, in the parissi of Redruth, whence they were removed to Tregew, on a branch of Falmouth harbour r : these smelting houses remain, but they have not been used for some years ; the only copper sinelting-houses in Cornwall being those at Hayle, in which about 6000 tons of copper-ore are supposed to be smelted annually. The greater part of the Cornissi copper-ore is still ssiipped off to be smelted in Wales. The produce of the lead-mines in Cornwall is inconsiderable, compared with that of some other parts of the kingdom. Pryce fays, that there were in ancient times lead-mines in Perran-Zabuloe and St.Allen. Tonkin speaks of a rich lead mine in the last-mentioned parissi at a place called the Garras. Dr. Borlase mentions also a lead-mine at St. Iffey. Dr. Berger speaks of two lead-mines in Sithney parissi, near Helston, and one of lead and silver in Wendron. These and Pool mine are still worked, but the produce is not considerable. Gold ore has never been found in Cornwall in sufficient quantities, to have been con sidered as an object of profit. It has been said, that in former times the silver-mines were very valuable. Holinssied fays, that King Edward III. had some help towards his charges from the silver-mines in Devonssiire and Cornwall, as his grandfather ' Pryce's Mineralogia Cornub dd King Vol. III."], [266, "CORNWALL. CCCX King Edward I. had !. Among the records in the Exchequer, is the fragment of an indenture between King Richard II. and Henry de Burton, respecting the mines of gold. and silver in Cornwall. In the reign of Henry VI., Richard Curson had a grant of all mines of gold and silver in Cornwall for twenty years, with wood and underwood for refining the metals '. In the reign of Henry VII. the mines of gold and silver were leased to Sir Robert Willoughbyu. The principal silver-mines of late years have been Huel Mexico in Cubert, Herland in Gwinnear, and Huel Duchy in Calstock. A prosit of about 5000/. was made out of Herland mine ; in Huel Mexico, the expence exceeded the profit, notwithstanding it produced considerable quantities of rich horn-silver, and some crystallized in cubes : neither of these mines is now worked. The Calstock mine, which has already produced about 4.000/., promises to be more profitable. Other minerals of less importance, spoken of by Dr. Borlase, as the produce of the Cornissi mines, and occasionally the objects of commerce, are cobalt, bis muth, lapis calaminaris, antimony, and arsenic. This author speaks of a mine of Mr. Beauchamp's, of cobalt, and bismuth, as one of considerable value. He fays, that \" the bismuth was thrown away, till Dr. Schloffer ssiewed Mr. Beau champ that the cobalt, might perform its office of tinging glass blue, and the bis muth also preserved.\" Dr. Berger speaks of a mine of antimony at St. Austell, and another at Endellion ; but very little, if any, is raised at present w. Neither bismuth, nor lapis calaminaris, is now found in sufficient quantity to form articles of commerce. Cobalt has been found chiefly in Huel Sparnon, Redruth, and Dol coath in Camborne, but it is not raised at present. There are manganese mines near Callington, in the parissies of Northill and Lewannick, and on the borders of Bodmin moor, near the Indian Oueen ; from which, of late years, about two thousand tons of mangenese have been obtained, but they are not supposed to have yeilded any profit. The slate of the Cornissi quarries is an article of considerable commerce. The chief quarries are those on the south coast ; those between Liskeard and the Tamar ; those in the parissies of Padstow and Tintagel, and the famous quarry known by the name of De la Bole, or Dennybal, in the parissi of St.Teath, not far from Camelford. Norden calls the slate of Menheniot the best in Cornwall ; that of Tintagel is of a very good and lasting quality ; but that of the Dennybal quarry is now in the highest esteem, and is exported in large quantities from s Fol. 1000.

The stone of the Cornissi quarries, though of a good quality for building\", and sufficiently abundant, is scarcely to be spoken of as an article of commerce ; but the granite or moor-stone, which abounds on the surface of the moors, has of late years been exported in considerable quantity for bridges and other public buildings. The granite from St.Stephen's in Brannelly is exported also under the name of china-stone, for the purposes of the porcelain manufacture in Staffordssiire. A fine white clay is procured also in abundance from some pits in the fame parissi (the property of Lord Grenville) for that manufacture, and they are both exported from the neighbouring port of Charles-Town z. The late Mr. Wedgwood is said to have first applied these valuable articles to the purposes of the porcelain manufacture1. The pure white Jleatites or soap-rook, from the neighbourhood of the Lizard, has been long exported by the china manufacturers of Worcester for the fame purpose. A yellow sandy clay, which, from its standing intense heat, is called fire-clay, found on an estate of Mr. Pread, near Lelant town, is exported to Wales in large quantities for the purpose of laying the bottoms of copper furnaces ; it is sold at 1 os. 6d. per ton. To the various sources of prosit, which the mines, the quarries, and the soil of this county have supplied,^may be added, as an important branch of commerce1\", the produce of the fissieries on its coasts. Although the whale fissiery has never been attempted with success in modern times, it was formerly so profitable, that * Particularly that of the Pentewan quarry in St. Austell, of which several gentlemen's feats >\u25a0 the county have been built; and (according to Leland and Norden) the castles of Pendennis, St. Mawes, &c. and many of the parish-churches. 1 A white granite, whose mica contains no particles of iron ; it would not otherwise suit the pur poses of the porcelain manufacture. * The quantity of china-stone and china-clay exported from Charles-Town for the last sour years has been as follows : \u2014 Tons of CI)ina-ston\u00ab.

Tonkin says, that the grampus's and blowers appear on the Cornissi coast in great plenty in the pilchard season ; that in the early part of the last century, Mr. Corker of Fal mouth, Mr. Kempe of Rosteage, and some other gentlemen procured a patent for a whale-fissiery, and were at some expence in providing expert harpooners, but it did not answer, not however, as he observes, for want of fissi, if they could have taken them. He adds, that they disposed of their patent among the late bubbles (1720), and saved themselves harmless. The most esteemed fissi for the table, such as the turbot, sole, piper, dory, red mullet, whiting, mackarell, &c. are taken in abundance on the Cornissi coast. The London market is said to be chiefly supplied in the early part of the season with mackarell from the fissieries at Newlyn. At Polperro is a very extensive hook and line fissiery for turbots, soles, whitings, &c. for the supply of the Bath and Plymouth markets. The most important branch of the Cornissi fissiery is, that of herrings and pilchards, particularly the latter, which are peculiar to these coasts, the opposite coasts of Britanny, and those of the south of Ireland. We do not find any mention of pilchards in very ancient records. The fame Bayonne merchants who rented the whale-fissiery, as before-mentioned, paid six marks a-year to King John for the monopoly of the trade of drying congers and whitings or haddocks (jnerluciones). The act of the 2 2d of Edward IV., to prevent frauds in the packing of barrelled fissi, mentions only herrings and eels. In the reign of Queen Elizabeth, however, it appears that the exportation of pilchards was carried on to so great an extent, that the consumption of timber for casks became a national object, and an act was passed in the 35th year of that reign, to enforce the importation of clapboard for cassis, in lieu of the cassis so exported. Tonkin speaks of 30,000 hogssieads, as having been cured in a year, of which more than 22,000 were caught at Mevagissey only. Dr. Borlase states the average often years (1747 \u2014 17S&) at 29?795 hogssieads, of which he reckons 1732 as taken at Fowey ; 14,631s in the neighbourhood of Falmouth, 12,149! in Mount's-bay, and 1,282 at St. Ives. He makes no mention of Mevagissey. The pilchard trade had become so much more extensive before the war, that 6c,ooo hogssieads, caught in St. Austell bay, have besn exported from Fowey in one year. Since 1800, the most which have been sent from that port in one year, has not exceeded 20,000 hogssieads ; from 1807 to 18 11 the trade almost wholly k \"Uris fishery extended from Mount St. Michael to Dartmouth.

In 1 8 1 1, the trade revived a little, in consequence of the exportation of pilchards to the West-Indies. Great quantities have of late years been sold for manure, the oil having been first extracted. The chief pilchard fissieries at present on the south coast are in St. Austell-bay and Mount's-bay, and at St. Ives and North-Quay on the north coast. Oysters are found in great quantities, and of a good quality, in the creeks of the Heyle. Manufaclures. Cornwall has never been considered as a manufacturing county, except as far as relates to the dressing and smelting of its metals already mentioned. At Pen zance the tin is manufactured into bars for the Mediterranean trade, and into ingots for the East-Indies.\" At Hayle copper-house are very extensive works for making copper spikes and nails for ssiip-building. Dr. Borlase mentions a vitriol manufactory set up at Redruth in 1747 : it was soon dropped, the consumption being so small that it did not answer. Pryce speaks of some works for regulus of antimony, set up by Mr.Reed at Feock, and a manufacture of crucibles at Calenick near Truro, a few years before 1775 : the latter is still continued. At Truro also is a carpet-manufactory ; and an iron-foundry has been lately establissied. There is a manufactory of poldavies at Penryn : coarse woollen clothes are made at Launceston, and other places in the north-east part of the county. The Survey of Domesday mentions ten salt-works at Stratton, which yielded a rent of ten shillings to the King. Dr. Borlase speaks of a place in the parissi of Sennen, near the Land's-end, where traces of salt-works were to be seen; and adds, that, according to the tradition of the place, the works were discon tinued, not through any deficiency of materials, or incongruity of situation, but through the neglect or dissionesty of the persons employed. Trade and Ports. \" The chief trade of Cornwall,\" fays Dr. Borlase, \" consists in exporting tin, copper, and fissi ; and the principal imports are timber, iron, hemp, and such other necessaries as mining and fissiing require.\" Of these, coal is the most prominent article. Dr. Borlase adds, that \" the Cornissi had a privilege granted by Charles she First for their steady attachment to the royal cause, of trading to all parts of the world, \u2014 a privilege,\" he observes, \"of more credit than profit, since trade has been fettered, and so confined to exclusive companies.1' In"], [270, "CCCXIV CORNWALL. In ancient times the principal port in Cornwall was that of Fowey. Its com mercial importance in the reign of Edward III. may be estimated from the fol lowing circumstance : Upon a call for ssiips and mariners for the King's service ; it furnissied more ships than any port in the kingdom, and more mariners than any port, except Yarmouth. The trade of Fowey is now inconsiderable, whilst Falmouth, whose existence as a town, can scarcely be traced for two cen turies, is become one of the principal ports in the West of England. Fowey has an excellent and safe haven, capable of containing a large fleet ; but from its contiguity to the Atlantic, Falmputh, whose spacious harbour is scarcely second to any in point of safety and accommodation, possesses peculiar advantages as the rendezvous of outward and homeward bound fleets0. This port has for many years carried on a very extensive foreign trade : it was one of the first ports in the West, to which the privileges of the bonding act were extended, and is the only tobacco port in the counties of Cornwall and Devon.

Antiquities. British and British -Roman Antiqidties. \u2014 Cornwall abounds with the rude me morials of its early inhabitants, much resembling those which remain in Ireland, in Wales, and in the northern parts of this island, consisting of large unwrought stones, placed erect, either singly or in circles, or with others laid across ; and tumuli of stones or earth. Of the upright stones, two of the most remarkable are standing a furlong asunder, at Bolleit in St. Buryan, the one twelve, and the other sixteen feet high3. Dr. Borlase describes two in the tenement of Dryft in Sancred, and two others in that of Trewren-Madern, which he supposes to be sepulchral monuments. \" On the downs,\" he fays, \" leading from Wadebridge to St.Columb, and about two miles distant from it, is a line of stones bearing north-east and south-west, generally called the Nine Maids.\"0 e In 1812, 25,116 tons of copper were exported from Basset's Cove, and 18,910 chaldrons of coals imported. a Borlase's Antiquities, plate x. p. 1 64. k Ibid. p. 189.

Boscawen-un, and Rosmodrevy% in the parissi of St.Burian; Bossiednand in Gulvall : and an oval inclosure in the tenement of Kerris, in the parissi of St. Par;, formed by rude stones, 52 paces from north to south, and 34 from east to west, called the Roundago ; with four rude pillars, about eight feet high, at the southern termination e : the monument called the Hurlers, in the parish of St. Cleer, originally consisted of three circles, from which many stones have been carried awayf: a cluster of circles at Botallek in St.Just, some of them intersecting othersg: a circle of stones, on a hill called Karn-Menelez, in the parissi of Wendron, in the middle of which is a large natural rock, consisting of four flat layers h : a small circle of stones at Tredineck, in the parissi of Gulvall': a circle in the parissi of Zennor, formed by small stones thrown loosely together, having at the entrance one tall pillar\"; and a singular monument at Bodinar, called the Crellas, being a double circle, 55 feet by 50, consisting of low walls ; and another single one adjoining, only 18 feet in diameter1. Dr. Borlase also describes two other circles of upright stones in the Scilly Isles; one of them on Salakee-downs, in St.Mary'sm, and the other on the island of Trescaw.\" It is most probable that these circles of upright stones, the work of the rude inhabitants of this island, in the earliest ages, were applied to purposes of reli gion ; though the opinion of those who consider them as peculiarly referable to the druidical superstitions, does not appear to be supported, by the few notices which are to be met with on that subject, in the writings of the ancients : all the writers who were contemporary with the Druids, from whom alone any real knowledge of them can be derived, Uniformly assert that their religious rites were confined to groves of oak ; whilst these rude stone monuments chiefly abound in the most desert parts of our island, where, in all probability, neither oaks nor any other trees ever grew : and similar ones are found in almost every part of the world, though the Druids are supposed to have been chiefly confined to Britain and Gaul. b Borlase's Antiquities, p. 194. c MS.

Rounds. \u2014 There are also in Cornwall several circular inclosures, with walls of stone or earth, on the inside of which are rows of scats, having been amphitheatres, originally intended for the exhibition of sports of various kinds, and where, in later times, the Cornissi plays were represented ; they are known by the name of Rounds, or Plan an guare (the place of sport) ; and one of them, in the parissi of Redruth, has given that appellation to the village where it is situated. Two of the most remarkable of these works, are the Rounds of St.Just and Piran ; the former is described by Dr.Borlase as being an exact circle, of 1 26 feet in diameter; the perpendicular height of the bank being seven feet from the area within, but the height from the bottom of the ditch without, 10 feet, formerly more. The scats of stone, consisting of six steps, were 14 inches wide, and one foot high\": it is not at present nearly so perfect as it appears to have been when thus described : \u2014 The area of Piran-Round is \" perfectly level, about one hundred and thirty feet in diameter, with benches of turf, seven in number, rising eight feet from the area.\"0 Barrows. \u2014 Tumuli or Barrows, both of earth and stones, (the latter commonly known by the British appellation of Kairns,) are found in several parts of Cornwall, most of which may be considered as the sepulchral memorials of the Britons ; though no doubt some of them, especially those which have been found to contain neatly executed urns, may be referred to the Romans, or Romanized-Britons. Dr.Borlase describes a tumulus of earth in a field at Trelowarren, opened in 1751, in the middle of which was a small cell, formed of stones, inclosing bones; and in part of the barrow were found two urns, with their mouths downward, inclosing bones and assies. On St.Austell-downs there are many barrows, which \" lie some times two, three, even seven in a strait linep.\" A stone tumulus or kairn at Tre dinek in Gulvall is figured in Dr. Borlase's work*1. In the year 1733, a barrow of earth in the tenement of Chickarn, in the parissi of St. Just in Penwith, was found to contain, near the centre, a paved square cell of stone, in which was an orna mented urn, full of human bones; and a great number of plain urns were discovered in other parts of the barrow ' : three barrows, about a mile distant from that last-mentioned, situated in the tenement of Bosavern-R6s, in the fame parissi, were opened in the year 1 748 : in one of them was found the ssieleton of \" Dr. Borlase's Antiquities, plate 18. figs. 1 and 2. p. 208 0 Borlase's Natural History, p. 298. pi. 29. fig. 3. p Philosophical Transactions, 1740. 1 Antiquities of Cornwall, p. 219. pi. 20. fig. 4.

The five following are particularly described by Dr.Borlase in his Antiquities of Cornwall : \u2014 Molfra-Cromlech, in the parissi of Maddern, standing on a hill, surrounded by a stone barrow or kairn ; the cover-stone being nine feet eight inches, by 14 feet 3 inches, including a piece which has been broken off and lying near it : Lanyon-Quoit, also in the parissi of Maddern, 19 feet in length, and raised so high that a man on horseback may sit under it: Zennor-Cromlech, standing on a hill, about half a mile to the east of Zennor church-town, surrounded by a stone barrow : Chun-Cromlech, the covering-stone of which is 1 2 feet 6 inches, by 1 1 feet, standing on a tumulus, about 500 feet south-west of Chun-castle : and Carwynen-Cromlech, in the parissi of Camborne, the covering-stone of which is 1 2 feet, by 1 1 feet 6 inches'. To these may be added that of Trethevy, standing on a hill in the parissi of St. Cleer, (described and figured by Norden in his Survey,) the covering stone being 16 feet long, and 10 wide; and one standing about a mile west of Castle-Andinas, near St.Columb, called the Giant's-Quoit, now used as a pig-stye.

Another large quantity of celts, with spear-heads and broken pieces of copper swords, with several lumps of metal, weighing altogether about 80 pounds, were discovered in the parissi of St.Hilary, about the year iSoo.x Leland also mentions spear-heads and swords made of copper, and battle-axes, (probably celts,) as having been found in the parissi of St.Hilary, before he went into Cornwall. In the year 1812, a quantity of celts were found, with a sword of the fame mixed metal, in a meadow called Long- Moor, belonging to Lanhern-house, in the parissi of Mawgan.y Caves. \u2014 Several artificial caves, or subterraneous passages, have been discovered in Cornwall, consisting of long galleries, running in various directions, formed of upright stones, with others laid across. Three of these are particularly described by Dr.Borlase, one of them in the tenement of Bolleit, in the parissi of St.Burian, about seven feet high, and 36 feet from end to end, with another branching out on one side ; another called the Giants'-holt, in the tenement of Bodinar, in the parissi of Sancred ; and the third, called Pendeen-Vau, the most entire and curious of them, consisting of three caves or galleries z; these he supposes to have been places of retreat for the Britons, and for securing their valuables in times of war and danger. A more extensive work of this kind has been discovered since Dr. Borlase's time, near Trelowarren, consisting of several galleries, one of them 60 feet long, four feet wide, and five feet six inches high, being formed of rough stones, narrowing towards the top, which is covered with large blocks of stone, and entrance-passages formed by upright stones, with others laid across ; but the exact form and extent of this work cannot at present be ascertained, much of it being filled up with rubbissi3.

They appear to be very rude imitations of the Greek coins of Philip, some of them having a head on one side, with a garland or diadem, and what appears to have been intended for a chariot on the other, though very imperfectly and rudely expressed, and hardly any thing more than a horse, a wheel, and a slight indication of the charioteer appearing : none of them had inscriptions ; some were flat, others a little convex on one side, and concave on the other. Dr. Borlase conceives that they are all British, and struck before the time of the Roman invasion11: they bear a great resemblance to the ancient Gaulissi coins. In 1783, one of the ancient British ornaments of gold, in the form of a crescent, with a narrow zigzag pattern slightly engraved on it, and weighing two ounces, four pennyweights, and six grains, was discovered near the remains of one of the circular earth-works, in the neighbourhood of Penzance : this curious relick, which is in the possession of Rose Price, Esq., is represented in the annexed plate. A circle of brass, about six inches in diameter, inlaid with gems, and orna mented with a zigzag pattern, ssiaded with dots, was found in a stream-work, called Trenoweth, in 1 802, and is now in the possession of William Rassileigh, Esq.= Inscribed Stones. \u2014 There are to be seen, in several parts of Cornwall, rude upright stones of granite, with inscriptions, which may be referred to a period antecedent to the Norman Conquest, and some of them to the time of the Romans : one of these now serves as a gate-post at the vicarage-house of St.Cle ments, near Truro ; the inscription runs thus, \u2014 \" Ifnioc Vital, fili.

In a croft, about half a mile to the north-west of Lanyon, in the parish of Maddern, lies a large sepulchral stone, nine feet ten inches long, called by the Cornissi, Men firyfaf (the inscribed stone).

Near the church of Mawgan in Meneage stands an upright stone, commonly called Mawgan-Cross, on one side of which is an inscription, now nearly obli terated, only three or four letters being legible : it is figured in Borlase's Anti quities (p. 391. pi. 35. f. 5), where the inscription is thus given: \" Cnegumifil \u2014 Enans.\" ' Dr. Borlase describes11 a stone nine feet long, and two feet three inches wide, which was formerly a foot-bridge, near Lord Falmouth's seat of Worthy vale, but afterwards placed upright in the pleasure-ground, with this inscription : \" Catin hie iacet filius Magari \u2014 :\" the battle in which King Arthur was mortally wounded, having been fought near Worthy vale, this stone has been, by some, supposed to relate to that event ; and the last word erroneously read Maguri, (quasi magni Arthuri.y In the parissi of St. Cleer, about three quarters of a rnile nearly west of the church, in a close called Pennant, is a tumulus, on which stands the lower part of a cross, with some braided ornaments, now nearly obliterated, called, \" The other half-stone,\" from an idea which formerly prevailed, that this was part of the stone above described, lying between Fowey and Lostwithiel.

Dr. Borlase supposes this stone to have been sepulchral, and erected by desire of the deceased \" ; and, indeed, its situation on a tumulus leaves little room for doubting it : the inscription is much less perfect than it appears to have been in Dr. Borlase's time.

Cornwall has produced few Roman antiquities, except coins, which of late years have been discovered, in great abundance, in the western part of the county : spear-heads, swords, and other weapons of mixt metal, neatly executed, and evidently Roman, have also been frequently found in the ancient mines and stream-works ; and from the circumstance of lumps of metal, and fragments of weapons being found with the largest quantities of them, it is most probable, that there was a considerable manufactory of them in the neighbourhood of the mines.

In 1723, at Kerris, in the parissi of St.Paul, a vault was discovered eight feet long, and six feet high, paved with stone ; within which was a small urn of the finest red clay, full of earth, and some small brass coins. In 1735, on Helford haven, in the tenement of Condorah, were found 24 gallons of Roman copper coins of the age of Constantine ; and on the other side of the haven, on one of the creeks which run up into the parissi of Constantine, 40 Roman coins, among which were those of Domitian, Trajan, and the younger Faustina in brassq. About the fame time, 100 Roman copper .coins were found in the tenement of Boscastle.

CCCXXVI by observing that, of the places mentioned by Richard of Cirencester, either in his map, or his 16th iter, as situated in this part of the country, Halangium. Tamara, and Cenen, have been fixed at Helston, Tamerton, and Tregony, from the resemblance of names only, the weakest foundation on which an antiquarian system can be raised ; the sites of Musidunum and Voluba are utterly unkown ; and the barbarous list of these western towns in the Geographer Revennas, such as Giano, Eltabo, and Nemetotacio, sets all conjecture at defiance; while, on the other hand, the only post which the form of the vallum, the remains of coins, pater\u00e6, &c. prove decidedly to have been garrisoned by the Romans7, has had no name assigned to it by our boldest antiquarians ; and Lestwithiel, Condore, and Stratton, which are supposed by several writers to have been stations of the fame people, labour under equal difficulty. Roads, or fragments of roads, are met with in all parts of the county ; one, which there seems every reason to rank among the earliest in the island, runs along the hills, attended by barrows from the Land's-end, by Redruth, Michel, and the ridge of the hills over St.Columb's, &c. towards Stratton, and the north of Cornwall ; passing in its course, not far from the Roman fortification of Bossens, and (what Borlase with some reason supposes) the great British one of Carnbre. This road I have no hesitation in supposing to be British, of which it has all the distinguissiing marks. Two, if not three, Roman roads enter, or are supposed to enter, Cornwall from Devonssiire : the first was the continuation of the great western road from Dor chester and Exeter, which has been clearly traced over Hall-down, towards Newton, and marks of which are said to have been found at Brent, leading to Nacker's-hole, and St.Budeaux, near Tamerton, the supposed Tamara of the itineraries ; it is lost after crossing the Tamar, in the enclosed lanes between Saltassi and Lissieard ; but on ascending the downs to the west of Lissieard, traces of it are reported to be seen, in its old lines, attended with many barrows, and pointing to a ford a little below the present bridge of Lestwithiel : from thence, it is conjectured to have proceeded by St.Austell and Grampound, near the last of which it passes a farm called Caervofa, to Truro, (the town of the three roads in Cornissi) ; beyond this it may have passed to the Roman Camp at Bossens, where traces of a road in the fame direction are visible, pointing, as is supposed, to St.Michael's Mount, (the Ictis of Diodorus Siculus)% from whence the tin of the Britons was conveyed, by a voyage of four days, to the continent ; and at any rate must have been a position which neither the Romans nor any other strangers meaning to settle on the Cornissi coast, could possibly have overlooked. \u00bb See the account of the camp at Bossens, Borlase's Antiq. p. 316. * Seep. 138. Traces"], [289, "CORNWALL. CCCXXVII Traces of another road have been discovered, as if coming from Torrington and the north of Devon towards Stratton, and marks of it are evident at West- Leigh, descending the hill in Stratton parissi, strait, of the width of 10 feet, but disused, and overgrown with briars : from Stratton it is conjectured to have led towards Bude-haven, which, from its situation, must in early times have been a harbour of considerable importance. The existence of the third road is more problematical than either of the others, depending chiefly on a ridge of a mile in length, bearing the appearance of a Roman military way, between Stratton and Launceston, near a village which takes the name of Broadridge. Our knowledge of the Roman stations in this county is, if possible, still more defective than that of their roads. There is a certainty of one at Bossens, in the parissi of St.Erth; from the square form of the entrenchment, the traces of a road, and the coins and other antiquities peculiar to that people. It seems to be allowed by all our antiquaries, that a second must have been situated at or near Stratton a; and a third is not unlikely to have been at Condora, which lies on a neck of land in Helford harbour, that has been fortified by a vallum drawn from sea to sea, and where many gallons of small Roman coins, such as were used for the payment of the troops, have been discovered. The situation of Cambre, in the centre of the mining country ; of Mount's-bay, for conducting the tin trade ; and of Launceston, for an important pass over the Tamar ; added to the antiquity of all, and the coins found at two of them, have led several writers to conclude the fame with respect to them : but if it be difficult to point out the situation of the Roman settlements in this county, it is still more so to determine their names ; nor is it possible to reconcile the towns, which are mentioned by the ancient geographers, to the places where antiquities have been discovered, without trusting very much to conjecture. Ceneum, from resemblance of name chiefly, has been fixed at Tregony ; but, from the situation of Condora, and the discovery of coins above-mentioned, there seems to be better reason for placing it there. Voluba, which seems to be somewhere on the river Vol or Fal, may be Tregony or Gram pound. Mufidunum was at or near Stratton. Halangium may have been the great British post of Carnbre, which was possessed afterwards (as the coins seem to ssiew) by the Romans. As for Termolus, Artavia, and Tamara, as they were undoubtedly in Devonssiire, we are not at present concerned with them ; and Uxela, which some of our Antiquaries have conjectured to be Lestwithiel, appears from Richard to have been on the Parret, in Somersetssiire. a The exact spot is unknown : the square area near Stratton was the site of a modern house. f f 2 Borlase"], [290, "CORNWALL. CCCXXVIII Borlase speaks of a bank extending for seven miles, from Fowey to West-Looe, and known by the name of the Giant's-hedge z; and of another bank between Fowey and Bodmin ; both of which, but the latter especially, he is inclined to suppose remains of ancient roads ; but the former is more likely to have been one of the boundaries of a tribe settled in early times on the coast, of which we have so many instances in Cambridgessiire and other parts of England ; and the second we may pronounce more decidedly to have been a work of the same kind, as it bears every mark of having been the frontier of the Carnubii against their invaders the Danmonii, drawn (as an inspection of the map will prove) in the only part of their line which was not strong by nature ; extending, in the manner of a rampart, from the sea to the river Alan, and defended evidently by three certain British posts, at Pencarrow, Castle-Kynoc, and Castledor.\" Ancient Church Architcclure. Saxon. \u2014 Several of the Cornissi churches retain traces of Saxon architecture, and some of them exhibit curious specimens of that style : the most considerable remains of this kind are to be seen in the church of St. German's, formerly the cathedral of Cornwall, though that edifice has undergone considerable alterations of late years. The west front retains more of the original style than any other part of the building ; it has two towers, of different dimensions : that on the south side is square, and the upper part of it evidently of a much later date : the tower on the north side, which is the largest, is square at the base, the upper part being octagonal. Between these towers is the great western door-way, having a circular arch, enriched with various Saxon mouldings, over which is a pediment. In the octagonal tower, and over the great door-way, are several small round-headed windows. The south door-way of Morwinstow-church has a semicircular arch, ornamented with chevron mouldings, and grotesque heads : the greater part of the church is also in the Saxon style. The richest specimen of this kind in Cornwall, is the south door-way of Kilkhampton church, which is ornamented with a great variety of grotesque heads and Saxon mouldings. Door-ways with semicircular arches, and Saxon mouldings, remain in the churches of St. Anthony in Meneage, Cury, Landewednack, St. Martin near Looe, Milor, and Tintagel : and at the White Hart inn, in Launceston.3 On the north side of the nave in the church of St.Michael-Carhayes, is a small door-way with a plain semicircular arch, with the figure of a man on horseback, carved on the transom stone. 1 See p. ccxlvi. \" See p. 191, On 5"], [291, "SMSPlECIMNlENS \u00a9F SAXON AftCHITE CTU1.E UT CORN7/\"ALL. 1.

Thirteenth Century. \u2014 Of the early Gothic architecture, Cornwall produces few examples ; the most considerable of them are, the nave of the church of St. Anthony in Meneage, which has ssiarply pointed arches, with foliated capitals ; and the south aisle of St. Germans church, which was rebuilt in the year 1261, as appears by the registers of the see of Exeter : yet some parts of the architectural decorations of this aisle are more in the style of the early part of the following century. Fourteenth Century. \u2014 Great part of Sheviock church appears to have been built in this century, and probably by Sir Edward Courtenay, whose monument is under the south window of the south transept : the windows are in the elegant style which prevailed in this century ; as is the east window of the church of St. Ive, the stone-work of which is variously ramified, having on each side an elegant niche, enriched with pinnacles and crockets. The church of St. Austell, the tower of which is one of the most remarkable edifices in this county, was probably built as early as the latter end of this century : it consists of a nave and chancel, with side-aisles running the whole length, sepa rated by clustered pillars. The tower is at the west end of the church ; it has four lofty crocketted pinnacles resting on embattled turrets, much enriched with Gothic tracery. On the west side are several niches filled with images ; in the uppermost is that of God the Father, holding the crucifix ; immediately under this, are figures of angels supporting a cloth, including a number of small figures (the usual representation of All Saints) : in the middle range of niches are images of St. Gabriel and the Virgin Mary, with the Lily-pot. In the middleniche of the lower range is the image of our Saviour crowned with thorns, holding the cross in his left hand ; in the niches on each side are images of saints.

Dr. Borlase, whi.' appears to have paid much attention to the subject, thought this inscription contained the name of a founder or benefactor. (MS. Collections.)

Fifteenth"], [294, "CORNWALL. ccxxx Fifteenth Century. \u2014 The greater part of the Cornissi churches appear to have been rebuilt in the fifteenth and the following century. The most considerable building of the fifteenth century is the parissi-church of Bodmin, the greater part of which was erected in the year 1475, as is recorded by the following inscription in text hand, carved on the cornice in the south aisle : \" AfC Dni MCCCCLXXV0 edficatumfuit :\" it consists of a lofty nave and side aisles, separated by clustered pillars (the capitals of which are ornamented with roses) and pointed arches, forming a parallelogram of about 140 feet by 6$. The north aisle of the chancel seems to be more ancient, the windows being in the fame style as the east windowr of the south aisle of the church of St.Kewe, the painted glass of which was taken out of the old church at Bodmin, when it was rebuilt ; the pulpit and scats are covered with a profusion of carved ornaments, among which are the symbols of the crucifixion, which appear very frequently on the seats and other parts of the Cornissi churches, and among them a remarkable one sometimes occurs, being St. Peter's sword with the High Priest's servant's ear attached to it. It appears by an indenture, preserved among the archives of the corporation of Bodmin, that the seats were made \" after the form and makyng of the seges in St. Mary church of Plympton, and the pulpyte after the form and makyng of the pulpyte in the parissi-church of Moreton in Hemsted,\" by Matthew More, carpenter, who was to be paid for the fame the sum of 92I. The church of St.Kewe, St.Burian, Fowey, and Padftow, are handsome build ings, apparently of this century ; that of St.Kew seems to have been built about the fame time as Bodmin church, which it resembles in style ; the tower of Fowey church is lofty, with pinnacles, and ornamented with bands of Gothic tracery ; on the south side is a large groined porch, with a room over it. The church of Padstow has pointed arches and clustered pillars, the capitals of which are enriched with foliage, and other ornaments carved with great neatness. Sixteenth Century. \u2014 Camborne-church is a handsome building, which may be referred to the beginning of the sixteenth, or the latter end of the preceding century ; it has a nave and side-aisles, with clustered pillars, and obtusely pointed arches. The capitals of the pillars are ornamented with foliage, in a manner which is very prevalent in the Cornissi churches, a specimen of which is ssiewn in the plate,at p.ccxxxii. fig.2. The church of St.Just in Penwith has clustered pillars and obtusely pointed arches ; the capitals being variously ornamented with vine leaves and shields of arms : the pillars are of a lime-stone, nearly resembling that of the Gloucesterssiire hills.

The most remarkable building in Cornwall, in the style of the later Gothic, is Launceston church, which is built of granite, and covered with a profusion of ornaments, chiefly pomegranates ; on the south side is a large porch, with a room over it ; on the front are figures of St. George and St.Martin, carved in bas-relief: round the base of the building is a range of shields, each of which contains a letter ; the whole forming the following inscription, which begins from the small door on the south side : \u2014 \" Ave Maria grade plena, Dominus tecum fponfas, Amat fponfam Maria, Optimam partem elegit, 0 quam terribilis ac metuendus ejl~ lotus ijle, vere aliud non ejl hie, nisi domus Dei et porta celi.\" Ancient painted Glass. \u2014 In the windows of the church of St.Kew, which appears to have been rebuilt in the fifteenth century, are considerable remains of painted glass, evidently coeval with the building, containipg various historical subjects from' the New Testament, portraits of benefactors' arms, roses, &c. The east window of the south aisle, consisting of five lights, is nearly filled with rich painted glass of an earlier date, representing the favourite subject of the root of Jesse, at the bottom of the middle light, with several branches, containing figures of the Virgin and child Solomon, Manasses, Josophat, &c. From the style of the crown and sceptre in their hands, this appears to have been a work of the fourteenth century, and was formerly part of the decoration of Bodmin church, from which it was removed, when that edifice was rebuilt ; having been fold to the parissi of St. Kew for the sum of 26s. 76., as appears by the accounts of the rebuilding Bodmin church, from 1469 to 1471, among the corporation records.0 The windows of St. Neot's church are nearly filled with painted glass, which, from several fragments of inscriptions remaining in them, appears to have been placed there in the early part of the sixteenth century. In the six windows on the south side of the south aisle, are many portraits of benefactors, some of them in groups, with labels on their heads, inscribed, \" See Neote, ora pro nobis. See Leonarde, ora pro nobis, &c. ;\" the figures of which saints are represented over them. In one of these windows are twelve compartments, containing different subjects from the history of St. George, very coarsely executed, with inscriptions under them in text hand.

The windows of the north aisle also con tain many portraits of benefactors and figures of saints, with inscribed labels : under one of these windows is the fragment of an inscription in text hand, by which it appears to have been executed iifumptibus uxorum parochi\u0153.\" d One of them contains, in twelve small compartments, various subjects from the legend of St.Neot, with inscriptions under them.c The east window of the south aisle of St. Winnow church is nearly silled with painted glass, containing many portraits of knights in plate armour and surcoats, wi th figures of saints over them. Rood-lofts, Screens, &c. \u2014 In St.Buryan's church is a richly ornamented screen and rood-loft, running across the church, under which are four wooden stalls. The screen of a rood-loft also remains in Duloe church. In Tywardreth church is a richly ornamented screen, on the lower part of which are paintings of figures in white robes, holding the symbols of the crucifixion. In South-Petherwin church are some remains of a very richly ornamented rood-loft. In Lancels church the seats are richly ornamented with carved Gothic tracery, the symbols of the cruci fixion, &c; and the lower part of the screen remains, on which are figures of the apostles rudely painted. In the church of Mawgan in Pyder, is the screen of a rood-loft, extending across the nave and the south aisle, very richly ornamented with carved scrolls of vine branches, animals of various kinds, and Gothic tracery, the gift of one of the Arundell family, whose arms appear on it. The pulpit in Camborne church is much enriched with carved ornaments, among which are the symbols of the crucifixion and the royal arms, apparently a work of the early part of the sixteenth century. The pulpit at Padstow has also the symbols of the crucifixion, and among them St. Peter's sword, with the High Priest's servant's ear. The pulpit in Tamerton church is ornamented with Gothic tracery, quatrefoils inclosing shields, &c. ; and over it, is a richly ornamented Gothic canopy, with gilt ornaments on a blue ground. d Dr.Borlase (MS.

Fonts. \u2014 Of the fonts in the Cornissi churches, a considerable number may be referred to the time when the Saxon architecture prevailed ; the greater part of these are round, many of them quite plain, while others are ornamented with mouldings resembling those which appear on the Saxon door-ways : the most remarkable of this class, are those in the churches of St.Enoder, St. Erme, Feock, Fowey, Ladock, St.Mawgan, Lanreath, Mevagizzey, St.Stephen's-juxta- Launceston, Whitstone, and St.Nighton's chapel : those of Alternon, Calling ton, Jacobstow, Laneast, Landrake, St.Thomas near Launceston, and Warbstow, are all nearly alike, being square at the top, with human heads at the corners, and circles inclosing stars on the sides, supported by serpents, &c. : that of Warbstow is figured in the annexed plate. The font in Bodmin church is of large dimensions, being three feet seven inches in height, and three feet five inches and a half diameter at the top: it is in the form of a bowl, supported by a pedestal in the middle, and four slender pillars on the outside. This font is covered with ornaments in the Saxon style, consisting of grotesque animals, foliage, &c: the pillars have angels' heads for capitals: their bases, as well as that of the pedestal, are in the style of the earliest Gothic archi tecture/ Adjoining this font is an octagonal Piscina with eight apertures, orna mented with roses, &c.

The fonts of Boconnoc, Cubert, Grade, St. Illogan, Landewednack, St.Martin juxta-Looe, and Padstow, are nearly in the fame form as those last described, but evidently of a much later date, and ornamented with stars, trefoils, &c; that of St. Illogan has angels with shields, as capitals of the pillars.

It is an altar-tomb of alabaster, much enriched with Gothic tracery ; at the foot of which is a shield of arms, sur rounded by the garter, containing the coats of Willoughby and Broke, quartering Latimer, Cheney, and Stafford. On this tomb rests the effigies of the deceased, who is represented in plate-armour, with long hair, in the mantle of the garter, with the collar and gorget, and his hands joined in prayer : under his head is his helmet, with the lamberquin, and crest, a stag's head : at his feet is a lion. This Lord Willoughby de Broke married Blanch, daughter and coheir of John Champernowne. In Fowey church is a large slab of Purbeck marble, with the effigies of three men in plate-armour, rudely cut in outline, with their arms (a chevron betweea three trees ; and an inscription, in memory of \" Sir John Treffry, Knt., William Treffry, and Thomas Treffry, Esqrs., brethren, that died in the month of Sep tember; the said Sir John in the 16th year, the said Sir William in the 20th year of King Henry VII., and the said Thomas, the 1st of King Henry VIII.\" At the east end of the north aisle in Bodmin church, is an altar-tomb of stone, with the effigies of a bissiop in his pontificals, having angels supporting his head, and holding shields of arms ; there are two more angels at his feet, also holding shields of arms. Round the verge of the slab on which the effigies rests, is the following inscription, in text hand: \u2014 \" Hie tumulatus venera'dus pater Tomas Vivian"], [311, ""], [312, "F/ Bmnct's M"], [313, "\u25a0 near Lanivet.

In Tywardreth church is a slab, with a crofs-floree, and an inscription for Thomas Colyns, prior of Tywardreth, who died in 1532. There are in the Cornissi churches a great number of sepulchral monuments of the sixteenth century, consisting of large slabs of slate with the effigies, fre quently of whole families, carved in bas-relief, sometimes as large as life, and for the most part very coarsely. Remains of Monastic Buildings. Very few traces of monastic buildings at present remain in Cornwall, except those parts of the church of St. German's priory, which have been already noticed. No part of Bodmin priory is now standing, but capitals of pillars in the Saxon style, and other architectural fragments, and parts of gravestones have been dug up, about 150 yards south-east of the parissi-church, in the garden of Walter Ralegh Gilbert, Esq., which, from these discoveries, appears to occupy the site of the priory church. Great part of the buildings of the priory on St. Michael's Mount are standing, but internally they retain little of their original appearance ; the present dining-room, which is ornamented with a frieze, on which are repre sentations of the hunting of various animals, is said to have been the refectory of the convent, and appears to have been altered about the middle of the seventeenth century.* Of the monastery of St. Benet's, near Lanhivet, there are considerable remains, now occupied as a dwelling-house ; the tower of the church is also standing. The chapel of St. Lawrence's hospital, near Bodmin, remains, with clustered pillars and pointed arches. Caflles and Sites of Cajlles. In the county of Cornwall, we find the remains of several rude circular build ings on the summits of hills, still denominated castles ; the walls of which having been originally built of stones, without mortar, are now thrown down, and lying in a ridge : of these Dr. Borlase fays, that in the narowest part of Cornwall, from St. Michael's Mount to the Lands'-end, there are no fewer than seven ; the most remarkable of them are Caerbran castle, in Sancred ; castle Andinas in Grose's Antiq., vol. viii., p. 37 , id edit. 7 Ludgvan,"], [316, "ccxxxviii CORNWALL. Ludgvan, and Chun castle in Morvah. The diameter of the circular wall of Caerbran castle is 90 paces, surrounded by a ditch 15 yards wide; beyond which is a vallum of earth 15 feet high, with a ditch 15 feet wide\\ Castle Andinas, standing on the highest hill in the hundred of Penwith, Dr. Borlase fays, con sisted of t\u00abo stone walls, built one within the other, in a circular form : the ruins he describes, as fallen on each side of the wall, ssiewing the work to have been of great height and thickness ; he also mentions a third wall, built more than half way round, but left unfinissiedc: the diameter of the whole was 400 feet, and the principal ditch 60 feet wide. The most regular work of this kind is Chu.n castle, which stands on an eminence, above the Atlantic ocean, and commanding a very extensive view of the Bristol channel, Mounts bay, &c : it is of an oval form, consisting of two walls, now thrown down, and forming high ridges of stones ; the inner area is 1 25 feet from east to west, and 1 10 from north to south. Dr. Borlase, who no doubt ascertained that point, by the removal of some of the stones, fays, that the outer wall is five feet in thickness, the inner one eight, but thicker near the foundation. The outer wall is surrounded by a ditch, and between the two walls is a ditch 30 feet wided : the Doctor describes a line of stone work at the distance of 30 feet from the inner wall, divided by several cross walls, parallel with it ; but little of this part of the work is at present to be seen : the entrance faces west-south-west : from the ruins of the wads, Dr. Borlase supposed that the outermost could not have been less that 10 feet high, and the innermost about 15. About 500 yards north-west of Chun castle, stands the Cromlech, already described'. Dr.Borlase also mentions several cliff castles being stone wallc, stretching across necks of land from cl ff to cliff, as that called Castle Treryn, in the parish of St.Levan ; the cape called Tolpedn-Penwith ; the castles Karnjek and Boscjell in the parissi of St.Just, and many others on the sea-coast.f Launceston castle, formerly the chief seat of the Eatls ot Cornwall, and supposed, with gre:it probability, to occupy the site of a Roman station, was much dilapidated when it came into the possession of the Black Prince, in the reign of King Edward III., as appears by the survey taken at thai time2. Little now remains of the base court, except the gate-house, a small tower, and part of the outer walls, all much decayed.

The form of the outer wall approaches to an oval ; its external dimensions are 78 feet by 70. The space between this wall and the inner tower varies in width, from six feet to ten feet three inchesg. Dr. Borlase says, that there was a third wall not quite three feet thick, at the distance of six feet from the wall last described, supposed to have been a kind of breast-work, very little of which remained in his time ; and Norden represents such a wall in the figure of this castle, given in his survey of Cornwall ; yet, from the present appearance of the mount, which is very steep, quite from the foundation of the second tower, it is difficult to imagine how a third wall could have been so constructed, as to have included a much less space in width than six feet. There was a steep flight of steps leading up the south side of the mount, to the entrance into the tower on the top, between two walls, having originally a roof covered with lead : Dr. Borlase, in whose time much of this gallery remained, fays, that the passage was seven feet wide, and that the walls were pierced with narrow windows. The record of 11 Edward III. above alluded to, mentions two covered-ways as connected with the tower of the keep. In the inner tower, the walls of which are ten sect thick, weTe two rooms 1 8 feet 6 inches in diameter, divided by a floor of timber ; the lower one being a dungeon, without any light : in the upper room was a fire-place on the north side : the space between the two towers was covered with a flat roof, level with the floor of the upper chamber of the inner tower : a late learned writer has controverted Dr. Borlase's assertion on this subject, and attempted to prove that there could not have been such a roof ; not aware of the clear indications of it which exist, for the holes in which the beams of that roof were inserted still remain all round the tower. Some of the door- ways in the Keep have round arches, others are rudely pointed. From the print in Norden's survey, there appears to have been a wall round the base of the mount in his lime (in the reign of Jac. I.) Of the date of this curious edisice, nothing is known ; it was certainly in existence at the time of the Norman conquest, and probably long before ; and as it exhibits no trace of Saxon ornament, there seems good reason for Dr. Borlase's opinion, that it was a British work, and the chief residence of the Cornu-Britissi princes. One convincing proof of its great age, is the state of decay, in which \u2022 See the annexed plan and section, obligingly communicated by Lieut.

CCXL it appears to have been, notwithstanding its massy structure, in the early part of the fourteenth century. What has been said by several writers of Launceston castle having been built by William Moreton, Earl of Cornwall, must apply to the buildings of the base-court, the gate-house of which, still remaining in ruins, has a pointed arch : there was a covered way 1 20 feet in length across the ditch, leading to the gate ; much of which appears to have been standing, when the views in Buck's Antiquities and Dr. Borlase's work were taken. Carnbre castle, which stands at the eastern end of Carnbre hill, on some of the great masses of granite with which that hill abounds, is a small irregular building, being not quite 60 feet long, and about 10 feet wide ; only part of the building is ancient, the masonry of which is very rude : the modern part has probably been built on ancient foundations.11 Tintagel castle, situated partly on the extremity of a bold rock of slate on the northern coast of the county, and partly on a rocky ifland, with which it was formerly connected by a draw bridge, has been generally considered as a building of very great antiquity ; but so little at present remains of its ruins, as to bafle all conjecture as to the time when it was erected, from the style of its architec ture ; it is however certain, that it was in a dilapidated state at the time of the survey made in the eleventh year of King Edward III., wherein it is described as a certain castle sufficiently walled, in which were two chambers beyond the two gates in a decayed state ; one chamber, with a small kitchen, for the con stable, in good repair ; one stable for eight horses, decayed ; one cellar and bakehouse, ruinous : the timber of the great hall had been taken down by com mand of John Earl of Cornwall, because the hall was ruinous, and the walls thereof of no value. Trematon castle, which, in the reign of King William Rufus, was held by the family of Valletort, under the Earl of Cornwall, is situated on an eminence, above the river Lynher, having a base-court, surrounded with an embattled wall and ditch of an irregular form, following the ftape of the hill on which it stands, and pierced with loop-holes, some long and narrow, some square, and others in the form of a cross. On the east side is the principal entrance : over the gateway is a large room with a chimney-piece, the ornaments of which are in the style of the early Gothic. The Keep of this castle stands on an artificial mount at the north east corner of the base-court, about thirty feet high ; which, on the outside, has a natural base of considerable height ; below which, are the remains of some strong outworks. The building of the Keep has an embattled wall 10 feet thick and 30 feet high ; the form of which is nearly oval, but less curved on the north 11 See a plan of this building, in Borlase's Antiq., pi. vii., p. 1 17, side :"], [323, ""], [324, ""], [325, "Cast/,- \u25a0"], [326, ""], [327, "rr/,/,/,'/ Castle. \u25a0'ufi/uA,;/ M.w-J: -\u25a0 I I W Strand"], [328, ""], [329, "Z^it..-/t&{ 3farak i.jSjj, iy T. caddl A W-Davies .

The apartments in this keep, must, as Dr. Borlase observes11, have been lighted from a little court or well, in the centre, as there are no windows in the exterior wall of the building. In the survey of the 1 1 Edw. III., this castle is described as well walled, and containing a hall, a kitchen, and lodging-chamber, which Edmund, formerly Earl of Cornwall, erected : the wralls of which were of plaster, and a certain ancient chapel within the gate of the castle. Of Restormel castle, the ancient scat of the baronial family of Cardinan, which came into the possession of the Earls of Cornwall, towards the latter end of the thirteenth century, the only part now remaining is the keep, a circular building of large dimensions, situated on a steep mount, formed out of a rocky hill, with a deep ditch : \" the outer wall or rampart of the keep is an exact circle of no feet diameter within, and 10 feet wide at the top, including the thickness of the parapet, which is two feet six inches. From the present floor of the ground rooms to the top of the rampart, is 27 feet 6 inches ; and to the top of the parapet, 7 feet higher, garretted quite round. There are three stair-cases leading to the top of the rampart, one on each side of the gateway, ascending from the court within, and one betwixt the inner and outermost gate : the rooms are 19 feet wide, the windows mostly in the innermost wall ; but there are some very large openings in the outmost wall or rampart, now walled up.\"' These openings which have pointed arches, and the gateway and chapel, both of which project from the circular keep, and have also pointed arches, are supposed to have been additions, made by Richard, Earl of Cornwall, King of the Romans, in the reign of King Henry III. \" The offices,\" Dr. Borlase observes, \" lay below in the bass-court, where signs of many ruins to the north and east were in his time apparent, and ssiewed that this castle was of great extent.* \" At the time of the survey, in the reign of King Edward III., there were within the keep a hall, three chambers, and as many upper-chambers, one chapel with two bells, three chambers over the gateway, in a decayed state, covered with lead ; the gates at the entrance were also decayed. There were, without the gateway of the castle, one great hall, with two upper chambers, and one chapel, in good condition : the kitchen, and a certain stair-case, leading from the hall to the kitchen, were out of repair. There were also three chambers, with three upper-chambers over them,. and a bakehouse, in bad condition ; and two stables for 20 horses, on each side of the gateway, old and ruinous ; and there was a certain' conduit of lead, through which water was conveyed into every part of the castle.1 h Antiquities, p. 3 J4.

Below the town of Fowey, on each side of the haven, is a square tower, built, as we are informed by Leland, in the reign of King Edward IV., for the protec tion of the haven, having a chain to be drawn across : these towers were out of repair in the reign of King Henry VIII., as appears by the ancient chart of the southern coast of England, drawn at that time, preserved in the Britissi Museum.\u2122 \" Two links of the boom or chain, which ran across the harbour, were taken up by a trawl boat, about the year 1776,\" n and are now preserved in the grotto at Menabilly. St. Catherine's castle at Fowey, St.Mawes castle, and that of Pendennis, were all built in the reign of King Henry VIII., and resemble other castles or block houses, erected by that monarch for the defence of the southern coast.0 About three-quarters of a mile west of Kilkhampton church, is the site of a strong fortress, called the Castle-hill, consisting of a very steep oval mount, divided into three parts by deep ditches. Ancient Manfion-Houses. Of Place-house, the ancient seat of the Treffry family, in the town of Fowey, a considerable part still remains, though the \" right fair and strong embattled tower,\" mentioned by Leland, and which appears from a drawing in Dr. Borlase's manuscript collections, to have been standing in the year 1752, does not now exist. Leland fays that Thomas Treffry, \" embateling all the waulls of the house, in a manner made it a castelle, and unto this day (temp. Henry VIII.) it is the glorie of the town building in.

On the south side a bow-window still remains, very richly ornamented with Gothic tracery. The hall, which has a flat ceiling of oak,' richly ornamented, ap pears, from a date under a coat of arms, to have been fitted up in the year 1575 ; long since which period, the greater part of this building has been much altered internally.

About the middle of the last century, when this building was visited by Dr. Borlase they appear to have been pretty well preserved ; and as they serve to ssiew the style of decoration then in use, we shall insert in a note the Doctor's description of them from his manuscript collections above-mentioned. q The following may serve as a specimen of the proverbs and verses.

The first recommends loyalty to the King. The second aflerts the happiness of a kingdom, when served by faithful ministers. The third, how tender and careful a Prince should be of the iafety of his subjects ; comparing an affectionate sovereign to a dolphin, (a fi(h always remarkable for his love to the human species,) and at the fame time, probably, intimating how happy the master of this house was,*in the affection and kindness he met with from Godolphin house, (of which family a dolphin is the crest,) whence he married his lady. (See Leland, Itin. vol. iii. p. 6.) The fourth asserts the sacred ties of marriage, and how wantonly they had been violated by lome late divorces, alluding, probably, to the divorce of Henry VIII. from Queen Catherine. In the picture relating hereunto are represented, first, the proper emblems of marriage, \u2014 the gentleman giving his right hand to the lady ; a picture of no contemptible hand, and surely a strong testimony it is of the con jugal affection and domestic happiness of this Militon and his lady. On each side of this picture is a mansion-house ; the one (by what is still remaining) evidently the dwelling-house commonly called Pengerfick Castle, as it then stood ; the other is the house whence the lady married to Militon, lord of Pengersick, proceeded, and I take it to be the old house of Godolphin, as it was in those times. The fifth truth inculcated is, that as the wants of mankind are mutual, so ought to be their assistances of each other ; very properly exhibited to U6 in the blind man's carrying the lame on his back. The sixth, that nothing is difficult or impossible to the willing and industrious.

Ancient Crosses. Every part of Cornwall abounds with ancient stone crosses, not only in the church-yards, but on the moors and other situations remote from any habitation ; some of the most remarkable of them are exhibited in the annexed plate, in which fig. 1. represents a very rude one in the church-yard at St. Roche : fig. 2. the cross standing by the turnpike-road side on Temple-Moor, called the Four-hole cross, from the four openings by which the cross at the top is formed ; this has been ornamented all round with scrolls, which are much defaced : fig-3- the cross in Sancreet church-yard, having on one side a rude sculpture of the crucifixion, in bas-relief, and ornamented in the Saxon style : fig. 4. a very curious ancient cross, which originally stood in the Chapel-close of the barton of Roscworthy, in the parissi of Gwinnear, from whence it was removed, some years since, to the garden of Lord Arundell's mansion-house, at Lanherne, where it now stands ; on one side is a rude sculpture of the crucifixion, under which is a braid, and an inscription, apparently Saxon, of which this figure exhibits a sac-simile : and in fig. 5. is ssiewn another inscription, on the opposite side of the cross: fig. 6. a Gothic crofs^ standing in the church-yard of Mawgan in Pyder, on the east side of Which is a niche containing the crucifixion, sculptured in pretty high relief. In the niche on the west side is carved a subject, taken, no doubt, from some legend, consisting of the figures of a King and Oueen. She is in the dress of the fourteenth century, kneeling, on one side, before a dessi ; on the other side is a large bolt, with a serpent coiled round it, which seems to be biting the face of the King, whilst an angel holds its tail. In the church-yard of Lanivet are two ancient stone crosses, one about ten teet high, standing on the north side of the church, enriched on both sides with various ornaments, chiefly braids, much defaced by time; the other, which is about eleven feet high, stands near the west end of the church, having at the top a cross upon an open circle, leaving four holes, like that on Temple-Moor, which it much resembles in the style of its ornaments, which are scrolls. Near the inscribed stone in the parissi of St. Cleer, mentioned in p.ccxxiii, stands the lower part of an ancient cross, ornamented with braids, called the other Half-stone, from a supposition that is belonged to another fragment in a different part of the county.

Small chapels or oratories, erected over wells or springs of water, to which extraordinary virtues have been ascribed, abound in most parts of Cornwall, the greater part of them in ruins; that of Mena-cuddle, near St. Austell, remains pretty entire ; it is a small Gothic building, nine feet by five feet six inches within the walls, having a groined roof ; neatly moulded door-ways on the north and south sides, with pointed arches, and a small window on the west side : the well is on the east side, one foot two inches in width. Over St.Agnes' well, in Chapclcomb, in the parissi of St.Agnes, is a plain Gothic building of stone, about eight feet wide in the front, where is an opening with an obtuse arch. There is an ancient stone building over the well of St.Cleer, situated about a quarter of a mile north of the church ; and St.Piran's well, in the parissi of PerranZabuloe. The oratory over St.Levan's well is five feet square and seven feet high. The largest building of this kind stands near Horse-bridge, in the parissi of St.Dominick, being 10 feet wide, and about 15 in height, ornamented with pinnacles. Camps and Earth-works. The county of Cornwall abounds more, perhaps, than any other part of England, with ancient camps and earth-works ; the greater part of them nearly round or oval. In many places on the coast, a single vallum is seen stretching across from the edge of one cliff to that of another, with a ditch next the land ; the most remarkable of these are the little Dinas, in the parissi of Sr. Anthony in Meneage, the space inclosed within which is about 50^ yards by 200 ;s and the remains of a vallum, about half a mile north-west of Tehidy, the seat of Lord de Dunstanville, having a double ditch, the area inclosed within which has been much reduced by the falling of the cliff. At Pennare or Penarth is a double entrenchment, inclosing 100 acres, running east and west, from cliff to cliff, across the promontory called the Deadman. Dr.Borlase describes a vallum in the parissi of St.Agnes, called the kledh (signify ing in Cornissi, the trench,) extending nearly two miles in length, from Porth- Chapel-Comb to Breanik-Comb, in some parts 20 feet high, with a ditch 17 feet 6 inches wide'. \" To the west of St.Agnes' beacon,\" Dr.Borlase says, \" are still to be seen the remains of a small square fortification, adjacent to which are three sepulchral barrows.\" There are considerable remains of a vallum called the Giant's Hedge,which appears to have been originally about seven milesandahalf in length, extending, in an irregular line, from the river Looe, a little above the town of West-Looe, to Leryn, from which place it remains for the space of nearly four miles, when it fails, and does not appear again till within a mile of West-Looe. 5 Borlase's Antiq. p. 312.

Dr. Borlase describes a Roman fort at Bossens, in the parissi of St.Erth, with a single vallum 152 feet by 130.\" In the hundred of Stratton are several ancient camps of an oval form, with a single vallum ; the largest of these is Assibury, in the parissi of Week St. Mary, the area within the vallum containing four acres, and extending 27perches, from east to west and 24 from north to south. East-Leigh-Berrys, in the parissi of Launcels, consist of three oval camps, joined together in a line, with openings for communi cation between them from east to west ; that in the middle is the smallest, being only 126 feet from north to south, and 1 08 from east to west. The two others are of the fame size, each of them being 204 feet from north to south, and 144 from east to west. Yerdbury, in the parish of Stratton, is oval, the area within the banks being 327 feet from east to west, and 250 from north to south. At Swan nacot-wood, in the parissi of Week St. Mary, is a small oval fort, 150 feet by 130, the bank and ditch of which are both low. Hilton-wood Castle, in the parissi of Whitstone, is oval, the area being 2 1 5 feet by 1 70 : the vallum and ditch are very perfect ; the perpendicular height of the vallum being 14 feet, and the ditch being 12 feet wide at the bottom. Near to this, in the fame parissi, is a similar work, called Froxstone-wood Castle, the area of which is 160 fee* by 145; the perpen dicular height of the bank, 10 feet ; and the width of the ditch, at the bottom, to feet. At Grew's Hill, in the parissi of Stratton, is a circular work, 156 feet in diameter, the banks of which have been partly levelled ; where they remain, they are 10 feet high. There is a small circular work, called Winwood Castle, in the parish of Kilkhampton, 85 feet in diameter.\" On Bury-down, in the parissi of St.Neots, is a single vallum, of an oblong square form, 330 feet by 200, rounded at one corner, having some slight out works on the south side : within the area are several circles of moor-stone, irregu larly laid. The work at Binamy, in the parissi of Stratton, supposed by Dr.Borlase to have been a Roman fort, is unquestionably the moated site of a mansion-house, (the seat of the Blanchminsters), traces of which are to be seen within it : and that at Whalessiorough, also supposed by him to have been Roman, being situated in a field called Chapel-park, has been conjectured to be the remains of an ancient Borlase's Antiq. p. 316. pi. xxviii. fig. viii. w For the particulars of these earth-works in Stratton hundred, we arc indebted to Wrey J'Ans, Esq., by whom they have all been measured. chapel ;"], [346, "ccxlviii CORNWALL. chapel ; part of the walls were standing within the memory of persons now living : the dimensions of these remains are 40 feet by 18/ Cadson-Bury, near Callington, is an oval work, with a single vallum, having two entrances opposite to each other, on the south-east and north-west sides ; the area within the vallum is 700 feet by 450. Blacketon, in the parissi of Morvall, has a double vallum ; the inner one is an irregular oval, containing an area of 363 sect by 264, with an entrance on the west side : the outer vallum is of an irregular form, and its distance from the other varies considerably ; on the east side they are very near together; but on the west they are 130 feet distant from each other.

On Great Prideaux-warren, in the parissi St.Blazey, and Pader bury-top, in the parissi of St. German's, are camps of the fame kind; the one being 2.97 feet by 231, with only one entrance ; the other having an entrance on the east and weft sides. In the parish of Pelynt is a camp nearly round, with a single vallum, and a ditch ten feet deep, having an entrance on the south-east side : on the south side is an advanced rampart, extending half round, in which is also an entrance, facing that of the camp. In Dunmeer-wood, near Bodmin, is a camp with a single vallum, of an irregular oval form, and a ditch in some parts 18 feet deep, having only one entrance: the area within the vallum is 450 feet by 375. The camp in Pencarrow-park has a double vallum, the inner one oval, inclosing an area 250 feet by 200 ; the outer one of an irregular form. On the east side, at the distance of about 700 feet from this camp, are some extensive out-works. On Bury-down, in the parissi of Lanreath, is a camp of an irregular form, ap proaching to a circle, consisting of a double vallum, with an entrance on the east and west sides ; the area within the inner vallum is 277 feet by 264 : a beacon was erected within this area in the year 1804.

Borlase says, that bonfires are kindled in Cornwall on the eve of St. John Baptist's, and St.Peter's day, whence midsummer, in the Cornissi tongue, is called Goluan, which signifies both light and rejoicing. At these fires, he fays, the Cornissi attend with lighted torches, tarred and pitched at one end, making a perambulation round the fire, and go from village to village bearing their torches\". Mr. Brand fays, that the boundary of each tin-mine is marked by a long pole, with a bussi on the top of it: these on St. John's day are covered with flowers.1 At Helston, the 8th of May, the festival of the apparition of St. Michael, the patron- faint of the town, is kept as a day of rejoicing, with music, singing, dancing, and processions, under the appellation of the Furrym. Similar sports, under the fame denomination, are said to have been held at the Lizard, at Sithney, and other places. The ancient custom called the Bodmin-riding, and some remains of it which still exist, are detailed under the head of Bodmin, in the Parochial Topography, p.38. Mr. Polwhele fays, that \" the custom of saluting the apple-trees at Christmas, with a view to another year, is still preserved both in Cornwall and Devonssiire. In some places the parissiioners walk in procession, visiting the principal orchards in the parissi ; in each orchard single out the principal tree ; salute it, with a certain form of words, and sprinkle it with cyder, or dassi a bowl of cyder against it. In other places, the farmer and his workmen only, immerse cakes in cyder, and place them on the branches of an apple-tree, in due solemnity ; sprinkle the tree, as they repeat a formal incantation, and dance round it.\" \" Carew speaks of a custom which formerly prevailed at Lostwithiel, where, he fays, \" upon little Easter- Sunday, the freeholders of the towne and mannour, by themselves or their deputies, did there assemble: amongst whom, one (as it fell to his lot by turne) Carew's Survey, 68 , ist.

It seems from Dr. Borlase's account ?, that the superstition of the ancient Britons, respecting the formation of the Anguinum, or serpent's egg, as related by Pliny, or something very like it, prevailed in Cornwall, so lately as fifty years ago. The Cornissi were formerly much attached to sports and pastimes, especially the Guare -miracle, or miracle-play, wrestling, and hurling. The first is described by CareW, as \" a kind of Entrelude, compiled in Cornissi out of some Scripture history, with that Grossenes which accompanied the Romanes vetus Comedia. For representing it they raise an earthen amphitheatre, in some open field, having the diameter of his enclosed playne some 40 or 50 foot. The country people flock from\" all sides, many miles off, to heare and see it ; for they have therein devils and devices, to delight as well the eye as the eare.\" As the plays were in the Cornissi language, this pastime has of course long since ceased. The exercise of wrestling still prevails in this county, perhaps more generally than in any other part of England. The favourite pastime of the Cornissi in former times was the game of Hurling, a great trial of strength and swiftness, performed with a wooden ball covered with silver : it was played by 20 or 30 on a side, and consisted in catching the ball, and carrying it by force or sleight to the goal assigned. A very particular description of this game may be found in Carew's Survey/ Survey of Cornwallrf. 137. 0 Mr. Brand, who gives an account of this custom as it prevailed in Devonshire, on the borders of Cornwall, with some circumstances different from what we observed in the neighbourhood of Truro, calls it a Knack.

The earliest topographical notices relating to CornvHl, are those in the itineraries of William of Worcester, who visited that county in the reign of Edward IV. and of Leland, who was there in the reign of Henry VIII. Next to these in point of time, follows the brief ssietch of the county by Camden, in his Britan nia, first publissied in 1586, in octavo. The first regularly digested historical and topographical account of Cornwall, is the survey of that county, written in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, by Richard Carew, Esq. of Anthony, and first publissied in 1602. This survey, to use the author's own words, \" containeth a descrip tion \u2014 General in the first book, respecting her accidents, elements, and inhabit ants \u2014 Special in the second book, containing matters topographical, historical.\" The first book contains much valuable matter on general subject-:, particularly relating to the state of the mines at that time, the tillage of the county, fissi eries, &c ; the Cornissi gentry, eminent persons, trade, Saints' feasts, customs, games, &c. &c. ; historical notices ; temporal and spiritual government, &c. ; and a transcript of some valuable records from the Exchequer. The second book consists chiefly of topographical notices, arranged according to the several hundre' s, with a brief account of the principal gentry and their seats. This work was re printed, without additions, in 1723, and again in 1769. A new edition was publissied in 1811, by the Right Hon. Lord de Dunstanville, with the notes of Thomas Tonkin, Esq. of Trevaunance, from a MS. in His Lordssiip's possession, which had been prepared for the press by the author, but never publissied. Norden's \" Topographical and Historical Description of Cornwall\" may be con sidered as contemporary with Carew's survey ; the \" Perambulation of Cornwall,\" as he calls it, for the purpose of collecting his materials, appears to have been made in 1584: it was not written till after the publication of Carew's volume, from which he has evidently taken his general ssietch of the county ; and, from other circumstances, it appears, that he had, at least in many instances, brought down his account to the time of his writing. This survey, in which we have some notices of seats of the Cornissi gentry of his time, not mentioned elsewhere, was not printed till 1728. Mr. Carew does not seem to have been aware, that Norden intended more than a map of the county ; for, in a letter dated 1 606, when me ditating a new edition of his survey, he says, \" if I wist where to find Mr. Nor- Vol. III. B den,"], [356, "CORNWALL. 2 den, I would fain have his map of our ssiire, for the perfecting of which he took a journey into these parts.\" MrfTonkin observes of Norden's book, that \" al though a mean performance, full of egregious mistakes, with most defective and erroneous maps of every hundred, yet there were several things in it hardly to be met with elsewhere.\" a About the year 1685, Mr. William Hals, a gentleman of an ancient Devon ssiire family \", which had been some time settled at Fentongollan, in St. Michael- Penkevill, began to make collections for a parochial history of Cornwall, which he continued for at least half a century : it was brought down by him to about the year 1736. Mr. Hals died in 1739; his parochial history being at that time nearly compleated. About the year 1750, the publication of this work was under taken by Mr.Andrew Brice, then a printer at Truro, who afterwards removed to Exeter, where he publissied an useful geographical dictionary and other books. The account of seventy-two parissies arranged alphabetically, from Advent to Hel ston inclusive, was printed in folio in ten numbers, which are extremely scarce : the publication is said to have been suspended for want of purchasers ; occasioned by the scurrilous anecdotes it contained, and reflections thrown on some of the principal families. It is probable, however, that the inaccuracies with which it abounds, and the tedious legends of saints to whom the churches are dedicated, which occupy at least half the work, would have operated more to the prejudice of its sale than the scandalous anecdotes which occasionally occur, many of which had been omitted by the editor. The most valuable part of the work is the ac count of families,, and the descent of property ; but in these he is frequently inac curate ; and, as Dr.Borlase observes c, \" what he fays ssiould not have too great stress laid upon it, when it stands upon his single authority.\" Contemporary with Hals, as a collector of materials for a parochial history of Cornwall, was Thomas Tonkin, Esq. of Trevaunance d, some time member for Helston, a gentleman of an ancient family, who had made great progress in preparing such a history for the press, and had completed several parishes. Mr. Tonkin began to write his parochial history in 1702, at which time he had the use of Hals's collections. Dr. Borlase e seems to have supposed that Hals's collections were brought down from 1702 to 1736 by Tonkin ; the truth * See Tonkin's dedicatory letter prefixed to Lord de Dunstanville's edition of Carew. * Mr. Gough had been informed that he was rector of St.Iwern ; but it is certain that he never was in holy orders, nor is there any such Cornish parish. Mr. Hals's residence, during the greater part of his life, was at Tresawsen, in Merther ; at the time of his death, he resided at St. Wenn. * In MS. notes on Carew, in the possession of Sir John St.Aubyn, Bart. \u2022 In the latter part of his life he resided at Polgorran, nearTregony.

Mr. Tonkin himself says, speaking of Hals in the year 1739, \" it is between twenty-five and thirty years since I have seen any of his collections, and, I believe, at least twenty, since I have seen him : I am told that he has greatly improved and polissied them since that time ; but as his me thod is quite different from mine, and that I have some other reasons not necessary to be mentioned for not corresponding with him, I can safely say, that in this pre sent work of mine f, I have not made use of one single line out of his compositions.\" Mr. Tonkin, in one of his MSS., dated March 27th, 1733, desires that, \" if by death, or any other accident, his MSS. ssiould fall into other hands, they would by no means publissi them in the dress in which they then appeared, but be pleased to new-model them after the method followed in those few which had received his last corrections, such as St. Agnes, St. Piran in the Sands, St. Michael-Pen kevil,\" &c. In 1737, he had made sufficient progress in his collections, to enable him to put forth proposals, in which he announced the plan of his publication.5 In the year 1739, Mr. Tonkin had completed his MS. of the first part of his work, which was to treat of the county of Cornwall in general ; his epistle dedi catory of that date h, is printed at the beginning of Lord de Dunstanville's edition of Carew, addressed to Sir William Carew, Bart, and Sir John St. Aubyn, Bart., then representatives in parliament for the county of Cornwall. In this letter, he recapitulates what had been done towards the topography of his native county. Besides the works of Leland, Camden, Norden, and Carew, he mentions the gene ral collections of Hals and Anstis, and those of Beare and Gwavas on the Stannaries, the Cornissi language, &c. Towards the conclusion of his epistle, he fays, \" I f Meaning the first volume, which was to have contained the general history of the county. \u2022 Proposals for publishing three volumes of the history and antiquities of Cornwall in imperial quarto : \u2014 The first to be a complete work of itself, and a full natural history thereof and its antiquities.

Very little was done by Mr. Tonkin to the parochial department of his intended history after the date of this letter ; he died in 1742, and \" in the latter part of his life, being unhappily involved in pecuniary difficulties, grew less attentive to study and died without printing any part of his intended history.\" The Rev. William Borlase, rector of Ludgvan, afterwards LL.D. publissied in 1 754, \" Observations on the Antiquities of the County of Cornwall,\" in one volume folio, and in 1758, another volume, relating to the natural history of the county ; a second edition of the Antiquities was publissied in 1769. Dr.Borlase, whose works, notwithstanding he indulged some fanciful conjectures concerning the dru- idical worssiip, contains much valuable matter, appears to have meditated a paro- chial history of Cornwall ; the few collections which he had made for that purpose, in addition to the MSS. of Hals and Tonkin, he digested in a folio volume, now in the possession of Sir John St.Aubyn, Bart. In 1 775, the Rev. Mr. Walker, late rector of Lawhitton, projected the publication of a parochial history of Cornwall, by making additions to Hals, and issued proposals, but the publication never took place. In the year 1803, the Rev. Richard Polwhele, representative of the ancient family of that name, and vicar of Manaccan, who had been before engaged in the pub- lication of a history of Devonshire, publissied three volumes of a general history of Cornwall, classed under the several heads of, civil and military transactions, reli- gion, architecture, agriculture, mining, commerce, language, literature, population, manners, &c. and divided into periods : these volumes, which were brought down 10 to"], [359, "CORNWALL 5 to the reign of Edward I., were followed in the year 1804 by \" a Supplement to the first and second Books, containing Remarks on St. Michael's Mount, Penzance, the Lands-End, and the Sylleh Isles, by the Historian of Manchester ;\" and in the year 1806 by two other volumes, one of them containing the history of Cornwall, in respect to its population, and the health, strength, activity, longevity, and diseases of its inhabitants, with illustrations from Devonssiire; the other, \u2022' the language, literature, and literary characters of Cornwall, with illustrations from Devonssiire.\" No detached histories have been publissied of any of the Cornissi towns ; a history of Launceston, written by himself, was among the MSS. of that industrious collector, John Anstis, Esq. some time Garter King of Arms, who was a native of St. Neot's, and resided chiefly in the latter part of his life on an estate which he had purchased in the parissi of Duloe, where he lies buried. We have not been able to discover where this valuable MS. is deposited, nor who is the present pos sessor of a MS. history of the borough town of St. Ives, written by Mr. Hicks, some time an attorney at St. Ives, before the year 1756. h In the year 1806, the Rev. Benjamin Forster, rector of Boconnoc, publissied a small tract, in quarto, intituled, \" Some Account of the Church and Windows of St. Neot's.\" In the year 1804, the learned Mr.Whitaker, author of some much esteemed historical disquisitions, publissied a work in two volumes quarto, intituled, \" The Ancient Cathedral of Cornwall historically surveyed,\" in which he has clearly proved, that the seat of the bissioprick of Cornwall was at St. Germans only, and never at Bodmin, as had been generally supposed. In compiling the following parochial accounts, recourse has been had, as in other counties, to the Inquisitions post mortem, and other records in the Tower. We have occasionally made use of the printed part of Hals's works ; and have been so fortunate, as to procure a sight of a considerable portion of that which has not been publissied, copies of detached parts of which are in the hands of several persons, but we have not ascertained that any perfect copy exists. We have, however, chiefly relied for the descent of property, in addition to what has been obtained from records, on the MS. of Tonkin, where there was an opportunity of choice ; but there are some parissies for which Tonkin made no collections; as, on the other hand, there are others even of the printed parissies of Hals, in which there is scarcely any information to be obtained, except flight notices of the benefice, and a history of the faint to whom the church was dedi cated1.

Mr. Pye of Blisland, through the favour of Dr. Taun ton, soon aster we began to make collections for Cornwall : a copy of this has been since added to the remainder of Tonkin's MSS. in the possession of Lord de Dunstanville, to whose kindness we have been indebted for the use of the whole, as well as for much other valuable information and assistance in the progress of our work. To Sir John St.Aubyn, Bart, we have been indebted for the use of Dr. Borlase's unedited MSS. His volume respecting the Cornissi families has proved extremely useful, not only for what we have written on that head, but in tracing satisfactorily, in many instances, the descent of property. Among Borlase's addi tions to what had been collected by Hals and Tonkin, for the parochial history, are notices of the ancient chapels in most of the parissies from the registers of the See of Exeter, which we have frequently quoted. We have been indebted to Rose Price, Esq. for the inspection and use of the collections made by his father, John Price, Esq. of Penzance, among which are a MS. history of St. Michael's Mount, and copies of some of Hals's MSS. The late Mr. Price had printed some part of his collections, consisting of pedigrees, deeds, and wills, in folio. The church notes, with notices relating to ancient architecture, &c. were collected during personal visits to every parissi in the county in the year 1805, some of which were repeated in 181 1. In our endeavours to continue the descent of landed property from the time when Hals and Tonkin finissied their collections, we have experienced a considerable degree of success ; and although our public applications for information were not more successful than Tonkin's, the result of several advertisements having been one solitary communication, yet many of the principal landholders have, upon our immediate application t\u00a9 them, though person ally unknown, very obligingly furnissied us with valuable communications. For much general assistance we have been indebted to Dr. Taunton, Charles Rassileigh, Esq., John Wallis, Esq. of Bodmin, and his son, John Wallis, Esq. ; the latter has not only furnissied us with such information as fell within his own knowledge, but prosecuted inquiries for us with much activity and intelligence. For much research and many valuable communications relating to the hundred of East, we have been indebted to the Rev. Francis Vyvyan Jago of Landulph, to the Right Hen.

It contains the small villages of Treclegoe or Trelegoe, Pencarow, and Tresinny. Most of the estates in this parissi are parcel of the duchy of Cornwall, being held as free and customary lands of the manor of Helston in Trigg. The manor of Trelegoe, Treclegoe, or Trenelgoe, after having been for some descents in the family of Phillipps, was bequeathed by the late Rev. William Phillipps, rector of Lanteglos and Advent, to his nephew John Phillipps Carpenter, of Tavistock, Esq., whose son is the present proprietor. Helssiury Park, held under the duchy of Corn wall, extends into this parissi. Tonkin speaks of Trethyn as a place of chief note in the parissi of Advent, and fays, that Sir Henry Rolle retired thither during the protectorate of Cromwell, about which time it became, by lease, the seat of a branch of the Vivians, whose heiress married into the family of Beale of St.Teath : it was, in 1736, the seat of Matthew Beale, Esq. It is now, by inheritance from his father, the property of Robert Lovell Gwatkin, Esq. The church of Advent, which is a distinct parissi, is united to Lanteglos-juxta-Camelford, and forms with it a consolidated rectory, in the patronage of the Prince of Wales as Duke of Cornwall. St. Agnks, in the hundred and deanery of Pyder, is a small market-town, situated nine miles north-west-by-west from Truro, near the Bristol channel. It was anciently called Breanick or Bryanick. The market, for which there does not appear to be any charter on record, has been held from time immemorial for all sorts of wares and provisions, except corn. In 1 706 Mr. Tonkin pro cured the Queen's patent for a weekly market and two fairs, but, after the writ of ad quod damnum had been duly executed, and the Queen's sign manual obtained, in consequence of a petition from she inhabitants of Truro, the grant was re voked. A small market is nevertheless kept up : the market-day is Thursday. The town and parissi, comprising a great mining district, thickly strewed with cot tages, contained 4,161 inhabitants in 1801, and 5,024 in 1811, according to the returns made to parliament in those years. A pilchard-fissiery was establissied at St.Agnes about the year 1802.

The great manor of Tywarn haile, which will be more particularly treated of in the parissi of Perranzabuloe, extends into this parissi. The manor of Mythian belonged formerly to the family of Winslade : John Winflade was executed for being concerned with Humphrey Arundell and others in the Cornissi commotions in 1549, and his estates were forfeited to the crown. King Edward VI. granted this manor to Sir Reginald Mohun. William Mohun, Esq., the last heir-male of this family, bequeathed it to his wife Sibella, (who was afterwards married to John Derbyssiire Birkhead, Esq.) and his sister, Mrs. Eli zabeth Prowse. Sir Christopher Hawkins, Bart., who is the present proprietor of the whole, bought it in 1777 ; one moiety of Mr. Birkhead, and the other of Matthew Grylls, brother and heir of Robert Grylls, who had purchased it in 1758 of the devisees of Mrs. Prowse. The manor, or reputed manor, of Trevaunance, is said -to have been acquired by the Tonkin family in marriage with the heiress of Carne, a younger branch of the family of Carne of Glamorganssiire m. In the year 1559, Henry Earl of Rut land, then lord of the manor of Ty warnhaile-Tyes, sold the fee of the Trevau nance estate to Richard Crane, who the fame year conveyed it to John Jeffery. In 1593, it was sold by Jeffery to Thomas Tonkin alias Trevaunance, whose family had long been possessed of it as lease-holders. This estate was the property and the seat of Thomas Tonkin of Trevaunance, Esq., who made large collections for a parochial history of Cornwall n. Mr. Tonkin enjoyed his estate but a few years: he died in 1742. His two sons, who did not long survive him, suc cessively inherited his estates, which, after their death, were for a while in the possession of Thomas Heyes, Esq., who married the daughter and heir of his son James, but left no issue ; the only child of his daughter, who married Foss, having died unmarried, they descended to the representatives of the three daugh ters of Thomas Tonkin, who died in 1672; which daughters had married into the families of Jago, Cornissi, and Ley. Mr. John Jago, and Mr. Hugh Ley, the immediate descendants of two of the daughters, are now possessed of two thirds of the manor of Trevaunance, and of such portion of the manor of Lambourn as extends into this parissi, and was part of the Tonkin estate (except some lands sold to J.

An attempt was made by the Tonkin family to form a harbour at Trevaunance- Porth as early as the year 1632 ; it was attempted again in 1684, and, after a con siderable expence had been incurred, again given up. In 1 699, a third attempt was made with the assistance of Mr. Winstanly, the celebrated engineer; the works then constructed were destroyed by a violent storm in 1 yo$. Mr. Tonkin, from whose notes this account was taken, again commenced his works in 1710, at the expence of 6,oool. ; he formed the foundation with large masses of rock laid in hot lime made of Lyas-stone from Aberddaw, in South Wales : these works having become decayed, a jetty pier of Moorstone was built about the year 1794, at the expence of io,oool., by a company of gentlemen, and a considerable trade in coals, lime, slate, &c. is now carried on with Ireland and Wales. The pro prietors are enlarging the harbour, and rendering it more commodious and safe for ssiipping. A small stream of water which rises in the manor of Ty warnhaile, turns several stamping mills in Trevaunance-Comb. Mr. Tonkin speaks of Chyton and Trevenythick, now Trenethick, as tenements in this manor. He fays, that the Beauchamps owned Chyton in the reign of Henry IV. : and that, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, they removed from Chy ton to Trenethick; in the year 1633, Walter Beauchamp sold both to Peter Jen kyn of St. Columb the Higher, of whose representatives Chyton was purchased about the latter end of that century by Hugh Tonkin. It is now partly the pro perty of the heirs of Tonkin before mentioned, and partly of Francis Enys, Esq. Trenethick was sold by the Jenkyn family in 1699 to John Tonkin, Esq. of Mul lion, who' possessed it in 1736. It was afterwards, for many years, in the family of John, of whom it has been recently purchased by Mr. Collan Harvey of St. Day. Penwennick, a tenement in the manor of Tywarnhaile, was divided in the reign of Henry VIII. between Thomas Kemyell, who possessed a moiety, and Sir John diamond and Urinus Nicholl, who had a fourth each. The representatives of Kemyell sold their moiety in 1568 to William Whitta ; from Whitta, it passed to the Lanyons, who resided here several years, and sold this estate in 1622 to Edward Noye of Mawgan : it was purchased of the latter, in 1627, by John Ton kin, Esq. of Trevaunance. Sir John Chamond's ssiare passed through several female heirs to Francis Basset, Esq. of Tehidy, who sold it to Thomas Tonkin, Esq. in 1705. These three parts of Penwennick were, till of late years, vested in the heirs of Tonkin. The remaining fourth part, which had belonged to Nicholls, was, in J 736, the property of John Nance, Esq. whose ancestors had acquired it 5 by"], [365, "CORNWALL, 11 by purchase : the whole is now the property of John James, Esq. who resides on another estate, which he has in this parissi called Roscmundy. Treuellis or Trevellis, a tenement in the manor of Tywarnhaile, was for several descents the seat of the family of Crocker ; it belonged afterwards to Mr. Joseph Donnithorne, and is now the property of Mr. Chilcot. The mansion is occupied as a farm-house. The church of St.Agnes, a daughter-church to Perranzabuloe, is said by Hals to have been originally built as a parochial chapel in 1484, when it was conse crated by Archbissiop Courtenay ; but it appears by Mr. Tonkin's notes, that he had deeds in his possession which ssiewed that St.Agnes was esteemed a distinct parissi, and had a parochial chapel in 1396 : the licence to build a new chapel was dated 1st October 1482. In this church are some monuments of the family of Tonkin of Trevaunance. St.Agnes and Perranzabuloe form a consolidated vicarage in the patronage of the Dean and Chapter of Exeter. In a dingle called Chapel-comb, was an ancient chapel known by the name of Porth-Chapel, the ruins of which were taken down about the year 1780. Near this spot is St.Agnes' Well, of which many miraculous stories are told ; the water is of an excellent quality, and much esteemed. Hals speaks of an ancient free chapel in the manor of Mythian, which had been made a dwelling-house. There are remains of an ancient chapel at Mola. Nicholas Kent of Mingoose, by his will, bearing date 1688, gave for the term of 499 years a dwelling-house, divided into four tenements and a garden, for poor widows of this parissi, and charged his lands of Mingoose and Tereardrene with the repairs of the house ; but it does not appear that it was endowed. One of the schools, founded by the trustees of the fund left, for charitable uses, by the Rev. St. John Eliot, who died in 1760, is at St. Agnes. The endowment is 5I. per annum. There is a Sunday-school at St.Agnes, supported by subscription, and numerously attended. St. Agnes Beacon, formed out of an ancient cairn or tumulus of stones, was kept ready for use a few years ago during the apprehension of invasion, and was attended by two soldiers \u00b0.

The principal villages in this parissi are Lane and Zelah, or Zealla, through which the high road from Exeter to the Land's-End passed, before the present turnpike-road was made. The antient mile-stones remain, and a house at Zelah is still called the Tavern. The manor of Laner, in this parissi, was an appendage to the Bissiop of Exeter's manor of Cargol ; and the capital mansion on it was for many years one of the coun try-seats of the bissiops, till the reign of Henry VIII., when Bissiop Voysey leased it to Clement Throckmorton, cup-bearer to Queen Catharine Parr ; from him the lease passed by successive conveyances to the families of Williams and Borlase q. During the possession of the latter, the house was suffered to go to decay, and there are now scarcely any remains of it ; on the site is a mean farm-house. The Bissiops of Exeter had, at an early period, a castle here, which William of Worcester speaks of as dilapidated in the reign of Edward IV. The manor of Gwarnike passed at an early period, by a female heir, to the antient family of Bevill, whose chief seat it continued to be for ten descents. The male line of this family became extinct in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, when the two coheiresses married into the families of Arundell of Trerice, and Grenville. The Arundells became possessed of Gwarnike ; John Arundell of Gwarnike, com monly called Black Arundell (from his always wearing a black dress), dying with out issue, in the year 1597, gave it to his kinsman Prideaux. In 1704, it was sold by the Prideaux family to James Kempe of Penryn, and in 1731 purchased by Edward Prideaux, Esq/, of Place-House, Padstow, ancestor to the Rev. Charles Prideaux Brune, of the fame place, who is the present proprietor. There were formerly two chapels at Gwarnike ; one at a small distance from the house, which was demolissied before the year 1736, and another attached to it, which, together with \"the old hall, curiously timbered with Irish oak,\" was then remaining5. These old buildings were not long ago pulled down, and a farm-house built on the site with the materials. Talgrogan, in this manor, was some time the seat of a younger branch of the Prideaux family ; and Trerice, in this parissi and manor, was the seat of a younger branch of the Arundells of Trerice in Newlyn.1 The manor of Bosvellick is supposed to have been part of the estate of the Bevills, and to have been sold by the coheirs to the family of Robarts.

Treonick, as Hals writes it, now called Trefrannick, was a seat of the Bor lases; there is now a small farm-house on the site. The Borlases had another estate in this parissi called Nanteg. y The church of St.AlIen was given to the college of Glaseney by Bissiop Staple ton, and appropriated to the vicars of that college in 1314% but the bissiop had previously endowed the vicarage of St.AlIen with the great tithes of his manors of Laner, Tretheris (where was formerly a chapel ' and cemetery), and Venteronisick. The vicarage is in the patronage of the Bissiops of Exeter. The rectory of St. Allen belonged, in the seventeenth century, to the family of Coke b ; it is now the property of Viscount Falmouth. Alternon, in the hundred of Lesnewth, and deanry of Trigg Major, lies about eight miles west of Launceston, which is the post town ; and about the fame distance south-east of Camelford. It is the most extensive parissi in the county, supposed to contain about 12,770 acres. The principal villages in Alternon are Tredawl, Trethyn, Treween and Trewint. At Five-Lanes, in this parissi, are fairs for all sorts of cattle, on the Monday week after June 24th, and the first Tuesday in November. The manor, or united manors of Alternon alias Penpont, Treglasta, and Tre winneck, extend into the parissies of Alternon, St. Cleather, Davidstow and Laneast. It is probable that they were formerly separate. Alternon, alias Pen pont, is said to have belonged to the Trevelyans. Treglasta, the site of which seems to have been Treglasta in Davidstow, was parcel of the estate of Richard Lucy, chief justice of England, whose daughter, Rohais or Rohesia, gave a moiety of it to William Briwere, a powerful baron in the reign of King John.

It has been lately offered for sale. The manor of Trelawney was the original property and seat of the antient family of that name. Many years ago, most probably on the extinction of the elder branch in the reign of Henry VI., it passed into other hands. In 1791, this manor, which is called the manor of Gunnon, Tregarlick (or Tregarrick), and Trelawney, was purchased of Vyell Vyvyan, Esq., by Edward Archer, Esq., brother of Samuel Archer, Esq., the present proprietor. The barton of Trelawney, to which in ancient times a deer-park was annexed, was the residence of Sir John Trelawney, a distinguissied military character in the reign of Henry V. : his elder son left only daughters, among whom this ancient patrimony of the family appears to have been divided. It is still in scveralties : the farm-house and immediate demesne are the property of William Newcombe, Esq. who resides at Trevithick in this parissi. The estate he possesses by bequest from the last of the family of Hickes, which had been for many generations of Trevithick.

The tower of Alternon church, which is said to be the highest in the county except Probus, was much damaged by storms in 1791 and 1810.

The name of Joll is still extant in the village, and the family have been remarkable for longevity, but we cannot learn that any tradition exists relating to Peter Joll, nor does his name appear in the register. Anthony, in the hundred and deanery of East, lies about three miles and a half south-west from Saltassi, and about a mile and a half west of Plymouth-Dock, which is the post town. The principal villages in this parissi, exclusive of the church-town, are Torpoint, Wilcove, and Tregantle. The manors of West and East Anthony were both in the family of De Alneto Dawney or Danny ; East-Anthony passed, by a female heir, to that of Archdekne or Erchdeken. Sir Waren Archdekne left three daughters, one of whom, Mar gery, married Sir Thomas Arundell, and died possessed of East-Anthony in 1420, leaving no issue : this estate passed to her sister Philippa, who married Sir Hugh Courtenay, and left a daughter and sole heir, Joan : East-Anthony devolved to the descendant of Alexander h, the fourth son of this Joan, by her first hussiand Sir Nicholas, Baron Carew of Hacomb. The fourth in descent from Alex ander, was Richard Carew, the well-known historian of Cornwall, a member of the original Society of Antiquaries, which was formed by Camden, Stow, Spel man, and other learned men, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. Richard, his eldest son, was created a baronet in 1641. On the death of Sir Coventry Carew, in 1748, the title passed to the Rev. Alexander Carew, descended from Thomas, a younger son of the second baronet, whose family had been settled at Harrowbear, or Horraborow, and became extinct at his death in 1799.

King Henry VII. restored it to the Courtenay family, but it became again forfeited by the attainder of Henry Marquis of Exeter, and was by King Henry VIII. annexed to the duchy of Cornwall, with other estates, in lieu of the honour of Wallingford ; and continued to be parcel of the possessions of the Prince of Wales' as Duke of Cornwall, till the year 1798, when it was sold, under the land-tax redemption act to the Right Hon. Reginald Pole Carew, M.P. lord of the manor of East- Anthony. West. Anthony extends into the parissi of St. John. The manor of Tregantle passed, with West- Anthony, from the Dawney family to the Courtenays. It is now the property of the Right. Hon. Reginald Pole Ca rew, having been purchased by the Carew family soon after the attainder of the Marquis of Exeter. Thancks or Thankes, formerly a seat of the Searles, took its present name from the family of Thonke, to whom it was enfranchised in the reign of Henry V. It was before called Pengelly. From the Searles it passed to the family of Warne, whose heiress brought it in marriage to Captain Thomas Graves ; it is now a seat of his grandson, the Right Hon. Thomas North, Lord Graves. The parissi-church contains several monuments worthy of notice. In the chan cel is the figure of a lady on a brass plate, under an elegant Gothic canopy, in memory of Margery Arundell, lady of the manor of East-Anthony, who died in 1420. \u2022 It was sold in Cromwell's time to Ralph Margery and others, but became again annexed to the duchy at the restoration. 12 In"], [371, "CORNWALL 17 In the north aisle is a tablet of black marble, in memory of Richard Carew, author of the survey of Cornwall, with the following inscription : Ric.

A quarto pamphlet was publissied in 1640, giving an account of the effects of a thunder-storm at Anthony, on Whitsunday in that year, when fourteen persons, then attending divine service, were scorched by the light ning, but no lives lost. The church of Anthony was formerly appropriated to the abbot and convent of f avistock, who possessed it when the survey of Domesday was taken. The manor and church of Anthony was granted as parcel of the possessions of that abbey to John Lord Russell, in 1540 ; and having been for some time in that noble family, were purchased, before the year 1672 m, by the Carews.

St. Anthony, in the deanery of Kirrier, and in the east division of the hun dred of the same name, commonly called St.Anthony in Meneage, lies about ten miles from Helston, and seven south-by-west from Falmouth. Helston is the post town. Bissiop Tanner fays, that there was at this place^ a cell of black monks of Angiers, belonging to the priory of Tywardreth, which existed as early as the reign of Richard I. ; its site is supposed to have been on an estate called Lantinny, adjoining the church-yard, where foundations of buildings and remains of human bodies have been found. There are two ancient entrenchments in this parissi, called the Great and Little Dennis, or the Great and Little Castle. The latter became the site of a small fort of the same name (the Little Dennis), which was occupied during the civil war in 1 His first wise was the heiress of Warne. m There is a deed of assurance of the estate in that year, to Jane Lady Carew. 6 the"], [373, "CORNWALL 19 the 17th century as a post for the security of Helford harbour \u2022 it was surrendered to Sir Thomas Fairfax in the month of March, 1646 \", being the last place in Corn wall that held out except the Mount and Pendennis Castle.

The manor of Porthia-Ptior, extending its jurisdiction into the parissies of St.Anthony, Gulval, St.Ives, and others, belonged to the priory of Tywardreth. It was made parcel of the honour of Wallingford in 1540, and soon after annexed to the duchy of Cornwall, of which it still constitutes a part. The principal, if not the ohly estate, now belonging to this manor, comprises the Little Dennis above mentioned, and almost the \"whole of the church-town and the adjacent lands. The manor of Tregarne-Condurra, partly in this parissi and partly in St. Keverne, and other neighbouring parissies % belonged anciently to the Earls of Cornwall ; and having been many generations in the family of Arundell of Lanherne, were pur chased of its representative, in 1737, by the grandfather of Sir William Lemon, Bart. the present proprietor. Trewothike or Trewothick, in this parissi, was a seat of the ancient family of Tregose, supposed by Hals to be quite extinct : in the reign of Charles II. it passed, by sale, to the Vaughans of Ottery-St.Mary, in Devon. ' In 1736, it was purchased of that family by Robert Trefusisp, Esq., whose descendant conveyed it in 1786 to Sir William Lemon, the present proprietor : it is occupied as a farm-house. Rosecreeg, in this parissi, gave name to a family ; it was sold about the year 1680, by Anthony Rosecreeg, Esq., to Henry Penrose, Gent., of Gillan, whose seat it was in 1736 : it has since passed through several hands, and is now the property and residence of Mr. William Morgan. The Rosecreeg family still reside at Anthony, in the rank of respectable yeomen. The site of Rosecreeg beacon is one of the most commanding spots on the south coast of Cornwall. Boscehan, in this parissi, is the seat of Thomas Grylls, Esq. The church of St.Anthony was appropriated to the priory of Tywardreth ; the rectory was granted by Queen ElizaKeth, in or about the year 1563, to the family of Killigrew ; it is now the property of Francis Gregor, Esq. of Trewarthenick.

In King Henry VIII. 's reign, Leland described it as a poor village. It first rose to consequence from its vicinity to Polgooth and other considerable mines : it is now a considerable thoroughfare ; the great road from Plymouth to the Land's-End was brought through it about the year 176c.

In consequence of the commodious harbour, the docks and ssiip wrights yard, and the pilchard fissiery establissied by Charles Rassileigh, Esq., it has gradually increased to be a large village, containing at present nearly 300 inhabitants. The town of St. Austell, in which part of the Earl of Essex's army had been quartered, was taken by King Charles I. not long before the capitulation of that army near Lostwithiel, in 1 644. Captain Jonathan Upcot, of this town, distinguissied himself by his bravery under King William III. in Flanders, where he and the greater part of his company lost their lives in an attempt to storm the enemy's camp at Enghien. ! The manor of St. Austell or Austell-Prior, belonged to the prior and convent of Tywardreth. Upon the dissolution of religious houses, it was annexed, with other manors, in 1 540, to the duchy of Cornwall, in lieu of the honour of Walling ford. During the interregnum in the seventeenth century, it was sold to Edmund Bourne, but at the Restoration was restored to the duchy. It is now the property of Charles Rassileigh, Esq., having been purchased under the land-tax redemption act in 1799.

The lands in this manor are held by two descriptions of persons, called free-tenants and conventionary or customary tenants ; the free-tenants hold lands of inheritance, subject to a high rent payable to the manor : the others hold by copy of court-roll from seven to seven years, under a small reserved rent, and suit and service to the court; the widow has a life-estate in these tenements, which descend to the eldest son, and in default of male issue, to the eldest daughter. The manor of Trenans-Austell belonged, in the reign of Edward III., to the equestrian family of Hiwis, a Devonssiire family, whose coheiress brought most of their Cornissi estates to the Colessiills ; afterwards, it was for several generations in the family of Chywarton. In 1634, it was the joint property of Ezekiel Arun dell, and Thomas Trewren, Esquires.

The manor of Penrice belonged, for many generations, to the ancient family of Sawle, and is now vested in trustees for Mr. Joseph Sawle Graves a minor, whose mother was one of the coheiresses of that family. Tewan (or Towan, as Hals spells it) was the ancient seat of the Sawles, who had been settled in Cornwall ever since the Norman conquest. Tonkin speaks of it as gone to decay ; it has been since rebuilt, and is now occupied as a farm-house. Lavrean, another seat of the Sawles, and still belonging to their representative, is now also a farm house. Penrice, which has a deer-park, is now the seat of Mr. Graves.

Cant', who had their chief residence at Cant, in Minver ; it was soon afterwards a seat of the Carminows m, having passed with one of the coheiresses of Thomas Carminow, at that time the elder male representative of the family, to Sir Hugh Courtenay, who settled at Boconnoc, and lost his life at the fatal battle of Tewks bury, in 1 47 1. It is probable that, upon becoming vested in the crown, in consequence of an attainder in the Courtenay family, it was granted to John Lord Russell. It is certain that Francis Earl of Bedford sold it, in 1579, to William Mohun, afterwards Sir William Mohun, Knt., who died seised of it in or about the year 1587. Boconnoc became the chief seat of his descendants; his son, Reginald, was created a baronet in 1512, and his grandson, John, a peer, in 1628, by the title of Baron Mohun of Oakhampton. The title became extinct in 17 1 2, by the death of Charles Lord Mohun, the third baron, who was slain in a duel with the Duke of Hamilton, which proved fatal to both the parties ; his widow, to whom he bequeathed all his estates, sold this manor, and the rest of his Cornissi property, in or about the year 1718, to Thomas Pitt, Esq. of Dorset ssiire, governor of Fort St. George, common ancestor of the Pitts, some time Earls of Londonderry, the Earls of Chatham, and the Lords Camelford. Go vernor Pitt's name is well known as the original and fortunate purchaser n of the celebrated jewel, still known by the name of Pitt's diamond, which was sold to the Regent of France, and which now adorns the hilt of Napoleon Buonaparte's sword. His grandson, Thomas Pitt, Esq., was Lord- Warden of the Stannaries, in 1750. His great-grandson, of the same name, was, in 1784, created Lord Camelford, Baron of Boconnoc. His son, the second Lord Camelford, dying without issue, in 1804, Boconnoc passed, in marriage with his sister and sole heir, to the Right Hon. Lord Grenville, who is the present proprietor. William de Worcester, who visited Cornwall in the reign of Edward IV., speaks of Boconnoc, which he calls Blekennoc House, as a turretted old mansion, then lately the seat of Sir Hugh Courtenay.0 Boconnoc House, previously to the month of August, 1644, was occupied by the parliamentary army : some time before King Charles came into Cornwall, a party of his horse, under the command of Bernard Gaseoyn, surprised the gar rison here, and took the Earl of Essex's Lieutenant-colonel, and other officers, 1 Thomas de Cancia appears to have been possessed of the advowson, which has always been annexed to the manor, in 1268.

I. The present noble owner occasionally resides at Boconnoc. The present Boconnoc House, built by the Mohuns, was newly modelled by Governor Pitt, who added a wing to the old structure. The first Lord Camelford added, from his own design, another wing, which, with the end of the old building, forms a south front of 1 10 feet. In this wing is a gallery fixty-five feet in length, in which, among many family and other portraits, are those of Sir Reginald Mohun, supposed to be by Cornelius Jansen, of the Duchess of Cleveland by Sir Peter Lely, given by the Duchess to the family ; Governor Pitt, by Sir Godfrey Kneller, George Lord Lyttelton, Bissiop Lyttelton, the first Earl Stanhope (who v/as made a peer for his eminent military services in Spain), by Kneller, and William, Earl of Chatham. The manor of Bodulgate, which gave name to an ancient family, and was afterwards in the Hastings family, is partly in this parissi, and partly in that of Lanreath. In the parissi-church is a memorial for one of the daughters of Sir Reginald Mohun, who died in 1637. The advowson of the rectory, which is a peculiar, has always been attached to the manor. It was consolidated with Broadoak in 1742. The parsonage and glebe, which were situated in the\\ middle of Lord Grenville's park, were annexed to the Boconnoc estate by a late act act of parliament. A new and much more commodious parsonage-house has been built at Broadoak, and a suitable glebe annexed to it. Bodmin, formerly spelt Bodman, a considerable market and borough town, in the hundred of Trigg and deanery of Trigg-Minor, is situated 334 miles and a half from London, twenty miles and a half beyond Launceston, on the road to the Lands-End. The late learned Mr. Whitaker, in his history of the cathedral of Cornwall, has, with much ability, proved the fallacy of the grounds upon which it was supposed to have been a bissiop's see; an error into which Dr.Borlase, Browne Willis, and other eminent antiquaries, had fallen ; and has ssiewn very satisfactorily, that it was not the monastery at Bodmin, but another religious house dedicated to St.Petroc, near the sea-side, at Padstow, that was burnt by the * Whitelocke. 1 Clarendon. Danes."], [384, "CORNWALL 30 Danes. The priory of Bodmin is said to have owed its origin to the circumstance of St. Petroc, its founder, having taken up his abode in a valley, now occupied by the town of Bodmin, then the residence of St. Guron a solitary recluse, who having resigned his hermitage to St. Petroc, it was by him enlarged for the residence of himself and three other devout men r, who accompanied him with the intention of leading a monastic life according to the rules of St. Benedict. Here St. Petroc died before the middle of the sixth century. His ssirine was preserved in a small chapel attached to the east end of Bodmin church, as we learn from Leland and William of Worcester. The hermitage, which he had founded, continued to be inhabited by monks of the Benedictine order, till the reign of King Athelstan, who, in 926, founded, on or near the fame spot, a priory of Benedictines ; this convent having been dissolved at an early period, and their possessions fallen into the hands of secular canons, Robert Earl of Moreton and Cornwall seised them to his own use, and, after the death of his son, William Earl of Moreton and Cornwall, they became vested in the crown. Algar, to whom it is probable they had been granted, with the King's licence and that of William Warlewast, Bissiop of Exeter, re-founded the monastery, and replenissied it with Austin canons, who continued till the general dissolution of religious houses, when its revenues were valued at 270I. os. nd. per annum, clear income. The prior had, among other privileges, a market and fair, gallows, pillory, &c. as proved in a quo warranto, in the reign of King Edward I. The site, with the de mesnes, was granted to Thomas Sternhold, one of the first translators of the Psalms. In 1567, it was the property of Nicholas Pescod and Judith his wife, and William Pydderley and Philippa his wife, by whom it was fold, that year, to John Rassileigh, of Fowey, merchant. The immediate site was purchased of the Rassi leigh family by the late William Pennington, Esq., and is now the seat of Walter Ralegh Gilbert, Esq., who married his niece, Msss Hossien. The convent of Grey Friers, at Bodmin, is said to have been founded by John de London, under the patronage of Edmund Earl of Cornwall. William of Wor cester dates its foundation in 1239, and calls its original founder John, son of Ralph, Lord of Kayryssiays '. In another place he tells us, that the church of the Grey Friers was consecrated by Bissiop Grandison in 1352.' Sir Hugh and Sir Thomas Peverell (of Park in Eglossiayle), two principal benefactors to this convent, were buried in the Friery church. The site was granted, in 1546, to William Abbot, who, the next year, conveyed it to William Vyvyan and others. In 1566, it was conveyed by the said William Vyvyan, de scribed as of Trehunsey, in Quethiock, and John Hewet of Bodmin, to the corpo- ' Probably St.Credanus, St.Medanus, and St.Dacunus, who are ail said to have been buried at Bodmin.

We are told that, in Queen Eliza beth's time, it was used as the House of Correction for the county \". The refec tory, the only part of the conventual buildings which now remains, was fitted up as an Assize-hall in the early part of the last century ; and Hals speaks of it as the fairest and best in England, after that of Westminster, being 60 feet in height, and 150 in length ; he fays that it was used also as a market-house, and that several fairs for all sorts of merchandize were kept there ; and in the adjoining church-yard, a fair for cattle. The two ends of this room are now occupied by the courts of justice ; in the intermediate space, is transacted, on market-days, the business of the corn-market, and over head is the grand-jury room, and a large ball-room, which is opened at the races. The first remarkable historical event connected with this place is, that it became the head-quarters of Thomas Flammanck and Michael Joseph, the ringleaders of the rebellion of 1496, both of whom, indeed, appear to have been inhabitants of this parissi. Perkin Warbeck, after his landing in Cornwall, in the year 1498, assembled, at Bodmin, a force of 3000 men, with which he advanced to attack Exeter. In 1550, the Cornissi rebels, under the command of Humphry Arundell, who were much favoured by the townsmen of Bodmin, encamped at Castle Kynock, near this town, and marched thence to the siege of Exeter ; after the sup pression of this rebellion, which soon followed, Sir Anthony Kingston, the provost marssial, came, with the King's commission, to punissi some of the chief offenders ; and it is said, that he hanged the mayor at his own door after partaking of the hos pitalities of his table. A story is also told of his hanging a miller's man, who had personated his master.\" Bodmin does not appear to have had any garrison during the civil war ; it was occasionally occupied by both parties. General Fairfax finally took possession of it for the parliament in 1 646, a few days before the capitulation with Sir Ralph Hopton, near Truro. In the year 1 179, the burgesses of Bodmin paid a fine of one hundred shillings for setting up a gild without licence \\ Not many years afterwards, they obtained a charter, from Richard Earl of Cornwall, for a gild-merchant, with exemptions from toll, throughout Cornwall. This charter was confirmed by King Edward I. and King Edward III. ; the latter granted the burgesses the privilege of buying and selling wool and other merchandize, with exemption from toll, throughout Corn wall y. The corporation of Bodmin formerly consisted of a mayor and thirty-six burgesses, the twelve senior of whom, now called aldermen, are styled in Queen Eliza- \u25a0 Tanner. * See Carew's Survey. x Madox's History of the Exchequer. 7 Rot.

The mayor, together with the mayor of the preceding year, and the town-clerk, are justices of the peace,, with the powers usually exercised in corporation-towns. The corporation having been dissolved in consequence of neglect, a new charter was granted to the town by His present Majesty in the year 1798. The borough of Bodmin has sent members to parliament ever since the reign of Edward I. ; the election is vested in the cor poration. Among the ancient corporation-accounts, are the following curious items, relat ing to the election of members of parliament, and the payment of their wages* in the reign of Henry VII. : \" 19, 20 Hen. VII., paide to Richard Watts and John Smyth, burgesses of the parliament for the towne, 13s. 4d. \" Paide for the endentes for the burgesses of the parliament, 2od. \" Paide and yeven in malmesey to the under-ssieryss, 4d. \" Paid for the makyng a payr of endentes and an obligation, 1 2d. \" It.

Paide to Sir Richard Downa, the wich was promysed by the niaier and the worssiipfull in a reward towardes his wagys, 13s 4d.\" There was a market at Bodmin when the survey of Domesday was taken, the profits of which, belonging to the prior, were then valued at thirty-five shillings per annum : the tolls were afterwards let at a fee-farm rent to the burgesses, in whom the market and fairs are now vested. Leland speaks of the market at Bodmin as being like a fair for the confluence of people. Hals compares it, in point of supply of all kinds of provisions, &c to those of Exeter and Tavistock. It is still a very considerable market for corn, fissi, and all sorts of provisions, and well attended. It has always been held on Saturday, as at present. The fairs, which are great marts for cattle and horses, are on the feast of the Conversion of St. Paul, Saturday after Mid-lent Sunday, Saturday before Palm Sunday, Wednesday before Whit suntide, and on the feast of St. Nicholas the Bissiop (December 6.). Leather ssioes are made in great quantities at this town, and exposed to sale in standings at the markets and fairs. Bodmin is said to have been one of the coinage towns which had the privilege of stamping tin ; but it appears that it had been lost before the year 1347, when the burgesses petitioned parliament, complaining, that although by royal charters they were authorized to deal in all kinds of merchandize, tin as well as other, in the county of Cornwall, they had of late been hindered by the Prince and his men from buying or coining tin ; they were unsuccessful in their application, the an- swer"], [387, "CORNWALL. 33 fwer of parliament being, that the Prince might order the tin to be sold where he pleased \". The summer-assizes for the county have been held at Bodmin ever since the year 1716, except for the years between 1727 and 1738. The Mi chaelmas quarter-sessions also are held at this town. The Cornissi sessions are not attended by barristers. About five and thirty years ago, it was resolved to remove the county-prison from Launceston to Bodmin ; a commodious and well-arranged structure for that pur pose, from the designs of the late Sir John Call, 'and upon the principles recom mended by Mr. Howard, was completed in the year 1780. The act of parliament under which it was erected, passed in 1778. It has recently been determined to build a Lunatic-asylum at Bodmin, near the county prison. Some centuries ago, Bodmin appears to have been of much greater extent than it is at present ; it was probably most populous about the fourteenth century. It is by no means certain, that it contained only sixty-eight houses at the time of the Domesday survey, because that number is stated among the possessions of the priory of St.Petrock. In 1351, the town was so populous, that 1500 persons died there of a pestilence a. Mr.Whitaker justly observes, that this has been very erroneously adduced as a proof of the unhealthiness of the town, whereas the pestilence, which happened that year, was general, not only in England, but throughout Europe ; and the great number which died at Bodmin only'proves, that its population must, at that time, have been much greater than it is at present. Indeed the observations made by Camden, Carew, and others, as to the unhealthiness of this town, are totally inapplicable to what has been known of it within the memory of man. Brice of Exeter, who publissied his Geographical Dictionary in 1759, speaks of Bodmin as a town remarkably healthy, and noted for the longevity of its inhabitants. Carew, writing in Queen Elizabeth's reign, fays, that the many decayed houses in this town prove it to have been once very populous k; he intimates, at the fame time, that, in point of population, it still retained its precedence among the Cornissi towns. It is not now so populous as some others. In 1801 it contained 1,951 inhabitants, and in 181 1, 2,050 ; which is a smaller number than those of Helston, Lissieard, Mevagissey and Penryn, and considerably smaller than those of St.Austell, Truro, Redruth, Penzance, and Falmouth. * Rot. Park, Vol. II. 180. 1 William de Worcester, who visited Cornwall in the reign of Edw. IV., speaks of this, as recorded in the Registry of the Friers ; it was added, that there died, during that year, in various parts of the world, 13,883 of the order of Friers. (Itinerary, p. 1 13.) * It was one of the decayed towns, for the repair of which, an act of parliament was passed, 3a Hen. VIII., but, as it appears, with little effect. See the account of market and borough towns, in the General History, Voju III. F The"], [388, "CORNWALL. 34 The parissi-church was rebuilt in the years 1469, 1470, and 1471. William of Worcester speaks of the old church as considerably larger than the conventual church ; the parissi-church being ninety paces by forty, and that of the priory, only fifty-seven by thirty. The present church is a handsome structure, of which more particular mention will be found under the head of Ancient Church Architecture. A very particular account of the expences of rebuilding the church is preserved among the town records. The whole cost of the building, exclusively of presents of timber, amounted only to 194I. 3s. 6|d. The timber for St. John's aisle cost 20I. 13s. 4d. Sir John Arundell gave several timber-trees for the building. The lead for roofing the church came to 1 61. 2s. 3s d. The rate of wages appears at this time to have been for a labourer four-pence by the day ; for a mason hewing stones, five-pence ; for making the pillars, &c. sixpence ; for a plaisterer, five-pence halfpenny. The following is a specimen of some of the charges: \u2014 \" Forty-nine journeys (days work) for the windows above the Vyse, 24s. 6d. ; fourteen jour neys on the gabell window, 7s.\" There was formerly a spire on the tower, said to have been built by Prior Vivian, and esteemed, as Tonkin tells us, the loftiest and finest in the west of England. It was destroyed by lightning in the year 1699 '\u25a0> the damage then done to the tower was repaired at the expence of 227I. 9s. 1 f d. The most remarkable monument in Bodmin church, is that of Thomas Vivian, prior of Bodmin, and nominal bissiop of Megara in Greece, who died in j 533 ; here are also monuments or other memorials for the families of Flamank of Bo came, Michell, Hoblyn, and Pennington of the priory ; and a slab of blue slate, with a cross and shields of arms, in memory of John Vivian, who died in 1545. The remarkable font in this church has been already described. The church of Bodmin was appropriated to the priory. The rectory and advow son of the vicarage were granted, in 1609, to Thomas Ailworth, Esq. and Robert Duke, Gent. The impropriation is now vested in George Francis Collins Browne, Esq., except the tythes of hay, which were given to the corporation by one of the Opie family. Lord De Dunstanville is patron of the vicarage. Jasper Wood, thirty-seven years vicar of Bodmin, who died in 1716, a man, as we may suppose, of deranged intellects, fancied himself bewitched, and that he was delivered from the witches' power by his guardian-angel. Mr.Tonkiir fays that there was a printed account of this man, but we cannot meet with any one who has ever seen a copy. Various traditions relating to him are still current in the town. There were formerly several chapels in the town of Bodmin : that of the Bery was built by the parissiioners in the reign of Henry VII., and appears to have been connected with the parissi-church ; the site of this chapel, with the yard adjoining, is the only glebe belonging to the vicar. In the accounts of building the Bery chapel, mention is made of procuring the bissiop's pardon for the Bery, 3 \" and"], [389, "CORNWALL. 35 \" and a testymonyal of the Bery pardon ;\" payments to the Amatory, and the south Amatory are spoken of, and gifts to the Bery clerks. The tower of the chapel, the only part of it which still remains, was begun in the year 1501. Mention is made of the new gild at the Bery, and the gild of the Holy-rood at the Bery. There was also the gild of St. Christopher in this chapel- The gilds, or religious fraternities, who contributed to the building of the parissi church, appear to have been very numerous, and from the account of these we derive an intimation of some chapels or chantries, not mentioned elsewhere. We find enumerated, the gild of St. Anne in the Wood ; those of St. George and the Vir gin Mary, in the chapel of St. George ; of St.Thomas the Martyr, in the church yard; of St. Petrock, in Fore-street ; of All-Saints, in Pole-street; of St. Leonard and the Holy Trinity, at St. Leonard's ; of St. Margaret, St. Anne, St. David, All- Saints, and St. Matthew, at the Bore ; of the Virgins of Bore-street, of the Vir gins of Fore-street, and of St. Nicholas and St. Anne, at St. Nicholas. Mention is made also of the gilds of Corpus-Christi, in the parissi-church ; of the Virgin Mary, in the chancel; and of Erasmus the Bissiop, St. Mary of Walsingham, St.Luke, St. Catherine, St.Stephen, St.Loy, St.Martyn, and St.Anyan the Bissiop, not particularly described. The stewards of the Ridyng-Gild appear also among the contributors. Dr.Borlase speaks of the ruins of St. Leonard's chapel, as exissing in his time at the west end of the town ; and those of the chapel of St. Nicholas, at the south east extremity. The former were visible within the memory of persons now living, near the turnpike-house. In the year 1474, Stephen Nayler had the King's licence to found a chantry, either in the parissi-church of St. Petrock, or in the conventual church of the priory of St. Petrock0. The lands belonging to this chantry were valued, in the reign of Henry VII., at 7I. 17s. 4d. per annum. In the ancient parissi-accounts before-mentioned, are the following curious items : \u2014 \" 20, 2 1 Hen. VII.

The grammar-school at Bodmin, situated in the church-yard, was founded by Queen Elizabeth, and endowed with 5I. per annum, payable out of the Exchequer; to which, in Tonkin's time, the corporation added 15I. per annum (now increased to 30I.) out of the market-tolls. About a mile east from the town, is the ancient hospital of St. Lawrence, which was incorporated by Queen Elizabeth, in the year 1582. Her charter recites, that there had, for a long time, been a great company of Lazar people in this hos pital, known by the name of a Prior and Brethren and Sisters e ; but that they had never been incorporated by her or her predecessors. They are incorporated in this charter, by the name of \" the master or governor, and brethren and sisters (thirty nine in number) of the hospital of St. Lawrence of Ponteboy,\" the poor men and women to be leprous people, and to elect one another. King James I., a few months after his accession to the throne, granted them a weekly market, on Wed nesdays, and an annual fair, with a court of Piepowder, on the festival of St. Luke. The market has been long discontinued, but the fair, which is held on the 21st of August, is still kept up, and is a great mart for horses and cattle ; there is another fair at St. Lawrence, for horses, bullocks and ssieep, on the 29th and 30th of Oc tober. The lands with which this hospital was endowed, are worth about 140I. per annum. In consequence of the great abuse of this ancient endowment, it having been wholly diverted from its original object, the support of the sick and infirm, a Chancery-suit was instituted some years ago, which terminated in a decree, by which the corporation was dissolved, and the lands appropriated to the hospital for sick and hurt, lately establissied at Truro. - There were two other ancient hospi tals at Bodmin, dedicated to St.Anthony and St.Georgef. Dr.Borlase mentions the nuns of the chapel of St.Anthony, about the middle of the town. The chapel of St.George before-mentioned, belqnged, it is probable, to the hospital of that name. The jurisdiction of the borough of Bodmin is separate from that of the parissi, and extends about a mile round the town ; the parissi is extensive, its principal villages are Bodiniel, Dunmere, St. Lawrence, and Nantallan. - ' They are called by that name in a deed bearing date 29 Hen. VIII. ' See the will of Thomas Killegrew (bearing date, 1500.) in the Prerogative Office. Besides"], [391, "CORNWALL. 37 Besides that of the corporation, which belonged to the priory, and appears by the Domesday survey to have been an honor, there was another manor of Bodmin, also belonging to the priory, which passed with the site of that monastery to the Rassileighs, of whom it was purchased by Richard Barwell, Esq.; and of the latter, in 1789, by its present proprietor Lord de Dunstanville. Another manor of Bodmin was many years in the family of Robartes of Lanhydrock, and is now vested in their representative, the Honourable Mrs. Agar. A fourth, being of very small extent, has been for a considerable time in the Trefusis family, and is now the property of Lord Clinton. The manor of Bodmin and Boscarne, which belonged to the Mohuns, is now, in right of his lady, the property of Lord Grenville. The manor of Bodmin-Francis, which belonged to the Hoblyns, and passed by marriage to the Peters, has been lately fold in parcels. The manor of Bodmin and Kirland, spoken of by Tonkin, is not known to exist as a manor. Kirland, in Bodmin parissi, is the property and residence of James Kempthorne, Esq.; the house was built by Mr.Hugh King, in 1740. The manor of Bodiniel, which belonged to the prior and convent of Bodmin, and afterwards to the Chamonds, is now in the Molesworth family. The manor of Lancarfe or Lancoff, held of the honor of Bodmin, or the honor of St. Petrock, belonged, in the reign of Richard II., and for several years after wards, to the family of Walessiorowre, who then held it under the Bevilles g : it is now in severalties. In the fifteenth century, the barton belonged to the family of Opie ; afterwards successively to the Crossmans and Bullocks. In 1685, was purchased of the Bullock family, by John Mounsteven h, Esq., secretary to the Earl of Sunderland, when secretary of state ; his descendant, Mr. Hender Mounsteven, now of Bodmin, sold it, in 1787, to Francis John Hext, Esq., father of F. J. Hext, Esq., the present proprietor ; by whose brother, Capt. William Hext, of the Royal navy, the old mansion is now occupied. The barton of Bokarne, Boscarne, or Bossiarne, in this parissi, was for many generations the seat of the ancient family of Flamanc, or Flamank, who had been settled there for at least seven generations before Barnard Flamank, who died in 1656. Hals supposes the Flamanks of Bokarne lo have been lineal descendants of Mark de Flamank, who lived in the reign of Henry II., and of Thomas Flamank or Flamock1, one of the leaders of the rebellion in 1496 : in the former conjecture probably he is right, but in the other, erroneous ; the present family of Flamank being descended from John, a younger brother of Thomas Flamank above mentioned, who left no male-issue. Boscarne is now the property of William B Efch. Rich. II., Hen. V., &c.

Flamank, D.D., the representative of this ancient family : the old mansion is occupied by a farmer. Not far from Bodmin, is a moor called Halgaver, where a kind of low festival, called Bodmin Riding, was formerly held annually in the month of July, and attended by a great concourse of people : on this occasion there was elected a mock-mayor, who held a court, before which they presented any person \" charged with wearing one spurre, or going untrussed, or wanting a girdle, or some such like felony; and after he hath been arraygned and tryed, with all requisite circumstances, judgment is given in formal termes, and executed in some one ungracious pranke or other, more to the ssiorne than hurt of the party condemned. Hence is sprung the proverb, when we see one slovenly appareled, * He shall be presented in Hal gaver court.' \" It is probable that this custom was very ancient, and it is not unlikely, that the riding-gild before-mentioned had some connection with it.\" Bodmin races, which had been discontinued upwards of twenty years, were revived in 1807. Castle-Kynock, or as it is called in some ancient deeds, Canyke, a considerable entrenchment to the east of Bodmin, is in this parissi : William of Worcester, in his Itinerary of Cornwall, describes it thus : \u2014 \" Cqstellum de Keynock, dirutum, cum tribis wardis.\" Botus-Fleming, or Blo-Fleming, lies in the deanery and in the south division of the hundred of East, being situated six miles south-west of Callington, and three miles north-west of Saltassi, which is the post-town. Hals fays, that this parissi takes its name from the family of Flandrensis or Fleming, lords of Botus-Fleming, whose heiress married into the Copplestone family. It does not appear, nevertheless, by any records that we have been able to discover, that they were ever lords of the manor. The only manor in this parissi is that of Modeton, now called Moditonham, which was held by Philip de Vautort, under the Earl of Cornwall : it was afterwards in the Dauney family, passed with its heiress to the Courtenays, and was, at a later period, in the Waddons. In the year 1689, Moditonham, or as it was commonly called Muttonham, being then the property and scat of John Waddon, Esq., John Earl k Some remains of this custom still exist among the lower orders of people, who make a procession on horseback, carrying garlands. About twenty years ago, on the Monday nearest to the feast of St.Thomas a Becket, the principal inhabitants used to go in procession, with the emblems of their trades, preceded by music ; and two men, one with a garland, the other with a pole, which they had previously deposited at the priory, and received again from the master of the house, as representing the Prior. (From the information of Walter Ralegh Gilbert, Esq.) In the Magna Britannia of 1720 (Vol. I. p. 310.), it is said that \" in the middle of July, a kind of carnival was kept at Bodmin, to which thousands of people came to fee the sports and pastimes. King Charles II. honoured it with his company, in his journey to Scilly, and became a brother of the society, which it seems derives its origin from the times before the conquest.\" It may be observed, that the season of the year in which Prince Charles journeyed towards the Scilly Islands does not accord with this tradition. Of"], [393, "CORNWALL 39 of Bath there treated with the Prince of Orange's commissioners, about the surrender of Pendennis and Plymouth castles. Moditonham was purchased of the Waddons by the grandfather of the Rev. William Batt, by whom it was sold, a few years ago, to Charles Carpenter, Esq., the present proprietor. Mention is made in the Bissiop's registers at Exeter, of a chapel at Motton, in this parissi, dedicated to the Holy Trinity. Hatt, an ancient mansion in this parissi, was, for many generations, the residence of the Symons family ; it is now in the occupation of the Rev. Charles Tucker, who married one of the sisters of William Symons, Esq., the last heir-male of that family, who died in 1802. The Rev. William Batt, the present incumbent, is patron of the rectory. Boyton, in the hundred of Stratton, and deanery of Trigg-Major, lies six miles north of Launceston, which is the post-office town. The principal village in this parissi, except Boyton church-town, is Bennacot. The manor of Boyton, which had been purchased for the abbey of Tavistock, out of the church property, by Suetricius, abbot of that convent, was taken away by Robert Earl of Cornwall, who held it in consequence of this forcible usurpation, at the time of the Domesday survey'; it afterwards became parcel of the possessions of Henry de Bodrugan, who died in 1308 : not many years after, it belonged to the prior and convent of Laun ceston\"1; and having been given, with other manors, to the Duke of Cornwall, in 1540, in lieu of the honor of Wallingford, is still attached to the duchy. During the interregnum, in the seventeenth century, it was sold to William Comeby. The manor of Darracot, which belonged to the late Richard Wymond, Esq., was be queathed by him to his widow, Mrs. Ann Wymond, with remainder to his son William, to whom he bequeathed the barton of Bearden, in this parissi, formerly a seat of the family of Lovice \" : part of the house on this barton is occupied by the tenant of the farm ; the other part being fitted up as a gentleman's residence, and let to temporary tenants. The barton of Bredvosy or Bradridge belonged also to Launceston priory, and was attached, at the fame time, to the duchy, under which it has ever since been held on lease. The Symons family were lessees, and resided there in the seventeenth century. William Symons, Gent., who died in 1692, gave the sum of iool. towards rebuilding the tower of the church; it was completed in 1769, as appears by a tablet on the outside. The heiress of Mr. Symons brought Bradridge to John Hoblyn, Esq., who died in 1706 : his widow fold it to Sir William Pendarves, who made it one of his seats.

Mr. Prideaux is patron of the curacy ; the curate has the small tithes of Boyton, and the hamlet of Northcott, on the Devonssiire side of the Tamar : the great tithes of Northcott have lately been put up to sale, and chiefly purchased by the land owners. Breage, in the deanery and in the west division of the hundred of Kirrier, is situated three miles west of Helston, which is the post-office town.

The Godolphin family appear to have been settled at Godolgan-Hall for some descents, when it became extinct in the male-line, by the death of David Godol gan, whose only daughter married John Rinsey, Esq. This John took the name of Godolgan, and was great great-grandfather of John Godolgan or Godolphin, ssieriff of the county in 1504, supposed to have been the first of the family who adopted the present spelling of the name'. Sir William Godolphin, grandson of John, was several times chosen knight of the ssiire, and five times served the office p Hals fays, that the manor and barton of Godolphin were \" fold, temp. Hen.

(Hals's Parochial History of Cornwall, p. 35. ) It is still held of Sir John St. Aubyn, as of his manor of Lambourne, by the payment of a gammon of bacon. q His name appears thus spelt in the list of sheriffs. Carew, whose work was published in 1602, fays, \" Godolghan, a house so intitling his owner, though lately declined (with a milder accent) to Godolphin.\" Of"], [395, "CORNWALL 41 of ssieriff, he distinguissied himself by his military prowess, particularly at the siege of Boulogne. Mr. Carew. fays, \" he demeaned himself very valiantly beyond the seas, as appeared by the scars he brought home, no less to the beautifying his fame, than to the disfiguring his face.\" Dying without male issue, Godolphin passed to Francis Godolphin, son of his brother Thomas, who had served with him, and been wounded at the siege of Boulogne. Sir Francis Godolphin was the contemporary of Mr. Carew, and contributed his assistance towards the survey of Cornwall. Mr. Carew speaks in high terms of his bravery, in the defence of his country against the Spaniards, when they landed in Cornwall, in 1593; of his ssiill in minerals, and the improvements introduced by him in the tin-works. Sir William Godolphin, his son, distinguissied himself against the Irish rebels, in the latter end of Queen Elizabeth's reign. Sir William's sons were all loyalists during the civil war. Sir Francis, the eldest, was governor of the Scilly Islands, which he delivered up to the parliament, when the King's cause became hopeless. Sidney lost his life, in battle, at Chagford, in Devonssiire ; Sir Francis was created one of the knights of the Bath at the Restoration ; his son, William, was created a baronet, in 1661, and died in 17 10, without issue. Sidney, a younger brother of Sir William Godolphin, Bart., became a political character of considerable note, and, although he had been a leading person in the adminis- tration, during the latter part of King Charles II.'s reign, and that of his suc- cessor, was made first Lord Commissioner of the Treasury by King William, in 1690; continued to have the chief management of the Treasury department, during the remainder of that reign, and was appointed by Queen Anne, in 1702, to the office of Lord High Treasurer of England. On the union of England and Scot- land, in the effecting of which he had a principal ssiare, he was constituted Lord High Treasurer of Great Britain ; which high office he held till the year 17 10, two years before his death, which happened in the month of September 17 12, at the Duke of Marlborough's house at St.Alban's. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, where a monument (with his bust) was erected to his memory. In 1 706, the Lord Treasurer, who had been created a baron in 1684, by the style of Baron Godolphin of Rialton, was advanced to the cignity of an Earl, being created Earl of Godolphin, and Viscount Rialton. These titles became extinct by the death of Francis, the second Earl, in 1766, when Godolphin passed to his cousin, Francis, son of Dr. Henry Godolphin, Dean of Windsor, who succeeded to the title of Baron Godolphin of Helston ; a patent for which barony had been procured in 1735, by Francis Earl of Godolphin, with remainder to the heirs-male of Dean Godolphin.

William of Worcester, whose Itinerary of Cornwall was written in the reign of Edw. IV., speaks of a castle at Godolphin, which he calls Godollen, and describes it as in a state of dilapidation.

The manor of Methleigh was formerly the property of Sir Thomas Arundell, of Truthall in Sithney. About the year 1702, it passed, by sale, to the family of Coode, and is now the property of Edward Coode, Esq., of St.Austell. The manor of Pengersick, in the reign of Henry VIII., became the property, by purchase, of the Militon family. Job Militon, son of the purchaser, was made governor of St.Michael's Mount in the year 1547, in the room of Humphrey Arundell, who was executed for rebellion. His only son, William Militon, Esq., who was ssierissof Cornwall, dying in 1565, without issue, the inheritance of this estate passed to his six sisters, and has, ever since, continued in severalties. Sir Nicholas Hals, at his first coming into Cornwall, purchased some of the ssiares, and resided occasionally at Pengersick ; his son, John, sold them to the Godol phin family. The Duke of Leeds, as representative of the Godolphins, has now one-third and a sixth; James Busier, Esq., of Downes, in Devonssiire, possesses a third, and Messrs. Beard and Pascoe, the remaining sixth, by purchase, from Mrs. Hunt, heir-at-law of the late Earl of Radnor. There are considerable remains of an ancient castellated mansion on this estate, called Pendersick-castle, the principal rooms in which are made use of as granaries and hay-lofts ; one of them, which is nearly entire, is wainscotted in pannels ; the upper part of the wainscot is ornamented with paintings, each of which is accompanied with appro priate verses and proverbs in text hand. The manor of Pengwedna, which be- longed to the Arundells of Lanherne, was purchased, a few years ago, of Lord Arundell of Wardour, by Christopher Wallis, Esq., the present proprietor.

The market,' although now inconsiderable, is still held at Wadebridge for butchers' meat and other commodities ; there are now three fairs, May-day, June 22, and Michaelmas-day. Wade bridge, which consists of sixteen arches over the river Alan, was built about the year 1485. It is partly in this parissi and partly in that of Eglossiayle. There are certain estates belonging to this bridge, vested in the lord of the manor of Pawton, the rector of St. Breock, and the vicar of Eglossiayle, as trustees, with the rents of which, aided by certain tolls (from which the inhabitants of the two parissies in which it is situated are exempt), the bridge is kept in repair % The principal villages in this parissi, exclusively of Wade-bridge (which is the post-office town), are Great Burlawn or Burlorne, and Trevanson. The paramount manor of Poulton or Pawton belonged, from a very early period, to the Bissiops of Exeter. By some exchange it is probable, and at a period, as Tonkin thinks, not much earlier than the Reformation, Pawton became the property of the Prior of Bodmin, and having been seized by King Henry VIII., on the suppression of religious houses, continued in the crown till the year 1606, when it was granted by King James I. to Sir Arthur Gorges \u00bb ; after this, it passed, by successive sales, to the families of Opie, Fownes, Gibbons, and Briggs ; to Lord Dunlace and the Duchess of Buckingham his wife ; to the family of Dav\u00bb\u00abs, and that of Opie, a second time ; and from the latter to Sir William Morice, secretary of state lo King Charles II., having had, as Hals observes, sixteen lords 5 Borlase's notes from the registers of the See of Exeter. \u2022 Itin.III. 15. \u00ab Ibid. u Ibid. \u2022 Cart. 5 Ed.

It is now the property of her great-grandson, Sir Arscott Ourry Molefworth, of Pencarrow, Bart. The bissiops of Exeter had extensive privileges belonging to this manor, which was one of the nine franchises enumerated by Carew7; a market and two fairs at Wade-bridge, as before observed, and a prison at Tregunnow in this parissi, now converted into a dwelling-house. The barton of Pawton was one of their country-seats, to which was attached a deer-park. There are still some remains of the old mansion and the out-buildings occupied by the tenant of the demesne farm. This barton did not undergo the fame alienations as the manor, but con tinued many years in the family of Opie. In the year 1701 Mr. Nicholas Opie, being in reduced circumstances, sold it to Dr. Vincent, of Plymouth, who possessed it when Hals wrote his parochial account (about 1730). It afterwards became re-united to the manor, and is now the property of Sir A. O. Molefworth, Bart. Hurstyn or Hurston, a small manor held under that of Pawton, belonged at an early period to the Carninows, from whom it passed to the family of Vyell, and from the latter, by marriage of a coheiress, to that of Prideaux. It is now the property of the Rev. Charles Prideaux Brune, of Place, near Padstow. The ancient mansion belonging to this manor was a seat of the Carninows, and had a chapel. What remains of the buildings is fitted up as a farm-house. Part of a small manor called Padstow-Penkevill, belonging also to the Prideaux family, lies within St. Breock parissi. The manor of Penlees, which belonged to the Arundells, is now the property of Thomas Rawlins, Esq., of Padstow. Trevorder, in this parissi, was anciently a seat of the family of Tregago or Treiago, from whom it passed, by successive female heirs, to the families of Trenowith, Car minow, and Vyell. One of the coheiresses of Vyell brought this estate to the Prideaux family, by whom it was sold to Sir John Tregagle ; a descendant of Sir John resold it to the Prideatixes in the reign of George I., and it is now the property of the Rev. C. Prideaux Brune. Tredinick, in this parissi, was the seat of the ancient family of that name, which became extinct in the reign of Charles II., when it passed by sale to Lord Robartes.

The manor of Tacabre, or Takkebere, was given to the abbot and convent of St.Mary de Graces, by the feoffees of its founder, King Edward III., but we find it afterwards granted, as having been the property of James Lord Audley, to John Holland, Earl of Huntingdon : it was seized by King Richard III., in the first year of his reign, having been the property of the Duchess of Exeter, sister to King Edward IV. This manor, which extends into Whitstone, Tamerton, and St.Stephen's, Launceston, in Cornwall, and Sourton in Devon, seems afterwards to have acquired the name of Merrifield (a corruption probably of Mary-field), by which it is now known.

Broadoak or Bradock, in the hundred of West, lies about six miles west from Lissieard, which is the post-office town, and about five north-east of Lostwithiel. The manor of Broadoak, having been in the Courtenay family, was granted, in 1573, as parcel of the possessions of the attainted Marquis of Exeter, to Thomas Prideaux and Thomas Willyams : in 1619, it was solely in Willyams; and, at a later period, in the family of Watton, by whom it was sold, to Governor Pitt, soon after his purchase of Boconnoc : it is now the property of Lord Grenville. The benefice, which is a discharged rectory, was consolidated with Boconnoc in 1 742 ; the patronage is in Lord Grenville. There was formerly a chapel, dedicated to St. James, at a place called Bellasize, in this parissi.

St.BREWARD or Simon's Ward, in the hundred of Trigg, and deanery of Trigg- Minor, lies six miles south-by-west from Camelford, and about the fame distance from Bodmin, which is the post-office town. It is said, that the church was built by William Brewer, who was consecrated Bissiop of Exeter in 1224, and that the parissi takes its name from him : but although that prelate, who was distinguissied as a soldier as well as a divine, fought at the head of 100,000 men against the infidels in Palestine, we have no account of his having been canonized ; and, indeed, it seems too modern a circumstance to have been the origin of the name of the parissi. The principal villages in St.Breward are, Lank-Major, Lank-Minor, and Swallock : in this parissi is the ancient manor of Hamethy or Hametethy, which, in the reign of Edward II,, was held by John Peverell of Roger Le Jeud. Hugh Peverell held it 23 Edw.

This manor, which took its distinctive name from the family of Burden or Burdun who possessed it in the reign of King John s, is of large extent, comprising the whole of Roughtor, and the adjoining moors. It is probable that it continued some time in the Burden family \\ It was afterwards successively in the families of Copple stone, Speccot, and Billing. From the latter it passed, with Hametethy, to the Michells ''. The benefice is a vicarage, endowed with a small portion of the tithe ssieaf; the impropriation belongs to the Dean and Chapter of Exeter, who are patrons of the vicarage. Rough-Tor, commonly called Router, and Brown- Willy, two lofty hills, from which may be seen a great part of the north-west of Corn wall, and the north and south channels, are in this parissi. Brown- Willy is the highest land in Cornwall. St.Budock lies in the deanery and in the east division of the hundred of Kirrier, two miles west of Falmouth. Greenbank or Dunstanville town, a populous suburb of Falmouth, is in this parissi, from which Falmouth itself was taken, having been made a distinct parissi in the reign of Charles II. Some houses adjoining the bo rough of Penryn, are also in this parissi. The manor of Pennance, which belonged to Sir Nicholas Slanning, and passed, by inheritance, to the Heywoods, of Maristow, in Devonssiire, was purchased of that family, in the year 1788, by the Rev. Joseph Richards, and Shuldham Peard, Esq., captain in the Royal navy, who have purchased also (subject to a lease for lives granted to Peter Browne Harris, Esq.) the impropriation of the great tithes, which formerly belonged to the college of Glaseney. The Bissiop of Exeter is patron of the vicarage, which is united with that of St.Gluvias. Rosineran, in this parissi, was formerly a seat of the Killigrews ; it was after wards leased by them to the Knyvets, who continued to inhabit it for three de scents, after which it passed, by successive purchases, to the families of Chapman and Mason, and is now the seat of Peter Browne Harris, Esq. It was purchased by Captain Browne, in 1773. The manor, or reputed manor, of Penwerris, in which Greenbank or Dunstan ville town is situated, is the property of Lord de Dunstanville, who inherited it, * Peter Burdun, 3 Joh., gave sixty marks and a palfrey for seisin of Penros. (Madox's History of the Exchequer, p. 406.) 1 Nicholas Binden is said to have held it, 20 Edw.

It had been purchased by her great-uncle of the Killigrews, about the year 1 660. Tre-on, Trone, or Trewoone, was the seat of a branch of the family of Thomas of Roscrow, who took the name of Carnsew, upon fixing their residence at Carn sew, in Mabe; about the time of the Revolution, it was mortgaged by Mr. John Carnsew to the Rev. Joseph Trewinnard, rector of Mawnan ; it has since been in the family of Rundle, and is now a farm-house, the property of James Moor, Esq., of Falmouth. Trescobays or Triscobays, formerly the seat of a younger branch of the family of Grosse, is now also a farm-house, the property of the Right Hon. Lord Wode house, in right of his lady, who is representative of the Killigrews. In the parissi church are some monuments of the Killigrew family, whose chief seat, Arwe nick or Arwenack, now adjoining Falmouth, was in this parissi, before Falmouth was separated from it in 1663. John Killigrew, Esq., who died in 1 tj6j, was made, by King Henry VIII., the first governor of Pendennis-castle. Sir John Killigrew, his son, succeeded him in that command, and died in 1584. The monument of Sir John Killigrew, which was put up by his grandson in 1 61 7, has kneeling figures of himself and his lady, Elizabeth, daughter of Philip Wolverston, of Wolverston Hall, in Suffolk. On a slab of slate against the south-wall of the chancel, is a Latin inscription in memory of Sir Nicholas Parker, Knt., who succeeded Sir John Killigrew in the government of Pendennis-castle, and died in 1603. Mr. Robins by his will, bearing date 1768, gave the interest of stock, amounting to nearly 7I. per annum, for the support of a school in the parissi of St.Budock. St.Burian, commonly called Burian, in the hundred and deanery of Penwith, about six miles south-west from Penzance, which is the post-town, and about two miles from the western extremity of the island. It contains, exclusively of the Church town, the small villages of Bolleit, Boscawen-Oon, Boscawen-Rose, Penberth-Cove, Rosemoddris, Treeve, Tregadgwith,Trelew, Trevorgans, and Trevorrian. There was formerly a market on Saturday at St.Burian, granted to the dean by King Edward I., together with two fairs, one at the festival of St. Burian, and the other at that of St. Martin, in the winter.1 King Athelstan is said to have built and endowed a collegiate church at this place in honour of St.Burian or Burien, a holy woman who came from Ireland in company with St. Breaca and other devout persons, and received sepulture here. The foundation is attributed to a vow made by that monarch at the Oratory of St.Burian, before he went on an expedition to the Scilly Islands, and he is said to * Cart. 30 Edw.

An ancient building on an estate called Bosliven, of which the walls are now remaining, about twelve feet high overgrown with ivy, is said, by what is most probably a groundless tradition to have been the sanctuary, and is held in much veneration11. It stands about a mile east from the church, and about two miles from the sea. It appears by the Domesday survey that there were secular canons in this church at the time of the conquest. When the Lincoln taxation was made, the establissiment consisted of a Dean and three prebendaries, as it continued till the Reformation. The collegiate estate was held by the service of saying ioo masses and ioo psalters for the souls of the King and his ancestors '. The deanery having been seized by King Henry VI., because its incumbent was an alien, was given by that monarch to King's College, in Cambridge, and not many years afterwards, by King Edward IV., to the Dean and Chapter of Windsor, but neither of those societies long possessed it. The deanery of the royal chapel of St.Burian m is a dignity held immediately under the crown ; the Dean exercises an independent jurisdiction in all ecclesiastical matters within the parissi of St. Burian and its dependent parissies of St.Levan andSennen. The three prebends belonging to the church of St.Bu rian were called Prebenda Parva, Prebenda de Respermel, and Prebenda de Tirth neyn; the former is now in the gift of the Bissiop, the two others are annexed to the deanery of St.Burian. The manor of Treviddron, still the property of the Vyvyan family, was their original seat, and continued to be their residence till they removed to Trelowarren. The fee of this manor appears to have been in the Champernownesin the reign of Edward III.\" On this estate, by the sea-side, are the ruins of an old chapel, called that of St.Loy or St.Dillower. The manor of Tresidor belonged formerly to the family of Whalesoorowe p; it is not now known as a manor : the barton belonged for many years to the Tresilians, and was sold by their representative, Mrs. Jenkins, to Mr. John Weymouth and Mr. John Permewan, jun., who are the present possessors. k The sanctuary no doubt, as was usual, comprised the church itself, the church-yard, and perhaps a certain privileged space beyond it. The remains of the building to which the tradition attaches are probably those of an ancient chapel. 1 Esch. 20 Edw.

This manor is now partly the property of Lord Falmouth, and partly of James Busier, Esq. M. P. by descent from Mr. Grosse. Boscawen-Rose was the original seat in this county of the ancient family of Boscawen, who took their name from it. It appears that they were possessed of this place, which is still the property of their descendant, Lord Viscount Falmouth, as early as the reign of King John. The Boscawens removed to Tregothnan, their present seat, in consequence of the marriage of their ancestor with the heiress of the Tregothnan family in the reign of Edward III. Boscawen is now a farm house. On Boscawen-downs is the circle of stones called Bojcawen-oon. Trou or Trewoof, beautifully situated on the side of a woody hill, overlook ing a romantic valley, which is terminated by Lamorna-cove, was the seat of the family of Levelis, which is said, by what appears to have been an erroneous tradition, to have been settled there before the Norman conquest q, and which became extinct in 1671, when Trewoof passed by marriage to the family of Vosper, since extinct. Hals speaks of two coheiresses of the Vospers, to one of whom this estate was assigned. It has since been divided into severalties : the house is occupied by a farmer. Within this barton is a triple entrenchment, in which is a subterraneous passage, and it is said that during the civil wars a party of royalists were here concealed from the' observation of Sir Thomas Fairfax's army by Mr. Levelis. There is a chalybeate spring on this estate. Pentrea or Pendrea, in this parissi, was for many years a seat of the Pendreas, whose coheiresses married Donnithorne and Noy. The latter inherited this place ; and here, fays Hals, was born William Noy, attorney-general to King Charles I., a learned lawyer r, who died in the year 1634; his grandson sold Pendrea to Mr. Christopher Davis, from whose family it passed to that of Tonkin, in which it is still vested. Burnuhall in this parissi, another seat of the Noys, which was sold also to the Davis's, belongs now to the Boscawen family ; this house is said by some to have been the birth-place of William Noy. Pendrea and Burnuhall are now both farm-houses. Leah or Leigh, now also a farm-house, was a seat of the Grosse family, and afterwards of the Usticks. It is now the property of John ' It appears to have been the family-tradition by a monument in St. Burian church, but the pedigrees of the family do not trace them higher than six generations above the year 1620.

The parissi-church stands on the highest ground in that part of the county, 467 feet above the level of the sea u. In this church is a handsome roodloft ; an ancient tomb in memory of Jane wife of Gessery de Bolleit ; and a memorial of the family of Levelis, the last of whom, Arthur Levelis, Esq., died in 1671. The Dean of St.Burian is rector of the parissi, and is entitled to all the tithes : a visita tion court is held in his name, at which the churchwardens are sworn, wills proved, &c. ; the appeal from this court is directly to the King in Council. This preferment is in the gift of the crown as a royal peculiar, and is tenable with any other. The deanery was, through Bissiop Ward's interest, annexed to the see of Exeter, but was separated from it again before the year 1709. St.Loy's chapel has been already spoken of; there are the ruins of another on an estate called Vellanserga. A school has lately been instituted, under the ma nagement of certain trustees, who provide a house for the master, and pay him eight guineas per annum for teaching seven poor boys. Callington, in the hundred and deanery of East, anciently called Calweton, Calvington, and Killington, is a market and borough town, 213 miles from London, and about fourteen from Plymouth. The market was granted by King Henry III., in the year 1 267, to be held on Wednesdays ; an annual fair was granted at the fame time, to be held at the festival of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary w. The market is still held on Wednesdays, for corn and provisions : the Lady-day fair has been discontinued : the present fairs are, the firstTuesday in March, May 4th, September 19th, and November 12th; they are chiefly for ssieep and cattle. The first-mentioned fair has been recently establissied. Callington first sent members to parliament in the 27th year of Queen Elizabeth ; the right of election is vested in persons possessed of freehold property, whether resident or non-resident ; and in resident lease-holders. The number of votes, which was sixty at the last election, has been since increased to about seventy. The Portreeve is the returning officer. The number of inhabitants in the town and parissi of Callington, in 1801, was 819; in 181 1, 938; according to the returns \" Dr. Berger's Paper on Cornwall, * Norden.

The manor was in the Ferrers family when the market was granted as above mentioned: Joan, daughter and heir of Martin Ferrers, brought it into the Champernowne family ; Sir Robert Willoughby, Lord Willoughby de Broke, be came possessed of it by marrying an heiress of the Champernownes. From the Wil loughbys, it passed, by successive marriages, to the families' of Pawlet (Marquis of Winchester), Dennis, and Rolle ; the heiress of Samuel Rolle, Esq. brought it to Robert, the second Earl of Orford ; on the death of whose son, the'late George Earl of Orford, without issue, in 1791, it passed to Robert George William Trefusis, Esq., the representative of Bridget, sister of Samuel Rolle above mentioned, who afterwards succeeded in establissiing his claim to the barony of Clinton, as derived from the said Samuel Rolle's mother, Arabella, daughter of Theophilus, Earl of Lincoln, and Lord Clinton. The manor of Calstock is now the property of his son Robert Cotton St. John, Lord Clinton. The parissi church was built chiefly at the expence of Nicholas de Asssieton, ser jeant-at-law, who died in 1465, and lies buried in the chancel, where are the figures of himself, his wife and children, engraved on brass plates. In a chapel on the north side of the chancel, is the monument of Robert Willoughby, Lord Willoughby de Broke, lord of the manor, and steward of the duchy of Cornwall, who died in or about the year 1502. Hals erroneously supposed it to be the monu ment of George Brooke, Lord Cobham, who inherited lands at Callington by marrying Anne, the eldest sister of John Lord Bray. Sir Robert Willoughby, who was created Lord Willoughby de Broke by King Henry VII., in the first year of his reign, was at the siege of Boulogne with that monarch, and was one of the chief commanders against the Cornissi rebels in 1497. He acquired the manors of Cal lington, Bere-Ferrers, &c. by marrying the heiress of Champernowne, as before mentioned. It appears that he occasionally resided, and that he died, at the manor house of Callington, for he directed by his will, that he ssiould be buried in the church of that parissi in which he ssiould die. His son Robert, by whose death the title became extinct, lies buried at Bere-Ferrers, in Devonssiire. Callington passes under the fame presentation with Southill, the mother-church. It is esteemed a parochial chapel. Calstock, in the deanery and in the middle division of the hundred of East, lies about five miles from Callington, and about the fame distance from Tavistock in Devonssiire, which is the post-office town, The principal villages in this parissi, exclusively of Calstock itself, which contains between four and five hundred in- habitants,"], [407, "CORNWALL 53 habitants, are Albeston, Chilfworthy, Harrobear, Latchley, and Metherell. The manor of Calstock was giver? by Roger Valletort to Richard, Earl of Cornwall, from which time it continued to be vested in the Earls and Dukes of Cornwall \u2022 till the year 1798, when it was purchased, under the land-tax redemption act, by John Pierson Foote, Esq. In 1806, it was conveyed by Mr.Foote to John Wil liams, Esq. of Scorrier-house, near Redruth, who is the present proprietor. The fissiery, which was formerly on lease to the Carew family, is now rented under the duchy, by the Earl of Mount Edgcumbe. The manor of Harwood, which had been held under the duchy of Cornwall, by the family bf Foote, about fourscore years, was purchased in fee, under the land-tax redemption act, in 1798, by J. P. Foote, Esq., who conveyed it to Thomas Bewes, Esq. ; it was purchased of the latter by William Roberts, Esq., the present proprietor and occupier. Cotehele or Cuttele, a singular ancient mansion, beautifully situated on the west bank of the Tamer, came into the possession of the Edgcumbe family, by the marriage of Hilaria, daughter and heir of William de Cotehele, with William de Edgcumbe, in the reign of Edward III.X After this marriage, Cotehele became for a while the chief residence of the Edgcumbe family. In the reign of Richard III., Sir Richard Edgcumbe, who was attached to the house of Lancaster, is said to have concealed himself from the resentment of that monarch, amongst his woods at Cotehele, and to have built afterwards, a chapel on the spot, in grateful remem brance of his preservation y. Carew, speaking of this place, fays, \" the buildings are ancient, large, strong, and fayre, and appurtenanced with the necessaries of wood, water, fissiing, park, and mills, with the devotion of (in times past) a rich-furnissied chapel, and with the charity of alms-houses, for certain poor people, whom the owners used to relieve z.\" Cotehele- House, which retains its ancient form, has been fitted up with furniture corresponding with its appearance, and is occasionally visited by its present noble owner, the Earl of Mount Edgecumbe. Their present Majesties, with the Princess Royal, and the Princesses Augusta and Elizabeth, honoured the late Earl and Countess of Mount Edgcumbe with a visit at this house, on the 25th of August 1788. Harrobear or Harraburrow, which was the seat of a younger branch of the Carevvs of Anthony, is now a farm-house, the property of Mr. John Worth. In the parissi-church is a burial-chapel of the Edgcumbe family, built by Richard Edgcumbe, Esq. in 1588. In this, among others, are monuments for Piers Edgcumbe, Esq., who died in 1666, and Jemima, Countess of Sandwich, widow of the brave Earl, who lost his life in the action with De Ruyter, in 1672.

There are four fairs for cattle, &c. ; March 7th, Whit-Tuesday, June 29th, and the second Tuesday in November. The principal villages in the parissi, exclusively of the Church-town, are, Berippa, Penpons, Trewithan, and Tucking-mill : the whole parissi is scattered over with cottages belonging to the miners, and contains, accord ing to the last returns, 4,7 14 inhabitants. Lord de Dunstanville's manors of Nance kuke and Tehidy (in Illogan) extend over great part of this parissi. The manors of Berippa and Penpons have long been in the St.Aubyn family, and are now the property of Sir John St.Aubyn, Bart. The manor of Tressio than belonged to the Pendarves family, and has passed with Pendarves, which was for many generations their seat. This estate was bequeathed, by Sir William Pendarves, Knt., the last heir-male, to his sister, Mrs. Grace Percival, wife of Samuel Percival, Esq., who, dying in 1763, left it by will to John Stackhouse, Esq., a younger son of Dr.William Stackhouse, of Trehane. It is now, by his father's gift, the property of Edward William Stackhouse, Esq. Menadarva, many years the seat of a branch of the Arundells of Trerice, is now a farm-house, the property of Lord de Dunstanville, whose father purchased the estate, about the year 1755, of the Arundells. John Arundell, in the early part of the seventeenth century, described this estate in his will as the manor and barton of Menadarva r ; but we have not seen it described as a manor in any other record, nor has it, of late, been considered as such.

He mentions also the chapels of St. James, St. Ye, St.Derwe, St. Margaret, and St. Anne\".

The endowment consists of a house, and twenty guineas per annum. Cardinham, in the hundred and deanery of West, lies about four miles nearly west from Bodmin, which is the post-office town ; about six, south-by-west, from Lostwithiel, and about ten, nearly east, from Lissieard. The principal villages in this parissi are, King's-wood, Old-Cardinham, and Mill-pool. The honor of Cardinham or Cardinan, which was of very extensive jurisdic tion, and of which several manors, both in distant parts of this county and of Devonssiire, were held, belonged, in the reign of Richard I., to Robert de Car dinan, who appears to have acquired the whole of the large estates of Robert Fitz- William, in marriage with his heiress'1. Isolda, the representative (probably the grand-daughter) of Robert de Cardinanb, appears to have married Thomas [de Tracy, who, in the year 1257, was in her right (as we must suppose) one of the \u25a0 Borlase's Notes from the Exeter Registers, among his MSS. in the possession of Sir John St.Aubyn, Bart. 1 It appears by the Liber Niger and Lib. Ruber de Scaccarrio, that Robert de Cardinan, who is said to have married the daughter of a Fitz-William (fee Leland), held seventy-one knights-fees in Cornwall, the largest landed property in the county, and the fame number that were, held by Robertus filius Willielmi, temp.

In 1 259, his widow, styling herself Isolda de Cardinan, who had been the wife of Thomas de Tracyc, conveyed this manor and Bodardle, in Lanlivery, to Oliver de Dinantd, or, more properly, Dinan c ; his family taking their name from Dinan, in Britanny, where they had a castle, and founded a monastery f. The ancestor of this Oliver is said to have come into England in the train of William the Conqueror : his descendant, of the same name, was in arms against King Henry II., but was afterwards reconciled to his favour. The brother of this Oliver, Gessery, was a great benefactor to Hartland Abbey, of which he seems erroneously to have been reputed the founder g. Gessery, son of Oliver, was father to Oliver who became possessed of Cardinham. It is most probable, that he was a relation of the Cardinan family, who, being origi nally a younger branch of the Dinans, on acquiring this estate by the match with Fitz-William, as before-mentioned, might have given their name to the castle, which was the scat of the honorh. The son of the last-mentioned Oliver, inheriting his name and his estate, was summoned to parliament as a baron in the year 1295. The family-name was occasionally written Dynam, and Dinham, at an' early period, and, in course of time, the latter was con stantly used. Sir John Dinham, the immediate descendant of Oliver, was a distinguissied character during the wars between the houses of York and Lan caster ; he was instrumental in conveying the Duke of York's friends, the Earls of March, Salissiury, and Warwick, from Exmouth to Guernsey, and thence to Calais, from the pursuit of King Henry VI. : after this, he attacked, in Sandwich harbour, a fleet which was destined to reduce Calais, took Lord Rivers, the admi ral, prisoner, and, sailing with the fleet to Calais, placed it at the disposal of the Earl of March, who immediately embarked, and directed his course to Ireland. On the accession of King Henry VII, Sir John Dinham, who had been summoned to parliament by writ in 1466, as Lord Dinham of Cardinham, was, in 1485, created Lord Dinham, and made Lord-Treasurer. He died without issue-male, c Probably of Wollecombe-T racy, in Devonshire: this family of Tracy became extinct, in the male line, about 2 Edw.

Glynn, Esq., the present proprietor, whose ancestor, Denys Glynn, Esq., had purchased the greater part of an eighth of the Cardinham estate, inherited by the Wreys. There are no remains of Cardinham castle, the seat of the Dinhams ; but the site is still called the Castle. Leland speaks of it as standing in the reign of Henry VII., and observes, \" to this castell longith many knights services.\"5 The custom of free-bench, similar to that at Chaddleworth and Enborne, in Berkssiire, as described in the Spectator, prevailed in this manor. Hals, who wrote about the year 1736, fays, that instances of a widow recovering her lands, by riding on the black ssieep, had occurred within the memory of persons then living. The manor of Glynn belonged, for many generations, to the ancient family of that name ; the elder branch of which became extinct in the early part of the fourteenth century, when the heiress of that branch brought Glynn to the Carmi nows ' ; a coheiress of Carminow married into the Courtenay family, of whom this manor was purchased, by a younger branch of its ancient possessors, and having ever since continued in the male line of that family, is now the property of Edmund John Glynn, Esq., elder son of John Glynn, Esq., serjeant-at-law, some time recorder of London, and member for Middlesex, who possessed and resided at Glynn.

The church of St. Cleather was in ancient times considered as part of the manor of Treglasta, and was held as such in the reign of Edward 1. by John de Ripariis, who conveyed it to Philip Cornwallis, Archdeacon of Winchester' ; the latter made it the endowment of a Chantry chapel, in the church-yard of St.Austell k ; the great tithes are now annexed to the church of St.Thomas, near Launceston, having been purchased for that parissi with Queen Anne's bounty. The advowson of St. Cleather, and the chapel of Menacuddle, in St.Austell parissi, were granted by Queen Elizabeth, in 1596, to William Bourne and James Grenge '.

At Cradoc, in this parissi, was formerly a chapel dedicated to St.Winwallocr. On St.Cleer common, are some alms-houses for poor widows, built at the expence of the late Mrs. Mary Connock, widow ; but not endowed. St.Clements is in the deanery of Powder, and in the west division of the hun dred of that name. The church-town lies about two miles from Truro, but the parissi extends to that town, and comprises a considerable part of its suburbs. The duchy manor of Moressi, comprising the greater part of this parissi, was sold under the land-tax redemption act, in 1799, to Henry Prynn Andrew, Esq., subject to the remainder of a lease of thirty years, granted to Sir William Lemon, Bart.

Polwhele, the seat of the ancient family of that name, is now the property of the Rev. R. Polwhele, the learned author of the Histories of Cornwall and Devonssiire, and other works ; whose ancestors are said to have been settled there before the Norman conquest. Drugo de Polwhele was chamberlain to the Empress Maud. William of Worcester, who wrote in the reign of Edward IV., fays, that Polwhele castle, which he describes as the property of Otho Philip, was then in ruins. It appears by the pedigree of Polwhele, that their ancestor, who then possessed the estate, was Otho Polwhele, who married a Killigrew. The present manor-house, which has of late years been occupied by the tenants of the farm, is now enlarging and fitting up for Mr. Polwhele's residence. Lambesso, where, according to Hals, was formerly the duchy prison for the manor of Moressi ', was several years the seat of the family of Lambesso, whose heiress married Ralph Tredenham : it was afterwards in the family of King, from whom it passed, by devise, to the Footes, in the reign of Charles II.

Robert Hoblyn, the other moiety having been purchased, many years ago, of the representatives of the last Earl of Radnor, whose ancestors were possessed of it (probably by purchase from Trefusis) as early as the year 1620. The barton of Cosowarth, or Cofwarth, belonged for many generations to a family of that name. John Cofwarth, of this place, is said to have been knighted by King Henry VIIL, \" for that with equal courage and hazard he took down the Pope?s bull, set up at Antwerp against his sovereign.1\" John Cofwarth, Esq., receiver-general of the county, who died in 1575, has a monument in the church.

A market at St.Columb was granted by King Edward III., in the year 1333, to Sir John Arundell, to be held weekly, on Thursday, together with an annual fair, at the festival of St.Columba the Virgin b. The principal market-day is still Thurs day ; there is a market also on Saturday in the summer. There are two fairs ; on Mid-lent Thursday, for cattle and ssieep ; and on the Thursday before Nov. 13, principally for ssieep.

Hals speaks of Bosworgy as having been in his time, for four or five descents, in the family of Keate ; and fays that, on the death of Captain Ralph Keate without issue, it devolved to Sir Jonathan Keate, of the Hoo, in Hertfordssiire. It was afterwards in the family of Crews, of whom it was purchased, by Mr. William Drew, the present proprietor. The manor of Denzell and Glivian belongs to the Vyvyan family, who have long had two seats in this parissi, called Trenowth and Trewan : they were origin ally of Trenowth, which is now a farm-house. The heiress of Trenowth married Denzell, of whose representatives the Vivians purchased. The heiress of Vivian of Trenowth and Cofwarth f, brought these estates to the Vyvyans of Trelowarren, since which time Trewan has been the seat of a younger branch of that family. On the death of the late Thomas Vyvyan, Esq., in 1812, these estates passed to Richard Vyvyan, Esq., late of Annery House, in Devonssiire, who now resides at Trewan. The manor of Ruthvos, and the manor of Treliver, both now the property of Sir William Lemon, Bart., were purchased by his grandfather, of Sir Edward Dering, Sir Rowland Wynne, and William Strickland, Esq., who married the coheiresses of Edward Henssiaw, Esq., and, through the Ropers, were representatives of one branch of the Lower family.8 The manor of Burlace-Vath, which, in the reign of Charles II., passed by sale from Typpett to Hawkey h, has lately been advertised for sale.

The manor of Nanfwhyden was purchased, about the year 1581, of the repre sentatives of John Nanfwhyden, by the Hoblyn family, and from that time till within these few years has been their chief residence. The present mansion, a large and handsome stone-edisice, was built, from the designs of Potter, atthe expence, as it is said, of 30,0001., by Robert Hoblyn, Esq., who formed there a valuable library, a catalogue of which was printed, with the portrait of the owner prefixed, under the title of Bibliotheca Hoblyniana*. Mr.Hoblyn, who died in 1756, represented the city of Bristol in three parliaments ; he was a man of considerable literary attain ments, and actively engaged in public business, particularly in what related to the important concerns of the tin-mines, having been speaker in two convocations of Stannators, and having publissied an edition of the Stannary laws, as appears by the inscription on an handsome monument in St.Columb church, which is orna mented with his bust. Nanfwhyden house was set on fire by accident on the 1st of December 1803, when the whole of the interior part was destroyed; no lives were lost, but the melted lead, which ran down copiously from the roof (the house being covered with that valuable material), rendered it extremely hazardous to attempt saving the furniture, the greater part of which was destroyed. The shell has ever since remained unrepaired, the walls being nearly entire. This estate is now the property of the Rev. Robert Hoblyn, of Bath. There is a view of the house in Dr. Borlase's Natural History. The manor as Trevithick, in this parissi, near Nanfwhyden, now the property of the Rev.

These priests probably formed the college of Black monks, spoken of by Hals, who had their residence adjoining to the church-yard. The college-house was burnt down by accident, in 1701. Hals fays, that Archbi ssiop Arundell was educated in this college ; he was a younger son of Renfrey or Humphrey Arundell, a younger branch of the Lanherne family, who married the heiress of Colessiill, and was ssieriff of Cornwall 3 Edward IV. There are no remains of buildings on the site of the college. Hals fays, there were anciently four free-chapels in this parissi, called Tregoos, Tresithny, Lanhinzy, and Ruthos, of which in his time there were no remains. The cemeteries had been converted into gardens and orchards. He mentions, also, the ruins of a chapel, called Bespalfan, or Bispalvan, called in old writings Bospol van. The rectory is in the patronage of Lord Clinton ; the parsonage-house, which is pleasantly situated at the foot of a hill, about a quarter of a mile from the church, is said to have been built by Bissiop Arundell.

The manor of Rialton, which had been given by one of the Earls of Cornwall to the Prior and convent of Bodmin, was leased by Queen Elizabeth, with the manor of Reterth or Retraigh and the bailiffry of the hundred of Pyder, to Richard Senhouse ; they were afterwards in the Munday family n, who continued to be sessees under the crown, till 1663 ; at which time, the lease expiring, it was granted to Sir Francis Godolphin. When Sidney Godolphin was made a peer, in 1684, he was described in the patent as Lord Godolphin of Rialton. The lease of this estate, having been renewed from time to time in the Godolphin family, is now vested in the Duke of Leeds, who inherits all the Cornissi estates which be longed to the Godolphins. The old mansion of Rialton, of which mention has been already made, is now occupied as a farm-house. Borlase says, that a considerable part of jt was destroyed by a fire not many years before the date of his writing \u00b0.

The borough of Grampound, in this parissi, is situated on the great road from London, through Plymouth, to the Land's-end, being 247 mjles from London, about 43 from Plymouth, eight from Truro, and about 40 from Penzance. The borough is of ancient origin, although it does not appear that it ever sent burgesses to parliament before the reign of Edward VI. John of Eltham, Earl of Cornwall, granted a gild-merchant to the burgesses of Grampound in the year 1332, and at the fame time, among other privileges, a weekly market, on Tuesday, and two fairs, one at the festival of St. Peter in Cathedra (January 1 8), and the other at the festival of St. Barnabasd.

Of late they have endeavoured to recover a small market, for victuals only, on Saturday in the morning, as subordinate to that of Tregony, on the same day.\" The market, which is still held on Saturday, con tinues to be inconsiderable. The fairs are held on the 1 8th of January and the 15th of June; another fair, called Grampound fair, formerly held on the 25th of March, in that part of the borough which is in the parissi of Probus, has for many years been transferred to the village of Probus : these are all cattle-fairs. The corporation of Grampound, which exists by prescription, there being no charter extant, consists of a mayor and eight aldermen, a recorder, and town-clerk. The mayor is elected on the Sunday before Michaelmas. The mayor for the time being chooses two aldermen, who are styled eligers, and have the power of choosing eleven freemen. These form a jury, who make presentments, appoint persons to municipal offices, and have the power to choose new freemen, the number of whom is inde finite. The members of parliament are chosen by the magistrates and freemen. The number who polled at the general election in 1812, was 63. The number of inhabitants in Grampound were 525 in 1801 ; in 181 1, 601, according to the returns made to parliament at those periods. The chapel of St.Naunter, in this borough, belongs to the corporation. Divine service is performed in it on Sunday afternoons, by the rector of Creed.

The heiress of Helligan married into the family of Kemyell of Kemyell, in St.Paul. In the reign of Richard II., Geffrey St.Aubyn became possessed of this estate by marrying with Elizabeth, daughter of Piers Kemyell. Clowance has ever since been the chief seat of the ancient family of St.Aubyn, now represented by Sir John St.Aubyn, Bart., whose ancestor of the same name was raised to that dignity in the year 1672. There is a view of Clowance house in Borlase's Natural History. This place has been much improved by extensive plantations, both by the last and the present Baronet. The manor of Binnerton belonged, in the reign of Richard II., to the Beauchamps, afterwards to the Defpencers : it is now the property of Sir John St.Aubyn, Bart., whose ancestor purchased it, in 1567, of Sir George- Speke : the manor-house is now occupied by a farmer.

His descendant, Henry de Pomeroy, was summoned to parliament, as a baron, in the reign of Henry III., being the only one of the family who was thus distinguissied. This manor, which appears to have been very extensive, continued, for several descents, in the Pomeroys. The elder branch of the Pomeroys of Tregony became extinct, in the male line, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, when, accord ing to Hals, this manor passed, with its heiress, to the Penkevils.

Sir John Colessiill, their son being then about twenty-three years of age, was slain at the battle of Agincourt, leaving an infant son, who died without issue in 1483, being then Sir John Colessiill, Knt. \\ his only sister, Joanna, was thrice married, to Sir Renfrey Arundell, a younger son of the Lanherne family, Sir John Nanfan, and Sir William Haughton. By the former ssie had two sons, Sir Renfrey, and John, who was made Bissiop of Lichfield and Coventry in 1497, and, in 1501, translated to Exeter. On the death of Sir Edmund Arundell, grandson of Sir Renfrey, without issue, Tremoderet and several other estates in Cornwall, devolved to the two sisters of Sir Renfrey Arundell the younger (mar ried to Stradling and Whittington), and their half-sister (the daughter of the heiress of Colessiill, by her second hussiand Sir John Nanfan h), married to Bolles, or their representatives. A descendant of Whittington (a Gloucesterssiire family) left six daughters coheiresses, married to Poole, Berkeley, Bodenham, Throgmorton, St. Aubyn, and Nanfan. The latter having no issue, her ssiare in the inheritance of the Colessiills was divided among her sisters. John Arundell, Esq., of Trerice, having purchased Bodenham's ssiare, left it to his second son Thomas, younger brother of John Arundell, the brave defender of Pendennis-castle. This Thomas settled at Tremoderet, and purchased, not only the smaller ssiares which had be longed to the Pooles and Berkeleys, but the two-thirds of the estate which had been purchased of the families of Danvers (heirs of Stradling) and Bolles by the Hals. f Called in some records, Emma.

Thomas Arundell died in 1648, being possessed of the whole of the estate, except St.Aubyn's inheritance and that of Throgmorton, which had been purchased by the St.Aubyns\\ In 1708 John Arundell, Esq. (the last of this branch of the family) bought what belonged to the St.Aubyns, and in 171 1 sold the whole to Sir John Anstis, Garter King of Arms, from whom the present proprietor, Thomas Bewes, Esq., of Tothill, near Plymouth, is descended in the female line. The manor-house is now occupied by the tenant of the demesne farm. William of Worcester, who wrote an Itinerary of Cornwall in the reign of Edward IV., speaks of a dilapidated castle, called Bodleit ', near Sir John Colessiill's mansion, at Tremoderet. The manor of West-North was given, in marriage with a daughter of the Ken dall family, in the reign of Edward IV., to Kelliow, whose daughter brought it to Bastard. In 1671, William Bastard, Esq. sold West-North to Sir John Anstis, before-mentioned, author of the Register of the Garter, and other heraldic works, and an industrious topographical collector, who made West-North his principal residence. The old mansion, which is much decayed, is occasionally visited by Mr. Bewes, the present owner of the estate, for the purpose of meeting his tenants, and holding his courts. The manor of Great-Trenant was, at an early period, in the Hiwis family, from whom it descended, with Tremoderet, to the Colessiills, Arundells, and Whitting tons. In 1620, it was in moieties between the St.Aubyns, in right of a coheiress of the Whittingtons, and the Gifford family k. At a later period, the whole be came vested in the family of Treise, from whom, after the decease of Sir Chris topher Treise without issue, it passed to the Morssieads. John Morssiead, Esq., of Trenant-Park, was created a Baronet in 1783. In 1806, he fold this estate to Rear-admiral Sir Edward Busier, who was created a Baronet in 1808. The manor of Bodbrane, which belonged to the Arundells of Lanherne, is now the property, by a late purchase, of Mr. Joseph Grigg. Killigorick or Kilagoric, in ancient records called a manor, belonged formerly to the baronial family of Bot treaux'. It is now the property of Richard Hall Clarke, Esq., of Bridewell, in Devonshire. In the parissi-church is the monument of Sir John Colessiill, the last of that family, who died in 1483; an altar-tomb for John Kelliow, Esq., of West- North ; and some memorials of the families of Arundell of Tremoderet, and h From papers obligingly communicated by Thomas Bewes, Esq.

The advowson of the rectory of Duloe, which was in moieties between the families of Arundell of Tre moderet and St.Aubyn, was sold by them, in 1701, to the Master and Fellows of Baliol College, in Oxford. The rectory, which is a sinecure with a stipend of fifty pounds per annum, was united to the vicarage about the middle of the last century. There was formerly a chapel at Hille, in this parissi, dedicated to the Virgin Mary.\" Egloshayle, in the hundred of Trigg and deanery of Trigg-Minor, lies one mile south-east from Wadebridge, part of which is in this parissi, and where there is a post-office and market ', and about six miles nearly west from Bodmin ; about eight east from Padstow, and somewhat more north-east from St. Columb. The principal villages in this parissi, exclusively of the Church-town and Wadebridge, are Bodeeve or Bodive, Burlawn, Slade's-bridge, Trevilder, and Treworder. The manor of Burnere or Brenere, where the Bissiops had a country-seat, be longed to the see of Exeter when the survey of Domesday was taken. At a later period, it was held under the fee by the Noseworthy family. The lease having dropped in by the sudden death of Edward Noseworthy, Esq., the last of the family, in 1701, Sir Jonathan Trelawney, then Bissiop of Exeter, granted a fressi lease to his own family. The present lessee is James West, Esq., who resides near Swansea in Glamorganssiire. The manor of Treworder belonged to the ancient family of Roscarrock, and was one of the last estates which they had in the county. There is now no manor of that name : the barton of Lower Treworder, which probably was the seat of the Roscarrocks, is now the property of the Rev. Henry Hawkins Tremayne, in right of his wife, one of the coheiresses of the family of Hearle. Crone or Croan, a seat of the Roscarrocks, was sold, by that family, to the Hills, and by the latter to the Hoblyns. Mrs. Damaris Kirkham, an heiress of the last-mentioned family, bequeathed it to the Rev. Henry Hawkins Tremayne, the present-proprietor. The house, which was lately occupied by Francis Hearle Rodd, Esq., is at present inhabited by a bailiff. The manor of Park was the property and scat of the Peverells, an ancient equestrian family, two of whom were buried in the church of the Grey-Friers at Bodmin.

In the reign of Queen Anne, it passed, by purchase, to Sir John Molefworth. It was afterwards in the Hoblyns, and passed, by the will of Mrs. Kirkham before-mentioned, to Mr. Tre mayne, by whom it has been conveyed, in exchange for other lands, to the late Sir William Molefworth, Bart., father of the present proprietor. A farm-house now occupies the site of the barton : part of the remains of the old mansion has been converted into stables. The manor of Pencarrow was, at an early period, in the family of Stapleton, nearly a century later in that of Serjeaux, which ended in coheiresses. It is now the property of Sir A. O. Molefworth, Bart. The barton was for many years the seat of a family to whom it gave name. It was forfeited, by attainder, in the reign of Henry VII., and was afterwards, successively, in the families of Walker and Molef worth. John Molefworth, a younger son of a Northamptonssiire family, settled at Pencarrow^ in the reign of Queen Elizabeth : his grandson Hender, some time governor of Jamaica, was created a baronet in 1689, with remainder to his elder brother, Sir John Molefworth, Knt., of Pencarrow (then Vice- Admiral of Corn wall) and his heirs-male. Pencarrow is now the property and seat of their de scendant, Sir Arscot Ourry Molefworth, Bart. The present mansion was built about the year 1730, with stone from a quarry on the barton estate. Borlase speaks of it as perhaps the most capacious mansion in Cornwall. The manor of Pendavy, which is said to have had extensive privileges with the royalties of the river and the bussielage of coals brought to Wade-bridge, is the property of Sir A. O. Molefworth, Bart. The barton, on which is now a farm-house, was a seat of the ancient family of Kestell, from whom it passed; by marriage, to the Moyles, and from the latter, by sale, to the Usticks. Kestell, the original seat of the family of that name, as early as the reign of King John, is now also a farm-house of Sir A. O. Molesworth's. It was sold, in 1734, by James Kestell, Esq. Tregleah, a seat of the Keckwich family, and after wards, of the Hoblyns, is now a farm-h<3ufe, the property of the Rev. H. H. Tremayne, by bequest from Mrs. Kirkham, as before-mentioned. In the parissi-church is the monument of Sir John Molefworth and his lady (with out date), and some memorials of the family of Kestell \".

Two charity schools, the one for boys, and the other for girls, conducted upon the new sys tem, and combining the plans of Dr. Bell and Mr. Lancaster, have been lately establissied, and are supported by voluntary subscription. Wadebridge, which connects this parissi and St. Breock, consisting os seventeen arches, and nearly 320 feet in length, was built in the reign of Edward IV., by public contributions, set on foot by John Lovibond, then vicar of Eglossiayle. Hals fays, that an indulgence was granted to the contributors to this bridge in the year 1485; but we find no record of any such document in the registers of the see of Exeter. The fame author adds, that Lovibond gave lands then worth 20k per annum, for the support of the bridge : these lands are not let now for quite so much. The profit of the tolls is very small. This bridge was made a county-bridge in the reign of James I. Padstow haven is navigable to Wade-bridge, whither vessels of about forty or fifty tons go up with coals, salt, lime, &c. Castle-Killibury, an ancient entrenchment, with a treble ditch inclosing about six acres, is in this parissi. Egloskerry, in the hundred and deanery of Trigg-Major, lies four miles north-west from Launceston, which is the post-office town, and nine south-east from Camelford. The only villages, except the Church-town, and part of Tregeare, are Badharlick and Trebeath. The manor of Penhele, which extends over the whole of this parissi, is one of the few which can be satisfactorily traced from the time of the Domesday survey. It was then held, with several other manors, under Robert Moreton, Earl of Corn wall, by Ricardus, whose son, William Fitz-Richard, left a daughter and sole heiress, married to Reginald, Earl of Cornwall, natural son of King Henry I. ' This Reginald gave Penhele to William Botterell or Bottreaux, the hussiand of his aunt, Alice Corbet ; and it was afterwards confirmed by him to William Bo terell the son7, who, in 11 99, gave a fine of 300 marks and two gossiawks, for livery of this manor and other lands in Cornwall s.

The latter alienated it to John Speccot % Esq., who was ssieriff of Cornwall in 1622. The grandson and namesake of this John, who was one of the members of the county in three parliaments of William HI., died in 1703, having settled this estate on the heirs-male of his aunt Long. Thomas Long, Esq. of Penhele, was ssieriff of Cornwall in 1724. Margaret, daughter and heiress of Mr. Long, brought this estate to the late John Bid lake Herring x, Esq. who resided at Penhele, and died in 1806. Two-thirds of this estate are now vested in * * * Hill, Esq., a natural son of the late Mr. Herring ; the remainder was recovered in a suit at law (after Mrs. Herring's death) of her surviving hussiand, by the Rev. Charles Sweet, of Kentiftury, in Devonssiire. The old mansion is divided in like proportions : Mr. Hill's part is occupied by a servant. The house was new-fronted by the last of the Speccot family. The barton of Tregeare, partly in this parissi, and partly in Laneast and Tres mere, has belonged, for many years, to the family of Baron. The old barton house is in the parissi of Trefmere ; a new mansion, built by the late Jasper Baron, Esq., on that part of the estate which is in the parissi of Laneast, is now occupied by his widow : Mr. Baron left a son, who is a minor. The barton of Treludick, in this parissi, which belonged also to the Barons, passed, by marriage, to Saltern ; of which family it was purchased, by the grand father of Mr. Peter Hurdon, the present resident proprietor. In the parissi-church, said to have been dedicated to St. Kyryasius orSt.Kyriacus, are some monuments of the Speccots. George Owen, Esq., of Tiverton, is patron of the vicarage, and impropriator of the great tithes, which belonged formerly to the priory of Launceston. There is a meeting-house of the Wefleyan methodists at Tregeare. - Endelyon, now spelt Endellion, in the hundred of Trigg and deanery of Trigg-Minor, lies about five miles from Wade-bridge, and about seven from Camel ford, which is the post-office town. The principal village in this parissi is Port-Isaac, where a considerable pilchard-fissiery is carried on, and there is a small market on Fridays for butchers'-meat. The principal export of this place is slate, from the Delabole quarries : coals are imported hither from Wales. Norden speaks of George succeeded Henry in 1595. * This Mr. Speccot married Lady Essex Robartes, daughter of the Earl of Radnor, by whom he had no issue : he founded a mathematical school now established at Looe.

On the death of Sir Richard Serjeaux, in 1396, it passed, by a coheiress, to the Mar neys, and was afterwards in the family of Passelew, descended from another coheiress of Serjeaux y. In 1736 the manor of Trefrike belonged to John Ham ley, Gent. It is now the property of Frederick Cock, Esq. The manor of Treore or Treroare belonged to the Boscawens. The heiress of Hugh Boscawen, Esq., who died in 1701, brought it, in marriage, to Hugh For tescue Esq., of Philleigh, in Devonssiire, grandfather of Earl Fortescue, who is the present proprietor. The manor of Roscarrcck belonged to the ancient family of that name, as early as the year 1347, at which time John de Roscarrock was one of the represen tatives of the county. In 1670 it was sold by Charles Roscarrock, Esq., who is supposed to have been the lass of the family, to Edward Boscawen, Esq. The manor has since been successively the property of the Earl of Westmorland and Dr. Mean. It was purchased of the latter by Mr. Warwick Guy, the present pro prietor and occupier, who had been many years tenant of the barton. The manor of Bodannan or Bodannon was formerly a seat of the ancient family of Chenduit, corruptly called Cheyney z. Sir John Chenduit, of this family, was one of the representatives of the county in the reigns of Henry IV. and Henry V. His son, William, left two daughters coheiresses, married into the families of Trejago and Roscarrock. An ancient uninscribed tomb in the chancel is said to have be longed to one of this family, and is, by a vulgar but groundless tradition, said to be that of a Lord Cheyney. This manor fell to the ssiare of the Roscarrocks, and was sold, in 1586, by John Roscarrock, Esq., to Nicholas Dagge, yeoman, who, in 1597, conveyed it to Henry Rolle, Esq. In 1739, it was purchased of a descendant of the same name by John Lyne, Esq., father of the Rev. Phihp Lyne, LL.D., the present proprietor. \u00bb Esch. 1 Hen. IV., 13 Edw.

It is now the property of Mrs. Clements. There are no remains of any mansion. The barton of Tresonger or Tresungers, was, in Norden's time, a seat of the Matthew's, who had married the heiress of Tresonger ; from the Matthew's it passed, by sale, to the Arthurs. It is now a farm-house, the property of William Wymond, Esq., who purchased the estate of the Arthurs. Pennant, some time a seat of the Rowes, is now a farm-house, the property of Mr. John George. Endellion church being situated on high ground, the tower is seen as a land mark at a great distance. The north aisle is the burial-place of the Roscarrocks. The church is collegiate, and has three prebendaries, exclusively of the rector. The rectory, and the prebend called the King's prebend, are in the patronage of the crown ; the prebend of Trehaverock, in that of the Hon. Mrs.Agar, .as repre sentative of the family of Robartes, Earl of Radnor; and that of Heredum-Marneyb, in the patronage of Richardson Gray, Esq., whose family have possessed the advow son of it for more than a century. The prebends are sinecures ; all the preben daries have portions of tithes ; and those of Heredum-Marney, and Trehaverock houses and glebes. The manor of Roscarrock pays, in lieu of tithes, a modus of 9I. per annum which is divided in equal portions between the rector and two of the prebendaries. This modus was formerly paid, according to an ancient custom, on the morning of Michaelmas-day, before fun-rising, in the church porch. There were formerly chapels at Roscarrock and St.Illick % of which the ruins are still to be seen. At Port-Isaac is a charity school, establissied about the year 1 804, and supported by voluntary subscriptions.

One of these, held on the 28th of July, is of modern date, the others are ancient chartered fairs ; and the right of holding them was lately purchased of the Rev. Dr. Luttrell Wynne, by Sir Chris topher Hawkins, Bart. Both these fairs belonged to the Veres, Earls of Oxford ; one of them, attached to the Earl's manor of Polsew in St. Erme, was held at a place called Long-Chepyng on Holyrood dayd ; the other, still called Penhale fair, held on the 25th of September, has been transferred from that village to Summer- Court. It belonged, in the reign of Edward II., to John le Senefchall% and in that of Edward IV. to the Veres. f The manor of Argallez or Arrallas was formerly in the Dinham family s, after wards in that of St.Aubyn. Having become vested in the crown, it was granted, successively, to the Duke of Clarence and the Duke of Gloucester11 : it is now the joint property of Sir Carew Vyvyan, Bart., and William Rassileigh, Esq. of Menabilly, by inheritance and bequest from the Carew family. The site of the manor is occupied by a farm-housc. The manor of Borthy was many years in the family of Penrosc ; afterwards in the Boscawens : it is now the property of Lord Falmouth. The barton of Carvynick was a seat of the Willoughbys, a Dorsetssiire family, whose coheiress brought it to a branch of the Arundells of Lanherne. The -heiress of Zach.

Bodanna or Bodannan, in this parissi, belonged to the Footes of Lambesso, of whom it was purchased by Mr. Johnson Vivian, great uncle of John Vivian, Esq. of Pencallenick, the present proprietor. The parissi-church, which had fallen down, was rebuilt in the reign of Charles II. Tonkin supposes, that St. Athenodorus gave name to the church and parissi. The great tithes, appropriated formerly to the college of Glaseney, are held on lease by Samuel Stephens, Esq., under the Bissiop of Exeter, who is patron of the vicar age. At Arrallas are the ruins of a chapel, and a meadow, called the Chapel meadow ; at Michel} and Hendra are meadows of the fame name, but no re mains of chapels. All these meadows pay great tithes to the vicar. Partly in this parissi as before observed, and partly in that of Newlyn, is the small borough-town of Michell, improperly so called, and still more improperly St. Mi chael: it is written in ancient records Modessiole. In the year 1301, John de Arundell certified his right to a market and fair in his manor of Modessiole : this market and fair had been granted to Walter de Ralegh, of whose son Peter, his ancestor, Ralph de Arundell, had purchased the manor \\ The market has been long disused; an annual fair is held on the 15th- of October, chiefly for ssieep, of which from three to four thousand head are generally offered for sale. The manor of Michell passed, by sale, from the Arundells to the Scawens of Carssialton in Surrey : it was afterwards in Sir Francis Basset, Bart, (now Lord de Dunstanville), of whom it was purchased by Sir Christopher Hawkins, Bart. This borough, which has sent two members to parliament ever since the reign of Ed ward VI., is governed by a portreeve annually elected at the court-leet of the High Lord, by a jury consisting of the principal inhabitants of the borough nominated by the High Lord ; which portreeve, by prescription, must be one of the five chief tenants or mesne-lords. The present portreeve (181 2) is Mr. Richard Curgen ven: the other, deputy-lords are the Rev. Henry Hawkins Tremayne ; Thomas Carlyon, Esq. of Tregrehan ; the Rev. T. Carlyon, rector of Truro and vicar of Probus, and the Rev.

Richard Carew, Esq., of Anthony, who wrote the survey of Cornwall, was one of the representatives of this borough. It appears by the registers of the see of Exeter, that there was formerly a chapel at Michell, dedicated to St. Francis ; this chapel has been long ago demolissied, and a dwelling-house built on the site. The adjoining field is still called the Chapel-field. St. Erme, in the deanery, and in the west division of the hundred of Powder, lies three miles and a half from Truro, which is the post-office town. The principal villages in this parissi, exclusively of the Church-town, are Trevispan, commonly called Trispan, Stairfoot, and that part of Tresilian which lies west of the bridge, that on the east side being in the parissi of Merther. At this bridge was concluded the treaty between Sir Ralph Hopton and Sir Thomas Fairfax, in the month of March 1646, by which the county of Cornwall was surrendered to the parlia ment. There are two annual fairs at Tresilian bridge ; viz. on the second Monday in February, and on the Monday before Whitsuntide, for cattle, &c. The manor of Polsew or Polzue, called in the Domesday Survey, Polduh, was part of the large estate held under Robert, Earl of Cornwall, at the time of taking that survey by Ricardus, and passed with the daughter of his son Wil liam Fitz-Richard, to Reginald, Earl of Cornwall. This manor was one of the estates which came into the family of Vere, Earl of Oxford, by marriage with one of the coheiresses of Serjeaux.

There are many traditional stories concerning the origin of Falmouth as a town, some of which are too ridiculous to be repeated. They all date its origin subse quently to the year 1600. As a haven, it had long before been well known and resorted to, by ssiips making for British ports, being one of the most secure and commodious in Great Britain : we first find it mentioned in the reign of Henry IV., Jane, Duchess of Burgundy, having landed there, when ssie came over to England to be married to that monarch. From the great probability that there ssiould have been a town on the ssiores of a haven so excellent, and so well known, and from the circumstance of Villa de Falmouth being mentioned by William of Worcester, whose itinerary of Cornwall was written in the reign of Edward IV., one might be led to suppose that its origin was more remote, if we had not such satisfactory evidence to the contrary. It is true, that in a map of the world, made about the year 1500, by Francesco Mauro, in the library of St. Michael Murano at Venice, Falamua, Plemua, Paesto (Padstow), and Artemua (Dartmouth), are described as the principal towns in the west of England. This must, nevertheless, have been the mistake of a foreigner, who knowing Falmouth to be one of the principal havens of this kingdom, concluded that there must have been a considerable town on its ssiores. Leland, who visited Cornwall in the reign of Henry VIII., and who scrupulously notices not only every \" praty,\" but every \" poor filchar towne,\" speaks of Falmouth as \" a havyn very notable and famose, and in a manner the most principale of al Britayne1;\" but fays nothing of any town there. In the large chart of the southern coast o.'

Norden, who visited every part of Cornwall', in 1584, for the purpose of preparing his map, describes neither town nor village at Falmouth ; nor does Carew mention any in his survey, printed in 1602. A manuscript history of the Killigrews, written by one of that family, fays, that there was' only a single house at Falmouth, besides Arwenack (the seat of the Killigrews), when Sir Walter Ralegh, being homeward-bound from the coast of Guinea, put in there; that he was entertained at Arwenack, and his men poorly accommodated at the solitary house, which, it is probable, had been originally built for the entertainment of sea-faring persons ; that this celebrated navigator, being struck with the great utility of providing more ' Itin.

It is probable, that the single house here spoken of, was single as a house of entertainment, and that there were also a few sifters' cottages, though too inconsiderable to have been described by Norden, even as a village. The act of 1664, which will be hereafter mentioned, speaking of the progress of buildings at Falmouth, refers to a time when there were only ten houses. The first attempt to enlarge this insignificant village, then called Smithick, was in 1613, when John (afterwards Sir John) Killigrew, to whom the site belonged, began to build several new houses. On this occasion, he experi enced much opposition from the corporations of Penryn, Truro, and Helston, who joined in a petition to King James, representing the ill consequences which would ensue to those boroughs, if a town ssiould be built at Falmouth harbour. The matter was referred to the Lords of the Council, and in the mean time the buildings were stopped by the King's order. The Lords of the Council having applied for information on the subject to Sir Nicholas Hals, then go vernor of Pendennis-Castle, received such ample satisfaction as to the reason ableness and utility of building a town at Falmouth, that, they decided in Mr. Killigrew's favour. The buildings, in consequence, proceeded rapidly, and the town soon became a place of great trade. It appears by the act above mentioned, that there were 200 houses in Falmouth in 1664; before the close of that century, they had increased to nearly 350; about 1750, to between 500 and 600; in 1 80 1 and 1811, according to the returns made to parliament in those years, there were 465 inhabited houses in the town of Falmouth, exclusively of 182 in that part of the suburbs which is in Falmouth parissi, and 72 at Green- Bank or Dunstanville-town, in the parissi of Budock, making altogether 719. During Cromwell's usurpation, Peter Killigrew, though of a family eminently loyal, contrived to make such interest with the existing government, as to procure consider able advantages for the then infant-town of Smithick. He is said, not only to have procured the establissiment of a market, but to have obtained an order, that the custom-house ssiould be removed from Penryn to Smithick. On the 18th of Ja nuary 1652-3, it was resolved by the House of Commons, that a weekly market ssiould be kept in the town of Smithick in the county of Cornwall ; and the At torney-General was accordingly authorized to draw up a patent for keeping the said market on Thursday in every week. There are now three weekly markets for butchers'-meat, fissi, and other provisions \u2014 Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday ; and two fairs for cattle, &c. August 7th, and November 10th. This town is first recorded by the name of Falmouth, in the charter of King Charles II., bearing date 1661, which incorporates the principal inhabitants by the style of mayor, aldermen, and burgesses. In 1664, an act of parliament was ti6 passed,"], [467, "CORNWALL 101 passed, for making Falmouth, which had, till that time, been part of St.Budock, a separate parissi. Soon after the year 1670, Sir Peter Killigrew, Bart., constructed a new quay at Falmouth, and procured an act of parliament for confirming certain duties to be payable to him and his heirs. The trade of Falmouth, which, from its advantageous situation, soon began to be extensive, and to exceed that of any other Cornissi port, has been already spoken of more in detail. Its principal im ports are, timber, hemp, tallow, grain, iron, &c. from the north ; wine, fruits, and spirits from Spain, Portugal, and Holland ; rum and sugar from the West-Indies ; and provisions, grain, &c. from Ireland ; its principal exports, tin, tin-plates, cop per, woollens, pilchards, and other fissi, oil, &c. Cotton goods from Man chester are sent in large quantities from this port to Malta, &c. A coasting-trade of considerable extent is carried on between Falmouth and London, Bristol, Plymouth, &c. Falmouth owes much of its prosperity to the establissiment of the post-office packets to Lission, the West Indies, &c. It is supposed, that it first became a station for packets about the year 1688 ; and it is known that, in 1696, packets were employed between Falmouth and the Groyne. In 1705, five packets were employed between Falmouth and the West India islands; the vessels were of 150 tons burthen, and manned with thirty men ; two years afterwards, the fame num ber of packets were employed between Falmouth and Lission. In 1755, two packets were employed between Falmouth and New York ; the next year, a packet went from Falmouth to Corunna, and another to Gibraltar. In 1763, the packets to New York were increased to four. In 1764, packets were establissied to Pensacola, St. Augustine, Savannah, and Charles-town. In 1766, an additional packet was employed on the West India station ; and in 1 768, four additional boats between Falmouth and Charles-town. In 1776, the total number of packets on the Falmouth station was nine ; in 1782, there were four to Lission, and eighteen, including office-boats, to the West Indies and America. In 1799, a fifth packet was employed on the West India station. In 1806, four packets were employed between Falmouth, Gibraltar, and Malta; in 1808, five between Falmouth and the Brazils, and three between Falmouth, Corunna, &c. ; in 1810, three between Falmouth and Surinam. The present establissiment consists of seven packets on the Lission station ; twenty establissied, and fourteen temporary packets, for general purposes. m The title of Earl of Falmouth was given, by King Charles II., in 1664, to Charles Berkeley, Lord Botetourt, and Vise.

In 1679, John, Lord Robartes, was created Earl of Falmouth ; which title he retained only six days, by reason, as Tonkin fays, of a jest ; Lady Mohun having complimented his lady on her acquisition of the title of Countess of Penny-come-quick, a name given in derision to Falmouth, by some of the neigh boring towns, which had opposed its rise. It is more probable that it was because the title of Viscount Falmouth was then enjoyed by George Fitzroy, natural son of the King, by the Duchess of Cleveland, to whom it had been given with the Earl dom of Northumberland in 1674. These titles became extinct in 1716; and in 1720, Hugh Boscawen, ancestor of the present nobleman of that title, was created Viscount Falmouth. The manor of Arwenack, which extends over this parissi, was acquired by the Killigrew family in the reign of Richard II., by marriage with the heiress of Arwenack. The Killigrews, in consequence, removed their residence from Killi grew in St. Erme, the ancient seat of the family, to Arwenack. John Killigrew, Esq., who died in 1567, built at Arwenack, what was then esteemed the finest and most costly house in the county. It has been said, that this house was set on fire during the civil war, by its owner Sir John Killigrew, who was a zealous royalist, to pre vent its falling into the hands of the parliamentary army. The manuscript history of the Killigrew family before quoted, says, on the contrary, that it was set on fire, under that pretext, by the malicious and envious governor of Pendennis-Castle. It was never wholly rebuilt after the Restoration, but partially fitted up for the occasional residence of the family. In the year 1660, William Killigrew, Esq. was created a baronet, with remainder to Peter, son of his elder brother, Sir Peter Killigrew, Knt. The title became extinct by the death of this Peter, who was the second baronet, in 1704. On the event of the death of his only son, George Kil ligrew, who was killed in an affray at an inn in Penryn, by Walter Vincent, Esq., and died without male issue, Sir Peter entailed his estates on his son-in-law, Martin Lister, Esq., who took the name of Killigrew ; but dying without issue, they passed to the descendants of Frances, the eldest daughter of Sir Peter Killigrew, Bart., above-mentioned, who left issue, and are now enjoyed by the Right Hon. Lord Wodehouse\", who married Sophia Berkeley, representative of the Killigrews. What remains of the ancient mansion of Arwenack has been divided into a Frances, daughter of Sir Peter Killigrew, married Richard Erisey, Esq., of Erisey, whose daughter, Mary, married Colonel John West, of Bruton in the county of Somerset. Mary, elder daughter and coheir of Colonel West, having taken the name of Killigrew, married John Merrill, Esq., by whom she had an only daughter, Mary, married to the Rev. Robert Bathurst. The issue of this marriage was two sons, who died without issue. Frances, the other coheiress of Colonel West, who took also the name of Killigrew, married the Hon.

The parissi-church of Falmouth, which was built soon after the Restoration, was dedicated by Dr.Seth Ward, Bissiop of Exeter, to the memory of Charles I., \" King and martyr ;\" it was made parochial by act of parliament, in 1 664, as before-mentioned. Lord Wodehouse is patron of the rectory. There are meeting-houses at Falmouth for the Baptists, Independents, Quakers, and Methodists ; a small Roman catholic chapel, and a Jew's synagogue. There is no endowed school in Falmouth, but some extensive charities for edu cating the children of the poor, are supported by voluntary contributions. A school for thirty boys and thirty girls, who are clothed and instructed in reading, writing, and arithmetic, and the girls in needle-work, was establissied about the year 1801, under the patronage of the resident clergyman. There is a Sunday school also, in which about 300 children are educated, connected with the church establissiment. A school for sixty girls on Mr. Lancaster's plan, patronized chiefly by some ladies of the Quakers' persuasion, but supported by a general subscription, was instituted in 1 8 1 1 . A school of the same description for boys, to contain from 200 to 250, has been recently establissied under the direction of the Quakers. An alms-house, containing ten small rooms for the habitation of poor widows, was erected in 18 10, at the joint- expence of Lord Wodehouse and Samuel Tregelles, Esq. The Merchants' Hospital, for the relief and support of maimed and disabled seamen, and the widows and children of such as ssiould be killed, slain, or drowned in the merchants' service, was establissied about the year 1750, under the authority of an act of parliament, passed 20 Geo.

The present income of the Merchants' Hospital at Falmouth is about 300I. per annum. There are at this time twenty-four regular pensioners belonging to this institution ; and the number of widows and children of deceased mariners, who receive relief from this excellent institution, is very considerable.0 A dispensary was establissied in or about the year 1 806, and not long afterwards a Misericordia or Benevolent Society, for the relief of the poor, particularly stran gers, under the management of a committee of visitors, the town being divided into different districts for the more convenient examination of the actual situation of applicants. There is also a Lying-in charity, establissied about the year 1800; a humane society establissied in 1812; and a charitable institution for supplying the poor with blankets, of the fame date. Adjoining to Falmouth, but in the parissi of Budockp, is Pendennis-Castle, built by King Henry VIII. on the site of an ancient fortification, which occu pied the summit of a hill commanding Falmouth harbour. John Killigrew, Esq., on whose land the castle was erected % was appointed the first gover nor, and, on his death, in 1567, he was succeeded by his son, Sir John Killigrew, Knt., who died in 1584. Queen Elizabeth repaired the forti fications, and enlarged the castle. \" Henry the Eighth,\" fays Norden, \" having warrs with the Frenche, buylte there firste a castelle, which now scrveth for the governor's howse, a strong rounde pyle ; but since Her late Majestie having like occasions with the Spaniardes, fortefied it more strongely.\" The Queen made Sir Nicholas Parker governor, on the death of Sir John Killigrew ; his successors were Sir John Parker, Sir Nicholas Hals, and Sir Nicholas Slannin'g. The latter was slain at the siege of Bristol, in 1643. Pendennis-Castle was an important gar rison of the King's during the whole of the civil war.

The manor above-described, known by the name of the Burgage manor of Fawe, and that of Langurthowe alias Langourd, in Fowey, which had always been a part of the Treffry estate, passed to the late Thomas Dormer, Esq., and Joseph Thomas Austen, Esq., in right of their wives, who were daughters of Thomas Treffry, Esq., and grandaughters of William Toller above-mentioned. They are now (the moiety belonging to Dormer having been purchased in 1808) the sole property of Joseph Thomas Austen, Esq., son of Mr. Austen above mentioned. The manor and barton of Trenant, inherited by Robert de Cardinham from the Fitz-Richards, and by him given to the priory of Tywardreth, belonged, soon after the dissolution, to the family of Fraylly : it was afterwards in a younger branch of the Rassileigh family, who had a seat at Coom within this manor. The manor of Trenant was sold to the Rassileighs of Menabilly in 1698, and is now the property of William Rassileigh, Esq. M.P. Mr. Rassileigh is also owner of the barton, which had been some time in the Treffry family, and was purchased of them, in the year 1809, by the late Mr. Rassileigh of Menabilly. The parissi-church was rebuilt in 1336, and dedicated to St. Nicholas\". The original patron-faint was St. Barre, supposed to have been St. Barrus or Fimbarrus, the first Bissiop of Cork, who, according to William of Worcester, was buried at Fowey. The church was again rebuilt or much altered, and iis present hand- some tower erected, about the year 1466. In this church is the gravestone, with engraved effigies, of Sir John Treffry, who died 16 Henry VII., and the monu- ment of John Rassileigh, Esq. 1580, Jonathan Rassileigh, Esq., of Menabilly, 1675, and several others belonging to those families ; William Rassileigh, Esq., and the Rev. John Pomeroy, vicar of Bodmin, are joint impropriators of the great tithes, which belonged to the priory of Tywardreth. Mr. Austen is patron of the vicarage. In the time of Walter Stapledon, Bissiop of Exeter, the vicarage was endowed with a dwelling-house, and the sanctuary and altarage of the parissi- church, the tithes of all water-mills, and the tithe of hay and curtilages; reserving to the priory the tithe of fissi, of two wind-mills, and the small tithes of the manor of Trenant. The tithe of fissi appears to have been held on lease by the vicars under the priory. There was formerly a chapel in this town dedicated to St. Ca- therine, which, in 1464, was leased with all its oblations and other profits to John Williams, vicar of Fowey. St. Catherine's chapel, which existed in Leland's time, gave name to St. Catherine's hill and bay. r Registers'of the see of Exetor.

The original weekly allowance to the pensioners was is. 3d. each, with il. 3s. at Christmas, for clothes, &c. The weekly allowance was increased a few years ago to 2s. 9d. each. The widows are prohibited from begging, or receiving any other stipend. Mr. Shadrach Vincent, by his will bearing date 1700, founded a school at Fowey for 30 children of voters, and endowed it with the sum of 500k, to be laid out in the purchase of lands. s This was formerly a grammar-school, but is now kept up only as a school for teaching Englissi, writing, &c. : the master has a salary of 30I. per annum., paid out of the rent of the lands. St. Gennys, in the hundred of Lefnewth and in the deanery of Trigg-Major, lies about eight miles and a half north of Camelford, which is the post-office town, and about the fame distance south-west of Stratton. The principal villages in this parissi are Crackington or Cracketton, Penkuke, and Rossiear. The manor of St. Gennys belonged to the family of Treise, and was the pro perty of the late Sir John Morssiead, Bart., who married the sister and co heiress of the last heir-male of that family. The manor of Crackhampton, commonly called Crackington or Cracketton, was part of the great possessions of the Botterell or Bottreaux family, from whom it passed by heirs-female to the families of Hungerford and Hastings. It is now the property of Lord Rolle, in whose family it has been for several generations. The manor of Treworgye, which had belonged to the prior and convent of Launceston was annexed by King Henry VIII., in 1540, to the duchy of Corn wall, being one of those given in lieu of the honour of Wallingford. The barton was for many years on lease to the family of Mill ; afterwards to the Braddons. Capt. William Braddon of this place, who had been a distinguissied officer on the parliamentary side during the civil war, died in the year 1694, and lies buried within the rails of the communion-table at St. Gennys, where is an epitaph to his memory, with some Englissi verses beginning \u2014 ' \" In war and peace I bore command, Both gown and sword I wore.\" This has occasioned a tradition which appears to be groundless, -that he was vicar of St. Gennys. It is certain that he was a member of the parliament in 1658 ; and it is probable that in Cromwell's time, as magistrate he celebrated \u2022 Polwhele'* Literary History of Cornwall, p. 57.

Treveeg, in this parissi, formerly a seat of the Yeos, is now a farm-house. Lord Eliot is patron of the vicarage, and impropriator of the great tithes, which belonged formerly to the priory of Launceston. St. Germans, in the hundred and deanery of East, a decayed market and borough town, lies about eight miles from Plymouth dock, about 23 from Launceston, and 230 from London. It takes its name from St.German, Bissiop of Auxerre, who is said to have resided at this place for a time, during his visit to England. Mr. Whitaker supposes a bissiop's see to have been establissied at this place as early as the year 614. That St. Germans was the episcopal see so long as an episcopal see existed in the county of Cornwall, he has proved in the most satisfactory manner ; but of its existence at that early period, his learned volumes on the subject of the cathedral of Cornwall afford no proof ; nor have we any intimation from history of any Bissiop of St. Germans before the year 910, when Athelstan was appointed to that see. King Athelllan made Conan Bissiop of St. Germans in 936. After the death of Bissiop Burwold, Livingus Bissiop of Cre diton procured this bissiopric to be annexed to his own, and his successor Leofric made interest to have them both united to that of Exeter. Bishop Leofric changed the seculars of a college, founded by King Athelstan at St. Germans, into canons of the order of St. Augustine, between whom and the Bissiop the manor of St. Germans was divided. Leland fays, that Bartholomew (Iscanus), Bissiop of Exeter, who died in 1172, changed the monks of St.Germans into canons regular, on account of the laxity of their lives'. At its suppression in 1535, it was valued at 227I. 4s. 8d., clear yearly income. King Henry VIII. leafed the site of the priory and other lands to John Champernown and others, and soon afterwards granted the fee to Katherine (widow of the said John), John Ridgway, and Walter Smith. Carew's story relating to the grant of St.Germans priory is as follows : k* John Champernowne, sonne and heire apparant to Sir Philip of Devon, in Henry the Eighth's time, followed the court, and through his pleasant conceits, of which much might be spoken, wan some good grace with the King. Now when the golden ssiowre of the dissolved abbey lands rayned wellnere into every gaper's mouth, some two or three gentlemen (the King's servants), and Master Champernowne's acquaintance, waited at a doore where the King was to passe forth, with purpose to beg such a matter at his hands : our gentleman be came inquisitive to know their suit ; they made strange to impart it. This while, r Collectan. I. 75. Vol. III. Q out"], [484, "CORNWALL. 114 out comes the King : they kneel down, so doth Master Champernowne. They preferre their petition ; the King graunts it : they render humble thanks, and so doth M. Champernowne. Afterwards, he requireth his ssiare ; they deny it ; he appeals to the King : the King avoweth his equal meaning in the largesse ; whereon, the overtaken companions were fayne to allot him this priory for his partage.\" Norden has strangely mistaken this story, and fays, that King Henry VIII. bestowed the priory of St. Germans upon an ancestor of the Eliots, \" being full of pleasant conceytes, wherewith the Kinge was delited.\" It is certain that the Champernowns became sole possessors of the priory estate, and that in 1565 they conveyed it to Richard Eliot, Esq. of Coteland, in Devonssiire, in exchange for that manor. Sir John Eliot, son of Richard, was a distinguissied patriot in the reign of James I., an active opposcr of the Duke of Buckingham and the court measures, particularly that of raising taxes without the consent of Parlia ment : for some bold speeches on this subject he was committed to the tower, where he died, in the year 1632. Daniel Eliot, his grandson, left an only daughter, married to Browne Willis, the celebrated antiquary, by whom we are informed that his father-in-law, in order to keep up the family name, bequeathed his estates to Edward Eliot, grandson of Nicholas, fourth son of Sir John above mentioned. The grandson of this Edward Eliot was, in 1784, created Baron Eliot, of St.Germans, and in 1789 had His Majesty's permission to take and use the name and arms of Craggs, in consequence pf his father's marriage with a natural daughter of Secretary Craggs, in 1726. His grandson and successor, Edward Eliot Craggs, now Lord Eliot, is the present possessor of the priory estate and manor of St. Germans, as well as lessee of the Bissiop's manor. Port Eliot, His Lordssiip's residence, was formerly called Porth-Prior : it occupies the site of the priory, but retains no traces of the conventual buildings. The old paintings mentioned by Mr. Whitaker as having belonged to the priory are now in the gallery ; among other portraits at Port Eliot, are those of Sir John Eliot the patriot, Locke, Hampden, Secretary Craggs, Major-Gen. Richards, the brave defender of Alicanf, and several family pictures by Sir Jossiua Reynolds ; among which is one of his earliest groupes, painted in the year 1 746. The town of St. Germans had a market when the survey of Domesday was taken; it was then held on Sunday, but had been reduced to almost nothing in consequence of the Earl of Moreton's market (most probably Saltassi), then lately establissied in the neighbourhood. The market was afterwards changed to Friday ; in Browne Willis's time, it was very inconsiderable, and has been long wholly discontinued. There are two cattle fairs, May 28, and August 1. Leland"], [485, "CORNWALL. 115 Leland calls St.Germans \" a poor fischar town,\" and adds, that \" the glory of it stood by the priory.\" Carew, speaking of this town, fays, \" the church-towne mustereth many inhabitants and lundry ruines, but little wealth, occasioned eyther through abandoning their fissiing trade, as some conceive, or by their being abandoned of the religious people, as the greater sort imagine.\" The town of St. Germans is governed by a portreeve, who is elected annually at the lord's court-leet, and forty censors. It has sent two members to parliament ever since the year 1562 ; the right of election is vested in all householders who have resided twelve months within the limits of the borough : there are only nineteen houses within the limits. Besides the borough and vill of St.Germans, the parissi contains the hamlets of Bake, Catchfrench, Coldrinnick, Cuddenbeck, Cutcrew, Hendra, Molineck, Polemartin, Tressielly, and part of Tidiford. There is no village of any size except Hessingford, which contains about twenty houses. The manor of Cuddenbeck has been long held on lease under the Bissiops of Exeter by the Eliot family. The mansion, which was a country-seat of the Bissiop's, was some time a jointure-house of that family ; and in 1793, was occu pied by the widow of Daniel Eliot, Esq. : it is now a farm-house, retaining some vestiges of its ancient consequence. The manors of Hessitn, Little-Deviock and Molineck, and the barton of Hendra, belong to Lord Eliot. Hessiin has been in the family more than two centuries. Little-Deviock had been successively in the Mohuns, Courtenays, Carews, and Rassileighs, and was purchased of the latter about the year 1767 : Molineck, which had been the ancient property and seat\" of the Scawens, was purchased about 1780. Hendra, now a farm-house, some time a seat of the Austens, and afterwards of the Hancocks, was purchased of the representatives of the latter (the Kellys of Kelly in Devonssiire), by the late Lord Eliot. The manor of Bake was anciently in a family of that name, from whom it passed, by a female heir, in the reign of Edward III., to the Moyles, who have resided at this place for many generations. Thomas Moyle, of Bake, was Speaker of the House of Commons in the reign of Henry VIII. Walter Moyle, who was chosen member for Saltassi in the 7th year of King William, distinguissied himself in the house by his speech, in support of the bill for the encouragement of seamen. He soon afterwards relinquissied his seat in parliament, and spent his time chiefly in studious retirement, at Bake, where he died in 1 721, at the age of 49.

He was created a baronet in 1778, being described of Sprotborough. Sir Joseph Copley has another manor in this parissi called Trewall. The manor of Bonialva, formerly parcel of the possessions of the prior and convent of Launceston, was one of those annexed to the duchy of Cornwall, in lieu of the honor of Wallingford, in 1540: it is now the property of Francis Glanville, Esq. The manor of Maders belonged to the Vyvyan family, of whom it was pur chased, in 1761, by the late Rev. Jossiua Howell : his son, David Howell, Esq., gave it in exchange for other lands to the Trelawnys of Coldrinnick. Coldrin nick was for many generations the seat of a younger branch of the Trelawnys, which became extinct by the death of Charles Trelawny, Esq., in 1764.

South-Paderda, the seat of the ancient family of Paderda, was purchased in 1763, by the Rev. J. Howell, of Mr. Peter Charlick, and exchanged with the Trelawnys for other lands. Catchfrench, now the seat of Francis Glanville, Esq., was for several generations in the family of Kekewich, who acquired it by marriage with the heiress of Talverne of Talverne, in Northill : it was afterwards in the Bos cawens, from whom it passed, by a female heir, to the Fortescues : in 1728, it was purchased of Hugh Fortefcue, Lord Clinton, by Julius Glanville, Esq., ancestor of the present owner.

The chapel of St.Germoe, or Germoch, who is said to have been an Irish king, was given by William, Earl of Gloucester, to the priory of St.James in Bristol. St.Germoe is considered as a separate parissi, but the church is subordinate to that of Breage, and included in the same presentation.

The principal villages in the parissi are, Burnthouse, Ponfnooth and Trelufwell. The manor of Cosawis, Casawse or Gosose, belonged to the Bodrugans, and after the attainder of Sir Henry Bodrugan, was given by King Henry VII. to Sir Richard Edgcumbe, whose descendant (Lord Mount-Edgcumbe) has lately sold it to Sir William Lemon, Bart. The barton of Casawse was formerly a seat of the Carveths, as lessees under the Edgcumbe family, and the birth-place of Capt. Carveth, a distinguissied naval officer in the reign of Charles II. On the death of the last heir-male of this family, it passed to the Levertons. Casawse is now a farm-house. Roscrow is said by Hals to have been, at an early period, the seat of a family to whom it gave name, and who became extinct in the reign of Henry VI. ; but his account is incorrect, when he states that it passed by female heirs to the family of Pendarves.

There was formerly a chapel dedicated to St. Magdalen, near Casawse, supposed to have been a chantry chapel connected with Glaseney college. The ruins of it remained in 1736/ The borough of Penryn, an ancient town which lies within the parish of Gluviasd, was incorporated by King James I. The corporation consists of a mayor, recorder, portreeve, eleven magistrates, and twelve assistants. King James's charter gave this town the privilege also of sending two members to parliament. The right of election is in the freemen at large, the number of whom at the last election (in 181 2) was nearly three hundred. The boundaries of the borough extend about half a mile north of the town.

Hals's stories are not much to be depended on ; it is more certain that ssie was divorced from her hussiand, and that in consequence ssie was protected by the inhabitants of Penryn, who bore no good will to Sir John Killigrew, and his rising town of Smithick.6 Jane Lady Killigrew was daughter of Sir George Fermor, Knt., of Easton-Neston, ancestor of the Earl of Pomfret : ssie died in 1648.

Penryn was a garrison of the King's during the civil war : it was surrendered to Sir Thomas Fairfax, in the month of March i646.s The manor of Penryn-Foreign and Penryn-Borough have belonged, from time immemorial, to the Bissiops of Exeter, who had formerly a country-house at or near Penryn. The college of Glaseney, in Penryn, of which there are now no remains,was founded in the thirteenth centuryfor secular canons and vicars. The foundation is generally attributed to Walter Stapledon, Bissiop of Exeter, who died in 1326 ; but Leland fays, \" Walter Good or Brunscombeh made it yn a more called Glasenith, in the bottom of a park of his for a provost, twelve prebendaries, and other ministers.\" Bissiop Grandison, who died in 1369, was so great a benefactor to this college, that he ssiares the honour of the foundation. It was dedicated to the Virgin Mary and St. Thomas the Martyr. The tithes of St.AlIen, St. Budock (including Gluvias), and St. Feock, were appropriated to this college, the revenues of which, at its suppression in 1535, were estimated at 205k 10s. 6d. clear yearly value. It appears by the will of Thomas Killigrew, bearing date 1500, that the church of St. Thomas the Martyr, at Glasenith, was then re-building, for he bequeaths the sum of 100 marks to the new fabric. Leland describes Glasenith college as \" strongly wallid and castellid, having three strong towers and gunnes at the but of the creek.\" In another place he speaks of it, as \" a college well wallid and dyked defensably1, cawled St.Thomas, wher be secular canons and a provost.\" The last tower of Glaseney college was pulled down about the beginning of the last century, and a dwelling-house built on the site, which belongs to Lord de Dunstan ville, by inheritance from the Pendarves family. Most of the lands belonging to Glaseney college came into the possession of the Godolphin family, and are now the property of the Duke of Leeds. Queen Elizabeth founded a grammar-school at Penryn, and endowed it with 61. 1 3s. 4d. per annum, issuing out of the duchy of Cornwall. There was formerly a chapel in Penryn, as appears by the following passage of Leland : \" a chapel in the town, and a quarter of a mile out of it the paroch chirch.\" There are meeting-houses at Penryn, for the Independent and Wesleyan methodists. * Whitlocke. \" Bishop of Exeter, who died in 1280.

The barton-house of Trevascus, which had been successively the residence of the families of Trevascus and Hoblyn, has been taken down. Mr.Slade Gully resides at the barton of Trevenen, which had been the seat of his ancestors, the Slades\", at least as early as the reign of Queen Elizabeth. The manor of Trevenen, partly in this parissi and partly in St. Ewe, belonged to the priory of Tywardreth, and was one of those annexed to the duchy of Cornwall by King Henry VIII. in 1540, in lieu of the' honour of Wallingford. The manor of Treveage, which belonged also to the Hoblyns, and pasted by a female heir to the Bickfords, was purchased of the latter by William Slade Gully, Esq., who is the present proprietor. There are two farm-houses on the barton estate. The manor of Treveor was formerly the property and seat of a family of that name. Tonkin speaks of a part of the mansion of Sir Henry Treveor as remain ing in 1736. The manor afterwards belonged to the Scawens : it is now the property of Thomas Graham, Esq. The manor of Goloures belonged to the equestrian family of Hiwis or Hewissi, from whom it passed by a female heir to the Colessiills1.

This estate is now the joint property of Lord Clinton, as representative of the Trefusis family; and Sir John St.Aubyn, as heir of one branch of the Godolphins. The manor of Bodrugan or Bodrigan belonged to an ancient family of that name, who held it under the Champernowns\". This family became extinct in the male line of its elder branch, about the year 1330. In the reign of Richard III. this place was the property and seat of Sir Henry Bodrugan, an opulent knight, whose name is said to have been originally Trenowth. It does not appear how he was con nected, or whether he was at all connected, with the ancient Bodrugan family ; it is very probable that he took the name, as was not unusual, upon settling at this barton. Hals speaks of this change of name, but Tonkin doubts it. Leland, who lived so near his time, does not mention the circumstance ; but Norden, writing in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, calls him Sir Henry Trenowth. It is certain, however, that he bore the name of Bodrugan ; and, having been attainted on the accession of King Henry VII., fled into Ireland, and his large estates, including this manor and barton, were seized by the crown. Tradition relates, that Sir Henry Bodrugan was in arms in Cornwall, against the Earl of Richmond ; that he was defeated on a moor not far from his own castle, by Sir Richard Edgcumbe and Trevanion ; and that he made his escape by a desperate leap from the cliff into the sea, where a boat was ready to receive him \\ Most of Bodrugan's estates, including this manor, were granted to Sir Richard Edgcumbe, and now belong to his descendant the Earl of Mount- Edgcumbe. Borlase p describes the remains of Bodrugan castle as very extensive, and fays, that there was nothing in Cornwall equal to it for magnificence. He describes a chapel converted into a barn, the large hall, and an ancient kitchen with a timber roof; and supposes the architecture to have been about the time of Edward I. All these buildings were pulled down about the year 1786. A great barn, spoken of also by Dr.Borlase, and described as capable of containing one thousand bussiels of wheat in the straw, still remains.

The great manor of Conarton, as parcel of the honor of Gloucester, belonged, before the conquest, to Brictric, a Saxon. The Conqueror gave it to Alan Earl of Britanny, but being resumed by the crown, it was settled on Queen Maud. William Rufus gave it to Robert Fitzhamon, whose daughter brought it by mar- riage to Robert, the illegitimate son of King Henry I., who was created Earl of Glou- cester1'. Robert Earl of Gloucester, son of this Robert, gave Conarton, in 1154, to Richard Pincerna (Butler), whose son took the name of Conarton, from his residence on this manor ; the grandson, settling at Lanherne, took the name of Lanherne, and his heiress brought both manors, with other large estates, to the Arundells. This great manor, to which many extensive privileges, together with the lordssiip of the hundred of Penwith0, are annexed, was purchased not long ago, of Lord Arundell, by Sir Christopher Hawkins, Bart. Most of the lands be- longing to it had been before alienated. The site of the manor of Conarton, which anciently gave name to the parissi, is said to have been formerly occupied by a large town, which had two parissi-churches. This must have been what Leland calls Nikenor ; his account of which is as follows : \" Nikenor a 2 miles from Ryvier, sumtyme a great town, now gone ; 2 paroch chirches yet scene, a good deale several on from the other, sumtyme in the towne, but it is now com monly taken to be in St.Guivians paroch./ ' The manor of Godrevy, which formerly belonged to a family of that name, extends into this parissi : the greater part of the estate, which is in Gwithian, be longs to Lord De Dunstanville, and was purchased chiefly of the Arundells of Menadarva, in 1740\"*.

The disproportionately high valuation of the rectory of Gwithian, in the old Valors, when compared with that of other parissies, which were then rated much lower, though now of very superior value, affords a probable conjecture that much land has been lost by the influx of the sand. It is known by oral tradition, that whole farms have been overwhelmed, at a period not very remote. We have been informed by Mr.Hockin, the rector, who has obligingly favoured us with a communication on this subject, that the barton of Upton, one of the principal farms in Gwithian, was thus overwhelmed ; that his great-grandfather remembered the occupier residing in the farm-house, which was nearly buried in one night, the family being obliged to make their escape from the chamber- windows. It is very remarkable that the ruins of this house, which had never been seen by the oldest man living, were again exposed to view in consequence of the shifting of the sands in the winter of 1808-9. The present rector remembers two fields lost at Gwithian, having been buried with sand ten or twelve feet deep. The church-town would have ssiared the same fate, had it not been prevented by the timely exertion6 of the church wardens, who, with all possible expedition, caused large plantations to be made of a species of russi, which grows abundantly in that neighbourhood, and by the rapid spreading of its long fibrous roots, affords the only known method of checking the progress of the sands.* In this parissi is an extensive earth-work, called Trevarnon Rounds ; it has a moat and rampart, with an advanced work, which seems to have been occupied in limes not very remote, a cannon-ssiot having been dug up within its site, by some labourers employed by the late rector.

Helston, an ancient borough and market-town in the deanery and in the west-division of the hundred of Kirrier, lies on the great road from London to the Land's-end, seventeen miles from Truro, thirteen from Penzance, and 274 from London. In the year 1201, the men of Helston gave forty marks of silver, and a palfrey, to King John, that their town might be made a free borough, and have a mer catorial gild\". King Edward I. made it one of the coinage towns. Various privileges were granted to the burgesses by succeeding monarchs, and these were confirmed by Queen Elizabeth, who, by her charter (in the year 1585), incor porated them by the name of the mayor and commonalty of the borough of Helston. The corporation consists of a mayor, four aldermen, a recorder, town clerk, and an indefinite number of freemen, who are chosen by the majority of the mayor and aldermen. The mayor is elected by the majority of the aldermen and freemen, out of two aldermen nominated by the mayor and aldermen. The borough of Helston has returned members to parliament, ever since the reign of Edward I. The right of election is vested in the corporation, mayor, aldermen, and freemen0; the present number of freemen is about twenty. It appears by Brown Willis's Notitia Parliamentaria, that in the early part of the last century, there were about seventy resident freemen, and ten non-residents.

The fairs, which are considerable marts for cattle, are now held on the day before Midlent-Sunday, Whit-Monday, July 20th, September 9, and St. Simon and St. Jude's day. Vast quantities of ssioes, mostly made at Helston, are exposed to sale at the fairs and markets, and carried to Redruth market and elsewhere. The tolls of the fairs, market, and mills form part of the town revenues, under a grant of Richard King of the Romans. Helston was one of the decayed towns, for the repair of which an act of parlia ment was passed in the reign of Henry VIII. p, but, as Norden observes, the success was not answerable to the meaning. According to a poll tax taken in 1694, there were then 1,348 inhabitants in this town''; in 1801, their number was 2,248; in 181 1, 2,297, according to tne returns made to parliament at those periods. Sir Francis Goldolphin was in 1705 created Baron Helston, and Earl of Godolphin. William of Worcester, in his Itinerary of Cornwall, written in the reign of Edward IV., speaks of Helston Castle, some time the residence of Edmund, Earl of Cornwall, as being then in ruins. There are now no remains of it ; the site, which commands a view down the valley of the Looe-pool, is now a bowling green : at the north end of it has been built, a house for the Duke of Cornwall's officers, and a new coinage hall. The first symptoms of the Cornissi rebellion in the year 1549, are said to have broken out at Helston, where a person of the name of Hody was killed by one Kiltor and his associates, as he was sitting in commission on matters of religion. The manor of Helston, as having been parcel of the duchy of Cornwall, under went a temporary alienation during the interregnum in the seventeenth century, when it was sold to Anthony Rowse. In 1798 it was sold, under the powers of the land-tax redemption act, to John Rogers, Esq., of Penrose, who is the present proprietor. Mr. Rogers has also the manors of Helston-Tony, and Helston- Chamond : the former was purchased of the representatives of the Robartes family. It had been, at an early period, in the family of Tony, and had palled by a female heir to the Beauchamps.

St. Hilary, in the deanry and in the east division of the hundred of Penwith, lies two miles nearly east of the town of Marazion, which is in this parissi, and is the post-office town ; and five miles nearly east-by-north from Penzance. The principal villages in the parissi are, Higher and Lower Downs, Relubbas, Refud gian, Tregurtha, and Trevennor, adjoining Marazion. The manor of Treveneage was purchased by Sir Nicholas Hals, about the year 1600, of Sir Thomas Arundell of Tolverne : John Hals, Esq., his son and heir, sold it to Mr. Walker of Exeter. In 1649 it was purchased by John Tredenham, Esq., from whom it descended, through the Scobells, to Sir Christopher Hawkins, Bart., the present proprietor. The barton of Treveneage belonged to the ancient family of Gaverigan, and passed with one of its co-heiresses, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, to the Godolphins. Trevarthen is a large estate belonging to the Duke of Leeds, as heir of the Godolphin family : the barton, where is now a farm house, was some time a seat of the Davies family, as lessees under the Godolphins. The manor of Tregurtha, otherwise Truthwall, in this and some neighbouring parissies, belonged to the Penneck family, who purchased part of it of Robins about 1706. It is now the property of William Carne, Esq., and the repre sentatives of the late Thomas Grylls, Esq.j by purchase from the devisees of Penneck. Tregember or Trethegimber belonged to the family of Grosse, from whom it passed, by successive sales, to King and Penneck : the latter pur chased it in 1684.

The rectory of St. Hilary belonged to Sir James Smith, of Little Chelsea, who died in 1681 ; in 1700 it was purchased, under a decree of Chancery, by John Penneck, Esq., of Tregember. It has of late years been sold in lots. The patronage of the vicarage is vested in the lords of the manor of Pengersick in Breage.\" In Palmer's Nonconformists' Memorial is an account of Mr. Joseph Sherwood, who was ejected from this vicarage by the Bartholomew act in 1662. It is there related that Mr. Sherwood, having been cited to appear before the justices for preaching in defence of that act, then prophesied that Mr. Robinson, one of the magistrates, who had ordered him to be committed to Launceston jail, ssiould die a violent death, which is stated to have happened a few days afterward, in consequence of his having been gored by his own bull, never before known to be vicious.

In the reign of Henry I., Alan, Earl of Brittany and Cornwall, gave ten shillings rent, issuing out of the profits of the fair at Merdresein, to the prior of St. Michael y. We have seen the copy of a charter of Richard, King of the Romans and Earl of Cornwall, in the reign of Henry III., by which he grants to the prior and convent of St.Michael, that the three fairs and three markets, which they held under the charter of the kings of England at Marghas-bigan on land not their own, they ssiould in future hold at Marchadyon on their own land, near their grange. The fairs are stated to have been held, for two days each, at Midlent, at Michaelmas, and at the festival of the apparition of St. Michael in the Mount z. The market days are not stated. By the mention of three, the town appears to have been a place of great trade and importance. In the year 1331, a market on Monday and a fair for three days, at the festival of St. Andrew, was granted to Ralph de Bloyon a. There is now only one market, which has from time immemorial been held on Saturday, and is well supplied with butchers' meat, fissi, vegetables, and poultry. Ready-made ssioes are sold in considerable quantities. Two of the more ancient fairs, now held on Midlent Monday and Michaelmas day, are still kept up ; and there are two others held under Queen Elizabeth's charter, one on St. Barnabas day, the other on St. Andrew's, being the day of Ralph de Bloyon's fair. These two fairs are very inconsiderable ; the latter is held at the bottom of the town. The Midlent and Michaelmas fairs, which are for cattle, clothes, &c, are held near the old priory barn and farm (the ancient grange), in the village of Trevennor, adjoining Marazion.

The corpora tion of Marazion, which exists under this charter, consists of a mayor, eight burgesses, and twelve capital inhabitants. It has been said that the borough of Marazion formerly sent members to parliament ; but that after it became decayed and impoverissied, it neglected to return them as before. We cannot find any evidence of this, although Hals speaks of it on the authority of the Tower records. Dr.Borlase, in his MS. collection, gives an account of two members, Thomas Westlake, Esq. and Richard Myll, Esq., being returned for Marazion in the year 1658, but it does not appear that they ever took their seats, as their names are not to be found in the lists of that parliament. Leland speaks of a chapel in Marazion, and another in the sand, near the Mountb: the latter probably was the fame which Dr.Borlase speaks of, by the name of the chapel of St.Catherine, on the chapel-rock, near Marazion ; of the latter there are no remains. The present chapel in the town, we suppose to be the same which Leland describes ; and which, as it appears by the registers of the see of Exeter, was dedicated to St.Ervat. There are two meeting-houses in the town; one belonging to the methodists ; of the other we could not obtain any description. Adjoining to the parissi of St.Hilary', opposite to the town of Marazion, and connected with it by a narrow causeway of pebbles, passable at low water, is the very singular pyramidical insulated mass of rocks, called St. Michael's Mount, which gives name to the adjoining bay. There has been much written on the subject of some ancient traditions, which tell us, that this mount was formerly attached to the ssiore, and surrounded with trees. These traditions appear per fectly groundless\": Dr.Berger has (hewn very satisfactorily, from the position of the \" Itin.VII. 117. c The late J. Pn<-e, Esq. of Penzance, in his MS. history of St. Michael's Mount, supposes that the church of St.Michael-on-the-Mount was the mother-church of this parish, and that St.Hilary is of much later date. This seems very probable, for it appears that the ancient cemetery for the town of Marazion was at the Mount; and that in the year 1313, they were first permuted to bury at St.Hilary, because of the danger of the flux of the sea near St. Michael's Mount. (See Polwhele, Vol. III. p. 15. of the Supplement.) Mr.Whitaker supposes that the district called Vennefire, given to the priory of St.Michael by Edward the Confessor, was what is now the parish of .St.Hilary. * The original name of the Mount, respecting which no two writers seem to agree, has been frequently brought forward in confirmation of thii tradition.

III."], [512, "CORNWALL. 138 the strata, that St. Michael's Mount could not have been separated from the land, but by some great convulsion, far beyond the reach of tradition or historical record. The height of the Mount, from the level of the sea to the platform of the tower of the chapel, is 231 feet. The whole of the island contains about seven acres of land : at the foot of the Mount is a level piece of ground, where is a wharf, and near it a considerable village. It has been supposed, with great probability, by several writers', that this was the island called Lmc, mentioned by Diodorus Siculus, whither the tin, when refined and cast into cubic ingots by the Britons, who dwelt near the promon tory of Belerium, was carried in carts over an isthmus, only dry at low water. St. Michael's Mount certainly tallies with his description, in the circumstance of its connexion with the land of Cornwall at low water: and its situation with respect to the mining district, adds great strength to the conjecture. Others, influenced in a great measure by the similarity of name, have conjectured that by the island Iclis, Diodorus must have meant Infula Veclis, now the Isle of Wight ; a very unlikely place, on account of its distance from the tin-mines, to have been made the depository for the British tin to be brought thither in carts, with a view to its being transported to Gaul ; when so many good ports were to be found so much nearer. It appears that in Leland's time there were at the foot of the Mount certain houses with ssiops for fissiermen. Before the year 1700, the place had become so far decayed, that there remained only one cottage, inhabited by a widow-woman. In the years 1726 and 1727, Sir John St.Aubyn (the third baronet of that name) rebuilt the pier; in consequence of which, several houses were erected, the fissieries revived, and the Mount became a place of considerable trade. There were in 1B1 1, fifty-three houses at the Mount, eight of which were then uninhabited. A stone pier had been built at Marazion early in the fifteenth century. An indulgence of forty days remission of penance was granted by the Bissiop of Exeter, to all such persons as ssiould contribute to it. In 1425, Edward the Confessors charter granted to the monks of St.Michael a harbour, called Ruminella, with its appur tenances. This has been supposed by some, to have been Romney in Kent ; but it is much more probable that it was a haven at the Mount, although its ancient name has been wholly forgotten, as well as that of the district of Vennefire. churches being swallowed up by the sea, between that place and the Scilly Islands.

It appears by the charter, that there was at that time a castle* as well as a convent on the Mount. In the reign of Richard I., Henry de Pome- roy, being in the interest of John Earl of Cos n wall, during Richard's imprison- ment in Austria, took possession of St.Michael's Mount by stratagem, fortified it, and continued to hold it after the King's return ; but on the approach of Arch- bissiop Hubert Walter's army, assisted by the ssieriff of Cornwall and the posse comitatus, surrendered the garrison without resistance, and threw himself upon the King's mercy. It is said that he died soon afterwards through grief, despairing of a pardon. It appears that in the year 1204, Henry de Pomeroy the younger gave sixty marks to be restored to certain possessions, in as ample a manner as his father enjoyed them, before he entered the castle on St.Michael's Mount. Be- sides this douceur to the King, he bestowed on the Knights Hospitallers the church of St. Maddern, in Cornwall'. After the surrender of Pomeroy, King Richard restored the convent to the Gilbertines, who had been dispossessed, and placed a small garrison of soldiers in the castle. After the battle of Barnet-field, John Earl of Oxford, having fled into Wales, assembled a party of soldiers, and crossed over with them to the Cornish coast.- On their arrival, they disguised themselves as pilgrims coming to pay their devo* tions, as was customary at the church of St.Michael15: under this pretence they got entrance to the castle, and soon overpowered the small garrison by which it was defended. Sir John Arundell, who was in the first instance sent against the Earl of Oxford, having summoned the castle without effect, made a vigorous * As we are told, that Henry de Pomeroy procured entrance into the Mount under pretence of visiting a sister who was one of the religious of that place ; it has been supposed by some, that there was a nunnery on the Mount, distinct from the priory : but it may be observed, that nuns formed a part of the establishment in all convents of the Gilbertines. * The word ca/lellis in the charter, can scarcely be considered as a word of course; it docs not follow that there were no fortification* on the Mount (as Mr.Whitaker supposes) before Henry de Pomeroy's time, because there is no mention of them in history.

This information appears to have been pub lished with much diligence in every part of the kingdom ; and it occasioned, as might have been rjpefted, a great resort of pilgrims to St.Michael's Mount.

The patent grants a free pardon to all persons engaged in the rebellion, except the Earl, his sons George, Thomas, and Richard, Lord Beaumont, and Sir * * * Burdettk. Fortefcue made an unsuccessful attack on the castle ; but at length, after a long siege, from the last day of September till the 15th of February following, the Earl, after demanding a parley, agreed to surrender it, on condition of a pardon to himself and his adherents. The King chose to consider this pardon as extending only to life ; and he was imprisoned in the castle of Hamms in Picardy, till the year 1485, when he came over with the Earl of Richmond, and was in the action of Bosworth-field. The next remarkable circumstance connected with the history of St.Michael's Mount, is, that Perkin Warbeck, who represented himself to be Richard, the younger son of King Edward IV., supposed to have been murdered in the tower, having landed with a party of his friends from Ireland, in Whitfand-bay, in the month of September 1498, was admitted into the castle by the monks, who were favourable to the house of York ; he immediately put the fortifications in a state of defence; and soon afterwards marching with his forces to Bodmin, he left his wife, the Lady Katherine Gordon, at the Mount, as a place of security. She remained there till after the unsuccessful termination of his enterprise, when King Henry sent the Lord Daubeney to bring her thence to the royal presence. The King is said to have taken compassion on her misfortunes, and to have granted her a competent maintenance, which ssie enjoyed till her death. When the priory of St.Michael, which by Robert Earl of Cornwall had been made a cell to the monastery of St. Michael in Normandy, was seised into the hands of the crown during the wars with France, it was first given to King's College in Cambridge', afterwards to the monastery of Sion in Middlesex, to which it continued to be attached till the dissolution.

Having left the Mount, of which he was governor, several Cornissi gentlemen, well affected to the King, took possession of it ; but it was soon recovered by Arundell, who immediately dispatched a party of horse and foot to besiege itm. After some partial successes, Arundell was defeated by Lord Russell in Devonssiire, taken prisoner, and executed in London. The government and revenues of St.Michael's Mount were granted on lease by the King, to Job Militon, Esq., ssieriff of Corn wall. The lease was renewed to his son William, and to William Harris, Esq. of Heyne in Devonssiire, who married the widow of the latter. Arthur Harris, Esq., son of William, died governor of the Mount, in 1628. In the year 1599, long before the expiration of Harris's lease, the fee was granted to Thomas Bellott and John Budden, as trustees, it is probable, for Robert Earl of Sahssiury, to whom it was by them conveyed. William, the succeeding Earl of Salissiury, alienated it to Francis Bassett, Esq. of Tehidy, afterwards Sir Francis Bassett, Knt., who, in the year 1642, was required, by the King's commanders in the West, to fortify the Mount for His Majesty's service ; and in consideration of the expences which would be incurred by so doing, they ordered that certain estates, formerly be longing to the priory of St.Michael's, and which had been reserved by the Earl of Salissiury, when he sold the Mount to Mr. Bassett, ssiould be sequestered (the said Earl being disaffected to His Majesty's service) to the use of the said Sir Francis\".

The principal villages in this parissi are, Pool, and Portreath or Bassets-Cove, where is a small haven for the importation of coal and lime, and the exportation of copper-ore to the copper-works in Wales. The pier was begun in 1760, by a company who had taken a lease from the late Francis Basset, Esq. The haven has been much improved by the company who now hold it under Lord De Dun- stanville: they have laid out io,o\u00a9o/. on the pier, and a large sum on making a road to the Gwennap mines. The manor of Tehidy, called in ancient records Tydy, Tihidi, Tyhudy, Tehedie, &c. &c, belonged, at a very early period, to a branch of the baronial family of Dunstanville, from whom, about the year 1200, it passed in marriage to the Bassets of Ipsden in Oxfordssiire, descended from a younger son of Ralph Basset, the justiciary in the reign of Henry I. The Basset family distinguissied themselves for their loyalty during the civil war in the seventeenth century. Sir Francis, then the head of the family, was vice-admiral of Cornwall, and governor of the Mount ; his brother, Sir Arthur, succeeded him in the latter situation ; Sir Thomas, another brother, was general of the Ordnance to Prince Maurice : he was knighted in 1 644. John Basset, son and heir of Sir Francis, although he had never been in arms himself, was imprisoned, by order of the parliament, for his father's delinquency, as it was termed, and his own disaffection ; he was suffered to compound for his estates, and, in consequence of the losses which he had sustained on account of his loyalty, was obliged to sell St.Michael's Mount to the St.Aubyn family. Francis Basset, the present repre sentative of this ancient family, was created a baronet in 1779 : in 1796, he was advanced to the dignity of the peerage, as Baron de Dunstanville ; and in 1797, was created also Baron Basset of Stratton, with remainder to his only daughter and her heirs-male. The manor of Tehidy is of extensive jurisdiction, enjoys great privileges, and is rich in mines.

There are some good pictures at Tehidy : among the portraits are those of General Massey by Vandyke, and Chief Justice Keylinge and his lady by Lely. On the summit of a steep hill, in this parissi, 697 feet above the level of the sea1, called Carn-Bre, supposed by Dr. Borlase and other writers to abound with various druidical remains', are the remains of a castle, which is mentioned by William of Worcester in his Itinerary, written in the reign of Edward IV., as then the property of Sir John Basset, Knt. Dr. Borlase says, that there was a park at Carn-Bre. The manor of Nancekute or Nancekeage, now the property of Lord de Dun stanville, was purchased by his ancestor of the Rolle family, about the year 1 756. Nance was the seat of a branch of the family of Trengove or Ti engoff of VVar leggon, which, on settling here, took the name of the barton. They became extinct about the year 1720 ; the barton, which is now the property of Lord de Dunstanville, has only a farm-house upon it. Ralph Ressiymer, who died in the year 1465, was seised of the manors of Treloweth-Redruth, and Treloweth-Heyle. The barton of Treloweth, in this parissi, which is not possessed of any manerial rights, belongs to the Hon. Mrs.Agar, as representative of the family of Robartes. The manor of Tressiillard, in this parissi, is the property of Lord Grenville, in right of his lady, as heiress of the late Lord Camelford : it is probable that it was part of the Mohun estates pur chased by her ancestor Governor Pitt. In the church and church-yard are several monuments of the family of Basset. Lord de Dunstanville is patron of the rectory. There were formerly chapels in this parissi dedicated to St.John the Evangelist, St.John the Baptist, and St.Constantineu. A new chapel has been lately erected at Trevenson near Pool, at the expence of Lord de Dunstanville, and endowed by His Lordssiip with some lands adjoining, now let at 42/. per annum : it was opened in 1809.

St. John's, in the deanery and in the south division of the hundred of East, lies about three miles and a half from Plymouth-dock, which is the post-office town. The principal villages in this parissi are the church-town and Tregenhawke. The manor or reputed manor of Tregenhawke, in this parissi, and Rame (held under the manor of East-Antony), was formerly in the Eliot family, by whom, in 1635, it was alienated to Richard Treville, merchant; from the Trevilles it passed, by coheiresses, to the families of Cross and Trelawney. A moiety of this estate was purchased in 1791 by the late William Graves, Esq., uncle of the Right Hon. Lord Graves, by whom it is now possessed, and who has since pur chased the remainder. Lord Graves has also the manor or reputed manor of Withnoe (now called Winnow), which was purchased by his uncle of Francis Wills, Esq., of Wivelscombe. In the parissi-church are some monuments of the family of Fissier. The rectory is in the patronage of the Right Hon. R.P.

The manor of Trebicen, now Trebigh, which had been purchased by Abbot Suetricius for the abbey of Tavistock, was taken awray from that monastery by Robert, Earl of Moreton and Cornwall, as we are informed by the Survey of Domesday. It was given either by King Stephen or Henry II. to the Knights Hospitallers, who had a preceptory here, of which there are now no traces. Henry de Pomeroy, and Reginald Marssi, are said to have been great benefactors to this preceptory, which, after its first dissolution, was restored by Queen Mary in 1557.

The manor of Denerdake, Dunerdake, or Dinnerdake, which had been forfeited by Sir William Vaux, was granted by King Edward IV. to Avery CornburglT. It was afterwards in the family of Tregian, and having been seized by Queen Elizabeth, (when its owner, Francis Tregian, was convicted of harbouring a Popissi priest,) was granted to the Hunsdon family, re-purchased by the Tregians, but soon afterwards again alienated.

Bichetone, in this parissi, which gave name to an ancient family, was afterwards a seat of the Wreys, by whom it was sold, in the seventeenth century, to the Eliots. Daniel Eliot, Esq. began building a new mansion on this estate, but it was never completed, and there is now only a farm-house on it : the estate belongs to the Hon. William Eliot. The barton of Appledore, formerly called Appledorlord, and esteemed a manor, belonged to the Trevenor family, which became extinct in the male line in 1523/: it is now a farm-house, the property of Mr. William Nottle, who purchased it of the Glanvilles of Catchfrench.

Sir Joseph was made governor of the castle by the King : after the revolution he was displaced, being succeeded by Hugh Boscawen, Esq., afterwards Lord Falmouth, who was removed in 1734, Major De Roen being then appointed by King George II. The present governor is General Nugent. The castle is not now fortified, but there is an open battery below, near the block- house. The castle estate is in moieties between the Marquis of Buckingham and James Busier, Esq., M.P. A chapel has been lately erected at St.Mawes, at the expence of the late Marquis of Buckingham ; it was finissied in July 1812: but has not been endowed or consecrated. St.Just, in the deanery and in the west division of the hundred of Penwith, is situated eleven miles nearly south-west of St.Ives, and about seven nearly west of Penzance, which is the post-office town. The principal villages in this parissi, exclusively of the church-town, which is called St.Just, otherwise La Frowda, are Betallack, Bosavern, Brea, Kelinack, Pendeen, and Trewellard. The manor of Kelinack, or Killenick, belonged successively to the families of Longeland\" and Hankford ; from the latter, it passed by a female heir to the Over the front-door, which faces the entrance of the harbour, \" Semper vivat Aia Regis Henrici Octavi qui an\u00b0. 34 fui regni hoc fieri fecit.\" On the outside of the wall of the half-moon battery, in front of the castle, \" Honora Henricum Octavum Angli\u00e6, Franci\u00e6 et Hiberni\u00e6 Regem excellentiflimum.\" Memorials, p. 203. * John Longeland died 3 Ric.

Betallack, some time a seat of the Usticks, is now a farm-house, belonging to Lord Falmouth. Bosvargus, the seat of a family of that name, was inherited by the learned Jonathan Toup, rector of St. Martin's, near Looe: it is now a farm house, belonging to Mr.Nicholls of Looe, who married one of his nieces. Brea, supposed to have been the original seat of the family of Brea or Bray, is now a farm-house, belonging to William Ellis, Esq. The great tythes of St.Just, which were appropriated to Glaseney-College, are now vested in John Borlase, Esq. The vicarage is in the gift of the crown. In this parissi are the ruins of Chapel-Carne-Bre, built on a singularly large cairn. On the plain above Cape-Cornwall, which is in this parissi, are the remains of an ancient chapel called Parken chapel, forty-five feet by twelve, with a chapel-yard'\u00bbd. Dr.Borlase speaks of a third at Breh, which had been converted into a dwelling house. St.Kaine or St.Kean, in the hundred and deanery of West, (called in ancient records Lametton,) lies about two miles and a half south of Lissieard, which is the post-office town, and about six miles north of Looe. The manor of Lametton, as parcel of the possessions of Sir Robert Tresilian, Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench, was granted after his attainder, by King Richard II. to his son-in-law John Hawleye of Dartmouth, whose daughter (an heiress) brought it to the Coplestonesf. The barton was the chief scat of that ancient family in Cornwall. In the reign of James I. it belonged to the Harris's5 of Mount-Radford, in Devonssiire, from whom it passed soon afterwards, by marriage, to the Rassileighs : it is now the property of William Rassileigh, Esq., M.P.

The manor of Landegy (which was the ancient name of the parissi) belonged at an early period to the Archdeknesk; from whom it passed by female heirs to the Courtneys and Carews. In the reign of Queen Elizabeth, the rnanors of Landegy and Lanner were amongst those forfeited by Francis Tregian, and which were granted to Cary Lord Hunsdon, and afterwards re-purchased by Francis Tregian the younger. Before the year 1620, they had been sold by Charles Tregian, brother and heir of Francis Tregian the younger, to William Coryton1, Esq., ancestor of John Tillie Coryton, Esq., the present proprietor. The manor of Albalanda or Blanchland, partly in this parissi and partly in Kenwyn, passed in marriage with Johanna, daughter and heir of Otho de Alba landa, (whose ancestors had long possessed it,) to John Boscawen\"1, Esq., of Tre gothnan ; from whom it has passed, by lineal descent, to the present noble owner Lord Viscount Falmouth. Tonkin says, that the first copper-mines which were worked with success in Cornwall, were those on this estate.

Kenwyn, although a separate parissi, is consolidated as a benefice with Kea, as before described. The Exeter registers mention a chapel dedicated to St.George in this parissi. The manor of Tregavethan, which is nearly surrounded by the parissi of Kenwyn, is deemed extra-parochial, has its separate officers, and maintains its own poor ; it is described in Martyn's Alphabetical List as in the parissi of Kea, and, indeed, the inhabitants pay their taxes to the assessor of that parissi. This manor belonged to the Tregodicks, from whom it passed, by successive sales, to the families of Crosse, Bawden, Vincent, and Knight : it is now the property of the Marquis of Buckingham, whose maternal grandfather (Earl Nugent) became possessed of this and several other estates, in consequence of his marriage with the widow of John Knight, Esq., of Gosfield-Hall, in Essex. The barton, which had been retained by the Tregodicks, passed by a female heir to the Laughernes. Captain Digory Laug herne, who commanded a troop of horse for the King, having been ruined in his fortunes by the civil war, sold this barton in the reign of Charles II. to the Vincents. John Laugherne, brother of Digory, who was a lieutenant of horse in the King's army, is said to have been more than seven feet six inches high, and of remark able strength. The barton-house, which was the seat of the Tregodicks and Laughernes, has been pulled down.

The barton of Trebarvath, to which a manor was formerly attached, belonged at an early period to the family of Archdekne r : it is now a farm-house, the property and residence of Mr. Richard Lory. There was in former times a manor of Rosewick, to which the church of Landewednack was an appendage. This manor, in the reign of Edward I., was conveyed by John de Ripariis to William de St. Margaret : it was afterwards in the Carminows, from whom it passed to the Ressiymers. The site of this manor was, most probably, at Rofwick in this parissi, the lands in which still pay a high rent to a manor called Tretheves, Rofwick, and Lucies, in the neighbouring parissies of Ruan- Minor and Grade, belonging to Sir Christopher Hawkins, Bart.

The advowson of the vicarage is vested in Mr. James Pascoe. There were formerly chapels at Tregowris, Traboc, Gwinter, Chynals, Trelease, and Nambol : the walls of some of these were standing within the memory of man. The registers of the See of Exeter record also a chapel at Lesteader7. In a petition to parliament in the reign of Edward IV., mention is made of John Vyvyan, Esq., of Trelowarren, and his wife Honor, (the heiress of Ferrers), going on a pilgrimage to the chapel of St.James, at Tregowris. There is an endowed charity-school at St.Keverne, for reading, writing, and arithmetic, the master of which has a salary of 15I. per annum ; and six reading schools, with small salaries. The income which forms the endowment of these schools arises from the rent of three small parcels of land, and the interest of 150I. stock, amounting together to 26I. 10s. per annum. Part of the land was given by Sampson Sandys, Esq., in 1698 ; the remainder was purchased with a moiety of 200L, given to the schools by John Hossien, Esq., of Tregowris, in 1770.

The manor of Lanow, in old records called Lanow-Seynt and Landoho, (which was the ancient name of the parissi,) was given, with the church, by King Edgar to the priory of Plympton, for the support of two canons, the keeping up of alms-giving, and the entertainment of pilgrims3. It was, not long afterwards, resumed by the crown, the priory having been dissolved, and was given by King Henry I. to William Warlewast, Bissiop of Exeter, by whom the priory was re-founded, and again endowed with this manor.

Lord Grenville has also the barton of Polterworgie, now a farm-house, which was a seat of the Bevillesd; the manor of Tregeare, on which was a seat of thePenkevills* ; and those of Allett and Ammell. The latter belonged to the Mohunsf, artd passed by the fame title as Boconnoc. The manor of St.Kew has been long in the Molefworth family, and now belongs to Sir A. O. Molefworth, Bart. The manor of Penpons or Penpont, now dismembered, belonged anciently to a family of that name, whose heiress brought it to the Arundells of Tolverne. The barton is, by a late purchase, the property of Mr. Richard Grose, whose family had long been tenants of the estate. The manor of Treharrick belonged to a family of that name, whose heiress brought it to the Cavalls in the reign of Henry VII. About the year 1700, Thomas Vivian, Esq., of Trenowth, to whom k had passed by inheritance from a coheiress of Cavall, dismembered the manor, and sold the barton to Mr. John Petar. It is now the property of Mr. Abraham Hambly, who has lately built a new house on the estate for his own residence. Bokelly8, the ancient seat of the Carnsews, which Leland calls \" a praty house, with fair ground and praty wood about it,\" was sold by that family, about the time of the civil' war to the Tregagles : it is now a farm-house, the property of Sir A.

There was formerly a market at this place, which in the year 1301 was proved to have been held by prescription, as appears by the quo warranto roll of that year. There are now three fairs, on Holy Thursday, the third Thurs day after, and August 28 : the first and last are considerable cattle-fairs. The manor of Kilkhampton is supposed to have belonged to the Grenville family, from nearly the time of the Conquest ; Dugdale says, that they were seated here in the reign of William Rufus. Richard de Grenville, who came over with William the Conqueror, is said, in the pedigrees of the family, to have been a younger brother of Robert Fitzhaman, Earl of Carbill, Lord of Thurigny and Granville, in France and Normandy ; and to have been lineally descended from Rollo, Duke of Normandy. It is on record, that Richard de Grenville held certain knight's fees at Bideford in Devonssiire, in the reign of Henry II. We have not found any record of the Grenvilles' possessions at Kilkhampton, of an earlier date than the quo warranto roll before-mentioned ; but it appears that it had at that time been long in the family : they continued to reside at Stowe, in this parissi, for many generations, and frequently served the office of ssieriff for the county. William Grenville or Grenfield, (as the name was at that early period generally written), son of Sir Theobald, became Archbissiop of York, and distinguissied himself as an able statesman ; he died in 1315. Sir Richard Gren ville, son of Roger, (who was himself a captain in the navy, and lost his life, as Carew tells us, in the unfortunate Mary Rose,) was a celebrated military and naval Dr. Borlase's MS. Collections. Y 2 com-"], [542, "CORNWALL. 164 commander in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. He first distinguissied himself in the wars under the Emperor Maximilian against the Turks, for which his name is recorded by several foreign writers. In the year 1591, being then Vice-Admirai of England, he was sent in the Revenge, with a squadron of seven ssiips, to inter cept the Spanissi galleons; when falling in with the enemy's fleet, consisting of fifty-two sail, near the Tercera islands, he repulsed them fifteen times in a con tinued fight, till his powder was all spent : his ssiip, which funk before it arrived in port, was reduced to a hulk, and himself covered with wounds, of which he died two days afterwards, on board the vessel of the Spanissi commander'. Sir Richard's grandson was the brave and loyal Sir Beville Grenville. This distin guissied officer was one of King Charles's generals in the West, and ssiared the glories of the successful campaign in Cornwall in the autumn of 1642 ; in the summer of the following year he lost his life at the battle of Lansdowne, near Bath. Sir Richard Grenville, who had been created a baronet in 1631, was, after his brother's death, made General of all the King's forces in the West. He was an active and zealous officer, and so particularly obnoxious to the parlia mentary party, that he was perpetually the subject of abuse to their journalists, who seldom spoke of him but by the appellation of Skellum Grenville. During the dissensions between the civil power and the military in 1 645, Sir Richard Grenville was superseded and imprisoned by the advice of Sir Edward Hyde, afterwards Earl of Clarendon. That noble author gives a very unamiable character of Sir Richard, who is represented as having been in the highest degree oppressive, tyrannical, and unprincipled ; but other writers attribute much of this to the personal enmity which subsisted between them. Sir Richard Grenville died, in reduced circumstances, at Ghent, in the year 1658 ; leaving no male issue, the title became extinct. Sir John Grenville, son of the brave Sir Beville, succeeded to the Kilkhampton estates : at a very early age he had a command in his father's regiment, and was left for dead in the field at Tewkssiury. He was appointed Governor of the Scilly Islands when they revolted from the parliament, and was one of the chief instruments in effecting the restoration of King Charles II. He gave the living of Kilkhampton to Nicholas Monk, and employed him to in fluence his brother (the general) in favour of the exiled monarch ; having suc ceeded in his negociations, he had the satisfaction of being the bearer of the King's letters to General Monk, and to the parliament.

On the death of his grandson, under age, in 171 1, these titles became extinct, and the Kilkhampton estate passed to his aunt and coheiress Grace Grenville, who married George Lord Carteret, and was afterwards (being then a widow) created by King George I. Countess of Gran ville, with remainder to her son John, who inherited that title and the Kilkhamp ton estate. On the death of Robert, the second Earl of Granville, in 1776, that title became extinct, and the Kilkhampton estate passed, under his will, to his nephew Henry Frederick Thynne, second son of Lord Viscount Weymouth, who had married his sister Louisa. Mr. Thynne was created Lord Carteret in 1784, and is the present possessor of Kilkhampton, the remainder of which, as well as the title of Carteret, is vested in Lord George Thynne, second son of the Marquis of Bath. John Grenville, Earl of Bath, in the reign of Charles II., built a magnificent mansion at Stowe, in this parissi, of which scarcely a vestige remains.

That writer speaks of it as by far the noblest house in the west of England, and fays, that the kitchen offices, fitted up for a dwelling-house, made no contemptible figure*. It is a singular circum stance, that the cedar wainscot, which had been bought out of a Spanissi prize, and used by the Earl of Bath for fitting up the chapel in this mansion, was pur chased by Lord Cobham at the time of its demolition, (the house being then sold piecemeal,) and applied to the fame purpose at Stowe, the magnificent seat of the noble family of Grenville in Buckinghamssiire, where it still remains.

The tradition is yet current, that there was a considerable town near the church, and that the trade of the Hayle was on the Lalant side, till the sands drove the inhabitants farther to the south. So lately as the year 1780, the sand was almost as high as the church-yard wall, and its boundaries scarcely discernible ; but by planting russies, the sands have become stationary, and the fence is now visible.

There are two cattle-fairs in this parissi, July 19, and August 24. The manor of Lanrake, which is called by Tonkin the very best in the county, belonged at an early period to the family of St. Margaret\"; in the seventeenth century it was the property of Serjeant Maynard, whose heiress brought it to the Hobarts : the late Earl of Buckinghamssiire gave it in marriage with his daughter to Lord Mount-Edgcumbe. The manor-house is occupied by a farmer. Wotton, in this parissi, the seat of an ancient family of that name, whose heiress brought it to a branch of the Courtenays, and afterwards of the family of Rowse, is now the property of Francis Dogherty, Esq., in right of his wife, who was heiress of the family of Blake.

Plymouth-dock, which by water is about five miles from Landulph, is the post-office town. The only village of any consequence in this parissi, except the church-town, is Car-Green. The manor of Landulph was at an early period in the baronial family of D'Alneto, Dawney, or Danny, from whom it passed by a female heir to the Courtenays : after the first attainder in the Courtenay family, it was in the temporary possession (by successive grants from the crown) of Ralph Assiton and Thomas Graysonb: on the attainder of Henry Marquis of Exeter, it was finally alienated from the Courtenay family, and annexed with other estates to the duchy of Cornwall, in lieu of the honor of Wallingford.

The manor of Lanhydrock, which extends into the borough of Bodmin, and the parissi of Cardinham, belonged at an early period to the Glynns, one of which family brought it as a marriage portion to the Lytteltons : the heiress of Lyttelton married Trenance ; in 1620, Lyttelton Trenance, Esq. sold it to Sir Richard Robartes, who was created a baronet and afterwards a baron, by King James I. His son John (Lord Robartes) attached himself to the parliament during the civil war, and was one of the generals in the west : his estates were in consequence seized by the King, and were granted to Sir Richard Grenville. Lanhydrock-house, which had been garrisoned by its owner, was taken by Sir Richard Grenville, who was at that time one of the King's generals in the west, not long before the surrender of Essex's army in 1644 s.

The Kendalls of Pelyn are de scended from Walter, third son of John Kendall of Treworgy, who married a daughter and coheir of Robert Holland, an illegitimate son of the Earl of Exeter. The manor of Bodardle or Bodarle belonged, in the reign of Richard I., to Robert de Cardinham ; and it is most probable, that it is was before in the Fitz-Williams by the match with whose heiress he acquired his large possessions in this county: in 1259 it was conveyed by Isolda de Cardinham, who had been the wife of Thomas Tracy, to Oliver de Dinaunt, in whose posterity it continued for several generations ; it was afterwards in the family of Robartes, Earls of Radnor, and is now the property of their representative, the Honourable Mrs. Agar. The manor of Polchoath, a small portion of which lies in Lanlivery, and the other part in Lostwithiel and St. Winnow, is now also the property of Mrs. Agar, as representative of the Robartes family.

Polperro, called by Leland Poulpirrhe, and described as \" a little fischar town with a peere,\" has a small market on Friday, and a holiday fair on the 10th of July (St. Peter's day, old style). A mock mayor is elected on the occasion by a mock council of aldermen, and the fair generally continues the greater part of a week with much revelry. The situation of this little town, the other part of which is in the parissi of Tallahd, is singularly romantic ; the houses being situated on the sides of two steep rocky hills, which form a very narrow valley ; a small river, which divides the two parissies, runs between. There is a harbour at Polperro for vessels of 150 tons burden ; the trade is chiefly for coals and lime-stone : grain is occasionally exported. There is a pilchard-fissiery at Polperro, and an extensive hook and line fissiery, which supplies Bath, Plymouth, &c. with large quantities of fine whiting, pipers, dories, plaice, turbot, &c. There was formerly a chapel at Polperro dedicated to St.Peter % of which there are some remains called the chapel-house, on the brow of the western hill, above the town.

In the month of November, the fame year, Launceston was fortified by Sir Richard Grenville, who, being at variance with Lord Goring (another of the King's generals), caused proclamation to be made in all the churches of Cornwall, that if any of Lord Goring's forces ssiould come into Cornwall, the bells ssiould ring, and the people rise to drive them out \\ Not long after this, Sir Richard Grenville, having refused to take the chief command of the infantry under Lord Hopton as generalissimo, was - In records of the reigns of King John and Henry III., it is called Launfatton, and Lan zaneston. e In a MS. extent of the duchy of Cornwall (dated 17 Jac. 1.), in the possession of Sir John St.Aubvn, Bart., is an account of the numerous manors and lands in Cornwall and Devonshire, held under Launceston castle, chiefly by the service of performing garrison-duty in it in time of war. Blount, in his \" Ancient Tenures,\" has printed from the Pleas of the Crown some of these services. One estate was held by the service of personal attendance in the castle of Launceston for forty days in time of war with an iron skull-cap and a Danish hatchet or pole-ax. It appears by a survey of the duchy of Cornwall, 11 Edw. III., (in the Treasurer's Remembrancer's Office,) that the great land holders, who held several fees of the honor of Launceston, were bound in time of war to defend as many kernels of the castle, each with one man, as they held fees. f See an account of the succession of the Earls of Cornwall, p. lxxii. i Polwhtle's History of Cornwall, II. 89. h Dugdale's Baronage, I. 693.

In the month of March 1646, the garrison of Launceston was surrendered by Colonel Basset to Sir Thomas Fairfax.q During the interregnum, the castle and parkr being put up to sale, by authority of the then ruling powers, were purchased by Robert Bennet, Esq.5 After the Restoration, Sir Hugh Pyper, for his good services, had a grant of the castle as lessee, and was made constable and keeper of the goal. It continued in the family till the death of Hugh Pyper (his grandson), in 1754. The Duke of Northumberland is now lessee of the castle ; Edward Coode, Esq. of the park. An official survey, taken in the year 1337% speaks of Launceston castle as being then in a very ruinous state. It describes a hall with two chambers ; a smaller hall, called the Earl's chamber, with another chamber and a small chapel adjoining ; a larger chapel ; another small hall ; a few other rooms ; and two prisons, one of which was called larder. There were then two rooms in the tower, on the keep, much out of repair. Carew, whose Survey was publissied in 1 602, speaking of Launceston castle, says ; \" The base court compriseth a decayed chappell, a large hall for holding the ssiire assizes, the constable's dwelling-house, and the common gayle.\" The survey of 1650\" describes the castle as being then much out of repair, the hall and chapel level with the ground ; only one old tower (then a prison) in reasonable repair : the soldiers had carried away the lead that covered it. No other part of the castle then remained but the gate house, inhabited by the constable. George Fox, the celebrated quaker, who was imprisoned in this castle for several months, describes in his journal a most filthy dungeon, in which he was some time confined, called Dooms dale. There are now scarcely any remains of Launceston castle, except the keep, which Leland describes as \" the strongest, though not the biggest he had ever seen in any aunciente worke in Englande :\" this has been particularly described under the head of Ancient Castles. The town in Henry the Eighth's time was walled, and had three gates and a postern. \" Dunevet, otherwise Lawnston, is a walled towne,\" fays Leland, \" ny yn cumpas a myle, but now ruinus.

The town of Dunhevet (now Launceston) was made a free borough in the reign of Henry III., by Richard Earl of Cornwall, who granted various privileges to the burgesses, and a piece of ground to build their guildhall upon, to be held of him and his heirs, by the annual render of a pound of pepper\". The town was incorporated by Queen Mary in the year 1555, the corporation consisting of a mayor, eight aldermen, and a recorder, This borough has sent members to par liament ever since the reign of Edward I. : the right of election is vested in the corporation and free burgesses, the number of voters being only sixteen. John Anstis, Esq., Garter-King- of Arms, (who made large collections from public records, relating to the county of Cornwall, and is said to have compiled a history of this town, which he left behind him in manuscript,) was one of its representa tives in parliament in the reign of Queen Anne. The market at Launceston is held by prescription. In the reign of King John the burgesses gave five marks for the King's licence to change their market-day from Sunday to Thursday\". There are now two market-days, Thursday and Saturday ; the former is the principal market, and well supplied with corn and provisions of all sorts ; the other is only for butchers'-meat. There are fairs on Whit- Monday, July 5, November 8, and December 1 1, for bullocks ; and on the first Thursday in March, and the third Thursday in April, for cattle of all sorts, free of toll. There is an extensive manufactory of serges at Launceston. In the thirty-second year of Henry VIII 's reign, an act of parliament passed for the encouragement of re-building certain decayed towns, of which Launceston was one. Norden observes, that though this statute took little effect, the town was \" much repayred in buyldings, and increased in wealth of late yeares.\" The number of houses in the town of Launceston, in 1801, was 226, that of inhabitants 1483; in 1811 the number of houses 278, that of inhabitants 1758. These numbers do not include the population of St.Stephen or St. Thomas.

This continued till the reign of James I., when the privilege of sanctuary was wholly abolissied. The assizes for the county were formerly held wholly at Launceston, as hath been already particularly stated\"; they have for more than half a century been held alternately at Launceston and Bodmin. It seems by a passage in Leland y, that the quarter-sessions also were formerly held at Launceston. The county-gaol, before-mentioned, was repaired and improved2, when the new gaol was built at Bodmin ; and is made use of by the county at the assizes. The barton of Hurdon, near this town, formerly esteemed a manor3 was the property of John Carpenter, Esq.; now, by purchase, of Edward Coode, Esq. The mansion is occupied as a farm-house. In the parissi-church of Launceston, (dedicated to St. Mary Magdalen,) the architecture of which has been already spoken of, are memorials for the families of Lawrence, Pyper, and Vyvyan of Tresmarrow, a younger branch of the Trelo warren family. In the epitaph of Sir Hugh Pyper, Knt., he is described as \" lieutenant-governor of the royal citadel and island of Plymouth, captain of the castle of Exeter, constable of the castle of Launceston, alderman and repre sentative in parliament for the borough of Dunheved, &c. &c. He served in the civil wars as an ensign, lieutenant, and captain, under Sir Richard and Sir Beville Grenville, at the siege of Plymouth, the battles of Stratton and Lans downe, where he was wounded in the neckb and thigh, and ssiot through the ssioulder : his estates were sequestered by -the rump parliament for his loyalty to his master and injured sovereign King Charles I.

In the Exeter Registers is recorded an indulgence for contributing to the support of a company of minstrells of St.Mary Magdalen, in Launceston. It appears by the Launceston charters, that there were chapels also at this place, dedicated to St.John and St.James : of these there are no traces. The impropriate tithes, which belonged to the priory of Launceston, are vested in the Duke of Northumberland. The mayor and corporation are patrons of the curacy. There is a grammar-school at Launceston, founded by Queen Elizabeth, and endowed with 1 61. per annum, payable out of the duchy of Cornwall ; an addi tional endowment of iol. per annum was given, in the year 1685, by George Baron, Esq., whose descendants have the right of nominating ten boys, to be educated free of expence. There was formerly a hospital for lepers, near Poulston-bridge, dedicated to St. Leonard. The income, arising from certain fields which had belonged to this hospital, (about 25I. per annum,) is now vested in the corporation, and applied to charitable uses. Adjoining to the town of Launceston, of which they appear to form a part, are the parissies of St.Stephen and St. Thomas. St. Stephen's is in the Survey of Domesday, called Lanstavetone. The church of St. Stephen was collegiate before the Conquest, and filled with secular canons. King Henry I. gave this college to the church of Exeter. Hals fays, that Reginald, Earl of Cornwall, was a great benefactor to the college of St.Stephen, and that he used all his influence with King Stephen to get the bissiop's see again removed to Cornwall, and that St.Ste phen's ssiould be the cathedral church ; but this was successfully opposed by William Warlewast, Bissiop of Exeter, who being then resident at Lawhitton, on his first triennial visitation, suppressed the college of secular canons, and in its stead founded a priory of Austin monks in the parissi of St. Thomas, about half way between St. Stephen's and the castle. This priory flourished till the general dissolution of religious houses, when its revenues were estimated at 354L nfd. clear yearly value. Not many years ago there were considerable remains of the conventual buildings, which have since been wholly destroyed. Leland describes it as in the west part of the suburb, \" under the hill, by a fair wood side ; an arrow ssiot northward from the castle.\" It is probable, that the Saxon gateway of the White Hart Inn had been part of Bishop Warlewast's building, removed on occasion of the demolition of the priory. When Leland visited Cornwall, Sir Gawen c He was made Bistiup in 1520. Carew IO"], [572, "CORNWALL. 192 Carew had the custody of the priory. The immediate site is now the property of Hill. It seems probable that it was the town of St. Stephens or Newport, to the burgesses of which various privileges were granted by the name of Launceston, there being contemporary charters to the burgesses of Dunheved, now Launceston. Newport has sent members to parliament ever since the reign of Edward VI. The right of election is vested in freeholders, whether resident or not, and in the inhabitants paying scot and lot : the number of electors is about thirty-five. Two officers, called vianders, are the returning officers. The manor of Newport or Launceston, which belonged to the Morice family, is now the property of the Duke of Northumberland. There are three fairs in the parissi of St.Stephen, May 12, July 31, and September 25, for horned cattle and sheep. The manor and barton of Newhouse, in the parissi of St. Stephen, formerly a seat of the Langfords f, has been lately advertised for sale by Sir A. O. Molefworth, Bart., together with the great and small tithes of St. Stephen's. The parissi-church of St.Stephen was rebuilt at the expence of Charles Cheney, Lord Viscount Newhaven, M.P. for Newport, as appears by an inscription at the entrance. The nomination of the minister is vested in the inhabitants. Mr. John Horwell, who died about the year 1717, founded a school for the maintenance and education of twelve poor boys ; the master of which has a salary of 1 5I. per annum ; but we have not been able to obtain any further particulars respecting the endowment. The Duke of Northumberland is the principal feoffee. The barton of Carnedon, in the parissi of St. Thomas, was purchased in 1690, of John Blighe, Esq., by John Cloberry, Esq. It is now the property of Thomas Bewes, Esq., whose ancestor purchased it, in 17 15, of Nicholas Clark, to whom it had been sold in 1 700 by the trustees, for paying Mr. Cloberry's debts. Carnedon is now a farm-house. The barton of Tredidon belonged anciently to a family of that name, from whom it passed, by successive female heirs, to the families of Windsor and Jolliffe. The latter possessed it for several generations : it was afterwards many years in the family of French ; and is now the property and seat of George Francis Collins Browne, Esq., who purchased it, in 1805, of the Rev. Simon Webber. The church of St. Thomas was appropriated to the priory of Launceston: the estates in this parissi are now tithe-free. The parissiioners nominate the perpetual curate. In this parissi is an ancient fortification called Kestle or Castle wood. f Norden.

There was formerly a market at Lawhitton, on Wednesday, granted in 1312 to the Bissiop of Exeter, together with a fair at the festival of St.Michael5; both long ago discontinued. The principal villages in this parissi, exclusively of the church-town, are Carfantec, Luccombe, and Tregeda. The manor of Lawhitton was given by Edward the Elder, about the year 905, to the Bissiops of Crediton : on the union of the sees, it became annexed, as it has ever since continued, to the bissiopric of Exeter, under which it is held on a lease for lives. The lease was for many generations in the family of Bennet, and when the crown lands were put up to sale during the usurpation, the lessee, who was a colonel in the parliamentary army, purchased the fee. At the Restoration the Bennets reverted to their former situation, as lessees. In Bissiop Lavington's time, the lease having expired through neglect, the Bissiop put in the life of his only daughter, afterwards married to the late Rev. Nutcombe Nutcombe, chan cellor of the church of Exeter. The Bennet family had a seat in this parissi, called Hexworthy, with a considerable freehold estate : this is now the property and residence of Edmund Prideaux, Esq., a relation of the Bennets by marriage*. There is another manor in this parissi, belonging to the see of Exeter, called Sheers-Barton. According to the custom of this manor, lands are granted for three lives without widowhood ; in the manor of Lawhitton, the leases are with widowhood. In the parissi-church is a memorial for Richard Bennet, \" Counsellor at Law,\" 16 19, and a monument of artificial stone in memory of Richard Coffin, the last heir-male of the Bennet family, who died in 1786 : he took the name of Coffin from his mother, who was heiress of the Coffins of Portlege.

The principal villages in this parissi are Hicks's mill, Pollyfont, Trenhorne, and Trevadlock. The manor of Trelassie belonged to the Uptons, whose coheiresses brought it to two brothers of the Lower family, in the reign of Henry VIII. Thomas Lower, Esq., who died in 1703, sold the barton and a moiety of the manor to John Addis, Esq., whose son, in 1720, purchased the other moiety of William Plowden and others. William Addis, Esq., in 1741, bequeathed the whole to Nicholas Swete Archer, great uncle of Samuel Archer, Esq., the present proprietor.

Besides the church-town, there are three small villages in the parissi, Rilla-mill, Rillaton, and Upton. The manor of Rillaton, and that of Carnadon-Prior, in which the church stands, said to have been antiently called the manor of Linkinhorne, are parcel of the duchy of Cornwall. The former was annexed to it in the reign of Edward III., together with the Bedelry of East-Wivelssiire. Carnadon had belonged to the priory of Launceston, and was one of the manors annexed to the duchy by King Henry VIII., in lieu of the honor of Wallingford. On Carnadon, commonly called Carraton downs, is some of the highest ground in the county : it was on these downs that King Charles I. drew up his forces on the 2d of August, 1644, the day after he had entered Cornwall, and here he was joined by Prince Maurice.0 The duchy manors of Stoke-Climfland and Climfland-Prior, extend into this parissi.

We cannot learn who is the present proprietor of this estate ; yet it appears that the late Humphrey Lawrence, Esq. gave a deputation for it in 1792. The manor of Pengelly or Rillaton-Pengelly is the property of F. H. Rodd, Esq., whose father purchased it, in or about the year 1803, of the Rassileigh family. The manor of Padreda, which was the seat of the Lampens, was sold by that family about the year 1680; in 1728 the barton, which before that time appears to have lost its manerial rights, was the property of James Tillie, Esq/; it now belongs to J. Tillie Coryton, Esq., the old mansion being occupied as a farm house. The manor of Trefrize or Trefry's was formerly of considerable importance, and extended over several estates in this parissi, Lewannick, and Northill. It has been supposed that it belonged to the family of Trefry ; if so, it was most probably at a remote period, and a distinct family from that of Treffry in Lanhidrock'. We can find no records which describe it as the property of Trefry : the last sole pos sessor was Sir HenryTrecarrell, of Trecarrell in Lezant; it afterwards became divided among his three coheirs, one of whom was Christopher Harris, of Trecarrell ; but his ssiare did not continue long in the Harris family. In 1620 it was divided be tween Sir Francis Vyvyan, Thomas Kendall, Esq., and John Ley alias Kempthorne'; in 1728 between Sir Francis Vyvyan, Bart., Thomas Waddon, Esq., and Captain Pyper\". The heiress of Pyper married Vyvyan, and the whole manor became vestea in the Vyvyan family. It is now the property of the Rev. S. Carew Vyvyan, Bart.

Liskeard, in the hundred and deanery of West, is an ancient borough and market-town, situated about 225 miles from London, and i6| from Plymouth- Dock. Lissieard was made a free borough in 1 240, by Richard Earl of Cornwall and King of the Romans, who bestowed on the burgesses the fame privileges which he had already granted to those of Launceston and Helston. His son Edmund, in 1275, granted them the fee of the borough, with the profits arising from the markets, fairs, &c, subject to a rent of 1 81. per annum, which rent King Wil liam III. granted to Lord Somers ; it is now paid to Lord Eliot, who purchased it of the late Lord Somers. The date of the original charter of incorporation is not known. Queen Eliza beth's charter of 1580 confirms the right of the mayor and burgessesy, and provides that the corporation shall consist of nine burgesses, to be called the common-council of the said borough, whereof one for the time being shall be yearly chosen mayor, and have power to choose a steward and recorder ; and that the mayor and recorder be justices of the peace, within the borough, &c. This borough has sent members lo parliament ever since the reign of Edward I. The right of election is vested in the corporation and freemen, the number of electors being now about 45. In the list of representatives for this borough, we find the name of Lord Chief Justice Coke. Leland speaks of the market at Lissieard as \" the best in Cornwall, savyng Bodmyn.\" In his time the market was held on Monday, and there are still three great markets on that day ; Shrove-Monday, the Monday after Palm-Sunday, and the Monday after St.Nicholas's day. Browne Willis fays, that in his time the market at Lissieard much exceeded that of Bodmin ; it was then held, as it now is, on Saturday7. It is most amply supplied with all sorts of provisions; a great portion of which is purchased for the supply of the market at Plymouth-Dock. There *are three large cattle fairs; Holy-Thursday, the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, and St.Matthew's-day, O.S. (October 2.) Lissieard is one of the four towns v In the course of the proceedings on the election case in 1803, when the rights of the corpora tion were confirmed, it appeared from records, that there was a mayor in the reign of Richard II. 1 Queen Elizabeth's charter granted two markets, to be held on Monday and Saturday ; and two fairs, to be held at the festivals of the Ascension and St. Matthew. for"], [580, "CORNWALL. 200 for the coinage of tin ; but there has been no coinage held there of late years. Browne Willis speaks of Lissieard as the largest town in Cornwall, containing, as he was informed, a thousand houses. He must have been much misinformed', as the population appears, by the parissi-register, to have been considerably increased within the last century. In 1801, there were in the town of Lissieard 323 houses, and 1860 inhabitants; in 18 11, 364 houses, and 1975 inhabitants, according to the returns made to parliament at those periods. In the town of Lissieard was a nunnery of poor Clares, founded and endowed by Richard Earl of Cornwall and King of the Romans, of which we have not been able to procure any further account. A great part of the conventual buildings, known by the name of the Great Place, still remains, converted into dwelling-houses : the chapel is now a bake-house. The principal villages in this parissi are, Dabwalls, about two miles and a half to the west ; Lamellin, a mile to the south-west ; Trevelmond, about four miles westward ; and Treweedland, about four miles to the south-east of the town. The parissi has five divisions ; the borough, constitution-lands, north, south, and west sides. A battle was fought near Lissieard, on the 19th of January 1643, between Sir Ralph Hopton and the parliamentary forces, in which the latter were defeated. Sir Ralph marched into Lissieard with his army that night*. King Charles, on his entrance into Cornwall in 1 644, halted at Lissieard on the 2d of August, and stayed there till the 7th. b The manor of Lissieard is part of the ancient possessions of the Earls of Corn wall, and was one of those annexed to the duchy by act of parliament, in the reign of Edward III. It is not improbable that the manor-house or castle was built by Richard King of the Romans, who occasionally resided in it. A survey of the year 1337\u00b0 calls it a manor-house, and describes it as having a hall, chapel, and six chambers, all out of repair. William of Worcester, who visited Cornwall in the reign of Edward IV., speaks of Lissieard castle in his Itinerary, as then standing, and one of the palaces of the Duke. Leland, speaking of this castle, fays, it is \" now al in ruine ; fragments and pieces of waulle yet stonde : the site of it is magnificent and looketh over all the towne.\" Carew supposes the castle of Lissieard to have been of no great antiquity. \" Of later times,\" fays he, \" the castle served the Earl of Cornwall for one of his houses ; but now that later is * Unless he has by mi (lake said houses instead of inhabitants. a Heath. b Dugdale.

The site of the castle, with the manor, was sold soon after wards, by order of parliament, to Ralph Margery and Thomas Rawlins. There are no remains of the castle, which stood on the north side of the town. The park described in the survey of 1337 above-quoted, as a new park, in which were then 200 deer, was disparked by King Henry VIII. ; the land which it com prized, (still called the Park,) was leased to Sir Warwick Hele, in 1619 : this estate is now on lease to Lord Eliot. The manor of Lissieard-Colessiill takes its name from the family of Colessisil, who possessed it in the fifteenth century' : Emanuel Langford had five parts out of six in 1620 f: at a later period it was in the Pypers, from whom it passed, by a female heir, to the Vyvyans : it is now the property of Samuel Kekewich, Esq., by bequest from John Trehawke, Esq., who purchased it of the Vyvyans. The manor of Hagland, situated almost wholly within the borough, which is said to have belonged to a chantry-chapel at Launceston, was for many genera tions in the Connocks, and is now vested in Mrs. Arminel Inch and her sister, as devisees of the late Mrs. Connock of Treworgy. The manor of Lamellin or Lamelwyn, which belonged formerly to the Whaleftorowe family, is the property of Lady Morssiead, relict of the late Sir John Morssiead, Bart. The manor of Cartuther, the property of Samuel Kekewich, Esq., extends into this parissi, but lies chiefly in Menheniot. The manor of Fursdon, the site of which is in Lissieard, although it extends into several, and some of them distant parissies, belongs to Robert Lovell Gwatkin, Esq., whose grandfather purchased it of the Trefusis family. The manor of Trevilles, belonging to the Honourable Mrs.Agar, as representative of the Robartes family, extends into this parissi : the site is in St.Pinnock. Tremabe in Lissieard, formerly a seat of the Langfords8, is now a farm-house.

The impropriate rectory was granted, in 1565, to John Harris \\ The greater part of this estate has lately been sold in. parcels by his descendant, John Harris, Esq., of Mount-Radford. Peter Frye Hony, LL.B., the present incumbent, is patron of the vicarage. There was formerly a chapel in Lissieard park, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, to which there was a great resort of pilgrims. It was determined in the reign of Edward II., that the incumbent of the parissi-church had no right to the obla tions made at this chapel '. There was formerly, also, a chapel at- Lamellin m ; and there is the site of a decayed chapel, which has been long in ruins, at Lean-hill, about three miles south-east of Lissieard. There are three meeting-houses in Lissieard, belonging to the independents, quakers, and methodists : the former was originally built, by the Johnson family, for the Pressiyterians. Defoe, in his tour through Great Britain in the early part of the last century, speaks of it as a large new-built meeting-house ; and observes, that there were only three more in Corn wall. * A volume of poems by the Rev. Henry Moore, some time minister of this meeting, was publissied after his death, under the superintendence of Dr. Aikin. There is a grammar-school at Lissieard, supported by the corporation, with a salary of 30k per annum. Dean Prideaux and Walter Moyle were educated at this school n. A charity-school for poor children, in which ten girls are now taught, was founded by the trustees of the charitable donation of the Rev.

It is certain, that in the reign of Richard I., his descendant Robert de Cardinham was lord of this town, it being on record that he gave ten marks to the crown for the privilege of establissiing a market here0. In the early part of Henry III.'s reign, Andrew de Cardinham gave the borough of Lostwithiel to the prior and convent of Tywardreth, subject to suit of court, to him and his heirs : it appears, nevertheless, to have been afterwards in the Earls of Cornwall, and to have been annexed to the duchy by King Edward III., with the manor of Penkneth p. Richard, Earl of Cornwall and King of the Romans, made Lest withiel, including Penkneth, a free borough. Edmund, Earl of Cornwall, his son, appears to have been the chief benefactor to this town ; he erected handsome build ings, at a great charge, for his Exchequer, for a shire-hall, &c. ordaining, that the coinage and sale of tin ssiould be at Lostwithiel only, and that all the county-meet ings ssiould be held there. These privileges, after his death, were soon disregarded, for we find that, in 13 14, the burgesses of Lostwithiel complain, that the men of Bodmin, Truro, and Helston, had caused tin to be sold at those towns ; and that the prior of Bodmin had then lately procured the county-meetings to be held at Bodmin. On their petition to parliament, they got redress ; but it is most pro bable, that their exclusive possession of these privileges was of ssiort duration. The county-elections, however, continue to this day to be held here, and the Epiphany and Midsummer quarter- sessions. It appears doubtful, whether there was ever a palace of the Earls of Cornwall at Lostwithiel'; the building which is supposed to have been the palace, was, no doubt, the fame that was erected by Edmund Earl of Cornwall, for his court of Exchequer, with a hall, &c. : in this hall, which is yet standing, were held the Stannary parliaments : here is also the Stannary court, with a prison adjoining, the only one in the county belonging to the Stannaries, used occa sionally by the county during the sessions.

The town of Lostwithiel was incorporated by James I. in 1623 ; the charter was renewed by King George II. in 1732. The corporation consists of seven capital burgesses, one of whom is annually elected mayor, and seventeen assistants. This borough has sent members to parliament ever since the reign of Edward I.: the right of election is vested in the corporation. Addison the poet was some time one of its representatives. The market is on Friday, by prescrip tion : a corn-market, free of toll, has lately been establissied. There are three fairs for the sale of horses, bullocks, ssieep, &c; July 10, September 4, and November 13. The number of houses in Lostwithiel in 1801, was 125 ; that of inhabitants, 743: in 1811, the number of houses was 137; that of inhabitants, 825. Lostwithiel was, in the summer of 1644, the head-quarters of the Earl of Essex's army: previously to this, a battle had been fought near the town, in which Sir Richard Grenville, commanding some of the King's forces, was defeated by Lord Robartes's brigade. Dugdale relates, that the church of Lostwithiel was profaned by Essex's soldiers, and injured by an explosion of gun-powder. Partly within the borough of Lostwithiel is the manor of Polchoath, belonging to the Honourable Mrs. Agar, as representative of the Robartes family. In the parissi-church is a memorial for Tristram Curtys, Esq., who died in 1423: this ancient family, since extinct, occasionally represented the borough from the reign of Edward I. to that of Henry V.: this Tristram Curtys was member for Lostwithiel in the ninth year of King Henry V. : Leland speaks of his descendant, as \" a man of 100 marks land, dwelling between Blowghan and Penknek by Lostwithiel.\" The curious font has been already spoken of. The church of Lostwithiel was appropriated to the priory of Tywardreth. The Prince of Wales, as Duke of Cornwall, is patron of the vicarage, which is endowed with the great tithes ; but from the small extent of the parissi, which comprizes only a few meadows and orchards adjoining the town, they are of small value. There is a grammar-school in this town, establissied by the corporation about the year 1770; the master has a salary of 30I. per annum. There is also a writing-school, to the master of which the corporation allows a salary of iol. per annum. One of the schools, endowed with 5I. per annum, for the education of poor children, by the trustees of Mr. St. John Eliot's charitable donation, is at this place.

The principal villages in this parissi are, Bowgyhere, Carvossen-Downs, Crowliss, Ludgvan- Lees, and Tornewidden. About half a mile below the church-town, crossing the road to Marazion, is a vallum, thrown up in the civil war by the parliamentary forces, when they besieged St. Michael's Mount. The manor of Ludgvan-Lees was granted by Richard Earl of Cornwall to the family of Ferrers, from whom it passed, by successive female heirs, to those of Champernown and Willoughby (Lord Brooke). The coheiresses of the latter brought it to Pawlet and Blount (Lord Montjoy) : it now belongs to the coheirs of the late Duke of Boston. The barton of Tremenhere is the property of John Rogers, Esq., of Penrose, who has an occasional residence at Trassow or Trerassow, in this parissi. In the parissi-church lies buried the learned Dr. Borlase, author of \" The Natural History and Antiquities of Cornwall, and Observations on the Scilly Islands',\" who was for 52 years rector of this parissi, as appears by a Latin inscrip tion on his tomb, already partially obliterated. Dr.Borlase communicated several papers to the Royal Sociely, which are printed in their Transactions ; and had prepared for the press, and began printing, a treatise concerning the Creation and Deluge. Dr.Borlase was also for 40 years vicar of his native parissi, St.Just : he died August 31,1 772, in the 77th year of his age. The advowson of the rectory is an appendage of the manor of Ludgvan-Lees. There were chapels, formerly, at Trewell, Ludgvan-Lees, and on the tenement of Collurian\": the latter, of which there are some small remains, was dedicated to St. Thomas, and acquired the corrupted name of Tubmas-Chapel. The sum of 61. per annum, being the interest of monies bequeathed to this parissi for charitable uses, has been long appropriated to the teaching of poor children.

Another manor of Luxulion, which belongs to the Honourable Mrs.Agar, as representative of the Robartes family, was in the Collins family in the reign of Queen Elizabeth\\ It was purchased, in the year 1628, by Richard Lord Robartes, of Nicholas Kendall, Esq. and others. Mrs. Agar has also the manor of Bodwithgy (which belonged at an early period to the Cardinhams% and is said by Hals to have been a seat of the Prideaux family); it was purchased by her ancestor, John Robartes, of the Carminows, in the year 1583 : this manor extends into Lanivet. The duchy manor of Grediowe is partly in this parissi. The manor of Prideaux belonged to the ancient family of that name, who had a castle on the site of the barton.

The manor of Eathorn, now the property of Wearn Nicholas, Esq., was formerly in the family of Serjeaux, from whom it passed, by a coheiress, to the Veres, Earls of Oxford. The barton of Carveth was the seat of a family of that name, one of whose ancestors had married a coheiress of Otho Penaluna : Henry Carveth sold this barton, in the reign of Charles I., to Thomas Melhuissi. The Carveths removed to Mewdon in Mawnan, and afterwards to Cosaws in Gluvias. The barton of Carveth, on which is now a farm-house, belongs to Mr. J. Gwennap, of Falmouth. The barton of Tremogh was in ancient times the seat of a family of that name, from whom it passed, by a female heir, to that of Blois of Penryn. It was sold by the latter, in 1703, to John Worth, Esq., (ssieriff of the county in 17 12,) who inclosed a park, and built a large mansion, now converted into a farm house. This estate is the property of Mr. Robert Crow, by purchase from Dr. Hooper, who married the heiress of Worth. Spargo, in this parissi, is described by Norden as a seat of the Randolls or Rundles ; but we are informed, that although that barton was their property, their seat was not there, but at Trewoon, now a farm-house. This parissi, called in ancient ecclesiastical records Lavabe or Lavapper, forms, together with Milor, an united vicarage. The great tithes, which were appro priated to the college of Glaseney, are now vested in John Hext, Esq. The Bissiop of Exeter is patron of the vicarage.

Perhaps this was the Treserret which was a seat of Sir John Trelawney, a distinguissied military character in the reign of Henry V., and was inherited by one of his younger sons. Treblethick was for many generations the scat of the ancient family of Hamley, in whom it continued when Hals made his collections, early in the last century ; it soon afterwards became the property of the Treises, and having passed with Tre visquite to the Morssieads, was sold by the late Sir John Morfliead to A.

It is now the property and seat of Deeble Peter, Esq. The old mansion has been pulled down, and a new house built by the present proprietor. Heligan belonged formerly to the Hills, and seems to have been acquired by marriage with the heiress of Fantleroy, who married the heiress of Thomas Flamank. About the middle of the seventeenth century, Heligan, which is now a farm house, was the seat of the family of Silly. It was sold by Miss Julia Silly (now wife of William Lyddon, Esq.) to E. J.

The principal village in this parissi is Lanyon. The manor of Alwarton (now called Alvarton, Penzance, and Mousehole,) appears to have taken its name from Aluardus, who possessed it in the reign of Edward the Confessor : soon after the Conquest, it was in the Pomeroys : in the reign of Edward I., it belonged to the baronial family of Tyes, from whom it passed, by successive female heirs, to the Lifles and Berkeleys. This manor having become vested in the crown, was granted to Whitmore and others, and has been divided into severalties. The barton, which is in this parissi, is occupied as a farm-house. The barton of Treneere belonged to the family of Oliver, by whom it was alienated in 1 768 : the old mansion has been converted into a barn and outhouses: the estate was sold in parcels ; a third part was purchased by the Rev.

In the parissi-church are memorials for the families of Borlase, Fleming, Harris, and Nicholls. There was a chapel in the parissi of Maddern, dedicated to St. Bridget, and another at Lanyon.

In or about the year 1704, Mr. George Daniel founded a school at Maddern, for the instruction of poor children of this parissi, and its chapelries Morva and Penzance, in reading, writing, and arithmetic ; endowing it with a house and garden for the master, and certain lands and premises, now let at 122k per annum. The celebrated well at Maddern has been elsewhere spoken of at large.c Penzance, a large market and corporation town, formerly called Burriton, is situated on the sea-coast, in Mount's-bay, 283 miles from London, and eleven from the Land's-end. A market at this town, to be held on Wednesdays, was granted in 1332 to Alice De Lifled, then lady of the manor of Alwarton, with a fair for seven days at the festival of St. Peter ad vincula: this market was con firmed, in 1404, to Thomas Lord Berkeley, with three fairs of two days each ; one at the Conception, another at the Nativity of the Virgin Mary, and a third at the festival of St. Peter in cathedra. In later times there have been two markets formerly Tuesday and Thursday, since changed to Thursday and Saturday : these markets are well supplied with provisions of all sorts : Thursday is a considerable corn-market.

The corporation consists of a mayor, eight aldermen, twelve assistants, and a recorder. Carew relates the particulars of this town having been set on fire by a small party of Spaniards, who landed near Mousehole, on the 23d of July 1595, and who, as Camden observes, were the only Spaniards that ever landed in this kingdom as enemies. Sir Francis Godolphin, having summoned the county to his assistance, attempted to save Penzance from the threatened danger ; but his followers being seized with a sudden panic, he was obliged to abandon it to its fate. The Cornissi men having rallied the next day in greater numbers and in better heart, the Spaniards, who had already set fire to Newlyn and Mousehole, as well as Penzance, quitted the coast without attempting any further hostilities. Penzance is said to have been plundered by Sir Thomas Fairfax's army in 1646, as a punissiment for the kindness which the inhabitants had ssiown to Lord Goring's and Lord Hopton's troops.1 Penzance is a large and populous town, much frequented in the winter by invalids, on account of the mildness of the climate. The number of houses in 1801 was 694, of inhabitants 3,382 ; in 181 1, there were 784 houses, and 4,022 inhabitants. Here is a considerable pilchard-fissiery, and a great export trade for tin, copper, and fissi ; the imports are coals, groceries, cloth, and other articles of merchandize. Penzance was added as a fifth to the coinage towns about the time of the Restoration ; all the tin is now coined at this town and Truro. The chapel of St.Mary, at Penzance, existed before the year 161 2; it was enlarged in 1671, but not consecrated till 1680, when it was endowed with land, now let at 2 ok per annum, by John Tremenhere, Esq. : a cemetery was then inclosed and consecrated, and the limits of the town were defined to be the limits of the chapelry. It has since been twice augmented by Queen Anne's bounty. Marriages have not been solemnized at this chapel since the marriage-act. Pen zance is not deemed a separate parissi, but has its own vestry, and maintains its own poor. There was an ancient chapel at Penzance, dedicated to St.Anthony, near the Quay, on the site of which is now a fissi-cellar. The registers of the see of Exeter mention chapels there, dedicated to St. Raphael and St. Gabriel/ There are meeting-houses at Penzance for the baptists, independents, quakers, and methodists ; and a Jews' synagogue. f Borlase's MS.

The market has been long disused, but a cattle-fair is still held at Milbrook, within the manor of Inceworth, on the 29th of September ; another cattle-fair has lately been establissied on the first of May. The manor of Inceworth, which had been at a very early period in the Valetorts, came to the Champernowns as a marriage-portion with Joan, natural daughter of Richard, King of the Romans, by Joan Valetort, a coheiress of that family: the Champernowns continued to possess this manor in the reign of Henry VI. : it has been a considerable time in the Trefusis family, and is now the property of the Right Honourable Lord Clinton. There was formerly a chapel at Inceworth. The ancient mansion of the Champernowns was remaining in Carew's time. Milbrook, which Leland calls \" a riche fischar town,\" is partly in Devonssiire and partly in Cornwall.

There. is now a small market on Saturday for butchers'-meat : there were, within the memory of man, four fairs; February 13, May i, August 1, and October 10; but they have been discontinued for several years. There is a great pilchard-fissiery at this place, from which they export abundance both of pilchards and pilchard-oil ; the imports are salt, lime-stone, &c. &c.

By the deed of foundation, the master is to reside in one of the Looesr, to instruct poor children of the county of Cornwall in the mathematics, particularly in those branches which relate to navigation. The appointment of the master, after the death of the original trustees, was vested in the heirs of Charles Trelawney, and the proprietor of Trelawney-house : the interest of the endowment was appro priated as a salary for the master, except such part as the trustees ssiould think requisite for the purchase of books, globes, and mathematical instruments.

Sir John Arundell, the last of the Lanherne branch, in 1701, settled his estates on his grandson Richard Bil singe, Esq., who was to take the name of Arundell. The only daughter and heir of this Richard, by her marriage with Lord Arundell of Wardour, united the two branches. The manor of Lanherne having been settled on the late dowager Lady Arundell, was by her bequeathed to her daughter Lady Clifford, of whom it has been purchased by her nephew, the Honourable Everard Arundell, son and heir of the present Lord Arundell. Lanherne-house, which was long the chief seat of the elder branch of the Arundells, was fitted up by the late Lord Arundell as an asylum for the convent of Carmelite nuns, then lately emigrated from Antwerp, where they had been establissied ever since the year 1619: it is still inhabited by this convent, which not long ago consisted of sixteen nuns. An estate, now known by the name of the manor of Gliven-Flamack, which be longed to the Arundells, was sold about the year 1800, by the late Lord Arundell, to Thomas Rawlings, Esq. of Padstow, who is the present proprietor.

It was purchased of the former by Sir Nicholas Slanning, who was killed at the siege of Bristol, in the reign of Charles I. : his son, who was made a baronet by King Charles II., sold it to Mr. Bryan Rogers of Falmouth. Having passed by marriage to the Hearses, it was sold by them to the Kempes ; and by the latter, about the year 1 740, to Dame Mary Pendarves, mother of Robert Hoblyn, Esq. of Nanfwhyden : it is now the property of the Rev.

The manor of Bossienso, in this parissi, was purchased of Dr. Cantley by Sir Michael Nowell, uncle of Stephen Usticke, Esq., the present proprietor. The manor and barton of Penwarne, which was for many generations the seat of an ancient and respectable family of that name, who were hereditary bailiffs of the hundred of Kirrier, has been alienated since Hals drew up his account of this parissi.

The principal villages in this parissi are Bealbury and Reason. The manor of West-Newton-Ferrers takes its name from the ancient family of Ferrers, who possessed it at an early period, and so late as the year 1314 : it has been for many generations in the Coryton family, whose ancestor married the heiress of Ferrers, and is now the property of John Tillie Coryton, Esq., whose grandfather, Peter Goodall, Esq., took the name of Coryton in consequence of inheriting considerable estates under the will of Sir William Coryton, Bart. Newton-park was the ancient residence of the Corytons : Carew calls it \" Master Corington's house of Newton, old to him by succession, yet new in respect of his own antiquity.\" Sir John Coryton was created a baronet in 1661 : the title and male line of this ancient family became extinct by the death of his grandson of the same name in 1739. Newton-park is now the seat of Weston Helyar, Esq., by inheritance from Dame Rachael Coryton3, to whom it was given by her hussiand Sir John. Crocadon, in this parissi, was for many generations the seat of the Trevisa family, and is said to have been the birth-place of John Trevisa, who translated the Bible, Ralph Higden's Polychronicon, and Bartholom\u00e6us \" de Proprietatibus Rerum.\" It was purchased of William Trevisa, the last of the family, by Sir William Coryton, Bart., about the year 1690, and is now the property of John Tillie Coryton, Esq. of Pentillie.

The manor of Menheniot, alias Tregelly, belonged at an early period to the Carminows, afterwards to the Trelawneys. Leland, writing in the reign of Henry VIII., fays, that Trelawney, then living, was the fourth of the name who had been lords of Menheniot. This manor is now the property of Mr. Joseph Hambly.

The manor of Tregartha, which had been purchased of the Eriseys by Tre lawney, before the year 1620% is now the property of Francis Rawle, Esq., by purchase from the coheiresses of Joseph Gartrell. The manor of Cartuther, called by Leland \" Cortyder or Cotyder, a goodly lordssiip, and an old manor place of a hundred pound by the year,\" belonged, as that author was informed by Mr. Trelawney, to the family of Heling or Eling ; the fame, probably, who from this their residence took the name of Cartuther, and became extinct about the year 1400 : the heiress or coheiress of this family, brought Cartuther to the Becketsf. The late Sir John Morssiead, Bart., who possessed this manor by inheritance from his grandfather, sold it to Samuel Kekewich, Esq., of Peamore near Exeter, the present proprietor. Cartuther, which was some time the residence of the Morssieads, is now a farm-house. Sir John Morssiead was possessed, also, of the manor of Tregondale, which had belonged to the priory of Plympton, and afterwards to the Chivertons. The manor of Trethew, which in the reign of James I. belonged to the family of Vaughan, is now the property of Francis Glanville, Esq. of Catchfrench. The barton of Trehawke, many years the seat of a family of that name, was given, by the late John Trehawke, Esq., to Samuel Kekewich, Esq., the present proprietor. It is now a farm-house, the property of Mr. Penwarne. Trevedoc, in this parissi, was formerly a scat of the Beres ; there are two tene ments of this name, both farm-houses. Botterton, or Butterdon, and Penhanger, which passed by marriage from the Killigrews to the Wreys, are now farm-houses ; the former belongs to the heirs of the late Edward Trelawney, Esq. ; the latter to John Morth Woolcombe, Esq., of Assibury in Devonssiire. Trewint, some time a seat of the Kelly family, is now a farm-house, belonging to Mr. Abraham Hambly. There are no remains of Trencreek, an ancient mansion, said, by a vague tradition, to have been a hunting-seat of the Dukes of Cornwall: it belonged, some time, to the Trevilles.

The barton of Coldrinnick in St.Germans pays great tithes to the vicar of Menheniot. William of Wykham was vicar of this parissi. Dr. Moreman, a learned divine, who was instituted to the vicarage of Menheniot in the reign of Henry VIII., is said to have been the first in those parts who taught and catechised his parissiioners in the Englissi language\". There was formerly a chapel at Cartuther, dedicated to St. Nicholas'. Within the boundaries of this parissi, near the town of Lissieard, was in 'mcient times a hospital of lepers, dedicated to St.Mary Magdalen. The interest of 42k was given by Mr. Question, vicar of Menheniot, for the support of a schoolmaster, and the interest of 25I. by Mr. Edmund Snell for the fame purpose. The parissi of Menheniot abounds with beautiful scenery ; its numerous valleys being pleasingly diversified with rock and wood. St.Merean or St.Merryn, in the hundred and deanery of Pyder, lies about two miles and a half west-south-west from Padstow, which is the post-office town, and about seven miles nearly north of St.Columb. The principal villages in this parissi, exclusively of the church-town, are, Polmark or Polmarth, Towan and Trevear. There is a small quay or pier under Catacleuse Cliffs, constructed about 1794 by Mr. Peter of Harlyn, for the reception of coasting-vessels, and of the seam-boats belonging to the pilchard-fissiery carried on in Portlease bay. The manor of Trevose, in this parissi, is the property of Sir A. O. Molefworth, Bart-, by inheritance from the Morices of Werington : at an earlier period it had been in the Robartes family. The barton was on lease in Hals's time as two farms, to Gregory Peter, Esq., and Lawrence Growden, whom he calls that well known quaker ; one of these is still on lease to the family of Peter ; the other to Thomas Rawlings, Esq. of Padstow ; there is a farm-house on each.

Adjoining to St.Merran, or Harlyn warren, was in ancient times a village with a chapel, or, as it is said, a parissi-church, dedicated to St.Conflantine : some ruins of this building still remain, consisting of part of the east end ;- some broken arches and pillars', and a considerable part of the tower : a richly ornamented aisle is said to have been standing till about the year 1780. The festival of St.Constan tine (March 9) was, till very lately, kept at St.Merran by an annual hurling match, on which occasion the owner of Harlyn had, from time immemorial, supplied the silver ball. We are informed from good authority that a ssiepherd's family, of the name of Edwards, held one of the cottages in Constantine for many generations under the owner of Harlyn, by the annual render of a Cornissi pie, made of limpets, raisins, and sweet herbs at the feast of St. Constantine. Merther, in the deanery and in the west division of the hundred of Powder, lies about four miles west from Tregony, and about three east from Truro, which is the post-office town. The principal villages in this parissi are Long-Lane and Tresilian bridge : at this bridge was signed the treaty between Lord Hopton and the parliament, after the King's affairs had grown desperate, in the month -of March 1 646. There are cattle-fairs at Tresilian bridge on the second Monday in February, and on the Monday before Whitsunday. There is said to have been a monastery of poor Clares at this place, founded by the Carminows, but we have not been able to find any records relating to it.

It is probable that the manor of Merther merged in that of Fentongollan, which extends into this parissi, and was purchased, by Lord Fal moutth's ancestor, of Sir Nicholas Hals about the year 1620. The family of Hals had a seat in this parissi, called Tresawsen, which continued longer in their possession, and was the residence of Mr. William Hals, author of the Parochial History of Cornwall : it is now a farm-house. Merther, although a separate parissi, is esteemed a chapelry of Probus : the principal inhabitants appoint the curate. Mevagissey, in the deanery and in the east division of the hundred of Powder, anciently called Lamorrack or Lavorack, lies on the western side of St.Austell bay, six miles east-south-east from Grampound, the fame distance east from Tregony, and nearly south from St.Austell. It has, by prescription, a weekly market on Saturdays for provisions. Tonkin fays, that Mevagissey, which had been lately a poor fissiing- village, contained in his time 200 houses\" ; that a pier had been constructed at the expence of the Trewolla family ; that it was then the most convenient place on the coast for the pilchard-fissiery ; that, on an average, 12,000 hogssieads were taken and cured annually; and in 1724, 16,505 hogs heads. The fissiery is not now so extensive as it then was : the season of 1 8 1 2 was esteemed a successful one, yet not more than 10,000 hogssieads had been caught on the 1st of October. The present number of houses in the parissi is above 370. Ships of 100 tons burden may ride securely in the pool or basin at Mevagissey. The fissiing cove of Porth-Mellin is partly in this parissi. The manor of Trelevan, which includes a great part of the town of Mevagissey, belonged for several generations to the family of Trewolla of Trewolla in St. Gorran, and was by them sold, in or about the year 1667, to Walter Vincent, Esq. of Truro, who in 1680, was appointed one of the barons of the Exchequer, but died on his journey to London, before he had been sworn in. His grandson Nicholas, who died in 1726, mortgaged this estate to John Knight, Esq., of Gosfield-hall in Essex : it is now the property of the Marquis of Buckingham, by inheritance from the late Marchioness, whose father, Earl Nugent, married the widow of Mr. Knight above-mentioned. \u00bb The eastern part of the town, which, in o'd deeds, is called Porthilly, belongs to the Rev.

The barton of Trelevan was successively the seat of the families of Croome and Stevens, as lessees under the Trewollas : the Vincents, having bought in the lease, made it their residence. Mr. Tonkin, the Cornissi antiquary, who was next heir to this estate, if it had not been mortgaged beyond the power of redemp tion, resided for some time at Trelevan, after the death of the last of the Vincents. The barton-house is now in the occupation of the Rev. Dr. Lyne, vicar of Meva gissey, as lessee for life under the Marquis of Buckingham. Tonkin speaks of a strong chalybeate spring on this estate, called, from its sulphureous scum, the Brass well, and fays that it resembled the Tunbridge waters, and had performed many cures : this well has been destroyed ; it had not for many years been applied to any medicinal uses. The manor of Pentuan was the property, and its barton the chief seat, of the Pentires, after they removed from Pentire in Endellion. The heiress of Pentire, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, married Roscarrock, from whom this estate passed, by marriage, to the Darts of Dart-Ralph, in the county of Devon. The manor was sold by the latter to Lord Robartes : the last Earl of Radnor, of that family, bequeathed it to Sir James Laroche, Bart.; on the sale of whose property, in 1792, it was purchased by the present proprietor, the Rev. H. H. Tremayne, of Heligan. The barton having been the seat of Charles Dart, Esq., who married the heiress of Roscarrock, was not sold with the manor to Lord Robartes : having passed by marriage to the Tremaynes, it descended to the Rev. Mr. Tremayne, now lord of the manor. The manor of Penwarne belonged to an ancient family of that name. Vivian Penwarne, who died in the reign of Henry VII., left three daughters, coheirs married to Cofwarth, Penhallow, and Penwarne of Penwarne in Mawnan. The elder daughter inherited this manor, which passed, in marriage with the heiress of Cofwarth, to Alan Hill, Esq. In the parissi-church is a monument, with figures of himself and his wife, in memory of Otwell Hill, Esq. of Penwarne, (son of Alan,) who died in 161 4, with the following epitaph: \" Stock Lancashire, birth London, Cornwall gave To Otwell Hill inhabitance and grave: Frank, frugal, pleasant, sober, stout and kind, Of woorde true, just in deede men did him find.

Penwarne, after Mr. Hill's death, passed to his nephew, John Carew, second son of Richard Carew of Anthony, the Cornish historian. This John Carew distinguissied himself at the siege of Ostend in 1601, where he lost his right hand by a cannon-ball : Camden, in his annals of Queen Elizabeth, makes mention of his extraordinary fortitude on this occasionq ; his only son Richard died without issue in 1 640, leaving five sisters, three of whom were married, one to Fortefcue, another to Hoblyn of Antron, and the third to Hoblyn of Nanfwhyden. The manor and barton of Penwarne passed afterwards by sale to Arthur Fortescuej Esq., of Filleigh in Devonssiire : since the death of John Fortefcue of Penwarne, in 1776, it has been sold in lots by his sons W.

The manor and barton of Carhayes belonged at an early period to the Arundells and passed, with an heiress of that family, to the Trevanions, who had their original seat at Trevanion, in this parissi : there is still a park at the last-mentioned place, although there are no remains of the ancient mansion. Richard Trevanion was one of the members for the county in the reign of Henry V. Sir Hugh Trevanion is said to have been knighted at Bosworth-field. Sir Charles Trevanion was a great sufferer for his loyalty in the civil war ; his son John was slain, with Sir Nicholas Slanning, at the siege of Bristol. Lord Clarendon, speaking of the death of these brave officers, fays, \" they were the life and soul of the Cornissi regiment ; both young, neither of them above eight and twenty ; of entire friendssiip to each other, and to Sir Beville Grenville, whose body was not yet buried.\" Richard Trevanion was a distinguissied naval officer ; he died in France, whither he had followed the fortunes of his master, King James II., after his abdication.

The manor and barton of Penkevil belonged, in the reign of Edward I., to the family of De Wen, from whom Hals supposes it passed, in marriage, to the Penkevils ; it is, however, quite as probable, that it was the fame family who had changed their name to Penkevil, from the place of their abode : this family, fays Hals, flourissied for several descents in a genteel degree, between the dignities of a justice of peace and a hundred-constable, till the reign of Queen Elizabeth, when Penkevil was given or sold to George Courtenay, Gent., whose great-grandson alienated it to Hender Molefworth, Esq. (afterwards a Baronet): by the latter it was conveyed to Hugh Boscawen, Esq., ancestor of Lord Viscount Falmouth, who is the present proprietor. The manor of Fentongollan, which extends into the parissi of Merther, is said to have belonged, at an early period, to a family of the same name, from whom it passed, by a succession of female heirs, to the families of Trejago and Trenoweth.

Hals, speaking of the hospitality of John Carminow the grandson, says, that \" he kept open house for all comers and goers, drinkers, minstrells, dancers, and what not, during the Christmas time, and that his usual allowance of provision for those twelve days, were 1 2 fat bullocks, 20 Cornissi"], [612, "CORNWALL. 232 Cornissi bussiels of wheat (i.e. 50 Winchesters5), 36 ssieep, with hogs, lambs, and fowls of all sort, and drink made of wheat and oat malt proportionable ; for at that time barley-malt was little known or used in those parts.\" Oliver Carminow, son of John, is said to have squandered away the greater part of his very valuable estates: he left two daughters', married to Salter and Cole, by whom this manor was sold, in the year 1600, to the Holcombes. Sir Nicholas Hals purchased this estate in 1603, and made Fentongollan his residence: his son John sold it to Ezekiel Grosse, whose daughter and heiress brought this and several other estates to Francis Busier, Esq., of Shillingham : it was purchased of that family, about the year 1676, by Hugh Boscawen, Esq., ancestor of Lord Viscount Falmouth, the present proprietor. Mr. Boscawen, soon after his purchase of this estate, pulled down the fine old mansion of the Carminows, with its lofty towers and fine chapel : a farm house occupies the site. Tregothnan, the seat of Lord Viscount Falmouth, came to the Boscawens in marriage with the heiress of Tregothnan, in the fourteenth century. The Bos cawen family had, at an early period, been settled at Boscawen in Burian, whence, after this match, they removed to Tregothnan. Hugh Boscawen paid a fine of four marks, for not attending at the coronation of Philip and Mary, to receive the honor of knighthood : his descendant, Richard Boscawen, paid a fine of 5I. on a similar occasion, to be released from the order of the Bath at the creation of Prince Henry : their descendant, Hugh Boscawen, was in 1720 created Baron of Bofcawen-Rose and Viscount Falmouth. The present possessor of these titles is Edward Boscawen, grandson of Admiral Boscawen, and great-grandson of the first Viscount: he succeeded to the title and estates on the death of his father George Evelyn, the late Viscount, in i8o3. Tregothnan-house is now rebuilding, under the direction of Mr. Wilkins, jun., the architect. The parks and pleasure grounds are well wooded, and being near the sea-coast, abound with beautiful views. Treganyan or Tregonian, formerly the scat of a family of that name, passed, by sue .essive female heirs, to the Haleps and Sayers ; by bequest, from the latter to Trevelyan ; and by a coheiress of Trevelyan to Rowe : it was purchased of the Rowes by Mr. George Simmons, who conveyed it to Lord Falmouth : the barton house is occupied by a farmer. Nancarrow, in this parissi, was the property of a family to whom it gave name. * It should be 60 ; a Cornish bu/hel contains three of Winchester measure.

I [n"], [613, "CORNWALL 233 In the parissi-church are several monuments of the Boscawen family: the earliest is that of Hugh Boscawen, who married one of the coheiresses of Carminow, and died in 1559. The monument of Admiral Boscawen, which is ornamented with his bust, surrounded by naval trophies, was executed by Ryssirack, from a design of Adam's. The following inscription is said to have been from the pen of his accomplissied widow : \u2014 \" Here lies the Right Honourable Edward Boscawen, Admiral of the Blue, General of Marines, Lord of the Admiralty, and one of His Majesty's most honourable Privy Council : his birth though noble, his titles though illustrious, were but incidental additions to his greatness. History, in more expressible and more indelible characters, will inform latest posterity with what ardent zeal, with what successful valor, he served his country ; and taught her enemies to dread her naval power. In command he was equal to every emergency, superior to every difficulty ; in his high departments masterly and upright : his example formed, while his patronage rewarded merit. With the highest exertions of military greatness, he united the gentlest offices of humanity ; his concern for the interest, and unwearied attention to the health of all under his command, softened the necessary exactions of duty, and the rigours of discipline, by the care of a guardian and the tenderness of a father. Thus beloved and revered, amiable in private life as illustrious in public, this gallant and profitable servant of his country, when he was beginning to reap the harvest of his toils and dangers, in the full meridian of vears and glory, after having been providentially preserved through every peril incident to his profession, died of a fever, on the 1 oth of January, in the year 1 76 1, at Hatchland's park, in Surrey, a seat he had just sinissied, (at the expence of the enemies of his country,) and amidst the groans and tears of his beloved Cornissimen, was here deposited. His once happy wife inscribes this marble, an unequal testimony of his worth and her affection.\" Admiral Boscawen was a very distinguissied officer : he signalized himself in the year 1747, as Captain of the Namur, and the fame year had the command of the naval and land forces in an expedition to the East-Indies, being the only commission of that kind which had then been given to any officer since the reign of Charles II. His most prominent services were the capture of Louissiurgh and its dependencies in 1758, which led to the conquest of Canada, and the defeat of a detachment of the French fleet in 1759, off Cape Lagos. He was one of the lords of the Admiralty from 1751 till his death. The Honourable Mrs.Boscawen died February 26, 1 805, and was buried near her hussiand at St.Michael-Penkevil.

Lord Falmouth is patron of the rectory : the advowson was purchased, together with some chantry-lands, of John Hals, by his ancestor, Hugh Boscawen, Esq. There was formerly a chapel at Fentongollan, dedicated to the Virgin Mary. There is a free-school in this parissi, supported by Lord Falmouth. Michaelstow, in the hundred of Lesnewth and deanery of Trigg-Minor, lies about three miles south-south-west from Camelford, which is the post-office town, and about seven miles and a half north from Bodmin. The only village in the parissi, besides the church-town, is Treveighan. The duchy manor of Helston in Trigg extends over the greater part of the parissi. Helssiury park, long since disparkedw, is held under the duchy by the Duke of Bedford. There was anciently a castle at Helssiury, spoken of by William of Worcester, in his Itinerary of Cornwall, (temp. Edw. IV.) At a place called the Beacon1, just without the park, is a castle-mount, with con siderable earth-works, which, it is probable, was its site. Tregone, formerly a seat of the Mayows, is now a farm-house, the property of Mr. Hocken. Trevenin, some time a seat of the Lowers, is now the property of Mathew Michell, Esq. The rectory of Michaelstow is in the patronage of the Duke of Cornwall. Milor or Mylor, in the deanery and in the east division of the hundred of Kirrier, lies two miles and a half nearly east-north-east from Penryn. This parissi forms the south-south-east side of Falmouth harbour ; its principal villages are Flussiing and Milor-bridge. Flussiing, to which the Dutch are said to have given that name, increased much in population inconsequence of the improvements made, in the early part of the last century, by Samuel Trefusis, Esq., who levelled the u Other memorials of the Boscawen family at St. Michael- Penkevil, are those of Nicholas Boscawen, who married a coheiress of Treyanion, and died in 1626 ; Edward Boscawen, of Nan carrow, 1619 ; and Elizabeth Anne Viscountess Falmouth (daughter of John Crewe, Esq.), 1793. w It was till lately a rabbit-warren. x There is a very extensive view from this beacon. ground,"], [615, "CORNWALL. 235 ground, constructed quays, and erected numerous buildings at a great expence ; he endeavoured also to establissi the packets there, but failed in his attempt ; in consequence of which, Mr.Tonkin, who wrote in 1736, observes, that the town did not flourissi as was expected, and that several houses were then uninhabited. Flussiing has of late years been much resorted to by invalids, on account of the mildness of the climate ; it is only half a mile distant, by water, from Falmouth, which is the post-office town : a ferry-boat is constantly passing to and fro. Part of Perran-wharf or Perran-cove is in this parissi, including a large iron-foundery belonging to Messrs. Fox. The small manor of Milor, in which the church is situated, was held by the Killegrews under the St.Aubyns, as of their manor of Kymyell : it is now the property of Lord Wodehouse, who possesses the Killegrew estates in right of his lady/ The manor of Restronguet, called in old records Restronges and Restrongeth, belonged at an early period to the Cardinhams, afterwards to the Bodrugans : on the attainder of Sir Henry Bodrugan, it was given by King Henry VII. to William Trevanion, Esq.1, whose descendant possessed it considerably more than two cen turies : it was purchased of them by the father of the late Lord Clinton ; the latter sold it to Sir William Lemon, Bart., M.P. for the county, whose seat is at Carclew, in this parissi. Carclew, in the reign of Henry II., belonged to an ancient family of the name of Daungers, and in some old records is called Cargelew- Dangerus. The coheiresses of Daungers, in the reign of Henry IV., married Renaudin and Bonithon. The Renaudins soon became extinct : the Bonithons continued to possess Carclew till the year 1677, when the last heir male of the elder branch died : his only daughter married Samuel Kempe, Esq.; and surviving her hussiand, bequeathed Carclew to Mr. James Bonithon of Grampound, of whom it was purchased by Sir William Lemon's grandfather in 1749. Tonkin fays, that Mr. Kempe built a noble house at Carclew ; this house, which had never been inhabited when Mr. Lemon made the purchase, was by him altered, enlarged, and fitted up with colonnades, offices, &c. from the designs of Edwards, an architect at that time of day much employed in the west of England : there is a view of this house, which is faced with white moor-stone, in Borlase's Natural History. Within the manor of Restronguet is Restronguet-passage, the nearest road from Truro to Falmouth.

Nankerry, which was for several generations the lease hold seat of a younger branch of the Lytteltons, is now a farm-house, belonging to Lord Clinton. In the parissi-church are the monuments of Francis Trefusis, Esq., 1680; Edmund Bayntun Yescombe, Esq., captain of the King George Lission packet, who lost his life in defending his ssiip against the enemy in 1803; and some memorials of the family of Donythorn. The registers of the see of Exeter speak of a chapel near Pentyre, in this parissi, dedicated to St.Laudb. The great tithes of Milor, which were appropriated to Glaseney college, are now vested in Lord Clinton: the Bissiop of Exeter is patron of the vicarage, which is consolidated with Mabe. Minster, in the hundred of Lesnewth and deanery of Trigg-Minor, lies nearly five miles north from Camelford, which is the post-office town ; three miles east north-east from the borough of Boffiney ; and 1 8 from Padstow. At this place was a priory of black monks, called Minster or Talcarne, founded by William de Bottreaux, as a cell to Tywardreth, which priory was subject to the abbey of St.Sergius and Bacchus at Angiers : there are some small remains of the ruins near Minster church. The manor, honor, and borough of Bottreaux castle, now called Bofcastle, and the manor of Worthyvale, were among the ancient possessions of the baronial family of Botterell or Bottreaux, who were settled here as early as the reign of Henry II. William Botterell, and his younger brother Reginald, were both among the rebel barons in arms againstKingHenrylll.: with the exception of Reginald,whosucceeded his elder brother in the possession of this honor, the ten successive owners were all Williams. William Lord Bottreaux, the last of the family, was killed at the battle of St.Albans, in 1462, leaving an only daughter, married to Sir Robert Hunger ford : the principal residence of this ancient family was at the castle called after their name, of which the mount only now remains. Leland speaks of the manor place as a thing of small reputation, \" far unworthie the name of a cartel ; the people there,\" says he, \" call it the court.\" Carew fays, \" the diversified rooms of a prison in the castle, for both sexes, better preserved by the inhabitants memoiie a See p.

The manor-house, now in a state of dilapidation, was occasionally inhabited by Sir John Cotton, then lord of the manor, who died in 1703. The manors of Boscastle and Worthyvale passed, with the heiress of Hungerford, to the noble family of Hastings. Henry Hastings, Earl of Huntingdon, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, sold the manor and lordship of Bottreaux castle to John Hender, Esq. whose eldest daughter and coheiress brought it to Dr.Cotton, father of Dr. William Cotton, who was Bissiop of Exeter in 1598 : the Bissiop's grandson, Sir John Cotton, gave this estate to his sister's son, Mr. Amy. The daughter of Cotton Amy, Esq., brought a moiety of this estate to Sir Jonathan Phillipps ; after the death of Sir Jonathan and Lady Phillipps, it passed to Thomas Winflow, who took the name of Phillipps, and is now the property of his son ; the other moiety is vested in the trustees of Miss Amy (Lady Phillipps's sister), who is a lunatic. The barton of Worthyvale, having been separated from the manor, was purchased by Edward Boscawen, Esq., and was some time a hunting-seat of Lord Falmouth's : it is now a farm-house, belonging to the heirs of the late William Farnham, Esq. In the year 1204, William de Botterell had a grant of a market on Wednesdays at Talkarnec; this grant was renewed, in 1312, to Sir William Bottreaux, the market to be held at his manor of Chastell-Botterell, and a fair at the festival of St.Jamesd : the grant was again confirmed in 1398.' There is still a small market (now held on Saturday) at Boscastle, for butchers'-meat and vegetables : there are two fairs, one for lambs, on the 5th of August ; the other, which is much the largest, for ewes, on the 2 2d of November. There is a pier at Boscastle, whither small vessels come with coals, &c. In the parissi-church, which stands at a distance from any habitation, are several monuments of the families of Hender, Cotton, and Phillipps'. William of c Rot. Cl.6J0h.de Terr.

Worcester fays, that St.Mather the virgin6, or St. Maddern, patroness of the church near Penzance, which bears her name, was buried at Minster, and that extraor dinary miracles were wrought at her grave. In the town of Boscastle, near the market-place, are the remains of an old church or chapel dedicated to St.James. A record, of the year 1374, has this expression, \"Prior de Minster habet in pro prios ufus ecclesias de Minster et Boscastle :\" it seems, therefore, as if they were formerly two parissies ; and it appears, that the great tithes of both were appro priated to the priory : after the Reformation, they were annexed to the parish church of Minster, together with the manor of Pollifont in Lewannick, which had belonged to the priory. The advowson of the rectory is vested in the representatives of the Ameys, who possess the manors of Boscastle and Worthy vale, as before described. St. Minver, in the hundred of Trigg and deanery of Trigg-Minor, lies about three miles east-north-east from Padstow1\", about ten miles north-west from Bodmin, and about four from Wadebridge, where there is a post-office. The principal villages in this parissi, besides the church-town, are, Penmean, Tre betherick, Tredrisic, and Trevanger. The manor of Penmean is parcel of the ancient possessions of the duchy of Cornwall : the Black Prince gave it to Sir William Woodland, ussier of his chamber; but, on his death, without issue, it reverted to the duchy. The freewarren of this manor is held on lease by the Rev. William Sandys, who is the present incumbent and patron of the vicarage : Mr. Sandys is impropriator, also, of the great tithes, which he purchased, in 1783, of the Prideaux family, of Netherton in Devonssiire. The barton of Trevelver, successively the seat of the families of Stone, Silly, and Arundell1, is now a farm-house, the property of Mrs. Yeo, of Clifton, a descen dant of the last-mentioned family. The Stones had, in Norden's time, a lease hold seat at Trevigo, which he calls Traveygie, and describes as the lands of St.Michael-Stanhope : it is now a farm-house, the property of the Rev. Humphrey Julian. Trevernon, or Trewornan, belonged, in the reign of James I., to * In the Exeter Register, called \" Ecclesia St\u00e6.Metherian\u00e6 Virginis.\" (Borlase's Colledions.) h St-Minver is separated from Padstow by a ferry, which is held on lease, under the duchy, as parcel of the manor of Penmean. 1 The Stones were in possession in 1573, as appears from the monument of John Stone, in the parish-church.

The barton of Cant, on which is now a farm-house, was formerly the residence of the ancient family of De Cant ; and, at a latter period, of the Lynams. West-Cant was purchased of a distant relation of the late Mr. Lynam, resident in Ireland, by the Rev. William Sandys. East-Cant belonged to the Robartes family, of whom it purchased by the late Mr. Prideaux, of Place. In St.Minver church, which stands in that division of the parissi which is called the Highlands, are monuments of the families of Opie ; Rowe and Darell of Tre wornan; Stone and Silly of Trevelver ; and that of the wife of the Rev. William Sandys, the present vicar, (daughter of H. Mackworth Praed, Esq.) A handsome window of painted glass was put up in the chancel by Mr. Sandys in 1810. John Randall, Esq., who died in 1733, left ten shillings per annum for a funeral sermon, to be preached on St. John's day, 27th of December, for 1000 years; and twenty shillings per annum, to be given to poor widows and fatherless children. In that part of the parissi which is called the Lowlands, and is subdivided into north and south, are two chapels of ease, dedicated to St.Michael and St.Enodoc, called in some records St.Gwinnodock: these chapelries are not esteemed parochial, although each has a separate church-warden ; there is an overseer of the poor who serves for both. St.Enodoc, or the north chapel, is almost funk in the sands : the chapel of St. Michael is on the banks of the Pad stow river ; it is commonly called Porthilly church : Norden speaks of Porthillie as, in his time, daily increasing in population ; and observes, that if they \" con tynued paynful and religious, it would grow to be a prety town.\" The drifting of the sands has long ago depopulated this village. At Trevelver was a free chapel, of which some ruins still remain ; there were chapels also at Roserrow and Tre wornan, and another, with a spacious burying-ground, on the manor of Penmean. * See p. cii., where the family of Darell is inserted by mistake, instead of p. cxxxi, where it should have been among the extinct families. 1 We suppose this to be the Tresoro of Norden, who describes it as a seat of the Penkevils : it appears by the parish register, that that family had a seat in the parish, Many of Norden's spel lings vary as much from the real names of the places which he describes.

William Sandys. *-f There is a meeting-house in this parissi, with a cemetery belonging to the quakers, who were formerly numerous here ; it has been some time disused. A small biographical tract was publissied in 1 7o9,entitIed \"A Narrative of the Life and Sufferings of John Peters, a quaker,\" who was buried in the quakers' burying ground at St. Minver: this person was steward to the Carew family at Roserrow : there are now no quakers or other dissenters in the parissi. Trewornan-bridge, in this parissi, was built about the year 1 791, in the place of a dangerous ford, impassable at high tides, in the road leading from St.Minver to Eglossiayle, by the exertions of Mr. Sandys, and has been made a county-bridge : it is over a rivulet which separates the parishes of St. Minver and Eglossiayle ; and which, by the flux of the tides, is rendered navigable for barges as high as Amble-bridge, in the parissi of St. Kew. Morvah, in the deanery and in the west division of the hundred of Penwith, lies about seven miles west-south-west from St. Ives, and about six north-west from Penzance, which is the post-office town. The principal village in this parissi is Tregaminian. The manor of Carvolghe or Carvaghe, in the parissies of Morvah and St.Ives, was formerly in the family of Tregian : it was seized by the Crown on the attainder of Francis Tregian, granted to Cary Lord Hunsdon, repurchased by Tregian, and sold to Grosse : we cannot learn who is the proprietor of this estate. The barton of Tregaminian, which was, for several generations, in the Lanyons, and the seat of a younger branch of that family, was purchased, in the reign of Queen Anne, by John Borlase, Esq., of Pendeen : it is now a farm house, the property of the son of a descendant, of the same name. Morvah, although a separate parissi, is a daughter-church to Madron, and included in the fame presentation. There are the remains of an ancient chapel at Tregaminian, and a well called the chapel-well.

The manor of Eastway, which belonged to the priory of Launceston, was one of those annexed to the duchy of Cornwall in lieu of the honor of Wallingford in 1540. Eastway, the barton-house of this manor, is the seat of Miss C. Manning, devisee of the late James Martin, Esq., who was lessee under the duchy. The manor of Hame, in the reign of James I., belonged to Francis Glanville, Esq.': it is now the property of Joseph Sawle Graves, Esq., as devisee of Mrs.M. Sawle ; the greater part of the lands have been sold: the barton, on which is a farm-house, is the property of Mr.Bethuel Hutchings. The manor of Stanbury, which belonged in ancient times to a family of that name was the birth-place of Richard Stanbury, Bissiop of Hereford, who died in 147 1 ; the heiress of Stanbury brought it to the Mannings in the fifteenth century : after the death of John Manning in 1601, it became divided between his five aunts or their representatives ; one-tenth of the barton, and one-fifth of the other parts of this estate, belong to the Rev. John Phillipps, of Mambury in Devonssiire, representative of one of those coheiresses through the families of Withese and Barnefield : the remainder of the estate passed to the Grenville family by various purchases, and from them, together with (he manors of Lee and Woodford, in this parissi, to Lord Carteret, the present proprietor. The manor of Cross is the property of Zachary Hammett Drake, Esq., who purchased it of the family of Saunders. Stanbury is now a farm-house. The barton of Wood is the property of Mr. John Skearm. Tonacombe, formerly the seat of the family of Kempthorne alias Lea, passed with their heiress, about the latter end of the seventeenth century, to the Waddons, for whom there are some memorials in the parissi-church. Tonacombe, now a farm-house, belongs to William Waddon Martyn, Esq., nephew of John Wad don, Esq., the last heir-male of that family, who died in 1768. Lea, on the site of which is now a mean farm-house, belonging to Lord Carteret, is described by Norden as a seat of the Copplestones : the last trace we find of the family, in this parissi, is the burial of John Copplestone, Esq., in 161 1. Chapel-House is now the property and residence of Mr.Thomas Trood ; and Clease, of Mr. James Tinney, as lessee under the duchy. The church of Morwinstow was appropriated to the hospital of Bridgewater in the year 1 290.

There was formerly a chapel at Milton in this parissi, dedicated to the Virgin Mary.\" Mullion, in the deanery and in the west division of the hundred of Kirrier, lies about six miles nearly south of Helston, which is the post-office town : besides the church-town, it contains the small village of Pradannack-Wartha. The manor of Pradannack, or, as it is called in old records, Predannek, belonged formerly to the family of Serjeaux, one of whose coheiresses brought it to the Veres, Earls of Oxford. In the reign of James I., Sir Richard Robartes was seised of the manors of Pradannack-Wartha and Pradannack- Wollasp: the former now belongs to the Honourable Mrs. Agar, as representative of the Robartes family ; the latter to the Rev. Sir Carew Vyvyan, Bart. The manor of Clahar, in this parissi, belongs to Lord Viscount Falmouth. The great tithes of Mullion are appropriated to the college of vicars-choral at Exeter : the Bissiop is patron of the vicarage. At Clahar is the site of an ancient chapel, belonging to the Honourable Mrs. Agar. St. Neot, in the hundred and deanery of West, lies about five miles west north-west from Lissieard, which is the post-office town ; about eight east from Bodmin ; and the fame distance north-east from Lostwithiel. There is no village in this parissi, except the church-town, which is large. The Archdeacon's court was held at this place, till the year 1753, when it was removed to Lostwithiel, and from thence, in 1773, to Bodmin, where it is now held. There are holiday-fairs at St.Neot, on Easter Monday and the fifth of Novem ber. St. Neot lies on the old road from Bodmin to Lissieard. When the survey of Domesday was taken, there was a college at this place, then called Neotstow ; the manor of which was said to have belonged then, and in the reign of Edward the Confessor, to the canons of St.Neot. We find no account of the manor of St. Neot till within the last thirty years, in which it has had three different owners : it was sold, by the late Elias Lang, Esq., to the late Sir John Morssiead, Bart., who had also, the manor of St. Neot- Barrett, probably a divided moiety of the original manor, which had acquired the name of Barrett from its proprietors ; they now both belong to Lady Morssiead, his widow.

At a later period, the Cardinham family certainly had the manor and borough of Fowey ; and there appear to have been two manors of Faweton, both distinct from that and from each other, and probably both within the parissi of St.Neot, as one of them is still known to be. There was, in the reign of Henry III., a manor of Faweton, which belonged to Andrew de Suleny, on whose death, without issue, it devolved to his uncle Jeffery ; and he dying without issue, it was inherited by his sisters in moieties : one moiety passed by marriage to the Treverbyns ; the other, by a succession of female-heirs, as far as the reign of Henry V., to the families of Champernowne, Willington, and Wroth q. Sir Reginald Mohun died seised of a manor of Fawton in 1620'. We have not been able to trace this manor any lower ; there are three small tenements of the name in St.Neot, two of which were lately sold by E. J. Glynn, Esq.s; the other belongs to Thomas Bewes, Esq. The manor of Faweton, alias Trenay, belonged to the Daubeny family from the reign of Edward I. (if not earlier) to that of Henry VIII., when Sir Giles Daubeny sold it to John Tubb, of whose son George it \"was purchased by William Bere, Esq.\" The coheiresses of Bere married Sir John Grylls, of Court in Lanreath, and Bellott of Bochym. The Rev. Richard Gerveys Grylls possesses a moiety of this manor by inheritance, and has purchased the other moiety, which had been some time in severalties : the moieties were divided by deed in the year 1722. The manor of Polruan :.i Lantegloss, now the property of William Rassi leigh, Esq. M. P., was formerly held with this manor. The bailiffry of the hundred of West\" is annexed to the manor of Faweton, alias Trenay. The barton of Trenay was sold by the Tubbs to Connock ; we understand there are three Trenays ; Great and Little Trenay, united in one tenement, the property of Francis Gregor, Esq. ; and Higher Trenay belonging to Thomas Bewes, Esq.

A more ancient record, as printed in Blount's Tenures, assigns the service of providing the cloak to the lord of Cabilia, and that of carrying it to the lord of Pengelly. The manor of Trevegoe was in moieties, in the reign of James I. ; one moiety, which had been purchased by Hodge, belonged then to Matthew Veale ; the other, which had been in the Hungerfords, had been forfeited by attainder, and granted to Arundell, was then, by purchase from I,ayton, in the family of Bagott 3 : this manor now belongs to Lady Morssiead. The manor of Treverbyn, which belonged to the Courtenays of Trethurfe, appears to have been dismembered : the Earl of Cork, who represents one of the coheiresses of Courtenay, possesses a small tenement of that name. The manor of Cabilia, Cabilia, or Carburrow, the property of the Honourable Mrs. Agar, (the barton of which is in Cardinham,) extends over a considerable part of this parissi.

In the parissi-church are considerable remains of painted glass, containing the legends of St.Neot and other saints, as hath been already described. It is said by some of the Monkish historians, that this church was originally dedicated to St.Guevor or Guerrier, and subsequently to St.Neot, who, for many years, had led a hermit's life, and died and was buried at this place. The great tithes of this parissi were formerly appropriated to the priory of Montacuteb, in the county of Somerset : they are now, with some exceptions, the property of the Rev. R. G. Grylls, who is patron and the present incumbent of the vicarage. The tithe sheaf of the manor of St.Neot-Barrett is appropriated to the repairs of the church. Two-thirds of the great and small tithes of two of the Fawtons, and some other farms, (which tithes now belong to the Duke of Bedford, and Thomas Bewes, Efq.c,) were appropriated in former times to the repair of Launceston castle.

Newlyn, in the hundred and deanery of Pyder, lies about seven miles south west from St. Columb, and about eight north from Truro, which is the post-office town. Part of the borough and decayed market- town of Michel is in this parissi, the remainder in St.Enodor.J The manor of Newlyn, which belonged to the Arundells of Lanherne, has recently been sold by Lord Arundell to Lady Clifford. The manor of Cargaul or Cargol, in this parissi, belonged, when the survey of Domesday was taken, to the priory of Bodmin, and is supposed to have been one of those which the Bissiop of Exeter is said to have taken from that monastery, since it is known to have belonged to the see of Exeter in the reign of Edward 11/: the bissiops had a palace here, of which there were considerable remains when Tonkin collected his materials, about the year 1736; and he speaks of the prison as then remaining, although not much used. The manor of Cargol was formerly on lease to the family of Borlase : Humphrey Borlase, of Cargol, who is said to have been created Baron Michell by King James II., after his abdication, having died in distressed circumstances, this leasehold manor was sold to Mr. Philip Hawkins, ancestor of Sir Christopher Hawkins, Bart., the present lessee under the Bissiop. In the year 13 12 the Bissiop of Exeter procured a grant for a Thursday's market in the manor of Cargol, and a fair at the festival of St. Matthew f : there are now two fairs held annually on this estate; on the first Tuesday in October, (a fair of rather modern date,) and November 8. The manor and barton of Treluddra or Treluddero, formerly the property and seat of an ancient family of that name, passed, by marriage, about the latter end of Henry the Eighth's reign, to a younger branch of the Borlases : after the death of Humphrey Borlase above-mentioned, this estate was sold to Sir William Scawen, of whose family it was purchased by Sir Francis Bassett, Bart, (now Lord de Dunstanville), and by him sold to Sir Christopher Hawkins, Bart., the present proprietor : the old park at Treluddero has been long disparked.

Sir John Arundell of Trerice, who was ssieriff of Cornwall ioEdw. IV., lost his life in an attack on St.Michael's Mount, then occupied against the King by the Earl of Oxford. It is said that he removed his residence from another seat, at Efford, on the north coast of Cornwall, near Stratton, to Trerice, because it had been foretold that he ssiould die on the sands ; which prophecy was accomplissied by his receiving his death's-wound on the sands between Marazion and the Mount. This Sir John Arundell was Vice-Admiral of Cornwall in the reign of Henry VI. John Arundell of Trerice, in the year 1522, distinguissied himself by the capture of Duncan Campbell, a celebrated Scottissi pirate, after a ssiarp engagement. The letter of thanks, written by the Duke of Norfolk, pursuant to the King's com mand, was printed by Mr. Carew in his History of Cornwall : the fame John, being then a knight, was Vice- Admiral of Cornwall in 1553. John Arundell of of Trerice, Carew's contemporary, known better by the name of \" Old Tilbury,\" and \" John for the King,\" lived to a great age ; and when upwards of fourscore defended Pendennis-castle against the parliamentary forces to the last extremity: his son, Sir Richard, an active officer in the Royal army, who had distinguissied himself at Edghill and Lansdowne, and several other battles and sieges, during the civil war, and afterwards suffered considerably in his fortune by sequestration, &c. was, in 1664, created Lord Arundell of Trerice : his grandson, the fourth and last Lord Arundell of this family, who died in 1773, upon his marriage with a sister of Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford, settled all his lands, in default of issue, on her nephew, William Wentworth, Esq., of Hembury in Dorsetssiire, with remainder to Sir Thomas Acland, Bart., and his heirs. Mr. Wentworth, who succeeded to the estates under this settlement, levied a fine, and settled this manor and the other Arundell estates on his son Frederick Thomas (afterwards Earl of Strafford), with remainder, on failure of issue, to his daughter, who married into the family of Kaye, of Woodsome in Yorkssiire, and on failure of issue from both, (which was the event,) to Sir Thomas Acland, Bart. The manor of Trerice, and the other estates so settled, are now the property of Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, Bart., grandson of Sir Thomas, named in the settlement. The old mansion, built in 1572, is occupied by the tenant of the demesne, but occasionally visited by its owner.

The barton of Tresilian, which had been mortgaged to the family of Davies, was after wards sold to that of Gully : it is now the property and occasional residence of Bennet, a minor. The site of the ancient manor of Cragantallan, which came to the Arundells with the heiress of Durant, is not known : it merged into the other manors belonging to the Arundells, and passed with them to Sir Thomas Dyke Acland. The manor of Nancolla, in this parissi, belongs to Lord Viscount Falmouth. The manor of Trevarthian was the property and seat of the ancient family of Trevarthian or Treverden, whose heiress brought it to the Ressiymers. In the early part of the last century it was in the family of Wills, of Wivelseomb near Saltassi, in which it continued for several generations : it is not now known as a manor : the barton is the property of Bennet of Tresilian : the house is occupied by a farmer. The barton of Pollamounter, in the manor of Degembris, formerly the property and residence of the Pollamounter family, who removed thence to Trevithic in St.Columb, is now a farm-house, held by lease under Sir Thomas Dyke Acland. In the parissi-church of Newlyn is a marble monument, ornamented with her bust, in memory of Margaret, the lady of John Lord Arundell, of Trerice, who died in 1691.

Landreyne was purchased, under the powers of the land-tax redemption act, in 1799, by the late Francis Rodd,Esq., whose son, Francis Hearle Rodd, Esq., is now lord of that manor, and of Trebartha, Treveniel, Tolcarne, Tremollet, and Trewithy, all in this parissi. Mr. Polwhele1 speaks of Walter Reynell as having been lord of the manor of Trebartha in the reign of Richard I., on the authority of a manuscript in the British Museum : it was at a later period the property and seat of an ancient family, who took their name from the place of their abode, and became extinct in the male line in the reign of Henry VII., when their heiress brought this estate to the Spoures : the last-mentioned family became extinct in the year 1729.

The manor of Tolcarne or Talkarne was formerly the seat and property of a family of that name, from whom it passed, by marriage, to George Kekewich, Esq., of Shropssiire : in or about the year 1630, it was purchased of John Kekewich, Esq., of Catchfrench, by Richard Spoure, Esq.

The manor of Otterham appears to have belonged, in the reign of Edward III., to the Champernownesp: in 1457 it was settled upon Thomas Bonville, and Lena his wife, for life, with remainder to Philip Copleston, and Anne his wife, and the heirs of the said Anne, remainder to John Wybbery, Esq., in fee1. John Saltern, yeoman, died seised of the manor and advowson in 1 639 : we find that the patronage of the rectory continued in the same family in 1736: the manor is now vested in George Welch Owen, Esq. Mr. William Chilcott, of Tiverton, is patron of the rectory. The barton of Small-hill, some time the property and residence of the family of French, is now a farm, belonging to Charles Chichester, Esq. Padstow, in the hundred and deanery of Pyder, is an ancient market-town, situated at the mouth of the Alan or Camel, on the north coast, 14 miles from Bodmin, and 243 from London. The name of Padstow is said to have been a corruption of Petrockstow. Leland says, that it was anciently called Adelstowe, from Athelstan, and in the Cornissi language, Lodenek. In Pope Nicholas's Valor it is written Aldestowe, which, as the termination is evidently Saxon, is more likely to be a corruption of Ealde-stowe : it does not appear that Athelstan had ever any connexion with Padstow. St. Petrock is said to have landed at this place, and the church is dedicated to him: the monastery of St. Petrock, which was destroyed by the Danes in 981, and afterwards establissied at Bodmin, is, by Mr.Whitaker, with much reason supposed to have been at Padstow, where Mr. Prideaux Brune's house now stands ; its name of 0 Borlase's Collections from the Registers of the see of Exeter. f Carew's Survey, f. 40. \" Esch. 1 Edw.

Hals speaks of a nunnery at Credis, in this parissi, which was a cell to the monastery of St. Bennet in Lanivet : there are now no remains of buildings, but the supposed site belongs to the poor of Lanivet. The town of Padstow has a market on Saturdays, by prescription, for butcher's meat and other provisions : we find no record relating to it. There are two fairs, (April 18, and September 21,) now little more than holiday-fairs ; but within these fifty years well supplied with cattle, cloth, hats, &c. &c. Leland, speaking of this town, fays, \u2014 \" There use many Britons with sinaul ssiippes to resorte to Padestowe, with commodities of their countrey, and to by fische : the towne of Padestow is ful of Irisch men : there is a large exporte of corne.\" Carew, speaking of Padstow, says, \u2014 \"It hath lately purchased a corporation, and reapeth greatest thrift by traffiking with Ireland, for which it commodioufly lieth.\" We have not been able to learn any thing about the charter of corporation alluded to by Carew, and are assured that the town has no such charter. The principal import-trade of Padstow is for iron, chiefly from Cardiff; coals from Wales; timber from Norway ; and groceries and bale goods from Bristol : considerable quantities of corn are still exported ; the other principal exports are malt and block-tin. The Dummer-bank, a dangerous quick-sand, lies off the parissi of Padstow. The town and parissi of Padstow contained, in 1801, 201 houses, and 1,332 inhabitants; in 181 1, 220 houses, and 1,498 inhabitants : the principal villages in the parissi are, Crugmeer, Treviscar, and Trevone. The manor of Padstow belonged to the priory of Bodmin, under whom it had been held on lease by the Prideaux family, some time before the Refor mation : in 1 544 it was granted to John Pope, a trustee, probably, for the Prideaux family, who have ever since possessed it, the present owner being the Rev. Charles Prideaux Brune, who took the latter name on succeeding to considerable pro perty in Dorsetssiirer. Place-house, the seat of Mr. Brune, which overlooks the town and haven, was built about the year 1600 ; Carew, whose survey was printed in 1602, calls it a new and stately house: in the court before the house is a hedge of myrtles, and another of tamarissis. The manor of Padstow-Penkevil, so called, it is probable, from having belonged formerly to the Penkevils, was at a later period in the family of Robartes, Earl of Radnor, and is now the property of the Rev. Charles Prideaux Brune. ' See p. cxii.

Mr. Rawlings has lately built a handsome house for his own residence, on the south of Padstow town, commanding a fine view of the harbour. The barton of Trenear or Trenarran was for some time the seat of the Peters, afterwards of Treator, which last is now the property and residence of Mr.Charles Peter : the elder branch removed to Harlyn in St.Merryn. In the parissi-church of Padstow are monuments of the Prideaux family : that of Sir Nicholas Prideaux, Knt., who was Carew's contemporary, and died in 1627, commemorates also Sir William Morice, who married a daughter of Humphrey Prideaux; \" he was knighted,\" fays his epitaph, \" by King Charles II., on his landing at Dover, and afterwards made secretary of state and a privy counsellor, in consequence of his great services in bringing about the Restoration, by his influence with General Monk.

St. Paul, commonly called Paul, in the deanery and west division of the hundred of Penwith, lies on the western point of Mount's-bay : the church stands on high ground, being about a mile and three-quarters (three miles by the road) south-south-west from Penzance, which is the post-office town. The principal villages in this parissi are Mousehole and Newlyn, both upon the sea-coast and numerously inhabited by fissiermen. The pilchard and mackarel fissieries are carried on at these places to a great extent : fissi of every kind which frequent this coast, are sent in abundance from Mousehole and Newlyn to Penzance, and most of the Cornissi towns : the London market, in the early part of the season is chiefly supplied from Newlyn and Mousehole with mackarel, which is sent by way of Portsmouth. Mousehole, otherwise called Port-Enys, was formerly a market-town : the charter for a market on Tuesdays, with a fair for three days at the festival of St.Barnabas, was granted to Henry de Tyes, in 1292\": the market was confirmed in 131? to Alice de Lisle, with a fair for seven days, at the festival of St.Bartholomeww: it is said that there has been no market at Mousehole since this place, and the neighbouring village of Newlyn, were burnt by the Spaniards in 1595, as before mentioned \\ A new quay was constructed at Mousehole in or about the year 1392''; it was formerly a port of considerable trade: the manor of Mousehole, which passed with Alwarton% belongs to the heirs of George Veale, Esq., and to James Hals, Esq., of St.Ives.

It is probable that the barton of Kerris had formerly manerial rights ; for it appears that the manor of Keres, in Cornwall, and we find no other place of the name, was granted to John Duke of Norfolk, in 1483 : this barton, on which are now several farm-houses, was some time a seat of the Chivertons, and afterwards successively of the families of Hext, Pearce, and Blewett. The manors of Kymyell or Kimiel and Butsava belong to Sir John St.Aubyn, Bart., whose ancestors possessed them for many generations. Kimiel- Wartha was the seat of the Kimiel family, whose heiress married St.Aubyn : it is now a farmhouse. Kimiel-Crease or Greaze, and Kimiel-Drea, now farm-houses, were both seats of the Keigwins : Jenkin Keigwin, of this family, was killed by the Spaniards in 1595 : the entry of his burial is the first which occurs in the present parissi register ; the earlier registers having been destroyed when the invaders set fire to St. Paul's church3. Treungle, now a farm-house, was the seat of Arthur Hitchens, Esq.: Captain Cluterburg, some time governor of the castle at the Scilly islands, built a house at Treungle, now belonging to the Badcocks, de scended in the female line from the Keigwins. In the parissi-church of St. Paul, said to have been dedicated to St.Paulinus, Bissiop of Rochester, is the following curious notice of its having been burnt by the Spaniards as before-mentioned : \" The Spunger burnt this church in the year I598b.\" There is a monument in this church for William Godolphin, Esq., of Trewarveneth, the last of the family.

There were formerly chapels of ease at Mousehole and Newlyn : Mousehole chapel, which had been a sea-mark, was destroyed by the encroachments of the ocean before the year 141 4, when Bissiop Stafford wrote a circular letter, exhorting the inhabitants of his diocese to contribute towards its rebuilding : it is probable that it was then rebuilt, and again destroyed when the town was burnt by the Spaniards. Two other chapels are said to have been in or near the town: unquestionably there was a chapel dedicated to St. Clement, on a little island opposite Mousehole, which still bears that name : Leland meations this chapel as existing in 1 540. Captain Stephen Hitchens, of the Royal navy, who acquired a considerable fortune by cruising on the Jamaica station, and died at Jamaica in 1709, bequeathed the sum of 600I. for the purpose of building and endowing an alms house for six poor men, and the same number of women : the lands then pur chased, after defraying the expence of building, now produce nearly 70I. per annum : the management of this charity is vested in 1 4 trustees. Pelynt or Plynt, in the hundred and deanery of West, lies about two miles nearly north from Polperro ; about three nearly west-north-west from Looe ; and about eight south-south-west from Lissieard, which is the principal post-office town of the neighbourhood ; but there is a bye-post to Polperro. The manor of Pelyn, which at the time of taking the Domesday survey was held under the Earl of Cornwall by Algar, was given, in the year 1 248, by the executors of Giles de Cancellis or Chanceaux, together with the advowson of the church, to the abbot and convent of Neweham in Devonssiire, who, in 1356, had a grant of a fair in this manor for three days at the festival of the Nativity of St.John the Baptist0; this is still held as a cattle-fair on Midsummer-day. The manor is now the property of Frederick William Busier, Esq., colonel in the Coldstream regiment of guards, whose family possessed it considerably more than a century : it is probable that they inherited it from the Trethurfes. The manor of Tregarrick, which belonged to the Winflades, was forfeited by the attainder of John Winflade, Esq., who suffered death for being one of the ringleaders of the Cornissi rebellion, in 1549: it was granted by King Edward IV. to Sir Reginald Mohun, and purchased of him, in the succeeding reign, by John Rot.

The manor of Trelawne or Trelawny belonged, at an early period, to the Bod'rugans : Sir Henry de Bodrugan gave it, as a marriage-portion, with his daughter, to Henry Champernowne. The heiress of this branch of Champer nowne, married Polglass ; and the heiress of Polglass, Herle. Sir John Herle the younger, who died without issue, settled the reversion of Trelawny on Sir William, afterwards Lord Bonville, the last of an ancient Devonssiire family : it was a remarkable circumstance attending this family, that the havoc of civil war annihilated three generations within the space of two months. At the battle of Wakefield, Lord Bonville witnessed the death of his son Sir William Bonville, and of his grandson William Lord Harington, who enjoyed that title as having married the heiress of Lord Harington, of Harington ; this was on the last day of December 1460; in the month of February following, the aged grandfather was taken prisoner at the second battle of St.Albans ; and, although his life had been promised, he was beheaded by order of the Queen, who bore resentment against him, as having been one of those who had the custody of the King's person after the battle of Northampton. Elizabeth Lady Harington, upon the accession of Edward IV., had a large dower assigned her out of Lord Bonville's estates in Cornwall : her only daughter, by Bonville, brought Trelawny and other estates to Thomas Grey, Marquis of Dorset, on the attainder of whose grandson, Henry, Duke of Suffolk, they were seized by the crown.

Sir Harry Trelawny, Bart. Lord Bonville built a castellated mansion at Trelawny, a part of which, with two towers, remains on the eastern side of the present house. Sir Jonathan Trelawny nearly rebuilt the house soon after his purchase of the estate : it was again nearly rebuilt by Edward Trelawny, Esq., Governor of Jamaica, after a fire which happened about the middle of the last century. There are several family-portraits at Trelawny-house, among which are two of Sir Jonathan Trelawny, Bart., Bissiop of Winchester, one of the prelates who were committed to the Tower for their steady defence of the Protestant religion, in the reign of James II. ; one of them is by Sir Godfrey Kneller. The gateway at Trelawny was some time the residence of General Trelawny, brother of the Bissiop, a distinguissied officer in the reigns of Charles II. and King William. A chapel was built at Trelawny, by Bissiop Trelawny, on the site of one of more ancient date. The manor of Muchlarnic was purchased in 1674, by Sir Jonathan Trelawny, of the Achyms, and is now the property of the Rev. Sir H.

Part of Perran-Wharf, or Perran-Cove, is in this parissi. There is an arsenic manufactory in this parissi. The manor of Perran-Arwothall, which includes two-thirds of the parissi, belonged to the ancient family of Fitz-William, whose heiress brought it to the Mohuns : Sir Reginald Mohun, in the reign of James I., sold it to Samuel Pen darves, Esq., of Roscrow ; it is now, by inheritance from the Pendarves family, the property of the Right Honourable Lord De Dunstanville. The ancient family of Daungers had a house and estate in this parissi, which passed by marriage to the Bonithons ; probably this was the manor of Bessow, Bizza, or Bissoe, now the property of Peter Hill, Esq.

A fair is held some years at Millingy, and others at a place called Penhallow, in this parissi, on Easter Tuesday, now little more than a holiday fair. The tolls are taken by the church-wardens, or those to whom they are let by them at a small annual rent. At Perran-Porth, where a considerable stream, which runs through Millingy, falls into the sea, is a fine sandy beach, frequented as a bathing-place by the neighbouring gentry, who procure lodgings in the cottages on the beach. The western part of this parissi is very populous, being inhabited by miners, who live in detached cottages, which are thickly sprinkled over the barren commons. The manor or honor of St. Piran m, now destroyed by the sands, belonged to a college of canons, by whom it was held free of all taxes in the reign of Edward the Confessor, as appears by the survey of Domesday : it is said to have been, at a latter period, the property and seat of the family of St. Piran, from whom it passed by successive female-heirs to the Kendalls and Vincents\".

The manor of Ty warnhaile, being a moiety of the ancient manor of that name, was granted, in 1337, to Edward the Black Prince, and by him soon afterwards given to Sir Walter de Woodland, ussier of his chamber, who died without issue0 : this manor was afterwards annexed to the duchy of Cornwall, and so continued till the year 1798, when it was purchased, under the powers of the land-tax redemption act, by John Thomas, Esq., of Chiverton, except the mines and wrecks of the sea, which were reserved to the duchy ; the tenants of this manor were of four sorts, as stated in a record of 1337, viz. freeholders, who paid a certain rent and fealty and suit at the lord's court ; free conventioners, who held for seven years in free conventionary ; native conventioners, who held also for seven years ; and natives, who held in villenage, the younger son inheriting : Ty warnhaile barton is occupied as a farm. In an ancient deed, without datep, Henry Le Tyes is called lord of a moiety of the manor of Tywarnhaile ; this formed the manor of Tywarnhaile-Tyes, which descended to the Rutland family : Henry Earl of Rutland, in the year 1561, sold the manor, with the toll-tin, to Pascall Kerne and Richard John; not long after wards, three-fourths of the manor became the property of the Carews ; the remaining fourth, of the Carters of St. Columb, whose heirs still possess two-thirds of this fourth', the other third having been sold to Mr.Prout of St.Agnes; the other three-fourths were vested in the late Mr.Donnithorne, whose ancestor purchased of the Carews. , The manor of Lambourn, held under Tywarnhaile, belonged to the Lambourns as early as the reign of Henry III. : Amara, daughter and heiress of William Lambourn, in the reign of Henry V., married Sir John Arundell of Lanherne, who gave it to his third son Sir Renfrey : Elizabeth, his daughter (and eventually heiress, her brother having lest an only son, who died without issue), married Thomas Whittington, and after his death Edward Stradling ; having a son by the former, and a daughter by the latter, ssie divided her large inheritance between them : the daughter married Sir John Danvers, Knt.

Reenwartha, some time a seat of the family of Haweis, is now a farm-house, the property and residence of Mrs. Jenkins : it is near Perran-Porth, and affords the accommoda tion of lodgings to families who occasionally resort to the coast for sea-air and bathing. This parissi is said to have been the residence and burial-place of St. Piran, the patron of the tinners, of whom the legend, as given by Hals, is, that \" he swam over from Ireland on a mill-stone, and lived 200 years after his emigration :\" but this differs from Capgrave's account, who fays nothing of the mill-stone ; his story is, that \" after having lived to the age of 200 years and upwards, and 9 finding"], [644, "CORNWALL. 264 finding his health declining, he determined to end his days in Cornwall.\" The two preceding parissies take their name from the fame faint. \" This parish,\" as Carew observes, \" but too well brooketh his surname in Sabulo, for the light sand carried up by the north wind from the sea-ssiore, daily continueth his covering and marring the land adjoynant, so as the distresse of this deluge drave the inhabitants to remoove their church : howbeit when it meeteth with any crossing brooke, the fame (by a secret antipathy) restraineth and barreth his farder incroching that way.\" It was, probably, in consequence of this notion, that the inhabitants, thinking such situation secure, removed their church only about 300 yards, it being on the opposite side of a brook : in the old church was the ssirine of St. Piran, in which his relics were carefully preserved : there was a great resort of pilgrims to make oblations at this ssirine, as appears by a deed in the registry of the see of Exeter, bearing date 1485. The brook above-mentioned, having been dried up by the adits made from time to time for the purpose of working the mines, the new church lost all the protection it could have derived from it ; and Borlase, in a MS. account of an excursion in 1755, speaks of it \" as being then in no little danger, the sands being spread all around it :\" it stood among the sand-hills, with only a solitary cottage near it, half buried in sand, and the porch frequently so blocked up, that it was difficult to obtain entrance ; it was determined, therefore, about ten years ago, to build a new church near the village of Lambourn, and the centre of the parissi : thither the pillars and the font, which appear to have belonged to the original church, were removed, and the new church was consecrated by Dr. Fissier, then Bissiop of Exeter, in 1805. When we visited Perran-Zabuloe in that year, the former church, which had been unroofed, was nearly filled with sand.

Near Tywarnhaile-house is a small island, on which was an ancient chapel, called Chapel-Engarder ; the ruins of it remained in 1733. There were chapels also at Callestock-Veor ; Callestock-Rual ; near Bethaw-hall ; at Lambourn, dedicated to St. Edmund ; near Perran-Porth ; and Chapel- Widdan, near St.Piran's Well : the tradition is, that most of these were oratories, in which St. Piran celebrated divine service. St.Piran's Well is on a tenement called Caer or Carn-kief, near Lambourn, which belonged to the Dean and Chapter of Exeter ; it has been lately purchased by John Thomas, Esq., under the powers of the land tax redemption act : this well, which is enclosed by an ancient stone-building, was formerly much resorted to as a cure for the rickets.

'Tis an oblong hill, with two batteries raised on its eminence, capable of containing near 4000 men, the number of the parliamentary army, drawn up in close battalions. I thought Lord Clarendon the exactest of writers, till I reviewed the idea he had of this battle, and the place 'twas fought on, but ex pede Herculem. \" The front of this oblong hill lay due west, defended with a straight lane, about 400 paces long, which served for a breast-work. The south and north parts were two (harp angles ; but front and anyles were all ascended to by a moderately gradual ascent. As it happened, so the attack fell iudicioufly and naturally in four places, as I think the historian tells us ; twice, perhaps, in the front, and at each angle, north and south. (I learnt from tradition, that two small parties marched in a semicircle, and made an attack unexpectedly at the angles.) You would think by Clarendon, an attack was made on the east side ; but that was impracticable, being exceedingly steep ; skirted with wood, a rivulet, and morass at bottom. \" The error in the parliament-general was, lying open at too many places, not having ground enough to rectify any mistake, and the impracticability of retreating ; for the troops must tumble one over another, and no art could re-collect them.\" _ Reginald"], [650, "CORNWALL. 270 Reginald Earl os Cornwall to William Botterell or Bottreaux, in or about the reign of Henry II., passed, by successive female heirs, to the families of Hunger ford and Hastings : it was purchased of one of the Earls of Huntingdon by the Grenville family, and having passed with the Kilkhampton estate, is now the pro perty of Lord Carteret.

Two markets at this place, on Tuesday and Saturday, were granted in 1332 to William Basset, together with two fairs, each for four days, at Michaelmas and at the festival of St. Peter ad vincula. In 1502, John Basset, Esq., of Tehidy, then Lord of Redruth, had a grant of a weekly market at Redruth, and three fairs, April 21, July 23, and October 1. The markets were for a long time discontinued, and only the fairs kept-. In Oliver Cromwell's time, Mr. Busier, of Morvall, procured a charter for a market on Fridays, which is said to have been confirmed by King Charles II. Mr. Tonkin observes, that the market was continued in his time, and enjoyed by the Busier family. There are now two weekly markets held on Wednesdays and Fridays : the latter, being the most considerable, is a great corn-market ; Tonkin speaks of it as being, in his time, the best in the west of England. There are now three fairs ; May 2, August 3, and October 1 2 ; chiefly for cattle, and osier manufactures. The two former, and the markets, are the property of James Busier, Esq., M.P. ; the other, com monly called Roast-goose-fair, belongs to Lord De Dunstanville. Redruth, in consequence of its situation, in the midst of the mining-district, has greatly increased in population. Its principal increase has been during the last century, since the working of the copper-mines, it having been in the proportion of at least six to one, as appears by the average of baptisms. The number of inhabitants in 1801, was 4,924; in 1811, 5,903, according to the returns made to parliament at those periods. The principal villages in the parissi of Redruth are, Plaingwary and Redruth-Highway : the former was, as its name denotes, the playing-place, and there are still the remains of one of those rounds, in which the ancient plays were performed. Lord De Dunstanville claims right of freewarren over the parissi, as apper tenant to his manor of Tehidy. The manor of Tolgoose or Tolgus belonged successively to the Wolvedons and Tregians ; and having passed with the Golden estate, is now the property of James Busier, Esq., M. P., who has also the manor of Treworgie in this parissi. The barton of Tolgoose, which was some time the seat of the family of Renfrey, and passed by marriage to that of Hussey, is now a farm-house : this barton has produced vast quantities of tin and copper. The manor of Treleigh belonged also to the Tregians, and, at a later period, to the Eriseys, of whom it was purchased by the last of the ancient family of Pollard, who had long inhabited the barton, and became extinct in 1731. The manor and barton (on which is now a farm-house) were afterwards purchased of their representatives by Mr. Edward Moore, and are now vested in the 1 1 . coheiresses"], [657, "CORNWALL. 277 coheiresses of his descendant, the late John Moore Knighton, Esq/ The manor of Treruff has long been in the Trefusis family, and is now the property of Lord Clinton. The manor of Trefula, one of the estates which passed, by successive female heirs, from the family of Hiwis, to those of Colessiill, Arundell, and Whittington, was divided into severalties among the coheirs of the latter. One of the coheiresses of Whittington married an ancestor of Sir John St.Aubyn, Bart., who now possesses a fifth and a sixtieth part of this estate : the remainder is the property of John Scorrier, Esq. The barton-house of Nether-Trefula, now in ruins, was some time the residence of the family of Haweis, to whom the greater part of the barton belonged. Treworkie, some time a seat of the Howells, after wards of the family of Haweis, and still the property of the latter, is in the occupation of Mr. 'William Jenkin. The parissi-church, dedicated to St.Uny, is situated nearly half a mile from the town: it was rebuilt about the year 1770: Lord de Dunstanville is patron of the rectory ; the advowson of which has been, from time immemorial, annexed to the manor of Tehidy. There are the remains of a chapel in the town, near the road, dedicated to St.Rumon. Mr.Tonkin fays, that it was unroofed in his time, but that divine service had been performed in it within the memory of persons then living. There are meeting-houses at Redruth for the quakers and anabaptists ; the methodists have two in the town, and a third in the north part of the parissi. A large school-house was built by subscription at Redruth, in the year 1803 ; and a salary raised by the same means for a master to teach Latin, arithmetic, &c. ; but the subscription having been discontinued, the school was afterwards kept open by the master on his own account. There is a Sunday-school for about 150 boys and girls, attended by gratuitous teachers. Roche, more frequently but improperly now written Roach, lies in the deanery and in the east division of the hundred of Powder, five miles nearly east south-east from St.Columb, which is the post-office town ; the fame distance north north-west from St.Austell, and six and a half south-west from Bodmin. The principal villages, exclusively of the church-town, are, Belovely and Tregoss. The manor of Tregarrick is said to have belonged to the family of De Rupe, or De la Roche, which became extinct in 1357: it is said that the heiress ' Mr.Knighton left three daughters, coheiresses, one of whom is unmarried ; the others married Georee Drake, Esq., and Captain Chadwick. , 6 married"], [658, "CORNWALL. 278 married Blundell, who took the name of Roche ; the descendant of this family, in the reign of Henry VIII., left four daughters coheiresses, three of whom marrried into the families of Fortefcue, Penkevil, and Boscawen : this manor having been inherited by the latter, is now the property of Lord Viscount Fal mouth. The manor of Tremoderet, in this parissi, belonged also, at an early period, to the family of De la Roche5, afterwards to the Bodrugans : after the attainder of Sir Henry Bodrugan, it was granted by King Henry VII. to Sir Richard Edgcumbe, ancestor of the Earl of Mount-Edgcumbe, who is the present proprietor. The advowson, which in 1620 was in moieties between the families of Arundell and Kendall', is now vested in trustees, under the will of the late John Thornton, Esq., of Clapham. The parissi-church is said to have been dedi cated to St.Gomonda : the name of the parissi is sometimes improperly written St. Roche ; whereas it was called Roche long before the only faint in the Calendar of that name was born\" ; and no doubt was so denominated from the remarkable rock (already described), which is situated about a quarter of a mile south-east from the church : on this rock, are the ruins of a small chapel dedicated to St.Michael.

It seems not improbable that the market at Shepestall, granted to John Arcedekne in 1335% was in this parissi : Thomas Arcedekne, when summoned to parliament in the reign of Edward I., was described as of Shepestall. We have not been able to find any place so called ,in the county ; the circumstance of the ancient property and residence of the Arcedeknes being in this parissi, and of there being a field adjoining to this parissi, called Little Shepestall, renders it probable, that though the name has been long 5 Deed of the year 1259, among the Arundell papers. 1 Extent.

William of Worcester speaks of it as standing, in his Itinerary of Cornwall, temp. Edward IV. A coheiress of Arce dekne married Lucy ; and the coheiresses of Sir William Lucy married into the families of Corbett and Vaux. One moiety of the manor of Lanihorne, being described as lately parcel of the possessions of Sir William Vaux attainted, was granted in 1462 to Avery Cornburgh2 : this moiety passed by purchase to the Tregians, and in 1620 belonged to Ezekiel Grosse ; the other moiety was then vested in Sir Henry Wallop, Knt. The manors of Lanihorne and Ellerkey now belong to Francis Gregor, Esq., of Trewarthenick, by purchase from Sir William Molefworth. They were formerly held under the honor of Launceston, by the annual render of a brace of grey-hounds\". There are now no remains of Lani horne castle : Leland describes it \" as a castelle of an eight towers, then decaying for lak of coverture.\" Tonkin describes a large tower, which was pulled down in 1718 ; and fays, that within 30 year6 of the time of his writing, six out of eight towers of the castle had been standing : some cottages have been built on the site. The learned John Whitaker, B.D., who is well known in the literary world as the author of \" The History of Manchester,\" the \" Defence of Mary Queen of Scots,\" and other esteemed works, was about 30 years the resident rector of Ruan- Lanihorne, died there in the 73d year of his age, November 4th, 1808, and lies buried within the rails of the communion-table. The manor of Ardevora extends over part of this parissi. The barton of Trelonk is held on lease by Mr. John Brown, under Sir William Lemon, Bart.

The church of Ruan-Major, described as in Tyrath, belonged to the Car minows, from whom it passed, by successive female heirs, to the Treverbins and Ressiymers. The patronage of the rectory is now vested in the Rev. William Robinson, in whose family it has been for a considerable time. There are the remains of an ancient chapel about the centre of the parissi. Ruan-Minor, in the deanery and in the west division of the hundred of Kirrier, lies about 1 o miles nearly south-south-east from Helston, which is the post-office town. The principal village in this parissi is Cadgwith, a populous fissiing-cove. The manor of Tretheves, Lucies, and Rosswick, chiefly in this parissi and Grade, was, in ancient times, in the Carminows : on the partition between the coheiresses of Carminow, it was allotted to Trevarthian, whose heiress brought it to the Ressiy mers: John Ressiymer was in possession in 1620: it was afterwards in the Bellots, of whom it was purchased in 1704 by the Robinsons: having been alienated by the latter to the late Mr. Fonnereau, it was purchased of him, about the year 1780, by Sir Christopher Hawkins, Bart., who is the present proprietor. The Robinsons had a seat at Cadgwith. The advowson of the rectory, which had before passed with the manor above-mentioned, was retained by the Robin sons, and still belongs to that family. The Rev. Thomas Robinson, rector of this parissi, author of \" Reasons for the Belief of a Christian,\" and other works, died in the month of April 1814. The rector of this parissi, by ancient usage and prescription, claims a right (which always is admitted) of sending a horse into a certain field, in the parissi of Landewednack, whenever it is cropped with corn, and taking away as many sheaves as the horse can carry on his back.

Pencoite, or Penquit, was the seat of a family of that name, afterwards of the Barrets, whose heiress brought it to the Prestwoods : the last mentioned family possessed it as late as the year 1734 : it is now the seat of Thomas Graham, Esq., being held on lease under the Rassileighs, who purchased of Prestwood. Great- Torfrey, some time a seat of the family of Couch, was purchased of them, in 1804, by Mr. Sleman, the present proprietor and occupier. This parissi was formerly a chapelry to Tywardreth. In 1507, there was an agreement between the inhabitants of the chapelry and the parissiioners of Tywardreth, about a cemetery at the chapel of St. Sampson at Gullant6: from this time, probably, it has been deemed a separate parissi. Mr. Rassileigh is impro prietor of St. Sampson's, and patron of the curacy.

The manor of Sheviock was anciently in the family of De Alneto, Dannye, or Dawney, of whom Nicholas had summons to parliament as a baron, in the reign of Edward I. : their heiress brought it to the Courtenays'. On the attainder of the Marquis of Exeter, in 1538, this manor escheated to the crown, and was granted in 1554, by King Edward VI., to Sir Walter Mildmay, and by him sold in 1558 to Thomas Carew, Esq. : it is now the property of the Right Honourable Reginald Pole Carew, M.P., representative of the ancient family of Carew.

At St. John's, which almost adjoins the town of Helston, was the hospital or priory of St.Mary Magdalen, or St. John the Baptist, said to have been founded by one of the Killegrews : Bissiop Stafford, when he was at Helston in 141 1, granted an indulgence to all benefactors to the poor of this hospital : its revenues, at the time of the dissolution of religious houses, were valued at 1 2I. 6s. 4d.'n : this hospital is said to have been dependant on the priory of St.Michael's Mount. The manor of Truthall is said, by Hals, to have belonged to the Knights- Hospitallers, but we do not find it enumerated by Dugdale among the ample possessions of that fraternity : it is more likely that it belonged to the priory of St. John before-mentioned. After the Reformation, we find it in the family of Nants or Nance n, who were succeeded by the Arundells of Tolverne. The first Arundell of Truthall was Captain John Arundell, an active royalist in the reign of Charles I., who, after the Restoration, was made duputy-governor of Pendennis castle. Truthall was purchased of the Arundells by the late Mr. Justice Busier, and is still vested in his family. The manor-house is now occupied by a farmer. The manor of Penrose was, from an early period, the property, and its barton the residence, of the ancient family of that name, which became extinct by the death of John Penrose, Esq., in 1744. Mrs. Cuming, niece of Mr. Penrose0, who inherited under her uncle's will, sold this estate in 1770 to John Rogers, Esq., the present proprietor. Penrose, now the seat of Mr. Rogers, is near the small lake already described, called Looe-pool p: this lake was measured in 1771, and found to contain 1 6t, statute acres ; but it varies according to the season of the year. The surrounding scenery is very beautiful ; the lake abounds in water-fowls, and a peculiar species of trout, called the Looe-trout. The Treville family formerly held lands near Helston, by the service of providing a boat and nets for the King's use in Looe-pool, during the whole time of his stay, whenever he ssiould visit Helston.9 The manor of Fenton or Venton-Vedna, in this parissi, was purchased in 1768, by Sir William Lemon, Bart., of Sir Edward Dering, Bart., and others, being the representatives of the Lowers.

This church is consolidated with those of St.Michael-Caerhayes, and St. Dennis, forming an united rectory, which is a sinecure, and a vicarage. St.Michael is the mother-church, but St. Dennis and St.Stephen are separate parissies. The rectory and vicarage are held by the fame incumbent : Lord Grenville is patron.

The principal villages in this parissi, exclusively of the church-town, are Buraton, Carkeel, and Trematon. The manor and honor of Trematon, in this parissi, was held under Robert Earl of Moreton and Cornwall, in the reign of William Rufus, by Reginald de Valletort, whose descendant, Roger de Valletort, the last heir male of the family, gave it to Richard Earl of Cornwall and King of the Romans.

The Prince granted the manor of Trematon for life to Sir Nigel Loring*, who had been his brave companion in arms during the wars with France, and who, it is probable, made Trematon-Castle his occasional residence. Sir Nigel had estates in Bedfordshire, where he is said to have been buried. Carew relates, that, during the Cornissi commotions in 1549, Sir Richard Grenville held this castle for awhile against the rebels ; that having been induced to quit it, for the purpose of holding a parley with the besiegers, they intercepted his return, seized on the castle, sent him a prisoner to Launceston gaol, and plundered and ill-treated his lady and her attendants. We find no account of this castle having been occupied by either party during the civil war in the seventeenth century. A survey of the duchy of Cornwall, bearing date 1337/ describes a hall in Trematon-castle, with a kitchen and lodging-chamber, as built by Edmund Earl of Cornwall ; and speaks of an ancient chapel within the gate : Carew speaks of the inner buildings of this castle, as \" all funke into ruine ; the ivie tapissed walls of the keepe and base-court only remaining, and a poor dwelling for the keeper of the gaol.\" The survey made by order of parliament in 1650, after stating that lands were held under the honor, by the service of the tenants repairing every one his part of the castle ; adds, that it was so much out of repair, that there was scarcely any thing left but the walls on the south side ; that there was on that side an old ruined house, in which the keeper dwelt, and kept the prisoners arrested in the honor b.

Lord Bonville sold the manor of Shillingham to Jasper Horsey, clerk, who settled it, with Combe, parcel thereof, on a chantry founded by himself. The manors of Shillingham and Trehan, and Combe farm, have been more than two centuries in the Busier family, the elder branch of which became extinct by the death of James Busier, Esq. of Shillingham, (who had been one of the repre sentatives of the county in two parliaments,) in 17 10; when the Shillingham estate passed to the Bullers of Morval, and is now the property of James Busier, Esq., M.P., of Downes, near Crediton in Devonssiire.

The town of Saltassi, formerly called Esse and Assheburgh, is situated on a steep ascent upon the banks of the Tamar, consisting of three principal streets, which, as Carew observes, \" every ssiower wassies clean.\" Saltassi was made a free borough in the reign of King John, or that of Henry III., by Reginald de Valle tort, who confirmed to the burgesses divers privileges which they had enjoyed under his ancestors : these privileges were confirmed by King Richard II. In the year 1682, King Charles the Second granted this borough a renewed charter of incorporation', under which the body-corporate was defined to consist of a mayor and six aldermen, styled the council of the borough, who had liberty to choose a recorder. A new charter was procured in 1774, under which the corporation consists of a mayor, aldermen, and an indefinite number of burgesses. 1 Most probably Earth belonged at that time to Mrs. Mabbot : it is not unlikely that she was heiress of the last of the Bond family who possessed Earth. We have uo exact account when they ceased to possess it. 1 In the Droceedings of a Chancery suit between the executors of Nicholas Tyack and the corpora tion, Tyack is accused of having obtained a resignation of the charter of 27 Eliz., and procured a new charter 30 Car.

Some names of eminence appear in the list of representatives, as Sir Francis Cottington, Edward Hyde, afterwards Earl of Clarendon, and Edmund Waller, the poet. There was a market attached to the castle of Trematon, and probably held at Saltassi, when the survey of Domesday was taken : it is spoken of in that survey as a new market of the Earl's, which had been prejudicial to the abbot's market at St.Germans. There is now a small market for butchers'-meat on Saturday: Browne Willis fays, that the burgesses claimed another on Tuesday, but that it was not then held. The present fairs are on the Tuesday before each quarter day (the remnant, probably, of their Tuesday's market), February 2, and July 25: the two last are for horned cattle and ssieep. The tolls of the market and fairs belong to the corporation, who hold also the manor of the borough of Asse burgh under the duchy, and are entitled to a ferry over the Tamar, the privilege of dredging for oysters, the farm and tolls of oysters, and certain duties payable by masters of ssiips, which altogether produced about 300k per annum in 17 14.\" The manor of Asseburgh had been held under temporary grants, by the Earls of Kent and Huntingdon, Lord Fanhope, &c.n In 1620 Sir Richard Busier is stated to have held Aissi, formerly held by John Amys, under the honor of Trematon0.

General Ruthen, finding it open after his defeat at Bradock-down, in January 1643, took possession, and hastily fortified it; but it was soon afterwards taken by assault, by Lord Mohun and Sir Ralph Hopton: a garrison was left in it in the month of May that year, but on the approach of the Earl of Essex, it was given up the latter end of July 1644. We are told that on this occasion Sir Edward Waldegrave gallantly defended the pass, and, as it appears, with temporary success. After the capitulation of Essex, Saltassi was again taken possession of by Sir Richard Grenville : in the month of October following, it was taken by a detachment from the garrison at Plymouth : Sir Richard Grenville afterwards recovered it by assault : it was finally abandoned by the King's troops, in the month of February 1646/ There is a chapel of ease in Saltassi, dedicated to St. Nicholas : the mayor nominates the minister. The Exeter registers speak of chapels formerly in this town, dedicated to St. Faith and St.John the Baptist5. There are meeting-houses for the baptists and the Wefleyan methodists.

The manor of Stoke-Climfland being one of the franchises enumerated by Carew, is parcel of the ancient possessions of the duchy of Cornwall. The manor of Climfland-Prior, partly in this parissi, and partly in Linkinhorne, belonged to the priory of Launceston, and was one of those annexed to the duchy by King Henry VIII., in lieu of the honor of Wallingford.

Stratton, a small market-town in the north part of the county, being in the hundred to which it gives name, and in the deanery of Trigg-Major, lies about 18 miles north-north-west of Launceston, and is 223 from London. The road into Cornwall, by way of Stratton, was much frequented before the making of theCamel ford turnpike-road, about the year 1760. The market, which appears to have been held by prescription, is on Tuesdays, for corn and provisions : there are three cattle fairs ; May 19th, November 8th, and December nth. This parissi is said by Camden to have been famous for gardens and garlick : there are now no gardens in the neighbourhood, but such as are cultivated for private use; nor is it remarkable for the culture of garlick, although it is sometimes offered for sale in the market, and purchased by the cattle-doctors. The principal village in this parissi is the small sea-port of Bude, containing a few cottages, which fumissi lodgings for such families as frequent the coast in the summer season for sea-air and bathing. The trade of this place has considerably increased of late years : the chief exports are, timber, bark, and oats ; the imports, coal and limestone from Wales, and groceries, &c. from Bristol. The harbour, on account of its sands, is best suited to vessels from 50 to 60 tons burden ; but, occasionally, vessels of 80 and 90 tons enter it ; one of upwards of 90 tons was built at Bude in 18 13 for the trade of this port. Great quantities of sea-sand w are cameo1 from Bude for manure, not only into the neighbouring parissies, but into the north of Devon, to the distance of 20 miles and upwards. Stratton has acquired considerable note from the great victory which was obtained in its immediate vicinity by the King's forces over the parliamentarians, in the early part of the civil war'. In consideration of his eminent services in this battle, which are particularly specified in the patent, Sir Ralph Hopton was, in 1643, created Lord Hopton of Stratton. After his death, which happened in 1654, King Charles II.

The manors of Stratton and Binamy belonged, at an early period, to an ancient family, called in various records, De Albo Monasterio, Blanchminster, and Whit minster. Sir John de Blanchminster, dying without issue, towards the latter part of the fourteenth century, these estates passed to Emmeline, only daughter and heir of Sir Richard Hiwis, who had married Alice, daughter of Sir Ralph de Blanchminster, and aunt of Sir John : this Emmeline married to her first hussiand Sir Robert Tresilian, Chief Justice of the King's Bench y, and after his death, Sir John Colessiill, to whom Guy de Blanchminster, rector of Lansallos, released in 1393 all right in the manors of Stratton, Binamy, &c. Sir John Colessiill (son of the above), who was killed at the battle of Agincourt in 141 5, left an infant son, after whose death, in 1483, the large estates of this family passed by a female heir to a younger branch of the Arundells, soon extinct, and were afterwards in severalties among its numerous representatives. The manors of Binamy and Stratton, having been purchased by the Grenville family, passed with the Kilkhampton estate, and are now the property of Lord Carteret. Binamy-castle, which appears to have been built by Ralph de Blanchminster, in or about the year 1335% is spoken of as a seat of the Colessiills by William of Worcester, who made a tour through Cornwall in the reign of Edward IV. Borlase describes the house of the Blanchminsters as having been situated half a mile from Stratton, and a furlong from the ancient causeway made by that family : on this estate, now called Binhamy, is a farm-house ; a little to the west of which, is a moated orchard, described in Camden's map (as a square fort, and called Binnoway. The manor of Essord alias Ebbingford belonged, at an early period, to the Waumfords or Waunfords\", from whom it passed by a coheiress to the Durants : the heiress of the latter brought it to the Arundells of Trerice : it has since passed with the Trerice estate, and is now the property of Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, Bart. : part of the old mansion is occupied as a farm-house, and part of it is the occasional residence of Wrey J'Ans, Esq.

This Elizabeth Cornish was baptized in October 1578 : her father's name was John Veale: ssie was when ssie died in the 114th year, having lived at least 113 years, 4 months and 15 days.\" It appears by the register that 153 persons died of the plague in this small town, in the year 1547. In 1729, out of 49 persons buried, 42 fell victims to that .destructive distemper, the small-pox. There was formerly a chapel on a little hill at the mouth of Bude harbour, dedicated to the Holy Trinity and St.Michael, and another at Essord, dedicated to St.Leonard.d The great tithes of this parissi, and the manor of Sanctuary, belonged to the priory of Launceston. This manor, to which the advowson of the vicarage is attached, was one of those annexed to the duchy of Cornwall in 1540, in lieu of the honor of Wallingford. The spot called the Sanctuary, which gives name to the manor, is near the church, and occupied by a few cottages. The great tithes of Stratton, which, subsequent to the Reformation, were some time in the family of Waddon, have been sold in severalties. There is a meeting-house at Stratton for the Wefleyan methodists. One of the Blanchminster family gave lands of considerable value to the church and poor of this parissi : he gave asso 48s. per annum, payable out of the tithes of Eglossierry, to the vicar of Stratton, for preaching four sermons on two Sundays, in Eglossierry church. , The lands given to the church of Stratton, lying in the parissies of Stratton, Week St.Mary, and Tresmere, are now let at 53k 5s. per annum ; those given to the poor are wholly in the parissi of Stratton, and are let at 113k 13s. 4d. per annum : there was a donation of land also (now let at 7I. per annum) to the poor of Eglossierry. The management of these estates, given to the parissi of Stratton, has long been vested in certain persons, called the feoffees and eight men, who distribute the rents payable to the poor, among such as are not actually chargeable to the parissi.

There are post-offices at Polperro and East-Looe ; but Lissieard is the principal post-office town of the district. The decayed market-town of West-Looe, and part of the small fissiing-town of Polperro, are in this parissi. On the barton of Portlooe, in the parissi of Talland, just opposite Looe-island, was a cell of Benedictine monks, called Lammana, subject to the abbey of Glastonbury, to which the site appears to have been given by the ancestors of Hastulus de Solenny : there are some small remains of the chapel. In Hearne's appendix to Adam de Domerham, is a grant of Hastulus de Solenny, confirming the island of St.Michael de Lammana (most probably that of St. George, opposite Looe,) to the monks of Glastonbury ; a grant of Roger Fitz-William, quitting claim to the lands of Lammana, which he held for life under the church of Glastonbury (reserving the house which Mabil his sister occupied) ; and one of Richard Earl of Cornwall, granting the monks a licence to farm out the church, and the island of Lammana. It appears that Abbot Michael, about the middle of the thirteenth century, leased it to the sacristary of the convent. The"], [683, "CORNWALL. 299 The manor of Talland belonged, for many generations, to the family of Morth or Murth, who possessed and resided on the barton in Carew's time. That author relates the following anecdote relating to this family : \u2014 \" One of their aunces tours, within the memorie of a next neighbour to the house, called Prake (bur dened with 1 1 o yeeres age), entertained a British miller, as that people, for such idle occupations, prove more handie then our owne.

What remains of the old mansion is occupied as a farm-house. The manor of Killigarth was, at an early period, the property and seat of a family of that name. John de Kylgat was one of those who had estates of 20k per annum or upwards in the reign of Edward I.\" The heiress of Killigarth brought this estate to the Beres in the reign of Henry VI.f, and the heiress of Bere to the grandfather of Sir William Beville, who was Carew's contemporary5, and the last heir-male of an ancient and respectable family. A coheiress of the Bevilles brought Killigarth to Sir Bernard Grenville, who sold it to the Halletts. Thomas Kendall, Esq., who married a coheiress of the last-mentioned family, left an only daughter, Mrs. Mary Kendall, who dying unmarried in the year 17 10, was buried in Westminster-Abbey by her own desire, near the monument of the Countess of Ranelagh, mother of her intimate friend, Lady Catherine Jones, as appears c Carew, f. 52. b.

It is possible that the Killigarths might have held under Serjeaux. \u00ab Carew relates some singular anecdotes of a servant of Sir William Beville's, who seems to have surpassed all the extraordinary eaters whom we have heard of in latter times, and to have possessed bv nature the power of swallowing burning coals, which those who have exhibited such feats for their livelihood, are supposed to have acquired by art. This fellow, whom Carew compares to Polyphemus, or the Egyptian great eater Polyphagus, in whom the Emperor Nero took so much pleasure, was taken up by Sir William under a hedge in the depth of winter, well nigh starved with cold and hunger : \" hee was of stature meane, of constitution leane, of face freckled, of composition well proportioned, of diet naturally spare and cleanely inough ; yet, at his master's bidding, he would devoure nettles, thistles, the pith of artichokes, raw and living birds, and fishes, with all their scales and feathers, burning coles and candles, and whatsoever else, howsoever unfavourie, if,it might Qq2"], [684, "CORNWALL. 300 appears by the inscription on her own monument : this lady bequeathed Killigarth to the Rev.

The manor of Kilmenawth or Kilmenorth was parcel of the possessions of Sir Robert Tresilian, Chief Justice of the King's Bench, on whose attainder11 it was granted to John Hawley', who married Emma, his daughter and heir : Hawley's only daughter and heir brought it to the Coplestones. This estate, which is not now esteemed a manor, is the property of the Rev. Sir Harry Trelawny, Bart., by purchase from Mr. Cofferat. The barton-house is occupied by a farmer. A survey of the hundred of West, made by the King's order, about the year 1512, and deposited in the Augmentation Office, describes the manor of Portalla, valued at 5I. per annum, as then belonging to Henry Stafford, Earl of Wiltssiire ; and the manor of Kylhack, belonging to Richard Coode, Esq., as valued at 61. per annum : neither of these manors are now known. There are several tene ments of the name of Porthalla, all parcel of the manor of Trelawny : the name of Kylhack is not known.

West-Looe first sent members to parliament in the reign of Edward VI. : the right of election is vested in the corporation and freemen ; the number of electors being at present between fifty and sixty. Among the representatives of this borough, we find the names of the Earl of Ranelagh, Sidney Godolphin, Sir Charles Hedges, and Sir Charles Wager, a distinguissied naval character, who is said to have been a native of West-Looe : we are informed that he resided some time at Kilmenawth in this parissi. The town of West-Looe, in 1801, contained 82 houses, and 376 inhabit ants ; in 181 1, 93 houses, and 433 inhabitants, according to the returns made to parliament at those periods. The manor of Port-Looe alias Port-Pigham, including the town of West-Looe, belonged, in the reign of Henry III., to the Treverbin family, who granted various privileges to the burgesses : it was afterwards in the baronial family of Dawney, from whom it passed by marriage to the Courtenays. After the attainder of Henry Courtenay, Marquis of Exeter, it was given to the duchy of Cornwall with other manors, in lieu of the honor of Wallingford. There was formerly a chapel at West-Looe dedicated to St. Nicholas\", which has been converted into a Guildhall. There is a meeting-house of the Calvinistic methodists at West-Looe, and of the Wesleyan methodists at Polperro.

The Bissiop of Exeter is patron of the vicarage. The depopulated parissi of Temple, which contains only three cottages, with some small remains of its dilapidated church, lies on the downs, six miles from Bodmin, on the road to Launceston. The manor and church belonged to the Knights-Hospitallers, and having passed with their preceptory of Trebigh, are now the property of Sir Bourchier Wrey, Bart., who ia patron of the sinecure benefice : it has twice been augmented by Queen Anne's bounty.

Tintagell, in the hundred of Lesnewth and deanery of Trigg-Minor, lies three miles west-south-west from Boscastle, and five north-west from Camelford, which is the post-office town. In this parissi is the small borough-town of Bossiney, and the villages of Trebarwith, Tregatta, Trenow, Trevenna, and Tre warmet. There is an annual fair at Trevenna for horned cattle, on the first Monday after October 19. The manor of Tintagell was parcel of the ancient demesnes of the Earls and Dukes of Cornwall. Its castle, which is of great antiquity, is said to have been the birth-place of King Arthur ; with respect to whom, it was the opinion of Lord Chancellor Bacon, that there was truth enough in his story to make him famous, besides that which was fabulous. His history, nevertheless, has been so blended with the marvellous by the monkissi historians, that some authors have been disposed even to doubt his existence, and the circumstances connected with .his birth at Tintagel are certainly not among those parts of his story which are most entitled to credit. We find no mention of this castle again in history till the year 1 245, when Richard Earl of Cornwall was accused of having afforded an asylum at his castle of Tintagel, to his nephew, David Prince of Wales, being in rebellion against his uncle !s Thomas de la Hyde was governor or constable of the castle in 1307/ Thomas le Arcedekne in 13 13,\" and William de Bottreaux in 1325. w In 1337 it appears that there was no governor ; the priest who officiated at the chapel having the custody of the castle, for which he received no fee. It appears by a survey of that date x, that the castle was then in a very ruinous state, and had only one chamber and a kitchen, belonging to the constable, in good repair. The great hall had been taken down by John of Eltham, then late Earl of Cornwall. In the reign of Richard II. Tintagel-castle was made a state-prison, and a more desolate spot could not have been fixed upon for such a purpose ; about this time the custody of the castle was again given to persons of rank and consequence : John Holland, Earl of Huntingdon, was made constable in 1388.

Leland, speaking of Tintagell, says, \u2014 \" This castelle hath bene a marvelus strong and notable forteres, and almost situ loci inexpugnabile, especially for the dungeon, that is on a great high terrible cragge, environed with the se, but having a draw-bridge from the residew of the castelle unto it. There is yet a chapel standing withyn this dungeon of S.Ulette alias Ulianne. Shepe now fede within the dungeon. The residew of the buildinges of the cartel be sore wether beten and yn ruine, but it hath beene a large thinge.\" In another place he fays, \u2014 \" The castel had be lykhod three wardeS, wherof two be woren away with gulfying yn of the se : withowte the isle renneth alonly a gate howse, a walle, and a sals braye dyged and walled.

There is in the isle a prety chapel, with a tumbe on the left fyde.\" The accounts of Tintagel-castle by Carew and Norden are nearly similar ; the latter, indeed, appears to have been taken from the former. \" Half the buildings,\" fays Carew, \" were raised on the continent, and the other halfe on an iland, continued together (within men's remembrance) by a drawebridge, but now divorced by the downefaln steepe cliffes, on the farther side, which, though it ssiut out the sea from his wonted recourse, hath yet more strengthened the iland ; for in passing thither yop must first descend with a dangerous declyning, and then make a worse ascent, by a path, through his sticklenefs occasioning, and through his steepneffe threatning, the ruine of your life, with the falling of your foote.

He must have his eyes that will scale Tyntagell. \u2014 Most of the iland buyldings are ruyned.\" It appears by the view of Tintagell annexed to Norden's description, that a great part of the building on the main land was in his time standing. The present state of this castle has been already spoken of. The castle and manor of Tintagell were annexed to the duchy of Cornwall in the reign of Edward III. : it is now on lease to the Honourable Stuart Wortley. Carew fays, that a fee of ancienty belonging to this castle, was cancelled by Lord Burleigh, as unnecessary. Tintagell was made a free borough by Richard Earl of Cornwall : this place, as well as Trevenna, forms a part of the borough of Bossiney, which, by the name, sometimes of Bossiney or Trevanna separately, and sometimes Bossiney alias Trevenna, has sent two members to parliament ever since the reign of Edward VI. The borough, though not incorporated, is governed by a mayor, in whom and the freemen the right of election is vested. Whoever has free land within the borough, and lives in the parissi, is entitled to vote : the present number of electors is 15. In the list of representatives we find the names of Sir Francis Drake, the circumnavigator ; Sir Francis Cottington, secretary of state to King Charles I.; and Sir Richard Weston, afterwards Earl of Portland, and lord treasurer in the fame reign. Leland speaks of Bossiney as having been formerly a town of more consequence : \" Bossenney,\" fays he, \" hath beene a bygge thing for a fischar town, and hath great privileges graunted onto it. A man may se there the ruines of a greate number of houses.\" The manor of Menedeglos (now Menedews), and Tregatta, belonged at an early period to the family of De la Hyde : the former is now the property of John Bray, Esq., of Tre-bray, in this parissi ; Tregatta, of Mr. Nicholas Marssiall and Mr. William Cock. The manor of Trenewith, which belonged formerly to the baronial family of Bottreaux, is now the property of Charles Rassileigh, Esq. The manor of Trethevy has been long in the Trefusis family, and is now the property of Lord Clinton. The manor of Trecarne is the property of the Honourable Colonel James Stuart. Trevillet, formerly a seat of the family of Wood, is now a farm-house.

Towednack, in the deanery and in the west division of the hundred of Penwith, lies about two miles and a half nearly south-west from St.Ives. The principal villages in this parissi are, Amalibria or Amalibry, Amalvear, Amalwidden, Bossow, Breja, Nancledry, Skilly-waddon, and Trevidgia. The manor of Amalibria was conveyed by Humphry Noy to his son-in-law, Davies, and is now the property of his descendant Davies Giddy, Esq., M.P. The church is a daughter-church to Lelant ; it is called in old records, the chapel of St.Ewin: the church-yard was consecrated in 1541, since which time it has been esteemed a separate parissi : as a benefice it is still united to Lelant. William Praed, Esq. is impropriator of the great tithes of both, which belonged to the college of Crediton. Tremaine or Tremean, in the north division of the hundred of East, and in the deanery of Trigg-Major, lies seven miles north-west from Launceston, which is the post-office town. The only village in this parissi, except the church-town, is Trusel. The manor of Tremaine belonged to the family of Treise, whose heiress brought it to the father of the late Sir John Morssiead, Bart. Castle-Milford, the ancient seat of the Treises, is now a farm-house, the property of Mr. John Jolliffe, who purchased it of Sir John Morssiead. The greater part of this parissi is within the manor of Penhele in Eglossierry. The church of Tremaine, now a daughter-church to Eglossierry, was consecrated, in 1 48 1, by the name of the chapel of Winwolaue of Tremeneb, with a cemetery adjoining, since which time it has probably been esteemed a separate parissi.

Tkesmere, in the north division of the hundred of East and in the deanery of Trigg-Major, lies six miles west-north-west from Launceston, which is the post office town, and ten miles nearly east-north-east from Camelford. The only village in the parissi, besides the church-town, is Treburtle. This parissi is within the Duke of Northumberland's manor of Werrington, in Devonssiire, which was purchased of the Morice family.

Under Queen Elizabeth's charter, bearing date 1589, the corporation of Truro consists of a mayor, four aldermen, and 20 capital burgesses, in whom alone the right of electing two members of parliament (enjoyed by the borough ever since the reign of Edward I.) is vested. The burgesses of Truro enjoy sundry privileges, by grant of their ancient lords ; and the mayor's juris diction extended over Falmouth harbour. This last-mentioned privilege, said to have been granted by King John, and recorded in the Heralds' visitation of 1620, was lost in the early part of the last century, it having been then successfully contested by the inhabitants of Falmouth. In"], [694, "CORNWALL. 310 In the year 1410, the inhabitants of Truro petitioned parliament, that the rent payable to the crown, which had been lowered from 12k is. iod. to 2I. 10s. for a term of years, by the late King (Richard II.), in consideration of their losses by pestilence and invasion, might be thus reduced in perpetuity ; it is stated that Truro might be considered as the key and defence of that part of the county from the approach of the enemy ; and that the inhabitants, so far from having been encouraged to rebuild their houses, were meditating to quit the town, and establissi themselves elsewhere.* Truro was one of the decayed market-towns, to encourage the repairs of which an^ct of parliament was passed in 1540/ Norden, who visited Cornwall in 1574, speaking of Truro, says, \u2014 \" There is not a towne in the west part of the ssiyre more comendable for neatness of buyldinges, nor more discomendable for the pride of the people.\" Carew calls Truro \" the principal town of the haven : I hold it,\" fays he, \" to have got the start in wealth of any other Cornissi towne, and to come behind none in buildings, Launceston only excepted, where there is more use and profit of faire lodgings through the countie assizes. I wissi that they would likewise deserve praise for getting and employing their riches in some industrious trade, to the good of their countrey, as the harbours opportunitie inviteth them.\" Carew's wissi has long ago been amply fulfilled, Truro having become a place of considerable trade8; and its centrical situation has long ago more than counterbalanced the advantages he speaks of, and which are now divided be tween Launceston and Bodmin. Truro, which has of late years very much increased in buildings, is now the handsomest, and, including its suburbs, by far the largest town in Cornwall, except Falmouth. It is inhabited by many of the gentry of the county, and has all the advantages of a provincial metropolis, as an assembly room, theatre, county-library, infirmary11, &c. In 1801, there were 369 houses, and 2,358 inhabitants; in 181 1, 400 houses, and 2,482 inhabitants in the town of Truro ; but it must be observed, that the suburbs, which apparently form part of the town, are more populous than the town itself, comprizing a considerable part of the population of the two parissies of St. Clement and Kenwyn, which two parissies altogether contain nearly 8,000 souls. The Easter quarter-sessions are held here. Truro is one of the coinage towns ; of late years, indeed, the coinages (with few exceptions) have been only here and at Penzance.

In"], [695, "CORNWALL. 311 In the town of Truro was a nunnery of poor Clares, of which we know nothing but its existence. It was situated where the late King's-head inn stood, which was pulled down when Lemon-street was built : it occupied what is now the entrance of that street from Boscawen-street. In Kenwyn-street (being in the parissi from w\"hich it takes its name) was a house of Dominican friers ; the site of which is now occupied by tan-pits. Truro was the head-quarters of Sir Ralph Hopton, soon after his first arrival in Cornwall with the King's forces in 1642 ; and again, just before his surrender to Sir Thomas Fairfax, in 1646. Sir Thomas had establissied his head-quarters there before the conclusion of the treaty'.

The manor of Truro, or as it was called in old records, Truru-burgh, belonged to Richard de Lucy, Chief Justice of England, in the year 1 161. It is probable that he built the castle of Truro, which is spoken of by William of Worcester as being in ruins in the reign of Edward IV., and by Leland, as 'c clene down in that of Henry VIII.\" Hals fays, that he had seen a deed, belonging to Mr. Carlyon of Kea, bearing date 6 Hen. V., in which this castle was called \" Cqslellum de Guelon.\" The site of this castle, still discernible by some remains of the mount, was at the top of what was Pancras, now Pyder street. In the reign of Henry I. Reginald Fitz-Henry, Earl of Cornwall, as lord paramount, con firmed to the burgesses the privileges which had been granted by Richard de Lucy. The manor passed in moieties to the coheiresses of Lucy : one moiety was given by Rohesia, one of the coheiresses to William de Briewere, a powerful baron in the reign of King John1; this moiety of the manor and church of Truro, or Truru-burgh, came afterwards to the family of Hiwis; and having passed, by successive female heirs, to the Colessiills and Arundells\"1, became subdivided among the coheirs of the latter\": this estate was held of the honor of Launceston, by the annual render of an ivory bow. The other moiety passed by marriage from the family of Lucy to that of De Ripariis0, and was conveyed by the latter at an early period, together with the castle, to Thomas, son of Reginald de Prideaux'.

This manor is at present thus divided : \u2014 Lord Mount-Edgcumbe has a moiety by inheritance ; Sir John St.Aubyn one eighth, by inheritance from the Arundells through the Whittingtons; the Honour able Mrs. Agar a fourth, by inheritance from the Robartes family, who possessed it in 1620'; and the Marquis of Buckingham one-eighth, which belonged to the Vincents (by purchase from some of the representatives of Colessiill), and passed to the Nugent family with their other Cornissi estates. The November fair belongs to the proprietors of this manor, as high lords of the town. A glove is hung out at this fair, as at Chester. The lords claim a tax called Smoke-money, from most of the houses in the borough ; there was another, now grown obsolete, called Coveridge-money. The Robartes family had a capital mansion at Truro, which is still standing, at the north-west corner of Boscawen or Powder street ; but its front has been altered. Sir Richard Robartes, Bart, was in 1624 created Baron Robartes of Truro. The manor of Truro, and Treyew in Truro, and Kenwyn, which had belonged to the Tregians, is now the property of Lord Viscount Falmouth. The manor of Truro-Vean in Truro, and the parissies of Kenwyn and St.Clement, belongs to Mr. Joseph Edwards of Truro, by purchase from Lord Arundell.

The principal villages in this parissi, exclusively of the church-town, are, Kellygreen, Penhale, Polssiea, and Tamsquite. There are two fairs held at the church-town, for ssieep and cattle, (May 20, and September 14,) under a charter granted, in the reign of Queen Anne, to Anthony Nicoll, Esq., and Edward Trelawny, clerk. The manor of St.Tudy and Trelil belonged to the family of Nicoll : Anthony Nicoll, Esq., who died in 1678, sold it, together with Penvose, the seat of his ancestors, (now a farm-house,) to John Trehawke, Esq. : the late Mr. Trehawke bequeathed it to Samuel Kekewich, Esq., the present proprietor. The manor of Tinten was, at an early period, the property and seat of a family of that name, whose heiress, in the fourteenth century, married Sir Walter Carminow of Boconnoc : having passed with that estate to the Courtenays, it fell to the crown on the attainder of the Marquis of Exeter, and was one of the manors annexed to the duchy of Cornwall in 1540, in lieu of the honor of Wallingford. The manor of Kellygreen belonged formerly to the ancient family of Barrett, who had their seat at the barton : it was afterwards in the Wollocombesw of Coombe, in the parissi of Roborough, Devon. In 1763, John Wollocombe, Esq. conveyed the barton and the manerial rights to William Pennington, Esq., of the Priory, Bodmin. These are now the property of Walter Ralegh Gilbert, Esq., in right of his wife, who was Mr.Pennington's niece. The manor of Polrode belonged at an early period to the family of Bloyow, from which it passed, by successive female heirs, to the Tintens, Carminows, and Courtenays. This manor has passed with Boconnoc, and is now the property of Lord Grenville. Tremeer, in this parissi, was a seat of the Lowers, and the birth-place of Sir William Lower, the dramatic writer, and Dr. Richard Lower % an eminent physician in the reign of Charles II., author of \" A Treatise on the Hears,\" and the discoverer of the waters of Astrop-wells.

After Dr. Lower's death, Hengar became the property of his elder daughter, who married the elder son of Sir William Morice, the secretary of state, and after his death, Major-General Trelawny : Hengar became afterwards the property of the second daughter, who married the father of the late Colonel Michell, and afterwards Major-General Wheeler. Colonel Michell became possessed of this estate, and left it to its present proprietor, Mathew Michell, Esq., son of Captain Mathew Michell, M.P. for Westbury, who, as captain of the unfortunate Gloucester, accompanied Lord Anson in his voyage round the world, and afterwards distinguissied himself as captain of the Worcester, on the coast of Flanders, in 1746. Hengar is the occasional residence of Mr. Michell. In the parissi-church are monuments of the Nicoll family (1542, 1658, and 1678), and that of Samuel Michell, Esq., formerly Colonel in the Coldssieam regiment of Guards, who died in 1786. There are remains of ancient chapels at Tinten and Kellygreen. The Dean and Chapter of Christ-church college in Oxford are patrons of the rectory. Tywardreth or Tywardreath, in the deanery and in the east division of the hundred of Powder, lies about three miles and a half north-west from Fowey, which is the post-office town, and about the fame distance south-south-west from Lostwithiel. The principal villages in this parissi, besides the church-town, are, High-way, Parr, and Polkerris. At the latter place is a fissiery, which supplies Bodmin and other markets ; it is also frequented as a bathing-place. The foundation of the Benedictine priory at Tywardreth has been attributed to the Fitz-Williams, the Cardinhams, the Champernownes, and the Arundells. There is good reason to suppose that it was founded by Ricardus Dapifer, ( Richard, steward of the household,) a man of great wealth, who held that high office either under the King or the Earl of Cornwall. This Richard, who was the immediate ancestor, in the male line, of the Fitz-Richards and Fitz-Williams, and, in the female line, of the Cardinhams also, held the manor of Tywardreth2 and twenty eight others under the Earl of Cornwall, at the time of the Domesday survey ; and he is spoken of as the earliest benefactor of the monastery in a charter of Henry III.\" Robert de Cardinham, who married the heiress of Fitz william, confirmed to the convent the tithes of all the provision of his house hold, except wine, honey, wax, pepper and cummin, which tithes had been given by his great-grandfather, William Fitz-Richard.

The priory of Tywardreih was a cell to the monastery of St.Sergius and St. Bacchus in Normandy : it was suppressed as an alien priory by the parliament at Leicester, in 141 4, but appears to have been restored, and to have continued till the general dissolution of the smaller convents, when its possessions were valued at 123k 9s. 3d. clear yearly income. The site of the priory, with the manor, grange, &c. was granted in 1542 to Edward Earl of Hertford. This manor was in moieties in the year 1620, between the families of St. Aubyn and Pendarves : it is now the property of the Right Honourable Lord de Dunstanville ; one moiety by inheritance from the family of Pendarves ; the other, by a late purchase from Sir John St. Aubyn, Bart. There are no remains of Tywardreth priory : the site is occupied by a farm-house. A lay manor of Tywardreth passed by inheritance from Ricardus Dapifer to the Cardinhams. Towards the latter part of the thirteenth century b, it was sold by Isolda de Cardinham, for the sum of iool., lo the Champemownes : as lords of this manor they became patrons of the monastery, which gave occasion to the idea of their having been its founders. From the Champemownes this manor passed^.\u00bbrith Trelawny in Pelynt, to the Herles and Bonvillesc ; and it is probable that it came to the crown as Trelawny did, by the attainder of the Duke of Suffolk, who inherited Lord Bonville's estate. It was in the Rassileighs as early as the year 1620/ and is now the property of William Rassileigh, Esq., M.P., of Menabilly in this parissi. Lord Grenville has another manor of Tywardreth, which belonged to the Mohuns. Menabilly was much improved by the late Philip Rassileigh, Esq., who formed there the valuable collection of minerals already spoken of. Kilmarth, in this parissi, another seat of Mr. Rassileigh's, was his chief residence before he succeeded to the Menabilly estate. Partly in this parissi is the manor of Polhorman, which, having been forfeited by the attainder of Sir Robert Tresilian, Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench, was granted, in 1388, to Sir Humphrey Stafford' : this manor has been long in the Kendall family, and is now the property of the Rev.

A chapel is now building, by Mr. Rassileigh, on a tenement called Tregaminion, about half a mile from Menabilly-house. An almshouse was founded at Tywardreth by one of the Rassileighs, for four poor widows, who had no settled pension, but were relieved from time to time by the Rassileigh family, till the late Mr. Rassileigh made over so much stock in trust for the pensioners, as would suffice to pay 20s. per annum to each of them, clear of all deductions.

Trengoffe or Trengove gave name to an ancient family, by whom the barton was sold to the Tubbs : in Norden's time, it was the seat of John Tubb, Esq.: after continuing in this family for some descents, it was sold to the Parkers, and by the latter to John Trengove alias Nance, said to have been descended from a younger branch of the family, who sold this barton to the Tubbs/ The manor of Carborro or Carburrow, and the barton of Trevedoe, have been for a considerable time in the family of their present proprietor, Arscott Bick ford, Esq., of Dunfland in Devonssiire. Part of the old mansion is inhabited as a farm-house ; the remainder is reserved for the purpose of holding the manor courts.

The principal villages in this parissi, exclusively of the church-town, are, Bakesdown, Lower-Ex, Kitssiam, and Week-Orchard. The church-town is in all ancient records called the Borough of Week St.Mary, and the occupiers of certain fields are still called burgage-holders. The custom of electing a mayor is still kept up ; but his office is merely nominal : he has no power. There are fairs at Week St.Mary, September 8, and December 10, chiefly for bullocks and ssieep. The manor of Week St.Mary belonged at an early period to the Blanch minsters, from whom it passed to the Colessiills. Ralph de Blanchminster, who died in the year 1348, was seised of the manor and borough, with the advowson of Week St.Mary, to which were appendant, as members of the said manor, Swan nacot, and other tenements. Sir William Bonville was possessed of Wyke St.Mary in 1461.\" In process of time, the manerial rights were transferred from Week St.Mary to Swannacot ; for we find that in 1620 Sir Warwick Hele held the manor of Swannacot, and Week St.Mary Burgh, as parcel of the fame ; yet Henry Compton, Esq. then claimed the fee of Week St.Mary. The manor of Swan nacot, including Week St.Mary, is now the property of the Right Honourable Lord de Dunstanville, by inheritance from the Heles. There was formerly a castle at Week St. Mary, of which a field adjoining the church-yard, called Castle-hill, exhibiting the traces of extensive buildings, is sup posed to have been the site. The manor of East-Orchard-Marrais or Marries, in this parissi, and Marham- Church, belonged to the ancient family of Marrais, whose heiress married an ancestor of the Rolles. The late Dennis Rolle sold this manor, with other considerable estates, to the late Sir John Call, Bart., and it is now the property of Sir W. P. Call, Bart. The barton-house, formerly the scat of the Marrais family, for whom there is an ancient memorial in the church, is now a farm-house, belonging to Mr. Richard Burden Bray: his father purchased the barton of the late Mr.Rolle. T'je manors of Pigsden and Nethercot extend into this parissi. The advowson of Week St.Mary, which belonged formerly, as before mentioned, to the Blanchminsters, appears to have passed, with the manor of Stratton, to Lord Carteret : it now belongs to the master and fellows of Sidney.

Dame Thomasine Percival's will, which bears date 151 2, throws light upon some parts of her history ; it ssiews that her family name was Bonaventer ; for ssie leaves 20k to her brother, John Bona venter: her first hussiand's name was Thomas Bumssiy. She makes her cousin, John Dinham, who married her sister's daughter, residuary legatee, and commits to his discretion the chantry and grammar-school, which ssie had founded in her life-time ; to the vicar of Lissieard ssie leaves a little gilt goblet, with a blue flower in the bottom, to the intent that he ssiould pray for her foul ; and towards the building of the tower at St.Stephen's, Launceston, 20 marks. Carew observes, that in Thomasine Bonaventer's grammar-school, divers of the best gentlemen's sons of Devon and Cornwall had been \" vertuoufly trained up in both kinds of divine and humane learning, under one Cholwell, an honest and religious teacher ; which caused the neighbours so much the rather and the more to rewe, that a petty fmacke onely of popery opened a gap to the oppression of the whole, by the statute made in Edw. the 6 raigne, touching the suppression of chaunteries.\" Many of our celebrated foundation-schools would have ssiared the ' Borlase's Collections from the Registers of the fee of Exeter. fame I"], [707, "CORNWALL. 323 same fate, had they not been protected by well-wissiers to their establissiment, who pointed out the obvious practicability of correcting the superstitious usages with which they were connected; a practicability which those who coveted their revenues would very gladly have overlooked. Wendron, in the deanery and in the west division of the hundred of Kirrier, lies about two miles and a half north-north-east from Helston. The principal villages in this parissi are Porkellis and Trevonnack : Helston is a chapelry of Wendron ; but in most respects may be deemed, and is treated of in this volume as a separate parissi. The manor of Bossienwyn, in this parissi, is in jnoieties between the Honourable Mrs.Agar and Sir John St.Aubyn, Bart. The barton of Trenethick belonged at an early period to the Seneschalls, from whom it passed, by a female heir, to the family of Hill. John Hill, Esq., about the year 1770, bequeathed this estate to a namesake, (but, as we are informed, no relation,) who resided at Carwythenick in Constantine : it is now the property of Peter Hill, Esq., and in the occupation of the Rev. Thomas Wills, vicar of Wendron. The barton of Nanfloe is the property of the Rev. William Robinson ; and Higher-Trelil the property and occasional residence of William Harris, Esq., of Helston, in right of his wife, the heiress of J. Rowe, Esq. Lower-Trelil is the property of Stephen Usticke, Esq. The barton of Trenear, on which are now only some small cottages, is said (most probably without any foundation) to have been a hunting-seat of the Earls of Cornwall : it is the property of Richard Johns, Esq., of Helston, by purchase from the Vyvyans. Bodilly, TOme time the seat of a branch of the Tresilians, passed, by purchase, to the Glynns : it is now a farm-house, the property of Mrs. Harris of Trelik Merther-Uny, to which formerly a deer-park was annexed, is now a farm, belonging to Mr.Chilcot of Truro, and retains no trace of its former conse quence. In the parissi-church is the tomb of Warin Penhallinyk, prebendary of Glaseney college, rector of St.Just, and vicar of Wendron and Stithians, with his figure on a brass plate, in robes, (the date imperfect.) The great tithes were appropriated to the abbey of Rewley, to which monastery the church was given by Edmund Earl of Cornwall u. They are now in severalties, having been sold in lots, about the year 1800, by the late Lord Falmouth. The patronage of the vicarage is now vested in Queen's college, Oxford, having been purchased a few years ago for the Michell foundation.

The principal villages in this parissi are, Rosemannon and Tregonetha : at the latter there are two cattle-fairs, April 25 and August 1. The manor of Borlase-Burgess, formerly the property and seat of the ancient family of Borlase, is said to have been given by King William Rufus to a certain Norman, who was lord of Talfer, in that country, and whose posterity assumed the name of Borlase/ The last heir-male of the elder branch sold this estate, in 1559, to John Hender, Esq., whose heiress brought it to the ancestor of Sir A. O. Molef worth, Bart., the present proprietor : the barton-house is occupied by a farmer. The ancient manor of Codiford-Farlegh alias Lancorla, belonged, at a remote period, to the priory of Bodmin, under which it was held by Bristitius, in the reign of Edward the Confessor. At the time of the Domesday survey, Bristitius held it under the Earl of Cornwall : at a later period, this manor was in the family of Bottreaux ; it has long ago been dismembered. In one of the books of the Exchequer for Cornwall, in Westminster-abbey, fays Hals, \" was lately to be seen a record relating to this manor, which speaks thus of the punissiment of the cucking-stool : \u2014 \" Man. de Cotford-Farlo alias Lancorla in St. Wenn, temp.

The barton of Codiford-Farlegh, which belonged some time to the Trelawny family, is now the property of Mr. John Tom. The manor of Cransworth belonged, in the reign of Edward IV., to the family of Bonville7: it is now the property of the Rev. Charles Prideaux Brune.

This estate, which was inherited by the former, passed successively to the families of Renfry, Parkin, and Vivian z: it is now the property of Thomas Rawlings, Esq. Tregury, Tregurra, or Tregurtha, was the seat of a family so called, of whom was Michael de Tregury, Archbissiop of Dublin, who died in 1471. The last heir-male of the elder branch of this family died in the reign of Henry V., leaving three daughters, coheirs, who sold this barton to the family of Bottreaux3, from whom it passed successively, by inheritance or sale, through the families of Hunger ford, Hastings, Edgcumbe, Parkin, and Vivian, to Mr. William Hals, who wrote the Parochial History of Cornwall, and resided here in the latter part of his life. This estate, now called Tregotha, is the property of Thomas Rawlings, Esq. Killignock was the seat of a family of that name, whose heiress, in the reign of Henry VIII., married Nanssievil alias Typpett. In the reign of Charles II. Matthew Typpett sold this barton to Mr. Joseph Hawkey b : it is now the property of Mr. Richard Vincent. The barton of Damelsa is in severalties.

Froxton, called in old deeds a manor, belonged, in the reign of Edward II., to the Giffords, from whom it passed, by successive female heirs, to the families of Downe, Rouse, and Spoure : it is now possessed by F.

Whitstone, formerly belonging to the Cobham family J, is now the property and residence of Wrey J' Ans, Esq. : it was purchased by his grandfather, Thomas J' Ans, Esq. of Bidiford, of the Badcocks, to whom it had passed in marriage with the heiress of Good.0 The valleys of this parissi abound with woodcocks in a remarkable degree ; nearly 40 nets (or roads as they are called), being exempted from licence by the last game act, are employed in taking them, and yield considerable profit to the cottagers. In the parissi-church, which is dedicated to St. Nicholas, are memorials of the Heles of Bennets, (1650, &c.;) and on the outside wall, one of the family of Edgcumbe. The Rev.John Kingdon, the present incumbent, is patron of the rectory, the advowson of which belonged, some time since, to the Arundell family. There is said to have been formerly a chapel at Froxton, probably the chapel of the Holy Trinity, in this parissi, mentioned in the registers of the see of Exeter/ St. Winnow, in the hundred and deanery of West, lies two miles south-south east from Lostwithiel, which is the post-office town ; and from Fowey about four miles by water, and six by land. The principal villages in this parissi are, Bofar nell, near Resprin-bridge; Bridge-end, adjoining Lostwithiel; Lerrin, on the creek of that name ; Polmenow, and Polschoath or Polscoe. On the beacon-hill, in this parissi, not far from Lostwithiel, a square battery was constructed by King Charles's army, not long before the capitulation of the parliamentary forces in 1 644. The manor of St. Winnow is said to have belonged to an ancient family of that name, whose heiress brought it to the Uptons.

It is probable that the St. Winnows and Uptons held this manor under the families of Bottreaux and Hastings, and that it was the fee of the manor which was purchased by Lower's (maternal) great-grandfather. The two coheiresses of Upton, about the year 1500, married two brothers of the Lower family, John and Nicholas : the latter possessed St.Winnow. Sir William Drummond married the heiress of Lower of St. Winnow ; the coheiresses of Drummond married Trevanion, and Roper of Eltham in Kent. St.Winnow was inherited by the latter: the heiress of Roper married Edward Henfhaw, whose coheiresses married Sir Edward Dering, Bart., William Strickland, Esq., and Sir Rowland Wynne, Bart. About the year 1770, the manor of St.Winnow was purchased of the representatives of these coheiresses by John Rassileigh, Esq. of Penquite, whose son, John Colman Rassileigh, Esq., sold it, about the year 1807, to the Rev. Robert Walker, vicar of St.Winnow, who is the present proprietor. A younger branch of the Lowers (of whom the late Mrs.Hitchens was the last survivor) continued to have an interest in the barton, which was for some descents in the immediate occupation of the Robins family : it was purchased, with the manor, by Mr. Walker, who keeps it in his own hands, the house being occupied by a bailiff. The Lower family were of Polscoe, in this parissi, before they acquired the manor and barton of St.Winnow. The manors of Bridge-end, Polmawgan, Ethy, and Polmenow, belong to Earl Mount-Edgcumbe. The two former have been many years in the Edg- cumbe family, having been purchased of a younger branch of the Carminows, who had their seat at Polmawgan, now a farm-house. The manors of Ethy, (described as an honor in the Exeter Domesday,) and Polmenow, belonged successively to the families of Stonard, Cayse, and Courtenay. In 1634, Francis Courtenay, Esq. sold these manors to Stephen Treville, Esq. of Plymouth. Two of the coheiresses of Treville married Arscott and Burthogge. By purchase and inheritance, these manors became vested in the former ; and having passed, by female descent, to the Molesworths, were purchased of Sir William Molefworth, about the year 1790, by the late Lord Mount-Edgcumbe. Ethy, called by Leland, Teuthey, and by some writers, Tethe and Tethy, was many years the seat of a younger branch of the Courtenays of Powderham : it is, by lease under Lord Mount-Edgcumbe, the seat of Charles Vinicombe Penrose, Esq., Rear- Admiral of the Blue, who has now (March 18 14) the command on the coast of Spain.

The manor of Resprin, formerly the property and seat of a family of that name, passed, by a female heir, to a younger branch of the Car minows; and from Carminow, in like manner, to Prideaux of Thuborough : Norden describes it as a scat of the Prideaux family : it was afterwards in the family of Michell. About the year 1750, Mr. Titus Chappel purchased it of Mr.Bradlick; and it is now the property of Mrs. Joyce Chappel of St. Breock. The manor of Polschoath in Lanlivery, formerly belonging to the families of Lyttelton and Trenance, and now to the Honourable Mrs.Agar, as representative of the Robartes family, extends into this parissi. Trevegoe, a farm-house, belonging to Lord Grenville, was a seat of the Knap mans, whose heiress brought it to the Hawkeys: it was, not many years ago, occupied by Nicholas Harley, Esq., and afterwards by his widow. Newham, a farm-house, belonging to William Rassileigh, Esq., M.P., of Menabilly, was some time a seat of the Sawles. The Dean and Chapter of Exeter have the appropriation of the great tithes of St.Winnow, and are patrons of the vicarage. At St.Nighton is a chapel of ease. There was formerly a chapel at Resprin, dedicated to St. Martin, which was con firmed, by Robert de Cardinham, to the priory of Tywardreth, in the reign of Richard I.s : there was a chapel also at Bodvalgan, dedicated to the fame faint.1' Resprin was formerly a separate parissi, as appears by the Subsidy Roll of 45 Edw.

The greater part of this parissi is a mass of moor-stone : the only cultivated land is a strip about half a mile in breadth, near the sea ; the arable land is particularly noted for its abundant produce of barley. The manors of Boswednack and Trereen or Treen, are the property of William Arundell Harris, Esq., in whose family they have been for a considerable time. The manor of Trewy belongs to Messrs.

After this, we hear nothing of them till the time of the civil war, when they became of considerable importance. In 1 645 they afforded a temporary protection to Prince Charles and his friends, Lord Hopton and Lord CapeP. In 1649, Sir John Grenville, who was afterwards so distinguissied for the ssiare that he had in bringing about the Restoration, being governor of the Scilly islands, fortified and held them for King Charles the Second. The parliament finding their trade much annoyed by his frigates, fitted out an expedition for the reduction of the Scilly islands, under the command of Admiral Blake and Sir George Ayfcue, who first took possession of the islands of Trescaw and Bryer, and threw up fortifications for the purpose of attacking Sir John Grenville at St. Mary's. The Dutch Admiral Vantromp is said to have made insidious but ineffectual proposals to the governor, of taking the islands under his protection. Resistance being found vain, they were delivered up to the parliament in the beginning of June. The garrison consisted of about 800 soldiers, with commis sioned officers enough, as Whitlocke observes, \" to head an army,\" Sir John Grenville's standard having been one of the last rallying points for the Royalists.

Pope Celestin, ini 193, con firmed to the abbey the islands of St. Nicholas, St. Sampson, St.Elid, and St.Teon, the island called Nullo, with all their churches and oratories, and certain lands in other islandsg. Reginald Earl of Cornwall granted to the monks all wrecks, except whole ssiips and whales, in Kentemen and Nurchoh, and the isles of St. Lid, St. Sampson, and St.Teon'. It is sufficiently clear why the abbot and convent of Tavistock were called Domini de Scilly ; meanwhile the property and temporal jurisdiction continued vested in the Earls of Cornwall, or in such as held under them, possessing an independent and contemporary power ; and these were likewise called Domini de Scilly. The first proprietor whom we find mentioned as holding under the Earl, is Robert de Wick, who, by an ancient deed, without date, conveys to the monks of Scilly the tithes of those islands, which he had unjustly detained from them. Drugo de Barentin was governor of the Scilly islands, in the reign of Henry III.k; but whether he had any property in them does not appear. In the reign of Edward I. Ralph de Blanchminster held the castle of Ennor, in the Scilly islands, by the service of finding 1 2 armed men to keep the peace in those islands : complaint was made, that he had not only failed in this service, but had committed the King's coroner, who came to the island for the purpose of holding an assize, to the prison of La Val1. In the year 13 14, Ralph de Blanchminster had the King's licence for embattling his castle of Inor, in the isles of Scilly m. In the year 1345, Ralph de Blanchminster held the isles of Scilly under the duchy of Corn- wall, as of the honor of Launceston, by the annual render of 300 puffins at Michaelmas\". In the reign of Henry VI., the rent was only 50 puffins, or 6s.8d., the islands being then the property of Sir John Colessiill, representative of the Blanch- minsters \u00b0: their annual value in 1484 was estimated at 40s. in time of peace; in time of war, nothing p. In Leland's time, being then valued at 40s. per annum, the Scilly islands belonged to Davers and Whittington, as representatives of that branch of the Arundells which inherited the estates of the Colessiills and Blanch- 1 Dugdale's Monasticon. \u00ab Ibid. \u00bb' Ancient names of islands. 1 Dugdale. * Rot.

In the reign of Edward VI., Thomas Lord Seymour, the Lord Admiral, became proprietor of the Scilly islands, as appears by one of the articles of his accusation, which charges him with having gotten into his hands those strong and dangerous isles, bought of divers men, (viz. the heirs of Danvers and Whit tington*1.) The Lord Admiral was beheaded and attainted in 1549, when the temporal property of the Scilly islands fell into the duchy, already by the dissolution of religious houses possessed of what had belonged to the abbey of Tavistock. In 1552, Thomas Godolghan, Esq. was captain (or governor) of the Sciliy iflesr, and most probably lessee under the duchy ; though we do not find any lease to the GoOchssiin family on record prior to the 13th of Elizabeth, when the Scilly islands were demised to Francis Godolphin, Esq. for 38 years, at the rent of 1 ok per annum : the lease was renewed to Sir William Godolphin, in 1604, for 50 years, at 20k per annum8; in the 12th of Charles the First, to Francis Godolphin, Esq., at 40k per annum, for 50 years, to commence from 1659 ; in 1698, to Sidney Lord Godolphin, at the fame rent, for 89 years, to commence from 1709. The present lessee is the Duke of Leeds, the representative of the Godolphin family, who holds the Scilly islands at a rent of 40k for 31 years from the year 1800. The island of St.Agnes was at an early period in the Hamely family, and appears afterwards to have passed to the Blanchminsters'. John Allet held lands in Scilly (temp. Edw. III.) of Ralph Blanchminster, by the service of being keeper of his castle u. There is no person who now possesses either house or land, except as sub-lessee under the Duke of Leeds. The government of the Scilly islands appears to have been, at least since the Reformation, uniformly in the proprietors, except in the instances of Sir John Grenville and Joseph Hunkin, Esq., in the interregnum, and Major Bennet, previously to the year 1733. Before the Reformation, it appears that the proprietor kept the peace of the islands, with the assistance of 12 armed men\"; and that there were frequent feuds between them and the King's coroner, who visited the islands to hold assizes for the trial of greater offences x. It is most probable that all other offences were 1 Burnet's History of the Reformation, p. 161. r Borlase, p. no.

The lord proprietor appoints a court or council of twelve, consisting of some of the principal inhabitants, among whom are generally the military commandant, the steward, chaplain, and com missary of musters. Vacancies are supplied by election ; but the whole may be dissolved, and a fressi appointment made, at any time, by the lord proprietor. After the death of a lord proprietor, a new council is necessarily appointed. The court generally sits monthly, for the trial of plaints, suits, &c. between party and party, inhabitants of the islands, except such causes as affect life or limb, and such as are cognizable by the court of Admiralty. Transportable offences are tried here, such as receiving stolen goods, &c. ; but the punissiments are only fines or whipping, and sometimes imprisonment. Persons accused of murder, burglaries, &c. &c. are taken to the nearest Cornissi magistrate, and sent to be tried at the assizes for the county of Cornwall/ The Scilly islands have always been deemed to be under the spiritual jurisdiction of the Bissiops of Cornwall or Exeter, and to have constituted part of the arch deaconry of Cornwall ; but there is no memory of any ecclesiastical jurisdiction having been exercised, except in the particular of proving wills. In early times, the abbot of Tavistock held the tithes of the Scilly islands, and certain lands, by the service of finding two monks to reside in them, and to provide for the spiritual wants of the inhabitants. In the reign of Edward III. he was allowed to provide two secular chaplains for this service, instead of monks, during the war with France. Since the Reformation, the tithes have been vested in the lord proprietor, who is patron of the donative, and pays the minister or chaplain an optional salary, now sixty guineas per annum. The minister receives neither institution nor induction, nor is he licensed by the Bissiop ; and neither he nor the church wardens are cited to visitations : the latter are sworn in at .the lords' council court, where cognizance is taken of all offences usually brought before spiritual courts. It was formerly customary to punissi such offenders by ducking in salt water, at the quay head1. Till of late years, the minister of St. Mary's was the only clergyman in the island, officiating constantly at St.Mary, where a register of baptisms and marriages was kept for all the islands ; at Trescaw only on the Sunday after Easter ; and at St. Martin's on Trinity Sunday : the chapels of the other islands were served by laymen, or, as they were called, island clerks, gene rally fissiermen. The society for promoting christian knowledge now employ y Troutbeck's Survey of the Scilly Islands. * Ibid. two"], [719, "CORNWALL. 335 two missionaries, who officiate at what are called the Off-Islands. There are chapels at Trescaw, St. Martin's, St.Agnes, Bryer, and Sampson, mostly built by the Godolphin family, since the Reformation: that of Bryer, about 1746; that of St. Agnes was built at the expence of the society for promoting christian knowledge, who gave 400k towards building a house for the missionary at Trescaw. The Earl of Godolphin, in 1 747, establissied a school, for instructing 1 2 boys in reading, writing, and arithmetic. The Rev. Richard Corbet Hartssiorne, rector of Brosely in Shropssiire, about the year 1753, gave the sum of 250k towards the support either of a minister or schoolmaster at Trescaw, under the direction of the society for promoting christian knowledge1. The only considerable bene faction which the society has received towards the religious instruction of the Scilly islands, since that time, has been the sum of 500k, given by Charles Etty, Esq. About 300k per annum is expended by the society, on the missions and schools in these islands, chiefly out of their general fundsb. St. Helen's island (now uninhabited), supposed to have been the fame as St.Lyde's, exhibits the ruins of houses, and of an ancient chapel, probably that of St.Lyde, \" where, in times past,\" fays Leland, \" at her sepulchre was gret superstition.\" The whole population of the Scilly islands was estimated, in 1750, at about 1,400 persons ; in 1799, they were calculated at about 1,960: the present number is 2,358.' Dr.Borlase estimates the number of inhabitants on St. Mary's island, in 1756, at about 600 : Heath had computed them at 700 in 1750. In 1799 they were nearly 1,000: the present number is 1,271. St. Mary's island is about nine or ten miles in circumference. The principal town of this island is called Hugh or Heugh-town, which was much damaged by inundation during the great storm in \\y44.* The pier was sinissied in 1750, having been constructed at the expence of Lord Godolphin: vessels of 150 tons burden may ride here in safety'. Near this town are the remains of an old fortress, with a mount, and the remains of several block-houses and batteries, supposed to have been constructed in the civil war. About two furlongs to the eastward is a bay called Pomellin or Porthmellin, where is procured in abundance a fine white sand, composed of chrystals and talcf, much esteemed as a writing sand, and for other purposes. About a mile from Hugh-town, is the church- \u25a0 Borlase, p. 136. 1 From the information of the Rev.

Near this are the remains of Old-town castle, spoken of by Leland ; probtbiy the castle of Ennor, which belonged to the Blanchminsters. The traces of an ancient fortress, on a promontory called the Giant's-Castle, are supposed to be of remote origin. On the west side of the island are St. Mary's garrison, with the barracks, and several batteries, and Star-Castle; the latter was built by Sir Francis Godolphin, in 1593. It was in this castle that Dr. John Bastwick was imprisoned, by order of the Court of Star-chamber, in 1637, after having lost his ears in the pillory, for writing against the church and state : his sentence was imprisonment for life ; but he was liberated by order of parliament in 1640. The severity of his sentence caused great odium against the government; and he and his fellow sufferers, Prynne and Burton, who had been sent to other distant prisons, were conducted into London, on their return, with much triumph and rejoicing.11 Trescaw, anciently called Iniscaw and St. Nicholas, is the second island, in point of size, and contains 465 inhabitants, although, within the memory of persons living in 1793, the number of houses did not exceed 12.' In this island are some remains of the conventual church of St. Nicholas, of which there is a view in Dr. Borlase's Observations on the Scilly islands ; the ruins of Old- Castle, and Oliver's Battery. Old-Castle, which appears to have been built in or about the reign of Henry VIII., is spoken of by Leland, as \" a little pile or fortress:\" it appears to have been afterwards enlarged, as its ruins ssiew it to have been a con siderable building. Oliver's Castle, as it is called, from having been built by the parliamentarians, was repaired in 1740 ; but is described by Borlase, in 1756, as being then already much decayed. S Among the few monumental inscriptions in St. Mary's church and church.yard, enumerated by Heath, Borlase, and Troutbeck, are those of Mary, wife of Joseph Hunkins, Esq., governor of the islands, ;6j9; some of the family of Rattenbury, commissaries in the early part of the last century; and Captain James Bollock, of a Kentish family, who was killed by the accidental discharge of a gun, whilst taking the diversion of (hooting, in 1756. Sir John Narborough, Bart, (son of the celebrated admiral of that name) ; Henry Trelawny, son of the Bishop of Winchester; and Captain Edmund Loades, of the Association man-of-war, all of whom shared the melancholy fate of the brave Sir Cloudesley Shovel, who was lost on the Gilston Rock, October 2j, 1707, lie buried in the chancel at St. Mary's ; but there is no monument to their memory. Captain Hancock, of the Eagle, and Captain Coney, of the Romney, two gallant officers, shared also their commander's fate. Sir Clou desley Shovel's body was found by a fisherman, 011 the shore at Porthellic, and by him buried in the sands ; but was afterwards removed to Westminster Abbey. The Colossus, of 74 guns, Captain Murray, was lost on a ledge of rocks to the south-west of St.Sampfon's island, in the month of December, 1798. \" Borlase, p. 10. i Troutbeck.

Mr.Ekins, in 1683, built a tower on this island, as a day-mark, 20 feet high, with a spire on it of the same height*. On St.Agnes island, which contains 244 inhabitants, is a light-house. In Heath's time there was only one family on St. Sampson's ; there are now 32 in habitants. Bryer or Brehar contains about 330 acres, and about m inhabitants. Borlase says, that not long before the date of his work (1756), there were only two families in this island. The principal employment and trade of the islanders is, fissiing* and making kelp1. Mr.Nance, who introduced this process in 1684, resided many years in the island of Tean, the Su. Theona of the records, now uninhabited. Tin is found in several of the islands, and in some lead and copper ; but there are now no mines in work. Some of the islands produce corn, principally barley, peas, and oats, with a small proportion of wheat ; a few acres are sown with pillis m : potatoes are cultivated in great quantities in St. Mary's. Cattle are fed on most of the islands ; and though not very abundant, are sometimes sold to captains of ssiips. Samphire is collected in abundance in the isle of Trescaw, for pickling.

This appears from a deed of composition (now in the registry of the Dean and Chapter at Exeter) for settling the jurisdiction of the archdeaconry, as well as of the whole diocese of Exeter, entered into, on the 20th of March 161 6, by all the dignitaries of the see of Exeter. By this deed the Archdeacon has the exclusive right of proving wills of all persons dying within his jurisdiction, \" ex cepting knights, beneficed men, and such as are de robd episcopi\" and grant ing administrations. Padstow in rure is among the places reserved by this deed to the Bissiop's jurisdiction. It is meant (see the last paragraph of note (b.) that previously to the year 1 740, or thereabouts, wills were more universally registered at Bodmin : it has since been more common for monied persons to have pro perty in the funds, in which case their effects being in two counties, their wills, as is well known, are registered in Doctors-Commons. It may be observed, that during the Bissiop's triennial visitation (the Archdeacon's powers being suspended) wills are proved before the Bissiop's officers, and registered in the Consistory Court at Exeter. The Archdeacon's court was removed from Lostwithiel to Bodmin in 1773 ; it had been before at St.Neots: the courts are held at Bodmin every Friday fortnight. The archdeacon's visitations are held at Launceston, Lissieard, Bodmin, Truro, Helston, and Penzance. P. xxvii. note (c.) It ssiould have been stated that Wendron, Lissieard, and Probus, are among the best vicarages : Calstock, and some other rectories not mentioned, are more valuable than any of the vicarages, except Menheniot, which is endowed with the great tithes.

This Daniel Trelawny of Coldrinnick, dying also without issue (in 1795), the name was taken and the estate inherited by Edward Stephens, Esq., a Captain in the Royal Artillery, son of Edward Stephens, of Plymouth, and grandson of the Rev. Edward Stephens vicar of St.Kew, by Anne, third daughter of Henry Darell, Esq., of Trewornan before-mentioned : the son of the said Edward Trelawny (now a minor) inherits Coldrinnick ; but it will be seen by the foregoing statement, that he is not repre sentative in blood of the Coldrinnick branch of the Trelawnys, which appears to be wholly extinct. It appears that he, and not his uncle (the Rev.Darell Stephens who inherits Trewornan by will), is the representative of the Darells of Trewornan. See p. cii. and 239. P. xciii.

The moors extend from near Blisland church on the west, to near Northill church on the east, about 10 miles ; and from near Davidstow church on the north, to near St.Neot church on the south, about 1 2 miles, running into the four hundreds of Lesnewth, East, West, and Trigg, and including, besides the whole of Temple, the greater part of 1 2 parissies, viz. Davidstow, St. Cleather Alternon, Northill, Linkinhorne, St. Cleer, St.Neot, Warleggan, Cardinham, Blisland, St.Breward alias Simonward, and Advent, These moors abound with picturesque hills, and tors composed of immense masses of granite '': they are much resorted to for hare-hunting in the spring, the ground being drv, and the hares remarkably strong : the small rivers on the moors abound with the black trout. The moors are very capable of agricultural improvement. * Some of the most remarkable not already spoken of, are, Catshole Tor, Carkees Tor, Hawk's Tor West, St.Bellarmine's Tor, Bearah and Carraton Tors.

The sea has considerably encroached on the coast in the hundreds of Stratton and Lesnewth, within the last 50 years, particularly near Bude harbour, where the sand-hills are rapidly lessening, being carried off by the waves.\" P. cxc. An act was passed in the year 1774, for making a navigable canal from Bude-harbour to the river Tamar, in the parissi of Calstock ; but no part of it has as yet been made. The Tamar manure navigation, which skirts the county, was to have been brought on as far as Horse-bridge, in Stoke-CIimsland. In the year 1773, an act of parliament was passed for making a canal from Mawgan- Porth through the several parissies of Mawgan, St.Columb Major, Little-Colan, and St. Columb-Minor, to Lower St.Columb Porth. Thjs canal was begun, but the work was abandoned after the death of Mr.Edyvean, the projector and undertaker, and what had been dug has for the most part been silled up and levelled. P. cxciii.

Edward Smith, Esq., who is one of the lessees with Mr. Williams, &c. has one eighth of the copper dues of Tywarnhaile, as appears by an advertisement from that gentleman, in the Cornwall Gazette, May 7, 18 14. \u2014 The right of raising silver in the mine of Wheal Duchy, in the manor of Calstock, was granted to John Williams, Esq., R.

A lease of the right of searching for silver, in the whole of the manor of Calstock, was granted by His Royal Highness the Prince Regent, as Duke of Cornwall, for the fame term, in the month of August 181 1, to Messrs.

Manufactures. \u2014 There are gunpowder-mills now in Cofawes wood, near Penryn, built by Mr. Gill of Penryn, about 1 8 1 o, which make about 2000 barrels annually ; and others lately erected in the parissi of Stithians, which make from 800 to 1000 barrels. The annual consumption of gunpowder in Cornwall (chiefly for mining) is calculated at 4000 barrels. Since the establissi ment of Mr. Gill's mills, the price of gunpowder, which was before wholly im ported from London, has been reduced from 61. 10s. to 5I. per hundred. There is an iron-foundery at Perran cove, in the parissi of Milor ; near Kennall wood, in the parissi of Stithians, a paper-mill belonging to Mr. Tucker, and another at Ponsneuth, in the same parissi, belonging to Mr. Rowe : there is a paper-mill also in the parissi of Lissieard. A sail-cloth manufactory was establissied at Gluvias, upon a large scale, about 1807, by Mr. Eliot, but has been discon tinued. At Perran-mill is an arsenic manufactory2 ; and at Penryn, manu factories of mustard and snuff.h P. ccxiv. The effigy of a crusader, in stone, has lately been discovered, by the removal of a pannel, in a pew of Botus-Fleming church. f This mine was discovered in searching for copper : some of the ores found in it are very rich, containing from 60 to 70 parts in 100 of pure silver ; others are much poorer, containing only 5 or 6 parts in the fame quantity of ore. The whole vein or lode is from 6 to 12 inches wide; the part containing the silver from 1 to 4, and running east and west, which is also the direction of other similar veins discovered in the same neighbourhood. (From the information of W. Williams, Esq.). i Arsenic, which is found in abundance in the mines of Cornwall, has never been applied to any use till lately, when a method of refining it was discovered, for which a patent has been obtained.

IN the foregoing parochial account we had some difficulty, with respect to the orthography of the names of villages, &c, as we have frequently found persons, whose authorities we might suppose equally good, spelling the same names differently. We have generally, wherever there has been a doubt, adopted Martyn's spelling wholly, or given it with an alias. With respect to manors and bartons, we have found many estates of the latter description, which, in all ancient records, are described as manors, but have long ceased to be deemed such ; their manerial rights, most probably, having been alienated, or lost by long disuse. With respect to the true definition of a barton, a term in general use in the two western counties of Cornwall and Devon, the best informed persons differ in their opinion ; some suppose it to be strictly confined to the demesne lands, and mansion- house of a manor ; others that it is the principal farm or grange of a manor with a house, but not the manor-house ; whilst others again give it a greater latitude, and suppose it to extend to all large farms, with houses and homesteads ; all smaller farms being called tenements. According to the first sense, every real barton, if not now esteemed a manor, must formerly have been possessed of manerial rights. It has been our plan and intention, for the obvious reason of compressing our work into a moderate compass, to treat only of manors and bartons, with the exception of such smaller tenements as have been the residence of Gentlemen's families ; in some instances, the mention of estates, not so circum- stanced, has probably, without our designing it, been introduced. In the sol- going appendix, besides giving such additional information as we have obtained since the work has been printed off, we have endeavoured to correct such errors as have arisen either from inadvertency or misinformation, and to note such changes as have taken place, during the length of time which has elapsed since we began our collections, and which the nature of the work and other circumstances have rendered unavoidable. In this we have been indebted for much assistance to Mr. John Wallis, Jun. of Bodmin, whose kind services have been already acknow- ledged ; to Mr. John Edwards of Truro, Mr. George John of Penzance, Mr. G.
