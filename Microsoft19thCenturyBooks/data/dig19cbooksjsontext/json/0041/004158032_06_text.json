Jackson published his History of the Scottish Stage in 1793 \u2014 it is very incomplete \u2014 but it seems correct as far as it goes, and it throws some light on the English Stage. In Scotland, the Presbyterian clergy were posses sed with the most illiberal and violent animosity against the stage \u2014 the magistrates kept pace with the clergy, and restricted the actors from performing within the limits of their jurisdiction \u2014 the Presby tery in a solemn deputation thanked them \" for the \"just zeal they had shown in the matter.\" Even so late as in 1727, an act of exhortation against the frequenters of stage plays was drawn up by a committee of divines, which was read from all the pulpits in the district \u2014 these violent proceedings of the clergy excited a spirit of party among the nobility and gentry, who not only made a point of supporting their theatrical amusements by forming parties for the boxes, but to preserve the performers from the prosecutions with which they were threat ened, they procured for them personal protectors \u2014 Lord Somerville told Jackson, that in order to screen a principal performer from molestation, he had been obliged to receive him into his house as butler. Jackson says \u2014 \" In the time of Charles the 2d \" when the Duke of York took up his residence in \" Holyrood house, a party of performers from his \" company and by his command, attended him thither"], [130, "120 SCOTTISH STAGE. \" \u2014to this Dryden alludes in one of his Prologues to \" the University of Oxford \u2014 \" Our brethren are from Thames to Tweed \" departed, \" And of our Sisters, all the kinder-hearted, \" To Edinburgh gone, or coach'd or carted.\" Jackson is not so accurate as he might have been \u2014 the company, which was formed by the Duke's command for Scotland, consisted of such performers as could be procured from either house \u2014 Dryden's Prologue was certainly written for the King's com pany, as it was the King's company, and not the Duke's, which used to perform at Oxford \u2014 Dryden begins thus \u2014 \" Discord and plots, which have undone our age, \" With the same ruin have o'erwhelm'd the stage. '\u2022 Our house has suffer'd in the common woe, \" We have been troubled with Scotch rebels too.\" Then follow the lines quoted by Jackson \u2014 after which Dryden adds \u2014 \" With bonny bluecap there they act all night \" For Scotch half-crown, in English three-pence \" hight. \" One nymph, to whom fat Sir John Falstaffs \" lean, \" There with her single person fills the scene. \" Another, with long use and age decay'd, \" Div'd here old woman, and rose there a maid. \" Our trusty door-keepers of former time \" There strut and swagger in heroic rhime."], [131, "121 SCOTTISH STAGE. \" But why should I these renegrades describe?\" Another Prologue, spoken before the long Vaca tion, concludes thus, \u2014 \" Else we must troop to Scotland after Joe \u2014 \" We by the last advice for certain hear \" That Haynes does head the rebell-players there.\" Ravenscroft published this Prologue with his Titus Andronicus in 1687, but it was not the Prologue to that play \u2014 and it was certainly written some years before it was printed. Joe Haynes belonged to the King's company \u2014 it is impossible that Dryden, or Ravenscroft, should have called any of the Duke's company rebels for having gone into Scotland by their Master's orders. The Duke of York went to reside in Scotland the latter end of 1679 \u2014 he came to court on Feb. 24 1680\u2014 he returned to Scotland Oct. 20 1680\u2014 he continued there till about March l682\u2014(Rapin) \u2014 Dryden's Prologue at Oxford was probably spoken in the vacation \u2014 and the plays acted at Holyrood house, were probably acted in the summer of 1681 \u2014 the Prologue to Thyestes 1681 mentions that some of the actors had been into Scotland \u2014 this Prologue was spoken by one of the King's company. From the period of the Duke of York's residence in Scotland till after the troubles in 1715, no thea trical representations were attempted there. The first adventurer we hear of, was Signora Vio lante, who on her return from Dublin, by way of"], [132, "122 SCOTTISH STAGE. Port Patrick, paid a visit to Edinburgh, and exhibited her feats of tumbling, &c\u2014 the success, she met with on this occasion, encouraged her to collect a company of Comedians in England, with which she returned to Edinburgh. Itinerant performers after this exhibited in Mer chant Taylors Hall \u2014 from the violence of the opposers and the exertions of the supporters of the stage, this place was soon perceived to be too small, on parti cular occasions, to contain the audiences that applied for admission. Some performers, with Mrs. Ward, a favourite actress, at their head, at length found means to pro cure subscriptions towards the erection of a regular theatre \u2014 and the tradesmen, encouraged by the promise of a partial payment, were induced to pro ceed upon credit, on an assurance of being paid out of the future profits. By these means a new theatre was erected on the south side of the Canon-gate ; the first stone was laid by Ryan the actor in 1746 \u2014 this first regular theatrical establishment in Scotland was still without the sanction of the law, and even in defiance of an act of Parliament \u2014 several performers from London paid occasional visits to Edinburgh \u2014 among these was Lee, who, being a favourite with the town, found it no difficult matter to purchase the theatre. (Jackson.) When Lee was on his road to Edinburgh, he hap pened to meet with Garrick at an inn, which being small, they were both shown into the same room Garrick asked Lee whither he was going ? and on being answered, to the North, Garrick said \u2014 \" What"], [133, "SCOTTISH STAGE. 123 \" do you in the North, when you should serve your \" sovereign in the South ? \" \u2014 Lee replied, that he was going to be sovereign himself. (Lee Lewes' Memoirs.) Lee being unable to make good his contracts with respect to pecuniary matters, the theatre became the property of some of the Lords of Session and other gentlemen, who invested Callender, a merchant, with the management \u2014 Digges and Mrs. Ward were the principal performers \u2014 Callender after some time retired with loss, and was succeeded by Love and Beatt. Besides Love, who was acting manager, there were in the company Stamper, Griffith, Parsons and Lan cashire \u2014 Mrs. Mozeen was the heroine. For Griffith see Irish Stage S. A. 176O-I76I. Lancashire possessed a great fund of dry humour and filled Shuter's line in low Comedy ; he was a favourite with the public. On Jan. 9th 1762 Jackson made his 1st app. on the stage in Oroonoko \u2014 he next played Romeo, and afterwards Douglas to Digges' Old Norval \u2014 Jaffier to his Pierre and Juba to his Cato \u2014 towards the close of the season, Mrs. Bellamy was engaged for 8 nights \u2014 she acted Sigismunda, Estifania, Alicia, Lady Townly, Monimia, Juliet and Lady Macbeth. (Jackson.) Mrs. Bellamy, who for several years wished to have it understood that she was married to Mr. Cal craft \u2014 either at this time or previously to it, formed what she is pleased to term a serious connection with Digges\u2014 they played together at Smock Alley in I760- 1761\u2014 she had been particularly warned against"], [134, "124 SCOTTISH STAGE. him as a man of gallantry, but it seems the fates would have it so \u2014 \" For when weak women go astray \" The Stars are more in fault than they.\" Digges carried his politeness so far as to assume her name, and at Edinburgh in 1764 Romeo and Juliet was thus advertised \u2014 Juliet = Mrs. Bellamy (for her name always stood first in the bills :) Romeo = Mr. Bellamy : \u2014 the case was the same through the whole season \u2014 Wilkinson at that time arrived in Edinburgh upon speculation \u2014 the managers having made their arrangements were not much inclined to engage him, but by Mrs. Bellamy's persuasion he delayed his departure for a few days, as she assured him something would happen to his advantage \u2014 Digges, who was in debt and afraid of being arrested, decamped on the ensuing Sunday evening \u2014 and the managers were next day glad to engage Wilkinson on his own terms Mrs. Bellamy was by her agree ment to have 2 benefits \u2014 the 1st was the Funeral. Trim = Wilkinson : Campley = Aikin : Lady Brump ton = Mrs. Bellamy : \u2014 the 2d was the Orphan of China. Zamti = Wilkinson : Etan = Aikin : Mandane = Mrs. Bellamy : \u2014 Wilkinson for his 1st benefit had the Way to keep him \u2014 Tragedy a-la-Mode and Duke and no Duke \u2014 he acted Lovemore, Golcondus and Trappolin \u2014 Mrs. Bellamy was Mrs. Belmour \u2014 for his 2d benefit he acted King Lear. ( Wilkinson and Mrs. Bellamy.) Love was engaged at D. L. in 1762-1763\u2014 on his resignation Dowson became joint-manager with Beatt \u2014 in the winter of I766-I767 Stayley, who had been"], [135, "125 SCOTTISH STAGE. deservedly discharged from Smock Alley in I76O 1761 \u2014 (see Irish Stage)\u2014 was the cause of a riot \u2014 the inside of the theatre was demolished, the move ables were ransacked, and the fixtures destroyed \u2014 for particulars see Jackson. The gentlemen proprietors brought an action of damages against those concerned in the riot, in which their property was destroyed \u2014 the latter, with great address, traversed it by a counter-action against the proprietors, for having plays acted in their house, contrary to act of Parliament \u2014 many of those pro prietors were now raised to the bench, hardly a quorum remained to decide the question \u2014 the ludi crousness of the case was perceived, and both actions were dropped.

Jackson, about the time in which he became ma nager at Edinburgh, built a new theatre at Glasgow within the city \u2014 the seasons of performing were so settled, that one company of performers supplied both houses.

During the short period in which Jackson was obliged to retire, from July 21 to Aug. 21, the com pany continued at Edinburgh and Glasgow under the direction of King, whose theatrical exertions were assisted by those of Miss Farren.

Ire land meeting with Porson, afterwards Greek Pro fessor at Cambridge, and Dr. Burgess, afterwards Bishop of St. David's, desired them to come to his house and see the MSS., which they did\u2014 Porson told me as far as he could judge he thought the MSS. spurious, but that he did not wish to have given any opinion about them \u2014 S. Ireland had prepared a paper to this effect \u2014 \" We whose names are underwritten \" believe these to be genuine MSS.,\" &c. \u2014 to this he asked Porson if he had any objection to put his name \u2014 Porson had a peculiar knack of parrying a ques tion which he did not choose to answer \u2014 but at last he was pressed so home, that he was obliged to say, \" I detest subscriptions of all kinds, but more espe \" cially to Articles of Faith.\" Some time after this, a letter was published signed England, in which the writer pretended to have found in an old trunk some Manuscript plays of Sophocles ; and of which he presented the public with a specimen in 13 lines \u2014 these lines were the old song of \" Three children sliding on the ice \" trans lated into Greek Iambics \u2014 they were attributed to Porson.

Ireland as the publisher of these MSS. was by many persons considered as the fabricator of them \u2014 W. H. Ireland, in order to vindicate his Father from this imputation, printed a pamphlet, in 1796 in which he acknowledged himself the forger of all these MSS. \u2014 the papers themselves, and the circumstances attending their production, had so highly excited the public curiosity, that the whole edition of the Younger Ireland's pamphlet was disposed of in some few hours \u2014 and, sometime afterwards, it became so scarce, that a single impression, instead of the origi nal price of one shilling, was sold at an auction for a Guinea. W. H. Ireland in a subsequent publication says, that after his pamphlet was printed, it was boldly asserted by all the believers in the MSS., that the individual who had written it could never have been the author of the language to be found throughout the Shaksperian productions \u2014 he adds, that the praises bestowed on the first paper which he pro duced as the composition of Shakspeare, operated so strongly on his vanity, as to get the better of every other consideration \u2014 and the suggestion frequently thrown out that more papers of Shakspeare might be"], [258, "248 VORTIGERN. found by referring to the same source, induced him to proceed\u2014 he observes, that the gentlemen, who came to inspect the papers, had themselves to blame for the variety of productions which came forth \u2014 and that if any person had minutely compared the writing of the first production, with those MSS. which were penned after he had acquired a facility in committing to paper the disguised hand, he must instantly have discovered the difference. In 1797 Chalmers published in about 600 pages 8vo. an Apology for the Believers \u2014 in which he con troverted almost all of Malone's arguments \u2014 he after wards published a Supplement consisting of more than 500 pages. It is particularly to be observed that the name of the Gentleman, who was said to have given young Ireland the Shakspeare-papers was studiously con cealed \u2014 a circumstance which ought to have made every person, not indeed an unbeliever, but a skeptic \u2014 whatever appearance of authenticity there might be in the MSS. themselves. In 1805 W. H. Ireland printed his \"Confessions,\" in which he candidly gives a full account of the pro gress of the forgery \u2014 but he is so far from having a proper sense of the crime of which he had been guilty, that he speaks of the labyrinth of perplexity, in which he had so innocently involved himself\u2014 he seems to think that his having been a youth, or, as he chooses to call himself, a boy of 17 years and half old, when he began the MSS., was a sufficient excuse for what he had done Youth is certainly an ex tenuation for many things which strictly speaking are"], [259, "VORTIGERN. 249 wrong \u2014 but forgery cannot at any age be considered as a venial offence, and is peculiarly opposite to that ingenuousness, which is generally the characteristic of youth Paley observes, there is something in falsehood mean and base, abstracted from any mis chief which may ensue.

Ireland has the unparalleled effrontery to express a hope, that nothing contained in his \"Con \" sessions \" may tend to his detriment in the estima tion of the public\u2014 to which Malone might have replied in the words of Juvenal \u2014 \" Quamvis jurato tnetuam tibi credere testi.\" W. H. Ireland has certainly made a fair confession \u2014 but as he has expressed little or no contrition, he is clearly not entitled to absolution \u2014 if he had been a sincere penitent, Fletcher would have furnished him with a most apposite conclusion to his book \u2014 \" I beseech thee to be waru'd by me, \" And do not lie ! \u2014 if any man should ask thee, \" But how thou dost, or what o'clock 'tis noio, \" Be sure thou do not lie ! \" For they above (that are entirely truth) \" Will make that seed which thou hast sown of \" lies, \" Yield miseries a thousand-fold \" Upon thine head, as they have done on mine.\" Cupid's Revenge.

Kemble seems to have been fully convinced that the piece was spurious\u2014 and to Ireland's desire that he would make such alterations as he judged neces sary, he very properly replied, that the play would be acted faithfully from the copy sent to the theatre.

The use of the Mask on the Greek and Latin stage was a vile contrivance, as it precluded all change of countenance\u2014 if Garrick and Mrs. Sid- dons had acted in a mask, they would have been upon a level with other first rate performers\u2014 it was the expression of countenance which gave them a decided superiority \u2014 the mask however had its con- veniences \u2014 it prevented what we too often see on the English stage \u2014 an old character with a young face, and vice versa \u2014 to Roscius himself it was of singular advantage, as he squinted so confoundedly, that in a modern theatre, all his talents would not, without difficulty, have overcome that natural defect.
