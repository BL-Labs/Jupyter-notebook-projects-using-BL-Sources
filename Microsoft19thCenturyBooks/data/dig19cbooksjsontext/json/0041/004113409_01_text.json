These Bands seem to have been first instituted in 1580, from which date there were periodically elected by the Town Council, sixteen citizens representing the Merchants and Crafts, to be Captains of the sixteen companies of the regiment, also one Lieutenant, one Ensign, and two Sergeants to each Captain, making in all forty-eight commissioned officers and thirty-two Sergeants, or a total of eighty commissioned and non commissioned officers. The Captains elected annually one of their number to be the \" Commandant,\" afterwards styled \" Moderator,\" and they also elected one of their number to be their Clerk for a year. On the admission of each Captain to office, the City Captains, as they were called, held a social gathering, where the member was admitted into the Body in a peculiar fashion, examples of which will be found in the volume ; and from the Tavern Bills of the Body which have been preserved, specimens of which also will be"], [16, "Preface. 12 found here, it would appear that on these occasions a considerable quantity of claret, Madeira, sherry, old hock, Burgundy, Lisbon, brandy, gin, punch, porter, and beer were consumed ; and from the quantity of broken glass and china charged in the bills, it is presumed that the drinking of certain toasts \u2014 probably those of Royalty and other distinguished personages \u2014 involved the destruction of the glass in which the toast was pledged. Interspersed with the Extracts from the Minute Book the Editor has inserted, chronologically, excerpts from documents, not hitherto printed, connected with the Corporation of Edinburgh. For the first time the \" Orange Colours \" has been lithographed in colours exactly as it appears at present, showing several of its defects from age and decay. The other Insignia of the Society have also been lithographed for the first time, and all are shown in this volume. In conclusion, I have to tender my thanks to Mr Adam Horsburgh Campbell, lately Surveyor and Draughtsman in the office of the Edinburgh Burgh Engineer, \u2014 now Burgh Surveyor of Stratford-on-Avon, \u2014 for the interesting Map of Edinburgh prefixed to this volume, showing the Sixteen Wards of the City, with their distinctive colours, which were watched or guarded by the Sixteen Companies of the Trained Bands respectively, from the year 1685, and also showing the various extensions of the City of Edinburgh since that period to the present time.

IT does not seem necessary to enter fully into detaiis of the various arrangements for the watching and other police arrangements of the City of Edinburgh, farther than to say, that from the year 1607, the prac tice of guarding the town by means of a hired watch pre vailed, down to the year 1625 \u2014 when the ancient method of watching by the burgesses and inhabitants was reverted to by the Magistrates and Council by their Act of Council of 19th October of that year. With this view, the city was divided into twenty-six watches, according to the number xni'Jm\"0'*' of constables dwelling and appointed within the burgh and ports; and each watch or \"constable's pairt \" as it was termed, was ordered to watch \" ilk nicht thair time about.\" Proclamation was ordained to be made charging the burgesses and inhabitants, in name of the king and of the Council, to \"compeir as thai ar wairnit ilk man in his awin constable's pairt in the Nether Tolbuith of the burgh, at nyne houres at nycht, to answer to thair names, as thai sal"], [18, "The Trained Bands of Edinburgh. 14 be callit be the baillies or constable of his pairt, with suffi cient airmour, and not depairt therefra till fyve houres in the morning vnder the paine of ane unlau of fyve pundis, to be payit be the contravenar toties quoties; and this ordour to begin vpoune the 25th of October instant.\" In the following year (1626) a new watching organisation History of F.din- was resolved upon, and it is regarded by Arnot, as the burgh, p. 504. origin of the Trained Bands of the City. An Act, dated 8th Council Records February 1626, referring to the foreign wars then existing, XIII., 324. J the possibility of invasion, and the necessity of being pre- pared for defence, appointed the whole inhabitants to be divided into eight companies of 200 men each, and to be regularly exercised and disciplined. Two commanders, with other officers of war, were appointed to each company, and the commanders were required, by personal visitation at the houses of the whole men of their company, to see that they were provided with arms, reporting defaulters to the Magistrates. The men of high stature and physical strength were ordered to carry a pike, and to be provided with corslet, lancellot, and head piece ; those of less stature, a musket, with bandalier and head piece, lead, pouther, and match. In this organisation no distinction was made be- tween the merchants and craftsmen. All were dealt with simply as burgesses, but the relative rights and privileges of the merchants and craftsmen were reserved. On 9th April 1627, the City youths were ordered to be formed into two companies, that of the merchants to march Council Records jn the yan> and fa^ Qf fche crasts jn the rear Qf Trajned Bands. \"rgh7P\u00b0f4din\" Maitland, however, is of opinion, that beyond selecting officers, and issuing orders preparatory to the formation of the inhabitants into companies, the arrangements sketched out in these Acts of Council were not carried into effect."], [19, "The Trained Bands of Edinburgh 15 This opinion he founds on the fact that, in 1634, an appli cation was made to Charles I. for authority to distribute the inhabitants into companies, and that his Majesty be fore proceeding farther, required the Magistrates \"to erect within your Citie such several companies as you intend ; and so to fitt the way thairof, that it may appear that your intentiounes are reall.\" What followed upon that letter, Maitland states his inability to learn, adding that he reads \"not anything concerning the same till 1645,\" when the citizens were \" erected into sixteen companies.\" It is to be observed however, that in 1637, the Council are found electing officers, not only for the company of merchant ..,.,,. Council Records. youths, but for other companies of the inhabitants, andxv, 12. between that date and 1645, frequent reference is made to town's companies as actually existing. Of this date, an Act of Council was passed, which, after '9th March ,6-*5 referring to the urgent necessity that existed for having a strong nightly watch, ordained \u2014 \" Proclamation to pass throw this brugh be sound of drum, commanding and charging . . . according to their several companies, keip and attend the said watch the tyme foresaid, under the paine of fyve pundis for the first fault, ten pundis for the second, and farder punishment of thaire persone at the will of the magistrats . . . that all the inhabitants of this brugh be in readiness to marche furth for dreilling under their severall commanderis and collouris, to the places accustomed, at the towk of the drum at sex ...... . i.i \u2022 re 1 \u25a0 Council Records, in the cloak in the morning, under the paine of lyve pundis xvi., ,s. to be payit be ilk person sail failzie.\" Subsequently, by an Act dated 9th May 1645, the Council remodelled the whole arrangements of the Trained Bands. The town was divided into sixteen parts, and from each part a company was drawn. Of these companies, ten"], [20, "Tlie Trained Bands of Edinburgh. 16 captains were appointed to be merchants and six crafts men, and each captain was ordered to have a craftsman as his lieutenant. The ensigns and sergeants of all the com panies were to be selected equally from the merchants and Council Records, craftsmen. On 21st May 1645, accordingly, the sixteen captains were elected, several of the commanders of the old council Records, companies having previously resigned ; and on the 26th of May the lieutenants, ensigns, and sergeants were appointed. On 22nd September 1648, the Council passed an Act, under which they agreed, with Lieutenant-Colonel Affleck, upon the conditions and pay therein mentioned, that he should keep up a company consisting of three-score soldiers, with a lieutenant, two sergeants, and three corporals, who should be obliged to keep day and night watch, as they should receive orders from the Magistrates. This company of soldiers, appears to have been the origin of the regular Town Guard, co-existing with the Trained Bands of the City, Council Records, a'l \u00b0f whom were often called out in arms on important XVII., 124. . . . . . r _ occasions \u2014 such as the sitting of Parliament, the execution 2. st March i649. of influential personages like the Marquis of Huntly, etc. Proclamation was made on 25th July 1662, requiring the Council Records, inhabitants to attend their commanders, for mounting the XXI., 143. guard nightly.

On 15th July 1664, a committee was appointed to meet, anent the best way of keeping and paying a constant guard of twenty or thirty men, for the preservation of the peace Council Records, . . . . , XXII., 90. during the night. On 13th July 1666, the captains were appointed to Council Records, \" begin to keep the watch, this day eight dayes.\" From an early period in the seventeenth century, the Council were in the practice of electing constables annually, and these, when the Society of Captains in June 1663 received its constitution, served and watched the city, under the members of that Society. On 28th May 1669, the bailies were appointed to con- sider, whether it is fitter to continue the captain's guard, or to appoint that of the constable's. Their report is not given, but the former practice seems to have been adhered to, the watch being kept by the town's companies, under the command of their respective captains, relieved occa sionally by a guard of the neighbours, under the charge of the constables. Obviously however, the irksome duty of watching was performed by the citizens in a very unsatisfactory manner, and the records of the Council contain various orders intended to provide a remedy. Thus an Act, dated 1st December 1669, setting forth that the neglect of the citi zens to keep guard, or the employment by them of hire lings to do so, had led to the breaking open of shops and houses, and the disquietude of the city, ordained all the neighbours, by themselves or by their actual servants, to attend their respective captain's guard in future, and punctually to watch during the whole time appointed to them, under the penalty of \u00a3$ Scots, and farther punish- ment at the discretion of the Council."], [26, "TJie Trained Bands of Edinburgh. 22 Council Records XXVIII., 224. Another Act in November 1676, alluding to the practice of the citizens appointed to attend the guard absenting themselves from that duty, without even providing substi tutes, ordained that, whenever the guard should not turn out in sufficient force to protect the city, the captain on duty should be held responsible for the fines of the absen tees, reserving his relief against them. And by another Act in December 1676, the Council are found recommend ing the bailies, to enforce the Act rigidly against the cap tains of the various companies. Still the neglect con tinued, and in February 1677 the Council renewed their Act of 17th June 1663, and appointed Robert Johnston, the fown's major, to be Inquisitor of the Watch Rolls, taking him bound to pay into the Guard Box six shillings Scots for each absentee, from whom he was entitled to exact eighteen shillings Scots for his own relief and payment. The appointment of an Inquisitor at this time, was made at the request of the Society of Captains, whose minute of 5th February 1677 refers to \"the great trouble that they are att, by poynding of the neighbours for not mounting of the guaird.\" With these preliminary explanations, we now come to the period when the minutes of the Society of Captains come to be entered in a Minute Book, commencing in November 1676.

William Dundas the parole in"], [63, "The Trained Bands of Edinburgh. 59 Act 14t the most solemn manner ; yet the ensigne appeared not on the guard y' night till ten of the cloach, at which time Captn. Dundas ordered out the drum, and half hour after ten, came the leutennant (being severall times sent for by the ensigne), and being desired by the captn. to sett out the sentries, he and the ensigne, in a mutinous manner, re tired and called the rolls, and the captn. desiring both sub alterns to sett the sentries upon the Tolbuith, the leveten nant answered he would receive commands from no captn. save Captn. Robertson, and so went out of guard. The ensigne the very same way disobeyed the captain, with the agravation that he wrapped the roll up, and put it in his pochett when the captn. desired it. Upon all this, the captain, partly from ane uncommon spirit, and partely from a compassion to the exceeding folly of the two imginary captains (for so they mutually saluted others), was willing to pass from what the law of arms would have advised for crubing the insolence of such noto rious offenders, went to the Lord Provost's lodgeing, who, being in bed, desired the captn., by his lady, to gett sentries from the captn. of the guard ; but, in the meantime, the levetennant and ensigne sent out sentries, and the leiveten nant went off from the guard with such of the neighbour hood as he could persuade to goe with him, but the ensigne stayed sometime longer, to shew his art in counteracting the captain, and frustrating the very designe of keeping guard.

Dundas yet its evident the Lord Provost has noe small share in it, for every disobedience of sub alterns against their commanding officer does, of its own nature, reach the fountain power. If it is answered by the subalterns that Captn. Dundas was not their captn., and soe they were not subject to his command, we reply, first, that by ye custome of the brough and society, non but a captain is to receive the parole from the Lord Provost, and in stances can be given, where subalterns goeing to Sir Samuel M'Lelan to receive the paroll, were rejected. But 2d, to show the vanity of this pretence, nothing can be more evident that every captn. comissioned by the Lord Provost, collonel, is superior to every levetennant upon the place of dewty ; otherwayes, a detachment out of severall companys under one captain should be a monster in nature, and yet nothing more modish in our age.

That att the time of makeing and advising of their Acts, the captains of the several companys where dispenced with from the necessitie of a march in parade at the head of theire companys throw the City upon public occations, by which means they saved a dale of money, whereas now, they are under the same obligations to march as formerly, and are putt to the expence of intertainments, and a great dale of charges and expences oy'wise.

Upon this, Sir Laurence named the 25th day of August ; and next day, on the commandant consulting the corps, they all chearfully agreed to the appointment. Orders were accordingly given to the serjeant to summon the corps to meet on the said 25th of August, at 3 o'clock afternoon, in Fortune's Tavern, and each captain to bear at his button-hole a ribbon denoting the colours of his com pany. In consequence of what is narrated above, the Corps of Captains met Sir Laurence Dundas and the Magistrates, with several gentlemen who were invited, at Fortune's at three o'clock. At the outer entry two grenadiers were placed with muskets and fixed bayonets, who received each captain and guest with their arms rested. At the door of the tavern two serjeants of the Orange Company with antient battle-axes were stationed, and at the door of the dining room the serjeant-major with an antient pike. The commandant and captains received their guests in proper form, each bearing a ribbon denoting the colours of his company.

There an elegant desert was provided, and several noblemen, gentle men, and respectable citizens, by invitation from the Lord Provost, attended. His Lordship, in honour of the day, gave the King, Queen, Prince of Wales, and many other loyall toasts, accompanied with music and volleys of the City musketry, after which the company adjourned. In the evening the corps again muster'd in house of Mrs Fortune, and at supper were honoured with the company of the Lord Provost, Magistrates, severall of the Town Coun cil, and other extraordinary captains. The meeting was very social and happy under the presiding of the command ant, who, in honour of the Chancellor of Exchequer, gave Pitt as password for the night.

A spirit of licentiousness appearing among some of the lowest order of the people, occasioned the corps, from the necessary steps being taken for preserv ing the peace, to be later than usual of sitting down to supper. However, the magistrates having taken proper precautions, no material disturbance took place. The corps was upon this occasion, the anniversary of His Majesty's birth, honoured with the company of the Lord Provost, Magistrates, and many of the Town Council.

In consquence of a motion offer'd by Command' Walter Lothian, Esq'., the above captains readily and cordially agreed to serve in the corps for another year, which offer was very thankfully received by the whole body.

The company assembled for the above purpose was numerous, martial uniform its distinguished feature, being principally composed of the different bodies of Royal Edinburgh and other volunteers.

In the evening the corps supped in the Tontine Tavern, and were honored with the company of the Lord Provost, Magistrates, and several other persons of distinction. Lieut-Col1. Hay, of the 2d batt. 2 reg' of R.E.V., and other military officers of rank, also obliged the corps with their presence. The commandant presided with unusual gaiety and credit to the corps, and gave \" The King \" for the watchword, which went round with heartfelt satisfaction. At this meet ing many excellent toasts were given, patriotism pervaded every bosom, and, although it expressed itself by much good humour, the company failed not to break up in its wonted good order. God save the King. (Signed) John Young, jun\\, Licu'-Colonel and Secretary. Edinburgh, 5\"' February 1798. \u2014 At the annual election of the members of Council, the Lord Provost and Magis trates, having been pleased to appoint William Phin, Esquire, Commandant of the Trained Bands, in the room of Mr Gilchrist, promoted, he was this day introduced to the Company of Captains, who were met to receive him. He took post at their head, and did the honors of the day with much propriety. The corps felt it an indispensible duty to record by their minutes, that no election ever gave it more satisfaction than the appointment of this gentleman to command them. At this meeting it was observed that, since the formation of the first regiment of Royal Edinburgh Volunteers in 1795, the civil power had not found it necessary to call the Trained Bands to its aid, and that it would not be improper for the company to consider whether it should request the Council to suspend its functions during the existence of the"], [118, "The Trained Bands of Edinburgh. 112 Act 414, volunteers, more especially when it was remarked that all the officers of the Trained Bands were, in one shape or other, connected with some of the military bodies, associ ated for the defence of their King and of their country. This observation was not made from the more distant wish to loosen the bonds of obligation of service, but from an earnest desire not to give unnecessary trouble to the Council. The question, however, being of a very delicate nature, and demanding particular attention, a committee (consisting of the Commandant, William Phin, Esq1., Lieu'- Col'., John Young, jun1\"., Major William Raeburn, and Cap tains Simpson, Bonnar, and Walker,) was appointed to consider the propriety of the measure, and to report its opinion at the first general meeting. Agreeably thereto, the committee met on the 12th of the month, and gave the subject the discussion it merited. After several ingenious remarks, and a careful review of the minutes since 1676, which furnished many excellent and incontestible proofs of the good services which the Trained Bands had rendered to the civil power, the committee was of opinion that no appli cation whatever should be made to the Council, and that, however much it regretted the trouble the annual elections of officers now gave to the Magistracy, and however forcibly the conviction of the inutility of the co-existence of the Trained Bands with the other regular and well-drilled regi ments of Royal Edinburgh Volunteers was impressed on its mind, still it determined that the laurels obtained by the institution should not wither in their hands, and that, as the present officers were as willing to fulfill the duties of their stations as any of their predecessors, the committee judged the attempt to shrink from these would be disgrace ful. This opinion was, in due course, laid before the next general meeting, and unanimously approved of. As usual, therefore, the lett of the five officers who annually retire, with the names of their proposed successors, was given by the commandant to the Council on the 14 February 1798. The presenting of this leet brought the idea of the Trained Bands in full view before the members of Council, and his"], [119, "Tlie Trained Bands of Edinburgh. 113 Act 414. Lordship was pleased to remark, that the present officers of the Trained Bands merited the thanks of the community in a superior degree, as they were acting both in the stations which were assigned to them by the Magistracy and as volunteers in the other regiments. His Lordship was pleased to add that he felt much pleasure in giving this public tes timony of his approbation of the conduct of all the corps, but in particular that of the captains (now more particularly before him), and concluded by saying that he thought that the services of the whole body should be dispensed with during the existence of the R. E. Volunteers, or during the pleasure of the Council. His Lordship having made a motion to that purport, it carried unanimously. The fol lowing is a verbatim copy of the extract concerning it : \u2014 \"At Edinburgh 14 February 1798. \" Which day the Right Honb'e The Lord Provost, Magis trates and Council of the City of Edinburgh being assembled \u2014There was produced in Council a list of citizens, pro posed to be Captains in the City's Company of Train Bands instead of those going out of office, and the Council suspend the appointing of officers for the Train Bands of the City during the subsistence of the Royal Edinburgh Volunteers or the pleasure of the Council. \" Extracted from the Council Record by (Signed) \" James Laing, Dep. C.C.\" The commandant having laid the above before the cap tains, they warmly expressed their obligations to the Coun cil, and they requested him to assure it, that they would willingly assume their stations at the first call of the Magis tracy, and they entreated their commandant to take the liberty to represent to the Council that their officer would be the only sufferer by the suspension, and that they begged the Council would be pleased to allow him some trifle annually."], [120, "The Trained Bands of Edinburgh. 114 Act 414 The following is the Extract concerning this business : \u2014 \" At Edinburgh, the twenty-eight day of February, One thousand seven hundred and ninety-eight. \" Which day the Right Honble the Lord Provost, Magis trates, and Council of the City of Edinburgh being assem bled, \u2014 Read letter from the Captain of Orange Colours of the City's Train Bands, addressed to the City Chamber lain, which is of the following tenor, \u2014 ' Dear Sir, \u2014 The gentlemen of the Train Bands, while they are sensible of the obligations the Lord Provost and Magistrates have laid upon them under, by a suspension of their services for a time, have requested me to solicit that his Lordship and Council will have the goodness to allow the officers belong ing to each corps a small sum annually (suppose a guinea), in lieu of the gratuities they received from the gentlemen, which might be from twenty-five shillings to forty shillings. This favor, they flatter themselves, will not be denied them, as, independent of the advantage the good town derives from the suspension of the corps, they trust his Lordship and the Council will not refuse this only request to a society who have always shown their readiness and zeal to support peace and good order in the city. \" If you will take the trouble to lay this before his Lord ship and the committee, you will very much oblige, dear Sir, yours, etc., (Signed) ' WM Phin, C.O.C Which, having been considered by the Magistrates, they granted the desire thereof, and authorised the City Cham berlain to pay to each of the present officers of the City's Train Bands one guinea annually during their lives. Ex trated by (Signed) \" James LAING, DepA These minutes being laid before the captains at a general meeting on the fourth day of March by Mr Phin, the Com pany considered their duties at an end ; but could not part without attempting to pay to Thomas Hay, Esq., their"], [121, "The Trained Bands of Edinburgh. 115 Act 414 tribute of thanks for his eighteen years obliging services. They well know that no record on their books can add to his character, but they hope he will esteem this as a mark of their regard to him. To advance to their learned and very worth) chaplain, the Rev. Dr Macknight, with any appearance of adequate expression, for the good he has done them for ten years, both by his example and precept, the captains well know is in vain. They therefore briefly thank him in the letter of the word. Nor can the Company separate without re viewing the conduct of their sergeant, John Cameron, which affords them much pleasure. They regard, too, that he will receive this public testimony of their approbation of his long and faithful services. The internal concerns of the Company being now ad- justed, and the duration of its suspension very uncertain, it is judged proper to give the reason of this measure, as the minutes have but barely hinted at it. It proceeds from the Revolution in France having overturned the throne, murdered the sovereign of that country, and driven with a daring arm the happiest to beggary or migration. From their various directors silently disseminating their ruinous principles in Britain (while they were engaged in war with their neighbouring powers), principles of such a nature as to blast indiscriminately the prosperity of the palace and the contentment of the cottage, \u2014 our ever watchful Go- vernment unmasked their designs, and forced them to attempt our ruin by open hostility. At a very early period of the war, the City of Edinburgh led the way in loyal ex- pression of their attachment to their king and their country, and was the first in the island to associate for the defence of our invaluable liberty. One regiment of 700 volunteers was soon formed, and served without pay, the good effect of which was instantly felt in counteracting and exposing the destructive levelling principles. The French arms proving victorious on the continent, the merit of which is as much to be ascribed to the effects of their ideal (and never realised) schemes of happiness, as their valour, they shook"], [122, "T/ic Trained Bands of Edinburgh. 116 Act 414. Act 415. to the centre several thrones of Europe, and, in the height of their folly, twice refused us peace on honourable terms. Such a cruel and vindictive spirit fretting at the comfort and blessings we enjoyed, swore in its wrath, that the two Governments should not exist together, and immediately commenced formidable preparations to invade us. At this period it became every Briton to rally round the throne. Edinburgh again was foremost, and in a few weeks its volun teers were upwards of 3000. It was at this time that the Lord Provost proposed the suspension of the Trained Bands, as he saw that the officers, wishing more active engage ments,had enrolled themselves in the different military corps. The Captains of the Trained Bands feel, in common with their fellow-subjects, the pleasure of standing forward in the defence of their King and their country, but will, at the same time, be always ready to resume their stations as officers of the Trained Bands of the City.

Note. \u2014 From this date (14th February 1798), in conse quence of the threatened invasion by France, and the forma tion of \"The Royal Edinburgh Volunteers,\" the Magistrates and Town Council suspended the appointment of Officers of the Train Bands during their pleasure. Between 1798 and 1850, there are no Minutes of the suspended Society of Captains, but the Magistrates and Council, in 1848, appointed William Wilson, Bookseller in Edinburgh, Captain of Orange Colours, and Commandant of the Train Bands, and they continue to make this appointment annually, and the said Commandant until recently pre sented to the Magistrates and Council, at their annual dinner, a \"riddle of claret.\" The Commandant, during the tenure of his office, is custodier of the Colours of the Train Bands, Snuff-box, Tobacco Pipe and Pipe Case, which belonged to the Society, and the Silver Cup presented to the Council by Commandant Wilson.
