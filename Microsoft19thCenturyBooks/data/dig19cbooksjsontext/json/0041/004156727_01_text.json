It has justly been observed, that Nations, as well as particular Persons, have their Infancy, in which they are not only small and weak, but also rude and ignorant. Even those Nations which have arrived at the highest degree of power and great- ness, and have been most renowned for all the at- tributes of Civilization, when traced up to their infant state, are found to have been equally feeble and illiterate. We need not, therefore, be sur- prised to find, nor ashamed to own, that there was a time, when the Inhabitants of this Island were divided into a great many petty States or Tribes, each of them consisting of rude unlettered Savages.\" The Historians of all those Empires which have become great and eminent, have taken much pains in discovering and describing the progress of their arms, the enlargement of their territories, 1 Henry's Hist, of Great Brit. vol. 1. p. 245, et passim."], [20, "VIII preface. and the increase of their power and grandeur; but, unhappily, they have not taken the same pains in tracing and delineating the cultivation of their in tellectual faculties, and their gradual improve ments in Learning and useful Knowledge. While the exploits of every victorious Prince and General, who had contributed to the aggrandizement of his Country, have been recorded with the greatest care, and extolled with the highest praises ; the very names of those peaceful Sages, who had enlarged the empire of reason, had improved the minds, and polished the manners of their Fellow- Citizens, have hardly found a place in the Annals of their Country. It is impossible that Learning can flourish, in any degree, in any Country, without Schools for the Education of Youth, provided with proper Teachers, and under proper Regulations. We may therefore conclude in general, that the ancient Britons had such Seminaries of Learning among them, before they were conquered by the Romans. Of this we have also sufficient positive evidence in the Greek and Roman Writers, and information of several particulars relating to the constitution and circumstances of these most ancient Estab lishments, both in Gaul and Britain. It appears from these Writers, that those Schools of Learn ing were wholly under the direction of the Druids, who were the only governors and teachers in them, to whose care the education of youth was entirely committed. These Druidical Institutions,"], [21, "preface. IX particularly those of Britain, were very much crowded with Students ; as many of the Youth of Gaul came over to finish their Education in this Island. And, it is said, that one of the most celebrated of them was in the Isle of Anglesea. Julius Agricola, who was advanced to the Government of Britain in the year 78, was, how ever, the first of the Roman Governors, who gave any considerable attention to the concerns of Learning. This illustrious person being not only one of the greatest Generals, but also one of the best and most learned men of the age in which he lived, took great pains to reconcile the Provincial Britons to the Roman Government, by intro ducing amongst them the Roman Arts and Sciences. % With this view he persuaded the Noble Youth of Britain to learn the Latin language, and to apply to the study of the Roman eloquence. These persuasions were successful, because they were seasonable ; and the British youth being deprived of their former Instructors, by the de struction and expulsion of the Druids, which hap pened about this time, willingly put themselves under those Teachers who were provided for them by the Romans. At length the knowledge of Latin became one of the first and most indispen sible branches of a liberal education ; and that language was so generally understood and spoken in this Island, that, according to Gildas, \" Britain might then have been more properly called a Roman than a British Island.\""], [22, "X PREFACE. After Learning had flourished in Provincial Britain, from the end of the first to the middle of the fourth Century, it then begun to decline, and by various means was reduced to a very languish ing state, before the arrival of the Saxons.b It is in vain to seek for Learning, or learned Men, among the Saxons, at that period. For, although they were not absolute strangers to the use of letters, yet, like all the other Northern Nations, they were so much addicted to plunder ing and piratical expeditions, that they despised the peaceful pursuits of Science. Their arrival, therefore, in this Island was so far from being fa vourable to the cause of Learning, that the very last sparks of it were almost extinguished in all those parts where their arms prevailed ; in which the most profound darkness reigned, until after the introduction of Christianity. As the youth in those parts of England which had embraced the Christian Religion, begun to apply to Learning with some eagerness in the Seventh century, several Schools were then estab lished for their instruction : one of the most illus trious of them being that of Canterbury, which was founded by Augustine, the Apostle of the English,and his Companions, and greatly improved by Archbishop Theodore. One thing that retarded the progress of Learn ing in England, and made the acquisition of liter \u2022 b Henry's Hist, of Great Brit. vol. 2. p. 312. et passim."], [23, "preface. XI ary knowledge extremely difficult in this Century, was, the scarcity of Boois, which had been either carried away by the Romans, or so entirely de stroyed by the Scots, Picts, and Saxons, that it may be doubted whether there was so much as one Book left in England before the arrival of Augustine. Nor was this deficiency easily sup plied, as there was a necessity of bringing them all from foreign countries, and chiefly from Rome, where they could not be procured without great difficulty, and a most incredible expense. At this rate, none but Kings, Bishops, and Abbots, could be possessed of any Books ; which is the reason, that there were then no Schools but in Kings' Palaces, Bishops' Seats, or Monasteries. Alcui nus, who was the Keeper of the noble Library which was founded at York by Archbishop Egbert, speaks of it in several of his Letters, as one of the most choice and valuable collections of Books then in the world. \" Oh ! that I had,\" says he in a Letter to the Emperor Charlemagne, \" the use of those admirable Books on all parts of Learning, which I enjoyed in my native country, collected by the industry of my beloved Master Egbert.

Prior to the accession of this extraordinary Monarch, all the Seminaries of Learning in England were laid in ashes. These were the Monasteries and Bishops' Seats, (where Schools had been kept for the edu cation of Youth, chiefly for the Church,) which were so universally destroyed by the Danes, that hardly one of them was left standing. This great Prince, sensible how impossible it was to revive Learning, without providing Schools for the edu cation of youth, repaired the old Monasteries, and built new ones, instituting a School in each of them for that purpose. But in these Monastic and Episcopal Schools, both in England and in other Countries of Europe, the youth were only taught reading, writing, the Latin language, and Church-Music, to fit them for performing the public offices of the Church ; except in a very few, where some were taught Arithmetic, to enable them to manage the Secular affairs of their Societies, and others instructed in Rhetoric and Theology, to assist them in declaiming to the People. Although these Schools prevented the total ex tinction of literary knowledge among the Christian Clergy in those dark times, they contributed very little to the improvement of the Sciences, or the"], [25, "PREFACE. XIII diffusion of Learning among the Laity, who were left almost entirely without the means of acquir ing any degree of Literature. When Alfred, therefore, formed the noble de sign of rendering Learning both more perfect and more general, he was under the necessity of insti tuting Schools on a different and more extensive plan; in which all the Sciences that were then known, should be taught by the best Masters that could be procured, to the Laity as well as to the Clergy. Hence the Foundation of our Two Uni sities, the most Illustrious Seats of Learning in the World. Having thus founded and endowed Schools, and provided them with proper Masters, he next endeavoured to fill them witli suitable Scholars ; which was not the easiest part of his work in that rude age, when Learning was holden in such con tempt, especially by the Nobility. But this illi beral and barbarous disdain for letters, he effec tually overcame in a little time, \u2014 by his own Example, \u2014 by speaking on all occasions in praise of Learning, \u2014 and by making it the great road to preferment both in Church and State. And still further to diffuse a taste for knowledge, and to transmit it to posterity, he made a Law, obliging all Freeholders who possessed two Hides of land, or upwards, to send their sons to School, and give them a liberal education. By these wise measures this most excellent Prince made a total change in the sentiments of"], [26, "XIV PREFACE. his subjects. The old Nobility bewailed their un happiness in being ignorant of letters, and some of them applied to study in a very advanced age ; while all took care to send their sons and young relations to those Schools provided for them by the wisdom and munificence of their Sovereign. Hence Learning revived and flourished to such a degree in the course of this glorious reign, that, before the end of it, Alfred could boast, that all his Bishops' Sees were filled by Prelates of great learning, and every Pulpit in England furnished with a good Preacher. So astonishing are the effects which a great and good Prince, animated with an ardent zeal for the happiness of his Sub jects, can produce, not only in the circumstances, but in the very spirit and character of a Nation! But that gleam of light, which appeared in England towards the conclusion of the Ninth Century, was not of long continuance ; for as this was chiefly owing to the extraordinary genius and unwearied efforts of Alfred, as soon as these were removed by the death of that Prince, in the first year of the Tenth Century, learning begun to languish and decline. Edward, his eldest son and successor, had been educated with great care ; but not having the same genius and taste for study as his Illustrious Father, he did not prove so great a Patron of learning and of learned men. The Danes, too, those destructive enemies of Science and Civilization, no sooner heard of the"], [27, "PREFACE. XV death of Alfred, than they renewed their ravages ; which they continued, with little interruption, for many years. Besides this, the learned men collected by Al fred from different countries, dying soon after their Royal Patron, were not succeeded by men of equal knowledge. And these, and several other unfavourable circumstances, gave a fatal check to the liberal and studious spirit which had been excited in the late reign ; and the English by de grees relapsed into their former ignorance, and contempt of learning. The restoration of the ancient line of the Anglo- Saxon Kings, in the year 1041, in the person of Edward The Confessor, was an event favourable to learning. For although Edward was not a great Prince, he was not unlearned for the age in which he lived, nor inattentive to the interests of learning. He repaired the injuries done to Ox ford by his predecessor Harold, which, in his reign, according to Ingulphus, seems to have been the chief Seminary of learning in England. \" I was born,\" says Ingulphus, \" in England, and of English Parents, in the beautiful city of London ; educated in letters in my tender years at Westminster ; from whence I was afterwards sent to the Study of Oxford ; where I made greater progress in the Aristotelian philosophy than many of my Contemporaries, and became very well ac quainted with the Rhetoric of Cicero.\" This Author further acquaints us, that when he was a boy at"], [28, "XVI PREFACE. Westminster School, and used to visit his Father, who lived in the Court of Edward The Confessor, he was often examined, both on the Latin lan guage and on Logic, by the beautiful and virtu ous Queen Edgitha, who excelled in both these branches of literature. A pleasing instance, that Learning was then esteemed a desirable accom plishment even in Ladies of the highest Rank. One cause of the improvements in the Sciences which took place from the year 1166 to 1216, was the increase of the Seminaries of Learning : these consisting of General Studies or Universities, \u2014 Episcopal or Cathedral Schools, \u2014 Monastic or Conventual Schools, \u2014 The Schools of Cities and Towns, \u2014 and, The Schools of The Jews. That those Seats of Learning which are now called Universities, were anciently called Studies, is well known. But, about the end of the Twelfth or beginning of the Thirteenth Century, the modern name seems generally to have prevailed, either because all kinds of learning were taught in them, and Students of all Countries were welcome to them, or because they were formed into legal Communities, which, in the Latin of those times, were called Universitates.c In the darkest of the middle ages, it has been observed, the families of Bishops were the chief Seminaries of Learning, in which young persons were educated for the service of the Church. c Henry's Hist, of Great Brit. vol. 3. p. 436, et passim."], [29, "PREFACE. XVII These Episcopal or Cathedral Schools still conti nued in this period. They were also better regu lated, and consequently more useful and more frequented. In the most ancient times, the Bishop was commonly the chief, if not the only Teacher, of his Cathedral School ; the faithful discharge of which laborious office was hardly compatible with the other duties of his function. But, in this period, these Schools were put under the direction of men of learning, who devoted their whole time and study to the education of youth, and had cer tain Estates or Prebends assigned for their sup port. These Teachers of the Cathedral Schools were called, \" The Scholastics of the Diocese ;\" and all the youth in it, who were designed for the Church, were entitled to the benefit of their in structions. By the Eighteenth Canon of the third general Council of Lat 'er an, in the year 1179, it was decreed, That such Scholastics should be settled in all Cathedrals, with sufficient Revenues for their support ; and that they should have au thority to superintend all the Schoolmasters ofthe Diocese, and grant them licenses, without which none should presume to teach. The Sciences, therefore, that were taught in these Cathedra- Schools, were such as were most necessary to qual lify their Pupils for performing the duties of the Sacerdotal office, as Grammar, Rhetoric, Logic, Theology, and Church-Music. In the year 1215, in the Fourth general Council of Lateran, similar Ordinances are expressly enjoined. vol. i. b"], [30, "XVIII PREFACE. The great increase of Religious Houses in this period, very much increased the number of Semi naries of learning, as there was a School more or less celebrated in almost every Convent. And some idea may be formed of the number added to the Schools by this means, when it is considered, that there were no fewer than 557 Religious Houses of different kinds, according to Bishop Tanner, founded in England between the Con quest and the death of King John. One design of these Monastic Schools was, to instruct the younger Monks in those branches of learning that were necessary to their decent performance of the Service of the Church, particularly in the Latin language and Church-Music. Some degree of knowledge of these parts of learning was so neces sary, that without it none could be admitted into the Monastic Order in any of the Chief Abbeys ; and the famous Nicholas Breakspear, after wards Pope Adrian the Fourth, was rejected by Richard, Abbot of St. Albans, for want of a sufficient share of learning. In these Conventual Schools the young Monks were carefully instruct ed in the art of fair and beautiful Writing ; and those who excelled in that art, were for some years employed in the Scriptorium, or Writing- Chamber, in transcribing books for the use of the Church and Library. In the Schools of all the larger Monasteries, besides the requisite p irts of learning, several other Sciences were taught, as Rhetoric, Logic, Theology, Medicine, with the"], [31, "preface. XIX Civil and Canon Law. These two last branches of learning, Law and Physic, being very lucrative, were so diligently studied and practised by the Monks, that they were almost the only Pleaders and Physicians of those times. Many persons of Rank and Fortune were also educated in these Conventual Schools, to which they frequently be came Benefactors. Besides all these Seminaries of learning, there were established in this period, in all the chief Cities and Towns of England, considerable Schools, in which the Youth were instructed not only in reading, writing, and grammar, but also in several other branches of Literature, as Rhetoric, Logic, and Theology. We are told by William Fitz- Stephens, who flourished in the reign of Henry the Second, that there were three of these emi nent Schools in London firmly established : be sides several others that were occasionally opened by such Masters, as had obtained a high reputa tion for their Learning. \" On Holidays,\" he observes, \" it is usual for these Schools to hold Public Assemblies in the Churches in which the Scholars engage in demon strative or logical disputations, some using enthy mems, and others perfect syllogisms ; some aim ing at nothing but to gain the victory, and make an ostentatious display of their acuteness, while others have the investigation of truth in view. Artful Sophists, on these occasions, acquire great applause ; some by a prodigious inundation and"], [32, "XX PREFACE flow of words, others by their specious but falla cious arguments. After the disputations, other Scholars deliver rhetorical declamations, in which they observe all the rules of art, and neglect no topic of persuasion. Even the younger boys in the different Schools contend against each other in verse, about the principles of Grammar, and the preterites and supines of verbs.\"d That prodigious number of Jews crowded into England soon after the Conquest, and resided in all it's principal towns for some ages, is attested by all the Historians of those times. Their num bers and riches were indeed so great, and the revenues derived from them by Government so considerable, that, according to Madox, a parti cular Exchequer was appointed for their recep tion.0 Among these Jews there were many Rab bies, and men of Learning, who officiated as Priests in their Synagogues, and Professors in their Schools, which they had in London, York, Lincoln, Lynn, Norwich, Oxford, Cambridge, and every other town where any considerable number of them resided. Nor were the Academies of the Jewish Rabbies shut against the Christian Youth, but open to all who chose to take the benefit of their instructions. Certainly, says Wase, we all bear no less affec tion to the common Christianity, than the Jews d Fitz -Stephen's Description of London, p. 3o. e Madox. Hist. Excheq. p. 150."], [33, "PREFACE.

All these different kinds of Schools continued to flourish in the Thirteenth Century, according to Roger Bacon, who informs us, that there never had been so great an appearance of Learn ing, and so general an application to study, in so many different Faculties, as in his time, when Schools were erected in every City, Town, Burgh, and Castle.8 So many Schools being founded, and so many Sciences taught, in London, and it's environs, that it was not very improperly called \" A Third University.\"11 ' Wase's Considerations concerning Free Schools, p.

Learning, however, sensibly declined during the subsequent period. And, about the year 1447, the Public Schools for the education of youth in London had so far gone to decay, that the grossest ignorance prevailed among the people m general. To remedy this defect, Four Clergymen peti tioned Parliament for leave to set up Schools in their respective Parishes, viz. Allhallows the More, St. Andrew's Holborn, St. Peter in Cornhill, and St. Mary Colechurch, with liberty to their several Successors to continue the said Schools.' This Petition, which, it may be supposed, was drawn by men of zealous principles with their greatest care and the utmost exertion of their abilities, is still preserved among the Records in the Tower,k and is a lasting Memorial of their Benevolence and patriotic Conduct. This Petition being granted by King Henry the Sixth, a partial remedy was thus applied by those well disposed persons, to the irregularity of behavionr and rude ness of manners which characterized the features of that period. A few great men who succeeded each other, likewise prevented the Lamp of Learning from being entirely extinguished.

At that time many learned Greeks fled for pro tection into Italy and Germany, where they were kindly received, and where they diffused Science with great success.' In a short time after this event, the inhabitants of the Western parts of Europe made great pro gress in all branches of Literature ; and the in vention of Printing, which soon followed, com pleted the triumph of Learning, over Barbarism and Ignorance. There is a Solemnity and Importance in our desire to know what measures were devised, what steps pursued, and what selected instruments in the hands of Providence ordained, gradually to diffuse knowledge, and prepare the way for better Learning, and a more pure form of Religion. It is generally allowed, that the noble impulse of Christian Charity in the founding of Grammar Schools, was one of the Divine means for bring ing about the blessed Reformation. And it is, therefore, observable, that within Thirty years be fore it's accomplishment, there were more Gram mar Schools erected and endowed in England, than had been established in Three Hundred years preceding.\" Before the Reformation, it has been remarked, that Learning was much confined to the Monas- 1 Astle's Orig. and Prog, of Writing Introduct. p.

King Edward the Sixth, by Letters Patent, bearing date the 20th of June, in the second year of his reign, 1549, appointed certain Commis sioners, \" to take diverse orders for the mainten nance and continuance of Scollers, Priests, and Curates,\" and other matters relative to the Poor ; and under the authority of this Commission, the regulation of Schools was comprised. Our gratitude, therefore, must ever be due to the memory of Edward the Sixth, under whose splendid reign so many works of Munificence and Piety were established. Unlike his Royal Father, his attention and solicitude were extended to every class of his Subjects, who felt the effects of his benign disposition; and his Princely endowments constitute at this day, part of the glory of the British Empire. The impulse thus given, was wisely continued ; and it was the great policy of succeeding Princes to encourage Learning, as the most effectual means to expose or combat the errors of the Church of Rome ; which so long agitated the minds of the people, that the Government was exceedingly disturbed by them, until the Glorious Revolution, in 1688, when Religion, Law, and Liberty, were fixed on that solid basis, which gives"], [37, "PREFACE.

XXXI That although The Committee were not in structed to examine the state of Education be yond the Metropolis, they had, \" in addition to what has appeared in Evidence, received commu nications, which show the necessity of Parliament as speedily as possible instituting an Inquiry into the management of Charitable Donations and other Funds for the Instruction of the Poor of this Country, and into the state of their Education generally, especially in the larger Towns.\" And The Committee are of opinion, \" that the most effectual, as well as least expensive, mode of con ducting such an Inquiry, would be by means of a Parliamentary Commission.\" In a Second Report from The Select Committee, dated the 7th of July, 1817, they state, \" Your Committee having considered the information communicated to them during the last Session, from various parts of the Country, touching the State of Education, and more particularly the misapplication of Funds destined by gift, bequest, or devise to that purpose, are of opinion, that it would be expedient to extend the instructions under which they act, so as to embrace an Inquiry into the Education of the Lower Orders generally throughout England and Wales.\" For an humble Individual, after such high Authority, to undertake a description of all our Endowed Grammar Schools, \u2014 to struggle with difficulties, \u2014 the objections of his Friends, \u2014 and the reluctance of some of the parties concerned to"], [44, "'preface.

But his experience of former kindness from The Public gave energy to his hopes, and silenced all the ap prehensions which expense and fatigue were ready to excite. Confiding, therefore, in general support, he re spectfully ventured to insert a Letter and a Series of Questions in The Gentleman's Magazine, and to send a copy of the same to The Head Masters of every known Grammar School throughout Eng land and Wales, and the result has been propor tionate to his most ardent expectations.' Apartments of The Society of Antiquaries, Somerset Place, London. Sir, 26</t December, 1816. The numerous endowed Grammar Schools in this Kingdom reflect the highest honour on the memory of their charitable and pious Founders. But, as we have little intelligence re specting their internal establishment, and the proper mode of applying for admission for a Child, and the requisites necessary to success, it has occurred to me, that a concise description of those benevolent Institutions might be useful to persons in gen eral; as a clear explanation of their Ordinances may remove many difficulties from an inquiring Parent, and point out the several advantages of any particular Seminary. Under this impression I have drawn up a series of Questions, which I beg leave to lay, with every degree of respect, before the Public. In this solicitation of general attention, I wish it clearly to be understood, that I am actuated solely by the desire of promoting the publick good, and that I shall esteem myself much honoured by the trouble which any Head Master, or any other Gentleman, may take in drawing up the History of the Schools in their respective Counties, or for any information"], [45, "PREFACE.

It would be presumptuous to expatiate on the merits of our great Public Seminaries ; for where is the Gentle man, who has not either profited by their imme diate Tuition, or by the hands of those who have had the happiness to enjoy such a Blessing ? It is painful, however, to relate, that many of our numerous and ample Endowments have fallen to decay, by the negligence or cupidity of ignorant or unprincipled Trustees; who have silently, or by connivance, suffered the furtive alienation of the very Lands which they were called upon so so lemnly to defend, and which were in a great measure ordained for the Education of their own Children. As the property of those benevolent Institutions is, therefore, in several cases lost or sunk ; or em bezzled, or disgracefully misapplied ; or lessened or impaired by gross dereliction of duty, and very great frauds are committed in letting and ma naging the estates; \u2014 it appears absolutely neces sary, that such disorder and misapplication should speedily be abolished, by a Public investigation and reform of those evils, which is only within 'the power of Parliament. It is true, that many of the Nobility, Gentry, or neighbouring Ministers, are often the Special Visitors, \u2014 andThe Right Reverend their Diocesan, and Spiritual Father, is always their General I i sitor, \u2014 but such interference is, probably, seldom exercised, unless at the honest indignation of some conscientious Parishioner."], [48, "XXX VI PREFACE. In a perusal of the Statutes, a great Similarity between those of the more eminent Schools will be obvious. It is well known that King Henry the Sixth grounded his Statutes for Eton upon those of Winchester: and this similarity was further increased by the correction of Individuals, who were deemed particularly excellent in such compositions ; especially the amiable Dean Now ell, whose general character not only as a man of judgement and learning, but the memory of whose fame, as Master of Westminster School, made his revision and approbation of several ofthe Seminaries, established in his time, to be so much desired.v That frightful disease, the Plague, which the Statutes endeavour so humanely to guard against, is now happily unknown : and some disorders which were then thought incurable, are by a better course of living and more discreet conduct now also never seen, or have abated much of their ma lignity. There is a pleasure in contemplating the hardy and athletic exercises, which are prescribed for the Pupils, to invigorate the limbs and expand the mind: And, however it may have been asserted to the contrary, the religious and moral prin ciples which are every where most strictly enjoin ed, completely confute the groundless calumnies, which have been disseminated on the score of neglect of piety.

XXXVII Of those who superintend the Education of Youth, Erasmus is ever fond of expressing his praise ; and, whenever he had an opportunity, he encouraged men of letters to undertake the labo rious care of a Grammar School ; which he always most justly commends, as what exalts the Master to the highest dignity ; whose business is to sea son Youth in Learning and Religion, and raise up men for the service of their country. \" It may be,\" he observes, \" the employment is accounted vile and mean in the opinion of Fools; but, in itself, it is really great and honourable.\" And he fur ther insists, \" that the safety of States depends upon Three things, \u2014 Upon a proper or improper Education of the Prince, upon Public Preachers, and upon School-masters.\" Much of the useful Learning, which has so remarkably enlightened the middle ranks of the English nation, and rendered us a moral and an understanding people, has proceeded from our numerous Public Schools. It is in these truly re spectable nurseries of Literature, that Education has effected it's most generous and valuable pur poses. The mind, which might otherwise have been confined by sordid habits, has been expand ed : Genius, which might have been hidden from the World, has been called forth to the honour of human nature : And the general manners, from rudeness and vulgarity, have been rendered easy, courteous, and polite.\" w Wilson's Hist, of Merch.

A boy of spirit may acquire a previous and practical expe rience of the world ; and his play-fellows may be the future friends of his heart or his interest. In a free intercourse with his equals, the habits of truth, fortitude, and prudence will insensibly be matured. Birth and riches are measured by the standard of personal merit ; and the mimic scene of a Rebellion has displayed, in their true colours, the Ministers and Patriots of the rising genera tion.\"\" The Master's Stipend it will be seen, upon some of the old Foundations, is much below envy ; although such an income in the time of the Donors might have been amply sufficient. In most cases, however, the rise in the value of the Estates is extraordinary, and where the receipts are faith fully dispensed by the Trustees, afford a plentiful revenue for the support of the Establishment. Wherever Rent-charges were given, they must of course remain stationary ; and even several dona tions were only for terms of years, and upon cer tain conditions, which have long since expired.

Some of these Exhibitions are appropriated to a particular School, County, or certain Counties ; others are given for a certain term of years, and some inde- finitely without limitation of place. Local bene- factions were given out of peculiar respect to the Inhabitants of such place, with which the Bene- factor himself was in some way connected ; while some persons of more ample fortunes and enlarged views, out of their regard to the whole Kingdom, have left full choice of their Exhibitioners to the free discretion of Feoffees. Whence arises a lau dable spirit of ambition ; and to the greater Schools upon which any Exhibitions are settled, the very expectation of the reward draws resort, and excites an emulation in learning aud good deportment. But there is an ulterior object in these bene factions which is often overlooked, as it has an immediate reference to the Church. The Statutes ofthe several Colleges solemnly enjoining a dili gent and decent attendance on Public Worship ; and implying, that the Salaries to Masters, and Exhibitions to .Scholars, are to provide in a great measure, that \" the Church be not burthened ;\" since, upon the supposition of these advantages being withdrawn, Ecclesiastical Benefices are taxable to the education of Students ; and, in the beginning of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, 1559, they were actually taxed a Thirtieth part."], [52, "XL PREFACE. It may be curious to trace the origin of the Latin and Greek Grammars. The excellent author of \" Reflexions upon Learning,\" observes, \" in our times the common Grammar that goes under the name of Mr. Lilye, was done by some of the most considerable men of the age. The English Rudiments, by Dean Colet ; with a pre face to the first edition, directing it's use, was by no less a man than Cardinal Wolsey. The most rational part, The Syntax, was written or corrected by Erasmus ; and the other parts, by other emi nent persons. So that although Mr. Lilye now bears the name, which, while living, he always modestly refused, yet it was carried on by the joint endeavours of several learned men, and he had, perhaps, not the largest share in that work.\"T It may also be observed, that it redounds not a little to the honour of St. Paul's School, that not only the Latin Grammar is owing to the skill and care of The Founder, and the first Master of that School ; but also the common Greek Grammar, used throughout England, by the same authority as the Latin, was composed by Camden, who had been a Scholar at that celebrated Seminary. It is likewise curious to remark, that many of the examples in the Latin Grammar are said to have pointed at the then juncture of Public affairs; viz., The Prosecution of Empson and Dudley, in the beginning of the reign of King Henry the i Knight's Life of Colet, p. 126, note."], [53, "XLI PREFACE. Eighth, as, \" Regum est tueri leges ; Refert om nium animadverti in malos.\" And this humour was the reason, why, in the following editions of the Syntax, there were examples accommodated to the respective years of the impressions, as, in that of 1513, \" Imperator meruit sub rege in Gal- Ha,\" relating to Maximilian, the Emperor of Germany, who then, at the siege of Teroiienne in Flanders, fought under the Banner of Henry the Eighth, and received an Hundred Crowns a day for his pay. And, in the edition of 1520, \" Audito regem Doroberniam proficisci,\" referring to the King's speedy journey to Canterbury, there to give entertainment to the Emperor Charles the Fifth, lately landed at Dover. There were likewise in the edition of Erasmus, several examples relating to Dean Colet : as, \" Vixit Rom\u0153, studiit Oxonii, natus est Londini, discessit Londino.\"' It is the opinion of Anthony k Wood, that the first printed Grammar in England was that by John Holt, of Magdalen College, and Usher of Magdalen School in Oxford, intituled, \" Lac Puer- orum,\" which was printed about the year 1497; aud dedicated to Morton, Archbishop of Canter- bury. This Grammar was then in much repute. About the same time was published an Accidence and Grammar, written also by a person of the name of Holt, who was master to Sir Thomas More. After these, various treatises on Grammar * Knight's Life of Colet, p. 132."], [54, "XLII PREFACE. were published by Linacre, Stanbridce, and Whittington. And these again have all been improved by the learning and humanity of more eminent Philo logists. The course of Education which is pursued in the several Schools, has been attempted to be obtained, that a just comparison may be formed ofthe most approved methods. Even the com prehensive mind of Johnson has not disdained to draw up a \" Scheme for the Classes of a Gram mar School.\"* There are peculiar regulations in many Schools, which require particular obser vance ; but, in general, affection or respect seem decidedly to preponderate in favour of the Eton rules. Many Schools are under the immediate Super intendence and Visitation of particular Colleges : and, it is a remark of Mr. Nelson, that the con necting of a School with a College is a wise con trivance to preserve it in honour aud reputation.1\" Wase also observes, that the annexing the Patron age of Country Free Schools to some House in The University has been experienced mutually beneficial.c In an age, when so many Theories are enter tained with respect to the universal Necessity, or the expeditious Acquirement, of Learning, \u2014 when a Boswell's Life of Johnson, vol. 1. p. 76. 8vo. w Life of Bull, p. 10. c Considerations concerning Free Schools, p. 80."], [55, "XLIII PREFACE. our ancient Establishments are yielding to new fangled Systems, and even Westminster has been strangely classed in The Report on the Edu cation of \" The Lower Orders in the Metropolis,\" \u2014 it may well become some able and scientific pen to protect and exemplify the rights and import ance of our Public Grammar Schools ; and put a bold stop to the havoc of ignorant or fanatic Trustees, before they impair those Venerable In stitutions, where the true sense of the Learned languages may in Youth be obtained, and the Spirit and the Beauties of Classic authors well understood and duly estimated ; \u2014 And thus by acquiring the art of speaking and writing with purity and elegance, lay the best Foundation of Academical Studies.

The Free Grammar School in the Parish of St. Nicholas in the Borough of Abingdon was founded in the year 1 563, by John Royse, Citizen and Mercer of London, for the education of Sixty-three poor boys ; and endowed with Two houses in Birchin Lane, which were burnt down about the year 1753. Upon the site of these Houses The London Assurance Company erected their Office, and now pay an annual rent of \u00a3100. for the same. Thomas Tesdale, Esq., the first Scholar on Royse's Foundation, having bequeathed \u00a35000. to purchase estates for t.be maintenance of Seven Fellows and Six Scholars from The Free School of Abingdon in any of the Colleges of Oxford, Dr. Abbot, Archbishop of Canterbury, and the other Trustees, intended at first to place this Foundation in Balliol College. That design, however, not having been complettd, they determined to found a New College on the site of Broadgates Hall, and in the mean time Estates were purchased for the Endowment in Berkshire and Wiltshire. The plan was likewise assisted by a second Benefactor, Richard Wightwick, B. D., some time of Balliol College, and afterwards Rector of East Ilsley and Hampstead Norris in Berkshire, who engaged to make over some Estates in aid of the Endowment. The Corporation of Abingdon next petitioned King James, that he would constitute a College within Broad~ gates Hall ; Whereupon His Majesty, by Letters Patent, dated the 22d of June, 1624, granted, that within the said Hall of Broadgates there should be a Perpetual College, to be known by the name of \" The Master, Fellows, and Scholars of The College of Pembroke, in the University of Oxford, of the Foundation of King James, at the cost and charges of Thomas Tesdale and Richard Wightwick.\" An Ushership was also founded by Mr. Tesdale, who, for"], [91, "Abingdon.] BERKS, 29 that purpose, gave his Tythes ofthe Hamlet of Upton, part of the Impropriate Rectory of Ratley, in the County of Warwick, now producing a clear rent of \u00a397- . 11s.. 3d. per annum.

During the time they are at School,they have an allowance for books and apparel ; and, at the end of six years, they have each \u00a350. for an Apprentice Fee.

Wightwick's Foundation, upon an Estate of \u00a3100. per annum, was for the maintenance of Three Fellows and Four Scholars, two of each to be of his kindred, wher ever born, and the rest of Abingdon School. The Election of both Foundations was fixed for the Monday after the first Sunday in August, and the right of Election vested in The Master of the College, Two of Tesdale's Senior Fellows, The Master of Christ's Hospital at Abingdon, Two of the Senior Governors, and the Master of the School.

The concerns of The Free Grammar School in New bury are involved in profound mystery. A stipend of \u00a3 1 2. per annum for a Master, is payable out of the Land revenue of the Crown. The late Master died on the 3d of November, 1814, \" since which time no new Master has been appointed, and no Ditties performed under this Establishment.\" D2"], [98, "[Reading. BERKS. 36 READING. In the year 1445, according to Leland, John Thorne, Abbot of the Monastery of Reading, having suppressed an old Alms-house for poor Sisters, near St. Lawrence's Church, which had, probably, been founded by one of his predecessors, employed the revenues of it to the use of the Almoner. But Henry the Seventh, being here soon after, was offended with the Abbot, for converting the funds of a Religious House, to purposes so foreign to the intentions of the donor, and ordered him to settle the house and lands on some Charitable Establishment. In consequence of this intimation from His Majesty, the Abbot made it a Grammar School ; in which benevolent design he was seconded by one William Dene, an officer in the Abbey, who gave two hundred marks towards the advancement of the Foundation, as Leland collected from his Tomb in the Abbey Church. But the Abbot dying soon afterwards, in 1486, the settlement was not completed; though it appears to have been begun, as, after the Dissolu tion, the sum of \u00a3 1 0. per annum was paid to the Master by The Crown. But, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, the Corporation undertook to pay the Master's salary, in return for certain lands bestowed upon them by Her Majesty, and then amounting to about \u00a3 41.. 9s.. 7 d. per annum. By this Charter, which bears date the 23d of September, 1560, they were authorized to nominate and appoint the Master. In the subsequent reign of Charles the First, Arch bishop Laud, by his will, gave lands at Bray, then of the annual value of \u00a320., as an addition to the Master's salary ; which sum, by the increase of rent, has been augmented to \u00a350. a year."], [99, "Reading.] BERKS. 37 It is remarkable, that there are no Statutes belonging to this School, to regulate the conduct of the Masters and Scholars; such as are usually annexed to the Foundation of all other Schools. The Charter of Queen Elizabeth only reciting, that \" a School, or Grammar School, founded \" and built by Our Predecessors, is in the Borough, for \" educating the Boys ofthe Inhabitants ofthe said Borough, \"and others, in Literature.\" The want of a systematic foundation is probably the cause of this omission ; as Henry the Seventh merely left general directions for the establishment of the School, with out contributing any thing to the Master's stipend : which was paid by the Abbot of Reading, until the Dissolution, as may be inferred from Cox's dedication of his \" Art or Crafte of Rhetoryke ;\" and, afterwards, it was charged upon the Manor of Cholscy by Henry the Eighth. Archbishop Laud was the most hberal Benefactor to the School ; but, not considering himself as it's Founder, he did not draw up any Statutes for it's government. This worthy Prelate, however, appointed Three Visitors ; viz. \u2014 The Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford, The President of St. John's, and The Warden of All Souls College ; and left the interest of a sum of \u00a324., for the expenses of their reception and entertainment. They visit the School every third year. It has been customary, besides occasional examinations in Classical learning, for the Scholars to recite Speeches, or to perform Plays, at the time of this Triennial Visitation. The first Play on record is that of Calo, in 1731. The present Master, The Rev. Dr. Valpy, has paid great attention to the Theatrical Representations, and has purified and altered some Plays of Plautus and of Shakespeare, for the use of his Scholars. Of these Plays, four of Shakespeare have been published, viz., King John, the Second Part of Henry the Fourth, The Roses, from the Third Part of"], [100, "BERKS. [Reading. 38 Henry the Sixth, and The Merchant of Venice. Four Plays of Plautus, The Amphitruo, The Aulularia, The Captives, and The Rudens, have likewise been printed for the use of Schools. Some Plays of Sophocles and Euri pides have also been performed by the Scholars, with the strict costume of ancient Greece. The amount of money received at these Representations is very laudably bestowed upon some deserving object of Public Charity. There are two Scholarships in St. John the Baptist's College, Oxford, belonging to this School, which were sounded by Sir Thomas White, in 1557. In the Statutes of the College, as drawn up by himself, Sir Thomas ob serves ; \u2014 \" Seeing that there is nothing in the whole society of man more divine ; nothing more analogous to our nature, than to be liberal and bountiful towards those, to whom we conceive ourselves most beholden : Neither are we tied by stricter bonds of friendship to any, more than to the citizens of London ; among whom we have been, not only long conversant, and brought up almost from our infancy, but also have attained and gotten the greatest part of such goods and commodities, as now, by Divine permission, we enjoy ; Wherefore, being moved with that love and piety, which we bear towards our Fellow Citizens, we do appoint, ordain, and will, that Forty-three of the poorer Scholars, who, either within London, or the suburbs thereof, shall bestow their time diligently in Grammar, may be admitted into this our College, founded and endowed at our costs and charges, and they shall enjoy all such advantages as the present scholars possess : \u2014 \" Also, each of the following Schools, viz., Coventry, Bris tol, and Reading, shall send Two Scholars, who shall par take of the same advantages and privileges, as the others enjoy.

And they shall take care to send such out of their Schools, to The College, as either they themselves shall know, or in the judgment of others, shall believe to be fit to learn Logic. And we do decree, ordain, and will, that this no- mination, assignation, evocation, and election, of Forty-three Scholars, 3and Six Choristers, by the Worshipful Men, The Mas- ter, Wardens, and Assistants, and The President, and Vice-Pre- sident, and Two of the Chief Senior Fellows ; And also, the nomination, evocation, and election, of those Seven Scholars, by The Mayors and Aldermen of those places, of which we made mention before, be made and kept for ever : neither shall it be lawful at any time, for The President and Fellows, which now are, or for their successors, to invert, change, break, or weaken the form of electing Scholars, which we have prescribed, nor to expound, or interpret otherwise than the true, natural, Bund grammatical sense of the words do bear, under pain of expulsion out of The College : Neither shall they at any time consent, either in word or deed, to them that do otherwise.\" These Scholarships, at the end of two years, regularly lead to Fellowships. The School-room for many years occupied the lower part of the Great Hall of The Hospital of St. John ; the upper part being used as a Town-hall. When the Town-hall was re-built, the School continued for some time in it's old situa tion. But, as it had been found subject to many inconve niences, the present Master, in the year 1790, built a new School-room, fifty-two feet in length, at his own expense. The Master's House, remarkable for the convenience and salubrity of the situation, was built by Mr. Hiley, a former Master, for the reception of his Boarders, and rented by his successor, Mr. Spicer; who, in 177L set on foot a sub scription for purchasing and annexing it to the School, for the residence of the Master: \u2014 liberal contributions were"], [102, "BERKS. [Reading. 40 made by The Corporation, by St. John's College, and by the neighbouring Gentry, particularly such as had been educated in the School;\u2014 but, it was not until the year 1784, that the intention was carried into effect, and the House purchased of Dr. Addington, the Son-in-Law of Mr. FIiley, and vested in The Corporation, as Trustees. Here again we experience the liberality of Dr. Valpy, who has considerably enlarged and improved the House, particu larly by the addition of a spacious Hall and Library. As the School was founded for the Sons qf the Inhabit ants and others, it is open to all who conform to the Regu lations of the Establishment. At Nineteen, boys are superannuated for the Foundation at St. John's College. The Latin and Greek Grammars in use, are those written by the present Master. The system of Education, with such alterations as expedience and locality render necessary, is formed upon those of Westminster, Eton, and Win chester Colleges. This School is deservedly in great repute, under the ex cellent management of the present learned Master, Richard Valpy, D.D. Besides the Head Master, some of the Assistants re ceive Boarders, on different terms, according to the num bers which they accommodate. Cardinal Wolsey is said, on the authority of Archbishop Parker, to have been a short time Master of this School.

The Free School at Aylesbury was origindly founded by Sir Henry Lee, of Ditchley, in the County of Oxford. The date of it's ori:gin is not known ; but there is, in the Church of Aylesbury, an old monument of part of the family of a Sir Henry Lee, dated 1584. It is probable that he was the Founder. The Writings of the original Endowment are supposed to have been lost in the Civil Wars : But the value of the Premises, bequeathed for that purpose, amounted in the be ginning ofthe Eighteenth Century to about \u00a38. per annum. On the 29th of September, 1714, Henry Phillips, Gen tleman, who was born in the Parish of Aylesbury, bequeathed \u00a35000. for the purchase of Estates for the benefit of that parish ; to be added to the Free School, founded by Sir Henry Lee. In consequence of this bequest, the present Free School and Houses for the Head Master, and the Writing Master, were erected in the year 1718. The Estates (being the Manor of Broughton Abbot's, in the neighbouring Parish of Bierton) now net upwards of \u00a3400. per annum. The School is open to the Boys of Aylesbury and Walton, free of expense. And, if Aylesbury and Walton cannot supply a sufficient number, the nearest adjoining Parishes are entitled to the same privilege. One Hundred and Thirty-five Boys are admitted upon the Foundation ; viz., One Hundred and Twenty into the Eng lish and Writing School ; and Fifteen into the Latin. The number of Boys, not upon the Foundation, is inconsiderable. Boys are admitted at Six years of age. There is no spe cific time for their quitting the School. As Vacancies occur other Boys are admitted, whose names stand first on a list which is kept by the Head Master. The application of every one in behalf of any boy is registered ;"], [108, "BUCKS.

Owen's Latin Grammar, and the Eton Greek Grammar, are those in general use. With respect to the system of Education, the Classical Books which are used in the great Public Schools, are adopted, as far as the age and continuance of the Scholars will admit. Dr. Bell s system is followed in the English and Writing School. There are no Exhibitions, Scholarships, nor Church Pre ferments, belonging to this School. Tlie present Head Master is, Charles Robert Ashfield, Clerk, whose Salary is \u00a3170. per annum, and a House.

But this Establishment afterwards underwent certain altera tions."], [111, "Eton College.] BUCKS. 49 It must, however, be observed, that the first formal act of The King respecting his projected Foundation, was his \" Pro curatorium,\" bearing date the 1 2th of September, 1440. By this public instrument he delegates his Proctors to treat with The Bishop and Chapter of Lincoln, for the appropriation of the then Parish Church of Eton to his intended College, so as to make the Chapel of the said College, which he should erect on the demolition of the old Church, to be as well Parochial as Collegiate. Indeed, from the words of the Instrument, it appears that His Majesty had already pur chased the Advowson of the said Parish Church, in order to effect the proposed Appropriation. And on the 29th of September, in the same year, The Bishop of Lincoln notified his consent, in all due form, for making the Parish Church of Eton Collegiate. Some delay was, however, caused in this purchase, 3as there were three joint Owners of the Perpetual Advowson, and of the Tenements contiguous, which were conveyed with it; \u2014 William Whaplade, Nicholas Clopton, and John Faryndon, Equires. There used to prevail a local tradition, that the ancient Parish Church stood somewhere at The Wick, about a mile from Eton ; but in what particular spot is not said, nor is it at this day pretended that there are, or have been any visible remains of the same. That it stood in the Church-yard, and near adjoining to the present Church, is evident from two Charters: Carta Regis Hen. VI. de Fundatione Eccl. Colleg. de Eton. Pat. 19\u00b0 Hen.

The Royal Founder having caused certain Statutes to be composed, which were called \" Statuta Primitiva,\" with a view to their being enlarged into a complete Body, as future circumstances and experience might demand, was pleased, on the Feast of St. Thomas, in 1443, to send down his Commissioners, Thomas Beckynton, then Bishop of Bath and Wells, with William, Earl, and afterwards Marquis and Duke, of Suffolk, to give personal admission to The Provost, Fellows, Clerks, Scholars, and Officers, into The College. Which Ceremony was accompanied with all the most solemn Ceremonials of the Altar. About this time, it appears that the King extended his Collegiate arrangements from Twenty-five to Seventy Scho lars, an Usher for the School, a Clerk for the Parish, and two additional Choristers, with a reduction of the Twenty five Alms or Beadsmen to Thirteen. The several Grants, made at sundry times, were, for their better confirmation, passed into an Act of Parliament at Westminster, on the 4th of May, 1444, being the Twenty second year of his reign. The Letters Patent subsequent to this period, granting further endowmenrs to The College, with the gifts of certain Benefactors, were afterwards con densed into another and similar Act of Parliament, in the Thirty-eighth year of his reign. The Statutes being completed, the Archbishop of Canter- bury, on the 20th of July, 1446, acknowledged his accept ance of them, as well for himself as his successors. At the E2"], [114, "BUCKS. [Eton Cgllege. 52 same time, The Bishop of Lincoln declared similar accepta tion. This formality arose from the Spiritual power of these high Ecclesiastical characters : The College being subject to them in their Metropolitan and Triennial Visitations, as well as in the necessary and local exercise of their functions, whenever they might be called to employ them within the walls of the Foundation. These Statutes, the work of several years, were a refine ment as well as enlargement of the temporary Code, or \" Statuta Primitiva,\" and the consequent result of much deliberate consideration. In compiling them, The Royal Founder is said to have been assisted by the ablest Civilian of those times, and whose knowledge would have conferred honour on any man in any age. This distinguished person was William Lyndewoode, LL. D., Lord Privy Seal, and Bishop of St. David's. It appears, however, to be the more probable opinion, that Waynflete drew up the present body of Statutes, which Bishop Lowth mentions, (though, as it should seem, without actual collation) as being originally copied from those of Winchester, without any material alteration. The frequency of Henry's visits to Winchester, and the apparent objects of them, together with Wayn flete's continual attendance upon him, with the general approximation of the Eton Statutes to the Winchester Code, appear to justify the general idea; and the tradition Of William of Wykeham's College is ready to confirm it. Lyndewoode was certainly appointed, with others, to form the Statutes of King's College, Cambridge, as is evident from it's Charter; and, it is probable that, from this cir cumstance, he has been named as having performed the same Office for the Sister Foundation. William Waynflete was Schoolmaster of Winchester College, when the King made his first visit. He had been in that capacity about eleven years, and had executed the"], [115, "Eton College.] BUCKS. 53 important trust with such diligence, ability, judgment, and success, that Henry, to give his new Institution the greatest possible advantage, by obtaining such an excellent and im proved Instructor, removed him, in 1440, with a Colony of five of the Fellows and thirty-five of the Scholars, to the same honourable charge at Eton. His Majesty afterwards made him Provost; and, by his Royal recommendation and Patronage, he was subsequently elevated to the Sec of Win chester, in which high situation he was enabled to become a beneficent Imitator of his predecessor William of Wyke ham, as well as of his Patron Sovereign, in his Noble Foundation of Magdalen College, in Oxford. King Henry having made a final Settlement of his Col lege at Eton, and that upon a more enlarged scale than he appears at first to have contemplated, was now pleased to add ten Chaplains, five Clerks, and eight Choristers, form ing a Constituent Body,' consisting of a Provost, ten Fellows,* a Master of the School, ten Chaplains,f an Usher of the * In 147 y there appear to have been but Four Fellows.

In 1482 the number of Fellows was incre^ed to .Six, pro- bably by the good management and savings of good Provost Westbury.

When the King looked upon his Foundation, so formed, constituted, and endowed; \u2014 when he took a prospective view of it's final completion, and reflected upon the benefits which promised to result from it to his Kingdom, not only in his own time, but in many successive ages, \u2014 well might He, with the Piety of a Holy man, and the feelings of a tender Parent, address Heaven with frequent Prayers for it's pre servation and endurance in it's then existing state ; \u2014 And, as the Nation should increase in Knowledge, Virtue, and the higher branches of Civilization, that his Foundation might proceed in a proportionably advanced and advancing state of Improvement, Usefulness, and Renown, until the end of time. Certain changes have, however, since taken place in the order of The College, which now consists of a Provost, Seven Fellows, Two Priests or Chaplains (locally called Conducts), Ten Lay Clerks, Ten Choristers, Two Masters, and Seventy Scholars, with inferior Officers and Servants.

For, Henry having designed his School to be a Seminary for a College in one of The Universities, accordingly, in 1411, founded King's College, Cambridge, whither, Lambarde observes, \" Eton annually sendeth forth her ripe fruit.\" That Princely Institution consisting of a Pro vost, and Seventy Fellows or Scholars, who are to be elected from Eton College. As Henry approached his demise, he seems to have had a foreboding of the troubles which then threatened to disturb the Nation, and showed a warm solicitude to insure, at all events, the completion of his Two Colleges. He accord ingly made a Testamentary provision for that purpose, and appointed Bishop Waynflete to discharge the honourable duties which it directed. Eton College, however, found an Oppressor in Edward the Fourth, who, for some time, appeared to threaten it with annihilation. That Monarch is related to have been un kindly disposed, not only to Waynflete and other attached friends of Henry the Sixth, but is said to have looked with an evil and a jealous eye upon the Establishments formed by the pious Munificence of his Royal Predecessor, and in the prosperity of which Waynflete had manifested and expressed such a fond and zealous interest. At no distant period after King Edward the Fourth had got possession of the Throne, he represented to Pope Pius the Second, that Eton College was in an unfinished state, and especially that the building of the Chapel was but just be gun, 3so that it could be of little or no use as to the purposes originally intended by it's Foundation; He, therefore, urged it as a suitable act to unite it to The College of Windsor, which he favoured with a most partial and protecting regard. In consequence of this representation, in November, 1463,"], [118, "[Eton College. BUCKS. 56 a Bull was obtained from Pope Pics the Second, for dis solving Eton College, and uniting it, according to the Royal request, to The College of St. George at Wind sor. The Copy of the Bull of Union and Annexation is among the Harleian Manuscripts in The British Museum, N\u00b0. 564. Habbington, in his life of Edward the Fourth, states, that the King took \u00a31000. per annum from Henry's Es tablishments, to enrich Windsor. Tanner, in his Notitia Monastica, specifies also the Priories which were seized from this Foundation, to be lavishly given to other places and avari cious persons. And, in the Archives of Eton College, is an account of the Estates of which it has been unjustly deprived. However, in this opprobrious appropriation of The College property, some glimpse of shame and justice was shown for the Members of it, \u2014 a few trifling Pensions being assigned to the Provost, Fellows, and other Officers. Thus it appears, that Edward, counselled as he might originally have been by The Earl of Warwick, not only, in the first instance, curtailed the estates of Henry's Foun dations of King's College, and Eton, but plundered them also of moveables of great value. The injured Foundation, however, found an able, ardent, and, in the end, an effectual friend in William West bury, who had succeeded John Clerc, as Provost, in the year 14 17- He possessed consummate prudence and cou rage; nor did he hesitate most strenuously to oppose The Union of Eton College with that of Windsor ; but boldly asserted the rights and privileges of the Body over which he had presided so many years ; and, by refusing to acquiesce while Henry was a fugitive, and Waynflete in disgrace, as well as by his noble protest and appeal, he protected the Munificence and upheld the Institution of his Founder. The opposition which was made by Westbury, was in the most open, regular, and courageous manner, by a public"], [119, "Eton College.] BUCKS. 57 instrument in the Chapel of fitt. Martin le Grand, London, before a Public Notary and the most respectable witnesses, men graduated and learned in the laws. He there in per son entered his Protest against all such Union and Incorpo ration, with uncommon intrepidity and spirit, and in words warm with zeal and the vehicle of irresistible argument. In consequence of this proceeding, the King applied to Pope Paul the Second, the Successor of Pius the Second, acknowledging that he had been misinformed in the pre mises, and praying for a Dissolution ofthe Union. The Pope accordingly issued his Commission, dated the sixth year of his Pontificate, to Bourchier Archbishop of Canterbury, to act in the business .as the case might appear to require. In obedience to the Papal command, the Archbishop summoned the two Colleges before him : When the Provost, who relaxed not for a moment in his magnanimous zeal for the Foundations of Henry the Sixth, harangued with un daunted firmness, and, as he is described, \" se totis viribus opposuit,\" for the rights of his imprisoned Founder. The merit of his conduct was acknowledged by his oppo nents, and it is recorded in the Register of Windsor College. The Dissolution of The \" Bulla Unionh\" was accordingly sent from Rome to the Archbishop. And King Edward, by Letters Patent, dated the 17th of July, in the Seventh year of his reign, 1468, m.ade certain remunerations, if they were not altogether restorations, for the violent injury which he had done to Eton College ; employing, at the same time, conciliatory expressions of regard, and declaring his wishes for it's future welfare and prosperity.* * \" Etonense etiam Collegium authoritate regali, neenon pa pali, Pii scilicet secundi, huic Regi\u00e6 Capell\u00e6 annectitur, et ap-"], [120, "[Eton College.

This is altogether differing from a Deanery or an Hospital; which being Livings without Cure have been and may be, justly confer'd by his Majesty on Laymen with dispensations de non promovendo. If Sir Henry Savil's example be objected, I answer (besides that ye Queen made claim to ye gift of ye place by lapse, occasioned through ye Promotion of ye Provost to ye Bishopric of Chichester, whereas his Majesty had no such Claim thereunto at this time) That Savil never durst take true Possession of ye place, but was only slipt in by ye Bishop (who for fear of ye Earl of Essex made bold with ye Conscience) Ad Curam et Regimen Collegii, that is, to ye Care and Government of ye College : Whereas by ye express words of ye Foundation he is to be admitted Ad Curam animarum Parochiarum Eccles'i\u00e6 \u00c6tonian\u0153, to ye Cure of Souls of ye Parish of Eaton. Secondly, I hold it no Disparagement to Mr. Murray (nor do I find him altogether averse from ye same) to enter into Orders in ye Reign of a King so favourable to our Coat, as (God's name be prais'd for it) Reigns now over us. This will give Satisfaction to all ye Church bring him into his place according to Statute and ye Foundation of that dead King prevent such dangerous president for a Layman to possess cure of Souls in ye Eye and Centre of ye Realm, and be an Everlasting Testimony of his Majesties Piety to ye Church of England.

All this I most humbly beg Yor Lordship to make known to his Highness and as much as Yor Lordship thinks fitt thereof to his Majesty, I will only add one Note and so end ; It will be no more disparagement to Mr. Murray his Highness School-nuister to enter into Order then it was to Coxe K.

The Dignity of the Office of Provost of Eton has been an object of great solicitude. Sir Thomas Wyat wittily prayed Henry the Eighth to bestow the Provostship upon him, as a Living of \u00a3 1 00. a year more than enough, \u2014 \" where a man hath his diet, his lodging, his horse-meat, his servant's wages, his riding charge, and a Hundred pounds per annum besides.\" Lord Bacon petitioned James the First for the Provost ship, after his disgrace. In the month of August, 1665, Charles the Second, unsolicited, nominated Robert Boyle, to the Provostship; which, after mature deliberation, though contrary to the advice of all his friends, he absolutely declined. In the same year, Edmund Waller, the Poet, asked from the King the Provostship, and obtained it ; but Lord Clarendon refused to put the seal to the grant, alleging that it could be holden only by a Clergyman. It is known that Sir Henry Wotton qualified himself for it by Dea con's Orders. To this opposition, the \" Biogra'phia\" im putes the violence and acrimony with which Waller joined Buckingham's faction in the prosecution of Clarendon. A year after the Chancellor's banishment, another vacancy gave him encouragement for another Petition, which the King referred to the Council, who, after hearing the ques-"], [138, "[Eton College. BUCKS. 76 tion argued by Lawyers for three days, determined that the office could be holden only by a Clergyman, according to the Act of Uniformity, since the Provosts had always re ceived Institution, as for a Parsonage, from the Bishops of Lincoln The King then said, he could not break the law which he had made: and Dr. Zachary Cradock, famous for a single Sermon, at most for two Sermons, was chosen by the Fellows. The Master, and Lower Master, of the School are elected by . he Provost and Fellows. The qualifications chiefly required for Master are, that he have sufficient skill in teaching Grammar; that he be a Master of Arts ; not married, nor preferred in any College, or Chapel or Church with Cure of Souls, within a mile of Eton : of honest report ; who shall constantly and diligently attend on teaching the Collegers, Choristers, and all others, who, for the sake of Learning, shall come from any part of England ; to have also regard to their lives and manners ; and especially to the good behaviour of the Col legers, and those Choristers, who shall be of the School. The person to be elected to the Office of Lower Master, is to be sufficiently well versed in Grammar Learning ; not married ; nor in Holy Orders ; a Bachelor of Arts ; of good character ; and who shall diligently assist the Master, w'hen present, and, in his absence, shall supply his place ac cording to the utmost of his power. The principal design of The Founder, in the establish ment of his Foundations at Eton and Cambridge, appears to have been, for the education of Scholars in Grammar Learning; who being afterwards properly graduated in Academical Degrees, might be qualified for Holy Orders, and make an increase of Clergy. Accordingly, the Royal Founder making known his intention of a College at Eton, mentions the Scholars first, and they are the only persons who are designated with a name of distinction. They arc"], [139, "Eton College.] BUCKS. 77 also particularized by the name of \" Scholares Clerici,\" hereby intimating their designation ah origine for Orders in the Church. The Scholars are named in the Statutes next after the Provost; and they are to be Seventy in number.0 The Statutable qualifications of these Scholars are, that they be \" Pauper es et Indigentes\" ; of good Morals, docible, competently skilled in Reading, Chanting, and Grammar ; not under Eight years of age ; they are eligible 'till Fifteen; two years must intervene before their names can appear on the Indentures for King's College. Preference is to be given to Boys born in those Parishes where Eton or King's College have Estates, provided they are born in England or Wales ; next, to those born in the Counties of Buckingham or Cambridge, if the Electors judge them competent; \u00e6id due respect is ordered to be had to the Choristers of Eton and King's College. No illegitimate person, or who has any incurable Disease, or is so maimed in his limbs as to be incapable of entering into Holy Orders, is on any account to be admitted Any possession of an Estate exceeding 5 marks (or, \u00a3i..6..8) per annum, is a disqualification. But the compa rative value of money is, of course, now considered. None are to continue in College beyond their Eighteenth year, unless they are nominated in the Indenture of the preceding election to King's College, in which case they may continue at Eton until they are Nineteen years old complete, and this is locally called \" Lhe year qf Grace.\" But be yond that period, they are not to continue upon the Foun dation on any account whatever. The time of Election of Scholars for Eton, and King's, is on that Monday which the Provost and Master of Eton o By the express desire or rather Command of the present King, George the Third, Collegers have been for Thirty years past, called \" King's Scholars.\""], [140, "BUCKS. [Eton College 78 shall name, out of two continuous Mondays (such at least has been the uniform practice since the Restoration) pro posed to them by the Provost of King's College, between the Feast of St. Thomas a, Becket (the 7*h of July) and of The Assumption of The Blessed Mary (the 1 5th of August). But, for above Sixty years with very few exceptions, it has been on the last Monday in July. When all persons, as above qualified, may offer themselves for Examination. The Provost of King's is to send such notice, so that, Seven weeks beforehand, Schedules of the day appointed for ex amination may be fixed up at the Western Door of the Chapel, and at the great Gate of the College. This notice has, from time immemorial, been sent on the Whit-Tuesday of each year. The Examiners or Electors are, The Provost of Eton, The Provost or in his absence The Vice-Provost of King's, The Vice-Provost of Eton, The Senior Poser (a Fellow of King's, of the Degree of Master of Arts), The Master of Eton School, and The Junior Poser (a Fellow of King's, of the like Degree of Master of Arts). The said Electors being met in the great Parlour of the Provost, generally called \" The Election Chamber?' and having seen that the Indentures of the last Election have been fully executed by the Admission of the Scholars, therein nominated, into Eton College, and the Dismission of the Scholars therein nominated for King's, according to the Vacancies that have happened in the [said College, and in the proper order ; and having cancelled the said Indentures, and having heard read to them the third and fourth of the Eton Statutes, and the Act of Queen Elizabeth against Simony, &c, proceed to the Examination of Scholars as well for Eton as for King's ; having first taken their cor poral Oath on The Holy Evangelists, that they will faith fully observe, and diligently put in execution, the Statutes which they have heard read. The usual method for electing Scholars on the Eton"], [141, "Eton College.] BUCKS. 79 Foundation is, The Provost of Eton elects the first, third, fifth, seventh, thirteenth, and nineteenth ; \u2014 The Provost of King's elects the second, fourth, sixth, eighth, fourteenth, and twentieth ; \u2014 The Vice-Provost elects the ninth, fifteenth, and twenty-first : \u2014 The Senior Poser elects the tenth, six teenth, and twenty-second ; \u2014 The Master elects the eleventh, seventeenth, and twenty-third ; \u2014 and The Junior Poser elects the twelfth, eighteenth, and twenty-fourth. Should the number exceed Twenty-four, the Provost of Eton would nominate the twenty-fifth, and the Provost of King's the twenty-sixth ; beyond this number no Indenture has ever extended. When any vacancy happens at King's, the Provost or Vice-Provost is to notify the same to the Provost (or Vice- Provost) and Master at Eton, within ten days after their receiving notice of such vacancy ; and the Provost (or Vice- Provost) and Master are to declare the vacancy within three days from the receipt of the Letter, when the next upon the Roll is to be sent off, who must be at King's within Twenty days from the time of the Declaration ofthe vacancy being notified at Eton ; and be admitted at King's, as a Probationary Scholar, within three days from the time of his appearance. The Statute mentions no particular number to be nomi nated at such Election, either for Eton or King's ; But it is certain, that no proof can be adduced of more than Twelve names having been ever entered on the Indentures for King's College ; and the number of Twenty-four has been very rarely exceeded on the Indenture for Eton : That, from 1660 to the present day, such has been the practice is certain from the Register at Eton. The Statute provides only, that, if before the first of May there shall be Six or more vacancies in King's which cannot be filled up by those nominated in the Indenture, then there shall be another Election in like form. The Provost of King's giving Fifteen"], [142, "BUCKS. [Eton College. 80 days notice of the same ; that so the business may be finished, and the vacancies filled up before the end of May. But to prevent the trouble and expense in a second Elec tion, the usual way is now to elect Twenty-four Scholars (if so many offer themselves) upon the Foundation of Eton, and to nominate Twelve of the Senior Scholars for King's College ; the said Scholars to succeed regularly, as vacan cies shall happen in both Foundations. The Scholars who are elected upon the Foundation at Eton are to be admitted into College within eight days, after a vacancy in the same ; or, if absent, they are to be cited by Schedules to appear at Eton within Twenty dajs from the time that such monition thereof is fixed up against the Folding-doors at the West end of the Church. Their failure herein, is the forfeiture of their Election ; as it is also at King's, if they are not present within the like time appointed for them. The Election is to be at no other place than Eton- If disputes arise in the course of the Examination, the decision is to be made by the majority of the Electors. Nor is any accident of death or unavoidable absence of any of the Electors to frustrate, or abrogate the Election. There is no recorded instance of any Election at which Three Electors from King's College were not present. In case of the Provost's illness, the Vice Provost, or some Senior Fellow, appears for him. If any of the Eton Electors be ill, no Substitute is appointed. It is ordered by The Statutes, that all the Scholars upon the Foundation should be taught gratis, (and so are some to this day), and the Masters on their Admission swear not to exact any payment. But it should seem, that an unwil lingness on the part of Parents to have a reproachful dis tinction made between their sons upon The Foundation, and the Oppidans, has gradually led to an innovation on this head."], [143, "Eton College.] BUCKS. 81 The King's Scholars are lodged, have Commons, and a Gown. The Statutes restrict the whole expense of them to a definite sum, which, it is believed, they now actually cost The College. Commons were formerly allowed to sick boys ; but so wide a door was opened to abuse and irregularity, that, by order ofthe Master, the practice was- discontinued. The evil was found to be very great, and due care could not be taken of those who were really ill. The Vacancies which occur at King's, arise from Eccle siastical Preferment, Marriage, voluntary Resignation, or Death of it's Fellows ; and these have been usually about Nine in Two years. After the expiration of Three years from the day of their Admission at King's, they are received as Fellows upon that Foundation. But the Statutes suppose at , least regular behaviour, general industry, &c. Their Admission into their Fellowships is any thing but compulsory. The Independent Scholars, or \" Oppidans,\" as they are universally denominated, are very numerous. Some, mostly of high Birth or the Children of opulent Parents, arc boarded in the Houses of the Lower Master and the Assistants ; \u2014 some few in private Houses under the care of Individuals, who are locally stiled \" Private Tutors ;\" \u2014 and the rest in the respective Boarding-Houses, the presiding Masters and Mistresses of which enjoy the prescriptive Title of \" Domine \" and \" Dame.\" The present Terms, for the Education and Board of Oppidans, are only, \u2014 The Master, - - - - \u00a36.. 6.0 Tutor, .... 10..10..0 Board, Washing, and Servants, Sec, - 50.. 0..0 Other Expenses, exclusive of Extra Masters, ought not to exceed - 33.. 4..0 G \u00a3100.. 0..0 VOL. I."], [144, "[Eton College. BUCKS. 82 That is to say, if the Parent is prudent, and the expenses of the boy are properly restricted, the annual Charge ought not to exceed One Hundred Pounds per annum. A sum far less than the Public in general imagine, and deserving the highest commendations of every friend to Learning. But, in many instances, the improper concessions of Parents and the consequent extravagance of the boys themselves, more than double this sum. The expenses of the Oppidans who reside in the Houses of their Tutors, or of those who have Private Tutors, amount to a very large sum ; but of this description the number hardly ever exceeds Twenty, and they are the sons of Noblemen, or Gentlemen of very large fortunes. On the Monday in the Week of the Public Examination, The Election Holidays, as they are called, take place for the Boys not upon The Foundation, which for them last Five weeks; but the Vacation of The King's Scholars does not commence, until the following Wednesday. There is also rather more than a Month of Recess at Christmas, and rather more than a Fortnight at Easter. The present number of Boys is Four Hundred and Seventy one. A circumstance, which, as it far exceeds any former period, is peculiarly honourable to the Talents and Care of it's able Masters ; and amply confirms the renowned Character and Prosperity of the School. Stet Fortuna Domus ! By a Patent of Edward the Fourth, in the Eighteenth year of his reign, 1479, a Licence is granted to The Provost and College of Eton, to purchase lands in per- petuity to the yearly value of Twenty Pounds, being an exemption to that amount from the operation of the Statute of Mortmain. On the Union of the Houses of York and Lancaster under Henry the Seventh, (who was educated at Eton), the Sove reign power appeared to regard this College with a more"], [145, "Eton College.] BUCKS. 83 favourable aspect : as, by an Act of Parliament in the Fourth year of that Monarch's reign, 14S9, the King confirmed this Foundation in it's Charters and Privileges. He also re stored some of the Estates of which it had been wantonly despoiled, and granted Licences to divers persons, to enable them to give or to bequeath their lands to The College, notwithstanding the act of Mortmain. By th\u00bb Patent, to which reference has just been made, it appears, that Edward the Fourth gave, among other re compensing acts, in free, pure, and perpetual alms, the Priory of Ponnington, in the County of Dorset, with the lands, tenements, and appurtenances, thereunto belonging in Melbourne, Cheke, and Charleton, in the same County : With this Proviso, that, from the revenues of the , same, five Students should be maintained at Oxford, who had received their education at the School of Eton. This Priory was afterwards exchanged by The College with Henry the Eighth, in the Thirty-eighth year of his reign : but, what reserve was made for the fulfilment of the forego ing proviso, when the Exchange was confirmed in the first year of Edward the Sixth, does not appear. Eton also sends Two Scholars to Mertou College, Oxford, called \" Portionist\u0153,\" or, by a singular corruption of the term, \" Post-Masters.\" They were established by The Revd.

In I 75 ', the day was changed, on the suggestion of Dr. Barnard, from the first Tuesday in Hilary Term, which commences on the J3d of January, to the Tuesday in Whit sun Week, a much more favourable season of the year for such a Show ; besides, the Whitsuntide Holidays had, a few years before, been transferred for Five weeks at the period of the Election ; and the Ceremonial was extended from every second to every third year. The first Triennial Montem was in 1778, in the Master ship of Dr. Davies. It consists of a Procession of the boys in a kind of Mili tary order, to a small Tumulus on the Southern side of the Bath road, which gives the name of\" Suit Hill \" to a place so well known for the spacious Inns that distinguish it. Here the Collegiate Regiment dines ; and, after a Latin Prayer has been read upon The Mount, returns in the same order in which it issued forth. The Head boy of The King's Scholars, called \" The Marshal,\" takes the lead, as the Captain of the Cohort, bearing a truncheon with the same inscription which is adopted as the Motto on the Colours. The Colours, deco rated with the Arms of the College, and the Motto (which is not always, though it is generally), \" Pro More et Monte,\" are borne by another : And the different Ranks, in as regular subordination as can be expected, are filled by the respective Classes according to the order of the School. Until the good sense of Dr. Barnard interposed to cor-v rect the customary absurdities of this ceremony, the Theatres"], [150, "[Eton College. BUCKS. 88 and Monmouth Street, contributed to clothe, in every variety of tawdry dresses, this youthful Corps. Mr. Bryant occa sionally mentioned, that one of the dresses usually hired for the purpose, was that of Rodcrigo, and that the unfortunate Wearer for the time being, obtained the appellation of \" The silly Gentleman? But the judicious interference of Dr. Barnard in the first instance, followed up by a better taste in approaching more nearly to a regular Military dress, has considerably improved the appearance of the Procession. Whatever might have been the original motive to this Festival, the present object is principally to collect money from all the spectators of the Show, as it is called, for Salt. The two chief Collectors or Salt-Bearers are, a King's Scholar and an Oppidan, whose activity will enable them to go through the fatigues of the day. The former is gener ally the Second boy in the School, and the latter the Cap tain of the Oppidans, unless they choose to wave their privilege respectively to the next in succession. They are arrayed in light and elegant dresses, each bearing a silk bag, with, as is said, a small quantity of Salt in it, to receive the Contributions : They are followed each by an active man, dressed in a plain white dress adorned with the same colours, who gives Tickets to those who have paid their Salt. They are assisted by Twelve other boys, all King's Scholars, and generally the first Twelve of the Fifth Form, in somewhat similar, though less expensive dresses, who range the country as far as Maidenhead Bridge and Colnebrooke, \u2014 custom forbidding the demand of Contribu butions out of the County of Buckingham. This Ceremony is always very numerously attended by Etonians ; the neighbouring Gentry come from a distance to witness it, and the Relations of the Scholars may be supposed to feel an interest in such a Spectacle. It has, for above Forty years, been regularly honoured by the Presence of their Majesties, or the Prince Regent, accompanied by the different branches of The Royal Family."], [151, "Eton College.] BUCKS. 89 The sum collected upon the occasion, has been known to exceed \u00a3 1 000. ; but the expenses of a magnificent Breakfast, the Dinner to half the School, Music, Fees, &c., amount to nearly half the Collection, the remainder of which becomes the property of The King's Scholar, who is Captain of the School. The Hunting of the Ram was also a very ancient Custom, which has very properly been abolished. The College had an ancient claim upon it's Butcher, to provide a Ram on the Election Saturday, to be hunted by the Scholars ; but the animal having, upon one occasion, been so pressed as to swim across the Thames, it ran into Windsor Market, with the boys after it, and much mischief was caused by this unexpected accident. The health of the Scholars had also suffered at tunes from the length of the chase, and the heat of the season. The character of the sport was, therefore, changed about the year 1740, when the Ram was ham-strung, and, after the speech, was knocked on the licad with large twisted Clubs, which are reported to have been considered as Etonian Curiosities. But the barbarity of the amusement caused it to be altogether laid aside at the Election in 1747? and the flesh\" of the Ram given to be prepared in Pasties. The Dish still continues nomi nally to grace the Election Monday Dinner, though the Meat no longer boasts it's original Toughness, being in Fact the Flesh of excellent Wethers. Among those who have so numerously adorned the higher Ranks of Life, \u2014 who have attained Eminence for superior Learning, or have distinguished themselves as Divines, as Statesmen, and Benefactors of Mankind, and the Founda tion of whose Celebrity and Morals were laid in this renowned School,\u2014 how shall the Selectisn be made?\u2014 -And what number of volumes would contain them ! ! !"], [152, "[Eton, BUCKS 90 THE CHURCH, COLLEGE, and PARISH of ETON The Church, College, and Parish of Eton are exempt from all Visitation of the Archdeacon of Buckingham.

But the question has never been pressed upon the Master, during a period of Fifty yisars. Mr. Conon is known to have educated One Scholar without fee, who afterwards distinguished himself by his acquire ments : And the present Master, in more instances than one, has given boys their education gratis. But this arose from Charity, and not from any Obligation. Bovs are admitted at about eight or nine years of age, if they can read English. The number of Scholars, upon an average for the last ten years, has been Fifty. The Eton Latin and Greek Grammars are at present in use ; and the system of Education is similar to that of Eton College.

And it would seem, that the School was built very soon after by his Executors, as the Doorway has the date of 1583 upon it. On the 15th of June, 1585, a second Patent was granted by Queen Elizabeth in confirmation of the former, reci ting the several particulars, and specially directing that the Statutes and Ordinances, which had been made by the Archbishop, should from time to time, for ever thereafter, be observed and kept inviolable. On the 25th of June, 1604, King James the First, in augmentation of the original Endowment, granted to the Wardens and Governors of the School, and their Successors for ever, \u2014 All those Sixteen messuages or tenements, situate in the Vill or Hamlet of Sandwith, in the County of Cumberland, in the possession of William Laths, John Sympson, and others, being late parcel of the possessions of the Dissolved Cell of St. Bees, and late belonging to the Monastery of St. Mary near York : \u2014 And all that Sheep-pasture, or Common of Pasture for 300 sheep, called \" Sandwith Marsh,\" in the said County, in the pos session of William Latus, late part of the possessions of the Cell of St. Bees :\u2014 And all that messuage, called \" Sea Cote,\" in the demesne of St. Bees, parcel of the said Dissolved Cell, in the possession of Anthony Hardknee : \u2014 And all those Forty-eight messuages in the possession of William Gibson, and others, within the Vill and Fields of Kirkby Beacock, late parcel of the said Cell : \u2014 And all that yearly Rent of 45s..2d.\u00a7, issuing out of Two mes suages, called \" Nether Walton, and Lockeridge,\" and the fog gage and after pasture of a Meadow, called \" The Green Hayg,\" situate in Kirkby Beacock, in the possession of William Latus, and Edmund Skelton : \u2014 And an annual Rent of 22s..lld|. issuing out of Two messua ges in Kirkby Beacock, in the possession of Thomas Hodgson, and Robert Painter : \u2014"], [225, "Saint Bees.] CUMBERLAND. 163 And .all that Meadow, called \" Sowermyre,\" in Kirkby Beacock, in the possession of James Grindall, Clerk, and James Cros thwaite : \u2014 And all that foggage or after pasture of a meadow, called \" The Goseying,\" in possession of Richard Young : \u2014 And all that foggage in a Meadow near \" The Beck-Mill,\" in the possession of William Latus : \u2014 The yearly rent of 16s. .Sd., called \" Walk-mill Silver,\" paya ble in common among the Tenants of the Manor of St. Bees : \u2014 And of 24s., issuing out of the Manor of Hensingham, late John Skelton, Esqr's. : \u2014 And all those Four Messuages in Hensingham, and Wray, in the possession of John Grindall, and others, and all perquisites and profits of Courts there valued at, communibus annis, 2s.. 6d. a year : \u2014 All which premises were late parcel of the lands and posses sions of Sir Thomas Chaloner, Knt., dece^ed, and by a particu lar survey were valued at 4'28..8..0| per annum : \u2014 To be holden as of the Manor of Sheriff Hutton, in the County of York, in free soccage. An Act of Parliament was soon after passed, confirming this Grant. In the year 160S, The Wardens and Governors granted to the Tenants in St. Bees, and Sandwith, leases of the several tenements, which had been 3given by the Royal Grant in 1604, for the term of One Thousand yem-s, \u2014 which, it is said, Archbishop Bancroft obliged the Governors to do. The present annud value of these lands is supposed to be at least \u00a38000., \u2014 but the revenue arising from them to the School, is stated to be less than \u00a3 1 00. In the above mentioned Leases a reservation is made of the Royalties, &c, and of the Mines and Minerals on the pre mises so leased, and also of the stone and slate necessary for the repair of the School and it's premises. It appears that Lord Lonsdale, who is one of the Go vernors, claims the Royalties belonging to the School as granted to the Lowther Family by lease from the Go vernors:\u2014it does not appear, what rent is paid for this lease, as the sum reported as the rent, is said by others to be in"], [226, "CUMBERLAND.

They let on lease an Alabaster Quarry, which forms the chief part of the Revenue of the School, at \u00a360. per annum. They hold a Court an nually in the School-house. A field, a few years since, came to the School, for want, it is believed, of some person to claim it as heir, the owner dying suddenly, \u2014 being a part of what is now called \" School land,\" and holden under the Leases granted in 1608. The parcel of Land, called in King James's grant, \" .Sandwith Marsh?'' is said to have been leased about 40 or 50 years since, at \u00a3 10. per annum, a sum very inadequate to it's present value. On the 15th of January, 1629, William Hickbarrow, the then Master, addressed a most sorrowful petition to The Bishop of Chester, which he styles \" A true Relation of the State and Government of the Free Grammar School of St. Bees.\" After describing the Foundation, and the impropriety of the lease of \" Palmers Fields?\"1 \u2014 he adds, \" The \u00a3500. left in monies to purchase \u00a330. per annum to the maintenance of the School, are all wasted and spent and no land therewith purchased, to the School's loss of \u00a330. per annum for ever. \" The lands of \u00a328..8..0. old rent, given by His Majesty, are also leased out for a Thousand years for 40s. a year in increase of rent, and \u00a3120. in lieu of a Fine, which lands, if they were rightly disposed, were worth 100 marks per annum at the least, \u2014 which \u00a3'120. hath rested in other men's hands for the space of 20 years, without any use or benefit to the School ; and is in danger to be lost, through the Governors' negligence to call for it. \" None of the Founder's godlie Statutes for six or seven years have been observed by the Governors, \u2014 noe Generall Meetings in all that time, \u2014 noe Receivor chosen, nor Accompt made in soe long a space, \u2014 noe Wages paid to the Scholemaster and"], [227, "Saint Bees.] CUMBERLAND. 165 Usher, for a whole yeare last past, \u2014 noe Schollars examined, \u2014 noe Schole-rents gathered for the space of two yeares last, or thereabouts, \u2014 noe Arrearages of rents levied, albeit the Governors are inabled to distreyn for non-payment of rent, \u2014 and albeit divers of the Schole tenants are behinde with their rents, some 20 marks, some 10, some more, some less. \u2014 All the Schole is out of frame, and the Governors (as it were) connived utterlie to overthrow it.

The School will now (in 1817) commence with nearly 60. All applicants are admitted after seven years of age, and there is no super annuation. The form of admission is the entering of the name of the individual to be admitted, into a book kept for that purpose, \u2014 the age, and place of abode, as well as the day of entrance being inserted. The Eton Latin and Greek Grammars are in use. Valpv's Greek Gramme is also placed in the hands of the Upper Classes, after they have been well igrounded in the Eton ; and the Classical Authors are such as are usually read in great Schools. Writing also and arithmetic, geography, English grammar, and various branches of Mathematics are taught by a Third Master, who has a quarterly charge on those who receive such instructions, the School being only free for the Classics. There are Two Exhibitions of \u00a325. per annum each, at Queen's College, Oxford, founded by Dr. Thomas, late Bishop of Rochester, for the sons of Clergymen of the Diocese of Carlisle, and educated at the Schools of Carlisle .and St. Bees. A St. Bees Scholar has also the privilege of becoming a Candidate for one of the Five valuable Exhibitions left by Lady Elizabeth Hastings. See, Leeds. Young men from St. Bees usually enter at Queen's Col lege, in Oxford, because the Foundation of that College is reserved for Cumberland and Westmorland Students only.

It is not clearly ascertained, who was the Founder of the Grammar School of Whitcham and Millom. In the Chancery Suit between the Inhabitants of these two Parishes, which continued from 1687 to 1691, \u2014 it was contended by the Inhabitants of Millom, that the School had been endowed by one of the Kings of England, prior to the reign of Queen Elizabeth, \u2014 whereas it was insisted upon by the Inhabitants of Whitcham, that the School had been endowed by a person of the name of \" Hodgson,\" a native of Whitcham. The probability is, that the Inhabitants of Whitcham were in the right, because as the Parish of Millom both in extent and in population is six times greater than the Parish of Whitcham, it is not likely the School would have been called \" Whitcham and Millom School,\" unless the Founder bad been born in the Parish of Whitcham. However that may be, it appears from a Decree, in the year 15 -to, that \u00a316. a year were then ordered to be paid annually out of the Revenues of the Crown in the County of Cumberland, remaining with the Auditor of the County. And it is a certain fact, that that sum has been regularly paid by the Auditor of the Revenues of the County of Cum berland, from the year 1540 until the present time. There has been no subsequent Endowment ; and, until within the last Thirty years, the Master never received any Quarter-Pence, or any other emolument for instructing the Children born within either of these Parishes, excepting a gratuitous offer, entirely at the option of the Parents of the Children, called a \" Cock-Penny\" at Shrovetide. The necessaries of life having, however, considerably increased in value, and the \u00a316. a year remaining as it did during the reign of Queen Elizabeth, have brought about"], [261, "Whitcham and Millom] CUMBERLAND- 199 an amicable arrangement between the Schoolmaster and the Inhabitants of the two Parishes ; \u2014 in consequence of which the Parents of both Parishes pay for each of their Children As. a Quarter for reading English alone, and 16.?. a Quar ter for writing, 3arithmetic, and Classics, \u2014 in order to aug ment the Stipend of \u00a3 1 6. to about \u00a350. per annum. The right of electing, or of removing the Master, is vested in Twelve Trustees, Six out of each Parish, of whom the Rector of the Parish Church of Whitcham, and the Vicar of the Parish Church of Millom, are always Two. The Westminster Latin and Greek Grammars are used ; and the Westminster system of Education is pur sued. There are no Exhibitions, nor any University advantages, belonging to this School. When the Boys leave this School, they generally go to St. Bees, Hawkshead, Carlisle, or Appleby, and from thence, to Queen's College, Oxford, or St. John's College, Cambridge. The present Master is, Mr. Joseph Lowther, who does not take Pupds. Many eminent men have received the first rudiments of their Education at this School, \u2014 especially, The Revd. John Postlethwaite, Head Master of St. Paul's School ; who died in 171^, and left a Legacy of upwards of \u00a3'2000., for the purchase of a Vicarage House and Glebe for the use of the Vicar of Millom, uffere he was born. The only eminent Man, of late years, who maybe said to have completed his Education at this School, is the late John Postlethwaite, Esq., who died atKendal on the 15th of March, 1815.

And that the School may not be burdened with a number of Foreigners, he shall not teach any but who are free, for a less sum than 5s. per Quarter. Secondly, The Under-Master shall be obliged to keep due hours in his attendance on the School, and he shall teach all the Children of such as are free, to read, write, and cypher ; and those that intend to advance to the Head Master, he shall teach them the Accidence, and all these, gratis ; nor shall he take any Foreigners under his care for less Premium than 2s. 6d. per Quarter, or any whatever until they can read the Testament.

[Wreay, WREAY, near Carlisle. The Free School of Wreay, in the Parish of St. Mary, Carlisle, has been long established. The Chapel of Wreay having been totally neglected at the Reformation, Twelve Proprietors in the neighbourhood, styling themselves Trustees for the Chapelry, took upon themselves the direction of all affairs within the Hamlet, and converted the Chapel into a School-FIouse. In a Petition, without date, addressed to Edward Rain bow, Bishop of Carlisle, between the years 1661 and 1684, the Trustees apologize for cutting down some old Trees which grew in the Chapel-yard, in order to augment their Chapel Stock, \" which had been much diminished,\" \u2014 and they also complain of a person teaching School in a neigh bouring Village to the \" impoverishment of their School, and discouragement of their School-Master.\" The original School Stock which was \u00a340., remains the same. A School-house was built in 1751. The Trustees appoint the Master. John Brown, Esq., of Met 'guards, bequeathed \u00a3200. to the School ; with the major part of which John Losh, Esq., of Woodside, his heir, in 1764, purchased land adjoining to the School-house, and the remainder is in the hands of his Grand-daughters, Misses Sarah and Catherine Losh, who generously intend to legalize Mr. Brown's Will, which was invalidated by the Mortmain Act.

The present Master is, Mr. Patrick Francis Doran, whose Salary and Emoluments are about \u00a335. per annum. A singular donation was made by a Mr. Graham, of a Silver Bell, weigliing two ounces, upon which is engraven \" Wrcy Chappie, 1655,\" to be \"fought for annually on Shrove Tuesday by Cocks.\" About three weeks previous to that day, the boys fixed upon Two of their School-fellows for Captains, whose parents were able and willing to bear the expense of the approaching contest, and the Master on his entering the School was saluted by the boys throwing up their hats, and the acclamation of \" Dux, Dux.\" After an early dinner on Shrove Tuesday the two Captains, attended by their Friends and School-fellows who were distinguished by blue and red Ribbons, marched in procession from their respective homes to the Village Green, when each produced Three Cocks, and the Bell was appended to the hat of the Victor, \u2014 in which manner it was handed down from one successful Captain to another. About thirty years since, this barbarous custom was su perseded by a \" Hunt,\" \u2014 a Mayor being annually elected, and the Bell graces his rod of office.

The Grammar School at Chesterfield was founded in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, by Godfrey Foljambe, Esq., of Watton, in this Parish; and endowed with\u00a3l 3..6..S. per annum, payable out of an estate at Attenborough, in the County of Nottingham. In consequence of this endowment, every Master, nominated and appointed by The Mayor and Corporation, must, according to the will of Mr. Foljambe, be examined and approved by The Archbishop of York, in whose Diocese Attenborough is situate. There have been subsequent Donations; \u2014 viz., \u00a38. an nually from Ballidon, in the County of Derby; \u2014 \u00a3l. from the Vicar of Chesterfield, outof land near the Town : \u2014 \u00a3 1 ..7..1 . from the Proprietors of the Chesterfield Canal; \u2014 \u00a3l..7..0. the Interest of \u00a330., left by Mr. Leonard Gill, of Lon don, Merchant ; \u2014 and a Farm, called The Hague Farm, situate in the Parish of Stavely near Chesterfield, which was left about the year 1674, by Mr. Cornelius Clarke, of the then yearly value of \u00a338. ; which Rent was to be divided in the following proportions, viz., \u00a3 1 5. annually to the Master, \u00a315. annually to an Usher to assist the Master, and \u00a38. annually to an A B C Darius, 'she respective sums of \u00a315. to the Master and Usher are annually paid by The Corporation of Chesterfield, as Trustees : But it is stated, that the ABC Darius now receives from this endowment \u00a312..12..0. per annum. The appointment of the Usher w.as vested by Mr. Clarke in his Descendants ; and in conse quence, Mr. Shore, of Norton, in the County of 1 )erby, nominates, and The Corporation approve in this case. The Hague Farm being adjacent to the Estate of Sir Sitwell Sitwell, Bart., of Renishaw, an advatageous exchange of it was made by The Corporation with Sir"], [278, "216 DERBY. [Chesterfield Sitwell for lands situate elsewhere, about Twenty years since. There are no particular Statutes, nor Ordinances. The School is open to boys of all descriptions in the Town, free of expense. But from this promiscuous Admission, there are few boys upon the Foundation ; and but rarely any other Scholars. The Westminster Latin Grammar, and the Eton Greek, are used ; And the usual routine of Education is, The Accidence and Latin Grammar, Clarke's Introduction, Latin Testament, Eutropius, Ph\u00e6drus's Fables, C\u00e6sar's Commentaries, Greek Testament, Ovid's Metamorphoses, Sallust, VirgU ; and, in Greek, Xenophon and Homer. It appears by the Will of Mr. Foljambe, that he foun ded a Fellowship for the Town of Chesterfield at St. John's College, Cambridge. There is neither Exhibition, nor Scholarship. The present Head Master is, The Revd. Thomas Field, M. A., whose Salary is about \u00a340. per annum, with a House and about six or seven acres of Land.

DERBY. 218 DERBY. The Free School at Derby, which is situate in St. Peter's Church-yard, is one of the most ancient Endowments of the kind in this kingdom. According to Mr. Lysons, it is certain that it existed as early as the Twelfth Century,\u2014 -and it seems to have been founded in the reign of King Henry the Second, soon after the removal of the Canons of St. Helen's to the Abbey of Darley. Walter Durdant, Bishop of Lichfield, in his Charter, speaks of the School at Derby as the gist of himself and William de Barbei Aprilis. Soon after this, whilst Richard Peche, who succeeded Walter Durdant in 1162, was Bishop of Lichfield, Walkelin de Derby and Goda his Wife gave the Man sion in which they dwelt, and which Walkelin had pur chased of William Alsin, to the Canons of Darley, on condition that the Hall should be for ever used as a School room, and the Chambers for the Dwelling of the Master and Clerks. This ancient Grammar School was given to The Corpo ration by Queen Mary, together with a part of the pos sessions of the Abbey of Darley for it's Foundation, specially charging the Estate of Little Chester with the annual payment of \u00a313. .6.. 8. to the Master, and Usher. The Endowment which is in Land and Houses, is con siderably improved; \u2014 but the amount is a profound Secret with The Corporation, who positively refuse any information respecting the School.

At present there are only three or four Free Scholars, \u2014 and as many Extra-Parochial Scholars, who pay a guinea entrance ; and four guineas per annum. There have been Fifty Scholars in this School at one time, but not of late years. The Eton Grammars are used ; and the system of Education is at the option of the Master. There are Ten Exhibitions at Emanuel College, Cambridge, of \u00a310. per annum each, founded by Mr. Ash ; to which boys, who are educated at The Grammar Schools of Ashby and Derby, have a preference. Mrs. Jane Walton, the Widow of The Revd. John Walton, Archdeacon of Derby, (who died in 1603), among several other benefactions, gave \u00a3 1 00. to The Master and Fellows of St. John's College, Cambridge, for the main ten3ance of such Scholars as come from Derby School, or, for want of such, from Derbyshire, and are admitted of that College. She also bequeathed to The Badiffs and Common Council of Derby \u00a340., for the better relief of the Head Master and Usher, \" so as the Stock may continue for that use for ever.'1 The present Master is, The Revd. James Bligh, whose Salary is \u00a350. per annum from The Corporation, and \u00a320. per annum from Emanuel College. A Sermon is preached once a year at All Saints Church, for which \u00a320. per annum was left by Mr. Crawshaw, which sum has always been given to the Master, but it does not constitute part of the Endowment.

Item, I ordain that the Schoolmaster every Saturday after noon, do call the Scholars before him, and that till three of the clock he catechise them in the principles of our Christian Reli gion, according to the order of the book of Common Prayer, that they may by this means be seasoned and prepared to receive public instruction by way of catechising from the Vicar in the Church. 3. Item, I strictly inhibit the Schoolmaster and Usher upon penalty of loss of their places, that they grant no otium or play days to their Scholars, upon any pretext ; but I appoint that the Scholars do every Thursday and Saturday by three of the clock in the afternoon, play of course. And that there be no breaking up, nor leaving of School before any festival days, save only two days before the feast of Easter, two days before the fe:ast of Pen tecost, and four or five days before Christmas, and the School to begin again upon the Wednesday in Easter Week, the Wed nesday in the feast of Pentecost, and the first Monday after the twelfth day in Christmas without delay.

Thos. Fanshawe. Know all Men by these presents, that We, Althea Fan- shawe, the Patroness of the School of Dronfield, in the County of Derby, together with The Rev. Lawrence Bourne, Clerk and Vicar of the said Parish of Dronfield, Robert Ward, Joseph Pearson, Thomas Worsten- holme, and Charles Greenwood, Churchwardens of the said Parish, Trustees for and Governors of the said School, do, by virtue of the powers in us vested by the Founder of the said School, and by and with the advice and consent of the much greater and most respectable part of the Pa- rishioners, make these following alterations of, and addi- tions to the Rules already made, for the better ordering of the said School. 1 . In regard to the Eighth Rule already made, respecting the Usher's salary, We (in conformity with what our predecessors have done before us) do order, that upon every increase of the rents, issues or profits of the said School, the Usher's salary shall be augmented along with the Headmaster's, in proportion to vol. i. Q"], [288, "[Dronfield- 226 DERBY. their several present stipends, or diminished in the same propor tion, upon any extraordinary expence being incurred, except only with respect to their several houses, for repairing which, each Master shall p.iy for his own. 2. We order, that whatever Boys, the Usher for the time be ing shall bring into the School, he shall himself be paid as well for their entrance as instruction, till such time as they shall, by the direction of the Vicar and Churchwardens, or the greater part of them be consigned over to the care of the Head-master, in which case one half of the entrance money received by the Usher shall by him be paid to the Head-master. And that the Usher and his Boys shall have free access to the School at all School hours, without the let, hindrance or molestation of the Head-master ; neither shall they be subject to his authority, ex cept only with respect to their moral conduct. 3. We further order, that no Boy whose parents live and are legally settled in the Parish of Dronfield, shall pay any entrance money ; and that no other boy shall pay more than haif a guinea entrance, nor more than two guineas a year for instruction, writing and accompts excepted. 4 . We further order, that no Master or Usher of the said School, shall take upon him to prevent any Boy from coming to the said School, or refuse to instruct him there in the same manner he does the other Boys under his care, unless such rea sons be assigned as shall be thought sufficient by the Vicar and Churchwardens for the time being, or the major part of them. 5. We further order, that if the Usher for the time being, shall undertake to instruct Boys in writing and accompts, he shall be allowed to bring tables and forms into the School for that purpose ; but shall not demand more for such instruction, than what is usually paid at other Schools in the neighbour hood ; or if he does not choose to engage in that employment, then the Vicar and Churchwardens for the time being, or the major part of them, shall appoint a person to do it, who shall be indulged in the like privileges. 6. We further order, that no Boy who belongs to the Parish of Dronfield, shall pay more than sixpence a year towards coals, nor more than threepence a year towards keeping the School clean, and lighting the fires in it ; and that every other Boy shall pay twice as much, and no more, to those several charges : And in case more coals be wanted, or more pay be wanted to satisfy the School-sweeper, the Churchwardens shall provide the former, and pay the latter, and deduct the same from the School rents. 7. We further order, that if any disputes arise between the Head-master and Usher, or between either of them and any"], [289, "Dronfield.] DERBY 227 other person, respecting the School or Scholars, they shall be referred to the Vicar and Churchwardens for the time being, to be adjusted by them, or the major part of them, and their adjust ment shall be final. 8. We order, that these our Rules together with those for merly made and not yet repealed, shall be strictly obsarved both by the Head-master and Usher, upon pain of our displeasure, and such punishment, as We, by the Charter, are authorised to inflict.

These eight Rules were signed by Mrs. Fanshawe the 17th day of March, 1786, in the presence of Edward Townshend. Thomas Milnes. These eight Rules were signed by the Vicar and Churchwar dens of Dronfield, in the County of Derby, this 3d day of April, 1786, in the presence of S. ROTHERHAM. J. ROTHERHAM. Be it remembered, that a Counterpart of these last eight Rules, signed by the Vicar and Churchwardens, in the presence of Samuel Rotherham, Esq., and John Rotherham, Esq., wa3 delivered to Mr. Russel, this 4th day of April, 1786, by us whose\u00bbNames are hereunto subscribed.

At so distant a period as the Saxon Heptarchy, Repton, or Reopandun as it was then called, is mentioned in the scanty Chronicles of the times, as we learn from the extacts preserved by Leland, and given in his Collectanea. It was not only the Palace of the Saxon Monarchs of Mercia, but the seat of a noble Monastery of Religious men and women, before the year 660; of which Palace, or Monastery, considerable foundations are discoverable, both in the Priory and adjoining Church-yard, when any alterations have been made in the School buddings, or vaults been dug in the Church-yard. The Palace and Monastery being laid waste and destroyed by the Danes, the Priory was re-edified in the year 1172, by Matilda, widow of Ranulph de Bldndeville, second Earl of Chester, and continued in a flourishing condition, until the Dissolution by Henry the Eighth, in 1538, when"], [293, "Repton.] DERBY. 231 it was found to be possessed of Revenues to the amount of \u00a3167..1S..0. The Site of the Priory, and it's Possessions in Repton, were granted, in 1540, to Thomas Thacker, Esq., Servant to Henrv the Eighth, in whose Fanuly they continued until the year 17 28, when, by the bequest of Miss Thacker, heiress to Gilrert Thacker, Esq., the Priory estate in Repton was conveyed to the Family of Bcrdett, of Fore mark, in which it still continues. Sir John Port, of Etwall, Knight of the Bath, (so created at the Coronation of King Edward the Sixth), who was possessed, by marriage and inheritance, of great pro perty in the Counties of Stafford, Derby, and Lancaster, having lost his two sons at an early age, and being minded to bestow some part of his estates in Charitable Foundations for the repose of his Soul, in the year 1556 devised to his Executors, Sir Thomas Giffard, Richard Harpcr, Esq., and others, certain estates in the Counties of Derby and Lancaster, for the Fountlation of an Hospital at Etwall, and a Free Grammar School at Repton. These Institutions were accordingly established after his death, in the year 1557, and continued by the Licence of Queen Mary, under the direction of the Harpcr Family, until the year 1621 ; when, by an Agreement between Sir John Harpcr on the one part, and The Earl of Hunting don, Lord Stanhope, and Sir Thomas Gerard, Bart., on the other, the three several Descendants of Sir John Port's three Daughters, the Superintendence, after the death of Sir John Habpur, was conveyed to the right heirs of the Founder. By the Petition of the Co-heirs, The Hospital and School, in the year 1621, were made a Body Corporate, by the style and title of \" The Master of Etwall Hospital, The Schoolmaster of Repton, Ushers, Poor Men, and Poor Scholars.\" And, in consequence of that settlement,"], [294, "[Repton. 232 DERBY. the estates were conveved by Sir John Harpur to The Corporation, and in that Body are now vested. The Endowment, when the Charter was granted, was \u00a3350.; but which, from the improved state of it's Revenues, is at present about \u00a32500. per annum. In the reign of Charles the First a small addition was made by Mr. Thomas Whitehead, first Usher, for the benefit of The Head Master, of a Field of four acres at Repton, now worth \u00a312. per annum. There is also a small estate at Ticknall, which was left by Mr. Philip Ward, a former Master, in 1656, for the pur chase of Books for Poor Scholars. The Foundation at present maintains a Master of The Hospital (in whom the power of receiving the Rents, and paying the Stipends, is vested),\u2014 a Master of The School,\u2014 Two Ushers, \u2014 1 6 Poor Men in The Hospital, \u2014 and 1 S Poor Scholars at Repton. The entire superintendance of The School and Hospital is hereditary in the Noble Families of Hastings and Ches terfield, and of Sir William Gerard, the Representa tives and Co-heirs of Sir John Port's three daughters, who have the power of regulating The Corporation, and electing The Master of The Hospital, The Schoolmaster, and Ushers; But a Grant of a Fourth Turn with them, in the appoint ment only of Poor Men, and Poor Scholars, was made by The Charter to the Famdy of Harpur, of Calke. The Village of Repton is pleasantly situate in a Valley, which is washed by a rapid Trout-stream, that rises in the Pi-stern Hills, about six miles distant to the Southward. At the Northern extremity of the Village, upon an elevation overlooking the adjacent Country and the river Trent, stands the Parish Church. Adjoining to the Church, are the remains of The Priory, which are now converted into a Grammar School, and Houses for the Masters. The entrance from the Village to"], [295, "Repton.] DERBY. 233 The Monastery, is through a Gateway with a Pointed Arch, into the School-yard, formerly called \" The Infirmary Yard:\" The Eastern side of which is occupied by a long range of budding, with habitations at the Northern end for The Head Master: and at the Southern, for the First Usher. In the middle, is the School-room, ascended by a flight of steps at the South end, which was once the Hall, or Refectory, of Tlie Priory. The Dormitory was at the North end of the Hall, in which is remaining a small Room, with a coved Cieling of stone, in the Norman style, and a carved Key-stone in the Centre. On the Extern side of the Priory, was placed the Cloister, the area of which is now converted into a Garden, with 3some f3aint traces of apertures and door-ways in the surrounding walls. At the West end of the Church, is a square massive Tower, apparently of very antient date, now forming the entrance into the School, with narrow round-arched windows: in which part much devastation has been made. The elegant Priory Church was demolished in the begin ning of the reign of Queen Mary, by Mr. Thackep. ! ! \u2014 In the adjoining Paddock, inclosed on three sides by a strong stone wall, extending over several acres, are the Foundations of other buddings belonging to The Priory. The Prior's Lodge has, of late years, been rented of Sir Francis Burdett, and appropriated to the residence of The Head Master of the School. That part of the Priory now remaining, and closely ad joining to The Mansion-House, was sold by Mr. Thacker, in the reign of Philip and Marv, to the Executors of Sir John Port ; And, with some of the old possessions of the Priory, piously appropriated to the advancement of Learn ing: Which, as was the case in several other Religious Houses, had, doubtless, some encouragement among the"], [296, "DERBY. [Repton. 234 Canons at Repton : and which, by the benevolent care of the Re-founder, has again taken deep root, and now flourishes in appropriate splendour. The Statutes of the School, which are very long and much blended with those of The Hospital, direct, that The Head Master and First Usher must be Graduates. The Head Master is required to be continually resident, and on no account to be absent above Forty days. And, during his absence, he must procure a Deputy, to officiate for him. The Second Usher is to teach Writing and Arithmetic. And neither of the Ushers are to be absent, without the permission of The Head Master. This is a Free Grammar School, without limitation as to place or number of common Scholars. The present number of Boys upon the Foundation is Eighteen. Foundation Boys are required to be not less than Seven nor more than Twelve years of age,\" at the time of their Admission. These boys are entitled to hold their Scholarships for Seven years. The Scholarships appointed by the Charter, are Four in number, and of the annual value of \u00a320. each, and the Scholars may be chosen from any place. They are not con fined, when they leave School, to any particular College, or either University. The nomination to The Founder's Scholarships belongs to The Governors. There are no Exhibitions founded at present ; nor can any allowance be made to the Poor Scholars at The Univer sity without the consent and approbation of the King. The Incorporated Hospital and School of Etwall and Repton in the Charter and Institution given them, in many respects resemble The Charter-House in London; except that with respect to The Charter-House, The Gover nors are elective and form the Body Corporate ; at Etwall and Repton the Government is hereditary, and the Masters,"], [297, "Repton.] DERBY. 235 Ushers, and Three Senior Poor Men form the Corporate Body. The Eton Latin and Greek Grammars are in use : And the system of Education pursued, is nearly the same as at Eton College. The present Head Master is, William Boultby Sleath, D. D., whose Salary and Emoluments are \u00a3200. per annum together with a spacious House. This Gentleman takes Pupils, his very moderate Terms for each boy being only, For Board - 30 iguineas.

The Grammar School of Bideford has apparently been established several Centuries, \u2014 for, although there are no written Records relating to it of earlier date than 1689, yet by an Inscription upon a stone in the centre of the front of the School-room, it appears to have been rebuilt in 1657, \u2014 and it is very evident from the variety of the materials of which the walls are composed, that the building has un dergone considerable repairs and alterations at different periods. By another Inscription which is much injured by time, it appears that \" this School was rebuilt to ye Glory of God and incorragement of Good Learning by ye Order of the Right Worshipful John Darracott, Mayor, with ye con sent of his Brethren ye Aldermen and Capital Burgesses of this Town ano Dom. 1686.\" In 1780, the School-house was completely repaired, and much improved with the addition of a new brick front, at the expense of the Feoffees of The Long Bridge of Bide ford out of their Trust Funds, which is also noticed by a Latin Inscription in front of the budding. A few years after the School was rebuilt in 1686, it met with a very liberal Benefactress in Mrs. Susannah Stuc ley, the Widow and Relict of Mr. Lewis Stucley, the noted Independent Minister, one of Cromwell's Chaplains, and the Representative of an ancient and distinguished Family in the County ; who, on the subversion of Episco pacy and the Monarchy, exercised his Ministry \" in the Congregational Way,\"'m the Nave of Exeter Cathedral, then called West Peter's, \u2014 whilst Thomas Ford, a Puritan, made a like use of the Choir, then denominated East Peter's, \" in great Quiet and Comfort,\" \u2014 for about ten or twelve years,"], [307, "BlDEFORD.] DEVON. 245 'till they were both turned out in 1662, under what is called \" The Bartholomew Act I\" after which period, Stucley, untd his death in July 1687, at the age of 64, lived and preached at Bideford. \u2014 Cal amy's Nonconformist's Memorial, by Pal mer, edit. 1775. pp. 360, 364.

Mrs. Stucley, by her Will dated the 3d of March, 1689, gave and bequeathed the sum of \u00a3200. to be laid out in lands, for the maintenance of a Grammar School in the town of Bideford, provided the said Town would raise \u00a3400. more to be laid out in lands for the same use : \u2014 (Which said \u00a3400., together with \u00a320. beyond that sum, was raised ac cordingly, \u2014 part thereof \u00a3100. being given by the Will of John Thomas), \u2014 and in compliance with the directions of the said Will, a purcli3ase was made. And, by a Deed dated the 20th of March, 1695, John Furze, of Great Torrington, Yeoman, and Ann Furze, his Sister, in consideration of \u00a3620. and one Broad Piece of Gold paid to John Furze, did sell and assiign unto George Strange, the then Mayor of Bideford, Thomas Saltern, Esq., Recorder, John Darracott, and Fourteen others, all those messuages, lands, and tenements, called \" Bush town\" within the Parish of West Buckland, in the County of Devon, containing by estimation 80 acres of land or thereabouts, \u2014 to hold the same unto the said Trustees, their heirs, executors, and administrators for the term of 900 years thence next ensuing, \u2014 and all other the estate, right, title, terms and interest of them the said John Furze and Ann Furze therein, in Trust nevertheless for the mainte nance and support of a Grammar School in Bideford. A few years ago, the Trustees of the School felled some Trees growing on Bushtown Estate, and with the money arising from the sale thereof, have lately purchased for the use of the Master of the School, a commodious Dwelling-"], [308, "DEVON. [Bideford. 246 house situate in New Buildings Bideford, large enough to accommodate Thirty Boarders. They also purchased a large Seat in the Church. The House is holden for the Term of 99 years determina. ble by the deaths of Three lives, granted by The Feoffees of the lands for the maintenance and reparation of The Long Bridge of Bideford, and renewable for ever on pay ment of a moderate Fine. This House is worth \u00a335. per annum, clear of all taxes. The Estate was let, in 1814, for \u00a357. per annum, hut the rent has since been lowered to \u00a350., in consequence of the depreciation of lands. The first Master appointed by The Trustees, after the augmentation of the emoluments of the School by Mrs- Stucley and others, was Richard Roberts, who was duly elected in 1695; and who, although styled in the articles hereinafter mentioned a Schoolmaster, was most probably also in Holy Orders, for in the Deed he covenants not to preach the Gospel, marry, bury, baptize, or administer the Sacra ment. And a covenant nearly to the same purport is in serted in the Articles of agreement made with the present Master, to prevent him from undertaking the duties of a Parish Priest to the neglect of the School. By Indenture dated the 30th of March, 1695, Mr. Ro berts covenanted and promised to the Trustees, that he would to the utmost of his power teach and keep in the School-house of Bideford, one School, for the bringing up and educating of youth in the Latin, Greek, and Hebrew tongues, so far as the Youths should be capable, and their Parents willing, on the first day of April then next ensuing. And also, that he should teach and instruct each and every year, after the expiration of the first year, Six poor Children of Bideford to be elected by all the parties to this Indenture, or the major part of them, viz., The Trustees of the School. And the Trustees, in consideration thereof, covenanted to"], [309, "Bideford.] DEVON. 247 pay to Mr. Roberts the sum of \u00a320. per annum, out of the suras collected for the benefit of the School, or out of the Interest thereof, until such time as the same could be laid out in an Estate of Fee Simple for a perpetual advance of an able Schoolmaster, when the Annuity should cease, and he should have the produce of the lands so purchased. And Mr. Roberts covenanted, that in case he should be desirous to remove from the School of Bideford, he would give such sufficient notice thereof as that the School might be fitted with some other able Schoolmaster at his departure. And also, that he would, during the time he should remain Master in the School, well and sufficiently repair the said School-house, and would so yield up the same quietly and peaceably unto the custody of the Trustees. The next Master was Zachaey Mudge, M. A., the father of the celebrated Mechanist and Watchmaker, Thomas Mudge, \u2014 a very learned, ingenious, and respectable Divine. He removed from Bideford to Plymouth about the year 1735, and became Vicar of St. Andrew in that Town, and Prebendary of Exeter Cathedral. His abilities sufficiently appear from a learned \" Essay for a new Version of the Psalms,\" in Quarto, \u2014 and a volume of excellent Sermons in Octavo. Dr. Johnson had a very high opinion of Preben dary Mudge, whom he describes \" a man equally eminent for his virtues and abilities, and at once beloved as a com panion and reverenced as a Pastor.\" On his leaving Bideford, Mr. Richard White was elected by The Trustees, and continued Schoolmaster until the 22d of Deer., 1750; when, in consideration of \u00a3 10. then paid to him, and also of an Annuity of \u00a310. per annum during his life, to be paid to him by the order of the Cor poration and Feoffees of The Long Bridge of Bideford out of the Bridge Stock, he resigned the School to the then sur viving Trustees, and all his right touching the same ; as also to the estate of Bushtown from Christmas then next."], [310, "DEVON.

Mr. Marshall very soon after died, and The Revd.

The Free Grammar School of Chudleigh was founded by John Pynsent, Esq., of Combe, in the Parish of Croy don, in the County of Surrey.

The Parishioners, therefore, came to an agreement to con vey to him a piece of ground, belonging to them, containing an acre, situate at Chudleigh near the Church-yard, and known by the name of \" Tlie Sporting Park.\" Whereupon Mr. Pynsent agreed to expend \u00a3200. in building a School-house, and inclosing the ground, and to pay a Salary of \u00a330. per annum out of his Estate of Combe. And certain Trustees were accordingly appointed, one of whom was Sir Thomas Clifford, at that time Comptroller and Treasurer of His Majesty's Household, and afterwards Lord High Treasurer. A part of the house was appropriated for a School-room, and the residue thereof was for the use of the Master, together with the ground.

But his will was, that this Exhibition should cease to such of those boys who did not diligently attend the School, and frequent the Church on the Lord's day, unless a sufficient reason could be given. And to Three of those boys who should apply themselves to learning, so that they should be thought fit for the University, he gave towards their main tenance at the University of Cambridge \u00a35. per annum each, for the term of four years, after they should be admitted at Cambridge, and if they should so long continue Students there. Mr. Pynsent died on the 29th of August, 1668, and left sufficient assets to his Executors to pay all his Legacies. His Executors, however, delayed to pay the sums appointed by him for Charitable uses, and at the time of his decease the School-house was not finished.

And the Commissioners likewise ordered, that the other charitable intentions of the Founder should be carried into effect. Few particulars can now be gathered of the life of Mr. Pynsent.

The Schools consist of an extensive range of Buildings, the principal part of which is of a quadrangular form. The North front, facing The High Street and extending to up-"], [331, "Exeter.] DEVON. 269 winds of 220 feet in length, comprises, The Grammar Schoolmaster's House, a capacious and handsome modern edifice, built about Forty ye;ars since, \u2014 St. John Baptist's Chapel, in which Divine Service is regularly celebrated by the Master, except in the afternoon of one Sunday in every month, when the Mayor, with the Corporation attends, and his Chaplains are accustomed, in turn, to officiate, \u2014 The Porch, or Gate of Entrance into the area of the Quadran gle, \u2014 and, The Grammar School-room, which is on the first floor. The Front of the Chapel and School-room, with the Porch between them, is an uniform piece of Architec ture of that style usually denominated Gothick. The Chapel was rebuilt by the munificence of Alice Hele, Widow of Eliz\u00e6us Hele, of Fardel, Esq., at the expense of \u00a3300., and re-opened by the celebrated Bishop Joseph Hall, on the 21st of September, 1639.

On the South part, and on the first floor, is The Coix cil Chamber of the Governors. And, on the East part, and on the first floor, is The English School-room. The Apartments on the Ground floors of all sides of the Quadrangle are, during the Public Fairs, let out to the Dealers in cloth, blankets, dowlas, and the like commodities, from whence considerable emolument arises to the Go- vernors.

The High School appears to have been sounded in the Year 1343, by Richard de Braylegh, Dean of Exeter, who built the house upon the lands of the Chapter, in a narrow Street, now called \" Musgrave's Alley? It is not certainly known, and, perhaps, cannot now be ascertained, whether there were ever any settled Endowment of it. In ancient times, the Archdeacon of Exon used to appoint the Master ; but, soon after the Restoration of Charles the Second, the right of appointment belonged to, or was exercised bv, The Chapter. In 1388, John Spencer was admitted Master. In 1548, the sum of 20*. per annum was granted by The Chapter for the augmentation of the Under-Master's Sti pend.

Hugh Crossing, Esq., twice Mayor of this City, (i. e.,in 1609 and 1620), taking into his serious consideration, the great charge and increase of poor people and poor children, \u2014 the great use of Hospitals for the relief of either, \u2014 and the great desire of many of the Citizens for the accomplishing of the same, who had by their several Wills given divers sums of money to that purpose, which were totally lost, by reason that such Hospitals were not erected within the times prefixed, \u2014 accordingly, in his life-time, intended to found and erect an Hospital within this City, or liberally to endow the same if it should be erected by any other, as he expressed by a writing under his own hand ; but dying intestate before he could accomplish the same, possessed of a plentiful estate, Joan Crossing, his Widow and Relict, and Francis Crossing, his only Son and Heir, as well of their own free dispositions, as for the furtherance of the said charitable intentions of the said Hugh Crossing, for the Fine off 740. purchased the Fee and Inheritance of all that House or Scyte of the late Dissolved Hospital of Saint John lying within The East Gate, with divers other tenements, edifices, orchards, gardens, and courtlays, to the said Hospital belong ing, \u2014 And by their Deed indented, dated the 14th of Janu ary in the 21st of James the First, 1623, did grant the said premises unto Thirteen Persons, then of the Com mon CouncU of the said City, to hold to them, their Heirs"], [353, "Exeter.] DEVON. 291 and Assigns for ever, Upon Trust nevertheless that the said Trustees should from time to time and at all times for ever thereafter employ, convert, and continue the said House and Premises to and for an Hospital or Workhouse for the Poor of the said City and County, in such sort as by the Mayor and Common-Council of the said City for the time being, or the major part of them, should be from time to time directed, limited, and appointed ; the said poor people or chddren to be always chosen, received, taken, set to work, governed, directed, disposed of, continued, and re moved into, out of, and from the said Hospital by the Mayor and Common Council of the s\u00e6d City. This Gift was well accepted of by all, and yet in divers years thereafter little use made thereof, by reason of several ways propounded and attempted, which happened to great loss, not one of them producing the desired effects, to the no little discontent of the pious Donors, \u2014 Until at length by the additional Bounties of some other worthy and charitable Citizens, Let ters Patent were procured from his late Majesty King Charles the First of ever famous memory, for the found ing of an Hospital for the relief and pious education of Poor Children, which hath been since much promoted by sundry Benefactors, to the great comfort and honour of the said City and Citizens. The Chamber of Exeter, in new building and repair ing the Hospital, procuring his Majesty's Letters Patent for it's better establishment, and in other expenses, are stated to have disbursed about \u00a3500.

Lady Mary Prideaux, Widow of Sir Nicholas Pri deaux, Knt., thentofore Widow of Morris, LL.D., and Chancellor of Exeter Cathedral, in September 1630, being informed of the erecting of an Hospital in Exeter for the Education and Relief of young Children, in testimony of her love 3and good affection to the welfare of the City and such works of Charity, sent to The Chamber \u00a3100. to be by them ordered and disposed of, in placing poor young children in the said Hospital.

And, that there never may be wanting Trustees and Guardians of the election by any failure, I appoint and ordain that, whenever any Trustee and Guardian of the Election dies, the surviving Guardian and Trustee shall nominate another Trustee and Guardian of election for the same respective place, and so on for ever ; always intending that such persons shall be chosen, as live within the City or County for which they are chosen. \" At the election of every Exhibitioner, I desire The Mayor and Chamber to take to them Two learned Clergymen, or more, to examine the Candidates ; the Clergymen to be of the City or County of Devon, as the Mayor and Chamber shall think fit ; and enjoin that they shall examine publicly in The Free School, that any persons may hear the examinations, and judge of the merit of the Boys. After the election is made, I insist on it, that the Exhibitioner so elected, shall, within Two months after"], [374, "DEVON.

A., or quit his Exhibition at the end of the Fifth year, which Exhibition shall be then actually vacant for the want of a Degree, and another Exhibitioner shall be chosen into his place. \" If any of my Exhibitioners shall be chosen Scholars or Fellows of any College or Hall, it shall not deprive them of their Exhibition, 'till the Seven years are expired. If, after the first four years are expired and a Bachelor's Degree taken, (which two conditions I require absolutely from all my Exhibi tioners), he or they shall think fit to continue in a College or a Hall, he or they are at liberty to do it, sending to The Mayor and Chamber of Exeter, every year, a due Certificate of nine months' residence in the University ; but if any one of my Exhi bitioners, after he has taken a Bachelor's Degree, enter into Holy Orders, and accept of a Curacy, and reside upon the Living (which I think is absolutely necessary for him to do), then he shall enjoy my Exhibition one year longer, and no more : but my Will and intent is, that the Exhibition of that last year (which last year must always end within the expiration of the seven years, which shall never be exceeded) shall be delivered in Divinity Books only, and not in money, \u2014 which I absolutely forbid to be paid to any Exhibitioner, which is become Curate of a Parish ; and they shall be bought by the order of the Mayor and Chamber of Exeter, upon their request to some learned Clergyman of the City or County of Devon, to direct them what those Rooks shall be, reserving always 90s. out of the last pay ment to every Exhibitioner, before he quits the Exhibition ; which 20s., upon the expiration of every Exhibition, shall be kept back by the Receiver, and employed by the Mayor and Chamber, for buying Books towards forming a Library for the use of the Master and Scholars of The Free School in Exeter; and the name of the Exhibitioners, from whom the 20s. are deducted, shall be written on the first leaf of every Book which"], [375, "Exeter.] DEVON. 313 is bought with it. Tlus deduction of 20s. on the l3ast payment of every Exhibition, and the application of it for buying Books for the use of The School, shall continue as long sis the Exhibitions shall continue, and shall be for ever observed. \" If any of my Exhibitioners, after they have kept four years residence, and taken the Degree of B. A. in one of The Univer sities (which I positively insist upon) desire to apply the remain ing years in the study of the Law, in any of the Inns of Court in London, or in the study of Physic, in the Hospitals in London, or in the study of Civil Law, or Divinity, or Physic, in any Foreign Universities, or to travel for the improvement of Botany, Architecture, Painting, or Foreign Trade, I will and ordain that such Exhibitioner shall receive his or their Exhibitions annually, to the full end of the seven years, as if they were actually residing in one of our English Universities ; provided that they send a Certificate once a year to the Mavor and Cham ber, signed by the Chiefs where they reside, setting forth what they are studying. And I further ordain, that any Exhibitioner shall continue his Exhibition seven years from the day of his election, that goes abroad the l;ast three years in any Public office, under an Envoy or Ambassador ; for my desire is, that my Exhibitioners may be mingled in all professions, and make a figure in every Science, Language, and Nation. \" I will and ordain, that any person, duly qualified, may be chosen into my Exhibition, that is under the age of Twenty- Two ; and that any person, above that age, shall be incapable of being chosen ; and I appoint, that before ever)' election of an Exhibitioner, notice shall be given in the Public News of the election, iiddressed to the Gentlemen and Clergy of the County for which he is to be chosen ; and, aster the Exhibitioners arc Members of a College in The University, they shall not be deprived of their Exhibition for any other cause but Immorality, writing against the Doctrine of Christ or his Apostles, or turning Papist, at home or abroad ; therefore, as bare Exhibitioners, and not Fellows or Scholars of Colleges or Halls, I do not subject their Exhibitions to the penalties of College Statutes, for I would have them bred up in a free, generous, English spirit, and in the best Morality of the Philosophers, heightened and improved by the nobler precepts of Christianity. \" I do further ordain, that there shall be no Feast or Dinner, nor any other Entertainment, at the expense of the Benefaction or of the Exhibitioners, at any time whatsoever ; and I positively enjoin that no alteration shall be made by The Mayor and Chamber, of any Rules prescribed, by this my Will, for the education of my Exhibitioners after they are elected to the University ; but, that they shall remain in the same latitude and"], [376, "DEVON. [Exeter. 314 extent, which I have laid down in this Will, that Boys of genius may be left to their own genius, and not chained to a Law-Book or a Concordance; \u2014 therefore, I allow the Mayor and \u25a0 hamber of Exeter to choose one of the Exhibitioners for the City to travel abroad for the benefit of Trade, and I exempt that travelling Exhibitioner from going to The University : but subject him to such Rules as Mr. Alderman Heath shall be pleased to draw up for his direction, both at home and abroad. I require that he shall spend four years in Trading Towns in Foreign nations, and the other three in Trade at. home ; and that he shall receive the yearly Exhibition of the whole seven years. This is a permission to the Mayor and Chamber for the benefit of Trade ; but I re quire that the person so chosen shall have learnt Latin three years in Tin: Free School, and shall have a genius for Trade, and that there be no more than one Travelling Exhibitioner, and chosen no oftener than one election in three, notwithstanding any thing in this Will to the contrary. \" I do farther will and ordain that, whenever a Trustee of the election for a County or the City becomes vacant, the surviving Trustee for the same County or City shall choose another within six months, and notify it to the Mayor and Chamber of Exeter within that time, to be entered on their books. \" I do declare that, by The Free School in Exeter, I mean that School which stands within The Hospital of Saint John, founded by Hugh Crossing, Esq , and others, and no other School whatsoever; for 1 would make The Mayor and Chamber Electors of my Exhibitioners, as they are Electors of The School- Master, and do not doubt of their will to perform the said Trust, with integrity and impartiality, for the advantage of the School, and the honour of the City. \"Item,I give all my Books in the Oriental and Hebrew languages, not already given, to the use of the said Master and Scholars.\" His Widow was within Six months after his death, to have a copy of his Will on parchment, with the Probate annexed de livered to the Mayor and Chamber ; as also others, to Devon and Cornwall, to be delivered from one Trustee to the succeeding Trustee. \" I admit Boys of larger fortune to enjoy this Exhibition, that they may have some depth of soil of their own, and grow up and flourish in it, that I may not, by making it a mere Charity, increase the race Priestlings.\" Lastly, he reserves a power to alter this, or make a new Will, cancels all former Wills, and then makes his Wife his sole Exe cutrix, without being accountable to any person whatsoever; with full power to use and enjoy, during her natural life, all his effects of what kind soever, not given away at the time of his"], [377, "Exeter.] DEVON. 315 death. \" And since my effects,\" he observes, \" are a great deal more than what I have bequeathed in this Will, I make my said Wife, Philadelphia Stephens, my Residuary Legatee, and give and bequeath to her, for her own disposal, to whomsoever she pleases, whatsoever is not by this Will given and bequeathed.\" The Will is written with his own hand,\u2014 dated on the 14th of November, 1745, \u2014 attested by Peter Goi.dick, Junr., John Petty, Peter Knight, of Drokinsford, and Anthony Payne, -and was proved in the Prerogative Court of the Archbishop of Canterbury, on the 7th of May, 1747, by Philadelphia Stephens, Sister of the said Sir Thomas Dyke, the Testator's Widow and sole Executrix. Doctor Stephens was also Archdeacon of Barnstaple, and one of the Canons Residentiary of Exeter Cathedral. The Public will learn with surprise, that it was owing solely and exclusively to the Zeal and spirited Exertions of Tlie Revd. Robert Bartholomew, whilst Head Master of the School and when many years had elapsed since the death of Philadelphia Stephens, that Doctor Stephens's Will was discovered, brought to light, and made public,\u2014 and the donation, with a very considerable arrear of interest, re claimed, and consigned to the Trustees. His laudable en deavours and ultimate success entitle him to the Gratitude of his Fellow Citizens, and to a conspicuous Station amongst the most eminent Benefactors to this venerable Establish- ment. This extraordinary Incident may possibly induce a sus picion that Dr. Stephens's confidence has been misplaced, and that further Inquiry is still necessary, \u2014 for, after the most diligent search, it cannot be discovered who are his present Exhibitioners, or whether there be any, \u2014 but it seems satisfactorily ascertained, that no notices of Election, pursuant to the Directions of the Will, ever find their way into the Public Prints.

The School, under both the last named Masters, was in high and deserved repute, and sent out many distinguished Scholars. The strict Eton plan was acted upon. Valpy's Latin and Greek Gramnrars are now used. All the Boarders, and as many of the Day- Scholars as choose, employ the Afternoons of Three days in the week in learn ing writing and arithmetic, in the Library adjoining the School-room. And as many of both denominations as choose, are instructed in Drawing, during School hours. For all which Extra-charges are made. The present Master is, Joseph Lempriere, D.

The nomination is in the Trustees, or any of them. This School was in high repute in the time of The Revd. John Wilcocks, who died a few years since ; and Thirty Boarders at once have been known at the School, but now only two or three are there. The Eton Latin and Greek Grammars are used, \u2014 but the Introductory books in both languages are Dr. Valpy's, and the System of Education is at the discretion of the Master. Under the present Master, the whole range of Classical authors is resorted to, as occasion may require. The present Master is, Tlie Revd. Robert Lane, B.

The Master's house is probably of greater antiquity, and might have been purchased by Sir John, together with the ground on which it stands. The sum of \u00a31800. was originally appropriated to the Endowment, which consists of a Fee Simple estate, called \" Holland,\" of 147a. 3r. 13?., situate in the Parish of Plymp ton St. Mary, and the Master's House and School-house, situate in the Parish of Plympton Maurice. The Estate is said by one Informant to be now let for \u00a3168., and by another for \u00a3'250., a year. There are no Ordinances for the regulation of this School ; nor is it known, whether it be open to any other boys than those inhabiting the Borough and Parish.

There are no Exhibitions, nor Scholarships, annexed to this School.

[Tiverto.n. 344 late Benjamin Incledon, of PUton, Devon, Esq., who carefully commented upon each circumstance, in a work printed at his own expense, for the use of the Foundation. This book has since been re-printed by order of the Feoffees, with notes and additions to the year 1804. Mr. Blundell lived at a time when matters of Religion were scarcely settled after the Reformation ; but his ad herence to the Protestant Faith is strongly marked by his liberal foundation for \" Studients in Divinitie.\" And his \" dear friend\" The Lord Chief Justice put this part of the Trust into execution with great assiduity. Not a year had elapsed after The Founder's death before he nominated (14th March, 1601,) the Scholars, \u2014 and ordained, that Two should be founded in Balliol College, Oxford, \u2014 Two others in Emanuel College, \u2014 and Two others in Sydney Sussex College, Cambridge. It happened that Emancel College would not accept the nomination, which was therefore revoked, on the 20th of August, 1603, \u2014 and the Two Scholars intended for that College, were added to those in Sydney Sussex College. Agreements were very soon afterwards entered into between The Lord Chief Justice and the Colleges, viz., on the 17th of March, 1603, with Balliol College, \u2014 and, on the 20th of September, 1603, with Sydney Sussex College. But His Lordship dying (on the 11th of November, 1607), before the sum allotted could be laid out, the Estab lishments were not completely settled until some years after his death ; \u2014 but, in the mean time, the Executors maintained the Students in the Universities. It appears by the Deeds (which are generally known by the name of ,\" Composition Deeds \") that, when the Estab lishments were finally settled, \" the Executors had disbursed a Thousand Marks, and also \u00a333..6..8. by way of increase, amounting to \u00a3700. towards purchasing lands at Woodstock,"], [407, "TlVERTON.] DEVON. 345 in Oxfordshire, for the maintenance of a Fellow and Scholar at Balliol College\" (11th Novr., 1615).\u2014 And that \"the Executors had likewise disbursed Two Thousand Marks, and also One Hundred Marks by way of increase, amounting to \u00a31400. towards purchasing lands at Clee, in Lincolnshire, for the maintenance of Two Fellows and Two Scholars in Sydney Sussex College\" (13th June, 1616.) On the 10th of June 1676, another Fellowship and another Scholarship were established between The Feoffees and Balliol College, on nearly the same plan as those already mentioned. It is said in this second Deed of Composition, that \" the College had lately received a gratuity of \u00a350. from The Feoffees towards the disch3ar<re of certain burthen some Debts which then lay on the said College, and that the sum of \u00a3600. was in hand paid by The Feoffees to The College, for the maintenance of the said Fellow and Scholar, &c\" A beneficial circumstance to the Trust, \" which is not much known,\" attended the transaction of this second Establishment. For, not long before it was carried into execution, \" The Revd. Richard Newte presented the Feoffees with \u00a3100., and in return it was agreed, that John Newte, his son, should be, as he afterwards was, the first Fellow on that Foundation.\" Twenty-Seven Feoffees are named in the Wdl, but in future Twenty-five only were deemed necessary. Two of the original Feoffees were infant sons of his relations John West and John Blundell, whom he appointed Feoffees, not willing that they should run the risque of being excluded at an Election. In preserving the complement of the Trust, the Feoffees are obliged to fill up the vacancies, when they are reduced to Tliirteen ; but they are not required to wait until they arc reduced to that number. And, when they fill up, they must make up, including themselves, the number of Twenty-"], [408, "346 DEVON. [TlVERTON. five, at the least, but they are not prohibited from exceeding that number. To avoid a precipitate election of Feoffees, it was ordered, in 177 1, \" That no Feoffee be chosen without a year's notice at a Meeting, of an intention to fill up the Trust.\" The Trust is kept full, and consists as it 3always has done of the most respectable Inhabitants of the Neighbourhood or County.

It does not appear that Mr. Blundell was possessed of any other landed Estate in any other County, or in any other places of the County of Devon, than the Parish of Tiverton, and those Parishes into which the Manor of West Prawl extends. Besides these landed Estates, the Feoffees now have \u00a32670. Capital Trust Monies in the Old South Sea Annui ties. The present Income of the Trust Estate is about \u00a3400. per annum, and the Out-goings about \u00a3350. With what diligence and integrity Sir John Popham executed the great trust reposed in him, \u2014 jiided by the unanimous and laudable co-operation of The Feoffees, \u2014 may be gathered from the prompt manner in which the buildings were erected, for within Four years after the death of the pious Founder, the Schools, with the Dwelling-Housc and Offices, were all substantially completed near the river Loman. In 1695, the great Gate being much decayed, Iron Gates were erected in it's stead, over which are suitable Latin and English Inscriptions. The Porter's Lodge was built at the same time. The Porter has a Salary of 50*. a year, and a Gown when wanted. The number of bovs to be educated was originally limited to One Hundred and Fifty: But the Schools were erected upon a more extensive scale, and many additional conveniences to the buildings having liberally been made from time to time by The Feoffees, to accommodate the Master and Usher, \u2014 this noble Seminary is now in great celebrity, and including the native boys, contains about Two Hundred and Thirty Scholars. On a vacancy of the Office of the Master, or Usher, by Death or Resignation, \u2014 (for there is no instance of the removal of either for misbehaviour, \u2014 a circumstance much"], [410, "DEVON. [TlVERTON, 348 to the credit of those who have filled these Offices) \u2014 the va cancy has been filled up by the Majority of the Feoffees, previous notice of an Election having been given by the Clerk in various Newspapers. In case of a Resignation, it was \" ordered, in 1775, that the Master, and Usher, is to give notice thereof at Whit suntide or Christmas.\" And, in 1797, a further order was made, requiring at least Eight months'1 notice from the Mas ter, or Usher, of their intention to resign. Upon some disputes between the Master and Usher in the year 1 734, it was \" ordered, that the superintendancy of both Schools shall be in the Master.\" Upon some further disputes between them in 1791, the last order was confirmed, with this addition, \" that the School hours be the same to both Master, and Usher, and equally to be observed by each of them.\" And, it was likewise then \" ordered, that the direction of the Gates shall be with the Master, who may order them to be opened and shut when he thinks pro per, \u2014 but that both Master, and Usher, be separately at liberty to give leave to any boy, who boards in their respec tive Houses, to go out on application of their Friends ; \u2014 and that the same rule be extended to the liberty of the boys absenting themselves from Church, unless under the imme diate care of the respective Masters.\" Should the Feoffees at any time think proper to remove the Master or Usher, the Bishop of the Diocese has no power to prohibit, \u2014 but his allowance is necessary to confirm an Election. A Clerk was chosen with the appointed Salary ; but the Feoffees elected a Treasurer from among themselves, who kept the Accompts, and was responsible for the receipts and payments, from the year 1610 to 1 734; when it being thought too much trouble, they consolidated the two offices, which Union still continues, and increased the Salary to \u00a314. a year. The Clerk's conduct is regulated by the Feoffees"], [411, "TlVERTON J DEVON. 349 at their Meeting, and the Directions to him are entered in their Book of Orders. \" Our Book of Orders,\" Mr. Incledon observes, \" com menced in the year 1663. It is evident from a passage in the great Book of Account, that there was another Book of Orders {not to be found at this time) of a much earlier date, the fate of which requires that there should be nure care taken of this. A duplicate of it is certainly as necessary as that of the great Book of Account ; and when it is made, the best way of preserving it, will be to place the original in the Chest, and the duplicate may remain with the Clerk. \" Upon what account they were taken out of the Chest is at this time unknown, but a great number of Deeds and Evidences belonging to our Trust are certainly removed, and cannot now be found. Our Clerk (Mr. George Owens), to my certain know ledge, has been very assiduous in his searches, and has recovered many of the Records of the School, which had been removed long before he came into office : and I have no doubt, but from the same degree of assiduity he will recover more of them. \u2014 Should he fail of success, the interference of the Feoffees will be highly necessary to obtain them by some legal method.\" In 1678, Mr. John Ham, of Uplowman, Gentleman, by his Will, dated in that year, directs, \u2014 \" Also whereas my Father deceased, by his Will gave towards a Stock for a Work-house in Tiverton, \u00a330., so as the same were sett up and \u00a3200. by the Maior and Company raised for the same within three years after his death (which not being done, nor the said \u00a330. paid), now my will is (though I do not conceive myself engaged thereunto), that in lieu thereof, and out of that respect and duty I owe to Learning, and especially to the Foundation of Tiverton School, (the promotion of Learn ing being Charity indeed?, I do appoint my Executor hereafter named to bestow, with the advice of Mr. Blundell's Feoffees, \u00a3'200. out of my estate (which shall be paid bj \u00a340. per annum to the said Feoffees to that end), which shall be towards the maintenance of a Fellow and Scholar in Sidney Sussex Col lege in Cambridge, or in Balliol College in Oxon, to be chosen from Tiverton School after the first appointment, which first ap pointment for the Fellowship my will is, shall be my son John Ham, with liberty for him to study either Divinity or Physick, \u2014 after his enjoyment thereof, then the same to be enjoied by such suctessors as the Feoffees shall elect of Scholars taught in Tiver ton School, and borne in the Town of Tiverton if any be fitt, and"], [412, "DEVON.

The money for a long while laid blended with Blundell's Charity, untd some of the Feoffees judging it proper that this Donation should remain distinct from Blundell's, an application was made to Chancery for instructions, how to act in this business, when it was reported (in 1740) by the Master, to whom the consideration had been referred, that the sum of \u00a3844.. 18. .9. Old South Sea Annuities was the proportion, and did belong to Ham's Charity, and that the Income and Produce thereof, would untd reduction of the said Old South Sea Annuities annually produce \u00a333..15..10.\"\u2014 And by the same Report, the Master fur ther directed \" that the Feoffees might dispose of the in come, in one or more Exhibitions at large, at any College in either of the Universities, in such manner as they should think fit.\" The Master's Directions have been followed ever since in the disposal of the Income of this Donation.

The Feoffees wishing to pay every proper attention to the advice of Mr. Incledon, \" so zealous a friend to the Foundation,\" at their Meeting, in 1792, adopted the mea sure thus recommended. Mr. Benjamin Gilrerd, of the City of Exeter, Grocer, by his Will dated the 8th of November, 1783,\u2014 Devised to his Trustees, \" to be paid them immediately after my dece3ase, so much money as will purchase sufficient Capital Stock in some or one of the public Funds or Government Secu rity, to produce the annual Dividend or Income of \u00a360., which purch3ase shall be made in the names of my said Trustees, and the Dividends, Interest, and Produce thereof received by them, and paid over unto my Servant Agnes Nott into her own hands only, and not to any person to whom she may sell or assign it, for her own absolute benefit during her life. \u2014 \" And, after her decease, I will that the Stock shall be trans ferred to The Trustees of Blundell's Free Latin School in the Town of Tiverton or some of them, so that the interest thereof may be emploied for the benefit of the School, and the Scholars educated therein at the discretion of the said Trustees.\" The Annuitant, Agnes Nott, afterwards married Mr. Oxton, Supervisor of Excise at Barnstaple. She died on the 26th of November, 1801."], [414, "352 DEVON. [Tiverton, At the Meeting in 1802, it was ordered, that \u00a3l0.^er annum should, from that day, be paid to each of thetwo Senior Scholars at Balliol College, and that the like sum should be paid to each of the two Senior Scholars at Sydney College, in addition to dieir present Stipend, \u2014 And that an Exhibi tion should be founded, to be called \" Gilberd's Exhibi tion,\" with a Stipend of \u00a320. per annum. The first Exhi bitioner to be elected at the Meeting, in 1803, and to be at liberty to enter at any College, in either of the Two Univer sities of Oxford or Cambridge. The election to be subject to the same orders, in all other respects, as the Scholars and Exhibitioners on the other Foundations. Mr. Gilberd was a native of Tiverton, and born in the year 1721. He was a younger son of Richard, and Grand son of John Gilberd, Merchants of that Town. He died unmarried at Exeter, in the year 1790, after having carried on the trade of a Grocer, with great reputation, and great success. In 1715, The Revd. John Newte, Clerk, Rector of Tiverton, by his Will dated the 10th of January in that year, directs, \u2014 \"First, I give the annual Income or Profits of the lands I have in the Parish of Braunton, in this County, called \" Lobb Philip,\" to my brother Peter Newte for and during his natural Use, and after his decease to my Nephew Samuel Newte during his na tural life, and after his decease I give and bequeath the same to The Master and Fellows of Balliol College in Oxford for the time being, for ever, the annual profits to be bestowed by them in an Exhibition on a Scholar not of Blundell's Fellows, but to be chosen out of Blundell's School by the Three Rectors (The Rectory being in three Portions) of Tiverton aforesaid, or any two of them for the time being ; \u2014 which Scholar so chosen as aforesaid, shall receive the benefit of this Exhibition yearly for Seven years, if he shall continue Member of the College so long, but no longer.\" \" I am aware,\" Mr. Incledon observes, \" that it may be said, that the Feoffees of Blundell's lands have nothing"], [415, "Tiverton.] DEVON. 353 to do with this Donation, \u2014 yet it surely has some claim to a place with the other Donations to the School, as the person who is to receive the benefit of it, must have his Education within the walls of that Seminary. \" Mr. Newte was the son of The Revd. Richard Newte, one of the Rectors of the Church of Tiverton, whose kindness to the School has already been mentioned, \u2014 was educated in the School, and was the first Fellow in Balliol Col lege,on the second establishment in the year 1676. He became Rector of two portions in that Church, and died in 1715. \" The Exhibition did not take place, 'till some years after his death. It's clear Income is now \u00a321. a year, 'she Stu dent holds it for Seven years. \" Far be it from my thoughts,\" says Mr. Incledon, \" to reflect on the Directions of the Donor, or on the Rectors in executing them, in respect of electing the boys for College, \u2014 But it surely can be no improper observation to suggest, that it might be no unwelcome scene to the eye of the Pub lic, could they see an emulation of Candidates for this Exhi bition brought forward in the same place and manner, as is done in the Elections of Blundell's Scholars. \" I flatter myself that I run no risque of censure from the Rectors in what I hint at, nor from The Feoffees in anticipating their concurrence to my proposition.\" In the year 1741, The Feoffees being divided in opinion, in what manner they ought to apply the Trust money, which remained after the discharge of the general annual expense, and which had arisen from the deaths of Tenants upon the estates, and from the Legacy given by Mr. Ham, applied to Chancery by an amicable Bill, and in the Master's Report it is said, that \" the Feoffees might apply the Surplusage of Blundell's Charity in augmentation of Stipends of Blundell's Scholars at Balliol, or Sydney Sussex College, \u2014 or, in addition of new Scholarships, \u2014 or, in one or more Exhibitions at large to any College in Oxford or Cambridge, Vol. i. A a"], [416, "DEVON. [Tiverton, 354 as they think fit, it not being possible to establish any parti cular sum.\" An augmentation of \u00a34. a year was made to each of Blundell's Scholars at Balliol, and another of \u00a39. a year to each of those at Sydney Sussex College. And the Scho lars at these two Colleges have since had an addition of \u00a310. a year each, from Mr. Gilberd's donation. A Vacancy of a Scholarship may happen from the follow ing causes, \u2014 viz., \" Insufficiency in Learning after Three years' probation. \" Not studying Divinity and becoming Preachers of the word of God. \" Having held a Fellowship Ten years after A. M., or time to be A.M., \" Death, Marriage, or Acceptance of a School. \" Acceptance of a Benefice with Cure of Souls. On every Vacancy of a Scholarship, the College is obliged, by the Agreements with the Feoffees, \" within Two months after to give notice to the Feoffees, that they may make choice of another Scholar in the School : and the dlowance &c, of Commons for two months following, remains for Scholars which shall be next sent. If, upon notice given, the Feoffees shall not within two months send a Scholar, the College may retain allowance untd Scholar be sent. But if Scholar be not sent for want of notice, the Scholar next sent shall receive allowance, &c, from the vacancy,\" In consequence of the Vacancy being noticed, the Feof fees, until the year 1764, met within a short space of time, and elected a Scholar ; but, in that year, an Order (which has since been adhered to) was made, \" that the Feoffees should annually meet on the 29th day of June, unless that day happened on a Sunday, and then on the Monday following.\" This Order, according to Mr. Incledon, seems to militate against the spirit of the Agreements already mentioned, and against promoting Emulation in the Candidates, in as much as any Procrastination of an Election of a Scholar by the"], [417, "Tiverton.] DEVON. 355 Feoffees, throws the Income of the vacant Scholarship into a different channel from that in which it ought to go : and besides that, the boys placed at the School on purpose to be Candidates may, for want of a sufficient number of Feoffees being present to elect a Schokr, be superannuated. Within a few years past the Election has been frequently put off, because a sufficient number of Feoffees did not at tend, which confirms the propriety of Mr. Incledon's remark. When a Meeting is holden, \" a Chairman is balloted for, who has a casting Vote, in case of an equality of Votes, upon any question respecting the Trust.\" The Candidates make Latin Orations, \u2014 produce Poetical Compositions \u2014 and are examined in the Classics by the Master, in the presence of the Feoffees, and a public Audience in the School. It is necessary that the Candidates be furnished with a Certificate of their age, for, as by the Will no boy can re main in the School after he is Eighteen years of age, so he is ineligible unto a Scholarship, and inadmissible into College aster he has completed that period. By way of caution to all parties interested in the Election of Scholars for the Colleges, the following Orders have been m:ade by the Feoffees, viz., \"That Boys chosen, shall at the next term at farthest after the Election repair to College, and that until next term or admis sion into College, they shall continue at this School, and not at any other. \" Boys not complying with the above Order, shall forfeit the benefit of such Election, unless prevented by Providence, or other reason to be allowed by the Feoffees. \" No boy in future shall stand as a Candidate, unless such boy hath been resident in school Three years next before. \" No Scholar of Blundell's School who shall be absent therefrom, and have entered at either of the Universities and continued there more than one Term, shall be eligible on Blun dell's or Ham's Foundation.\" Many disputes between the Feoffees and Balliol"], [418, "[Tiverton. 356 DEVON.

The transactions between the Feoffees and Sydney Sussex College have never been interrupted. The present Head Master is, The Revd. William Page Richards, M. A., of New College, Oxford, whose Salary is \u00a350. per annum. The present Usher is, The Revd.

Some of the Masters have been allowed \u00a310. a year out the Trust money, when they have wished to have an Assist ant in the Higher School. The expense of Boarding in the house of the Master, or of the Usher, is the same, and is about \u00a330. per annum. The charge for Tuition by the Master is Five guineas per annum, \u2014 and by the Usher Four guineas.

There are no Church Preferments, nor other advanta:ges, belonging to the M3aster of this School : The Founder having expressed his hope, that the Masters would \" bould them selves satisfied and contente with that recompense for their travell,\" which he had assi:gned. \" Near Two Hundred years,\" Mr. Incledon observes, \" having elapsed since the Foundation of this School, it is most likely that, if the Master or Usher had not observed this Rule, it would have been noticed in the archives of the School ; but as nothing of the kind appears, there needs no further comment on this passage. \u2014 \" However, I cannot help remarking, that on a req'iest of the Master, \" in the year 1779, leave was 3given him to serve the Parish of Stoodley,\" which is distant about Five mdes"], [420, "DEVON.

A Proposal being made by the Master of the School, at the Meeting of the Feoffees in the year 1776, for giving an Honorary Medal to boys educated at this School, who should distinguish themselves by Literary Abilities, it met with a most cheerful reception. In the following year, the Proposal was renewed, and a liberal Subscription was entered into by the Feoffees then present, which was sufficient for procuring a Die, and some Medals in sdver and copper. Although the Scheme was, as it were, in it's infancy, the boys were induced to bring forward their exercises at the time of Subscription, upon a promise of Two Silver Medals. \u2014 The Institution was then opened (in 1777) by an Oration in Latin, on The Founder of the School. As soon as the Medals could be procured, which was sometime in the year 1778, the boy (John Matthews) who had distinguished himself by the Oration, and another boy (Bourchier William Wrey) who had distinguished him self by Speaking, were each presented with a Sdver Medal. To the politeness of Sir Charles Warwick Bampfylde, Bart., one of the Feoffees, the Institution is indebted for the design of the Medal, which was executed by Mr. Pingo with his usu3al ingenuity. The expense of the Die was \u00a347..5..0. \u2014 A Sdver Medal comes to about 7s..8d., and a Copper one to about 4*.

The Free Geammar School at Milton was founded by William Middleton, Abbot of Milton, in the I'welfth year of King Henry the Eighth, 1521 : who, about the same time, purchased of Thomas Kirton the Manor, Farm, and Free Chapel of Little Mayne, containing 200 acres of land, in the County of Dorset, with which he en dowed the School. By Deed, dated the 10th of February, 1521, under the Com mon Seal of the Abbey of Milton, the said Abbot, with the con sent of his Convent, grants the Manor and premises of Little Mayne to Thomas Kirton, which had been before purchased of him, upon Trust, that he should convey the same to Sir Giles Strangways and other Feoffees, to the intent to maintain a Free Grammar School in the Town of Milton, and to employ the profits of the said Manor and premises to the maintenance of a School, and of a Schoolmaster for the term of Ninety-seven years : But, if within that time license might be obtained to alien the said Manor and premises in mortmain, that then the Feoffees should grant the same to the use of the said School ; But, if such license could not be obtained, that then the Feoffees, after the expiration of the said term, should sell the Manor and premises, and employ the money arising therefrom in the main tenance of the School, as long as might be. In pursuance of the Abbot's direction, the Manor, farai, and Free Chapel of Little Mayne were conveyed by Kirton, in the Twenty-eighth of Henry the Eighth, to the several Feoffees, for the purposes expressed in his grant. The Feoffees were empowered to \" visit, place, and displace the Schoolmaster, wherein they should also confer with and use the advice and consent of Six of the principal Inhabitants of the Town of Milton.\" And it appears, that the School \"being seated even in the middle of the County of Dorset\" was \"of good regard, and, in former times, much frequented.\" In 1784, the Lord of the Manor of Milton having rebuilt his Mansion House, and deeming the School-house to be an impediment to his plan of ornamenting the environs, brought"], [437, "Milton Abbas.] DORSET. 375 a Bill into Parliament for removing it to Dorchester, ten miles distant from Milton. This measure was opposed by the Feoffees ; and the project was finally abandoned. But, in the succeeding year, application was made to Par liament to remove the School to the Town of Blandford : which measure was also opposed by the Feoffees, but with different success ; for an Act was then obtained \" for vest ing the School-house, &c, in or near the Town of Milton, in Joseph Lord Milton and his Heirs, in lieu of, or in compensation for, a messuage or tenement, &c, situate in the Town of Blandford Forum, of greater value.\" To the honour of the Feoffees it ought to be remembered, that during a litigation of more than Twenty years, which was attended with an enormous expense, they paid the wlwle out of their private purses, witlunit charging a single Shil ling to the account of the Charity : an example well worthy of Imitation ! By the removd of the School to Blandford, a distance of six miles from Milton Abbas, the original intention of The Founder has been entirely defeated, and the benefits of the Institution have been lost to the public, as no children have been sent for education since tliat period !

The Grammar School at Shaftesbuey, which was^ for many years a principal Seminary in the West of England, is now no more. There is not, however, to be found any trace of a regular Endowment : all that is certainly known is, that there was a commodious Scho d-house, garden, and offices in Bimport Street, which, in the early part of the reign of King Charles the First, for the consideration of \u00a340., were conveyed by Jane, Wife of Hugh Grove, Esq., of Chisenbury, Daugh ter of William Grove, Esq., of Shaftesbury, to William Whitaker, Esq,, of that place, and William Hurman, Gentleman. Mr. Whitaker and Mr. Hurman by Indenture of Feoffment, dated in 1646, recite, that heretofore the said William Whita ker and William Hurman did with the sum of \u00a340., the pro per monies of the said William Whitaker, purchase one mes su3age, tenement, and gardens thereafter mentioned, originally intended for the use of the Mayor, Recorder, and Capital Bur gessess of the Borough of Shaston for the time being, and their Successors, \" to be by them employed to and for the erecting and making of a School-house or Free School within the Borough of Shaston and accommodation of a Schoolmaster, to be conveyed over by the said William Whitaker and William Hurman on pay ment to the former of \u00a340. by the said Mayor, Recorder, and Ca pital Burgesses'\" And the said William Whitaker, and William Hurman, grant the premises (describing them as then being in the occu pation of Thomas Garden, M.A., Schoolmaster of the said School,) to Albinus Muston, Gentleman, and Nicholas Coo per, of Shaftesbury, Gentleman, and their Heirs, to the use of the Mayor, Recorder, and Capital Burgesses of Shaston for the time being, and their Successors, according to the intcni of the original purchase. If it should be asked, how a School-master having only a Salary of 40?. could have been induced to take boys, and to educate them grammatically, the only probable answer is, \u2014 That the Parsonage-house of the Town being wholly"], [439, "Shaftesbury] DORSET. 377 unfit for a Clergyman to reside in, whilst die School-house was very commodious, \u2014 and the person succeeding to the House, probably succeeded to the benefit of a Grammar School then in good repute. Dr. Abbot successively Master of the Public Schools at Abingdon in Berkshire and of Colchester in Essex, Father of the late distinguished Speaker of The House of Commons now Charles Lord Colchester, was educated upon the Foundation under the care of Mr. Clarke. By the List of Masters it appears, that to Mr. Mitchell succeeded The Revd. Mr. Topham, and to him his :son, both of whom kept a Grammar School, but there was no Scholar taken gratuitously : \u2014 the latter, however, leaving the Town of Shaftesbury, the house was untenanted and the buildings became much out of repair. The Corporation was too poor, or was unwilling to repair them, and the School, as a Gr:ammar School, may from that time be considered as at an end- It is true, that The Revd. Mr. Christie afterwards kept a Grammar School in the same house, but he paid a rent for it, and had not the 40*. Stipend. Although there is now a Grammar School here, it is not kept on the old scite, \u2014 nor is there now any allowance from The Corporation, as they considered the 40*. per annum in the nature of a free gift to the Master, \u2014 and, therefore, the regular School may be considered as extinct.

The Revenues of the School have been formerly much neglected, if not abused ; but new Regulations have of late years been proposed and adopted. For the improvements which have taken place in these Charities, the Public are indebted in a great measure to the late Revd. John Chafie, who was for some time a very active Brother of the Alms house, and Governor of the School. A body of Statutes for the government of the School was drawn up soon after it was founded; but they have been altered from time to time by the advice of the Bishops of Bristol : \u2014 By the Statutes which were made on the 10th of October, 1679, it is directed, that the Upper Master shall be a Master of Arts at least, of one of the Two Universities, well skilled in the Latin and Greek languages, &c; and that he shall be ob liged to undertake no other profession (otherwise than a Minis ter of the Church of England), that may divert his diligence and care from the said School : \u2014 The Usher shall be a Bachelor of Arts, and under the same restrictions as the Upper M^ter : \u2014 But it is not requisite that the Masters should have entered into Holy Orders : \u2014 Every Scholar that shall be admitted into the said School, shall pay unto the Schoolmaster Is. 6d., whereof Ad. shall be for the Master, and Ad. for the Usher ; And of so many shall be yearly admitted into the said School, between the Fe3ast of St. Michael and the same Feast next after, the Schoolmaster shall deliver up a Roll of their names, with Ad. for every name so inrolled unto the Warden, to be inrolled in a Book for that pur pose kept by the Warden, and 6d. towards the increase of Books in the Library, for which the Warden shall yearly give an account : \u2014 Each Boy to pay 6d. annually towards Books. The Master, and Brethren of the Alms-house, have usually been Governors, and each in their turn Warden and Sub- Warden of the School. The present site of the School (formerly a part of The"], [443, "Sherborne.] DORSET. 381 Abbey) was granted to the Governors by Sir John Horsey', of Clifton, about the first or second year of Philip and Maey, 1553-4. The South side, and the centre of the Upper Master's house, were part of the West end of the Chapels of Our Lady, and of Our Lady of Bow. The groined arches and tracery, once richly painted and gdt, still remain in the bed- rooms, exactly corresponding in style and ornaments with the stone roof of the Church. When these Chapels were converted into a Dwelling-house, the Arms of France and England, quarterly in a lozenge, crowned and supported by two Dragons, were placed over the upper Window of the South front in a square frame with WTeathed pedestals, crowned, and beautifully dressed with open pease cods and flowers. These fell down after the frost in 1 796 or 1797, but have since been replaced. The present School is an elegant room, which was erected in the reign of Charles the Second upon the site of an ancient Chapel. Over the Head Master's desk is the Statue of the Founder. Adjoining to the School is a smaller room, now used as a Writing-School, and Dining-hall for the Boarders: above which is another very commodious room, very neatly and conveniently fitted up as a Library, and containing many rare and valuable books, which have either been given by the neighbouring Gentry, or purchased for the use of the School. The Offices belonging to the Master's House, Lodgings for the boys, and two spacious Playing-Courts, are on the North side of the Church, extending at present as far as the site of the East walk of the Cloister.

About the beginning of the reign of King Charles the First several disputes arising between the Governors and the Parishioners, relating to the payment of the Tythes, the Governors, with the consent of the major part of the Pa rishioners, surrendered the Charter into the King's hands, \u2014 who, by Letters Patent in the 14th year of his reign, 1639, in consideration of \u00a31000. paid into the Exchequer, re granted all the Tythes, Lands, and Possessions belonging to the Church and School, to Twelve Governors therein named, and incorporated them by the style of \" Primos et modernos gubernatores possessionum, revencionum, et bo norum dicte libere Schole grammaticalis regine Elisabethe in Wymborne Minster, in comitatu Dorset :\" \u2014 The Governors to find a fit and learned Master, and Usher, to teach Grammar, as in the former Charter, to all who shall come for instruction, freely, according to the usage of the Schools of Eton and Winchester."], [449, "Wimborne.] DORSET. 387 In the year 1658, The Corporation considering that many of the leases before granted, depended only upon one life, and many of them were likely to drop ; and though the Stipends of the Three Ministers, Schoolmaster, &c, much exceeded what they were when the Patent was granted by King Charles the First, yet the better to enable the Minis ters and other Officers of the Church and School, to dis charge their several duties, it was agreed, that such of the rents as should come into their hands by the expiration of any of the leases or otherwise, and all other rents which they should receive (their necessary allowances, and all expenses being deducted), should remain for the increase of the Sti pends of the Three Ministers until they amounted to \u00a3300. per annum, \u2014 to be apportioned as the Corporation in their discretion should think proper : \u2014 It was also agreed, that the rest of the rents and all the revenues, with their increase, by advancing any of the rates, or by Tythes in kind or otherwise (expenses, and allowances, being first deducted) should remain to increase the Stipend of the School-master to \u00a340., and that of the LT slier to \u00a320., and for the mmntenance of the Three Clerks, and for such other purposes as are mentioned in the Charter, or are not repugnant to it.

The Charter which is in good preservation, is written in a beautiful character, with the Great Seal appendant : and is in the custody of George Allan, Esq., M. P. for the City of Durham. The Four Church-Wardens, for the time being, are appointed Guardians and Governors, with a Common Seal : and are empowered, with the assent of the Bishop of Durham, for the time being, and the Earl of Westmor land, to make Statutes for the School. Whether any Statutes were anciently ordained under those powers, is not known. But, in 17 48, a Table of Rules was settled aud agreed upon, and thereto the Seal was affixed in due form. They were laid before Bishop Chandler, who ratified the same by his Letters of Confirmation under the Episcopal Seal : The title of Earl of Westmorland in the Nevill family being then extinct.

Whereas formerly, several Persons have, during the time of their being Churchwardens, agreed with the Tenants and Farmers of the Lands and Houses belonging to the Church, Free School and Poor of the Town of Darlington, for the Renewal of their Leases, long before the Leases then in being were expired, and have granted them new Leases, without taking any Fine or reserving any greater Rent, to the advantage of the Church and improvement of the srnd School. Now for preventing the like abuses for the future, and for the better management of the Trusts reposed in the Churchwardens that shall be chosen from time to time ; it is hereby concluded and agreed upon, by us whose N3ames are hereunto subscribed, that no Le3ase or Leases shall from henceforth be at any time let or granted of any of the Lands or Houses belonging to the Church or the Free School, until the same shall be within two Years of expiring, according to the date of such Lease or Leases : And that before such Le;ase or Leases be granted, three days public Notice shall be given in the Church of the intention of the Churchwardens to meet in the Vestry to contrMt with the Tenants for the same, and the terms of letting the said Leases shall be such, as the Four and Twenty, or the major part of them theo present, shall agree upon, and not otherwise : And whereas the present agreement cannot have it's intended effect or be of any force, unless the Churchwardens be from time to time chosen out of theFourand Twenty, and the"], [460, "DURHAM.

The Opinion of John Middleton, Esquire, (Councellor at Law), on the Charter for the Free Grammar School at Darlington. (19 March 1688.) 1. I am of Opinion, that by Queen Elizabeth's Charter now produced, the Churchwardens of Darlington are made a Corpor ation, capable of purchasing Lands, Tenements, Goods and Chatties, for the maintenance of a free Grammar School in Darlington. 2. And tho' the Town of Darlington be only mentioned, yet the intention of the instituting such School is plain, that it is for the service of the Parish, two of the Governors living always out of the Township, and the Twenty-four who chuse those Governors, living many of them likewise out of the Township ; yet such School is designed for the further Instruction of those that can read, and not to teach Children to read. 3. The Churchwardens of the said Parish have an absolute power, without the concurrence of any other, of placing, and displacing of the School Master and Usher as they please, but they must take care to place such Persons there, .as resort to Church, or otherwise be licensed by the Bishop. 4. The Churchwardens, or Governors for the time being, may make such Orders, Statutes and Ordinances, for the better ordering of the said School, ascertaining the Sallaries, &c, as to them shall seem meet, but such Orders, or Ordinances, must be confirmed by the Earl of Westmoreland and Bishop of Durham for the time being. 5. But neither the Earl of Westmoreland nor Bishop of Durham, nor both of them together, can place, or displace any School Master or Usher there, nor do any other thing touching the same, without the assent of the said Governors. 6. All Rents, Issues, and Profits of the Lands given for the improvement of the said Free School, as well as all Fines paid upon the renewal of any Lease, ought to be paid first to the said"], [461, "Darlington.] DURHAM. 399 Governors, and by them disposed of to the said School Master and Usher, at their discretions, and if any more Monies be raised thereon than will pay or satisfy such Master and Usher, they may purchase Lands or Tenements therewith for the further use of the said School, and out of the same profits, the said Governors may deduct their necessary expences. 7. No Leases can be made of the Lands belonging to the said School but by the said Churchwardens or Governors, under the proper Seal appointed for that purpose, and all Leases made otherwise are void. As to the present Tenants, I can say nothing, till I see the Leases. 8. If any Leases be well made to them, till such Leases be expired, no Rent can be advanced, but after such expiration, the same may be raised. 9. But if any of their Leases be void, neither Law nor Equity will compel the Governors to make such Leases good, unless a valuable consideration or Fine hath been paid for the same to some of the Governors, and not to any other Person. 10. The proper way will be for the Churchwardens to seal a Writing under their proper .Seal for th.it purpose, giving power to some Person to enter into all the Lands belonging to the said School, and discharge the Tenants from paying any further Rent to the School Master, and if the Tenants refuse to pay their Rents to the Governors, to turn them out of possession by bringing Ejectments. 11. If any Writing belonging to the School be in the Hands of any Person who will not deliver the same, the properest remedy is by Bill in Chancery. 12. The present Governors or Churchwardens may in Chancery call any former Governors or other Persons to account, who hath misemployed any profits belonging to the said School.

I have perused the Charter of Queen Elizabeth for erecting a Free Grammar School at Darlington, whereby the Church wardens for the time being are Incorporated and made Governors thereof; and I am of Opinion, that the Governors for the time being, or any three of have full power by the Charter, to elect, place and displace the Master or Usher, when, and as often, as they think fit ; and when they think fit to displace a Master, I think they should enter an Order for that purpose, signed by three of the Governors at the least, and serve a Copy thereof upon the Master to be displaced, and from that time,"], [462, "DURHAM. [Darlington- 400 they m<ty withdraw his Sallary, and if he refuseth to deliver up the Key of the School upon demand, they may pull off the Lock and set on another, and in the chusing a new Master, they must take care to chuse one, who will qualify himself as the Law directs.

The Classics are taught, free of expense, to all the bovs of the Town and Parish, without limitation to any particular persons whatever. The number is generally about Sixty. They are admitted as soon as they are able to read ; and have no specified time of superannuation. Ward's Accidence, and the Eton Greek Grammar, are used. And the system of Education is the same, as is pur sued in the great Seminaries. There are no Exhibitions, nor other University advantages, belonging to this School. The present Head Master is, The Revd. William Cle mentson, whose Salary, after deducting \u00a350. for the Usher, and other incidental expenses, amounts to nearly \u00a3200. per annum. This Gentleman admits Four Private Pupils into his own house ; his terms, for boys under Twelve years of age, being Thirty guineas a year ; and for those, above that age, Forty guineas, which include Board, Education, Washing, &c.

The Free Grammar School and Alms-House of Kep ver, in Houghton le Spring, owe their origin to the emi nent Divine, Bernard Gilpin, for his excellent character and usefulness, called \" The Apostle of The North,\" \u2014 who, observing the scarcity of learned men who were able to preach the word of God, conceived the thoughts of a Semin:ary of good Literature, and erected a School here, allowing a maintenance for a Master, and Usher. This School was soon very numerously attended, and many learned men were educated in it, \u2014 so that \" Master Gilpin's School was every where spoken of to his credit, but himselfe much more.\" Mr. Gilpin found a powerful friend in John Heath, of Kcpyer, Esquire, who supported the infant Foundation with his interest, and contributed liberally tow^ds it's Endow ment ; and either from compliment to him, or because the greater part of the Endowment arose from lands belonging to the Dissolved house of Kepycr, the School probably received it's name.

The first Governors, probably, never exercised their power of enacting Statutes. Mr. Gilpin during his life direc ted the whole administration of the School in person ; and having it continually in contemplation to increase the Foun dation according to his pecuniary circumstances, left it at his death with no other regulations than such as were con tained in the original Charter ; and his Will, dated the 17th of October, 1582, very evidently expresses considerable doubt and anxiety for the fate of his infant and unsettled Establishment. It has been most unfortunately contrived, that the chief part of the Revenues consist of various small portions of \" Gilly Tythes?' that is, Tythes formerly belonging to The Dissolved Hospital of St Giles of Kepyer, scattered in very different places, and very precarious in their amount ; and in Rent-charges out of several estates, which, from the gra dual diminution of the value of money, have become exceedingly trifling. The foundation, however, has always proved sufficient to ensure the attendance of a Master of Character and Ability ; and if few names of peculiar eminence can be found amongst it's Scholars, yet for Two Centuries Kepyer School has continued to fulfil the wise and benevolent purposes of The Founder, and to dispense, through the neighbouring Districts, a sufficient portion of sound Learn ing and of good Morals.

[Bosbuhy. 480 BOSBURY, near Ledburv. The Grammar School at Bosbury is supposed to have been founded by Sir Rowland Morton, who is said to have possessed \" The Grange Estate\" in this Parish, but at what period has not been ascertained ; though it must have been prior to the reign of Queen Elizabeth, as Her Majesty endowed the School with \u00a38..4..2. per annum, which is charged upon the Manor of Wormbridge, in the County of Hereford, and is now paid by The King's Receiver of Fee- Farm Rents to the Master. Sir Rowland Morton is also said to have built a neat stone-roofed Chapel at the South Aisle of the Church, adjoining the Chancel, where his Coat of Arms appears upon the inside of the roof in different places. The present Endowment consists of about Thirty-two acres of land, and Eight cottages, dispersed all over the Parish of Bosbury : The management of which, as well as the appointment of the Master, is vested in Twelve Trustees. About Twenty years since, the Trustees elected as Master of the School, an illiterate man who had never learned or knew a single word of the Latin or Greek languages; although the former Masters had always been Clergymen of the Church of England. Some of the Trustees who resided in the Parish, it is said, had got possession of considerable portions of the land contiguous to their own estates, at a very inferior rent. The Master's house, which he now occupies, had not been in the possession of the Masters for the last Thirty years, until the present Gentleman came ; \u2014 the House, together with a valuable Orchard, and other lands about an acre and"], [543, "Bosbury.] HEREFORD. 481 an half worth from \u00a312. to \u00a314. per annum, having been lett for the greater part of that time \" to a near Relation of one of the Trustees at \u00a33. per annum\"! \u2014 whde the Masters of the School were obliged to lodge where they could, \u2014 some, at the distance of four miles. It is also supposed that several pieces of land, originally belonging to the School, have been lost, \" by levelling the boundaries, and thereby mixing them with other lands.\" Upon these accounts, the late Vicar of Bosbury, and some of the Inhabitants of the Parish, laudably instituted a suit in Chancery against the Trustees, to compel them to elect a Clerigyman and Grammar Master, and also to relinquish such lands as they had in their hands, and to lett them at their full value. The present Lord Chancellor has decreed, \" that the said School is a Grammar School,\" and thereupon the Master has been appointed, but the other points are not yet determined. All the boys of this Parish, as soon as they begin to learn the Latin language, are taught free of expense. Since the present M.oster was elected, in 1815, he has tdso most bene volently taken Ten boys whom he instructs in reading, writing, and arithmetic gratuitously, although he does not consider himself bound to do so. About ten or fifteen other boys are usually educated at this School. Children are admitted at about ten years of age, and there is no prescribed time of superannuation. The Master no minates. There is no particular form of Admission. The Eton Latin and Greek Grammars are used ; and the system of Education is upon the Eton plan. In 1676, Richard Reed, Esq., of Lugwardine, sounded an Exhibition of \u00a34. per annum at Brasen-Nose College, Oxford, for the maintenance of one Scholar of bis Posterity, or for a Scholar from the School of Bosbury, or from the Free School of the City of Hereford, being natives of the County of Hereford. vol. i.

HEREFORD. 488 HEREFORD. The earliest notice which has been met with on record of a School in Hereford, is contained in the Register of Bishop Trillick, and is dated the 26th of December, 1384. It was probably founded under the auspices of that Pre late ; and the word \" consuetudinibus\" which occurs in the obscured entry alluded to in his Register, may refer rather to the general customs of similar Establishments in other places than to any in previous existence here ; for no men tion is made of a School in the several Registers of Canti lupe, Swinfield, Orlton, or T. Charlton, his Pre decessors. The amount of the original Endowment, if any, is un known : perhaps it depended upon the voluntary benevo lence of the Founder, and the succeeding Bishops. The object of the Foundation was to afford gratuitous Instruc tion to the sons of the poorer Inhabitants. It does not appear how long the means were found ade quate to the purpose intended ; but, as the subsequent Epis copal Registers are , as silent as their predecessors on the subject, the School probably languished until the reign of Edward* the Sixth, who issued an Injunction, that \" in every Cathedral Church where no Free Grammar School is found ed already within The Close, nor hath any such near unto it adjoining, founded already by any person, the King's Majesty willeth, that of the common lands and revenues of that Church shall be ordained, kept, and maintained perpe tually, a Free Grammar School.

In consequence of one or both of these Royal Ordinances a building was erected upon the Scite of the decayed Cloist ers at the West end of the Cathedral, and was applied to the purposes required. The next Statutes for the government of the Cathedral Church of Hereford, and it's appendages, were issued by Charles the First, on the 30th of May, 1637. They confirmed many of the previous regulations, abrogated others, and introduced such corrections and additions, as the lapse of time, and the change of circumstances, render occasionally necessary to insure the permanence and the purity of every human system. The Sixth chapter of these Statutes particularly refers to the School. In an account of annual payments made by the Church, dated 1st. of September 1636, are included, \" By the Cla~ viger, to the Head Schoolmaster, his annual Stipend \u00a320 : \u2014 to the Usher, his annual Stipend \u00a310.: \u2014 to the Scholars at the breaking up of School at Christmas, when they make Orations, uncertain :\u2014 to one Scholar or Scholars in Oxford \u00a34.\".

The Grammar School at Kington was founded by Mar garet Lady Hawkins, Widow of Sir John Hawkins, Knight, Treasurer of The Navy in the reign of Queen Eli zabeth ; who bequeathed \u00a3800. for the support of a Schcol-master and Usher, to be disbursed at a convenient time in the purchase of an estate, and in the erection of a suitable School-house. Some years after her decease, which happened in 1620, her Trustees very advantageously, and agreeably to her Will, bought with that sum, a landed estate of Three Hun dred acres, or thereabout, in the Township of Upper Hergest, within the Parish of Kington, and also One acre at the West end of the Town, whereon they caused to be erected a com modious stone House, which even yet has not suffered very material decay.

Salmon says, that Garine the Twentieth Abbot of this renowned Abbey, and his brother Matthew who was Prior after him, built a School in this Borough, \" which had the greatest number of Scholars of any in England.\" Mr. Clutterbuck mentions this Abbot by the name of Warren, and records his death as having occurred in the year 1195. In the Second and Third year of King Edward the Sixth, 1548, a Private Act of Parliament was obtained by Richard Boreman, who was the Fortieth and last Abbot, for erect ing a Grammar School \" in St. Alban's, or elsewhere within the Liberty or County.\" But, on the 12th of May, 1553, the School was formally established, by virtue of a Charter of that date, granted to the Borough by King Edward the Sixth, by which the Mayor and Burgesses were empowered to erect one Grammar School within the Church of St. Alban, or in any other con venient place within the Borough, and to make Statutes and Ordinances for the government of the same. Power was also given'to any of His Majesty's Subjects, to alienate lands and other possessions for it's support, to the annual value of \u00a340., notwithstanding the Statute of mortmain. Queen Mary, by her Charter, dated the 10th of Decem ber, 1553, confirmed the Charter of Edward the Sixth.

By the Statute of the Thirtieth of George the Second, 1757, it is provided, \" That the Mayor and Burgesses of the Borough of St. Alban, in the County of Hertford, shall not be debarred from enjoying and exercising all such liber ties and powers as were heretofore granted to them by seve ral Letters Patent under the Great Seal by Queen Eliza beth and King James the First, for erecting and licencing Three several Wine Taverns within the said Borough, towards the maintenance of The Free School there ; but the same liberties and powers are established and confinned to them by this Act, for the Charitable use aforesaid, accord ing to the tenor of the said Letters Patent.\" In Easter Term 1 803, an Information at the Suit of the King, in the name of The Attorney General, was filed against Ann Marks in the Court of Exchequer, for three penalties of \u00a320. each, under these Charters, for selling Wine with out license from the Mayor and Aldermen, although she had a licence from the Commissioners of Excise. In Trinity Term, 1804, Judgement was given for the Crown; and, by this decision, the validity of the Charters was fully estab lished. This power of granting licences for the sale of Wine, in exclusion of the common Wine Licences from the Commis sioners of Excise, is said to be confined to the Two English Universities, and the Borough of St. Alban.

Before the enfranchisement of this Estate, it appears by an Order of The Court of Chancery made in 1604, that John Robotham, Lord of the Manor of Newland Squillers, hav ing refused to admit the persons, then offering to be admitted, as Trustee of the Copyhold lands so given by Mr. Rayx shaw, was ordered so to do, and to pay a Fine of \u00a310.,\u2014 and he was further committed to The Fleet Prison by the then Chancellor, Lord Ellesmere, for a contempt, in using these words, \" that the Decree was a cozening Decree, and that the same was made under a Hedge,\" \u2014 but he was released upon submission, and compliance with the Order, which is now in the Town Chest of the Borough. Richard Plat, Citizen of London, by Indenture, during the reign of Queen Elizabeth, conveyed to the Mayor and Burgesses, and their Successors for ever, one Messuage, then in the occupation of John Midwinter, or his Under-Ten ants, for the support of The Free School; the rents of which have been accounted for, ever since the year 1608, to the School. This house was situate in the central part of the Town, and was formerly occupied by one of the Ushers ; but it was unfortunately burnt down in the year 1 745. The vacant space was afterwards let for \u00a3l..7\u00ab0. per annum. But, upon the recommendation of the present Head Master, the ground was let upon a budding lease for the term of 61 years, by Deed bearing date the 3d of August 1808, the Contractor agreeing to expend \u00a3350., and to pay a ground rent of \u00a32..5..0. per annum. And a handsome Brick house is now raised upon the site of the old Messuage. Thomas Hall, M. D., and Margaret his Wife, in 1582, surrendered certain Copyhold lands called \" Clay pits,\" in the Manor of Kingsbury and Parish of St. Michael, containing Nine acres, to Thomas Wooli\u00e6y, John Carter,"], [575, "Saint Alban's.] HERTFORD. 513 and John Clarke, and their heirs and assigns for ever, upon Trust, to pay yearly, for ever, 6d. to Eighty of die poorest people of this Town on Good Friday, and also on every Palm Sunday, 4d. to Sixty of the poor people of the Town of Hertford, \u2014 and \u00a32. per annum to The Under Master of The Free Grammar School of St. Alban's, half yearly, at Michaelmas and Lady-day in each year. But, unfortunately, through default of the appearance of the heir of William Young, the last surviving Trustee, this land was seized on the 30th of June, 1760, by the Lord of the Manor. And, as no measures have as yet been adopt ed, even by the legal Guardians of the Poor, to recover it, it has remained in the hands of the Lord ever since. This land is now let at the advanced rent of \u00a335. per annum ; and of course, it becomes an object of some consequence. The Noble Peer who is now possessed of this estate, may not, possibly, be acquainted with the nature of the original 3grant ; or, from the well known liberality of His Lordship, a spontaneous re-grant might probably follow. The Mayor and Aldermen were formerly not onlv the Patrons, but sole Trustees of the Revenues of the School. But, upon some supposed misapplication of part of the money, The Revd. Joseph Spooner, then Head Master, filed a Bill in Chancery, on the 19th of January 1782, praying to have the full benefit of the Revenue, and new Trustees ap pointed, and the Arrears paid. Whereupon the Court decreed, on the 16th of May, 1787, that Eight Trustees of the Charity lands should be appointed, \u2014 that Four should be electedyrowi the Corpora tion, and Four out of the Corporation, \u2014 That vacancies, occasioned by death, resignation, or removal, should tie afterwards filled, if a Member of the Corporation, by the Mayor and Aldermen, if not so, by the remainder of the other Four Trustees, \u2014 That the Charity lands should be conveyed to all the said Trustees, (which was accordingly vol. i.

Item, it is also ordered, that these Rules and Ordinances be once in a year on the Feast of All Saints read in the presence of the Maior, Burgesses, School-master, and Governors. In witness whereof as well the said Sir Nicholas as the said Maior and Burgesses have put their hands and Seals, &c.\" By an Order of The Corporation, on the 13th of June, 1602, the Master was to be paid Ad. Quarterly by every Scholar inhabiting within the limits of the Borough, \u2014 and 12<2. by those without the Borough. It was at the same time ordered, that the Usher should have a Salary of \u00a3S. per annum, and should also have simdar payments, as the Master, from the Scholars under his care. And that every Scholar, whose friends should refuse to make such payments, or, who should stubbornly resist cor rection, should be displaced by The Governors. On the 12th of August, 1635, these orders were more strictly enjoined, \u2014 The Mayor and Burgesses having observed, \" that many Parents (upon hope to benefit their children more than the generall) have secretly exceeded the rates aforesaid, being the ancient rates settled at the Foundation of The Free School : And finding by"], [581, "Saint Alban's.] HERTFORD. 519 experience that, for that cause, the said Schoolmasters :and Ushers of the said School have applied themselves in their pains and affections much more to the children of such parents than Me generall ; whereby the generall have been much neglected and hindered in their learning (for the good of which generall the School W3as chiefly founded),\" \u2014 they, therefore, for the preven tion of the like inconvenience for the time to come, wisely ordained, \" that if any Parent or Friend of any Schollar or Schollars of the SEune School now being, or hereafter to be admitted into the said School, shall directly or indirectly exceed the said ancient rates to the intents before mentioned, and the same shall be well known or sufficiently proved to the said Maior and Principal Burgesses, or their successors in time to come, that then and from thenceforth the Schollar and Schollars of such Parents and Friends shall he excluded out of the said School, and not to be admitted thither again but at the will and pleasure of the said Maior and Principal Burgesses and their successors, and at and upon the special instance and request of their Parents or Friends to be made to the said Maior and Burgesses, and upon faithfull promise not so again to exceed the said auncient rates.\" At a Court holden at the Council Chamber, on the 9th of April, 1630, \" upon a Petition made in the name of the whole Town,\" for the reformation of some abuses and neglects in the School, and for the establishing of some good order in teaching, that might tend \" to the virtuous and well breeding of young chddren in Learning and Virtue, which it is supposed cannot be well effected without the slid, countenance, and assistance of men of worth, endued with Learning and well effected in Religion,\" they, therefore, thought it fit, \" to name and make choice of some Knights, Gentlemen, and Preachers,\" (Twelve in number) to aid and assist the Mayor and Burgesses, as Visitors, in the govern ment of the School, and in setting down a fit method to be used and practised in teaching in the same, and in making wholesome Laws and Constitutions, \u2014 and appointed the 20th of July, and the 15th of December, as the times of Visitation. This appears to have been a favourite measure, for some of the Visitors being dead and removed, \" whereby for want"], [582, "HERTFORD. [Saint Alban's. 520 of such assistance the said good work is much weakened, and the good intencion of the Maior and Principal Bur gesses made frustrate,\" \u2014 they, therefore, \" for the reviving and in pursuance of so good an order,\" on the 13th of February 1645, ratified the proceedings of the former Court, and \" for the vigorous execucion of the same,\" nominated a similar number of Visitors as before. This \" so good an order \" was again revived, and Visitors nominated, on the 15th of December, 1714. The election of the Masters remains with the Mayor and Aldermen, \u2014 but the government of the School is now vested in the Eight Trustees, whose names are as follow, \u2014 John Harrison, Esq. \"1 Revd. James Carpenter Gape, I A1J ,, __ _, > Aldermen. Mr. William Brown, Mr. John Newball Bacon, The Right Honble. James Walter, Earl of Verulam. William Snell, Esq., of Salisbury Hall, in the Parish of Shenley near St. Alban's. William Smith, Esq., of St. Alban's. John Clarke, Esq., of Sandridge Bury, near St. Alban's. The School itself was formerly part of The Abbey Church, being that portion, designated by the name of \" The Lady Chapel,\" or \" The Chapel of the Virgin,\" and communicated with the Presbytery by three pointed arches. These arches are now filled up with masonry, and this Chapel having been separated from the rest of the Church, by a passage leading to the Market-place, now forms The Grammar School. This separation, it is supposed, took place during the reign of King Edward the Sixth, soon after the Charter was granted to the Inhabitants for the In corporation of the Borough, by which Charter they were empowered to erect a Grammar School \" infra Ecclesiam Sancti Albani.\" But the actual conversion and fitting up of the School did not, probably, commence before the endow-"], [583, "Saint Alban's.] HERTFORD. 521 ment by Queen Elizabeth. This Chapel was originally built by Hugh de Eversden, the Twenty-seventh Abbot, about the year 1314. In this pious work he was assisted by one Reginald, a Clerk of Rome, and by Walter de Langley and Alicia his Wife. It also received great embellishment from the hand of Wheathamsted, who is said to have expended \u00a340. in it s decorations. The roof is supported by groined arches. It is recorded as the place of interment of the Nobility, who were slain in the first battle of St. Alban's, fought between the Houses of York and Lancaster, on the 2.id of May, 1455. It is a spacious building, being upwards of 55 feet in length, 24 feet in breadth, and about 30 feet in height ; and, upon a tablet, are painted Three bunches of Grapes, emblematical of the Three Wine Licenses, with which it is endowed. To the School is attached a small Library, containing good editions of the Classical authors, a few scarce books, and some books in the English language of no great value. To this Library it appears, that Sir Samuel Grimston, Bart , Benjamin Mott, Citizen of London, Joseph Marsh, Esq., Dr. Evans, Stephen Adams, Alderman of this Borough, John Cole, Rector of The Abbey, and Charlhs Hale, Gentlemen, were Benefactors. It appears by The Statutes, that the advantage of a free Education at this School, is not confined to the Inhabitant-. either of any individual Parish, or of the Town in general, or even to the Sons of Freemen of the Borough, but, to the number of One Hundred and Twenty Scholars, it is open to all the World. As a Free Grammar School, the Charters of Foundation require the Master to teach those Scholars the Latin and Greek Classicks only. Although no age is mentioned to qualify a boy for admis sion, yet he is not admissible without a perfect knowledge of his Latin Accidence, and can write \" indifferently.\" The system of Education adopted in the School, has"], [584, "[Saint Alban's, HERTFORD. 522 usually depended upon the discretion of the Head Masters, and has probably Varied, precisely as they may have re ceived their own Education, either at Westminster or at Eton. The late Master, Mr. Nicholson, taught the Westminster Grammars : But now the Eton Grammars only are used ; and a plan of general Instruction is pur sued. It has not been ascertained, that the School possesses any University advantage, in the nature of either Exhibition, or Scholarship. It has been repeatedly stated, that about 50 or 60 years since there existed an Exhibition from this School. But, although the period of time is not very remote, and much inquiry upon the subject has been made, to obtain some certain information, yet it has led to no decisive con clusion. If there ever were such an Endowment, it was pro bably a Rent-charge upon some estate in the neighbourhood, which the Proprietor unworthily feels it his interest not to disclose. The present Head Master is, William Mogo Bowen, D. D., a Member of All Souls College, Oxford, and Vicar of Shipton Bellinger, in the County of Southampton. This worthy Gentleman receives into his House a few private Pupils, who pay for their board Fifty guineas per annum, and Five guineas as an entrance Fee, if under the age of Sixteen, and attend the common business of the School. But, for Pupils above that age, who receive private instruc tion, his terms vary in proportion to their domestick indul gences, advancing upwards from One hundred guineas per annum. In other branches of Learning: different Masters attend to instruct the Scholars ; the number of whom has now, for some years past, fluctuated from 16 to 28.

Upon the death of Mr. Fothergill, the large House in his occupation, be ing private property, was taken down. From the Master ship of Dr. Pheedy to the year 1803, the number of Scholars at any one time seldom exceeded 7 or 8 ; the major part of whom were generally private Pupils of the Head Master. From the time of Mr. Fothergill to the last mentioned period, with the exception of a few months during which Mr. James Preedy was Master, the Mastership of the School and the Rectory of The Abbey Church, which is of small value, have been always united. When the validity of the Charters was questioned, with respect to the power of granting Wine Licenses, the rent of the School Estate was applied with the consent of the Mas ter, to defray the expense of the Law-suit.

As there is no separate residence, allotted to the Master by any endowment, the proximity of the Rectorial House renders a re-union highly desirable. There is no Church Preferment belonging to this School. There is, however, a Lectureship of small value, which was established during the troublesome times of King Charles the First, by Francis Combe, Esq., of Hemel Hempstead, by his Will, bearing date the 12th of December 1640 and 1st of May 1641, and proved at London on the 9th of July 1641.

An attempt has been made, very uncharitably, to impeach the Loyalty of the pious Founder by a singular Tradition of dubious origin, \u2014 namely, that he was in politicks a vio lent Republican, and that actuated by those feelings, he ordered this weekly Sermon to be preached at St. Alban's on the Market-day, with the view of disseminating among the Peasantry of the Country his own dangerous principles. Similar Lectures were established, on the Market-days, by the same Gentleman at the same time, and, it is said, with the same view, in the Towns of Berkhampstead, and Hemel Hempstead.

All that is for the con sideration of the Visitor: if made the subject of com plaint: \u2014 As to the Revenue, it has been decided by The Court, and is quite clear, that, where there is a local Visitor as to the conduct and management of the School, if in the original instrument a Trust is expressed as to the application of the Revenue, this Court has Jurisdiction to compel a due application. The Court has in fact and practice acted upon the ground of such Jurisdic tion : of which there is no doubt : \u2014"], [599, "Bkrkhampstead.] HERTFORD. 537 The Construction that has been given to the Act of Parlia ment and Charter, as to the application of the Revenues of this Foundation, is this, \u2014 confining myself now to the actual appli cation of the Rents previously to the reference directed by Lord Thurlow to the Master, to consider of a Scheme as to the fu ture application, \u2014 but, without adverting to the several orders, it may be represented in a general way, that the Court had approved this sort of distribution of the Revenues of an Estate, let in the way I shall mention : \u2014 The Court has expressed an Opinion, that it has authority to control the power in the Master and Usher of leasing for Three lives or Thirty-one years, if it should appear for the benefit of the Charity not to act upon that power. Under the express terms of the power they are to le:ase, not for their own benefit only, but also in a given proportion/br the benefit of the Poor of the Parish. Some Leases were made for lives, \u2014 some not for lives, \u2014 and until the Master's Report under the reference, direc ted by Lord Thurlow, it was never considered as a plan to be generally acted upon, that all the estates should be let upon leases for Thirty-one years, or lives determinable upon that pe riod, taking large Fines : \u2014 The Court had, however, great difficulty to determine, what was to be done with the Fines, that had been taken, \u2014 but the final distribution of the Revenue has been of this sort. The distribution, contemplated by the Act of Parliament and the Letters Patent, being in proportions, which altogether exhausted the whole, The Court thought, the distribution of the Reve nues, when augmented, must be in the same proportions ; mak ing an addition to the quota of each ; and accordingly, where there were leases upon Fines, or Rents, the distribution, du ally made, W3as two-thirds, without deducting taxes and other outgoings, to the Master and Usher, \u2014 the other third was applied to the charges and outgoings of all the three shares, \u2014 and what remained w:as distributed to the Poor of the Parish : \u2014 Upon an application to Lord Thurlow as to the distribution of some of the Funds, this seems to have struck him as a singu lar management of a Charity estate, \u2014 and there is one material Petition and Order, bringing to the view of the Court this, \u2014 which seems to have been forgotten in the Scheme that had been approved, \u2014 that in consequence of this species of letting, applied very generally, but not universally, when leases were renewed upon Fines, there was something material coming to the Parish, \u2014 that on the other hand, after giving the portion of the annual rents to the Mjister and Usher, free of all deductions, the remaining third for the Poor, after leaving all outgoings upon the whole estate, left nothing to be given to the Poor iii"], [600, "HERTFORD. [Bbrkhampstead. 538 those years, \u2014 the annual charges eating out one-third of the surplus ; so that the Receiver _was obliged to apply to the Court to authorize him to deduct from the other two-thirds the defi ciency of that third to answer those charges, \u2014 aiming at, though not distinctly praying, a Declaration, authorizing some arrange ment, that would give something to the Poor of the Parish, \u2014 forming one of the objects, to receive something annually : \u2014 Lord Thurlow made an Order, directing a Reference to the Master to consider of a better Scheme for letting the Estate. It probably occurred to His Lordship, that this mode of letting operated directly to disappoint one object of the Charity, \u2014 and, that, if it was fit, that these Fines should be taken,as they would probably very largely increase, it should be considered, whether the profit, arising in that shape, should not be made a perman ent Fund, yielding a permanent Revenue for the SchoolmEister and Usher, and their Successors, and, as to one-third, for the Poor, \u2014 probably also thinking this not at all a proper mode of letting a Charity Estate : \u2014 The Report, made in 1792, and approved afterwards by The Lords Commissioners, states the ground upon which the Master went, not only as to the Farms out of lease, but as to all the Estates in future, \u2014 the Leases not being less than Thirty-eight in number, \u2014 and the reasoning would apply equally to the estate of any Tenant in fee, \u2014 that by letting without Fines needy per sons might become Tenants, \u2014 the Tenants being to covenant to repair, and leave in repair : \u2014 The Report proceeds therefore to state, that, as the Leases should expire, all the lands should be let upon Fines at small rents. As a general application, if there were no particular cir cumstances, this reasoning would in the case of an Infant call upon the Court to take the same course, \u2014 as there might be very bad Tenants, who would not do justice to the Farms, \u2014 but the answer to that would be, that good Tenants might be pro cured, who would do them justice : \u2014 Giving credit, however, to the argument, that in the covenant to build upon the estate the Landlord may receive a considera tion for a long lease, if the same lease contains on the Tenant's part a covenant to sustain and leave all those buildings in suffi cient repair, taking that to have been the condition of all these Farms, upon what ground am I to infer, that, though such a lease was necessary in that instance, it was equally necessary afterwards, when that very lease provided, that those circum stances, in consideration of which such peculiar leases were to be made, should not exist, \u2014 and why, if that was proper as to one F'arm, which required expensive buildings, was eveiy Farm, though not under the same circumstances, to be let in the same,"], [601, "Berkhampstead.] HERTFORD. 539 way, \u2014 and again at the expiration of those leases, when no such reason could exist ? \u2014 In 1794 this Report was confirmed, and the Leases directed to be so made, not only then, but in all future time. Afterwards an application was made to Lord Loughborough about the Taxes, \u2014 who would only go the length of giving to the Receiver, what the whole annual Income of the Parish would not pay of those outgoings, which the Receiver was not authorized to take out of the proportions of the Master and Usher : \u2014 The present application arises out of what passed in 1804, and there is difficulty enough upon it, \u2014 not in praying a Reference to the Master to review the Scheme, upon which the Estate is now let, with reference to the future, and to receive a Plan for the better management of the Estate, and distribution of the Revenue, having regard to the proportion of division by the Letters Patent as to the original Income, \u2014 but upon the Proposal for future letting, \u2014and, if the Master's Opinion should be in favour of Fines, as to the application of those Fines either as annual Revenue, or a permanent Fund, subject to the approba tion of the Court : \u2014 The first difficulty is with regard to persons, who, under the authority of the Court, have actually contracted for leases. It would be very difficult to dispossess those, who have become Tenants, or continued Occupation, relying upon the faith of biddings before the Mfister, that they were to have leases. I wish, therefore, to know the nature of their contracts, the par ticular state of each Tenant as to his lease and his money. The Proceedings in this Charity from beginning to end require me to say, that, if the present Scheme and Management are not for the benefit of all the objects of the Charity, it must no longer go on so, \u2014 which is very different from the consideration as to the time past, \u2014 having regard to the expectations of persons, who have been dealing upon the authority of the Court, \u2014 much as I conceive the Court was mistaken in what was done in 1792 :\u2014 I desire, therefore, to have a statement of the respective names of the Bidders, the times of bidding, of confirming the Report, and what was done with the money, whether Fines or Purch:ase Money, at the times of confirming those Biddings, or since : \u2014 Refer it to the Master to consider of a Proposal, with liberty to any party to lay Proposals before the Master, for the future management of the Estate, \u2014 with power to review all the plans, before adopted, \u2014 and, if the Master shall be of opinion, that it is for the benefit of the Charity, that all or any of the lands should hereafter be let upon F'ines, or partly upon Fines, to be"], [602, "540 HERTFORD. [Berkhampstead. at liberty to receive Proposals, and to state his opinion upon them as to the application of those Fines, either as divisible at the time they are paid, or being considered as a permanent Fund for the future interest of the respective objects of the Charity, \u2014 and to state his Opinion upon all these matters, having due re gard to the Letters Patent, the Act of Parliament, and all the subsequent Proceedings of this Court. On the 28th of April, 1814, The Master and Usher pre sented a Petition, stating, that several of the Charity Es tates had lately been let with the approbation of the Master at increased Rents and Fines, the Fines amounting to \u00a34303, \u2014 and insisting, that the Petitioners were entitled, as their Predecessors, to two-thirds of the money, arising from such Fines, in the proportions, as between themselves, of Two-thirds to the Master, and one Third to the Usher. The Petition, farther stating, that the Master had expended considerable sums in substantial repairs and improvements, prayed an account of the money so laid out, and an appli cation of the Fund in the Bank on account of the Fines: viz., Two-thirds to the Petitioners in the proportions before stated : the Costs and Improvements to be paid out of the remaining third : and the surplus to go according to the Act of Edward the Sixth. On the hearing of this Petition, The Lord Chancellor said, \u2014 \" I am satisfied, that the Question, how these Fines for the time past are to be disposed of, has devolved upon me as a consequence of the change of The Great Seal from Lord Thur low to The Lords Commissioners in 1792. Lord Thurlow's Order was calculated to set right the mode of dealing with the estate, which had prevailed : and The Lords Commissioners did not sufficiently attend to the principle, on which Lord Thur low ordered a review of the Application which had been direct ed by Lord Hardvvicke : \u2014 \" The only difficulty I have in this case is upon the point, whether I have any thing more to do with the Fines for the time past than to distribute them according to the existing Trusts, actually attaching upon them.

The Master might as well reside elsewhere as the Usher : but both ought to be, where they will be ready to do the duty, and can do it : and it is impossible to say, they can be as properly employed else where, with reference to the objects of this Foundation, as if they were resident in the place, where that Duty is to be per formed. This is a Royal Foundation under which The Master and Usher are Corporators. As long as they remain so, and the Visitor does not think proper to remove them, they must in a Court of Justice have the enjoyment of all the Revenues, which belong to them by the same instrument, that gives them the Corporate Character. The Question now before me is not as to their conduct, but how the Rents and Profits have been actually 3given to the persons, holding these situations ; and, unless I am to conclude, that from the year 1792 an im proper mode of letting these Estates has prevailed in the Mas ter's office, I do not see my way to refuse Two-Thirds of the profits for the time past, \u2014 having no right to vvithold that, to which they have a present title.\" These honourable sentiments, so clearly and forcibly expressed by The Chancellor, deserve to be made still more public, than by a volume of Reports of Proceedings in The Court, which no one but a Practitioner reads. By those Proceedings it appears, that the original in tention of the Foundation was, that the Chddren of the Town should be there educated, and that the Poor should have the benefit of one-third of the Estate, \u2014 That the Master and Usher being in possession, availed themselves of the power given to them of letting Leases on Fines, the whole of which they converted to their own use, totally ex cluding the Poor from any participation therein, \u2014 That they threw the whole burden of Taxes and Repairs on the one-third designed for the Poor, by which means the whole of the great Rents was converted to their own use, and the third which was designed for the Poor, was wholly swal lowed up by Taxes and Repairs, \u2014 That, at the hearing of this matter in 1813, the Scltool was a complete Sinecure, as"], [604, "542 HERTFORD.

According to the Biographia Britannica, the beneficent Bishop, immediately after his election to the See of Exeter, \" set about repairing the Episcopal Palace, \u2014 augmented the poor Vicarages, \u2014 increased the Prebends, from Four to Twenty pounds a year, \u2014 procured the Deanry of Burien to be annexed to the Bishopric of Exeter, \u2014 and by these acts of Munificence, with m.any instances of his capacity for busi ness, became the most considerable man on the Bishops' bench. In 1667 he was translated to the Bishopric of Salisbury, being elected the 5th and confirmed the 12th of September. He was very acceptable to the chief persons in that Diocese, and obtained great respect and esteem by his extensive charity, and cheerful hospitality. As he had done at Exeter, he caused here the Cathedral, and his own Palace, to be thoroughly repaired, \u2014 the latter at the expense of above \u00a32000.

The Grammar School. The Grammar School in the Town of Hertford was founded by Richard Hale, Esq., of Cheshunt, in the Fourteenth year of the reign of King James the First, 1617. In the Letters Patent, it is expressed to have been \" pro eruditione et instructione Puerorum et Juvenum in Lingua Latind, et alia politiori Literatura.\" It is subsequently named, according to the desire of The Founder, \" The School of Richard Hale, Esq.,\" for the instruction and bringing up of Children and Youth of the Inhabitants of the Town of Hertford in the Latin Tongue, and other Literature. No more precise description occurs of what the Master is bound to teach ; and, it is presumed, according to the practice of Dr. Carr, a former eminent Master, and that of Grammar Schools in general, that English, Writing, and Arithmetic, not being mentioned in any manner whatever in the Sta tutes, were liable to a moderate charge, which Dr. Carr made at Half a guinea per Quarter ; 3and which has pro perly been continued by the present Master, William Do binson, Esq., during a Mastership of somewhat more than Ten years. As there is no limitation, mentioned in the Statutes, of the number of boys to be admitted, it must be obvious that the School, without this small pecuniary restriction, would be altogether insufficient to contain those of every descrip tion, who might apply for admission ; and, consequently, the Master would be so much embarrassed as to be quite"], [610, "HERTFORD.

The Salaries to the Master, and his Assistant, arise from \u00a3800. bequeathed for the purchase of Lands and Tenements to that amount, in the Town and neighbourhood of Hert ford, which purchase was made by Rowland Hale, Esq., a Descendant and Heir of the Founder, and now produces \u00a320. per annum to the Master ; \u00a310. to the Assistant; and \u00a310. more for keeping the premises in due repair. It need scarcely be observed, that such sums at the pre sent time, would be totally inadequate to the maintenance of either the Master or his Assistant ; and, therefore, Boarders are admitted. These Scholars, like the number of those on the Foundation, are unlimited; but are on an average, about Thirty, at Twenty-five or Thirty guineas per annum each. The number of boys upon the Foundation are about Forty ; but, as many of them are taught French (a lan guage not mentioned in the Statutes), and other Literature, an additional half guinea per Quarter is charged ; and all who apply, have admission. The School was undoubtedly intended by The Founder, chiefly for Classical education, being erected at a period when the Commerce of the Country was scarcely to be named with that of the present age. This Classical instruc tion is still continued in the School, but not to that extent, perhaps, originally intended by The Founder; \u2014 Ph\u0153drus, Ovid, Virgil, and sometimes Horace, are read bv the Se nior Boys ; and some have read the Greek Testament, and part of Homer ; though there are none, at present, who are engaged in the latter language, as the Parents think it alto gether unnecessary for boys, chiefly designed for Commer cial situations.

For the same reason also Lord Viscount Melbourne, who has the present appointment to the Mastership, is more inclined to promote Commercial than Classical Learning, as more advantageous to the Inhabitants, being vested with a power \" to add and alter, cliange, disallow, or disannul any of the Statutes, as often as he, or his Assigns, shall think ft or needful, for the good government of the Scltool.\" Ralph Minors, formerly Master, gave to the Parish of All Saints \u00a310. in Trust .

In 1618, Robert Rose, of Bishop' s-bourne, gave 26 acres of Marsh land, in the Parishes of St. Mary and Hope All Saints, in Romney Marsh, for the assistance of Four Scholars, at either University, being such as were in The King's School at Can terbury, of which he had been Usher ;\u2014 -these Exhibitions were to be of the yearly value of \u00a36. each, and to continue for seven years, if the Scholar should remain so long there unpreferred to a Living of \u00a320. per annum above the Exhibitions ; with other restrictions and rules, as mentioned in the Deed of Feoffment. In 1625, William Heyman, of Canterbury, Gentleman, by Indenture, vested 27 acres of Marsh land in the Parish of Ware home, in the County of Kent, inc ertain Feoffees, to apply five parts out of si.v of the rents of those premises upon Two poor Scholars only, to be placed in The King's School at Canter bury, to be nominated by his next heir and the majority of the"], [627, "Canterbury.] KENT. 565 Feoffees ; \u2014 such Scholars to be descended from the body of his Grand-father, Peter Heyman, Esq., or to be natives, or born of such as are natives of Sellinge. The Scholar so to be cho sen, to be full eight years old ; who should hold his Exhibition for nine years, and if he should go to any College in Cambridge, to be continued for seven years from his leaving School : and if he should take Orders in the first five years of the seven, the same to be continued to him for three years more, that is ten in the whole, at the University. In 1643, Henry Robinson, by his Will, gave certain mes suages and lands, called \" Gore End,\" in the Parishes of Bir chington and St. Nicholas, in the Isle of Thanet, to St. John's College in Cambridge, for the founding of Two Fellowships and Two Scholarships, for Two Fellows and Two Scholars, natives of the Isle of Thanet, or in default, of natives of the County of Kent, and brought up at The King's School, in Canterbury. But it being found that the profits of the lands (the estate being then sunk down to \u00a350. per annum) were not sufficient for such a maintenance, it was ordered by a Decree of the Court of Chancery, with consent of The College and the Executors, dated the 26th of November, 1652, That in future Four Scholarships should be established in that College for ever, instead of the original appointment ; and that the profits of the premises should, according to the direction of the Donor in his Will, be employed for ever, towards the maintenance of such Four Scholars only, each of whom is to be allowed by The College, in Commons, \u00a310. a year. In 1656, The Revd. Abraham Colfe, the Founder of the School of Lewisham, among many other noble Benefactions, :gave Seven Exhibitions of \u00a310. per annum each, for Scholars from that School at either University ; \u2014 in default of claimants from Lewisham School, then from the adjacent Hundreds, and from Members of The Company of Leather-sellers, who are Patrons of the School, and possessed of the Estates bequeathed by him. He directed these Exhibitions to be filled up by Scholars from The King's School in Canterbury, and from that in Christ's Hospital in London, alternately. But the Leather-sellers' Company have, for many years past, refused to admit the claim of either, and have totally sunk this t'70. per annum, alleging a failure in their estate. According to Mr. Gostling, this seems somewhat strange, considering that most of the Estates, in the neighbourhood of London, have increased in value wittiin that, time : but how they are empowered to load one branch of Mr Colfe's Charity with the whole failure, does not appear, or that the Schools of Christ's Hospital or Canterbury, have not as just aright to share"], [628, "KENT. [Canterbury. 566 his liberality in the last place, as Lewisham in the first ; especi ally as he assigned this reason, because his Father was educated at Christ's Hospital, and himself born at Canterbury. He cer tainly foresaw what has happened, that Lewisham School might not produce enough to fill all his Exhibitions, and added Two Schools, which he judged might at all times supply it's deficiency. George Thorpe, S.T.P., Prebendary of Canterbury, gave by Will, in 1719, to Emanuel College in Cambridge, certain messu3ages and lands in the Parish of Ash near Sandwich, for the endowment of Five Exhibitions; to enable Bachelors of Arts to reside, until they take their Master's Degree ; \u2014 But should there be none such, others might be elected after two years, from their first residence in College ; such Exhibitioner not to be possessed of an estate of \u00a340. per annum, and his friends to certify their intention of keeping him in College (unless better provided) until he should become Master of Arts, and to declare his inability thus to continue without some such assistance, and that he purposed to make Divinity his study ; \u2014 a preference to be given to the sons of Orthodox Ministers of the Church of England, and of the Diocese of Canterbury, and such as had been brought up in The King's School there. \u2014 These Exhibi tions are never less than\u00a3l4.andsometimes\u00a320.per annum, and may be holden with Scholarships or Exhibitions of otherFounda tions, of which more than Forty belong to that College. In 1736, John Brown, B.D., founded Two Greek Scho larships in Emanuel College, which have generally amounted to \u00a38. per annum clear, to be paid in proportion to residence, :and the remainder to be applied to the general fund of the Col lege. These are to be filled up by The Master and Fellows, by Scholars from The King's School in Canterbury; \u2014 in default from thence, then from any other School in Kent : \u2014 and in default from thence, then from any other School. George Stanhope, S. T. P., Dean of Canterbury, by a Testamentary Schedule, proved in 1728, devised \u00a3250. in New South Sea Annuities, to found One Exhibition of \u00a310. per annum, for one King's Scholar of the School in Christ Church in Canterbury, to be nominated by the Dean, and chosen by him, or the Vice-Dean and Chapter, for Seven years, such Scholar continuing in some College in Cambridge, but to cease at the Michaelmas after his commencing Master of Arts. This principal sum of \u00a3250. was transferred by the Dean's Executors to, and accepted by The Dean and Chapter of Can terbury ; \u2014 the reduction of Interest having made an alteration in the annual value, and the Exhibition having been vacant for some years, with that accumulated amount, and a contri bution from The Dean and Chapter, the sum of \u00a350. more Stock"], [629, "Canterbury.] KENT. 567 was purchased ; \u2014 so that the Exhibition is now worth \u00a39. per annum. There are Two Masters, who have each a small Stipend from the Revenues of The Cathedral Church, and a House. The present Head Master is, The Revd. John Birt, M. A., of Christ Church College, Oxford, who was unani mously elected in June 1816, on account of the high cha racter which was given of him by the present Bishops of St. Asaph and Hereford, the Deans of Hereford and Glou cester, and other Gendemen of Learning and Respectabdity ; and \" he has shown himself well fitted for the office, which he fills.\" This Gendeman takes Boarders at Forty-five 3guineas per annum each : And there is every prospect of the School attaining it's former celebrity, as, since his Election, the number of Pupds has increased from 26 to 70. Of the Masters who have presided over this School, maDy of them have been men of Eminence, as Clergymen and Scholars; especially the late Revd. Dr. Osmund Beau voir, first educated here, and afterwards of St. John's Col lege in Cambridge, \u2014 whose great abdities brought this School to the highest degree of estimation. He died in 1789, and was buried in the South Aisle of the Nave of The Abbey Church of Bath. There are no Church Preferments, nor other advantages, belon^ng to the Master of this School. The Scholars educated at this School have been, in gener al, of the very best Families of the County of Kent : many of whom, from the deep Learning which they imbibed here, have been Ornaments to the several Professions into which they entered.

This was refu sed under various pretences ; upon which a plain Case was laid before an eminent Chancery Council whose Opinion is, that the Master is legally entitled to the rents of the said Salts. On this Opinion being repeatedly declared to the Trustees, and their final answer requested, they have come, at length, to a resolution to restore the rents, from the present time, to the Master, pro vided a Common Assembly of The Corporation of Sandwich shall sanction such resolve of the Court, i. e., of The Mayor and Jurats. c These 90 acres were leased for 500 years by Sir Roger Manwood to his own Family, subject to an annual rent-charge of \u00a320.

But, Sir John Manwood, Knight, his son and heir, or >jthers claiming under him, took the issues of the said estates to their own use, without making any payment to the Master.

Whereupon a writ of execution followed, dated the 6th of May, 1634. But, Sir John Manwood and Lady Frances Manwood, Widow, put exceptions into the Court of Chancery against the decree of the Commissioners ; upon these grounds, principally, that Sir Roger Manwood intended to the School only Twenty Pounds a year for the School-master ; and that, before the making of the feoffment to the Mayor and Jurats, he did make a lease of the lands, mentioned therein, for the term of 500 years to Edward Peke and William Claybroke; reserv ing only the yearly rent of Twenty pounds, to be paid to the said Mayor and Jurats and their Successors, for the main tenance of the said Master : which lease was afterwards, viz., on the 10th of January, 1571, lawfully assigned back again to the said Roger Manwood, his executors and assigns ; who, by his Will, disposed of all his leases in Kent to his heirs for the time being, who should have his house at St. Steplieris. In June, 1635, the matter was argued before the Lord Keeper, who confirmed the decree of the Commissioners, as to the arrears of the Stipend, and the Forty pounds damages; and, in favour to Sir John Manwood, he directed that the same should be paid by Sir John Manwood to the Mayor and Jurats of Sandwich, on behalf of the Master, by Thirty pounds per annum, over and above the said Twenty pounds per annum;1 but the other part of the Commissioners' 1 This is not now done.

Edmund Parbo, Esq., by his Will, dated the 26lh of October, 1640, besides many other legacies to the Parishes in Sandwich, bequeathed to The Mayor and Jurats of Sand wich, Governors of The Grammar School, an annuity of Ten Pounds out of his messuage or inn, called The Pelican, in Sandwich. But, it does not appear, that the School was ever benefited by this bequest, nor how it happened, that it was not so. There is reason to think, that a Suit was insti tuted, after the death of Mr. Parbo's widow, by The Mayor and Jurats against the heirs of Mr. Parbo, for the recovery of this benefaction, in The Court of Chancery at Dover; where the proceedings or issue may probably be ascertained. In the hands of The Mayor and Jurats is a deed, bearing date the 5th of January, 1685, which declares the uses of a Pine, levied of a piece of :ground divided into two parts, whereon are erected two stables, one kitchen and one cove, situate in St. M3ary's Parish Sandwich, abutting to a tene ment beloniging to the Free Grammar School and Black Lane, West ; to Strand Street, North ; to the messuage and malt-house of the heirs of John Does, East and South ; purchased by The Mayor and Jurats of William Ellwood, late of Sandwich, Gentleman, deceased, and Phineas Ellwood, i>ay to the Mayor and Jurats of Sandwich \u00a330., above the rent charge of \u00a320., that is, \u00a350. for the use of the Master.

But, it appeared to the Commissioners, that the School had never been in possession ; that the houses, supposed to have been given, were quite down ; and that there was at that time no such Street, as Thompson's Street. To this account, taken from Tanner's manuscripts, the following extraordinary remark is subjoined : That, \" both in Sandwich, and in Faversham, they acquaint us, that there have been former Commissions, but without fruit ; for, that no one dares urge the execution of the orders, by reason of their Bye -laws in The Cinque Ports .\"w From whence it appears, that nothing came of the inquiry. u No payment is now made to the Master for this estate. w In the present improved mode of administering the Laws of the Realm, it cannot be apprehended that any obstacle to right and justice can arise from such Bye-laws.

One injunction, on a point of higher moment, he judged fit to be added, that all the Scholars, upon the Sabbath and Holidays, should resort in due time to Divine Service in the Parish Church, attended by the Master or Usher, one or both. Among other matters contained in the Statutes, it is ordained, that the Master of the School shall be a Master of Arts, if it may be, and that the Usher shall be chosen by him ; and that the Master shall have authority to reject such as apply for gratis instruction, or Day boys, unless they can write competently, and read Latin and English perfectly. Disputes having arisen concerning the extent of the Free dom of the School, in 1693, an Appeal was made from The Town of Tunbridge to The Skinners' Company, who there upon limited it's Freedom according to the words of the Charter to the emolument, \" Juvenum in villa et patria adj'acenti,\" of the boys inhabiting the Town and adjacent country; and this, according to the opinion of the late Lord Chancellor Yorke, was a very fair and reasonable construction. Notwithstanding which, another warm dispute upon this subject arose again in 1764 ; when, after consulting the most learned Counsel, viz., Yoeke, Norton, De Grey, Black stone, and Hussey, it was resolved at a Court holden by The Skinners at their Hall, on the 24th of January, 1765, that the Children of the Town and Parish of Tunbridge, who could write competently and read Latin and English perfectly, should be instructed on proper application to the Master, without payment of any consideration, excepting the Statutable entrance money ; but Judge Blackstone was of"], [691, "Tunbridge.] KENT. 629 opinion, that The College of All Souls ought to have been consulted. The greatest Benefactor to this School, next to The Founder, was Sir Thomas Smith, Knight, who bequeathed lands to The Skinners' Company in Trust, among other purposes, to pay to the Master of this School \u00a310. per annum; \u2014 to the Usher of it \u00a35.; \u2014 to Six Scholars to be elected to the University from it, \u00a360. per annum ; \u2014 to The Skinners' Company towards the expense of their Annual Visitations, \u00a36.. 13. .4. per annum; \u2014 and .also the sum of \u00a324. per annum, to buy a piece of cloth, to be distributed to 24 poor persons, one piece of it to each of them, at the Annual Visitation. The original School building extends in front upwards of 100 feet in length. It is constructed in a plain, but neat and uniform style, with the sand-stone of the neighbouring country. Behind it, there is a considerable addition to the Master's habitation, erected by The Skinners' Company in 1676, together with a Hall or Refectory, for the use of the Scholars ; and a small, yet elegant Library built at the joint expense of the Patrons of the School, and of The Revd. James Cawthorn, Master, who died on the 15th of April, 1761. There are also detached offices, a garden, and a play ground belon3ging to it. There are several Exhibitions appropriated to this School, besides those of Sir Thomas Smith, which were to be paid in portions of \u00a310. a year each, for seven years, to Six poor Scholars, who should go immediately from hence to either of The Universities. In 1562, Henry Fishee, Fishmonger, of London, and Executor of Sir Andrew Judde, endowed an Exhibition at Brasen-Nose College, Oxford, for a Scholar to be elected by The Skinners' Company from this School. Mr. Lewis endowed an Exhibition for one Scholar, going from hence to Cambridge."], [692, "KENT. [TUNBRIDEG. 630 In 1620, Sir James Lancaster, Knight, endowed Four Exhibitions, for such Scholars as should go to either of the Universities. Mr. Worrall gave Two Exhibitions of \u00a36. a year each to Scholars, who should have spent two full years in the Upper Class of this School. The Will directs, that the person chosen by The Skinners' Company to one of their own Exhibitions, may also enjoy one of these,\u2014 or if there should be any one Scholar recommended by the Master, as qualified in an eminent degree above others, he may enjoy both Mr. Worrall's Exhibitions as they fall, if the Head and Senior Fellows of the College signify their concurrence. Thomas Lampard gave an Exhibition of Four marcs, to be paid quarterly to a Scholar of Tunbridge School. Robert Holmedon bequeathed by his Will \u00a34. a year in the disposal of The Leathersellers' Company, to be given to a Scholar of this School on failure of a claimant from another School, at the time of vacancy. Sir Thomas White directed by his last Will, that in the choice of a Bible Clerk, or \u00c6dituus of his College of Saint John in Oxford, a preference should be given to the Candi dates educated at either of the Schools which supply that College, of which Tunbridge is one. (See, Reading.) The Salary and emoluments are \u00a330. per annum, and it may be holden with any of the above-mentioned Exhibitions. Sir Thomas White was Lord Mayor of London in the year 1554, and of The Merchant Taylors' Company. His Charities were most liberal and extensive. He w^ an intimate friend of Sir Andrew Judde, and \" propter exi mium amorem in eum,\" as the Statutes of his College of St. John inform us, gave one of his Fellowships to Tunbridge School, which was founded but a very short time before that College. The Probationary, Fellow, or Scholar, when nomi nated, must be sent immediately from the School, that is, he must not have left the School before the vacancy ; for the"], [693, "Tunbridge.] KENT. 631 Statute expressly says, that the Electors \" ex suis Scholis mittendos curent? \u2014 The Statutes direct, that the nomination of the Fellow shall be made by the \" Pr\u00e6tor es vel Seniores\" of the several Corporate Towns from which Fellows are sent to St. John's College ; but as Tunbridge is not a Corpo ration, nor either Mayors or Aldermen or any such, who answer the above description, in it, there have been great debates to whom the Election properly belongs. The nomi nation has alwavs hitherto been signed by the Master and a few of the Principd Inhabitants of the Town, and the College has invariably admitted it's validity, though Oppon ents have more than once endeavoured to set it aside. In the event of Two Scholarships in Jesus College, Cambridge, founded by Lady Margaret Boswell, not being filled from the School at Seven-Oaks, they are then to be supplied from this School. See, Seven -Oaks. Mr. John Strong left by Will a sum of money in Trust, for the apprenticing to some marine business, a Scholar, educated \" at the great School at Tunbridge ;\" but it does not appear, that this bequest has ever been claimed by any Scholar of this School. This School continues under the management of The Company of Skinners, who, in pursuance of the Statutes, visit it annually in the month of May. They are attended, as the Statutes direct, by a very respectable Clergyman of London, whose business it is to examine the several Classes of the School. On the arrival of the Company at the gates of the School, a Congratulatory Oration in Latin is spoken by the Head Boy. The Company then proceed to Church, where they distribute bread, money, and cloaths to a number of poor persons of the Parishes of Tunbridge, Bidborough, and Speldhurst, according to the Will of Sir 1 homas Smith.

At Five o'Clock they return to the School, and the Gramma tical Disputations, a very antient exercise, are commenced by the Six Senior Scholars. These exercises conclude with the repetition of English or Latin verses. The Examiner then distributes, according to the Statutes, as an Honorary reward, a silver Pen gilt, to each of the Six Senior Scholars, who on that day walk in procession to the Church, before their Patrons, with garlands of fresh flowers on their heads.

John Kempe, Archbishop of Canterbury and Cardinal of the Church of Rome, intending his College of Wye for the instruction of Youth in the knowledge of Grammar, as well as for the Celebration of Divine Service, took special care in the Statutes which he made for the government of of it, that this part of his intention should have it's proper effect. In it all Scholars were to be taught gratis, both rich and poor, in the art of Grammar ; unless a present was voluntarily made, and except the usual offerings of Cocks and Pence, at the Feast of St. Niclwhis. In this situation the School remained at the Dissolution of The College, in the Thirty-sixth of King Henry the Eighth, 1545, when both of them were suppressed, and became part of the possessions of the Crown. The King, however, took some care for the revival of the School ; for in his Grant, on the 15th of March following of the same year, of the Rectories and Churches of Bocton Aluph, Brenset, and Newington, and the Advowsonsof the Vicarages of them, and the Vicarage of Wye, parcel of the possessions of the late College here, to Walter Bucleb, Esq., Secretary to Queen Catherine, and his Heirs, there was a proviso, among other things, that he, Walter Bucler, and his Heirs, should at all times provide and maintain a sufficient Schoolmaster, capa- ble of teaching boys and youth in the art of Grammar, without fee or reward, in this Parish : \u2014 And he was to pay him, out of the Revenues of these premises, the Salary of \u00a313. .6 .8. yearly, by even portions at Lady-day and Michaelmas, or within one month after. \u2014 But he neglecting to perform these conditions, the School continued unprovided for, and his Grant became for- feited on that account to the Crown, in consequence of a Com- mission of Inquiry, taken in the year 1593, for that purpose. After which, Robert Maxwell preferred a Petition to King James the First, to grant him such an Estate in the premises as Walter Bucler before had, and offering to pay of his own accord, to the Schoolmaster of Wye, 40 marcs, instead of 20"], [696, "KENT [Wye, 634 formerly paid. But on a reference to the Attorney and Solici tor General, they advised that no Grant should be made on so slender a Petition ; but that a new Commission should be had, and Inquisition taken, concerning these premises, which was accordingly taken in the year 1625 ; whereby it was found, that Walter Bucler had not fulfilled the conditions of his Grant, by which the Crown was entitled to resume the same again : \u2014 And the Attorney and Solicitor General certified to the King, that upon that just and lawful process, there was nothing to hinder his intention towards the said Robert Maxwell from taking effect, according to his Petition, and a warrant was accordingly made out for that purpose, which the King's death prevented from being carried into execution. Whereupon King Charles the First, in the second year of his reign, \\617, granted all the said premises to Robert Max well, Esq., and his heirs for ever, to hold the same by the like tenure as before granted, at the yearly rent of \u00a310. : provided that he and his heirs should provide and maintain at Wye a Schoolmaster, sufficiently learned in Grammar to teach, as he fore mentioned, and pay to the said Master \u00a316. Sterling yearly, at Lady-day and Michaelmas, or within one month after each Feast, if it was demanded. And His Majesty, by his Letters Patent dated the 28th of May, 16-iO, made a new Graunt, taking no notice of the former Grant to Walter Bucler, or of his forfeiture of them, only in consideration of the service performed to him by the said Ro bert Maxwell, he granted the same premises to him and his heirs, at the like rent, with re-entry and penalty on non-pay ment ; \u2014 and he agreed to provide and maintain a Schoolmaster, as in the former Grant, and to pay him yearly \u00a316. per annum, at Michaelmas and Lady-day ; and that if the same was not paid in the whole or in part, within 30 days after each of the said Feasts, he and they should forfeit \u00a34. over and above the said half-yearly payments, and so for every month after, so long as the same should continue unpaid, with the usual power of distress, &c. This Salary continues to be paid to the Master by the posses sor of The Vicarage of Wye, but the clear annual amount is under \u00a313., as the Land-tax is always deducted out of it. Sir George Wheler, Knight, Prebendary of Durham, who died in 1724, by a Codicil to his Will, gave the scite and buddings of The College of Wye to The Master of The Grammar School there, and to The Master and Mistress of The Lady Joanna Thornhill's Charity School,"], [697, "Wye.] KENT 635 and their Successors for ever, Masters and Mistresses of the same, for their Habitations ; and also lands and tene ments adjoining and belonging to it, to the value of \u00a314. per annum, for keeping the buildings in repair.

The Grammar School of Cartmel does not appear from the Records of the Parish, to have been founded by any particular Person, or at any stated Period; or to have been originally a Free School, bnt merely a Parochial Se minary under the authority and superintendance of The Churchwardens and Sidesmen of the Parish. For a series of years they hired a Master and paid his Salary from the Interest of small sums of money left by Will, at various periods, for that purpose, or to the Parish for pious uses, which was made up to the sum agreed for by a small Quarterage paid by all who sent Children, except the Poor, to whom the School was fret. Hence it might take the name of a Free Scuool, for in 1619 it was agreed by the Churchwardens and Sidesmen in Vestry assembled, that Land, not to exceed the value of \u00a320., should be purchased with the School stock for the use of The Free School ; no Land, however, was purchased until the year 1680, when \u00a3131..10..0. were judiciously ex pended for that purpose. In 1635, a Master is stated in the Parish-book to have been hired at the ancient wages, and who was also to have 6d. a Quarter for Grammarians, and 4d. for Petties (little ones), as they are so called. Pettetes occurs in the Statutes ofEwelme. In 1664, the Master's Stipend was \u00a320.\u2014 and if the Interest of the School Stock, together with the Quarterage at the rate above mentioned, exceeded that sum, the sur plus was then to be applied in part payment of the Usher's Salary. In 1674, the Quarterage was raised, by order ofthe Ves-"], [708, "LANCASTER. [Cartmel. 646 try, from 6d. to 8d. for Grammarians, but remained at 4d. for Petties. In l7H>an election took place, when it was agreed that the Master should have for his Stipend the rents of the lands which were purchased in 1680, together with the Interest of the School Stock not expended and Quarterage, which was then raised to \\s..6d. for Latin, and 1*. for Eng lish, but the poor Children to be ta.ug?\\t free as before. At a subsequent Election, in 17 14, no stipulated sum is mentioned ; the Master is to have the whole Salary of the School, allowing to his Usher \u00a33. per annum, out of the same. Nothing is said of Quarterage, which appears to have now ceased ; the Rents of the lands and the Interest of the money remaining, being deemed sufficient for the support ofthe Master. Every future election is entirely unconditional. There are no stipulations in regard to the Children of the Poor, nor are the instructions of the Master confined to the Children of the Parish, \u2014 but boys are admitted from every part of the Kingdom, and even now from The West Indies. In 1689, Mr. Henry Bigland, then a Citizen of Lon don, but of an Ancient Family in this Parish, gave by Will \u00a3400. to be invested in land at the discretion of the Twen ty-Four Sidesmen : and with which a purchase was made in 1692. The whole of the Endowments, except \u00a340., are now in land, situate near Cartmel Church-Town. There are no Statutes. But it appears from the Parish- Book that, in 1671, \" Two Deeds in Parchment and one in Paper, concerning The Grammar School, were delivered to the safe keeping of Thomas Askew.\" And, in 1679, it is ordered by The Vestry, that \" a new Deed of Trust of the School be made.\" Two only of the Feoffees named in"], [709, "Cartmel.] LANCASTER. 647 the old Deed being then living. None of these Documents can now be found. The School is open to the boys of the Parish indefinitely, as soon as they can read The New Testament in English ; and they may remain, if their Parents think proper, until they have finished their education. It is customary for persons of property, who have children at the School, to make a compliment to the Master at Shrovetide of a sum, called \" Cock-pence.\" \u2014 \" This cannot be demanded of right? But a charge, per Quarter, is made upon the Pa rents of those Children who write or cypher, the Poor not excepted. The Westminster Grammars are used ; but it is now more a School for educating boys for Trade and Commerce, than for Classical Learning. The inscription upon the Monument of Thomas Pres ton, Esq , who died in 1696, states the following Exhibi tion,\u2014\" Ecclesi\u00e6 pauperibus et pauperum filiis in Schola Cartmellensi Collegioque Sti.

The boys are usually boarded with some respectable family in or near the Village, and have every necessary comfort and accommodation at Twenty-two guineas a year, includ ing washing, mending of Stockings, &c.

Thomas Sandys, Curate of St. Martin's in The Fields, and Lectu rer of St. James's Westnunster, by his Will of that date, gave a good Collection of Books to the School. To this collection considerable additions have been made, at differ ent times, by young Gentlemen admitted at Cambridge fyora hence. The Scholars are allowed the use of these Books, by paying about 5*. yearly; which money is judi ciously expended in the purchase of new Publications. In 1816, The Revd.

The Free School is mentioned in some books belonging to The Corporation, so early as the year 1495 ; and they appear to have repaired it, at different periods, out of their Re venues. It was in great decay in 1683, when James Pilkington, Bishop of Durham, and The Corporation, subscribed liber- ally, and with the assistance of other benevolent Individuals in the Town and Neighbourhood, raised a sufficient sum of money to rebuild the School, which is capable of holding One Hundred and Twenty boys with ease. It consists of two Stories. The Upper Story is appropriated to the Master, who teaches writing and arithmetic: and The Lower one to the Head Master, and Usher. There is also a Room allotted to a Library, in which there are now about 300 volumes, consisting of Divinity, History, British Clas- sics, &c. : this Library was originally established by The Corporation; but, of late years, considerable additions have been made by the laudable example of young Gentlemen, who could afford it, making a donation of an useful book or a set of books, on leaving the School. The Usher has the charge of the Library. Since about the year 1600, The Corporation have appro priated the Rent of a piece of ground in the Town for the increase of The Usher's Salary ; which had most probably"], [728, "[Lancaster. LANCASTER. 666 been granted originally to them by some Duke of Lancaster, for in the year 1415, King Henry the Fifth, or his officers, brought a Quo Warranto against The Corporation to try by what I itle they held it, and they proved a Grant of it which was allowed, but the Proceedings are so injured by time, that it is not now legible by whom the Grant was originally made. This ground was formerly called \" The Deep Carr,\" but for many years past *' The Usher's Meadow ;\" it contains about two acres, and is now let for \u00a3 1 4. per annum. In the year 1615, Randal Carter, a Tallow Chandler, in the Parish of St. Saviour, South wark, charged certain Houses in White-Cross Street, London, by his Will, with \u00a310. per annum for ever, to be paid to The Usher of Lan caster Free School, where he had been educated. This \u00a310. per annum was paid until within about Twelve years past ; since then it has been discontinued, and cannot be recovered, as it is said the property on which it is charged, cannot be identified. Mr. Carter also left \u00a310. or \u00a320. per annum, out of the same estate, to The Free School of Saint Saviour, and which the Trustees thereof have been unable to recover for the same reason. The Corporation of Lancaster have ever since liberally paid The Usher \u00a310. per annum in lieu of that which was bequeathed by Mr. Carter. The following are the Rules and Regulations of The School : \u2014 Lancaster, 25th Feby. 1802. Rules and Regulations hereafter to be punctually observed in the Free Grammar School within the Borough of Lan- caster, being under the Patronage of The Corporation of Lancaster, viz., 1st, That the School shall be open to any Boy, who is able to read English pretty well. 2nd, That both the Masters shall teach Latin and English promiscuously as they shall be requested; the former to be taught grammatically, as well as the latter. 3d, That Seven shillings and Sixpence be paid for every son of a Non-Freeman. 4th, That the Scholars shall be divided between the two Mas-"], [729, "Lancaster.] LANCASTER. 667 ters, in such proportions as may be most proper and agreed upon between them. 5th, That the School be ranged into Classes, and th.at every new Scholar take his place, according to his progress in learn ing, abilities, &c 6th, That the Masters shall exchange sides on Tuesday in every week, and that Friday in every week be set apart for hear ing over what they have said on preceding Days, and every Saturday forenoon for the repetition and application of Gram mar. 7th, That the School hours during Summer (viz., from the first day of April to the first day of October) shall be from Six in the Morning until Eight in the Morning, from Nine in the Morning till Twelve at Noon, and from Two to Five in the After noon : And in the Winter, from Eight to Twelve in the Fore noon, and from One to Four in the Afternoon. And that Prayers be read (:as heretofore hath been accustomed) every morning, the first thing so soon as both Masters are present ; and it is expected, that they will be punctual in their attendance. 8th, That Perquisites, called Cock-pennies shall be given to the Masters at Shrovetide only ; and since there is no Quarter age at all paid by Freemen's children, and only a small one by Non-freemen's, it is hoped these circumstances will be then con sidered, and also at the entrance of every new Scholar. 9th, That the Cock-pennies shall in future be divided between the Masters in manner following, that is to say, seven twelfths thereof to the High Master, and five twelfths thereof to the Usher. 10th, That the vacation times be a week at Shrovetide, a week at Easter, three weeks at Whitsuntide, and a month at Christ mas, besides the usual Saints Days, and every Thursday and Saturday Afternoon. 1 1th, That some part of each Saint Day, and other times occa sionally, be set apart for the instructing the Scholars in the Church Catechism, Morality, and the Principles of the Christian Religion.

The Sons of Freemen of the Borough, whether they re side in or out of the Borough, pay nothing for their Educa tion, except that the Gratuity, called a \" Cock-penny,\" is expected to be given at Shrovetide.

All bovs pay 5*. on Entrance, which is divided between the two M<osters equally. The average number of boys, during the last seven years, has been about Sixty-five ; about Forty of whom are taught by the Usher. The Scholars are of a mixed sort : the sons of Merchants and Tradesmen of the Town forming a considerable Majority. They stay in the School as long as their Parents please to allow them. The Eton Latin and Greek Grammars are used: and the System of Education is the same as is followed in other great Schools ; with the addition of English Grammar, History, and Geography.

But, by an Act of Parliament passed in 1785, which re cites the custom, and that divers Suits had been commenced and Decrees obtained in confirmation of it, the Inhabitants were discharged from the obligation of grinding their Corn and Grain, except Malt, at \" The School Mills ,\" and the same discharge was confirmed, and put under certain regu lations.* * During the dispute in 1737, the following Epigram was written by Mr. Byrom, \u2014"], [746, "LANCASTER.

According to the Act of 1785, it grinds all the Malt, which is used in the Township of Man chester, \u2014 the Inhabitants being obliged to send it there for that purpose, paying 1*. per load of Six bushels. This sum having been fixed at a time, when money was much more valuable than it is at present, now bears no pro portion to the labour effected ; so that the Mill, originally intended to be of benefit to the School only, is now of far greater consequence to the Inhabitants of the Town. It is this Tax upon grinding Malt, however, which has induced the Public Brewers to settle themselves in the adjoining Townships of Salford, Chetham, Ardwick, Chorlton Row, and Hulme ; none of the Breweries being actually situate in Manchester. In addition to the Endowment it is said, that Martin Beron, a Clothier, who realized a large property in Man chester, left a considerable sum towards the erection of The Free School.

The present School, which was erected in the years 1776 and 1777, upon the old foundations, is situate near The"], [749, "Manchester.] LANCASTER. 687 College Gates, in Long Mitigate. It is a plain brick building, with a large stone Medallion in front, upon which is carved in alto relievo, an Owl, the Crest of The Found er, whose Arms are placed at one end of The Upper School-room, which is 96 feet in length, and 30 feet in breadth. It contains sour fire-places, \u2014 is extremely well lighted by 26 large windows, \u2014 and is furnished with desks and seats, that bear evident marks of long service, by the numberless initials of names which succeeding boys have carved upon them. The Ceiling of this room is between 20 and 30 feet hi3gh, \u2014 a circumstance greatly favourable to the health of the Masters and the Scholars. This room is appropriated solely to instruction in the higher Classics. The number of Scholars in it has for the last ten years been about 140, after the annual Remove. The Lower School is literally lower, \u2014 being under a part of the former, and about half it's size. English, and the first rudiments of Latin, are taught in this School ; and the boys are prepared in it for their reception into The Upper School. Before the establishment of the Nati onal and the Lancasterian Schools in Manchester, there were frequently 10 or 80 pupils in this room : but at present the number is between 30 and 40. The Eton Latin and Greek Grammars are used ; but the system of Education is not in all respects simdar to that of Eton College. This School is remarkably rich in it's University ad vantages. There are Eleven Exhibitions for Scholars from this School at any College in either of the Universities, of \u00a340. a year each, which are paid from the School estate ; and such of them as enter at Brasen-Nose College, Oxford, or St. John's College, Cambridge, have always a good chance of obtaining other valuable appointments.

The igreat celebrity which this School hath justly acquired, has been owing not only to the Splendour of the Foundation, but in a still greater degree, to the talents and assiduity of The High Masters, in whom it has been singularly for tunate. The present High Master is Jeremiah Smith, D. D., under whose able management the School preserves the reputation, which it has long so deservedly enjoyed. This Gentleman was appointed, on the death ofthe late Charles Lawson, M. A., who, after filling the Chair for more than Forty-three Years, with the greatest credit to himself, and the advantage of his Pupils, many of whom became shining Luminaries ofthe Pulpit, the Bar, and the Senate, died on the 19th of April, 1807, in the 79th year of his age. The Salary of the High Master is \u00a3420. per annum, with a good House, free of rent and taxes, and kept in good repair. This house, it appears, was bought from the family ofthe Bessicks in Salford by the Trustees, in 1698, for the use of The High Master. His accommodations for"], [760, "LANCASTER. 698 [Manchester Boarders are very extensive, but at present he receives only a limited number, upon the following Terms : \u2014 Entrance Fee, Four guineas.

Washing, Four guineas per annum. French, Drawing, Dancing, &c., on the usud terms. Two Parlour Boarders may be accommodated, \u2014 for whose Board and Tuition 120 or 140 guineas each will be charged, according to the distinction of age stated above. An Assistant Master resides constandy in the house to give instructions in Writing, Accompts, and Mathe- matics, on the Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday Af- ternoons, and to assist in the general Superintendence of the Boarders.

In addition to these Gentlemen whose Official situations are recognized and established in the Statutes, there are also Three Assistant Masters, who have been added by the Trustees, \u2014 have Salaries from the School estate, \u2014 and are liberally allowed by The High Master to take Boarders.* The First Assistant Master is, The Revd.

The Free Grammar School at Middleton was founded, by Charter dated the 11th of August, 1572, by Alexan der Nowell, D. D., Dean of St. Paul's, London ; who, at the same time founded Thirteen Scholarships in Brasen- Nose College, Oxford, of which he was Principal. As these Benefactions were both of them established by Royal Patent, he chose that the School should be caded \" Queen Elizabeth's School,\" and the Scholars \" Queen Elizabeth's Scholars.\" Her Majesty having most gra ciously given \u00a320. yearly for ever towards it's endowment ; of which \u00a314..10..0. per annum are now paid to The Head Master by The College, and \u00a35..10..8. out of the Land Revenue of the Crown. How much he had this good work at heart, for the encou- ragement of Religion and Learning, appears by a Letter of his to the Lord Treasurer Burghley, dated the 24th of June, 1572, while the Patent of Foundation laid in his hands ; in which, by the advice of Sir Walter Mildmay, a blank was left for the Mortmain, upon good hope, that it would please Her Majesty to license a large sum, for such goodly uses. He, therefore, \" in Her Majesty's name hum- bly prayed His Honour to finish the good work, which he had so happily be:gun ; and to move Her Majesty to license the sum of \u00a3100., or so many marks at the least, by him and others to be purchased in Mortmain, for the increase of the Stipends of the Schoolmaster and Usher, and of the number and exhibition of the said Scholars, and the better relief of the great Company of that poor College ; and all to be done in Her Majesty's name.\" Mr Archdeacon Chueton, in his Life of Dean Nowell, vol. 1. Z z"], [768, "LANCASTER. [Middleton. 706 observes, that, by the Charter of Foundation, certain Rent charges, in London and elsewhere, are vested in The Prin cipal and Fellows of Brasen-Nose College, who are Incorporated Governors of this Free School, on condition that they pay to The Upper Master Twenty marks, and to The Under Master or Usher Ten marks, yearly ; and Five marks a piece to Thirteen Scholars, chosen from this School, or from the School of Whalley, or Burnley, or, in defect, from any other School in the County Palatine of Lancaster. But the liberal Donor having shortly afterwards bought of Sir Henry Cheney, Lord Cheney, and the Lady Jane, his Wife, the Manor of Upberry, and the Rectory of Gil lingham in Kent, with the Advowson of the Vicarage, he bestowed these Estates also on the College, in Trust, to augment the Stipend of the Master and Usher, and the allowance of the Scholars, as well as to improve the weekly Commons or Allowance of The Principal and Fellows. The Manor of Gillingham and the Estates thereto append ant were part of the Endowment of the See of Canter bury in the time of The Conqueror, as appears by certain grants of Archbishop Anselm, remitting to the Monks of St. Andrew's in Rochester part of the Rent, which they used to pay for the right of fishing in the sea, a Privilege belonging to the said Manor. The Archiepiscopal Estates in the Parish of Gillingham were alienated to the Crown in the time of Henry the Eighth ; and by him granted to the Famdy of Cheney, who re-sold them to Nowell. A part of the Estate, on a commanding spot in Upberry, by recent purchase from The College of Brasen-Nose, has been re-invested in The Crown, for the purpose of con structing Barracks and other Public Works, \" in these days when the proud menaces of a neighbouring Usurper have served only to rouse, with redoubled ardour, the ancient spirit of Britons.\""], [769, "Middleton.] LANCASTER. 707 There is also belonging to The Head Master a small Field in which the School is situate, being about One acre of customary measure. A Stipend of \u00a3 10. per annum is also paid to The Under or English Master by Brasen-Nose College : The Principal and Senior Fellows whereof appoint the Masters : And they are likewise the Visitors. There are no Statutes or Ordinances. The School has always been open to Boys of the Parish of Middleton, free of expense, when taught the Classics only. But for many years past, a Commercial Education, particularly in this manufacturing part of the Country, has been preferred ; and consequently more attended to, for which 6s. Quarterage for each boy is paid, otherwise the Salary being so small, the School might remain without a Master. There is no particular form of Admission, nor routine of Education prescribed. The Scholarships at Brasen-Nose College are so very small, that they have not been claimed, for a Century past, by any Scholar from Middleton School. In later days the Master's place has usually been given to the Curates of Middleton ; one of whom, Richard Dean, was the Author of an ingenious Essay on an unpro mising subject, \" The future Life of Brutes, introduced with Observations upon Evil, it's nature and origin,\" print ed at Manchester, in 1767. Mr. Dean died and was buried at Middleton, on the 10th of January, 1778. He was succeeded by The Revd. James Archer, the present Head Master, who has filled that Office, with the greatest respectability, for the last Thirty-nine Years ; during which time he has been constant and regular in his attendance, having seldom fewer than from Forty to Fifty Pupds under his care, who are boarded and lodged in the Village."], [770, "f LANCASTER.

The old School at Prescot, now part of the Master's House, and the House itself with the one adjoining, were established at a period now unknown, by the Township of Prescot, and that part of the Parish called \" The Parish Side? and supported by contributions or rates from each Township, for the benefit of education to the Inhabitants of those Districts. But such Parochial support ceased above a Century since, when the Funds consisted of Old Stock, - - \u00a350..0..0 Mr. Green's gift, - 3..1..3 which, together with about \u00a34. per annum arising from se veral properties in Prescot, and the above-mentioned School and Dwelling, constitute the whole Endowment, worth about \u00a340. per annum. At an annual Parish Meeting on St. LuMs day, Four Wahdens are chosen to elect a Master, and to do other necessary business. Subsequently several Benefactions in land and money have been made to other Trustees, viz., The Steward and Officers elected at the annual Court of the Copyholders, for the instruction of poor boys in the Town, where and in what manner they think proper. These Trustees have built a new and enlarged School, and by common consent about Forty years since, joined with the Wardens chosen by the Parish, in the Election of the Master on their having determined to unite the two Schools, and send the poor boys according to the extent of the new Funds, to TnE Pub lic School.

But all these estates are also subject to the support of other Cha rities, besides the education of poor boys, so that the surplus only is applicable to that purpose, and is now about \u00a365. per annum. A Legacy of \u00a3200. has recently been received from the Executors of the late Revd. Samuel Sewell, Vicar of Prescot, the interest of which is to be appropriated to the education of poor Boys. No Statutes prevail beyond the election of a Master belonging to the Established Church, and the instruction of the poor boys in the Church Catechism. The boys are to be selected from the Inhabitants of Prescot, and consequent ly are nominated by The Steward and Officers of the Manor- Court of Prescot. Boys from this School, if born in the Parish, are sent to Brasen-Nose College, in Oxford, where they have a prefer ence to Seven Fellowships. Lancashire men also have the preference to several good Exhibitions in the same College. The number of boys upon the Foundation is now Thir ty-Three : \u2014 Three having been added in consequence of Mr. Sewell's legacy, but the admission of these was option al with the Master. There are no data by which the deter minations of the Trustees are regulated beyond occasional usage, in the number of free boys. The number of Day scholars is now also about Thirty. It was formerly much greater ; but owing to very gross mismanagement during the Mastership of the present Gentleman's immediate Pre decessor, who, soon after his appointment, rendered him self independent of the Trustees by procuring a License to the School from the Bishop, and the consequent establish ment of other Schools in the Town, it is probable that the number will not much increase. It must also be added, that the Town is poor, and that the terms for instruction in the other Schools are lower than in this."], [773, "Prescot.] LANCASTER. 711 It is expected that the Boys, at the time of Admission, should be able to read in a Class. They are admitted at the age of Eight, and at Fourteen are superannuated : but these are points not very scrupulously adhered to. The education ofthe Free Boys is confined to Reading, Writing, and Arithmetic. The selection of Books is left to the Master. The Eton Latin and Greek Grammars are used. The present Head Master is, Mr. John Hamnett, whose Salary, in consideration of the Free Boys, is \u00a390. per annum, together with the interest of Mr. Sewell's le gacy, and the rent of the House, making in the whole about \u00a3113. per annum. This Gendeman takes Pupds, his terms being Thirty five guineas per annum. The terms for Day scholars average about a guinea per Quarter. Several of the most respectable Merchants in Liverpool have been educated in this School."], [774, "712 LANCASTER. [Preston. PRESTON. There are no Documents now remaining to show when, or by whom, The Grammar School in Preston was founded. But, as the Corporation of Preston are the Patrons of the School, and pay the principal part of the Salaries to the Masters, it is probable that it was founded and endowed by that Body ; from whom the Head Master receives \u00a345., and the Second Master \u00a340. per annum. At a subsequent period, a Mr. Bartholomew Worthing ton of this Town left a field adjoining to it, for the benefit of The Head Master ; which has lately been budt upon, and now produces in Ground rents, a little more than \u00a350. a year. There are no written Statutes or Ordinances. The School is open to boys from all parts, without any restriction or limitation, except the following, viz., that those boys, who are not the sons of Freemen of the Borough of Preston, have usually paid a small sum, as Quarterage ; but this distinction is not now insisted upon. Boys are admitted, at the discretion of the Masters, about the age of Seven, and are not subject to superannuation. The number of Scholars at present is about Forty. The Eton Grammars are used ; and the system of Edu cation is the same as is established in most of the Grammar Schools in this County. There are no Exhibitions, nor other University advantages belonging to this School ; neither are the Students sent to any particular Colleges. The present Head Master is, The Revd. Robert Haeeis, B.

This Gentleman"], [775, "Preston.] LANCASTER. 713 has generally Two Pupds in his house upon liberal Terms ; but he has not accommodation for a larger number. The Under-Master has not been in the habit of takine; any Pupds. It is gratifying to observe, that there is an excellent Library, consisting of severs Thousand volumes in various languages, in a room adjoining to the School. The Town of Preston is indebted for this Benefaction to a Gentleman of the name of Shepherd, who was long an eminent Physician here, and died about 60 years since.

The Holidays are Saturday Afternoon always, Saints' days, or Tuesday or Thursday After- noon, as it suits the inclination of The Head Master, who alone is empowered to give a Holiday. N. B.

But such was his inflexible dignity of character, that he could not stoop to court tlw Great; witlwut which, hardlv any man has made his way to a High Station. He could not expect to produce many such works as his \" London,'' and he felt the hardships of writing for bread : he was, therefore, willing to resume the office of a Schoolmaster, so 3as to have a sure, though moderate income for his life ; and an offer being made to him of The Mastership of a School, (now as certained to have been this of Appleby), provided he could obtain the Degree of Master of Arts, a requisite qualification in the Teacher, Dr. Adams was applied to, by a common friend, to know whether that could be granted to him as a favour from The University of Oxford. But, although he had made such a figure in the Literary World, it was then thought too great a favour to be asked. Pope, without any knowledge of him but from his \" London,\" recommended him to Earl Gower, who endea voured to procure for him a Degree from Dublin, by the following Letter to a friend of Dean Swift : \u2014 \" Sir, Mr. Samuel Johnson (Author of London, a Satire, and 3some other Poetical pieces) is a Native of this Country,"], [802, "LEICESTER.

They say, he is not afraid of the strictest Examination, though he is of so long a Journey ; and will venture it, if The Dean thinks it necessary ; choosing rather to die upon the road, than be starved to death in translating for Book sellers ; which has been his only subsistence for some time past. \" I fear there is more difficulty in this 3affair, than those good-natured Gentlemen apprehend; especially, as their Election cannot be delayed longer than the 11th of next Month. If you see this matter in the same fight that it appears to me, I hope you wdl burn this, and pardon me for giving you so much trouble about an impracticable thing ; But, if you think there is a probability of obtaining the favour asked, I am sure your Humanity, and propensity to relieve Merit in distress, will incline you to serve the poor man, without my adding any more to the trouble I have already given you, than assuring you that I am, with great truth, Sir, your faithful Servant, Go WEE.\" \" Trentham, 1st August, 1739.\""], [803, "Appleby Parva.] LEICESTER. 741 It was, perhaps, no small disappointment to Johnson that this respectable application had not the desired effect.

This employment was very irksome to him in every re spect, and he complained grievously of it in his Letters to his friend, Mr. Hector, who was now settled as a Surgeon"], [817, "Market Bosworth.] LEICESTER. 755 at Birmingham. The Letters are lost ; but, Mr. Hector recollects his writing, \u00ab that the Poet had described the dull sameness of his existence in these words, Vitam continet una dies (One day contains the whole of my life) ; that it was unvaried as the note of the Cuckoo ; and that he did not know, whether it was more disagreeable for him to teach, or the Boys to learn, the Grammar rules.\" His general aversion to this painful drudgery was greatly enhanced bv a disagreement between him and Sir Wolstan Dixie, the Patron of the School, in whose House, it is said, he officiated as a kind of Domestick Chaplain, so far, at least, as to say Grace at table, but was treated with what he represented as intolerable harshness ; And, after suffering for a few months such complicated misery, he relinquished a situation which all his life afterwards he recollected with the strongest aversion, and even a degree of horror. But, it is probable, that at this period, whatever uneasiness he may have endured, he laid the foundation of much future eminence by application to his studies. \u2014 Bos well's Life of Johnson, Vol. I. pp. 57-59.

The Gentlemen of the Neighbourhood feeling indignant at the appointment of Moxon, by which the objects of The Founder were completely defeated, and also aware that many other abuses existed, determined to seek redress of their grievances, by an application to The Court of Chancery.

The Information then stated various instances of Abuse and Mismanagement ; that Leases were made at small Rents, with Declarations of Trust, for tlie Daugh ters of Sir Wolstan Dixie; that the Estates were under-let ; that the surplus Rents and Profits, beyond the Salaries of the Master and Ushers, had not been applied to the purposes of the Charity; that Willoughby Dixie had appointed to the Office of Head Master Joseph Moxon, a person unfit to be Master of a School, being a Waiter in a Public-House ; whom he afterwards removed : and appointed William Wood ; that, in 1789, the Information having been filed in 1788, the Rector and Church- Wardens, under the influence and control of Wil loughby Dixie, elected him and Five other persons, also De fendants, to be Governors ; all of whom were unfit for that Office, as his Tenants, or otherwise under his control; and one a Lessee of part of the Charity Estate, at an under-value. \" The Inform.Ttion prayed an account of the Rents and Profits received by the several Defendants, and by Sir Wolstan Dixie, the Father ; that proper Directions may be given for the application of the Surplus Rents and Profits of the Charity Estates ; and that the persons, appointed Governors, may be remo ved, and proper Governors appointed."], [820, "758 LEICESTER. [Market Bosworth. This matter came on before The Chancellor, on the 16th and 17th of November, 1801, when His Lordship said, \u2014 \" It is not adviseable to dispose of this Cause entirely, 'till a Petition shall be presented, to bring before me, in another shape, the Question as to removing these Governors : But I should not do my duty, if I did not say, that, in the administration of this Charity, abuses have been practised, which call for the most mar ked animadversion of The Court. \" The authority, according to the Will, given to this Court, is a Special authority, applying to a particular Case. The par ticular provision in the Will having failed, by the refusal of The Skinners' Company to act, it naturally and legally de volved upon the Heir at Law. The Crown properly, as it al ways does, took the Heir's recommendation ofthe Governors of the School In his character of manager of the Revenues un questionably he became amenable to this Court ; for, in his character of Visitor he never could control his own accounts. If The Skinners' Company do not nominate Governors, or if their nomination cannot be considered a nomin.ition de jure, by impli cation the nomination is given to the heir at law ; and, as to the Schoolmaster, to the Bishop of Lincoln The Letters Pa tent unfortunately did not look to the present case of Lunacy. The queston is, whether the Bishop has the power of appointing the Schoolmaster, or whether the Committee has that power ; which, I think, can hardly be contended : or whether the ap pointment of the Schoolmaster is not in the Crown. The cir cumstance of Wood's situation is to be considered. He has been appointed by the Committee ; and a question occurs, that is not brought forward by this Information, whether he is dejure Schoolmaster; and whether it is not expedient, if he is a proper person to be the Master, to cloath him in a more effectual way with the character of Master, than he at present has it. \" The Letters Patent are produced to prove the charge of misapplication, not in the common sense, merely by undue ex penditure, but in corruptly retaining the rents and profits for the benefit of Sir Wolstan Dixie, or, as the Information expresses it, of part of his Family. The Estates were let in 1656, and, at subsequent periods, long prior to 1753. The first letting was undue certainly ; the Tenant being himself a Governor. But there is a great difference between an undue letting and a lease for the purpose of constituting himself Tenant, that he may have the means of underletting at a great private advantage. The leases were undue also in this respect ; that the chances of"], [821, "Market Bosworth.] LEICESTER. 759 improvement in a lapse of time are to be taken ; and are not to be prevented by leases enduring half a century. After the filing of the Information it would have been more discretion to have thrown under the view of the Court the election of Gover nors, instead of it's being made under such circumstances. From 1748, when an attempt was made to appoint new Go vernors, no regular appointment took place, until after this Information was filed : a Quarrel taking place between the Dixie Family and the Rector. In 1753, Sir Wolstan Dixie knowing he was not the legitimate manager of this Charity, and that the providence of this Court ought to have been thrown round it, the following transaction took place with Dudley, his instrument, and some others ; A lease to Dudley by these Governors, (who in truth were not Governors, the Office not being filled up), for no less than 99 years, if the three Daugh ters of Sir Wolstan Dixie should so long live, at a rent \u00a33. less than the rent paid before, and a Fine of \u00a3150. ; with a Declaration of Trust indorsed upon it by Dudley. Another lease of the same sort was made. \" It is said, the account upon an Information filed in 1788, for I must consider it as taken then, against the estate of a man, who died in 1767, would be not beyond the authority of the Court, but it would not be directed with much discretion. It is one thing to say, that a general account shall be taken of all sums received ; and another, that the Court may hold it mani- festly due to justice, that some inquiry shall be made as to the actual application of all advantages acquired under these kcises ; and I cannot think, I carry the authority to an unwholesome length by saying, I will search to the bottom the application of every thing made under those leases. At this moment I am not disposed to carry the account of the rents and profits, recei- ved by the late Sir Wolstan Dixie, farther than to* get at that. There is charge enough for that inquiry : and, instead of charg- ing the estate of Sir Wolstan Dixie, I only direct an inquiry to see, what is finally right to be done ; but if the resnlt shall be, that any part has been applied in the Family, that ought to have gone to the sustentation of the School, in any interpretation of that word, upon farther directions the Court will not feel any difficulty in saying, that must be considered as received by the order of Sir Wolstan Dixie ; and, therefore, his estate shall be answerable for the amount. \" The next period is that of the Lunatic, about a year. The Information, filed in 1788, did not produce the account of the rents and profits, received by Sir Wolstan Dixie, or the De fendant Willoughby Dixie ; But the amended and supple mental information does produce an account, viz., the Answer"], [822, "[Market Bosworth. LEICESTER. 760 put in, in 1/93. The Appointment of the Governors was in 1788. After the Information filed, when there ought to have been no more payments by Dixie, viz., in November 1789, a payment was made of eight years' Salary to the Receiver ; the Answer stating the account, as concluded. The Loughborough Estate was not accounted for, from 1768 to 1783. I have no hesitation in directing the account in a larger form with regard to that period than that, in which the late Sir Wolstan Dixie was living. It is said, the Court cannot do this. \" First, as to the Jurisdiction. I was very soon satisfied as to the Jurisdiction, if the Corporation had been full, and had the management of the rents and profits. I say also, that it does not necessarily follow, because a Commission of Charitable uses would not issue, that therefore this Court could not act ; and if it were made out that the Governors were merely nominal, and only the Agents of Dixie, this Court would try to get at it. But here was no Visitor, in fact, capable of acting ; a person, as Committee of the Lunatic, is acting without authority for him as Visitor ; and 'till after the Information filed, there were not even nominal Governors. Then, if the Information was well filed, will the election pending the suit take away from the Court the Jurisdiction, even if they were well elected ? I think, not : for the Governors, if well elected, areTrustees,and the Visitor not being capable of acting, the Jurisdiction of this Court must take place. \" Then, the Jurisdiction being clear, the next consideration is, as to the manner of taking the account. Though the ac count in form must be directed, I do not think, the under-let ting since 1787 has been carried to that strict degree of proof, to make it wise to prosecute the inquiry as to the Rents, except as to those corrupt leases ; for Trustees of a Charity are not bound to look with more providence to the affairs of the Charity than to their own. A sufficient fair letting appears as to that period to show, that an inquiry upon the ground of under-letting would not be wise. As to King and the other Tenants, if the probable result would be, that the Rents had been sufficient, I should hesitate, whether I should not direct the account for the sake of the principle ;, for no Trustee can be a Tenant; and the Court will charge him with an Occupier's rack-rent; and, therefore, if the difference of King's rent, between six and eight guineas, were not too small to make it worth while, I should expressly declare that the ground. Besides that, King must quit the premises. \" As to the other Governors, men are not to put themselves in a situation of responsible duty, and expect to be relieved even at the expense of those, who bring them into that situation. Therefore I do not think, it would be unwholesome to serve"], [823, "Market Bosworth.] LEICESTER. 761 them with the Decree. As to removing the Governors, it is very difficult to say, they are not to be removed : such an elec tion of Governors, compared with the duties, required by the Statute ! The only Answer can be, that no other Governors could be obtiuned ; but the Evidence is all against that. \" As to the consequence of removing the Governors, the questions upon that require more consideration. AVhether there should be a new Election, or a Nomination by the Bishop, or the Crown, and whether those, who have so abused the situation of Governors, shall be disqualified, I shall reserve, 'till after that Petition shall have been presented. The Relators must have their costs without doubt. It is too much to say, the Charity Estate is to be redressed at the expense of those, who seek to redress it. The consequence would be, that all Charities would be for ever liable to abuse without redress. The question then is, whether it is to be out of the Estate of the Charity. Much of it must be at private expense ; whether all, or whether there may be exceptions, shall be reserved. As to the application of the surplus rents and profits, it is difficult now to allow Mr. Dixie the surplus rents and profits he has paid over, whiie the Infor mation was pending. He had no right to apply them, pending the Suit. I am not prepared to say, that under the large words as to the sustentation of the School, due regard being had to all the objects, of necessity all the surplus must go to the School master. Upon that point also reserve the question, until after the Petition with regard to the removal of the Governors.\" On the 26th of February, 1802, a Petition was accordingly presented, suggesting, \u2014 \" That the appointment of Wood to be Master was not a due appointment, and that he was not properly qualified, \u2014 That the office of Visitor is in either His Majesty or the Heir of the Founder; and is, in consequence of the Lunacy of the Heir, vested in His Majesty ; and is to be executed by The Lord Chan cellor ; and praying a proper appointment of Masters, \u2014 That the persons, chosen as Governors, may be declared to have been improperly chosen, and may be removed, \u2014 That new Governors may be appointed, \u2014 That directions may be given for the future Regulation of the School, and for the application of the surplus rents,\" &c. On the 6th of July, 1802, this matter being brought on, His Lordship said, \u2014 \" In this Case three distinct periods are to be attended to ; \u2014 First, the acts of the elder Sir Wolstan Dixie, particularly with regard to the leases, require a declaration of the principles, upon"], [824, "LEICESTER. [Market Bosworth, 762 which his Estate is to be answerable, and some particular direc- tions. As to the time of the Lunatic himself, there is not much for consideration ; unless upon his permitting certain branches of his Family to enjoy beneficially. That enjoyment by sufferance is in a moral view much less an object of censure than the crea- tion of such an interest. As to the present Defendant, it is impossible to avoid expressing strong disapprobation of his acts ; and with regard to more than one, the Decree must contain a declaration of the sense the Court has of his conduct. Directions are also necessary as to the account. Perhaps no objection could be maintained against a general account as to the time of the Father : but I think, authority will bear me out in not involving the Charity in a general account of the period, during which he lived ; and that I may confine it to the leases, appearing to have been made by him. For the time, during which the Defendant Willoughby Dixie has had in a sense the general management, though the prosecution of such an account may not be useful, I do not know any principle, upon which I can avoid directing a general account, at least from the time of filing the Bill. I believe, great mismanagement has taken place; and that might be pressed with great force against the Defendant ; if it should be thought worth while, with reference to the delay, to go through that general account. The Pleadings require that account to be directed generally; though that direction may be acted upon in a more limited manner. \" As to the circumstances, the appointment of Moxon to he Master was invalid : next, if the Defendant had stood in a situa- tion in which he could have made that appointment, it would have been an abuse of his powers. The appointment of Wood must also be declared invalid : but with liberty to make any application for a due appointment to those persons, who can make it. The prohibition from appointing any beneficed Clerg) man is express and strong in the Statutes ; and the reason is explained, that the Master shall not in this sense be called from the exercise of his duty, attending the Scholars in his Parish Church ; the Statutes directing him to require them to furnish him with notes of the Sermons. \" As to the Governors, the Founder originally intended to reserve to his Family a considerable influence ; and that purpose was very proper in a moral view. But the conduct of the Defendant has been such, that I do not know how to preserve that influence in his person ; and, if not, I do know, how it can be preserved in any degree. The election of Governors, the sub ject of the Supplemental Bill, was a wrong and undue proceed ing ; as under the circumstances that Election ought not to have been made, pending the Cause, without leave of the Court. The"], [825, "Market Bosworth.] LEICESTER. 763 situation, in which some of the persons electing stood, calls for strong animadversion. Those Governors cannot remain ; and I think, the Court under all the circumstances, has power to remove them. Then, are they to go to a new Election ? The objection is, that then the Rector and Church-wardens are to choose the new Governors; and a doubt may be suggested, whether it is not to be considered as a default of those, who were to elect ; which would authorize the Bishop of Lincoln under the Charter to appoint ; or whether any other course is to be taken. Another consideration is, whether the interest of this Charity will not admit of particular Individuals being appointed Governors infuturo. \" 1 have long been perfectly satisfied, that this Court has jurisdiction. This is not the mere case of a Corporation, having Visitors .- but the Visitor himself has generally been one of the Governors ; and the Governors are acting as Trustees in the receipt of the rents and profits of the estate. That is a sufficient ground But there is another ground ; that the interest, which this Family have had with the Rector, has not induced him so far to accede to their purposes as to keep the Corporation alive. From the period of the dispute about the management it does not appear to have existed as a Corporation, until the Governors were filled up under those circumstances Then it is the case of persons, acting as to what does not belong to them within that Corporate character, that would be necessary to lay the Founda- tion of an objection to the Jurisdiction. The Corporation revived therefore could not possibly compel a due account for the time past, or a due application for that period, without the assistance of a Court of Equity ; which therefore must have jurisdiction as to those persons, who acted in the intermediate period ; not having vested in them that character, which alone could form the ground for an objection to the jurisdiction. \" I shall direct inquiries as to those leases, which Sir Wolstan Dixie, the Elder, procured for the benefit of some of his Family ; and I shall make his assets liable, ut least to the extent of what the Charity has lost by the benefit they received Upon the Evidence that was done by his express direction and appoint- ment : le.ises made and declarations of trust for the benefit of his issue ; who possessed under those acts. In the result of any Suit in Equity his estate ought first to refund to the Charity that loss I am not called upon to direct a general account That account would be difficult and expensive : it is not clear, that the expense of it would fall upon his estate ; and therefore it is doubtful whether it would be beneficial to the Charity ; if the expense of an account to so remote a period should be defrayed by the Charity Funds. The period of the Lunatic's management"], [826, "[Market Bosworth. LEICESTER. 764 is very short. As to the Committee, not saying, whether it would be right to disturb the payments to the Schoolmasters and others, without a very strong ground, I think it due to principle and authority to declare, that the Information must carry with it an account, at least from the time, when it was filed. The appointment of Moxon I must declare a most culpable abuse of the Trust, if vested in the Defendant. A division of the profit took place between him and Wood by bargain. Wood also must be declared not to have been duly appointed. The Defendant had imposed upon him a duty, not only to this School, but also to his Brother, to preserve by proper conduct, that Influence, which the Founder intended to give to his Family. \" This Estate has been treated too much as Private Property : Manors, Fisheries, &c, being reserved ; which might be reserved; but that must be for the benefit of the Charity.\" On the 27th of August, 1805, The ChanceUor declared, \u2014 \" That, under the circumstances of this Case, the election of Willoughby Dixie and the other Persons, as Governors, was invalid. The Accounts were directed ; and Inquiries as to the Charity Estates ; whether any and what Leases were made by Sir Wolstan Dixie, Willoughby Dixie, or their Father; at what Rents ; whether they were fair, or not ; which were wholly for the benefit of the Charity, and whether they were in Trust for Sir Wolstan Dixie, the Father, or the Lunatic, or any, and what persons, Relations of any of them. It was declared, that any Lease of the Charity Estate, as far as it shall appear to be for the personal benefit of the Grantor, or his Representatives, or any of his Children, or Family, or any persons, other than those, entitled to the benefit of the Charity, is an abuse in the applica tion of the Charity Funds ; for which such person, or his estate, is answerable : the Relators to lay before the Master a proposal for proper persons to be Governors : an Inquiry, whether Wood was duly appointed Master : and, if he was not duly appointed, or if he was an improper person, the Relators to lay a proposal for the appointment of a School-master : the Master in Chancery, to whom it was referred, to state, in whom the right of appoint ing the School-master is ; and a scheme for the future manage ment ofthe Charity.\" W'hilst the Relators were preparing to lay the various matters before Master Cox, the Master in Chancery to whom they were referred in the Chancellor's Decree, they had only been able to recommend and get appointed, Valentine Green, Esq., of Normanton-le-Heath, in the County of Leicester, as Receiver of the Rents ofthe School Estates, before Mrs. Pochin (who, on the death of Willoughby Dixie, Esq., had been appointed Com-"], [827, "Market Bosworth.] LEICESTER. 765 mittee for the Lunatic, and was sole Executrix of her brother Willoughby Dixie) filed a Bill against them, to have the Cause re-heard before a new Chancellor, who had been appointed on Lord Eldon's resignation of the Seals. To this Bill the Relators put in their Answer without much delay : But Mrs. Pochin has never brought the matter to a hearing, \u2014 a measure, which has prevented the Relators from proceeding in this business. It must, however, in justice to the Relators be stated, that they have suffered this long delay, from a specious proposal having been made to them of an amicable arrangement, without the tedious forms of the Court. And as they are well aware of the great grievance which the whole neigh bourhood sustains by procrastination, they are now deter mined, unless the business is settled to their satisfaction during the present Term (Feby., 1818), or before the Easter Term commences, to instruct Counsel to move the dismissal of Mrs. Pochin's Suit. Of those worthy men, \u2014 who so laudably and honourably instituted the proceedings, and who were so highly extolled by Lord Eldon, \u2014 Mr. Farmer only survives. Since the appointment of Mr. Green the School estates have been much improved, and the Revenue now amounts to nearly \u00a3700. a year. The Estates are situate at Appleby, in the Counties of Leicester and Derby,\u2014 at Loughborough, Carlton, Barton in the Beans, and at Bosworth, all in the County of Leices ter. The Manor of Great Appleby also belongs to the Governors. The accumulations are paid into the hands of The Accomptant General of the Court of Chancery, and amount to a very large sum. Mr. Slade, the late Head Master, received only \u00a3101. a year,\u2014 Mr. Slade (his Son), the Usher, \u00a330.,\u2014 and Mr. Holworthy, the Writing Master, \u00a320. or \u00a321. per annum.

The Free School at Market Harborough, commonly called \" Smith's Charity School,\" was founded in the year 1614, by Robert Smiths native of this place, and Citizen of London : who purchased of the Lord Mayor and Com monalty an Annuity of \u00a310. per annum, to be paid to the Master, for teaching Fifteen poor Boys, gratis. To this Annuity there has been some little addition made by Two other donors. On the 25th of May, 1650, by virtue of an order of Par liament, the yearly sum of \u00a330. was directed to be paid out of the Rectory of Whitwick, in the County of Leicester, reserved to the Lord Beaumont, and from him sequestered for increase of the maintenance of the Master of this School, his Stipend at that time being only \u00a313. per annum. It was the wish of the Founder, that Latin, Greek, and Hebrew should be taught in this School. And these in structions appear to have been complied with, from the cir cumstance of the first Five Masters being Clergymen, viz., from The Revd. John Orpin in 1614, to the death of The Revd. George Periam on the 26th of April 1780. But the original emoluments, amounting only to \u00a323. per annum, being inadequate to the talents of any person emi nent for learning, and the Poor being wholly unprovided for, excepting the Fifteen Boys mentioned by The Founder, it was lately converted into a National School on the Madras System, in which One Hundred boys nearly arc now taught free of any expense."], [830, "LEICESTER. [Kibworth. 768 KIBWORTH, near Market Harborough. The Free Grammar School at Kibworth is of ancient origin. In a Bill in Chancery, in the reign of Henry the Seventh, the Plaintiff sets forth, that certain lands and tenements in Kibworth Beauchamp, Kibworth Harcourt, Smeeton Westerby, and Carle ton Curlieu, in the County of Leicester, were heretofore given for the maintenance of a Free Grammar School, and Schoolmaster in Kibworth. On the 20th of November, 1614, a Commission upon the Statute for Charitable uses was issued, \u2014 And, on an Inquisition, on the 4th of October, 1625, it was found- that divers messuages, farms, closes, and divers rents in Kibworth Beauchamp, and other places, in the several occupations of Thomas Kilpeck, and others, were given to the maintenance of a Free School : \u2014 And, on the 6th of October, it was decreed, that all the pro fits of the premises should be employed for ever : \u2014 1 . Towards the maintenance of a Free Grammar School, and a Master of the same : \u2014 2. Towards erecting a School-house in the close of the said Thomas Kilpeck : \u2014 3 . That the Tenants, then found to have paid under-rents, should pay such sum to the Master as they were found to be worth. 4. That the Tenants should pay to the Master such rents yearly as were found : \u2014 5. That the Master should build a School-house therewith in Kilpeck's close, \u2014 should make leases for 21 years, not under the value found by the Inquisition, but for as much more as could be obtained, \u2014 and that the Lessees should pay their rent to the Master for the time being. On the 5th of July, 1709, another Commission of Charitable uses was taken out by Mr. Lamplugh, an Attorney of Kibworth, and directed to Thomas Earl of Stamford, Basil Earl of Den bigh, Sir Richard Halford, Sir George Beaumont, Sir Gil bert Pickering, Baronets, and others, \u2014 And two contradictory Orders made thereupon, occasioned a long dispute in Chancery, which, in 1722, was, by consent of all the parties, referred to the arbitration of Francis Edwards, of London, Esq., and Richard Buckby, of Kibworth Beauchamp, Gentleman, who"], [831, "Kibworth.] LEICESTER. 769 decreed that a new Feoffment should be made to Sir Richard Halford, Bart., and Fourteen others, as Trustees and Feoffees, in trust for the Inhabitants of the Parish and the Charity, \u2014 Who were empowered regularly to. elect a Master, and to perform the other parts of the original Trust\u2014 the substance of all which was confirmed by the Court of Chancery, on the 9th of July, 1722.

An addition was made to it by The Revd. Mr. Cox, the Master, who died in 1759 ; but it is still small.

The Lower School for Boys is open for all in the Town above Six years of age, free of expense ; and these are removable by a Committee, as they think fit, into The Higher School, likewise free of expense. The num ber is not limited. There are usually about One Hundred in The High School ; and about Sixty in The Low School. It is believed that the original Rents of the Town Estate as to The High School, were for establishing it as a Gram mar School. And this is confirmed by the circumstance of it's being entitled to send Two poor Scholars to Lincoln"], [841, "Melton Mowbray.] LEICESTER. 779 College, Oxford, in defect of that number not being sent from Leicester. But the Latin Grammar is now (seldom, and the Greek never, used ; the School being chiefly for Reading, Writing, and Arithmetic ; the routine of which is at the Master's discretion. The present Head Master is, Mr. John Brereton, whose Salary is \u00a384. per annum, together with a House and Close, rent free, but the Taxes amounting to \u00a321. per annum are paid by him. He has the liberty of taking what number of Boarders he pleases into his House, which has usually been Ten on the average, and for which he charges about \u00a325. per annum each. There is a Second Master to The High School, who has a Salary of \u00a355., together with a small House, rent and taxes free. He does not take Pupils. On the I st of February 1649, Mr. Henry Stokes, then Schoolmaster of Melton, was elected Head Master of Grantham, where he had the honour to have Sir Isaac Newton as one of his Pupils. On the 8th of December, 1663, Mr. Stokes voluntarily resigned Grantham School, and returned to Melton. Mr. John Henley, better known by the appellation of (i Orator Henley,\" was a native of this Town, and was bred up first in the Free School of Melton, under Mr. Daf fy, a diligent and expert Grammarian : from whence he was removed to that of Oakham, in the County of Rudand, under Mr. Wright, eminent for his knowledge of the La tin, Greek, and Hebrew languages."], [842, "LINCOLN. [Alford 780 ALFORD. The Free Grammar School of Alford is of ancient origin. By Deed dated in 1565, it is stated that, for the better relief of the Poor, and also for the godly and virtuous educa tion ofthe Youth of Alford and the Neighbourhood, Francis Spanning, of that place, Merchant, laid the first Founda tion of a \" Free School to teach the ABC, and also to read both English and Latin,\" \u2014 and that he gave \u00a3'50. to be put out to Interest, four-fifths of the Income to be applied to the use of the Schoolmaster, and one-fifth to the Poor of Alford ; and that he appointed Ten Managers of this little establishment, Six of them to be Feoffees chosen out of the Inhabitants, and to be called the first Governors of the School, the other Four to be chosen out of respectable persons in or near the Town, and to be called Auditors. William Gubbe, by deed, gave \u00a335. to promote the plan, and to increase the objects of Mr. Spanning's bene volence. In 1576, a Charter was obtained, probably through the interest of Mr. John Spenluffe and Mr. Toothby, who were both of them Auditors of the first Institution. It is worded in strict conformity with the principal views of the original Benefactors, and seems to vary only to give effect to their design, and the better to fulfil their intentions in favour of the town and neighbourhood of Alford. The Charter orders, that the School shall be a \" Free School\" for ever, for the good education and instruction of Children and Youth there, and in the neighbouring parts, and to be called \" The Free Grammar School of Queen Elizabeth,\" on the foundation of William Lord Burleigh, and Sir Thomas Cecil, Knight, his son ; \u2014 That there shall be one Master, and one Usher or Under-"], [843, "Alford.] LINCOLN. 781 Master, for ever, and appoints Ten men, Inhabitants of Alford, to be Governors of the School ; \u2014 The Governors are constituted a Corporate Bodv, and are empowered to receive lands and other possessions, and to give, grant, and assign the same. And in case of death or removal, vacancies are to be supplied by the surviving Governors ; \u2014 The Masters, and Ushers, are to be appointed by The Gover nors ; \u2014 Wholesome and proper Statutes, made by the Governors and their Successors, in writing, touching the preservation and dis position of the rents and revenues for the support of the School, are to be inviolably observed. In 1586, Mr. Galley', being the only surviving Governor under the first appointment, transferred the original School property, and made over his Trust, to the Governors under die Charter. R. Toothby, Esq., in consideration of \u00a325., and further to promote the success of the School, conveyed to Mr. John Spenluffe a house, garden, and close. The abutments correspond with the premises now occupied by the Head Master, and the Indenture between Mr. John Spenluffe and Mr. Toothby is witnessed by several Governors, and also by Mr. Richard Spenley. Mr. John Spenluffe, of Farlsthorpe, Gentleman, by his \"Will dated the 7th of April, 1588, gives his estates at Farlsthorpe and Strubby, except one pasture at Farlsthorpe called Saylbrcd, in case of his dying without lawful issue, to the Governors and their Successors for the use of the School- master, for ever, upon condition that the Governors, or their Successors, shall not let any of the lands and tenements mentioned in his Will, for less than the accustomed rent, nor grant leases for more than three years ; and pay yearly out of the same to the poor Inhabitants of Alford and Farls thorpe, Two Pounds during the life of Henry Ormsbie.

The rest of his Estates are given in like manner. By Deeds, in 1594, John Bennacle, of Sutterton, in the County of Lincoln, the Heir at Law of Mr. Spenluffe, in consideration of \u00a32.3. paid to him, and further that the good intentions of Mr. Spenluffe might not be frustrated by the non-performance of any conditions or provisions in his Will, whereby the estate of the Governors of the revenues, posses sions, and goods of the said Grammar School, and of their Successors, might in any wise be impeached or defeated by the said John Bennacle, or his heirs, \u2014 releases, as well for himself as his heirs, all the lands and premises of Mr. Spenluffe with all their right, title, and interest in the same, to the then Governors and their Successors. In 1658, Seventeen acres of meadow land, in the Parish of Saleby, were purchased by the Governors, in pursuance of the Wdl of Mr. Langton, of Bilsby, who gave \u00a3100. for the use of the School. Sir Robert Christopher, by his Will dated the 1st. of February, 1668, bequeathed \" to the Governors of The Free Grammar School of Alford, for the benefit of the said School for ever, the sum of \u00a35., to be paid yearly for ever, upon May-Day, or within Forty days after, out of his Lands in Alford, which he bought of Mr. Toothby.\" There are two Quinquennial Fellowships at Magdalen College, Cambridge, for boys from this Foundation.

They shall not absent themselves, at such time as the School is kept, about their own business out of the Town, without the consent of Two of the Governors, appointing some sufficient person in their place, if they be absent above the space of two days together. 6. The Schoolmaster shall keep a Register book to write the names, ages, and days of admission and placing of his Scholars, to the end that their continuance and proficiency in Learning may be certainly known. 7 .

If the Schoolmaster shall perceive such untowardness in any Child that he cannot learn the rudiments of Grammar, either wilfulness and negligence that he will not learn, that then it shall be lawful for the Schoolmaster (his friends being"], [847, "Alford.] LINCOLN. 785 first certified thereof) to refuse him, as one unworthy to bear the name of a Scholar, spending his time in idleness. 12. That no man shall have authority to taunt and check the Schoolmaster, or to intermeddle with any thing pertaining to his duty, but only the Governors ofthe School. 13. It shall be lawful for the Schoolmaster to expel and refuse as Scholars, all such as shall falsely and scandalously report any thing of the Schoolmaster (the Governors first certi fied thereof.)

The Grammar School of Boston was founded and endowed hy Queen Mary in the year 1554, for the instruction of boys and youth in Grammar, and may be considered as open, for such education, to those who are natives of the Town or Parish. The building was erected by The Mayor and Burgesses of the Town in 1567, being the ninth year of Queen Eliza beth, and is a spacious, lofty, and airy Room, having five windows on each side, and one at each end.

There is a good yard, or play ground, with a high wall round it. But there is no house appointed for the residence of either the Master, or Usher. The original Endowment consisted of certain messuages, lands, tenements, woods, rents, reversions, &c But the present amount of the value of that endowment, so far as it relates to the School alone, cannot be easdy ascertained with precision, as other purposes besides the founding of the School, and the maintaining of a Master and Usher, were included in the original Grant. The sum of \u00a320. is the most ancient Salary upon record, as having been paid to the Master. The Eton Latin and Greek Grammars have for many"], [851, "Boston.] LINCOLN. 789 years been generally used here.

This Gendeman resides in a large and commodious Dwelling in a very open and healthy part of the Town. He receives into his House a small number of young Gentlemen ; his terms, for the Board and Education of each Pupil, being only Thirty-four Pounds per annum. For the greater ad vantage of the youth intrusted to his care, he retains in his House a W rising-Master, who constantly attends the School.

The Free Grammar School of Gainsborough was founded by Queen Elizabeth, who permitted any of her liege Subjects to endow it with lands, or other property, not exceeding in value \u00a330. per annum. If any persons availed themselves of the Queen's permis sion, their bequests have been totally lost ! It is not improbable, that some of the original Petitioners to the Queen did endow the School : For the Charter ap points Twelve of the more discreet and substantial Inha bitants of Gainsborough, of whom the Vicar for the time being is always to be one, Governors and Trustees of the School, and of the lands, hereditaments, and premises belonging to it ; constituting them a Corporation, with the usual privileges of such a body. It was intended that there should be Two Masters, for the Trustees are required to find \" propriis oneribus\" a proper house for the School, and the Master and Usher. In the year 1734, James Wharton, of Mansfield, in the County of Nottingham, left by Will, to the Governors and Trustees of this School, certain lands and houses in the Parishes of Beckingham, and Saundby, in the same County, for the purpose of teaching Twenty-two poor Boys or Girls of the Parish of Gainsborough, and Five of the Parish of Beckingham, to read and write, and cast accompts, and to buy them clothes and books, and to put out Two of the former number apprentices, and also to give to the Poor of Gainsborough a certain quantity of Bread ; ap- portioning these bequests in such a manner, as to make them amount altogether to the then rent of the property. Certain provisions were inserted for the prevention of a deficiency, from change of times or circumstances ; but no"], [860, "LINCOLN. [Gainsborough. 798 directions were given, in case of a surplus. The estate has been, for many years past, much more than equal to the intentions of the Donor. The Grammar School of Gainsborough had been dis continued for many years, until about the year 1795, when the then Vicar of the Parish, The Revd. D. H. Uruuhart, finding considerable sums of money, arising from this' and other estates, left to the same Trustees, unapplied ; and being of opinion that the Trustees would be justified in making use of this money, as well as of the continued annual surplus, for the re-establishment of The Grammar School ; and having raised in aid \u00a3400. by a Tontine of Forty Shares, the interest thereof to be paid out of the Surplus rents of the said estates, as long as any of the Subscribers shall survive, very nobly and fortunately caused a School-house to be erected upon a piece of land of about \" an acre?' which had been awarded to The Trustees a little time before by an Act of Parliament passed, for in closing the Parish. The Revd. James Cox, M. A., from Winchester, (now D. D.). was appointed by The Trustees Master of the School, with a Stipend of \u00a330. per annum to be paid out of the aforesaid rents ; but without being required to teach any Free boys. In the year 1796 he took possession of the house, and opened the School. In the year 1816 the Vicar of the Town, The Revd. James Fothergill, and some others of the Trustees be gun to feel certain scruples, that they were not acting right in applying the money to these purposes, and they gave the Master notice to quit the house, and petitioned the Court of Chancery for directions. The business is, therefore, now before that Court. The terms of the present Master, for Board and Educa tion, are Forty guineas per annum, and for Day-Scholars Eight guineas. The boys of the former description have"], [861, "Gainsborough.] LINCOLN. 799 never much exceeded Forty in number, and the latter have been, on an average, fourteen or fifteen. The Grammes which are used, are the Eton ; but others axe called in to supply the deficiencies of them, particularly of the Latin. Much attention has been paid to Greek, Latin, and English Composition ; but it has been also the ohject of the Master, in many successful instances, to combine a scientific, or a commercial with a Classical Edu cation. During the short re-establishment of the School many young men of shining Talents have been educated in it. And, perhaps, it is a circumstance not easily paraUeled in such a recent Institution, that in one year four of the Pu pils, being all who took their Degree that year, were high among the Honours at Cambridge, viz., the Second and One other Wrangler, and two Senior Optimes, one of whom was the Senior Medallist of the same year.

The Endowment consists of a small Farm at Fulsby, and some dispersed lands in the neighbourhood of Horn castle, \u2014 and others, in the Parish of LTlceby, appropriated to the Usher.

Two late Pupils will take their first Degree at Cambridge next Term, and being the foremost of their year, in their respective Colleges, are expected to stand high in The University Honours. One of the Mathematical Pro fessors in The East India CoUege was educated here, and he is also a Fellow of St. John's College, Cambridge.

The Town of Brigg stands in Four Parishes, and had ori ginally no place of Worship under the Establishment nearer than one mile and an half. In the year 1 699, Four Gentle men built and endowed a small Chapel, and vested certain Estates in their own Heirs and the Trustees of the School. The first Minister of this Chapel was also Master of the School, \u2014 his name was James Cook, \u2014 and his right to the appointment being disputed by the then Vicar of the Parish in which the Chapel stands, the matter was compromised, and a Bond from the Vicar, dated the 17th of October, 1709, was given, by which he binds himself and his Successors never more to molest the said James Cook, or his Succes sors in the School, from officiating in the Chapel. In this, however, the Vicar seems to have exceeded his powers, for the present Vicar enjoys and claims the Chapel Estates in virtue of his Office as Vicar. There are no precise directions in the Will, as to the per sons to be appointed. The Head Master who was appoint ed about the year 1713, was a Layman, and he continued to preside over the School Forty-five years, which probab ly lost the Chapel to the Schoolmaster.

The annual amount of Rents belonging to this School being now at least \u00a3800., it seemed good to the Trus tees, by the kind advice of The Bishop of Lincoln, that whatever surplus remained, after the deduction of Salaries to the different Masters and other small incidental expenses as stated in the Statutes, should be applied in the founding Exhibitions.

The Pupil being now completely master of every other part of the Eton Grammar, commences Prosody, \u2014 and to Valpy and Ph\u00e6 drus, succeed C\u00e6sar, and the Eton Selections from the Epistles and Metamorphoses of Ovid, Cornelius Nepos, Sallust, \u2014 these are followed by Virgil, Horace, Juve nal, \u2014 by Cicero's Orations, Offices, the Eton Scriptores Romani, and by some books of Livy and Tacitus. When the Learner has committed to memory the Rules of Prosody, and is expert in scanning and the application of the Rules, he attempts Versification, \u2014 which is taught by first giving the Scholar the words of some Latin Poet thrown into disorder, to reduce into Verse, \u2014 and then by his forming Nonsense verses from the words of his Latin Prose exercise, to which he subjoins them, \u2014 by then giving him the verbal translation of Latin verses to be reduced by him into metre, \u2014 to this succeed Imitations of some Eng lish Poet in Heroic and Elegiac verse, \u2014 and lastly, original Composition and Lyric verse.

After the Inflexions of the Nouns and Verbs have been learnt, he proceeds as in Latin, beginning to construe some Author immediately, \u2014 the Rules of Grammar are constantly applied, allowing a few moments for impressing the Rules upon the memory at the time of their application. The books read in Greek are, the Delectus of Priest, the excellent publications of Dal zel, which are read completely through.

The other Classes repeat a portion of Greek or Latin Grammar, History, or Geo:graphy.

Every Lesson, except in the first Class, is construed twice over, and is parsed very carefully. On one day of the Week, the work dofte in the Week by each Class, is again construed to the Head Master ; in the last Month of the Half-year, the whole work of the Half-year is again gone over,\u2014 All the Lines also are again repeated,\u2014 and after-"], [893, "Louth.] LINCOLN. 831 wards repeated at one Lesson,\u2014 in this manner a book of Horace, or Virgil, is repeated by a Class at one Lesson, without much appjirent exertion.

In Writing and Arithmetic also, the merit or de-merit of the performance is registered likewise every day. At the end of the Half-year, Rewards are given to the most de serving,\u2014which rewards arise from a fund formed from Fines imposed upon those, who are reported tardy at the times of entering the School. All the Classes, except the first, upon leaving the Teacher, re-construe the lesson to the Captain of the Class, before they are permitted to sit down. Boys of inferior capacity are usually associated with those of brighter talents. The attention and emulation of the Scholars is constantly kept alive by Precedence during the Lesson, according to merit. Particular attention is paid to Elocution, \u2014 the higher Classes on one morning of the week deliver before the Mas ter, Speeches selected from the best English Authors, with appropriate action, \u2014 and once in the year deliver in public, Speeches from Greek, Latin, French, and English authors. This practice of Public Speaking was instituted by Dr. Orme, and has been continued by the present Master, from a con viction of it's utility, and from a wish to keep alive that Interest and Indulgence, with which the Friends \"of the Scholars and the Gentlemen of the Town and Neighbour hood have always received the Rhetorical attempts of these young Candidates for public approbation. An extensive and useful School Library has been col lected, chiefly from the Benefactions of the Parents of the Scholars upon their leaving School. Since the appointment of the present Master, a ch.arge of Half a guinea has judici-"], [894, "LINCOLN. [Loutii. 832 otisly been made upon the admission of every Scholar (ex cept those upon the Foundation), which has enabled him to expend about Ten guineas annuady in the purchase of Books. The Senior boy is appointed Librarian, who enters in a book the titles of the books taken out, and the names of the Readers, \u2014 his account is submitted weekly to the in spection of the Head Master. There is an Exhibition of \u00a36..8..6. per annum at Jesus College, Cambridge, for Scholars from the Schools of Cais tor, Louth, or Alford. The present Head Master is, The Revd. John Waite, M. A., of St. John's College, Cambridge, who was elected on the death of The Revd. Dr. Orme, in October 1814. The Income of the Head Master arising from the Endow ment, is nearly \u00a3300. per annum ; the other emoluments, except the profits arising from the board of Pupils, are absorbed by the Salaries of the Assistants. The Trustees of the School have erected an excellent and spacious House, for the residence of the Master, near to the School-room, in a situation quite retired from the Town, to which is attached a convenient Play-ground. For this House he pays rent to the Corporation of Louth, it being erected from their Corporate Purse.- The House and Grounds have been considerably improved by tlie present Master, and afford accommodation seldom equalled in simi lar Establishments. The Usher, who is now in the Eighty Second year of his age, being unequal to the duties of his situation, was permitted by The Trustees, with the approbation of the Visitor, The Bishop of Lincoln, to retire in the year 1802, with an allowance of \u00a340. per annum out ofthe Salary paid to the Usher; \u2014 The Trustees reserving to themselves the right of nominating his Locum tenens. This situation was filled by the present Master from 1802 to 1812. The Revd. T. A. Dale, B.

Mr. Dale has the privilege of admitting into his house Pupds, who attend the Grammar School. Scholars who are boarded at Lodging-Houses in the Town, pay to the Head-Master Eight guineas per annum for Cl3assical Instruction. Writing, Arithmetic, Algebra, Trigonometry, Euclid, &c, are taught at Two guineas per annum. The French language is taught in the School by a Native of France, at One guinea the Quarter. There is no Church Preferment, nor any other advant ages, belonging to this School. A respectable List might be given of Men educated at this School, who have p:assed through the Universities with Honour, and who have afterwards acquired Distinction in the Church, at the Bar, and in the Army and Navy. The School of Louth for the last Fifty years has maintained a high character in the County of Lincoln, and during this period has probably educated more Scholars for the Learned Professions than any other School in the County. Schools, however, are only the Nurses, not the Parents of Genius, \u2014 And if the School of Louth cannot display in the number of it's sons, men whose names are emblazoned in the Rolls of Fame, it can hold forth to public Respect and Gratitude, the Virtues and Talents of more humble, but not less useful Scholars. The present worthy Master, partly from a desire of gra tifying his own feelings, and partly from a wish to perpetuate the connection subsisting between the School and the Scho lars, has preserved a Register of Admission from the year 1803 to the present year 1817- No information, respecting the Masters of this School, can be obtained from the Records in the possession of the Trustees, prior to the year 1720;\u2014 in which year, it appears vol. i, H"], [896, "LINCOLN.

In the Forty-first year of Queen Elizabeth, 1599, a Com mission was appointed, and a Decree made, concerning This School ; by which it appears, in the words of the Decree, that ' there had been long and troublesome Suits between divers Schoolmasters and the Feoffees, seeking to keep the lands in their hands, and to allow the Schoolmaster only a certain Stipend in money, with the occupation of the House and some small parcel of the Lands ; and not to assure the Lands, nor any part there of, to the Schoolmaster and his Successors."], [900, "LINCOLN.

With this very laudable view there was established in the year 1710, at Spalding, a Society of Gentlemen, who, in the true style of Monastic antiquity, assumed to themselves the modest denomination of a Cell to that of London ; at once expressing their relation and connection with that re spectable Body, of which most of them were also Members, and with which they kept up an uninterrupted correspondence and communication of their Minutes, for upwards of Forty YEARS."], [907, "Spalding.] LINCOLN. 845 This Society, which took it's rise from Maurice Johnson, Esq., an Ancestor of the present Head Master of the School, and a few Gentlemen of the Town of Spalding, who met at a Coffee-House to pass away an hour in Literary conversa tion, and reading some new Publications, may be considered as one of the extraordinary efforts of the active mind of their Founder, whose intimate acquaintance with the various branches of English history and Jurisprudence supported for so long a time a Plan originally digested by himself, and also extended the views of The Society to other parts of Science. Of this Society a very particular account is given in the Third volume of The \" Bibliotheca Topographica Britan nioa.\" Wherever there has long been a communicative and com plaisant character, the same benign sentiments perpetually prevail. At least I must gratefully bear such testimony to the candour of The Governors, and the Head Master, of this School.

Camden says, that many of them soon returned to Ox ford, and thereby checked the rise of this Seminary ; And, hat an Oath was afterwards provided at Oxford, that no person of that University should take a Degree at Stamford. It appears, however, that besides those who retired from Oxford to Stamford in 1333, others followed them in the months of May, June, and July, 1334; and it seems pro bable, that the influence of the Monks of Durham, in Stamford, might at least be a subordinate motive with the Northern men who were Seceders, to give Stamford a pre ference. The Members of The University of Oxford, Mr. Blore observes, alarmed for their credit by this Secession, ap plied to King Edward the Third through their Chancellor Robert Stratford (afterwards Chancellor of England) and the Congregation of their Masters, to obtain the autho rity of Pope Benedict XII, for suppressing the concourse of Scholars to Stanford.

This Prohibition decidedly shows, that Stanford was not then considered as an University. Though it does not appear to have had the effect of completely suppressing the Schools. For the King, on the 28th of March following, 1335, issued another Proclamation from Nottingham, by which it appears, that several of The Masters and Scholars, holding the Prohibition in contempt, had, afterwards, con tinued to study at Stanford, and to perform Scholastic ex ercises there, to the disgrace of the King and the manifest dispersion of The University of Oxford : So that for the Suppression of their resistance to his authority, he had or dered the Sheriff of Lincolnshire to seize their Books and Goods in Stanford ; which last proceeding hod not had the effect of dispersing them, for that the Masters and Scho lars still, by default of the Sheriff in the performance of his duty, continued their exercises at Stanford as before ; And that special Command was therefore given to William Trussel, to declare the Prohibition at Stanford, to the Masters and Scholars there, and to return their names im mediately to the King for their Punishment : And, in this service, the Sheriff wasj commanded to be assisting, with an assurance from the King to the Seceders, that the latter should have redress before his Justices for any injury done to them at Oxford. Trussel, in pursuance of this authority, took an Inquisi tion at Stanford, on the Feast of Saint James, by which many names of those who had contumaciously resisted the"], [914, "LINCOLN. [Stamford. 852 King's commands, were returned ; and they were afterwards punished by the confiscation of their goods and imprisonment, and remanded to Oxford. Selden intimates, that the Prohibition of Scholastic exercises at Stanford was carried into effect by the King's presence on the occasion. And, if that were really the case, it should seem that the Professors and Scholars at Stan ford continued refractory for more than two years after the last Prohibition. For it does not appear that the King was at Stanford until the 3d of June 1337, from which day he kept his Court there, after his journey to York, until the first of July following. And indeed, according to Camden, the Schools of Stanford continued to flourish until the rage of the Civil Wars between the Houses of York and Lancas ter, when the Northern Soldiers stormed and ravaged the Town with fire and sword. Nevertheless, after the contests between Stanford and Oxford, the former appears still to have been the residence of several learned men, though their connection with the Schools cannot be ascertained with certainty. However, in the time of Leland, the Stanford Schools seem to have been so completely neglected, that he appears to have barely obtained information of some of their names. About the year 1721, a Literary Society was founded here upon the Rules of that at Spaldino, by John Earl of Exeter, Recorder, Maurice Johnson his Deputy, and a few other Gentlemen. But, on the decline of this Society in 1745, Dr. Stukeley, then Rector of St. Peter's, founded The Brasen-Nose Society, so called in memory of the famous University there, on whose site they met weekly on Saturdays, and Quarterly on the Saturday of or preceding the full Moon, and adjourned in Summer for the conveni ence of Members to Deeping.

The Free Grammar School at Wainfleet was found ed in the year 1484, by William Waynflete, Bishop of Winchester, Lord Chancellor of England in the reign of Henry the Sixth, and Founder of Magdalen College, Ox ford. This celebrated Bishop being possessed of certain lands and tenements at Wainfleet, which had been devised to him by will, in 1475, was desirous, by planting Grammar Learn ing in the place of his Nativity, to extend it in the Northern Provinces of the Kingdom ; and he accordingly resolved to erect there a School and Chapel, as he had done near his College. For this purpose he employed Master John Gigur, Warden of Merton College Oxford, and of the College at Tattershall in Lincolnshire, to procure a site and to contract with workmen for the building ; the Indenture for the Car pentry being dated the 25th of April, 1484. And he con veyed to the same person the property before-mentioned, to be made over by him to The President and Scholars of Magdalen College for the Endowment. This Endowment consists of a Salary of 17 marks (\u00a3ll..6..8.) a year paid by Magdalen College : the School house, gardens, orchard, and yard, the whole being nearly an acre : and about 1 8 acres of land lying in the Parishes of Wainfleet All Saints, and Wainfleet St. Mary's; part of which is inundated in Winter.

The Schetol which is the principal ornament of the Town, stands on the South side of it, and is handsomely constructed with brick. The length is 76 feet, and the breadth 26. It consists of two stories; and appears to have been designed for only two rooms ; unless a room 2\" feet by 1 8, divided by a partition of solid brick-work, toward the East end of the Lower story, belonged to the original plan. It has two Towers, which project at the West end ; in the Northern is a Staircase, and in the Southern is a Bed. Perhaps the Lower Story was intended for the School, and an apartment for the Master. It now affords a comfortable Habitation to him and his Family. The Upper Story is the present School-Room, being 7\" feet long and 20 broad, with six windows on each side and two large ones in the ends. The former have been filled with Lilies painted on single Panes, of which several still remain, irregularly scat tered ; some very clear, others obscure, inverted or upright, as they happened to be put together in repairing. All the Windows have been strongly ironed ; and those below have had very massive shutters on the inside, as appears from the iron hooks left in the wall. The Civil War, and the Li cense of the Barons, had rendered precaution necessary. It was unsafe to abide in a dwelling not barricaded or fortified. A man's house was indeed his Castle. What an age to live in ! The painted glass of the two large Windows of the Up per Story was removed, or destroyed, before August 1755. The School-Room was originally used as the Chapel, to pray for the Soul of The Founder, and the Souls of his Ancestors.

This practice, after being disconti nued many years, was resumed in 1785. This School, and the appointment of the Master, belong to Magdalen College, who repaired the building in 1755. The School is free, for Latin and Greek, to any of the Boys of the three Parishes of Wainfleet : but other branches of Literature are paid for, the terms being for Reading 6s per quarter, and for Writing and Arithmetic 1 Os. per quar ter.

As the English language was not reduced to any regular standard at the time of the pious Founder, it is probable that a knowledge of Latin and Greek might be highly bene ficial to the then Inhabitants of the three Wainfleets ; who, if Tradition and the size of the Churches may be credited, were not only more numerous, but also more opulent than at present : this may likewise be inferred from the Monu ments, and the ancient Seats in this part of the County, though it is now not only thinly inhabited, but the Inhabit ants of the Wainfleets, and Towns adjacent, are almost without exception of the Middle and Lower Orders of Society, whose Children, not likely to be profited by a Clas sical education, are put first to Reading, and afterwards to Writing and Arithmetic, for which the moderate charge, as has been stated, is made.

This benevolent Gentleman is known only to the present generation by his Will and Benefaction ; though tradition keeps alive a consanguinity in a family of the same name in this Parish, of which, in all probability, he was a Native. In the Records of the Parish is a copy of the Inquisition and Decree made and executed by certain Commissioners, on the 4th of March, 1637, in virtue of a Commission issued out of the Court of Chancery, when they constituted the Parson and the Church- Wardens for the time being, with Eleven of the principal Freeholders of the Parish, Trustees, who are to have \" the oversight, directment, and appointment\" of the School, and other Charities of the Parish ; and whose orders and directions from time to time are to regulate and govern the School. But no act of this Body is noted before Tuesday in Easter Week, 1654 ; when they elected other Trustees in the room of those deceased ; and, in the succeeding year 1655, is the first recorded Election of a School-master. During almost the entire Century that followed, there is nothing upon record, except the names of the occasionally elected Trustees, and the School-masters. But, in 1749, when Learning in this neighbourhood begun to be a matter of higher and more general concern, the Master complained that the School was crowded with little Children, to be"], [939, "Hawarden.] NORTH WALES. 929 instructed in the first rudiments of the English language ; Whereupon the Trustees ordered (the Salary being only \u00a3 15.), that no Boy should be admitted into the School before he could read in the New Testament ,- and from that date, until the year 1768, the Children of Parishioners were all taught to read, and when required, the Classics, free of any expense. In the year 1768, the Income not being adequate to the education of unlimited numbers, and no person proper to be elected, being willing to submit to the arduous undertaking ; \u2014 The Trustees reduced the number of boys on the Foun dation to Eight ; who, instead of being taught to read only, were to be instructed in reading, writing, and common Arithmetic. In 1778, the next regularly appointed Master was admitted for Three years only, and with Six Boys upon the Founda tion. But, in the following year, an influx of Boarders, amounting to 49, came to be educated at this School. This circumstance, which not only advanced the credit of the School, but caused a considerable circulation of money in the neighbourhood, excited unfounded suspicions of a pre ference being given to Strangers; and, at the expiration of the Three years, the Trustees, at the importunity of the Parishioners, again threw open the School to all who could read in the Testament; but, at the same time, fixed some what higher terms for writing and arithmetic. The excellent Master, Mr. Richard Willet, was re appointed in 1781, with deserved marks of approbation; and, during the long period of Thirty Six years, his house averaged nearly Fifty Boarders ; and, notwithstanding the hazard of infectious disorders, which, though their virulence may be abated, can neither be foreseen, nor arrested in their progress, not one boy fell a sacrifice to their malignity ; and two only died of incidental complaints ; the one of the Iliac passion, and the other of Coma. vol. ii. 3 O"], [940, "NORTH WALES.

The munificent Dean had previously in the year 1590, re-founded the Church of Rulbin, having purchased the Tythes of this Parish, and of the adjoining one of Llan Rhydd, from the Lay hands into which they had passed after the Dissolution of The Collegiate Church of Ruthin."], [946, "[Ruthi 936 NORTH WALES.

The Bishop of the Diocese of Bangor is appointed Pre sident and Visitor of this Hospital, and with the War den constitutes a Corporation, by the name of \" The President and Warden of Christ's Hospital in Ru thin,\" having a Common Seal, and Statutes drawn up by The Founder for the government of the Institution. To the College thus founded, Dr. Goodman obtained in the year 1598 a Grant from the Crown, with the concur rence it is presumed of the Bishop of Bangor, of the Rever sion of a moiety of the Rectory of Llan Elidan near Ruthin, after the death of the then Incumbent, for the support of a Master and Usher of a Grammar School to be there estab lished. The School-room which was originally built by the Dean, was re-built and enlarged in the year 1700 by Subscription ; to which, by means of similar Liberality, in the year 1742, a House for the Head Master, with numerous Bed-rooms above the School-room, was added : and since that period, Boarders from all parts of the Principality have been as numerous as the Free Scholars. The present amount of that portion of the Tythes of Llan Elidan which is appropriated to the School, is about \u00a3300. per annum, but they are deemed to be \" worth more\"; indeed within a few years past, they have been let for up wards of \u00a3500.; added to which the Waste has lately been inclosed, and is becoming tytheable. The Master has two thirds of these Tythes, subject to the repairs of the School, and the Usher has the remaining one-third. There exists a Code of Statutes, in Latin, drawn 'up by"], [947, "Ruthin.] NORTH WALES. 937 Dr. Goodman for the government of the School, which are supposed to bear a great sinularity to the Ordinances of Westminster School ; in the composition of which, it may fairly be supposed, the worthy Dean was consulted. In his Statutes he prescribes the course of Study, and the Books to be used, but these Regulations are not adhered to at present. The Boys are generally expected to be able to read En glish before admission ; but this is left to the discretion of the Head Master. The Statutes forbid the admission of any Scholar above Sixteen years of age, and die continu ance of any one in the School after Nineteen. The Eton Latin and Greek Grammars are used ; and the. system of Education is simdar to that which is pursued in other great Schools. Twice a week the Upper and Lower Schools, each formed into one Class, are examined in the Greek and Latin Grammars. Every Saturday Morning the Scholars are instructed in the Church Catechism ; and, on the same day, Latin and English Themes, alternately, are set, and are showed up on Monday Morning.

The Revd. Thomas Oliver, a Native of the Parish of Lledrod, but, at the time of his death, Vicar of Dudley, in Worcestershire, gave lands and money for the Endowment of a perpetual Grammar School, for the benefit of a limited number of the Poor Boys of his native District. By his Wdl, bearing date the 2 1st of May, 1745, he left for that purpose a small Farm, which he possessed by inheritance in this Parish, and the sum of \u00a3400. to be laid out in the purchase of other lands. These he vested in Trustees for the uses specified ; \u2014 This bequest was rendered void, by a statute against a mortmain passed a few years before. But his generous Widow, and sole Executrix, Dorothea Oliver, renewed the gift in it's full extent, and by enroll ing a Deed in Chancery, gave it every due effect. In this benevolent\"nct she was much assisted by the ad vice of the late James Lloyd, Esq., of Mabus, who bad been brought up to the profession of the law, and was then in about the Twenty-fourth year of his age. He took a journey to Dudley, got the Deed drawn up, saw it signed and executed, and procured it to be enrolled in Chancery. But previous to this, bis father and himself, at the request of the Widow, had laid out \u00a3400. in a judicious manner. Two or three pretty extensive Farms had been purchased, which by this Deed were settled, together with Mr. Oliver's own Farm, on the School for ever. The Indenture, which is dated the 1st of July, 1*46, recites that Mr. Oliver by his Will gave and devised all those his lands, called \" Ynys y Gam y Berfydd,\" in the Parish of Lled rod, in order to maintain a Grammar School there, for the edu cating Forty Children in Parcel Ycha, in that Parish, in the piinciples of the Church of England, and as far beyond the Grammar as the Masters for the time being should be capable"], [966, "SOUTH WALES.

The Grammar School at Ystrad Meiric, in the County of Cardigan, was founded by Edward Richard, a native of this Parish, and a self-taught Scholar, who became an eminent Welsh Critic, and an elegant Pastoral Poet. By an Indenture, dated the 1st of October, 1757, it appears, that this benevolent Gentleman being desirous to erect a Gram mar School in the Village of Ystrad Meiric, for educating Twelve Poor boys of this Parish in the principles of the Church of England, and \" in and as far beyond the Grammar, as the Master for the time being should be capable of teaching,\" \u2014 And in order, that a good Schoolmaster might teach School in the said village, and also read Prayers, and preach at the Parish Church, as often as he conveniently could, \u2014 And that such School might be for ever to the Glory of God, and the benefit of that poor Neighbourhood, \u2014 He had agreed to give certain premises to The Lord Bishop of St. David's and others therein named, and their Heirs for ever in Trust, that they should appoint a proper Schoolmaster to teach School in the Parish Church, or elsewhere in the Parish, and pay the rents and profits, half yearly, to such Schoolmaster and his Successors : But subject to an Annuity, of Four Pounds, to Gwen Edward, his mother, during her life; \u2014 And that the Founder, and his Mother, should have the nomination of the Schoolmaster during their respective Lives. By another Indenture, dated the 28th of September, 1771, he settled several additional Farms in the Trustees, for the pro motion of his design. But being further desirous, that an additional number of Twenty Poor Boys, of the Parish of Ystrad-Meiric, should be educated as aforesaid, making the whole number Thirty-Two, he made a new Deed, dated the 22d of April, 1774, wherein he recites the two former Indentures, compresses them into one, and in order to prevent or remove abuses, which in the course of time might possibly creep in, he added new regulations. The pious Founder never lost sight of this meritorious and patriotic plan, during the last Twenty years of his life ; his daily labour was with a view to it, and he improved it, as he improved his pecuniary circumstances ; and even upon"], [975, "Ystrad Meiric] SOUTH WALES. 965 his death-bed, as it appears by his Will, this was the greatest object of his care and solicitude. By this Deed, The Lord Bishop of St. David's, and his suc cessors, Wilmot Lord Viscount Lisburne, William Powell, James Lloyd, and Thomas Hughes, Esquires, and their Heirs, are appointed Trustees, with power to receive the Rents and Profits of the premises, and pay the same to the Schoolmaster for the time being, who should be nominated by them, and duly licensed to keep School in the Parish Church of Ystrad-Meiric, if permitted, or otherwise in the Village ; And who should actually teach and instruct Thirty-Two Poor Boys in the said Parish, in the Latin tongue, and in the Principles of the Church of England, as by law established, if such number should be offered to him for that purpose, to the intent that there might be and remain a Perpetual Grammar School there f< >r ever ; And they are also empowered to displace such Schoolmaster, for any neglect or misbehaviour in his duty, and to appoint some other fit person to succeed him. The Founder strictly enjoins the following Declarations to be at all times thereafter, the Rule of Conduct to the Trustees, in the exercise and management of the Trust re posed in them : \u2014 1. He directs, that the Schoolmaster shall be a person professing the Religion of the Church of England, of a good moral character, and well qualified to teach the Greek and Latin Classics, as taught in the Principal Grammar Schools in England, so that Boys therein instructed may be qualified for either of the Uni versities of Oxford or Cambridge. 2. That when at any time the Parish of Spytty Ystraedmey rick shall not furnish the number of Thirty-Two Boys, to be taught by the said Schoolmaster, the deficient number shall be supplied from the adjacent Parishes, or any other Parish in the County of Cardigan, until the number of Thirty-Two Boys shall be complete. 3. That the clear and net annual Income of the said Lands, so conveyed in Trust, shall, from time to time, be divided into Thirty- Two parts or shares, and that the Schoolmaster shall be only entitled to receive so many parts, or shares thereof, as there shall be Boys taught by him at the said School. The Names of which Boys, with their respective ages, and the place or parish to which they belong, shall annually be delivered by the said Schoolmaster in writing, to The Bishop of St. Davids; and so many of the said Thirty- Two parts or shares, as the Schoolmaster"], [976, "SOUTH WALES. [Ystrad Meiric 966 shall not be entitled to, on account of a deficient number of Boys, shall be paid to The Bishop of St. David's to be by him laid out in purchasing Books, to be placed in a Library for the use of the .school. 4 . '1 hat after the decease of the Founder, the Bishop of St. David's shall be the Visitor of the School, so founded, and shall have full power, in case of misbehaviour or neglect of duty, with the consent and approbation of the other Trustees, or any Two of them, in writing, for that purpose obtained, to remove the said Schoolmaster, and to appoint another to succeed, as often as they shall see occasion. And also like power for the Bishop to do all such acts, and make all snch Rules, Orders, and Regu lations, respecting the same, and the management and applica tion of the Revenue before mentioned for the support thereof, as shall seem meet and most conducive to a due performance of the intention of the said Edward Richard, and to prevent any abuse of the Foundation, or the perversion or misapplication thereof. 5. He declares, that the land so conveyed by him in Trust, shall not in any manner be liable to the payments of his debts, such provision being no way necessary. By the last Will of The pious Founder, which is dated the 28th of February, 1777, he devises Swyddffynnon Mill, in the Parish of Lledrod, in the County of Cardigan, to James Lloyd, Esq., of Mabwys, and to his Heirs for ever, subject to an annual Rent of 20,?. to his Successors, in the Free School of Y straedmeyrick, and all the Inhabitants of Ystraednieyrick, to grind for ever for has toll. He also adds the following most solemn and awful Injunctions : \u2014 \" To my Executors. \" My Will is to do good to the present Age, and no less to Posterity. Let Charity prevail over Self-interest, and my effects be disposed of to the best advantage, and the monev laid out in Books for the Library; my Wearing Apparel, and Eatables in my House, you will give to the Poor. Let it be done with Discretion. \" To my Successors in the School. \" 1 his School is not to be a Sinecure ; you must attend, and get your bread by labour and industry. This is my will, and I hope it will be observed; discharge, therefore, your Trust faith fully, as knowing that you are accountable for your behaviour, not only to The Trustees, but also to The Almighty. Let the"], [977, "Ystrad Meiric] SOUTH WALES. 967 School and Library be kept in good repair, and improved to the utmost of your power.\" In the year 1759, Mr. Richard sounded a Library for the use of this School. He fitted up a small neat room taken from the West end of the Church for this purpose, and there deposited all his own Books, and many more, which he procured from the liberality of his friends, and old Pupils. All these he left by his Will for the use of the Masters and Scholars for ever, \" but to be used only in the Library. ' Soon after his death, when a Catalogue of them was made, they amounted to the number of about \"J 00 ; and considerable additions have been made to them from time to time ever since. One Gentleman, The Revd. John Howell, M. A., late Vicar of Llanarth, presented the Library with about 200 volumes, in different languages ; so that the room was found to be rather too small to contain the whole in proper order. The inconvenience also of holding the School in the Church, and the irregularity of such a practice, calling forth Ecclesiastical Injunctions for the removal of it, induced the present Master to apply to the Trustees, and the Gentlemen of the County at large, to make a contribution for erecting a new School-room, and a Room for the Library. This proposal was well received, and \u00a3250. were subscribed for the purpose, and a neat appropriate budding has been erected near the Church, and in the Gothic style, for this purpose. The Grammar Sch ol of Lledrod, of which Mr. Richard was the first Master, was after his death, annexed to the School at Ystrad-Meiric, by The Trustees, who were of opinion, \" That the union of two Schools, under one able Head Master, would be more beneficial to the Public, than two separate Grammar Schools, in two adjoining Parishes, neither rich nor p.pulous.\" These endowments have ever since been regularly, and faithfully applied, in conformity with the intentions of the respective Founders. The Emoluments arising to both Masters from the estates"], [978, "[Ystrad Meiric.

The Eton Grammars are in use. Children are admitted as young, and stay as long as their Parents please, gratis. There are no Exhibitions belonging to this School at either of The Universities : But The Society for Pro moting Christian Knowledge and Church Union, in the Diocese of St. David's, (formed by the present most worthy and truly Apostolical Bishop) have made the following Resolutions respecting this Estabhshment : \u2014 \" That a Premium of Twenty Shillings worth of Books be given to any Boy under Twenty years of age, who shall pass the best Examination in the Greek Testament, Epictetus, and Cicero's Offices :' \u2014 ' ' That the Examination be holden on the Monday in Easter Week, after Divine Service in the Morning, in the School-room, or other more convenient place :\" \u2014 \" That the Master of each respective School, the Minister of the Parish, and the Rural Dean of the District, be requested to be the Examiners on the occasion :\" \u2014 \" That an Exhibition of Ten Pounds a year out of the Interest arising from Benefactions to the Fund for Clerical education, be given for the maintenance of a Scholar at Ystrad-Meiric School for Four years, after the age of Nineteen years complete ; and that the number of these Exhibitions be increased in proportion as the Fund increases :\" \u2014 \" That any of the Scholars of the licensed Grammar Schools in the Diocese, be eligible to such Exhibition ; \u2014 but that no Boy be admissible as a Candidate, who has not obtained a Premium at the Easter Examination :\" \u2014 \" That the Exhibition be given to such Scholar as shall pass the best Examination in the Greek Testament, Homer's Iliad, Epictetus, Cicero's Offices, C\u00e6sar's Commentaries, and any other"], [979, "Ystrad Meiric] SOUTH WALES. 969 Classical Author which the Electors may choose, together with Grotius, the Bishop of London's Summary of Evidences, and Burkhard's System of Divinity.\" By this meritorious measure, they have now Six Exhi bitioners at \u00a3 10. per annum each.
