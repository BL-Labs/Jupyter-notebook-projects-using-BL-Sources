Some explanation may be necessary for obtruding upon the public the private details of a sports man's life, and particularly when the scene of his exploits is laid within \" the four seas of Britain.\" In the customary course of field adventure, few besides the individual concerned are much interested in the successes and disappointments he experiences ; and rural sports are, iu all their general incidents, so essentially alike, as to render their minute description almost invari ably a dull and unprofitable record. Circumstances, however, may occasionally create an interest which in ordinary cases would be wanting. From local connexions, a field almost untrodden by any but himself, was opened to the writer of these Sketches. He was thrown into an unfrequented district, with a primitive people to consort with. With some advantages to profit from the accident, a remote and semi civilized region was offered to his observation ; and although within a limited distance of his Majesty's mail-coach, a country was thus disclosed, as litfle known to the multitude as the interior of Australasia ; and where, excepting some adventurous grouse-shooter, none had viewed its highlands or mingled with its inhabitants. That the scenic and personal sketches are faithful, the reader is assured ; some were written on the spot, and others traced from vivid recollection. Those with whom the author shot these wild moors, or fished these waters, will best estimate the fidelity of the descriptions ; and one valued friend, though now beneath another sun, will probably recall the days he spent by \" fell and flood,\" and bring to memory those light and joyous hours when he caroused in a mountain bivouac, and rested in a moorland hut. Of the actors in the following scenes, some are still living, while others are no more. The Colonel, that best and honestest of boon companions, sleeps with his fathers ; and old John and the Otter-kiUer have gone the way of all flesh. The priest, \"mine honoured friend,\" I rejoice to say, is still healthy and vigorous ; in his wild but happy retirement he holds \" the noiseless tenour of his way,\" exercises hospitality most liberally to the stranger, and throws forty feet of silk and hair better than any artist in the empire. Last of the \" dramatis person\u00e6,\" Hennessey is in full force, and \" mutato nomine,\" may still be found in Ballycroy. With regard to the tales and legends narrated in the succeeding pages, the former were told just as they are introduced. \" The Blind Seal \" is known to be substantially true \u2014 I have heard it from many, and never knew its veracity impugned. My lamented friend was himself the prin cipal actor in \"the Night Attack ;\" and he, poor fellow, was exactly the man who, in an affray or carouse, might be depended on. The heroes of the \"Gold Snufl-box\" are alive and merry, and long may they continue so ! for truer friends and \" better company \" never listened to the \"chimes at midnight.\" \"Mr. Dawkins\" is, I believe, engaged in seeking, through Doctors' Commons, to be relieved \"e vinculo matrimonii,\" and \"Mr. Burke\" duly announced among the last arrivals in the Sydney Gazette. Respecting the legendary stories, I have no pledge to offer for their authenticity, \u2014 old Antony believed them to the letter \u2014 I have given them nearly in his own words, and I may say with Sir Walter Scott, \"I cannot tell how the truth may be, I say the tale as 'twas said to me.\" \" The Legend of Knock-a-thample \" remains as the Otter-killer related it ; but with \" Rose Roche\" I confess to have taken liberties, in suppressing a portion of her flirtation with the \"black-eyed page,\" which, although, upon the lady's part, I feel convinced, was perfectly platonic, yet by uncharitable constructions might be tortured into something like indiscretion. If I have undervalued those rural recreations in which many a worthy citizen sometimes dissipates, I hope my contempt for his avocations will be ascribed to the true cause, namely, that local advantages have spoiled my taste and rendered me fastidious. He who can shoot grouse upon the moor, will spend little time in killing pigeons from the trap ; the angler who in a morning hooks some half-score salmon, would reckon it but sorry amusement to dabble m a pond. To a Galway rider, the Epping hunt would be a bore, and he would probably treat it with the same contumely that one of this redoubted body did hare-hunting, by nding to the hounds in morocco slippers, and carrying an open umbrella to protect him from the sun. As I have casually named \" an honoured name,\" I lament that it was not his fortune to have visited those interesting scenes, where I have been so long a useless wanderer. The wild features and wilder associations of that romantic and untouched country, would have offered him a fresh field whereon to exercise his magic pencil\u2014 and many a tale and legend still orally handed down, but which in a few years must of necessity be forgotten, would have gained immortality from the touch of \"the mighty master.\" But alas ! the creations of his splendid imagination will no more delight an enchanted world. The wand is broken, the spell is over, the lamp of life is nearly exhausted\u2014 and even now, Scotland may be mourning for the mightiest of her gifted sons. As a votive offering, these Volumes are inscribed to that matchless gemus, by an humble, but enthusiastic admirer of Sir Walter Scott."], [8, "CONTENTS. CHAPTER I. page CHAPTER X.

London, July ist, 1829. luckily she had a brother's consent to gain ; and on being consulted, he was un moved by importunity, and deaf to \"every plea of love.\" The case was hopeless. Mr. Wamsley disliked Ireland, detested military men, and above all thing's, abominated \"The Dirty Half Hundred.\" Notwithstanding its dust and desertion, I am still lurking in the metropolis. The heat has become intolerable \u2014 yesterday, I imagined myself in Calcutta \u2014 for never but in the land of curries and red pepper did I experience anything so oppressive. I breakfasted this morning at the Club house. My air and attitude, as I caught a glimpse of them in a concave mirror, looked exquisitely disconsolate. Never was mortal more ennuye than I. Town has become a desert \u2014 the world has abandoned it by general consent \u2014 the streets feel as if they had been recently fanned by a sirocco ; and of divers unhappy beings whom I encountered in my walk from Grafton-street to St. James's, none seemed at ease but a bilious gentleman from Bombay, and the French fellow who exhibits in the oven. The thermometer, in a shaded corner of the room, is stationary at 820. To remain longer here would be suicidal ; but, where to go \u2014 whither to fly \u2014 alas ! I know not. To account for the gentleman's antipathy to this celebrated corps, it will be necessary to remark that the regiment was then afflicted with a mad Major. His, the Major's, delight, lay in drinking port wine and slaying phea sants. Mr. Wamsley, on the contrary, pre ferred water and preserved game. The Major beat up preserves without remorse, and deforced keepers who, though good men and true, prudently declined joining issue with mad Majors and double-barrelled guns. Now Mr. Wamsley resisting an invasion of his rights, applied to the Justice for redress, whereas Major O'Farrell considered that a reference to the pistol would be much more gentlemanly \u2014 a deadly feud was the conse quence, and Mr. Wamsley was closely blockaded within his park walls by the military delinquent. Fortunately for all con cerned, the regiment got the route ; Mr. Wamsley recovered his liberty, and his detes tation of the gallant 50th only ended with his life. Would that you were near me, then should I be certain of sympathy and counsel \u2014 for at this moment, there is not a more persecuted gentleman in the King's dominions. But I will make a clean breast \u2014 and to render my confessions explanatory, I must favour you with some particulars of my private history. As autobiographers enjoy a prescriptive privilege of exhibiting their ancestors, I shall take the liberty of introducing my papa. In his twenty-second year, Mr. Hector O'Brien was a bold Lieutenant of Grenadiers in his Majesty's 50th Foot, then distinguished by the flattering title of \"The Dirty Half Hundred.\"* My father was a strapping fellow as ever wore a wing, kept a showy horse, and was decidedly the best dancer in the regiment. Being quartered in the vicinity of Bath, he attended the assemblies, and \"in double quick\" managed to effect a conquest. The lady had a fortune, and my father required one. Un But his sister held a very different opinion respecting the merits of the brave \" Half Hundred.\" She was devoted to the Lieu tenant of Grenadiers, and the route hurried matters to a crisis. The result may be antici pated. Despising park walls and surly keepers, Mr. O'Brien overcame every difficulty, and with the assistance of a garden-ladder, the mad Major and his double-barrelled gun, he carried off the lady, and at Gretna they became \" one flesh.\" Mr. Wamsley was irritated beyond the possibility of being appeased. Ten thousand pounds, which his wife possessed without the control of her brother, enabled my father to leave the army, and settle on his hereditary * From their black facings, the 50th received this sobriquet.'"], [12, "8 WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. estate in Roscommon ; and there he hunted, shot, fished, and farmed, and lived just as Irish gentlemen lived some thirty years ago. certain place in society, with an income in competent to its expenses, is a state of inex pressible misery. Gradually I became em barrassed, and in two years found it necessary to exchange from the Blues to a Light Cavalry regiment, then stationed in the East Indies. My uncle made no objection ; he was tired of what he termed supplying my boundless extra vagance, bade me a cold farewell, and his parting words, as I stepped into the carnage, were a request that I would \" write but seldom, as postage from the East, his lawyer told him, was enormous.\" I was the only issue of the marriage. All communication had ceased between my parents and Mr. Wamsley, and eighteen years passed away, and no appearance of abated displeasure had ever been evinced by this im placable relative. I left a public school for the Dublin University, was destined for the church, and had nearly completed my college course, when an unforeseen event changed my prospects and profession. It was the death of both my parents within the brief space of a month. I obeyed him to the letter, I only wrote once, and that was conveying an entreaty that he would purchase a majority likely to become vacant ; I got a coarse refusal, and thus our correspondence terminated. For four years I never heard from him, and had nearly forgotten that I had left a relation behind me. My father's affairs were in great disorder \u2014 his estate was heavily embarrassed, and if his debts were paid, it was ascertained that I should be left nearly destitute. The intelli gence reached Mr. Wamsley, and to the astonishment of all acquainted with his un relenting animosity to my deceased parents, a letter was received from him, inviting me to visit him at his magnificent place, Lahvorth Castle. I was surprised, however, at this distant period with a letter, worded in his stiff and peculiar style. It briefly stated that his health was indifferent, and that he would recommend me to return to Europe with as little delay as possible. The imitation was of course accepted,- I arrived, and found him a stern, disagreeable old man. My first appearance was against me \u2014 for the resemblance I bore to my father was most striking, and it seemed to recall my uncle's long-cherished prejudices. He abruptly asked me on the succeeding morning, \" What course of life I had selected ? \" I replied, \"That the army appeared best adapted to my taste and broken fortunes^\" His only obser was, \"Be it so;\" and here this laconic con versation ended. This recommendation was anything but gratifying. I liked India well enough \u2014 the climate agreed with me \u2014 my health was un impaired \u2014 the mess was good \u2014 the regiment gentlemanly \u2014 and better still, I could live most comfortably upon my pay. I felt, how ever, that my uncle's invitation should not be neglected ; applied for leave ; succeeded, and made immediate preparation for a return to Europe. My brother officers congratulated me on my good fortune in so speedily revisiting my native country ; but to me it was a subject of regret. I was leaving pleasant quarters cheerful society, and comparative independence, to become-a slave to the caprice and ill-humour of a morose and splenetic invalid. That evening, Mr. Wamsley wrote to his neighbour, Lord Ulverston. The peer was his debtor to a large amount, and generally trafficked with him for his borough of \u2014 - \u2014 bury. My uncle's request was promptly attended to. Lord Ulverston stood well at the Horse Guards ; and in a few weeks, to my unfeigned satisfaction and surprise, I was gazetted to a Cornetcy in the Blues. It was late in December when I landed at Portsmouth. The voyage had been remark ably quick, and without delay I started for my uncle's residence, and in the gloom of a wet wintry evening re-entered the gates of Lalworth Park. I looked down the long vista of splendid elms, but in the twilight the house was not visible ; not a candle glanced from a window, and no indication ofits being inhabited appeared about this melancholy mansion. The postboy stopped \u2014 I alighted, ran up the steps and rang gently \u2014 no one answered \u2014 I rang again \u2014 louder yet \u2014 and a step came hastily over the oaken floor. The old porter But my joy at this event was but of short duration. The miserly disposition of my uncle took alarm at the large outlay attendant on entering an expensive corps. Each hundred was doled out with painful reluctance, and the knowledge that a certain annual aUowance would be requisite for my support, made him still more wretched. I joined the regiment ; my subsidies \u2014 generally drafts for a paltry fifty \u2014 were \"few and far between.\" To hold a"], [13, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 9 at last approached, cautiously affixed the chain, opened a few inches of the door, and raised his candle suspiciously to examine the late visitor. Instantly recollecting me, he uttered a suppressive exclamation of astonishment, removed the fastenings, and muttered, \"Thank God, it is himself! \" and, as he admitted me, whispered that my uncle was not expected to survive till midnight. A scene, a disgusting scene ensued ; the attorney, when certified of his client's death, seized my hand and coarsely congratulated me on my good fortune. The doctor abandoned the corpse to join the solicitor in his compli ments \u2014 and between them the truth transpired. I had, indeed, been luckily expeditious in my journey, and the old man's phrase ot touch and go, was fully explained. The previous day he had signed a testament conveying his en tire property to a variety of charitable institu tions ; and the will which had been originally made in my favour, and been kept over by this singular relative, would have remained imper fect, had I not so providentially arrived the evening of his death. In silence I was conducted to a back draw ing-room, where, on a large, old-fashioned sofa the dying man was laid. The porter advanced before, and in a low voice notified my arrival. The news appeared to gratify the invalid ; he turned his dim eyes to the spot where I stood waiting for permission to ad vance. \"Are you there, Fr^nk ! \" he said in a feeble voice \u2014 \" Ha, ha, ha ! it was touch and go with you ! \" and he uttered a weak and sarcastic laugh. \u2014 \" Call Doctor Dodwell and the lawyer \u2014 desire them to bring the other will \u2014 and tell Moore and Hubert to attend to witness it.\" While he gave these orders, I gazed on the wasted features of the dying miser, and there was a strange expression of stem satisfaction visible on his countenance, as his cold glance rested fixedly on me. Im mediately the doctor, solicitor, and witnesses entered the room. \u2014 \" Raise me up,\" he said to the ancient domestic, his personal attend ant. It was done, and he motioned to the solicitor to unsold the parchment. Carefully he passed his eye over the surface to assure himself that the document was the one he required, and having ascertained the fact, he pointed to a pen. With difficulty he placed it in his trembling fingers, and with a painful exertion, affixed his signature to the deed \u2014 then looking at the witnesses as they annexed their names \u2014 \" This is my last will and testa ment,\" he said with a feeble emphasis, \" and thus do I revoke all others ! \" \u2014 then turning to me, while a ghastly smile overspread his face, \" Half an hour later would have served hospitals and almshouses, Francis : \" he leaned himself back and expired without a struggle. We left the room while the body was being laid out preparatory to interment. What a turn one hour had given to my fortunes ! I entered Lalworth Park at four o'clock, a poor miserable dependant ; at sive, I was master of all around me, possessed of twelve thousand pounds a year, owner of a borough, with fifty thousand in the funds and twenty at my banker's. Such a mingled yarn is the web of human life. The obsequies of my uncle were duly per formed, and for many days I was engaged in examining papers, and taking possession of the plate and valuables of Lalworth Park. The house was sadly out of repair, and the grounds and gardens utterly neglected. The old man had limited the fuel for the mansion to such fallen wood as could be collected throughout the domain ; and the few domes tics he employed were scarcely sufficient to ventilate, without attempting to keep in order the numerous and once splendid apartments. For some time I was busily occupied ; I hired additional servants, engaged.an architect, fiated my agent's accounts, and started then for London as soon as a decent respect towards the deceased would permit my appearing in the metropolis. Of the rest, my dear Baronet, you know sufficient particulars ; a presentable man, olim in the Blues, and recently succeeding to a large and unencumbered property, would soon \"find room in anyplace.\" I was speedily admitted to those chosen circles which are impassable to those who want birth, impu dence, or money. I ran the full round of dissi but, on this head, you, my con stant companion, require but little information. For a few moments we were not aware that he was dead ; the strength with which his last remark was uttered led us at first to believe that he had reclined in consequence of the exertion. In a few minutes the physician took his hand and sought for a pulse, but in vain ; he raised the eyelid and applied a candle to the fixed and deadly stare, and then announced that the patient had departed. In human life, George, every thing has its limits. I am probably too rich to be perma nently happy. I tired of Brookes's and Willis's"], [14, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 10 and Crockford's : I had little taste for the play, and betted moderately, and with even success : if I lost I was not depressed : if I won I was not exhilarated. The season was drawing to its close, and I began to discover that I was not fated to escape from sublunary annoyances. I was bored by the dull dinners of stupid placemen who calculated on my borough ; I was persecuted by ancient gentle women who wished to rid themselves of daughters that years ago were passees; a young and titled widow almost wooed me to desperation ; and the Dowager of \u25a0 shocked me by an assurance that Lord Leatherby expected, from my marked atten tion at the Horticultural fete, that I would forthwith propose for that sandy-haired fright his daughter.

I was as well acquainted with the mysteries of a betting book, as I was with the financial department of Timbuctoo ; when luckily \" a d -d good natured friend \" came to my aid, and with his experience, why should I not get on cleverly ? A horse was going for nothing, my friend was on the alert, made the discovery, and I bought him for five hundred. He was a dead bargain, quite a dark one, and in proof of the same, the odds against him were thirty-five to one ; but, as I was informed, there lay the beauty of the thing. As the races drew near, I discovered that my book was what the legs call a queer concern. I had picked up the halt and blind as first favourites and betted accordingly. My dark one proved a roarer, and my faithful, friend recommended me to hedge immediately, and I did so, as the result will tell. Off went the horses ; Phenomenon, my courser, in the chance medley got a splendid start, but from his pace the spectators alleged that he was hamstrung. In three hundred yards he was passed by the slowest of the bad ones, and before the leading horses reached the distance, every thing I was interested in was beaten fairly off. All I had left for con solation under this accumulation of disappoint ment was the smart hedge that I had so prudently effected before starting. I forgot in its proper place to notify an important occurrence ; it was the death of Mr. James Jones. This personage was owner of a property in Surinam, and one of the represen tatives for the borough of bury. A year before his death my late uncle had pocketed three thousand pounds, and returned as inof fensive a gentleman as ever snored upon the benches of St. Stephen's. I took his place, next the oaths, and had sufficient grace to sit quiet and listen to other declaimers, who possessed more talent or more impudence than myself. For some time I was rather undecided in my politics ; but the Ministerial were the quieter benches, \u2014 there I established myself, and for half a session none slept through a debate with a quieter conscience \u2014 but curse upon blighted beauty, I was not permitted to remain in happy and unambitious celibacy. The settling-day came ; I was at Tattersall's and so were my winners to a man ; I disbursed five thousand to divers legs with and without titles, and furthermore disposed of the cele brated horse Phenomenon for fifty pounds. But where was the worthy gentleman with whom I had hedged half my losses ? Till four o' clock I waited in painful expectation, and at that hour, he being still invisible, I ventured to hazard an inquiry, and was favoured with the comfortable tidings, that my absent friend was a broken wine-merchant, and that he had levanted the evening of the race. From my first appearance I had been ex posed to distant attacks, but as the weather warmed and the town thinned, my persecutors became more daring in their approaches. Did I venture to a Refugee concert, there I was waylaid by the widow. Did I endeavour to steal a ride in Rotten-row, I was directly hunted off by the dame rouge and that infernal Peer her father ; and all that was penniless or pass-e marked 'me as an object of unrelenting importunity. Eventually, I was driven from every place approachable by woman, and hav ing no other refuge, turned to thc turf, and engaged myself deeply in the Derby. This wind up of the season, united to sultry weather and a tender persecution, determined me to fly \"east, west, or north, I care not whither.\" This, however, was more easily decided on than effected, for to retreat is the difficulty, as I find myself hemmed in by my enemies on every side.

I apprized you in my last letter, that in this my hour of need, I would seek succour from my Irish kinsman. I wrote to him accordingly, implored him to abandon his mountain den and join me at Lalworth Park. To my invitation I received a decisive, and I would almost say, insulting refusal : \" He hated puppies, avoided flirts, was neither a fool or a fortune, and there fore had no business with such society as I should expose him to.\" The man appears to be a misanthrope ; I gave him in return a tart rejoinder, and he seems disinclined to remain my debtor.

I believe"], [16, "12 WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. This premonitory sketch will save you and me, George, an infinity of trouble. You have here the country graphically placed before you, as well as the distinguishing traits of character, for which the pleasant and virtuous com munity who abide in this interesting depart ment of the Emerald Isle are so eminently dis tinguished. I am not exactly cut out for a traveller : I am incurious as to names of guards and coachmen \u2014 never inquire after their wives, or take the population of their families ; I generally sleep from the start to the close of the stage. I did observe that the colour of corn was nearly alike in both countries ; and remarked further, that English drivers seemed partial to ale and over alls, and Irish ones preferred frieze coats and naked whiskey. The town of Ballinasloe is seated on a river, the name of which I neglected to inquire. It is much frequented by saints and cattle dealers, carries on a smart trade in sheep and proselytes, and Bibles and bullocks are \"thick as leaves in VaUombrosa.\" The cabins, moreover, are whitewashed ; pigs and popery are prohibited ; and travellers wayfaring on the seventh day denounced, and, under perilous amercements, enjoined to take their ease in their respective inns. And now, George, you shall have the par ticulars of my escape ; and, since the times of the Anabasis, or the more recent exploits of Lavalette and Ikey Solomons, never was retreat effected in more masterly style. Candour obliges me to admit, that mine was unaccom panied by sound of trumpet, or other \" pomp and circumstance of war;\" and rather re sembled the hasty retirement of a detected thief from a tabernacle, than a bold operation in noonday, and in the face of the enemy. But let that pass. I embarked a miscellaneous cargo of guns, dogs, and fishing-tackle, under the surveillance of a trusty servant, on board a Dublin steamer, and the following evening started quietly for \" the Head ; \" leaving direc tions with mine host in Grafton-street to acquaint Lord Leatherby, and all suspicious looking inquirers, that I had departed for Con stantinople, and that any commands forme must be forwarded, undercover, to the Sublime Porte While the horses were being brought out, I stroUed into the street, and, in a show-room of the Farming Society, discovered a coUection of biblicals in full activity. From a short gentle man with soiled linen and an impeded deliver)', I learned the gratifying fact, that the spread of the Gospel was progressive in California ; and, further, that a second-cousin of the King of Siam had been baptized by a Moravian Mis sionary. This latter annunciation elicited a thunder of applause ; and a young lady with a lisp pinched my elbow playfuUy, and requested me to propose that a piece of plate be trans mitted to the convertee. Now, pinching ones' elbow on a sive minutes' acquaintance is alarm ing ; I accordingly levanted, leaving Lispy to propose the plate in person. I observed in my retreat a mob assembled round the chapel, and, pushing through a crowd of ragged urchins, established myself in the doorway. Within there was a meeting of Radical Reformers, and a tall man was pouring forth a philippic from the altar, in which he made an awful example of the king's English, and, in his syllabic arrangements, differed totally from modem orthoepists. The gist of his oration went to prove, that Catholic Emancipation was a humbug\u2014 concession a farce \u2014 and luck or grace would never visit this unhappy island, until Mr. Cornelius Cassidy, of Killcooney House, was sent to represent us in the Imperial Parliament. I have no talent for statistics, but if my memory serve, the interesting portion of the British empire from which I write, is thus laid down by a modern tourist : \u2014 \"It Heth,\" says this intelligent traveller, \" under a dark gray cloud, which is evermore discharging itself on the earth, but, Hke the widow's cruse, is never exhausted.\" It is bounded on the south aud east by Christendom and part of Tipperary, on the north by Donegal, and on the west by the salt say. It abounds in bogs, lakes, and other natural curiosities; its soil consists of equal quantities of earth and stone ; and its surface is so admirably disencumbered of trees, shrubs, hedges, and ditches, that an inteUigent back woodsman from Louisiana was heard to declare with rapture, that it was the most perfectly cultivated territory in Europe. \" Further,\" saith the tourist, \" its gentry are a polished and religious race, remarkable for their punctuality in pecuniary transactions, and their freedom from a litigious or quarrelsome disposition. The prevailing mode of belief among the upper classes is anythingarianism \u2014 that ofthe people, pure Popery.\" The horses are being put to, and I must say farewell.

As my journey hither has been singularly pro- j turfs, exhibited a roaring fire . In vain I opened pitious, I shall only trouble you with the leading incidents. door and window ; in vain I tumbled blanket after blanket on the floor : hours elapsed before the fever warmth of the apartment could be abated. At last, exhausted by heat and exertion, I threw myself upon the outside of the bed-coverings, and made myself up for repose. Just then a brace of obstinate curs determined to \" bay the moon :\" one estab lished himself beneath my window, and the other took up a position on the opposite side of the street, and for three long hours they barked incessantly, relieving themselves oc casionaUy by indulging in a mournful and nerve-torturing howl. Human forbearance could not support the martyrdom I suffered : I was driven to desperation, and, collecting every missile article in the chamber, with repeated discharges routed my persecutors, and once more endeavoured to procure some rest. My carriage broke down close to the'inn of Glantane, a solitary house, as the song goes, \"delightfuUy placed in a bog.\" As some delay must necessarily occur before the repairs of the vehicle could be effected, after the example of that accomplished cavalier, Major Dalgetty, I determined to seize on this oppor tunity to provision the garrison. To this prudent proceeding on my part I found there was an insurmountable obstacle : the landlady assured me that the \" materiel \" was in the house \u2014 there was bacon in the chimney, and chickens in the yard, but there was no turf within, till the boys \u2014 the devil bother them for staying ! \u2014 came home from the blacksmith's funeral. Now, that the hotel of Glantane should be deficient in this point was marvellous. The surface of the circumjacent country, in its proportion of tiUage-ground to turbary, bears an acreable ratio of one to five hundred ; and yet, though in the bosom of a bog, there could not be a sufficiency of fire obtained to boU a potato \u2022 pot ! But human ingenuity is surprising : after a delay ofthree mortal hours I re-ascended my chaise, and, without further accident, was deposited in the town of Tuam. I sank down into a delicious slumber ; but suddenly the door was flung open, and in rushed the waiter with portentious speed. \" The house must be on fire ! \" I ejaculated as I somerseted into the centre of the floor. My fears were fortunately groundless : Dennis merely awoke me to inquire if I would drive three miles out of town to see two scoundrels fight, who had quarreUed the preceding night about a game of cribbage. Judge then, dear George, after aU these visitations, whether the annunciation of a quiet bed at Tuam was not to me \" a sound ecstatic !\" On the merits of the Mitre Inn I shaU be silent ; it produced in good time a respectable quarter of cold lamb, and a dish of exquisite potatoes. By the way, we cannot cook this latter esculent in England. Had my fare been worse, I would have submitted without a murmur; for the waiter assured my servant that I had got the best bedroom in the house. Now, in the course of my narrative, I omitted to mention, that on the preceding night I had scarcely closed an eye. On retiring to my dormitory, I remarked that the grate was heaped with black turfs, apparently in the same state in which they had been removed from their parent moor ; but, anxious to court the drowsy god, I extinguished the candle, sprang into bed, and too late discovered that I was overloaded with a mass of ponderous blanketing, while a faint spark twinkled in the bottom of the grate, and, like the cry of wisdom in the streets, was disregarded. I feU into a temporary doze, and awoke an hour afterwards in a burning fever ; for the grate, in place of cold I swaUo wed a pint of rascaUy sherry without a murmur, fortified it with a dose of diluted alcohol, yawned my way to my room, found clean linen \u2014 no sire, and, in five minutes, was buried in sleep \" fast as a watchman.\" Presently arose a hum of many voices; dreams and phantasies disturbed my uneasy slumbers ; a noise like distant music was faintly audible ; \u2014 at last a crash of instruments awoke me, and the first quadriUe was in full execution within four feet of my distracted head !

A short man, in a claret coloured coat, was paired with a stout gentle woman in bright scarlet : she must have been descended from \" the giant ; \" I would as soon grapple with her in a waltz, as commit myself to the embraces of a boa-constrictor. Vis-a vis was a police-officer, in state uniform, with a pale beauty in cerulean blue ; and a personage of immense calf, in black tights, confronted a skeleton in nankeen unmentionables. The ladies were gloriously adorned with sUver ribbon, gilt wreaths, and every flower that blows, from a pink to a peony ; the lords of the creation sported stiffened cravats and a plurality of waistcoats ; and the baU-room emitted \"an ancient and fish-like smeU\" \u2014 a miasm of musk, assisted by every abomination in perfumery. luggage. Did tired Nature quiesce for a moment, I was fearfully roused with a tornado of torturous sounds. \" Places, gentlemen ! \" \u2014\"Ladies-chain ! \" \u2014 \" Now, don't dance, Patsey ; you know you're drunk ! \" \u2014 \" Arrah ! Charley, are you stupid ? \" \u2014 \" Dos-a-dos, Miss Rourke!\" \u2014 \"Up with the Lancers!\" \u2014 \"Aisy, Mr. Bodkin! remember there are ladies here!\" \u2014 \"Waiter! there's porter wanted at the card-table ! \" Somnus ! deity of my adoration ! never expose me to such misery as I endured in the archiepiscopal town of Tuam ! Morning came, and [the company retired to supper below stairs. Anticipating the conse quences, I fortified my chamber-door with all the moveables I could coUect. It was a pru dent precaution ; for, blessed be God ! a row ensued, that finished both delph and dancing. I suffered nothing in person, but my less fortunate valet got a black eye from a Conne mara gentleman, who, unluckily for poor Travers, mistook him for the master of the ceremonies, with whom he of Connemara was at feud. I was in an intermediate state between frenzy and fever, and turned over in my mind the expediency of setting fire to the bed curtains, and sending myself, the quadriUe, and the whole company to the sides, by igniting ten pounds of Harvey's treble strong, which was stowed away somewhere in my For the present, fareweU.

Anxious to be off as soon as possible, I ofdered the horses to ; but an unforeseen diffi culty occurred in removing my luggage to the carriage, as the door was blocked up four deep by a gang of beggars. With relation to the sizes of the respective places, the lazaroni of Naples are far outnumbered by the mendi cants of Tuam. A trace broke at starting, and thus enabled me to form a pretty correct idea of this multitude. I reckoned to fifty seven, and then became confused. Although beset on every side, I was proof against impor tunity, and refused parting with a sixpence. Cursing was next tried ; and to the curious in that accomplishment, I would suggest a week's residence at the Mitre. One boy, a cripple in a dish, excelled the united talent of the commander ; but Tuam for ever ! there cursing is perfection.

Now, beggars were to the Mad Major an abomination ; and for two days he ensconced himself in his lodgings, rather than encounter the mendicants of Mul- Hiigar. Confinement will increase bile, and bile may induce gout ; and at last, wearied of captivity, he sallied forth, and to every appli cation for reHef, he specified an early day, requesting the numerous suppHcants to be punctual to the appointed time. His wish was faithfully attended to ; and on the expec ted morning, the street where he resided was literally blocked up.

Arrah ! run yourself, and bring the cripple to us.\" In a twinkling off went the red virago, and, after a short absence, issued from a neighbouring lane, with Brieney on her shoulders. \" Are you aU here now ? \" inquired the tender hearted chieftain. \"Every single sowl of us,\" said an old woman in reply. \" Ogh ! that the Ught of heaven may shine on his honour's dying hour ; but it's he that's tender to the poor ! \" \u2014 \" Amen, sweet Jasus ! \" responded a hundred voices. \" Silence ! \" said the Mad Major, as he produced a small book neatly bound in red morocco. \" Whisht, your sowls ! \" cried the big beggarman. \" Are ye listening ? \" \u2014 \" Sha, sha ! yes, yes ! \" was responded in English and Irish. \" Then, by the contents of this blessed book \u2014 and it's the Bible \u2014 a rap I won't give one of ye, you infernal vagabonds, if I remained a twelve month in MuUingar ! \" A yeU of execrations followed ; but the Major bore the cursing Hke a philosopher, and kept his promise like a monk. To the surprise of all, the beggars left Apropos to cursing ; the late Sir Charles Asgill told a story of this eccentric personage. During the time the 50th remained in Ireland, the Colonel was mostly absent from ill-health, and the command of course devolved upon the Major. By one of the military abuses at that time too common, a little Scotch Doctor, who had somehow been appointed Adjutant to a Fencible regiment, was transferred from it to the 50th. Incompetent from professional inability, he was further afflicted by a consti tutional nervousness, that made him badly calculated to come in contact with such a personage as the Mad Major. Shortly after the little Scotchman joined, the half-yearly inspection took place. Major O'FarreU, in the course of his evolutions, found it requisite to deploy into Hne, and caUed to his field-assistant \" to take an object.\" \" Have you got one ? \" cried the commander, in a voice of thunder. \"Yes, Sir,\" replied the alarmed Adjutant, in a feeble squeak. The word was given, and the right wing kept moving, until the face of the regiment assumed the form of a semicircle. \" HaUo ! \u2014 where or what is your object ? \" roared the Major. \"A crow, Sir,\" replied the unhappy Scotsman. \" And where is the crow ? \" roared the Com mander. \"Flown off,\" was the melancholy response. \" May the devil fly away with you body and bones ! Halt \u2014 dress ! Stop, Sir Charles, do stop. Just aUow me two minutes to curse that rascaUy Adjutant.\" To so reasonable a request, Sir Charles, who was a most obliging officer, readily assented. The General mentioned often, that the damning of a stupid Adjutatant was no novelty ; but that he never saw a man cursed to his perfect satisfaction, until he heard the Scotch Doctor anathematized in the Ph\u0153nix Park. The death of poor Denis was in such perfect keeping with his life, that I am tempted to give it to you. The regiment was in garrison, and at a race baU a trifling misunderstanding occurred be tween a young Ensign and a country-gentleman. It was, however, instantly adjusted. A few days afterwards, some intemperate expressions which had fallen from the gentleman at the ball, were reported to the Mad Major. These he considered as reflecting upon the character * Bryan the Cripple."], [20, "16 WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. in his resolve.

The answer to this demand was unsatisfactory, and the Captain was directed to deliver a hostile message. The officers of the \" Half Hundred\" were a brave body \u2014 they vainly endeavoured to make it a regimental affair, and insisted that the person to resent the insult should be indifferently selected (by lot) from the corps. The body was carried to its last resting place, accompanied by all the pomp of a military funeral. His own beloved company, the grenadiers, who had often foUowed their lion-hearted leader into action, now formed his guard of honour to the grave ; and when his remains were committed to the earth there was not a dry eye among the \"Dirty Half Hundred.\" \" Gentlemen, I thank you ; \" said the Mad Major, as he struck his broad hand upon the mess-table. \" Your motives are personaUy kind \u2014 but as I am at the head osthis regiment, I hold myself to be the conservator ofits honour.\" That evening the major had a violent attack of gout, to which for years he had been a martyr \u2014 but he concealed it carefully, and when his friend caUed him on the morning, he was found dressed and powdered, but unable to move without assistance.

From other provincial cities, this town is distinguished in having a new drop and an old gaol ; a swamp in the centre of the town surrounded by an iron chain, judiciously placed there, I imagine, to prevent cattle and children being lost in the morass which it environs ; a court-house, with a piazza and facade, of an original order of architecture, only known to Irish professors of the art of building ; trade and manufactures are limited to felt-hats and poteen whisky ; and the only machinery I could discover was the drop, aforesaid. I was informed that the chapel and petty-sessions are generaUy crowded, as is the market, upon a hanging-day. town, and where, in the course of argument, it was believed that divers Hves would be lost, I took an early breakfast, and departed. I stopped at Newport ; it was the last cluster of houses arrogating to itself the title of a town, that I should now meet with, for I had reached the ultima Thule of civihzed Europe \u2014 and when I had given directions to the post master touching the transmission of my letters inmy cousin's bag, I looked around me, and took a silent but mournful fareweU of Christendom. I found at the public-house that my ldnsman had provided for my farther progress into terra incognita. A couple of rudely-constructed vehicles were waiting to receive myself and personal property, and a wfld bare-legged mountaineer, with a leathern bag strapped across his shoulders, announced himself as guide. \"Had he no horse?\" \u2014 \"Devil a harse ! but he would warrant he would keep up with me,\" \u2014 and away we went under a salute of our dogs, and the furtive glances of sundry ladies with their hair in papers. I was caUed next morning at five o'clock by the waiter, to proceed by the Sligo mail although on the preceding night I had taken consider able pains to persuade him that my course lay westward. One hour afterwards, the chamber maid roused me to inquire if I had any inten tion of proceeding to Holly-mount by a hackney car. To save these worthy people further trouble, I arose and dressed, and, wishing to avoid a vestry to be that day holden in the Some distance from the town we crossed an ancient bridge of many arches, through which an extensive lake communicates with the sea, and farther on passed the old tower of"], [21, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST 17 Carrigahowla. Our route was contiguous to the sea \u2014 on the left were the numerous islands of Clew Bay ; on the right an extensive chain of savage hiUs and barren moorland. The road now became hardly passable ; constructed without the least regard to levelness, \u2014 here it dipped into a ravine, and there breasted some sudden hiU, inaccessible to any carriage but the light machines we travelled with. Its surface was rough, and interrupted by a multi tude of loose stones ; while some of the bridges were partially dilapidated, and others had never been completed. In these, the ragged line of granite which formed the key-stones of the arches stood nakedly up, and presented a barrier that no common carriage could overtop without endangering its springs and harness. Yet this forlorn road is the only communication with a highly improvable country, covering at least fifty square miles, with numerous and profitable islands attached, and an immense line of sea-coast, possessing rich fisheries, and abounding in kelp weed and manure ! And why was this neglect ? Were the proprietors of this deserted district so cold to that true spring of human action, self-aggrandizement, as to omit providing an outlet for the sources of their opulence ? Were there no public monies aUocated to these abandoned corners of the earth, and so much lavishly expended on many a useless undertaking elsewhere ? Yes : large sums have been presented and represented by the Grand Juries for the last twenty years, but they have been regularly pocketed by those to whose good faith they were entrusted. Would it be believed in England, George, that this atrocious system of peculation has been carried to such an extent, that roads have been passed, as completed, when their lines have been but roughly marked out \u2014 and bridges been actually paid for, the necessary accounting affidavits having been sworn to in open court, when not a stone was ever laid, and to this day the stream runs without a solitary arch to span its flood from the source to the debouche ment ? Ay \u2014 these delinquencies have been often and notoriously perpetrated, and none have had the courage to drag the criminals to justice. in it I embarked my person and establishment. Taking advantage of a south-westerly wind, the boatmen hoisted their close-reefed lug, and away we shot rapidly towards the entrance of the inlet. From the high lands which rose on every side, the squaUs feU more heavily and frequent than I found agreeable ; but in an hour we cleared this confined and dangerous channel, and, running between Currane Point and the island of Innis Biggie, entered Black Sod Bay. The passage down the inlet was marked with several incidents which were in perfect keeping with the wUd and savage scenery around. A seal would suddenly raise his round head above the surface, gaze for a moment at the boat, and, when he had apparently satisfied his curiosity, sink quietly from our view. In rounding the numerous headlands through which this inlet irregularly winds, we often started flocks of curlews,* which, rising in an alarm at our unexpected appearance, made the rocks ring with their loud and piercing whistle. Skirting the shore of Innis Biggie, we disturbed an osprey or sea-eagle, t in the act of feeding on a bird. He rose leisurely, and, lighting on a rock, waited tiU we passed, and then returned to his prey. We ran sufficiently close to the island to observe * The bill is long, equally incurvated, and terminated in a blunt point ; nostrils linear, and longitudinal near the base ; tongue short and sharp-pointed ; and the toes are connected as far as the first joint of the membrane. With the curlew, Linn\u00e6us begins a numerous tribe of birds under the genuine name of Scalo pax, which, in his arrangement, includes all the snipes and godwits, amounting, according to Latham, to forty-two species and eight varieties, spread over various parts of the world, but no where very numerous. Buffon describes fifteen species and varieties of the curlew, and Latham ten, only two or three of which are British birds. They feed upon worms, which they pick up on the surface, or with their bills dig from the soft earth : on these they depend for their principal support : but they also devour the various kinds of insects which swarm in the mud and in the wet boggy grounds, where these birds chiefly take up their abode. t \" Eagles are well knowne to breed here, but neither so bigge, nor so many, as books tell.

Nor are the dogs forgotten ; for them a warm and sheltered kennel is fitted up with benches, and well provided with straw. Many a sporting-lodge in England, on which thousands have been expended, lacks the comforts of my kinsman's unpre- tending cottage. Where are the coach- houses ? Those, indeed, would be useless appendages ; for the nearest road on which a wheel could turn, is ten miles distant from the lodge. When we had cleared the islands, the breeze blew fresh and steadny ; the boatmen shook out the reefs, which had hitherto confined their canvass ; the gaUey, with increased velocity, rushed through the rippling water, till, doubling a neck of land surmounted by a ruined castle, and running up a sheltered creek, I found myself at the termination of my voyage, and warmly welcomed by my Irish kinsman, from whom for fifteen years I had been separated. I have been here three days, and am as much domesticated in the mansion as my cousin's Newfoundland dog. I know the names and \"sobriquet\" of the establishment; can dis criminate between \" Hamish-a-neilan\" (James of the island) and Andy-bawn (Fair Andy) ; I hold converse with the cook, and am hand and-glove with the housemaid.

If the wind and clouds are favourable, the rod, ready jointed and spliced, is lifted from beneath the cottage eave, where it \"lay like a warrior taking his rest,\" on a continuation of level pegs. The gaff and pan nier are produced by a loose-looking moun taineer, whose light-formed but sinewy limbs are untrammelled by shoe or stocking. Fond of the sport himself, he evinces an ardent interest in your success ; on the moor and by the river he is a good-humoured and obliging assistant ; traverses the mountains for a day, and Hes out on the hill-side through the long autumnal night, to watch the passage of the red deer as they steal down from the mountain top to browse on the lower grounds by moon light. Want of success had damped my ardour for piscation ; and besides, I had involved myself n a most amusing article in Blackwood, and felt an unwillingness to lay aside the book. At this moment of indecision, old Antony the otter-killer, one of that numerous and nonde script personages who locate themselves in the houses of the Irish gentry, passed the window with a fine salmon and a brace of trout sixteen inches long. How fresh and sparkling is the phosphoric shading of the scales, as the old man turns them round for my inspection ! What a beautiful fish ! It barely\" measures thirty inches, and is fuUy ten pounds weight ! That short and deep-shouldered briddawn* is worth all the lubberly roach, dace, perch and gudgeons that the Thames contains from its source to it debouchement.

Figure to yourself a little feeble man, dressed in a jerkin of coarse blue cloth, with an otter (a fancy of my cousin's) blazoned on his arm : in one hand he holds a fish-spear, which assists him when he meets with rugged ground, in the other a very unpretending angle, jointed rudely with a penknife, and secured by waxen threads ; a cast of flies are wound about his hat, and\u00bb his remaining stock, not exceeding half-a-dozen, are contained between the leaves of a tattered song-book ; in the same depository he has some silk, dyed mohair, a hare's ear, and a few feathers from the cock, kown turkey, and mal lard ; and these simple materials furnish him with most efficient flies, but he requires a bright day to fabricate them, as his sight is indiffe rent. How different from this wild and cheerful follower are the sporting attendants of the unhappy Cockney ! He must consort with \" bacon-fed knaves,\" be the companion of your brawny jolter-headed, porter-swollen waterman, who, in sulky silence, paddles his employer into some phlegmatic pool, where the disciple of Walton is secure of the lumbago, but by no means certain of a sprat. In truth, dear George, I am half ashamed of myself. I came here loaded with rods, flies, and baskets, with the ' ' thousand and one \" nameless et cetera furnished from a city tackle-shop, in their uses and appearance vari ous as the cargo of the ark. When I displayed yesterday this accumulation of \"engines and cunning devices,\" my cousin burst into a roar of laughter, and > inquired if I intended to annihilate the fishery ? \" Then, turning, leaf by leaf, three immense fly-books over, he praised the pretty feathers, commended the brightness of the tinsel, and good-naturedly assured me that this rich assemblage did not possess a fly of the value of one farthing. I fear his verdict vyas a \"true one ; I have tried two days consecutively and never hooked a fish.

Ten minutes' easy walking brought us to a noble pool above the Wear, where my friend never fails to kill a salmon, if the wind be westerly and the water not too low. The water was in beautiful order, and my cousin insisted that, under his direc tion, I should once more try my fortune with the fishing-rod. Discarding my gaudy flies with a malediction upon the knave who tied them, he affixed two of his upon the casting line ; and nothing could be of a simpler cha racter than those selected from his book. The tail-fly was a plain black, and orange mohair body, with a long and pointed turkey-feather wing ; the dropper was formed of blue and scarlet wool, ribbed with silver, a pheasant sprit for legs, and mixed wings of the turkey and mallard. unwearied and incessant opposition he makes, until his strength is exhausted by the angler's science ; all this must be experienced to be adequately conceived. In ten minutes I mastered my beautiful victim ; and Mortien Beg gaffed and landed a splendid summer fish, which if the cook's scales be correct, weighed thirteen pounds and seven ounces. Overjoyed with my success, I proceeded up the river. My cousin brought me to several delightful pools ; and, with his assistance, I raised and hooked several capital fish, but only landed one of them, a nice and active salmon of about eight pounds weight. From half a dozen white trout fresh from the sea, I received excellent amusement ; and at six o'clock re turned to dinner, gratified with my sport, pleased with myself, and at peace with aU man kind, excepting that confounded cozener, the tackle-merchant in Street. I made several unsuccessful casts : \" A bad look-out, friend Julius. Heaven forfend that the cook has placed any dependence on the angle !\" Again I tried the pool, and, like all disappointed fishermen, began to prognosticate a change of weather. \"I had remarked mares' tails in the sky yesterday evening, and here was rain overhead, for a hundred ! \" My cousin smfled, when suddenly my nebulous speculations were interrupted by a deep slug gish roll at the dropper. Monamondiaoul ! \"* exclaimed Mortien Beg,f as he caught a mo mentary glance of the broad and fan-like tail. Over our wine, the conversation naturaUy turned upon the \" gentle art.\" My kinsman is both a practical and a scientific angler. \"Holding, with few exceptions, aU published sporting productions in disrepute, one that I remarked on your bookstand, Juhus, strikes me as being at the same time clever and use ful : I mean Sir Humphry Davy's.\" \" It is both, Frank : his account ofthe habits and natural history of the salmon species is just, ingenious, and amusing ; and there is a calm and philosophic spirit that pervades the whole, rendering it a work of more than common interest. But, practicaUy, it is as use less as aU Guides and Manuals, since the days of Walton. Of the uninitiated it will make fishermen, where Colonel Hawker's directions enable a man to shoot, who has never been five miles from Holborn-bars. I doubt not but Sir Humphry was an ardent and scientific fisherman, but in many practical points I differ with him. He angled well, but he fished Hke a philosopher. If he haunted this river for a season, unless he altered his system materially, he would not kiU a dozen salmon. Flies, such as he describes, would never, in any seasons or weathers, be successful here. He fairly says, that ' different rivers require different flies ; ' but nothing like those he recommends would answer this one ;\u2014 and, although many of the theories and speculative opinions are very ingenious, I question much their validity. \"Admiring Sir Humphry as I do, I would pardon his philosophy and fine flies, his ' golden pheasant, silken-bodied, orange, red, and pale blue, silver- twisted, and king's-fisher mixtures,' \" He is fifteen pound weight ! \" Obedient to the directions of my Mentor, I left the spot the salmon leaped in, and commenced casting a dozen yards below it. Gradually I came over him again. \" A light cast, Frank, and you have him.\" I tried, and succeeded gal lantly.

He is the schipper of my cousin's hooker. After a career of perilous adventure in piloting the Flushing smugglers to the coast, he has abandoned his dangerous trade, to pass an honester and safer life in future. \" WeU, Pattigo,* -what news ? \" \"The night looks dirty enough, sir; shall we run the hooker round to Tallaghon, and get the rowing-boats drawn up ? \" His master assented, and ordered him the customary glass of poteen.

The rain now fell in torrents ; the sea rose, and broke upon the rocks in thunder ; mine host directed the storm-shutters to be put up, ordered in candles, with a fresh supply of billets for the fire, and we made final preparations to be comfortable for the night. \" Is the seal, John, a sure foreteUer of an approaching storm ?\" \" A certain one, sir : I remember him when I was a boy in the old master's kitchen \u2014 the Lord be merciful to his soul !

It mast be made away with directly, or the crappawn would continue, and her charms be unequal to avert the malady. The superstitious wretch consented to the hag's proposal ; and the seal was put on board a boat, carried out beyond Clare Island, and there committed to the deep to manage for himself as he best could. The boat returned, the family retired to rest, and next morning a servant awakened her master to teU him that the seal was quietly sleeping in the oven. The poor animal over night came back to his beloved home, crept through an open window, and took possession of his favourite resting-place. \"I remarked,\" said my kinsman, as he struck the ashes from his meerschaum, \" that you appeared amused with old John's history of Shawn a tra buoy. Although, in its wild state, the seal is always shy, and sometimes dangerous, yet when taken young it is easily domesticated, and susceptible of strong attach ment to its keepers.* There is a curious story told of one of these animals \u2014 I beheve the leading incidents of the narrative to be per fectly authentic ; and it is a memorable record of enduring attachment in the animal, and exquisite barbarity in the man. The tale runs thus:\u2014 \" About forty years ago a young seal was taken in Clew Bay, and domesticated in the kitchen of a gentleman, whose house was situated on the sea-shore. It grew apace, be came familiar with the servants, and attached to the house and family ; its habits were inno cent and gentle ; it played with the children, came at its master's caU, and, as the old man described him to me, was ' fond as a dog, and playful as a kitten.' \"Next morning another cow was reported to be unwell ; and the seal must now be finaUy removed. A Galway fishing-boat was leaving Westport on her return home, and the master undertook to carry off the seal, and not put him overboard until he had gone leagues be yond Innis Boffin. It was done; a day and night passed ; the second evening closed ; the servant was raking the fire for the night ; something scratched gently at the door \u2014 it was, of course, the house dog \u2014 she opened it, and in came the seal ! Wearied with his long and unusual voyage, he testified, by a peculiar cry expres sive of pleasure, his delight to find himself at home ; then stretching himself before the glow ing embers of the hearth, he fell into a deep sleep. \" Daily the seal went out to fish, and, after providing for his own wants, frequently brought in a salmon or turbot to his master. His delight in summer was to bask in the sun, and in winter to he before the fire, or, if permitted, creep into the large oven, which at that time formed the regular appendage of an Irish kitchen. \"For four years the seal had been thus \" The master of the house was immediately apprised of this unexpected and unwelcome visit. In the exigency, the beldame was awak ened and consulted : she averred that it was always unlucky to kUl a seal, but suggested that the animal should be deprived of sight, and a third time carried out to sea. To this hellish proposition the besotted wretch who owned the house consented; and the affec tionate and confiding creature was crueUy robbed of sight on that hearth, for which he had resigned his native element ! Next morn ing, writhing in agony, the mutilated seal was * In January, 1819, in the neighbourhood of Burnt Island, a gentleman completely succeeded in taming a seal : its singularities attracted the curiosity of strangers daily. It appeared to possess all the sagacity of the dog, and lived in its master's house, and ate from his hand. In his fishing excursions, this gentleman generally took it with him ; upon which occasions it afforded no small entertainment. When thrown into the water, it would follow for miles the track of the boat, and although thrust back by the oars, it never relinquished its purpose ; in deed, it struggled so hard to regain its seat, that one would imagine its fondness for its master had entirely overcome the natural predilection for its native element."], [28, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 24 poor beast, it perished from hunger, being in capacitated from blindness to procure its cus tomary food \u2014 was buried in a sand-hiU, and from that moment misfortunes foUowed the abetters and perpetrators of this inhuman deed.

In the pauses of the storm a wailing noise at times was saintly heard at the door. The servants, who slept in the kitchen, con cluded that the Banshee* came to forewarn them of an approaching death, and buried their heads in the bed-coverings.

To stir out of doors was impossible ; the Lodge is unpro vided with a billiard-table, and it requires ingenuity to contrive some occupation for the long duration of a summer's day. The breakfast was prolonged as much as possible ; it ended, however, and my kinsman left me to give some necessary directions to his household. I seated myself in the window ; the view seaward was interrupted by the thick ness of the weather, the rain dropped from the thatch incessantly, the monotonous splash of the falling water, witli the sombre influence of a dull and torpid atmosphere, gradually pro duced a drowsiness, and I fell fast asleep over a dull collection of sporting anecdotes. My cousin's return roused me ; he placed a spider table beside the window, and, having unlocked a box filled with angling materials, \" in great and marvellous disorder,\" proceeded to ex tract, from a mass of unmentionable things, the requisites for dressing a cast or two of flies. As my own voluminous book had been sadly discomposed in the numerous inter changes I made, when vainly trying to seduce a salmon to try my \"tinsel and fine feathers,\" I proceeded to arrange my splendid collection, * The Banshee is a nondescript being, sup posed to be attached to particular families, and to take a lively interest in their weal or misfor tunes ; and there are few ancient houses in Ire land unprovided with this domestic spirit.

On one occasion he beat severely a drunken servant who was belated returning from a fair \u2014 and a quarter of mutton, which the unhappy man was bringing home, confirmed the story, for after the \" Hill man's \" assault, it was found to be as black as the ribs of the unfortunate sufferer. The appearance of the banshee is variously described \u2014 as she sometimes assumes the form of \" a little wizened old woman,\" and at others takes the semblance of \" a black bitch.\""], [29, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 25 while my kinsman was busied with his own simple stock. The disappointment I had endured in finding my flies so unprofitable, had made me hold the entire outfit of the London artist in disrepute ; and I would have given my most elaborate and expensive fishing rod for the hazel angle ofthe ancient otteikiller. \" He ties a very handsome fly, no doubt.\" \"I won't say that, \u2014 he ties a very killing one. I expect him presently ; and as the day is wet, I'll leave the materials ready, and to morrow, if the rain ceases soon, we shall prove the value of his flies. \" As we are on the subject of tying, I must observe, that the advantage one derives from being able to construct his own flies is won derful ; in fact, without attaining this accom plishment in the ' gentle art ' no one can fish comfortably or successfully. No stock, how ever extensive, will afford a supply adapted for every change of weather and water ; and a man may lose a day overlooking an intermin able variety of kinds and colours, in a vain search after one killing fly. Not so the artist: the favourite insect being once ascertained, he speedily produces an imitation, and fiUs his basket ; while his less fortunate neighbour is idly turning the pages of his over-stocked fishing-book. \" Frank,\" said my cousin, \" you must not undervalue what reaUy is unexceptionable ; I mean the mechanical part of your collection. Those rods are beautiful ; and your reels, lines, gut, and hooks, cannot be surpassed ; your flies may be excellent in an English river, so put them carefully aside, as I wiU supply you with some better adapted to our mountain streams. But what a size that book is ! In fishing, as in literature, the schoolmen's adage holds, Mega biblion, mega kakon. Why, nothing but a soldier's pack would carry it ! we wUl soon, however, render you indepen dent of this mighty magazine, by teaching you to fabricate your own flies.\" \" I fear I am too old to learn ; the art of tying must, I presume, be acquired early in life, and brought to perfection by after expe rience.\" \" I had two sporting friends, who were excellent instances of this. Colonel S was an ardent, and, I may add, a very toler able angler ; and no one went to more trouble and expense in procuring the most approved flies. He never tied, or attempted to tie one, and he assured me he had many hundred dozens in his possession. To find a new fly was with him sometimes the labour of a day ; and when about to try another water, he would spend hours toiling through his immense col lection, before he could succeed in discovering the necessary colour and description. I have seen him, with Job-like patience, labouring through endless papers and parcels, in search of a paltry insect that I could fabricate in five minutes. \" This does not always foUow ; I did, when a boy, tie flies passably ; but, having left oft fishing when I removed from my native river, I forgot the art, and depended on others for my supply. The person who furnished my casting-lines fell sick, and it unluckily hap pened that his illness occurred in the best period of the season ; and as the river was filled with fish, constant service soon wore out my scanty store. Necessity is the mother,- \u2014 you know the proverb, \u2014 I was sadly reduced ; ground blunted hooks and patched ravelling bodies, till at last my stock was reduced to half-a-dozen, and that half-dozen to perfect skeletons. What was to be done ? Man is an imitative animal \u2014 I endeavoured to fabri cate \u2014 produced something between a bird and a bee \u2014 tried again, succeeded better ; and before my artist had recovered, by the shade of Walton! I could turn out a reputable fly.\" \" His companion, Captain B , ran into an opposite extreme. He rarely had a second casting line, and seldom a second set of flies. Did the day change, or the river fill or lower, he sat down on the bank, ripped wings and dubbings from his hooks, and prepared a new outfit in a twinkling. I never met an angler who was so certain of silling a basket as my friend B . His system, however, I would totally disapprove of. Without burdening oneself with enough to furnish out a tackle shop, a small and effective collection is desir able ; and it is absurd to lose a fortunate half hour tying on the river bank what could be more conveniently fabricated during the tedium of a wet day within doors. An accident may rob the most discreet angler of his flies, and surely \"I believe I must make an attempt.\" \" You shall succeed, and, as a preliminary, I will put you under the tutelage of my wor thy neighbour, the priest. Observe his style of casting, and mark the facility with which he sends five-and-thirty feet of hair and gut across the broadest pool. I fish tolerably, but have repeatedly laid aside my rod to admire the beautiful casting of this perfect master of the angle.\""], [30, "26 WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. \u2014he was after all a brother\u2014 and admitting that rod and coat were not worth threepence, stUl he was an adept in the ' gentle art,' although the most ragged disciple that ever Walton boasted. I forgave him, dismissed the cap tors, and ordered him to the Lodge for refresh ment. ' My honour had no sport,' and he looked carelessly at my flies. ' Would I con descend to try one of his ? ' and he put a strange-looking combination of wool and feathers on the casting-hne. There was a fine pool near us \u2014 I tried it, and at the second cast I was fast in a twelve-pound salmon ! My rag ged friend remained with me some days ; and in his sober intervals, ' few and far between, ' gave me lessons in the art that have been more serviceable than any I had hitherto acquired. it is necessary to have a fresh relay to put up. But though I take a sufficiency along with me, I never leave home without being provided with the materials for constructing new ones. An hour may bring an ephemerae on the waters which you must imitate, or you will cast in vain-; before evening they have vanished and given place to some new variety of the in sect world. Thus far, at least, the tyer pos sesses an advantage over him who cannot pro duce a fly that no collection which human ingenuity can form will compensate. \" The best practical lesson I ever got origi nated in the following accidental occurrence. Some years ago I received private information that a travelling tinker, who occasionally visited these mountains to make and repair the tin stiUs used by the peasantry in iUicit distillation, was in the constant habit of destroying fish, and he was represented as being a most suc cessful poacher. I was returning down the river after an unfavourable day, a wearied and a disappointed fisherman, and observed, at a short distance, a man chased across the bogs by several others, and eventuaUy overtaken and secured. It was the unfortunate tinker, sur prised by the keepers in the very act of landing a splendid salmon ; two, recently kiUed, were discovered in his waUet, and yet that blessed day I could not hook a fish ! He was forth with brought in durance before my honour, to undergo the pains and penalties of his crime. He was a strange, raw-boned, wild-looking animal, and I half suspect Sir Walter Scott had seen him before he sketched Watt Tinlin in the ' Lay.' He was a convicted felon \u2014 he had no plea to offer, for he was taken in the very fact. But he made two propositions wherewithal to obtain his liberty \u2014 ' He would never sin again \u2014 or he would fight any two of his captors.' My heart yearned towards him \" Two years after, I was obliged to attend the winter fair of Ball to purchase cattle. It was twilight when I left it, and I had proceeded only a few miles towards a gentleman's house, where I was to dine and sleep, when my horse cast a shoe, and forced me to leave him at a smith's shop, which was fortunately at hand. The evening was chilly, and I determined to proceed on foot, directing my servant to follow. I passed a lonely poteen-house \u2014 several ruf fian-looking fellows were on the road beside it. They were half-drunk and insolent \u2014 I was rash \u2014 words borrowed blows, and I soon dis covered that I should have the worst of the battle, and was tolerably certain of a sound drubbing. Suddenly an unexpected aUy came to my assistance ; he dropped the most formid able of the assaUants as if he had been struck down by a sledge-hammer. A few blows settled the contest ; and I turned round to recognise and thank my dehverer. ' Pon my sowl, you're mighty handy, Master Julius ; it's a murder that ye don't practise oftener !

Such of the party as could strike a walk escaped without difficulty ; but two unhappy gentlemen who were blind drunk, and fast asleep in aU security before the smouldering embers of the still-fire, were captured and conveyed to my loving cousin to undergo the pains and penal ties of their crime. He, as a matter of course, committed them to gaol ; and the next going judge, as another matter of course, will dis charge them. Meanwhile, they are taken from their families, and supported at the expense of the county ; their utility is lost when it is most requisite, and they are, during the term of incarceration, a useless burden upon the community. I cannot see the moral and legal expediency of all this ; but the men who framed the revenue laws were probably more clear-sighted than I am. The covers in the vicinity of the plains are numerous and well supplied with foxes. Of these animals there is no scarcity anywhere in Mayo ; but in the mountain districts there is, unfortunately, a superabundance. The herds man and grouse-shooter complain sadly of their devastations ; and notwithstanding num bers are annually dug out for hunting, or destroyed by the peasantry, there seems to be an anti-Malthusian property in the animal, which enables its mischievous stock, maugre traps and persecution, to increase and multi ply. When I first observed a score of banditti in blue jackets and white cross-belts arranged before the Lodge I felt particularly nervous ; and old John, my refuge in perplexity, was immediately consulted. \" John,\" said I, in a masonic whisper, \" are we safe ? \" \u2014 \" Safe ! from what, Sir?\" \u2014 \"The gauger.\" \u2014 \"Lord, Sir! he dines with us.\" \u2014 \"But \u2014 but is there any stuff about the house?\" \u2014 \"Any!

The gauger ! \u2014 Lord bless you, Sir, he never comes or goes without leaving a keg or two behind him. If the master and he did not pull together, what the devil business would he have here ? Don't mind, Sir ; we know what we are about : Tiggum Tigue Tkigien .'\" f While the country is peculiarly adapted for field sports, the extensive lakes and numerous rivers offer every inducement to the angler : the streams are plentifuUy stocked with trout, and the rivers which communicate with the sea have a good supply of salmon. Curious varieties * of the finny tribe are to be found in the mountain loughs ; and in those noble and expansive sheets of water, Lough Con, Lough Mask, and Lough Corrib, the largest and finest specimens of fish are easily obtained. We have just had a domiciliary visit from the revenue police. Under cover of the night they made a descent upon our vaUeys from their station, some fifteen miles off. Except ing causing dire alarm \u2014 a general abduction of stills, worms, and all the apparatus of the craft, and the concealment of malt, and the burying of kegs \u2014 the consequences of the foray have not been important. One fatal casualty occurred : a distillery had finished its brewing (i.e. distilling the quantity brewed), and prin cipals and accessories were indulging a little after their exertions. Unluckily the revenue stumbled upon the convivial meeting ; and although the stuff -was gone, the still, apparatus, and unextinguished fire, were proofs posi tive that the king \u2014 God bless him \u25a0 \u2014 had Midnight. I hope the weather has settled : the moon looks well, and, as John avers, the sun set favourably. There is, however, one solitary scintillating star \u2014 one ! there are two.

Well, if I rise without a headache, I'll immortalize the man who first invented distillation. disrelishes the inferior amusements of the craft ; the fox-hunter will seldom condescend to ride to beagles ; the deer-stalker will not waste time and powder in a rabbit-warren ; and the disciple of Izaac, who has once indulged in the exquisite delights of salmon fishing, will feel little satisfaction in the commoner pursuits and lesser pleasures of the gentle art. We start under favourable auspices ; a sweet, steady, westerly wind is blowing, clouds and sunshine alternately prevail, the river should be in good order, and we anticipate that this will be a killing day. We landed five salmon, besides taking a pannier full of sea-trouts. Had I been an adept, or better appointed than I was, we might have killed double the number of salmon. My flies were unluckily tied on London hooks, and from their defective quality and formation several fish escaped me. Repeated failures caused me to examine the hooks, and I ascertained that they were both ill-shapen and badly tempered. My cousin had warned me against the conse- quences of using them, but I believed that he was prejudiced, and concluded that this department of my London outfit must be unobjectionable. The event, however, proved that I was deceived. My kinsman rarely lost a salmon, and mine broke from me continu- ally. I find, by sad experience, that in hook- making the Irish are far before us ; our work- men either do not understand the method of forming and tempering hooks, or they do not take sufficient pains in their manufacture. It is strange, when so much of the angler's pleasure and success depends upon the quality of his hooks, that more attention is not bestowed upon their fabrication. The art of forming, and the process of tempering them, appears simple enough ; and that little difficulty is required to attain it is evident from the fact that many fishermen make their own hooks.* For my own part, however, I con- sider hook-making to be an unnecessary ac- complishment for the angler, as the best hooks in the world can be procured without trouble, and at a trifling expense, from O'Shaugh nessy of Limerick. t We have determined to fish the sister stream ; the waters of Goolamore unite in the same estuary with those of our own river, and yet the fish vary with regard to season as much as if they inhabited waters a thousand miles apart. In Goolamore, throughout the whole year, white * salmon are found in high con dition ; in Aughniss, from October till April, the fish are red, spent, and worthless. In size, in character, the streams are much alike : they unite in their debouchement in the sea, and flow but -a few miles asunder, through a flat and moory country. That the fish of these sister streams should differ so much is sur prising, and can only be attributed to one circumstance : Aughniss is a union of moun tain streams, Goolamore flows from an exten sive lake, and affords an outlet to the waters of Carramore. Judging, therefore, from the constant supply of white fish which Goolamore yields all through the year, one would conclude that the lake offers better food and winterage to the salmon than the shallower and colder waters of Aughniss. Our expectations were fully realized, and we found the pools in excellent order. Indepen dently of a west wind being a favourite point for the angler \u2014 in these rivers it blows against the current of the stream, and consequently increases the ruffle on the surface of the water, which, in salmon fishing, is so favourable. My cousin, who is perfectly acquainted with the local haunts of the salmon, placed me where I seldom failed to rise or hook a fish. What splendid angling this wild country offers ! It spoils one in after-life, however.

To those unacquainted with the method of taking salmon, a brief detail may not be uninteresting : premising that in other fisheries different means are employed, yet the simplest and general method is that used at Aughniss. If the season be favourable from the Ist of July to the 1 2th of Angust, the daily average would be probably five hundred salmon, exclusive of an immense quantity of white trouts. But success depends entirely upon the weather. Should the season prove rainy or tempestuous, the salmon directly leaves the estuary, and remain at sea until the water clears and the storm abates , and the time allowed by law often expires before a moiety of the fish can be secured. About March fly-fishing commences, and a strong and active spring fish wUl then fre quently be killed, if the river is sufficiently supplied with water, and the wind brisk and westerly. As the season advances, the fishing materiaUy improves ; and from the month of April, salmon in the highest condition, with red and white trout, wiU rise here freely atthe fly. It is extraordinary how much the flavour and quality of the salmon depend on circum stances apparently of trifling moment. A single day in the river will injure, and a flood spoil their condition ; and the difference between a fish taken in the nets, and one killed with a rod, wUl be easily perceptible. In June, however, the regular fishing with nets commences, and then the wear is raised to stop the passage of the fish, and the river water vented through a small aperture provi ded with a trap, or as it technically called, a box. By these traps and artificial canals, in other fisheries the salmon are principally taken ; but here, except some straggling fish, the box produces little. Although in this water angling may be con sidered as ending in September, yet, through the succeeding months tiU spring, the fish rise freely at a fly. But the sport is very indiffer ent compared with summer angling ; the salmon now has lost his energy ; he struggles laboriously to get away, but his play is different from the gallant resistance he would have offered had you hooked him in July. I have landed and turned out again as many as nine salmon in one day, and their united exertions did not afford me half the amusement I have received from the conquest of one sprightly summer fish. Salmon appear to lose beauty and energy together. They are now reddish, dull, dark-spotted, perch-coloured fish, and seem a different species from the sparkling silvery creatures we saw them when they first left the sea. As an esculent, they are utterly worthless \u2014 soft, flabby, and flavourless, if brought to table ; and instead of the delicate pink hue they exhibited when in condition, they present a sickly, unhealthy, white appear ance, that betrays how complete the change is that they have recently undergone. The fishing is confined to the estuary, where the river meets the sea. Here, according to naturalists, the salmon undergo a probationary course, before they exchange the salt for the fresh water, as a sudden change from either would be fatal to the fish, and a temporary sojourn in water of an intermediate quality (brackish) is supposed to be requisite, before they can leave either the ocean or the river. The draughting is carried on at the last quarter of the ebb, and during the first of flood \u2014 five or six boats, with as many men in each, are necessary. When the salmon are seen, the nearest boat starts off, leaving a man on shore, with a rope attached to one extremity of the net, which is rapidly thrown over, as the boat makes an extensive circle round the place where the fish is supposed to lie. Re- turning to the shore, the curve of the net is gradually decreased. Stones are flung in at each extremity, to prevent the salmon from escaping ; the net reaches the bank, the semicircle is complete, and all within effect- tually secured. The fish are then carefully landed, and at a single draught five hundred salmon have been taken. This is, however, an event of rare occurrence, and unless the net were powerfully strong, and the fishers skilful, a fracture, and consequently a general escape, would be inevitable. And yet at this period they suffer mostly from night-fishers. This species of poaching * is as difficult to detect as it is ruinous in its * \"When I made the tour of that hospitable kingdom in 1754, it (the Coleraine fishery) was rented by a neighbouring gentleman for \u00a3620 a year, who assured me that the tenant, his pre decessor, gave for it \u00a31600 per annum \u2014 and that he was a greater gainer by the bargain, on account of the number of poachers who destroy the fish during the fence month.\" \u2014 Pennant. The fishing here is exceedingly precarious."], [34, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 30 consequences. It is believed that the de struction of a few breeding fish may cost the proprietor one thousand ; such being the astonishing fecundity of the pregnant salmon. have seen taken, I would say, I never saw a fish weighing more than thirty-five pounds, and not many reaching even to twenty-five pounds. Night fishing is carried on when the river is low, and the night moonless. The poacher, with a gaff and torch, selects some gravelly ford \u2014 for there, by a law of nature, the salmon resort to form beds in the stream, wherein to deposit their ova ; and they continue working on the sand, until they are discovered by the torch-light,* and gaffed by the plunderer. Hundreds of the breeding fish are annually thus destroyed ; and although the greater fisheries may be tolerably protected, it is impossible to secure the mountain streams from depredation. If detected, the legal penalty upon poaching is trifling ; and, as appeals on very frivolous grounds are aUowed from the summary convictions of magistrates, it too frequently happens that delinquents evade the punitory consequences attendant on discovery. The Priest, my neighbour, who lives on the banks of Goolamore, told me he once killed a salmon of twenty-seven pounds weight, and that the feat gave him an infinity of trouble, and occupied three mortal hours. The Priest fishes with tackle of amazing strength, and is one of the best practical anglers I have ever met with. Sir Humphry Davy mentions salmon of twenty-five and thirty pounds as being commonly taken with a fly. The largest I ever killed was eighteen pounds four ounces, and it gave me abundant exercise for an hour. Either Sir Humphry overrates the weight of Scottish salmon, or in the rivers he frequented they must be immensely superior to those found in the Irish Waters. In the Shannon, I believe, the largest fish are found, and I am inclined to think, that even there the capture of salmon of this unusual magnitude is an event of very rare occurrence. Here, too, the evils of private distillation may be traced ; for most of the depredations committed upon the salmon are effected by persons concerned in this demoralizing trade. They are up all night attending to the stiU. The watch kept against the revenue police enables them to ascertain when the bargers are away, and the river consequently un guarded. A light is snatched from the still fire, the hidden fish-spear speedily produced, and in a very short space of time an infinite deal of mischief is perpetrated. Pennant states, \" that the largest salmon ever known weighed seventy-four pounds. In September, 1795, one measuring upwards of four feet from nose to taU, and three in circumference, weighing within a few ounces of seventy pounds, was sold at Bulingsgate, and was the largest ever brought there. The Severn salmon are much inferior as to their bulk, for one taken near Shrewsbury, in 1757, weighing only thirty-seven pounds, is recorded in the British Chronologist as exceeding in length any ever known to be taken in that river, and being the heaviest except one ever remembered in that town. They have in many parts been caught by angling, with an artificial fly and other baits, upwards of forty pounds in weight.\" I should be inclined to question the accuracy of weight which Sir Humphry gives his salmon. Fish, of the sizes he describes, are rarely met with here, and out of one thousand taken in the nets, there will not be ten fish of twenty five pounds weight. Passing Grove's shop in Bond-street about a month ago, I remarked an immense fish extended in the window ; I stopped to inquire what its weight might be, and was informed that it weighed forty-five pounds. It had been a little too long on its passage from Scotland, and I should be inclined to say, that at best it was a coarse-flavoured fish, but in its present state a most indifferent one. The average size is from seven to fifteen pounds. Within thirty years, but one monster has been taken ; he weighed fifty-six pounds. Four years ago one of forty-eight pounds was caught : but of the thousands which I * ' ' There are a good many pike in the river near to Trolhatten. In the course of two succes sive days, I once took with my rod sixty-three of those fish ; they were, however, small, their aggregate weight being little more than one hundred pounds. The largest fish weighed eight pounds. Great quantities of pike and other fish, salmon amongst the rest, are speared in the vicinity of Trolhatten by torch-light, many of the people hereabouts being adepts at that amusement.\" \u2014Lloyd. The migratory habits of the salmon, and the instinct with which it periodicaUy revisits its native river, are curious circumstances in the natural history of this fish. As the swallow returns annuaUy to its nest, as certainly the salmon repairs to the same spot in which to"], [35, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 31 deposit its ova. Many interesting experiments have established this fact. M. de Lalande fastened a copper ring round a salmon's tail, and found that for three successive seasons it returned to the same place. Dr. Bloch states that gold and silver rings have been attached by Eastern princes to salmon, to prove that a communication existed between the Persian Gulf and the Caspian and Northern Seas, and that the experiment succeeded. Shaw, in his Zoology, mentions that a salmon of seven pounds and three-quarters was marked with scissors on the back, fin, and tail, and turned out on the 7th of February, and that it was retaken in March of the succeeding year, and found to have increased to the amazing size of seventeen pounds and a half. This state ment, by the by, is at variance with the theory of Dr. Bloch, who estimates the weight of a five or six year old salmon at but ten or twelve pounds. naturalists, that during the period of [spawning the fish neglects feeding. In this peculiar habit the salmon, however, is not singular, for animals of the Phoc\u00e6 tribe in breeding time exercise a similar abstinence. On opening a salmon, at any season, no food wiU be discovered, and the contents, of the stomach will be confined to a smaU quantity of yeUowish fluid and tape-worms, which are generated there. Sir Humphry Davy believes that occasionally food may be found. I have seen thousands opened preparatory to being salted, and I have never observed anything but this fluid and tape-worms. Another circumstance may be stated as a curious proof of health, as weU as of the period of time the salmon has been resident in a river. When the fish leaves the sea, and of course is in its best condition, insects (the Lern\u00e6\u00e6 Salmone\u00e6 of Linn\u00e6us) will be perceived firmly adhering to the skin. Immediately on entering the fresh water, these insects begin to detach themselves from the salmon, and after a short time they graduaUy drop off and disappear. That the salmon should lose condition rapidly on quitting the sea for the fresh water, may be inferred from a fact agreed upon by CHAPTER XI.

While puffing to the cove, we amused ourselves in shooting puffins as they passed us, or trying our rifles at a distant seal, while my kinsman's anecdotes whfled away the tedium of the voyage. \" Seals are very numerous on the coast, and at this season a number may be seen any warm day you make an excursion up the Sound of Achil. We shoot them occasionally \u2014 the skin makes a waterproof covering, and the fat affords an excellent oil for many domestic purposes. It is difficult, however, to secure the animal, for numbers are shot and few gotten. The head is the only place to strike them, for even when mortaUy wounded in the body, they generally manage to escape. This fact we have ascer tained, from finding them dead on shore many days after they were wounded, and .at a con siderable distance from the place where they had received the buUet. I shot one last autumn at the mouth of the river, and a fortnight after wards he was taken up in the neighbourhood of Dhuhill.

At particular seasons the grey mullet visits us abundantly, and nothing can be more delicate, when unin jured by keeping or carriage."], [36, "32 WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. its native element, although the dam rendered all assistance possible to relieve the young one. Having placed their prize in the boat, they were returning, followed by the old seal, who kept rising beside them, attracted by the cries of the cub \u2014 tiU after many bootless attempts, their gun at last exploded, the ball entering the seal's head, and for a moment she appeared dying. The captors, seizing her by the tail and fins, with an united exertion dragged her into the boat \u2014 but this exploit had nearly ended in a tragedy. Stunned only by the wound, the animal instantly recovered, and, irritated by pain and maddened by the cries of her cub, attacked her captors fiercely. Every exertion they could make was necessary to save them from her tusks, and their oars were too long and clumsy to enable them to strike her with effect. I came most oppor tunely to the rescue, and by driving a carbine buUet through the seal's brain brought the battle to a close. Never was the old saw of ' catching a Tartar ' more thoroughly exempH fied; and though we laughed at their terror stricken countenances, the deep incisions made in the oars and gunnels by the tusks of the enraged animal showed that galopading with an angry seal is anything but pleasure.\" unusually small size of fifty-four to the pound, was found lodged in his lungs. Unless when killed outright, they sink instantly ; and I have seen the sea dyed with blood, to an extent that proved how severely the seal had been wounded, but have never been able to trace him further. \" Formerly, when seal oil and skins were valuable, some persons on the coast made the pursuit of the animal a profession. There is one of these persons living near the Sound, a miserable dwarfish red-bearded wretch, whom you would consider hardly equal to grapple with a salmon, and yet he secures more seals than any hunter in the district. His method of effecting it is singular : he uses neither gun nor spear, but kiUs the animal with a short bludgeon loaded at the end with lead. \" Adjacent to the seal-killer's residence there is a large rock uncovered at half-tide, and this appears the most favourite haunt for the animal to bask upon. The rock is easily approached from the main-land, and on a sunny day, when the wind favours the attempt, the hunter, un dressed, and armed with his bludgeon, sUently winds among the stones, and steals upon his sleeping prey. Wary as the creature is, the Red Dwarf seldom faUs in surprising him, and with astonishing expertness generally dispatches him with a single blow. Although the muUet are generaUy first seen here in the month of June, from the wetness of this summer the shoals are later in their appearance than usual. Mullet are taken in draught-nets like salmon, but on this coast a different mode of fishing is pursued. The shoals in hot weather run in with the tide, and after remaining on the shores and estuaries during flood, they return with the ebbing water. The following method we employed in our fishing to-day. Being provided with a suffi cient quantity of herring-nets and a number of spars and poles, we selected at low-water a sandy creek for our operations, and commenced erecting a line of poles across the entrance of the cove. The nets were then extended along these uprights, and also secured firmly to the bottom of the spars ; the lower part of the net is kept upon the bottom by a row of stones, and the remainder laid flat upon the sands. With the flowing tide the fish pass over the prostrate net, and run along the estuary : at high water the buoy -ropes are raised and secured to the upright poles \u2014 and with the assistance of a boat the whole is effected in a few minutes, and a net-work barrier effectually cuts off the retreat of all within. \"When the ebb of tide commences the mullet begin to \" The number he kills annually proves his extraordinary success. If the first blow fails, an event that seldom happens, the dwarf is in considerable danger. When attacked, and especiaUy at such a distance from the water as renders his escape doubtful, the seal will turn with amazing ferocity on the assaUant. If it be an old one, in case his first essay is unsuccessful, the dwarf declines the combat and flies from his irritated enemy ; but the cubs are taken without much difficulty. \" Last summer I was witness to a curious scene. Running through the Sound of Achil in my hooker, at a short distance to leeward I observed several men, who appeared to be practising a quadrille over the thafts and gun nels of a row-boat, as they never rested for a moment, but continued jumping from stem to stem, and springing from bench to bench. Struck by the oddity of their proceedings, I eased away the sheets and ran down upon them \u2014 and I was a welcome ally, as the result proved. It turned out, that having espied a seal and her cub sleeping on the sand, they had procured an old musket and rowed over to attack them. They were partially success ful, and seized the cub before it could regain"], [37, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 33 retire, and when they discover that their egress is obstructed, their attempts to effect a passage are both constant and curious \u2014 now running down the nets, trying for a broken mesh by which to force an aperture \u2014 now with a bold spring endeavouring to clear the buoy-ropes, and, even after repeated failures, leaping at it again and again. The last effort is directed to the bottom ; but there the heavy stones resist every attempt to dislodge them, and, deserted by the treacherous water, the mullet are left upon the bare sands. very unequal to compete with animals of such superior strength and size as mine \u2014 yet the result proved how correctly my wUd companion judged. Our first start was on hard, firm ground \u2014 and here my dogs outstripped my kinsman's, although they displayed uncommon fleetness. Being hard pressed, puss crossed a morass and ran into an unsound bog. Then were my guide's predictions verified. From their own weight, my dogs sank and floundered in the swamp ; while my cousin's topping the surface with apparent ease, turned and killed the hare, while their larger companions were struggling through the mire. As hours must elapse from the time the nets are laid down untd the fish can be secured, I left my kinsman, who officiated as chief engineer. Having brought two brace of greyhounds with us, I set out to course, under the guidance of a man who joined my cousin on the island. On the second start puss left the moor, and took to the sea shore, always a favourite run of island hares. Rushing headlong through rocks, and running over pointed pebbles, the English dogs were speedily disabled. But my cousin's, accustomed to the beach, ran with caution till they cleared the rocks, then taking advantage of the open strand, killed without a scratch, while my unpractised dogs were rendered unserviceable for a fort night. There was a striking air about the stranger, joined to his wild and haggard look, that at once rweted my attention. His clothes were much better than those of any of the peasantry I had yet seen, and in address and manner he was far superior to the rest of my cousin's retainers. He was not above five-and-twenty, his figure taU, gaunt, sinewy, and almost fleshless, \u2014 but his square shoulders and well knit joints proved him to be a powerful and active man. I shall never forget the singular expression of his countenance. It was settled sorrow bordering on despair ; the hollow cheek, the sunken rayless eye, the wandering and suspicious glance around him, all showed a mind fevered with apprehension and harrowed by remorse. He shunned observation, and if my eye met his by accident, he instantly looked another way. He was armed with a new carbine ; and his whole bearing and appearance were so singular and alarming, that more than once I wished my kinsman had allotted me some other guide. Generally speaking, the large and high bred English greyhound is not adapted for Irish coursing. There he wiU encounter a soft and difficult surface, instead of the fine firm downs he has been accustomed to in his native country. And any plains on which he could exert his powers and prove his superiority, are, with few exceptions, in the possession of some pack, and of course pre served as hunting grounds, and greyhounds rigidly prohibited. On returning to the estuary where I had left the fishing-party, I found the tide had faUen, and in a little time we were enabled to secure the spoil. We had enclosed up wards of a hundred mullets, weighing from four to ten pounds each. While embarking our nets and poles I observed several boats filled with men row towards us from a distance ; and, after a short reconnoissance, return to the place from whence they came. The evening breeze blew fresh, and in our favour; the boatman hoisted a large square sail ; my kins man took the tiller, and with wind and tide along with us, in an hour we crossed the bay and reached our destination, accompanied by the tall melancholy looking man, who had been my companion in the island. My companion was, however, shrewd and intelligent \u2014 and he appeared fond of field sports, and perfectly conversant with the arcana of shooting and coursing. He enumer- ated with the science of a connoisseur the points, and praised the beauty of a pair of English dogs I had brought with me ; but told me \" the master's (my kinsman's usual title) would outrun them here.\" I differed with him in opinion. Mine were of distin- guished breeding, the produce of a Swaffham sire, and compared with my cousin's, appeared descended from a giant-stock. His, certainly, were beautiful diminutives ; but as I conceived, We dined sumptuously.

The effect was decisive, for out of a dozen mauraders who formed the crew, not one escaped without receiving a fair proportion ofthe charge. They put about instantly, and for a fortnight after wards, a country quack had fuU employment in extracting my double B. I sent a message to their master, for which he Benched me; and it cost me a cool hundred before I got clear of the Honourable Justices. ' A plague upon aU cowards !

Did you remark several boats approach and reconnoitre us ? \" \" Yes, and what of it ? \" \" Nothing more than that they came with the laudable design of relieving us of the produce of our fishery. The natives believe that there is a prescriptive right to rob mullet nets ; and in consequence, none wiU be at the trouble of laying them down, if they have not a sufficient party to protect the fish when taken. You remarked the formidable pre parations made this morning ; they were requisite I assure you, or we should have returned home as lightly laden as we left it. Those people are not upon my territory, and I am on bad terms with their landlord. They would spofl me of fish without ceremony, and think themselves too indulgent in permitting me and my dependants to return with un damaged heads. Last year they robbed and beat my boatmen cruelly \u2014 and on the next occasion of a muUet chasse, I went in person. They soon discovered us, and with three boats full of men came to despoil us. I warned them off \u2014 but they were resolutely bent on mischief. Finding them determined, I let the leading boat approach within forty yards, and having \"Oh, Hennessy, my foster-brother!

Independently of m salmon and trout fishing, to those who will employ themselves in kiUing pike and perch, the lakes and rivers here offer superior amuse ment. In the greater waters, Lough Mask, Lough Carra, and Lough Conn, the coarser species of fishes are taken in immense numbers, and in the lesser lakes many interesting varie ties of the trout tribe will be found, from the little speckled samlet to the large and curious gillaroo.* * The general length of the common mullet (mugil) is from twelve to eighteen inches. When used immediately after being taken, the fish is excellent ; carriage, even for a short distance, injures it. Dr. Bloch recommends oil and lemon juice to be used with it at table. Vinegar, with parsley and melted butter, is better \u2014 \" probatum est.\" This fish is sometimes preserved by salt ing ; and from its spawn an inferior kind of caviar, called Batargo, is prepared by using the common process of curing and drying. * The natural history of the samlet, or par, is very doubtful. Some assert it to be a mule pro duced by the salmon and trout ; and as a corro-"], [39, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 35 It is true, that the scientific angler generally confines himself to the use of the fly, and for salmon and trout, he will forego the commoner department of bait and float fishing. Hence, angling for pike and perch is usually an amuse ment of the peasantry ; and to those contiguous to the banks of the large lakes, it yields occu pation for idle hours, which might be less innocently dissipated, and occasionally supplies their families with a welcome addition to their unvarying food, the potato. the principal line or back, to keep it buoyant on the surface ; and from a weather-shore, if there be a tolerable breeze, any quantity of hooks and baits can be floated easily across the water. The corks indicate to the fisher men when a fish is on the dropper, and in a small punt or curragh, he attends to remove the spoil and renew the baits when necessary. Two hundred hooks may be used on the same line, and the pooka at times affords much amusement, and often a well-filled pannier. Besides the established system of bait-fish ing, other and more successful methods are resorted to by the lake-fishers. By mesh-nets immense numbers of pike are annually taken ; and with -night-lines and a very simple contriv ance called the pooka, these fish, with the largest trout and perch, are constantly killed. There are no waters in Great Britain, with the exception of the river Shannon, where larger pike * are caught than those taken in Loughs Mask and Corrib. It would appear, that in these lakes the fish are commensurate \u25a0 to the waters they inhabit. It is no unusual event for pikes of thirty pounds weight to be sent to their landlords by the tenants ; and fish of even fifty pounds have not unfrequently been caught with nets and night-lines. The trout in those loughs are also immensely large. From five to fifteen pounds is no unusual size, and some have been found that have reached the enormous weight of thirty. The perch tribe appear the smallest in the scale of rela- tive proportion. These seldom exceed a her- ring size ; but they, too, have exceptions, and perch of three or four pounds weight have been sometimes seen. Within fifty years, this latter fish has increased prodigiously, and, in the lakes and rivers where they abound, trout have been found to diminish in an equal ratio. If any doubt remained touching the fecundity of the perch, some of the Mayo waters would prove it satisfactorily. Half a century since, I have been assured that pike and perch were almost unknown in the rivers of Belcarra and This latter implement is formed of a piece of flat board, having a little mast and sail erected on it. Its use is to carry out the ex tremity of a long line of considerable stoutness, to which, at regulated distances, an infinity of droppers or links are suspended, each armed with a hook and bait. Corks are affixed to boration of this theory, it is stated that the rivers where the par is found are always re- sorted to by salmon. Others conjecture it to be a hybrid of the sea and river trout ; and Sir Humphry Davy mentions, that fishing in \u00a9ctober, in a small stream communicating with the Moy, near Ballina, he caught a number of sea trout, who all proved males, and accordingly infers that \" these fish, in which the spermatic system was fully developed, could only have impregnated the ova of the common river trout. \" The par differs from the small mountain trout in colour, and in having additional spines in the pectoral fin. It has also certain olive bluish marks upon the side, similar to the im- pressions made by the pressure of a man's fingers. Great numbers of salmon are found in the upper streams of the Ballycroy river. They will rise voraciously at a fly, provided it be gay and small enough. I remember my friend Sir Charles Cuyler and I amused ourselves on a blank shooting-day, when there was neither a sufficiency of wind nor water to warrant salmon- fishing, in angling for this hybridous diminutive. We nearly filled our basket; we reckoned them, and they amounted to above two hundred. Pennant says : \u2014 \" In all these lakes the gilla- roo is found. It varies in weight from twelve to eighteen pounds, but sometimes reaches thirty ; \" and Daniel states these fish to be \"esteemed for their fine flavour, which is supposed to exceed that of any other trout. Their make is similar to the common, except being thicker in proportion to their length, and of a redder hue, both before and after being dressed. The gilla roo is remarkable for having a gizzard resem- bling that of a large fowl or turkey.\" He also says : \u2014 \" It is usual to dress the gizzards only, which are considered as very favourite morsels.\" * About seventeen years since, when visiting the late Marquis of Clanricarde, at Portumna Castle, two gentlemen brought to the marquis an immense pike, which they had just caught in the river Shannon, on the banks of which they had been taking their evening walk. Attracted by a noise and splashing of the water, they discovered in a little creek a number of perch driven on shore, and a fish, which, in pursuit of them, had so entangled himself with the ground, as to have a great part of his body exposed, and out of water. They attacked him with an oar, that by accident lay on the bank, and killed him. Never having seen any fish of this species so large, they judged it worth the observation of the marquis, who, equally sur prised at its magnitude, had it weighed, and to our astonishment it exceeded the balance at ninety -two pounds; its length was such, that when carried across the oar by the two gentle men, who were neither of them short, the head and tail touched the ground.' C 2"], [40, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 36 quently discovered. Many of them are said to afford beautiful specimens of this valuable gem. The smaller lakes, which are so profusely scattered over the surface of this country, vary in the species of fish which they respectively produce, as much as they do in their own natural size and character. Some of them afford trout, others pike only, and many are stocked with both. That this union cannot long subsist, I should be inclined to infer from one remarkable circumstance, and it is a con vincing proof of the rapid destruction which the introduction of pike into a trout lake will occasion. Within a short distance of Castlebar, there is a small bog-lake, called Derreens ; and ten years ago it was celebrated for its numerous and well-sized trout. Accidentally pike effected a passage into the Lough from the Minola river, and now the trout are ex tinct, or, at least, none of them are caught or seen. Previous to the intrusion of the pike, half-a-dozen trout would be killed in an eve ning in Derreens, whose collective weight often amounted to twenty pounds. Minola, and the chain of lakes with which they communicate, and that these waters were then second to none for trout fishing. Within ten years, my cousin tells me that he often angled in them, and that he frequently killed from three to six dozen of beautiful middle-sized red trout. Now, fly-fishing is seldom prac tised there. The trout is nearly extinct, and quantities of pike and perch infest every pool and stream. The simplest methods of taking fish will be here found successful, and the lakes of Westmeath will soon be rivalled by the loughs of Mayo.* Of the great Western lakes, Conn and Carra belong to Mayo ; Corvib to Galway ; and Mask lies between both counties. The most northerly, Lough Conn, is about nine miles long, by two or three in breadth. Part of its shores are beautifully wooded ; and where the lower and upper lakes unite, the channel is crossed by a bridge of one arch, called the Pontoon ; and there the scenery is indeed magnificent. ' Lough Carra is smaller than Conn ; but, as a sheet of water, nothing can be more beauti ful ; and everything that the painter delights to fancy may here be realized. Islands and peninsulas, with rich overhanging woods, a boundless range of mountain masses in the dis tance, and ruins in excellent keeping \u2014 all these form a splendid study for the artist's pencil. Indeed, few of the Mayo waters are secure from the encroachments of the pike. The lakes of Castlebar, I believe, still retain their ancient character ; * but I understand that pike have been latterly taken in the Turlogh river, and of course they will soon appear in a lake which directly communicates with this stream. f Mask communicates with Carra, and their united waters discharge themselves into Lough Corrib by a very curious subterraneous channel at Congf. Lough Corrib is largest of all ; it stretches twenty miles to its southern extremity at Galway, where, through a bold, rocky river, it discharges its waters into the Atlantic. Its breadth is very variable, ranging from two to twelve miles. Besides its singular connexion with the Mayo lakes by the underground channel at Cong, Lough Corrib produces a rare species of muscle, in which pearls are fre- * \" In the lake of Castlebar, near that town, is the charr and the gillaroo trout, and it is remarked that there are no pike in this and some of the adjacent lakes.\" \u2014 Daniel. f The voracity of the pike is strongly exem plified in the following extract from a Provincial Newspaper. Of the truth of the occurrence we presume there can be no reasonable doubt, even in the minds of the most sceptical ; but we believe there is no instance of animal ferocity on record which could parallel it, except in the celebrated case of Kilkenny cats, whose respec tive demolition of each other is as wonderful as authentic. \" A party angling at Sunbury, one of them sat across the head of the boat, as a punishment inflicted on him for wearing his spurs. Another, having caught a gudgeon, stuck it on one of the spurs, which he (the delinquent in the bow) not perceiving, in a few minutes a large jack bit at the gudgeon, and the spur being crane-necked, entangled in the gills of the jack, which, in attempting to extricate himself, actually pulled the unfortunate person out of the boat. He was with difficulty dragged on shore, and the fish taken, which was of prodigious size.\" Now, after this cautionary notice of ours, we do assert that any gentleman who goes to fish in crane-necks, and disposes of his legs overboard, with a gudgeon on the rowel, is not exactly the person on whose life, were we agent to a com pany, we should feel justified in effecting a policy of insurance. * Mr. Young mentions that, at Packenham, Lord Longford informed him, respecting the quantities of fish in the lakes in his neighbour hood, that the perch were so numerous, that a child with a packthread and a crooked pin would catch enough in an hour for the daily use of a whole family, and that his Lordship had seen five hundred children fishing at the same time ; that, besides perch, the lake produced pike five feet long, and trout of ten pounds each. f \" At Cong, about five miles from Ballinrobe, is a subterranean cave, tc which there is a descent of sixty-three steps, called the Pigeon Hole ; at the bottom runs a clear stream, in which the trout are seen sporting in the water ; these fish are never known to take a bait, but are caught with landing-nets.\" \u2014 Daniel."], [41, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 37 CHAPTER XIII.

An unusual commotion was evident among my kinsman's household, and there was a wondrous packing up of camp-beds, culinary utensils, baskets and bottles, arms and ammu nition \u2014 in short, of every necessary article for the support and destruction of life. At dawn of day four horses set off heavily laden ; shortly after, a second division of dogs and guns moved under a careful escort; the \"otter hunter\" hobbled off while I was dressing; and the piper, the lightest laden of all con cerned, closed the rear. After breakfast, two ponies were brought to the door, and, with a mounted attendant to carry our cloaks, my cousin and I pursued the same route that the baggage had already taken. To arrive at our mountain-quarters we were obliged to cross the river repeatedly. When swollen with rain, the stream is impassable, and the communication between the hill country and the lowlands interrupted, until the flood abates. At one of the fords, my kinsman pointed out a little cairn, or heap of stones, erected on the summit of a hillock which overhung the passage we were crossing. It is placed there to commemorate the drown ing of a shepherd, and, as an incident in humble life, it struck me as being particularly affecting. \" In 1822, when the western part of Ireland was, afflicted with grievous famine, and when England stepped forward nobly, and poured forth her thousands to save those who were perishing from want, a depot of provisions was established on the sea-coast, for the relief of the suffering inhabitants of this remote district. Talk not of India ! Its boasted gang of servants is far surpass ed by the eternal troop of followers appertaining to an Irish establish- ment. Old John tells me that sixteen regulars sit down to dinner in the servants'-hall, and that at least an equal number of supernumer- aries are daily provided for besides. When I hinted to my cousin the expense that must at- tend the supporting of this idle and useless multitude, his reply was so Irish. \" Pshaw ! hang it ! \u2014 sure they have no wages, and what the devil signifies all they eat? My father, before the landing of the Paul Jones, fed two hundred men for a fortnight, and used to declare, that never were there such plentiful times. It killed the cook, however, poor woman ! she was literally broiled into a pleurisy \u2014 but such a wake as she had ! I remember it as if it occurred but yesterday. She was carried to the old grave-yard of Bunmore the very evening the Paul Jones landed her cargo, and although five hundred men left the house with the corpse, the cook remained over-ground till the following morning, for want of sufficient persons to fill the grave. The fact was, that just as the funeral reached the church-yard, the lugger was suddenly discovered rounding the Black Rock. Instantly the mourners absconded, the bearers threw down the body \u2014 the priest, who was deeply concerned in the cargo, was the first to fly ; \u2014 and the defunct cook was left accordingly in peaceable posses sion of Bunmore.\" \" A solitary family, who had been driven from their lowland home by the severity of a relentless middle-man, had settled themselves in this wild valley, and erected the clay walls of that ruined hut before you. The man was shepherd to a farmer who kept cattle on these mountains. Here, in this savage retreat, he lived removed from the world, for the nearest cabin to this spot is more than four miles distant. \"It may be supposed that the general dis tress afflicted this isolated family. The wel come news ofthe arrival of succours at Ballycroy at length reached them, and the herdsman set out to procure some of the committee meal to relieve the hunger of his half-starved family. \"On arriving at the depot, the stock of meal was nearly expended : however, he obtained a temporary supply, and was comforted with the assurance that a large quantity was hourly expected. ' ' Anxious to bring the means of sustenance to his suffering little ones, the herdsman crossed the mountain with his precious burden, and reached that hillock where the stones are loosely piled. \"But during his absence at Ballycroy, the rain had fallen heavily in the hills ; the river was no longer fordable, a furious torrent of"], [42, "38 WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. discoloured water rushed from the heights, and choked the narrow channel. There stood the returning parent, within twenty paces of his wretched but dearly loved hovel. The children with a cry of delight rushed from the hut to the opposite bank to welcome him ; but, terrified by the fearful appearance of the flood, his wife entreated him not to attempt its passage for the present. after \" blowing a comfortable cloud,\" went to bed and slept ; but a man must exercise and carouse with a grouse-shooter, to conceive the deep and delicious repose which attends the sportsman's pillow. This morning we were early astir. There was a mutual admission of slight headache, but coffee and fresh air will soon remove it. Having finished breakfast, and, in spite of Sir Humphry's denunciations, fortified ourselves against damp feet with a glass of Mareschino, we left the cabin for the moors. \" But would he, a powerful and experienced swimmer, be deterred ? The eager and hungry looks of his expecting family maddened the unhappy father. He threw aside his clothes, bound them with the meal upon his back, crossed himself devoutly, and, ' in the name of God,' committed himself to the swollen river. Never was there a wilder spot than the dell in which we have taken up our shooting quarters. It is a herdsman's hovel, to which my kinsman has added an apartment for his accommodation in the grouse season. This is our banquet-room and dormitory ; a press in the corner contains our various drinkables, and upon a host of pegs, stuck into the interstices of the masonry, hang guns and belts, and all the unmentionable apparatus of a sportsman. The cabin itself is appropriated to culinary purposes, and to the accommodation of our dogs and personal attendants. The quadrupeds are quartered in the farther extremity of the house, and, after their fatigue, luxuriate gloriously upon a fresh bed of sun-dried fern. \" For a moment he breasted the torrent gallantly \u2014 two strokes more would bring him to the bank \u2014 when the treacherous load turned, caught him round the neck, swept him down the stream, sank, and drowned him. He struggled hard for life. His wife and children followed the unhappy man as he was borne away \u2014 and their agonizing shrieks told him, poor wretch ! that assistance from them was hopeless. At last the body disappeared, and was taken up the following morning four miles from the fatal place. One curious circumstance attended this calamity : to philosophers I leave its elucidation, while I pledge myself for its accuracy in point of fact. A herd of cattle galloped madly down the river-side at the time their unfortunatekeeperwasperishing; theirbel lowings were heard for miles, and they were dis covered next morning, grouped around the body of the dead shepherd, in the comer of a sandy cove, where there the abated flood had left it.\" In a calliogh * beside the fire, the keeper and old John, who officiates as cook, are deposited at night, while the otter-hunter and piper canton themselves in the opposite den. A detachment of boys, or irregulars, who have followed the master to the mountains, bivouac somewhere in the vicinity of the cabin. In a sod-walled sheeling erected against a huge rock, the herdsman and his family have taken up their temporary residence, while we occupy the hut ; but its limited dimensions would be quite unequal to shelter a moiety of our exten sive train. But while a mountain sheep hangs from \"the couples \"t of the cabin, and the Every one shoots grouse ; the operation is so commonplace that none but a cockney would find novelty in its detail. Our morning's sport was excellent. The dogs were in good working condition, and under perfect com mand ; but at noon the breeze died away, the day became oppressively hot, and the biting of gnats and horse-flies intolerable. Not being exterminators, we ceased shooting at three o'clock, and returned to our cabin with two and-'wenty brace of birds. \u00bb \" Callioghs \" are recesses built in the side walls of an Irish cabin, convenient to the hearth, and sufficiently large to contain a bed. Some of them are quite open to the fire ; while others are partially screened from view by a rude matting of bent or straw. If you enter a peasant's hovel on a wet day, and inquire for the owner of the house, a strap ping boy will generally roll out of one of these dark cribs, yawn, stretch his arms, scratch his head, and bid \"your honour\" welcome, and then inform you that he \" was just strichin' on the bed.\" The particulars of the evening compotation I shall be excused in passing over. I must allow that the portion of wine allotted to sportsmen by the Author of Salmonia was awfully exceeded. We anointed our faces with cold cream, which speedily removed the pain and inflammation consequent on the stinging we had endured from the insects, and, t The couples are the principal timbers that support the roof ; they are placed at stated dis tances, and an Irishman describes the size of a house by telling you that it has so many \" couples.\""], [43, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 39 whisky-keg continues unexhausted, those worthies matter Uttle in what cranny they ensconce themselves at night. To a late hour the piper is in requisition, and these careless devils dance, and laugh, and sing, until my cousin's mandate scatters them like ghosts at cock-crow ; off they scamper, and where they bestow themselves till morning none but them selves can tell. Although the quantity of whislcy consumed here, in the short space of three days, appears almost incredible ; yet upon those seasoned vessels its effects are so very transitory as almost to authenticate the boasted virtues of the mountain-dew \u2014 \"that there is not an aching head in a hogshead fuU ! \" of bringing down the gallant beast, would have been a species of useless mischief, merit ing a full month upon the tread-mill. I gazed after him as he gradually increased his distance ; his antlers were expanded as fully as my arms would extend ; his height was magnificent ; and, compared with fallow-deer, he seemed a giant to a dwarf. The sun beamed upon his deep bay side, as he continued describing a circular course over the flat surface of the moor, till reaching a rocky opening leading to the upper hills, he plunged into the ravine, and we lost sight of him. What could have driven the red deer so low upon the heath was marvellous. Excepting when disturbed by a solitary hunter, or a herdsmen in pursuit of errant cattle, or driven from the summit of the hills by snow and storm, those deer are rarely seen below the Alpine heights they inhabit. But the leisure pace of the beautiful animal we saw to-day, proved that he had not been alarmed in his lair, and led one almost to fancy, that in freakish mood he had abandoned his mountain home to take a passing glance at the men and things beneath him. While traversing a low range of moors, an incident occurred which at this season was unaccountable. A red and white setter pointed at the top of a little glen. The heathy banks on both sides of a mountain rivulet undulated gently from the stream, and caused a dipping of the surface ; and the ground seemed a favourable haunt for grouse, and our dogs were beating it with care. Observing the setter drop, his companions backed and remained steady, when suddenly Hero rose from his couchant attitude, and next moment a wild deer, of enormous size and splendid beauty, crossed before the dog and sprang the birds he had been pointing. The apparition of the animal, so little expected, and so singu larly and closely introduced to bur view, oc casioned a sensation I had never hitherto experienced. I rushed up the bank, while, unembarrassed by our presence, the noble deer swept past us in a light and graceful canter, at the short distance of some seventy or eighty yards. I might have fired at and annoyed him \u2014 but on a creature so powerful, small shot could have produced little effect, and none but a Cockney, under similar circumstances, would waste a charge ; and to tease, without a chance At five o'clock we left the moors, and re turned to our cabin. The day throughout had been propitious ; the breeze tempered the heat which yesterday oppressed us, and our walk this morning had been only pleasant exercise. We were neither exhausted by an ardent sky, nor annoyed by the dazzling glare of constant sunshine. The gnats, which lately had been intolerable, had vanished, and we were thus enabled to perform our ablutions in the clear and sparkling river ; a feat last night impracticable, from the number and virulence of the insects. He who has bathed his limbs in the cool and crystal waters of a mountain stream after a busy day upon the heath, can only estimate its luxury. Twenty brace of grouse, three hares, and a half score of gray plovers, was the produce of our chasse. CHAPTER XrV.

She rose at last ; Badger griped her, and down went dog and otter. They remained so long under water, that I was greatly afraid the dog was drowmed ; but, after a while, up came Badger. Though I was right glad to see my dog, I did not like to lose the beast ; and I knew from the way that Badger's jaws were torn, that there had been a wicked struggle at the botlom. \"Well, I encouraged the dog, and when he had got his breath again, he dived down nothing daunted, for he was the best tarrier ever poor man was master of. Long as he had been before at the bottom, he was twice longer now. The sur- face bubbled, the mud rose, and the water became black as ink : ' Ogh ! murder,' says I, ' Badger, have I lost ye ? ' and I set-to clapping my hands for trouble, and Venom setup the howl as if her heart was broke. When, blessed be the Maker of all ! up comes Badger with the otter griped by the neck. The bitch swam over to help him, and I waded to the middle, and speared and landed the beast. Well, then I examined her, she had her mouth full of ould roots and moss, for she had fastened on a stump at the bottom, and the poor dog was sorely put-to to make her break her hold. I mind it well : I sold the skin in Galway, and got a gold guinea for it.\" My kinsman and I having duly executed a jig with a brace of Nora Crinas, left the hut and strolled a short way up the river. The quiet of \"lonely night \" contrasted strikingly with the scene of turbulent and vivacious mirth we had but just quitted. A jutting bank suddenly shut the cabin from our view, and its lights and music ceased to be seen or heard. A deep unbroken silence reigned around. The moon's disc appeared of unusual size, as she rose in cloudless majesty over the mountain masses which earlier in the evening had con cealed her. Not a cloud was in the sky, aud the unequal outline of the hills displayed a fine picture of light and shadow \u2014 and the stream rippled at our feet, as, \" tipped with silver,\" we traced its wanderings for miles, while its sparkling current was lost or seen among the moor-land. Just then a human figure turned the rock abruptly, and the old Otter-killer stood beside us. The rushing of the stream prevented us from noticing his approach. He had been examining his traps, and as the way was rugged, he had been delayed till now. The old man's appearance in this place, and at that hour, was picturesque. His dark dress, his long white hair falling down his shoulders, the seal-skin wallet, the fish-spear, and the rough terrier his companion, all were in perfect keeping. \" Well, Antony, what sport ? \" \" Little to speak of, Master Julius. I sus pect the trap wants oiling, for there was an otter's spraints * every place about it. I went to the lake yonder, and while the breeze kept up the fish took well. I killed a dozen red trout.\" \" Was that the night you met the fairies ? \" \" Stay, Master Julius ; I'm coming to that. Well, three otters were a heavy load, and I had four long miles to travel before I could reach Morteein Crassagh's.* The master knows the house well. The night was getting dark, and it's the worst ground in Connaught. Well, I was within a mile of Morteein's, when it became as black as pitch ; and I had the shaking bog to cross, that you can hardly pass in daytime, where, if a man missed his way, he would be swallowed up in a moment. The rain began, and the poor dogs were famished with cold and hunger. God ! I was sure I must stay there, starving till the morning ; when on a sudden, little lights danced before me, and showed me the hard tammocks as plain as if the sun was up. I was in a cruel \" Did you meet any of the ' gentle- folk,' \\ friend Antony ?

I was afraid to stay where I was, as I knew the gentle-people were about me ; and I was unwilling to attempt the quagh,* for fear the light would leave me, and then I would get neither back nor forward. Well, the wind began to rise ; the rain grew worse ; I got desperate, and resolved to speak to the fairies civilly. ' Gentlemen and ladies,' says I, making a bow to the place where the lights were dancing, ' maybe ye would be so obliging as to light me across the bog.' In a minute there was a blaze from one end of the quagh to the other, and a hundred lights were flashing over the bogs. I took heart and ven tured ; and wherever I put my foot, the place was as bright as day, and I crossed the swamp as safely as if I had been walking on a gravel led road. Every inch the light came with me, till I reached the boreeinf leading to Mor teein Crassagh's ; then, turning about, I made the fairies a low bow : ' Gentlemen and ladies,' says I, ' I'm humbly thankful for your civility, and I wish ye now a merry night of it.' God preserve us ! The words were hardly out, when there was a roar of laughter above, below, and around me. The lights vanished, and it became at once so dark, that I could scarcely make out my way. When I got fairly inside Morteein's kitchen, I fainted dead ; and when I came to, I told them what had happened. Many a time, fairy candles are seen at Lough na Mucka ; but sorrow mortal was ever lighted across the quagh by the gentle-people but my self, and that the country knows. Well \u2014 the master is laughing at me ; but I'll hobble to the cabin, or they'll think that the good people have carried me off at last, as they did Shamus Bollogh,^ from Ballycroy. \u00a7 Presently we returned to the hut; the whisky had begun to operate on the corps de ballet in the kitchen, for the pipes played louder, and the girls danced with additional esprit. To think of bed, with such a company beside us, would be idle : my cousin accord ingly recharged his meerschaum, and, between many a puff, gave me the following memoir of the otter-hunter. \"The old man is a character. In his early days he was a travelling pedlar, a dealer in furs and Connemara stockings. He had always an unconquerable fancy for angling and otter killing ; and, with a pack upon his shoulders and a fish spear in his hand, he traversed the kingdom in the double pursuit of pleasure and profit. \" When he disposed of his merchandise, he returned home laden with the skins he had collected in his wanderings. He has frequently brought thirty furs together to Limerick for sale ; and as they were then a valuable com modity, he acquired in a few years a consider able property. \" In one of his excursions, however, Antony managed to pick up a wife. She was young and handsome ; and, tiring of his unsettled life, persuaded the unhappy otter-killer to forego his favourite calling, and turn his fish spear into a spigot. In short, he took a house in town, became a publican, got extensive business, gave credit, and soon was drunken and embarrassed ; his wife flirted, his property melted away, and his frail rib at last levanted with an English showman. Antony was as tounded, but he bore misfortune like a philo sopher. Renouncing whisky, except in limited quantities, he resumed the otter-trap, which had been rusting in a garret ; and one fine moonlight night, turned the key in the door, abandoned goods and chattels to the landlord, and disappeared, 'leaving his curse with Limerick.' * A morass. t A horsepath leading into bogs. + fames the Stutterer. 5* This gentleman's temporary sojourn with the fairies is generally credited in Ballycroy. Why the gentlefolk, who are accounted scrupu lous in selecting youth and beauty when they abduct mortals, should have pitched upon Shamus, is unaccountable. His charms are of the plainest order, and he had long passed his teens before the period of his being carried away. His own account of the transaction is but a confused one \u2014 and all I recollect of the particulars is, that he crossed to Tallaghan, over an arm of the sea, on a grey horse, behind a little man dressed in green. Neither good nor evil resulted from this nocturnal gallop of \" the Stutterer,\" if we except a sound horse-whipping which he received from the priest, for attempt ing to abuse the credulity of the peasantry, by detailing the fairy revels in which he alleged that he participated. \" No Bedouin returned from captivity to his parent's tent \u2014 nd Swiss revisited his native valley, with more delight, than the cornuted otter-killer, when he hurried back to his beloved mountains. From that moment he forswore the town ; and, excepting on his annual visit to the furrier, Antony has avoided the busier haunts of mankind. Having added bleeding to the number of his acquirements, he practices pharmacy in this wilderness, and for forty years has led a careless, migratory life, tolerated in the hall, and welcomed in the cabin, until increasing years and bodily infir-"], [46, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 42 mity confined him to his wild birth-place, where the otter can be trapped without fatigue, and the salmon will yet reward the old man's skill.

The piper's music appeared in exhaustible, and, maugre fatigue and whisky, the company were as fresh and effective as when the ball commenced. \" I must rout them,\" said my cousin; \"the devils would dance till doomsday.\" He opened the door, but stopped and beckoned me to approach. I looked out ; the boys and girls had left the floor, the men settling themselves on the colliaghs, empty casks, and turf cleaves,* while the ladies were comfortably accommodated upon their partners' knees. One gentleman alone was standing. Presently two sticks were laid crosswise on the ground ; the pipes struck up an unusual sort of jig, and the feat commenced. \"This,\" said my kinsman, \"is called the ' pater-o-pee,' and none but an accomplished dancer would attempt it.\" \" But it is not as a hunter and leech that the ancient otter-killer is alone valuable. In his wanderings, he picked up tales and traditions among the wild people he consorted with : his memory is most tenacious, and he narrates strange legends which, in wildness and ima gination, rival the romances of the East. In winter, when the snow falls and the fury of the storm is unloosed, Antony is settled in his rude but comfortable chair, formed of twisted bent. The women of my household listen to his love-stories with affected indifference, but there is always some apology for remaining near the otter-killer. At times, when the old man is summoned after dinner to receive his customary glass, I, if I be ' V the humour,' listen to his wild legends ; and here, in this mountain-hut, seated in this room, ' mine own great chamber,' while I luxuriate over a bright bog-deal fire, an exquisite cigar, and an admix ture of pure hollands with the crystal water that falls from the rock behind us, I listen in voluptuous tranquillity to Antony's romances, as he recites to his attentive auditory in the kitchen his narratives of former times. To describe this dance would be impossible : it consisted of an eternal hopping into the small compartments formed by the crossing of the cudgels on the floor, without touching the sticks. Now, holding reasonable doubts whether, upon Mr. Cooney presenting himself to Mon sieur Laporte, this gentleman would savour him with an engagement, I'll bet the manager, notwithstanding, a cool hundred, that, on the strength of the King's Theatre, he has no artiste who will touch Tim Cooney at the pater-o-pee .' \" If the otter-hunter's tales be true, the primitive gentlewomen of the Emerald Isle were no vestals ; and the judge of the Consistorial Court, had such then existed, CHAPTER XV.

The gentle and sparkling stream, on whose moonlight banks I had been musing at midnight, disappeared, and a fierce and turbulent body of discoloured water rushed through its swollen channel, bearing along huge portions of the banks, which had yielded to its fury. \"We are fairly caught, Frank,\" said my kinsman. \"Hemmed in by the stream, if life depended on it, we could not now communicate with the Lodge.

Ha ! there is a bustle in the outer cabin ; no doubt an arrival. It is the messenger. but more circuitous route was abandoned by the young peasant, who hoped, by directly croaking the heights, to arrive at the cabin before the night shut in. He took his perilous direction accordingly ; but the rain was still falling fast, and when he topped the ridge of the hills, the valley beneath was covered by a dense mist. Presently the mountain streams rose, the light failed \u2014 to advance or retreat was impossible ; and the isolated peasant had no choice left but to seek a shelter in the rocks, and remain there until morning dawned. He easily discovered a fissure in the steep bank above the river, crept in \u2014 \" blessed himself\" \u2014 and lay down to sleep upon his cold and rugged bed. I never saw finer samples of the mountain peasantry than this man and his brother exhibit. They are scarcely to be known asunder ; young, particularly handsome, five feet eleven inches, light, active, clean-limbed, perfect specimens of strength and symmetry combined ; good humoured, indefatigable, and obliging, sub missive to the Master's nod, and yet the boldest and handiest boys in Ballycroy. I sometimes look after my kinsman as he strides over the moors with his handsome henchmen at his back. He walks as if the province was his own ; bold, and careless, and confident \u2014 no wonder \u2014 those wild fellows are his fosterers, and they would shed the last drop of their blood for \" the Master,\" if he required it. What situation could be more desolate and heart-sinking than this ? Imprisoned among savage mountains, perched in a wild rock far above the rest of mankind, separated from human help by an impassable torrent, cold, hungry, and exhausted ; yet all these dejecting circumstances were unheeded by the hardy mountaineer. He had but one source of terror ; the otter-hunter had often described this glen as a favourite haunt of fairies; and \"what would become of him if the gentle-people caught him there ? \" This fidelity and devotion on the one side, is requited by kindness and protection on the other. These men have lived about the Lodge from boyhood \u2014 and they come and depart as they please. At spring and harvest-times they repair to the village where their parents reside, to assist the old couple and the girls in getting the potatoes in and out of ground ; they tend the cattle in the mountains when requisite, and pass the remainder of the year following the Master to the moors or to the river, catching fish, netting rabbits, or killing wild-fowl in the winter ; and dancing, drinking, and fighting on holidays and festivals, as becomes good men and loyal subjects. The midnight hour passed, however, with out any supernatural visitation. No fairy revelry disturbed the peasant's slumbers ; the rain ceased ; the flood was falling ; the chough * and raven were preparing to take wing ; and while the first faint light was breaking through the mountain mists, Cormac, anxious to quit his cheerless bivouac, crawled out from his cold retreat. When they marry \u2014 for Malthus and restric tions upon population are no more recognised in Erris, than the Pope is \u2022 by a modern Methodist \u2014 they will obtain a patch of moun tain from their patron, erect a cabin, construct a still, and setting political dogmas at defiance, then and there produce most excellent whisky, and add to the \"seven millions \" considerably. Suddenly, from above, an indistinct noise alarmed him. Feet clattering down the rocky path ; a rush, a snorting, announced their near approach, and a herd of deer appeared within half a stone's cast. They traversed the narrow track in single files, and were moving rapidly down the mountain side to browse in the glen beneath. The messenger presented himself with the post-bag, being anxious to render a personal account of the causes of his delay. His night's adventure is quite characteristic of the wild life, and bold and reckless spirit of these mountain peasants. When the leading stag discovered the startled peasant, he halted, tossed his antlers wildly, and gave a loud and peculiar neigh. The pause, The route to the next post-town lies through the ridge of hills which I have already de scribed, as bounding the valley where we are quartered.

The panic lasted but an instant : they turned round, and with amazing speed rushed up the hill, regained the heights, and were lost in the thick mist. Cormac could not reckon them accurately, but imagined their number to be about sixteen. Individual exertions to continue the red deer are found to be of little use. They seldom breed when deprived of liberty, and restricted to the inclosures of a park. If they do, the offspring degenerates, and the produce is very inferior in size to what it would have been, had the animal remained in its state of natural freedom. Even when taken young in the It 'is seldom, now, that the red deer are seen in herds. Within late years they have diminished sadly, and unless vigorous means are promptly adopted; to prevent their de struction by poachers, like their ancient enemy, the rough Irish greyhound, they too will become extinct. My cousin, when a boy, has often met forty deer herded together ; but, from their decreased numbers, one rarely sees now more than a few brace. Since the French descent upon this coast in Ninety-eight, their destruction has been rapid. Unfortunately, many of the fire-arms then distributed among the peasantry, remain in their possession still, and in the winter months, when the severity of the season forces the deer to leave the hills and seek food and shelter in the valleys, idle ruffians, too well acquainted with the passes of the moun tains, take that opportunity to surprise and slaughter them. him to death, which his great strength enables him to do with ease, \"\u25a0 M. Buffon supposes the great Danish dog to be only a variety of the Irish greyhound ; and Mr. Pennant was of opinion that the French matin and the Albanian dog were also varieties of the same. \" The Irish greyhound is now rarely to be met with, even in his native country. \" The Marquis of Sligo is among the few individuals who possess that fine animal in a state of tolerable purity ; he keeps a number at Westport, in the county of Mayo, Ireland, where there is a person employed to look after them. It is said that great care is necessary to preserve the breed, and keep them in good health, \" Aylmer Bourke Lambert, Esq., one of the vice-presidents of the Linn\u00e6an Society, took the measure of one of the Marquis of Sligo's dogs, which was as follows : \u2014 ' From the point of the nose to the tip of the tail, sixty-one inches ; tail, seventeen and a half inches long ; from the tip of the nose to the back part of the skull, ten inches ; from the back part of the skull to the beginning of the tail, thirty-three inches ; from the toe to the top of the fore shoulder, twenty-eight inches and a half; the length of the leg, sixteen inches ; from the point of the hind toes to the top of the hind shoulder, thirteen inches ; from the point of the nose to the eye, four inches and a half; the ears, six inches long ; round the widest part of the belly, (about three inches from the fore legs), thirty five inches ; twenty-six inches round the hind part, close to the hind legs ; the hair short and smooth ; the colour of some brown and white, of others black and white, ' There are many circumstances connected with this scarce and beautiful species, that should render their preservation a matter of national interest. They are the last relic of other times ; and all besides of the once famed stock which tenanted the Irish forests have disappeared. The wolf, the morse-deer, the greyhound,* exist no longer; and this noble * Captain Brown places this animal in the class of \" domesticated dogs which hunt in packs or singly, principally by the eye, although some times by the scent.\" \" The Irish Greyhound. Canis Grains Hiber nicus. \u2014 Ray. \"They seem good-tempered animals, but from the accounts Mr. Lambert received, it is obvious that they must have degenerated, par ticularly in point of size. \" Dr. Goldsmith says he has seen a dozen of these dogs, and assures us that the largest was about four feet high, and as tall as a calf of a year old.\" We are sorry to remark, that Captain Brown's statement, \"that the Irish greyhound is still preserved by the Marquis of Sligo,\" &c. is totally unfounded. No dog of this description has been for many years in the possession of the noble lord. In his father's time, there were, I believe, some descendants of this splendid stock at Westport House \u2014 but for years they have been extinct. The present Marquis intro duced some double-nosed boar-hounds into the country, which possibly were mistaken for the Irish greyhound, although no animals could be more dissimilar in shape, courage, and docility. \" This is one of the largest of the canine race, with an air at once beautiful, striking, and ma jestic. He has been known to grow to the extraordinary height of four feet, although the general standard is about three feet. \" In shape the Irish greyhound somewhat resembles the common greyhound , only that he is much larger and more muscular in his formation, clumsy in all his different parts, and is quite unserviceable in hunting either the stag, fox, or hare. His chief use in former times was in clearing the country of wolves and wild boars, for which his great size and strength peculiarly adapted him. \" The colour of the Irish greyhound is a pale cinnamon or fawn.

My cousin has for many seasons made the attempt, and generally failed three times for once that he succeeded. Last year one young deer that he procured throve well and grew apace until he was sufficiently stout to go out and graze with the cows. Unfortunately, a visitor brought a savage tempered greyhound to the Lodge, the dog attacked the fawn, and it died of the worrying it received, before the greyhound could be taken off. was a fine and playful animal, and gave many proofs of extraordinary sagacity. Like many fairer favourites, she was a very troublesome one, and from her cunning and activity, a sad torment to the gardener. No fences would exclude her from the shrubberies, and if the garden gates were for a moment insecure, the hind was sure to discover the neglect, and avail herself of the opportunity to taste the choicest vegetables. This beautiful but mis chievous pet met with some accidental injury, and died, to the great regret of her proprietor. It is almost impossible to procure the fawns from the mountains in an uninjured state. They generally receive a blow of a stick or stone from the captor, or undergo such rough usage in conveying them to the low-lands, that death commonly ensues. A fine well-grown male was brought to the Lodge last week. For a day or two nothing could be more promising than its appearance. It began, however, on the fourth morning to pine away, and soon after died. We opened it to ascertain, if possible, the cause ofits death, and discovered a gangrened wound in the side, evidently pro duced by a blow. The peasant who brought him declared that he was sound and uninjured ; and to account for his caption swore lustily that he caught the fawn asleep, but it appeared that the rogue had knocked the poor animal over with a stone, and thus produced the in ward bruise which terminated fatally. Many years ago, a stag was in the possession of a gentlemen of Tyrawley. He grew to be a powerful and splendid beast, but his pro. pensities and dispositions were very different to those of the playful and innocent hind. The stag was bold and violent, detested strangers and women, and from his enormous size and strength, was frequently a very dangerous playfellow. He had a particular fancy for horses, resided mostly in the stable, and when the carriage was ordered to the door, if permitted, he would accompany it. A curious ancedote is told of him. He had no objection whatever to allow a gentleman to enter the coach ; but to the fair sex he had an unconquerable aversion, and with his consent no lady should be an inside passenger. The servants were obliged to drive him away, before their mistress could venture to appear ; and at last he became so troublesome and unsafe, as to render his banishment to an adjoining deer park the necessary punishment of his indocility, He did not survive this disgrace long ; he pined away rapidly, avoided the fallow deer, and died, as my informant declared, of a broken heart. It is strange that a creature of such strength and endurance when arrived at maturity, should be so very difficult to bring up. Means were resorted to by my kinsman to have the cow's assimilated to the wild deer's milk, by changing the fawn's nurse to a heathier and poorer pasturage ; a lichen, indigenous to the moun tains on which the deer principally feeds, was also procured, and intermixed with the cow's hay ; and yet this attention and trouble were attended with but indifferent success. In killing deer, it is necessary to select tlie head, or aim directly behind the shoulder. A body- wound may eventually destroy the animal, but the chances are, that he will carry off the ball. Many, when severely struck, escape the shooter ; and there have been stags killed in these mountains, who bore the marks of severe wounds, from the effects of which they had entirely recovered. The following singular and authentic instance of a bullet lodging in what is usually considered a mortal place, and fail ing to occasion death, is extracted from a scientific periodical.* When once, however, the period of infancy is passed, the wild deer is hardy, vigorous, and easily provided for. At different times, many have been located in the neighbouring parks, and lived there to a great age. In the domain of a nobleman in Roscommon, there are several brace \u2014 and in the park of Clogher, a stag and hind are confined at present ; they are all vigorous and healthy, but have never continued their species. \"A buck, that was remarkably fat and healthy in condition, in August, 1816, was killed in Bradbury Park, and on opening him, it was discovered, that at some distant time he Many curious anecdotes are recorded of the red deer.

The surface of the cyst had a whitish appearance ; the ball weighs two hundred and ninety-two grains, and was quite flat.

That the animal should subsist long after receiving this ball, is CHAPTER XVII.

He was a sprightly, active-minded dog, and his torpidness is alarming. We promptly separated him from his companions, and have chained him in an adjoining cabin, under the especial observation of old Antony. The otter-killer is preparing to use his leechcraft, and I trust with good effect. Canine madness is a frightful visitation, and no caution can be too strict to guard against its melancholy consequences. flies, they rose as if they wished merely to reconnoitre them, or struck at them scornfully with their tails. Still hoping that a change in the temper of the fish\u2014 for a lady is not more fanciful \u2014 might yet crown our efforts with success, we proceeded down the river and pushed on for Pullgarrow. To angle here with the water clean and full, and the wind brisk from the westward, would almost repay a pilgrimage. For its extent, there is not a better salmon haunt in Christen dom. The fish were rising in dozens, and where the river rushes into the neck of the pool, the constant breaking of the surface by the rolling or springing of the salmon, was incredible. The number of fish collected in this pool must have been immense, for in every part of it they were rising simultaneously. But not one of them would touch the fly. I hooked a salmon accidentally in the side, and after a short and violent struggle the hold broke and I lost him. The mode of fishing attributed by Sir Humphry Davy to the Gal way fishermen* must be as unprofitable as unartistlike. If ever it could avail, we should have succeeded to-day in Pullgarrow. Who shall say that success in angling can be calculated upon with anything like certainty ? If a man were gifted with the properties of a walking barometer, the weather of this most capricious corner of the earth would set his prognostics at defiance. Never did a morning look more favourable ; it was just such a one as an angler would swear by ; a grey, dark, sober, settled sky, without any vexatious glare of threatening sunshine to interrupt his sport. The otter-killer was not so sanguine of this happy promise of good weather as we were. He observed certain little clouds, to which he gave some Irish name. \"The wind, too, had shifted a point southerly since daybreak, and the pinkeens* were jumping, as they always jump, when they expect more water.\" We laughed at him, but Antony was right. We tried some beautiful pools ; the fish were rising fast ; they sprang over the surface of the water frequently, and no worse omen can threaten the fishermen with disappoint ment. If they did condescend to notice our Meanwhile the breeze gradually died away, or came in gusts from the south ; the sky in the same quarter grew thick and misty ; large * \" In the river at Galway, in Ireland, I have seen above the bridge some hundreds of salmon lying in rapid streams, and from five to ten fisher men tempting them with every variety of fly, but in vain.

The reason why the salmon had declined our flies was now disclosed ; although we had not foreseen the coming change, the fish had evidently expected it. Wearied and drenched, we returned to our shooting quarters. But we speedily forgot our fatigue and disappointment. Antony's report of the health of his canine patient was satisfac tory. The animal's stomach had been dis ordered, and the otter-hunter's remedies were promptly administered, and successful. My cousin had a dread of madness breaking out in his kennel ; and from his melancholy ex perience ofthe fearful consequences of neglect, I do not marvel that on the first symptom of loss of appetite or abated spirits, he forthwith causes the suspected dog to be removed, and places him under a strict surveillance. unhappy curs were being ejected by the butler, or pelted by the cook. \" So common place was this everlasting up roar, that after a few days I almost ceased to notice it. I was dressing for dinner, when the noise of dogs quarrelling in the yard, brought me to the window ; a terrier was being worried by a rough, savage-looking fox-hound, whom I had before this noticed and avoided. At the moment, my host was crossing from the stable ; he struck the hound with his whip, but, re gardless of the blow, he continued his attack upon the smaller dog. The old butler in coming from the garden, observed the dogs fighting, and stopped to assist in separating them. Just then, the brute quitted the terrier, seized the master by the leg, and cut the servant in the hand. A groom rushed out on hearing the uproar, struck the prongs of a pitchfork through the dog's body, and killed him on the spot. This scene occurred in less time than I have taken in relating it. Our conversation after dinner naturally turned upon the indisposition of the setter. \u2014 \" You may think, my dear Frank,\" said my cousin, \" that I carry my apprehensions of the slightest illness in my dogs to a ridiculous and unneces sary length ; but when I tell you that I have witnessed the fatal course of hydrophobia, in the human as well as the brute victim, you may then conceive the horror I feel when anything recalls to my memory this hopeless malady. \"I hastened from my dressing-room; my host had bared his leg, and was washing the wound, which was a jagged tear from the hound's tooth. Part of the skin was loose, and a sudden thought appeared to strike him. He desired an iron to be heated ; took a sharp penknife from his pocket, coolly and effectually removed the ragged flesh, and, regardless of the agony it occasioned, with amazing deter mination, cauterized the wound severely. \" During my first season at the Dublin Uni versity, I was invited to pass a short vacation with a relative of my mother. He lived in the south of Ireland, in an ancient family mansion house, situated in the mountains, and at a considerable distance from the mail-coach road. ' \" The old butler, however, contented him self with binding up his bleeding hand. He endeavoured to dissuade his master from un dergoing what he considered to be unneces sary pain. ' The dog was dead, sure, and that was quite sufficient to prevent any danger arising from the bite ; ' and, satisfied with this precaution, he remained indifferent to future consequences, and in perfect confidence that no ulterior injury could occur from the wound. \" This gentleman was many years older than I. He had an only sister, a girl of sixteen, beautiful and accomplished ; at the period of! my visit she was still at school, but was to finally leave it, as my host informed me, at Midsummer. \"Never was there a more perfect specimen of primitive Milesian life than that which the domicile of my worthy relative exhibited. The house was enormously large \u2014 half ruinous \u2014 and all, within and without, wild, rackety, and irregular. There was a troop of idle and slatternly servants of both sexes, distracting every part of the establishment : and a pack of useless dogs infesting the premises, and cross- ing you at every turn. Between the biped and quadruped nuisance an eternal war was carried on, and not an hour of the day elapsed but a canine outcry announced that some of those \" Three months passed away \u2014 my friend's sister was returning from school \u2014 and, as the mountain road was in bad repair, and a bridge had been swept away by the floods, saddle horses were sent to meet the carriage. The old butler, who had some private affairs to transact in the neighbouring town, volunteered to be the escort of his young mistress, and obtained permission. \"That there was something unusual in the look and manner of her attendant was quickly remarked by the lady.

To an inquiry if he was unwell, he returned a vague and unmean ing answer ; he trembled violently when assist ing her on horseback, and it was evident that some strange and fearful sensations disturbed him. sented to me by a gentleman under peculiar circumstances. He had been the favourite companion of his deceased wife ; and, during her long and hopeless illness, had seldom left her chamber. He begged me to allow him a place in the Lodge, and not subject him to the restraint of the kennel. His wishes were obeyed, and Carlo was duly installed into all the rights and privileges of a carpet-dog. \" They rode some miles rapidly, until they reached the rivulet where the bridge had been carried off by the flood. To cross the stream was no way difficult, as the water barely covered the horse's fetlock. The lady had ridden through the water, when a thrilling cry of indescribable agony from her attendant arrested her. Her servant was on the oppo site side, endeavouring to rein in his unwill ing horse, and in his face there was a horrible and convulsed look that terrified his alarmed mistress. To her anxious questions, he only replied by groans, which too truly betrayed his sufferings ; at last he pointed to the stream before him, and exclaimed, ' I cannot, dare not cross it ! Oh God .' I am lost ! \u2014 the dog \u2014the dog ! ' \" I left home on a shooting-visit, and luckily brought a brace of my best setters with me. A week after my departure, an express reached me to say that Carlo ' was very odd, would not eat,* and bit and worried every dog he met with.' I took alarm instantly, and returned home without delay. I found the household in desperate alarm, and Carlo was confined in a separate out-house, but not until he had worried and torn every dog in my possession ! \"I went to reconnoitre him through an iron-stanchioned window ; he was in the last and frightfullest stage of confirmed hydro phobia. I sent for a rifle and terminated the animal's hfe. \"What situation could be more frightful than that in which the lady found herself ? In the centre of a desolate and unpeopled moor, far from assistance, and left alone with a person afflicted with decided madness. She might, it is true, have abandoned him ; for the terrors of the poor wretch would have prevented him from crossing the rivulet ; but, with extraor dinary courage, she returned, seized the bridle fearlessly, an$l, notwithstanding the outcries of the unhappy man, forced his horse through the water, and never left his side, until she fortunately overtook some tenants of her bro ther returning from a neighbouring fair. \"I was at first afraid to inquire into the extent of my calamity. I mustered courage to enter the kennel, and personally investi gated the state of my dogs. Every one of them, ten in number, had been bitten, and several of them were fearfully mutilated by the rabid animal I had despatched. Even the terriers had not escaped ; and they, poor ani mals ! were necessarily included in the general order for execution that 1 issued to the keeper. That noble house-dog, who has been the sub ject of your admiration, was fortunately pre served, by having been sent for by a gentleman who resided in the next county. \"I arrived on a visit the third evening after this occurrence, and the recollection of that poor old man's sufferings has ever since haunted my memory. All that medical skill and affectionate attention on his master's part could do to assuage his pain, and mitigate the agonies he occasionally underwent, was done. At length, the moment that was devoutly prayed for came. He died on the sixth morning. \" A most extraordinary insensibility to danger was evinced by the female members of my household. Unluckily, Antony was absent in the mountains, setting a broken bone ; the keeper had accompanied me ; every one acquainted with the habits and manage ment of dogs was from home ; and the kennel Dr. Clark, of Nottingham, relates a case in that neighbourhood, of a dog that was not sus< pected to labour under rabies until ten days after he had bitten an unfortunate man, who, in six weeks after the bite, died of hydrophobia. This dog ate and drank heartily, showed no signs of indisposition, hunted as usual, and occasionally went into a neighbour's house among children, without injuring any of them ; but, on the morn ing of the tenth day (that is, ten days after com municating the disease by the bite, and when he had no hydrophobia) he was seen snapping at every dog in the street, and was in consequence destroyed. \" From this horrible fate nothing but his own determination preserved my relative : and, by the timely use of a painful remedy, excision and cautery of the wound, he escaped this dreadful disease. \"I have related the calamity of another; but I, too, have been a sufferer, although, thank God ! not in person. \"A setter of uncommon beauty was pre-"], [55, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 51 was entrusted to the kitchen-boy.

But until his violencebecame fright ful, he was actually permitted to run about the house, and got access to the kennel, while the boy was carrying food to his charge. across the fire-place. ' Come away from that, Biddy,' said the old cook, with perfect non chalance, to her attendant : ' Don't ye see the dog is mad ? ' and continued some culinary operation, in which, at a distant corner of the kitchen, she was engaged. The boy's preser vation was unaccountable. The poor lad made many unavailing efforts to part the dogs when fighting in the kennel, and prevent the setters from being bitten. In this perilous attempt his clothes were literally torn to ribbons ; but, fortunately for himself, there was not a scratch visible on his skin.\" \" The escape of the servants was miraculous.

Never was there a lovelier day or wilder scenery; after we had cleared the river and opened the bay, a view of surpassing grandeur was presented. We were surrounded on every side by an amphitheatre of bold and endless hills, except where the opening to the Atlantic showed us the dark waters of a boundless ocean \u2014 the surface was clear and undisturbed \u2014 and the light breeze rippled the long and measured undulations from the sea, and bore us gently towards the island. The bay was filled with mackerel, and consequently it was crowded with sea-fowl. In clamorous groups the gulls were darting on the fish below, and an endless variety of puffins and cormorants were incessant in pursuit of the smaller fry, which had attracted the shoals of mackerel from the deep. But the wind was too scanty, and the hooker's sailing not sufficiently fast, to allow us to kill fish in any quantity. We occasionally, how ever, caught a mackerel, and shot among a number of water-fowls a beautiful specimen of the sea-hawk, which I shall endeavour to pre serve.* This morning my servant's report was favourable ; the sky looked settled, the wind blew from the north-west, and old Antony was satisfied with the prognostics. My cousin was already a-foot, and his voice at my window loudly summoned me to \"turn-out.\" I opened the curtains \u2014 the sun was shining, as if he intended to keep a fair face throughout the day, and there was a cheerful bustle in front of the Lodge which gave \"note of preparation.\" The main-sail of the hooker was already chalk up and shivering in the morning breeze ; and the boatmen, sitting on the grass before the window, were preparing lines and baiting spillets. The piper looked on, stretching one arm lazily out, while with the other he hitched up the waistband of his unmentionables ; and frequent visits of the dog-boy to the kennel. showed that both bipeds and quadrupeds would be shortly in requisition.

We had gradually neared Dugurth, which is the only spot on which for many miles a boat, even in moderate weather, can safely effect a landing, when a galley stood out of Elly bay and bore down upon us. Our courses nearly crossed : they were running off the wind, we close-hauled as possible. Nothing could be more picturesque than the light and elegant appearance of this \" fairy frigate.\" At a little distance she seemed a cloud of canvass flitting across the sea, for the long low hull was not visible until her close approach revealed it. Her large lugs and topsails were of the whitest duck, and as all her sails drew, light as the breeze was, she passed us with the velocity of a race-horse. The airy motion of this \"light shalloop \" as she glided through the water, might to the fancy of a poet, present a simili tude of that imaginary bark, in which the spirits of departed mariners are seen flitting over the dark billows beneath which their bodies rest. Too late we found out our error ; it was four o'clock, and we determined to abandon the heath for the day ; and, having from a high ground examined the interior of the island, we arranged to-morrow's beat accordingly. Quitting the hill, we walked for a mile along the beach to some bent banks, where we were told that rabbits were abundant. In an hour we shot eight pair, and two couple of whim brels; and perceiving that the hooker had anchored off the landing-place, we gave up shooting and returned to the watch-house. In our absence the servants had been active ; they slung our hammocks, and made the neces sary preparations for cooking dinner. The chief officer of the coast-guard kindly gave us his own apartment. His little cabin was crowded with every necessary requisite for one so far removed, from the civilized portion of mankind, and it was amusing to remark the ingenuity with which the occupier had arranged his numerous goods and chattels ; nothing could exceed the cleanliness of his cottage, and it formed a striking contrast to tlie filth and misery of the surrounding hovels. Having weathered the Ridge Point, we made a signal for a rowing-boat, and one immediately came off. Our boatmen, having ascertained by their landmarks that they were upon clean ground, prepared to shoot their spillets. We left them, taking with us our dogs and attend ants, and landed on a small sandy beach. Having established our head-quarters in the watch-house of the coast-guard, and procured an adjoining cabin for the suite, we set out to look for grouse, taking a westerly direction along the base of Slieve More. Deceived by the false report of the villagers, we found the beat we had chosen neither a pleasant nor productive one. The heath was short and withered, the side of the mountain unsheltered, and exposed to the severe and almost eternal west wind : and, with the exception of a very few banks beside the water-courses, and one or two natural ravines, there was not a spot in which a grouse could shelter. In these hollows we generally found a stager,* and in one rugged dell shot three old cocks. Contrary to their general caution they stood the dogs well, The boatmen were just landing in their punt, and we descended to the beach to ascertain what addition to our cuisine the spillets had afforded. They produced a pair of fine soles, and a score of large plaice. These, with the mackerel taken in the morning, supplied the fish department admirably. Our purveyor had * Against running after grouse I uplift my voice. If they are wild, and will not stand orsit, a commonplace occurrence in wet cold weather, I would recommend gentlemen to remain at home. If circumstances bring them to the moors, or they are particularly solicited (as I have often been) to procure birds, let them depend on close marking, tie up every dog but the steadiest one, and quietly, patiently, and silently endeavour to come within range of their object. If the bird moves, then to out-flank him is the best chance. Take a considerable circuit, and the more ap parent carelessness you show in striving to close with a wild grouse, the more likely you will be to succeed. If the bird observes any hurry in the approach of the shooter, he will take alarm instantly, and an immediate flight will show he has been perfectly on the qui vive. whole body, some of the above mixture, putting it also though the gullet and entire length of the neck. Hang the bird in a cool airy place, first by the feet, that the body may be impregnated by the salt, and afterwards by a thread through the under mandible of the bill, till it appears to be sweet, then expose it in the sun, or near a fire ; after it is well dried, clean out what remains loose of the mixture, and fill the cavity of the body with wool, oakum, or any soft substance. \u2022 An old cock grouse which has not paired.j"], [57, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 53 purchased a Keim sheep ; * and at six o'clock we went to dinner. Nothing could be more delicious than our fare ; \u2014 fish transferred from the sea to the kettle, and diminutive mutton, whose only fault was excessive fatness. We had a grouse, too, one of our stagers, but it was coarse and flavourless ; and if toughness be a test of years, I should set him down as coeval with Saint Patrick. side of Slieve More, and immediately above the coast-guard station, the eagles had formed an aerie ; \u2014 a fissure in the cliffs beyond the possibility of being disturbed by the approach of man, afforded these birds for many years a secure retreat. Here, annually, they produced their offspring, to the sad annoyance of the islanders, and more particularly the villagers of Dugurth. This morning they had de scended from their rocky habitation, accom panied by two eaglets, evidently to teach their young to stoop and lift their prey.* The old birds tore up turfs from the mountain side, rose high in the air, and dropped them. The eaglets, in turn, stooped and took them up again. This was frequently repeated, and the course ol instruction having lasted half-an hour, the eagles mounted to their aerie, and leaving their progeny safely in the nest, sailed off upon the rising breeze to provide for the evening meal. We viewed the proceedings of this predatory family through the telescope of the coast-guard, who gave us many curious anecdotes of these daring and destructive birds. The host joined us after dinner, and pre sented us with a bottle of genuine Inniskea. If such be the customary produce of their stills, those gifted islanders are worthy of being canonised. Although our host's flask was a true Hollander, having an amplitude of bottom that would have put two degenerate wine-bottles to the blush, I regret to say such an unyielding thirst beset us, that before any of the company sought a hammock, the honest Dutchman was left without a drop ! We were astir betimes next morning. It was an excellent shooting day ; a brisk breeze had sprung up with the first of flood, and the fog rising gradually up the mountain-side cleared the summit of Slieve More, leaving its rugged pinnacle \u2014 a disordered mass of shivered granite \u2014 sparlding in the sunshine. Our dogs were in beautiful condition ; and we were gratified to hear from a water-guard patrol that, but an hour before, he had sprung a strong pack of birds on our purposed beat. We took an opposite course to the barren beat yesterday pursued. The bogs were inter sected by several mountain streams, whose dry and heathy banks offered excellent feeding and shelter for grouse. Our success, however, was very indifferent to what we had anticipated, from the promising appearance ofthe ground, and we had spent an hour, hunting with two brace of prime dogs before we saw a bird. We met numerous indications of a strong pack having recently visited the river, and left no place untried which birds might be expected to frequent. At last we began to imagine that the eagles had been here before us, when at some distance a young setter dropped on a heathy brow that overhung the rivulet. We were advancing, but the pack, alarmed by the sudden appearance of the dog above them, toclc wing, and we had to content ourselves with reckoning them, as they got up bird by bird. We counted nineteen, and concluded that two broods had packed accidentally. f But, alas ! the departed Dutchman had left us certain twinges in the head to make us recollect him, and we felt a nervous sensibility that, was anything but favourable to good shooting. An immersion in the sea was recommended as a certain remedy, and our host conducted us to a rock, from which we could plunge into water four fathoms deep and yet clear enough to enable us to observe the shells and pebbles at the bottom. We enjoyed a delightful ablution, returned new men to the watch-house, and, like giants refreshed, prepared for a good day's fag. So salutary proved our bath that we break fasted as if we had never drained a Dutchman in our lives. The dogs were duly coupled, and sundry disengaged gentlemen of the vil lage, whom we found lounging at the door, were being invested with shot and game bags, when, roused by an exclamation of the keeper, we witnessed a curious scene. * \"The story of the eagle brought to the ground, after a severe conflict with a cat, which it had seized and taken up into the air with its talons, is very remarkable. Mr. Barber, who was an eye-witness of the fact, made a drawing of it, which he afterwards engraved.\" \u2014 Bewick. j- I have never known red grouse flock in Ire land.

Another perilous occu pation of the female peasants is what they term \" picking cranagh.\" This sea-weed, which forms a favourite esculent of the islanders, grows on the rocks that are but occasionally covered by the sea. Exposure to sudden swells from the ocean attends those who search for it, and loss of life has too often occurred. They all pitched in a scattered manner on the side of a neighbouring eminence, and having marked them carefully down, we took up one brace of dogs, and with the other proceeded quietly to work. I never, in my sporting ex perience, saw a pack disposed of in better style. The dogs picked up the broken birds immediately, and with one miss (mine was the deed !) we brought nine brace to bag. The sole survivor probably roaded off during the slaughter, or threw himself into a hole in the heath, for we could not make him out. One accident, which happened not longsince, was truly melancholy. A woman, the mother of several helpless children, and who but a month before had given birth to twins, perished in the sight of her family. No relief in such cases can be given : the reflux of these moun tainous waves bears the victims away, and, with rare exceptions, the bodies are never found, as they are either borne out to sea, or entombed in one of the many deep caverns with which the bases of these fearful precipices are perforated. From our opening essay we reckoned that this would prove an exterminating day ; but with the destruction of this pack our sport might be said to cease. For hours we traversed hills and crossed moors, meeting but one weak brood and a few stagers. We did find another brood, but the poults were scarcely able to leave the ground, and consequently were too weak for shooting. From their appearance, we concluded them to be a second progeny of birds who had lost their first eggs by robbery or vermin. We met, however, a number of hares, and shot seven. These, with thirteen brace of grouse, filled the game bags. We reached home at seven, made a hasty toilet, and dined sumptuously from mountain mutton and a fine John Dory, which the priest had sent us in our absence. Determined to eschew temptation, we avoided engaging a fresh Dutchman, which our host pressed upon us, and put in a quiet evening. After smoking a cigar, and discussing its necessary associa tion of schnaps and water, we turned into our hammocks in such grave and philosophic moderation, as might have claimed the appro bation of Sir Humphry, and entitled us to a place of honour in any Temperance Society in Great Britain. Our course homewards lay along the base of Slieve More. The evening was calm and sultry, and a number of men and women of all ages were seated on the rocks fishing for gun ners,* or gaffing the horse-mackerel, which were seen in numbers on the surface of the water. This rock-fishing is more dangerous than productive, and many lives have been lost in pursuing it. Descending the precipices to reach the water's edge is attended with immi- CHAPTER XIX.

When the wind blows from a favourable point, the eagle in the grey of morning sweeps through the cabins, and never fails in carrying off some prey. To black fowls, eagles appear particularly attached ; and the villagers avoid as much as possible rearing birds of that colour. personals ; and having despatched our heavy luggage by the attendants, whom we ordered home, we ascended the hiU, (while the crew were clearing and baiting their spillets,) in the vague hope of getting a shot at those preda tory birds, of whose spoliations we had heard so much on the preceding evening. On reaching the bottom of the rock in whose face the aerie stands, we discovered that the old birds were absent ; and as the nest was formed in a deep fissure, we could not ascertain its situation exactly. But that the eagles' dwelling was above us was evident enough : the base of the cliff was strewn with bones and feathers, and the accumulation of both was extraordinary. The bones of rabbits, hares, and domestic fowls, were most numerous ; but those of smaller game, and various sorts of fish, were visible among the heap. A few days before our arrival, one of the coast-guard, alarmed by the cries of a boy, rushed from the watch-house : the eagle had taken up a black hen, and as he passed within a few yards, the man flung his cap at him. The eagle dropped the bird ; it was quite dead, however, the talons having shattered the back-bone. The villagers say (with what truth I know not) that turkeys are never taken. Many attempts are annuallymade to destroy this predatory family ; but it is impossible to rob the nest. Situated two hundred feet above the base ofthe rock, it is, of course, unapproach able from below ; and as the cliffs beetle over it frightfully, to assail it from above would be a hazardous essay. An enterprising peasant some years since was let down by a rope and basket ; but he was fiercely attacked by the old birds, and the basket nearly overturned. Fortunately, thc cord was strong, and had sufficient length to allow his being lowered rapidly, or he would have undoubtedly sus tained some bodily injury from the wings and talons of those enraged and savage birds.* That the eagle is extremely destructive to fish, and particularly as to salmon, many cir cumstances would prove. They are constantly discovered watching the fords in the spawning season, and are seen to seize and carry off the fish. One curious anecdote I heard from my friend the priest. Some years since, a herds man, on a very sultry day in July, while looking for a missing sheep, observed an eagle posted on a bank that overhung a pool. Presently the bird stooped and seized a salmon, and a violent struggle ensued. When the herd reached the spot, he found the eagle pulled under water by the strength of the fish, and the calmness of the day, joined to drenched plumage, rendered him unable to extricate himself. With a stone, the peasant broke the eagle's pinion, and actually secured the spoiler and his victim, for he found the salmon d3dng in his grasp. * The following interesting anecdote is well authenticated : \" Two eagles, in the wildest part of a neighbouring country, had for some time depredated on the neighbourhood, and bore away lambs, kids, &c, for the sustenance of their young. Some peasants determined, if possible, to obtain the young birds; and ascended the mountains, but found that the nest'was in a part of the perpendicular rock, near one hundred feet below the summit, and about three hundred above the sea, which, with terrific appearances, dashed against its base. They had provided themselves with ropes, and a lad armed with a cimetar, was by this means lowered by the rest. He arrived in safety at the nest, where, as he expected, he was attacked with infinite fury by one of the old eagles, at which he made a stroke with his sword, that nearly cut asunder the rope by which he was suspended. Fortunately, one strand of it re mained. He described his state to his com rades, waiting in horrible expectation that the division of the cord would precipitate him to the bottom ; but though he might have been to die by a rope, it was not in this manner. He was cautiously and safely hauled up ; when it was found that his hair, which a quarter of an hour before had been of a dark auburn, had in that short period become perfectly white.\" When shooting on Lord Sligo's mountains, near the Killeries, I heard many particulars of the eagle's habits and history, from a grey haired peasant, who had passed a long life in these wilds. The scarcity of hares, which here were once abundant, he attributed to thc rapa city of those birds ; and he affirmed that, when in pursuit of these animals, the eagle evinced a degree of intelligence that appeared extraor dinary. They coursed the hares, he said, witli great judgment and certain success : one bird was the active follower, while another remained in reserve, at the distance of forty or fifty yards. If the hare, by a sudden turn, freed herself from her most pressing enemy, the second bird instantly took up the chase, and thus prevented the victim from having a moment's respite."], [60, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 56 He had remarked the eagles, also, while they were engaged in fishing. They chose a small ford upon the rivulet which connects Glencullen with Glandullah, and, posted on either side, waited patiently for the salmon to pass over. Their watch was never fruitless ; and many a salmon, in its transit from the sea to the lake, was transferred from his native element to the wild aerie in the Alpine cliff, that beetles over the romantic waters of Glencullen. we fired a gun, and, being upon an excellent bank for spillet-fishing, the boatmen adjusted their buoys, and commenced throwing then lines overboard. I was watching the progress made by a dozen of the islanders to launch a row-boat to the water, when suddenly, from beneath the opposite cliff, a floating substance appeared to issue from the side of the precipice. We had neared the shore considerably, and the object, of which I had previously but an indistinct view, was now more clearly seen. It was a woman sitting in a curragh, fishing for codling and gunners. Startled by the discharge of tlie musket, she pulled a short distance from the cliffs, and then lay-to upon her paddles, watching the hooker as she shot the spillets. Nor is it to birds of prey alone that the extreme scarcity of game upon this island may be attributed. Foxes are found here in numbers that appear incredible. The sides of Slieve More, in places formed of masses of disrupted rock, afford numerous and inacces sible burrows to those mischievous animals ; and the sand-banks, stocked with rabbits, offer them an easy and certain means of subsistence. Hence, their annual increase is wonderful ; and the numbers on the island maybe estimated from this simple fact, that one of the coast guard, who happened to have a couple of good terriers, destroyed, in the space of a season, eighteen full-grown foxes.* The multitude of lambs lost by these depredators, has nearly deterred the islanders from keeping ewes ; and there is not a spot in Great Britain so perse cuted by winged and footed vermin as this wild district. Of smaller birds of prey, there is a plentiful variety ; but the devastations of the greater tribe cause their minor larcenies to be unnoticed. \" These lazy lubbers will be half an hour getting that heavy row-boat across the sand ridge,\" said my kinsman. \" Hail the curragh, Pattigo, and let us get ashore.\" To the shout of the skipper, a \"cead fealtagh,\" was returned; the paddles dipped in the water, the light curragh skimmed over the surface like a sea-bird, and in a few minutes the female and her frail bark were rocking beneath the counter ofthe sailing-boat. I shuddered as I looked over the hooker's side at this crazy vehicle ; it was but a few slight hoops, secured together by cords, and overlaid by a covering of canvas, rendered waterproof by a coating of tar and tallow. The machine was so unsubstantial, that a schoolboy could carry it easily upon his shoul ders. Nor was its fragility alone that which rendered this bark so perilous ; from its pecu liar construction, it scarcely rested on the surface of the sea ; and, consequently, the least change of position ofthe occupant, would inevitably capsize it ; and yet in this frail vessel the young islander sat in perfect security, a couple of hand-lines coiled at her feet, and the bottom of the curragh overspread with the produce of her fishery. Without the romance of Scott's beautiful boatwoman, there was something more than interesting in the air and look of this wild female. Free from that timidity which might be expected in the in habitant of a remote coast, on her first intro duction to strangers of a different grade in society, she laughed and jested with the boat men ; and the play of her merry hazel e ye, and the smile which disclosed a row of pure and even teeth, had really more in them to capti vate, than the cold and regular charms of many a high-born beauty. With a. light leading breeze, we stood across the bay, passed the Island of Devilawn, and, running through a sound, which separates Tarmon from Inneskea, came to at the distance of a quarter of a mile from the landing-place. It was low water, and the boats were all hauled up upon the beach. Even in the calmest weather, the greatest caution is re quisite to protect them from the heavy and sudden swells that eternally break on this wild coast ; and, if left within the reach of the surf, they are frequently stove before the careless crew are aware of danger. Anxious to land, * Dr. Johnson, in his Tour to the Hebrides, remarks, \"To check the ravages of the foxes in the Isle of Sky, the inhabitants set a price upon their heads, which, as the number diminished, has been gradually raised, from three shillings and sixpence to a guinea ; a sum so great in this part of the world,\" adds the Doctor, \"that in a short time Sky may be as free from foxes as England from wolves.\" The fund for these rewards is a tax of sixpence in the pound, im posed by the farmers on themselves, and said to be paid with great willingness."], [61, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 57 \"We must land singly,\" said my cousin ; \" for your curragh is but a crank concern. Mind how you step in, Frank.\" But I had already determined against an embarkation, and accordingly declined the honour of being first adventurer. My timidity only excited the mirth of the sea-nymph ; and, unwilling to be laughed at by a woman, I took courage, and cautiously committed my person to the skiff ; a change of position was of course necessary on the lady's part, and this she managed with such adroitness, that the equilibrium of the coracle was undisturbed. In a moment, her sculls were flashing in the waters, and we speedily reached the strand. cod, hake, and ling, is inexhaustible ; peats are excellent and plenty, and food and fuel are consequently never scarce in Inneskea. These are, doubtless, great advantages over the interior districts, but they are barely necessary to compensate the other local incon veniences. Throughout the greater portion of the winter, all communication with the main is interrupted. The sick must die without relief, and the sinner pass to his account without the consolations of religion. Should anything beyond the produce of the island be requisite in the stormy months it must be procured with imminent danger ; and constant loss of life and property forms the unhappy theme of the tales and traditions of this insulated people. The rowing-boat was now afloat, and pulling to the hooker to bring off my kinsman. My sea-nymph tossed her fish and paddles to a little boy, who was expecting her, received with a low curtsey the silver I presented as my passage-money, and, having returned her small purse to her bosom, she threw the cur ragh across her back, and left me, invoking \" God to bless my honour.\" A calm and misty twilight had fallen on Slieve More, and abridged the almost bound less range of ocean, over which the eye passed when we first landed. At a little distance the village girls were milking, carolling those melancholy ditties to which the Irish are so partial. I strolled among the rocks, and chose the narrow path, which the full tide left between its margin and the cliffs. The moon was rising now in exquisite beauty \u2014 the water was rippling to the rocks \u2014 one long and wavy line of molten silver undulated across the sur face of the sea\u2014 and there were wild cliffs and bolder headland in glorious relief. No scene on earth could be more peaceful or romantic. The boat returned my cousin and our guns ; and while the dinner requisites were being brought ashore, we strolled towards the side of a hill, where we observed a number of rabbits at play. They were very numerous, and exhibited a greater variety than those of the other warrens that I had as yet visited. We selected some of the gayest colour for our practice, and whiled an hour away, until a summons from the cook recalled us to the village. I was indulging in a delicious reverie, when something like a bird flitted hastily by \u2014 again, and there was a heavy plump in the water. I looked up, \u2014 a wild unearthly looking creature stood on the clist above, in the very act of launching a huge stone at me ! Just then a female figure rose beside him, and with threats and blows drove him from the rock. It was my fair friend of the curragh, who seeing me take the lonely path I did, hastened to warn me of the danger. She told me that the assailant was a dangerous lunatic ; he was treacherous beyond description, and his anti pathy to women and strangers was remarkable. Many accidents had occurred from his savage disposition. He feared, men and rarely attacked them ; but if he saw a female at a distance from the village, he would lurk with malignant perseverance for hours behind a bank or cliff to attack her unawares. Some of the island women had narrowly escaped death from this truculent monster, and few of the males but had at some time or other suffered injury from his hands ; a stone was his favourite The spillets had provided us sumptuously with flat-fish, and a present of shrimps and lobsters completed our cuisine. The best house in the island had offered us its accom modation, and there was an appearance of comfort and rustic opulence in the furniture, that we had not anticipated when we landed. There are numerous chances and godsends incident to these islands, which the other lines of sea-coast seldom obtain. Frequent and valuable wrecks furnish the inhabitants with many articles of domestic utility. The drift timber from the Atlantic gives them an abun dant supply for the building and repairs of boats and houses ; and immense quantities of sea-fowl feathers are annually collected upon the Black Rock, which is contiguous to Innis kea. The island affords excellent pasturage for sheep ; and thus timber, feathers, and wool, enable the inhabitants to have domestic com forts in abundance. In winter, the take of"], [62, "58 WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. missile, which he threw with wonderful force and precision. To my inquiry, \"Why this dangerous being was not removed to some asylum ? \" my protectress replied with a smile, \"He was but a poor natural, after all ; he was bom in the island, and God forbid that they should send him among strangers.\" On con versing with my cousin afterwards, he told me that, in the west of Ireland, the peasantry had a superstitious veneration for idiots and mad men, and, like the Turks, believed that in sanity and inspiration were only synonymes. The illicit whisky made in this island holds first rank in the estimation of the potecin fancier. The cause of its superior excellency may arise from the insular situation of the place, enabling thc distiller to carry on his business leisurely, and thus avoid the bad con sequences attendant on hurrying the process, \u2014 for to rapid and defective distillation may be ascribed the burnt flavour, so common in whisky produced within the range of the Revenue. The barley, also, grown in this and the other adjacent islands, is excellent \u2014 and as the spirit is drawn from a copper still, it has many advantages to recommend it. The illicit apparatus in common use is, with few excep tions, made of tin \u2014 the capture of a copper still, from thc superior value of the metal, would be a serious loss, and consequently a cheaper substitute is resorted to. shores. Hence, in his professional avocations, the priest is obliged to watch the weather carefully before he ventures to visit Inniskea\u2014 and it has not unfrequently occurred, that the rites of religion have been interrupted, and the celebrant obliged to embark at a moment's notice to avoid the consequences of being caught by a coming gale. The islanders, from constant observation of the phenomena of sea and sky, generally foresee the storm before it blows ; but even the oldest and most skilful inhabitant will frequently be surprised by an unexpected tempest. There are no people on earth more punc tilious in the interment of the dead than the peasantry osthis remote district. A strange and unaccountable custom exists of burying differ ent families, resident on the main, in island cemeteries, and great difficulty, and often times imminent peril, attends the conveyance of a corpse to its insulated resting-place. No inducement will make those wild people inter a body apart from the tomb of its fathers, and if a boat will live, the corpse will be trans ported to the family tomb. At times the weather renders this impracticable, but the deceased is kept for many days unburied in the hope that the storm may subside ; and only when frail mortality evinces unequi vocal tokens of decay, will the relatives con sent to unite its dust with the ashes of a stranger. Here, the still is considered a valuable heir loom in a family, and descends in due succes sion from father to son. When not in use, it is lowered by a rope into one of the deep caverns, with which the western face of the island abounds, and nothing but a treacherous disclosure by some secret enemy could enable the Revenue to discover the place where it is concealed, in any of the unfrequent visits they make to this remote spot. It is asserted, but with what truth I cannot pretend to state, that the inhabitants of Innis kea are prone to litigation, and a curious legend of a lawsuit is told upon the main, illustrative osthis their quarrelsome disposition. A century ago, two persons were remarkable here for superior opulence, and had become the envy and wonder of their poorer neigh bours. Their wealth consisted of a flock of sheep, when, unfortunately, some trifling dispute occurring between them, a dissolution of partnership was resolved upon. To divide the flock, one would suppose, would not be difficult, and they proceeded to partition the property accordingly. They possessed one hundred and one sheep ; fifty fell to each pro prietor, but the odd one\u2014 how was it to be disposed of? Neither would part with his moiety to the other, and after a long and angry negotiation, the animal was left in common property between them. Although the season had not come round when sheep are usually shorn, one of the proprietors, requiring wool for a pair of stockings, proposed that the fleece . That the attention of the Preventive officers is not more particularly turned to a place notorious for its inroads on the Revenue, may appear strange. In fact, this island enjoys a sort of prescriptive privilege to sin against the ordi nances of the Excise. This indulgence arises, however, not from the apathy of the Revenue, but from natural causes which are easily ex plained. A boat may approach Inniskea in the full confidence of a settled calm, and before an hour a gale may come on, that will render any chance of leaving it impracticable, and weeks will elapse occasionally before an abatement of the storm would allow the im prisoned stranger to quit those dangerous"], [63, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 59 should be taken off. This was resisted by his co-partner, and the point was finally settled by shearing one side of the animal. Only a few ! days after, the sheep was found dead in a deep ditch ; one party ascribed the accident to the cold feelings of the animal having urged him to seek a shelter in the fatal trench ; while the other contended, that the wool remaining on one side had caused the wether to lose its equilibrium, and thus the melancholy catas trophe was occasioned. The parties went to law directly, and the expenses of the suit actually devoured the produce of the entire flock, and reduced both to a state of utter beggary. Their descendants are pointed out to this day as being the poorest of the com munity, and litigants are frequently warned to avoid the fate of \" Malley and Malone.\" Notwithstanding the uncertainty of weather in Inniskea is proverbial, we had no reason to complain. The sun rose gloriously from the ocean \u2014 every cloud vanished from the rocky pinnacle of Slieve More \u2014 a stiff breeze from the north-west blew steadily, and by nine o'clock we had embarked our goods and persons ; and with as much wind as the hooker could carry her three sails to, we ran through the Sound of Devilawn, and bade adieu to this interesting and hospitable island.

It was evident that the bay was full of mackerel. In every direction, and as far as the eye could range, gulls and puffins were collected, and, to judge by their activity and clamour, there ap peared ample employment for them among the fry beneath. We immediately bore away for the place where these birds were most numerously congregated, and the lines were scarcely over board when we found ourselves in the centre of a shoal of mackerel. excite. But hanging for hours above a spillet, or enduring the drudgery of lowering and hauling in an almost interminable length of line over the side of a motionless boat, is an abomination. Like mud-shooting, this is only work for a peasant, and should accordingly be excluded from the list of gentlemanly pursuits, and con signed entirely to those with whom fishing is a trade ; and profit, not pleasure, the object of their piscatory occupations. He who has The hooker, however, had too much way. We lowered the foresail, double-reefed the mainsail, and then went steadily to work. Directed by the movements of the birds, we followed the mackerel, tacking or wearing the boat occasionally, when we found that we had overrun the shoal. For two hours we killed those beautiful fish, as fast as the baits could be renewed and the lines hauled in ; and when we left off fishing, actually wearied with sport, we found that we had taken above five hundred, including a number of the coarser species, known on this coast by the name of Horse Mackerel. experienced the glorious sensations of sailing on the western ocean, a bright autumnal sky above, a deep green lucid swell around, a steady breeze, and as much of it as the hooker can stand up to, will estimate the exquisite enjoyment our morning's mackerel-fishing afforded. In following the shoal, we had crossed the bay, and got under the Achil shore. Having made sail again, we stretched over towards the Bull's Mouth, attracted by an immense play of sea-fowls. It was nearly low water, and while running past lnnisbiggle,we observed several seals basking on the rocks. One was so curiously couched among the sea-weed, as to render its species a subject of doubt and discussion, until the close approach of the boat obliged it to quit the rock, and thus afford a distinct view, while, to use the skipper's phrase, it wabbled to the water. From the strange and unrefined ideas the seal's first appearance occasioned, accustomed as we were to see the animal in its varied attitudes of action or repose, it is not surprising that numerous and ridiculous extravagances have There is not on sea or river, always excepting angling for salmon, any sport comparable to this delightful amusement. Spillet and long line fishing are generally tedious and uninter esting ; and, unless the fish take freely, it is even with moderate success a tame and spirit less employment. How different is mackerel fishing !\u2014 full of life and bustle, everything about it is animated and exhilarating ; a brisk breeze, a fair sky, the boat in quick and con stant motion, \u2014 all is calculated to interest and"], [64, "60 WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. respective homes as fast as four oars could carry them. The awful intelligence was pro mulgated with incredible rapidity through Erris and Ballycroy. The same Leprehawn who was seen the year before the French* had reappeared, to harbinger, no doubt, some local or national calamity. To this day, the credulity of the islanders has never been dis abused, and Tom's uncouth face and scarlet nightcap is often fearfully expected to rise over the rocks by the belated fisherman, as he runs through its dangerous opening to shelter for the night in Achil Sound. had their origin in the Phoc\u00e6 tribe being seen under accidental circumstances by the wild and credulous peasantry of this remote district. To these animals, the submarine beings, who have for ages delighted the lovers of the marvellous, may, without much difficulty, be traced ; and many a wonder-stricken fisherman imagined himself watching the movements of a mermaid, while all the time he was only staring at a sea-calf. A whimsical instance of the credulity of the peasantry was mentioned by my kinsman. Some years ago, a party engaged in a fishing excursion on the coast, came -to in Achil Sound, and, leaving the boat, took up their quarters for the night in the priest's house, which was situated in a neighbouring village. One of the company was hunch-backed, with a face of singular and grotesque expression. Having indulged gloriously over-night in the native beverage, which the honest priest most liberally supplied, the httle gentleman found himself rather amiss in the morning, and determined to try what salutary effect the cool sea-breeze might have upon the fever warmth his nocturnal revelry had raised. He left the cabin accordingly, \u2014 and the early hour, with the islanders' celebrity for a simplicity of cos tume, induced him to postpone the business of the toilet to a more convenient season, and to sally forth in perfect dishabille. For a time he stragged along the shore, until reaching the point of land which forms the entrance of Achil Sound, he selected a smooth stone, and deposited his person among the rocks, to meditate the hour away, before whose expiry he could not expect that breakfast would be paraded in the cabin. The Bull's Mouth is rarely entered but with flood-water, or a powerful leading wind ; and the southern outlet of the sound at Achil Beg is similarly circumstanced. These straits are deep and dangerous, for through them the waters which flow from Blacksod and Clew Bay, and fill their extensive channel and its surrounding estuaries, rush with amazing violence ; and the rapidity with which the tides enter and recede is frightful. The opposing currents flow nearly north and south, and meet and separate at the ruins of an ancient salt-house. Here, the old mountain road terminated, and at the Farsett \u2014 as the ford across the estuary is termed\u2014 the passenger can earliest cross to the island from the main land. Indeed, the intercourse with A chil was in former days limited enough. Few persons, except those engaged in smuggling, visited this insulated district ; and many an islander lived and died without having ever seen a town. The fishing-boats and hooker, whose easy draught of water will permit it, naturally prefers a passage through the sound, when voyaging from Erris to Clew Bay, rather than the longer and more exposed course of rounding Achil Head. To effect it, however, requires some skill, and a strict attention to the tides. On the Farsett, the depth at high-water seldom exceeds eight or nine feet : and as the flow and recession of the opposing waters is astonishingly rapid, the boat must enter upon one and retire upon the other. The passage, if effected, is consequently very short, and the sound may be cleared in an hour, with the same wind that would occupy an entire day, if Achil Head were doubled. It was dead low-water. Half-a-dozen row boats, bound for the fair of Newport, and filled with men and women, were rowing merrily to the Bull's Mouth, intending to enter it upon the first of flood. Having approached close to the spot where the little gentleman was en sconsed among the seaweed, up popped an outri countenance, surmounted by a scarlet nightcap ! The effect was sudden, for till now a rock had concealed him from the boats. Instantly the women screamed, and the men betrayed unequivocal symptoms of dismay. But when the dwarf, remarking their alarm, skipped upon the stone, and uttered a wild unearthly yell which reverberated from rock to rock, the boats put about directly, and abandoned the fair of Newport, men and women, with one consent, made off for their In bad weather, both entrances, however, * The landing of the French is a common epoch among the inhabitants of Ballycroy.

The enemy was out of sight, and, with a clear sea, old Morris rounded Achil Head. When the scarecrow vanishes, it is marvellous how rapidly one's courage is rekindled ; and too late the Nepean discovered that the odds between herself and the privateer were not so desperate. In point of men and metal the Fox was indeed over whelming, but still, steady discipline and close-fighting might do wonders. Morning dawned \u2014 and its first light showed the infernal Fox but two short miles to windward ! Away went the cutter, and away went the privateer. WTith singular audacity the Fox followed into the Bay, came up hand-over-hand, and gained upon the cruiser, until the long two-and-thirty , which the Yankee mounted amidships, began to throw its shot to a most alarming proximity. The Bull's Mouth was before, and a rakish schooner that, to use a fancy phrase, \"would not be denied,\" was astern ; \u2014 there was no alternative, and for the first, and probably the last time, the King's bunting sought safety within the sound of Achil. Finding her water lessen \u2014 for she had actually crossed the Ridge Point before she hauled her wind \u2014 the Fox abandoned the pursuit, and left the Irish coast for America, where she duly arrived, after a daring and destructive, but a very unprofitable cruise. are dangerous in the extreme, and care and seamanship are necessary to pass either with safety. The peasantry are habituated to this voyage, and comparatively little risk ensues. Still many accidents have occurred \u2014 small boats have foundered in the attempt \u2014 and large hookers, when deeply laden, have perished in the conflicting eddies which opposite winds and tides occasion. The most cau tious boatmen are sometimes overtaken by squalls from the surrounding hills \u2014 and night and drunkenness have, alas ! been more fatal than all besides. Yet the Bull's Mouth, like the ordeal of mortal inquietude, leads to its haven of rest. In a gale from the westward, when the Atlantic tumbles with mountainous fury into Blacksod Bay, the fishing-boat, once within the sound, finds smooth and unbroken water. Hence, when the weather breaks, the hookers seek its shelter, there to wait until the storm moderates. Nor is it to the fisherman alone that the Bull's Mouth has afforded shelter and protec tion. Not many years ago, a large American vessel was driven upon the coast by a continu ance of westerly winds, and unable to work off, was fairly embayed within Blacksod. Shipwreck appeared inevitable \u2014 anchor after anchor was let go, but the tremendous swell from the ocean parted the cables, and the vessel drifted rapidly towards the shore. The wild and rock-bound coast to leeward terrified the crew, and, in despair, they committed themselves to their boat, abandoning the ship to her fate. A hooker's crew, which had been caught by the gale, witnessed the desertion of the vessel, and although boarding her was a service of danger, they determined to attempt her rescue. They succeeded, and the derelict bark was carried safely within the sound. Safely landed at the Lodge, \u2014 but all is in uproar ! Colonel Dwyer, an honoured and expected visitor, has arrived in safety, but he comes minus his portmanteau, which some delinquent, neither having the fear of hanging or my kinsman's wrath before his eyes, abstracted from Andy Bawn, to whom its safe delivery was entrusted. Nothing can surpass the surprise and consternation this event occa sions \u2014 the women are clamorous \u2014 the men curse fluently in Irish \u2014 and, from the vows of eternal vengeance which are uttered against the spoliator of the Colonel's wardrobe, I should imagine, in case of apprehension, that the ceremony of waiting till the next assizes will be dispensed with. Antony \"re members the country these seventy years : many a robbery happened in his time, but \u2014 God stand between him and evil ! \u2014 to take a gentleman's property, and he coming to the master ! \u2014 If it was a stranger, why there would be no great harm,\" &c. &c. To the Bull's Mouth, also, one of his Majesty's cruisers was indebted for her deliverance. During the last American war, an enemy's schooner of formidable force dragooned the coast from Arran to the Stags of Broad Haven. She landed where she pleased, and amused herself by burning every coaster that was silly enough to leave her harbour. In Achil the Fox was quite at home, \u2014 the crew trafficked, danced, and drank among the islanders, with as much sangfroid as if Paul Jones had been commander. But this could not last for ever. Some heavy sloops and brigs were ordered from the south ward, and the Fox was reluctantly obliged to disappear.

There is a confused account of the Bridge of Balryveeney, and a dark man, and the clicking of a gun-cock. Now it appears that Andy is at feud with a Mr. Burke, who finished a relative of his with a turf-slane* and in consequence has deemed it advisable to take to the mountain until terms can be arranged with the widow. Meanwhile, being a gentleman of active disposition, he occupies his leisure hours upon the highway, and all parties are unanimous in saddling him with the spoliation of the portmanteau. I am inclined to suspect that my kinsman hitherto sported deaf-adder to any rumour of Burke being concealed within his territory \u2014 but I think now, the sooner Mr. Burke levants the better. There is a settled gloom upon my cousin's brow, and yonder consultation with his foster-brother, my island friend, bodes the present proprietor of the portmanteau httle good. To intercept a visitor's effects, was indeed to Indeed the whole esprit de corps is up\u2014 the multitudinous idlers of the Lodge are concoc ting schemes of vengeance. The honour of the \"ancient house\" is at stake; and the very women are roused to action.

We shall exchange deer-shooting for robber-hunting ; andnight and the mountains being unfavourable to identity of the person, I may be shot by mis take for an outlaw, or find myself in some ravine, tete-a-tete with Mr. Burke! I plead guilty to constitutional nervousness, and for the last hour my kinsman and his visitor have been seeking a parallel case in a number of outrages, that are quite sufficient to ruin a man's rest for the winter. What memories they have ! There has not been a house robbed for the last century with whose localities they are not as well acquainted as the builder ; and in murder-cases, they display an anatomical experience that is surprising ! Hennessey, who seldom shows, has been eternally with us since the cloth was lifted, and having received his final instructions, (I hope,) has disappeared.

My kinsman is dreadfully irate \u2014 his feudal power is shaken to the centre, and either he or Mr. Burke must leave Ballycroy. It is quite evident that he tacitly permitted the outlaw to conceal himself in this neighbourhood, and considered that he existed but by his sufferance.

The Colonel's Story- -The Night Attack. \"It is thirty-five years 'this very month, since I was quartered with my regiment in ford ; I recollect the time particularly, for I got my company in the thirty-seventh on the same day that I received an invitation from a Mr. Mor den, with whom I had formed a mail-coach acquaintance, to spend a week with him, and join his nephew in partridge-shooting. This gentleman's house was fourteen miles distant from the town, and situated in a very retired part ofthe country. It was a wild but beau tiful residence, placed upon the extremity of a peninsula which jutted into an extensive lake. To a sportsman it offered all the inducements that shooting and fishing could afford. But it had others besides these ; no man lived better than Mr. Morden \u2014 and his daughter Emily, and an orphan cousin, who resided with her, were decidedly the finest women who had attended the last race-ball. No wonder then that I accepted the old gentleman's invitation willingly, and on the appointed day put myself into a post-chaise, and reached the place in time for dinner. woodbine and other creepers festooned the windows with their leaves and berries. At some distance a well stocked haggard peeped over a -spacious range of offices ; the lawn was studded with sheep, which appeared over burdened with good condition ; and as I drove up the avenue, I passed a well-featured, well clad simpleton, urging before him from a neighbouring stubble-field, a flock of turkeys, as formidable for numbers as for size. In short, everything about the place bespoke the opulence and comfort of the proprietor. \"Mr. Morden was a clever and respectable man ; he was land agent to several large estates \u2014 noted for plain and unpretending hospitality, punctuality in business, and a character of unusual determination. \"The old gentleman received me with friendly sincerity, and his fiandsome daughter added a warm welcome. They apologized for not having company to meet me, but ' two families which they had expected, had been detained by some unforeseen occurrences at home.' Dinner was shortly after served. Like the host, it was excellent without display \u2014 the wines were superior \u2014 and when the ladies left us the claret went round the table merrily. \" The house was one of those old-fashioned, comfortable Irish lodges, which are now ex tinct, or only to be seen in ruins. It was a long low building, covered with an infinity of thatch, which bade defiance to rain, cold, and storm. The tall and narrow casements reached the ground, a handsome flower-knot extended in their front bounded by a holly hedge, and \" 'We are in trouble here,' said Mr. Mor den, addressing me, ' and you have come to a house of mourning.

Poor Emily has cried incessantly since the accident.' \" I felt a strange disinclination to go to bed, and would have given anything for a book. For temporary employment, I unlocked my gun-case, put my fowling-piece together, and examined whether my servant had sent all necessary apparatus along with me. I opened the window-curtains. The moon \u2014 a full bright harvest moon was shining gloriously on the lawn and lake : I gazed on the sparkling sur face of the waters till I felt the chill of the night -breeze ; then closing the shutters, reluc tantly prepared to undress. \" ' Were they stolen ? ' \" ' Oh, no ! I wish they were, for that would afford a hope that chance or money might recover them. No, Sir, they would not follow a stranger ; alas ! they died yesterday by poison. We unfortunately laid arsenic hi a meal-loft to destroy rats\u2014 and yet how the poor animals could have got to it is a mystery ; the steward declares the key never left his possession. I would give a hundred guineas the meal had been in the bottom of the lake. By Jove ! no loss, short of the death of a friend) could have given us all so much uneasiness. They were my daughter's companions by day, and my protectors at night. Heigh ho ! \u2014 Come, Sir, pass the wine.' Tears stood in the old gentleman's eyes as he spoke of his unhappy favourites, and from the valuable properties of the lost dogs, it was not surprising that then death occasioned so much regret in the family. \" I had thrown my coat and vest aside, when a distant crash was heard, and a fearful noise with oaths and screams succeeded. I rushed into the corridor, and encountered a terror stricken maid-sen-ant running from the ex tremity of the passage. Miss Morden next appeared ; she was in complete dishabille, and had hastily thrown on a dressing-gown. ' Good God ! Captain Dwyer, what has oc curred ? ' A volley from without prevented my reply, and the crashing of the windows, as the glass was splintered by the bullets, made it unnecessary. ' The house is attacked,' she said ; and then with amazing self-possession added, ' There are always loaded guns above the kitchen fire-place.' We both ran down the corridor, she to alarm her father, and I to procure a weapon ; young Morden, armed with a sword, met us. ' The attack is upon the kitchen,' he said hastily; ' it is our weakest point ; this way, Captain,' \u2014 and we both entered it together. \" We joined the ladies in the drawing-room. After tea Mr. Morden took a bedroom-candle, and apologised for retiring. ' Old habits best suit old people, Captain ; but I leave you with the ladies, who will sit up till cock-crow, if you please : ' and bidding us a good night, he departed. \"\u25a0'Emily, said young Morden, 'you are still thinking of your favourites ; well, I will ride the country over, till I find you a hand some dog. Julia, hand me that violin from the piano, and Captain Dwyer will dance a reel with you and Emily.' \" 'Heavens! who is at the window?' ex claimed Miss Morden, suddenly ; ' it looked like that nasty beggarman who has been haunting the house and grounds these three days. Ah, Wolf and Sailor ! had you been living, that vagabond would not have ventured here at this late hour.' Henry Morden had left the room on hearing his cousin's exclama tion, but soon returned, assuring the lady that the beggar was a creature of her imagination : he had searched the shrubbery and flower garde*n, and no mendicant was to be found in either. \"There was a bright fire burning on the hearth. The large window was shattered to pieces, and the idiot I had noticed on the lawn, was standing beside the ruined casement armed with a spit, maldng momentary passes at the breach, and swearing and bellowing frightfully. I leaped upon a table to seize two muskets which were suspended in the place Miss Morden had described. I handed one to Henry, when the fire blazed out suddenly, and discovered me to the banditti without. In stantly, three or four shots were discharged. I heard a bullet whistle past my head, and felt something strike my shoulders like a sharp cut from a whip, as a slug grazed me slightly \u2014 but having secured the gun I jumped from the table uninjured. We heard Mr. Morden in the passage \u2014 his manner was calm and collec ted, as he ordered the servant-men to the \" The alarm w.-.s speedily forgotten, and we danced reels till supper was announced. The doors were locked, the windows fastened, the ladies wished us good night, and retired to their respective chambers. \" Henry and I remained for some time in the"], [69, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 65 front of the house, and dispatched his daughter for ammunition. and gave the musket I had used so successfully to Henry Morden. The death of the ruffian with the sledge brought on a heavy fire from his comrades. Between the volleys they sum moned us to surrender, with fearful denuncia tions of vengeance if we resisted longer. We were within a few yards of each other, and during the intervals of the firing, they poured out threats, and we sent back defiance. \u2014 ' Morden, you old scoundrel ! ' exclaimed the captain of the gang, ' in five minutes we'll have your heart's blood.' ' No,' was the calm reply, ' I'll live to see you arrayed in cap and halter.' ' Surrender, or we'll give no quarter.' \u2014 ' Cowardly scoundrel ! come and try your hand at the sledge ! ' said the old gentleman, with a cold and sarcastic smile, as he turned his eye on me, where I was watching the door, with the confidence a man feels who has his own trustworthy weapon to depend upon. \" Meanwhile, a dropping fire continued from without \u2014 for from within no shot had been returned, as the robbers sheltered themselves effectually behind the angles of the offices and the piers of the gates. From some hurried words we overheard they were arranging a determined attack. \" ' They will make a rush immediately,' said the elder Morden coolly, ' and here comes Emily in good time ; don't come in, love ! ' \u2014 and he took some forty or fifty cartridges which she had brought in the skirt of her dressing- gown. Notwithstanding the peril of our situation, I could not but gaze a moment on the white and statue-looking limbs of this brave and beautiful girl. ' Go, love, tell John to bring the Captain's gun- case from his chamber ; and do you, Emily, watch from the end window, and if you perceive any movement that side, apprize us of it here. \u2014 Now, my boys, be cool \u2014 I'll give my best horse to him who shoots the first man. You have a good supply of nmmunition, could we but coax the scoundrels from their shelter \u2014 and I'll try a ruse.' The old gentleman took the idiot's spit, placed a coat upon it, while Henry and- 1 chose a position at either side of the broken window. Mr. Morden raised the garment to the breach ; it was distinctly seen from with- out ; three bullets perforated it, and it fell. ' He's down, by ! ' roared a robber exul- tingly. ' Now, Murphy, now's your time ; smash in the door wilh the sledge ! ' Instantly a huge ruffian sprang from behind a gable, and his rush was so sudden that he struck twice with shattering force. We heard the hinges give \u2014 we saw the door yielding \u2014 and at that critical moment young Morden's gun missed fire ! ' Curses light upon the hand that loaded it ! ' he cried as he caught up an axe and placed himself determinate!)- before the door, which we expected to be momentarily driven in. Murphy, perceiving the tremendous effects of his blows, called to his comrades to ' be ready.' He stood about five yards from me \u2014 the sledge was raised above his head \u2014 and that blow would have shivered the door to atoms. I drew the trigger \u2014 the charge, a heavy one of duck-shot, passed like a six-pound bullet through the ruffian's body, and he dropped a dead man upon the threshold. ' Captain Dwyer,' said Mr. Morden, calmly, 'the horse is yours ! ' ' ' ' Morden ! we'll burn the house about ye.' \u2014 ' Will you put the coal in the thatch, Bul ger ? ' \u2014 ' Morden, you have a daughter ! ' and the ruffian pronounced a horrid threat. The old man shuddered, then in a low voice, tremu lous with rage, he muttered, \u2014 ' Bulger, I'll spare five hundred pounds to hang you, and travel five hundred miles to see the sight.' \" ' The coal ! the coal ! ' shouted several voices, and unfortunately the scoundrels had procured some from the laundry. ' By heaven ! they will bum us out,' said Henry, in alarm. ' Never fear ! ' replied his cooler uncle ; ' the firing must have been heard across the lake, and we'll soon have aid sufficient.' But a circumstance occurred, almost miraculously, that averted the threatened danger. The moon became suddenly overcast \u2014 heavy rain drops fell \u2014 and in an instant an overwhelming torrent burst from the clouds, rendering every attempt the robbers made to ignite the thatch abortive. ' Who dare doubt an overruling Providence ? ' said the old gentleman, with enthusiasm : ' surely God is with us ! ' \" The storm which came to our relief ap peared to dispirit our assailants, and their parley recommenced. ' Morden,' said the captain of the banditti, ' you have Lord 's rent in the house ; give us a thousand pounds, and we'll go off and leave you.' \" 'All I promise I'll perform,\" said thc old gentleman, coldly. ' Bulger, for this night's work you have earned a halter, and I'll attend and see you hanged.' \u2014 'Dash in the door,' exclaimed the robber in a fury ; ' we'll have the old rogue's heart out ! ' A volley of stones \" I had now received my own double gun, E"], [70, "66 WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. rattled against the door, but produced no effect, and again the robber parleyed. ' Will you give us a hundred, Morden?' 'Not a sixpence,' was the laconic answer. Once more stones were thrown, shots discharged, and threats of vengeance fulminated by the exasperated villains. At last, the demand was reduced to ' Twelve guineas \u2014 a guinea for each man. ' They'll be off immediately,' said the old gentleman ; ' they know assistance is at hand : would that we could amuse them for a little longer.' But the ruffians were already moving, and Miss Morden presently announced that they were embarking, twelve in number, in a boat. ' Now for a parting shot or two,' said Henry Morden. We picked up a dozen cartridges, and sallied from the house1 as the banditti were pulling hard across the lake. We opened a quick and well-directed fire, which they feebly and without effect replied to. While a musket-ball would reach them, we plied them liberally with shot ; and, as we learned afterwards, mortally wounded one man, and slightly injured two others. As we returned to the house, we met some fifty countrymen, armed with all sorts of rustic weapons, coming to our relies. Without a moment's delay, we launched boats, and set off to scour the country, and at noon, so prompt and vigorous had been the pursuit, that six of the gang, including the wounded robbers, were secured. of course known, and induced two desperate bands, who had kept the adjoining counties in alarm since the rebellion was suppressed, to unite for the purpose of robbing ' the Wilder ness,' and securing this immense booty. \" The body ofthe smith was sent away, and buried in the jail-yard of the neighbouring town ; and having brought the battle to a close, I shall explain some matters connected with this daring outrage. \" A man named Mitchell originated the intended robbery, and arranged the method of attack. He was a slight, low-sized person, but his activity was amazing, and no attempt was too hazardous for his desperate courage to undertake. On the morning of his execution \u2014 (he, with the three others, was hanged the sub sequent assizes) \u2014 he gave us a cool detail of his plans. \" The dogs were to be destroyed, and the premises reconnoitred. In the disguise of a beggar he effected both ; laid meat prepared with arsenic for the poor animals ; then made his way into the kitchen, and ascertained that the fastenings of the back-door were defective. He purposed surprising the family at supper, or forcing an entrance when they were asleep. The first attempt he made at the drawing room, but quickly perceiving that he had been observed by Miss Morden, he retired hastily. A council was held by the robbers, and it was fortunately determined to postpone the attack until the family had gone to rest. \"We reached ' the Wilderness' completely exhausted by the exertions of the morning, and the fatigue of the preceding night. We refreshed ourselves, and went to bed \u2014 but previous to returning to my room, I visited the scene of action. Another blow, even a very slight one, must have driven in the door ; and in the rush of twelve desperate ruffians, the chances would have been fearfully against us. Murphy lay upon his back \u2014 he was a disgusting object. The ground was saturated with blood, for the charge of heavy shot made as large a wound as a cannon-bullet would occasion. He was the strongest brute I ever saw ; not more than five feet eight inches in height, but his limbs, body, and arms were a giant's ; he was a blacksmith , \u2014 a man of in famous character, and most sanguinary dis position. \" Nothing could be bolder, or more likely to succeed, than Mitchell's desperate resolution. It was to leap feet foremost through the win dow, and, armed with a dagger, to fight his way, if opposed, and open the back door for his associates. He made the attempt, and providential circumstances alone prevented its being successful. That very morning a small iron bar had been placed across the window ; it caught the robber in his leap, threw him back with violence, and the noise, united to the outcries of the idiot, alarmed the family instantly. \" Circumstances, they say, will often make men courageous. In this case it had the same effect on two beings of a very different descrip tion \u2014 a lovely girl and an idiot boy. Miss Morden, throughout the trying scene, displayed the coolest courage ; and the poor simpleton, who commonly would avoid the appearance of a gun, armed with his spit, defended the breach like-- a hero. \" Our escape from robbery was fortunate indeed ; Mr. Morden had seven thousand pounds that night in the lodge, for he had just received the rents of two estates. It was almost entirely paid in specie\u2014 and this was \" We met at dinner. Juha, Miss Morden's"], [71, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 67 cousin, would hardly venture to join us, for her brother rated her timidity severely. When the alarm was heard, the fearful girl buried her face beneath the bed-coverings, and remained in pitiable agitation until the contest ended. Mr. Morden took her from his daughter's arm, kissed her, and congratulated her on their delivery from the last night's danger. \" Three years passed away : the gang had been incessantly followed by Mr. Morden, and were extirpated with the sohtary exception of Captain Bulger. Dreading the sleepless ven geance of that determined old man, this ruffian fled the country, and established himself in a disaffected district of the south. \" In the interim I got a majorityin the Seven tieth, then quartered in Cork. Soon after I joined, I happened to be field-officer of the day on which a notorious criminal was doomed to suffer. The regiment had given a guard, and curiosity induced me to attend the execution. \" ' You little coward ! ' said the old man jocu larly ; ' you must give your deliverer one kiss at least for your preservation.' The blushing girl received my salute. Miss Morden took my hand. 'You, too, Emily, will you not reward your protector ? ' Without coquetry, she laid her hps to mine, and that kiss was a sufficient recompense for twice the peril I had en countered. \" I entered the press-room. In a few minutes the malefactor appeared in white grave-clothes, attended by two priests. It was 'mine ancient enemy,' Bulger! Suddenly the sheriff was called out, and after a short absence returned, accompanied by a plain, vigorous country gentleman, enveloped in a huge driving-coat, and apparently Uke one who had travelled a considerable distance. \" But for me no praises seemed sufficient : the successful defence was attributed to my exertions ; and the fortunate shot that killed the villain smith was never to be sufficiently commended. \" My visit ended. I was in love with Emily ; but then I had little chance of succeeding to the property which afterwards, by a chapter of accidents, fell to me ; and a company of foot was all my earthly riches. She was an heiress ; and would it be generous to take advantage of a casual service to press a suit that would be as painful to refuse as unlikely to be granted ? I mean (so says vanity) by Mr. Morden. No ! I overcame the temptation of risking a trial, and returned to ford, possessing the esteem and good wishes of every inhabitant of ' the Wilderness.' \" I looked at the criminal ; he was the ruin of a powerful man, and the worst-visaged scoundrel imaginable. He was perfectly un moved, and preserved a callous sort of har diesse; and as the priests hurried over their Latin prayers, made a careless response when ever they directed him. The door leading to the drop was open, and the felon looked out upon the crowd most earnestly. ' He is not there, ' he murmured : ' he caused my apprehen sion, but he will not see me die ; ' and added, with a grim smile, ' Morden, you neither kept your word, nor proved your prophecy I' The muffled stranger stood suddenly forward : 'I am here, Bulger I I paid for your apprehen sion, and have come some hundred miles to witness your execution ! ' \"\u2022I was on parade some mornings after I re joined the regiment, when a horse, splendidly accoutred with a superb tiger-skin, holsters, saddle, and every housing fit for a field-officer, was led into the barrack-yard by a groom. The animal was a perfect picture of symmetry and strength : a dark chestnut, sixteen hands high, aad worth at least two hundred guineas. The groom presented me a letter ; it was from Mr. Morden \u2014 the horse was a present. \" ' Morden,' said the dying felon, solemnly, ' if a ghost can come back again, I'll visit you ! ' \" The person addressed smiled coldly: 'I found you unable to execute your threats while living ; and, believe me, I apprehend nothing from you when dead.' \"The clock struck\u2014 the sheriff gave the signal \u2014 Bulger advanced to the scaffold \u2014 the drop fell, and in two minutes he was a corpse.\" \" Emily and her cousin married most happily, and we have often met since. They treat me as sisters would a brother ; and we frequently talk of the night attack upon ' the Wilderness.' CHAPTER XXII. Conversation\u2014 A Brave Resistance\u2014 The Contrast\u2014 The Burglary. \"Well, I like a man to keep his word,\" said my relative ; \" and I admire your friend Morden prodigiously for his punctual attendance on Mr. Bulger, when he made his parting bow to an E 2"], [72, "68 WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. his stand behind the open door.

In house attacks, the odds are infinitely against the assailants. The attempt is generally made in the dead of night ; a robber-party are never sufficiently organized to combine their efforts judiciously, and two men within, if properly armed and plentifully sup- plied with ammunition, are in my opinion an overmatch for a dozen outside the doors.\" \" A momentary hesitation took place among the party, who seemed undecided as to which of them should first enter the dark room ; for, acquainted with the localities of the house, they knew well that there the devoted victim slept. At last one of the villians cautiously approached, stood for a moment in the door way, hesitated, advanced a step-,-not a whisper was heard, a breathless silence reigned around, and the apartment before him was dark as the grave itself. ' Go on, blast ye ! What the devil are ye afeerd of ! ' said the rough voice of an associate behind. The robber took a second step, and the old man's knife was buried in his heart ! No second thrust was requisite, for, with a deep groan, the villain sank upon the floor. \" Calm and steady courage does wonders, certainly ; and, even when surprised and un prepared, a cool man will rarely be left without some means of defence. The Scotch proverb is a true saw \u2014 ' A gleg (ready) hand never wanted weapon.' \" \" There never was a better illustration of that truth than the heroic resistance offered by an aged gentleman in the south to a band of ruffians, undermost discouraging circumstances. I knew him intimately,\" continued the Colonel; \" and I'll briefly give you the story. \" The obscurity of the chamber, the sudden destruction caused by that deadily thrust, pre vented the ruffians in the outer room from knowing the fate of their companion. A second presented himself, crossed the threshold, stum bled against his dead associate, and received the old man's knife in his bosom. The wound, though mortal, was not so fatal as the other : and the ruffian had strength to ejaculate that he was ' a dead man ! ' \" Several years ago, when the south of Ire land was, as it has ever been within my memory, in a disturbed state, a gentleman advanced in years lived in a retired country-house. He was a bachelor ; and whether trusting to his sup posed popularity, or imagining that the general alarm among the gentry was groundless, he continued in his lonely mansion long after his neighbours had deserted theirs for a safer resi dence in town. He had been indisposed for several days ; and on the night he was attacked had taken supper in his bedroom, which was on the ground-floor, and inside a parlour with which it communicated. The servants went to bed ; the house was shut up for the night ; and the supper-tray, with its appurtenances, by a providential oversight, forgotten in the old man's chamber. \"Instantly several shots were fired, but the old gentleman's position sheltered him from the bullets. A third assassin advanced, levelled a long fowling-piece through the doorway, and actually rested the barrel against the old man's body. The direction, however, was a slanting one ; and, with admirable self-posses sion, he remained steady until the murderer drew the trigger, and the ball passed him with out injury. But tlie flash from the gun un fortunately disclosed the place of his ambush, and then commenced a desperate struggle. The robber, a powerful and athletic ruffian, closed and seized his victim round the body : there was no equality between the combatants with regard to strength ; and although the old man struck often and furiously with his knife, the blows were ineffectual, and he was at last thrown heavily on the floor, with the murderer above him. Even then, at that awful moment, his presence of mind saved this heroic gentle man. He found that the blade of the knife had turned, and he contrived to straighten it upon the floor. The ruffian's hands were already on his throat \u2014 the pressure became sui- \" Some hours after he had retired to bed, he was alarmed at hearing a window lifted in the outer apartment ; his chamber-door was ajar, and the moon shone brilliantly through the open casement, rendering objects in the parlour distinct and perceptible to any person in the inner room. Presently a man leaped through the window, and three others followed him in quick succession. The old gentleman sprang from his bed, but unfortunately there were no arms in the apartment. Recollecting, how ever, the forgotten supper-tray, he provided himself with a case-knife, and resolutely took"], [73, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 69 focating \u2014 a few moments more, and the contest must have ended ; but an accidental movement of his body exposed the murderer's side : the old man struck with his remaining strength one desperate blow \u2014 the robber's grasp relaxed \u2014 and, with a yell of mortal agony, he fell dead across his exhausted opponent ! \"It was past midnight; the unsuspecting family were buried in deep repose, when Mr. was fearfully awakened by a stone shat tering the window and breaking the looking glass upon the table. He was unhappily a nervous timid man ; he was aware the house was being attacked ; a loaded carbine lay within his reach, but he appears to have abandoned all hope or thought of defending himself; \u2014 he heard the crashing of the cabin windows \u2014 he heard the appalling sound of women's shrieks \u2014 but, trembling and agitated, he had not power to leave his bed. \" Horror-struck by the death-shriek of their comrade, the banditti wanted courage to enter that gloomy chamber which had been already fatal to so many. They poured an irregular volley in, and leaping through the open window, ran off, leaving their lifeless com panions behind. \" Never did a more dastardly gang attack a house than Gallagher's. After every window was driven in, more than half an hour elapsed before one of them would enter, although no show of resistance had been offered by the inmates of the house. The cowardly villains would occasionally peep through a shattered casement and instantly withdraw. \"Lights and assistance came presently \u2014 the chamber was a pool of gore \u2014 and the old man, nearly in a state of insensibility, was covered with the blood, and encompassed by the breathless bodies, of his intended mur derers. He recovered, however, to enjoy for years his well-won reputation, and to receive from the Irish Viceroy the honour of knight hood, which never was conferred before upon a braver man.\" \" A single blow struck with good effect, one shot from the loaded carbine, would have scattered the scoundrels, and saved the family from plunder and a dreadful insult. But the unhappy man, paralyzed with terror, lay in helpless imbecility upon his bed, and the banditti, satisfied that no resistance would be offered, at last made good an entrance. \" I know a melancholy contrast to this gallant story,\" said my cousin ; \"it occurred not many years ago in an adjoining county. I heard it detailed in a court of justice as well as privately from the lips of the unfortunate gentleman, and I never shall forget his nervous agony, as he gave me a partial narrative of the outrage.\" \" They lighted candles, bound the unfortu nate gentleman, left him half dead with terror, and proceeded to ransack the premises. Soon after, shrieks from the lady's chamber an nounced their being there. They drank wine, and broke every place and thing in the expec tation of plunder. \" Oh ! let us have the particulars, Julius ; next to a good ghost story, a cmel burglary is delightful.\" \" In 18 r \u2014 ,\" said my kinsman, \"a gentleman with his family left Dublin, and removed to an extensive farm he had taken in the wild and troublesome barony of . There was no dwelling-house procurable for some time, and the strangers took up their residence in a large cabin upon the road-side, about a mile distant from the little town of ford. \"But unfortunately they were disappointed; I say unfortunately, for had they found money, it is possible the lady would have been pre served from insult. Maddened by liquor, and disappointed in their expected booty, the help less women were subjected to savage insult. \" It was naturally supposed, that coming to settle in a strange country, this gentleman had brought money and valuables along with him ; and a gang of robbers who infested that law less neighbourhood under the command of the notorious Captain Gallagher, marked the stranger for a prey. \" What must have been that wretched man's sufferings, as he listened to the supplications of his beautiful wife for pity ? Some of the villains were ' of milder mood ' than their fel lows, and a partial protection was afforded to the miserable lady. \" After a dreadful visit of three hours, the ruffians left the house. Their apprehension was almost immediate. I was present at the trial, and the testimony of that beautiful woman, lyho sat on the bench beside the Judge, with the evidence of the wretched husband, was melancholy. \" This new settler had been married but a few months, and his wife was a young and very lovely woman.

The room was papered with carica tures, and crowded with prints on sporting subjects. This was cheerful and bachelor like. I looked at the mantelpiece ; a brass blunderbuss and case of pistols were there suspended in most effective order. This brought on a train of thought, and all the pleasant narratives of my kinsman and his visitor rushed back to my recollection. I have, God help me ! no fancy for what the Irish call active amusements. I would have no ambition to hold a nocturnal colloquy with Mr. Bulger \u2014 nor wouldit afford me satisfaction to listen to solemn assurances of his determi nation to cut my throat. I would not give one farthing, to spend half-an-hour in a dark closet with three robbers and a case-knife. I love uninterrupted repose, and it would annoy me to have my window dismantled at midnight, and my entire toilet annihilated by a well-directed voUey of paving-stones. On earth there is not a more enchanting object than the exquisite symmetry of a woman's well-formed leg; but Miss Morden's would have no charms for me, if preluded by a discharge of musketry.

We are bound for the bay to lay down spillets ; and during the tedious interval which of necessity occurs before they can be lifted, we shall kill coal-fish, shoot sea-gulls, smoke cigars, and no doubt, have a further detail of atrocities from the Colonel, which would put the Newgate Calendar to the blush. It would puzzle a philosopher to determine the state of affairs in ten-fathom water ; and if you shoot in foul ground, you will probably lose the spillet, or with a world of labour dis entangle a moiety from rocks and sea-weed.

The boat approaches, and \" Blessed Mary ! can it be ? \" there sit Hennessey and the Colonel's portmanteau ! Thc embassy has succeeded, the bustle of the boatmen is commensurate to the importance of the freight, and they give way in the full con sciousness, that they carry \"C\u00e6sar and his saddle-bags.\" Mr. Burke has made the amende honorable ; my cousin looks two inches taller, and hints slily that feudal power in Ballycroy is not yet extinct ; and well he may, for the Colonel's chattels are uninjured \u2014 no rude hand has undone a buckle \u2014 not a shirt is wanting, or even the fold of a neckcloth disarranged.

This water-sport (viz., coal-fishing) is unknown \"to the many,\" and yet to him whose hands are not unacquainted with rope and oar, it affords at times an admirable amusement. friction and salt water occasion hands unused to hemp, I transferred my line to an idle boy, who proved a much more fortunate coal-fisher than I, notwithstanding the instructions of my friend Pattigo. We were bearing down to a glorious play of sea-birds, and I got a gun uncased to practise at the gulls. It was a curious and bustling scene. Above, thousands of these birds were congregated in a small circle, screaming, and rising, and dipping over a dense mass of fry, which appeared at times breaking the surface of the water, while grebes and puffins of many varieties were persecuting those unhappy sprats underneath. As we bore down, I fired at a few straggling puffins. Some were missed, some disabled, but not a clean-killed bird ! The great body of sea-fowl appeared so much engrossed with their predatory pursuits, as to neither attend to the reports of the gun, or notice the approach of the hooker until the boat's bolt-sprit seemed almost parting this countless host of floating and flying plunderers. The coal-fishing requires a stiff breeze, and if there be a dark sky it is all the better. In its detail, it is perfectly similar to mackerel fishing, only that the superior size of the coal fish makes stronger tackle and a heavier lead indispensable. An eel of seven or eight inches long is the bait. The head being removed, the hook is in troduced as in a minnow, and the skin brought three or four inches up the snoud. This latter is a fine line of two or three fathoms length, affixed to the trap-stick and lead, the weight of which latter is regulated by the rate of sailing. The coal-fish, in weight, varies from two to fourteen pounds ; it is finely shaped, immensely rapid, uniting the action of the salmon with the voracity of the pike. If he miss his first dash, he will follow the bait to the stem of the boat, \u2022 and I have often hooked them within a fathom of the rudder. Bent on destruction, I waited until we cleared the ball, and reached that happy distance when the charge should open properly. Pattigo esti mated the shot would, moderately, produce a stone of feathers. I fired ; a solitary gull dropped in the water, and half-a-dozen wounded birds separated from the crowd, and went screaming off to sea. The failure was a melancholy one. I sank immeasurably in the estimation ofthe crew as an artiste. Pattigo's bag of feathers was but an unrealized dream \u2014 while my kinsman muttered something about ihe best singlehe ever possessed \u2014 and I, to cover my disgrace, occupied myself with reloading. Four or five knots an hour is the best rate of sailing for killing coal-fish, and upon a coast where they are abundant, the sport at times is excellent. Like the pike, the coal-fish is very indifferent to the tackle used, which is generaUy very coarse. Not so the mackerel ; he requires much delicacy of line and bait to induce him to take. In light winds, or when the fish are out of humour, I have killed mackerel by substituting a salmon casting-line of single gut for the hem pen snoud commonly employed by fishermen, which with a newly-cut bait of phosphoric bril liancy commonly overcame his resolve against temptation. But there are times when a change of weather, or some inexplicable phenomena of sea or sky, render these fish dull and cautious ; for usually it requires but trifling art to kill them. \" I can't congratulate you on your gunnery,\" said my cousin, \" although I must admit, that it required some ingenuity to avoid accidents among the crowd. But give me the gun, \u2014 and here comes a victim,\" he continued, as a huge grey gull, reckless of danger, wheeled as they will do round and round a wounded companion. \" I would not be in his coat for half the hooker,\" said Pattigo, in a stage whisper. A Httle experience is necessary. The bait must be cut from the freshest mackerel, and assimilated in size and shape to the herring fry, which they generally follow ; and the way ot the boat must be so regulated as to preserve the deception by a sufficient velocity, without breaking by its rapidity the mackerel's hold. The mouth of this fish is particularly tender ; and if care be not taken, many will drop from the hook, before they can be secured onboard. \" The Lord look to him ! \" exclaimed another boatman, \" if it be not a sin to pray for a bird.\" \"He shall not carry his life to the water,\" rejoined the Master, as he laid the barrel to his eye. But, notwithstanding prayer and prophecy, the gull merely parted a few feathers, and flew off to all appearance with little injury. \" By everything blind ! \" exclaimed my kins man, \" the gun must have been charged with Unaccustomed to the painful effects which"], [78, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 74 sawdust. Ha ! let's see the flask ! Frank, Frank, thou art a careless gunner ; the powder is not worth one farthing.\" \" My grand magazine is a sort of basket, secured with a lid and padlock, and covered with a sheep-skin, which, like the coffin of Mahomet, hangs suspended between sky and earth, from the couples of the kitchen. This disposition secures it aUke against damp and accident. My arms give me an infinity of trouble, but by a weekly inspection, I manage to keep aU in order. It was true. I had forgotten my flask in the pocket of a wet cota more,* and consequently the powder was spoiled. Nothing puzzles me more, with the exception of keeping the Sheriff at a distance, than pre serving gunpowder, and preventing my arms from rusting ; and it is incredible how soon the humidity of this climate spoils the one, and causes the other, f \" It is marveUous how quickly, even with moderate care, powder spoils. With my attention I experience little inconvenience, as I always warm my flask by plunging it in boihng water before I take the field. This renders the powder sufficiently dry, without deteriorating from its strength, which expo sure to a stronger heat will inevitably occa sion. * Anglice, great-coat. f Gunpowder is composed of very light char coal, sulphur, and well-refined saltpetre. The powder used by sportsmen in shooting game, is generally composed of six parts of saltpetre, one of charcoal, and one of sulphur ; but these pro portions, as well as the introduction of other ingre dients, and the sizes of the grains, are undoubt edly varied by the different manufacturers in the composition of the powders ofthe same denomi nation, and are always kept profoundly secret. The materials are put into a wooden trough, where they are ground together, to render the contact of the nitrous and combustible particles intimate and equal throughout the whole mass. The mixture is occasionally sprinkled with water, to form an amalgam, which is afterwards granu lated, and to prevent the finer particles of the sul phur and the charcoal from flying off, which would necessarily alter the proportion of the composi tion. The powder-makers employ more or less time in the operation of grinding, in proportion to the quantity and quality of the saltpetre. When they conceive that the ingredients are properly mixed together, they from the paste form those little grains, which, being dried, obtain the name of gunpowder. There are two general methods of examining gunpowder ; one with regard to its purity, the other with regard to its strength. Its purity is known by laying two or three little heaps near each other, upon white paper, and firing one of them. For if this takes fire readily, and the smoke rises upright, without leaving any dross or feculant matter behind, and without burning the paper, or firing the other heaps, it is esteemed a sign that the sulphur and nitre were well purified, that the coal was good, and that the ingredients were thoroughly incorpo rated together ; but if the other heaps also take fire at the same time, it is presumed, that either common salt was mixed with the nitre, or that the coal was not well ground, or the whole mass not well beat or mixed tagether ; and if either the nitre or sulphur be not well purified, the paper will be black or spatted. To determine the strength of the powder, dry it perfectly, and ascertain how many sheets of paper it will drive the shot through at the dis tance of ten or twelve yards. In this trial we should be careful to employ the same size shot in each experiment \u2014 the quantity both of the shot and the pswder being regulated by exact weight ; otherwise we cannot, even in this experi ment, arrive to any certainty in comparing the strength of different powders, or of the same powder at different times. \" Bv the way, I have had more actual expe rience in this necessary article than was exactly agreeable. Come, we wiU bear away for the Lodge, and as the Colonel is immersed in 'The Packet,' and deep in the debate, I will give you the particulars. In powder I am not ' ignarus mali,' for I blew myself up, ormade an exceUent attempt, \u2014 and burned a cabin to the very ground. \" Both tales are briefly told.

Guns were procured but only one powder-flask was attainable, and it was to be a partnership concern. For this purpose it was large enough in all conscience, being an old-fashioned horn, bound with brass, and capable of holding a pound of powder. We filled it to the top. At a short distance from the house, a snipe sprang unexpectedly;\u2014 I killed it \u2014 and in attempting to reload, the charge ignited in the barrel, and the horn blew To protect guns from rust in the humid climate I have been latterly accustomed to , I found nothing answer well but strong mercurial oint ment.

My clothes were reduced to tinder, my hatscorched, my hair and eyebrows burned off, but excepting a slight cut in my hand, otherwise I was perfectly uninjured. Not a fragment of the flask, but one shattered piece of horn, could be found upon the un broken surface of the snow. H , who was about one hundred yards distant from me, described the explosion as louder than the report of a nine-pounder ; yet, to me, the noise seemed trifling. Was not this escape mira culous ? \"The agony of the poor old woman, who fortunately was outside the hovel when the explosion took place, was pitiable. In five minutes her cabin was a ruin \u2014 and to her that wretched shieling was worth a marble palace. For a time she could not be pacified. In vain she was assured ' that the master would build her anewhouse, wider,andbigger,and warmer, ay, and that should have a wooden door ! ' but, like another Rachel, shemourned, and refused to be comforted. \" The second explosion, in which I perpe trated arson, occurred some ten miles up the river. By some unhappy mischance, I took out a flask of condemned powder, and the accident was not discovered until it was too late to be remedied. To dry the powder was the alternative ; and we repaired for this pur pose to the only house within four rmles of the place, a shieling occupied by an old herdsman and his wife. \" Two or three days removed her sorrow. I sent assistance, and, progressing, like another Aladdin, the cabin rose, Ph\u0153nix-like, from its ashes. It is now the envy of the passing traveller; and as the old couple close their wooden door at night, they pray for the Master's long life, and bless God that ' a pound of powder blew up at their fire-side.' \" The powder was spread upon a wooden platter, and laid at a sufficient distance from the fire ; and while I stirred it with a ramrod at a distance, one of my attendants conceived it a fitting opportunity to roast a cast of potatoes in the embers. Both operations went forward successfully. The powder was almost dry \u2014 the potatoes nearly roasted, when my foUower ingeniously contrived to introduce a coal into the loose powder.

It was nearly dark, but the night was calm and warm. I stole from the heated room to indulge in a luxurious smoke al fresco ; and seated, upon the wall of the little pier, puffed away in Turkish indolence. The swell upon the bar was particularly distinct, as, in succes sive falls, the wave burst upon the sands, and ran hissing up the beach, till its volume of water broke and subsided. The tide was almost out, and the river which forms the channel of the estuary, would hardly reach beyond the knee; and I thought of the singular contrast that existed between the quiet stream, now scarcely a stone's throw over, and the fierce and lowering water which a westerly gale forces in, rushing every moment with in creased violence from the ocean, and threaten ing to burst over bank and rock that opposed a barrier to its rage. My musings were, how ever, speedily interrupted; voices came towards me from opposite directions, and loud and frequent laugh replied to rustic badinage and youthful romping. My cousin joined me, and from him I ascertained that the jolly parties who seemed everywhere scattered over the sands beyond the river, were the village girls"], [80, "76 WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. during one tide by the children of a single cabin. They form a valuable and wholesome addition to the limited variety that the Irish peasant boasts at his humble board, and afford children, too young for other tasks, a safe and useful employment. assembled to collect sand-eels, an employment they would pursue till the returning tide fiUed the estuary again. A little flat punt, which the servants use for bringing spring water from the bent banks, was speedily placed upon the river, and we pushed over to the opposite strand, and found ourselves surrounded by several hundreds of the young villagers of both sexes, who were busily engaged in this curious species of night-fishing. Indeed, its plentiful supply of shell-fish may be enumerated among the principal advantages which this wild coast offers to its inhabitants. Along the cliffs, whether in the islands or on the main, lobsters are found in abundance; and, if the peasantry possessed the necessary means for prosecuting the fishery, it might at times afford them a lucrative em ployment. But, simple as the apparatus is, they do not possess it ; and the lobsters ob tained by sinking pots and baskets in the deep sea are taken by strangers, who come for this purpose from a considerable distance. Those killed by the islanders are only procurable at low springs, when the ebbing of the water beyond its customary limits, permits caves and crannies in the rocks being investigated, which in ordinary tides could not be entered. The sand-eels are generally from four to nine inches in length, and lie beneath the surface seldom deeper than a foot. The method of taking them is very simple ; it is effected by passing a case-knife or sickle with a blunted edge, quickly through the sands; and by this means the fish is brought to the surface, and its phosphoric brilliancy betrays it instantly. At the particular times during the summer months when these eels run in upon the estuary, quantities sufficient to sill several barrels have been collected during a night. When dressed the fish is reckoned by the peasantry a great delicacy, but to my taste it is much too strong. But they are sought after for other purposes ; from the particular brilliancy of the skin they make an admirable bait for flat-fish; and hence a spillet-settee prefers them to every other kind, as they are much more durable than the lug,* and infinitely preferable to eels of a coarser size. Crabs are found on this coast of consider able size and sufficiently numerous. Like the lobsters, they are only accidentaUy procured ; but there is no doubt but a large supply could be obtained if proper means were employed to take them. The most esteemed of all the shell-fish tribe by the western fishermen is the scaUop, which here is, indeed, of very superior size and flavour. They are commonly found by the oyster-dredgers in deep water, and are esti mated so highly as a luxury, as to cause their being transferred to the next gentleman who may have been serviceable to the peasant who finds them, or whose future favour it may be advisable to propitiate. Indeed, in former days, and those too not very distant from our own times, to approach a justice of the peace without \" a trifle for his honour,\" would be an offence of passing magnitude ; a basket of chickens, a cleave of scallops, or an ass-load of oysters, harbingered the aggriever and the aggrieved. If these formulae were not duly attended to, the fountain of law was hermetic ally sealed, and a house functionary \u2014 for all the servants on the establishment were \" four pound constables\" \u2014 announced that \"his honour would do no justice,\" and bundled off the applicant to some one more approachable of his Majesty's numerous and poor esquires. The oysters found in the bays and estuaries along this coast are of a very superior quality ; In speaking of this nocturnal fishery, if a search in the sands may be so termed, my cousin said that it was a source of considerable trouble to himself and the priest in their re spective vocations : for accidents of a delicate description were occasionally to be lamented, and many an unhappy calamity was traced to \"the returning from the sand-eels.\" Whether the danger of this curious pursuit enhanced its enjoyment is questionable ; but, regardless of the frequent mishaps, which prudent mothers would of course duly enumerate, the fair por tion of the peasantry waited anxiously for twilight, and then, fortified by maternal advice and female resolution, set off in troops to the strand to share the pleasures and the perils of this interesting but dangerous amusement. A crowd of a more youthful description of the peasantry are collected every springtide to gather cockles on the same sands by daylight when the tide answers. The quantities of these shell-fish thus procured would almost exceed belief; and I have frequently seen more than would load a donkey collected The sand-worm used by fishermen."], [81, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 77 and their quantity may be inferred from the fact, that on the shores where they are bedded a turf-basket, large enough to contain six or seven hundred, can be fiUed for a sixpence. A couple of men will easily, and in a few hours, lift a horse-load ! \u2014 and, notwithstanding the numbers carried off by sailing-boats from Clare and Munster, the stock appears to be little reduced by the constant dredging. There are, besides these, other shell-fishes greatly prized by the peasantry, but which I had never had the curiosity to eat, such as razor fish, clams, and various kinds of muscles. These occasionally make a welcome change in the otherwise unvarying potato diet, and, better still, employ the idler members of the family, whose youth or age unfits them for more laborious exertions. inevitable, was overtaken, and Achil found as comfortably asleep as if he were in his accus tomed crib in the barn. The ebullitions of Peeterein's sorrow while the fate of theskiff and boy were still uncertain astonished me; and when I saw the punt in tow, I observed that, as the boy was recovered, he might now cease his lamentations. \u2014 ' The Lord be blessed ! there she is ; another minnit would have made noggin-staves of her ! Arrah ! and did ye think it was Achil I was frettin after \u2014 the devil pursue him for an unlucky member ! No, faith \u2014 I was in sore distress, for my brother's shoes were aboard ! ' \" We were assembled round the breakfast table this morning, and it was a questionable affair whether we should pass the forenoon in the warren, or shoot a spillet on the banks, when the conclave was dissolved by one of those incidental alarms that diversify the rustic monotony of our common-place existence. The spring tide had left the channel nearly dry, and, except in some deep pools, the water was but ankle deep. Into one of these an unlucky seal had been seduced in pursuit of a salmon, and his retreat was cut off before he was aware that his iU-timed chasse would cause his ruin. On his being discovered, a host of cockle- gatherers formed across the neck of the hole, while a breathless courier brought the tidings to the Lodge. Instantly all was bustle ; a salmon-net was procured, and the whole of the \"Dramatis Person\u00e6,\" even to the Colonel and the Priest, were speedily armed with divers and deadly implements. Old Antony had hobbled off at the first alarm, and, by the prudent plan of taking time by the forelock, managed to be the first man at the scene of action. It was a deep and rather an extensive pool, and the unfortunate seal absconded to the place most likely to afford concealment till the flood tide should liberate him from the hand of his enemies. But, alas ! they were many and malignant ; and, driven from his deepest and last retreat, to avoid being meshed in the net, he was forced upon the shoal, when an otter-spear, struck to the socket of the grains by the vigorous arm of Hennessey, kiUed him without a struggle. When the net was brought ashore, the moiety of a large salmon remained in the meshes, and told the errand which induced the defunct seal to com mit himself to the faithless shoals which proved so fatal to him. We dallied so long among the fairer portion of the sand-eel fishers, that the tide insensibly rose ; and when we reached the place where our punt had been secured, we discovered that the water had crept up the sands, and floated the frail skiff away. To hail and get a boat from the Lodge, from the calmness of the night, was readily effected ; and whde it was being launched down the beach, my kinsman told me that it was not the first time that the treacherous punt had played truant to its crew. \" On a stormy evening, one of the boatmen was ordered to cross the estuary for spring water, and set out accordingly for a supply, accompanied by a wild-looking and nonde script animal who infests the premises, who is known to the establishment by the name of 'Achil.' The river was flooded, the evening stormy, and Peeterein, after leaving his coad jutor in strict charge of the skiff, set off to fill his water-vessels, and to return, if possible, before the dusk had fallen into darkness. Achil, as the evening was chilly, lay down in the bottom of the skiff to shelter himself from the piercing east wind ; and, in place of keeping watch and ward, like an able mariner, composed himself to sleep. Meanwhile, the river rose fearfuUy ; the breeze freshened into a gale ; and when Peeterein hurried back with his water- vessels, he had the satisfaction of seeing the punt half a mile down channel, hurrying as fast as a flooded river and a freshening storm could urge it to the bar, which now broke in thunder. I had been shooting on this side, and reached the strand while Peeterein was haUooing for assistance. A boat was rapidly despatched \u2014 the skiff, when its destruction appeared This is, indeed, a day of incidents. Dinner"], [82, "78 WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. was just removed, when, on the top of a flood, a coast-guard galley ran in with a leading breeze from the westward. The very elegant proportiens of the boat, the happy attitude, the snowy whiteness of her large lugs, as with the favourable light which a sunless but clear blue sky gave, she rounded the headland, and came up like a race-horse to the pier, had caUed our undivided attention to her arrival. WhUe conjecture was busy as to what her business might be, we observed a man with his arm slung in a handkerchief, and apparently in considerable pain, leave her. The cause was soon ascertained, for a serious accident had occurred, and we aU adjourned to the kitchen, where Antony was already occupied with the wound. for increased effect and superior elegance in the formation of fire-arms, as for any other mechanical improvement, will be admitted by aU but the most prejudiced of the old school. Antique gunners may stUl be found, who are obstinate in preferring the flint to the percussion plan ; but any person who has suffered the disappointments that the best guns on the former principle will entail upon those that carry them, and particularly in wet and stormy weather, will freely admit the wonderful advantages that this simple and effective invention, the copper cap, confers upon the modern sportsman. The misery entailed upon the man who in rain and storm attempts to load and discharge a flint gun, may be reckoned among the worst upon the human catalogue ; and if he who has suffered repeated disappointments of eternal misses and dilatory explosions, from a thick flint and a damp pan, tried the simple and elegant improvement now in general use, he would abandon the stone gun for ever. It appeared that a gun, with which the poor fellow had been shooting rabbits, had burst and shattered his hand ; and when I saw the whole of the palm sadly lacerated, and the thumb attached by a small portion of the muscles, I really feared to save it was a hopeless task. But Antony and my kinsman thought differently. The old man bound the wound up with a professional neatness that I could not have expected from him ; the patient was accommodated in the Lodge, and in a fortnight the galley again returned, to bring him, thoroughly convalescent, to his station. It has been said that gun-making is only brought to perfection in London, and that the Irish are not able to compete with their English rivals. I am of this opinion, I confess, and decidedly partial to a London gun ; and while I admit thatl have occasionaUy met with exceUent sire-arms produced by Dublin makers, yet they are, in finish and elegance, far behind those which one gets from any of the leading artists in the great metropolis. To point to any particular name, among the host of London makers, would be absurd. From any of a dozen a person will be certain of obtaining a first-rate implement ; and from the Mantons, Purday, Egg, and many others, guns ofthe most efficient qualities and beautiful finish will be procured. I had some curiosity to examine the unlucky gun that caused the mischief. There was a longitudinal rent along the barrel, of seven or eight inches, terminating where the left hand usually grasps the stock. There had, no doubt, been a deep flaw in the inside of the metal ; for the wounded man declared that he had not loaded the gun beyond the customary charge. It proved to be one of those wretched affairs which are constantly smuggled into Ireland, and sold under the denomination of London guns, but which, it is weU known, are fabricated in Birmingham ; and the extent to which this dangerous imposition upon public safety is carried, would scarcely be credited. There is a constant demand in this unhappy country for fire-arms ; the well affected and disaffected seek them for very different purposes ; \u2014 one wants them for defence, the other requires them for aggression ; and every steamer that arrives from Liverpool has generally some stands of contraband arms on board. Some sportsmen are partial to such makers as forge their own barrels, and who thus afford them an opportunity of seeing their gun in progress from its commencement to its finish ; and I acknowledge that I like to see my barrels fabricated ; not but that I believe the greatest pains are bestowed upon proving his barrels by every gunmaker of character, and that none will be permitted to leave the shop of any reputable artist that have not been faithfully tested as to strength and safety. So much depends on individual fancy, as well as the personal formation of the shooter, that no two persons wiU exactly select the same gun. He who has long ar short arms, or any peculiarity in the formation of neck or That our times should be as far distinguished"], [83, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 79 shoulders, wUl require, according to circum stances, a differently shapen stock. Every man knows the gun best suited to his taste and figure, and few can shoot with one that differs materially from that which he has been been accustomed to. To teU an experienced sportsman the qualities a finished gun should possess, would be giving him unnecessary information ; and should the neophyte on this head wish for ample instructions, let him consult Colonel Hawker, and he, honest man, will open up all the arcana ofthe craft ;\u2014 and though he may not teach him \"the cunning trick of shooting;\" he will, if his advice be attended to, enable him to thoroughly comprehend the requisite qualities of an efficient and well-finished fowling-piece. When a gun begins to exhibit symptoms of having done its work, the sooner a man discards it the better. An injured barrel, or enfeebled lock, may prove fatal to the owner or his associates. Accidents every day occur, and very lamentable consequences arise from a culpable neglect in retaining arms that should be declared unserviceable, and of course dis used. I had once a favourite gun, which, from constant wear and tear, exhibited unequivocal weakness in the lock, and which I had been earnestly recommended by a veteran sports- man to discard. On a cold and rainy day I was with my friend, O'M , shooting woodcocks in the heath, and having sprung several, which, from the severity of the weather, were as wild as hawks, we marked them into a ravine, and determined to tie up the dogs, and endeavour to steal upon them. To keep my gun dry, I placed it under the skirt of my jacket, with the muzzle pointing downwards. My companion and our attendant were busy coupling the dogs, when the gun exploded, and the charge passed between O'M\u2014 's bosom and the back of a dog he was in the act of securing, buried itself at the foot ofthe keeper, covering him with mud and gravel. From the close manner in which we were aU grouped, how the shot could have entered the ground, without kiUing men or dogs, or both, was miraculous. I was desperately frightened, and from that moment forswore, for ever, the use of weakened locks and attenuated barrels. Indeed, it is a miserable species of economy for a sportsman to purchase an inferior gun. To expect that the' low-priced ones which are manufactured in country towns wUl be either safe or durable, is an absurdity. No doubt the charges of some fashionable makers are exorbitant ; and from more moderate trades men, of excellent repute, an equally good gun may be procured at a considerably less price. But if a London maker be expensive, he certainly gives you the best article that improved machinery and the first workmen in the world can produce. With common care it will nearly last a lifetime ; and the smaU consideration between a warranted, and a flimsy and hastily-formed fowling-piece, wiU be too contemptible for a person to place in competition with personal security and sporting comfort.

But generaUy some considerable distance must be travelled before the sportsman can reach his beat from his quarters. The morning is consumed on horseback or in the shooting-cart ; the same road must again be accomplished before night ; and hence, the middle of the day is, of necessity, the portion devoted to the pursuit of game. fast. The road by which we reached our shooting-ground, is the sole means by which this our terra incognita, is connected with the rest of Christendom. It is rough and dangerous in the extreme, and impracticable to every quadruped but the ponies of the country. In place of mile -stones, which mark better fre quented roads, heaps of irregular-sized pebbles meet the eye, and a stranger will be at a loss to assign their uses. They are melancholy memorials of uncivilized society, and either mark the scene of murder, or the place where a corpse has been rested in the progress of a funeral. These tumulti are numerous \u2014 and many a wild and fearful record of former violence is associated with them. The greater portion of these cairns record loss of life, consequent upon drunkenness ; and the stone, at present, appears as fatal as the middog * in former days. To find the birds, when, satisfied with food, they leave the moor to bask in some favourite haunt, requires both patience and experience ; and here the mountain-bred sportsman proves his superiority over the less practised shooter. The packs then lie closely, and occupy a small surface on some sunny brow or sheltered hoUow. The best-nosed dogs will pass within a few yards, and not acknowledge them ; and patient hunting, with every advantage of the wind, must be employed to find grouse at this duU hour. We left our horses at the old bridge of Ballyveeney, and proceeded to make an exten sive circle of the moors, skirting, as we went along, the bases of the ridge of hiUs, which shuts out Erris from the interior. But if close and judicious hunting be neces sary, the places to be beaten are comparatively few, and the sportsman's eye readUy detects the spot where the pack is sure to be dis covered. He leaves the open feeding-grounds for heathery knowes and sheltered valleys \u2014 \u25a0 and, while the uninitiated wearies his dogs in vain over the hiU-side, where the birds, hours before, might have been expected, the older sportsman profits by his experience, and seldom fails in discovering the dell or hiUock, where, in fancied security, the indolent pack is re posing. It was eleven o'clock when the dogs were uncoupled. The breeze was brisk and warm, and the ground was either undulated into hillocks, orintersected by rivulets, whose broken banks were thickly covered with luxurious heath. It was a beat, on which a grouse shooter would risk a kingdom, \u2014 it realized our expectations, and we found game abundantly. Hunting for grouse during the basking hour of the day is rigidly prohibited by all gentle men who compile sporting directories ; and yet every shooter knows, that at these pro scribed hours, himself is commonly on the moors. Morning and evening, when the birds We had been upon the moors some hours \u2014 our walk was enlivened by success, and the time had arrived when the commissariat was required, and old John's supplies were ordered from the rear. A rivulet was reported to be just round the hill, and thither our course was directed. * This weapon, I believe, was almost confined to the west of Ireland, and at this time is rarely met with. Yet some centuries back, it was as constantly borne by the Milesians, as the dirk in the Highlands, and the stiletto in Italy, All the legendary tales of blood usually employ it as the means of violence ; and Old Antony says, that in his youth the old people shuddered when they named it. I never saw but one ; it was a broad bladed dagger, about fifteen inches long, of clumsy workmanship, and hasted with a piece of deer's horn. From the formidable figure the mid doge cuts in ancient chronicles, the temper of the blade was supposed to be superior to any weapon forged in these degenerated days ; and I heard an old man assert that he had seen one, which, when held up and let fall perpendicularly but a few feet, would pierce through three half crown pieces \u2014 Credatjnd\u0153us! \u2014 This interesting and valuable implement, according to his ac count, was lost \" during the French,\" that is, at the period of the French invasion in '9b. We turned a rugged brow suddenly, and never did a sweeter spot present itself to an exhausted sportsman ; and resting on the bank of a ravine, where a smaU stream trickled over a precipice, forming beneath its brow a basin of crystal water, we selected this for our \" bivouac. \" Wild myrtle and shrub-like heather closed the opposite sides, and one spot. where the rivulet elbowed back, was covered with short green moss, that seemed rather an effort of human art than a piece of natural arrangement. Here we rested \u2014 and while baskets were"], [85, "81 WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. unpacked, and the cloth extended upon the velvet surface we reposed upon, I looked with feelings which I cannot describe, upon the wild and melancholy scene below. leaving the attendants to discuss the fragments of the feast, where they might best obtain shelter, we hurried down the hill, and crouched beneath the ruins of the chapel. It was a ruined chapel and deserted burying place \u2014 one gable of the building alone was standing, and, from beneath the ivied waU, a spring gushed out and united itself with the rivulet I have described. A stone cross, whose rude workmanship showed its antiquity, was erected beside the fountain ; and although the cemetery had long since been deserted, a circle round the weU * was freshly worn in the turf, and a woman at the moment was performing an act of devotion, on her bare knees, making an occasional pause, to offer up a prayer and drop a bead from her rosary. There is more grandeur in an Alpine storm than can be imagined by those who have not witnessed its effect. As the thunder crashes over the hiUs, and mUes away is reverberated from the opposite mountains, the loneliness of the wUderness is in fine keeping with the anger of the elements. The rain-drops now fall faster \u2014 quick and vivid flashes burst from the southern heavens, and roll after roll suc ceeded, like sustained discharges of artillery. The dogs, in evident alarm, cowered at our feet, soliciting mortal protection from what, instinct told them, were the visitations of an awful power. Suddenly, one prolonged and terrific crash burst overhead \u2014 a deluge of rain descended \u2014 and rapidly as it came on the storm passed away \u2014 the peals became fewer and more distant, and in five minutes died in sullen murmurs among the distant hills. The vaUey had a solemn and imposing character ; everything about it was lonely and desolate. No traces of human visits were dis cernible ; no pathway led to the rain, \u2014 aU was deep unbroken soUtude ; a haUowed and melancholy spot, where the living seldom presumed to approach the mansions ot the dead. \" Is not this, indeed, sublimity?\" said my kinsman, as he broke a sUence of some minutes. \" To convey ideas of the grand and terrible, give me a storm in the mountains, and let it be viewed thus : sheltered by the ivied wzrils of a ' toppling ' ruin, and surrounded by the dwellings ofthe dead.\" The breeze feU, the air became unusuaUy oppressive, the hiU behind robbed us of the little wind that still partiaUy cooled the sultry atmosphere ; a distant muttering among the mountains was faintly heard, and a sound like a rising stream, was audible. Suddenly, a black cloud rose like magic upon the summit ofthe mountain, and a flash of light succeeded. \" The storm is on,\" said my kinsman, and \" How comes it,\" I inquired, \" that, contrary to the known attachment ofthe lower Irish for ancient places of interment, this seems to be neglected and disused?\" \" You are right,\" he replied ; \" although it was once the only burying-ground to which the inhabitants of this district conveyed the dead for interment, more than two centuries have elapsed since it has been abandoned. There is a curious tradition connected with its desecration, which Antony will be too happy in narrating, and as the clouds appear collecting on the hUls, I propose that we retreat in good time, for it is rare to find such shelter on the moors, as that afforded us by the rains of Knock-a-thample.\" * * The following passage is quoted from \" The Minstrelsy of the Border \" : \u2014 \" Many run super- stitiously to other wells, and there obtain, as they imagine, health and advantage ; and then they offer bread and cheese, or money, by throw- ing them into the well.\" And again: \"In the bounds of the lands of Eccles, belonging to a lineage of the name of Maidand, there is a loch, called the Dowlouch, of old resorted to, with much superstition, as medicinal both for men and beasts, and that with such ceremonies as are shrewdly suspected to have begun with witchcraft, and increased afterwards by magical directions. For bringing of a cloth or somewhat that did relate to the bodies of men or women, and a shoe or tether belonging to a cow or horse and these being cast into the loch, if they did float it was taken for a good omen of recovery, and a part of the water carried to the patient, though to remote places, without saluting or speaking to any they met by the way ; but if they did sink, the recovery of the party was hope less. This custom was of late much curbed and restrained ; but since the discovery of many medicinal fountains near the place, the vulgar, holding that it may be as medicinal as these are, at this time begin to rcassume their former practice.\" \u2014 Macfarlione's MSS.

Certainly, the home consumption of Knock-a-thample was on a limited scale \u2014 and the herdsman and his wife, who then occupied the ruined cottage near the church, owed their winter comforts to the munificence of the strange pilgrims, who during the summer season resorted in numbers to the weU. appellation of the Red Pedler. He was a strong, under-sized, and Ul-visaged man; mean in his dress, and repulsive in his appear ance. The Pedler directed a keen and inquisi tive look at the belated traveller, who, to escape the sinister scrutiny of his smaU but piercing eyes, turned to where the herdsman's wife was occupied in preparing the simple supper. The peasant gazed with wonder at her guest ; for never had so fair a face been seen within the herdsman's dweUing. While her eyes were stUl bent upon the stranger, a fortuituous opening of the mantle displayed a sparkling cross of exquisite beauty, which hung upon the youth's bosom ; and more than once, as it glittered in the uncertain light of the wood fire, she remarked the rich and sparkling gem. It was late in October, and the pilgrimages were over for the year \u2014 winter was at hand \u2014 the heath was withered, and the last flower had faUen from the bog-myrtle \u2014 the booties * were abandoned, and the cattle driven from the hills. It was a dark evening ; and the rain which had been coUecting on the mountains began to faU heavily, when a loud knock disturbed the inhabitants of the cabin. The door was promptly unbarred, and a young and weU-dressed stranger entered, received the customary welcome, with an invitation to join the herdsman's famUy, who were then preparing their evening meal. The extreme youth and beauty of the traveUer did not escape the peasant's observation, although he kept his cap upon his head and declined to put aside his mantle. When morning came, the Pilgrim took leave of the hospitable peasants, and as he inquired the road to the holy well, slipped a rose-noble into the hand of the herdsman's wife. This was not unnoticed by the Red Pedler, who proffered his services as guide, which the youth modestly, but firmly, declined. The pUgrim hastened to the fountain, performed the customary ceremonies before noon, and then took the mountain path, leading through an opening in the hiUs, to a' station,* which, though particularly lonely, was usuaUy selected by good Catholics for a last act of devotion, when returning from visiting at the blessed weU. The Pedler, who, on various pretences, had loitered near the place, soon afterwards departed in the same direction. An hour before the young stranger had arrived, another, and a very different visitor, had demanded lodging for the night. He belonged also to another country, and for some years had trafficked with the mountain peasantry, and was known among them by the The Booties, in the mountain districts, are an interesting remnant of antiquity ; and refer evidently to that period when Ireland was in its wild and unsettled state. They are simply one or more temporary sheilings, or huts, con structed with rude materials, in spots the most convenient for attending to the cattle in the summer and autumn, when they are allowed to depasture on the mountains. According to the usual leases granted by the landlord to the tenant in this wild country, vil lages in the lowlands, or on the coast, have a reserved right of pasturage on particular por tions of the adjacent hills ; and in some cases the distance from the tenant's habitation to this mountain pasturage will exceed a dozen miles. Hence it is impossible to pay the requisite attention to the cattle, without residing on the spot; and a part of the family, generally the young girls, are detached to bivouac in the hills, and attend to the herding and milking of the cows. That night the herdsman's famUy sought repose in vain : \u2014 wUd unearthly noises were heard around the hovel; and shriek and laughter, awfuUy mingled together, were borne upon the breeze which came moaning from the mountains.

These huts are always erected in lone and beautiful valleys, generally on the bank of a rivulet, and placed beneath the shelter of a cliff. When the season closes, they are deserted until the following year ; and a few hours' work suffices to render them habitable w-hen the returning summer obliges the fair villagers to resume their wild and pastoral employment. The tidings of this desperate deed flew through the country rapidly. The body was carried to the herdsman's cabin. For many * A place of penance frequented by Catholic devotees. F 2"], [88, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 84 He had been but a few minutes absent, when the door opened, and another visitor entered with scanty ceremony, and, though unbidden, seated himself upon the stool of honour. His dress was far better than his mien, and he assumed an appearance of superiority, which, even to the peasants, appeared forced and unnatural. He caUed authoritatively for supper, and the tones of his voice were quite famUiar to the herdsman. With excited curiosity, the peasant flung some dried flax upon the fire, and, by the blaze, recognised at once the weU-remembered features of the Red Pedler ! hours life had been extinct, and the distorted countenance of the hapless youth bespoke the mortal agony which had accompanied the spirit's flight. One deep wound was in his side, inflicted evidently by a triangular weapon ; and the brilliant cross and purse of gold were gone. The women from the adjacent vUlages assembled to pay the last rites to the remains of the murdered PUgrim. Preparatory to being laid out, the clothes were gently removed from the body, when a cry of horror burst from aU \u2014 the Pilgrim was a wotnan ! Bound by a violet ribbon, a bridal ring rested beside her heart ; and, from unequivocal appearances, it was too evident that the feU assassin had com mitted a double murder. Before the peasant could recover his suiprise, the tall stranger entered the cottage again, and approached the hearth. With an air which could not be disputed, he commanded the intruder to give place. The waving of his hand was obeyed, and, with muttered threats, the Pedler retired to the settle. The Knight leaned against the rude waUs of the chimney, and remained absorbed in bitter thought, until the humble host told him that the meal was ready. The obsequies of the unhappy lady were piously performed ; the mountain girls decked her grave with flowers ; and old and young, for many a mUe around, offered prayers for the soul ofthe departed. The murder was involved in mystery \u2014 the peasants had their own sus picions, but fear caused them to be sUent. A year passed \u2014 the garland upon the stranger's grave was carefully renewed \u2014 the viUage maidens shed many a tear as they told her melancholy story ; and none passed the turf which covered the murdered beauty, without repeating a prayer for her soul's repose. If a contrast were necessary, it would have been found in the conduct of the strangers at the board. The Knight ate like in anchorite, while the Pedler indulged his appetite largely. The tall stranger tempered the aqua vit\u00e6 pre sented by the host copiously with water, whde the short one drank fast and deep, and appeared anxious to steep some pressing sorrow in the goblet. GraduaUy, however, his brain felt the influence of the liquor, and, unguarded from deep and repeated draughts, he thus addressed the host : \u2014 Another passed \u2014 the third anniversary of the PUgrim' s death arrived. Late on that eventful evening, a tall and noble-looking stranger entered the herdsman's cottage. His air was lofty and commanding ; and though he wore a palmer's cloak, the jeweUed pommel of his rapier glanced from beneath the garment, and betrayed his knightly dignity. The beauty of his manly countenance forcibly recaUed to the peasants the memory of the iU-starred stranger. But then admiration was checked by the fierce, though melancholy, expression of the handsome features of the stranger ; and if they would have been inclined to scrutinize him more, one stern glance from his dark and flashing eye imperiously forbade it. Supper was prepared in silence, until, at the Knight's request, the herdsman detailed minutely every circumstance connected with the lady's murder. \" Markest thou a change in me, feUow ? \" \"FeUow!\" quoth the peasant, half af fronted ; \" three years ago we were indeed fellows; for the Red Pedler often sought shelter here, and never was refused.\" \" The Red Pedler ! exclaimed the tall stranger, starting from his reverie, as if an adder had stung him ; and fixing his fiery glance upon the late visitor, he examined him from head to foot. \"You will know me again, I trow,\" said the Pedler, with extraordinary assurance. WhUe the peasant's narrative proceeded, the stranger underwent a terrible emotion, which his stem resolution could not entirely conceal. His eyes flared, his brows contracted tUl they united ; and before the tale was ended, he leaped from his seat, and left the cabin hastily. \" I shall,\" was the cold reply. \"Well,\" said the new-comer, \"though three years since I bore a pack, I'U wager a rose-noble that I have more money in my pouch than half the beggarly knights from Galway to Athlone. There!\" he exclaimed, as he flung his cloak open, \" there is a weighty"], [89, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 85 purse, and here a trusty middoge, and a fig for knighthood and nobihty ! \" bosom, resumed his former cold and haughty bearing. \" Slave ! \" said the stranger, in a voice that made the peasants tremble, \" breathe not another word until thou hast satisfied my every question, or, by the Mother of Heaven ! I'll cram my rapier down thy false throat ; \" and, starting on his feet, he flung his mantle on the floor. \" Fellow! \" he cried to the trembling pea sant, \" hence with that carrion. Come hither, Monk \u2014 why gapest thou thus ? hast thou never seen a corpse ere now ? Approach, I would speak with thee apart \" \u2014 and he strode to the further end of the cottage, followed by the churchman. \u2014 \" I am going to confide to thee what \u2014 \" Though surprised, the Pedler was not dis comfited by the dignity and determination of his antagonist. \" The penitent should kneel,\" said the old man, timidly. \"Yes!\" he suUenly replied, \"I wear no rapier \u2014 but this middoge has never faUed me at my need,\" and drawing from his bosom a long triangular weapon, he placed it on the table. \u2014 \" Sir Knight,\" he continued, \" the handle of my tool is simple deer-horn ; but, by the mass ! I have a jewel in my breast, that would buy thy tinseUed pommel ten times.\" \" Kneel ! \" exclaimed the Knight, \" and to thee, my feUow mortal ! Monk, thou mistakest \u2014 I am not of thy faith, and I laugh thy priest craft to derision. Hearken, but interrupt me not. The beauteous being whose blood was spilled in these accursed wilds, was the chosen lady of my love. I stole her from a convent, and wedded her in secret ; for pride of birth induced me to conceal from the world my marriage with a fugitive nun. She became pregnant, and that circumstance endeared her to me doubly, and I swore a solemn oath, that if she brought a boy, I would at once announce him as my heir, and proclaim my marriage to the world. The wars called me for a time away. Deluded by the artifice of her con fessor, my loved one was induced 'to come hither on a pilgrimage, to intercede with thy saint, that the burden she bore might prove a son. Curses light upon the shaveling that counselled that fatal journey ! Nay, cross not thyself, old man, for I would execrate thy master of Rome, had he been the false adviser. Thou knowest the rest, Monk. Take this purse. She was of thy faith, and thou must say masses for her soul's health. Yearly shall the same sum be sent to thy convent ; see that aU that prayers can do be done, or by my hopes of grace, thy hive of drones shall smoke for it. Doubt me not. \u2014 De Burgo wiU keep his word to the very letter. And now, fare well ! I hurry from this fatal spot for ever ; my train are not distant, and have long since expected me. \" Thou liest, slave ! \" exclaimed the Knight. \"To the proof, then,\" said the Pedler; and opening a secret pocket, he produced a splendid cross. \"Villain!\" said the taU stranger, under deep emotion, \" surely thou hast robbed some hapless traveller ! \" \"No!\" replied the Pedler, with a cool smile ; \"I was beside the owner of this cross when his last sigh was breathed ! \" Like lightning the stranger's sword flashed from its scabbard. \" Murderer ! \" he shouted in a voice of thun der, \" for three years have I wandered about the habitable earth, and my sole object in living was to find thy caitiff self; a world would not purchase thee one moment's re spite ! \" and before the wretch could more than clutch his weapon, the Knight's sword passed through his heart \u2014 the hilt struck upon the breast bone, and the Red Pedler did not carry his life to the floor. The stranger for a moment gazed upon the breathless body, and having with the dead man's cloak removed the blood from his blade, replaced it cooUy in the sheath. The Pedler's purse he flung scomfuUy to the peasant, but the cross he took up, looked at it with fixed attention, and the herdsman's wife remarked, that more than one tear feU upon the relic. As he spoke, he took his mantle from the floor, and wrapped it round him carelessly ; then, as he passed the spot where the body of the murderer lay, he spumed it with his foot, and pausing for a moment, looked at the Monk \u2014 Just then the grey-haired Monk stood before him ; he had left his convent to offer up the mass, which he did on every anniversary ofthe pUgrim's murder. He started back with horror as he viewed the bleeding corpse ; while the Knight, having secured the cross within his \" Remember !\" he said in a low voice, which made the old man shudder, and passing from the cabin, he crossed the heath and disappeared. But the terror of the herdsman's family did"], [90, "86 WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. not abate with his departure ; a dead man lay before them, and the floor was deluged with his blood. No human help was nigh ; before daylight assistance could not be expected ; and no alternative remained, but to wait patiently for the moiTow. Candles were lighted up, the hearth was heaped with fuel, and a cloth thrown over the corpse, which they lacked the courage to remove. To sleep was impossible, and in devotional acts they endeavoured to while the night away. Midnight came ; the Monk was slumbering over his breviary, and the matron occupied with her beads, when a violent trampling was heard outside, and the peasant, fearing the cattle he had in charge were disturbed, rose to ascertain the cause. In a moment he returned. A herd of wild deer surrounded the cabin, and actuaUy stood in threatening attitude within a few paces of the door ! WhUe he told this strange occurrence to the Monk a clap of thunder shook the hovel to its centre \u2014 yeUs, and shrieks, and groans succeeded \u2014 noises so demoniac, as to almost drive the listeners to madness, hurtled through the air \u2014 and infernal lights flashed through the crevices of the door and window. TUl morning broke, these unearthly terrors continued, with out a moment's intermission. tion, the priest ordered the door to be unclosed, and by the lightning's glare, a herd of red deer was seen tearing up the Pedler's grave ! To look longer in that blue infernal glare was impossible \u2014 the door was shut, and the re mainder of the night passed in penitential prayer. With the first Ught of morning, the Monk and villagers repaired to the Pedler's grave, and the scene it presented showed that the horrors of the preceding night were no iUusion. The earth around was blasted with lightning, and the coffin torn from the tomb, and shat tered in a thousand sphnters. \u2014 The corpse was blackening on the heath, and the expression of the distorted features was more like that of a demon than a man. Not very distant was the grave of his beautiful victim. The garland which the viUage girls had placed there was fresh and unfaded ; and late as the season was, the blossom was still upon the bog-myrtle, and the heath-flower was as bright and fragrant as though it were the merry month of June. ' ' These are indeed the works of hell and heaven,\" ejaculated the gray friar. \"Let no hand from this time forth pollute itself by touching yon accursed corpse.\" Nightly the same horrible noises continued. Shriek and groan came from the spot where the unburied murderer was rotting, whUe by day the hUl-fox and the eagle contended who should possess the body. Ere a week passed, the viUain's bones were blanching in the winds of heaven, for no human hand attempted to cover them again. Next day the villagers collected. They listened to the fearful story with dismay, whUe the melancholy fate of the gentle pUgrim was bitterly lamented. To inter the Pedler's corpse was the first care ; for the Monk swore by his patron saint, that he would not pass another night with it overground to be made a \" mitred abbot.\" A coffin was forthwith prepared, and, with \" maimed rites,\" the murderer was com mitted to the earth. From that time the place was deserted. The desperate noises, and the frequent ap pearance of the Pedler's tortured spirit, obUged the herdsman to abandon his dwelling, and reside in an adjacent village. The night of the day upon which he had removed his famdy and effects, a flash of lightning feU upon the cabin, and consumed the roof; and next morning nothing remained but black and rifted waUs. Since that time the weU is only used for penance. The peasant approaches not the desecrated burying-place if he can avoid it. The cattle are never known to shelter underneath the ruined walls \u2014 and the curse of God and man have faUen on Knock-a thample. That masses were requisite to purify the scene of slaughter was indisputable \u2014 and with the peasants who had flocked from the neigh bouring viUages, the Monk determined to pass that night in prayer. The blood-stains were removed from the floor \u2014 the corpse had been laid in consecrated earth \u2014 and the office had commenced at midnight, when suddenly, a rushing noise was heard, as if a mountain-tor rent was swollen by the bursting of a thunder cloud. It passed the herdsman's cabin, while blue fights gleamed through the casement, and thunder pealed above. In a state of despera-"], [91, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 87 CHAPTER XXVni.

While we traverse the moors, the commander will infest the river ; or, if the day be questionable, like honest Sancho, he wiU patiently remain beside the flesh-pots. To him the \" meminisse juvabit \" will apply. Thirty years ago, with his lamented contemporary, our host's father, the soldier, who was then a keen and accomplished sports man, spent many a happy hour upon the heath. To his memory every deU and hillock is still green ; and hence our evening detaUs will recaU to him those happier recoUections of youthful pastime, which, when \" Use was new,\" he had once delighted to indulge in. in these jeremiads without good reason. I never observe the Colonel's huge book forgot ten for a few minutes, but it is unmercifully plundered by the host \u2014 and if the key of the latter's fly-drawer can be procured, the com mander unlocks it without ceremony, and having explored its arcana adopts liberally such articles as find favour in his sight. The housemaid has been suborned to abstract the Colonel's casting-lines from his dormitory; and, as the host generaUy hides a favourite fly or two in the lining of his hat, I never pass the hall without finding the commander fum bling about the hat-stand. It was clearly stipulated and understood that the flies with which to-morrow's match should be decided, were to be bona fide the handy-work of the respective parties ; yet the Colonel privately informs me that he has despatched a trusty envoy to the priest, to implore that gifted churchman to furnish him, sub sigillo, with a cast or two for the occasion ; and the said envoy has covenanted to be at the comman der's window with an answer, \"before a mother's soul is stirring.\" The Colonel fishes weU ! and I, at least my vanity believes it, have improved marvellously \u2014 I really can throw a Une, and this the priest avers upon the word of a churchman. I begin also to have what the Scotch caU a gloamin' of what forms the composition of a killing fly. But my pride has sadly abated. Last night, during a stormy controversy, touching the com- parative merits of PuU-garrow and PuU-buoy, upon which the host and commander held opinions opposite as the antipodes, to prove that I belonged to a \" thinking people,\" I raised my voice in favour of the yellow pool. Our host in dudgeon having premised that one of us was blind, and the other a botch, declared by the shade of Walton, that on any given day he would kiU more than we both could produce together. This, as every Irish argument ends in a duel or bet, has terminated, fortunately, in the latter : and though the wager be not so deep as Hamlet's \" Barbary horses \" to \" French rapiers, poniards, and their as- signs,\" yet the respective parties appear deeply interested in the result. To-morrow wUl decide the question, and settle the doubtful point of scientific superiority between the rival artists. It strikes me forcibly, that among Irish anglers the doctrine of meum et tuum is but indifferently understood. My kinsman and the commander are constantly lamenting a loss of property, and certainly they do not indulge The thunder-storm produced a considerable fresh in the river, as the rain feU abundantly in the hills. The stream, however, had suffi cient time to clear after the flood, and we found it in beautiful order. The wind is steady at north-west ; and as the drafting has long since been discontinued, and the wears lowered to permit the fish to enter from the sea without obstruction, old Antony declares that, as a fishing-day, nothing could be more favourable. We tossed for choice, and lost it. My kins man commences his work three miles up, at his favourite PuU-garrow, while we fish from the mouth of the river. At five we meet at the cabin, and the party then producing the greater weight of fish is conqueror. These preliminaries being adjusted, our opponent went off like an Arab, to join his aide-de camp, Mr. Hennessey, who has all in readiness for his commencement, and, I suspect, a salmon or two already in the pannier. The opening of our campaign is every thing but satisfactory \u2014 Mogh-a-dioul seems pos sessed with the demon of obstinacy ; any ad vance towards the river is his aversion, and, as"], [92, "88 WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. Pattigo expresses it, \" the beast wUl neither wear or stay.\" The commander's seat has been more than once perilled by his gamba does ; and, as we are informed that he is caparisoned with a bit, which is his abomina tion, there is but little chance of amendment in Mogh-a-dioul. This appears very like a plot against the Colonel's person ; and I fear that the midnight embassy to the priest will be more than countervailed, by the man\u0153uvres of our abler antagonist. sprinkled with green hillocks, and the range of mountains behind was splendidly pictur esque. The pools alone had beauty in my companion's eyes, and some of them were indeed magnificent. One was particularly romantic \u2014 it was a deep natural basin, formed by a sudden turning of the river, where the banks on either side were nearly perpendicular, and rose to a considerable height, and, to the water's edge, were thickly covered with hoUies and hardy shrubs. At the upper end of the pool, a rock of immense magnitude reared its naked front, and shut out every other object. Round its base, the river forced its waters through a narrow channel, and at the other extremity, falling over a ledge of rocks, turned sharply round a hillock, and was lost sight of. There were but two points from which the angler could command the pool, for elsewhere the banks and underwood prevented his ap proach: one was a sand-bank about the centre, to which, by a narrow goat-path, the fisher could descend ; the other, a small space im mediately beneath the rock, of green and velvet-looking herbage. At this point the shepherds had erected a hut for occasional shelter, and never was a sweeter spot selected wherein to dream away a summer night. No human dweUing was in sight \u2014 deep and undis turbed solitude breathed around \u2014 the blue and lucid pool before the cabin danced in the moonlight, or glittered in the first rays of morning \u2014 while the rushing waters of the river produced such melancholy and tranquilUzing sounds, as would lull to rest any bosom untutored by mortal passions. Both adepts made exceUent professions of good faith at starting ; but, as my kinsman left us, there was a \" lurking devil in his eye,\" that augurs us no good fortune. The com mander, too, talked in good set terms of \"ho nourable conduct ; \" but precept and practice, I lament to say, are somewhat irreconcUable. \" Andy,\" he said, in his most insinuating manner, to our attendant ; \" Andy Bawn, you were always an obliging boy, and very handy with the gaff. Just keep your eye about the banks as we go along ; and if you can snaffle a salmon or two, why, the pannier will tell no tales, and weigh aU the better.\" To me there never was a more delightful expedition ; but my companion was cold to aU the romance of nature, and engrossed with one consideration \u2014 to win his wager. WhUe I was enraptured with the splendid scenery that each new point presented, the Colonel was cursing his flies, and pouring anathemas on the priest. \" How beautiful ! \" I exclaimed, as the sun shine fell upon a mountain valley, through which a Uttle rivulet was winding, and whose waters, in the glare of light, danced downwards like a streak of molten silver. ' ' How damned provoking,\" responded my brother fisherman, \" that the only decent fly in that cursed priest's collection, should be tied upon a hook with no more point upon it than a hobnail ! Ah, Father Andrew ! was this treatment for an old acquaintance \u2014 a man who would have trusted his life to you, and drink with you in the dark ? Here, Andy Bawn, give me my book, and fling this most villanous assemblage of faded wool and ragged feathers into the next bog-hole. And now, my friend and fellow-labourer, leave the mountains alone, and think more of filhng the fishing-baskets, or we are beaten men! \" \"Julius has been here before us, and has left some mementos of his visit,\" said the Colonel, pointing to foot-marks in the sand, and blood and fish-scales upon the pebbles ; \"I fear our bet is in jeopardy ; verily, our worthy relative wUl never shame the proverb, that ' De'il's bairns have de'il's luck ! ' But what can the matter be among the salmon ? in faith, the pool appears bewitched.\" As he spoke, I remarked the occurrence which the commander noticed. The fish, which upon our first arrival had risen merrily at the natural flies, ceased on a sudden altogether \u2014 \u25a0 now they rushed confusedly through the water, or threw themselves for yards along the surface. It was not the sullen plunge at an insect, or the vertical spring, when sport, not food, brings the salmon over water; but it was evident there was some hidden cause of alarm, and we were not long left in doubt. Near the neck of We followed the course of the river for a distance of ten mUes, stopping at the pools as we went along, but leaving the streams and shallows without a trial. As we proceeded up tlie hiUs, the scenery became wUder and more interesting; here and there the moors were"], [93, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 89 the pool, an otter of the largest size showed himself for a moment, then darting under water, the same commotion ensued again. Before a minute elapsed, Andy Bawn pointed sUently to a shoal beneath an overhanging bush, and there was the spoUer, apparently resting himself after his successful exertions, and holding a four-pound white trout in his mouth.1 Either he noticed us, or had some more favourite haunt to feed in, for he glided into deep water, and we saw no more of him. said my kinsman, \" the former I deny. By this virgin hand ! every fish before you was kiUed by hook and line. Come, are you for another bet ? For sive pounds, and within five minutes, I'll loll another salmon, and make the number ten .'\" \" Done ! \" we exclaimed together. \" Hennessey, the rod ; wet the flies below the pool, and in twenty seconds, yon cloud \u25a0will be over the sun.\" Before the cabin there is a tolerable hole, deep, but narrow. Where the stream runs in, the ripple is considerable, and between it and the bank the deepest water lies. If there be a salmon in the pool, there is the spot to find him. My cousin sent the casting line in such masterly style into the opposite eddy, as pro claimed him at once an adept, and the second cast a salmon rose and took him. Although we found out that the otter and ourselves could not manage to fish in company, we ascertained that the pool was abundantly stocked with salmon ; during the period of the greatest alarm, at least a dozen fish were break ing the surface at the same time. We reached the cabin after a day of excellent sport; but everything on earth has its alloy, and two circumstances appear to cloud the sunshine of the commander's bosom. One is the inexplicable conduct of the priest; the other the repeated misconduct of Mogh-a-dioul. We have, to be sure, four fine salmon, and a score of good-sized sea-trouts ; but the Colonel swears, that he lost his best fishing until he discarded the priest's flies ; and it is probable, if their defects had been apparent at an earlier period, our baskets would have been consider ably benefited by the discovery. He was but a .light fish, and in less than three minutes was bounding upon the grass, beside his dead companions. My kinsman handed the rod to the attendant. \u2014 \" Gentie men,\" he said in mock heroics, \" in your memories be all my bets remembered ! And now to dinner, with what appetite you may.\" \"Well,\" said the commander, \"this beats Bannagher.* I would have given my corporal oath the knave had swept the river. His flies are absolute perfection ! There's villainy some where ; but come along. The dinner must not cool, and the wine shaU pay for it !\" As we ascended the bank before the cabin door, our rival met us. He had left off fishing for some time, and had changed his dress entirely. \u2014 \" Come, brush up, or dinner will be spoiled. Colonel, I trust that you and Mogh-a dioul are on pleasing terms with each other. You stole my bridle, but, no apologies \u2014 I can ride Crughadore with a hayband. Come, \u2014 to scale at once, or dinner is not worth a grey groat. Hennessey, the steel-yard \u2014 produce \u2014 despatch \u2014 one, two, three, four. You kiUed one apiece, I presume, and Andy gaffed the other two ; nay, commander of the faithful, look not so ferocious. What, no more ! and is this paltry creel of fish the produce of the day ? Colonel, I blush for you. Barely forty pounds. Turn that clave * over, and put these gentlemen of the angle out of pain.\" As he spoke, the attendant emptied the contents ofthe pannier, and nine well-sized salmon, with a mul titude of sea-trouts, roUed out upon the sward. \"Julius,\" said the commander, as he ex tracted the third cork, \" thy star predominated ; a vUlanous combination of circumstances, with infernal flies, and an intractable pony, destroyed me. Andy Bawn (we are beaten, and the truth may be told) for the first time in his Use was taken with a fit of conscience, and actually refused to gaff a salmon. The very otters were combined against us, and disturbed the best pool upon the river but Pull-buoy. I had no time to tie fresh flies.\" \" Or even send to Goolamere to borrow,\" said my kinsman, drily. \" Ah, hem,\" and the colonel appeared a little bothered \u2014 \"I want no man's flies; my own, I find, will generally answer.\" \"And yet,\" said the host, \" the priest, when he pleases, can tie a killing one.\" \" By my faith ! \" exclaimed the commander, \" these fish were never fairly killed ; you drafted a hole or two, as surely as I am a sinner.\" \"Why \u2014 ye \u2014 es, he does \u2014 a leetle coarse \u2014 but let me see your casting-lines ; I fear, my friend, that we had not the right colours up.\" \"The latter part of your remark I admit,\" ** An Irish phrase synonymous with \" this exceeds everything.\" \u00bb A horsebasket."], [94, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 90 fished with some old acquaintances, while I tried experiments with Father Andrew's.

Breaking a letter open, I think is an exceUent preparative for stopping his Majesty's mail.\" \"And by my conscience,\" returned the host, \" you would not have been very far astray.\" \" And in that case, I trust that you wUl be an accomplice. If one must swing, good society is every thing. Your demeanour at ' the fatal tree,' I am persuaded, would be exemplary. And yet, my dear Frank, although I treated Father Andrew's despatch with scanty cere mony, I never came within the clutches of the law but once, and that was, as old Jack says, through villanous company.\" \" And was this fan, Julius \u2014 to fish with any but your own?\" \"Why, really, they looked so beautiful, that for the life of me, I could not but put them up.

The subaltern was a squab-built snub-nosed strange sort of merry fellow, having a rich brogue and racy wit ; and while the corpulent commander believed that he was humbugging the short lieutenant, the short lieutenant, all the whUe, was playing the devil with the corpulent commander. No two persons were ever better constructed to eUcit reciprocal amusement ; and they were, though opposites in everything, as necessary to each other, as \" sheath to sword.\" It was the spring before my father's death. A vacation was at hand, and for some coUege irregularities, I had been deprived of my chambers as a punishment, and turned upon the town to shift as best I could. I fixed myself at the Wexford Hotel for the short time I intended remaining in the capital, and there formed my first acquaintance with Colonel B\u2014 \u2014 and Lieutenant K , both of the Militia. They arrived at \"The Wexford\" late one evening from Naas, where the regiment was then quartered, and were on their route to visit, on private business, \"the realms beyond the Shannon.\" But there was a circumstance that united the strangers and myself directly. My friend, Lord L , had just got a majority in the colonel's regiment ; and the said colonel and his companion were going that very night to a baU at the dowager's, who then lived in Rutland-square. I was alone in the parlour when the strangers arrived. They cast a wistful glance at a choice haddock, then in the very act of being served up as exordium to the dinner. The waiter in a whisper assured the belated traveUers that he was convinced the young gentleman, meaning me, would share his fish and table-cloth. The request was very politely made, very politely granted, and down we sat, as if we had been bosom friends for a twelve month. We finished a formidable portion of Page's best* \u2014 retired to dress, and afterwards set off in a hackney-coach to the scene of our evening's amusement. I was three deep in dancing engagements, and my first partner was \" A bye-name given to one of the endless tribe * A celebrated wine-merchant, some thirty of Malley. years ago."], [95, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 91 already in the room \u2014 of course I separated from my companions directly, of whom, however, I caught a distant glance as they were formaUy presented to his aunt, by Lord L . perpetrated by Mrs. P , and passed over by my Lady L , mutuaUy decided, that in common justice, both ladies should have been consigned for a month to the house of cor rection. It was a crowded baU. I was dancing busily, and how my companions employed themselves, never occasioned me a thought. At last supper was whispered to be on the tapis. Miss Carden and I \u2014 she was then a very pretty girl \u2014 had quietly slipped away from the set, to be in readiness for the crush, when we stumbled upon a snug whist-table in an unfrequented corner, and there I discovered my gaUant friends actively engaged. Supper, as aU suppers have done, ended. I placed my handsome partner in her mother's carriage, and was then depositing myself in a hackney-coach, when I espied my military friends upon the steps, haded them immediately, and, embarking in the same vehicle, we were duly landed at \" the Wexford.\" \"Waiter !\" cried the colonel, in a voice of thunder,' \" some brandy and red hot water. I wore my thin tights for the first time these six months,\" addressing me, \"and, by St. Patrick ! my limbs are icicles. I drank two glasses of execrable Teneriffe ! and, God knows one would be a sufficient dose of poison for a gouty man like me. Arrah ! waiter, have you it in the house ? If you have not, say so, and I'U run out and save my Use at the next tavern.\" But the waiter was prompt, and the house honest. Up came the brandy and materials ; and the colonel, relieved from the anticipated attack in his stomach, \" breathed again.\" The unhappy men were partners. They had, moreover, been delivered into the hands of the dowager and Mrs. P , an antiquated commoner. Both ladies were notorious for extraordinary luck, and a fortunate arrangement of always cutting together. It was further believed, that both were given to the good old rule of winning, honestly if they could \u2014 but winning. It was evident at first sight that the soldiers were no matches for the gentlewomen. The rubber game was on the point of being decided just as we reached the table \u2014 the soldiers had it by honours, but, by a barefaced revoke, that would have been detected by any but the buzzards they were playing with, the ladies gained the point required, and had their claim aUowed. \" Supper is served,\" said Mrs. P , with a satisfactory grin; \"had we not better stop, Lady L ?\" The gentlemen simultaneously popped their hands into the pockets of their nether garments. \"In how much have I the honour to be your ladyship's debtor ?\" inquired the colonel, with a gracious smile. Mrs. P \u2014 \u2014 instantly mumbled, with the rapidity of a barmaid, \" Ten points \u2014 three rubbers \u2014 only nine guineas.\" The colonel started and stared. \" Nine devils ! \u2014 -I mean, guineas .'\" exclaimed the Sub, in awful con sternation. But the decree had gone forth. \" They never played higher \u2014 deep play was detestable.\" The money was accordingly doled out, and I observed that the contents of the lieutenant's purse, after rendering this sweep ing subsidy, were reduced to a solitary guinea. I looked at my unfortunate friends, and never did men bear their misfortunes so differently. WhUe the subaltern was in a phrensy, the commander was calm as a philosopher. \" Well, if the devil had his own,\" exclaimed the irritated lieutenant, \" my lady L would fry.\" '\"Rowland,\" said the colonel, solemnly, \" what the deuce tempted you to play ? You don't understand the game, and I often told you so.\" \"But,\" said I, interrupting him, \"the rubber was yours. Mrs. P. made a scanda lous revoke. How could it escape your observa tion ? The young lady, who was leaning on my arm, was horrified at such barefaced cheating.\" \"I remarked it,\" said the lieutenant ; \" but I was ashamed to speak. I thought we were playing half-crown points ! \" '\u2022 I wish I had seen it,\" said the colonel. \" Ah, Rowly, you're no wizard ! \" \" Well, no matter; I have suffered enough,\" said the subaltern, testily. \" If I have a rap left, after these swindling jades, but one solitary guinea to carry me to Connemara !\" At this moment the supper-rooms were thrown open, and away went the crowd. The Dowagers were left to scramble up their winnings, and the soldiers, I presume, to execrate their own bad luck. Miss Carden and I, who witnessed the impudent revoke \" Pshaw ! beg, man, beg ! You have a face for anything. I wonder how /stand upon the night's play.\""], [96, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 92 hour we regularly met in Dawson-street. Our host gave us the best dinner in Morrison's carle, and we had champagne, liqueurs, and a superabundant supply of the primest claret in the cellar. \"Nine guineas minus,\" said the subaltern, \" unless you managed to fob off a light piece, or pass a counterfeit.\" \" That would be impossible,\" remarked the colonel; \"for though the crush was desperate, and I thought, and I wished, that the table would be overturned, the dowager thumbed every guinea over as if she had played with a pickpocket. It was just then that I managed to secure a keep-sake;\" and he produced a huge snuff-box of fine gold and antique workmanship from his side-pocket. I stared with wonder, whUe the subaltern ejaculated, \" What a chance ! Ah, colonel, you are the jewel ! The box wiU pay our losses beautifuUy.\" Pending dinner, the parties made an ami cable arrangement touching the disposition of the booty. The field-officer was to share the surplus produce over the payment of the tavern bill, and the subaltern was to be the vender of the spoil. It iwas nearly eight o'clock when we left Morrisons's, and directed our course to the civil gentleman who lent money on good secu rity. We entered an outer hall, and thence advanced into one encompassed by a tier of compartments like confession boxes. Rowly stepped into a vacant stall, and we stood close behind, to \"aid, comfort, and counsel.\" \" I beg to be excused from co-partnership,\" said Ihe colonel, drily. \" Rowly, you might have stolen for yourself. I saw a pair of gold mounted spectacles upon the table, and a vinaigrette ot silver device lay beside you. No, no, Rowly ! rob for yourself.\" The money-dealer left an unfinished bargain with a tradesman's wife, to attend upon his better dressed customer. \"Ah! hem- \u2014 hem!\" said the subaltern, rather bothered to open the negotiaton \u2014 but the Lombard gave an encour aging simper \u2014 \" A small advance wanted, I presume ? \" \" Why, no \u2014 ah, hem ! \u2014 wish to dispose of a trifle \u2014 a present \u2014 no use for it \u2014 but would not for the world it was known.\" The pawnbroker instantly presented his finger and thumb, to receive watch, ring, or jewel, according as the case might be. \"And,\" said I, \"my dear colonel, might I ask what may be the ultimate design which you harbour against the dowager's snuff-box ! \" \"Why, faith, my young friend, my plans are simple enough. I'll give you and that ommadawn,\"* pointing to his Ueutenant, \" an early dinner, and bring you to the play afterwards. Well, it will.be tolerably dark by. that time. We'll pass St. Andrew's church, call next door, and get a worthy man who lives convenient, and who is very liberal in lending money to any body who leaves sufficient security behind him, \u2014 -we'll get him, in short, to take the box at his own valuation.\" The snuff-box was rapidly displayed, and the happy eye of the money-dealer turned rapidly from the box to the presenter : \" Well, sir, pray what be the value ? \" \" And if it should be discovered ? \" \"Oh, htde fear of that. No, my friend; before you and I are in the boxes, this box will be in the melting-pot. The man is a conside rate and conscientious dealer. No, no, aU's safe with him.\" \"ReaUy, can't say \u2014 a present \u2014 and \" \" Oh i ye-e-e-s \u2014 old gold \u2014 mere drug now adays \u2014 about three pound ten an ounce \u2014 once valuable \u2014 bullion then scarce \u2014 a year ago it would have been a very pretty swag.\" We parted for the night. At noon next day we met at breakfast. I, although pretty conversant in odd adventures and mad freaks, was dying to see the conclusion of the snuff box affair. We, of Trinity, often touched upon street-robbery in poles and rattles, and, as far as public property went, were nowise scrupulous. I had once achieved a petty larceny, by run ning off with a pine-apple from a fruiterer's, for which, however, I had the grace to send payment in the morning. StiU, the colonel's coup was so superior to aU this, that I was so much interested in the denouement, as if I had been a principal concerned. At the appointed \"Swag ! What do you mean ? \" cried the alarmed seller. \" Zounds ! do you think I stole it ? \" \" Oh, dear no-o ! \u2014 beg pardon \u2014 meant pre sent. Here, the scales, John.

Beyond the customary interchange of civilities, I did not interrupt them, receiving, however, from the commander a warm squeeze, and an inexpressibly comic look that recaUed a volume of adventure. The old lady resumed the conversation which my entree had suspended. \" Damn Heavyside ! \" exclaimed the peer. \"I must go see about some wine.\" And he left the room. The old lady recommenced with a groan \u2014 \"What a memory Mrs. P had! she would remember cards through a rubber, and never omitted marking in her hfe.

The otter-killer arrived here last evening, after having, according to his own account, worked wonders upon a damaged head. From the specimens I have seen during my short sojourn at Ballycroy, I have come to a conclusion, that the skuUs of the natives are fabricated of dif ferent materials to those of aU the world besides. Their endurance is miraculous \u2014 a fellow who was reported as \"beaten to a jeUy, and anointed by the priest,\" last week, actuaUy cleared a fair with an unpronounceable name, yesterday, after quahfying for admission to the next infirmary some half-score of his Majesty's liege subjects. This is an every-day exploit ; and of all the corners of the earth that I have visited, I would name this as the place wherein to establish a resident craniologist. house cannot be burned, or the ship cast away, and steel or bullet wUl not harm the man who possesses an inch of this precious material. Antony, indeed, confesses, that in the course of his otter-hunting, he has never been for tunate enough to meet this invaluable brute ; but he teUs a confused story of one having been killed \" far down in the north,\" by three brothers caUed Montgomery, who, from poverty, became immensely rich, and whose descendants are opulent to this very day. He says, the master-otter was seen twice in this neighbour hood. At Dhu-hiU, he appeared about sixty years ago, attended by about one hundred common-sized animals, who waited upon \" the master,\" like loyal and dutiful beasts. He was also observed by one of the O'Donnel famUy, whUst passing through Clew Bay in a saUing-boat. Requiring a supply of fresh water, O'Donnel landed on an island for the purpose of filling his keg, but found the spring already occupied by a strange and nondescript animal. After his first surprise had subsided, he returned to the boat, and procured a gun. This he loaded carefully with five fingers and a half* \u2014 for Antony is minute in aU his nar ratives \u2014 and then, and within a dozen yards, levelled at the master. Thrice he drew the trigger, and thrice the gun missed fire. The otter wisely determined not to give him a fourth chance, and left the well for the ocean. Mor tified at his failure, O'Donnel tried his gun at a passing gull ; it exploded without trouble, Like all wild people, these aborigines are absurdly credulous, and open to the grossest superstitions. Charms, as they believe, are employed with decided success, in every disease you name. The existence of ghosts and fairies is universally acknowledged ; and animals of extraordinary formation, and strange virtues, are supposed to inhabit lakes and rivers. Among these the sea-horse and master-otter* are pre-eminent. By a singular anomaly, the first is said to be found in certain inland loughs, and his appearance is imagined to be fatal to the unfortunate person who encounters him. The latter, however, should be an object of anxious research, for he is endued with amazing virtues. Where a portion of his skin is, the * There is a strange coincidence between the master-otter of the Irish and the Jungunus crocodile, of the Japanese. * The lower class of Irish describe the charge of a gun, not by quantity of powder and shot, but by long measure."], [99, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 95 and finished the unfortunate bird \u2014 thusproving, beyond a doubt, that the gun was faultless, and the preservative qualities of the animal were alone to blame. \u2014 \" And, indeed,\" quoth An tony, \" he might have snapped at the master to eternity ; for if an inch of skin can save house, 6hip, and man, what a deal of virtue there must be in a whole hide ! \" calamity, Antony acknowledges there is no cure; but for the second, there & \"balm in GUead,\" and certain holy loughs afford an antidote to this elfin visitation. The cow, I believe, should be present at the operation, which is performed by committing her tether and some butter to the waves, with (of course) a due proportion of prayers for her recovery. Whether the animal be benefited or not, there be others who reap sure and soUd advantages. At the proper period, some saint's day, no doubt, when Lough Keirawn is fre quented by the proprietors of bewitched cattle, many of the poor of the neighbourhood con gregate on the lee-side of the lake, and a lively and profitable fishing of fresh butter continues, untU the oblations to the saint or saintess of the lake, on the part of the afflicted cows, have ended. The legendary tales touching the appearance of ghosts, and the exploits of fairies, are end less. The agency ofthe former appears directed principaUy to men, while the latter exercise their powers upon children and cattle. Indeed, the sinister influence of the \" faery race \" ap pears to faU almost exclusively upon the brute creation in Ballycroy ; arid through it many an unhappy cow comes to an untimely end, and if she escapes loss of life, she suffers what is nearly as bad, loss of butter.* For the first Amongthe human diseases ascribed to super natural causes, the faragurta is the principal. Conjectures touching its origin are numerous and contradictory, and it is attributed to every thing but the true cause. The faragurta comes on suddenly \u2014 a general weakness pre cedes the attack \u2014 the sufferer's strength is prostrated in an instant \u2014 he sinks down, and, if assistance be not at hand, perishes. Many persons are lost through this disease, while crossing the extensive wUds around us where human reUef is generally unattainable. * While staying at a gentleman's house, I heard, when passing the porter's lodge, that the gate-keeper's cow was ill. As she was a fine animal, the loss would have been a serious one to the family, and hence I became interested in her recovery. For several days, however, the report to my inquiry was more unfavourable, and at last the case was considered hopeless. The following morning, as I rode past, I found the family in deep distress. The cow, they said, could not live many hours ; and the gate-keeper had gone off to fetch the \" charmer,\" who lived some ten miles distance. I really sympathised with the good woman. The loss of eight or nine guineas to one in humble life is a serious calamity ; and from the appearance of the cow I concluded, though not particularly skilful, that the animal would not survive. The causes, to whicb. in popular belief it is ascribed, are many. Some assert that it is brought on by treading upon a poisonous plant ; others, that it is occasioned by fairy influence ; whUe more affirm, that it is pro duced by passing over the place where a corpse has been laid down. But this mystified dis order is, after aU, nothing but exhaustion con sequent upon hunger and fatigue. The lower classes are particularly obnoxious- to its attack. They eat but seldom, and at irregular seasons ; and commonly labour for many hours before they break their fast. Want of food produces faintness and exhaustion ; and a supernatural cause is sought for a simple malady, which is That evening I strolled out after dinner. It was sweet moonlight, and I bent my steps to the gate-house to inquire if the cow still lived. The family was in great tribulation. \" The charmer had arrived \u2014 had seen the cow \u2014 had prepared herbs and nostrums, and was perform ing some solitary ceremony at an adjacent spring-well, from which he had excluded every member of the family in assisting.\" I was most curious to observe the incantation, but was dis suaded by the gate-keeper, who implored me \" to give the conjuror fair play.\" In five minutes the charmer joined us \u2014 he said the case was a bad one, but that he thought he could bring round the cow. He then adminis tered the \" unhallowed potion,\" and I left the lodge, expecting to hear next morning that the animal was defunct. have told them truth,\" said the charmer coldly. \u2014 \" And will your prophecy prove true?\" I asked, in a tone of scornful incredulity. \u2014 \" It will,\" said he ; \" but, God help me ! this night I'll pay dearly for it !\" I looked at him \u2014 his face was agonized and terror-stricken ; he crossed the fence and disappeared, When I passed the gate-house on my return, the cow was evidently convalescent ; and in a few days she was perfectly well. I leave the solution of the mystery to the learned ; for in such matters, as they say in Con naught \u2014 Neil an skeil a gau maun. Next day, \" the bulletin was favourable ; \" and \" the charmer \" was in the act of receiving his reward \u2014 I looked at him : he was as squalid and heart-broken a wretch in appearance as ever trod the earth. The cow still seemed weak, but \"the charmer\" spoke confidently of her recovery. When he left the lodge and turned his steps homewards, I pulled up my horse and waited for him. He would rather have avoided an interview, but could not. \" Well, fellow, you have humbugged that poor family, and per suaded them that the cow will recover?\" \u2014 \"I"], [100, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 96 who has just laid down the book, offer to fortify his doubtful evidence, by taking number two. But even the -vestment is not always conclusive ; and the foUowing anecdote will best describe the value of comparative swearing : only the natural consequence of dyspepsia and an empty stomach. One would imagine that the specific for fara gurta would at once point out its origin. Bread, or even a few grains of corn, are beUeved to cure it instantly ; but any kind of food is equaUy efficacious. \"I have seen,\" said my kinsman, ' ' many persons attacked with fara gurta, and have myself been patient and phy sician. Some years ago, a fine active boy, called Emineein,* commonly attended me to the moors, and one day he was suddenly taken ill, in the very wUdest part ofthe hills. He lost ali power of limb, and lay down upon the heath unable to proceed a step. We had no grain of any kind to administer, and in this emergency tried that universal panacea- \u2014 a glass of whisky. After he had swallowed the cordial, the boy rather got worse than better, and we were obliged to carry him to a stUl house, at nearly two miles, distance. On our arrival, fortunately for Emineein, we found the operators coUected round a skibbf of potatoes. After eating one or two, the patient was able to join the party, and next morning proceeded stoutly home. Andy Bawn has felt the arrow of \"the viUain,\" and believed, \" fond wretch !\" that he was beloved again. The night of the portmanteau affair wiU ever be chronicled upon his memory ; for whUe he was under fear and terror at the bridge of BaUyveeney, she, the lady of his love, was at a prinkum* at Latrah, performing \"apples for gentlemen, \"f with another suitor. Nay, more, the quondam lover, as was reported, had actuaUy cecisbeo'd Miss Biddy Currigan across the bogs ; and dark and dangerous inuendoes arose from this imprudent escort. Andy Bawn was unhappUy a man \" who doubts, but dotes ; suspects, yet fondly loves.\" Alas ! what was to be done ? Could Miss Currigan become Mrs. Donahoo, after suffering a regular blast, as they caU it, in the kingdom of Connaught ? Impossible ! her character must be cleared, and Andy satisfied. \" In my own case, the predisposing cause was no enigma. I had been one of a knot of foxhunters who, on the preceding night, had indulged in a desperate joUification. Finding a disinclination for breakfast, I repaired, contrary to my general habit, without it to the mountains. I had exercised severely for several hours, when at once I became helpless as an infant, and sank upon a bank incapable of motion. My pony and some food were speedily obtained, and the faragurta banished. But assuredly, if unassisted, I must have lain upon the heath, for I could not make the slightest exertion to get forward.\" The magistrate was proposed \u2014 well, that was good enough, if it were the identity of a strayed sheep, or the murder of a man ; but in a nice case, like Miss Currigan's, it was totaUy inefficient. \" The vestment would be taken,\" \u2014 still better ; but the world was censorious : and, after aU, Biddy Currigan was a giddy girl to cross a couple of miles of moorland, after midnight,, with a declared lover, and him hearty ;% and so thought Andy Bawn. At last the suspected virgin volunteered to \" take the skull,\" dispel the fears of her liege lord, and put calumny to the blush for ever. Andy Bawn \"breathed again;\" and the otter-killer was directed to provide the necessary articles for the ceremony. It is a lamentable fact, that the obligation of legal oath is here of trifling importance. Cases of determined perjury occur every day ; and an adjuration upon the evangelists is considered as being far inferior in solemnity to one upon the priest' 's vestment. Whether there be any regular formula to be observed in this comparative swearing, I know not ; I say comparative, for in Ballycroy, oaths, like adjectives, have three degrees of value. First that upon the evangelists; the second, upon the vestment ; and the last upon the skull.

That the saints are often and scandalously overreached by sinners, is a fact which must be admitted and lamented. One case of base dishonesty has but recently occurred in the establishment of my cousin. A cook, whom he had procured through the agency of a friend, has proved a heavy defaulter, and, as Antony says, \"scandalized the family.\" For a con siderable time her conduct was unquestion able : she went regularly to mass, gave half-a crown at Easter, never missed confessions, and, better still, conducted the culinary department with excellent propriety, \u2014 so much so, that Father Andrew declared from the altar, that she was an exemplary artiste, and a capital Christian. \" Frailty, thy name is woman ! \" This paragon of cooks levanted one frosty night with a traveUing pedler. Then, and not tUl then, was the dark side of her character exhibited. \"She did not value Lent a traneein \u2014 had shared a rasher with \" She could hide a quart of spirits, and it would never show upon her,\" cried Pattigo. \" She was mighty dangerous in a house,\" exclaimed the black-eyed chamber-maid ; \" I never settled the master's room, but she was sure to pass the window.\" \" She's gone,\" said the otter-killer ; \" there's worse in the north than Sibby.

Antony is greasing his otter-trap beside the fire. He still indulges the vain hope, that his rheuma tism may be cured, and that he wiU once more revisit the remoter loughs, where otters are abundant, and where many of his happier days were \" lang syne \" spent. Poor feUow ! his hunting is ended, and his trap, like a warrior's sword, must be laid aside, for age has come heavUy upon its master. Old John, \" the last and trustiest of the four,\" has assumed his culinary apron, and from the strength and array of his \"materiel\" it is clear that he calculates little upon the red-deer venison we shaU bring home. our respected friend, has given unexpected pleasure. For me, the visit is deUghtful, for I hope to obtain another lesson in the \"gentle art.\" The Colonel has embraced this \"Wal ton of the wUderness ; \" a man on whom four bottles would not show, and to whom, in woodcraft and theology, in the commander's opinion, the clerk of Copmanhurst himself was little better than a bungler ; and, notwithstand ing my kinsman's delinquency in intercepting the despatches, and abstracting the enclosure, he has escaped with a tap or two upon the cheek ; for, as Antony declares, \" Father Andrew dotes upon the Master.\" But a shepherd in breathless haste has rushed into the cabin. By expressive signs, and a few words, he has conveyed the intelligence to Mr. Hennessey, that three outlying deer are at this minute in a neighbouring glen. He saw them in a vaUey, as he crossed the brow above. Nothing short of the landing of a French army, or a smuggler, could occasion such confusion. The chamber of state is invaded, rifles are uncased, shot exchanged for buUets, a basket with refreshments packed : aU is hurry and preparation, and in an incalculably short time we are ready for the fray, and in full march for the mountains. Shakspeare, or he is belied, was in his youth a deer fancier, and he would probably describe this busy scene by \"loud alarum, exeunt omnes.\" A smart walk of some three mUes over an undulating surface, of gentle but regular ascent, brought us to the deep and circular lake which lies at the base of Carrig-a-binniogh ; it seems the boundary between the hiU-country and the moorlands. Here we halted, and held with the peasants a council of war, on the course of operations to be pursued. The situation of this mountain lough is ex tremely picturesque ; on three sides it is em bosomed in the hUls, which rise boldly from the water's edge, and for many hundred feet appear to be almost perpendicular. Its depth is considerable, and hence, bright as the day is, the waters have a dark and sombre look. It abounds with trout of moderate size and excellent flavour. They were rising fast at the natural fly, and appeared generaUy to be her ring-sized. The day is particularly favourable, the sun shines brilliantly, the sky is without a cloud, and if we even miss the deer, I trust that the prospect from the mountain-top will more than repay our labour in ascending it. The party comprises three -guns, and some ten or twelve drivers, with our guide. My kinsman and Hennessey have rifles ; I am no marksman with a bullet, and I declined to take one, and therefore must put my trust in honest John Manton. We bend our course directly to the mountain clcugh, where the deer were seen by thc peasant ; but when we reach the base of the hiUs, we must diverge to the left, and make a considerable ditour, and judging from the appearance of the heights to be surmounted, we have work cut out, which, before our return to the hut, wiU tell what metal we are made of. WhUe resting here, preparatory to attempt ing to ascend the heights, Cooney, the guide, related a very apposite adventure. Late in the autumn of the preceding year the peasant had visited the lake with his fishing rod. The trouts took weU, and Cooney had nearly fiUed his basket, when he was startled by the report of a gun, at no great distance up the lull. While he looked in the direction from whence the shot appeared to have been discharged, a sine full-grown stag crossed the brow above him, tottered downwards for some twenty steps, and then faUing into a steep and stony ravine, roUed lifelessly over, until he reached the very spot where the astonished fisherman was standing. Before his surprise had time to abate, a man, armed with a French gun,* leaped upon the bank over which the Nor is the garrison during our absence left without protectors. The colonel, the priest, the otter-kiUer, and old John, there keep watch and ward. Thc former twain appear to have sworn eternal friendship over a three-legged table, and are settled tete-a-tete at either side * When the French, under Humbert, landed at Killala in the autumn of 1798, they brought with them a large quantity of arms and military"], [103, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 99 deer had fallen, and was joined immediately by a companion, armed also with a fowling-piece. Then, for the first time, they observed the startled angler. The discovery was anything but agreeable ; for, after a momentary pause, they rushed down the hiU together, and pre senting their long guns at Cooney's breast, ordered him to decamp, in terms that admitted of no demur. The angler absconded forthwith ; for, as he reasoned fairly enough, \" a man who could drive an ounce of lead through a stag's skull, would find little trouble in drUling a Christian.\" On looking round, he saw the deer-stealers place the carcass on then shoul ders, and ascend the heights, over which they quicldy disappeared. The feat is almost in credible, and it required an amazing effort of strength and determination to transport a fuU grown red-deer over a precipitous mountain, which we, in light marching order, and with no burden but our guns, found a difficult task enough to climb. add, amazingly fatiguing, and a task for men of thews and sinews of no ordinary strength. But we were determined and persevered \u2014 \" en avant,\" was the order of the day ; on we pro gressed, slowly but continuously ; the steepest face of the hill was gradually overcome, and a wide waste of moss and shingle lay before us, rising towards a caim of stones which marks the apex of the mountain. We pressed on with additional energy ; the termination of our toU was in view : in a few minutes we gained the top, and a scene, glorious beyond imagi nation, burst upon us at once, and repaid ten fold the labour we had encountered to obtain it. We stood upon the very pinnacle of the ridge, two thousand feet above the level of the sea ; Clew Bay, that magnificent sheet of water, was extended at our feet, studded with its countless islands : inland, the eye ranged over a space of fifty mUes ; and towns and villages, beyond number, were sprinkled over a surface covered with grass, and corn, and heath, in beautiful alternation. The sun was shining gloriously, and the variety of colouring presented by this expansive landscape, was splendidly tinted by the vertical rays of light. The yeUow corn, the green pasturage, the russet heaths, were traceable to an infinite distance, whUe smaUer objects were marked upon this natural panorama, and churches, towns, and mansions occasionaUy reheved the prospect. We turned from the interior to the west; there the dark waters of the Atlantic extended, tiU the eye lost them in the horizon. Northward, lay the SUgo islands ; and southward, the Connemara mountains, with the noble islands of Turk and Boffin \u2014 nearer objects seemed almost beneath us ; Achil was below \u2014 Clare Island stretched at our feet \u2014 while our own cabin looked Uke a speck upon the canvas, distinguished only by its spiral wreath of smoke from the hUlocks that encircled it. There was an indescribable loneliness around, that gave powerful effect to all we saw. The dreariness of the waste we occupied was grand and imposing : we were far removed from every thing human ; we stood above the world, and could exclaim with Byron, \" this, this is solitude ! \" From its very base, Carrig-a-binniogh pre sents a different surface to the moorlands which environ it ; heath is no more seen, and in its place the mountain's rugged sides are clothed with lichen and wUd grasses. The face of the hill is broken and irregular, and the ascent rendered extremely disagreeable by multitudes of loose stones which, being Ughtly bedded in the soU, yield to the pressure of the traveller's foot, and of course increase his difficulties. After the first hundred yards had been gaUantly surmounted, we halted by general consent to recover breath. Again we resumed pur labour, and, with occasional pauses, plod ded on \" our weary way.\" As we ascended, the hill became more precipitous, the grass shorter, and the hands were as much employed as the feet. The halts were now more fre quent ; and each progression towards the sum mit shorter after every pause. \" To climb the trackless mountain aU unseen,\" is very poetical, no doubt, but it is also, I regret to clothing, to equip the numerous partisans they expected to have found in the country. After the French general was defeated, and the in surrection had been put down, many of the guns which had been distributed among the peasantry were buried, or effectually concealed ; and they have been used in poaching and wild fowl shooting to the present time. The French barrels are said to throw shot much better than those of English muskets. I have never seen their relative merits proven, but imagine that the superiority of the former is owing to their greater length. How long we might have gazed on this brilliant spectacle is questionable. Hennessey, less romantic than we, reminded us that it was time to occupy the defile, by which the deer, if found, and driven from the lowlands, would pass within our range. Thus recalled, we looked at the immediate vicinage of the caim. G 2"], [104, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 100 barren heaths below and the blasted wilder ness above. It was a wUdemess of moss and bog, and granite, barren beyond description, and con nected with the upper levels of the Alpine ridge, which extended for miles at either side, by a narrow chain of rock, which seemed more like the topping of a parapet than the apex of a line of hills. Indeed, a more desolate region could not be well imagined ; \u2014 no sign of vege tation appeared, if scathed lichens, and parched and withered flag-grass be excepted. The mountain cattle were rarely seen upon these heights, and the footmarks upon the softer surface were those of the deer and goats. Hen nessey discovered the tracks of a herd of the larger species, which, from his acute obser vations, had evidently crossed the ridge since sunrise, and must, from then numerous traces, have amounted to at least a dozen. We put our bats aside, and peeped over. The wave of Hennessey's hand proved the boy's report to be correct, and we were gratified with a sight of those rare and beautiful animals which formed the objects of our expedition. They were the same leash which the peasant had noticed in the lower vaUey \u2014 an old stag, a younger one, and a doe. The great elevation of the precipice, and the caution with which we approached the verge, permitted us, without alarming them, to view the red-deer leisurely. They appeared to have been as yet undisturbed, for, after cropping the herbage for a httle, the younger stag and the hind lay 'down, whUe the old hart remained erect, as if he intended to be their sentinel. \"WhUe we stUl cast a \" longing lingering look \" at a scene, which, I lament to say, I shaU most probably never be permitted to view again \u2014 a boy rose from the vaUey towards the south, and hastened at fuU speed to join us. His communication was soon made, and, like the shepherd's at the cabin, pantomime rather than speech conveyed its import. His tidings were momentous ; the deer had moved from the place in which they had been first dis covered, and were now within one thousand yards of the place where we were resting. Hennessey and the gossoon* advanced in double quick, and where the ridge is steepest between the highlands and the vaUey, we ob served them make a sudden halt, and creep gingerly forward, to what seemed the brow of a precipice. We foUowed more leisurely, and adopting a similar method of approach, stole silently on, and looked over the chasm. The distance of the deer from the ridge was too great to aUow the rifle to be used with anything Uke certainty ; and from the exposed nature of the hiUs at either side, it was impos sible to get within point-blank range undis covered. Hennessey had already formed his plans, and drawing cautiously back from thr ridge, he puUed us by the skirts, and beckoned us to retire. We feU back about a pistol-shot from the cliff, and under a rock, which bore the por tentous name of Craignamonia,* held our council of war. There were two passes, through one of which the deer, when roused and driven from the glen, would most likely retreat. The bet ter of these, as post of honour, was, more politely than prudently, entrusted to me \u2014 my kinsman occupied the other ; and Hennessey having ensconced, us behind rocks which pre vented our ambush from being discovered, crossed to the other side of the ridge, and I lost sight of him. MeanwhUe the boy had been despatched to apprize the drivers that the deer were in the ravine, and to notify the spot where we were posted, to enable them to arrange their movements according to our plans. The precipice we were on forms the ex tremity of a long but narrow ravine, which graduaUy rising from the lowlands, divides the basis of Carrig-a-binnoigh and Meelroe. It was a perpendicular rock of fearful height. At either side the valley was flanked by the sides of the opposite hUls ; and they sprang up so ragged and precipitous as to be quite imprac ticable to all but \" the wUd flock which never needs a fold ; \" and yet the cleugh below was like a green spot upon a wUdemess. To the very bases of the ridges it was covered with verdant grass and blooming heather, while, at the upper end, streams from several well-heads united together and formed a sparkling rivulet, which wandered between banks so green and shrubby, as formed a striking contrast to the I will not pretend to describe the anxious, nay agonizing hour that I passed in this high land ambuscade. The deep stillness of the waste was not broken by even the twittering of a bird. From the place where I lay concealed, I commanded a view of the defile for the dis tance of some eighty yards, and my eye turned to the path by which I expected the deer to approach, until to gaze longer pained me. My ear was equally engaged ; the smaUest noise * Anglice, boy. * Anglice, the rock of slaughter."], [105, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 101 was instantly detected, and the ticking of my watch appeared sharper and louder than usual. As time wore on, my nervousness increased. Suddenly a few pebbles feU \u2014 my heart beat faster \u2014 but it was a false alarm. Again, I heard a faint sound, as if a light foot pressed upon loose shingle \u2014 it was repeated. By Saint Hubert, it is the deer ! They have entered the gorge of the pass, and approach the rock that covers me, in a gentle canter ! leys beyond the gorge of the pass were seen distinctly. The deer had separated \u2014 the hart and doe turned suddenly to the right, and were fired at by my cousin, without effect. The stag went right ahead ; and while I still gazed after him, a flash issued from a hollow in the hUl, the sharp report of Hennessey's piece succeeded, and the stag sprang full six feet from the ground, and tumbling over and over repeatedly, dropped upon the bent-grass with a rifle-buUet in his heart. To sink upon one knee and cock both barrels was a moment's work. Reckless of danger, the noble animals, in single file, galloped down the narrow pathway. The hart led the way, foUowed by the doe, and the old stag brought up the rear. As they passed me at the short distance of twenty paces, I fired at the leader, and, as I thought, with deadly aim ; but the ball passed over his back, and splintered the rock beyond him. The report rang over the waste, and the deer's surprise was evinced by the tremendous rush they made to clear the defile before them. I selected the stag for my second essay ; eye and finger kept excellent time, as I imagined \u2014 I drew the trigger \u2014 a miss, by everything unfortunate ! The buUet merely struck a tyne from his antler, and, ex cepting this trifling graze, he went off at a thundering pace, uninjured. Cursing myself, John Manton, and aU the world, I threw my luckless gun upon the ground, and rushed to the summit of a neigh bouring rock, from which the heights and val- I rushed at headlong speed to the spot where the noble animal lay. The eye was open \u2014 the nostril expanded, just as life had left him. Throwing his rifle down, Hennessey puUed out a clasped-knife, passed the blade across the deer's throat, and requesting my assistance, raised the carcass by the haunches, in order to assist its bleeding freely. Having performed this necessary operation, and obtained the assistance of two of our com panions from the vaUey, whence they had been driving the deer, we proceeded to transport the dead stag to the lowlands. It was no easy task, but we accomplished it quickly ; and perceiv ing some horses grazing at no great distance, we determined to press one for the occasion. A stout pony was most unceremoniously put in requisition, the deer laid across his back, and after emptying flask and basket joyously beside a stream of rock-water, we turned our faces to the cabin, where the news of our suc cess had already arrived.

A cheerful fire blazed in the room of state, while exhilarating effluvia from the outer chamber told that John's preparations were far ad vanced.

It delights me to see my companion eat Uke a traveUer ; and to please me, he should possess sufficient acumen to enable him to appreciate the fare. I despise the man who is cursed with a Spartan palate, and who hardly knows the difference between beef and mutton ; and yet, in equal ratio, the gourmand is my abomina- tion. There is a hmit in culinary lore beyond which, as I opine, the sportsman should never travel. Like a soldier, he wiU sometimes find it serviceable to be able to direct the breding of a steak aud the combination of a stew. To fabricate a curry, or even regulate a hash, may be tolerated ; and in a wild country like BaUy- croy, or the Scottish highlands, this know- ledge wUl frequently be \" worth a Jew's eye ;\" but everything beyond this in kitchen accom- pUshments is detestable. With one who com- posed omelets, and talked scholarly of the materiel ot a plum-pudding \u2014 and I once had the misfortune to faU into a shooting party afflicted with such a personage\u2014 I would con- sort no more upon the heath, than I would shoot with a cook, or draw a cover with a confectioner. And yet, with these antipathies, I recommend the neophyte to make himself in everything as independent as he can. A few practical lessons are worth a world of pre cept : one week's cooking on the moors will render him for hfe an adept ; and if gun and angle faU him not, he will be able to command a dinner, without owing to the devil the com pliment of a bad cook. soup ! \u2014 and yet it was the simple extract of a mountain hare, and five broken birds, which had been too much injured to permit their being sent away. Shade of Kitchener ! one spoonful of that exquisite potage would have made thee abandon half thy theories, and throw thy \" cunningest devices\" to the winds .' The Priest superintended the fish \u2014 an eight pound-salmon, crimped, split, subdivided, and roasted upon bog-deal skewers before a clear turf fire. AU the sauces that Lazenby ever fabricated could not produce that soup, or emulate this broU. Let him, whose jaded palate a club-house cook cannot accommodate, try the cuisinerie of our cabin. He shaU walk to the mountain lake, and on Iris return, the Colonel will compose a soup, and the Priest supply a salmon : if eating hke a ploughman be to him a pleasure \u2014 \" If these won't make him, The devil take him ! \" But lest my theories be mistaken, I must say, that I hold cooking and \" creature comforts \" as very secondary indeed to sport. If all can be had, so much the better; and when I recommend the tyro to learn the art and mys- teries of the broiling iron, it is precisely on the principle that the knowledge how to cook a dinner may, at times, be as necessary for him, as to know how to wash a gun. No man, I presume, wiU do either, who can manage to have them done by a deputy. But a sportsman, a keen straightforward sportsman, wiU of necessity be often left dependent upon his own resources, and hence he should be pre- pared for the contingency. It is the abuse I cry out against. A man who on the moun- tains counts the minutes until dinner-hour shall come, who is seeking an appetite rather than amusement, and instead of game is dreaming of gourmanderie \u2014 him I totaUy reject, and implore to lay aside his gun for ever, and exchange the powder-flask for the pepper-box. The latter he wiU find more useful, and not half so dangerous. Did I wish to elucidate my opinions, I would stake them upon two items in our bills of fare. The soldier compounded the soup \u2014 and such over Connaught, and from the interminable ramifications of the old families, there were few houses into which these worthies had not a right of entree. The last one I recollect when a boy, traversed the country upon a white pony, dressed in dingy black, and arrayed in a cocked hat ; a certain number of houses were under annual requisition, and such was the influence of annual custom, that none would venture to refuse this forced hospitality, although the man was latterly a sad bore. Some gentlemen, when their \" loving cousin \" was expected, had his ap proach observed, and stopped him in the avenue with an excuse that the house was full, and a subsidy of a few guineas. The money was always acceptable \u2014 and whoever unluckily happened to be next number on the visiting list, was favoured witli one week additional from my \" Cousin Mac.\" \" Mac,\" with his brigadier wig and white pony, has gone the way of all flesh, and by travestying a line of Sir Walter Scott, one could add, \" The last of all the bores was he.\" It was clear, from the very start, that this was to be among the wettest nights of the season. The Colonel settled himself for a comfortable carouse ; the Priest was not the man to desert his buon camarado ; and Antony declared that there was good cause for a gene ral jollification, as he properly observed, that \" it was not every day that Manus kills a bul lock,\" by which old saw I presume the defunct deer and ourselves are typified.

In life, locahty is everything ; it is not the what one does, it is the where. Venison at a city feast is an every-day concern ; and the best haunch in England would not have the gusto of the red deer's that hangs from the roof within. Com mon comfort, in a wilderness like this, from the barrenness of aU around, receives a zest, which nothing in civihzed society can realize, and 'voila I'exemple.' \" Lighted by a peasant with a bog-deal torch, that emitted more light than forty candles together, the old man approached us with his tray. Coffee taken in the open air, \" in dark ness palpable,\" into which the powerful blaze of the torch which our bare-legged attendant held could but feebly penetrate, associated with the place and company, made an impres sion on my fancy that will not be readily obliterated. Now came \"the sweet hour i' the night,\" and old Care might, if he pleased, have \" hanged himself in his own garters.\" The Priest, whose voice must once have been remarkably fine, and who certainly never im paired it much by \"hallooing psalms,\" sang national melodies, or joined the Colonel and my cousin in glees and catches, which, as Wamba says, were not \" Ul-sung.\" \" Fast and furious \" the mirth proceeded, whUe, \"every pause between,\" clouds of tobacco rose Uke a mist-wreath, and overspread the company with a canopy of vapour. \"Next to modem fanaticism, nothing stirs my choler more,\" said my kinsman, \" than that silly bubble, yclept the Temperance Society. To prevent men from occasionally indulging, no matter what their grade in life may be, is perfectly Utopian. The more you inhibit what the world calls pleasure, the more you urge mankind to the pursuit. Hence, in water drinking, more as in religion, there is the grossest hypocrisy practised ; and I would as soon trust a denouncer of wine with' the key of my cellar, as aUow my cat to have the entree of the dairy. Then, upon the score that health and longevity are interrupted by even a mode rate attachment to the bottle, I deny the posi tion altogether ; and for my proof I would point out the group within.

The Colonel, for thirty years, has been attached to the most dissipated regiments in the service, and excepting that he suffered from gout, which is hereditary in his family, and rheumatism occasioned by a neglected wound, where is there a more vigorous sexa genarian ? But the Priest is probably the best example of them all. Exposed to all the annoyances of his profession, brought con stantly within the sphere of contagion, caUed out of bed at midnight, and obliged to brave weather, when, as it has been happily ex pressed, a man would not reject an enemy's For my own part, every prudential resolution vanished with the first catch ; and it was not till a certain unsteadiness of vision discovered that I had reached that fehcitous state when no twelve honest men, upon oath, would cer tify my sobriety, that I mustered courage to retreat. I felt that, had I remained much longer, I was likely to become hors de combat; and, lighting a cigar, left the cabin to breathe the fresh air, which long since had been super seded in the banqueting-room by an atmo sphere of genuine cannastre. It was a mild, calm, dark night, and such a one feels delicious in the hiUs. Two or three sohtary stars were feebly twinkling in the sky, though, were the truth told, probably there was but one. I took the pathway leading to the river, and sat down upon the banks, to \"blow my cloud\" in solitude. I was not, however, permitted to muse alone ; my kins man immediately joined me, and settling him self upon one of the masses of turf, which the floods tear from the banks of the stream, and leave, when their violence subsides, upon the verge of the river, replenished his meerschaum. \"How refreshing,\" he said, \"to exchange that mephitic air within, for this mUd but bracing night-breeze !

That matchless song was surely written for such a voice and such a company ! \" \" Andrew, fill the glass : the boys are ru minating beside the river ; their young blood is hotter than ours, so we'll stick to the ingle side and the tumbler. There was a day when we could bring a stag to the ground, and scramble up Carrig-a-binniogh as stoutly as the best of them, \u2014 but that day's gone : we have changed for the worse, and so has everything.

There sat a party, who might well put the Temperance Society to the blush. For their years, I suspect there was not a healthier, and I will swear not a happier, trio in the King's dominion. It was just the scene a Flemish artist would select to employ his pencil on. For effect, the Ught was exceUent : the candles having been removed to the extremity of the apartment, the baccha nalian group were revealed by the red and mel low blaze of a briUiant wood-sire. Separated by a table provided with every requisite for a deep carouse, sat the soldier and the church man. The back of the latter was turned to the window, but his amplitude of shoulder and buU-neck at once bespoke the strength for which he was remarkable, while the partial baldness of his head told that he had passed life's meridian. The taU and martial figure opposite contrasted well with the churchman's. Older by some half-score years, he might, like Jack Falstaff, be \"some fifty, ay, or, by the mass, threescore ! \" but his age was green ; and notwithstanding the wear and tear that a military life and its occasional excesses had caused, his cheerful countenance and merry eye showed that he loved yet to hear \" the chimes at midnight.\" The otter-kUler com pleted the group : sitting on a low stool, from time to time he regulated and supplied the wood-fire; his silver hair collected in along cue; seal-skin pouch, singular dress, and vener able air, made him the most striking figure of the party. A little terrier bitch, who never left her master, lay at the old man's feet, while an indulged black setter luxuriated before the blaze, with his intelhgent head and pendulous silky ears rested on the Colonel's knee. \" Not an anker in the barony ! \" returned his companion with a heavy sigh. \" There was a time when my poor cabin could not be taken short for Nantz and Hollands ; but if I can keep a bottle of the native now, it is the most.

In point of fact, few of the tribes here are purely aboriginal ; for Ennis and Con nemara being the Ultima Thule of the land, every wanderer for private and political offences fled to these havens of refuge, and in course of time amalgamated with the native proprietors of the soil. Hence to this day, their descend ants are not unfrequently taunted with being novi homines ; and when a delinquency is com mitted by one of these unhappy hybrids, an aboriginal will probably observe, \" Sure, after all, what could be expected from him, consider ing that his great great-grandfather was from the North! \" \" Is not that indeed a picture ? \" whispered my cousin. \"What heads they have ?

When I was young, priest and minister were hand-and glove. It seems to me but yesterday, when Father Patt Joyce, the Lord be good to him ! lent Mr. Carson a congregation.\" \"Poorly enough,\" answered the Priest. \" This reformation work has put the country clean asunder.\" \" No good will come of it,\" said the Colonel. \" I mind the time in Connaught when no man clearly knew to what religion he belonged ; and in one family, the boys would go to church and the girls to mass, or may be, both would join and go to whichever happened to be nearest. When I entered the militia, I recol lect, the first time I was ever detached from head-quarters, I went with the company to Portumna. Old Sir Mark Blake, who com manded the regiment, happened to be passing through, and the night before he had had a desperate drink with General Loftus at the Castle. When I left Loughrea, I forgot to ascertain where I should bring the men on Sunday, and I thought this a good oppor tunity to ask the question. I opened his bed room-door softly. ' Sir Mark,' says I, 'where shall I march the men?' 'What kind of a day is it?' says he. 'Rather wet,' was my answer. ' It's liker the night that preceded it,' says he. ' Upon my conscience, my lad,' he continued, ' my head's not clear enough at present to recollect the exact position of church and chapel ; but take them to the nearest.' That is what I call,\" and the Colonel shookhis head gravely, \"real Christian feeling.\" \"Eh! what Antony?\" said the Colonel. \"A congregation appears rather an extra ordinary article to borrow.\" \" Faith,\" said the otter-killer, \" it's true. I was there myself, and I'll tell you the story. It was in the time of Bishop Beresford, that beautiful old man, \u2014 many a half-crown he gave me, for I used often to bring game and fish to the palace from the master's father. He was the handsomest gentieman I ever laid my eyes on ; and, och hone ! it was he that knew how to live lUce a bishop. He never went a step without four long-tailed black horses to his carriage, and two mounted grooms behind him. His own bodyman told me, one time I went with a haunch of red-deer and a bittern to the palace, that never less than twenty sat down in the parlour, and, in troth, there was double that number in the hall, for nobody came or went without being well taken care of. \" WeU, it came into old Lord Peter's* head, that he would build a church, and settle a colony of northmen away in the west. Faith, he managed the one easy enough ; but it failed him to do the other, for devU an inch the northmen would come ; for, says they, ' Hell and Connaught's bad enough, but what is either to Connemara ?' \" Real Christian feeling,\" said the Priest, with a groan, \"is nearly banished from the world.

It was late when I got down from the hiUs, and I went to Father Patt's as usual, and who should I meet at the door but the priest himself. ' Antony,' says he, ' ceade fealteagh, have ye anything with you, for the waUets seem full?' 'I have,' says I, ' your reverence ;' and I puUs out two pair of graziers,* and a brace of three-pound trouts, fresh from the sea, that I caught that morning in Dhulough. In these days I carried a ferret, besides the trap and fishing-rod, and it went hard, if I missed the otters but I would net rabbits, or kill a dish of trout. ' Upon my conscience,' says the priest, ' ye never were more welcome, Antony. The minister and myself will dine off the trouts and rabbits, for they forgot to kiU a sheep for us till an hour ago ; and you know, Antony, except the shoulder, there's no part of the mutton could be touched, so I was rather bothered about the dinner.' \" WeU, next day, sure enough, down comes the bishop, and a great retinue along with him; and there was Mr. Carson ready to receive him. ' I hear,' says the bishop, mighty stately, ' that you have no congregation.' ' In faith, your holiness,' says he, ' you'U be soon able to teU that,' \u2014 and in he walks him to the church, and there were sitting threescore weU-dressed men and women, and aU of them as devout as if they were going to be anointed ; for that blessed morning, Father Patt whipped mass over before ye had time to bless yourself, and the clanest of the flock was before the bishop in the church, and ready for his holiness. To see that all behaved properly, Father Patt had hardly put off the vestments, tiU he shpped on a cota more,* and there he sat in a back sate like any other of the congregation. I was near the bishop's reverence; he was seated in an arm-chair belonging to the priest. \u2014 'Come here, Mr. Carson,' says he; 'some enemy of yours,' said the sweet old gentleman, ' wanted to injure you with me. But I am now fully satisfied.' And turning to the dane, ' By this book ! ' says he, ' I didn't see a claner congre gation this month of Sundays \u25a0 ' \" \" WeU, in the evening, I was brought into the parlour, and there were their reverences as cur coddioghf as you please. Father Patt gave me a tumbler of rael stiff punch, and the divil a better warrant to make the same was within the province of Connaught. We were just as comfortable as we could be, when a curriers stops at the door with a letter, which he said was for Mr. Carson. Well, when the minister opens it, he got as pale as a sheet, and I thought he would have fainted. Father Patt crossed himself. ' Arrah, Dick,' says he, ' the Lord stand between you and evU ! is there anything wrong?' 'I'm ruined,' says he; 'for some bad member has wrote to the bishop, and told him that I have no congregation, because you and I are so intimate, and he's coming down to-morrow, with the dane, to see the state of things. Och, hone!' says he, 'I'm fairly rained.' 'And is that aU that's frettin' ye?' says the priest. ' Arrah, dear Dick ' \u2014 for they caUed each other be their cristen names, \u2014 ' is this all ?

And now ventUate the cabin, open door and window, and sling our hammocks as soon as possible.\" Agreeably to this mandate, the kitchen com pany were ejected with scanty ceremony ; the Colonel and the Priest retired to then respec tive beds with wonderful steadiness ; while we took possession of our marquee, which, under existing circumstances, was Paradise itself compared with the cabin, which smoking, drinking, and cooking, had rendered every thing but agreeable. * Young rabbits. f Anglice, comfortable.

The whisky appeared to affect the company differently, and individual propensities were strikingly developed. Some of the boys were particularly amative, and the rude love making we overheard at times amused us much ; others betrayed a pugnancy of spirit which nothing but the master's propinquity repressed. By degrees the company began to separate : the piper, whose notes for the last half-hour had been exceedingly irregular, now evinced un questionable symptomsjof his being\" done up.\" Instead of the Ughtsome and weU-sustained jig, strange and dolorous noises issued from the chanter,* and, as one of the fair sex observed, who, by the way, in passing, tumbled over the tent cords, \u2014 \"Martin was totaUy smothered with spirits, and a body could no more dance to his music, than do the Patre o'pee to a coronach at awake.\" he had seen more of the world than usuaUy faUs to the lot of an ordinary skipper of a fishing boat \u2014 nor was I wrong. I learned from his master, that for some good conduct, no doubt, he had been accommodated with board and lodging in a long's ship for upwards of two years, and that his sojourn there would have been much longer, had he not managed to abridge the visit, by slipping one dark night over the vessel's side, and swimming to the shore, a distance of two nriles. On this Byro nianfeat, however, the honest navigator seldom plumes himself, and it is only when he is \"a bit by the head,\" that this exploit is mentioned. We found the household fully occupied in the cabin ; John in regulating the chamber of state, which, notwithstanding open doors and windows, still retained the miasma of tobacco smoke, and Hennessey in skinning and breaking up the deer. If I had been yesterday delighted with his superior execution with the rifle, I was now surprised at the masterly manner in which he dressed and dismembered the venison. He is certainly a clever feUow, and, could I but forget that he has finished a few of \" the finest peasantry upon earth,\" the man would stand as high in my estimation as he does in his foster brother's, \" our loving cousin.\" It was weU that this faUure in the orchestral department brought the baU to a close, for at midnight the rain began to faU, and towards morning it came down in torrents. We were obliged to rise and slack the tent-cords ; but the marquee was a double one, and perfectly water-tight, and, as the cots were slung from upright posts at least a foot from the ground, we suffered no inconvenience from the rain, except the noise it made in rattling on the tense canvas. This, however, we soon became accustomed to, and slept till eight o'clock, as sound as watchmen. When breakfast was ended, at which, to do them justice, the Colonel and Priest did their devoir most gaUantly, and were occupied in debating what should be the order of the morning's amusement, and to fish, or not to fish, appeared the question, an incident such as in this wild and sylvan state of things every day produces, occurred. It was the arrival of a young lad, who brought an otter-skin of unusual size as a present to \" the master,\" and a wounded hand, whereon Antony was required to exercise his leechcraft. He had been bitten by a wUd cat, and I had the curiosity to examine the wound. The hand was already in a state of high inflammation ; and the ferocity of the creature must indeed have been extra ordinary, to judge from the extent of the injuries it had inflicted. The flesh was sadly lacerated, and in two places the bone was completely exposed. Long before we turned out, the Colonel and Priest were afoot, and we heard a prayer and supphcation from the commander to old John, for a cup of strong coffee, while an idler was despatched to the next weU by the churchman, for a jug of cold spring water. Pattigo, who had rambled up the hiUs with a basket of fish and scaUops, remarked, \"that the gentlemen's coppers, he guessed, were rather hot this morning, and,\" as he eyed the empty bottles which were being removed, \" to judge from the number of marines, it was Uttle wonder.\" From Pattigo's parlance, I suspected that * The principal or finger-pipe of the set."], [112, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 108 in traps ; but they are generaUy too wary to be approached \u2014 and hunting only by night, during the day they sleep in their dens, and are rarely met abroad. The sufferer, it appeared, was not unknown to Antony, and, from the free-masonry which passed between them, I discovered that he is of the same craft, and the person upon whom the otter-killer's mantle is likely to descend, when he, Antony, shall have gone the way of all flesh. The chief occupation ofthe wounded man is digging out foxes in the mountains, which he brings afterwards for sale to the interior, and disposes of at a good price to the masters of hounds. This morning he had gone to a cover in the hUls, in his usual avocation, when, from some traces he observed beneath a rock, he concluded that an animal was earthed there. Having put a terrier in, his suspicions were confirmed, as the dog came out severely torn, and, assisted by a shepherd-boy, he laid rabbit-nets round the den, commenced digging, and, before he had proceeded far, a cat of immense size bolted. She was breaking through the rabbit-net, when the chasseur, with more gaUantry than prudence, seized her by the neck. The fierce animal instantly attacked him in turn, and, fastening upon his hands with teeth and talons, held her desperate grasp untU the boy, with the edge of the spade, broke her back. They brought the dead beast along with them ; it was of a dirty gray colour, double the size of the common house-cat, and its teeth and claws more than proportionately larger. Some estimate of their numbers may be formed, from the circumstance of five males having been killed in a herdsman's out-house which joined the warren. They had been attracted there by one of their own species, and the noise having alarmed the peasant, he guessed the cause, and cautiously managed to stop the hole, by which they gained entrance, with a turf-cleave. Knowing the value of the capture, he kept guard upon the prisoners tiU morning, and then despatched information to the Lodge. My cousin, with his followers, promptly repaired to the place, and, surround ing the barn with guns and greyhounds, bolted the wUd-cats successively, untU the whole number were dispatched. This chasse was not only novel, but profitable. After the death of their persecutors, the rabbits increased prodigiously; but fears are entertained that these destructive animals are become once more abundant in the sand-banks. When the dressings were removed, we found that the poor lad had been so much injured, that apprehension of lock-jaw induced us to send him directly to the infirmary. There is a belief, and one more reasonable than many popular opinions in BaUycroy, that a wUd cats' bite is particularly venomous. My cousin remembers a case which terminated fatally with a servant of his father's; and the Priest mentioned another of a country girl, who, finding one of these animals in a bam, rashly attempted to secure it : the cat wounded her slightly in the leg, and for six months she was unable to use the Umb. These animals fortunately are scarce, and generally frequent the neighbourhood of rabbit warrens, where they prove amazingly destruc tive. Hennessey, two winters since, discovered a den in a cleft of a rock upon the shore, and adjoining the sand-banks,which are numerously stocked with rabbits. It cost him immense trouble to penetrate to the form, where he killed a male and female wUd-cat, the latter being large with young. Hennessey's patience and ingenuity were sorely taxed to effect their destruction, having been obliged to resort to gunpowder, and blow up a large portion of the rock, before he could dislodge his dangerous game. In size and colour, they were precisely simriar to the animal killed in the mountain by the fox-catcher ; and had they been pennitted to continue their species, in a very short time the adjacent burrow would have been devastated. When the unfortunate fox-catcher was leaving us, in return for a trifling donation, he pressed upon me the acceptance of a fine deer skin, which he produced from his waUet. \" He had another for the master,\" he said, \" and he would bring it to him, when he returned from the hospital.\" \"And pray, my friend, how did you get these skins ? \" The question puzzled the wounded man. \" I found them dead, after the great snow last year.\" Besides this large and ferocious species, the warrens upon the coast suffer much from the common cat becoming wild, and burrowing in the rabbit-holes. They are sometimes surprised and shot in the sand-banks, or taken \"After a lump of lead,\" quoth the otter killer, \"had made a fracture in the hide ;\" and he pointed to the orifice in the skin, where evidently a ball had perforated. \"Alas!\" said the Priest, \"the snow is"], [113, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 109 always fatal to the red deer. They are obliged to leave the upper range, and come down the villages :* and there are, unluckily, too many of the old French guns in the country still, and then they are unfortunately busy.\" By the by, speaking of the snow, a very curious circumstance occurred, during its long continuance in 1822. of her oppressors, and escaped. The confusion occasioned by this extraordinary proceeding favoured the deliverance of the fawn, who, profiting by the accident, galloped of unhurt, and, with the dam, succeeded in regaining their native wilds. The whole of the dramatis person\u0153, with the exception of the otter-killer and myself, have gone off to fish some three or four lakes, situate in a hoUow in the mountains, and which are said to be remarkable for the number and flavour of their trouts. I have been prevented by an accident from accompanying the party ; and though my wound be \"not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church-door,\" it still renders me hors de combat. I blistered, or rather neglected a blistered heel : and the fag of yesterday has so excoriated the surface, as to make it imperative upon me to lie by for a Uttle. Antony engages to effect a perfect cure by to-morrow; and here I remain tete-a-tete with the otter-kiUer. A sine hind, accompanied by a stout fawn, travelled across the lowlands in search of pasturage, which the deep snow had rendered unattainable in the mountains. Pressed by the severity of the weather, she at last estab lished herself in a green field which was within sight of the windows of the Lodge. For four weeks, during which the storm continued, she remained there in safety ; for the wfld visitors were protected by the commands of \"the Master:\" and from being undisturbed, con tinued in the place they had first selected. Thinking that they would be a valuable addition to Lord SUgo's park, my kinsman determined to have them captured, and the following Sunday was appointed for the attempt. This day was selected, because the number of persons collected at the chapel would materially assist the execution of the plan. The old man proceeded skUfuUy enough ; he lanced the blisters, and then apphed the cuticle which covers a sheep's kidney, and which is very similar in appearance and effect to what we caU \" gold-beaters' leaf.\" This application prevented the heel from being frayed by the stocking. To the remainder of the foot he rubbed a hot mixture of taUow and whisky ; and his remedy was \" the sovereignest thing on earth, \" for in twelve hours the cure was effected. The day came, and the whole population of the parish was employed. The place was surrounded by a multitude of people, who gradually reduced their circle, until the deer and fawn were completely enclosed, and a cordon of living beings was formed, two deep, around them. The hind had remarked the preparations, and more than once attempted an escape ; but, embarrassed by the fawn, her efforts were abortive. She appeared determined to share its fate, and affection was paramount to timidity. At last, when totaUy surrounded, her courage and address were most incredible. She eyed the circle attentively, made a sharp peculiar noise, as if to warn her offspring of its danger, then charging the ranks where they appeared weakest, bounded over the heads While he operated on my infirm foot, he amused me with one of his interminable stories. He says, by the \"mother's side,\" that I and my cousin are descended from a lady called Rose Roche. When his leech-craft was ended he retired \" to stretch upon the bed.\" \u2014 John was too deeply engaged in culinary affairs to favour me with his company, and having no resource besides, I have been obliged to amuse myself by transcribing the legend of Rose Roche, and became thus a chronicler of the otter-kiUer. CHAPTER XXXIV. THE LEGEND OF ROSE ROCHE. At sixteen Rose Roche was the loveliest maid in Ulster. In infancy she was found exposed at the gate of the Ursulines, and her beauty and destitution recommended her to the charity of the sisterhood. Educated, accordingly, for a conventual life, she had never passed the boundary of the garden-waUs, and accident discovered the existence of beauty, which else * By a village a very few houses are denomi nated, and a stranger would be sadly dis appointed if he formed his ideas of their extent on the English scale."], [114, "110 WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. retiring girl until she disappeared among the cloisters. In vain the proud Superior intro duced costUer wines of rare and ancient vintages : in vain she enlarged upon the piety of her order, and enumerated the number of the Ursulines who had been canonized : \u2014 the Knight's whole thoughts were engrossed with one lovely object \u2014 his courtesy and converse were feeble and constrained, until, piqued by his neglect, the Abbess wished him a fair repose, and retired in fuU state from the apartment, preceded by a crucifix and taper, and foUowed by her attendant nuns. had* faded unseen and unadmircd within those cloisters, to which from chUdhood it had been devoted. Cormac More, lord of Iveagh, was the patron and protector of the community at BaUeek. At primes and vespers a mass was celebrated for his soul's weal. His Easter-offering was ten beeves and five casks of Bordeaux wine ; and on the last Christmas vigU he presented six silver candlesticks to the altar of Our Lady. No wonder that this powerful chief was held in high honour by the sisterhood of Saint Ursula. One tempestuous night in October, wearied with hunting, and separated from his foUowers by darkness and the storm, Cormac More found himself beneath the waUs of the convent of BaUeek. Approaching the gate, he wound his horn loudly, and begged for shelter and re freshment. Proud of this opportunity of affording hospitality to so noble and munificent a protector, the wicket was unbarred, the Lord of Iveagh admitted, and received in honourable state by the Lady Superior, and inducted with due form into the parlour of the Ursulines. Although the Knight lay upon the Bishop's bed, and occupied that honoured chamber where none of a less degree than a mitred abbot had hitherto been permitted to repose, no slumber sealed his Uds, nor was the beauti ful novice for a moment absent from his thoughts. Cormac More had declined many a splendid affiance ; the Lord of Offaly proffeied him an only sister, with a princely dower ; and O'Nial himself courted him for a son-in law, and promised him the barony of Orier, and Blanche, his fairest daughter. But, till now, Cormac had never loved : the beauteous cup-bearer seemed to him a being of another world ; the more he dwelt upon her image, the more his passion was excited ; alUances with lords and princes were overlooked, disparity of rank and fortune was forgotten, and, ere the morning sun had Ughted the storied window of the Bishop's chamber, the Knight's deter mination was formed, and matins were scarcely over when he demanded an audience of the Lady Abbess. There a plentiful repast was speedUy pre pared, and the tired hunter was ceremoniously seated at the table. His morning's meal had been despatched before the sun had topped Slieve Gallion, and a long day's exercise had given him a keen relish for the evening ban quet. The Lady Abbess feasted the patron of her house right nobly \u2014 he was attended on assiduously by the novices \u2014 dish after dish succeeded in luxurious variety, untd the chief requested the tables to be drawn, and with knightly courtesy entreated permission to pledge the holy mother of the Ursulines in a deep draught of Rhenish wine. Never was there greater surprise than that with which the holy mother heard Cormac More express his passion for the novice of the Ursulines. Joy sparkled in her eyes as the noble Lord of Iveagh confided the secret of his love, entreated her powerful intercession, and begged for her sanction to his nuptials. As Rose was stdl unprofessed, there existed no spiritual barrier to her marriage. Flattered by the high honour conferred upon her house by the proudest Baron of the Pale selecting a bride fforh the holy sisterhood, the Superior willingly acceded to his request ; his offers were accepted, and, ere the vesper-beU had tolled, the preliminaries were completed, and the fair novice had consented to become the bride of Cormac More. Then, for the first time, the novice who presented the cup, attracted the good Knight's attention. The folds of her thick veil could not conceal the matchless symmetry of her form ; and, as she fiUed the chalice from the flagon, the exquisite proportions of her hand and arm struck Cormac More with wonder. At this moment her drapery became entangled with the jeweUed pommel of the Knight's rapier ; a hasty attempt to disengage it was unsuccessful \u2014 the veU feU, and disclosed to the enraptured view of the Lord of Iveagh the loveliest features he had ever seen. Covered with blushes, which heightened her surpassing beauty, the novice caught her veil hastily up and retired from the parlour, while the Knight, despite the evident displeasure that thc accident had caused the Lady Abbess, gazed after the But, alas ! the wild ardour of the good Knight, and the carnal motives of the Abbess, caused both to neglect consulting another"], [115, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 111 and the Prior of the Dominicans was summoned to the assistance of the conclave. personage, namely, the blessed Ursula herself, in thus disposing of one devoted to her service from the cradle ; and the saint felt the over sight. That night the Abbess was tormented with fearful and portentous dreams ; the Lord of Iveagh tossed restlessly upon the Bishop's bed ; and, if the novice closed an eye, her slumbers were broken with strange and inco herent visions. In vain, next day, the Knight hunted from sunrise to curfew \u2014 his hounds were eternally at fault, and his foUowers ap peared besotted or bewitched ; the deer, when \u25a0 pressed to the utmost, vanished on the bare moor ; and knight, squire, and yeoman unani mously agreed that the several parties interested in the chase were under the immediate influence of the prince of darkness. To that holy man the exigencies of the re spective parties were intrusted. The Prior was sorely disturbed with doubts, but after a night's deliberation, during which he discussed a capon single-handed, and fortified his stomach with a second scoup of Rhenish wine, he decided, that the Lord of Iveagh should add a flagon to the chaUce ; the Abbess should double her penitentiaries for a month ; and Rose Roche undergo a private penance which he, the Prior, should communicate to the lady alone. Never had such an alarming predicament a happier termination ! The Knight had scarcely laid himself upon the Bishop's bed, untU a sweet and refreshing slumber, blessed with the happiest visions, sealed his eyes ; the Lady Abbess slept Uke a watchman ; and since she had first gathered wild-flowers in the convent garden, never did the fair novice enjoy more delightful dreams ! Nor did the holy Superior of the UrsuUnes fare better than the persecuted Knight and his afflicted companions. Everything about the convent went astray, and the culinary prepara tions for entertaining the Lord of Iveagh were awfuUy interrupted by accident and forgetful ness. The sister who presided over the pastry, and whose conserves, throughout a long and blameless life, had been pronounced unique and irreproachable, now actuaUy omitted the necessary ingredients ; the soup, when un covered for a second, was invaded with such a discharge of soot, as reduced it, in colour at least, to an equality with the broth of Sparta. The nun at the organ, instead of a \"jubilate,\" struck up a \"nunc dimittis ;\" the very bells were \"jangled out of tune;\" and the Lady Abbess was horrified by a succession of prodigies that, from her novitiate to her promotion, had never before visited the quiet residence of the sisterhood of Saint Ursula. At last the bridal day arrived. The Lord of Iveagh was attended by a splendid foUowing. The beUs rang out a joyous peal, and the eieve of the UrsuUnes left the home of her youth, escorted by three hundred horsemen, the con sort of the proudest baron of the Pale. No lover could be more gaUant than the noble husband of Rose Roche. Fete succeeded fete, and feasting continued in the castle of Cormac More from Michaelmas till Advent. Months passed away, and honeymoons can not be expected to last for ever. Cormac More by degrees resumed his hunting, and again involved himself in the endless feuds and war fare of these restless times ; and Rose Roche was often deserted for the chase or the field. She stiU was passionately loved ; but in thc bosom of a martial baron, other and sterner feehngs held a predominance. It is true, that the young bride bore these frequent absences with wonderful resignation ; and page and tirewoman confessed in secret, that Dhu Castle was gayer and merrier when Cormac and his stem companions were away. What were the nocturnal visitations inflicted upon the lovely novice, have not been exactly handed down. One thing alone is certain, \u2014 she visited the Lady Abbess with the first dawn, and in her maternal bosom the bride elect deposited the causes of her sorrow. In this perplexity, the Knight and the Superior held secret counsel in the parlour of the convent, and long and difficult was the conference. The result was, that Cormac More vowed a golden chaUce to the offended virgin ; and the Abbess, not to be outdone in liberality, agreed to double aves and credos for a fortnight. But with Rose Roche herself the chief difficulty was found to lie. All measures proposed by the holy mother were inefficacious ; and, in this desperate dilemma, it was deemed advisable to add to the number of counsellors, A year wore on. The Lord of Iveagh was pensive and thoughtful ; a cloud would often gather on his brow, and his bearing to his beautiful wife became chilling and repulsive. It transpired that two circumstances occasioned his anxiety. His lady wore a curious-fashioned coif, which concealed her tresses as effectuaUy as if she never laid aside her night-cap ; and the cherished hope of an heir to his ancient line now faded in the heart of Cormac More."], [116, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 112 Dhu Castle became duller and more gloomy \u2014 the fair Baroness was more and more deserted \u2014 the chase and banquet were preferred by the moody Knight to soft dalliance in his \" lady's bower,\" \u2014 and any pretext was gladly resorted to, which offered an excuse for being absent from his joyless home. retained. Cormac, irritated by opposition to his commands, was obstinate in his determina tion, and Rose Roche left the castle of her lord a repudiated wife, and once more returned to the convent of the Ursulines. From the hour of their separation, the Baron seldom smUed. To part from his wife was a trifle ; but unluckily, he had embroiled himself with the church. The Abbess espoused the lady's quarrel fiercely, and ave and credo were no longer offered up for Cormac More ! Not withstanding past largess, beeves and wine butts were forgotten ; the candlesticks upon the altar no longer elicited a prayer ; and his soul's health was no more attended to by the community than the lowest horse-boy's of his train. Gentlewomen, in these perilous days, acquired and possessed an astonishing portion of philosophy. No baron's lady \"in the Pale,\"* submitted to a frequent separation from her lord with more laudable submission than Rose Roche. The customary resource of \"wives bereaved\" appeared anything but consolatory to the dame. She determined to avoid crying, as being an unchristian waste of beauty \u2014 and, instead of useless lamentations, she wisely substituted mirth and minstrelsy. Thus matters stood, when one dark evening, returning from the chase, Cormac and his foUowers were surprised by a band of Catterans, and a fierce and desperate skirmish ensued. There was not a more accomplished bard in Ulster than Connor O'Cahan, and for seventy years he had resided with the lords of Iveagh. No tale or tradition connected with this puissant race was unknown to this gifted minstrel : yet, by some strange infirmity of taste, young Rose preferred the right romances of her lord's Enghsh page, to aU the legendary lore of the grey-haired harper ; and Ustened with more delight to a merry roundelay from Edwin's lute than to the deeds of Cormac's grandfather, as set out in song by Connor O'Cahan. The bard, it is true, was bhnd, and the page had the blackest eyes imaginable. The outlaws were defeated, but the Lord of Iveagh was shot clean through the body with a three-foot arrow : and how could he have better luck ? Then it was that the sinful Knight was tortured with remorse and unavaUing sorrow. He cursed the evil counseUors who tempted him to insult Saint Ursula and her adopted daughter, and, determining to be reconcUed to his wife and the church together, directed his followers to carry him to the abbey of BaUeek. His orders were obeyed, and the Lady Abbess consented to admit the dying noble. He was laid before the altar, and his injured wife, forgetting past resentment, was tlie first to rush from her ceU, and minister to his relief. In the fatal emergency, coif and veil were left behind ; her raven tresses feU below her shoulders, and reached to her very waist, and Cormac was convinced too late, that hisiU-used consort had the finest hair in Christendom. Alas ! those ebon locks had been the admiration of the whole sisterhood ; and, for penitential purposes, the Dominican had enjoined their concealment for three years, when he gave spiritual counsel, in their hour of tribulation, to the abbess, the baron, and Rose Roche. This unhappy predriection was not concealed from her loid. His jealousy instantly took fire, and the handsome page was suddenly removed, and none knew whither. The absence of an heir had now become matter for serious complaint : it was whispered among the Baron's foUowers that there was no cause for hope, and maliciously insinuated, moreover, that the close coif adopted by the dame was worn to conceal some natural deformity. Cormac, a slave to suspicion, and instigated by his rude companions, insisted that the hood should be discarded, or that Rose Roche should retire in disgrace to the convent from whence she came. On the alternative being proposed, the lady proved positive, and the coif was peremptorily To make atonement for his former unkind ness, he wUled his rich domains to his beautiful widow. The Prior of the Dominicans indicted the deed which disposed of his possessions ; and the church, of course, was not forgotten. Surrounded by all the emblems of religion, and with a splinter of the true cross in his right hand, the penitent Baron breathed his * The Pale was a line of demarcation drawn by the English settlers between their acquired possessions and the remoter districts, which were still permitted to remain with the ancient proprietors.

He lay for three days and nights in the chancel, in great state ; and was interred on the fourth morning, with aU the ceremonies that both Ursulines and Dominicans could bestow. the neighbourhood, besides the Big Man of the West,\" for so the Thane of Connaught was entitled. In this extremity, the lady resolved to exer cise, at least, the privilege of free choice. The Prior was directed to engross a bond, by which the respective candidates for her hand bound themselves to grant an uncontrolled right of selection to the widow, and covenanted, more over, neither to molest, nor permit her to be molested, when her choice was made. The deed was duly executed \u2014 the day for her decision was named \u2014 and a reasonable time aUowed for \" the Big Man of the West \" to attend and try his fortune. The days of mourning passed over : Rose Roche exercised her resignation ; and Dhu Castle became a very different place to what it had been during the latter days of the defunct Baron, and mirth and music were exchanged for the rude revelry of Cormac More. Her hall was filled with guests ; at the board she did the honours nobly ; and when she visited the green wood, with her gold-beUed hawks and gaUant retinue, she looked as if she had been ennobled from the Conquest, and in bearing and attire seemed \" every inch a queen.\" O'Connor was surprised when the determina tion of the fair widow was communicated. He had only time for a hurried preparation, as his rivals, from their vicinity to the lady, had never taken the remoter situation of \" the Big Man' ' into their consideration when they named the day. O'Connor, however, was no sluggard ; he coUected his \" foUowing \" with all haste, and every department was complete, when, alas ! the chief harper feU sick without a cause, and no other was procurable for a distance of sixty miles. In this dilemma a Saxon youth, who two years since had been shipwrecked beneath the castle waUs, was recoUected. He could not, it is true, \"strike the bold harp,\" but he had a sweet and meUow voice, and his skiU upon the lute was admirable. In word craft he was a thorough proficient, and with lance and brand had more than once proved himself a man. O'Connor had no alternative, and the stranger was selected to fiU a place that \"Cathwold O'Connor of the harp\" should have more worthily occupied. But amid aU this splendour and magnificence, poor Rose had her own secret causes of inquietude. Beauty, accompanied by broad lands, could not but induce suitors without number to come forward, and never was woman, not excepting Penelope herself, more vigorously besieged. From past experience, Rose was not ambitious to exchange wealth and liberty for becoming the wife of some doughty baron, who would probably under value her charms, just as much as he would over-estimate his own great condescension in giving her his name. A tender recoUection of one, long since lost, would cross her mind occasionaUy ; and in her solitary hours the black-eyed page haunted her imagination. Accordingly she eschewed aU offers for her hand with exceUent discretion. Few were offended, she managed her rejections so pru dently : and through the first year of widow hood neither lands nor hberty were lost. The consort of the wise Ulysses herself could not have held out for ever. Rose was severely pressed ; for, finding themselves foiled by her ready wit and good discretion, when they attacked her singly, her lovers, from necessity, agreed to coalesce, and determined that one should be accepted, and the remainder be pledged to support the acquired rights of the fortunate candidate, as report said King Henry had resolved to gift a favourite noble with the person and estates of the beautiful widow. Although the Thane of Connaught and his gaUant company pushed forward with all the speed that man and horse could make, from bad roads and flooded rivers, they were unable to reach the heights above Dhu Castle until the sun of the eventful day had set. In vain knight and squire pressed on their jaded steeds \u2014 evening feU ; all the candidates besides had been in the haU for hours, and, as \" the Big Man \" had not appeared, according to modern parlance he was voted present by the company, and the banquet was served. This agreement of her suitors was politely but decisively intimated to Rose Roche, and the Prior declared, \"by the vestment,\" that to evade' matrimony longer was impossible. \" She had,\" the holy man said, \" an ample list to choose from : there were eleven suitors in Never with such heavy heart did Rose Roche assume the place of honour. Though her haU was righted splendidly, and her table crowded with the proudest nobles within \" the Pale ' ' \u2014 though rich wine flowed, and the most skriful harpers in the province poured forth H"], [118, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 114 accident I have unwittingly occasioned some delay; therefore, in pity to my gaUant com petitors, I beg you, lady, to terminate then suspense, and declare to this noble company the happy object of your choice.\u2014 Nay, blanch not so, fan dame,\" for the lady became pallid as the white marble of a warrior's tomb: \"exercise your own pleasure leisurely; and whUe I pledge thy matchless beauty in a cup of muscadine, Aylmer, my bard, shaU sing a Saxon roundelay.\" As he spoke, O'Connor signed to the minstrel, who, rising at his lord's bidding, struck with a rapid hand the prelude of a Ught romance, which, with a tremulous, but powerful voice, he thus gave words to : \u2014 \" Lady, farewell !\u2014 the fatal hour their lays of love and war \u2014 yet one heart was heedless of gaiety and grandeur ; and that one was hers on whom every eye was bent, in deep expectancy awaiting her decision. The curfew rang \u2014 and in another hour the happy Lord of Dhu Castle would be proclaimed. As the moments flew, the beautiful widow became paler and more dejected ; and breasts which had never quailed amid the roar of battle, now throbbed as nervously as a maiden's, when she listens to the first tale of love. The harps were mute, the revel became less loud, for aU were deeply interested in that event which abrief space must determine. At this embarrassing moment, a loud blast was heard at the grand gate, and the seneschal rushed in, to announce the arrival of the Thane of Connaught, attended by a noble foUowing of, at least, one hundred horse. Has sped, for thus thy tyrant wiUs, When he, who loves thee, leaves this tower, Deserts gay hall and wood and bower Of her, for whom his heart's pulse thrills ; And thou art she \u2014 Ladye \u2014 sweet Ladye.\" The sudden and opportune appearance of him of the West seemed to affect the company variously. His rivals heard the news with mingled feelings of jealousy and alarm, which was in no way abated when the number of his attendants was announced, which exceeded that of then united foUowings. Rose Roche felt a secret pleasure at his coming ; not that her sentiments towards O'Connor were more favourable than to her suitors generaUy, but his late arrival must necessarily occasion some delay, and postpone, though but for brief space, that dreaded moment when she should surrender a hand, without a heart, to her future lord. When the minstrel touched the prelude, Rose Roche became visibly ; but when the words feU from his lips, a burning blush dyed her cheeks and brow, and her heart throbbed almost to bursting. Alas ! it was the very roundelay the poor page had sung beneath her casement on that melancholy night when her defunct lord had expeUed him from the castle ! She turned hastUy round to see who the strange youth might be who thus recaUed her absent love in look and voice so forcibly. Blessed Ursula ! it was he, the long lost page ! The minstrel, as he caught her eyes, suddenly ceased his melody \u2014 the lute feU from his nervous grasp, and, over come by feehngs that could not be controUed, he sank upon the bench behind him. It was, indeed, young Aylmer. The weU-remembered features could never be forgotten although the boy had ripened into manhood \u2014 the thick down upon the Up had changed to a dark moustache \u2014 and the belt which once held a hunting-blade supported now a goodly brand. While O'Connor, as the greatest stranger, was placed beside the lady of Dhu Castle, his bard stood behind his master, and Iris train bestowed themselves where they could best find room. As Rose Roche looked carelessly around to see that the band were fitly accom modated, her eyes met those of the young minstrel : \u2014 the blood rushed to her brow ; for, excepting those of herownloved page, she never looked upon a pair so black and sparkling as the stranger's. The strange effect of the melody upon the lady, and the minstrel's sudden indisposition, could not escape remark ; a startring suspicion flashed across the minds of the company, and, after a painful silence of some minutes, Hubert de Moore rose from his seat, and bowing to the very table, thus addressed the lady of tlie castle : When the Thane of Connaught had feasted to his heart's content, the Prior of the Dominicans produced the parchment, to which his rivals had affixed their signatures already. The \"Big Man\" listened attentively as the monk read it. \" 'Tis all fair,\" he said, as he placed his sign manual to the deed, \" that lady should choose her lord ; and thus I bind myself faithfuUy to abide the intents of this parch ment.\" Then turning to Rose Roche, he thus proceeded : \" It grieves me, that through \"Wilt thou forgive the humblest but most devoted of thy suitors, if he presume to remind you that the hour has long since passed when your election should have been made ? Far be it from me, noble dame, to seem importunate ;"], [119, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 115 but suspense is irksome to those that love, and I and my brother nobles pray to you to signify your pleasure, and end uncertainty at once.\" \" It is a trick,\" cried De Moore. \"The selection rests with ourselves alone,\" exclaimed Mandeville. While De Moore was speaking, Rose Roche appeared to recover her self-possession wonder fully ; her eye brightened, her colour came again, and the compression of her lips proved that she was nerving herself for some deter mined effort. She rose slowly and gracefully, while a dead silence pervaded the haU ; faint and tremulous as the first words were, they were distinctly heard by those remotest from the dais.* \"We wiU never brook that page or minstrel should hold the lands and castles of Cormac More,\" said both together : and they laid their hands upon then swords ; the attendants followed the example of their lords, and a scene of violence and discord was about immediately to ensue. O'Connor slowly rose \u2014 he waved his hand to command sUence, and his wishes were promptly obeyed. \"Noble lords,\" she said, \" I own and thank your courtesy : I ask this holy churchman if I am to exercise free choice in this affair, un shackeled with bar, or condition, save my own pleasure : and if he whom I shaU place here,\" and she pointed to the vacant seat beside her own, which had been reserved for the successful wooer, \" shaU be supported in aU the rights and properties which he shaU obtain through me ? ' ' \" This is, indeed, an unexpected choice,\" he said : \" Sir Prior, read thy parchment aloud, that all may hear, and read it carefully, Une after line, and syUable by syUable, and see that a letter be not omitted.\" The monk obeyed. \"The document is a plain one,\" said the \"Big Man,\" \"and by it the lady has good right to choose whom she listeth for her consort. Lady of Iveagh,\" he continued, as he turned to the blushing widow, \"is this youth the husband of thy choice ? \" \u2014 \" He and none besides, so help me saints and angels ! \" was the solemn answer. \" Then, by my father's ashes, and a knight's word that never yet was questioned, thou, Aylmer Mowbray, shalt this night possess thy bride f And why, my lords, chafe you so at this ? \" for the storm was again about to burst forth : \" Is it because the monk was but a sorry lawyer, and the lady took ad- vantage of a loose parchment, which should have bound her better ? Is it that the Lord of Dhu Castle was once a page ? What was thy ancestor, De Moore, (I mean not to offend thee,) but usher to the Lord Justice? and thine, Mandeville, but chamber-groom to Strongbow? Aylmer, I love thee too weU to envy thee thy good fortune : \u2014 thy lute has won the lady \u2014 thy lance must keep her lands. Kneel down, minstrel no longer \u2014 - rise up, my own knight banneret ! And now, Lords of the Pale, Hemy himself could not confer a nobler dignity ; for O'Connor's knight is standard-bearer to the King of Connaught ! Does any here gainsay his rank and dignity ? The sword that conferred the honour is ready and able to maintain it ! \" And O'Connor, as he ended, flung belt and rapier on the table. \"All this,\" said the Prior, \" is fairly stipu lated in the intents osthis scroU.\" \" Then wUl I not trespass on your patience, noble lords \u2014 there stands the object of my choice ; and thus do I instaU him in this seat, as lord and master of Dhu Castle : \" She turned to the astonished minstrel as she spoke, and ere her words were ended, the youth was seated at her side. A scene of wonder and wild confusion followed \u2014 most' of the barons protested loudly against her choice ; angry looks and threaten ing gestures were directed at the minstrel, and more than one sword was half unsheathed. O'Connor seemed thunderstruck \u2014 and the lady herself was the most coUected of the company. \" How is this, Sh Knights ! \" she cried. \"Is lordly word and written pledge so lightly held among you, that thus ye violate their sanctity? Thane of Connaught,\" she con- tinued, as she addressed herself to the \"Big Man,\" \u2014 \"thy faith was never questioned, and thy word is held to be sacred as a martyr's vow. When the English King, under pain of confis- cation, ordered thee to dehver the stranger up, whom thou hadst resetted \u2014 although five hun- dred marks were upon his head, what was thy answer ? ' The lands may go, but plighted faith must stand ! ' The ink with which you bound yourself to the conditions of yonder bond is not yet dry upon the parchment, and will thou break thy word ?\" But none seemed disposed to quarrel with him : and graduaUy they foUowed his example, and admitted the lady's right of choice.

The fishing party had been successful, and returned late in the evening with two baskets of trout, which, although of smaU size, were remarkable for beautiful shape and excellent flavour. baskets, which amounted to at least twelve dozen, I could only find two fish which weighed above a pound. The dark trout, however, from their superior size, are more sought after by the mountain fishermen. They rarely are taken of a smaUer weight than a pound, and sometimes have been killed, and particularly with a worm, or on a night-line, of a size little inferior to that of a moderate salmon. It is a curious fact, that the loughs where the party angled, though situate in the same vaUey, and divided only by a strip of moorland not above fifty yards across, united by the same rivulet, and in depth and soil at bottom, * to all appearance, precisely similar, should produce fish as different from each other as it is possible for those of the same species to be . In the centre lake, the trout are duU, iU-shapen, and dark coloured ; the head large, the body lank, and though of double size, compared to their neigh bours, are killed with much less opposition. In the adjacent loughs, their hue is golden and pellucid, tinted with spots of a brilliant ver milion. The scales are bright, the head smaU, the shoulder thick, and from their compact shape, they prove themselves, when hooked, both active and vigorous. At table they are red and firm, and their flavour is particularly fine \u2014 while the dark trout are white and flaccid, and have the same insipidity of flavour which distinguishes a spent from a healthy salmon. The red trout seldom exceed a herring-size, and in looking through the contents of the The fishing party determined that Antony's account of the otters being very numerous about those lakes, was perfectly correct. Their paths between the waters were much beaten, and the spraintt* of the animal fresri and frequent. There is a lake still further up the mountains, and some hundred feet above the level of these loughs, which produces trout not more remark able for size than for their peculiarity in never rising at a fly, or taking a bait ; and yet they are frequently observed by the herdsmen who fre quent the vaUey where the lake is situated, rising over the water, or, to use then own phrase, \" tumbling about Uke dogs.\" From the known attachment of the lower classes of this country to indulge in \" the wild and wonderful,\" their size or existence might be doubtful, were it not that they run lUte eels in the latter part of the harvest, and at that season are taken, after a flood, in the pools of the little river, which communicates directly with the lake. These trout have been found to weigh upwards of twelve pounds, and are said to be in shape and colour like large gilaroos, and of superior flavour when brought to table. * I never observed the effect of bottom soil upon the quality of fish so strongly marked as in the trout taken in a small lake in the county of Monaghan. The water is a long irregular sheet, of no great depth \u2014 one shore bounded by a bog, the other by a dry and gravelly surface. On the bog side, the trout are of the dark shapeless species peculiar to moory loughs \u2014 while the other affords the beautiful and sprightly variety, generally inhabiting rapid and sandy streams. Narrow as the lake is, the fish appear to confine themselves to their respective limits ; the red trout being never found upon the bog moiety of the lake, nor the black where the under surface is hard gravel.

He recollects, however, hearing \"when a boy,\" that there was formerly an old man, who resided contiguous to the lake, who caught trout most plentifully near the centre of the water, by floating lines across it, their ends being attached to the legs of geese ; but he admits his belief that this was but a popular conceit, and wisely comes to the conclusion, \" that there is a sea-horse, or some such devil in the lough, which prevents the fish from taking fly or worm.\" * which parents conclude matches between their children without consulting the inclinations of the parties most concerned in the affair.

Then a wonderful series of bargain-makingcommences: upon the lady's side it being insisted that the abductor shaU forthwith make her \" an honest woman : \" while the gallant usuaUy demurs to the \" amende honorable,\" untUthe \" consider ation \" for doing the same is propounded and guaranteed. Now it is that the priest engages deeply in the negotiation. He assumes the first place in the corps diplomatique, and be comes prime minister. In the conduct of the affairs, no doubt himself is interested; he is anxious to effect hymeneals, for hence arises his principal revenue, and matrimony is the best feather in his wing \u2014 and, independent of the nuptial fee, contingent christenings and increased house money % are in prospective. But the lover has it all his own way.

The moors have become soft, and are now very distressing to traverse. The grouse have deserted their cus tomary haunts, are found with difficulty, and from their wridness, wUl hardly stand the dogs. Winter is fast approaching, and the time is close at hand when the cabin must be aban doned for the more substantial comforts of the Lodge. And I shaU leave this hut and these hills with sincere regret. PaUed with the pleasures of the world, I found here that rude, but real happiness, which for years before I had sought in vain. Here I associated with a new order of beings. I compared them with the artificial society I had consorted with, and found among them some traces of natural virtues, which ultra civilization rias banished from the rest of mankind. There may be here, no doubt, much ignorance and superstition to be regretted, and false opinions and falser modes of action to be corrected \u2014 but even for their vices I can find an apology, and their worst crimes wiU appear, upon examination, to be either consequent upon moral neglect, or arising from rude and barbarous notions of what appears to them nothing but retributive justice. The grave offences with which these wUd people are principally charged, appear to be abduction and murder ; and both are of fre quent recurrence. The first, indeed, is so prevalent, that any lady bent upon celibacy had better avoid BaUycroy, and particularly so if she has obtained the reputation of being opu lent. This crime, however, is seldom of a dark character, and is generally traceable to local causes, and the very unceremonious mode in * It may be easily imagined that glass is a scarce article in Ballycroy. Accordingly, in the still and drinking houses, an egg-shell is used as a substitute. t \" Dry money \" is synonymous with \" hard cash.\" * In the neighbourhood of Minola, there is a lake called Carramore, where the trout are said to be equally large, and in refusing baits and flies equally refractory. I have never fished the water, or seen the trout ; but they are taken during harvest floods, in a mill-race, which runs directly from the lough ; their size is from four to ten pounds. I The revenues of the Roman Catholic clergy are derived from certain fees payable for mar rages and christenings, with an annual tax of two shillings upon every house in the parish. These, with Christmas and Easter offerings, presents, and legacies, amount, in populous parishes, to a very considerable sum."], [122, "118 WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. than thrice the number of weddings perpetrated by general consent. ficiaUy resorted to by the peasantry, are, from want of means of egress from the highlands, embargoed to these hapless people. Left to their own resources, what can this wretched population do ? At the mercy of hireling drivers and cold-hearted agents, they are required on a given day to produce trie rent \u2014 honestly if they can \u2014 but to produce it. To convey their miserable grain crop to a distant market would greatly abate the amount of the sale, by the expense and difficulty attendant upon the carriage. An easier mode of dis posing of it is presented. The still is substi tuted for the market ; and hence, three parts of the corn grown in these bogs and hills are converted into whisky. This mUder class of abduction is unfortu nately not the only one ; girls having property, or who are likely to possess it, are oftentimes forcibly carried off. Secreted in the moun tains, they are not easriy recoverable by their friends, and left at the mercy of the ruffian and his confederates, they are at last obhged to become the legal property of the despoUer. As the abductor is generaUy some idle dissipated blackguard, the fate of the Ul-starred being who is united to him under such circumstances for Use, is truly lamentable. The second and worst description of crime, of which this remote district unhappUy affords too many instances, is murder. Many circum stances tend to encourage it. The system of clanship, and the imperfect administration of the laws, are chief causes. A strange infatua tion prevents these people from surrendering a culprit ; and to conceal or abet the escape of a criminal from punishment, is felt to be a sort of moral obrigation not to be got over. Hence, the feudal system prevails in BaUycroy of repaying injury by injury ! rather than submit the offender to the ordinary course of justice ; violences committed by one faction are fear fully returned by the other ; and in a country where ardent spirits are easily procured, and where ancient customs, and the endless num ber of holy days enjoined by the Church of Rome bring the parties into frequent collision, it is not wonderful that disastrous consequences ensue. Maddened by whisky, the national pugnacity bursts forth, old injuries are re membered, the worst passions are called into action, and loss of hfe is too commonly the result. At first sight, the advantages of private dis tillation appear immense. The grain will reahse nearly three times the price that it would have produced if sold for exportation ; but when the demorahzation, and waste, and ulte rior risk are considered, the imaginary profits are far overbalanced by the certain or contin gent losses which attend it. From the moment that the grain is first wetted to the time the spirit has been doubled, the ordinary habits of the peasant are inter rupted. Night and day, he must be on the alert \u2014 and if there were no greater penalty beyond the unbidden visits of every idle black guard who drops in to taste the \" barley bree,\" it would be a sufficient punishment for the offence. But this is the smaUest tax upon the produce of the stiU ; when the process is com plete, much of the produce is expended in drunken hospitahty. If, after aU these draw backs, the residue be disposed of in the town, or sold to some itinerant whisky-dealer, the adventure is prosperous ; but the chances of detection, seizure, fine, and imprisonment, are so multitudinous, as to render the vending of this pernicious article a ruinous trade. To succeed encourages him to continue in this hazardous manufacture ; and then upon him who night and day parches in a stiU-house, certain drunkenness is entailed, with sooner or later a loss of property, from the casualties incident to the adventure ; and hence, more people have been beggared by this demoral izing traffic, than aU the misfortunes which bad seasons, bad crops, and worse stiU, bad land lords could accomplish. That any competent moral remedy can be employed to check these barbarisms, is hope less, while the present destructive system of private distiUation is encouraged by the land lord and abetted by the revenue. The landlord is the chief delinquent \u2014 for owing to abomi nable jobbing, the monies taken from the public purse, and intended to open a communication between this wild country and the more in habited districts, have been scandalously mal versated, and lavished upon useless works, merely to reward favouritism, or benefit agents and dependents. No serviceable attempts have been made to facilitate the transport of grain from the mountains to those towns from whence it could be sent abroad ; and hence, the only markets which could be legitimately and bene- Difficult as the task is found of conveying grain from the highlands, the denizens of the ' coast possess little advantage from their own locality. Want of harbours renders the voyage \u2022"], [123, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 119 hazardous, and the arrival of the grain at market an uncertainty ; and many a peasant, from rough seas and contrary winds, has been ruined. One instance of this was mentioned, and it so forcibly exemplifies the misfortune, that I shaU transcribe it. The unlucky owner was eventuaUy obliged to bring it back, and in self-defence to malt and distil it. The process was completed, and the spirits safely brought to the town of Castlebar. There it was seized by the Revenue, the pro prietor imprisoned for four months, and his cattle and furniture at home canted to pay that rent, which the corn, had it been market able, would have more than realized. By this accumulation of misfortune, the unhappy man was reduced to the greatest misery, and from having been once an opulent landholder, he is at this moment a cottier upon what was for merly his farm, with nothing to support a wife and seven children, but a limited potato garden, and occasionaUy sixpence a day, when he is lucky enough to obtain employment at that price. A person of comfortable means, having suf fered severe loss from private distiUation, de termined that he would never \"wet a grain during his natural Use.\" He snipped his com accordingly in a hooker for Westport, it being the nearest place where a purchaser could be found. Bad weather and contrary winds came on, and during eight days, for so much time was occupied in the passage, the grain was exposed to rain and spray etemaUy, and when it reached its destination, was found to be so much damaged, as to be rendered unfit for sale.

The day for our departure is fixed, and the order for breaking up our bivouac has issued ; we leave the cabin to-morrow, and some of us, in course of mortal changes and chances, are never fated to visit it again, and \" breast the keen air\" of these extensive mountains. We have all devoted this, our last day, to separate pursuits. I, with my kinsman, take to the hills, whUe the Colonel and the Priest descend the river, thus embracing sports by \" feU and flood.\" Old Antony, encouraged by the report of the fishing party, has hobbled off at daybreak with his trap and terrier, determined, as he expressed it, \" to try his fortune once more before he died.\" A shep herd boy accompanied him, and when the dis tance and difficulty of the ground is con sidered, the old man's courage is surprising, and nothing but that master passion, which through a long hfe has been remarkable, could nerve the otter-killer to the enterprise. birds who appeared determined not to stand a point, accident did for us what neither art nor local experience could achieve. On a narrow strip of heather, which fringed the banks of a little rivulet, one of our youngest and wUdest setters stopped in his career as if he had -been shot. The suddenness of his check, and the steady point he stood at, inti mated that the birds were immediately beside him ; and whUe my cousin, who happened to be at a httle distance, hurried up, Hennessey observed a splendid pack of fifteen birds steal ing off across the bare bog. It was a brood of very unusual number to meet with at this advanced season, when the strongest 'packs have generally been reduced by gun or vermin. The moor that adjoined the banks on which the grouse were found was a barren soft sur face, without either heath or broken ground to cover our approach ; and when we attempted to close up, the cock took wing, and the pack rose instantly and crossed the flats, continuing their flight over a smaU lull, until we lost them altogether. Our last day's sport, during its forenoon, was most unpromising. The birds were scarce, unsettled, and \" wild as hawks.\" From the extreme steadiness of the dogs, we sometimes succeeded in surprising them ; but generally the cock took alarm, and gave the signal for escape, and the brood got off with a random shot or two. At last, when almost weary of following We were very doubtful whether we should foUow them, as the hiU was particularly steep and barren, and the ground beyond it, to judge from appearances, as bare as the exposed moorlands the birds had quitted. At this"], [124, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 120 moment of indecision Hennessey recoUected that there was a little valley beneath the brow where the grouse had left our view ; but my kinsman, often as he had been on these hiUs, had never before been aware of its situation. Hennessey's information determined us to proceed ; we accordingly clambered up the ascent, and when we reached the brow of the height, discovered immediately below one of tlie sweetest glens I ever looked at, stretching between the basis of the hiU we occupied, and the higher ridge beyond it. It was an admir able retreat for grouse ; several rivulets trickled through the hollow, and everywhere it was covered with thick tall heath, in rich blos som, and the cranberries, of which these birds are particularly fond, were growing all around in great abundance. Delighted with our new discovery, we determined to investigate this land of promise closely, and our expectations, though excited by the appearance of this beautiful glen, were amply realised. We found the pack that escaped us in the low grounds, and they paid dearly for the long walk they had given us in the pursuit. The valley produced two other broods, and soon, after some hours of capital shooting, we found our game bags, when we left the glen, in creased by twenty-three of the finest birds I ever saw. We might have thinned the packs still more, but my kinsman was anxious to leave this secret valley with a sufficient stock, to render it a sure resource when grouse could not be otherwise obtained. This was indeed a good wind-up to our highland shooting : and as we sprang several scattered birds during our return, we decided that this was our best day throughout the season, and worthy of the brightest page of the game book, in which all our failures and successes were duly and faithfuUy chronicled since we took to the hUls. panion returned with empty baskets, the little animal managed to secure the finest and freshest salmon in the river. To give eclat to our parting feast, a red deer haunch had been reserved, and in its roasting John, as poor Napoleon would say, \" covered himself with glory.\" Dinner passed as such a dinner should pass. The Colonel and the Priest appeared bent upon convivi ality. We, too, prepared for a jovial carouse, and it was generally determined that our part ing banquet should be the \" merriest, as the last.\" Evening passed quickly \u2014 there was no moon visible till after midnight, and the wind, which had hitherto been unheard, began to make that mournful noise around the cabin which generaUy indicates an approaching change of weather. The otter-killer's absence was now, for the first time, remarked, and I observed that my kinsman rose frequently from the table to look long and anxiously from the window: Another hour passed, and our alarm was fearfuUy increased, for, aware of the feebleness of the old man, we apprehended that he would be unable to make good his journey ; and, if benighted in the moors, the probability was great that he would perish of cold before the morning. Whde we remained in painful suspense, each feeling an unwillingness to interrupt the com fort of the evening by expressing fears that haply might only be imaginary, a squaU rushed up the river, and showed us that the wind had chopped round to the westward several points since twilight. At that moment a commotion was heard;, outside ; the pipes ceased \u2014 loud and earnest whisperings succeeded \u2014 the door opened, and Johrr, with a pale face and hurried voice, told us that the otter-kiUer was missing, and the boy who had accompanied him in the morning to the lakes had now returned with out being able to give any tidings of old Antony, from whom it appeared that he had separated several hours before. A curious incident supplied us with an ex cellent white fish. The servant who brought the post-bag, when in the act of crossing the river, which, in his route from the lodge, he was obliged to do repeatedly, most unex pectedly encountered a large otter carrying off a large salmon he had just seized. The post man attacked the poacher vigorously, who, dropping his prey, glided off into the deep water at the tail of the ford. The spoil proved to be a fresh salmon not twenty hours from the sea, and consequently in prime condition. The otter showed himself the best artist of the day, for while the Colonel and his cpm- \" Get lights instantly ! \" exclaimed my cousin. \"Away all of you! disperse right and left across the bogs. Come, Frank, on with the brogues ; I fear our poor otter-killer is but ' a lost priest.' No, Colonel, your ser vices would be useless \" \u2014 for the commander, forgetting gout and rheumatism, and alive only to the danger of his ancient associate, had pre pared to accompany the party. In a few minutes every effective member of our body-politic was in motion. The scene"], [125, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 121 was uncommon and picturesque. It being pitch dark, as the respective parties dispersed across the moor upon their different routes to the mountain lakes, the stream of torch-light falling upon the figures as they were revealed and hidden by the inequalities of the ground they traversed, was really imposing. Their wild shouts died gradually as the distance increased, and presently nothing was heard by our party but the rushing of the stream and the moaning of the blast. \"We want instant help,\" said my cousin; \"jump upon the bank, and see if anybody is near us.\" His foster-brother rushed up the brow and whistled loudly ; but the signal was unheard or unheeded. Again he exerted himself, but ineffectually, to make the flanking parties hear him ; there was no reply. \"This maybe heard,\" he muttered; and, drawing a pistol from his. breast, the loud report was answered by 'a distant halloo. Next moment lights appeared, and our shouts and whistles directed the torch-bearers to the place. Obedient to Hennessey's advice, we foUowed the river path, as the likeliest one which the otter-killer would select in his unfortunate attempt to return to the cabin. On either side of the moorland the peasants were extended, and occasionaUy we caught a glimpse of their fading lights, as they glanced and disappeared among the hillocks. Our own path was so rough and difficult that the torch could not secure us from many and severe falls ; and from the extreme darkness of the night it was too evident that Antony could never make good his way. We almost despaired of being enabled to render assistance to the unfortunate object of our search. We disencumbered the dying man of the iron trap, and our attempts to restore suspended animation appeared to be partially successful ; but the Priest, who led the party coming to our relief, gave us still better hopes by ascer taining that the old man's pulse was beating. From the assistance we received, the unfor tunate otter-killer was transported quickly to the cabin. A bed was already heated, and John had abundance of warm water to bathe his chilled limbs. Our unabated efforts were crowned with ultimate success ; for before midnight he had recovered his speech, and was enabled, though with some difficulty, to give us the particulars of his unlucky excursion. Suddenly, Hennessey, who led the party, halted. \" By heaven ! \" he exclaimed ; \" I heard either a fox's whimper, or the cry of a dog.\" He reached, it appeared, the loughs soon after daylight, and discovered the numerous footmarks which the fishing party had already observed. One trace he particularly foUowed, and, from the spraint, concluded the animal would cross the path again before evening ; and, after setting his trap, Antony retired to a distance, whence, himself unseen, he could watch the event. He put his fingers to his lips and whistled shrilly, and instantly a long-sustained howl answered to the signal. \" It is Venney's cry,\" said our leader. \"God grant that her master be still alive ! \" We pushed forward rapidly for several hun dred yards in the direction the noise was heard from ; and the whining of a dog, broken now and then by a long and piercing howl, con tinued to guide us. We reached the place, and on turning a rock which elbowed into the river abruptly, found the old man extended on the ground, cold and motionless. The trap was bound across his back, and a large otter lay at some yards distance from the place where he had fallen. At twilight, as the old man had conjectured, the otter, on his return, crossed the path, and was secured, and the hunter and his terrier made good the capture. Proud of his success, which to the old man seemed a proof that his energies were not yet gone, he foolishly endea- voured to carry this trophy of his sldll along with him, instead of leaving it with his trap, for some gossoon to bring in the morning to the cabin. He turned his steps homeward ; but the trap and the otter, with the soft and harassing ground he had to traverse, speedily exhausted his feeble strength ; the light faded away, the wind rose, and before he crossed the swamp, and gained the firm but rugged path beside the river, the darkness rendered it almost impossible for even a young person to ,have proceeded safely. After feeble and slow We raised him up, while the faithful terrier frisked about us, and testified sincere delight at the promised recovery of her master. The old man's eyes feebly opened when the torch light flashed upon his face. This symptom of existing life encouraged us, and, as his ex tremities were cold and powerless, his master and I rubbed them briskly between our hands while Hennessey poured some brandy down his throat."], [126, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 122 efforts to get forward, he stumbled over a stone, his energies were totaUy exhausted by fatigue, and he was unable to rise again. His faithful dog crouched herself beside her faUen master, and the last sounds that the despairing otter-kriler heard, were the long and mournful howls with which Venom mourned over his calamity. Guided by the torch-Ught, we carried the rescued sufferer to a place of refuge. Every thing that kindness could suggest was done to effect his restoration ; and the old man owned it as a consolation, that he was saved from perishing in the desert ; and that, in death, he should have those around his bed, who, in hfe had possessed his love, fidelity, and veneration.

The Ulness of the old otter-killer has clouded our moorland excursions at their close, and we leave with melancholy forebodings our moun tain bivouac. Antony, at his own request, was carried to the Lodge to-day ; and when the difficulty of the ground, and the frequent crossing of the river is considered, it was an arduous undertaking. The camp - foUowers arranged a rude litter ; and as works of mercy are highly estimated by pious Catholics, there were more volunteers to assist in transporting the dying man than could weU find employment. practical experience, than I could have almost considered possible ; and I have ascertained how inadequate theory is to instruct a neophyte in the art. In angling, however, like other manly exercises, men are constituted by nature to succeed or faU. We know that there are persons who, though born in a preserve, could never shoot even tolerably, while others, with less advantages, speedUy become adepts. One man can never learn to ride ; and another, in a short time, can cross the country like \" a winged Mercury.\" The same rule holds good in angling; \u2014 A. in a short period becomes perfect master of the arcana of the gentle science ; whUe B. wiU thresh a river to eternity, dismissing flies, breaking tops, losing foot links, and perpetrating every enormity with which a tyro is chargeable. During our progress down, we had some hours' superior sport with the eagle. PuU garrow, triat inimitable hole, has more than realized what the Colonel and our ldnsman have said and sung in its commendation. In Christendom it could not be surpassed, and of this best of pools may be said, \" that none but itself can be its paraUel.\" Yet to a man naturaUy handy and observant, Uttle is'required to acquire the art, but a good stream and tolerable attention. He will soon gain more practical information and mechanical science than any book can inculcate. And it wiU be only when, by practice, he has acquired a knowledge of the science, that he will be able to comprehend what written theories pro fess to teach. In the minor streams we killed more red trout this morning than we do generaUy. In deed, from the character of this river, I have been puzzled to account for the evident scarcity of this Species in a water that appears so espe cially adapted for them. The clearness of the stream, the graveUy sod it flows over, its pools and rapids, aU seem calculated to produce red trout plentifully. But they are not numerous ; and as the flies we invariably use are formed for the other species, it is not surprising that we find but few red trout in the baskets. We had fished deep hole above the river, and our rods are, for the last time, handed to the attendants. And shall I never whUe my idle hours away beside that beautiful stream in the intervals of unfriendly sunshine, stretched beneath a bank, turning the light pages of a book, or watching in dreamy in dolence the rushing of a river ? Shall I no more watch the eddying of the pool, with its sparkling surface broken by the bold and glorious spring which marks the salmon rejoicing, like a returned prodigal, in his With this day's fishing our river sports ter minate. Rods and lines, and all the maUriel of the craft, will now be laid in ordinary, and tUl spring comes round again, other sports must occupy the idle hours.

No, my foot will never press that bank again ; nor shall I beside that glassy water enjoy those tranquillizing feehngs, which the slave of passion, the creature of society, can neither know nor estimate ! \u2014 and see, you are just in time, for the gig is on the water.\" As he spoke, he hailed the boat, which, returning to the beach, took me on board, and then puUed off for the vessel, which, in a quarter of an hour, we reached. We had scarcely left the river, when a man, who stood upon an eminence that commanded an extensive view seaward, gesticulated with great energy, and made, what appeared to me, some momentous communication in the mother tongue. It was, indeed, a bustling scene ; a hundred boats were collected round the smuggler, who, to use nautical parlance, had already \" broken bulk,\" and was discharging the cargo with a rapidity, and yet orderly and business-like system, that was surprising. \" It is the Jane I \" exclaimed my kinsman, as he bounded up the bank to gain the summit of the hillock. I did not comprehend exactly what the affair was which created such power ful emotions among my companions ; but when I reached the height, a scene of extreme interest was presented. I was immediately recognized by Captain Matthews, and politely invited to his cabin. Aware of the hurry consequent upon this dangerous traffic, on the plea of his -presence being requisite upon deck, I would have de clined the honour ; but the gal lant Captain remarked, with great indifference, \" that he left the dehvery of his cargo to the agents and purchasers, and could not spend an hour or two more to his satisfaction, than in entertain ing, in riis own way, the kinsman of his respected friend.\" And, caUing for the steward, he stepped forward to order some refreshments. Between the Black Rock and the island of Devilawn, a cutter was opening the bay, and standing from the westward under a press of canvass. She carried a spanking breeze in, and, as her course was too points off the wind, her sails drew, and she came up \" hand over hand.\" The approach was evidently expected, for from every nook and inlet row-boats were being launched \u2014 the whole population poured forth from the mountain villages \u2014 and the coast, as far as the eye could reach, was in marvellous commotion. Nothing could be more beautiful and picturesque than the appearance of the smuggler. The sunshine fell upon her snowy canvass, a private signal fluttered from the mast-head, and a union-jack was flying at the peak, whUe, occasionally, a sheet of broken foam sparkled round her bows, as she held her onward course gaUantly, While he was thus engaged, I had ample time to satisfy my curiosity, and observe the conduct of this illicit traffic. There appeared no confusion attendant on the delivery of the tobacco to its respective proprietors, who had already engaged certain proportions of the cargo, which they received upon the production ofsmaU tickets, specifying the quantity and description of the goods ; the business having been previously arranged on shore, before the arrival of the smuggler, faciritated trie danger ous trade. \" And walked the water like a thing of life.\" When I found myself in the cabin with the bold outlaw \u2014 for Matthews had been legaUy denounced for many daring and successful contests with the Revenue \u2014 I could not but admire the thorough indifference to possible consequences which this singular personage exhibited. He knew that several men-of-war were at that moment cruising on the station, and that they riad been apprised he had saUed from Flushing, and that this coast was the spot selected by the owners to effect the landing \u2014 yet he laughed and drank as gaUy as I should in a>club-house, and despatched the messages which were occasionally brought down with perfect nonchalance. He spoke principaUy of his own exploits ; and the scene was admirably in keeping. Around the cabin, muskets, pistols, and blunderbusses, were In a few minutes after her having been first discovered, boats were pulling from the shore in all directions, whde the cutter closed the land fast. When abreast the Ridge Point, she suddenly rounded-to, handed her gaff top saU, hauled up the main -tack, and waited for the boats. \" I cannot go on board,\" said my kinsman, with a heavy sigh, \" being, alas ! like Master Robert ShaUow, ' a poor esquire of this county, and one of the king's justices of the peace :' but though I shall not pay my personal respects, yet wiU not my old friend Jack Matthews forget me ; but you shaU board the Jane, and witness a bustling business. I'll promise you a hearty welcome from the Skipper"], [128, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 124 who appeared in desperate alarm ; and, at his own earnest solicitation, we received him and his personal effects, which were extremely limited, into our boat. The crew remained with the hooker, which they calculated upon floating off the foUowing tide. secured in arm-racks, and cutlasses and toma hawks were suspended from the bulk-heads. His had been a wild career ; and though not past the middle-age, his life teemed with \" perilous adventure.\" I was so much amused with his varied narratives of brave attempts and desperate successes, that the second hour slipped away before I rose and took my departure. On regaining the deck, the hurry of the business was over. The contraband cargo had been replaced by stone baUast ; for by previous arrangement, each boat brought a quantity of shingle from the beach, and hence the smuggler was already in trim, and ready to stand out to sea. I was much struck with the appearance of the stranger. His voice and bearing told that he was not indigenous to the soil : low in stature, delicate in form, with a timid and suspicious bearing, I was greatly puzzled to account for his being a passenger in a Conne- mara fishing-boat. Although nervous as a woman before we reached the pier, I had tranquiUized him so far as to find out generally that he had left the Galway coast in the expectation of being landed on the shores of Sligo ; but that the crew, having boarded the smuggler, managed to get gloriously drank, and, diverging totaUy from their course, ran the hooker on a reef, from which they should have been several leagues distant. This notorious vessel was considered in size and sailing superior to any of a similar class, and her voyages had been numerous and successful. Her armament was formidable ; sixteen heavy carronades were extended along the deck, with two long brass guns of smaller calibre, and every other appurtenance of war was in perfect efficiency. But the most striking object was her ferocious-looking, but magnificent crew ; they seemed only formed for \" the battle and the breeze ;\" and weU justified their commander's boast, \" that he could thrash any cruiser of his own size, and land his cargo in six hours afterwards.\" The stranger was an Englishman. He met from my kinsman a hospitable reception \u2014 and the Colonel and I united our attentions, and in a great degree restored his confidence. Nothing, however, could persuade him that the hooker had not been run designedly upon the rock, and that he and his travelling-bag would have been victimized by what he termed \"desperate pirates,\" but for our seasonable rescue. My cousin smUed. \" The conduct of the drunken scoundrels,\" he said, \" was unpardonable ; but he doubted whether they harboured those nefarious designs.

We left the vessel \u2014 and, to judge by the kegs and cases stowed away in the gig, my cousin had not been forgotten in the general distribution. The outlaw stood upon a car ronade, and waved his hand as we puUed from the ship's side ; and in a short time set his head-sails, and stood off to sea with the ebb tide and a spanking breeze, which carried him out of sight directly. This was fated to be the last landing of the Jane, and the last exploit of her commander ; she foundered on her next voyage, and every person on board perished with the vessel.* We had nearly reached the bar, when we observed a large sailing-boat strike on the tad of Carrig-a-boddagh, and as the tide was falling fast, she was in momentary danger of faUing over.

My mother's nonage was passed in St. Mary Axe, and my father was a dry salter in Tooley-street. He was the third of the same name that there had dwelt and prospered. They were a thrifty and punctilious race; and it was a family boast, that, for seventy years, a bill bearing the acceptance of Daniel Dawkins had never been in the hands of the notary. There is virtue in a good name, 'tis said, and theirs was current for ten thousand. \"Thus was I thrown upon the world at two-and-twenty, with thirty thousand pounds. Need I say, that I abjured business instanter, and that the honoured name of Dawkins dis appeared from the list of dry-salters ? For some years, none led a more peaceful and literary Use ; and though this may appear a solecism,' nevertheless it is positively true. The rejection of my early fugitives had chined the metrical outbreakings of my imagination. I had almost Cowper's sensibility \u2014 the lethalis arundo, as my Scotch tutor would term it, was deep within my bosom \u2014 I swore I would never lucubrate again : never again perpetrate a stanza ; and, like Mr. Daniel O'ConneU's, I presume that my vow was duly registered in heaven. \" I was only a chUd, and from the cradle evinced an indolent and dreamy temperature, which was ill-adapted to withstand the worry of trade, and aU the annoyances entaried on traffic. I hated trouble ; hardly knew the difference between pearl-ashes and pearl barley ; could never comprehend tare-and-trett, and had, moreover, literary propensities. How one in whose veins the blood of the Dawkinses circulated, could be so deplorably uncommercial, is a puzzle ; but I was, I suppose, ' foredoomed by my father's soul to cross,' and an unhappy tutor ruined me beyond recovery. \" My Gamaliel was a Scotch gentleman of unblemished lineage, remarkable for soUed linen and classical research, who had emigrated from a highland vaUey with an unpronounce able name, to hold a secondary situation in a city academy, where the progeny of Love-lane and Little Britain received the rudiments of polite letters. The extra hours of the gifted Celt were, for the consideration of ten pounds' annual fee, ' to be paid quarterly, and in advance,' devoted to my accomplishments. Never had man more profound contempt for trade and traders than he at whose feet I was indoctrin ated. He turned his nose up at the wealthiest grocer in the ward ; and was barely civil to a tobacconist who had a villa at PentonviUe, and was, moreover, first favourite for an aldermanic gown. Such delinquency could not be over looked, and for his heretical opinions touching commerce, he was eventually ejected from Tooley-street. But, alas ! the mischief was done \u2014 the seed was already sown \u2014 and, as after-experience proved, none of it had faUen upon the way-side. \" This sunny portion of my rife was, alas i but transitory. Mine, sir, is a tragic tale. I date the origin of my misfortunes on board a Margate steamer, and this melancholy epoch I shudder to recaU. Was there no tutelary sprite, no suspicious spinster, to whisper a cautionary advice ? No ; without a single fear I embarked in the Nereid steamer ; and, as the papers stated, ' left the Tower-stairs with a select party, and a band of music, on Friday, the \u2014 of June, 182 \u2014 .' \" I must here observe, that my blue-stocking aunt, who had actuaUy come out in LeadenhaU street with one smaU and admired volume, called 'Pedrilla, a Tale of Passion,' had been latterly urgent with me to enter into matri mony. ' Something told her,' she would say, ' that the name of Dawkins was not doomed to be forgotten, like that of Wood, and Birch, and Bagster.

I was no swain, and as AntigaUican in my dancing as Bob Acres. The old women admitted, that, though a good catch, I had no spirit ; the young ones ' ad mired the money, but disUked the man;' and as I did not form one of the coryphees, who were quadrriling upon the quarter-deck, I was likely enough to be left to meditative solitude. I assert \u2014 every thing. WiU any body deny that ' Drasilla O'Shaughnessey ' was not suffi cient to alarm any but a Shannonite ? Such was the appellative of the lady, whUe her honoured ldnsman favoured me with an em bossed card, on which was fairly engraven, ' Mr. Marc Antony Burke Bodkin, BaUybroney House.' \"On minor matters I will not dilate. It appeared that Miss DmsiUa O'Shaughnessey had come to London, in hopeless search after a legacy she expected in right of her great uncle, Field-Marshal O'Toole; and that the Field-Marshal's effects were undiscoverable ; and no avariable assets could be traced beyond certain old swords and battered snuff-boxes; and consequently Drasilla, who had been an heiress in expectancy, was sadly chagrined. Furthermore, it appeared that Mr. Marc An tony Bodkin formed her escort from Conne mara, and, being a 'loose gentleman,'* and a loving cousin, he ' bore her company.' \"But there was another person who appeared to hold no communion with the company. One lady seemed a stranger to the rest. Accident placed me beside her, and thus she became more intimately my compagnon de voyage. \" She was certainly a fine-looking woman ; her face was comely, but somewhat coarse ; her hair and brows black as the raven's plum age, her nose rather too marked for a woman's \u2014but then her waist and legs were unexcep tionable. She evidently possessed a sufficiency of self-command ; no mauvaise honte, no femi nine timidity oppressed her. She looked bravely around, as if she would assert a supe riority ; and accepted my civilities graciously, it is true, but with the air and dignity of a duchess. She was, from the start, no favourite with the company, and there was no incUnation evinced by any of her own sex to make ap proaches to familiarity. The cockney beaus looked upon her as a fine but formidable ani mal ; and to me, unworthy as I was, the honour of being cavalier serviente, was conceded with out a contest. Indeed, at dinner, my fair friend proved herself too edged a tool for civic wit to touch upon. When, with ultra-elegance, an auctioneer, whose assurance was undeniable, pressed ' the Hirish lady to teest a roast sole,' she obliterated the accomplished appraiser, by brusquely replying, ' that no earthly considera tion could induce her to eat horse flesh.' \"If ever the course of love ran smooth, which I sincerely disbelieve, mine was not the one. I shaU not attempt a description of the progress of my affaire du c\u0153ur ; for I suspect that I was the wooed one, and that DrusiUa had marked me for her own, and Marc Antony aided and abetted. He, good easy gentleman, was formed for Cupid's embassies. He ' could interpret between you and your love,' as Ham let says ; and to one with my sensibriities, his services were worth a Jew's eye. If woman ever possessed the cardinal virtues united, that person was DrusiUa. She was what Marc caUed ' the soul of honour,' yet she had her weak points, and he hinted darkly that myself had found favour in her sigrit. As a thing of course, I muttered a handsome acknowledge ment; a rejoinder was promptly returned, per same conveyance, as my father would have said \u2014 and before six days I was made the happiest of men, and levanted to Gretna with the lady of my love, and formaUy attended by that fidus Achates, Marc Antony Bodkin. \" And yet to this woman I was irresistibly attracted. I sate beside her on the deck, and I ministered to her coffee-cup ; and when the Nereid disembarked her crowd, and a stout, red-whiskered, do-no-good looking gentleman presented himself upon the chain-pier, and claimed his 'gentle cousin,' a pang of agony shot across my breast, and for the first time I felt the curse of jealousy. And yet, God knows, she was not the person from whom ' Uttle Popes ' might be expected ; her tender pledges would be better quaUfied for rangers and riflemen than denizens of the world of letters. But marriage is decreed elsewhere, and mine had been already booked. \" What a whirligig world this is !

But accident saved my life, though it annihUated my property. future bliss,' and my path of life, as I opined, strewed knee -deep with roses of perennial blossom. I heard voices in the summer-house \u2014 these were my loved one's and her relative's. To use his own parlance, the latter, in the joy of his heart, had taken a sufficiency of wine ' to smother a priest ; ' and as the conversation was interesting to the parties, and mine was not the stride of a warrior, my approach was not discovered by either. The conclave, how ever, had terminated, and though but the parting observation reached me, it is too faith fuUy chronicled on my memory to be forgotten \u2014 ' The devil is an ommadawn, no doubt ; but he has money, galore, and we'U make him do in Galway ! ' As he spoke they rose, and passed into the house without observing me. \"What the observation of Marc Antony meant, I could not for the life of me compre hend. Part of it was spoken, too, in an un known tongue. Was / the devil ? and what was an ommadawn ? Dark doubts crossed my mind ; but vanished, for DrusUla was more gracious than ever, and Marc Antony squeezed my hand at parting, and assured me, as well as he could articulate after six tumblers of hot Farintosh, ' that I was a lucky man, and DrusiUa a woman in ten thousand. ' \" Years before 1 led DrusUla to the altar, a Connemara estate, which had belonged to her progenitors, and had been rained in succession by the respective lords, was utterly demolished bya gentleman whom she termed her 'lamented father.' The property had been in Chancery for half a century, and advertised for sale be yond the memory of man ; but as it was over loaded with every species of encumbrance, no one in his senses would have accepted the fee simple as a gift. But my wife had determined that Castle Toole should be redeemed, and rise once more, Ph\u0153nix-like, from its embar rassments. It owed, she admitted, more than it was worth, twice told \u2014 but then, sure, it was the family property. There, for four cen turies, O'Tooleshad died, andO'Shaughnesseys been bom ; and if she could only persuade me to repurchase it with my wealth, she would be the first lady in the barony. To Marc Antony this project was enchanting. Ballybroney had been roofless for the last twenty years, that being about the period when the last of the \"dirty acres,\" which had once appertained to the mansion, had slipped from the singers of the Bodkins ; therefore, to establish himself at Castle Toole, would suit my kinsman to a hair. In short, the battery was unmasked ; and whether over-persuaded by the eloquence of my wife, the arguments of her cousin, or driven to desperation by a life of pleasure, I consented in due time; and having accompanied my honoured counsellors to Dublin, found no com petitor for Castle Toole \u2014 proposed for the same \u2014 paid a large sum of money, and was declared, by the legal functionaries, a gentle man of estate, and that too in Connemara. \"WeU, the knot was tied, and but for the eclat of the thing, the ceremony might have been as safely solemnized at Margate. On the lady's side, the property was strictly per sonal. Her claim upon the estates of the defunct Field-Marshal was never since estab lished, for the properties of that distinguised commander could never be localized. Marc Antony had been a borrower from the first hour of our intimacy ; and on the morning of her marriage, DrusiUa, I have reason to be- Ueve, was not mistress often pounds \u2014 but then she was a treasure in herself, and so swore Marc Antony. \" The private history of a honeymoon I leave to be narrated by those who have found that haven of bliss which I had pictured but never realized.

It had its capabilities, it is true ; the house being a ruin, might be repaired ; and as the lands were in their primeval state, it was possible to reclaim them. Still, when one looked at a huge dismantled building of that mixed class in architecture between a fortalice and a dwell ing-house, with grey-flagged roof, lofty chim neys, embattled parapets, and glassless windows, it was ill-calculated to encourage an Enghsh speculator in Irish estates. On every side a boundless expanse of barren moorland was visible, with an insulated portion of green surface on which the castle stood, and a few straggling trees remained from what had once been a noble oak wood. That some savage beauty did exist in the wild highlands, a fine river, and an extensive lake, is certain ; but to me, the scenery and the place were dreary and disheartening. In vain, therefore, did my friend Marc Antony dilate upon its advantages. The river boasted the best salmon fishing in the country \u2014 What was it to me, who had never angled for a gudgeon ? The mountains abounded with grouse \u2014 Who but a native could escalade them ? The bogs were cele brated for game \u2014 And would I devote myself like another Decius, to be engulfed, for all the wild ducks that ever wore a wing ? But then The Blazers were only a few miles distant, and their favourite fixture was on the estate. Really the proximity of that redoubted body produced a cold perspiration when I heard it. The Blazers ! the most sanguinary fox-club in Connaught \u2014 a gang who would literally devas tate the country, if it did not please Heaven to thin their numbers annuaUy by broken necks and accidents from pistol bullets. Yet, with me, the Rubicon was crossed \u2014 Castle Toole was mine with all its imperfections, and I determined to exert my philosophy to endure what it was impossible to undo. come visitors. But no sooner was the castle completed and the apartments reported habit able, than the country for fifty miles round complotted, as I verily believed, to inundate us with their company. A sort of satui nalia, called the house-warming, I thought destined to continue for ever ; and after having endured a purgatorial state for several weeks, and the tumult and vulgar dissipation had abated, swarms of relations to the third and fourth generation of those that loved us, kept dropping in, in what they termed the quiet friendly way, untU ' the good house Money-glass'* was outstripped in hospitality by my devoted mansion. Although ten long miles from a post-town, we were never secure from an inroad. Men who bore the most remote affinity to the families of O'Shaugh nessey or O'Toole, deserted the comers of the earth to spoliate the larder ; and persons who, during the course of their natural lives, had never before touched fishing-rod or fowling piece, now borrowed them ' for the nonce,' and deemed it a good and sufficient apology for living on me for a fortnight. Pedlars abandoned their accustomed routes ; friars diverged a score of miles to take us on ' the mission ; ' pipers infested the premises ; and even deserters honoured me with a passing call, 'for the house had such a name.' All and every calculated on that cursed ceade fealteagk. An eternal stream of the idle and dissipated filled the house \u2014 the kitchen fire, like the flame of Vesta, was never permitted to subside \u2014 and a host of locusts devoured my property. I lived and submitted, and yet had the consolation to know fhat I was the most unpopular being in the province. I was usually described as a ' dry devil, or a ' dark,\\ dirty Uttle man;' while upon Drasilla blessings rained, and she was admitted to be ' the best sowl that ever laid leg below mahogany !

I foolishly hoped that, considering the locaUty of Castle Toole, my locusts would banish with the butterflies ; but the only difference a rainy day made was, that the visitor who arrived, never dreamed of departing till the morrow, and the numbers by no means abated. Some heavy biUs came in, and I seized that opportu- nity of remonstrating with DrusiUa. I told her my health was breaking, my fortune unequal to my expenses; that common prudence required a certain limitation to our irregular hospitahty ; hinted that, though an occasional visit from Mr. Marc Antony Bodkin would be agreeable, yet that an everlasting abode would rather be a bore. I would have continued, but my lady had listened, she thought, too long already. She fired at the very idea of retrenchment ; and as to Mr. Marc Antony Bodkin, we were, it appeared, too much honoured by his society. He, a third cousin of Clanricarde, condescended to take my place, and entertain my company. He rode my horses and drank my wine, neither of which feats, as she opined, nature had designed me for doing in proper person ; in short, by Herculean efforts on his part, he enabled me to hold my place among gentlemen. As to the paltry consideration of his residence, what was it ? ' God be with the time, when,' as her ' lamented father ' said, ' a stranger remained for eighteen months in Castle Toole, and would probably have Uved and died there, but that his wife discovered him, and forced the truant to abdicate ; and yet,' she added, proudly, ' none could teU whether he was from Wales or EnniskUlen ; and some beUeved his name was Hamerton, while others asserted it was Macintosh. But,' as she concluded, ' when her kinsman Mr. Bodkin was turned out, it was time for her to provide a residence, ' and she flung from the room like a Bacchante, making door and window shiver. \" Of course, from that moment any contra- diction would have been death to my dear DrusiUa. She never reigned lady-paramount tUl now, and her will was absolute. Relatives trooped down in scores, and Mark Antony was doubly cherished. Notwithstanding my nerves thriUed at their arrival, the Blazers were honourably feasted ; and, at the especial request of Mrs. Dawkins, on that occasion I determined to make a character. I really was half a hero ; presided at the head of my own table like its master, gave divers bumper toasts, and sat out the evening, until I was fairly hors de combat, and tumbled from the chair. Drank as I was, I recoUected clearly aU that passed. As but a couple of bottles a man had been then discussed, my early faU appeared to create a sensation. 'Is it a fit he has ?' inquired an under-sized gentleman with an efflorescent nose, who had been pointed out to me as a six-bottle customer. ' Prioo !' replied my loving cousin, ' the man has no more bottom than a chicken. Lift him ; he has a good heart, but a weak head, He'll never do for Galway ! But, come, lads,' and Marc hoppedovermybody, as I was beingtaken up by the servants, ' I'll give you that top-sawyer, his wife, and long may she wear the breeches!' It was gratifying to find that the toast was generaUy admired, for the very attendants that ' bore the corpse along,' stopped at the door, and shouted ' hip, hip, hurra !' from the stair case. \" Every day from this period I became more unhappy and contemptible. My blue-stocking aunt, who, for reasons unnecessary to explain, had been since my marriage totally estranged, was now officiaUy informed that the name of Dawkins would be continued. She had the true leaven of famUy affection in her, and my past neglect was pardoned, and the kindest letter returned to my communication. One passage of her epistle ran thus \u2014 ' Though I felt acutely at your selecting a wife without even consulting one, of whose attachment you must be well convinced, I forgive aU, from the personal description you give of your consort. May the heir of our line be like his mother, is my prayer !

One day, at the head of a hundred paupers, she was planting trees ; the next, with Marc Antony Bodkin, making a radical reform in the stables. On these occa sions, arrayed in a man's hat, with her limbs cased in Hessian boots, she looked, as Tom the DevU said, ' blasted knowing.' I occasionaUy was permitted to attend, as a sort of travelling conveniency to hang her cloak upon ; and I never returned without some indignity from strangers, or personal disrespect from herself.

From time immemorial, my lawn was the chosen fix ture for determining affairs of honour ; and hence, more blood had been shed there than on any simriar spot in Christendom. If the civU authorities were so ungentlemanly as to interrupt the combatants, the latter merely crossed the adjacent bridge, and finished the affair to their satisfaction.

Hence, not a week elapsed but my nerves were tortured by the arrival of a shooting-party, and probably further agonized by hearing Mr. Bodkin hallooing to the butler, ' Michael, (sotto voce) devil speed ye, Michael! the mistress desires ye to keep back dinner till the gentlemen have done, and to present her com pliments, and say, that she expects the com pany ofthe survivor.' we never boasted fewer than a couple on the sick-hst.

After a short pause, he thus continued : \" The day the most eventful of my life, if my wedding one be excepted, at last arrived, and had it been nominated for my undergoing the extreme penalty of the law, it could not have brought more horror with it.

That, under circum stances, it should have reached me, appeared miraculous, and, seizing an opportunity, I examined its contents in private. My kind relation had received my detad of misery, and, in reply, she implored me to abandon the scene of my degradation, and share her fortune, which was more, she said, than sufficient for us both. My heart beat with conflicting emotions \u2014 aU unworthy as she was, I could not bring myself to abandon DrusiUa thus. I actuaUy hesitated, when curiosity prompted me to peruse a letter which was addressed to her, and marked im mediate.

Poor Antony's simple rife riad few dark recoUections to harrow his parting hour. His shrift was short and satisfactory, and, at his own request, when the rites of the Roman Cathoric Church had been duly cele brated, my cousin and myself were summoned to his bedside. The ancient retainer of an Irish family gene raUy establishes a bond upon the affections of the wild household that causes his loss to make a greater sensation than so humble an event might be supposed to occasion. Antony for half a century had been attached to this family. Three generations have passed since he first settled beneath the roof-tree, and he has been associated with every earlier recoUec tion of the present master. No wonder I found my kinsman in considerable distress. The old man was dying \u2014 and youthful scenes and youthful days, when the stormier passions The old man was supported by Hennessey, as a difficulty in breathing obliged him to be raised up ; and the scene was at once simple and imposing.

His faithful terrier sat at the bed-foot, and the fixed and melancholy look that the poor animal turned on her dying master would have half persuaded me that Venom knew she was about to lose him. Dim as his eye was, it lighted as my kinsman's tall figure darkened the entrance of the chamber, and feebly put ting forth his hand, he clasped that of his beloved master with affection, and, while weakness and imperfect breathing sadly inter rupted his \" last fareweU,\" we could with some difficulty thus collect his words. There was a loud and agonising burst of sorrow when the otter-kiUer's death was com municated to those in the haU and kitchen, who, during the closing scene, had been with difficulty prevented from crowding the apart ment of the sufferer. But this noisy demon stration of regard was speedily checked by old John, who knew that his master would be doubly displeased should any tumultuary waU ings render me uncomfortable. In a short time order was tolerably esta blished, and, with one exception, a quiet and respectful sUence supervened. A stout though aged crone occasionally burst into wild lament, accompanied by a beating on her breast, which, like the signal to a chorus, elicited a fresh ebullition from the subordinate mourners. John, however, interposed his authority effec tually.\u2014\" Badahust, hanamondioul, badahust, I say ! ye may keinagh at the funeral, but ye mustn't disturb the master and the company.\" This jobation restored tranquillity, aud in \"decent grief\" the otter-kiUer's corpse was duly laid out in its funeral habUiments. \" I'm going, Master Julius, and may the blessing of the Almighty attend ye !

My cousin was really affected, and the Priest, perceiving the increasing feebleness of the otter-killer, re- quested us to retire. We were obeying when Antony raUied suddenly and unexpectedly. \" You will mind the dog for my sake, Master Julius, and ye'll let trap and fishing-rod hang up in the hall to put ye in mind of old Antony ? \" These were his last connected words. His strength sailed fast ; his memory wandered to other times; \"he babbled of green fields ; \" he murmured the names of lakes and rivers, and, while the affectionate Priest prayed fervently beside his old and innocent companion, the otter-kiUer rendered his last sigh in the arms of Hennessey and the weeping Alice ! The evening wore on heavily \u2014 my kinsman was sensibly affected : his old monitor in the gentle art was gone, and, though fuU of years and ripe for the tomb, his master felt that \" he could have better spared a better man.\" There was heart-sinking about our party which I had never marked before. The wine had lost its charm, and whUe the Colonel and the Priest commenced a game of piquet, my cousin ordered the gig, and proposed that we should puU over to the herring boats, which, in the next estuary and on the preceding night, had been unusually successful. Accordingly, hav ing righted our pipes and procured our boat cloaks, we left the pier-head in the four-oared galley. The night was unusually dark and warm ; not a breath of wind was on the water. The noise of the oars springing in the coppered ruUocks was heard for a mUe off, and the whistle of sandpipers and jack curlews, as they took wing from the beach we skirted, appeared unusually shrill. Other noises gra dually broke the stillness of the night \u2014 the varied hum of numerous voices chanting the melancholy songs which are the especial favourites of the Irish began to be heard dis tinctly, and we soon bore down upon the mid night fishers, directed by sound, not sight. To approach the fleet was a task of some difficulty. The nets, extended in interminable Unes, were so frequent that much skill was Talk of parade around the couch of fortune, and what a heartless display is it ! / saw a rich man die ; I saw the hollow mockery of hireling attendants and interested friends ; but here that simple unsophisticated being had a sincerity of grief bestowed upon his death bed that to wealth and grandeur would be unattainable !"], [141, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 137 necessary to penetrate this hempen labyrinth without fouling the back ropes. Warning cries directed our course, and with some delay we threaded the crowded surface, and, guided by buoys and puckawns, found ourselves in the very centre of the flotilla. The tide was flowing fast, and having stepped the mast, we spread our large lug, and the light galley slipped speedily ashore. A sire which I had noticed above the Lodge kindling gradually, fanned by the rising night breeze, sprang at once into a glorious flame, and through the darkness its intense light must have been for many leagues discernible. I broke my cousin's musing to ask what it was. It was an interesting scene. Momently the boats glided along the back ropes, which were supported at short intervals by corks, and at a grater by inflated dogskins, and, raising the curtain of network which these suspended, the -herrings were removed from the meshes and deposited in the boats. Some of the nets were particularly fortunate, obliging their pro prietors to frequently reUeve them of the fish, while others, though apparently stretched within a few yards, and consequently in the immediate run of the herrings, were favoured but with a few stragglers ; and the indolent fisherman had to occupy himself with a sor rowful ditty, or in moody sUence watched the dark sea \" like some dull ghost waiting on Styx for wastage.\" \" That, my friend, is one of our ancient customs \u2014 that is our beal-fire. It is lighted to notify that a death has occurred, and ere long you will see it answered by some of our friends and kindred. Poor old man ! none deserved it better, for he would have attended religiously to such observances had any of my family preceded him to the grave. He lighted my father's beal-fire, and possibly kindled that of my grandsire ; old John has probably performed the ceremony for him. Thus the kindlier offices are continued, and ' thus runs the word away.' \u2014 Who \u2014 \" and he stopped, evidently embarrassed at some passing thought \u2014 \"Who shaU say that the ceremonial be stowed upon the wandering otter-killer may not be refused to the last descendant of a line of centuries ?\" Our visit appeared highly satisfactory, for the ceade fealteagh, with a lament for \" ould Antony,\" was universal, while every boat tossed herrings on board until we were obliged to refuse further largesse; and these many \" trifles of fish \" accumulated so rapidly that we eventually declined receiving further com pliments, or we might have loaded the gig gunnel deep. I would have interrupted these melancholy forebodings, but just then, from the lofty brow of an inland hiU, which I had frequently ob served before, a light appeared, first faintly struggling, but presently reddening to the sight ; and two fires in Achil, in a time of incredible briefness, flung their deep glow across the waters, and, as I afterwards re marked, were repeated for miles along the coast and high grounds. The darkness of the night increased the scaly brriliancy which the phosphoric proper ties of these beautiful fish produce. The bottom of the boat, now covered with some thousand herrings, glowed with a living light, which the imagination could not create and the pencil never imitate. The shades of gold and silvery gems were rich beyond description, and much as I had heard of phosphoric splen dour before, every idea I had formed fell infinitely short of its reality. The rapidity with which the beal-fire was replied to evidently pleased my kinsman's famUy vanity; and with higher spirits we watched the lights tremble in the windows of the Lodge, untU these stell\u00e6 minores directed our voyage to its termination. The same care with which we entered disem barrassed us of the midnight fishing. Every boat we passed pressed hard to throw in a \"cast of skuddawns* for the strange gentleman,\" meaning me ; and such was the kindness of these hospitable creatures, that had I been a very Behemoth I should have this night feasted to satiety on their bounty. The Colonel and his companion were wait ing for us on the pier ; they insisted on adding to our supper some of the fish which we had brought home, and while this was being done, my cousin and myself entered the wake, to pay our last duties to the departed otter-killer. To give additional eclat to his funeral rites, the corpse had been removed to the bam, which, from its unusual size, was well-fitted to admit the numerous mourners who would attend the ceremony. Upon a rude bier the old man rested, and the trap and fishing-rod The wind, which had been asleep, began now to sigh over the surface, and before we had cleared the outer back-ropes, the sea breeze came curling \" the midnight wave.\" * Anglice, Herrings."], [142, "138 WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. were, by a fancy of Hennessey, placed above his head. The barn was fiUed, but immediate room was made for the master and his com pany. I have seen the corpse when carefully arranged,; when the coUapsing features were artificiaUy moulded, to imitate a tranquiUity that had been foreign to the last event. But here was a study for a painter. The old man's face was puckered into the same conscious smile with which I have heard him terminate his happiest otter hunt, or some mountain exploit of my kinsman, which appeared to him equaUy dear. His long hair, released from the band with which he usuaUy confined it, wantoned in sUvery ringlets across his neck and shoulders. All else was in wonted form, only that the number of candles round the bier might have been called extravagant, and the plate of snuff upon the bosom of the corpse was heaped with a munificence that would stamp the obse quies as splendid. santry were seen afloat, and when the funeral left the house more than a hundred boats accompanied that in which the corpse was deposited. My kinsman foUowed next to the body with aU his visitors and servants, and when the opposite strand was reached, he and his foster-brother placed their shoulders under the coffin, and supported it for a short distance along the beach. This was, I was afterwards informed, the highest honour that could be conferred upon the departed by his master, and even the mag nificence of the otter-kiUer's wake was held inferior to this proud and pubUc testimony of his patron's affections. One circumstance was remarked which was powerfuUy indicative of animal affection. The dead man's terrier had remained night and day beside his bier since the morning of his death- Unnoticed, she crept on board the boat that conveyed the coffin to the churchyard ; and when the grave was filled she was with diffi culty carried home by an attendant, but escaping during the night, crossed the estuary by swim ming, and again lay down upon the turf, be neath which her beloved master was sleeping. Every care and kindness was bestowed upon her in the Lodge. No one addressed her but as \"poor Venney.\" Notwithstanding, she drooped visibly, and in three weeks after his interment, in death the otter-killer's favourite \" bore him company.\" Everybody has heard an Irish wake de scribed, and there is no dissimilarity among a hundred, only that, according to the opulence of the family and the quantity of funeral refreshments, the mirth and joUity of the \u25a0mourners is invariably proportionate. That the master's ancient retainers should be nobly Waked was fuUy expected by the country, and certainly they were not disappointed. Whisky in quantities passing aU under standing, tobacco in aU its preparations, were fearfully consumed on this important ceremony, and during the two days and nights which the otter-killer was above ground the bam, spacious as it was, proved unequal to accommodate the hundreds who flocked from a distance of even twenty miles to have \"a last look at ould Antony.\" When we reached the Lodge, we made a discovery which, possibly with some people, might lead to an opposite conclusion, and either prove the security or insecurity of the country. Not a living being had remained within the walls, and consequently, for several hours, the house and household goods were abandoned to the mercy of chance and chance travellers. The guardian saint, however, acquitted herself like a gentlewoman. We found everything in pious order ; and had the Lodge been under the especial care of the glorious Santa Barbara herself, watch and ward could not have been more faithfully maintained. When the evening feU on which the corpse was to be carried to its resting-place, a scene of great novelty and great interest ensued. From the insulated position of the Lodge, in connection with the burying-ground, it was necessary that the body should be carried across the estuary by water.

A month had passed : winter comes on with giant strides, and the last lingering recoUections of autumn are over. The weather becomes more rainy and tempestuous ; and bogs, which we once crossed easily, owing to the continued wet, are now quite impassable. The sweU, which during the summer months came in in long and measured undulations, breaks in masses across the bar, and sends a broken and tumbling sea inside the estuary, so as to render it unsafe to expose any boat of heavy tonnage to its influence. Pattigo seldom ventures from his anchorage, and when last he ventured to pass a night at the pier, he ground away a hawser against trie stones, notwith standing every pains were bestowed in renew ing its service. The springs are usuaUy high ; and two nights since, the Lodge and paddocks were completely insulated, and our communi cation with the mainland carried on by ferriage. The river rises fearfuUy, and the huge masses of turf left along the strand, prove how violent the mountain torrents must be at this advanced season. The sweet and crystal stream is nowhere seen ; and Scott's beautiful lines happdy describe the turbid river that has replaced it : \u2014 banks apprises us of the first appearance of a Crowour Keough* This is the earliest wood- cock announced, but my kinsman has no doubt but the flights has faUen in AchU : and we shaU cross in a few days, if the weather answers, and try Slieve More, he says, with exceUent success. I had been some hours in bed, when I was awakened by a quarrelling among the dogs, which I overheard the keeper settling with the whip. I remained, and it is rather an unusual thing with me, a long time awake. An hour passed, aU was again in deep repose, and I too was sinking into sleep, when a strange and unaccountable noise roused me. It seemed to be at first faint and distant, but momently in creasing, grew louder and more distinct, untd it passed to aU appearance directly above my bead. The sounds were wUd and musical \u2014 varied in tone beyond anything I could de scribe, and continuing, untU they graduaUy became remote and indistinct, and at length totaUy died away. I was amazingly puzzled, but was obliged to reserve my curiosity to be satisfied in the morning. from the tip to the corners of the mouth, is scarcely an inch and a half long, black, and crossed with a pale reddish streak on each side ; a narrow black line passes from the bill to the eyes, the irides of which are brown ; the head is small, and as far as the crown, together with the cheeks and throat, white ; the rest of the head and neck, to the breast and shoulders, is black. The upper part of the plumage is pret tily marbled or barred with blue gray, black, and white ; the feathers of the back are black, edged with white, and those of the wing coverts and scapulars blue grey bordered with black near the margins, and edged with white; the quills black, edged a little way from the tips with blue grey; the under parts and tail coverts, white ; the thighs are marked with dusky lines or spots, and are black near the knees ; the tail is black, and five inches and a half long ; the legs and feet are dusky, very thick and short, and have a stumpy appearance. * Why this title, literally meaning \" the blind cock,\" should be conferred by the peasantry of Ballycroy on a bird so remarkable for the extraordinary quickness of his vision, is a parodox. Such is the known acuteness of the woodcock'svision, that the cover-shooter chooses a masked position, or the Crowour Keough would seldom come within range of the gun. f Flight is the term used to describe a flock of woodcocks, as they arrive in this country, in their annual migration from the north of Europe. ' ' Late, gazing down the steepy linn That hems our little garden in, Low in its dark and narrow glen You scarce the rivulet might ken, So thick the tangled greenwood grew, So feebly trill'd the streamlet through ; Now, murmuring hoarse, and frequent seen, Through bush and briar no longer green, An angry brook it sweeps the glade, Brawls over rock and wild cascade.\" But other, and no less certain, tokens har binger the wUd season that has arrived. Yesterday a six-months' puppy, who crept after me across the adjoining paddocks, stopped in a rushy field. Suspecting that he had a hare before him, I passed on to push her from the form -. I was mistaken \u2014 a wisp* of snipes, possibly thirty in number, sprang, and scatter ing in aU directions, pitched loosely over the adjoining bogs. To-day I saw a flock of barnacles ;t and the herdsman on the sand- * Wisp, in sporting parlance, means a flock of snipes. j- The barnacle weighs about five pounds, and measures more than two feet in length, and nearly four and a half in breadth. The bill,"], [144, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 140 My cousin smiled at my inquiry : \u2014 \" And you heard those strange noises as weU as I ? This, if you remained here, would be Uttle marvel, as nightly the Barnacle cross the Lodge in passing from one estuary to the other. There they sit in yonder point ;\" \u2014 and taking me to the window, I saw a considerable extent of sand literaUy black with this migratory tribe : they come here in immense multitudes, but from their coarse and fishy flavour, afford little occupation to the water-shooter. ing. For mUes I have traced their night feed ings along a river bank, where the marshy surface afforded them their favourite suste nance. Triey are far more wary than the barnacle, and are extremely difficult of access in moderate weather ; but chance and storm occasionaUy favour the sportsman, and in spite of the caution of these birds, the flock will be surprised, and the patient gunner reap in a lucky moment the reward of many a weary vigil and bootless attempt. The last and greatest of the wUd visitors are the swan tribe. Their being scarce or plentiful depends much upon the season \u2014 and in winters of extreme severity thousands of these birds will be found upon the estuaries and inland lakes. The noise they make is wild and musical, and with a little fancy, my kinsman says, the ear will trace modulations almost extending to infinity. These birds, during severe frosts and snow-storms, are easUy surprised and shot ; and the skins, when care fuUy stripped off, will weU repay the shooter for his trouble. The land barnacles are less numerous, although they are found in tolerable abund ance. During the day I saw two flocks, of one or two hundred pairs, upon the bogs. They are, when sufficiently rested from their journey, sought for with great avidity by the few gunners in this district, and are very delicious when kept a sufficient time after being shot, before the cook transfers them to the spit. Gray plover must also migrate in thousands hither. Nothing else could account for the immense flocks that have been seen, and wiU continue, as I am informed, to arrive. The shores and moors are everywhere crowded with them ; and within a hundred yards of the lodge, Hennessey, with two barrels, kUled seven couple and a half last evening. The bent-banks are their favourite fixture : and I have never crossed them of late without finding at least one stand. These vary in numbers ; but I am certain I have seen three hundred of these birds thus congregated. To enumerate the varieties of the duck tribe that an inclement winter brings to these shores would be difficult. I have already noticed the Pintail, and the Golden-eye upon the estuary. Widgeons come here in immense flocks ; and that beautiful bird the teal, the smaUest and most delicate of the whole species, is found for the remainder of the season on loughs and rivers in abundance. The Grebe and Tringa tribes furnish numerous and interesting varie ties ; and an ornithologist, as weU as a sports man, would have here an ample field, could he but set the season at defiance, and pass his winter on this exposed and stormy coast. There is, in shooting plover, a common remark made by sportsmen, that the second is always the more productive barrel. The rapidity with which they vary their position when on the ground, seldom admits of a grand combination for sitting, or rather a running shot. But when on the wing, their mode of flight is most favourable for permitting the shot to tell ; and it is by no means unusual to bring down a number. When disturbed, they frequently wheel back directly above the fowler, and offer a tempting mark if he should have a barrel in reserve ; and even when too high for a shot to take effect, I have often thrown away a random fire ; for the plover, on hearing the report, directly make a sweep downward on the wing, and I have by this means brought them within range of the second barrel. ' But the note of dissolution of our happy party has sounded. The Colonel, having divers premonitory twinges, has named an early day for his departure. To be caught by the gout is by night, and particularly during moonlight. I have never known them either netted or decoyed ; and all the shooter has to rely upon is patience and a long barrel. Of all the prizes that the wildfowl-shooter could wish to meet with, a flock osteal is the very first. Independ ently of their being by far the best birds of the whole Anas tribe, they are so much easier of access, and require such a slight blow, that no matter whether you are prepared for wildfowl, partridges, or snipes, you may, at most times, with very little trouble, contrive to get near them ; and this being once done, you have only to shoot straight to be pretty sure of killing. I have seen teal \" duck the flash,\" though never but once, and then I had rather a slow shooting-gun. When the season advances, the number of geese* that visit this wUd peninsula is astonish- * The time that wild geese feed in this country"], [145, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 141 here, would be a hazardous experiment ; and the portmanteau, whose captivity was likely to occasion such desperate results, is again packed and confided to Andy Bawn. But the commander's baggage is not to be ex posed to a second interruption. The attempt was fatal to Mr. Burke ; for, emboldened by the feud which his unadvised aggression created between my kinsman and his modern Cacus, the Sweenies* seized the opportunity, and the outlaw was arrested in a whisky-house, tried, and escaped by a miracle from being hanged, \u2014 but was, alas ! consigned to Australasia for the course of his natural life. morrow, wUl be a saw from old John about \" the dog that bit me,\" and the mercUess badinage of that black-eyed coquette who embodies aU that Moore idealized in sketching his Nora Crina. How soft the evening twilight falls on the waters of the estuary ! the tide kisses the very verge of the greensward, and looks so treach erously calm, as if its storms were for ever ended.

Finding aU chance of com muted punishment over, he endeavoured to obtain his liberty by an ingenious plan to strangle the turnkeys, and emancipate aU and every victim of judicial tyranny who pleased to accept his freedom.

The Colonel has left us, and we lose in him the best and safest of friends- \u2014 a true buon camarado. With spirits of youthful buoyancy, a temper unsoured by time, and indifferent to worldly annoyances, years have only mellowed his companionable qualities, while they added deeply to his anecdote and information. Few men of a certain age succeed in retaining their places as first favourites with others some quarter of a century their juniors ; but the Colonel is an exception : we shaU feel a blank in our society ; and in this gay and careless spirit lose a dear companion, who seemed to put time at defiance, and forbade gout itself to interrupt his comfort, or \" mar his tran quillity.\" The last two days have been dry, the wind is favourable, a white frost has been visible this morning, and we are about to pay our parting visit to Achil. We have again sent to our ancient entertainers, the Water Guards, to beg a shelter for the night ; for the days have so sensibly shortened, lhat we shall have enough to do to reach Dugurth at nightfall. * This numerous clan derive their origin from a northman. They are, I know not with what justice, reckoned a treacherous and vindictive tribe, and a feud with them is consequently held to be a dangerous affair. \" Merrily, merrily bounds the bark,\" and an hour landed us at the Ridge Point.

Independently of a quantity of detached birds, several wisps sprang wridly, as they always do ; and I have no doubt that this fen had been their tem porary resting-place after their autumnal mi gration from the north. We were the more inclined to this opinion, from finding many of the birds we killed extremely lean ; while others, that sprang singly, were in admirable condition. AchUis a natural resting-place for migratory birds : and hence I can well believe the accounts given by the islanders, and of the immense numbers of woodcocks and snipes which are here found, in their transit from a high latitude to our more genial climate. The same remark is made touching the vernal visit of these strangers to this island. After wood cocks have for days vanished from the inland covers, they have been found in flocks on the AchU and Erris highlands, evidently congre gating for their passage, and preparing'for the attempt. I have seen much of snipe-shooting* in many parts of Ireland, but I could not have * The common residence of the snipe is in small bogs, or wet grounds, where it is almost constantly digging and nibbling in the soft mud, in search of his food, which consists chiefly of a very small kind of red transparent worm, about an half inch long ; it is said also to eat slugs, and the insects and grubs, of various kinds, which breed in great abundance in those slimy stagnant places. In these retreats, when undis turbed, the snipe walks leisurely with its head erect, and at short intervals keeps moving the tail. But in this state of tranquillity it is very rarely to be seen, as it is extremely watchful, and perceives the sportsman or his dog at a great distance, and instantly conceals itself among the variegated withered herbage so similar in appearance to its own plumage, that it is almost impossible to discover it whifo squatted motionless in its seat ; it seldom, how ever, waits the near approach of any person, particularly in open weather, but commonly springs and takes flight at a distance beyond the reach of the gun. When first disturbed, it utters a kind of feeble whistle, and gently flies against the wind, turning nimbly in a zigzag direction for two or three hundred paces, and sometimes soaring almost out of sight ; its note is then something like the bleating of a goat, but is changed to a singular humming or drumming noise, uttered in its descent, From its vigilance and manner of flying, it is one of the most difficult birds to shoot. Some sportsmen can imitate their cries, and by that means draw them within reach of their shot ; others of a less honourable description, prefer the more certain and less laborious method of catching them in the night by a springe, like that which is used for the woodcock. It may be easUy conceived, that whether the winter stock of snipes and woodcocks be limited or abundant, will mainly depend upon the state of the winds and weather at the period of migration. Hence, when the latter end of October and the succeeding month have continued stormy, with south or south-easterly gales, a lamentable deficiency of game has been invariably observed. That multitudes perish on their passage, or are obliged to change their course, is certain \u2014 and the exhausted state in which the small portion of the survivors reach these shores, attests how difficult the task must be to effect a landing, when opposed by contrary winds or stormy weather. The snipe is migratory, and is met with in aU countries ; like the woodcock, it shuns the extremes of heat and cold by keeping upon the bleak moors in summer, and seeking the shelter of the valleys in winter. In severe frosts and storms of snow, driven by extremity of the weather, snipes seek the unfrozen boggy places, runners from springs, or any open streamlet of water, and they are sure to be found, often in considerable numbers in these places, where they sometimes sit till nearly trodden upon before they will take their flight. Although it is well known that numbers of snipes leave Great Britain in the spring, and return in the autumn, yet it is equally well ascertained that many constantly remain, and breed in various parts of the country, for their nests and young ones have been so often found as to leave no doubt of this fact. The female makes her nest in the most retired and inacces sible part of the morass, generally upon the stump of an alder or willow ; it is composed of withered grass and a few feathers ; her eggs, four or five in number, are of an oblong shape, and of a greenish colour, with rusty soots ; the young ones run off soon after they are freed from the shell, but they are attended by the We crossed the bent-banks, occasionally knocking a rabbit over as we went along, and wheeled to the westward to skirt the base of Slieve More. We had not proceeded far, before an islander, who was herding cows, told us that there was a crowour keough beg * in the next ravine. We accordingly put a setter parent birds until their bills have acquired a sufficient firmness to enable them to provide for themselves. The snipe is a very fat bird, but its fat does not cloy, and very rarely disagrees even with the weakest stomach. It is much esteemed as a delicious and well-flavoured dish, and is cooked in the same manner as the woodcock. * A little woodcock."], [147, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 143 in, and were gratified with a steady point in the place the herdsman had intimated. The bird sprang, and was knocked over by my com panion, when the little woodcock proved to be a double snipe. These birds are extremely scarce here, and a few couple only are seen during a whole season by persons most con versant in traversing the bogs. There cannot be a doubt but this bird is a distinct species ; but for its extreme rarity and solitary habits naturalists are puzzled to account. faUs, every woodcock for nules around deserts the heath and seeks the nearest shelter. There will the sportsman be amply repaid for all his labour. From a copse of not more than thirty acres extent, I have seen fifty couple of wood cocks flushed ; and as several exceUent covers lay in the immediate vicinity, it was no unusual thing for two or three guns to bring home twenty, nay, thirty couple. I have known a party fire a number of shots that appeared incredible ; and I have more than once ex pended my last charge of powder, and left, for want of ammunition, one or more copses untried. We shot, before we began to ascend the hill, a couple of woodcocks lying out upon the moors. They were very shy, never allowing the dogs to come to a set. This is usually the case when these birds are outlying ; and I have foUowed a cock for mUes before I got him within fire, teased by his getting up before I could approach, and removing some hundred yards from the gun. Some favourable in equality of surface has at last enabled me to close with my wUd quarry, and, notwithstand ing the keenness of his eye, got the wary stranger eventually within range of shot. The best cock-shooting cannot be had with out a good deal of fag. Like fox-hunting, it is work for hardy spirits ; and non sine pulvere palma, will apply to both. To reach a moun tain-cover, the sportsman must be on the alert two or three hours before dayhght, for he has likely some ten Irish mUes to ride or drive over by a rough and dangerous road, now rendered scarcely discernible from the adjacent bogs, and hardly passable from the snow-drifts. The short day is hardly sufficient for shooting the different woods ; and then the same dis tance must be again traversed, for which the shooter wUl be a borrower from the night. Then he must reckon on divers delays and sundry accidents ; horses wiU come down, dog carts capsize, a trace break, of a spring faU ; and what has annoyed me more than aU to gether, probably a fog rise so suddenly and densely, as to render the road undistinguish able from the surrounding heaths. But when aU this is achieved, \u2014 when a cover-party have fairly encircled the table, after the luxury of a complete toilet, \u2014 when the fire sparkles, the curtains are drawn, and the wine circulates, \u2014 why then, without let the storm blow till it bursts its cheeks \u2014 and within, Father Care may hang himself in his own garters. There grows in the valleys and water-courses which are so frequent in the Achil and Bally croy hUls, that large and shrub-Uke heather that reaches nearly to the height of brushwood. Here, in the earlier season, the woodcocks repose after their passage, and at times the numbers found in these ravines are stated to be extraordinary. With the first frost or snow they move off into the interior, dropping as they go along in the different covers, until a part of the flight reaches the very centre of the kingdom. We met, during our day's fag, about fifteen couple, out of wriich eight and a half were brought to bag. To these we added three brace and a half of grouse and a brace of hares. When with these were united snipes, plovers, and rabbits, it is not too much to say that our bags are most imposing, and produced above fifty head of game. From our kind friends, the Water Guards, we received a hos pitable reception ; and next morning were ran across the bay in their galley, and landed safely upon our own shores. There are other perils, also, to which the cover-shooter is obnoxious. The eye is some times endangered by pressing unguardedly through the copse wood ; and I knew one case where the sight was totally lost from a twig springing from a person who was strug gling through the underwood and striking the next who foUowed. The legs also are fre quently and severely wounded by the sharp stumps which remain after a thicket has been thinned. But from random shots the chief danger arises ; and to prevent accidents occur ring, a party, and particularly if it be numerous, should be guarded in selecting then stands and The cock-shooting, to use my cousin's words, in the west of Ireland is acknowledged to be very superior ; and when the flight has been large, and the season is sufficiently severe to drive the birds weU to cover, there is not, to a quick eye, more beautiful shooting in the world. Some of the covers are copses of natural wood, situated in the very centre of the mountains. Consequently, when the snow"], [148, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 144 altering their positions. I have been struck a dozen times, but never with any worse effect than receiving a shot or two hf my cheek and ear ; but many a time I have felt a shower rattle against my fustian jacket, which, how ever, endured it bravely, as a garment of proof should do. dent, something induced him to make a corre sponding change ; and at last I became so nervous, that I obUged him momently to call out, that I might ascertain our relative posi tions, and guard, if possible, against injury. We once, during a severe frost, shot the beautiful islands in the lake of Castlebar, which belong to the Marquis of Sligo. There were an immense number of cocks in cover, and we had been particularly successful ; but the wonder was, I had that day escaped unwounded, and my prayer to \" keep lead out of me \" had been heard. On our return, my friend was pluming himself on this result. \" It was foolish,\" he said, \" to reckon him unlucky. To be sure some shots of his had been unfor tunate, but such would ever be the case.\" We had now left off shooting, and were within a few fields of the barracks, when a jack snipe sprang from a drain on the road-side, and flying to the top of the field, pitched in the upper ditch. I foUowed it merely to discharge my barrels \u2014 it sprang, and the report of my gun disturbed a hare in the bottom of the field ; she moved, and my companion instantly dis charged both barrels. From the hardness of the surface, the shot rose ; a shower fell upon the protected parts of my person, while two struck me in the lip, and cut me deeply. I was more than one hundred yards from him, yet from the hard frost, the ricochet of the shot came as sharply upon me, as if I had been within point-blank distance. After that incident, need I add ? much as I loved him, I never pulled a trigger in his company again. Some men, from carelessness or stupidity, are reaUy a nuisance to a cover-party ; and to others, one would almost ascribe a fatahty, and avoid them lrice an evil genius. In the former case, I have found, after remonstrance failed, and they continued throwing their shot liberally around, without apparently caring one farthing upon whose person it alighted, the best cure was instantly to turn a barrel as nearly in the direction of the report as possible. A well-distributed charge rattling through the brush wood, and faUing upon the delinquent, gave, practicaUy, a hint that made him more cautious for the future, and proved more effec tive than the most powerful jobation. Of the latter class \u2014 I mean unlucky companions \u2014 I shall particularise one. Captain M shot with me an entire season. He was a pretty shot, and an excellent feUow ; but I never entered a cover with him that I was not certain to be struck before we returned home. Every precaution to evade his shot was useless. If in a copse of a mile long there was a solitary opening to admit its passage, he was opposite it to a certainty ; and my first intimation that such an aUey did exist, would be a fall of withered leaves from the bushes above, and most likely a few grains lodging in my hat or jacket. If I moved to avoid a chance of acci- CHAPTER XLI. Dull evening \u2014 Memoir of Hennessey. We sat down to dinner tete-a-tete, and although both myself and my kinsman made an exertion to banish unpleasant reminiscences, the even ing was the most sombre that I had yet passed.

Encouraged by my father's partiality, from this period he led an idle care less life, and rambled over the country, break ing dogs, or amusing himself with the gun and fishing-rod. nessey could not without giving offence decline attending on the happy occasion. He was then a remarkably handsome feUow \u2014 and you would vainly now seek in those gaunt and careworn features, the manly beauty which then caused many a rustic heart to beat. The bride's cousin accompanied her ; she was re markably pretty, and was, besides, reported to be the largest heiress in the barony. With such advantages, no wonder ' of lovers she'd plenty,' as the baUad says : \u2014 my foster-brother met her, danced with her, drank with her \u2014 loved her, and was beloved in turn. Every rival was double-distanced ; but she was un fortunately betrothed by her father to a wealthy Kearne ; * and although I, in person, inter posed, and used my powerful influence, the old feUow her father was obstinate in refusing to break off the match. \"I was at the college when the first of his misfortunes occurred.

Hennessey, too late, perceived his danger ; but with that daring determination for which he has ever been remarkable, when the assault began, he made a sudden dash for the door, andovertumingallthat opposed him, succeeded in escaping. He was, however, closely pursued. From his uncommon activity, he far outstripped all but one of his enemies. He had nearly reached the river \u2014 but his enemy was close behind. Intending to disable his pursuer, Hennessey picked up a stone, and unfortunately threw it with such fatal precision, that the skuU of his Opponent was beaten in, and he expired on the spot. \" Hennessey was no man to see his hand some mistress consigned without her own consent to the arms of a rival. He made the usual arrangements, and I encouraged him to carry her off. The evening came \u2014 he left the Lodge in a boat, with six fine young peasants ; and crossing the bay, landed by moonlight at a little distance from the village where his inamorata dwelt. \" Well, this was an unfortunate affair, but it was homicide in self-defence. My father accommodated matters with the Sweenies, and my foster-brother was discharged without a prosecution. \" That very night a multitude of the Mal leys had accompanied the accepted suitor to conclude all necessary preliminaries. The cabin of the heiress was crowded, and all within was noisy revelry. Hennessey, with one companion, stole to the back of the house. \" A year passed, but the Sweenies had not forgotten or forgiven the death of their kinsman. Hennessey's rambling habits exposed him to frequent encounters with this clan : and one night, when returning late from the fair of Newport, with two or three companions, he came into unexpected coUision with a party of his ancient enemies. A scuffle ensued \u2014 in the struggle he wrested a loaded whip from his antagonist, and struck the unhappy wretch so heavily with his own weapon, that after linger ing nearly a month, he died from the contusion. \" He knew the chamber of the bride elect, for he had more than once ' when all the world were dreaming,' visited his pretty mistress. He looked through the little casement, and, sight of horror ! there she was, seated on the *ide of the bed, and the Kearne's arm around her waist, with all the familiarity of a privdeged lover ! There, too, was the priest of Inniskea, and divers elders of ' both the houses ' \u2014 whUe the remainder of the company, for whose accommodation this grand chamber was in sufficient, were indulging in the kitchen or dancing in the bam. \"This second mishap occasioned us a deal of trouble ; but Hennessey surrendered, was tried, and acquitted, and we aU trusted that his misfortunes were at an end. He abjured the use of spirits, avoided late hours, and such meetings as might expose him to any collision with that clan who had been so unfortunate, and religiously determined to avoid every cause of quarrelling ; but fate detennined that it should be otherwise. \" Since the days of Lochinvar, there never was a more daring suitor than my foster brother ; yet he did not consider it a prudent measure to enter the state apartment ' 'mong bridesmen, and kinsmen, and clansmen, and aU,' \u2014 but waited patiently at the window, to see what some lucky chance might do.

My first care was to look to the safety of my foster-brother and his bride ; and until pursuit was over, I had them conveyed by, Pattigo in the hooker to Innisboffin. There they remained in safe concealment, and for six months it was not deemed prudent to permit them to return, as the clan of the deceased were numerous and vindictive. \" Time flew. They came back, and for some time remained here unmolested . Kathleein was near her confinement, when one day we re- ceived information that the MaUeys had pro- cured a warrant with a civU force to execute it, and were determined at every hazard to arrest my foster-brother. I, a magistrate myself, could not openly protect him ; and that evening he left the lodge at night-faU, to shelter himself at Innisbiggle untU the threatened danger passed. Kathleein unfortunately accompanied him ; although we told her that there was- but one poor famUy on the place, and its difficulty of approach, wfrile favourable to the conceal- ment of her husband, was unsuited to any female situated like her. \" An attempt so boldly and so fortunately begun, was, however, doomed to endunhappUy. One of the MaUeys had discovered the inter view, and witnessed the elopement. Having sUently observed the route of the fugitives, he apprized the parties within, that their negotia tions were likely to become nugatory, and a fierce and vindictive pursuit was instantly commenced. The distance, however, to trie beach was short : the companion of the bold abductor had ran forward ; the bride was won \u2014 the boat was launched \u2014 the oars were drip ping in the water \u2014 when, alas ! the rush of rapid footsteps were heard, and oaths and threats announced that the fugitives were closely followed. Two or three of the MaUeys had far outstripped the rest ; but a minute more, and pursuit would have been hopeless. One man had passed the others far, and on the brink of the tide he caught the fair runaway in his arms, while the companions of the gaUant were actuaUy pulling her on board. The chase was hard at hand \u2014 twenty feet were heard rushing over the loose shingle \u2014 not a moment was to be lost, or the bride was gone for ever. Like lightning Hennessey caught up a stretcher from the bottom of the boat, discharged one mur derous blow upon the man who held back his beloved mistress, a deep-drawn moan was heard, and the unhappy Keame, for it was himself, sank upon the beach without life or motion ! Off went the boat \u2014 off went the lady \" On landing on the island, the sohtary famUy, who generaUy resided in the single cabin it contained, were absent at the fair of Westport. Hennessey and his wife took pos session of the hut, righted a sire, and made themselves as comfortable as the wretched hovel would admit. Even then he urged her to return to the Lodge \u2014 but to leave him in perfect solitude on this desolate place was more than she could determine. Night came, and the weather, which had been squaUy aU day, became worse momently, and at midnight blew a gale. The outlaw and his wife were now shut out from aU the world, for a raging sea was roaring round the island, and aU com munication with the main was interrupted. Whether fear precipitated the dreaded event I know not ; but in the middle of the night, whUe the elemental war was in its fury, symp toms of approaching travaU were perceived by poor Kathleein, and the unhappy girl became more and more sensible of the terrible danger that was coming on.

Law there will be, of course. The rival claimant was formerly an attorney, who managed to spoliate an unhappy fool who was litigiously inclined, and of course became owner of the property. He who thus gets them will be most tenacious of ill-acquired rights ; and this log and spar will most likely ter minate in being made a droit of the Admiralty. THE day of my departure from this wild retreat, where so many months' have happily passed over, is determined : indeed, the season hardly admits a longer sojourn, and circumstances beyond my control require an immediate return to England. My kinsman has made arrange ments for passing the genial season of Christ mas, and the remainder of the winter, with his relations in the interior ; and in the morning fox-hunt and evening dance, the dullest months of gloomy winter wdl merrily disappear. For me, were I not encumbered with a for tune, and \"all the ills that flesh is heir to\" when one is afflicted with independence, this place would suit me admirably. Though these shores be wild, and the weather savage, yet ever)' day brings its novelty along with it. The winter fisheries on the coast are magnificent ; and birds, known only to a naturalist else where, are daily presented during the stormy season to the active and intelligent shooter. That wild being, Hennessey, has preserved an infinity of curious specimens ; and many a rare production that the ornithologist would prize, is here shot, and disregarded by the peasant who is so fortunate as to possess a gun. We started on our last chasse' \u2014 and the ultima dies of our sporting wanderings has come. The shortened days and wet moors have made us desert grouse-shooting, and we crossed the estuary to shoot a fen some three miles off, which at this season is thickly tenanted with snipes and waterfowl. The day was particularly favourable ; dark and quiet,* with a gentle breeze. As we had to traverse a hill which bounds the tillage grounds of several of the opposite villages, we brought the greyhounds with us, to get a run or two while passing this otherwise unprofitable beat. For my own part I had early given up coursing in disgust. The hares were not plenty \u2014 difficult to find \u2014 and when we did get them a-foot, they either made for the sea-shore, or ran into some morass, where dogs had no chance whatever, and one became weary of Among the natural advantages which this remote coast possesses, the ocean contributes largely to the stock, and even the tempest does not rage in vain. The prevailing westerly winds drive many a serviceable waif to the shore ; and seldom a winter passes, but some valuable wreck or derelict property adds to my kins man's limited resources. True, these \" angel visits \" are irregular, and come in questionable shape ; but still, be they in form of butter or rum, train-oil or mahogany, they answer \" for the nonce,\" and even a dead body has not been profitless to the finder. * Snipes, when plenty, afford very excellent sport, it being allowed to be the pleasantest on account of the quick succession of shots ; this is also the best shooting for practice, seldom fail ing to make indifferent shots most excellent ones'. There is no shooting that presents such variety of shots, scarcely any two being alike. These birds usually fly against the wind, there fore every snipe-shooter should walk down it, as by that means the bird, if he rises before him, will |fly back, and coming round him, describe a kind of circle, or at least his flight, for a certain distance, wiU not lengthen the shot, allowing him a certain time to cover the bird, and take good aim : for if he gets up before him, and should by chance go down the wind or from him, it is then the most difficult shot. It will be proper in this case to let the bird get a little distance from him, as then he will fly steadier, and the slightest grain will fetch him to the ground. I possibly have thus digressed from having witnessed the triumphant arrival of a huge beam of Dantzic oak and a ship's topmast, which certain retainers of my gentle cousin have towed in. It appears that the \" spolia opima\" were discovered early in the morning about the centre of the bay, and a boat from both shores approached them nearly at the same time. Both, like true vassals, claimed on behalf of their respective master ; and it being impossible, on what an Irishman would"], [153, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 149 and wagged his tail as if he would have said, \"Lord! you don't know what I have here.\" A tuft of earth flung by one of the aides-de camp obliged the skuri^er to get up, and to our general surprise a fine bittern arose. I knocked him over, but though he came down with a broken wing and wounded leg, he kept the old dog at bay until my companion floun dered through the swamp and secured him. On this exploit I plumed myself, for bitterns are here extremely scarce, and in Ballycroy they are seldom heard or found. seeing them cut themselves on rocks, or flounder in a bog ; and latterly I gave up the business as a bad concern. But on this occasion I was agreeably disappointed. The hill afforded a sound and level surface ; from its contiguity to the corn-fields, the hares were tolerably numerous, and before we reached the shooting ground, we had six excellent courses, and killed four hares. I never observed a more striking contrast in point of size than these hares exhibited. Two of them were of the smallest mountain class ; dark-coloured meagre animals, who certainly made matchless running while they lasted. The others were of the fullest size ; and in point of good condition, though neither so large nor so white as Byron's, would have done honour to any hare-park in Great Britain. On our return home we passed the old castle of Doona, once supposed to have been honoured by the residence of Mrs. Grace O'Malley, who, if fame tells truth, was neither a rigid moralist nor over-particular in her ideas of \" meum and tuum.\" Some wUd traditions are handed down of her exploits ; and her celebrated visit to that English vixen Elizabeth is fairly on record. The castle of Doona was, till a few years since, in excellent preservation, and its masonry was likely to have puzzled Father Time himself; but Irish ingenuity achieved in a few hours what as many centuries had hitherto failed in effecting. The fen we sought was situate in a valley between two gentle slopes, and formed by a deep and sluggish stream which passed through its centre, extended for about four miles, varying its breadth from a few yards to more than a quarter of a mile. The morass was inter spersed with shrubs and underwood, and alders of inconsiderable size were occasionally clumped along the borders. Part of the surface was too unsound to admit of its being traversed by the lightest foot, but generally it was broken into tammocks, which a bold and practised shooter might pass with Uttle difficulty. We took oppo site sides, and consequently few birds sprang without affording one or other of the guns a fair shot. The number of snipes that flushed in this fen went far beyond my expectation, though considerably excited ; and besides, we met at least fifteen couple of that sweet little duck the Teal. We followed the morass to its extremity, and then returned \u2014 and our beat homewards was pleasanter, and, so far as the game-bags went, more profitable than the first range. A rich and hospitable farmer,* whose name wiU be long remembered in this remote spot, had erected a comfortable dwelling imme diately adjoining the courtyard wall of the ancient fortress ; and against the tower itself was piled in wealthy profusion a huge supply of winter fuel. It was a night of high solemnity, for his first-born son was christened. No wonder, then, that all within the house were drunk as lords. Turf was wanted, and one of the boys was despatched for a cleaveful \u2014 -but though Pat could clear a fair, and \" bear as much beating as a bull,\" he was no man to venture into the old tower in the dark, \"and it haunted.\" Accordingly, to have fair play \"if the ghost gripped him,\" he provided him self with a brand of burning bog-deal. No goblin assailed him, and he filled his basket and returned unharmed to the company, but unfortunately forgot the light behind him. The result may be anticipated. The turf caught fire, and from the intense heat of such a mass of fuel the castle -walls wers rent from top to bottom, and one side fell before morning with a crash like thunder. Nor was the calamity confined to fallen tower and lost fuel. Alas ! several kegs and ankers of contraband spirits were buried beneath the walls, and the huge Out of seventy head, we reckoned one wood cock and a brace of old stagers that we found among the heathy banks bordering the fen. We shot six couple of teal ; and, with one exception, the remainder of the count were snipes, of which at least a fourth were jacks. In the most impassable section of the morass, old York pointed with more than customary steadiness ; and, \" it might be fancy,\" actually looked round with peculiar expression, as if he would intimate that no common customer was before him !

We found the warrener netting rabbits in the sand-banks. They were intended for sale in the interior, and many dozens were already taken. Formerly the skins were valuable, and a weU-stocked burrow was a valuable append age to a country gentleman ; but of late these furs have faUen so considerably in value, that the warren does not produce a tithe of what it did \" when Boney, the Lord speed him ! was uppermost.\" Indeed, many a hearty lament is made in Ballycroy for po'jr Napoleon, and his name is ever associated with times of past prosperity. Over the parting with this rude but affec tionate famUy I shall hurry. My cousin accom panied me to Westport, and we left the lodge after an early dinner, in full expectation of reaching that town for supper, though the dis tance is some ten or twelve leagues, and by an intricate passage, with very difficult and per plexing tides. As if fortune wished to offer me a parting compliment, the wind blew from the north-west, and there was as much of it as we could well carry our full sails to. We entered the Bull's Mouth at three-quarter tide, and brought plenty of water over the sands, and in an hour cleared the Sound, and rushing through the boiling currents of Beamaglee, found ourselves in Clew Bay. The wind blew fresh and steadily, and at nine o'clock we were moored along the quay of Westport. I cannot describe the melancholy reflections which crowded over my mind as I squibbed off my barrels on the beach, while the boat was crossing the channel to carry us over the estuary. It was for the last time, and with that thought all the happy events I spent by \" flood and feU\" passed over my memory in \"shadowy review.\" The jovial commander, the burly priest, my merry cousin, the stern homicide, the ancient butier, and the defunct otter-kUler, aU were before me. I trod in fancy the banks of Pulgarrow, or couched among the rocks of our Highland ambuscade ; I saw the startled pack spring from the purple heather, while the red deer, One incident occurred : at a rocky point which ran from the Achil side into the Sound, and there narrowed the channel considerably, we observed a human being couched on a stone among the sea-weed.

It was Hennessey \u2014 and nothing could dissuade him, notwithstanding the risk was considerable, from coming on board to give me a parting escort.

My imaginary wanderings continued tiU we landed at the pier, and with a deep sigh I has tened to my chamber, to make, for the last time, my toUet after a day of sylvan exercise. Early next morning I found myself in his Majesty's maU, and with many a sincere adieu, bade fareweU to my kind cousin and his wild but warm-hearted foUowers.

The two great classes, the gentry and peasantry, have undergone a mighty revo lution in conduct, manners, and modes of thinking; and yet one will look in vain for commensurate advantages. It is admitted that the former body have changed their generic character altogether. We have the old school stigmatized now for its aristocratic tyranny and petty assumption ; and many a modem squire blesses God that he is not as others were who preceded him. And yet our fathers were, I verily beUeve, wiser in their generation, and better fitted for their own times, than we. True, these days were Uttle better than bar barous. Denis Browne, and Dick Martin, and Bowes Daly, and many a far-famed name of minor note, were then in aU their glory, and they Uved, it must be acknowledged, in very curious times. In those days, the quarifications of a representative were determined by wager of battle, and a rival for senatorial fame was pro bably requested by the old member to provide his coffin, before he addressed the county. Doctors rode on horseback over the country in cauliflower wigs and cocked hats ; and if they differed about a dose or decoction, referred the dispute to mortal arbitrement. In these happy times, a cUent would shoot his counseUor if he lost a cause \u2014 the suitor sought his mistress at pistol-point \u2014 and there was but one universal panacea for every known evil, one grand remedy for aU injuries and insults. There was one class of persons who, in these old-world times, were conspicuously trouble some, who have since then fortunately disap peared. These were a nominal description of gentry, the proprietors of little properties called fodeeins, who continued the names and bar barisms of their progenitors. Without industry, without education, they arrogated a certain place in society, and idly imitated the wealthier in their vices. Poverty and distress were natural results, and desperate means were used to keep up appearances. The wretched serfs, whom they caUed their tenants, were ground to powder, till, happfly for society, the fodeeins passed into other hands, and the name and place ceased to be remembered. The ivied waUs, and numerous and slender chimneys one sees in passing through this country, wiU, in nine out of ten cases, point a moral of this sort. In times like those of forty years ago, this extinct tribe were from the peculiar temper and formation of society, occasionaUy a sad nui sance. The lord of a fodeein, like Captain Mac Turk, was \" precisely that sort of person who is ready to fight with any one ; whom no one can find an apology for declining to fight with ; in fighting with whom considerable danger is incurred ; and, lastly, through fight ing with whom no eclat or credit could redound to the antagonist.\" Hence, generaUy, the larger proprietors saw this class sink by de grees, without an attempt to uphold them, and the fodeein, to the great joy of the unhappy devils who farmed it, was appended by general consent to the next estate. It was then, indeed, a bustling world. Men fought often, drank deep, and played high; ran in debt, as a matter of course ; scattered fans and markets at then good pleasure ; put tenants in the stocks ad libitum ; and cared no more for the hberty of the subject than they did for the king's writ. Yet were they merry times. Under aU these desperate oppressions, the tenants throve and the peasantry were comfortable. Every viUage could point out its rich man \u2014 every cabin had food sufficient for its occupants. When the rent was required it was ready ; and though a man was sometimes in the guard-house, his cow was rarely in the pound. Tempora mutantur ! Who dare now infringe upon the liberty ofthe subject ? \"Who put my man i' the stocks ? \" would be haUooed from Dingle to Cape Clear. Doubtless, civil rights are now most scrupulously protected ; but I suspect that food is abridged in about the same proportion that freedom is extended. Many examples of dangerous and iUegal authority, as usurped and exercised by the aristocracy within the last half-century, are on record, that would appear mere romance to a stranger. One of the Fitzgerald famUy was probably more remarkable than any person of his times. He was the terror of the upper classes \u2014 and to such as arrogated the privileges of the aristocracy, without, as he opined, a prescriptive right, he was the very devd. If a man aspired to become a duellist, or even joined the hounds, without being the proper caste, George Robert would flog him from the field without ceremony. He actuaUy for years maintained an armed banditti, imprisoned his own father, took off persons who were ob noxious \u2014 and when lie was hanged \u2014 and for tunately for society this eventuaUy occurred \u2014 it required a grand cavalry and artUlery movement from Athlone to effect it. Denis Browne was an autocrat of another"], [156, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 152 description ; a useful blundering bear, who did all as religiously in the king's name as ever Mussulman in that of the prophet. He did much good and some mischief \u2014 imprisoned and transported as he pleased ; and the peasan try to this day will tell you, that he could hang any one whom he disliked. Yet both these men were favourites with their tenantry, and under them their dependents prospered and waxed wealthy. where he crossed the Turlough river, are pointed out by the peasantry. The dark act which clouded his memory, and his unhappy fate, are generaUy known ; and considering the other traits of his strange and mingling character, the apology offered by his friends on the score of occasional insanity, is not improbable. One circumstance would strengthen this conclusion. He was interred by night, and with so much privacy, in the old churchyard of Turlough, that the place where his remains lay was for a time uncertain. Accident in some degree revealed it. In the confusion attendant upon his hurried sepulture, it is said that a ring was forgotten and left upon the finger. Afterwards, in opening the ground, this relic was discovered ; and what more satisfactorily proved it was that the skuU was distinctly fractured ; and it was a matter weU known, that Fitzgerald had been danger ously wounded by a pistol-bullet in the head, in one of his numerous and sanguinary duels on the continent. Sometimes the memoir of an individual wUl give a more graphic picture of the age wherein he flourished than a more elaborate detaU ; and in the strange eventful histories of these two singular men, the leading characters of their times will be best portrayed. No persons were more dissimilar \u2014 none were bitterer enemies \u2014 none in every point, personal and physical, were more essentially opposite. In one point alone there was a parallel \u2014 both were tyrants in disposition, and both would possess power, no matter at what price. George Robert Fitzgerald was middle-sized, and slightly but actively formed ; his features were regular, his address elegant, and his man ners formed in the best style of the French school. In vain the physiognomist would seek in his handsome countenance for some trace of that fierce and turbulent disposition which marked his short and miserable career. No one when he pleased it, could delight society more ; and with the fair sex he was proverbiaUy successful. It is said that gallantly, however, was not his forte, and that he seldom used his persuasive powers with women, but for objects ultimately pecuniary or ambitious. Denis Browne, when a young man, is said to have been extremely handsome : but early in life he became corpulent and engrossed in other pursuits, gradually careless and slovenly in his person, and neglected any means to restrain his constitutional obesity. To strong natural abUities, he united decision of character and mental energy. He started in dangerous times ; several influential families disputed political power with him \u2014 he had a fierce and dangerous aristocracy to overcome \u2014 men cold to every argument \"but the last and worst one,\" the pistol. Hence in the very outset of his voyage, his vessel all but foundered. It was his first contest for the county, and he was opposed by the late Lord Clanmorris. The Bingham party was bold and powerful, and after a protracted contest, matters looked gloomy enough, and the Brownes were likely to be defeated. Added to his external advantages, he was an educated man ; and that he possessed no mean literary talent, may be inferred from his cele brated \"Apology,\" which is neatly and spiritedly written. His courage was undoubted. In Paris and London he was noted as a dueUist ; and in Mayo, his personal encounters are stiU remembered. His duel with Dr. Martin, his encounter with C\u00e6sar French, the most notorious fire-eaters of the day, placed him foremost in that class. He was, moreover, a dead shot, and reported to be one ofthe ablest swordsmen in the kingdom. As a sportsman he was justly celebrated. He was an elegant horseman, and ,his desperate riding was the theme of fox-hunters for many a year. No park-wall or flooded river stopped him \u2014 and to this day, leaps that he surmounted, and points \" In this dilemma,\" to use his own words, \" I have applied to CounseUor , my legal adviser. I told him how badly things were, and inquired what was to be done ? \" ' My dear Denis,' said he, with a grave and serious movement of his full-bottomed wig, ' the thing admits but one remedy, and that lies in a nut-shell. You are one-and-twenty years old, and you have never yet been on the sod \u2014 why that one fact would lose you your election \u2014 you must fight \u2014 my dear boy.' \" ' Fight ! to be sure I will, when I'm in. suited.'"], [157, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 153 \" ' Of course you would, and so would any body : but you must fight, and that too this very evening.' and arbitrary power, which then every country justice committed ; but after all, the times have changed for the worse \u2014 and the outcry about invaded rights and an enslaved popula tion, was, after all, mere verbiage, \" signifying nothing.\" \" ' Impossible ! how could it be managed ? ' \" ' How ! arrah whihst, Denis ! \u2014 maybe ye think I have nothing but law in my head ; you must knock down Bingham ! ' The last fading gleam of western prosperity was during the power of Napoleon, and with his dynasty it vanished. The terrible change, from war to peace ; the bursting ofthe banking bubbles, which supplied for that time an imagi nary capital ; over-population and high rents, have rained this wild district, and reduced its peasantry, with few exceptions, to abject wretchedness and want. \" ' Knock down a man who never offended me \u2014 with whom I have no dispute ? ' \" And what does this matter ? The blow will settle that difficulty. But as you are particular, can't ye say some friend of his affronted one of yours \u2014 some devil you never heard of wiU answer \u2014 and as John Bingham is a reasonable man, he'd not lose time in asking idle questions.' Is there for this any remedy ? Cannot modern landlords, acting on what they caU enlightened principles, remove the causes of distress, and restore the peasantry to that scale of comfort they enjoyed under the rude and tyrannical regime of their fathers ? They cannot. They will talk \"scholarly \" of tithes and local taxation, and vainly attribute the in solvency of their tenants to these and such like causes ; this is vox et pr\u0153terea nihil \u2014 an unreal and fanciful conceit. The true cause of the misery of the western population is over population and excessive rents ; and before the peasantry could be tolerably comfortable, the lands must, on the average, be lowered at least ojie third. Even then, at present prices, the occupant will be hardly able to manage to pay the rent and rive. \"Accordingly, I foUowed this excellent advice, struck Bingham on the steps of the court-house, was caUed out in half an hour, fought in the barrack-yard, was there wounded, and won my election.\" From that period Denis Browne rose rapidly into power. His able brother, the late Marquis of Sligo, supported him with aU his influence and talent. Denis overcame every obstacle, distanced every competitor, and at last was absolute in authority, dictator for twenty years, and ruled the county during that period with a rod of iron. No one was warmer in his friendship or more virulent in his antipathies. These feel ings blinded his better judgment, and many of his greatest mistakes arose from an anxiety to aggrandize a favourite or annoy an enemy. He unfortunately outlived his power, and that circumstance embittered his latter years. He had not resolution to quit public life while he might have retired with eclat; he saw his in fluence expire, and his power partitioned insen sibly among men with whom, but a few years before, his will was law. But can the landlords do this ? Can they afford to equalize their rental to the times, and throw a third portion from their nominal income overboard ? They cannot. The majority ofthe owners of western estates, from family burdens and national unthriftiness, are heavily and hopelessly encumbered ; and a reduction on such scale as would be neces sary to ensure their tenants' comforts, would completely pauperise themselves. Hence, to keep off the evU day, every pretext but the true one will be assigned for local wretchedness \u2014 and every reason but tbe right one offered to the starving tenant, to persuade him that ruinous rents wril never occasion want and poverty. In private rife Denis Browne was cheerful and hospitable. FuU of anecdote, an excellent story-teller, one who had mixed largely with the world and knew mankind intimately, he was an amusing and instructive companion. Young and lively society he delighted in ; and though, from increased corpulency, and all \" the ills that flesh is heir to,\" life was latterly a burden, the mind was vigorous to the last \u2014 and the death-bed of Denis Browne was marked with a firmness and phUosophy that was in perfect keeping with the energy and de termination of his life. In personal appearance, the western peasantry are very inferior to those of the other divisions ofthe kingdom. Generally, they are undersized and by no means so good-looking as their southern neighbours \u2014 and I would say Another order of things has succeeded. Men talk now with horror of acts of oppression"], [158, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 154 permanently among them. This latter inherent prejudice may arise from clannish feehngs, or ancient recoUections of how much their ances tors were spohated by former settlers, who by artifice and the strong hand managed to pos sess the better portions of the country. They are also absurdly curious, and will press then questions with American pertinacity, untU, if possible, the name, rank, and occasion of his visit, is fully and faithfully detaUed by the persecuted traveUer. in other points they are equaUy deficient. To overcome their early lounging gait and slovenly habits, is found by military men a troublesome task ; and whUe the Tipperary man speedily passes through the hands of the drill-sergeant, the Mayo peasant requires a long and patient ordeal, before a martial carriage can be acquired, and he be perfectly set-up as a soldier. These defects once conquered, none are better calculated for the profession. Hardy, active, patient in wet and cold, and accus tomed to indifferent and irregular food, he is admirably adapted to endure the privations and fatigue incident to a soldier's rife on active service \u2014 and in dash and daring, no regiments in the service hold a prouder place than those which appertain to the kingdom of Connaught. The credulity of these wUdpeople is amazing, and then avidity for news, if possible, exceeded by the profound rehance they place in the truth of the inteUigence. Hence, the most absurd versions of passing events circulate over the district \u2014 and reports prevaU, by turns, of a ridiculous or mischievous tendency, generaUy according to the mental temperament of the story-teUer. It is said that the physical appearance of the Irish peasantry deteriorates as the northern and western sea-coasts are approached ; and, certainly, on the latter the population are very inferior to that ofthe adjacent counties. Even the inhabitants of different baronies in the same county, as then locality advances inland, wiU be found to differ materiaUy ; and in an extensive cattle-fair, trie islander wiU be as easUy distinguished from the borderer, whether he be on the Galway or Roscommon frontier, as from the stock-master of Leinster, or the jobber from the North. It formerly was not uncommon for people in the islands to rive and die without ever having seen a town. Of course, they were a simple and unsophisticated race \u2014 and their natural mistakes, if they did by accident come in col lision with other beings, were the source of many an inland jest. One very old story is told, in which an AchU man is the hero ; and as to its truth, old Antony would as soon have doubted the existence of the holy trout in Kilgeever,* as have questioned its authenticity. Indeed, fifty years back, the communication between the islands and the interior was so difficult and unfrequent, that the respective occupants looked on each other as very strangers. NaturaUy, slowly as civilisation crept westward, the islands and remoter coasts, from local causes, were last visited, and many curious circumstances to this day would prove it. In this age of machinery, when the minutest matters are produced by its agencies, and the lowest occupations of human labour are transacted by powers unknown to our fathers, there are extensive tracts upon the western portions of the island, where even a mill has never been erected, and where the com is prepared for distillation or food by the same rude methods used by barbarous nations one thousand years ago. Trituration between two stones, bythehandlabour of an individual, is the means employed to reduce the corn into meal ; and the use of that ancient hand-miU the querne, is stUl general throughout Balhcroy and the islands on the coast. An islander was once obhged to go into the town of Castlebar upon business ; and among other marveUous things which there met his sight, he was particularly struck with the ap pearance of an earthen jar in a shop-window. He inquired what this unknown article might be, and was informed that it was a mare's egg, which, if placed beside trie fire during the winter, would infallibly produce a foal next spring. The price was moderate, and the AchU man determined to possess the treasure, and thus become master of a horse. Having effected the purchase, he set out on his way re joicing \u2014 and before evening feU came within view of his own home, and sat down on a heathy bank to rest himself. He placed his recent acquisition beside him \u2014 but alas ! from its spherical form, it roUed down the hUl, and, striking against a rock at the bottom, was shivered by the blow. A hare which had couched beneath the stone, startled at the crash, sprang from her form, and went off at speed. The unhappy AchU man gazed, in an The inhabitants of this district are extremely hospitable to passing traveUers, but by no means fond of encouraging strangers to sojourn * A sacred well in the west, tenanted by a trout of surpassing sanctity."], [159, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 155 agony of despair, after what he believed the emancipated quadruped \u2014 and then exclaimed with a bitter groan, \" Mona mon diaoul !

Even her simple toiletevinced instinctive taste, though no corset was required to regulate a form moulded by the hand of Nature, and her magnificent hair boasted no arrangement beyond the simple cincture of a ribbon \u2014 \u25a0 Now, the most curious part of this story is, that although a standing joke upon Achil simplicity for a century, it is to be found verbatim in a German jest-book, with this only difference, that a gourd is there substituted for ajar. But seldom was a snood amid Such wild luxuriant ringlets hid, Whose glossy black to shame might bring The plumage of a raven's wing. And yet I have seen that young beauty bending beneath a basket of potatoes which would have overloaded me \u2014 and, on one occa sion, carrying a strapping feUow across the river, who was coming on some state affair to the cabin, which, as he conceived, required him to appear in the presence with dry legs. In aUuding to the strange employments of the female peasantry, I noticed those coarse and laborious exercises which elsewhere are confined to the lords of the creation. That the appearance of the fair inhabitants of the western highlands should harmonize with their rude avocations, might be expected ; and hence the female peasantry, in personal advantages, are very inferior indeed to those ofthe interior. The constant exposure to sun and storm injures the complexion, and gives them an old and faded look ; and the habit of dispensing with shoes renders the feet large and misshapen. Among the Coryphees who frequented our mountain baUs, there was but one girl who might be termed decidedly riandsome. Her face was uncommonly inteUigent \u2014 I never saw so dark an eye, and her teeth were white as ivory. But there was a natural ease in ah she did \u2014 whether she brought a pitcher from the On the score of propriety of conduct, I would assign the female peasantry of this dis trict a high place. When the habits of the country are considered, one would be inclined to suspect that excessive drinking, and the frequent scenes of nocturnal festivities which wakes and dances present, would naturally lead to much immorality. This, however, is not the case : \u2014 broken vows will no doubt occa sionaUy require the interference of the magis trate or the priest ; but generaUy the lover makes the only reparation in his power, and the deceived females and deserted chUdren are seldom seen in Erris. CHAPTER XLFV. Hunting \u2014 Men \u2014 Horses and hounds- ; \u2014 Game \u2014 Conclusion. If ever a district were designed by Nature for field sports, a person, from even a cursory glance upon the map, would point to Mayo. Its great extent of mountain surface, inter spersed with bogs and morasses \u2014 its numerous and expansive waters \u2014 and its large tracts of downs and feeding-grounds, render it avariable for every purpose of the sportsman ; and few species of game indigenous to Britain in their pecuUar seasons, wiU here be sought in vain. dashing rider. Hence, in the annals of fox hunting, the bipeds and quadrupeds of Con naught are held in due estimation ; and it has been stated, without contradiction, that in their own country no men or horses can com pete with them. During the last century, the West of Ireland was celebrated for its breed of horses. They were of that class denominated \" the old Irish hunter,\" \u2014 a strong, weU-boned, and enduring animal, that without any pretension to extra ordinary speed, was sufficiently fast for fox hounds, an exceUent weight-carrier, and, better stiU, able to live with any dogs and in any country. As fencers, this breed was un equalled ; and for a crack hunter to carry ten or elevenstone over six feet six ot solid masonry, As a hunting country, the plains have been justly chronicled \u2014 and the adjacent counties of Galway and Roscommon yield to none in the empire. The extensive sheep-farms afford superior galloping-ground \u2014 and the fences, though few and far between, from their size and character, require a powerful horse and"], [160, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 156 was no extraordinary event ; \u2014 seven feet has been achieved repeatedly\u2014 and there are still, I have no doubt, many horses in the province capable of performing the latter feat. But, alas ! this noted class of hunters is now com paratively rare \u2014 a higher-blooded, and, as aU admit, an inferior caste has been substituted \u2014 the racing hunter fills the stables that formerly were occupied by the old Roscommon weight carrier \u2014 and in a few years this celebrated and valuable animal will be seldom seen. The number of English thorough-bred horses intro duced within the last thirty years into the Connaught racing studs, gradually introduced a slight and unserviceable hybrid, \u2014 and, too late, gentlemen discovered the error of endea vouring to procure a cross, which should combine increased speed with those durable qualities that alone can enable a horse, under reasonable weight, to rive with fast hounds in a country where they can go for miles without a check, and where the leaps are always severe, and occasionally tremendous. such riders, how long some noble hunters have lasted. The hounds, with few exceptions, are in ferior! They are seldom properly kenneUed, or regularly hunted. Masters of hounds in the West seem careless to aU considerations be yond having a pack that can go high and keep tolerably weU together. In sizing and draught ing dogs* they are by no means particular, and hence the ensemble of many a kennel is materiaUy injured. In home management and field turn-out, they are infinitely behind their English brethren: \u2014 the packs are carelessly hunted \u2014 the kennel servants badly appointed \u2014 and I have met men upon the plains able to take a horse over any thing that hand and heart could carry him, who to a stranger would appear, from \" the wUdness of their attire,\" to be desperate apprentices levanting with their master's property. And yet, after this eulogy upon the splendid horsemanship of the Western gentlemen, it may appear singular that I add, few of them ride well to hounds. An impatience in the field, and the anxiety to be foremost where aU are forward, interferes constantly with the dogs, and causes a pressure upon the pack, very un favourable to good hunting. Riding rather at the field than to the hounds, is the prevailing error. Fences are crossed which would be better evaded \u2014 horses unnecessarily distressed ; and I have seen a man actuaUy go out of his way to take a regular rasper, when he had a gap within thirty yards. Of the riders, it may be observed that, much as Connaught has been celebrated for des perate horsemanship, no charge of degeneracy will lie against the present race. To the curious in break-neck fencing, I would recom mend a sojourn with a Connaught club- \u2014 or if that should be inconvenient, a visit to the steeple-chases on the plains or at Knockcrog hery would be sufficient \u2014 he will there see six feet walls especially built \" for the nonce,\" under the inspection of conscious stewards, who would give nothing but honest measure, taken at racing speed, and that too in the middle of a bunch of gentlemen, who would ride over an adopted child ; \u2014 or let him join a drag after a champagne lunch at Lord C's ; \u2014 let him do this, and then form his estimate of Connaught horsemanship. Game in Mayo would be much more abundant than it is were it not sadly thinned by irregular shooters, and an infinity of ver min. To prevent the spoliations of the former would be a difficult task \u2014 as, from the quan tity of wild fowl that every winter brings to the Western shores, a number of guerilla sports- A mistake prevails in England, as to thc supposed inferiority in value of the horses com monly employed by the Western sportsmen. I have seen a field out, when, of twelve horses, ten would probably average at one hundred guineas each ; and the remaining two (brothers, Jerry and Lancet) were reported to have cost the noble owner five hundred guineas apiece. When the dangers of a stone-wall country and the desperate riding of the men are considered, these are indeed sporting prices. And yet accidents of a serious character are not fre quent ; every horse that has been ridden to hounds is generally blemished more or less ; but it is astonishing in such a country and with * The same remark may be made respecting the setters and pointers in general use among the Connaught sportsmen. Many admirable dogs will be met occasionally : but there appears to be little pains taken in matching the females ; and in the same kennel you will find an inter mixture of different and discordant stocks. Not unfrequent I have seen a man shooting to setters, pointers, and droppers, on the same heath, and hunting all indiscriminately. As to greyhounds, they are in little request excepting in the mountain district \u2014 and those principally kept are of the rough and wiry species, or the small smooth breed, which from their lightness are best adapted for the soft bogs which form the coursing-grounds."], [161, "WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. 157 men are employed or countenanced by the resident gentry ; to whom it is too strong a temptation, when lying for ducks, or stealing upon plovers, to discover a pack or covey grouped upon the snow, and yet have sufficient phUosophy to keep the finger from the trigger. The vermin, however, are the main cause of the scarcity of game, and no means are taken to destroy these marauders. From the eagle to the sparrow-hawk, every variety abounds in the woods and mountains, and every species of kite and crow that an ornithologist would ad mire, and a sportsman abominate, infests the Western counties. Other wild animals, in every variety, maybe met with in parts of Connaught. Badgers and wUd cats, martins and weasels will be found in their customary haunts ; while on the coast and estuaries, the lakes and inland waters, seals and otters are plentiful in the extreme. Of winged game, pheasants and partridges excepted, I have already spoken. With regard to the first, they are scarce, and, it would appear, difficult to rear in this moist and stormy climate. I speak only ofthe places contiguous to the coast where the experiment has been tried ; for inland, where they have been duly attended to, and the Enghsh sys tem adopted, they have thriven amazingly.- As to partridges, they are generally scarce, and in Erris and Ballycroy almost unknown. In the wheat counties, and especiaUy in certain parts of Galway, I believe they are tolerably abun dant \u2014 but by comparison with the quantity a sportsman meets in an English beat, the best partridge-shooting procurable in Connaught will be very indifferent indeed. Of fallow deer, there is a large stock in the parks throughout the province \u2014 and buck hunting has of late seasons been getting into fashion on the plains. I have already, in speaking of the red-deer, lamented the prospect of their extinction. That event I look upon as fast approaching \u2014 and I am convinced that nothing can avert this national calamity but a vigorous determination of the mountain pro prietors to extend protection to those limited herds which are still found, though in lessened numbers, upon the Alpine heights bordering on Burrishoole and Tyrawley. My task is ended \u2014 I have chronicled \" the short but simple annals \" of a sporting summer, passed in a remote and unfrequented corner of the earth, and protracted untd \"winter and rough weather \" forbade a longer stay. Into these solitudes I carried prejudices as unfair as they were unfavourable \u2014I came prepared to dislike a people who, unhappily for themselves, are little known and less regarded. I found my estimate of their character false, for kind nesses were returned tenfold, and the native outbreakings of Milesian hospitality met me at every step. What though the mountaineer had nothing but his potato-basket to offer \u2014 it was freely open to my hand. Did I wander from the road ? his loy* was left in the furrow, and he ran miles to put me in the right path. If it rained and I sheltered in a cabin, the hearth was swept, the driest log placed upon the fire, and the bed-covering taken off to keep my saddle from the shower. If possible, my wishes were anticipated \u2014 and labour was un heeded when my pleasure or comfort could be attained. Foxes are tolerably abundant in the hunting districts, and mischievously so in the mountains and islands. From the latter any quantity could be procured, and there is no place in Britain where covers could be so easily formed, and stocked with less trouble and expense. I have seen healthy foxes for days hawked over the country before a purchaser could be found, and at last disposed of for a few shillings. I once bought a fine dog-fox for half-a-crown, and, had I not become his owner, I verily be lieve the captor must have turned him out upon the street. Hares are in most places tolerably plentiful ; in point of numbers differing accord ing to local situation and the relative protection afforded to them. In the moors, the moun tain hares are scarce ; but, from the quantity of winged and four-footed vermin, it is sur prising that so many are occasionaUy seen. Rabbits abound in the West of Ireland. On the coast, the immense sand-banks are for miles perforated with their burrows \u2014 and, not withstanding that they are unmercifully aban doned to cur-dogs, cats, and vermin, their numbers continue unabated. In the woods and coppices bush rabbits are numerous, and cover-shooters, when beating for woodcocks, will have their amusement diversified by many a running shot. One incident I must mention, for it marks the character of this simple and devoted peasan try. It was the hottest of the dog-days, and | we had toiled over a barren moor, and missed some packs that we were aware were in that neighbourhood. A hill of most discouraging * Loy, a narrow spade."], [162, "158 WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST. simple means, brought the eruption plentifully to the skin, and in another week my gaUant henchman was at my side, without any appa rent trace of lassitude. \"altitude was before us \u2014 and as its face was difficult beyond description, I hesitated to attempt it. But beyond it was a land of pro mise \u2014 a vaUey where wonders might be ex pected \u2014 and malgre fatigue, I did muster courage for the ascent. I gave my gun to a young peasant who acted as my henchman, and, as he was already loaded heavUy, I ob served him stagger more than once before we gained the summit. Throughout the day he never left my side \u2014 when the river was forded, he led the way \u2014 and yet I observed that he was unusuaUy flushed, and at times sighed heavUy. When we reached the cabin, he tottered to a seat, and the next moment became insensible. Then, and not till then, the truth was dis closed ; he had been attacked with measles on the preceding night ; but rather than surrender his post to another, he actuaUy, and under the fever of the disease, worked for twelve hours beneath a burning sun. Old Antony, by some I have left these mountains, and never shall I enjoy the unaUoyed excitement \u2014 the calm luxurious sohtude, which I found among then wastes.
