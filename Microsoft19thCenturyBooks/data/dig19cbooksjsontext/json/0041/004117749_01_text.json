From Dr. Naumann, of Leipsic, I learned of the occurrence of the word in the Magnalia Dei of Bruckmann (1727). After ward I found it in Ercker's Aula Subterranea (1595); and later iu Gesner, on Fossils (1565), and in the Sarepta of Matthesius (1562), which contains a detailed description of it. In what earlier works the word occurs, and what was its origin, are among the questions unanswered. (See further p. 205.) The introduction of formulas on the basis of the new system of chemistry, with the necessary explanations, constitutes another addition. The formulas, it will be observed, while in principle those of the leaders of the system, have some peculiar features, serving to give them greater compactness on the page, and make them more easy of comparison, and bringing out well the unity and simplicity of type among inorganic compounds. In these and other ways the volume has unavoidably become enlarged. Not a page, and scarcely a paragraph, of the preceding edition remains unaltered, and full five-sixths of the volume have been printed from manuscript copy. I may here add, that, notwithstanding the impaired state of my health, this manuscript \u2014 the para graphs on the pyrognostic characters excepted \u2014 was almost solely in the handwri ting of the author, or in that of a copyist from it. Neither the consultation of original authorities, the drawing of conclusions, nor the putting of the results on paper, has been delegated to another. And being now but half way between the fifties and sixties, it is my hope that the future will afford another opportunity for similar work. The optical qualities of minerals have been but briefly stated, and in general for those species alone which seemed to require this addition to their distinctive charac ters, as a full presentation of them would have added much more to the size of the volume. The best work on the subject, and one containing many original observa tions, is the excellent Mineralogy of DesCloizeaux, the first volume of which, on the Silicates, was published in 1862. The second, unfortunately for the science, has not yet appeared. Other works in this department are Brooke & Miller's Mineralogy (1852) ; Grailich's Vienna edition of Miller's Crystallography (1856), and his own Krystallographisch-optische Untersuchungen (1858). In classification, the general system remains unaltered. It is based on a compre hensive view of the characters of minerals as species in the inorganic kingdom of nature, the preeminence being given to chemical, the next place to crystallographic, the third to the different physical characters. The author believes (after having tried the so-called natural history system of Mohs for two editions) that light from no source should be shut out where the relations of species and groups in nature are to be determined. As in the preceding edition, the method avoids almost entirely the distinction, in most cases wrong, founded on the fact osthe base in oxygen ternaiies or salts being in the protoxyd state, or in the sesquioxyd, or in both combined, and proceeds on the ground that the basic elements in these and the other different states are mutually replaceable in certain proportions determined by their combining power with oxygen. But while the progress of chemistry and the kindred sciences requires no modification of the general plan of the classification, but gives it new support, it has rendered many minor changes necessary, and some that are of much importance. The historical inquiries above alluded to were prompted by a desire to place the nomenclature of mineralogy on a permanent basis. They were incident to a search after a reason for choosing one name rather than another from among the number that stand as claimants. Part of the existing diversity is due to national partiality, and much of it to indifference. It has become somewhat common for authors to select the name they like best without reference to authority, or to reject an old for"], [13, "PREFACE. V a new one on no other ground thau that of their preference. Increasing confusion in nomenclature has consequently attended the recent progress of the science ; and in view of this fact the novel expedient has been tried of endeavoring to escape the confusion by adding one more to the number of names. The right method is mani festly that which has proved so successful in the other natural sciences, viz., the recognition, under proper restrictions, of the law of priority ; and this method the author has aimed to carry out. Moreover, it has seemed best that the science should not only have a system of nomenclature, but should also stand by it ; that, accordingly, the termination .?.., which is prominently chemical, should be left to the chemists, and that other miscellaneous endings should, as far as possible, be set aside, or be made to conform to the system. With this in view, changes have been made in accordance with the principles explained in the course of the remarks beyond on Nomenclature. In the preparation of this volume, the author owes much to the cooperation of his friend, Prof. George J. Brush. Prof. Brush has had sole charge of the blowpipe department. The pyrognostic characters have been entirely rewritten by him ; and while he has had the works of Plattner and von Kobell always at hand, he has, for much the larger part of the species, made personal trials of the reactions before writing them out ; so that, although the facts stated are not generally new, they still are mostly from his own observations. His skill also in analytical chemistry, and his thorough knowledge of minerals, have enabled him to remove doubts, afford aid and advice, and furnish new facts, on various points throughout the progress of the work. Prof. Brush has also given the proofs, while the work was in the press, the benefit of his revision. I take pleasure also in acknowledging the assistance of Prof. George F. Barker of this city, an excellent chemist in both the old and new systems, during the last six months before the book went to press ; and later, that of Sydney H. Smith, assistant in the zoological department of Yale College.

Among works consulted, the publications on chemical mineralogy of Rammelsberg of Berlin, and especially his Mineralchemie, have afforded great assistance. The very full and able Annual Reports (or Uebersichte) of Dr. Kenngott of Zurich, on"], [14, "PREFACE. VI the progress of mineralogy from 1844 to 1861, and those of the Giessen Jahresbe richt, have been freely and constantly consulted. Much use has been made also of the mineralogical works of DesCloizeaux, Dufrenoy, Hausmann, Breithaupt, Naumann, Haidinger, von Kobell, Kokscharof, Hessenberg, Quenstedt, Brooke & Miller, Greg & Lettsom, and Shepard ; also the valuable History (Geschichte) of Mineralogy of von Kobell ; the classical work on the Precious Stones and Gems of the Ancients by King ; and the various recent American Geological Reports. Among these Reports, the volume of the Canadian survey for the year 1863, containing extended mineralogical contributions by Prof. T. S. Hunt, deserves special mention. A full list of the works consulted in studying up the history of the species, and the later progress of the science, is to be found on pages xxxv to xiv of the Introduction. In Crystallography, the sources of recent information have been mainly Kokscha rof's Mineralogie Russlands, and his Memoirs in the Bulletin of the St. Petersburg Academy ; DesCloizeaux's Mineralogie, and various Memoirs ; the Mineralogische Notizen of F. Hessenberg, of which eight parts have appeared ; Naumann's and Quenstedt's works on Mineralogy ; the Memoirs of Zippe, von Zepharovich, Grai lich, A. Schrauf, v. Lang, Zirkel, and Kenngott, in the Berichte and Denkschrif ten (mostly the former) of the Vienna Academy ; of Dauber, G. Rose, vom Rath, Schroder, Schabus, in Poggendorff's Annalen; of Websky and vom Rath, in the Zeitschrift of the German Geological Society at Berlin ; of A. E. Nordenskiold, in the \u0152fversigt of the Swedish Academy ; of Quintino Sella, in his Studii, and in the publications of the Turin Academy ; of Miller, v. Lang, Maskelyne, aud Greg, in the Philosophical Magazine ; of Prof. J. P. Cooke, in the American Journal of Science. The Mineralogy of Brooke & Miller (1852) has been freely used agaiD, as in the preparation of the preceding edition. This volume would probably be more acceptable to some chemists if the formulas on the old system were rejected altogether. But chemistry has not advanced so far on the new road, but that most mineralogical papers are still written as if there were no new system, and a large part of chemists would understand the constitution of the species better from the old formulas than from the new. Moreover, the great majority of the persons who consult a Mineralogy would find the new formulas and new ter minology quite unintelligible. It has seemed reasonable therefore that both systems should be presented. The new formulas will be more easily understood or learned from their association with the old, and thus the book may help forward the views it only partially adopts. The past history of the work evinces no aversion to change where the progress of science requires it. This work has been posted up, as far as was possible, to the date of publication. The facts which have come to hand too late for their proper place in the volume, are inserted in a Supplement. And it is proposed to make this the first of a series of supplements to appear from time to time in the American Journal of Science. April 30, 1868. JAMES D- DANA* From the Preface to the First Edition (1837) ***** -phe classification of the mineral species, which is here adopted, is strictly a Natural Arrangement. The superiority of this method is exhibited in the body of the work, and in connection with the remarks on Chemical Classifica tions, in Appendix B. Although founded by Mohs on the external characters of minerals, it exhibits, in a considerable degree, the chemical relations of the species \u2022 and those who are accustomed to prefer a chemical arrangement will probably per ceive that, in addition to such qualities as appear to recommend the chemical method it possesses other advantages not less important."], [15, "VII PREFACE. The changes which have been made in the nomenclature of minerals appear to be demanded by the state of the Science. The present names, excepting those pro posed by Mohs, are utterly devoid of system, unless we may consider such the addition of the syllable ite to words of various languages ; and even this glimmering of system has been capriciously infringed by a French mineralogist of much celebrity ; \u2014 they seldom designate any quality or character peculiar to the mineral ; neither do they exhibit any of the general relations of the species, by which the mind may, at a glance, discover their natural associations, and be assisted in obtaining a com prehensive view of the science. On the contrary, they are wholly independent, and often worse than unmeaning, appellatives, and are only tolerable in a very unadvanced state of the Science. As a necessary consequence of this looseness of nomenclature, most of the species are embarrassed with a large number of synonyms, a fertile source of confusion and difficulty. As a remedy for this undesirable state of things, a system of nomenclature, con structed on the plan so advantageously pursued in Botany and Zoology, was proposed by the author in the fourth volume of the Annals of the New York Lyceum. The necessity for something of the kind is very apparent, and the author trusts that it will not be considered a needless innovation. ****** From the Preface to the Second Edition *(1844). The natural system adopted in this Treatise has received such modifications in the present edition as were demanded by the advanced state of the Science ; and the systematic nomenclature has required some corresponding changes. Besides the natural classification, another, placing the minerals under the princi pal element in their composition, has been given in Part VII. ; and various improve ments on the usual chemical methods have been introduced, which may render it acceptable to those that prefer that mode of arrangement. * * * * From the Preface to the Third Edition (1850). This Treatise, in the present edition, has undergone so various and extensive alter ations, that few of its original features will be recognized. The science of Mineralogy has made rapid progress in the past six years ; chemistry has opened to us a better knowledge of the nature and relations of compounds ; and philosophy has thrown new light on the principles of classification. To change is always seeming fickleness. But not to change with the advance of science, is worse ; it is persistence in error ; and, therefore, notwithstanding the former adoption of what has been called the Natural History System, and the pledge to its support given by the author in sup plying it with a Latin nomenclature, the whole system, its classes, orders, genera, and Latin names, have been rejected ; and even the trace of it which the synonymy might perhaps rightly bear has been discarded. The system has subserved its pur pose in giving precision to the science, and displaying many of the natural group ings which chemistry was slow to recognize. But there are errors in its very foun dation which make it false to nature in its most essential points ; and, in view of the character of these errors, we are willing it should be considered a relic of the past. Yet Science is far from being ready with an acceptable substitute. Most chemical systems have been more artificial than the \" natural\" system ; and doubts now hang * This edition, failing to find a publisher in New York, was printed at the expense of the author."], [16, "VIII PREFACE. over some of the principles of chemistry that are widest in their influence on classi fication. In view of the difficulties on either side, it was a point long questioned, whether to venture upon a classification that might be deemed most accordant with truth among the many doubts that surround the subject ; or to adopt one less strict to science, that might serve the convenience of the student for easy reference, and for the study of mineralogy in its economical bearings, while, at the same time, i. should exhibit many natural relations, and inculcate no false affiliations or distinc tions of species. The latter alternative has been adopted ;-the classification is oftered simply as a convenient arrangement, and not an exhibition of the true affini ties of species iu the highest sense of the term. Among the Silicates, however, it will be perceived that the groupings in the main are natural groupings ; and, througn out the work, special care has been taken to inculcate, as far as possible, tne^true relations of species, both by remarks, and by an exhibition of them in tables. From the Preface to the Fourth Edition (1854). In the Preface to the last edition of this Treatise, the classification of minerals then adopted was announced as only a temporary expedient. The system ot Moes, valuable in its day, had subserved its end; and in throwing ofi its shackles tor the more consistent principles flowing from recent views in Chemistry, the many diffi culties in the way of perfecting a new classification led the author to an arrange ment which should \" serve the convenience of the student without pretending to fitnot SC_.6__.CG A classification on chemical principles was however proposed in the latter part of the volume, in which the Berzelian method was coupled with crystallography in a manner calculated to display the relations of species in composition as well as form, and prominently \"exhibit the various cases of isomorphism and pleomorphism among minerals.\" The progress of Science has afforded the means of giving greater precision and simplicity to this arrangement, until now it seems entitled to become the authorized method\" of a System of Mineralogy. Whether regarded from a phy sical or chemical point of view, the groupings appear in general to be a faithful exhibition of the true affinities of the species. The mind uneducated in Science may revolt at seeing a metallic mineral, as galena, side by side with one of unmetallic lustre, as blende ; and some systems, in accordance with this prejudice, place these species in separate orders. Like the jeweller, without as good reason, the same works have the diamond and sapphire in a common group. But it is one of the sublime lessons taught in the very por tals of Chemistry, that nature rests no grand distinctions on lustre, hardness, or color, which are mere externals, and this truth should be acknowledged by the min eralogist rather than defied. Others, while recognizing the close relations of the carbonates of lime, iron, zinc, and manganese (calcite, spathic iron, smithsonite, and dialogite), or of the silicates of lime, iron, manganese (wollastonite, augite, rhodo nite), are somewhat startled by finding silicate of zinc, or silicate of copper, among the silicates of the earths, or of other oxyds. But the distinction of \" useful \" and \" useless \" or of \" ores \" and \" stones,\" although bearing on \" economy,\" is not Science.' ********"], [17, "TABLE OF CONTENTS. Introduction.

The object of this introduction is to supply such tables and information as will make the work convenient for use ; and, toward this end, some explanations of an elementary character are included, with special reference to readers not familiar with chemistry and other collateral sciences. 1. General Scheme of Arrangement in the Descriptions. \u2022In the Descriptions of Species, the characteristics are mentioned in the following order : \u2014 1, Crystalline Form and Structure ; 2, Hardness, Specific Gravity, Lustre, Color, Diaphaneity, etc. ; 3, Varieties, Chemical Composition ; 4, Pyrognostic and other Chemical characters ; 5, under the head of Observations, Geological position, Localities, Mineral associates, etc. ; 6, Altered forms ; 7, Artificial and Furnace products. 2. Chemistry, 1. A barred letter in a symbol of an element, in the table of atomic weights which follows, and also throughout the work (except in formulas after the new system, see 'p. xv), signifies two atoms of the element : e. g., __1=2 Al or Al2. 2. Dots over a symbol stand each for an- atom of oxygen in the compound referred to: e.g., Sl=2Al+3 O, or APO3; and _5a=BaO. 3. The atomic weight of a compound equals the sum of the atomic weights of its constituents : e. g., for SI, the atomic weight=2 x 13-75+3 x 8=51-5 ; for Ba,= 68-5 + 8=76-5 ; for SI gi, the atomic weight=51*5 + 30=81-5. 4. The atomic ratio for the constituents of a compound is the ratio between the number of atoms of the same : e. g., for the aluminum and oxygen in SI, it is 2 : 3 ; for the alumina and silica in SI Si it is 1 : 1, there being 1 of alumina to 1 of silica ; for the aluminum, silicon, and oxygen in SI Si, it is 2:1:5, there being in the compound 2 of aluminum, 1 of silicon, and 5 of oxygen (5 dots). 5. The oxygen ratio for the constituents of an oxygen compound is the ratio between the number of atoms of oxygen in the different oxygen compounds present : e. g., the O. ratio for the alumina and silica in SI gi is 3 : 2, alumina containing 3 O and silica 2 0; for the magnesia and silica in Mg gi, the O. ratio is 1 : 2. 6. The percentage ratio (or number of parts in 100) for the constituents of a compound is deduced from the ratio between the atomic weight of the compound and that of each constituent: .. g., as 51-5 of alumina contain 24 of oxygen, so 100 will contain 46-6; or, for the percentage of aluminum, 51'5 : 27-5 : : 100 : 53-4 ; again, as 81-5 SI Si contain 30 of silica, hence 81-5 : 30 : : 100 : the silica in the compound, etc. ; or since SI Si contain 27-5 Al + 14-0 Si+40-0 O, making in all as before 81-5, hence 81-5 : 27-5 : : 100 : the p. c. of aluminum ; or 81-5 : 40 : : 100 : the p. c. of oxygen; etc."], [20, "TABLE OF ATOMIC WEIGHTS.

The percentage qf oxygen in each of the oxygen compounds enumerated in the preceding table of atomic weights is stated in parentheses after the atomic weight of the compound ; and the percentage of sulphur, in the same manner, after the atomic weight of many of the sulphids. 7. The atomic ratio is calculated from the percentage ratio, by dividing each number by the atomic weight of the constituent : the percentage ratio of Al and 0 in alumina being 53*4 : 46*6, 53*4-^1 3*75 gives 3*93, and 46*9-^8=5*85 ; whence the ratio 3*93 : 5*85, which, by dividing the larger by the smaller, is found to equal 1 : 1-5 or 2 : 3, which is the atomic ratio of the aluminum to the oxygen. For the compound SI Si, the percentage of silica and alumina is 36-8, 63-2 ; whence, dividing the former by 30 (at. w. of silica), and the latter by 51*5 (at. w. of alumina), the ratio obtained is 1 : 1, the compound consisting of 1 of each alumina and silica ; or taking the percentage for the silicon, aluminum, and oxygen in the same, and dividing them, respectively, by 14, 13*75, 8, the ratio deduced would be 1 : 2 : 5. 8. The ratio of alumina and silica in a compound may also be obtained by com paring the amounts of oxygen in the percentages of the constituents. Take, e. g., a silicate of alumina consisting of Si 36-8, SI 63-2=100. If 100 of silica contain 53-33 of oxygen (see table) then 36-8 will contain 36*8 X -5333 or 19*625 (since 100 : 36*8 : : 53*33 : the required percentage) ; so if 100 of alumina contain 46*6 of oxygen, 63*2 will contain 46*6x*632 or 29*45; now 19*625 : 29*45 (the ratio obtained)=2 : 3 ; and since silica contains 2 of oxygen and alumina 3, it follows from the result of the calculation that the compound contains 1 of sihca to 1 of alumina, or has the formula SI Si. This is the usual method of calculating the ratio of the constituents in the case of oxyds. It involves multiplications of the percent age of each of the constituents by the percentage of oxygen for that constituent ; and in order to facilitate these multiplications a table is given below the table of atomic weights, containing multiples of these oxygen percentages for each of the digits 1 to 9. 9. The letter R is used as a general symbol for any element ; R, for protoxyds in general ; fi, for sesquioxyds in general. 10. In the formula 3 Ca2 Si + SF Si3, the prefix 3 applies to the whole Ca2 Si (or, in general, to all before the first comma, or first + or \u2014 ) ; but the small ' only to Ca, it signifying 2 Ca; and, in the second part, the small 2 signifies that there are 2 SI, and the small 3, 3 Si. The oxygen ratio for the Ca and Si in the first part is 1 : 1, there being 2 Ca to 1 Si, 2 Ca as well as 1 Si containing 2 O ; and in the second part it is 1 : 1, there being 2 SI to 3 Si. The oxygen ratio for the whole Ca, SI, si in the formula is 6 : 6 : 12=1 : 1 : 2 ; and for the Ca + SI, Si it is 1 + 1 : 2 or 1 : 1. In tbe formula (i Ca3 + | SI)2 si3, the index * signifies 2 of all within the paren thesis. The oxygen ratio of the part in the parenthesis is 1 : 1, there being J. Ca3 to i SI ; the O. ratio for Ca, SI, Si, in the formula, is 1 : 1 : 2 ; and for Ca+Sl, Si it is 1 : 1. Thus the two formulas here explained express identically the same consti tution. There are many compounds allied to the above, for example : (t-Mg3+-J- SI)2 Si3 (\u00a3 Fe3+\u00a3S1)2 Si3, (i Mg3-|-\u00a3 Pe)2 gi3, etc. The symbol R is used, in the manner above explained, in writing a general formula for the group containing these and other re lated compounds; as (| Rs-f | fi)2 Si3. So fi C is a general symbol for any carbonate of a protoxyd \u2014 whether of lime, magnesia, oxyd of zinc, or any other base. 11. In the preceding table, and throughout this volume, except under the sulphur compounds, As, Sb, Bi, Ni, P, in formulas under the old system, would be more correctly written As2, Sb2, Bi\u00bb, Ni., P., or As, Sb, Bi, Ni, P. The atomic weights of these elements in the table are double the value which is often given them in the ,old system."], [23, "INTBODUCTION. XV 12. Binary compounds are those consisting of elements of two kinds, those of one kind negative to the other : e. g., magnesia, Mg O, consisting of magnesium and oxygen ; water, H 0 ; silicic acid, or silica, Si O2 ; pyrite, Fe S2. Ternary compounds (called also salts and double binaries) consist of elements of three kinds, (l) basic, (2) acidic, (3) acidise. Thus a silicate of lime and magnesia (or calcium and magnesium) contains (1) calcium aud magnesium, (2) silicon, (3) oxygen; sulphate of lead contains (1) lead, (2) sulphur, (3) oxygen; the sulphanti monite, jamesonite, contains (1) lead and iron, (2) antimony, (3) sulphur. 13. Polymeres are distinct substances that are atomically multiples of a common type. Thus the compounds 2 O H2, 3 e H2, 4 O H2 (generally written 62 H4, O3 H6, \u00a94 H8), are polymeres of 0 H2. 14. The following principle is of great importance in connection with the chemical constitution of inorganic compounds, and although explained briefly elsewhere (pp. 1-3 and 202), deserves to be formally stated in this place : The replacing power of the elements is in proportion to their combining power, this combining power being reckoned in number of atoms of oxygen (or sulphur, or the acidific element, whatever it may be). The line A, below, contains the formulas of the different kinds of oxyds ; B, the same, divided each by its number of atoms of oxygen (that is, severally, for the suc cessive members, by 1, 3, 2, 5, 3, 7, 4), by which division they are reduced to the protoxyd form ; C, the basic elements without the oxygen : A. RO R203 RO2 B. RO R-0 R-0 C. R Rf Ri R20s RO3 R207 RO4 RlO R^O R^O E\u00a30 Rl Bi B?- Bi 2. L According to the above law, the R, R3, R2, etc., in the last line are mutually replace able, 1 for 1, although in atomic weight there is a variation from 1 to \\. They represent different states in which elements may exist, and have, to a certain extent, independent element-like relations. In some cases, as in iron, four of these states are represented in a single element, the compounds (1) Fe 0, Fe S, (2) Fe2 O3, (3) Fe S2, (4) Fe O9, containing this metal in the four states Fe, Fe3, Fe^, Fe3. These different states of elements are best designated in the symbol by the letters of the Greek alphabet, as thus the confusion arising from the conflicting numbers for atomic weights and combining relations are avoided. The above lines A, B, C, thus written, will become : A. _RO 3/.R0 2.R0 5.R0 3.R0 T^RO 4.R0 B. _R0 \u00c6RO yRO .RO _RO |RO .RO .RO -RO \u00a3RO -iRO C. _R i-R yR -B tR _B *>R In each table the line B is like C, except in the addition of 0 ; and the line A is equivalent to B multiplied for the successive members by the number of atoms of oxygen in the oxyds, that is, severally, by 1, 3, 2, 5, 3, 7, 4. Examples of the use of these symbols are unnecessary here, as they occur on the pages referred to, and throughout the volume. 15. In the statements of analyses throughout this volume, the use of brackets enclosing figures implies that the substance referred to was determined by the loss. New System of Chemistry. In the new system of Chemistry many of the elements have their atomic weights of double the value given in the preceding table, and their symbols are accordingly written with a barred letter, as follows :"], [24, "XVI -NTKODUCTION. 16.

In the combinations between elements of the former series occur, hydrogen being taken as the unit, the ratios 1 : 1, 1 : 3, 1 : 5 ; and, with reference to the odd numbers 1, 3, 5, these elements are called perissads. While in the combinations between elements of the latter series occur, taking the same unit, the ratios 2 : 2, 2 : 4, 2 : 6 ; and these, in view of the even numbers, are called artiads. The words \u25a0TTSpirfo-og- and api*ioj were the words for odd and even numbers in ancient arithmetic. 18. As oxygen is one of the doubled elements, a protoxyd of a perissad must con tain 2 of the latter ; and water, accordingly, has the formula H.0, potash K20, soda Na20, etc. But the protoxyds of elements osthe other series have simply the sym bols Mg 0 for magnesia, \u00a9a 0 for lime, etc. 19. In the formulas of the salts, or ternaries, instead of dividing the oxygen between the acidific and basic elements (thus making the acid and base in the com pound distinct, as in the old system), the symbol of each of the elements is placed separately. Thus, Mg2 Si becomes Si _t_g2 04 ; or, in the method of writing adopted in this work, Si||04|_\u00c6g_. 20. It is held that iu some classes of compounds only part of the oxygen serves to unite the acidic element (Si) to the basic. For example, for Mg Si the for mula is Si 0|]0_||Mg, only two of the three of oxygen being regarded as uniting oxy gen. To explain : 20. As silicon combines with 20, and 20 are equivalent to 4 H ; and magnesia, or any protoxyd, with 10, which equals 2 H ; the combining character of silicon is repre-"], [25, "INTRODUCTION. XVII H H , \\ / sensed by Si , and that of magnesium by H \u2014 Mg \u2014 II, silicon having four bonds of H H attraction (being therefore a tetrad), and magnesium two (it being a dyad). Combi H HH \u2022 , , \\ /\u2022 X nmg the two makes Si Mg. Substituting 0 for 2 II in the diagram, it becomes 0 / \\ / / \\ H HH 0=Si Mg ; in which only two 0 unite the Mg and Si, one 0 being combined 9 alone with the Si. Hence the form osthe above formula, Si0|0.|Mg. If the silica is combined with two of magnesia (using the language of the old sys tem), the diagram becomes HH HH 0 0 / \\ / \\ /\\/\\ Mg Si Mg ; and, substituting oxygen as before, Mg Si Mg. Here HH HH 0 0 all the oxygen is uniting oxygen, and the formula is accordingly Si|04||Mg2. 21. The number of atoms of uniting oxygen is equal to the number of bonds of attraction in the basic or acidic element, according as the former or latter has the smaller number. If, in the case of a compound containing one of silica, the base is one of a protoxyd (on the old system), there are two bonds of attraction in the prot oxyd, and therefore 02 is the uniting oxygen, one 0 remaining with the Si. If the base is two of a protoxyd there are four bonds of attraction in the basic element (as well as the acidic), and the uniting oxygen is 04. If the base is three of a protoxyd, or one of a sesquioxyd, the silica then has the smaller number of bonds of attraction, namely but four, and the uniting oxygen will be 04, the rest being united with the basic element and not the silicon ; and it cannot exceed this, however much the amount of base be increased, it being determined by the greatest number of bonds of attraction common to the two, the basic and acidic elements. With two of silica the bonds of attraction will be eight, and so on. 22. The rule above given may be also stated in terms of the oxygen of the base and acid in the old system : the number of atoms of uniting oxygen is double the number of atoms of oxygen of the base, unless the number of atoms of the base is greater than that of the acid ; and in this latter case it is double the number of atoms of oxygen in the acid. In the former case the formula should have the non-uniting 0 after the symbol of the acidic element (after Si in a silicate, S in a sulphate, etc.) ; in the latter, it is written after that of the basic element. In the former, the acidic element makes the left part of the formula ; in the latter the formula is turned about, and it makes the right part. See for examples of the latter, p. 362. 23. For the sulphur, selenium, and tellurium compounds (that is, sulphids, etc.), the formulas are like those of the oxygen compounds, except that S, Se, or Te is substituted for 0. So also for ternary fluorids. In some oxygen compounds (topaz, etc.) 0 is replaced in part by Fa (or, as the symbol for fluorine may then be written, P) ; aud in a few others, by CL. 24. In the new system the expressions on p. xv, /5R, -yR, <5R, -R, etc., become j_R, yR, SR, -R ; or, in the case of perissads, /ER2, 7R., etc. As, Ss, and B of the old system become As2 03, and B2 03 in the new, and As and B are not monads, these formulas are equivalent under the new system to 3 0As 0, 3 0B 0. 25.

But this formula contains the fiction of 2R in Ra 03 ; when, in fact, while there are 2 R in atomic weight, there are actually 3 R in replacing power, as already explained (p. xv). Some additional sign is therefore required to make the formula tell the truth, and this is afforded either by adding other numbers to the barred letters, or by the use of the Greek letters as here adopted. 30.

In the descriptions of the physical characters of minerals, H. stands for hard ness, and G. for specific gravity. 2. The scale of hardness is as follows, crystallized varieties of the minerals men tioned being meant : 1, Talc ; 2, Gypsum ; 3, Calcite ; 4, Fluorite ; 5, Apatite ; 6, Orthoclase ; 7, Quartz ; 8, Topaz ; 9, Corundum ; 10, Diamond. 3. In crystallized minerals of the Isometric system, the physical characters are the same in the directions of the three axes, and in the directions of lines situated sym metrically with reference to these axes. In the Tetragonal and Hexagonal systems, these characters in a vertical direction differ from those in a horizontal or transverse. The optical axis has the direction of the vertical axis. 4. In crystals of the remaining systems there are two axes of polarization. A line bisecting the acute, or the obtuse, angle between these optical axes is called a bisec trix ; that bisecting the acute angle is the acute bisectrix, or the bisectrix, as the term is employed in the descriptions beyond ; that bisecting the obtuse angle (and which is at right angles to the acute) is the obtuse or conjugate bisectrix. 5. In the Orthorhombic system, the two bisectrices are parallel _o the crystallo graphic axes ; and, consequently, the plane of the optical axes (the optic-axial plane) is parallel to one of the diametric sections of the crystal, and is at right angles to the other two. By a diametric plane or section, as here used, is meant a plane passing througl any two of the crystallographic axes ; that is, one through each a and b, a and c, o: b and c. 6. In mineral species, the position of the bisectrix is constant, or nearly so, while the optic-axial angle often varies widely. The angles mentioned in the description: are those taken in the air, unless it is otherwise stated. 7. Under Blowpipe characters, B.B. stands for before the blowpipe; O.F. fo: oxydizing flame ; R.F. for reducing flame. A closed tube is a small glass tube closec at one end."], [29, "INTRODUCTION. XXI The following is the scale of fusibility adopted (that of von Kobell) : 1, Gray Antimony ; 2, Natrolite ; 3, Almandine (var. of garnet) ; 4, Green Actinolite 5, Orthoclase ; 6, Bronzite. 4. Crystallography. 1. The systems of crystallization are as follows : 1. Having the axes equal. The Isometric system. 2. Having only the lateral axes equal. The Tetragonal and Hexagonal. 3. Having the axes unequal. The Orthorhombic, Monoclinic, and Triclinic, The names Monometric, Dimetric, and Trimetric, used in former editions of this work, have been set aside for the above for two reasons: (1) the fact that the names want precision, the"], [30, "XXII INTRODUCTION. hexagonal system being as much dimelric as the tetragonal, and the monoclinic and triclinic as much irimeiric as the orthorhombic ; (2) the desire to promote uniformity in the language of science. The names employed appear to be the best that have been proposed, and those most generally used ; aud hence those that have the best claim for universal adoption. A. Isometric System. 2. Some of the simpler isometric forms are represented in figures 1 to 50. Fig. 1, a cube (with three equal axes) ; 2, an octahedron (or regu lar octahedron) ; 3, a dodecahedron (or rhombic dodecahedron) ; 4, 5, combination of cube and dodecahedron ; 6, 7, cubo-octahedron ; 8, combination of octahedron and dodecahedron (by noting the lettering, like planes being lettered alike through out, the several combinations are easily read off); 10, a trapezohedron (24-faced solid); 15, id., another variety; 31, a tetrahedron; 47, 48, the pentagonal dodeca hedron in different positions. 3.

Fig. 50 represents a common twin or compound crystal in the isometric system ; and 50a illustrates that it corresponds to an octa hedron cut across the middle parallel to an octahedral face, with one half revolved 60 or 180 degrees. B. Tetragonal System. (Also called Quadratic, Pyramidal, Monodi metric, Dimetric, Zwei-und-einaxige.) 5. In the Tetragonal system 50a the lateral axes (b) are equal, being the diameters or diagonals of a square, while the vertical (a) is either longer or shorter than the lateral. 6. Owing to the square form, the planes of a kind are in fours or eights. The like planes on the four solid angles make a 4-sided pyramid, and those of the two extremities combined a square octahedron. For any species one such octahedron may be assumed to have the vertical axis la ; and then the other octahedral planes on the same angles, with shorter or longer vertical axes, have the vertical axis a mul tiple or submultiple of a ; as \\a, \\a, etc., 2a, fa, 3a, etc. ; and the planes of such octahedrons are accordingly lettered 1, \u25a0$-, -J-, 2, f, 3, etc. 7. So again like planes on the four edges of each base make an octahedron, but of an intermediate series, called the diametric, the planes being parallel to a lateral axis or diagonal. The vertical axis varies by simple ratios, as in the other series ; but in the lettering, as the planes are parallel to a lateral axis (and would therefore meet it only at an infinite distance), this parallelism is expressed by adding the letter i, initial of infinity. Thus %-i, 1-i, 2-i, 3-i, etc. 8. With the lengthening of the octahedron in each series, the numeral becomes larger and larger, until the octahedron is merged in a vertical square prism, its planes parallel to the vertical axis. This parallelism, expressed by the letter . again, as just explained, gives for the lettering of the square prism of the first or fundamental series, i or _Z~; and for that osthe second or diametric, i-i. The figures on pages 277, 273, are examples of these forms, and also of the double 8-sided pyramids and 8-sided prisms which occur in this system. 9. The angles between the planes on the vertical edges and /, or i-i, are the same as those having similar symbols in the isometric system, noting only this difference in the lettering, that 0 in the cube is i-i in the square prism ; thus 0 A i-2 in the cube or other isometric form is the same with i-i a i-2 in the tetragonal system ; and so on. 10. The length osthe vertical axis a is calculated from the supplement (S) of the angle O a \\-i. A line drawn vertically on the plane 1-i (f. 260, p. 277), that is, at right angles to the lower or upper side, is the hypothenuse of a right-angled triangle, the basal side of which triangle is parallel to a lateral axis b, and the vertical parallel to the vertical axis a. These sides have the ratios, therefore, of the two axes ; and taking _-=unity, \u00ab=tan A (or angle of triangle at base, or opposite a). This angle A equals the supplement of O a 1-i ; and therefore, calling this supplement S, a=tan S. 11. The value of the axis may also be obtained from the supplement ($') of the angle O a 1, by the equation : a=tan S'^r-sec 45\u00b0 ; whence log a=log tan /_?'\u25a0\u00ab\u2014 10*1505150 C. Hexagonal System. 12. This system differs from the Tetragonal in havino three equal lateral axes (b) instead of two ; the vertical (a) is at right angles to the lateral (fig. A). 13. In the Hexagonal section of the system the symmetry of the crystals is by sixes and twelves, as in figs. A to D ; f. 440, p. 530 ; 'f. 527, p. 627. In f. B, 1 cor responds to a hexagonal pyramid of the fundamental series, and 1-2, A-2, 2-2, to similar pyramids osthe intermediate series; I is the hexagonal prism of the former series, and i-2 that of the intermediate prism, /a 7=1 20\u00b0, /a .-2=150\u00b0, i--i,\\%-2, ov. 7,=120\u00b0. 14. In the Rhombohedral section of the system, the planes 1, 2, 3, \\, etc., are"], [33, "INTRODUCTION. XXV planes of rhombohedrons, having for the vertical axis la, 2a, 3a, \\a, etc., la being the value of the axis in the fundamental rhombohedron, (R) (figs., p. 6). Tlie angle of a rhombohedron mentioned is always that over a terminal edo-e, as that between the upper planes R of figure 141, p. 141. On gradually shortening the rhom bohedron in fig. 141, it may become \u00a3_., \\R, and so on, till the length becomes 0, and the rhombohedron is reduced to a flat plane. Hence, starting from this plane (which corresponds to the basal plane ofthe rhombohedron or hexagonal prism), the rhombohedron as it elongates reaches the form of fig. 141 ; and continuing the elongation, the vertical axis doubles, trebles, and so on, till finally it becomes infinite, and the rhombohedron is then a six-sided prism. If a diminution in length now commences by planes inclined to the opposite extremities of the vertical axis, these planes correspond to another series of rhombohedrons which are distinguished by a minus ( \u2014 ). The planes 0 -J. .1. .2.. .7 (or oo ) ....\u2014 2..\u2014 1..\u2014 i 0, lie in a single vertical zone. Figs. 550, 551, p. 679, represent the forms R, \u2014_-, -2, -i>4'13- 15. The value ofthe vertical axis a is obtained from the supplement: Of 0 A 1-2 (S) by the equation a=tan S. Of 0A1 (\u00a3') by the equation a=tan -S'-^sec 30\u00b0. The latter gives log \u201e=log tan *S\" \u2014 10-0624694. D. Orthorhombic System. (Also called Rectangular, Prismatic, Trimetric, Ein und-einaxige.) 16. In the Orthorhombic system the three axes are unequal and inter sect at right angles ; and the three diametric planes, < -\u25a0 those containing the axes, are consequently rectangulaB The annexed figure represents a rectangular pri *->l with repjaced edges and angles. 17. a, b, c, are the axes, of which a is the vertical, ZH the shorter lateral or brachydiagonal, c the longer lateraB or macrodiagonal. 0 is the basal plane of the prism fl i-l the larger lateral plane, parallel to the longer : I axis ; i-i the smaller lateral plane, parallel to the shorte-rU 18. / are planes on the edges of the rectangular pii-mM which when extended would form a vertical rhombicM prism, having its axes b and <:\u25a0 in the ratio of 16 : Lc.H It is therefore the unit or fundamental vertical prism. 19. 1-1 are planes parallel to the longer lateral axis,M anil having for the axes a, b, the ratio lo : lb; extendedM Qpwards they form a dome (so named from domus, aH house), which is called the macrodome.

These two domes are therefore the unit domes. Their summit angles are of course supplements of their basal angles (or those over the vertical planes i-i, i-i). 20. If the axis 6=1 ; half the obtuse angle of the prism I be called X; half the summit angle of the macrodome 1-5, T, and half the basal of the same Z ; then we have for the values of the other axes a and c : a=cot P=tan Z. c=tan X. Further, X=i-i a 7\u201490\u00b0 ; Y= 0 A 14 \u2014 90\u00b0 ; __=.-. A 1-5 \u2014 90' 20. The planes 1 on the eight angles are planes of an octahedron, having for the axes a, b, c, the ratio la : 16 : lc. It is therefore the unit or fundamental octahe dron (1). Its pyramidal edges, if\" the octahedron were completed (as in f. 55, p. 20), would be of two kinds, two at each extremity opposite to the axis c, the longer lateral axis, and two opposite to 6, the shorter lateral axis. The former is the macrodiagonal edge, the latter the brachydiagonal. 21. By doubling the length of the vertical axis, the lateral being fixed, we form the octahedron 2 ; by trebling it, the octahedron 3 ; by halving it, the octahedron |- ; and so for the domes, doubling the vertical axis we have the dome 2-. or 2-. ; by halving the same, the dome \\-i or 1%-i, and so on. The letter i, as before explained, stands for infinity, and means that the plane is parallel to one of the axes ; ., that it is parallel to the longer lateral axis ; i, that it is parallel to the shorter lateral axis : . or I alone, or as the initial letter in a symbol, signifies that the plane is parallel to the vertical axis. A plane i-i is parallel both to the vertical and longer lateral ; i-i, both to the vertical and shorter lateral. 22. The octahedrons alluded to above have for the axes 6, c, the ratio 16 : lc, and belong to what is called the fundamental series. But others may exist with different ratios for b and c, and any value for a. If the ratio for 6, c, is 16 : 2c, then, as c is the longer lateral axis, if the vertical axis is la, the octahedron is 1-2 ; or if the vertical axis is 3a, the plane is 3-2 ; or if \\a, it is \\-2. So for the ratio 36 : lc ; if the vertical axis is la, the octahedron is 1-3 ; or if 2a, it is 2-3 ; and if the vertical axis is infinite, the plane is parallel to the vertical axis, and the sym bol is i-%. The first figure or letter in these symbols always refers to the vertical axis, and the second to one of the lateral axes. 23. The planes may thus be viewed as lying in vertical zones, a different zone for every ratio of the lateral axes 6 : c. Each series, or zone, terminates above in the basal plane of the prism, for which a=0, and below in a vertical prism, for which a is infinite. By taking the planes i-i, iA, successively, for the basal plane O, there may be similar series of zones for each. The planes of a zone have their mutual intersections parallel to one another ; and wherever a series of planes exists having such parallel intersections, the series is called a zone. The small tables inserted in connection with the crystaUine forms of some of the species of this and other systems of crystallization (pp. 27, 35, 338) consist of the vertical zones of occurring planes. The planes of a vertical zone have mutual hori zontal intersections in the crystal. Consequently in a crystal not oblique the inclina tion of the basal plane, O, on any plane in a zone, subtracted from 270\u00b0, gives the inclination of the prismatic plane of the same zone on that plane, and the tangents of the supplemental angles of O on the planes of a zone vary as the coefficient of the vertical axis for each plane. Thus, suppose there are the planes l-l, 2-1, 3-., take the supplement of OAl-i (which, if Oa\\-i is 124\u00b0, equals 180\u00b0 \u2014 124\u00b0=56\u00b0); then the tangent of this angle, doubled, will be the tangent of the supplement of OA2-., and trebled, of the supplement of the angle of 0A3-J, The same for the"], [35, "INTRODUCTION. XXVII planes 1,2,3, or 1-2, 2-2, 3-2, and so on ; and if il be made the base, then in the same manner the angles maybe calculated for similar zones of planes terminating in i-l ; or if i-i be made the base, for zones of planes terminating similarly in i .. So if the angles are given, the relations of the axes may be calculated by reversing the process. 24. Making the brachydiagonal 6=uuity : a=tan. suppl. 0 a l-i; and calling the angle I a J, over i-l, X : c=tan %X. E. Monoclinic System. (Also called Hemiprismatic, Clinorhombic, Monoclinohe- dral, Zwei-und-eingliederige.) 25. In this system two of the axial intersections are rectangular, and one is oblique. In other words, the lateral axes are at right angles to one another ; but one is oblique to the vertical axis, and the other at right angles to it. 26. If figure E ou page xxv be taken as representing a monoclinic form in its usual position, then a will be the vertical axis ; 6 the inclined lateral, called the clino- diagonal ; c the other lateral, called the orthodiagonal. The angle a a b, or the inclination of the vertical axis, is called the angle C. 27. The section of the crystal in which 6, the clinodiagonal, and a lie is the clino- diagonal section ; and that in which c and a lie is the orthodiagonal section. The vertical plane i-l, of f. E, is parallel to the orthodiagonal section, and is lettered simply i-i ; and the plane iA, of the same figure, is parallel to the clinodiagonal section, and is lettered i-l. The angle OAi-i=C, or the inclination of the vertical axis; while Oa \u00ab-.=90\u00b0, and i-i A. -.=90\u00b0. The clinodiagonal section is the plane of symmetry. 28. The domes having the planes parallel to the clinodiagonal are called clinodomes, and are lettered with an accent over the i, thus, 1-i (l-i in f. E), 2-i. 29. The domes parallel to the orthodiagonal are hemidomes, the planes in front at Hop being unlike in inclination those in front below, each being a hemidome ; one series is opposite the acute intersection of the axes, and is the plus series, lettered 1-i, 2-i, etc. ; the other is opposite the obtuse, and is lettered -1-i, -2-i, etc. 30. The octahedral planes are all hemioctahedral, and + and \u2014 are used in the symbols in the same manner as in the symbols of the hemidomes. Thus in fig. E, if the angle between the upper 0 and the front plane i-i is obtuse, then the upper planes 1, 1, in front would be -1, -1, and the corresponding planes below, -f-1, +1, written usually 1, I. 31. If the clinodiagonal 6=1 ; half the front angle of the prism I (over i-i) be caUed X, half the. summit angle of the clinodome 1-i, X' ; the supplement of i-i a 1-i (= OAl-i \u2014 0) be called p.; and supplement of OAl-i be v; aud C be used as above explained ; then, c=sin C tan X. a=c-:r sin C tan __r'=sin v \u2014\u25a0 sin /x=sin ( C \u2014 p.) -H sin fi. F. Triclinic System. (Also called Doubly Oblique, Tetartoprismatic, Anorthic, Ein und-emgliederige.) 32. The three axes are unequal, and obliquely and unequally inclined. Angles of 90\u00b0 and 135\u00b0 are not met with in Triclinic crystals. Examples, figures on pp. 297, 338, 349. 33. The cry stall ographic symbols used in this work are essentially those of Nau mann, the author of the system of crystallography which is followed. The only dif ference is that i, the initial of infinity, is substituted for the symbol co, and the P is dropped,_it being in almost all cases unessential. Thus, P, 2P, iP2, \u0153Pco , \u0153P, ooP2, 3p2, of Naumann, are P or 1, 2, 4-2, i-i, i (or I), i-2, 3-2, of this work. And in the rhombohedral section of the hexagonal system, for R, 2R, BR, R\\ 2R\\ of Naumann, are here written, R, 2, 3, I3, 2\\ Moreover 0 or o is written for the basal plane. The distinction of capital or small letter in the symbols is mathemati cally of no importance. 34. In the orthorhombic system the shorter lateral axis is made the unit in this work. The axes are lettered a, 6, c, in different systems, except in that of MiUer (or"], [36, "properly Whewell's), who uses the letters h, I, k, as \" indices \" referring to the axes, in the order here written : Vertical. BrachydiagonaL Macrodiagonal. In this work abc In Naumann a c b In Weiss and Rose cab In Miller k I h For the tetragonal system the axes are the same, except that b=c. In the mono clinic : Vertical Clinodiagonal. OrthodiagonaL Naumann and this work abc Weiss and Rose cab Miller Jc I h The following are convenient simple rules for use in connection with crystallo graphic measurements and calculations : 35. If a plane, p, replaces the edge between any other two, s, t, making parallel intersections, the sum of the angles between p and the two planes s, t, equals 180 plus the inclination of s on t. If the planes s, t, meet at 90\u00b0, the sum of these angles equals 180\u00b0 + 90\u00b0=270\u00b0 ; and if the angles are equal, each is 135\u00b0 ; if the planes s, t, meet at 110\u00b0, the sum ofthe two angles equals 180\u00b0 + 110\u00b0=290\u00b0 ; and if one is 130\u00b0, the other will be 160\u00b0. 36. On p. xxvi, the relation between the symbols and the tangents of the inclina tions of planes lying in zones between rectangular axes (which zones can be made to be vertical zones in one position or another of the crystal) is pointed out. The same method holds for ail vertical zones in the tetragonal system, and for those that be come vertical on putting the crystal on its plane i-i ; also for all the zones which are made vertical by placing a monoclinic prism on its face i-i, that is the zone of clino domes, the zone of vertical prisms, and all zones, then vertical, of hemioctahedrons ; also for all the vertical zones of the hexagonal prism, and hence for the zone of rhoni bohedrons of any species, or vertical zones of scalenohedral planes. 37. For the transfer oi hi k of Miller's system into the system of this work, take the reciprocals. Thus if symbol is 212, the reciprocals are \\, 1, \\, the last \\ refer ring to the vertical axis. As the relation of the lateral axes should be in whole numbers, double the whole and it gives 1:2:1; whence the plane is that which would be here designated 1-2. So 1 : 1 : 3 becomes 1 : 1 : -J-, whence the symbo \\ ; or 315 becomes -J, 1, A, or 1, 3, \u00a3 ; whence -|-3 ; and in the orthorhombic system the 3 in i-3 would haye the short mark, or be written j-S ; while 135 would give the symbol f-3. 38. In hexagonal forms the change is less simple, and the method for it is hardly intelligible to one not knowing something of both systems. The axes of Miller, in stead of being those of fig. A, p. xxv, are lines drawn through the centre normal to (that is, at right angles to) the alternate faces of the pyramid ; they are therefore three in number, and the planes are thus referred to axes parallel to the rhombohedral edo-e. The planes in fig. A, according to Naumann's system, are all of one kind in the hexagonal section of the hexagonal system, but of two kinds, R and -R (or 1 and -1) in the rhombohedral section. In Miller's system they are of two hinds in both sec tions, the distinction between the two sections not being entertained. The axes a, b, c, of any plane in the hexagonal system of Naumann, have the fol lowing values in terms of h k I of Miller :*"], [37, "INTRODUCTION. XXIX 1 /8 (1 + 2 cos 7) 1_ 1_ _+_+.V 2(1\u2014 cos 7) b~l\u2014 k c~l\u2014h But in using these equations strict attention must be paid to the signs, as is illus trated in the examples below. The angle 7 is the angle between the axes in Miller's system, which equals the facial angle of the rhomb face at the vertex of the rhombo hedron R. The equations give the true ratios of Naumann's axes ; but these ratios often have to be reduced to whole numbers, or otherwise modified, to obtain precisely the values used in Naumann's symbol. The second member in the equation for a gives the length of the axis ma in any form ; the first member in it is all that is required for the value of m in the symbol, while the second is the value of a. The following are some examples : In f. 564 (p. 672), plane R, which is 100 of Miller, gives, on substituting the values othkl, and working the equations, a : . : c=l : i (infinity) : -1. The parameters osthe plane in Naumann's system for the vertical and three lateral axes are 1 : 1 : 1 : i. The plane i, to the right, is 2TT of Miller ; whence a : b : c=i : i : -3, which, since a and b arc each infinity, is equivalent to i : i : -1. The plane -2, to the right, is 1 1 1 of Miller ; whence a : b : c= 1 : i : i= 2 : 1 : i ; the Nau mann ratio for this plane is 2 : 1 : 1 : i. Plane -J is 332 of Miller ; whence a : . : c=\\ : i : -i=i : -1 : -1. The left upper plane I3 is 201 in Miller; whence a : b : c=l : -1 : -J=3 : -3 : -1, giving the Naumann symbol 3-3, from which comes its equivalent scalenohedral symbol I3. The left upper plane J3 is Miller's 310; whence a : b : c=i : -1 : -J-=f : -3 : -1 ; giving the Naumann symbol f-3, and its equivalent J3. The right upper osthe two adjoining planes, \u00a33 in f. 564, is 301 of Miller; whence a : b : c= i : 1 : \u2014i- This is apparently a different result from the last. But calculating the length of the fourth of Naumann's parameters, it gives _,=\u00bb-*-(?.\u2014 l)=\u00a3-*-(-J\u2014 ])=\u00a3, from which it follows that the parameters of the plane are J : 1 : i : \u2014 i; and on calculating the fourth parameter in the preceding, i would be obtained, proving that both are really the same plane. 5. Nomenclature. 1. The termination ites or itis (the original of ite) was used, according to system, among the Greeks, and from them among the Romans, in tbe names of stones, it being one of the regular Greek suffixes. It was added (as ite in these recent times) to the word signifying a quality, constituent, use, or locality of the stone. Some of the examples are : H\u00e6matites, from the red color of the powder Chloritis, from the green color ; Steatites, from the greasy feel ; Dendritis, from a resemblance to a tree or branch ; Alabastritis, for the stone out of which a vase called an alabastron was made ; Basanite% from the word for touchstone ; Siderites, from the word for iron; Argyritis, from the Greek for silver; Syenitis, from the locality, Syene in Egypt ; Memphitis, for a marble from Memphis in Egypt. 2. The only modern kind of name not in vogue in Pliny's time is that after persons. Werner appears to have been the first to introduce personal names into mineralogy. The earliest example, as far as ascertained, was his naming what von Born had called Green Hica (Mica viridis), Torberite, after its investigator, the chemist Torber Bergmann (more correctly written Torbernite by some mineralogists of last century, as Bergmann wrote his name in Latin, the language of his scientific works, Torbernus Bergmann). The name encountered objections ; and Werner, in view of Bergmann's announcement (after some incorrect trials) that the mineral was a copper ore, substituted in 1789 the name Chalcolite. He, however, immediately afterward (early in 1790) showed that he saw nothing bad in the style of name by designating other new species Prehnite and Witherite, the former after Col. Prehn, the discoverer, and the latter after Dr. Withering, the discoverer and analyst of the species. The same year Estner, a mineralogist of Vienna, issued a pamphlet against the Werner school, with the title \" Freymiithige Gedanken"], [38, "XXX INTRODUCTION. liber Herrn Inspector Werner's Verbesserungen in der Mineralogie,\" etc. (64 pp. 16mo, 1790), in which he makes light of Werner's labors in the science, and under the head of Prehnite ridiculed this method of creating a paternity, and providing the childless with children to hand down their names to posterity (p. 25). Such names were, however, too easily made, too pleasant, as a general thing, to give and receive, and withal too free from real objection, to be thus stopped off, and they have since become numerous, even Vienna contributing her full share toward their multiplication. As a part of the history of mineralogical nomenclature, it may be here added that Werner, when it was proved that his chalcolite was an ore of uranium with but little copper, instead of a true ore of copper, dropped the name entirely, and called the mineral simply Uranglimmer (Uranium mica); and Karsten, in his reply to Abbe Estner (Berlin, 1793, 80 pp. 12mo), makes out of the necessary rejection of chalcolite an argument against chemical names, and in favor of names after persons, as the latter could never turn out erroneous in signification- Werner, in an article written in defence of his introduction of this class of names (Bergm. J., i. 103, 1790), mentions the case of Obsidian (more properly Obsian) as aprecedent from Pliny, Obsian being, as Pliny states, the reported discoverer of the substance in Ethiopia. But this is not strictly an example. For Pliny uses Obsian not as a substantive, but as an adjective ; the mineral was not Obsian, but Obsian glass or Obsian stone; vilrum obsianum, lapis obsianus, and obsiana [vitra], occurring in the course of the paragraph. The addition of the termination ite to Obsian would, according to mineralogical method, make a name equivalent to Pliny's lapis obsianus. Names of persons ending in an (as Octavian, Tertulliau) were common among the Romans ; and this is so far reason for avoiding the termination in names of stones. Some critics question the existence of the reputed Obsius, and reject Pliny's explanation. 3. The ancient origin of this termination ite, its adoption for most of the names in modern mineralogy, its distinctive character and convenient application, make it evidently the true basis for uniformity in the nomenclature of the science. 4. If any other termination in addition is to be used, it should be so only under system ; that is, it should be made characteristic of a particular natural group of species, and be invariably employed for the names in that group ; and its use should not be a matter of choice or fancy with describers of species. As a matter of fact, several other terminations are in use, but wholly without reference to any such system. The most common of them is ine ; but it has not been employed for any particular division of minerals, and it could not now be so restricted ; it belongs by adoption and long usage to chemistry, and should be left to that science. 5. In order then that the acquired uniformity may be attained, changes should be made in existing names, when it can be done without great inconvenience. Names like Quartz, Garnet, Gypsum, Realgar, Orpiment, with the names of the metals and gems, which are part of general literature, must remain unaltered. Mica and Feldspar, equally old with Quartz, have become the names of groups of minerals, and are no longer applied to particular species. Fluor was written fluorite last century by Napione. Blende, although one of the number that might be aUowed to stand among the exceptions, has already given place with some mineralogists to Sphalerite, a name proposed by Haidinger (because blende was applied also to other species) in 1845, and signifying deception, like Blende. Galena was written Galenite by von Kobell some years since. Orthoclase, Loxoclase, Oligoclase might be rightly lengthened to Orthoclasite, etc. But the termination clase (from the Greek for fracture) is peculiar to names of minerals, and the abbreviated form in use may be allowed to stand for species of the Feldspar group. It seems better that it be avoided elsewhere. Many other examples will be found by the reader in the pages of this volume. In the course of the last century, when the science of minerals was taking shape, and progress in chemistry was helping it forward, there was an effort on one side to introduce, under the influence of Linn\u00e6us, the double names of Botany and Zoology ; and on the other, under the influence of Cronstedt and Bergmann, names expressive of chemical composition, as far as it was ascertained ; and the two methods have had their advocates till late in the present century. But"], [39, "INTRODUCTION. XXXI at the same time, the necessity of single names was recognized by most of the early mineralo gists ; and in the spirit of the system which had made its appearanoe among the Greeks and Romans out of the genius of the Greek language, they almost uniformly adopted for the new names the termination ite. Thus we have from Werner the names Torberite, Chalcolite, Graphite, Prehnite, Witherite, Bora cite, Augite, Pistacite, Pinite, Aragonite, Apatite, Leucite, Cyanite (Kyanite) ; and from other sources in the same century, Zeolite, ActinoUte, Tremolite, Coccolite, Arendalite, Baikalite, Melanite, Staurolite, Lepidolite, Cryolite, Chiastolite, Collyrite, Agalmatolite, Sommite, Moroxite, Pharmaco lite, Strontianite, Delphiuite, Titanite, Ceylanite, Gadolinite, Rubellite, Sahlite, Wernerite, Scapo lite, Mellite, etc. The termination ine was also adopted for a few names, as Tourmaline, Olivine, Xlascagnine, Serpentine ; and an in Vesuvian ; but the great bulk of the names were systematically termi nated in ite. With the opening of the present century (in 1801), Haiiy came forward with his great work on Crystallography, and in it he brought out a variety of new names that defy all system, having nothing of the system of the earlier science, and no substitute of his own. Forgetting that the unity of law which he had found in nature should be a feature of scientific language, he gave to his names the followiug terminations : ane, in Cymophane ; ase, in Euclase, Idocrase, Anatase, Dioptase ; aste, in Pleonaste ; age, in Diallage ; ene, in Disthene, Sphene ; gene, in Amphigene ; ide, in Staurotide ; ime, in Analcime ; ole, in Amphibole ; o me, in Aplome, Harmotome ; ose, in Orthose ; ote, in Actinote, Epidote ; yre, in Dipyre ; ype, in Mesotype. And the true mineralogical termination ite he admitted only in the few following : Aximte, Meionite, Pycnite, Stilbite, Grammatite. Haiiy had commanded so great and so general admiration by his brilliant discoveries in crys tallography, and by the benefits which he had thus conferred on mineralogical science, that his names with their innovations were for the most part immediately accepted even beyond the limits of France, although a number of them were substitutes for those of other authors. Some of Werner's names were among the rejected; and a break was thus occasioued between German and French mineralogy, which will not be wholly removed until the rule of priority, properly restricted, shall be allowed to have sway. The substitutes among Haiiy's names in the 1st edition of his Crystallography (1801) are the fol lowing : Amphibole, for Hornblende of last century and earlier. Orthose. for Feldspar. Pyroxene, for Augite of Werner, and Volcanite of Delametherie. [Delametherie was a contem porary of Haiiy at Paris, the author in 1792 of an edition of Mongez's Manuel du Mineralogiste (after Bergmann's Sciagraphia) ; in 1797, of an ambitious speculative work entitled Theorie de la Terre, the first two volumes of which consisted of a Treatise on Mineralogy; in 1811, 1812, of Lemons de Mineralogie, in 2 vols., and for a number of years principal editor of the Journal de Phy sique. He gave offence to Haiiy by some of his early publications. Haiiy's mineral Euclase is described in full by Delametherie iu the Journal de Physique for 1792 (some years in advance of Haiiy's description of it), without crediting the name or anything else to Haiiy; but five years later, in lys Theorie de la Terre, he inserts the species with full credit to Haiiy.] Cymophane, for Chrysoberyl of Werner. Idocrase, for Vesuvian of Werner. Pleonaste, for Ceylanite of Delametherie. Disthene, for Cyanite of Werner. Anatase, for Octahedrite of de Saussure, and Oisanite of Delam.therie. Sphene, for Titanite of Klaproth. Nepheline, for Sommite of Delametherie. Triphane, for Spodumene of d'Andrada. Amphigene, for Leucite of Werner. Actinote, for Actinolite of Kirwan, and Zillerthite of Delametherie. Epidote, for Thallite of Delametherie, Delphinile of de Saussure, and Arendalite of Karsten. Axinite, for Tanolite of Delametherie. - Harmotome, for Andreolite of Delam.therie. Grammatite, for Tremolite of Pini. Staurotide, for Staurolite of Delametherie, and Crenatite of de Saussure. And, later, Paranthine, for Scapolite of d'Andrada, and Rapidolile of Abildgaard. Part of the changes were made with good reason; but others were wholly unnecessary. Haiiy was opposed to names from localities, and hence several of the displacements. He objected also to names based on variable characters, and characters not confined to the species. Moreover, as his pupil, Lucas, observes (in giving reasons for rejecting the name Scapolite and substituting Paranthine), \" le vice du mot lite, qui s'applique a toutes les pierres, ne pouvoient plus convenir a cette substance du moment od elle seroit reconnue pour un espece.\" Haiiy's own names are"], [40, "XXXII INTRODUCTION. remarkable, in general, for their indefiniteness of signification, which makes them etymologically nearly as good for one mineral as another, and very bad for almost none ; as, for example, Dial lage, which is from the Greek for difference; Analcime, from weakness in Greek; Orthose, from straight in Greek ; Epidote, from increase in Greek ; Anatase, from erection in Greek, interpreted by him as equivalent to length; Idocrase, from I see mixture in Greek, etc. His name Pyroxene, which he defines hole ou etranger duns le domaine du feu, is an unfortunate exception, as often remarked, the mineral being the most common and universal constituent of igneous rocks. Beudant succeeded Haiiy, and had the same want of system in his ideas of uomenclature. Find ing occasion to name various mineral species which tdl then liad only chemical names, he adopted Haiiy's method of miscellaneous terminations, but indulged in it with less taste and judgment, and with little knowledge of the rules of etymology. In his work we find the termination ese, in Apherese, Aphanese, Neoctese, Acerdese, Mimetese ; ise, in Leberkise, Sperkise. Harkise (only German words Gallicized) ; Melaconise, Zinconise, Crocoise, Stibiconise, Uraconise ; ose, in Argy rose, Argyrythrose, Psaturose, Aphthalose, Rhodalose, Siderose, Elasmose, Exanthalose, Cyanose, Melinose, Disomose ; ase, in Neoptase, Discrase ; ime, in Tpoleime ; de, hi Exitele ; while names ending in ine are greatly multiplied. In Germany, the tendency has always been to uniformity through the adoption of the termina tion ite. Breithaupt has been somewhat lawless, giving the science his Plinian, Alumian, Sardi nian, Asbolan, ete. ; his Castor and Pollux ; Glaucodot, Homichlin, Orthoclase, Xanthocon, etc. ; still, far the larger part of his numerous names are rightly terminated. Haidinger's many names are always right and good. 6. In forming names from the Greek or Latin the termination ite is added to the genitive form after dropping the vowel or vowels of the last syllable, and any follow ing letters. Thus, uiXccj makes fiiXavos (melanos) in the genitive, and gives the name melanite. The Greek language is the most approved source of names. 7. In compounding Greek words the same elision of the Greek genitive is made for the first word in the compound, provided the second word begins with a vowel ; if not, the letter o is inserted. Thus, from i-Op, genitive tfupoj (puros), and Zpiig (orthos), comes pyrorthite ; and from the same and g-vo.c (xenos) comes pyroxene. 8. The liberty is sometimes taken in the case of long compounds to drop a sylla ble, and when done with judgment it is not objectionable ; thus melaconite has been accepted in place of melanoconite. But magnoferrite (as if from the Latin magnus, great, and ferrum, iron), for a compound of magnesia and iron, or calcimangite for one containing lime and manganese, are bad. 9. In the transfer of Greek words into Latin or English, the x (k) becomes c, and the u (u) becomes y. 10. In the formation osthe names of minerals, the addition osthe termination ite to proper names in modern languages (names of places, persons, etc.), or names of characteristic chemical constituents, is allowable ; but making this or any other sylla ble a suffix to common words in such languages is barbarous. 11. Names made half of Greek and half Latin are objectionable ; but names that are half of Greek or Latin and half of a modern language are intolerable. 12. Law of Priority. The law of priority has the same claim to recognition in mineralogy as in the other natural sciences. Its purpose is primarily to secure the stability, purity, and perfection of science, and not to insure credit to authors. 13. Limitations of the Law of Priority. The following are cases in which a name having priority may properly be set aside : a. When the name is identical with the accepted name of another mineral of earlier date. 6. When it is glaringly false in signification ; as when a red mineral is declared in its name to be black ; e. g., Melanochroite (p. 630) ; or when a honey-yellow mine ral is made to be ashen ; e. g., Melinophane (p. 263). c. When it is put forth without a description. d. When published with a description so incorrect that a recognition of the mine ral by means of it is impossible ; and in consequence, and because also of the rarity of specimens, the same species is described under another name without the"], [41, "INTRODUCTION. XXXIII describer's knowledge of the mineral bearing the former name. When, on the con trary, a badly described but well-known old mineral is redescribed correctly, there is no propriety in the new describer changing the old name. According to this canon it might seem right that the name Emerylite should have been substi tuted for Margarite (p. 506). Yet margarite, though incorrectly described, was a species well known in cabinets, and Dr. Smith manifested his appreciation of the true interests of science \u2014 the end of all canons \u2014 in adopting the old name so soon as he had ascertained by further research the identity of his species with margarite. e. When the name is based on an uncharacteristic variety of the species. Thus Sagenite was properly set aside for Rutile (p. 159). /. When the name is based upon a variety so important that the variety is best left to retain its original name ; particularly where this and other varieties of the species, introduced originally as separate species, are afterwards shown by investiga tion to belong to a common species. Thus, the earlier name Augite is properly retained as the name of a variety, and Haiiy's later name Pyroxene accepted for the group, as explained on p. 214. g. When a name becomes the designation of a group of species : as Mica, Chlorite. h. When the name is badly formed, or the parts are badly put together : as when the terminal . of a Greek word is retained in the derivative ; e. g., aphanese from ccpavijs ; Melaconise from the Greek for black and xrivi; ; Rhodalose from the Greek for rose-colored and aXo<- (halos), the genitive of oX;, salt. The last word is bad not only in termination but in wanting an h before the a, and strictly an o after the d. Also Siderose (spathic iron), Argyrose (silver glance), Chalcosine (copper glance), from, respectively, criO-ipoj, ap/upos, yuXv.fa. The ancient Greeks showed us how the derivatives from these words should termiuate by writing them Sideritis, Argy ritis, Chalcitis. Ignorance or carelessness should no. be allowed to give perpetuity to its blunders under any law of priority. i. When a name is intolerable for the reasons mentioned in \u00a7\u00a7 10, 11, as Harkise, from the German Haarkies (hair pyrites) ; Kupaphrite, from the German Kupfer schaum ; Bleinierite, from the German Blei-Niere. j. Wben a name has been lost sight of and has found no one to assert its claim for a period of more than fifty years ; especially if the later name adopted for the species has become intimately incorporated with the structure of the science, or with the nomenclature of rocks. Thus, although Thallite and Delphinite ante date Epidote, it is not for the good of science that Epidote should be thrown aside. But where a name has not this importance, and is unexceptionable, the law of priority may be allowed to have its course. The right to recognition, under this canon, where the names are those of the original describer of the species, is strong. But with regard to names introduced for well-known old species to replace earlier chemical or provincial names, the claim is feebler ; and if the names are not strictly according to rule, or are unsatisfactory in mode of publication, they maybe more freely modified, abbreviated if desirable, or rejected altogether. \u2022 Prof. Chapman's \" Practical Mineralogy,\" pub lished in England in 1843, affords examples of the latter kind, and has occasioned some embar rassment. The work was by an author at that time unknown in the science (the preface says, an engineer, and \" a very young man \") ; it was small, of limited circulation, and practical in its object, and therefore one in which new names for old species would not naturally be looked for. In 1845, Haidinger, then already a veteran in the science, the author of severcl works on mineralogy, and of numerous researches in its various departments, issued his \"Handbueli,\" in which also a number of old species were provided with miueralogical names. Through Chapman's publication, Haidiuger's Breithauptite is anticipated two years by Chapman's Hartmar.nite ; his Freieslebenite, by the latter's Donacargyrite ; his Chromite, by the latter's Chromoferrite ; his Cuprile,by Ruberiie; and so on. Chapman's names have ever since remained unknown or forgotten; while flaidinger's have had general acceptance among the mineralogists of Europe, and are now the current names. It has seemed that, after so long a period of oblivion, it would be doing i o good to science to dis- c"], [42, "XXXIV INTRODUCTION. place the latter, and a useless endeavor to attempt it. The later English Mineralogies of Nicoll (1849), Brooke & Miller (1852), and Greg & Lettsom (1S58), contain none of Chapman's names. k. Where the adopted system of nomenclature in the science is not conformed to. In accordance with this last principle, the author, believing that the system demands that the names of species should have as far as possible, as above explained, the common termination ite, has changed, accordingly, a number of the names in the course of this volume. 14. It has appeared desirable that the names of rocks should have some difference of form from those of minerals. To secure this end, the author has written the final syllable ite of such names with a y ; thus Diorite, Eurite, Tonalite, etc., are written Dioryte, Euryte, Tonalyte. The y is already in the name Trachyte. The author has allowed Granite and Syenite to remain as they are ordinarily written, since they are familiar names in common as well as in scientific literature.

The following catalogue contains the titles of the works which are referred to in the following pages, with their abbreviated titles. As the value of these references, and of the various historical conclusions deduced, depends on their having been derived from the original publications themselves, the abbreviated titles of the Jour nals and other works which the author has had by him for consultation are put in black letter ; while the rest, that is of those he has not seen, are in small capitals. Some titles also are added of works consulted, but not referred to. Many other titles might have been inserted, a considerable number from the author's library ; but they would swell the list without increasing much its value. The abbreviations of the more important words in the abbreviated titles, and of the names of the States in the United States (some of which are in the titles and others in the observations on minerals), are as follows : Abbreviated words. \u2014 Am., American ; Can., Canada ; .

Periodicals not issued by Scientific Societies ; 2. Publications of Scientific Societies ; 3. Independent works or publications. In giving abbreviations osthe publications of Societies, the name of the place where the Society is established is in all cases stated, and, for the sake of uniformity, it is made the last word in the abbreviated title, a method which it were well if always followed. For the prominent journals, and the serials of some societies, the time of publication of the successive volumes, or of the volumes of every successive five years, is stated.* * A very useful table, giving the date of publication of each volume of the journals here referred. ;to, might easily be constructed from the facts stated.

Annotated Index to the Useful Metals and Metallic Ores. GOLD. \u2014 Native Gold (1).* Distinguished from all minerals it resembles by its flattening under a hammer; its cutting Uke lead, although considerably harder; its resisting the action of nitric acid, hot or cold ; its high specific gravity. Gold also occurs in Gold Amalgam (11), Sylvanite (98), Nagyagite (99), Pelzile (58A), and Cala verite (Supplement). Also sometimes in traces in Pyrite, Galenite, Chalcopyrite, Native TeUurium. PLATINUM.\u2014 IRIDIUM.\u2014 PALLADIUM.\u2014 Kative Platinum (3), the source of the platinum of commerce, is distinguished by the same tests as gold; and it is mainly on account of its mal leability that it occurs in flattened grains or scales. Platiniridium (4) is another ore somewhat harder. Iridosmine (7) resembles platinum ; but it scratches glass, and gives the reaction of osmium, besides being rather brittle. Native Palladium (5). SILVER. \u2014 The important Silver minerals are : Native Silver (2), sectile and malleable like gold, the only one that has a white color; Argentite or Sulphuret of Silver (40), blackish lead-gray, cutting (unlike the foUowing) nearly like pure lead, cubic in crystalUzation ; Pyrargyrite and Proustite or Ruby Silver ore (117, 118), ruby red to black, always giving a bright red powder; Freieslebenite or Gray Silver ore (114), steel-gray, rather brittle, and powder steel-gray ; Stephanite or Brittle or Black SUver ore (130), iron-black, and giviug an iron-black powder; Cerargyrite or Horn Silver (140), resembling a dark-colored gray or greenish wax, and cutting like wax; Embo lite or Chloro-bromid of Silver (141), like the last, but more greenish. These ores yield silver easily, when heated on charcoal. Besides these, Tetrahedrite or Gray Copper (125) is often a valuable silver ore ; Galenite (44). which, although seldom yielding over seventy-five ounces to the ton, affords a considerable part of the sflver of commerce. For other rarer sUver minerals, see 35, 36, 41, 42, 58-60, 62, 63, 98, 99, 108, 111, 115, 116, 120, 131, 133, 142, 143. COPPER. \u2014 The more valuable species are: Native Copper (12); Chalcopyrite or Copper pyrites (78), of a brass-yellow color, scratched easily with the point of a knife-blade, and giving a greenish black powder; Barnhardtite (79) and Cubanite (77), which are simUar to the last, but paler; Bornite or Purple Copper (49), pale yeUowish, with a slight coppery tinge, but tarnishing exter nally to purple, blue, and reddish tints, easily scratched with a knife-blade, and powder grayish ; Chalcocite or Vitreous Copper (61), of a dark lead-gruy color, and powder simUar, resembUng some silver ores, but yielding copper and not sdver when heated on charcoal ; Tetrahedrite or Gray Copper (12.5), of a somewhat paler steel-gray color and powder; Red Copper (172) ; Black Copper (178) ; Malachite or Green Carbonate of Copper (751), of a bright green color, sometimes earthy in the fracture and sometimes silky; Azurite or Blue Malachite (752), of a rich deep blue color, either earthy or vitreous iu lustre. -All the above are acted on by nitric acid, and the solution deposits a red coating of copper on a strip of polished iron ; Chrysocolla (346), a silicate of copper, resem bling the Green Carbonate, but paler green, and usually having a close texture (never fibrous), a smoother surface and somewhat waxy lustre, although occurring usually as an incrustation- Atacamite or Chlorid of Copper (153), of deeper green than Malachite; Sulphate of Copper (669). For rarer minerals containing copper, see 37, 38, 39, 42, 43, 46, 50, 51, 62, 80, 82, 100-103, 110, 119, 1-21, 124, 126, 154 (sulphids, arsenids, etc.); 218, 345 (silicates); 533-536, 538-548, 567J 583, 615, 622, 623, 636, 639, 644, 66.5, 670, 700, 705, 706, 708 (phosphates, arsenates, sulphates); 750, 755 (carbonates). QUICKSILVER. \u2014 The only valuable ore is Cinnabar (64) of a bright red to brownish-black color, with a red powder, and affording quicksUver when heated in an open tube. There are also Native Quicksilver (8) ; Amalgam (9) ; Selenid (65); Chlorid and Iodid (136, 144). Tetrahedrite (125) sometimes contains this metal. LEAD. \u2014 Galenite (44) is the only abundant lead ore ; it is a lead-gray, brittle ore, yielding lead when heated with charcoal. The carbonate (cerussite, 729), phosphate (pyromorphite, 493) arse nate (mimetite, 494), and sulphate (anglesite. 633), are rarely worked as ores. For other lead minerals, see 41, 45, 46, 47, 99, 105-107, 111-114, 119, 122-124, 126, 128, 129 (sulphids, antimo nids, etc.); 145, 150-152 (ohlorids) ; 177, 197 (oxyds); 502, 539 (arsenates); 605 (antimonate) 556 (phosphate); 616 I tungstate) ; 617 (molybdate); 619-621, 623 (vanadates) ; 635, 636 638 641, 700 (sulphates); 642-645 (chromates); 712 (selenate); 715, 733 (carbonates). * The numbers refer to the number of the species."], [55, "xlvii INTRODUCTION. ZINC. \u2014 The most important ores are: 1, Smithsonite or Carbonate of Zinc (123), and 2, Cala mine or Silicate of Zinc (361) ; they are alike in a white, grayish-white, or greenish-white color, commonly a slight waxy lustre and smooth look (often stalactitic or mammillary), yet sometimes earthy ; and a hardness such that the surface is scratched with a knife-blade with some little difficulty. They differ iu their action with muriatic acid ; when the surface is drusy, the silicate shows projections of minute rectangular prisms. Zincite or Red Zinc Ore (176) is also important ; it is bright red and very distinctly foliated. Blende or Sulphid of Zinc (56) is a common ore, hav ing a yellow to black color and resinous lustre, and distinctly cleavable ; the black varieties are sometimes a little metallic in lustre, but the powder is nearly or quite white. For other Zinc minerals, see 185, 188 (oxyds); 70 (sulphid); 57 (oxysulphid) ; 238, 241, 266, 270 (sUicate); 634, 666 (sulphate) ; 500 (phosphate) ; 530, 537 (arsenate) ; 749, 750 (carbonate). ' COBALT, NICKEL.\u2014 The ores of cobalt : Smaltite (83) and Cobaltite (85), both of nearly a tin white color, with the powder grayish-black, color sometimes verging slightly to gray. The Black Oxyd of Cobalt (218), a kind of bog ore and very impure, is sometimes sufficiently abundant to be valuable. The useful ores of nickel are Chloanlhite or the niccoliferous smaltite (83), Gersdorffite or Nickel Glance (86), Niccolile or Copper Nickel (71), distinguished by apale copper-red color, and Niccoliferous Pyrrhotite (68), from which the larger portion of the nickel of commerce is extracted. For other ores of Cobalt, see 53, 81, 82, 84, 95, 97 (sulphids and arsenids) ; 618 (molybdate); 667 (sulphate); 526, 529, 530 (arsenate); 748 (carbonate); of Nickel, 54, 66 (sulphid); 74, 87, 88 (arsenical or antimonial); 416 (siUcate) ; 66S (sulphate); 527, 529, 530 (arsenate) ; 747 (carbo nate). MANGANESE. \u2014 Common, as Pyrolusite (199) and Psilomelane (217), both black or grayish black ores, and having little lustre, and a blackish streak or powder, in which last particular they are distinct from the iron ore caUed Limonite, with which they are often associated, and also from Hematite or Specular Iron. Wad (218) is an earthy bog manganese, sometimes abundant and valuable. Manganite (205) is abundant in certain mines, but is of little value in the arts, because of its containing so little oxygen (one-third less than Pyrolusite), to which fact Beudant alludes in his name for tbe species, Acerdese; it differs from pyrolusite in its reddish-brown powder. For other manganese ores, see 52, 76 (sulphid); 73(arsenid); 195, 196 (oxyds) ; 241, 262, 263 269, 491 (silicates); 498, 499, 531 (phosphates); 532 (arsenate); 663, 679, 680 (sulphates); 717, 721, 722, 725 (carbonates). CHROMIUM. \u2014 Chromic Iron (189), a grayish-black, Uttle lustrous ore, occurring mostly iu Ser pentine, is the source of chrome in the arts. For different chromates, see p. 614. IRON. \u2014 The important iron ores are: Hematite or Specular Iron (the _f\u00abni_ or bloodstone of Theophrastus) (180), characterized by its blood-red powder, aud occurring either earthy and red, or metallic and dark steel-gray; in the latter condition very hard, a knife-point makiuguoimpres sion ; Magnetite or magnetic iron ore (18c), as hard as the preceding, but having a black powder, and being attractablo-b-y a magnet ; Franklinite, an allied species, containing zinc and manganese (188); Limonite, called also brown hematito (206), a softer hydrous ore, affording a brownish yeUow powder, earthy or semi-metaUic in appearance, and often in mammillary or stalactitic forms ; nearly related to limonite are gothite (204), turgite (202), and limnite (213) ; Siderite or Spathic Iron (721), a sparry ore, of grayish, grayish-brown, and brown colors, very distinctly clea vable, turning brown to black on exposure. The common clayey iron ores are impure ores, either of Spathic Iron, Limonite, or Hematite ; when the last they are red ; when brown, reddish-brown, or yellowish-brown to black, they may be cither of the two former. One of the most common iron minerals is Pyrite or sulphid of iron (75), a pale yellow, brass-like ore, hard enough to strike fire with steel, and thus unlike any copper ore, and all similar ores of other metals. It is fre quently mined and utilized for the sulphur it contains. Marcasite (90) is similar, but is prismatic and often crested in its forms. Pyrrhotite or Magnetic Pyrites (68) is less hard and paler, or more grayish in color. Leucopyrite and Mispickel (91, 93, 94) are white, metaUic, arsenical ores, some what resembling ores of cobalt. Menaccanite or Titanic Iron (181 ) resembles specular iron closely, but has not a red powder; it is abundant in some regions. For other iron minerals, see 260, 284,334, 369, 435, 436. 467, 469 (silicates); 473-475 (columbates, tautalates); 498, 499, 524, 525, 553,557,558, 560, 567-570, 576 (phosphates, arsenates); 605 (borate); 610 (tungstate); 646, 662, 664, 665, 672, 675, 682-687, 692. 696 (sulphates); 717,719,720 (carbonates); 758 (oxalate). TIN.\u2014 The only valuable ore is the Oxyd of Tin or Cassiterite (192), a very hard and heavy mineral of a dark brown to black color, sometimes gray or grayish-brown, without any metaUic appearance ; the crystals usuaUy have a very briUiant lustre. Tin also occurs as a sulphid (80), and is sparingly found in ores of tantalum and some other mineral species."], [56, "xlviii INTRODUCTION. TITANIUM.\u2014 The only ore os this metal of any value is Rutile (193). ARSENIC\u2014 Native Arsenic (17) is one source of arsenic, but it is too rare to be of much avail; also Orpiment (27), a sulphur-yeUow, foliaceous, and somewhat pearly mineral, and Realgar (26), bright red and vitreous. Arsenic is mostly derived for the arts from the arsenical ores of irou, cobalt, and nickel. ANTIMONY.\u2014 Stibnite or Gray Antimony (29) is the source of the antimony of commerce. It is a lead-<*ray ore, usually fibrous or in prismatic crystals, and distinguished from a similar ore of manganese by its perfect diagonal cleavage and its easy fusibiUty. Native antimony (18), senar montite (220), valentinite (221), are sometimes found in sufficient abundance to be mined. Anti mony occurs also in numerous ores of lead, silver, and nickel ; also as oxysulphid (226). BISMUTH.\u2014 Native Bismuth (20), the source osthe metal in the arts, is whitish, with a faint reddish tinge, has a perfect cleavage, and is very fusible. For other bismuth ores, see 30-33, 36, 102, 103, 121, 123, 124 (sulphids, teUurids); 222, 223 (oxyds); 336-338 (sUicates); 753 (car bonate). 8. Abbreviations.

These two series are parallel in their subdivisions, so that tha arrangement is a natural one, whether read across, or up and down, the page. The first group of each contains elements whose compounds have an odd number of atoms of the negative elemeDt, as 1, 3, 5, or the perissads (p. xviii); the other two of each, an even number, as 2, 4, 6, or the artiads. (1). To the Gold group of elements belong also hydrogen, potassium, sodium, lithium, rubidium, c\u00e6sium, thallium; the atomic ratio for the oxyds is 1 : 1, and the general formula osthe sameRO, or R20, in the new system of chemistry. To the Arsenic group belong the elements phosphorus, nitrogen, columbium, tantalum, and proba bly boron. In all but boron, there are oxyds containing 3 and 5 atoms of oxygen ; in boron, 3, but not 5. (2). To the Iron group of elements belong calcium, magnesium, aluminum, beryllium, copper, cobalt, nickel, zinc, chromium (in part), manganese (in part), lead (in part), eta Among the oxyds, the atomic ratio 2 : 2 occurs in the ordinary protoxyds, having the formula RO, as ordinarily writ ten (and so written in this work), but RO, in the new style of chemistry. The ratio 4 : 6 is repre sented in the sesquioxyds, R203 (R20s in the new system). To the Sulphur group of elements belong also selenium, vanadium, and probably molybdenum, i_ which the more prominent acid has the atomic ratio 2 : 6. Here also may be included that stat es the metal chromium which exists in chromic acid (CrOs, or erG3), that of manganese in mau ganic acid, and that of molybdenum in molybdic acid. (3). To the Tin group belong also titanium, zirconium, thorium. The prominent oxyd has tlif atomic ratio 2 : 4 (RO2, or in the new system RO';). This group may contain also that state ol lead which exists in the oxyd PbO* (or PbO ) : and the same also of manganese existing in MnO* of platinum and palladium iu the deutoxyd state.* * The three states of a basic metal, corresponding to the protoxyd, sesquioxyd and deutoxyo of the same (iu which 1 part of metal balances, in its affinity, 1, _i anci 2 parts of oxygen) may b"], [59, "3 GOLD, The Carbon-Silicon Group contains Carbon and Silicon. They are related to one another in the atomic ratio of their prominent acids (SiO2, CO2), but they are very widely unlike in many respects, and very strikingly so in the mineral compounds of the two acids.* Series III. \u2014 Besides the above two series of elements, there is a third, consisting of the emi nently negative elements (for the most part exclusively negative). The three groups of this Series III. are : (1). Chlorine, Bromine, Iomne. (2). Fluorine. (3). Oxygen. The first of these groups (like the same in Series I. and II.) includes elements of the odd divi sion ; the third of the even ; while fluorine is of either. 1. GOLD. Sol. Alchem. Gediegen Gold Germ.

This relation is apparent in the crystaliographic and chemical characters of the corresponding oxyds. See further on this subject a paper by the author in Am. Jour. Sci., II. xliv., 1867, and Introd., p. xv. * In strict system, the Silicates should come in classification next before the Carbonates, instead of where they are placed in this work. But as there are no analogies between the species of these two groups, the separation is without serious objection."], [60, "4 NATIVE ELEMENTS. of 1 : 1 corresponds to 36 p. c. of silver (anal. 3, 4, 26, 27, 45) ; lj : 1, to 26 p. c.

The word in Greek means also amber; and its use for this alloy probably arose from the pale yellow color it has as compared with gold. An argentiferous gold from the Ophir Mine, Nevada, pale yellowish in color, gave Breithaupt (B. H. Ztg., xxv. 169) G.=13'25, 13-68.

The average proportion of gold in the native gold of California, as derived from assays of seve ral hundred millions of dollars worth, is 880 thousandths ; while the range is mostly between 810 and 890 (Prof. J. C. Booth, of U. S. Mint, in a letter to the author, of May, 1861). The range in the metal of Australia is mostly between 900 and 960, with an average of 925. The gold of the Chaudiere, Canada, contains usually 1 0 to 1 5 p. c. of silver ; while that of Nova Scotia is very nearly pure. The Chilian gold afforded Domeyko 84 to 96 per cent, of gold and 15 to 3 per cent, of silver (Ann. d. Mines IT. vi.). Porpezite afforded Berzelius (Jahresb. 1835) Gold 85*98, palladium 9*85, silver 4*11. A mass of eleclrum, weighing 25 lbs., from Vorospatak, consisting of large crystals (J- \\ in.), con tained 25 p. c. of silver (Dingi. Polyt. J., clxvi. 396).

Observations. \u2014 Native gold is found, when in situ, with comparatively small exceptions, in the quartz veins that intersect metamorphic rocks, and to some extent in the wall rock of these veins. The metamorphic rocks thus intersected are mostly chloritic, talcose, and argillaceous schist of dull green, dark gray, and other colors; also, much less commonly, mica and hornblendic schist, gneiss, diorite, porphyry; and still more rarely, granite. A laminated quartzite, called itaeolumite, is common in many gold regions, as those of Brazil and North Carolina, and some times specular schists, or slaty rocks containing much foliated specular iron (hematite), or magne tite in grains. The gold occurs in the quartz in strings, scales, plates, and in masses which are sometimes an agglomeration of crystals ; and the scales are often invisible to the naked eye, massive quartz that apparently contains no gold frequently yielding a considerable percentage to the assayer. It is always very irregularly distributed, and never in continuous pure bands of metal, hke many metallic ores. It occurs both disseminated through the mass of the quartz, aud in its cavities. The larger masses and the finer crystallizations are mainly in the latter ; and Prof. Wurtz has suggested that these have been formed by a slow aggregation and crystallization carried on through the solvent power, as regards gold, of persulphate of iron \u2014 this salt of iron being derived from the decomposition of the pyrite present in the quartz veins. The associated minerals are : pyrite, which far exceeds in quantity all others, and is generally auriferous ; next, chalcopyrite, galena, blende, mispickel, each frequently auriferous ; often tetrady mite and other tellurium ores, native bismuth, stibnite, magnetite, hematite ; sometimes barytes, apatite, fluor, siderite, chrysocolla. The quartz at the surface, or in the upper part of a vein, is usually cellular and rusted from the more or less complete disappearance of the pyrite and other sulphids by decomposition ; but below, it is commonly solid. The enclosiug schists are sometimes soft and easily removed in mining. In other cases, they are excessively tough, and the quartz, being a brittle mineral, yields the most easily to the drill. The gold of the world has been mostly gathered, not directly from the quartz veins, but from the gravel or sands of rivers or vaUeys in auriferous regions, or the slopes of mountains or hills, whose rocks contain in some part, and generally not far distant, auriferous veins; and such mines are often called alluvial washings; in California placer-diggings. PUny speaks osthe ''bring ing of rivers from the mountains, in many instances for a hundred miles, for the purpose of washing the debris,\" and this method of hydraulic mining is now carried on in California on a stupendous scale. (See Silliman, in Am. J. Sci., II. xl. 10.) The auriferous gravel and earth have been derived from the disintegration or wearing down of auriferous rocks. The aurifer ous gravel beds in California are of vast extent; those of the Tuba, an affluent of Feather River, varying from 8uto 250 feet in depth, and averaging probably 120 feet. Most of the gold of the Urals, Brazil, AustraUa, aud aU other gold regions, has come from such aUuvial washings. The aUuvial gold is usuaUy in flattened scales of different degrees of fineness, the size depend ing partly on the original condition in the quartz veins, and partly on the distance to which it has been transported. Transportation by running water is an assorting process ; the coarser particles or largest pieces requiring rapid currents to transport them, and dropping first, and the finer being carried far away \u2014 sometimes scores of mdes. A cavity in the rocky slopes or bot tom of a vaUey, or a place where the waters may have eddied, generaUy proves in such a region to be a pocket full of gold. In the auriferous sands, crystals of zircon are very common ; also garnet and kyanite in grains; often also monazite, diamonds, topaz, corundum, iridosmine, platinum. The zircons are sometimes mistaken for diamonds. Gold is widely distributed over the globe, and occurs in rocks of various ages, from the Azoic to the Cretaceous or Tertiary. The schists that contain the auriferous veins were once sediment ary beds of clay, sand, or mud, derived from the wear of preexisting rocks. Through some pro cess, in which heat was concerned, the latter were metamorphosed into the hard crystaUine schists, and at the same time upturned and broken, and often opened between the layers: and then, aU the fissures (cutting across the layers) and the openings (made between the layers, and therefore conforming with the lamination) became filled with the quartz veins containing gold. The quartz was brought into the intersecting fissures, and the interlaminated open spaces, from the rocks either side by means of the permeating heated waters (such heated waters, at a temper ature much above that of boiling water, having great decomposing and solvent power and car rying into cavities whatever they can gather up from the rocks). Thus, the gold of the veins was derived from the rocks adjoining the openings, either directly adjoining, or above, or below it ; and it must therefore have been widely distributed through these rocks before they were crystal lized and the veins were made, although in so infinitesimal a quantity in a cubic foot, that the beds, without the metamorphism and the vein-making, would have been worthless mining ground. As schists with auriferous quartz veins were made in Azoic time, so were they also in Paleo zoic, especiaUy at the great mountain-making epoch which closed the Paleozoic era; also later in"], [63, "7 GOLD. the Jurassic period, as in the Sierra Nevada ; and stiU later in the Cretaceous and Tertiary peri ods, as in the Coast Mountains of California. But whatever the age of the schists and veins, the original source of all the Paleozoic aud later gold deposits must be the azoic or original rocks of the globe, as they are the great source of the material shales and sandstones of aU subsequent ages, excepting such as may have been derived from aqueous solution or chemical deposition. Auriferous quartz veins aro in no case igneous veins \u2014 that is, veins filled by injection of melted matter from below. Gold exists more or less abundantly over aU the continents in most of the regions of crystalUne rocks-, especially those of the semi-crystalline schists; and also in some osthe large islands of the world where such rocks exist. In Europe, it is most abundant in Hungary at Konigsberg, Schemnitz, and Felsobanya, and in Transylvania at Kapnik, Vorospatak, and Offenbanya ; it occurs also in the sands of the Rhine, the Reuss, the Aar, the Rhone, and the Danube; ou the southern slope of the Pennine Alps from the Simplon and Monte Rosa to the vaUey of Aosta ; in Piedmont; in Spain, formerly worked in Asturias; in many of the streams of Cornwall; near DolgeUy and other parts of North Wales ; in Scotland, in considerable amount, near Leadhills, aud in Glen Coich and other parts of Perthshire; in the county of Wicklow, Ireland; in Sweden, at Edelfors. At the Transylvania mines of Vorospatak, where one piece of 22 ozs. was found, the gold is obtained by mining, and the mines have been worked since the time of the Romans. The Rhine has been most productive between Basle and Manheim ; the sands, where richest, contain only about 56 parts of gold in a hundred millions ; yet sands containing less than half this proportion are worked. The whole amount of gold in the auriferous sands of the Rhine has been estimated at \u00a730,000,000; but it is mostly covered by soil under cultivation. In Asia, gold occurs along the eastern flanks of the Urals for 500 miles, and is especially abun dant at the Beresov mines near Katharinenburg (lat. 56\u00b0 40' N.); also obtained at Petropavlov ski (60\u00b0 N.) ; Nischne Tagilsk (59\u00b0 N.) ; Miask, near Slatoust and Mt. Hmen (55\u00b0 N., where the largest Russian nugget was found), etc. Katharinenburg is the capital of the mining district. The Urals were within the territory of the ancient Scythians ; and the vessels of gold reputed, according to Herodotus, to have fallen from the skies, were probably made from Uralian nuggets. But the mines were not opened until 1819; soon after this they became the most productive in the world, and remained so untU the discoveries in California. They are principally aUuvial washings, and these washings seldom yield less than 65 grains of gold for 4,000 lbs. of sod, and rarely more than 1 20 grains. At Beresov, there are workings in the parent rock. Siberian mines less extensive occur in the lesser Altai, in the Kolyvau mining region (about 1,500 miles cast of Katharinenburg, near long. 100\u00b0 E., between the Obi and Irtisch, and 1,500 miles west of the other great Siberian mining region, that of Nertschinsk, which is between 135\u00b0 and 140\u00b0 E., east of L. Baikal); among the localities are Schlangenberg and Siranovski, noted for affording the electrum (anal. 26, 27). Asiatic mines occur also in the Cailas Mountains, in Little Thibet, Cey lon, and Malacca, China, Corea, Japan, Formosa, Sumatra, Java, Borneo, the PhUippines, and other East India Islands. In Africa, gold occurs at Kordofan, between Darfour and Abyssinia ; also, south of the Sahara in Western Africa, from the Senegal to Cape Palmas ; in the interior, on the Somat, a day's jour ney fromCassen; along the coast opposite Madagascar, between 22\u00b0 and 35\u00b0 S., supposed by some to have been the Ophir of the time of Solomon. In South America, gold is found in Brazil (where formerly the larger part of the annual pro duce of the world was obtained) along the chain of mountains lying nearly parallel with the coast, especially near Vdla Rica, and iu the province of Minas Geraes ; in New Grenada, at Antioquia, Choco, and Giron ; Chdi ; in Bolivia, especially in the valley of the Rio de Tipuani, east of Sorata ; sparingly in Peru. Also in Central America, in Honduras, San Salvador, Guatemala, Costa Rica, and near Panama ; most abundant in Honduras, especially along the rivers Guyape and Jalan, in Olancho, whde found also in tho department of Yoro, and in Southern Honduras. In North America, there are numberless mines along the mountains of Western America, and others along the eastern range of the Appalachians from Alabama and Georgia to Labrador, be sides some indications of gold in portions of the intermediate Azoic region about Lake Superior. They occur at many points along the higher regions of the Rocky Mountains, in Mexico, in New Mexico, near Santa Fe. Cerillos, Avo, etc. ; in Arizona, in the San Francisco, Wauba, Yuma, and other districts ; in Colorado, abundant, but the gold largely in auriferous pyrites ; in Utah and Idaho. Also along ranges between the summit and the Sierra Nevada, in the Humboldt region and elsewhere. Also in the Sierra Nevada, mostly on its western slope (the mines of the eastern being principally silver mines). The auriferous belt may be said to begiu iu the Californian penin sula. Near the Tejon pass it enters Cahfornia, and beyond for 180 miles it is sparingly aurifer ous, the slate rocks being of smaU breadth; but beyond this, northward, the slates increase in extent, and the mines in number and productiveness, and they continue thus for 200 miles or more. Gold occurs also in the Coast ranges in many localities, but mostly in too smaU quantities"], [64, "8 DESCRIPTIVE M-NEKALOGY. to be profitably worked. The regions to the north in Oregon and Washington Territory, and the British Possessions farther north, are at many points auriferous, and productively so, though to a less extent than California. The mines of California were first made known in 1849. They were for some years solely alluvial washings, but since 1852 quartz mining has been on the increase. The quartz veins are often of great size. Some in the \" Mariposa estate \" average 1 2 feet, and in places expand to 40 feet in breadth. North of Mariposa county, the auriferous gravel, which has everywhere been a principal source of the gold thus far obtained, is very extensive. The thick deposits, often semi indurated, are now washed down by vast streams of water thrown by the pressure of a column of water of 150 feet, that do the work of running off the earth and gravel, aud gathering the gold in an incredibly short time. Much of the auriferous gravel formation is under a covering of vol canic rock, either tufa or lavas, which has to be underworked, in one way or another, to get out the gold, making what is called table-mountain mining ; the flat tops of hard volcanic material giving a table-like look to the heights. (See J. D. Whitney's Geol. California ; review of same in Am. J. Sci., II. xii. 231, 351, and B. SiUiman, ib., xl. 1.) In eastern North America, the mines of the Southern United States produced before the Cali fornia discoveries about a mUlion of dollars a year. They are mostly confined to the States of Virginia, North and South Carolina, and Georgia, or along a Une from the Rappahannock to the Coosa in Alabama'. But the region may be said to extend north to Canada ; for gold has been found at Albion and Madrid in Maine ; Canaan and Lisbon, N. H. ; Bridgewater, Vermont ; Ded ham, Mass. Traces occur also in Franconia township, Montgomery Co., Pennsylvania. In Vir ginia, the principal deposits are in Spotsylvania county, on the Rappahannock, at the United States mines, and at other places to the southwest ; in Stafford county, at the Rappahannock gold mines, ten mUes from Falmouth, in the Culpepper county, at Culpepper mines, on Rapidan river ; in Orange county, at the Orange Grove gold mine, and at the Greenwood gold mines ; in Goochland county, at Moss and Busby's mines; in Louisa county, at Walton's gold mine; in Buckingham county, at Eldridge's mine. In North Carolina, the gold region is mostly confined to the counties of Montgomery, Cabarrus, Mecklenburg, and Lincoln. The mines of Mecklenburg are principaUy vein deposits ; those of Burke, Lincoln, McDowell, and Rutherford, are mostly in aUuvial soil; the Davidson county silver mine has afforded gold. In Georgia, the Shelton gold mines in Habersham county have long been famous ; and many other places have been opened in Rabun aud HaU counties, Bumpkin county, at Dahlonega, etc. ; and the Cherokee country. In South Carolina, the principal gold regions are the Fairforest in Union district, and the Lynch's creek and Catawba regions, chiefly in Lancaster and Chesterfield districts; also in Pickens county, adjoining Georgia. There is gold also in eastern Tennessee. Iu Canada, gold occurs to the south of the St. Lawrence, in the soil on the Chaudiere (where first found in 1835), and over a considerable region beyond, having been derived probably from the crystaUine schists of the Notre Dame range (T. S. Hunt), which is properly a continuation of the mountains of New England and the Appalachians to the southwest. In Nova Scotia, mines are worked near Halifax and elsewhere. In Australia, which is fully equal to California in productiveness, and much superior in the purity of the metal, the principal gold mines occur along the streams in the mountains of N. S. Wales (S. E. Austraha), and along the continuation of the same range in Victoria (S. Australia). It was discovered in N. S. Wales, near Bathurst, in the spring of 1851 ; and in August osthe same year, the far richer deposits of Victoria became known. Some gold has also been obtained in Queensland, N. Australia, in the vicinity of Moreton bay. Prof. Booth states (iu a letter to the author) that one lot of Australian gold worth about $4,000, submitted to him in 1853, consist ed of grains from the size of a very large pea to small sand, all of which were more or less per fect dodecahedrons. Gold also occurs in Tasmania (Van Diemen's Land). In New Zealand, it has been found at Coromandel harbor, near Auckland, on the Northern island, and on the Middle island near Cook's Straits. Found also in New Caledonia. Masses of gold of considerable size have been found in North Carolina. The largest was dis covered in Cabarrus Co. ; it weighed twenty-eight pounds avoirdupois (\" steel-yard weight,\" equals 37 lbs. troy), and was 8 or 9 inches long by 4 or 5 broad, and about au inch thick. The largest mass yet reported from California weighed 20 pounds. A mass consisting of a congeries of crystals, and weighing 201 ozs. (value $4,000) was found in 1865, in California, 7 miles from Georgetown, in El Dorado county. In Paraguay, pieces from 1 to 50 pounds weight were taken from a mass of rock which fell from one of the highest mountains. Several specimens weighing 16 pounds have been found in the Ural, and one of 27 pounds ; and near Miask, in the vaUey of Taschku Targanka, iu 1842, a mass was detached weighing 96 pounds troy. This mass is now in the Museum of Mining Engineers at St. Petersburg. A mass found recently in Australia, called the \"Blanch Barkley Nugget \" had the enormous weight of 146 lbs., and only 6 ozs. of it were gangue ; and one stdl larger, from Ballarat, weighed 184 lbs. 8 ozs., and yielded \u00a38,376 1 0s. 6d. sterling of gold. The yield of gold mines has very much increased in amount since the discovery of the mines"], [65, "SILVER. 9 of California. The mines of South America and Mexico were estimated by Humboldt, over 00 years since, to yield annually $11,500,000, which much exceeds the present proceeds. Brazil has furnished about 17,500 pounds troy per year. It is estimated that, between 1790 and 1830, Mexico produced $31,250,000 in gold, Chili $13,450,000, and Buenos Ayres $19,500,000, making an average annual yield of $16,050,000. The Russian mines in 1 846 produced about $16,500,000 ; and in 1851, $15,000,000. The yield of Califoruia in 1849, the first year after the dis covery of the gold, was $5,000,000. It rapidly increased from that year until 1853, wlien it was nearly $60,000,000. Since then it has diminished, and in 1866 the amount was but $27,000,000. Montana, Colorado, Idaho, and Nevada, raise the total from the United States for the year 1866 to $86,000,000, with $20,000,000 besides of silver. Australia produced $60,000,000 for a number of years ; but for 1863, 1864, 1865, the average was not above $30,000,000, one fourth to one-third of which came from the auriferous quartz. The gold is obtained from the auriferous quartz by pulverizing, and then treating the finely powdered quartz with mercury, a method weU known to the ancients. This metal dissolves out the gold, producing an amalgam which, by straining and distiUation, yields the gold. The auri ferous pyrite is first powdered, and then ro_sted iu an oven of peculiar construction until the sulphur is driven off. The residue, according to one process, pronounced the best, is treated with chlorine gas, and tho metals thus converted into chlorids, of which the chlorid of gold is soluble. This is removed and then treated with protosulphate of iron, when the gold is deposited. According to another process, the residue is fused with litharge, and the gold is thus combined with lead, and afterward obtained from the lead by cupellation. By a third process, the aurifer ous pyrite, especially when cupriferous, is concentrated into a copper matt by partial roasting and fusion ; the matt is then roasted, and the oxyd of copper taken up by dilute sulphuric acid, leav ing the gold and silver in the residue. 2.

Also occurs disseminated, but usuaUy invisibly, in native copper, galena, chalcocite, etc. _ The mines of Kongsberg in Norway, have afforded magnificent specimens of native silver. One among the splendid suite from this locality in the Royal coUection at Copenhagen, weighs up wards of 5 cwt., and recently two masses have been obtained weighing severaUy 238 and 436 pounds. The principal Saxon localities are at Freiberg, Schneeberg, and Johanngeorgenstadt; the Bohemian, at Przibram, and Joachimsthal. A mass weighing 60 lbs. from the Himmelsfurst mine near Freiburg had G. = 10*840. It also occurs in smaU quantities with other ores, at An dreasberg, iu the Hartz; in Suabia; Hungary; at Allemont in Dauphiny; in the Ural near Beresof; in the Altai, at Zme'off ; and in some of the Cornish mine3. Mexico and Peru have been the most productive countries in sUver. In Mexico, it has been obtained mostly from its ores, whUe in Peru it occurs principaUy native. A Mexican specimen from Batopilas weighed when obtained 400 pounds ; and one from Southern Peru (mines of Huantaya) weighed over 8 cwt. During the first eighteen years of the present century, more than 8,180,000 marks of sdver were alibi aed by the mines of Guanaxuato alone. In Durango, Sinaloa, and Sonora, in Northern Mexico, are noted mines affording native sUver. In the United States it is disseminated through much of the copper of Michigan, occasionally in spots of some size, and sometimes in cubes, skeleton octahedrons, etc., at various mines. It has been observed at a mine a mile south of Sing Sing prison, which was formerly worked for silver ; at the Bridgewater copper mines, New Jersey ; in interesting specimens at King's mine, Davidson Co., N.

Var.\u2014 (1) Svanberg makes the Platinum of Nos. 2, 7, 8=Fe Pt3; Fe Pt4; (2) that of 3, 4, 5 = Fe Pt1. The last is called Iron-Platinum (Eisenplatin, Breith.); G.=14-6\u2014 15-8, H.=6. Pyr., etc. \u2014 Infusible. Not affected by borax or salt of phosphorus, except in the state of fine dust, when reactions for iron and copper may be obtained. Soluble only in heated nitro muriatic acid. Acts sUghtly on the magnet ; this property has been supposed to depend on the amount of iron it contains ; but Kokscharof states that platinum masses from Nischne Tagilsk are magneti-polar, and attract iron filings far more strongly than the ordinary magnet. Obs. \u2014 Platinum was first found in pebbles and small grains, associated with iridium, osmium, palladium, gold, copper, and chromite, in the alluvial deposits of the river Pinto, in the district of Choco, near Popayan, in South America, where it received its name platina, from plata, silver. Iu the province of Antioquia, in BrazU, it has been found in auriferous regions in syenite (Bous singault). In Russia, where it was first discovered in 1822, it occurs at Nischne Tagilsk, and Goroblago dat, in the Ural, in alluvial material ; the gravel has been traced to a great extent up Mount La Martiane, which consists of crystaUine rocks ; in Nischne TagUsk, it has been found with chro mite in serpentine. Formerly used as coins by the Russians. Russia affords annually about 800 cwt. of platinum, which is nearly ten times the amount from BrazU, Columbia, St. Domingo, and Borneo. The amount coined from 1826 to 1844, equaUed two and a half millions of doUars. Platinum is also found ou Borneo, which furnishes 600 to 800 lbs. anuuaUy ; in the sands of the Rhine ; at St. Aray, val du Drac ; county of Wicklow, Ireland; on the river Joc-ky. St. Domin go; according to report, in Choloteca and Gracias, in Honduras; in California, in the Kdamath region, at Cape Blanco, etc., but not abundant; in traces with gold in Rutherford Co., North Carolina ; at St. Francois Beauce, etc., Canada East. Although platinum generally occurs in quite smaU grains, masses are sometimes found of con siderable magnitude. A mass weighing 1,088 grains was brought by Humboldt from South Amer ica, and deposited in the Berlin museum ; specific gravity 18'94. In 1822, a mass from Coudoto was deposited in the Madrid museum, measuring two iuches and four lines in diameter, and weighing 11,641 grains. A specimen was found in the year 1827, in the Ural, not far from the Demidoff mines, which weighed lO-^V Russian pounds, or 1157 pounds troy, and simUar masses are not uncommon; the largest yet seen weighed 21 pounds troy, and is in the Demidoff cabinet. The metal platinum was brought from Choco, S. A., by UUoa, a Spanish traveUer in America, in the year 1735, and from Carthagena, by Charles Wood, who procured it in Jamaica. UUoa speaks of specula made by the people of the country, of a peculiar metal, which Brownrigg says was \"platina,\" and the latter mentions a \"pummel of a sword,\" and other articles of platinum, received by him from Carthagena. 4.

The rocks affording the metal and its ores are mostly clay shales or schists of different geological ages. At Cividale, iu Venetian Lombardy, it is found in a marl regarded as a part of the Eocen3 nummulitic beds. Mercury has been observed occasionally in drift; and near Eszbetek, in Tran sylvania, and also Newmarkt, in Galicia, springs, issuing from the Carpathian sandstone, some times bear along globules of mercury. Its most important miues are those of Idria, in Carniola, and Almaden in Spaiu. At Idria it occurs interspersed through a clay slate, from which it is obtained by washing. It is found in smaU quantities at Wolfstein and Morsfeld, in the Palatinate, in Carinthia, Hungary, Peru, and other countries ; also at Peyrat le Chateau, in the department of the Haute Vienne, in a disintegrated granite, unaccompanied by cinnabar; in CaUfornia, especiaUy at the Pioneer mine, in the Napa Valley, where some of the quartz geodes contain several pounds of mercury. 9.

At Turinsk, in the Urals, in fine crystals. Common in CornwaU, at many of the mines near Redruth; and also in considerable quantities at the Consolidated mines, Wheal BuUer, and others Brazil, ChUi, Bolivia, and Peru afford native copper; a mass now in the museum at Lisbon supposed to be from a valley near Bahia, weighs 2,616 pounds; north of Tres Puntos, desert of Atacama a large vein was discovered in 1859. In Bolivia, at Corocoro, in sandstone, and called in commerce \"Barilla de Cobre\" (copper barilla). Also found at some localities in China and Japan. ,_,.._ . , . - This metal has been found native throughout the red sandstone (Tnassico-Jurassic) region of tho eastern United States, in Massachusetts, Connecticut, and more abundantly in New Jersey, where it has been met with sometimes in flue crystalline masses, especiaUy at New Brunswick, SomervUle, Schuyler's mines, and Flemington. One mass from near SomervUle, ou the premises of J C Van Dyke Esq , of N. Brunswick, weighed 78 pounds, and is said originally to have weighed 128^ Near N. Brunswick a vein or sheet of copper, a hne or so thick, has been traced for several rods Near New Haven, Conn., a mass was formerly found weighing 90 pounds. No known locality exceeds in the abundance of native copper the Lake Superior copper region near Kewenaw Point, where it exists in veins that intersect the trap aud sandstone. The annual yield of native copper at the present time is about 8,000 tons. Masses of great size were observed in this district near the Ontanagon river, by Mr. Schoolcraft, in 1821. The largest single mass yet found was discovered in February, 1857, inthe Minnesota mine, in the belt ot com-lomerate, which forms the foot-waU of the vein. It was 45 feet in length, 22 feet at the greatest width, and the thickest part was more than 8 feet. It contained over 90 p. c. copper, and weighed about 420 tons. This copper coutains silver, sometimes in visible grams, lumps, or strings, \u00b0and occasionaUy a mass of copper, when poUshed, appears sprinkled with large silver spots, resembling, as Dr. Jackson observes, a porphyry with its feldspar crystals The copper occurs in trap or sandstone, near the junction of these two rocks, and has probably been produced through the reduction of copper ores. It is associated with prehnite, datolite, analcite, laumon tite pectolite, epidote, chlorite, wollastonite, and sometimes coats amygdules of calcite, etc.,^ in amygdaloid Strings of copper often reticulate through crystals of analcite and prehnite. Pseudomorphs after scalenohedrons of calcite are sometimes met with. Besides this occurrence in the vicinity of trap, it is also in some parts osthe Kewenaw region distributed widely in grains through the sandstone. , , T , Native copper occurs sparingly in California; at the Union and Keystone, Napoleon and Lancha Plana mines in Calaveras Co. ; iu the Cosumnes mine, Amador Co. ; in serpentine, in fata. .Barbara Co.

A fragment of iron found near KnoxviUe, Tenn., but of uncertain exact loc-aUty and possibly meteoric, afforded Genth (ib., xxvin. 246) Iron 99*79, nickel 0*14, mag nesium 0-022, calcium 0-121, sUieium 0-075, cobalt trace= 100-148. Cramer describes a mass weigh ing four pounds, obtained in the mine of Hackenburg. It is said to have been observed in thin lamin\u00e6 in an ironstone conglomerate in Brazil, and in lava in Auvergne ; also in the keuper in Thuringia, in an argiUaceous sandstone, containing fossUs ; it afforded but a trace of nickel : G.= 524, (Pogg., lxxxviii. 1853, 145, where other localities are mentioned); also at Chotzen hi Bohe mia, in a limestone (the Planerkalki, affording on analysis Fe 98-83, graphite 0\"74, As 0-32, Ni 0-61, aud thought to be possibly an ancient meteorite (Jahrb. G. Reichs., viii. 354). The presence of metaUic iron in grains in basaltic rocks (from Giant's Causeway, etc.) has been announced by Dr. Andrews. After pulverizing the rock and separating by means of a magnet the grains that were attracted by it, he subjected the grains to the action of an acid solution of sul phate of copper in the field of a microscope, w*hich salt, when there is a trace of pure iron present, gives a deposit of copper ; and in his trials there were occasional deposits of copper in crystalline bunches. It has been noticed in other related rocks. Meteoric iron usuaUy contains 1 to 20 per cent, of nickel besides a small percentage of other metals, as cobalt, manganese, tin, copper, chromium ; also phosphorus common as a phosphuret, sulphur in sulphurets, carbon in some instances, chlorine. For a review of papers on meteoric iron, see Rammelsberg's Handbuch der Mineralchemie (Liepzig, 1860). Tho following are a few analyses: 1, Berzelius (Ac. H.

The phosphorus in the analyses is combined with iron as Schreibersite ; the sulphur as Troilite; the magnesia, in anal. 5, with the silica prob ably as Enstatite. Among large iron meteorites, the Gibbs meteorite, in the Vale College cabinet, weighs 1,635 lbs. ; length three feet four inches ; breadth two feet fuur inches ; height one foot four inches. It was brought from Red River. The Tucson meteorite, now in the Smithsonian Institution, weighs 1 ,400 lbs. ; it was originaUy from Sonora. It is ring-shaped, and is 49 inches iu its greatest diam eter. Still more remarkable masses exist in South America ; one was discovered by Don Rubin do Celis in the district of Chaco-Gualamba, whose weight was estimated at 32,000 lbs. ; and another was found at Bahia in Brazil, whose solid contents are at least twenty-eight cubic feet, and weight 14,000 lbs. The Siberian meteorite, discovered by PaUas, weighed originaUy 1,600 lbs. and contained imbedded crystals of chrysolite. Smaller masses are quite common. Meteoric iron is perfectly maUeable, and may be readily worked iu a forge, and put to the same uses as manu factured iron. Bahr has observed grains of native iron iu a fragment of petrified wood. The iron was mixed with limonite and organic matter, and is supposed to have been produced by the deoxydation of a salt of iron by the organic matter of the wood. He caUs the iron Sideroferrile. Von Dechon reports that an artificial iron has been observed by him, which has cubic cleavage. (Verh. nat. Ver. Bonn, 1861.)"], [73, "ZINC 17 14. ZINC. Hexagonal, Rose. Cleavage : basal perfect.

It should be stated that the zinc said to come from the Melbourne basalt was found by a quarryman and not by a scientific observer, and that therefore there may be an error with regard to its actually having been taken from the basalt. The existence of native zinc seems still to need confirmation. Stolba has recently obtained artificiaUy hexagonal crystals of zinc, six-sided prisms with low pyramidal terminations (J. pr.

The crystals often contain numerous microscopic cavities, as detected by Brewster, and some are rendered nearly black by their number ; and around these cavities the diamond shows evidence, by polarized light, of compression, as if from pressure in the included gas when the diamond was crystaUized. Sometimes crystals bear impressions of other crystals. The back planes of diamonds reflect aU the light that strikes them at an angle exceeding 24\u00b0 13', and hence comes the peculiar briUiancy of the gem. The refraction of Ught by the diamond is often irregular, probably arising from the cause which has produced the convex forms. In some plates from crystals, Descloiseaux has observed a fixed star of six symmetrical rays, and in others, aUied in character, the rays were replaced by three large eUiptical areas. Descloiseaux shows that the rays are symmetrical with reference to the faces of the octahedron. 2. Massive. Iu black pebbles or masses, caUed carbonado, occasionaUy 1,000 carats in weight.

As anthracite is derived from bituminous coal, by subjection to more or less heat under pressure, it is possible that the degree or condition of heating may produce an anthracite with its particles partly or wholly of the nature of the diamond, and stUl have the low specific gravity of anthracite.

Obs. \u2014 The diamond appears generaUy to occur in regions that afford a laminated granular quartz rock, caUed itacolumite, which pertains to the talcose series, and which in thin slabs is more or less flexible. This rock is found at the mines of Brazil and the Urals ; and also in Georgia and North CaroUna, where a few diamonds have been found. It has also been detected in a species of conglomerate, composed of rounded sUiceous pebbles, quartz, chalcedony, etc., cemented by a kind of ferruginous clay. Diamonds are usuaUy, however, washed out from the soU. According to M. Denis (Ann. des M., III. xix. 602) the diamond in Minas Geraes, BrazU, is found iu two different deposits ; one caUed gurgulho, consisting of broken quartz, and covered by a thin bed of sand or earth ; the other, cascalho, of rolled quartz pebbles, united by a ferruginous clay, resting usuaUy on talcose clays, the whole the debris from talcose rocks. The first deposit affords the finest diamonds, and both contain also gold, platinum, magnetic iron, rutUe, etc. The most celebrated mines are on tho rivers Jequitinhonha and Pardo, north of Rio Janeiro, where the sands (the waters being turned off) are washed by slaves. It has lately been found in Bahia, on the river Cachoeira, at the mines of Surua and Sincora ; and Damour has recognized in the sand of the locality, quartz, feldspar, rutUe, brookite, anatase, zircon, diaspore, magnetic iron, gold in grains, anhydrous phosphate of alumina and lime, a sUicate of yttria, aud a hydro-phosphate of yttria. At Bogagem, Minas Geraes, an enormous diamond of 254^ carats has been fouud ; it was a dodecahedron, with beveled edges, in which there were impressions of other diamond crystals, showing that it was originaUy one of a cluster ; it weighs, since cutting, 122 to 125 carats, and is caUed the \"Star osthe South.\" The BrazUian mines were first opened in 1727, and it is estimated that since then they have yielded two tons of diamonds. The Ural diamonds occur in the detritus along the Adolfskoi rivulet, where worked for gold, and also at other places. In India the diamond is met with at Purteal, between Hyderabad and MasuUpatam, where the famous Kohinoor was found; but there are now only two places of exploration, and these arelgt to some of the natives for less than 25 francs a year ; and if the hands find a stone worth four or five rupees (\u00a72 to $2|) a month, they consider themselves fortunate. To such a state are the famous mines of Golconda now reduced. They are obtained also near Parma in Bundelcund, where some of the most magnificent specimens have been found; also on the Mahanuddy near EUore. The locaUty on Borneo is at Pontiana, on the west side of the Ratoos mountain. The river Gunil, in the province of Constantine in Africa, is reported to have afforded some diamonds. In the United States a few crystals have been met with in Rutherford Co., N. C, and Hall Co.."], [79, "23 DIAMOND. Ga. (Am. J. Sci. II. ii. 253, and xv. 373); they occur also at Portis mine, Franklin Co., N. C. (Genth); one handsome one, over \u00a3 in. in diameter, in the viUage of Manchester, opposite Richmond, Va. In California, at Cherokee ravine, in Butte Co. ; also in N. San Juan, Nevada Co. ; in French Corral, one of l-J carats; at Forest HiU, El Dorado Co., of l\u00a3 carats; Fiddletown, Amador Co.; near PlacerviUe. Reported from Idaho. In Austraha, in the vaUey of the Turon ; in the bed of the Macquarie ; mouth of Pyramid Creek ; on Calcula Creek ; and also in Victoria; also in West Austraha, at Freemautle. In Brazil the diamond has been found massive, in smaU black pebbles, caUed carbonado, having the specific gravity 3-012 \u2014 3 416. They proved on trial to be puro carbon excepting 2'07 to 0-27 per cent. This compact diamond is sold in the region at 75 cents the carat of three and one-sixth grains troy, and the masses are sometimes carats in weight. Brewster finds that diamonds contain generaUy numerous microscopic cavities, and some are rendered nearly black by their number ; and arouud these cavities the diamond shows evidence of compression, as if from pressure in the included gas when the diamond was crystallizing. Diamonds have been observed having impressions of other crystals. The largest diamond of which we have any knowledge is mentioned by Tavernier as in posses sion osthe Great Mogul. It weighed originaUy 900 carats, or 2769'3 grains, but was reduced by cutting to 861 grains. It has the form and size of half a hen's egg. It was found in 1550 in the mine of Colone. The Pitt or Regent diamoud weighs but 136*25 carats, or 419^ grains; but is of unblemished transparency and color. It is cut in the form of a brilliant, and is estimated at \u00a3125,000. Tho Kohinoor measured, on its arrival in England, about If inches in its greatest diameter, over | of an inch in thickness, and weighed 1 867s,- carats, and was cut with many facets. It has since been recut, and reduced to a diameter of l-fe by If nearly, and thus diminished over one-third in weight. It is supposed by Mr. Tennant to have been originally a dodocahedron, and he suggests that the great Russian diamond and another large slab weighing 130 carats were actuaUy cut from the original dodecahedron. Tavernier gives the original weight at 787+ carats. The Rajah of Mattan has in his possession a diamoud from Borneo, weighing 367 carats. The mines of BrazU were not known to afford diamonds tiU the commencement of the 18th century. Colorless diamonds are in general most highly esteemed. When cut and polished, a diamond of the purest water in England, weighing one carat, is valued at \u00a312 ; and the value of others is calculated by multiplying the square of the weight in carats by 1 2, except for those exceeding 20 carats, the value of which increases at a much more rapid rate. This rule is scarely regarded in market, as the standard of purity and taste for different countries differs, and the slightest tinge of color affects greatly the commercial value. Blue is an exceedingly rare color; and one of this shade, the Hope diamond, weighing only 4^ carats, but of pecuUar beauty and briUiancy, is valued at \u00a325,000. A yeUowish diamond of large size (value \u00a312,000) has been found by Fremy to take a rose-red color when heated, which color it retains for two or three days, and then resumes the original yeUow. An emerald-green diamond in the Dresden Treasury weighs 314, carats. The ancient Romans had rings set with the diamond, and used the chippings for arming gravers' tools. PUny speaks of the six-angled form of the crystals of the adamas, aud their resemblance to two pyramids or tops placed base to base, a description that would apply, perhaps, as weU to a double hexagonal pyramid as to an octahedron ; yet it is probable, from the other characters men- tioned, the hardness, rarity, smaU size, use, and occurrence in gold regions, that the octahedral diamond was referred to. The adamas of the ancients included some corundum and other hard stones, and even hard metal. Theophrastus makes no mention of the true diamond. (See, on the adamas osthe ancients, King on Precious Stones and Gems, p. 19.) The method of polishing diamonds was discovered in 1456, by Louis Berquen, a citizen of Bruges, previous to which time the diamond was known in Europe only in its uncut state. It appears to have been practised loug before in India, the faceting of the Kohinoor dating far back into uncertain time. (See King, pp 30,31.) The diamond has probably proceeded, like mineral coal and oU, from the slow decomposition of vegetable material, or even from animal matters, either source affording the requisite carbon ; but it has been formed under those conditions as to heat that has produced the metamorphism of argillaceous and arenaceous schists and their auriferous quartz veius ; since it is found exclusively in gold regions, or in the sands derived from gold-bearing rocks. The schists that were altered at the time may have previously been shales impregnated with petroleum, or other carbonaceous substances (hvdrocarburets) of organic origin. Chancourtois observes that the formation from a hydrocarburetted vapor or gas is analogous to that of sulphur from hydrosulphuretted emana- tions. In the oxydation of the latter by the humid process, the hydrogen becomes oxydized, and only a part of the sulphur changes to sulphurous acid, the rest remaining as sulphur. So in the humid oxydation of a carburetted hydrogen, the hydrogen is oxydized, part of the carbon becomes carbonic acid, and the rest remains as carbon and may form crystaUized diamond."], [80, "24 NATIVE ELEMENTS. 25.

A fine variety of graphite occurs at Borrowdale in Cumberland, in nests in trap, which occurs in clay slate ; in Glenstiathfarrar in Invernesshire, forms nests in gneiss ; at Arendal in Norway, in quartz ; at Pargas in Finland ; in the Urals, Siberia, Finland ; in various parts of Austria ; Prus- sia ; France ; at Craigman iu Ayrshire, it occurs in coal beds, which have been altered by contact with trap. In Irkutsk, iu the Tunkinsk mts., at the very valuable Mariinskoi graphite mine, a large mass has been obtained, having the structure osthe wood from which it was formed. Large quantities are brought from the East Indies. Forms beds in gneiss, at Sturbridge, Mass., where it presents a structure between scaly and fiue granular, and an occasional approximation to distinct crystaUizations ; also at North Brook- field, Brimfield, and Hinsdale, Mass. ; extensively in Cornwall, near the Housatonic, and in Ash- ford, Conn. ; also in Brandon, Vt. ; at GreuvUle, C. E., associated with sphene and tabular spar in granular limestone. Foliated graphite occurs in large quantities at Ticonderoga, on Lake George ; also upon Roger's Rock, associated with pyroxene and sphene. Near Amity, Orange Co., N.

The crude antimony of the shops is obtained by simple fusion, which separates the accompanying rock. From this product most of the pharmaceutical preparations of antimony are made, and the pure metal extracted.

According to Dioscorides, it was prepared for this purpose by enclosing it in a lump of dough, and then burning it in the coals till reduced to a cinder. It was then extinguished with milk and wine, and again placed upon coals and blown till ignition: after which the heat was discontinued, lest, as Pliny says, \" plumbum fiat,\" it become lead. It hence appears that the metal antimony was occasionaUy seen by the ancients, though not distinguished from lead. On cryst. see Brenner, Ber. Ak. Wien, IL 1864, 436.

SIMPLE SULPHIDS, TELLUKIDS, SELENIDS, ARSENIDS, AKTIMONIDS, BISMUTHIDS, PHOSPHIDS, OF METALS OF THE GOLD, IRON, AND TIN GROUPS Three divisions of these Sulphids, Arsenids, etc, are here recognized : (1) a basic division, in which the atomic ratio between the sulphur or arsenic metal and the others is 1 to more than one ; (2) a proto division, with the ratio 1:1; (3) a deulo division, with the ratio 1 : 2. In these ratios, and in stating the formulas beyond, the halved atomic weights of arsenic, antimony, and bismuth are in view, as stated on p. 26. In the third division, some species are included which appear to be combinations of deuto and proto compounds. The mineral chalcopyrite is sometimes referred to the double-binary sulphids, ou the ground of its containing, along with a protosulphid, the sulphid Fe2 S3 ; but as the existence of a sesqui sulphid Fe2 S3 is not established, while Fe S2 is the one of common occurrence, the more probable view osthe sulphid is that it consists of two sulphids Fe S and Fe S2 in combination. This view is sustained by the near isomorphism of pyrite and clialcopyrito. The above remark applies also to bornite and pyrrhotite, in which Fe2 Ss has been supposed to be present. Fe2 S3, it should be noted, equals Fe S + Fe c.2. Linn\u00e6ite and carroliie come into the same category. In an article in the American Journal of Science, vol. xliv. 1867, the author gives reasons for beheving that the compounds crystallizing iu hexagonal forms have the number of atoms of the negative element 3, or a multiple of 3, and in tetragonal forms, a multiple of 4 ; whence it foUows, that while ordinary isometric blende, or sulphid of zinc, for example, may be Zn S, the hexagonal, 3"], [90, "34 SULPHIDS, ETC. or wnrtzite, is probably Zn3 S3. The principle, if real, has a very wide appUcation among chemii and mineral species. I. BASIC OR DTSCRASITE DIVISION. 35. Dtsorasite Ag2 Sb 37. Dometkite \u2022 Gus As' (B) \" Ag'Sb 38.

Domeyko found a mass of ore from ChanarcUlo, Chdi, whioh was mainly impure chloro bromid of silver externally, to contain within (Tr. de Ensayes, 238, 1858) 55-9 p. c. of chlorid of silver, 15-1 of an antimonid of sUver, with 14-5 of carbonates and 14-2 ochreous clay; and this antimouid, he says, consists of Sb 36, Ag 64, and \"appears to constitute a distinct species.\" The formula would be Ag Sb. This species is not mentioned in his Mineralogy of 1860. Domeyko states (Min. 190, 1860) that at Chanarcillo a finely granular grayish-white sUver ore, disseminated in grains, taking the lustre of sUver when rubbed, afforded him 4 to 6 p. e. of anti mony; that osthe Descubridora mine 4-1 Ag; that osthe Rosario mine 5*8 p. c. He also states that the filamentous sUver of Bolivia contains Sb 3*7, As 2*3 p. c. 35D.

It appears, sometimes, at least, to be a mixture of arsenite of copper with domeykite. and some sulphid of copper. Rammelsberg treated one specimen with muriatic acid, and analyzed the soluble and insoluble portions separately, obtaining \u2022 1. Insoluble As 13-89 Cu 12-81 S 2-20 gangue 0-70=29-60 2. Soluble Is 3-70 Cu 62'29 fi 5*83 = 71'_2. The insoluble portion contains, therefore, As 4*16, Cu 13-89, with 10-85 of sulphid of copper; corresponding, the last excluded, to arsenic 23-04, copper 76-96 = 100. Von KobeU (J. pr.

Blythe concludes, as a mean of many analyses, that the arsenid of copper contained in condur rite consists of arsenic 28'85, copper 71*15, which corresponds with the domeykite ; and Faraday's analysis (Phil.

The mipersulphuretted lead gave Johnston, Pb S 90-38, S 8*71. R. Hofmann found 8*7 p. c. of sulphur in a galenite from New-Sinka, Transylvania, along with 51-30 of sulphate of lead. Pyr. \u2014 In the open tube gives sulphurous fumes. B.B. on charcoal fuses, emits sulphurous fumes, coats the coal yellow, and yields a globule of metaUic lead, soluble in nitric acid. Obs. \u2014 Occurs in beds and veins, both in crystaUine and uncrystalline rocks. It is often asso ciated with pyrite, marcasite, blende, chalcopyrite, arsenopyrite, etc., in a gangue of quartz, calcite, barite or fluor, etc. ; also with cerussite, anglesite, and other salts of lead, which are frequent results of its alteration. It is also common with gold, and in veins of sUver ores. E. J. Chapman remarks that galenite is seldom much argentiferous except when it is associated with mispickel or some other arsenical ore. At Freiberg in Saxony it occupies veins in gneiss ; in Spain, in granite at Linares, and also in Catalonia, Grenada, and elsewhere : at Clausthal and Neudorf in the Harz, and at Przibram in Bohemia, it forms veins in clay slate ; in Styria it occurs in the same kind of rock in beds ; at Sala in Sweden it forms veins in granular limestone ; through the graywacke of LeadhUls and the kUlas of CornwaU, in veins ; in mountain limestone in Derbyshire, Cumberland, and the northern districts of England, and also in Bleiberg, and the neighboring localities of Carinthia. In the English mines it is associated with calcite, pearl spar, fluor, barite, witherite, calamine, and blende. Other localities are Joachimsthal, where it is worked principaUy for the silver ; Przibram in Bohemia; in Nertschinsk, East Siberia; in Algeria; near Cape of Good Hope; in Austraha; ChiU; Bolivia, etc. Extensive deposits of this ore in the United States exist in Missouri, Illinois, Iowa, and Wis consin. The ore occurs in stratified limestone, of different periods of the Lower Silurian era, especiaUy the Trenton, associated with blende, smithsonite (\"dry-bone \" of the miners), calcite, pyrite, and often an ore of copper and cobalt. The mines of Missouri were discovered in 172o. by Francis Renault and Mr. la Motte ; they are situated in the counties of Washington, Jefferson, and Madison. Of the Upper Mississippi lead region, five-sixths, says Whitney (Rep. Dp. Miss. region, 1862), belong to Wisconsin, and the richest portion is in that part of the State adjoining Illinois and Iowa. The productive lead district is bounded on the west, north, and east by the Mississippi, Wisconsin, and Rock rivers. The occurrence of cale spar in the soU, or sink holes iu lines, are considered indications of lead. From a single spot, not exceeding fifty yards square, 1.500 tons of ore have been raised. Occurs also in Illinois, at Cave-in-Rock, associated with fluorite. In New York, at Rossie, St"], [98, "42 SULPHIDS, ETC. Lawrence Co., in veins from one to three or four feet in width, the crystals often very large (like f. 70, without i), with calcite, iron and copper pyrites, and some blende and celestine; near Wurtzboro, Sullivan Co., in a large vein in millstone grit, with blende, iron and copper pyrites; at Ancram, Columbia Co. ; in Ulster Co., where often in crystals with the planes 0, 1, 3-3, i-3, or like 70, except that the edges are bevelled. In Maine, veins of considerable extent exist at Lubee, where the ore is associated with chalcopyrite and blende ; also less extensively at Blue Hill Bay, Bingham, and Parsonsville. In New Hampshire, at Eaton, with blende and chalcopyrite; and also at HaverhUl, Bath, and Tamworth. In Vermont, at Thetford. In Connecticut, at Middle- town, in a vein in argUlite, massive and crystaUine. In Massachusetts, at Southampton, Leverett, and Sterling. In Pennsylvania, at PhenixviUe and elsewhere. In Virginia, at Austin's mines in Wythe Co., Walton's gold mine in Louisa Co., and other places. In Tennessee, at Brown's Creek, and at Haysboro, near NashvUle, with blende and heavy spar. In Michigan, in the region of Chocolate river and elsewhere, and Lake Superior copper districts; on the N. shore of L. Superior, in Neebing on Thunder Bay, and around Black Bay. In California, at many of the gold mines. In Nevada, abundant on Walker's river, and at Steamboat Springs, Galeua district. In Arizona, in the Castle Dome, Eureka, and other district-. In Colorado, at Pike's Peak, etc. Alt. \u2014 Minium, anglesite, cerussite, pyromorphite, wulfenite, tetrahedrite, chalcocite, diaUogite, quartz, Umonite, pyrite, pi3tomesite (pistopyrite Breith.), calamine, occur as pseudomorphs after galenite, partly from alteration, and partly through removal and substitution. A change to the carbonate (cerussite), with the setting free of sulphur, is the most common. The specimens regarded as pseudomorphs after pyromorphite, from Bernkastel on the Mosel, Breithaupt makes into a new species (B. H. Ztg., xxi. 99, 1862, xxii. 36, 18H3), which he calls plumbeine, or one species of his Sexangulites, regarding this sulphid of lead as crystaUized in hexagonal prisms, and not a pseudomorph. It has G. = 6'729 \u2014 6-87, and hexagonal cleavage. He places with it the stalactitic galena of Cornwall, Freiberg, and Przibram. A galenite occurs in Lebanon Co., Pa., which has an easy octahedral cleavage, as first observed by Dr. John Torrey. It is regarded by some as proof of dimorphism of the sulphid of lead, and by others as a result of pseudomorphism after a mineral with octahedral cleavage. See Am. J. Sci., II. xxxv. 126. Dr. Torrey observes that on moderate heating the cleavage becomes cubic. In specific gravity it does not differ from ordinary galenite. Fournetiie of Ch. Mene (C. R., li. 463), supposed to be near tetrahedrite, is pronounced by Fournet (C. R., liv. 1096) a mixture of galenite with copper ore. Artif. \u2014 Galenite is sometimes a furnace product. It has been made in crystals by heating oxyd or silicate of lead with vapor of sulphur (Wurtz) ; also by suspending sulphate of lead in a bag in water saturated with carbonic acid, and in which putrid fermentation is kept up (as by au oyster in the water), there resulting an incrustation of galenite upon the shells (Gages, Brit. Assoc, 206. 1863). 44A. Hcascolite Dana. (Galena blendosa Domeyko, Min., 168, 1860. Sulphid of lead and zinc D. Forbes, PhU. Mag., IV. xxv. 110.) The characters are mostly those of galenite. It has a grauular or saccharoidal texture, a lead-gray color rather paler than ordinary galenite, but little lustre, and is apparently homogeneous and without any mixture of blende. Domeyko obtained (1. c.) S 19-2, Pb 4S-6, Zn 256, gangue 3-1 ; which corresponds nearly to Pb S + l| Zn S. It comes from Ingahuas, in the province of Huasco, where it forms large aggregated masses or nodules in the lower part of the vein. 44B. Cuproplu-Ibite Breith. (Kupferbleispath of the Germans, Galena cobriza Domeyko), from ChUi, where it is not rare, appears to be, as Domeyko's name for it and his description impUes (Min., 1860, 168), a mere mixture of galenite and chalcocite. The structure, color, and lustre vary from those of galenite to those nearly of chalcocite and coveUite : the color a little darker, aud passing to iron-gray and indigo-blue ; the lustre generally feeble and sometimes almost want- ing, and looking, says Domeyko, \" as if sulphuret of copper were distributed through it.\" The specimens contain disseminated ores of copper, and come from a mine in Catemo (Aconcagua).

Field has named the variety analyzed by him Alisonite ; it was from Mina Grande, near Co quimbo. According to G. Ulrich, a simUar mineral occurs at M'lvor in Victoria, AustraUa. Genth suggests that this mineral may have resulted from the alteration of galenite, which is prob ably true in some cases. 45. CLAUSTHALITE.

Alt.\u2014 Blende by oxydation changes to zinc vitriol. Calamine (Zu3 Si+ 1\\ H), smithsonite (2n C), and limonite occur as pseudomorphs. The sulphate is decomposed by bi-carbonate of Ume, producing smithsonite ; and the alkaline sUicates in solution, acting on the sulphate or carbonate, afford silicate of zinc. Artif. \u2014 Blende may be made in crystals from a solution of sulphate containing some putrifying animal matter; in an experiment by Gages, using oysters for the animal matter, the sheUs were turned partly into carbonate of zinc and selenite, and some blende incrusted them. Also may be made by subjecting heated oxyd or sUicate of zinc to vapors of sulphur. Rahtite of Shepard (1. c.) is a wholly uncrystaUine blende, with G.=4*128, containing iron and copper, and probably a mere mixture of blende and other minerals. Shepard says that it occurs \" in the upper decomposed portion of the Ducktown copper lode, associated with melaconite and various mixtures of chalcopyrite, redruthite,\" ete. The specimen analyzed by Mr. Tyler for Prof. Shepard was iron-black, whUe Shepard says that the mineral is \" dark lead-gray, with a tinge of blue, not unUke some osthe ores of antimony.\" Tyler obtained (1. c) for the composition of hi3 specimen, S 33*36, Zn 47-86, Fe 6-18, Cu 14-00, giving approximately 10 S, 7 Zn, 1 Fe, 2 Cu, and equivalent to 7 Zn S + Fe S2 + Gu S, or 7 of blende, with 1 pyrite and 1 chalcocite (redruthite). Since Gu (not Cu) replaces Fe and the related metals in the sulphids, the formula cannot be (Zn, Fe, Cu) S, or that of a cupreous blende. 57. VOLTZITE. Voltzine -f-.'nw_, Ann. d. M., in.

The Argent en epis or Cuivre spiciforme of Haiiy, which is merely vegetable matter impregnated with this ore, occurs at Frankenberg in Hessia, and also Mahoopeny, Penn. Under the name Cupreine, Breithaupt separates the larger part of the specimens, referred to chalcocite, on the ground aUeged that they are hexagonal instead of orthorhombic, and have a lower specific gravity. He gives for the angle between the base and a pyramidal face 117\u00b0 53' approxi- mately, and G.=5'5\u2014 5-586 of the mineral from 12 different localities. He cites Scheerer's two analyses above of the TeUemark mineral. Other localities mentioned are Kongsberg in Norway ; near Freiberg, Sadisdorf, Deutsch-Neudorf, in Saxony ; Sehmiedeberg in SUesia ; Hettstedt and Sangerhausen in Thuringia ; near Siegen ; Mt. Catini in Tuscany ; Bosgolovsk in Siberia ; Karga- Unsk Steppes in Orenberg ; Cornwall ; Eleonora and Ulrique in Mexico ; West Coast of Africa. Breithaupt is certainly iu error with regard to the CornwaU mineral, as the measurements of PhiUips and others, and recently of Maskelyne (in a letter to the author), conclusively prove ; and probably in error throughout. Beudant's name, chalcosine, has priority. We change the termination ine, which ought to be out osthe science, and substitute c for s. Chalcite (y_X\u00ab.is in Greek), Aristotle's name for the common ore of Cyprus, cannot be employed in modern mineralogy, because it has the same pro- nunciation with calcite. But with the added syUable, used above, this objection does not hold. Moreover, the word thus altered does not imply an identity of the species with that of Cyprus, about which there is yet much doubt. Alt Occurs altered to chalcopyrite, bornite, covellite, melaconite. Specimens are often penetrated with the coveUite, or indigo-copper, resulting from the altera- tion. (A) Digenite of Breithaupt (1. c.) is probably a mineral of this kind. Plattner obtained B.B., 70'2 of copper and 0-24 of sUver, whence the formula Gu S + 2 Gu S2, making it a compound of 1 chalcocite + 2 coveUite. Localities mentioned are Sangerhausen in Thuringia; Szaska in Tran- sylvania ; in the Government of Orenburg ; Platten in Bohemia ; Angola, W. Coast of Africa ; Chili, with cuproplumbite. (B) Carmenite of Hahn (1. a), from Carmen island, in the Gulf of California, approaches digenite. It is an impure chalcocite, containing visibly, as the author finds after personal examination, much coveUite. Hahn analyzed the mass by first separating into two parts, oue soluble in muriatic acid, and the other not ; and the former was then analyzed, and the composition obtained given as that of carmenite; it was S 26-22, Sb 0*97, Cu 71*30, Fe 1*37, Ag 0'05, gangue 0-77 = 100-68, corresponding to 1 chalcocite + 1 coveUite. (C) Haekisite of Shepard (Rep. on Canton Mine, cited in Am. J. Sci., II. xxii. 256 and Pratt Am. J. ScL II. xxni. 409), from Canton mine, Georgia, and later found at the Polk Co. copper mines in East Tennessee, is chalcocite with the cleavage of galena, and, as Genth has proved, is pseudomorphous after galena. Genth's many analyses of the Tennessee mineral (Am. J. ScL II. xxxiii. 194) show a variation in composition from that of chalcocite to that of a mixture with 27 p. c. of galena. Unaltered galena has been observed within crystals of harrisite both at the Georgia and Tennessee localities. Its color is dark lead-gray and bluish-black. As Genth observes, it is related to the so-called cuproplumbite (p. 42)."], [110, "54 SULPHIDS, ETC.

It"], [112, "56 SULPHIDS, ETC, has been observed in veins, with ores of iron. The Idria mines are in the Carboniferous forma tion ; those of New Almaden, California, in partiaUy altered Cretaceous or Tertiary beds. Good crystals occur in the coal formations of MoscheUandsberg and Wolfs sein in the Palatinate ; also in Japan, Mexico, and Brazil. The most important European beds of this ore are at Almaden in Spain, and at Idria in Carniola, where it is usually massive. It occurs at Reichenau in Upper Carinthia ; in beds traversing gneiss at Dunbrawa in Transylvania ; in graywacke at Windisch Kappel in Carinthia ; at Neumarktel in Carniola ; at Ripa in Tuscany ; at Schemnitz in Hungary ; in the Urals and Altai ; in China abundantly, and in Japan ; San Onofre and elsewhere in Mexico ; at Huanca Velica in Southern Peru, abundant ; in the Provinces of Coquimbo ; Copiapo in ChUi; forming extensive mines in CaUfornia, in the coast ranges at different points from Clear lake in the north (near which there is a vein in a bed of sulphur) to San Luis Obispo in the south, the prin cipal mines in which region are at New Almaden and the vicinity, in Santa Clara Co., about bO m. S.S.E. of San Francisco. Also in Idaho, in Umestone, abundant. This ore is the source of the mercury of commerce, from which it is obtained by subUmation. When pure it is identical with the manufactured vermilion of commerce. The above figure is from an elaborate paper by Schabus, Ber. Ak. Wien, vi. 63. The name Cinnabar is supposed to come from India, where it is applied to the red resin, drag. on's blood. The native cinnabar of Theophrastus is true cinnabar ; he speaks of its affording quicksilver. The Latin name of cinnabar, minium, is now given to red lead, a substance which was early used for adulterating cinnabar, and so got at last the name. It has been said (King on Precious Stones) that the word mine (miniera, Hal.) and mineral come from the Latin for quicksilver mine, miniaria (Fodina miniaria). 65. TIEMANNITE.

Obs. \u2014 Pyrite occurs abundantly in rocks of aU ages, from the oldest crystaUine to the most recent alluvial deposits. It usually occurs in smaU cubes, but often modified as above described ; also in irregular spheroidal nodules and in veins, in clay slate, argillaceous sandstones, the coal formation, etc. Cubes of gigantic dimensions have been found in some of the Cornish mines ; pentagonal dodecahedrons and other forms occur on the island of Elba, sometimes five to six inches in diameter. Large octahedral crystals are found at Persberg in Sweden. Magnificent crystals come from Peru; also from TraverseUa in Piedmont, twins of which locality are figured by Q. SeUa, one of them a large pyritohedron (f. 47 ) with a small converse pyritohedron (f. 48) astride of each of the six cubic edges. Alston-Moor, Derbyshire, Fahlun in Sweden, Kougs- berg in Norway, are weU-known locahties. Tho clay at Miinden in Hanover, and the chalk at Lewes in Surrey, have afforded some remarkable compound crystals. It has also been met with in the Vesuvian lavas in small irregular crystals.

In Wisconsin, near Mineral Point. In Illinois, near Galena, at Marsden's Diggings, in stalactites of great beauty with a surface of crystals. In N. Car., near Greensboro', GuUford Co, in crystals. Auriferous pyrite is common at the mines of Colorado, and many of those of California, as weU as in Virginia and the States south. In Canada, 2 miles N. W. of BrockviUe, a cobaltiferous var, in the Laurentian ; on the river Assumption, seignory of Daillebout, and at Escort, a niccoliferous var, containing also some cobalt. This species affords the greater part of the sulphate of iron aud sulphuric acid of commerce, and also a considerable portion of the sulphur and alum. The auriferous variety is worked for gold in many gold regions. The name pyrite is derived from rfft fire, and aUudes to the sparks from friction. PUny men tions several things a3 included under the name (xxxvi. 30): (1) a stone used for grindstones; (2) a kind which so readily fires punk or sulphur that he distinguishes it as pyrites vivus, and which may have been flint or a related variety of quartz, as has been supposed, but more proba bly was emery, since he describes it as the heaviest of aU; (3) a kind resembling brass or copper: (4) a porous stone, perhaps a sandstone or buhrstone. The brassy kind was in aU probabdity our pyrite. But with it were confounded copper pyrites (chalcopyrite), besides marcasite and pyrrho tite, although these three kinds of pyrites mil of the scintillations. Iu fact. Dioscorides calls pyrite an ore of copper, yet in the next sentence admits that some kinds contain no copper ; and. moreover, he states that the mineral gives sparks. This confounding of iron and copper pyrites is apparent also in the descriptions of the vitriols (sulphates of iron and copper) by Pliny an other ancient writers, and equally so in the mineralogy of the world for more than fifteen cen turies after Pliny, as is even now apparent in the principal languages of Europe. Kupferwasser (copper-water) of the Germans being the copperas of the Enghsh and couperose of the French. It is quite probable that copperas and couperose are in fact corruptions osthe German word, instead of derivatives from cuprosa or cuprirosa, as usuaUy stated, for the Latin u would not have become ou in French. Under the name marcasite or marchasite, of Spanish or Arabic origin, the older mineralogists Henckel, WaUerius, Linn\u00e6us, etc, included distinctively crystallized pyrite, the cubic preemi nently ; the nodular and other varieties being caUed pyrites, and the less yeUow or brownish and softer kinds, wasserkies, this last including our marcasite and pyrrhotite, and some true pyrite. Werner first made pyrrhotite a distinct species. Alt. \u2014 Pyrite readUy changes to a sulphate of iron by oxydation, some sulphur being set free. Also to hmonite on its surface, and afterward throughout, by the action of a solution of bicar bonate of lime carrying off the sulphuric acid as change proceeds, and from limonite to red oxyd of iron. Green vitriol, Umonite, gothite, hematite, quartz, graphite, ochreous clay, occur as pseu domorphs after pyrite. Artif. \u2014 May be made by the slow reduction of sulphate of sesquioxyd of iron in presence of some carbonate. 76. HAUERITE. Hauerit Haid., Nat. Abh. Wien, L 101, 107, 4to, 1847.

It is there associated witjj tin ore, galenite, bornite, chalcocite, tetrahedrite, and blende. The copper beds of __h* lun in Sweden, are composed principaUy of this ore, which occurs in large masses, surrounded by a coating of serpentine, and imbedded in gneiss. At Rammelsberg, near Goslar in the Har?, it forms a bed in argiUaceous schist, and is associated with pyrite, galenite, blende, and minute portions of sUver and gold. The Kurprinz mine at Freiberg affords weU-defined crystals. It occurs also in the Bannat. Hungary, and Thuringia ; in Scotland in Kirkcudbrightshire, Perth shire and elsewhere ; in Tuscany (analyses 3, 4) ; in South Australia ; in fine crystals at Cerro Blanco, near Copiapo, ChUi. In Maine, at the Lubec lead mines ; at Dexter. In N. Hamp., at Franconia, in gneiss ; at Unity, on the estate of Jas. Neal; Warren, on Davis's farm; at Eaton, 2 m. N.E. of Atkins's tavern ; Lyme, E. of E. VUlage ; HaverhUL etc. In Vermont, at Stafford, Corinth, Waterbury, Shrewsbury. In Mass., at the Southampton lead mines ; at Turner's faUs on the Connecticut, near Deer field, and at Hatfield and Sterhng. In Connecticut, at Bristol and Middletown, some times in crystals. In New York, at the Ancram lead mine ; five mUes from Rossie, beyond De Long's mUls at the Rossie lead mines, in crystals; in crystals and massive near Wurtzboro', Sullivan Co.: very large crystals and massive at EUenviUe, Ulster Co. In Pennsylvania, at PhenixviUe; at Pottstown, Chester Co. (Elizabeth mine). In Maryland, in the Catoctin mts. ; between New-"], [123, "67 SULPHIDS, ETC. market and Taneytown ; near Finksbury, Carroll Co., abundant (Patapsco and other mines), with bornite, carrollite, and malachite. In Virginia, at the Phenix copper mines, Fauquier Co, and the Walton gold mine, Louisa Co. In N. Carolina, near Greensboro', abundant massive (Fenress or North CaroUna, and MaccuUoch mines), along with spathic iron in a quartz gaugue. In Ten nessee,. 30 mUes from Cleveland, in Polk Co. (Hiwassee mines), with black copper and pyrites. In Cal, in different mines along a belt between Mariposa Co. and Del Norte Co., on west side of, and parallel to, the chief gold belt ; occurring massive in Calaveras Co, at Union, Keystone, Empire, Napoleon, Campo Seco, and Lancha Plana mines, and in crystals on Domingo Creek ; in Mariposa Co, at the La Victoire and Haskell claims, and ou the ChowchUlas river; in Amador Co., at the Newton mine ; in El Dorado Co, at the Cosumnes, Hope VaUey, Bunker Hill El Dorado, Excelsior mines ; in Plumas Co., at the Genesee and Cosmopolitan miues. In Canada, in Perth and near Sherbrooke ; extensively mined at Bruce mines, on Lake Huron. The CornwaU chalcopyrite is not a rich ore ; what is picked for sale at Redruth rarely yielding 12, generaUy only 7 or 8, and occasionaUy but 3 or 4 per cent, of metal. Its richness may in general be judged of by the color ; if of a fine yellow hue, and readUy yielding to the hammer, it may be considered a good ore; but if hard, and pale-yeUow, it is poor from admixture with pyrite. Readily distinguished from pyrite, which it somewhat resembles, by its inferior hardness ; it may be cut by the knife, whUe pyrite wiU strike fire with steel. The effects of nitric acid are also different. Differs from gold in being brittle, on which account it cannot be cut off in slices, like the latter metal ; and, moreover, gold is not attacked by nitric acid. Occurs as a furnace product near Goslar. Alt. \u2014 Changes on exposure with moisture, especially if heated, to a sulphate. Malachite, coveUite, chrysocoUa, black copper, chalcocite, and oxyd of iron, are other forms into which it is sometimes altered. Named from x^'^i orass, and pyrites, by Henckel, who observes in his Pyritology (1725) that chalcopyrite is a good distinctive name for the ore. Aristotle caUs the copper ore of Cyprus chakilis; and Dioscorides uses the same word ; but what ore was intended is doubtful. There is no question that copper-pyrites was included by Greek and Latin authors under the name pyrites (q. v, p. 64). 79. BARNHARDTITE. Genth, Am. J.

Also in crystals at Mine La Motte, Missouri. See analyses above for the varieties at these localities. At Chatham, Conn, the chloanthite (chathamite) occurs in mica slate, associated generaUy with arsenopyrite and sometimes with niccolite. This species and the cobaltite were confounded by the mineralogists of last century; and although right chemical distinctions were early indicated by those of Sweden, doubts continued untd the analyses by John and Stromeyer in 1811 and 1817. Rome de Lisle brought out and figured correctly the crystallographic distinctions in 1772 and 1783; but the value of his deter minations were not generally appreciated. Alt. \u2014 Occurs altered to erythrite (arsenate of cobalt), a change due to the oxydation of the arsenic and cobalt on exposure to moisture. 84. SKUTTERUDITE.

Very Uable to decomposition ; more so than pyrite. The kyrosite Breith, caUed also weisskupfererz, Char, 1823, 111, 246, and arsenid of copper, is from the Mine Briccius, near Annaberg. A ChUian weisskupfererz contains, according to Plattner (Breith, in Pogg, lvUi. 281), 12-9 p. c. of copper, besides iron and sulphur, but no arsenic. Another so caUed, from Schneeberg, is, according to v. KobeU (J. pr. Ch, lxxL 159), impure marcasite. Weisskupfererz (also caUed weisskupfer and weisserz) occurs as the name of a species in all the mineralogical works of last century, from Henckel's Pyrotology, in 1725, where it is called a whitish copper ore, and placed near tetrahedrite ; and the light color, from Henckel down, is attributed to the presence of arsenic. It has finaUy been run out as mostly impure marcasite; and the domeykite and related species (p. 36) are now the only true white copper. Obs \u2014 The spear variety occurs abundantly in the plastic clay of the brown coal formation at Littmitz and AltsatteU, near Carlsbad in Bohemia, and is extensively mined for its sulphur and the manufacture of the sulphate of iron. The radiated variety occurs at the same place ; also at Joachimsthal, aud in several parts of Saxony. The cockscomb variety occurs with galenite and fluor-spar iu Derbyshire ; crystals near Castleton in Derbyshire ; near Alston Moor in Cumber land ; near Tavistock in Devonshire ; and radiated at East Wheal Rose and elsewhere in Cornwall. At Warwick, N. V, it occurs in simple and compound crystals, in granite, with zircon. Hustis's farm, in Phillipstowu, N. V, affords small crystals, referred by Beck to this species, occurring in magnesian limestone. Massive fibrous varieties abound throughout the mica slate of New Eng land, particularly at Cummington, Mass, where it is associated with cummingtonite and garnet. Occurs at Lane's mine, in Monroe, Conn, and in the topaz and fluor vein in TrumbuU ; also in gneiss at East Haddam ; at HaverhiU, N. H., with common pyrite. In Canada in Neebing. a few mUes east of the Kamanistiquia R. Marcasite is employed in the manufacture of sulphur, sulphuric acid, and sulphate of iron, though less frequently than pyrite. Its color is considerably paler than that of ordinary pyrite. The word marcasite, of Arabic or Moorish origin (and variously used by old writers), was the name of common crystaUized pyrite among miners and mineralogists in later centuries, untd near the close osthe last. It was first given to this species by Haidinger in 1845. The species is probably recognized by Agricola under the name wasserkies and lebererz ; and also under the same by Cronstedt ; and it is Wasserkies of Hausmann in both editions of his great work. This name, wasserkies (pyrites aquosus, as Cronstedt translates it), is Uttle applicable; yet may have arisen from the greater tendency of the mineral to become moist and alter to vitriol than pyrite \u2014 if it be not an early corruption, as Agricola seems to think (see above), of Weisserkm (white iron pyrites). It appears to have been used also for easUy decomposable pyrite; and pyrrhotine was also included under its other name, pyrites fuscus. The rhombic crystallization is mentioned by de Lisle ; but Hauy long afterward considered it only an irregularity of common iron pyrites. Marcasite is made by Breithaupt (J. pr. Ch, iv. 257, 1835) a generic name for the various species of pyrites. Lonchtdite Breil & Plattn., Pogg, lxxviL 135 (Kausimkies, Br. Char, 254, 1832). This mineral appears to be a mixture of marcasite and mispickel. Breithaupt gives for it the angles 104\u00b0 20' for I A I, and 100\u00b0 36' for the brachydome. H.=65. G.=4*925 \u2014 5.

The formula for the latter may be written R Te + R S2. Pyr., etc. \u2014 In the open tube gives, near the assay, a grayish subUmate of antimonate and teUurate, with perhaps some sulphate of lead ; farther up the tube the subUmate consists of anti monous acid, which volatUizes when treated with the flame, and teUurous acid, which at a high temperature fuses into colorless drops. B.B. on charcoal forms two coatings : one white and volatUe, consisting of a mixture of antimonite, tellurite, and sulphate of lead; and the other yellow, less volatile, of oxyd of lead quite near the assay. If the mineral is treated for some time in O.F. a maUeable globule of gold remains ; this cupelled with a little assay lead assumes a pure gold color. Decomposed by nitro-muriatic acid. Obs. \u2014 At Nagyag and Offenbanya in Transylvania, in foliated masses and crystalline plates, accompanying, at the former place, rhodonite, blende, aud gold ; and at the latter, associated with antimonial ores. Folbert states that the Nagyag crystals examined by him were hexagonal and not osthe tetragonal system, and had G.=6-680, or not exceeding this. Berthier has analyzed another ore very similar to the above in physical characters, consisting of TeUurium 13-0, sulphur 1T7, lead 631, gold 6'7, antimony 4-5, copper 1-0 = 100; corresponding to 2 IS, 6Te, 4Sb, ISPb, 2Au, but probably impure with sulphuret of antimony. It is called Blatterine by Huot, Min, i. 189, 1841. (A) Silberphyllinglanz Breith. (Schw. J, i. 178, 1828), occurring in gneiss at Deutsch-PUsen, Hungary, appears to be related to nagyagite.

According to Plattner (Probirkunst, 3d edit, 421) the constituents are antimony, lead, tel lurium, gold, sUver, and sulphur \u2014 4-9 p. c. of gold, 0-3 of silver \u2014 the sulphur probably in com bination with the antimony and lead. Only a trace of selenium was found, contrary to the earher determinations of Harkort and Breithaupt. IOO. COVELLITE. Freiesleben, Geogn. Arb, iii. 129 (fr.

Named after CovelU, the discoverer of the Vesuvian coveUite, by Beudant, and without refer ence to the ore as previously described. CoveUite is a result of the alteration of other ores of copper, and is often mixed with chalcocite or copper-glance, from which it has been derived. (See Digenite and Carmenite, p. 53.) (A) Cantoutte is coveUite from the Canton mine, Georgia, occurring in cubes, with a cubical cleavage. It is associated with harrisite (pseudomorphs of chalcocite after galenite, see p. 53), and is regarded by Genth as a pseudomorph of coveUite after the harrisite. Genth obtained in his analysis (1. c, xxiii. 417), S 32*76, Se trace, Ag 0'36, Cu 65-60, Pb 0-11, Fe 0-25, insoluble 0-16 = 99-24. (B) Alisontte Field. \u2014 AUsonite is an indigo-copper, containing a much larger proportion of lead than the cantonite ; but it is probably, like that, a result of the alteration of galenite.

Obs. \u2014 From the vaUey of Binnen in the St. Gothard Alps, in crystaUine dolomite, along with sartorite, jordanite, binnite, realgar, orpiment, blende, pyrite. The crystals are sometimes an inch across. Damour, who first studied the arsenio-sulphids of Binnen, analyzed the massive ore and named it dufrenoysite. He inferred that the crystaUization was monometric from some associated crystals, and so published it. This led von Waltershausen and Heusser to caU the monometric mineral dufrenoysite. and the latter to name the trimetric binnite Von Waltershausen, after studying the prismatic mineral, made out of the species arsenomelan and scleroclase, yet partly on hypothetical grounds. Recently it has been found that three orthorhombic minerals exist at the locahty, aa an nounced by vom Rath, who identifies one, by specific gravity and composition, with Damour's dufrenoysite ; another he makes scleroclase of von Waltershausen (sartorite, p. 87) ; and the other he names jordanite (p. 88)."], [149, "SULPHAKSENITES, ETC. 93 114.

Cobalt occurs in the ore of Schwarzwald, Moschellandsberg, Schottenhofen near Zell, Clara near Schapbach, and others. Pyr, etc. \u2014 Differ in the different varieties. In the closed tube all fuse and give a dark -red sublimate of sulpliid of antimony ; when containing mercury, a faint dark-gray sublimate appears at a low red heat ; and if much arsenic, a sublimate of sulphid of arsenic first forms. In the open tube fuses, gives sulphurous fumes and a white subUmate of antimony ; if arsenic is present, a crystalline volatile subUmate condenses with the antimony ; if the ore contains mercury it con denses in the tube in minute metaUic globules. B.B. on charcoal fuses, gives a coating of anti monous acid and sometimes arsenous acid, oxyd of zinc, and oxyd of lead ; the arsenic may be detected by the odor when the coating is treated in R.F. ; the oxyd of zinc assumes a greeu color when heated with cobalt solution. The roasted mineral gives with the fluxes reactions for iron and copper ; with soda yields a globule of metaUic copper. To determine the presence of a trace of arsenic by the odor, it is best to fuse the mineral on charcoal with soda. The presence of mer cury is best ascertained by fusing the pulverized ore in a closed tube with about three times its weight of dry soda, the metal subUming and condensing in minute globules. The sUver is de termined by cupeUation. Decomposed by nitric acid, with separation of sulphur and antimonous and arsenous acids. Obs. \u2014 The Cornish mines, near St. Aust, have afforded large tetrahedral crystals, with rough and duU surfaces. More brilUant crystaUizations occur at the Levant mine near St. Just, at Condur row mine and other places in Cornwall ; at Andreasberg and Clausthal in tho Harz ; Kremnitz in Hungary; Freiberg in Saxony Przibram in Bohemia ; Kahl in Spessart; Kapnik in Transyl vania; DUlenburg in Nassau; and other localities mentioned above. The ore containing mercury occurs in Schmolnitz, Hungary ; at Poratsch, Zavatka, and Kotter bach near Iglo; at Schwatz in the Tyrol; and in the valleys of Angina and CasteUo in Tuscany. Tetrahedrite is found in America ; in Mexico, at Durango, etc. ; at various mines in ChiU ; in Bolivia; at the Kellogg mines, 10 m. N. of Little Rook, Arkansas, with galenite. In California in Mariposa Co, in the Pine Tree gold vein and others ; in Shasta Co, Chicago claim. Iu Nevada, abundant at the Sheba and De Soto mines, Humboldt Co, massive and rich in sUver (the De Soto containing 1 6*4 p. c. of sUver, Allen) ; near Austin in Lander Co. ; in Arizona at the Hemtzelman mine, containing 11 p. c. of sUver ; at the Santa Rita miue. Alt.\u2014 Chalcopyrite, malachite, azurite, amalgam, bournonite, erythrite, cinnabar, coveUite, occur as pseudomorphs after tetrahedrite. Also a red pulverulent mineral, consisting of an acid of antimony, oxyd of copper or oxyd of mercury, etc. (See Ammiolite.) Annivite of Brauns (Mitth. nat. Ges. Bern, 1854, Kenngott's Ueb, 1855), from the Annivei"], [160, "104 SULPHAESENITES, ETC. valley in the Valais, is probably, according to Kenngott, only tetrahedrite.

It is soft, of greasy appearance, greenish-gray, slightly reddish, with powder bright-red. Domeyko considers it impure with blende, pyrite, and galenite. Ettling observes (ib, vi. 140) that the con stitution is analogous rather to enargite than tetrahedrite, corresponding to the formula 4 (6n, Zn, Fe, Ag) S + (Sb, As3) S5.

Stieren found (Jahresb, 1862, 766) NaCl 90-55, gypsum 0 45, clay and carb. lime 9-00=100. The bluish and indigo-colored salt of Stassfurt, etc, possibly owes its color, according to Prof. S. W. Johnson, to the presence of subchlorid of sodium. Pyr, etc In the closed tube fuses, often with decrepitation ; when fused on the platinum loop colors the flame deep yellow. Other reactions like those given under sylvite. Obs. \u2014 Common salt occurs in extensive but irregular beds in rocks of various ages, associ ated with gypsum, polyhaUte, clay, sandstone, and calcite; also dissolved, and forming salt springs. In Europe and England it occurs in the Triassic, associated with red marl or sandstone, but it is not confined to these rocks. At Durham, Northumberland, and Leicestershire, England, salt springs rise from the Carboniferous series; in the Alps, some salt works are supphed from Oolitic rocks; the famous mines of Cardona and Wieliczka are referred, the former to the Green Sand formation,"], [169, "113 CHLOEIDS. and the latter to Tertiary rocks. Salt springs also occur in volcanic regions. In the United States the brines of New York come from Upper Silurian strata ; those of Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Vir ginia, mostly from Devonian and Subcarboniferous beds ; those of Michigan, mainly from tho Subcarboniferous and Carboniferous ; whUe in Louisiana, at Petit Anse, there is a thick bed of pure salt in the Post-tertiary or more recent deposits of the coast ; recent explorations there have proved that it underlies 144 acres, and it has been penetrated to a depth of 38 feet without showing any change in its structure or purity. Salt also occurs as efflorescences over the dry prairies and shallow ponds or lakes of the Rocky Mountains, California, Atacama; and in most desert or semi-desert regions there are numerous salt lakes. The principal mines of Europe are at Wieliczka, iu Poland ; at HaU, in the Tyrol ; Stassfurt, in Prussian Saxony; and along the range through Reichenthal in Bavaria, HaUein in Salzburg, HaUstadt, Ischl, and Ebensee, in Upper Austria, and Aussee in Styria; in Hungary, at Marmoros and elsewhere ; in Transylvania ; WaUachia, GaUieia, and Upper Silesia ; Vie and Dieuze in France ; VaUey of Cardona and elsewhere in Spain, forming hUls 300 to 400 feet high ; Bex in Switzerland ; aud Northwich in Cheshire, England. At Cheshire it occurs in a basin-shaped deposit, and is arranged in spheroidal masses, from 5 to 8 feet in diameter, which are composed of concentric coats, and present polygonal figures. It is but httle contaminated with impurities, and is prepared for use by merely crushing it between iron rollers. At the Austrian mines, where it contains much clay, the salt is dissolved in large chambers, and the clay thus precipitated. After a time the water, fuUy saturated with the salt, is conveyed by aqueducts to evaporating houses, and the chambers, after being cleared out, are again fiUed ; at BercUtesgaden, the water is saturated iu a month, at Hall it takes nearly a year. It also occurs, forming hUls and covering extended plains, near Lake Oroomiah, the Caspian Lake, etc. In Algeria ; in Abyssinia; in India in the province of Lahore, and in the valley of Cashmere; in China and Asiatic Russia; in South America, in Peru, and at Zipaquera and Nemocon, the former a large mine long explored in the CordiUeras of Granada. OccasionaUy formed at the eruptions of Vesuvius, as in 1855, when it was found in cubes, incrustations, and stalactites. In the United States, salt has been found forming beds with gypsum, in Virginia, Washington Co, 18 m. from Abingdon; in the Salmon River Mts. of Oregon; in Louisiana as already men tioned. Brine springs are very numerous in the Middle and Western States. These springs are worked at Salina and Syracuse, N. Y. ; in the Kanawha Valley, Va. ; Muskingum, Ohio ; Michi gan, at Saginaw and elsewhere ; and in Kentucky. The salt water is obtained by boring, and raised by means of machinery, and thence conveyed by troughs to the boilers, where it is evapo rated by artificial heat; or to basins for evaporation by exposure to the heat osthe sun. The foUowing table by Prof. Beck (Mineralogy of New York, p. 112), gives the amount of brine required for a bushel of salt at the principal salt springs in the United States : GaUs. GaUs.

Vast lakes of salt water exist in many parts of the world. Lake Timpanogos in the Rocky mountains, 4,200 feet above the level osthe sea, now caUed the Great Salt Lake, is 2,000 square miles in area. L. Gale found in this water 20-) 96 per cent, of chlorid of sodium (Stansb. Exped. cited in Am. J. Sci., II. xvii. 129). The Dead and Caspian Seas are salt, and the waters osthe former contain 20 to 26 parts of solid matter in 100 parts. Prof. Gmelin, who analyzed a portion of these waters of specific gravity P21 2, found them to contain chlorid of calcium 3'336, chlorid of magnesium 12-167, chlorid of sodium 7-039, sulphate of lime 0052, bromid of magnesium 0-443, chlorid of potassium 1-086, chlorid of aluminum 0-144, chlorid of ammonium 0'007, chlorid of manganese 0-161=24-435, with 75-565 water= 100*000. This result is given as corrected hy Marchand. Alt. \u2014 Anhydrite, gypsum, polyhaUte, occur as pseudomorphs after this species ; also eelestine, dolomite, quartz, hematite, pyrite ; the removal of the salt cubes by their solution, leaves a cavity which any mineral may then occupy. The hopper-shaped crystals often leave au impression of their form on clays. 139. SAL AMMONIAC. Naturliches Salmiak (fr. Bucharia) J. G. Model, Versuch iiber ein nat. Salmiak, Leipzig, 1758.

Obs. \u2014 Occurs about volcanoes, as at Etna, the island of Vulcano, Vesuvius, Stromboli, Sand wich Islands, and near Hecla after the eruption of 1845, as observed by Bunsen. Observed after the eruption of Vesuvius in 1855, in rhombic dodecahedrons with cavernous faces ; and as usual it occurred where the lavas had spread over sod and vegetation. Also found in small quantities in the vicinity of ignited coal seams, as at St. Etienne in France, and also at Newcastle, and in Scotland ; crystaUized near DuttweUer in Prussia, where a coal seam has beeu burning for more than a hundred years. It occurs also in Bucharia; at KUauea in Hawaii, a variety which con tains largely of iron (see above), and becomes rusty yellow on exposure ; in guano from the Chin cha Islands. The a\\r a/ifit-xiat-s, sal-ammoniac of Dioscorides, Celsius, and Pliny, is proved by Beckmann (Hist. of Inventions, iv. 360) to be common rock salt, dug in Egypt, near the oracle of Ammon. The name was afterward transferred to the muriate of ammonia, when subsequently manufactured in Egypt. Sal-ammoniac is supposed to have been included by the ancients, with one or two other species, under the name of nitrum, which, according to Pliny, gave the test of ammonia when mingled with quickhme. 140.

Insoluble in nitric acid, but soluble in ammonia. Obs. \u2014 Occurs in veins of clay slate, accompanying other ores of sUver, and usually only in the higher parts of these veins. It has also been observed with ochreous varieties of brown iron ore ; also with several copper ores, calcite, barite, etc. The largest masses, and particularly those of a green color, are brought from Peru, Chili, and Mexico, where it occurs with native sUver. In ChUi, at some mines, it is a much less common ore than the chlorobromid ; often contains, intimately mixed with it, native silver in very minute grains ; it occurs at Tres Puntos, Atacama, ChaiiarcUlo near Copiapo, and elsewhere in ChUi. Also in Nicaragua near Ocotal ; in Dept. of Graoias, Honduras. It was formerly obtained in the Saxon mining districts of Johanngeorgenstadt and Freiberg, but is now rare ; a mass weighing six and three-quarter pounds, from this region, is in the Z winger coUection at Dresden. It also occurs in the Altai, at the mines of Smeinogorsk and Krukovskoi ; at Konigsberg in Norway ; in Alsace ; rarely in CornwaU, and at Huelgoet in Brittany. In Nevada, about Austip, Lander Co, abun dant ; at mines of Comstock lode. In Arizona, in the Willow Springs dist, veins of El Dorado canon, and San Francisco dist. In Idaho, at the Poorman mine, in crystals some half an inch across, mostly cubes and cubo-octahedrons, but occasionaUy with other planes, and in twins con sisting of two interpenetrating cubes, the angles of one projecting from the faces osthe other. At Andreasberg in the Harz, an earthy variety is met with, called by the Germans Buttermilk ore (Buttermilcherz, Thonige Hornsilber), which, according to Klaproth (Beitr, i. 137), contains silver 24'64, chlorine 8-28, alumina 67-08.

On charcoal fuses easUy to a clear bead, which on cooling becomes opaque ; after long blowing, the assay spreads out, the fluorid of sodium is absorbed by the coal, a suffocating odor of fluorine is given off, and a crust of alumina remains, which, when heated with cobalt solution in O.F, gives a blue color. Soluble in sulphuric acid, with evolution of hydrofluoric acid. Obs. \u2014 Occurs in a bay in Arksut-fiord, in West Greenland, at Evigtok, about 12 m. from the Danish settlement of Arksut, where it constitutes a large bed or vein in gneiss, and contains galenite, sphalerite, siderite, pyrite, arsenopyrite, fluorite, columbite, cassiterite, all often in fine crystals. The exposure of the cryolite is about 300 feet in length. It is shipped in large quantities to Europe, and to the United States (Pennsylvania), where it is used for making soda, and soda and alumina salts ; also of late, in Pennsylvania, for the manufacture of a white glass which is a very good imitation of porcelain. It has also been used for the manufacture of aluminum. The first specimens of cryolite came through Denmark from Greenland, and the earliest notice of it was by S-humacher in the Abh. Nat. Ges. Copenhagen, iv. 1795. The locality was described from personal observation by Gieseck. in Ed. Eucyc, x. 97, aud Ed. PhiL J, vi. 141, 1822 ; and re cently by J. W. Taylor in the Q. J. G. Soc, xii. 140. Taylor states that the cryolite is not white, except within 10 to 15 feet from the surface, and that below this it becomes dark-colored, and even black. He attributes the bleaching above to the heat of two trap-dykes; but as the dykes are not iu contact with the cryolite, and the evidence is not clear that they ever overlaid it, this cause may be questioned. The contaiued ores and other minerals are most abundant near the junciion with the gneiss. Dr. Hagemann described the crystals (Am. J. Sei, II. xiii. 268) as orthorhombic. The author obtained the above figures from specimens kindly furnished by Dr. H. They occur implanted on the massive cryolite. The twin, by the absence of a reentering angle on plane O, appears to prove that the form is orthorhombic and not oblique. Yet Descloizeaux states that the optical characters, as observed by him, indicate a monoclinic form. Owing to the striations of the crys tals and their minuteness, the measurements of the author were not very satisfactory. O A l-l, in front, gave 126\u00b0 40' (5 measurements 126' 30'\u2014 126\u00b0 40', and three of them 126\u00b0 40'), .A l-l, back, 125\u00b0 10' \u2014 125\u00b0 37', OAl-i about 126\u00b0, 1--A2-2 about 159\u00b0 40, O Al about 115\u00b0 30', 1-i, front, A 1-i, back,=71\u00b0 25'.

Obs \u2014 Found with pachnolite on the cryolite of Greenland, and a result of the alteration of cry olite. The crystals often have an ochre-colored coating, especially the terminal portion ; and on this account, and the striated tapering sides, the measurements ar'- only approximations. The mineral 9"], [186, "130 FLUORINE COMPOUNDS. was first noticed by Dr. Julius Thomsen of Copenhagen, the originator of the cryolite industry, after whom it is here named. It differs strikingly from pachnolite in its pearly basal cleavage and its nearly square prisms ; and from cryolite in the horizontal stri\u00e6 of the same and the facility of cleavage. The compact variety, first observed by Dr. Hagemann (to whom the author is indebted for his acquaintance with it), has much of the aspect of chalcedony ; it incrusts cryolite or occu pies seams or cavities in it, and is covered by the chalky gearksutite ; the incrustations are some times half an inch or more thick. 169A HagemA-TNIte. Hagemannite Shepard, Am. J. Sci., II. xiii. 246, 186 .. Closely resem bles in aspect and condition the compact thomsenolite, but passes sometimes into a yellow, opaque, jaspery variety. It incrusts the cryolite, and also constitutes seams J to i in. thick. It sometimes traverses a drusy ferruginous pachnolite.

Decrepitates surprisingly in the flame of a candle. The analysis corresponds to the atomic ratio for F, Si, (Al, Fe), (Mg, Ca, Na), 4:1:1:2. Tak ing 2 F for the Si, to make Si F3, it leaves only 2 F for the bases. No probable formula can be deduced. Excluding the Si, Mg, Fe, the composition is that of thomsenolite. 170. GEARKSUTITE.

Admitting the principle stated on page 33, that in oxyds crystallizing in the hexagonal system the number of atoms of the negative element, oxygen, is 3, or a multiple of 3 ; and that in those crystallizing in the tetragonal system this number is 2 or 4, or a multiple of 4 ; and that the sesquioxyds Fe3 O3, AP O3 are hexagonal species in accordance with this principle, and the deutoxyds Ti O3 Sn O3 are tetragonal in exemplification of it,* we have reasons for the following conclusions. In the Zincite group, since water (ice) and zincite are hexagonal, these species, when thus crystallized (whatever be true in other states), may have the formulas H3 0s, and Zu3 0 3. In the Massicot group, since the two species mentioned occur both in isometric and orthorhombic forms ; and since the orthorhombic form is in angle * The principle does not require that when the number of atoms of oxygen is 2 or 4, or a multiple of 4, that the forms should be necessarily tetragonal, but recognizes that tetragonal forms are then possible. The oxyd Ti O3 crystallizes not only in tetragonal forms, but also in orthorhombic."], [189, "ANHYDROUS OXYDS. 133 closely like that of orthorhombic Ti O3 (brookite), the angles I A I and I A i being 99' 39', 126\u00b0 29' in cuprite, and 99\" 50, 126\u00b0 15' in brookite, it would seem to be true that while the isometric kinds have the formulas Pb 0 and Cu 0, as ordinarily written, the orthorhombic have the formulas Pb3 O3 and Cu3 03 (or 6u O3) ; and that the latter ought to be arranged with the deutoxyds, in the same group with brookite, which also has 2 of oxygen. (This arrangement would have been adopted above, if distinct orthorhombic forms of the species had been observed in nature.) Again, under the Rutile group are arranged the species hausmannite and braunite, ores of man ganese. The formula of hausmannite is commonly written Mn S_u, making it analogous to species of the Spinel group. But it accords better with its tetragonal crystallization and its rela tions to Ti O3, to write it Mn' Mn. Braunite has been shown by Rammelsberg to have a compo sition that may be represented by the formula (Mn Si)3 O3, in which Mn and Si appear as replacing one another. The constituents, as deduced by analysts, are 3 S_n + Mn + Si, which include 8 of Mn and Si to 1 2 of oxygen, in accordance with the above formula. But braunite has closely the crystallization of Ti 03 in rutile ; and this relation is brought out in the formula 2 Mn3 Mn + Mn Si, above given, which represents it as corresponding to 2 of hausmannite and 2 of a silicate analo gous to zircon, with which silicate also it is isomorphous. The close relation and isomorphism of Mn and Si assumed in the formula (Mn, Si)3 O3 is unaustaiued by facts. 1. PEOTOXTDS. 172. CUPRITE. Aes caldarium rubro-fuscum, Germ.

Abundant thus at the Ducktown mines in Tennessee, and also formerly at Copper Harbor, Keweenaw Point, L. Superior. At the latter place a vein afforded, some years since, 40,000 lbs. of this ore.

These crystals have been regarded as pseudomorphs after cuprite by Teschemacher, Hayes, and others. J. D. Whitney has pronounced them (Rep. L.

Shepard made it (1. c.) a mixed hydrous chlorid and oxyd of copper, as if containing atacamite. Specimens put by him into the hands of S. W. Tyler for analysis were found to contain (Am. J. Sci., II. xii. Ill) 63-42 p. c. of copper and 17-22 of sulphur, with a \" supposed \" amount of oxygen and water set down at 8 of oxygen and 9 of water, whence it is supposed to consist of oxyd of copper (Cu O) 39-70, sulphid of copper (Cu S) 47-70, with 9 of water.

Friction excites electricity, and in polished specimens the electrical attraction continues for a considerable length of time. Obs. \u2014This species is associated with crystalline rocks, as granular hmestone or dolonute, gneiss, granite, mica slate, chlorite slate. The fine sapphires are usually obtained from the beds of rivers, either in modified hexagonal prisms or in rolled masses, accompanied by grains of mag netic iron ore, and several species of gems. The emery of Asia Minor, according to Dr. Smith, occurs in granular limestone. The best ruby sapphires occur in the Capelan mountains, near Syrian, a city of Pegu, and m the kingdom of Ava ; smaller individuals occur near Bilin and Merowitz in Bohemia, and in the sand osthe Expailly river in Auvergne. Blue sapphires are brought from Ceylon; this variety was called Salamstein by Werner. Corundum occurs in the Carnatic on the Malabar coast, m the territories of Ava, and elsewhere in the East Indies ; also near Canton, China. At St. Gothard, it occurs of a red or blue tinge in dolomite, and near Mozzo in Piedmont, in white compact feld spar. Adamantine spar is met with in large coarse hexagonal pyramids on the Malabar coast, and in Gellivara, Sweden. Emery is found in large boulders at Naxos, Nicaria, and Samos of the Grecian islands; also in Asia Minor, 12 m. E. of Ephesus, near Gumuch-dagh, where it was discovered in situ by Dr. J. Lawrence Smith, associated with margarite, chloritoid, pyrite, calcite, etc,; and also at Kulah, Adula, and Manser, the last 24 m. N. of Smyrna ; also with the nacrite (?) ot Cum berland. England.

Maine, ground and sold under this name, is nothing but massive garnet, much of it mixed with hornblende. Red sapphire is the most highly esteemed. A crystal weighing four carats, perfect in trans parency and color, has been valued at half the price of a diamond of the same size. They seldom exceed half an inch in length. Two splendid red crystals, however, having the form of the pyramidal dodecahedron, and \" de la longueur du petit doigt,\" with a diameter of about an inch, are said to be in the possession of the king of Arracan. Transparent blue sapphires are some times over three inches long. The sapphire of the Greek (-_m/-<po;) was the lapis lazuli, which agrees with the character given it by Theophrastus, Pliny, Isidorus, and others. Pliny remarks, \"Sapphirus c\u0153ruleus est cum purpura, habens pulveres aureos sparsos,\" particles of pyrite which are frequently dis seminated through lapis lazuli, looking like gold. The ancient names appUed to the species have already been given in the synonymy. See further on this subject, King on Precious Stones. C. U. Shepard, alter showing (Descr. of Em. of Chester, Mass., London, 1865) that the Chester emery is identical crystaUographicaUy with corundum, takes the precaution to propose the name emerite for emery, in case it should hereafter be estabhshed as a distinct species. But a name thus given has uo claim to recognition. Alt \u2014 Corundum under some circumstances absorbs water and changes to diaspore; and perhaps also to the mica-like mineral margarite. It is also replaced by silica, forming qmrti pseudomorphs. Artif. \u2014 Formed in crystals by exposing to a high heat 4 pts. of borax and 1 of alumina (Ebel men); by decomposing potash alum by charcoal (Gaudin) ; by subjecting in a carbon vessel fluorid of aluminum to the action of boric acid, the process yielding large rhombohedral plates (DeviUe & Caron) ; by addition to the last of fluorid of chromium, affording the red sapphire or ruby, or with less of the fluorid of chromium, blue sapphire, or with much of this chrome fluorid, a fine green kind ; by action of chlorid of aluminum on lime (Daubree). 180.

(c) When oolitic in structure (consisting of minute flattened concretions), it is the lenticular iron ore. Itabiryie is a schist resembhug mica-schist, but containing much specular ore in grains or scales, or in the micaceous form. Breithaupt states that some rhombohedrons of hematite have a magnetic axis crossmg obliquely the vertical axis, passing between two opposite lateral angles (B. H. Ztg., xxv. 149) ; and further, that the three cleavages of the rhombohedron are not quite equal.

With soda on charcoal in R.F. is reduced to a graj magnetic metallic powder. Soluble in concentrated muriatic acid. Obs. \u2014 This ore occurs in rocks of aU ages, The specular variety is mostly confined to crystal. Une or metamorphic rocks, but is also a result of igneous action about some volcanoes, as at Vesu vius. Many of the geological formations contain the argiUaceous variety or clay iron-stone, which is mostly a marsh-formation, or a deposit over the bottom of shallow, stagnant water ; but this kind of clay iron-stone (that giving a red powder) is less common than the corresponding variety of limonite or siderite. The beds that occur in metamorphic rocks are sometimes of very g.eat thickness, and, like those of magnetite in the same situation, have resulted from the alteration of stratified beds of ore, originaUy of marsh origin, which were formed at the same time with the enclos ing rocks, and underwent metamorphism, or a change to the crystalhne condition, at the same time, Beautiful crystalhzations of this species are brought from the island of Elba, which has afforded it from a very remote period, and is described by Ovid as \" Insula inexhaustis ehalybdum generosa metallis.\" The surfaces of the crystals often present an irised tarnish and briUiant lustre ; the faces 0 and J are usually destitute of this tarnish and lustre, aud may therefore assist, when present, in determining the situation of other planes when the crystal is quite complex St. Gothard affords beautiful specimens, composed of crystaUized plates grouped in the form of rosettes (Eisenrose), and accompanying crystals of feldspar. Near Limoges, France, it occurs in large crystals. Fine crystals are the result of volcanic action at Etna and Vesuvius, and particularly in Fossa Cancharone, on Monte Somma, where it incrusts the ejected lavas ; also formed in most recent eruptions about the fumeroles ; in that of 1855, in fine crystaUiza tions about the fumaroles some so thin as to be blood-red by transmitted light (Scacchi). Arendal in Norway, Longban in Sweden, Framont in Lorraine, Dauphiny, and Switzerland, also Cleator Moor in Cumberland, afford splendid specimens. Red hematite occurs in reniforra masses of a fibrous concentric structure, near TJlverstone in Lancashire, in Saxony, Bohemia, and the Harz. In Westphalia it occurs as pseudomorphs of calcite. In BrazU it is associated with quartz. In Chili there are immense beds. In N. America, widely distributed, and sometimes in beds of vast thickness in rocks of the Azoic age, as in the Marquette region in northern Michigan ; and in Missouri, at the Pilot Knob and the Iron Mtn. ; the former 650 feet high, consisting mainly of an Azoic quartz rock, and hav ing specular iron in the upper part, the iron ore in heavy beds interlaminated with quartz; the latter 200 feet high, and consisting at surface of massive hematite in loose blocks, many 10 to 20 tons in weight ; in Arizona and New Mexico. Besides these regions of enormous beds, there are numerous others of workable value, either crystaUized or argUlaceous. Some of these localities, interesting for their specimens, are in northern New York, at Gouverneur, Antwerp, Hermon, Edwards, Fowler, Canton, eta ; Woodstock and Aroostook, Me. ; at Hawley, Mass., a micaceous variety ; at Piermont, N. H., id. ; in New York, in Oneida, Herkimer, Madison, Wayne Cos., a lenticular argiUaceous var., constituting one or two beds in the Upper SUurian ; the same in Pennsylvania, and as far south as Alabama ; and in Canada, and Wisconsin to the west ; in North and South Carolina a micaceous variety in schistose rocks, constituting the so-called specular schist, or itabirite. This ore affords a considerable portion of the iron manufactured in different countries. The varieties, especiaUy the specular, require a greater degree of heat to smelt than other ores, but the iron obtained is of good quality. Pulverized red hematite is employed in polishing metals, and also as a coloring material. This species is readUy distinguished from magnetite by its red streak, and from turgite by its greater hardness and its not decrepitating before the blowpipe. Named hematite from ai/m, blood, it seeming, says Theophrastus, as if formed of concreted blood. This old Greek author speaks afterwards of a second kind of hematites ('A\"/i_ri. \u00ab fu. .), which was of a yellowish-white color, probably a yeUow ochre, an impure form of limonite, the species long caUed brown hematite. Alt. \u2014 By deoxydation through organic matter forms magnetite or protoxyds ; and from the latter comes spathic iron by combination with carbonic acid ; or by further deoxydation through sul- phuretted hydrogen forms pyrite. By combination with water forms Umonite. Limonite, mag- netite, and pyrite constitute occurring pseudomorphs after hematite. Artif. \u2014 Formed in crystals by the action of steam on chlorid of iron, regarded as the probable method of origin of the hematite of lavas ; also by the action of perchlorid of iron on lime (Daubree) ; by the action of a stream of muriatic acid gas on Pe, the application being made very slowly, lest the Pe be all converted to chlorid. 180A. Martite. (Martit Breith., Char., 233, 1832). Martite is sesquioxyd of iron under an isometric form, occurring in octahedrons like magnetite (f. 2), and supposed to be pseudomor phous, mostly after magnetite. H. = 6\u2014 7.

They are distinguished from magnetite by the red streak, and very feeble, if any, action on the magnetic needle. Found at the localities mentioned ; also in Vermont at Chittenden ; in the Marquette iron region south of L. Superior, where crystals are common in the ore, as if all of it, or the greater part, were martite ; Bass lake, Canada West ; at Monroe, N. Y., in a rock containing quartz, feldspar, and hornblende, and imbedded in each of these minerals ; in Moravia, near Schonberg, in granite. The martite of Monroe contains some Fe, Brush. The octahedral crystals from Chittenden, Vt., according to D. Olmstead, are part true magnetite, with a black powder; part give a slightly red dish streak, with little Fe ; and part give a red powder and contain no Fe. Whether the crystals of martite are original crystals or pseudomorphs is stiU questioned ; but the latter seems to be the most probable view. Pseudomorphism after magnetite would imply that the Marquette ore bed was once all magnetite in composition, Fes O4, and has been changed to the sesquioxyd, Fe2 O3, by an addition of oxygen. Rammelsberg found 1 -83\u2014 2-.0 p. c. of prot oxyd of iron in the Brazil crystals. The octahedrons from the fumeroles of Vesuvius afforded Rammelsberg (Min. Ch., 159) Pe 9291, Fe 6-17, Mg 0-82=9990. The crystals from Frassem, France, contain 0-2 p. c. of sulphur, which suggests that these may be pseudomorphs after pyrite# 181. MENACCANITE.

Rose made the formula m-Pi + n Pe, assuming that the Fe obtained in the analyses arose from the oxydation of a supposed titanic oxyd (Ti2 O3) at the expense of the Pe. This view is not sustained, 'since it has been proved that the Fe exists as such in the ore. For other analyses : fr. Harzburg in Gabbro, Strong, B. H. Ztg., xxiii. 55 ; fr.

With borax and salt of phosphorus reacts for iron in O.F., and with the latter flux assumes a more or less in- tense brownish-red color in R.F. ; this treated with tin on charcoal changes to a violet-red color when the amount of titanium is not too small. The pulverized mineral, heated with muriatic acid, is slowly dissolved to a yellow solution, which, filtered from the undecomposed mineral and boiled with the addition of tin-foil, assumes a beautiful blue or violet color. Decomposed by fusion with bisulphate of soda or potash. Obs. \u2014 The principal European localities of this species have been enumerated above. One of the most remarkable is at Krageroe, Norway, where it occurs in veins or beds in diorite, which sometimes afford crystals weighing over 1 6 pounds. Fine crystals, sometimes an inch in diameter, occur in Warwick, Amity, and Monroe, Orange Co., N. Y. , imbedded in serpentine and white lime- stone, and associated with spinel, chondrodite, rutile, etc. ; also 4 m. west of Edenville, and near Greenwood furnace with spinel and chondrodite ; also at Chester and South Royalston, Mass. Vast deposits or beds of titanic ore occur at Bay St. Paul in Canada, in syenite ; one bed, 90 feet thick, continues on in view for 300 feet, and probably far beyond ; also in the Seignory of St. Francis, Beauce, mixed with magnetite as a bed 45 feet thick in serpentine ; G.=4*56\u2014 4*66 ; also with labradorite at Chateau Richer. Grains are found in the gold sand of California. 181A. Isebite. (Titaneisenstein pt., Magnetischer Eisen-Sand pt., Wern. Iserin (fr. Iser) Wern., Letztes Min., 26, 52, 1811, Hoffm.

The locality of Iserwiese gave the name to this mineral The titanic iron-sand is partly iD octahedral forms, and this portion, if not all, is tho iserine. Yet it is stiU doubted whether the otahedrons are regular octahedrons, or whether they are acute rhombohedrons with truncated apices, and therefore true ilmenite. The Iserwiese crystals, as analyzed by Rammelsberg (aual 1), give for the ratio between the metals and oxygen 2 : 2-33, which is much more oxygen than the formula R2 O3 requires, and is stUl further remote from that of magnetite. The ore from Sio- Fok, on the Platensee, as analyzed by v. Hauer (anal. 2), affords the general formula (Fe, Ti)2 0! + Fe203 equivalent to FeO TiO2 + Fe203 (or Fe ti + Pe). G.=4-817. The grains were in part octahedrons, and some with truncated angles. The sand on the Mersey comes from the shores nearly opposite Liverpool, and is mixed with magnetite. This is indicated in the analysis, which affords the formula 3 Fe 0, Ti O2 (or 3 (Fe, Ti)2 O3) + 5 Fe Pe (or 5 of magnetite). Minute octahedrons occur at BaUycrogan, MuU of Cantyre, Sand from Miiggelsee, near BerUn, having G.=5-075, afforded Rammelsberg a similar composi tion, but with only 5'20 p. c. ti, it giving him the formula Fe 0 Ti 02+ 6 of magnetite. It is not stated that this sand is octahedral. The ore from Silberberg, near Bodenmais, in Bavaria, corre sponds nearly to ii (Fe, Ti)2 03 + 8 Fe2 O3, and therefore comes under the general formula E! 0 . Waltershausen has obtained from octahedral crystals of an iron-sand from Etna (Yulk. Gest. 121), having G.=4-43, ti 12-38 and Pe 92-18=104-56. The analysis needs repetition, A. Knop obtained for a titanic iron-sand a composition corresponding to magnetite in atomic ratio, giving the ratio 1 : 1-25 between the metals and oxygen. See under Magnetite.

In Ceylon, in Siam, and other eastern countries, it occurs of beautiful colors, as roUed pebbles in the channels of rivers. Pleonaste is found at Candy, in Ceylon. At Aker, in Sweden, is found a pale-blue and pearl-gray variety in limestone. Small black splendent crystals occur in the ancient ejected masses of Mount Somma, with mica and idocrase ; also in compact gehlenite at Monzoni, in the Fassa valley. From Amity, N. Y., to Andover, N. J., a distance of about 30 miles, is a region of granular hme stone and serpentine, in which localities of spinel abound. At Amity crystals are occasionally 16 in. in diameter; and one coUected by Dr. Heron weighs 49 lbs. ; it is in three pieces, and contains cavities studded with crystals of corundum ; colors, green, black, brown, and less commonly red, along with . chondrodite and other minerals. A mUe S.W. of Amity, on J. Layton's farm, is a remarkable locaUty ; also on W. Raynor's farm, a mile N. ; another half mile N. affording grayish red octahedrons ; and others to the south. LocaUties are numerous about Warwick, and also at Monroe and Cornwall, though less favorable for exploration than those at Amity (form 1, also 1, i, 3-3, f. 147). Franklin, N. J., affords crystals of various shades of black, blue, green, and red, which are sometimes transparent, and a bluish-green ceylonite variety here, has the lustre of polished steel ; Newton, N. J., pearl-gray crystals, along with blue corundum, tourmaline, and rutile ; at Byram, red, brown, green, and black colors, along with chondrodite ; at Sterhng, Sparta, Hamburgh, and Vernon, N.

W. of SomerviUe, St. Lawrence Co. ; green, blue, and occasionaUy red varieties occur in granular limestone at Bolton, Boxborough, Chelmsford, and Littleton, Mass. Soft octahedral crystaLs occur in Warwick, which are pseudomorphs, consisting partly of steatite or serpentine.

From the normal proportion of Fe to Pe, 1 : 1, there is occasionaUy a wide variation, and thus a gradual passage to the sesquioxyd (Pe); and this fact may be regarded as evidence that the octahedral Pe, martite, is only au altered magnetite. Schwalbe has found (ZS. nat. Ver.

Pyr., etc. \u2014 B.B. very difficultly fusible. In O.F. loses its influence on the maguet. With the fluxes reacts hke hematite. Soluble in muriatic acid. Obs. \u2014 Magnetite is mostly confined to crystaUine rocks, and is most abundant in metamorphic rocks, though found also in grains in eruptive rocks. In the Azoic rocks the beds are of immense extent, aud occur under the same conditions as those of hematite (see p. 142). It is an ingredient in most of the massive variety of corundum called emery. The earthy magnetite is found in bogs like bog-iron ore. The beds of ore at Arendal, and nearly all the celebrated iron mines of Sweden, consist of massive magnetite; Dannemora and the Taberg in Smaoland are entirely formed of it. Still larger mountains of it exist at Kurunavara and Gelivara, in Lapland. Fahlun iu Sweden, and Corsica, afford octahedral crystals (f. 2), imbedded in chlorite slate. Splendid dodecahedral crystals occur at Normark in Wermland. The most powerful native magnets are found in Siberia, and in the Harz ; they are also obtained on the island of Elba. In N. America, it constitutes vast beds (some scores of feet thick) in the Azoic, in the Adiron dack region, Warren, Essex, and Clinton Cos., in Northern N. York, while in St. Lawrence Co. the iron ore is mainly hematite ; also simUarly in Canada, in HuU, Grenville, Madoc, etc, ; and at Corn wall in Pennsylvania, and at Magnet Cove, Arkansas. It occurs also in N. York, in Saratoga, Herkimer, Orange, and Putnam Cos.; at O'Neil mine, Orange Co., in crystals (f. 1, 2, 3, 5, 6).

No ore of iron is more generaUy diffused than the magnetic, and none superior for the manu facture of iron. It is easily distinguished by its being attracted readily by the magnet, and also by means of the black color of its streak or powder, which is some shade of red or brown in hematite and limonite. The ore when pulverized may be separated from earthy impurities by means of a magnet, and machines for this purpose are in use. Named from the loc. Magnesia, bordering on Macedonia. But Pliny favors Nicander's derivation from Magnes, who first discovered it, as the fable runs, by finding, on taking his herds to pasture, that the naUs of his shoes and the iron ferrule of his staff adhered to the ground. Alt. \u2014 By deoxydation through organic matter changed to protoxyd, which may become a car bonate or siderite. By oxydation becomes sesquioxyd of iron or hematite. Artif. \u2014 Formed in crystals by the action of chlorhydric acid on the sesquioxyd heated, producing a partial deoxydation (Deville); by decomposition of the sesquioxyd with boracic acid (DevUle and Caron, Ann. Ch. Phys., IV. v. 108). 185A. Dimagnetite of Shepard (Am. J. Sci., II. xiii. 392) appears to be a magnetite pseudomorph. The slender rhombic prisms occur upon a surface which is covered with smaU cubo-octahedrons, dodecahedrons, and cubo-dodecabedrons of magnetite, and some sroah irregular cavities in the dimagnetite crystals contain similar crystals ; moreover no difference of lustre is perceived in a fractured surface of the magnetite and dimagnetite. The species imitated in the pseudomorph is probably Lievrite. The angle of the prism varies between 110\u00b0 and 115\u00b0, according to the author's measurements (Shepard gives the angle 130\"). One crystal gave approximately HO3 and 70\" ; another 114\u00b0 20' and 65= 40' ; another 1 12\u00b0 and 68c, and the obtuse edge was bevelled in this last crystal by planes (i-i.) inclined to the larger ones at an angle of about 160i\u00b0. The faces are even but not very bright. From Monroe, Orange Co., N. Y."], [208, "152 OXYGEN COMPOUNDS. 187. MAGNESIOFERRITE. Magnoferrit Ramm., Pogg., era. 451, 1859. Magneferrit Kenng., Ueb.

Pyrolusite parts with its oxygen at a red heat, and is extensively employed for discharging the brown and green tints of glass. It hence received its name from tw, fire, and A\u00bb_>, to wash ; and for the same reason it is whimsically entitled by the French le savon de verriers. It is easUy distinguished from psUo melane by its inferior hardness, and usually by being crystalline. 200. CREDNERITE. Kupferhaltiges Manganerz Credner, Jahrb. Min., 5, 1 847.

A yellow pulverulent substance, encrusting masses of native copper, along with quartz, at the Cliff mine, Lake Superior, according to J. E. Teschemacher (1. a). The color before the blowpipe changed to black ; also the powder, boiled in nitric acid, afforded an apple-green solution, from which, on partial evaporation, after standing some weeks, red crystalline globules formed on the surface, which, as they enlarged, fell to the bottom ; by means of these crystalline masses the vanadates of silver and lead were made. As no metal was found in the first solution, the yellow mineral was inferred to be probably vanadic acid (V O3). B. HYDROUS OXYDS. 1. Oxygen ratio for fi, H=l : -$-. 202. Turgite Pe\" fl B.

Obs. \u2014 A very common ore of iron, often taken for limonite, with which it is frequently asso ciated, and which it resembles, except in its superior hardness, streak, and decrepitation. It also looks very much hke fibrous hematite. Hermann's mineral was from the Turginsk copper mine near Bosgolovsk, in the Ural, and from the Kolyvan district, in the Altai ; that of Breithaupt, from near Hof in Bavaria, and Siegen in Prussia; found also with limonite at Dusseldorf in Prussia ; at the Louisa mine, Horhausen. In the United States it occurs abundantly, and very large botryoidal massive, at the limonite ore bed of Salisbury, Ct., as detected by Prof. Brush (Am. J. Sci., II. xliv. 219), usually constituting the exterior layer of the hmonite, sometimes an inch or more thick. The Une of demarcation between it and the limonite is very distinct, and separation along it is often easy. Artif. \u2014 E. Davies has shown that the ordinary precipitate of hydrate of iron, on being boiled in water, may have its water reduced to 3*52 p. c. (J. Ch. Soc., II. iv. 69) ; and Rodman (1. c.) has, by the same method, reduced it to 2 p. c, showing that the water varies with the temperature of origin; and, as Davies observes, no great heat is needed to make thus anhydrous hematite. 203.

The ochre analyzed by Hunt was from a bed in the soU having an extent of many acres ; the color light brownish-yellow. It may be a mixture of limonite and a hydrous species containing oxyd of iron combined with organic acids. Hunt suggests that it should be made a distinct spe- cies ; and when the exact nature of the organic acids is determined, this may properly be done. In other analyses of bog ores from VaudreuU aud other places in Canada, Hunt found 16-50 to 23'65 p. c. of water and organic acids, but the proportion of the two was not determined. For other so-caUed limonite, bog ores, and ochres, see __a_tthos_deri_e and LiM-JiTE. Pyr., etc. \u2014 Like gothite. Some varieties give a skeleton of silica when fused with salt of phosphorus, and leave a sUiceous residue when attacked by acids. Obs Limonite occurs in secondary or more recent deposits, in beds associated at times with barite, siderite, calcite, aragonite, and quartz ; and often with ores of manganese ; also as a modern marsh deposit. It is in all cases a result of the alteration of other ores, through exposure to moisture, air, and carbonic or organic acids ; and is derived largely from the change of pyrite, siderite, magnetite, and various mineral species (such as mica, augite, hornblende, etc.), which contain iron in the protoxyd state. It consequently occupies, as a bog ore, marshy places, over most countries of the globe, into which it has been borne by streamlets from the hiUs around; and in the more compact form it occurs in stalactites as weU as in tuberose and other concretionary forms, frequently mak- ing beds in the rocks which contain the minerals that have been altered into it. In moist places where a sluggish streamlet flows into a marsh or pool, a rust-yeUow or brownish-yeUow deposit often covers the bottom, and an iridescent film the surface of the water : the deposit is a growing bed of bog ore. The iron is transported in solution as a protoxyd carbonate in carbonated waters, a sulphate, or as a salt of an organic acid. The Umonite beds of the Green Mountain region were shown by Percival (Rep. G. Conn., 132, Am. J. Sci., II. ii 268) to be altered beds of pyritiferous micaceous and argillaceous schist ; and the same is held by Lesley as true also of the other beds osthe Atlantic border, from New England and New York, through Pennsylvania (Mt. Alto region and others), to Tennessee and Alabama (Proc. Am. Ac. Philad., 463, 1864, Am J. Sci., II. xl. 119). Abundant in the United States. A few only of its localities are here mentioned ; reference may be made to the various geological reports for complete lists. Extensive beds exist at Sahsbury and Kent, Conn., also in the neighboring towns of Beekman, Fishkill, Dover, and Amenia, N. Y., and in a simUar situation north ; at Richmond and Lenox, Mass. ; at Hinsdale as the cement in a conglomerate quartz rock ; in Vermont, at Bennington, Monkton, Pittsford, Putney, and Riptou. Limonite is one of the most important ores of iron. The pig iron, from the purer varieties, ob- tained by smelting with charcoal, is of superior quality. That yielded by bog ore is what is termed coldshort, owing to the phosphorus present, and cannot therefore be employed in the man- ufacture of wire, or even of sheet iron, but is valuable for casting. The hard and compact nodular varieties are employed in polishing metallic buttons, etc. Named Limonite from \\sijia,; meadow. UUmann's name, Slilpnosiderite, from -r<X,n/.5, shining, has priority ; but the ore is characteristicaUy not a shining ore, although sometimes with a lus trous, varnish-Uke exterior. The name limonite was first appropriated especiaUy to the bog ores by Hausmann in 1813. But most bog ores are of the above species, and Beudant, recognizing this, in 1832 used limonite for the bog as weU as othor limonite. Alt.\u2014 By deoxydation through organic matter, if carbonic acid is present, may form siderite (Fe C). By losing water becomes hematite (Pe). Hematite occurs as pseudomorphs aster limonite.

But the true gibbsite has since been analyzed anew by SiUiman, Jr., and by Smith St Brush, without finding more than a trace of phosphoric acid, sustain ing the original analysis of Torrey. This at least is certain, that gibbsite is a hydrate, and if a phosphate occurs also at Richmond, that phosphate is not gibbsite.

There are large deposits of bog manganese at Blue HiU Bay, Dover, and other places in Maine. Earthy cobalt occurs with cobalt pyrites at Riechelsdorf in Hesse ; Saalfeld in Thuringia ; at Nertschinsk in Siberia ; at Alderly Edge in Cheshire. An earthy cobalt occurs at Mine la Motte, Missouri, which contains 10 or 11 p. c. of oxyd of nickel, besides oxyd of cobalt and copper, with iron, lead, and sulphur ; also near Silver Bluff, South Carolina, affording 24 p. c. of oxyd of cobalt to 76 of oxyd of manganese.

Polarization circular, there being a colored centre instead of a central cross, and the rings of color around enlarging as the analyzer is turned to the right in right-handed crys tals (f. 192),<or left in left-handed (f. 190) ; and colored spirals are seen, which rotate to the right or left, when the incident light and emergent light are polarized, one circularly and the other plane. For observing the polarization, plates of the crystal are cut at right angles to the axis. In twins the component parts may be both right-handed or both left-handed (as iu those of Dauphiny and the Swiss Alps) ; or one may be of one kind and the other of the other. Moreover, succes sive layers of deposition (made as the crystal went on enlarging, and often exceedingly thin) are sometimes alternately right and left-handed, showing a constant osciUation of polarity in the course of its formation ; and, when this is the case, and the layers are regular, cross-sections, examined by polarized light, exhibit a division, more or less perfect, into sectors of 120\u00b0, paraUel to the plane _?, or into sectors of 60\u00b0. If the layers are of unequal thickness, there are broad areas of colors without sectors. In f. 199 (by Descloizeaux, from a crystal from the Dept. of the Aude), half of each sector of 60\u00b0 is right-handed, and the other half left (as shown by the arrows), and the dark radii are neutral bands produced by the overlapping of layers of the two kinds. In f. 200, from a 199 crystal of amethyst (also by Descloizeaux), the alternate white and black lines in each banded sector are due to alternate right and left-handed layers, paraUel to _?. The fact of a structure iu layers js easUy made manifest by means of fluoric acid, it corroding successive layers unequaUy. The asteriated internal structure is often apparent in an asteriated arrangement of shades of color or of degrees of transparency. Biaxial polarization is sometimes a consequence of the composite structure (as in crystals from Euba, near Schemnitz). In crystals, the planes R and \u2014 1, when not distinguishable by different degrees of lustre, smoothness, or striation, nay be by etching with fluoric acid, this process going on unequaUy in the two directions and producing a difference of surface, besides often developing the layers that were superimposed in the growth of the crystal, alluded to above.

Quartz-silica has been supposed to be insoluble in a hot solution of potash, and to be thus distinguishable from opal-silica. But since the investigations of Rammels berg (Pogg., cxii. 177 ) it has been questioned whether in a very finely divided state, and espceiaUy such as constitutes the compact (cryptocrystalhne) chalcedony or flint, it is not more or less soluble.

Jenzsch has announced (Pogg., cxxvi. 497) that there is a second modification of amorphous sUica, distinct from opal, and hitherto unrecognized (see under Opal), having G.=2-6, like quartz. This suggests an explanation osthe above. But the hyaUte variety of opal, having G. = 2-185, gave Rammelsberg 9-6 to 19'9 p. c of insoluble silica.

Of indigo or Beriin-blue color; a variety occurring in an impure limestone at GoUing in Saltzburg. 9. Sagenitic. Containing within acicular crystals of other minerals. These acicular crystals are most commonly (a) rutile, the mineral called from such specimens sageniie (fr. -_y^i- ., a net) by de Saussure (see under Rutile). They may also be (fi) black tourmaline ; (c) gothite ; (d) stibnite ; (-)asbestus; (/) actinolite; (g) hornblende ; (A) epidote. 10. Cats Eye (Katzenauge Germ., CEil de Chat Fr.). Exhibiting opalescence, but without pris matic colors, especially when cut en caboehon, an effect due to fibres of asbestus. 1 1. Aventurine. Spangled with scales of mica or other mineral. 12. Impure from the presence of distinct minerals distributed densely through the mass. The more common kinds are those in which the impurities are : (a) ferruginous, either red or yeUow oxyd of iron; (6) chloritic, some kind of chlorite; (c) actinolitic; (ci) micaceous; (e) arenaceous, oi sand. 13"], [250, "194 OXYGEN COMPOUNDS. Quartz crystals also occur penetrated by various minerals, as topaz, corundum, chrysoberyl, garnet, different species of the hornblende and pyroxene groups, kyanite, zeolites, calcite and other carbonates, rutile, stibnite, hematite, gothite, magnetite, fluorite, gold, silver, anthracite, etc. As quartz has been crystaUized through the aid of hot waters or of steam in aU ages down to the present, and is the most common ingredient of rocks, there is good reason why it should be found thus the enveloper of other crystals. 13. Containing liquids in cavities. These liquids are seen to move with the change of position of the crystal, provided an air-bubble be present in the cavity; they may be detected also by the refraction of light. The liquid is either water (pure, or a mineral solution), or some petroleum-like or other compound. (See p. 761.) B. CR_PTOCRTSTALLr_TE VARIETIES. 1. Chalcedony (Murrhina Plin., xxxvU. 7. I_\u00ab_\u00ab pt. Theophr. Iaspis pt. Plin., xxxvii. 37 Murrhina, Germ. Chalcedonius, Agric., 466, 1546, Chalcedon, Achates vix pellucida, nebulosa, colore griseo mixta, Wall, 83, 1747. Calcedoine Fr.). Having the lustre nearly of wax, and either transparent or translucent. Color white, grayish, pale-brown to dark-brown, black; tendon-color common; sometimes dehcate blue. Also of other shades, and then having other names. Often mammiUary, botryoidal, stalactitic, and occurring lining or fining cavities in rocks. It is true quartz, with some disseminated opal-quartz. A gray chalcedony from Hungary afforded Redtenbacher (Ramm. Min. Ch., 1007) Si 98'87, _?e 0-53, Ca C 0-62 = 100-02. 2. Cornelian (\u00a3_<._!_>. Theophr. Sarda Plin., xxxvii. 23, id. = Germ. Carneol, Agric, 468, 1546. Carneol, Agates fere peUucida, colore rubescente, Wall, 82, 1747. Cornaline Fr.). A clear red chalcedony, pale to deep in shade; also brownish-red to brown, the latter kind (Sardoine Fr.) reddish-brown by transmitted light. Heintz found that the red color was due to oxyd of iron, obtaining in an analysis _?e 0'050 p. c, 51 0081, Mg 0-028, K 0-0043, Na 0-075. It has been supposed to be of organic origin. 3. Chrysoprase (not Chrysoprasus antiq.). An apple-green chalcedony, the color due to the presence of oxyd of nickel. Klaproth found in that of SUesia (Beitr., n. 127) Si 96-16, 51 0-08, \u00a5e 0-08, Ni 1-0, Ca 0-83, H 1-85 = 100; and Rammelsberg, in the same (Pogg., cxii. 188), Si 97-00, 3Pe, Ni 0-41, Ca, fig 0-51, H 2-08. 4. Prase. Translucent and duU leek-green; so named from npinov, a leek. Always regarded as a stone of little value. The name is also given to crystalline quartz 'of the same color. \"Vilioris est turb\u00e6 Prasius,\" says Pliny. 5. Plasma (Iaspis pt. Plin., xxxvii. 37). Rather bright-green to leek-green, and also sometimes nearly emerald-green, and subtranslucent or feebly translucent ; sometimes dotted with white. Heliotrope, or Bloodrstone, is the same stone essentiaUy, with small spots of red jasper, looking hke drops of blood. The Iaspis, or jasper of the ancients, was a semitransparent or translucent stone, and included in Pliny's time all bright-colored chalcedony excepting the carnelian (Sard). He gives special prominence to sky-blue and green, and mentions also a shade of purple (the color of the best, he says), a rose color, the color of the morning sky in autumn, sea-green, terebenthiiie color (yellow hke turpentine, as interpreted by King), smoke-color (his capnias), etc. ; but in general there is a tinge of blue, whatever the shade. Tbe green kinds may have been chrysoprase or plasma ; or perhaps a variety of jade, a stone known in Europe since the Stone age. The green, with a line running (through it (Monogrammos), may have been plasma, or jade, with a narrow seam of white quartz. Pliny's Prasius, spotted with red, was our heliotrope ; his Heliotrope (xxxvii. 60) was a leek green stone (prase or plasma) veined with blood-red (jasper); and the jasper was so abundant a part as to give a general red reflection to the whole when it was put in water in the face of the sun, whence the name from fjX.ot, sun, and rp.iru, to turn. 6. Agate ('A^driis [fr. SicUy] Theophr. Achates pt. Plin., xxxvii. 54. Onyx pt. Plin., ib., 24). A variegated chalcedony. The colors are either (_) banded ; or (/?) in clouds ; or (y) due to visible impurities. a. Banded. The bands are dehcate paraUel lines, of white, tendon-like, wax-like, pale and dark brown, and black colors, and sometimes bluish and other shades. They foUow waving or zigzag courses, and are occasionaUy concentric circular, as in the eye-agate (Leucophthalmus Plin., xxxvii 62, and Triophthalmus ib., 7 1). The fine translucent agates graduated into coarse aud opaque kinds. The bands are the edges of layers of deposition, the agate having been formed by a deposit of sUica from solutions intermittently suppUed, in irregular cavities in rocks, and deriving their con centric waving courses from the irregularities of the walls of the cavity. As the cavity cannot contain enough of the solution to fUl it with sUica, an open hole has been supposed to be retained on one side to permit the continued supply ; but it is more probable that it passes through the outer"], [251, "QUARTZ, 195 layers by osmosis, the denser solution outside thus supplying sUica as fast as it is deposited with in. The colors are due to traces of organic matter, or of oxyds of iron, manganese, or titanium, and largely to differences in rate of deposition. The layers differ in porosity, and therefore in the rate at which they are etched by fluoric acid ; and consequently the etching process brings out the different layers, and makes engravings that wiU print exact pictures of the agate. Owing also to the unequal porosity, agates may be varied in color by artificial means. A brown banded agate afforded Redtenbacher (Ramm. Min. Ch., 1007) Si 98-91, 3Pe 0-72, Ca 0 0-31=99-94. 0. Irregularly clouded. The colors various, as in banded agate. A whitish clouded var. (a) is probably the Leucachales Plin. (fr. Xcvms, white) ; (b) a wax-colored, his Cerachates (fr. cera, wax), a name that may have been applied also to ordinary wax-colored chalcedony, as the stone was one in little repute ; (c) a reddish, his Sardachates, or carneUan-agate. The last probably included also banded kinds. Hemachatece (fr. _;>-, blood) was probably a true light-colored agate, blotched with red jasper, \" blushing with spots of blood,\" as says Solinus (King, p. 207), of which there are very beautiful kinds, and not simple red jasper. laspachates must have been an agate in which bluish aud greenish shades (Iaspis) predominated. These names are given by Pliny without accompanying descriptions. y. Colors due lo visiblt impurities, (a) Moss-agate, ot Mocha-stone, fiUed with brown moss-like or dendritic forms distributed through the mass, (fi) Dendritic Agate, containing brown or black dendritic markings. These two are the Dendrachates Plin. (fr. .ii/.p-u, a tree). There is also 6. Agalized wood : wood petrified with clouded agate. 7. Onyx ('Oni^i-v Theophr. Onyx pt. [rest agate, stalagmite, q. v.] Plin., xxxvii. 24) Like agate in consisting of layers of different colors, but the layers are in even planes, and the banding therefore straight, and hence its use for cameos, the head being cut in one color, and another serving for the background. The colors of the best are perfectly weU defined, and either white and black, or white, brown and black alternate. 8. Sardonyx (PUn., xxxvu. 23). Like onyx in structure, but includes layers of carnelian (sard) along with others of white or whitish, and brown, and sometimes black colors. 9. Agate-Jasper. An agate consisting of jasper with veinings and cloudings of chalcedony. 10. Silicious sinter. Irregularly ceUular quartz, formed by deposition from waters containing sUica or soluble silicates in solution. 11. Flint (Silex pt. Plin., Feuerstein Germ.). Somgwhat allied to chalcedony, but more opaque, and of duU colors, usuaUy gray, smoky-brown, and brownish-black. The exterior is often whitish, from mixture with Ume or chalk, in which it is imbedded. Lustre barely glistening, subvitreous. Breaks with a deeply conchoidal fracture, and a sharp cutting edge. The flint of the chalk forma- tion consists largely osthe remains of infusoria (Diatoms), sponges, and other marine productions. The sUica of flint, according to Fuchs, is partly soluble silica. See on thi3 point p. 194. There is usuaUy one per cent, or so of alumina and peroxyd of iron, with one or two\" of water. The coloring matter osthe common kinds is mostly carbonaceous matter. 12. Hornstone (Silex pt, Plin., Hornstein Germ.). Resembles flint, but more brittle, the frac- ture more sphntery. Chert is a term often applied to hornstone, and to any impure flinty rock, including the jaspers. A grayish chalcedonic hornstone from Marienbad afforded Kersten Si 90-30, 51 3-10, 3_>e 1-73, fig 1-28, Cu 094, Na and K 0 70, fl 1'95 (Jahrb. Min., 1845, 656). 13. Basanite, Lydian Stone, or Touchstone (Lapis Lydius Plin., xxxiii. 43, ? Basanites id., xxxvi. 11). A velvet-black siliceous stone or flinty jasper, used on account of its hardness and black color for trying the purity of the precious metals. The color left on the stone after rubbing the metal across it indicates to the experienced eye the amouut of aUoy. It is not splintery hke hornstone. It passes into a compact, fissile, sUiceous, or flinty rock, of grayish and other colors, caUed sUiceous slate, and also Phlhanyte ; and then resembles ordinary jasper of grayish and other shades, especiaUy the banded jaspers. 14. Jasper. Impure opaque colored quartz, (a) Red (H\u00e6matitis Plin., xxxvii. c. 60, not his H\u00e6matites), sesquioxyd of iron being the coloring matter. (6) Brownish, or ochre yellow, colored by hydrous sesquioxyd of iron, and becoming red when so heated as to drive off the water, (c) Dark green and brownish-green, (d) Grayish-blue, (e) Blackish or brownish-black, (f) Striped or riband jasper (Bandjaspis Germ.), having the colors in broad stripes, (g) Egyptian jasper, in nodules which are zoned hi brown and yellowish colors. Porcelain jasper is nothing but baked clay, and differs from true jasper in being B.B. fusible on the edges. Red porphyry, or its base, resembles jasper, but is also fusible on the edges, being usuaUy an impure feldspar. C. Besides the above there are also : \u2014 1. Granular Quartz, or Quartz-rock. A rock consisting of quartz grains very firmly compacted ; the grains often hardly distinct. 2. Quartzose Sandstone. 3. Quartz-conglomerate. A rock made of pebbles of quartz with sand. The pebbles sometimes are jasper and chalcedony, and make a beautiful stone when polished. 4. Itacolumite, or Flexible Sandstone. A friable sand-rock, con-"], [252, "196 OXYGEN COMPOUNDS. sisting mainly of quartz sand, but containing a little talc, and possessing a degree of fiexi biUty when in thin lamin\u00e6. 5. Buhrstone. A cellular, flinty rock, having the nature in part of coarse chalcedony. 6. Pseudomorphous Quartz. Quartz appears also under the forms of many of the mineral species, which it has taken through either the alteration or replacement of crystals of those species. The most common quartz pseudomorphs are those of calcite, barite, fluorite, and siderite. (a) Tabular quartz consists of intersecting plates of quartz, and is probably a result osthe quartz being depos ited among intersecting plates of other minerals, as barite. (6) Haytorite of C. Tripe (Phil. Mag., i. 40, 1827) is a pseudomorph after datholite. (c) Beckite Duf. is a pseudomorph after coral, chalce donic in character, from Devonshire, England ; it contains some of the carbonate of Ume of the original coral (Church, Phil. Mag., IV. xxiii. 95). (d) Babel-quartz is quartz which has impressions of cubes of fluor, arising from its having been deposited over the crystals, (e) Silicified shells are proper pseudomorphs in quartz ; they occur through many rock strata, including limestones. (/) Silicified wood is quartz pseudomorph after wood. The texture of the original wood is usually well retained, it having been formed by the deposit of silica from its solution in the ceUs of the wood, aud finaUy taking the place of the waUs of the cells as the wood itself disappeared. Pyr., etc. \u2014 B.B. unaltered; with borax dissolves slowly to a clear glass ; with soda dissolves with effervescence ; unacted upon by salt of phosphorus. Insoluble in muriatic acid, and only slightly acted upon by solutions of fixed caustic alkaUes. When fused and cooled it becomes opal sUica, having G.=2-2. Obs. \u2014 Quartz occurs as one of the essential constituents of granite, syenite, gneiss, mica schist, and many related rocks ; as the principal constituent of quartz-rock and many sandstones ; as an unessential ingredient in some trachyte, porphyry, etc. ; as the vein-stone in various rocks, and for a large part of mineral veins ; as a foreign mineral in the cavities of trap, basalt, and related rocks, some limestones, etc., making geodes of crystals, or of chalcedony, agate, carneUan, etc. ; as imbedded nodules or masses in various limestones, constituting the flint of the chalk formation, the hornstone of other limestones \u2014 these nodules sometimes becoming continuous layers ; as masses of jasper occasionally in limestone. It is the principal material of the pebbles of gravel beds, and of the sands of the sea-shore and sand beds everywhere. It is reported by G. Rose as occurring in the meteorite of Xiquipulco (Pogg., cxui. 184). SUica also occurs in solution (but mostly as a soluble alkaline sUicate) in heated natural waters, as those of the Geysers of Iceland, New Zealand, and California, and very sparingly in many col mineral waters. Switzerland, Dauphiny, Piedmont, the Carrara quarries, and numerous other foreign localities, afford fine specimens of rock crystal. The most beautiful amethysts are brought from India, Ceylon, and Persia, where they occur in geodes, and as pebbles; inferior specimens occur in Transylvania, in large crystaUine groups ; in the vicinity of Cork, and on the island of May, Ireland. The false topaz is mot with in Brazil. Rose quartz occurs in a vein of manganese, trav ersing the granite of Rabenstein, near Zwiesel in Bavaria. Prase is found in the iron mines of Breitenbruun, near Schwartzemberg in Saxony; and in Brittany, near Nantes and Rennes. The amygdaloids of Iceland and the Faroe Islands, afford magnificent specimens of chalcedony ; also Hiittenberg and Loben in Carinthia, ete. A smalt-blue variety, in cubical crystals (pseudomorphs of fluorite), occurs at Treszytan, in Transylvania. The finest carnelians and agates are found in Arabia, India, BrazU, Surinam, Oberstein, and Saxony. Scotland affords smaUer but handsome specimens (Scotch pebbles). Chrysoprase, at Kosemiitz in SUesia. Aventurine quartz, at Cape de Gata in Spain. Cat's eye, in Ceylon, the coast of Malabar, and also in the Harz and Bavaria. Plasma, in India and China, whence it is usually brought in the form of beads. Heliotrope, in Bucharia, Tartary, Siberia, aud the island of Rum in the Hebrides. Float stone, in the chalk for mation of Menil Montant, near Paris, and in some of the Cornish mines. The banks of the Nile afford the Egyptian jasper ; the striped jasper is met with in Siberia, Saxony, and Devonshire. A yellow jasper is found at Vourla, bay of Smyrna, in a low ridge of limestone, to the right of the watering-place, between the harbor and the high hills back ; it is associated with opal, chryso prase, and hornstone, and these minerals seem to occupy in the limestone the place of hornstone, which is found in various parts of the adjoining country, and also at Napoli di Romania in Greece. The plains of Argos are strewn with pebbles of red jasper. A variety of sandstone occurs in thin layers at ViUa Rica, B i azil, remarkable for its flexib Uity ; a simUar flexible sandstone occurs in the North Carolina gold region. In New York, quartz crystals are abundant in Herkimer Co., at MiddleviUe, Little FaUs, Salis bury, and Newport, loose iu cavities in the Calciferous sand-rock, or imbedded in loose earth, and sometimes, according to Beck, in powdered anthracite. Fine dodecahedral crystals, at the beds of specular iron in Fowler, Herman, and Edwards, St. Lawrence Co. In Gouverneur, crystals, with tourmaline, etc., in limestone, which have rounded angles as if they had been partially fused. On the banks of Laidlaw lake, Rossie, large implanted crystals. The Sterling ore bed, Antwerp, Jefferson Co., interesting dodecahedral crystals. 4 m. E. of Warwick, crystals presenting the rhombohedral form, in jasper. At Palatine, Montgomery Co., crystals, having one end terminated"], [253, "QUARTZ. 197 with the usual pyramid, whUe the other is rounded and smooth. Diamond Rock, near Lansing burgh, an old but poor locality. At EUenville lead mine, Ulster Co., in elegant groups. At Diamond island and Diamond Point, Lake George, quartz crystals, as in Herkimer Co. In Mass., crystals with unusual modifications, sparingly at tho Charlestown syenite quarry, ouo of which from the cabinet of Mr. J. E. Teschemacher is represented in f. 193. It has the adjacent planes 2-2 and 3-| uneven, and \u2014 J- with a triangular furrow but sharp edges ; the rest are lustrous ; with the re flective goniometer, reflecting the sun's rays, R Af-f=175\u00b0. Pelham and Chesterfield, Mass., Paris and Perry, Me., Benton, N. H., Sharon, Vt., and Meadow Mount, Md., are other localities of quartz crystal. Near Quebec, fig. 191, and other crystals similar, but the inverse. At Chesterfield, Mass., smatt unpolished rhombohedrons, in granite. At Paris, Me., handsome crystals of brown or smoky quartz. Iu large crystals, often perfect and weighing several pounds, at Minnesota mine, Lake Superior, occasionaUy enveloped in metallic copper, as if cast around the crystals. Drusy quartz, of brown, apple-green, and other tints, at Newfane, Vt. For other localities, see the catalogue of localities in the latter part of this volume. Rose quartz, at Albany, and Paris, Me., Acworth, N. H., WUliamsburg, Mass., Southbury, Conn., and Port Henry, Essex Co., N. Y. ; smoky quartz, at Goshen, Mass., Richmond Co., N. Y., ete. ; amethyst, in trap, at Keweenaw Point, Pic bay, and Gargontwa, on Lake Superior ; also in the same rock at Bristol, Rhode Island, and sparingly throughout the trap region of Massachusetts and Connecticut ; in Surry, New Hampshire ; in Pennsylvania, in East Bradford, Aston, Chester, and Providence (one fine crystal over 7 lbs. in weight), in Chester Co. ; very handsome at the Prince vein, Lake Superior, but now hardly obtainable, as the mine is not worked ; also very large fine crystals, near Greensboro, N. C. Crystallized green quartz, in talc, at Providence, Delaware Co., Penn. ; at EUenvUle, N. Y., with chlorite. Chalcedony and agates of moderate beauty, in the same trap region ; more abundantly about Lake Superior, the Mississippi, and the streams to the west ; at Natural Bridge, Jefferson Co., N. Y. ; about the Willamot, Columbia, and other rivers in Oregon; abundant and beautiful on N. W. shore of Lake Superior. Belmont's lead mine, St. Lawrence Co., N. Y., has afforded good chalcedony and chrysoprase, associated with calcite. Red jasper is found on Sugar Loaf Mt, Maine ; in pebbles on the banks of the Hudson at Troy ; yellow, with chalcedony, at Chester, Mass. ; red and yellow, near Murphy's, Calaveras Co., Cal. Heliotrope occupies veins in slate at Bloomingrove, Orange Co., N. Y. Smoky quartz in large crystals, some over 100 lbs., have been found on Paradise R., Nova Scotia. Quartz pseudomorphs, after hexagonal and scalenohedral crystals of calcite and cubes of fluorite, at Westhamptou, Mass. ; after barite, probably, in Rutherford Co., N. C, often fiUed with water. Quartz crystals occasionaUy occur of enormous size. A group in the museum of the university at Naples weighs nearly half a ton. A crystal belonging to Sig. RafeUi, of MUan, measures 3| ft. in length and 5-J- in circumference, and its weight is estimated at 870 lbs ; another in Paris is 3 ft. in diameter and weighs 8 cwt. About a century since a drusy cavity was opened at Zinken, which afforded 1,000 owt. of rock crystal, and at that early period brought $300,000. One crystal weighed 80o lbs. A group from Moose Mountain, New Hampshire, at Dartmouth CoUege, weighs 147J, lbs., and contains 48 crystals ; four of them are from 5 to 5-j inches in diameter, ten from 4 to 4 j inches. A crystal from Waterbury, Vt., 2 ft. long and 18 inches through, weighs 175 lbs. Several varieties of this species have long been employed in jewelry. The amethyst has always been esteemed for its beauty. Like most other stones, it is less brilliant by candle-light; it appears to best advantage when surrounded with pearls and set in gold. The color of the ame- thyst is often irregularly diffused, as is weU described by Pliny, \" ad viciuiam crystaUi descendet albicante purpur\u00e6 defectu,\" purple, graduaUy fading into white. It was caUed amethyst, afiiOvaro;, on account of its pretended preservative powers against intoxication, from ., not, and p-law, to intoxicate. This is not, however, the only amethyst of the ancients. The violet-colored sapphire, the violet fluorite (scalpturis facUes, PUn., easily graven), and some other purple species, wero designated by the same name; and it has been supposed that garnet was also included. Cameos are in general made of onyx, which is weU fitted for this kind of miniature sculpture. The most noted of the ancient cameos, is the Mantuan vase at Brunswick. It was cut from a single stone, and has the form of a cream pot, about seven inches high and two and a half broad ; on its outside, which is of a brown color, there are white and yeUow groups of raised figures, representing Ceres and Triptolemus in search of Proserpine. The Museo Borbonico, at Naples, contains an onyx measuring eleven inches by nine, representing the apotheosis of Augustus, and another exhibiting the apotheosis of Ptolemy on one side and the head of Medusa on the^ other; both are splendid specimens of the art, and the former is supposed to be the largest in existence. The carnelian is often rich in color, but is too common to be much esteemed ; when first obtained from the rock they are usuaUy gray or grayish-red ; they receive their fine colors from nn exposure of several weeks to the sun's rays, and a subsequent heating in earthen pots. The colors of agate, when indistinct, may be brought out by boding in oU, and afterward in sulphuric acid ; the latter carbonizes the oil absorbed by the porous layers, and thus increases the contrast"], [254, "198 OXYGEN COMPOUNDS. of the different colors. Agate is often made into mortars for chemical and pharmaceutical pre parations, and, according to Pliny, it was employed for the same purpose by the physicians of his day. Pliny also mentions that \" the best cautery for the human body is a ball of crystal acted on by the sun \" (xxxvii. 10). He deplores the extravagance of his times, as exhibited in the crystal drinking cups and vases of the wealthy. Jasper admits of a brUliant polish, and is often formed into vases, boxes, knife-handles, etc. It is also extensively used in the manufacture of Florentine mosaics. Quartz is distinguished by its hardness\u2014 scratching glass with faciUty ; infusibility\u2014 not fusiing before the blowpipe ; insolubility\u2014 not attacked by water or the acids ; uncleavabiliiy\u2014oue variety being tabular, but proper cleavage never being distinctly observed. To these characteristics tho action of soda B.B. may be added. The word quartz is of German provincial origin. Agate is from the name of the river Achates, in Sicily, whence specimens were brought, as stated by Theophrastus. Alt.\u2014 Pseudomorphs of pyrite, tin ore, stannite, magnetite, hematite, and voltzite, after quartz, have been met with. 232. OPAL. Opalus, P\u00e6deros, Plin., xxxvn. 21, 22. Quartz resinite H., Tr., u. 1801. Massive, amorphous ; sometimes small reniform, stalactitic, or large tuberose. Also earthy. H. =5-5 \u2014 6-5. G. = l-9\u2014 2-3. Lustre vitreous, frequently subvitreous ; often inclining to resinous, and sometimes to pearly. Color white, yellow, red, brown, green, gray, generally pale ; dark colors arise from foreign admixtures ; sometimes a rich play of colors, or different colors by re fracted and reflected light. Streak white. Transparent to nearly opaque. Comp. \u2014 Si, as for quartz, silica being dimorphous, the opal condition being one of lower degrees of hardness and specific gravity, and, as generally believed, of incapabUity of crystalliza tion. Water is usuaUy present, but it is regarded as unessential. It varies in amount from 2-75 to 21 p. c. ; or, mostly, from 3\u20149 p. c. = Si + fl to Si + i fl (or 9 Si + fl to 3 Si+ A). Opal often contains more or less of quartz mixed with it ; and most of the analyses are unsatisfactory, because they leave the amount of the latter whoUy unconsidered ; and since solubility in a hot solution of caustic potash is not a decisive test of opal as shown by Rammelsberg (Pogg., cxii. 177), no method for its exact determination is known. (See p. 192, under Quartz.) Rammelsberg's percentage results are as foUows ; under the heading ign. & S, the sum of the loss by both is given, and in brackets that by drying over sulphuric acid alone : G. G. aster ign.

Grochau and flint, singly-refracting, with spots of doubly-refracting. Var. \u2014 1. Precious Opal. Exhibits a play of delicate colors, or, as Pliny says, presents various refulgent tints in succession, reflecting now one hue and now another. Seldom larger than a hazel nut ; a mass in the Vienna museum has the size of a man's fist and weighs 17 oz., but has numerous fissures, and is not whoUy free from the matrix. 2. Fire-opal (Feueropal, fr. Mexico, Humboldt, Karsten, Klapr. Beitr., iv. 156, 1807). Hyacinth red to honey-yeUow colors, with fire-like reflections, somewhat irised on turning. 3. Girasol. Bluish-white, translucent, with reddish reflections in a bright light. 4. Common Opal.

The last mentioned is the probable source of the opal of limestones and argUlaceous beds (as it is of flint in the same rocks), and of part of that in igneous rocks. It exists in most chalcedony and flint. Being like quartz in origin, it is natural that the two should be often mixed together. Common opal and hyalite are products osthe decomposition of a Roman cement at the hot springs of Plombi.res in France. Precious opal occurs in porphyry at Czerwenitza, near Kashau in Hungary, at Frankfort, and at Oracias a Dios in Honduras. - Fire opal occurs at Zimapau in Mexico ; Fardo ; near San Antonio, Honduras. Common opal is abundant at Telkebanya in Hungary ; near Pernstein, Luekau, and Smrezet in Moravia ; in Bohemia ; at Kosemiitz in ISUesia ; Hubertsburg in Saxony ; Stanzel- berg and Quegstein in Siebengebirge ; Steinheim near Hanau ; in Faroe, Iceland ; the Giant's Causeway, and the Hebrides ; also within -J m. and to the S.W. of the watering-place at Vourla, the harbor of Smyrna, along with yeUow jasper and hornstone, imbedded in a low ridge of yel- lowish compact limestone ; of a wax-yellow and grayish-green color, occasionaUy white, at the Giant's Causeway. Hyalite occurs in amygdaloid at Schemnitz, Hungary ; in clinkstone at Waltsch, Bohemia. Wood opal forms large trees in the pumice conglomerates of Saiba, near Neu- sohl ; Kremnitz, Hungary ; Faroe ; near Hobart Town, Tasmania ; and in many other regions of igneous rocks. The Luneberg earth contaius many species of infusoria, and is 10 to 18 ft. thick. In U. S , hyalite occurs sparingly in N. York, at the PhUlips ore bed, Putnam Co., in thin coat- ings on granite ; rarely in N. C, Cabarrus Co., with the auriferous quartz ; in Georgia, in Burke and Scriven Cos., fining cavities in a siliceous sheU-rock ; in Washington Co., good fire opal ; at the Snanna spring, Florida, smaU quantities of sUiceous sinter. The precious opal, when large, and exhibiting its pecuhar play of colors in perfection, is a gem of high value. It is cut with a convex surface. 233.

They are generaUy associated with chalcedony, and Jenzsch regards them as a result of its alteration."], [258, "202 OXYGEN COMPOUNDS. II. TERNARY OXYGEN COMPOUNDS. 1. SILICATES. A. ANHYDROUS SILICATES. The following are the general subdivisions of the Anhydrous Silicates : I. Bisilicates. Oxygen ratio for the bases and Silica 1 : 2. II. Unisilicates. Oxygen ratio for the bases and Silica 1 : 1. III. Subsilicates. Oxygen ratio for the bases and Silica 1 : less than 1 ; mostly 1 : \u00a7 ; but also 1 : \u00a3, and 1 : f . These subdivisions are essentially the same that were brought forward in the last edition of this work. The section of Tersilicates has, however, disappeared, the species hitherto arranged under that head being proved to have no existence ; and the few Sesquisilicates, and the Micas and Feld spars, are added to the Unisilicates. Constitution and Formulas of Silicates\u2014 The bases in the SUicates comprise various elements of Series I. (see p. 2) in their different states of oxydation, protoxyd, sesquioxyd, or deutoxyd, and possibly tritoxyd; namely, K, Na, Li, Th, Cs, H, Ba, Sr, Ca, Mg, Ce, La, Di, Fe, Mn, Cr, Al, and rarely also Zn, Ni, Co, Ti; and in a few cases boron, of Series II, in the tritoxyd state. The ele ment sUicon is so strongly negative, that in its oxygen combinations aU other elements present are relatively basic. The basic elements enumerated, when in the same state of oxydation, are mutuaUy replaceable ; and, as the analyses beyond illustrate, 8 or 10 often occur in the same compound, combined either in simple, or indeterminate, ratios. But whUe in general thus replacing one another, there are certain groups, as, for example, the Feldspar and Scapolite, in which __1 is not replaced by Fe, nor Ca, Na, K by Mg, or Fe, the presence of the latter ingredients being an irregularity, and proof of mixture or alteration. The basic elements are also mutuaUy replaceable when in different states of oxydation, under the law that parts equal in power of combination with oxygen are equivalent or isomorphous ; that is, tlie replacing power equals the combining power. Thus 3 R 0 (=R3 O3), R2 0s, | R 0 (= Rl O3). i R2 O6, R 0s are replaceable ; and so also are R2 O2 (=2 R 0), and R 03 ; for the basic metal is combined with an equal amount of oxygen, 3 atoms in the former group, and 2 in the latter. The basic metals of these different oxyds by themselves represent so many different states cor responding to the states of oxydation, and are therefore equivalents in combination. The above formulas, if divided by 3, become reduced to the protoxyd form R 0, RS 0, Ri 0, R^ 0, Ri 0, and the expressions for the different states of the basic metals, to R, Rt, Ri, Rl, R.. The first three of these states have been denominated in a note to page 2, and in the Introduction, p. xv, the alpha, beta, and gamma states ; the expressions are correspondingly written _R, /?R, yR, -R, 'R _R0 equals RO, or a protoxyd. So also #R 0=\u00a3(R2 O3), or a third of a sesquioxyd; yRO= i (R 0\u00b0), or half of a deutoxyd ; and \u00a3R 0=J (R O3), or one-third of a tritoxyd. _R, /SR, yR, <SK, -R, are mutually replaceable, or equivalent in substitutions. The Bisilicates come under a single general formula, which may either have the form A, or that of B. The a is here dropped, it being unnecessary. A. (Rs, _., Rf, R) Si3 B. (RO, /.RO, yR0, .RO)Si"], [259, "203 SILICATES. The Unisilicates have the corresponding formula : A. (A3, S, Ri, R)2 Si3 B. (R 0, /?

(R 0, /?R 0) Si (RO, /JRO) Si If the latter formulas (B) be multiplied by 3, after substituting the value of 0 R, they becomt the exact equivalent of the former ; but they are not necessarUy the better for this multiplication, because chemistry is not yet able to decide positively whether, in the different cases, the multi plier should not rather be 6, 9, or some other number. In the new system of chemistry the formulas of the BisUicates and Unisilicates, in their most general form, are written in the foUowing manner, essentiaUy, by writers on the subject, except that the letter R is here used with the Greek letters to express the metal in the different states of oxydation : * BisiUcates Si 0 ) Aj R2, R, 0S, yR f w UnisUicates Si ) \u00a3,4 R2, R, 0R, yR)** These formulas may be more conveniently written in a single line, as follows ; and to facUitate a comparison, the formulas of the older system are here added : Old system. Old system modified. New system.

The Subsilicates vary in formula according to the varying ratios, as presented beyond (p. 362). The only sUicates having the basic metals in the sesquioxyd state alone occur among the SubsUi cate.. Besides the sUicates that are obviously Bisilicates and UnisUicates, there are others which, whUe bisilicate or unisiUcate in type, contain a surplus of silica in serial ratios. The Feldspar group is remarkable for its unity in crystaUographic and aU physical characters, evincing the profoundest isotypism ; and yet the oxygen ratio for the bases and silica varies from 1 : 1 to 1 : 3. The fact that all the essential characters of a Feldspar appear iu their perfection under the unisilicate ratio shows that the amount of sUica of a UnisiUcate is aU that is required to make a Feldspar, and hence that the type is strictly unisilicate ; and further, that the excess of sUica must exist in the species in some state consistent with conformity to the unisiUcate type. The amount of silica in the species of the Feldspar group increases with the increasing proportion of alkali in the mineral, from anorthite, a Unisilicate without, usuaUy, any alkali, to albite and ortho clase, literal Trisilicates, with the protoxyd bases solely alkaline. The Micas vary in the same way, being unisilicate strictly in the species containing the least alkali, and having a higher proportion as the alkah increases, and the highest in the lithia mica3, in one of which the ratio is 1 : 2. The Meionite section of the Scapolite group is in meionile strictly unisUicate, without alkali, while mizzonite has much alkaU and more siUca in proportion than meionite, and marialite (which like mizzonite is hardly distinguishable from meionite in crystaUo graphic or physical characters) is bisiUcate, with the alkaU constituting much the larger part of the protoxyd bases. The SeapoUte section of the ScapoUte group iUustrates the same point. The special ratios for this and each of the preceding groups are stated in the general remarks preceding the section on tho UnisiUcates. Among Bisilicates, spodumene is closely related to the Pyroxene group in crystaUization and other characters, including the oxygen ratio for the bases aud sUica, although alumina and lithia are prominent constituents. Petahte has the same crystaUization (as shown by Descloizeaux) and the same constituents as spodumene, and therefore is also pyroxene-like in its fundamental char acteristics ; and yet it contains twice the proportion of sUica, the oxygen ratio for R, R, Si in * R2 stands for 2 of a monad element, as potassium, sodium, lithium, thaUium, c\u00e6sium, rubi dium, hydrogen, and R for other basic elements, as already explained. See also Am. J. Sci., II. xliv. 252, 261, and Introd., p. xv."], [260, "204 OXYGEN COMPOUNDS. spodumene being 1:4:10, and in petalite 1 : 4 : 20, a contrast of great interest in this connect on, as remarked by Descloizeaux. The amount of sihca in spodumene shows what is essential to the type, and therefore proves that both are essentiaUy BisUicates. It differs from petalite in that the protoxyd bases include a little lime and protoxyd of iron (about one-twelfth of all the protoxyds, from the average of the best analyses, those of Rammelsberg, Hagen, and Smith & Brush), whilo in petaUte they are purely alkaline.* The Feldspars, Micas, and the Meionite and Scapolite groups are examples of a surplus of silica in species under the unisilicate type, and the Spodumene group under the bisUicate. In each the alkaU present appears to be the determinative cause. The surplus silica above what the type requires may have one of the two following conditions : Either it may be (1 ) part basic (half of it under the unisilicate type, and one-third of it under the bisUicate type) ; or it may be (2) all acces sory sihca. The formula of albite, under the unisiUcate type, to which it is shown above to be long, would be as foUows, according to these two methods : lstmethod ft Na3 + f __1+| Sify Si3, or Si||e4[(iNa2+f /?__l + fySi)2 2d method (|Na3 + f__l)2 Si3+3 Si, or Sije^.i Na. + J /. Al) + Si 0)2 For other examples see the formulas of the UnisUicates beyond (p. From the facts here explained it foUows that the Mica and Feldspar groups should be annexed entire to the section of UnisUicates ; and petalite to the section of BisUicates. The intermediate sUicates are thus mostly disposed of without the provision of other sections. Iolite has the 0 ratio for bases and sUica of muscovite (or 1 : IJ), and its excess of silica above that of the UnisU icates may be of the same nature as in that species. The case of nephelite may be simUar. The hydrous species of sUicates are here separated from the anhydrous, as in other divisions in the classification, because the course seems most convenient in the present imperfect state of chemical science. There is no criterion yet furnished for deciding upon the state of the water present, whether part, or all, or none, is basic ; and until chemists have some means of reaching safe conclusions on this point, the true relations of the hydrous and anhydrous species cannot to any great extent be positively made out. Moreover there is often doubt as to whether the water present is simply hygrometric and accidental ; or whether it exists as a result of incipient or ad vanced alteration of the mineral ; or whether it belonged to the species from its origin ; and these doubts still further complicate the subject. In some silicates, as euclase for example, the water appears to be so plainly basic that the species have been arranged beyond with the anhydrous ; and this is the beginning of a final disregard of the distinction which wiU probably before long be warranted. In the descriptions of the sihcates beyond, the chemical formulas given are those of the old system, as these are equaUy inteUigible to all chemists. But in the tables preceding the general divisions of the species, the new formulas are introduced as well as the old. Note on the History of the Silicates. In the work of the Swedish mineralogist WaUerius, of 1747, silicates as such are unrecognized, and the only species of those now so caUed which are described, are the gems that passed under the names of emerald, beryl, topaz, hyacinth, chrysolite, garnet; clays of various kinds aud names ; mica, talc, serpentine, amianthus, asbesius, feldspar, and the convenient pocket for various undetermined heavy stones, named Corneus \u2014 the Hornbdrg of the Swedish mineralogist, and Roche de Corne of his French translator, and which embraced Skiorl (Schorl of the Germans) as a prominent part of it. Quartz (Kieselsten, or Silex) in its many varieties, with opal, made up a large part of the non-metaUic division of the science, occupying 30 pages out of 200. Feldspar is placed in the genus Spatum, as Spatum pyrimachum (or scintillating spar) along side of fluor, Iceland spar, and heavy spar ; and sapphire and the other precious stones are in the group of Gems. AU of these species excepting feldspar had special names in Pliny's time; and feldspar is distinctly referred to in Agricola as \" Silex ex eo ictu ferri facUe ignis elicitur, in cubis alusque siguris intersectis constans\" (p. 314, 1546). Cronstedt's work of 1758 includes with the preceding the species Zeolite, a recent discovery of his own (1756); but adds no others. He shows however his acumen in making his group of Kiesel-Arter (siliceous minerals) to include not only the varieties of quartz, but also feldspar and the gems above enumerated (and his adding to it the diamond is not surprising). Garnet and schorl are left outside, and make the two species of his Granat-Arter ; Mica (GUmmer-Arter) and Asbesius (Asbest-Arter), with Ler-Arter (clay minerals), are the other independent groups. Transparent tourmalines from Ceylon were among the gems of the day, having been first intro duced into Europe in 1707 or before, but they are not distinctly mentioned by Cronstedt or Wai lerius. * See further on this subject a paper by the author in Am. J. Sci., II. xliv. 398, 1867."], [261, "205 SILICATES. The group of Schorl increased in its varieties for the next twenty-five years, and after that became prolific in species, and much of the history of mineralogy is involved in its various phases. The Mowing observatious make, therefore, an introduction to the synonymy of many minerals beyond. The Corneus, or Hornbdrg, of Wallerius included a variety of hard, cheap or worthless stones, rather heavy, mostly of dark colors from black to dull green. The name aUudes to a resemblance to horn in the aspect of some of the kinds. To Corneus solidus belonged the massive, compact, flinty rocks of black and lighter shades ; also petrosilex (or Hdllefitnla of the Swedes, which means false flint) of different shades; and massive hornblende (\"granulis compactis\"), though the name hornblende was, by a mistake of its G erman use, given by WaUerius to a black zinc-blende alone. His Corneus fissilis embraced lamellar forms of hornblende and pyroxene, and some slaty rocks. White Corneus crystdllisatus was his Skiorl, which comprised opaque tourmaUnes, and other prismatic minerals of black, brown, green, and reddish colors, as hornblende, actinolite, and perhaps pj'roxene, and at the head of the list basalt, and basanite or Lydian stone. Cronstedt's Skorl made up his genus Basalies, and was nearly synonymous with the Corneus crystallizatus of WaUerius. Its varieties were better defined ; and to massive, lamellar, and colum- nar hornblende, actinolite and pyroxene and crystallized opaque tourmaline were added ; and in an appendix to the species, cruciform staurotide. The name Hornblende is applied only to the mas- sive variety or rock which Cronstedt made a bole, and caUed Bolus induratis parliculis squamosis ; it probably covered other similar stones. J. HiU in his work on Fossils, pubUshed in London, and according to the title page in 1771 (though de Lisle says it was not issued untU 1772), says of the \"Shirls,\" that \"as to size we see them from that of barley corn up to the Giant's Causeway,\" and the columns of the latter he calls \"Irish ShirL\" or \"Basaltes Hibernicus.\" The group contains also made or chiastoUte from Andalusia, besides tourmaline, etc. In the editions of Wallerius of 1772 and 1778 there is a little advance beyond the first as re- gards the number and classification of the species. Cronstedt is foUowed in the position of feld- spar, and in the name \" Basaltes \" for the schorls ; and Corneus is restricted to massive, fibrous, and coarse columnar stones, among which stands \" hornblende \" as Corneus spathosus, and \" trapp \" as Corneus trapezius. At this period de Lisle brought crystaUography to bear on the subject. But whUe making known new distinctions, he did not appreciate their fuU value, or the precision required for thorough work. A. a consequence, the group of Schorls (or Schorls, as he writes the word) in his later treatise of 1783, reached its greatest extension, although in a partly divided state. He early pronounced basaltic columns no crystals, and dropped off this excrescence. He showed in 1772 that the gem tourmaline, his Transparent rhomboidal schorl, was identical in form with the common black schorl. But still he made the latter a distinct species, his Opaque rhomboidal schorl, and included in it, along with black or opaque tourmaline, crystals of hornblende, augite, octahe- drite from Oisans, rutile (needles in quartz), and, as a white variety, thin twins of albite, whose relation to feldspar he did not perceive ; and even hexagonal nephelite from Vesuvius has a passing remark under this head. Axinite, then a novelty from Dauphiny, was made a short lenticular variety of Transparent rhomboidal schorl, or tourmaline, its rhomboidal planes proving to his eye the relationship. The massive mineral called Hornblende, or Roche de Come, referred by Cronstedt to Bole, he annexes to Schorl as a massive or semierystallized kind, but makes it a separate species, Schorl argileux, although apparently appreciating that it was Uttle entitled to the distinction. Schorl cru.ciforme was his last species in the group, and to it were referred both andalusite and staurolite \u2014 the latter his Pierre de croix, with the prismatic angle of 130\u00b0 by his measurement; and the former, Macle basaltique, with an angle of 95\u00b0. The garnets and schorls were placed iu a common division, as done by Cronstedt, and garnet was made the first species, with tourmaline the second, and \"cruciform schorl\" the fifth. Garnet included the \"white garnet,\" as it was caUed, of Vesuvius (leucite), first observed by Ferber iu 1772. Besides these Silicates, de Lisle's work has its several groups of Gems, Feldspar, Argillaceous Minerals (em- bracing mica, asbestus, talc, serpentine), Zeolite, aud Quartz. Labradorite, from Labrador (first brought to Europe about 1770), stands as a variety of feldspar, to which it had beeu referred by Werner; idocrase, of which many figures are given by him (first described and figured by Cappeler in 1722), meionite (hyacintes blanches), from Somma, and harmotome from Andreas- berg (his hyacinte blanche cruciforme, made calcareous spar by v. Born in 1775, who first mentions and figures it, but a hyacinth-like siliceous species by Bergmann in 1780), are placed with zircon as kinds of hyacinth. After de Lisle, as chemistry and crystaUography made progress, the disintegration of the great Schorl group went rapidly forward, until the only thing left to it was common tourmaline ; and now the name, once so important, has become a mere mineralogical reUc. In Werner's system of 1789. as pubhshed by Hoffmann (Bergm. J., i. 369, 1789), Schorl includes only the species Tourmaline as it now stands. The Kieselarten, or SUiceous species (commencing with the diamond still), comprised the different gems ; among which stands chrysoberyl (the modern), and, as distinct"], [262, "206 OXYGEN COMPOUNDS. species, axinite, prehnite, hornblende of various kinds, with feldspar, mica, chlorite, the clays, etc. ; while under Talkarlen, or Magnesian species, there are kyanite, actinolite, with asbestus, talc, serpentine, nephrite, etc. SiUca was first proved to be a chemical constituent of many mineral species by Bergmann ; and in his Opuscula (1780) and his Sciagraphia Regni Mineralis (1782) he distinguishes, after analyses by himself (made by fusion with potash, a method of his own), the following minerals as siliceous compounds of alumina, with or without lime or magnesia, namely, topaz, emerald, garnet, schorl (black tourmaline), hornblende, mica, zeolite from Iceland, feldspar, and the clays ; and as essen- tiaUy magnesian silicates, containing lime and a Uttle iron, and little or no alumina, actinolite, asbestus (mountain cork and mountain leather), amianthus, steatite. These were the investiga- tions that commenced the disbanding of the schorls, and before Werner's system of 1789 was published, many other analyses, more or less imperfect, had already been made by Wiegleb, Klaproth, Achard, Heyer, Mayer, Hopfner, PeUetier, and other chemists of the day. The word Schorl of the Germans has been supposed to be derived from the name of a locality of the mineral, Schorlau (meaning Schori-vUlage) in Germany. But Prof. Naumann says (m a recent letter to the author) that it is more likely that the name is a miner's term of unknown origin, and that the viUage got its name from the occurrence there of the schorL Some German mineralogists have pronounced it of Swedish origin, and as first used by Cronstedt. But it occurs in Briickmann's MagnaUa Dei, published at Braunschweig in 1727, on page 175, where it is spelt schirl It exists also stiU earlier, as the author has found, in Ercker's Aula Subterranea, first published in 1595, shurl and wolfram being spoken of as among the rejected material in auriferous washings; and again in the yet older work of Gesner, De Rerum Foss, etc., 1565, p. 87, where schurl (misspelt? schrul) is given as the German for \" LapUU nigri sterUes \" of a tin vein, which, \"quando cum lapUlis plumbi candidi [or tin] coquuntur plumbum consumunt,\" etc.; again, in Matthesius's Sarepta, 1562, in the yth \"Predigt,\" where \"Schurl\" is quite fnUy described, and also, in the next paragraph, \"Wolffrumb.\" The name Schorl (or Schurl) was at that time used quite indefinitely for the sterile (or metaUnrgicaUy worthless) black little stones (\"nigri lapilli \") accompanying tin ore and gold, especially the former ; and, as they were among the refuse of the ore-washings, Adelung suggests that Schorl may have come from the old Ger man word Schor, meaning impurities, or refuse. General Pyrognostic Characters of the Silicates. In the systematic pyrognostic examination of sUicates, the following points should be particularly noticed -. 1. If in the closed tube the substance prove hydrous, the water given out should be tested as to whether it is acid or alkaline. If acid, this may be evidence that the mineral contains fluorine ; and if alkaUne, that possibly the substance is an altered mineral. In the former case, the water should be (a) tested with Brazil-wood paper; (b) the tube should be carefuUy observed, to ascer tain whether it has been dimmed or etched by the action of the fluorine ; and, further (c), the test for fluorine, by fusing in the open tube with salt of phosphorus, should be employed. 2. In the examination B.B. on charcoal it should be noted that silicates containing much iron become magnetic; and sUicates osthe oxyds of iron, copper, etc., yield metaUic buttons on fusion with soda. 3. In examining the mineral in the platinum-pointed forceps, it should always be treated in O.F. to ascertain (a) whether it imparts a color to the flame ; and (. ) its fusibUity, remembering that some siUcates, infusible in O.F., become fusible by a reduction of their bases to a lower state of oxydation in R.F. It is to be noted that (c) only infusible and light-colored sUicates can be tested for alumina B.B. with cobalt solution, since all fusible siUcates, not containing metaUic oxyds, give a cobalt-blue glass ; (d) a smaU amount of soda in a sUicate may, by the intense yeUow color it imparts to the flame, mask a much larger percentage of potash or other alkaU, as iu the case of some varieties of potash-feldspar (orthoclase) ; (e) when silicates, like hornblende, pyroxene, or garnet, contain various isomorphous bases, the fusibility of the species has a wide range ; in garnet, for example, it varying from the easy fusibUity of almandine to the infusibUity of ouvaro vite; (/) a few sUicates react alkaline after ignition or fusion. 4. In treatment with the fluxes, it is to be noted (a) that most sUicates are dissolved in soda with effervescence, (b) If sulphur or sulphuric acid is present, the mineral gives in R.F. a sulphid which reacts for sulphur when moistened and placed on a surface of sUver. (c) Borax dissolves sUicates ; and if they contain metallic oxyds, the nature of these oxyds may be determined by treatment in O.F. and R.F. (d) Salt of phosphorus decomposes almost all siUcates, dissolving the bases, and leaving a gelatinous skeleton of insoluble sihca ; and if metaUic oxyds are present, they may also impart a characteristic color to the bead in O.F. and R.F."], [263, "207 BISILICATES.

Bresouars in the Vosges, olive-green, in serpentine ; in Pennsylvania, at LeiperviUe and Texas; at Kupferberg in Bavaria; at Baste in the Harz (Protobastite); and at the other localities mentioned. The bronzite also of Lettowitz and Goldenstein in Moravia, of Alpstein near Sontra in Hesse, of Cape Lizard in Cornwall, may belong here according to Des cloizeaux ; but their chemical and optical characters are not yet ascertained. The brown pyrox ene-like mineral which is a prominent constituent of the rock caUed Lherzolile, from the depart ment of Arriege, France, is referred here by Descloizeaux. The bronzite of LeiperviUe afforded Descloizeaux prisms of 87\u00b0 and 93\u00b0; and that of Texas, half a mile W. of the village, occurs in large foliated and fibrous masses ; neither is submetaUic in lustre. Descloizeaux first defined the limits of this species, as here laid down. Named from Wnir-c, an opponent, because so refractory. The name bronzite has priority, but a bronze lustre is not essential, and is far from universal. Shepard's chladnite was so imper fectly and incorrectly described that the name cannot claim precedence ; he made it a tersUicate of magnesia (1. a). Alt Bastile or Schiller spar, the original from Baste in the Harz, is regarded by Streng as altered protobastite or bronzite. G. Rose long since pronounced it a result of the alteration of some mineral of the pyroxene group. Ph\u00e6sline Breith. is stated by Breithaupt to be altered bronzite or bronze-like pyroxene. Enstatite occurs altered to talc. See Basttte, p. 469. 236. HYPERSTHENE. Labradorische Hornblende (fr. I. St. Paul) Wern., Bergm. J., 376, 391, 1789. Diallage m.talloide pt. __\"., Tr., 1801.

Usually two or more of these bases are present. The first ttfree, lime, magnesia, and protoxyd of iron, are most common ; but lime is the only one that is present always and in large percentage. Besides the substitutions of different protoxyd bases for one another, these same bases are at times replaced by sesquioxyd bases (Si, Pe, Mn), though sparingly; and the sUica occasionaUy by alumina. The species has therefore the general formula (R3, R) (Si, Sl*)a, which may also be written (R, _.*) (Si, Si*). The varieties proceeding from these isomorphous substitutions are many and diverse ; and there are still others depending on the state of crystaUization. The foliated and fibrous kinds early received separate names, and for a whUe were regarded as distinct species. Fibrous or columnar forms are very much less common than in hornblende, and lamellar or foUated kinds more com mon. The crystals are rarely long and slender, or bladed, Uke those of that species. The name Pyroxene is from -nio, fire, and (Ivor, stranger, and records Haiiy's idea that the mine ral was, as he expresses it, \" a stranger in the domain of fire,\" whereas, in fact, it is, next to the feldspars, the most universal constituent of igneous rocks. This error, however, was more than counterbalanced by Haiiy's discovery of the true crystaliographic distinction of the species, which led him to bring together, under this one name, what Werner and others had regarded as distinct species. The name, therefore, is properly the name of the species, while Augite is only entitled to be used for one of its varieties. The most prominent division of the species is into (A) the non-aluminous ; (B) the aluminous. But the former of these groups shades imperceptibly into the lavter. These two groups are generaUy subdivided according to the p \"-evalence of the magnesia, lime, protoxyd of iron, or protoxyd of manganese, or of two or three to.gether of these protoxyd bases. Yet here, also, the gradation from one series to another is in geneial by almost insensible shades as to composition and chemical characters, as weU as aU physical qualities. I.

Formula (Ca, _\u00c6g, Fe) Si. In anal. 9, 6a : Mg : Fe= 2 : 1 : 2 ; in 10, 11, this ratio=4 : 3 : 1, corresponding to SUica 53'7, magnesia 13-4, lime 249, prot. iron 8-0=100. b. Baikalite is a dark dingy green variety, in crystals, cleavable like the preceding parallel to 0. Named from Lake Baikal, in Siberia- near which it occurs. c. Protheite is sombre-green, in crystals, and approaches fassaite ; from ZUlerthal in the Tyrol. d. Funkite_ is dark olive-green coccolite from Boksater in Gothland, having a larger percentage of Fe than Mg. It may be convenient to use this name for the pyroxene here included that con tains 10 p. c. or more of protoxyd of iron. e. Diallage. (DiaUage pt. H., Tr., 89, 1801. Hypersthene pt. Bronzite pt.) Part of the so-caUed diallage, or thin-foliated pyroxene, belongs here, and the rest under the corresponding division of the aluminous pyroxenes. Color grayish-green to bright grass-green, and deep green ; lustre of cleavage surface pearly, sometimes metalloidal or brassy; H.=4; G.=3'2 \u2014 3-35. Double refraction strong; bisectrix negative ; inclined about 38\u00b0 to a normal to i-i, and showing therefore, when viewed through i-i, a single system of rings in the field of the polarizing instrument (Descl.); the angle 35\u00b0 to 40\u00b0, observed in the air (24\u00b0 \u2014 26\u00b0 in oil) in the diallage of Knockdallian in Scotland, of Zobtenberg and Baumgarten in Silesia; a grayish hypersthene-Uke mineral in large folia in the gabbro osthe Ruben coal mine near Neurode ; the vanadiferous bronzite of Genoa. But the green diallage of Neurode, analyzed by v. Rath (No. 4, p. 219), has this angle about 49\u00b0 50' ; and so also that of Bormio iu Veltlin ; diverging thus from ordinary diaUage and diopside. With this variety belongs part also of what has been caUed hypersthene and bronzite \u2014 the part that is easUy fusible. Common especiaUy in serpeutine rocks. Named from SiaXXayii, difference, in aUusion to the dissimilar cleavages. The grass-green diallage-like mineral smaragdite, constituting, with saussurite, a rock, is in part, at least, amphibole (q. v). 3. Iron-Lime Pyroxene; Hedenbekgjte. (Hedenbergite (fr. Tunaberg) Berz., Nouv. Syst. Min., 206, 269, 1819; Hedenberg, Ash., ii. 169. Lotalite (fr. Lotala) Severgin, before 1814. Bolophe rit Breith., Handb., 582, 1847.) Color black.

Anal, correspond to (| 6a-t-4. Fe) Si. Named after the Swedish chemist, Ludwig Hedenberg, who first analyzed and described the mineral. Lotalite, from Lotala in Fin land, is in black lameUar masses. Beudant gives for the angles of hedenbergite 0 A 7=100\u00b0 10' \u2014 12', I A 1=81\u00b0 15' ; and Breithaupt for the Taberg mineral (Pyroxenus diagonalis Breith.)

Contains lime, magnesia, and protoxyd of manganese, and in the absence of zinc differs from jeffersouite. Formula (Ca, Sig, Mn) Si ; from Longban. The Richtente of Breith. (B. H. Ztg., xxiv. 364, 1865) is near schefferite in composition. It occurs in acicular crystals, having /A 7= 133\u00b0 38', which appears to be the angle I A i-i of pyroxene ( = 133\u00b0 33'), with G. = 2-826; color isabeUa-yeUow, rarely pale yeUowish-brown, and is easUy fusible. If the prismatic angle is I A i-i of pyroxene, the mineral belongs here. But Igelstrom finds a very similar mineral in aspect and composition at Paisberg, with I A /=124\u00b0 ; and the analyses are given under amphibole (see p. ). 5. Lime-Iron-Manganese Pyroxene. A variety from L. Laach, analyzed by Bischof, is here included. 6. Lime-Iron-Manganese-Zinc Pyroxene ; JeffersO-UTE (Keating & Vanuxem, J. Ac. Philad., u. 194, 1822). Color greenish-black. Crystals often very large (3-4 in. thick), with the angles generally rounded, and the faces uneven, as if corroded. G.=3-36. Contains lime, magnesia, protoxyd of"], [272, "216 OXYGEN COMPOUNDS. iron, and protoxyd of manganese, with oxyd of zinc; formula (Ca, Pe, Sig, Sin, 2n) Si. Named after Mr. Jefferson. II. ALUMINOUS. 7. Aluminous Lime-Magnesia Pyroxene ; Leucaugite (Dana). Color white or grayish. Con tains alumina, with lime and magnesia, and little or no iron ; formula (Ca, Sig) (Si, Sr).

Contain protoxyd of iron, with lime and magnesia ; general formula (Ca, Mg, Fe) (Si, Si*). a. Fassaite (or Pyrgom). Includes the green kind3 found in metamorphic rocks. Named from the locaUty at Fassa in Piedmont, which affords deep-green crystals, sometimes pistachio-green, like the epidote of the locality. Pyrgom was so named from -voyiofia, a tower. b. Augite. Includes the greenish or brownish-black and black kinds, occurring mostly in eruptive rocks, but also in metamorphic. Named from dvyfi, lustre. The Augite of Werner (and Volcanite Delameth.) included only the black mineral of igneous rocks \u2014 the volcanic schorl of earUer authors. c. Aluminous Diallage. 9. Aluminous Iron-Lime Pyroxene; HuDSON-TE (Beck, Min. N. Y., 405, 1842). LameUar or cleav able massive. Color black. Streak green. Often has a bronze tarnish. G.=3'5, Beck; 3'43 \u2014 3'46, Brewer. Contains lime and protoxyd of iron, with but little magnesia; formula (Ca, Fe) (Si, Si*). Named from the Hudson river, in the vicinity of which it occurs, in Cornwall, Orange Co., N. Y. 6. Polylite of Thomson (Min., i. 495, 1836) may be the same compound. It is described as cleavable massive ; G. = 3-231 ; H.=6 \u2014 R'o ; color black: opaque; and is stated to come from a bed of magnetic iron ore at Hoboken, N. J., where no such bed of ore exists. Appendix. \u2014 10. Asbestus. Asbestus is a finely fibrous variety, with the fibres easily separable and usuaUy flexible. But most asbestus belongs to the species hornblende, which tends more to run into fibrous forms. It is difficult to distinguish the hornblende asbestus from the pyroxene, except by noting its association with known varieties of one or the other species ; and this method is not free from doubt. See further under Hobnblende for description, analyses, and localities of asbestus. 11. Breislakile (Brocchi, Cat. di una raccolta di Rocce, 28, 60, 70, 192, 1817; Cyclopeite, in Descl. Min., 65, 1862). Occurs in wool-like forms at Vesuvius and Capo-di-Bove. Its crystal lography identity with pyroxene has been shovvji by Chapman (PhU. Mag., xxxvii. 444, 1850). The particular variety of pyroxene to which it belongs has not been ascertained, as no analysis of it has been made. Named after Breislak, an Italian geologist. Lavroffitc (Lawrowit, Vanadin-Augit, Kokscharof, Bull. Ac. St. Pet., xi. 78, 1866) is an alumina pyroxene, colored green by vanadium, from the river Sludianka, beyond Lake Baikal, where it occurs coarse granular massive with quartz, and also in smaU imperfect crystals. Cleavage affords the prism 87\u00b0 7' ; and there is the usual lamination, from compound structure paraUel to O. The color is fine emerald-green. It contains besides sihca some alumina, iron, lime, mag nesia, and a trace of manganese and vanadium ; but no analysis has been made, so that its exact place among tho pyroxenes is not certain. I.

Jeffersonite gives with soda on charcoal a reaction for zinc and mangauese ; many others also give with the fluxes reactions for manganese. Most vari- eties are unacted upon by acids. Obs.\u2014 Pyroxene is a common mineral in crystaUine Umestone and dolomite, in serpentine, and in volcanic rocks ; and occurs also, but less abundantly, in connection with granitic rocks and metamorphic schists. The pyroxene of limestone is mostly the white and light green, or gray varieties ; that of most other metamorphic rocks, sometimes white or colorless, but usuaUy green of different shades, from pale green to greenish-black, and occasionaUy black ; that of serpentine is sometimes in fine crystals, but often of the foUated green land catted diallage; that of eruption rocks is the black to greenish-black augite."], [276, "220 oxygen compounds. In limestone the associates are often hornblende, scapolite, garnet, orthoclase, sphene. phlogo pite, and sometimes brown tourmaline, chlorite, talc, zircon, spinel, rutile, etc. ; aud in other metamorphic rocks mostly the same. In eruptive rocks the crystals are imbedded, and often occur with simUarly disseminated chrysolite, crystals of orthoclase, sanidin, labradorite, leucite, etc. Pyroxene is an essential constituent of many rocks. Pyroxenyte is a metamorphic rock consist ing mainly of compact pyroxene of the SahUte section. Lherzolyte, from the borders of Lake Lherz, in the department of Ariege in France (described by Charpentier and Dufrenoy as a variety of pyroxene), is a green pyroxenic rock. (For constitution, see under Spinel.) Pyroxene along with labradorite constitutes the dark gray and green to black eruptive rock caUed doleryte, which often contains also magnetic iron ore in grains ; and with labradorite and chrysolite, the related rock basalt. Doleritic and basaltic lavas have the same composition. With leucite it forms the leucitophyr, the common igneous rock of Vesuvius ; and with nephelin, nephelinyte or nephelin doleryte, another Italian igneous rock. The pyroxene of these igneous rocks is the black variety augite ; and it often occurs in distinct crystals of the forms iu figs. 203-206. Many kinds of tufa, and the earthy basaltic rock called wacke (either a variety of tufa or a decomposed basalt or doleryte) often consist largely of crystals or grains of augite. Diallage occurs generally iu serpentine or steatitic rocks. Many foreign localities of pyroxene have already been briefly indicated (pp. 214-219). The crystals of Ala in Piedmont are associated with garnets and talc in veins traversing serpentine ; and the more transparent are sometimes cut and worn as gems. In N. America, it occurs in Maine, at Raymond and Rumford, diopside, sahlite, etc. ; at Deer Isle, diaUage in serpentine. In Vermont, at Thetford, black augite, with chrysolite, in boulders of basalt. In Mass., in Berkshire, white crystals abundant; at the Bolton quarries, same, good; Westfield and Blanford, diallage in serp.

Alt. \u2014 Pyroxene undergoes alteration in different ways, as has been well explained by Bischof, and many species have been instituted on the material in different stages of change. In the simplest, there is only a taking up of water, producing a \" hydrous augite.\" The water found in several of the analyses already cited may be from this source. In many cases a loss of sUica appears to attend this hydration ; and often, also, a loss of one or more of the bases (of which the Ume and iron are the first to go), through the dissolving agency of waters holding carbonic acid, or carbonates, in solution. Thus may come the foUowing substances: 13. Htdbous Augite. Analyses 1, 2, 3 of an altered sahlite from Sala, Sweden, the three analyses made on different fragments of the same piece, by H. Rose. 14.

Rensselaerite is a variety of steatite (see Talc), having sometimes the cleavage of pyroxene. PyraUolit9 is also in part talc or steatite (anal. 5, 13, 14). Saponite and serpentint (q. v.) are other results of the same kind of alteration, they consisting, like talc, of sihca, magnesia, and water. Hortonile is a steatitic pseudomorph of pyroxene, found in Orange Co., N. Y., with chondrodite. The foUowing are other kinds of pseudomorphs : Hematite, Limonite, Magnetite, Palagonite (which see). In the pyroxenes containing much iron, especially the augitic varieties, the protoxyd of iron, when moisture and air are present, may pass to a higher state of oxydation, and the mineral take a red color (the color of anhydrous sesquioxyd of iron (hematite), or it may take up water as well as oxygen, and become of a brownish-yellow color, the color of the hydrous sesqui oxyd, or limonite. Magnetite is another result, and probably through the alteration of one of these oxyds as an intermediate state. Palagonite, as Bunsen has observed, is one of the products arising in part from the change of the iron to a sesquioxyd : it is the material of many tufas of volcanic regions, as those of Iceland and Etna, such tufas having been made from doleritic or basaltic lavas abounding iu pyroxene. Bunsen remarks that palagonite may be made artificially by putting powdered basalt into a large excess of caustic potash in fusion and pouring on water; the product, after washing, is hydrated, pulverulent, and gelatinizes with weak acids, and its composition is Uke that of the purest palagonite of Iceland. For analyses, see p. 483. Epidote is another mineral resulting from the kind of change here mentioned. In one variety of the diallage from the gabbro of Harzburg (see analyses of others on p. 219), A. Streng found (B. H. Ztg., xxni. 54) Si 45-73, Si 5-60, Pe 12-18, Pe 8-00, Mg 12-55, Ca 8-86, alkalies 0-55, A 4-68=98'15\u2014 a percentage of oxyd of iron and of water which indicates partial alteration. Cimolite. In the case of the aluminous pyroxene, when all the bases except the alumina are removed and water taken up, there may result cimolite (q. v.), a whitish clay-like earth, which has been observed constituting pseudomorphs of augite at BUin in Bohemia. In the change to this aluminous sUicate, alumina may possibly be added, to some extent, from an external source, as from feldspar decomposing in the same rock.

Thus the hydrous mineral glauconite (q. v.) or green earth may result as a constituent of some augite pseu domorphs ; or the essentially anhydrous mineral mica, which has been observed by Kjerulf as a pseudomorph after augite, in the Eiffel. Kjerulf gives the foUowing analyses (1) of an unaltered augite, and (2) the mica derived from it : Si Si Fe Mg Ca Na fi Ign. 1. Augite 50*21 694 7*59 13*66 19*85 0*33=98*58 2.

The removal of the mineral by the decomposing and dissolving agencies may be attended by the introduction of sttica from the waters present, these waters hav ing become siliceous as a consequence of the decompositions. Hence may come sUiceous pseudo morphs, either anhydrous Uke quartz, or hydrous like opal. One such from Vesuvius is described by Rammelsberg, which still contained some part of the bases, affording him on analysis (Pogg., lixx. 387): Si 85-31, Si 1-58, Pe 1-67, Sig 1-70, Ca 2'66, fl 5-47=98'42. In some cases the waters hold in solution carbonate of Ume instead of sttica, and this salt of Ume consequently takes the place of the removed mineral, and so calcite pseudomorphs after py roxene are produced. 22. Uealite. Augite also occurs altered to hornblende, and the product has been named uralite by Rose (Pogg., xx. 322, 1830, xxvii. 97, xxxi. 619).

Although much care was taken to use the pure mineral, the results seem to indicate an intimate mixture with some alumina silicate ; and possibly with lime-garnet or kyanite, which are its associates. If this be the case, the mineral may still be pyroxene or hornblende, as has been supposed. After an examination of the mineral, we regard with doubt the cleavage angle given by Breithaupt. Omphacite occurs near Hof in Baireut, Bavaria, at the localities mentioned above, and also at Pacher in Styria. It is intimately mixed with a lime-garnet, and also usuaUy with kyanite, mak ing the tough greenish rock, spotted with pale garnet, called eclogyte. The rock contains often scales of a silvery mica.

Schlieper found his specimen (one furnished by tho author and seemingly unaltered) to consist partly of carbonate of manganese and other bases. By digestion in concentrated muriatic acid, it afforded 90-15 per cent, ofstticate of manganese, and 985 soluble portion. The latter gave on analysis: Sin C 50-52 Pe C 8-60 Ca C 3717 Mg C 2-44 Hand loss 1-27 = 100. Ten p. c. of carbonates had been previously found in the Cummington mineral, by E. Hitch cock. AUowing that the ten p. c. of carbonates in Schliepers specimen had been formed at the expense of the bases in the rhodonite, and also that there was some free sUica in minute points or grains, as was obvious to the eye, the oxygen ratio cannot be taken as different from that of rhodonite. Hermann's Mangan-amphibol (1. c.) was based on an analysis of this Cummington mineral. Ruprecht, who published his first analysis osthe species in 1782, obtained Si 55-06, manganese 35-15, iron 7 -04, Si 1-56, water 0-78=99-59. Huot based his species Kapnikite on this old analysis. Brandes obtained for the Hydropite, a rose-colored ore from Kapnik, having G. = 2'8 (Schw. J., xxvi.) Si 53-50, Mn 4D93, Pe D00, Si 1-24, fl 3-00; it has been considered a tersUicate, with the formula Sin3 Si3; but it was probably an impure rhodonite. Pyr., etc. \u2014 B.B. blackens and fuses with slight intumescence at 2'5; with the fluxes gives re actions for manganese ; fowlerite gives with soda on charcoal a reaction for zinc.

Alt. \u2014 There are two prominent methods of alteration, which may act separately or together. (1) Through the strong tendency of the protoxyd of manganese to pass to a higher state of oxy dation ; in which process the red color changes to brown or black, commencing with the exterior, which becomes a black crust to the mass. Indefinite mixtures thus result, which may be either partly silicate, or wholly one or more oxyds of manganese. (2) Through the tendency ot the protoxyd of manganese and other protoxyds present to unite with carbonic acid afforded by alka line carbonated waters, this causing the sUicate to be penetrated with carbonate of manganese, and often also with carbonate of lime or iron. The color of the result after this latter method is usuaUy grayish-red to grayish-white, and sometimes brown. I. By Oxydation ; not Hydrated or Carbonated. A. Mabceline Berthier (Ann. Ch.

Lithia was first discovered in this mineral by Arfvedson. The name petalite is from utraUv, a leaf, and aUudes to the cleavage. On cryst. of castorite and petalite, see Descl, Ann Ch. Phys., IV. iii 264, 1864, and Pogg., cxxii. 648. Descloizeaux, who gives the above figure, points out the isomorphism with spodumene, and the fact that the O. ratio differs by a multiple of 2 for the sUica, it being 1:4: 10 for spodumene and 1 : 4 : 20 for petaUte. 245.

Obs. \u2014 Occurs in mica schist with hornblende and mica in thin and long plates and fibres near Kongsberg in Norway, and with gray cobalt near Modum. This species, originally instituted upon the Norwegian mineral analyzed by Gmelin and Vope lius, and regarded as distinct by many later authors, including Mohs, but united to hornblende by others, has recently been proved to be an independent species by Descloizeaux (Min., i. 75), whose optical examinations have shown that the crystals are orthorhombic instead of monoclinic. Only the mineral of the Norwegian localities above mentioned is at present here included, the so-called anthophyllite from Fiskenaes in Greenland (occurring with sapphirine), from Bavaria, Finland, and other Norwegian localities, besides the cummingtonite, of Cummington, Mass., being true hornblende in optical characters. Descloizeaux has later announced (C. R., lxn., 987) that some anthophyllite is monoclinic. The gedrite is from the vaUey of Heas, near Gedres, France, and contains microscopic black spinels (picotite).

R may correspond to two or more of the bases Mg, Ca, Pe, Mn, Na, K, fl; and fi to Si, Pe, or _i_n. Pe sometimes replaces silica, like Si. Rammelsberg made out the general conformity of amphibole to the pyroxene formula by discover ing that the iron in both species was often partly sesquioxyd (Pogg., ciii. 284, and Min. Ch., 468). Yet the analyses do not aU accord with this view, part giving the ratio 1 : 2$, unless the water is made basic. Much amphibole, especially the aluminous, contains some fluorine. The base lime is absent from some varieties, or nearly so. The name Amphibole, proposed by Haiiy, has the precedence, because Haiiy first rightly appre ciated the species, as he had done for pyroxene, aud gave it, and not any of its varieties, the name. In his Traite, in 1801, he brought together hornblende aud actinolite; aud by 18o9 he had added to the group the third prominent variety, tremolite ; while in all other works not taking their views from him, these three minerals still stood as distinct species. Asbesius was annexed to the series by Hausmann in 1813, though kept separate long afterward by many other authors. The varieties of amphibole are as numerous as those of pyroxene, and for the same reasons ; and they lead in general to similar subdivisions. I. CONTAINING LITTLE OE NO ALUMINA. 1.

Sometimes transparent and colorless. Contains magnesia and lime with little or no iron ; formula (Ca Mg) Si. Named Tremolite by Pini, from the locality at Tremola in Switzerland. Grammatite (from yoauim, a line) alludes to a line in the direction of the longer diagonal seen by Haiiy on transverse sections of some crystals. It was substituted for tremottte by Hauy, without reason, and is a very bad substitute. Nordenskidldite, from Ruscula, near Lake Onega, is tremolite (Kenngott and v. Hauer, 1. c). RaphUite, from Lanark in Canada, is tremolite in its grayish-white or but shghtly greenish color, and its low specific gravity (G.=2-85, Thomson; 2-845, Hunt). But both Hunt's and Thomson's analyses give over 5-30 p. c. of protoxyd of iron. In a letter to the author (dated Sept. 21, 1864) Hunt states that he obtained in one of his trials, from material which he had purified from mixed CaC, only 3-15 of protoxyd of iron, with Ca 12-05 and Si 57-20 ; and he adds that he regards this as nearer the true composition of the mineral. 1 a.

Named from a supposed efficacy in diseases of the kidney, from w^p-s, kidney. It occurs usually associ- ated with talcose or magnesian rocks. Nephrite or jade was brought in the form of carved ornaments from Mexico or Peru soon after the discovery of America. Del Rio, in his Mexican Mineralogy (1795), mentions no Mexican lo- cality. A simUar stone comes from China and New Zealand. A nephrite-like mineral, called bowenite, from Smithfield, R. I., having the hardness 5-5, is serpentine in composition. The jade of de Saussure is tho saussurite (see under Zoisite) of the younger de Saussure, eariier named leman- ite by Delametherie. Another aluminous jade has been called jadeite (q. V.) by Damour. The Easton mineral is a mixture, and has been named pseudonephrite (q. v.). 2 Magnesia-Lime-Iron Amphibole; Actinolite (Stralskorl pt. Cronst, 1. c. Strahlstein Germ.

Contains magnesia and Ume, with some protoxyd of iron, but seldom more than 6 p. c. ; formula (Ca, Mg, Fe) Si. The variety in long bright-green crystals is catted glassy actinolite ; the crystals break easily across the prism. The fibrous aud radiated kinds are often called asbesiiform actinolite and radiated actinolite. Actinolite owes its green color to the iron present. Named actinohte from 'nin., a ray, and Xi-\u00bb;, stone, as translation of the German strahlstein or radiated stone. Name changed to actinote by Haiiy, without reason. Tremolite graduates into actinolite through an increase in the proportion of iron, though generaUy easily distinguishable by its color. Asbestus has usuaUy a grayish-white or greenish-white color, although actinolite in the proportion of iron ; and the raphilite (see preceding page) appears to shade into actinolite in composition. TremoUte does not differ in color from the aluminous variety, edenite, from EdenviUe, N. Y. (p. 235). 3. Magnesia-Iron Amphibole ; Antholite (Anthophyllite pt. (p. 231). AnthoUth pt.

A variety from Paisberg is here included (anal. 34), described by Igelstrom, and affording the formula (Mg, Sin, Ca, K, Na) Si, and con taining 8 to 9 p. c. of alkali, which may possibly be a result of alteration. / A 1= 124\u00b0; color pale-yellowish to brown. Igelstrom considers the richterite of Breithaupt (B. H. Ztg., xxiv. 364, 1865) the same mineral, as it has the same general aspect and simUar composition, excepting half less manganese ; Breithaupt describes it as occurring in acicular crystals, affording the prismatic angle 133\u00b0 38' (which is within a of I A i-i of pyroxene) ; with G. = 2-826 ; color isabetta-yellow, rarely pale yellowish-brown ; B.B. very fusible. It resembles the kokscharoffite from L. Baikal, though unlike it in composition (p. 242). 5. Iron-Magnesia Amphibole; CcmmingtO-T-TE (Dewey, Am. J. Sci., viii. 59, 1824. Anthophyl lite pt.

Tremolite, actinolite, and other varieties of amphibole, excepting those containing much alumina, pass into fibrous varieties, the fibres of which are sometimes very long, fine, flexible, and eastty separable by the fingers, and look Uke flax. These kinds, like the corresponding of pyroxene, are caUed asbestus (fr. the Greek for incombustible.) Pliny supposed it a vegetable product, although good for making incombustible cloth, as he states. The amianthus of the Greeks and Latins was the same thing ; the word meaning undefiled, and aUuding to the ease of cleaning the cloth by throwing it into the fire. The colors vary from white to green and wood-brown. The name amianthus is now applied usuaUy to the finer and more sttky kinds. Much that is so called is chrysolite, or fibrous serpen tine, it containing 12 to 14 p. c. of water. Mountain leather is a kind in thin flexible sheets, made of interlaced fibres ; and mountain cork (bergkork) the same in thicker pieces ; both are so light as to float on water, and they are often hydrous. Mountain wood (Bergholz, Holzasbest, Germ.) is compact fibrous, and gray to brown in color, looking a Uttle like dry wood. Byssoliie (Amianthoid, asbestoid) fr. Bourg d'Oisans in Dauphiny, is of an olive-green color,"], [291, "235 BISILICATES. coarse and stiff fibrous, and has G. = 30 ; it is a fibrous variety of the iron-manganese amphibole, according to VauqueUn & Macquart (1. c). It occurs associated with a black oxyd of manganese! II. Aluminous. 9. Aluminous Magnesia-Lime Amphibole. (a) Edenite. (Edenit Breith., Handb., 558, 1847).

Named from the locality at Edenvttle, N. Y. To this variety belong various pale-colored amphiboles, having less than five p. c. of oxyds of iron. Breithaupt makes the edenite triclinic in B. H. Ztg., xxiv. 428, and he says that this is confirmed by Dauber. On an examination of crystals, the author sees no reason for adopting this conclusion. (.) Smaragdite Saussure (Voy. Alpes, iv. \u00a7 1313, 1362, 1796. DiaUage verte pt. H., 1801 ; Green Diallage pt. Diallagon UUmann, Tab., 90, 1814). A thin-foliated variety, of a Ught grass-green color, resembling much common green diallage. According to Boulanger it is an aluminous mag nesia-lime amphibole, containing less than 3| p. c. of protoxyd of iron, and is hence related to edenite and the Ught green Pargas mineral. Descloizeaux observes (Min., i. 90) that it has the cleavage, and apparently the optical characters, of amphibole. H. = 5; G. = 3, Vauq. ; 3-10, Bou langer. It forms, along with whitish or greenish saussurrite, a rock. The original mineral is from Corsica, and the rock is the corsilyte of Pinkerton, and the verde di Corsica duro of the arts. A similar smaragdite from Bacher consists, according to Haidinger, of alternate lamin\u00e6 of am phibole and pyroxene in twin composition. The euphotide of the Alps resembles corsilyte in containing a smaragdite-like mineral (green di allage). But Hunt states that the mineral has the cleavage of pyroxene, which our own examina tions have not succeeded in confirming. 10. Aluminous Magnesia-Lime-Iron Amphibole. (a) Pargasite; (6) Hornblende.

I A 1=1 24\u00b0 1'\u2014 124\u00b0 25'; G.=305\u2014 3-47. Pargasite is usually made to include green and bluish-green kinds, occurring in stout lustrous crystals, or granular; aud hornblende the greenish-black and black kinds, whether in stout crystals or long bladed, columnar, fibrous, or massive granular. But no line can be drawn between them. Pargasite occurs at Pargas, Finland, in bluish-green and grayish-black crystals. Optical characters iu general the same as for tremolite and actinolite (p. 233). But in one black crystal of hornblende (fr. BUin ?) Descloizeaux found one bisectrix to be parallel to the plane i-i, and the other normal to it. Again, in the bluish or black pargasite, from Pargas, the bisectrix is inclined 32\u00b0 58' to a normal to O, and 108\u00b0 to a normal to i-i ; and double refraction is positive. Descloiseaux observes that these distinctions are not sufficient to warrant the separation of these minerals. (a) Diastatite is a black hornblende from Nordmark in Wermland, stated by Breithaupt to have 7a7=120\u00b0 20', and G.=308\u2014 311. (b) Syntagmatite is the Vesuvius black hornblende, analyzed by Rammelsberg (No. 29), in which he found I A 7=124\u00b0 8', G.=3'272. (c) According to Breithaupt, I A I in two hornblendes from Greenland is 123\u00b0 59' and 124\u00b0 0', with G.=3-462 and 3383; two from Arendal in Norway, 124\u00b0 and 124\u00b0 If, with G=3-301 and 3-229; one from Persberg in Sweden, 124\u00b0, with G. = 3818; two from Schmalzgrube, near Marienberg in Saxony, 124\u00b0 5' and 124\u00b0 IT, with G.=3-333 and 3'290; one from Rhonsberg in Bohemia, 124\u00b0 6', with G. = 3'352. The preceding are of Breithaupt's Amphibolus ferrosus. For a basaltic hornblende, from Wetterau or Bilin (A. basalticus Br.) analyzed by Bonsdorff and Struve(AnaL 17, 21), Breithaupt gives I A 1= 124\u00b0 39' 38\", audG.=3 17 \u2014 325 ; for one^ from the zircon-syenite of Laurvig and Fredriksvarn in Norway (A. saxosus Br.)

Diastalite of Breithaupt (A. diastaticus), in its angle 7A7=120\u00b0 20', if this be not an accidental irregularity, diverges widely from true hornblende.

Breithaupt also observes that his A. medius (see above) has unequal cleavages, and is probably related to the waUerianite. The grayish to colorless hornblende from Edenvitte, called by him Edenite (see p. 235), he also refers to his genus Hemiprismatiies. 11. Aluminous Iron-Lime Amphibole ; Noralite Dana.

An actinolite rock from St. Francis, Canada, afforded T. S. Hunt (Rep. G. Can., 1863, 466) Si 52-30, Si 1-30, Mg 21-50, Ca 15-00, Fe 6-75, Ni tr., ign. 3-10=99-95.

The analysis by Thomson (Ann. Lye. N. H. N. York, iii. 50), referred by Shepard to boltonite, is shown by B. Silliman, Jr. (Am. J. Sci., H. viii. 391), to pertain probably to an actinolite from Bolton. The fluorine in many hornblendes is supposed to exist as fluorid of calcium, and this ingredient, according to Bonsdorff, may constitute 1 part in 5 of the mineral. Pyr., etc. \u2014 The observations under pyroxene apply also to this species, it being impossible to distinguish the varieties by blowpipe characters alone. Isomorphous and Dimorphous relations to Pyroxene.\u2014 The analogy iu composition between pyr oxene and hornblende has been abundantly illustrated. They have the same general formula ; and under this formula there is but one difference of any importance, viz., that lime is a prominent ingredient in all the varieties of pyroxene, whUe it is wanting, or nearly so, in some of those of hornblende. The analogy between the two species in crystallization, or their essential isomorphism, was pointed out by G. Rose in 1831, who showed that the forms of both were referrible to one and the same fundamental form. The prism 7 of hornblende corresponds in angle to i-2 of pyroxene ; that is, if the horizontal axes of the latter species be b : c, those of the former wttl be b : 2c. Calculating from the angle 7A 7in pyroxene, 87\u00b0 5', the angle of i-2 is precisely 124\u00b0 30', or the angle 7 A 7 in hornblende. The annexed table ex hibits the symbols of the planes in hornblende as they would be on the augite type. But whUe thus isomorphous in axial relations or form, they are also dimorphous. For (1) the cleavage in pyroxene is parallel to the prism of 87\u00b0 5', and in hornblende to that of 124\u00a7-\u00b0. (2) The occur ring secondary planes of the latter are in general diverse from those of the former, so that the crystals differ strikingly in habit or system of modifications. Moreover, in pyroxene columnar and fine fibrous forms are uncommon ; in hornblende, exceedingly common. (3) The several chemical compounds under pyroxene have one-tenth higher specific gravity than the corresponding ones under hornblende ; that is, a compound (as, for example, (-J- Ca + 4. Mg)3 Si2) having G.=3'2S under the former, has approximately, G.=2'95 under the latter. Again, twins occur composed part of amphibole and part of pyr oxene, a fact bearing on the isomorphism and dimorphism of the species. Obs. \u2014 Amphibole occurs in many crystalline Umestones, and metamorphic granitic and schis tose rocks, and sparingly in serpentine, and volcanic or igneous rocks. Tremolite, the magnesia lime variety, is especiaUy common in limestones, particularly magnesian or dolomitic; actinolite, the magnesia-lime-iron variety, in steatitic rocks ; and brown, dark-green, and black hornblende, in chlorite schist, mica schist, gneiss, and in various other rocks of which it forms a constituent part. Asbestus is often found in connection with serpentine. Hornblende-rock, or amphibolyte, consists of massive hornblende of a dark greenish-black or black color, and has a granular texture. Occasionally the green hornblende, or actinolite, occurs in rock-masses, as at St. Francis, in Canada. Hornblende-schist has the same composition as amphibolyte, but is schistose or slaty in struc ture. It often contains a Uttle feldspar. In some varieties of it the hornblende is in part iu minute needles. Diabase is a fine-grained, compact hornblende-rock, tough and heavy. Aphanyte (or corneine) is hke diabase, but is without distinct grains (whence the name, from dfapiis, unmanifest), and breaks with a smooth flint-like fracture. Syenite is a granite-like rock, containing hornblende along with quartz and orthoclase feldspar. Dioryte is a similar rock, grayish-white to nearly black in color, consisting of hornblende and albite. Hornblendic or syenitic gneiss has the same constitution as syenite, but differs in having a gneissoid or semischistose structure. Hornblendic granite contains hornblende in addition to the ordinary constituents of granite, quartz, feldspar, and mica. Gneiss and mica schist are often hornblendic in the same way. The hornblende in mica schist is usually in prisms, either stout or acicular, which sometimes are aggregated in sheaf-like tufts. The fasciculite of Hitchcock is merely this tufted hornblende. The dark-green antique porphyry contains hornblende in its compact, diabase-like mass, and is therefore called diabase-porphyry. G.=2'9\u2014 3'0."], [297, "241 BISILICATES. Hornblende is often disseminated in black prismatic crystals through trachyte, and also through other igneous rocks, especially the feldspathic kinds. Euphotide consists of a whitish or greenish compact base of varying constitution, with imbedded smaragdite. The euphotide of Corsica has been called corsilyte (p. 235). The saussurite, as shown by Hunt (Am. J. Sei, xxviU. 336), is either compact lime-epidote, as that of the Alps, compact meionite, as that of Mt. Genevre, or compact feldsjyar ; these different kinds being distinguishable by their specific gravity. The compact tremo_rte catted nephrite is found in talcose rock or schist, and granular limestone. Aussig and Teplitz in Bohemia, Tunaberg in Sweden, and Pargas in Finland, afford fine speci mens of the dark -colored hornblendes. Actinolite occurs at Saltzburg and Greiner in the ZiUerthal ; tremolite at St. Gothard, in granular limestone or dolomite, the Tyrol, the Bannat, Gulsjo in Sweden, eta Catamite occurs at Normarken in Sweden, in prisms in serpentine. Asbestus is found in Savoy, Saltzburg, the Tyrol ; also in the island of Corsica, where it is so abundant that Dolomieu employed it in packing his minerals. Rock cork is obtained in Saxony, Portsoy, and Leadhttls. where also mountain leather occurs. Oisans, iu France, affords a variety of amianthus, composed of fibres having some dogree of elasticity ; it is the amianthoide of Haiiy. In tho United States, in Maine, black crystals occur at Thomaston, at Moultenboro in syenite ; pargasite at Phipsburg and Parsonsfield ; radiated or asbestiform actinolite at Unity ; tremolite at Thomaston and Raymond. In N. Hamp., black crystals at Franconia. In Vermont, glassy and ra diated actinolite in the steatite quarries of Windham, Readsboro', and New Fane. In Mass., white crystals at Lee (Ij m. S.W. osthe meeting-house), and at Newberg; glassy and radiated actinolite at Middlefield and Blanford ; radiated actinolite at Carlisle, Pelham, Windsor, Lee, and Great Bar rington ; black crystals at Chester ; asbestus at Brighton, Sheffield, Pelham, Newbury, Dedham ; cummingtonite at Cummington and Plainfield. In Conn., in large flattened white crystals and in bladed and fibrous forms (tremolite) in dolomite, Canaan, between the Falls and the post-office, and also at other places hi Litchfield Co.; asbestus at West Farms, Winchester, and Wilton, and with mountain leather formerly at the Milford serpentine quarries. In N. York, in good black crystals at Willsboro', presenting interesting forms ; also near the bridge at Potsdam, St. Lawrence Co.; near Greenwood Furnace, and -iu Warwick, Orange Co. (f. 229); dark green crystals near Two Ponds, and also 1 m. N., 2| m. N., and 1 m. S., of Edenville, together with gray or hair-brown crystals and tremolite, sphene, and chondrodite, in granular limestone ; of various forms and colors, aud often in large and perfect crystals, near Amity; iu dark green crystals, with ilmenite, at the Stirling mines, Orange Co. ; in short green crystals at Gouverneur, sometimes 2 or 3 in. in diameter, along with apatite ; iu Rossie, 2 m. N. of Oxbow, the variety pargasite in neat bright green crystals ; glassy and radiated actinolite near a hamlet called Pecksville, in FishkiU ; radiated at Brown's serpentine quarry, 3 m. N.W. of Carmel Putnam Co. ; in large white crystals at Diana, Lewis Co. ; radiated and bladed tremolite at Dover, Kings bridge, the Eastchester quarries, Hastings, and near Yonkers, in Westchester Co. ; at Knapp'3 quarry, Patterson, in Putnam Co., and ou the banks of Yellow lake and elsewhere in St. Lawrenco Co. ; asbestus, near Greenwood Furnace ; Rogers's farm in Patterson ; Colton rock and Hustis's farm in Phillipstown, Putnam Co. ; near the Quarantine in Richmond Co., where the fibres are two to three feet long. In N. Jersey, tremolite or gray amphibole in good crystals at Bryam, and other varieties of the species at Franklin and Newton ; radiated actinolite at Franklin ; tremolite at Franklin ; asbestus and mountain leather at Brunswick. In Penn., actinolite in Providence, at Mineral HiU, in Delaware Co. ; at Unionville ; at Keunctt, Chester Co., often in fine crystals ; tremolite with asbestus at Chestnut HU1 near the Wissahiccon, near PhUadelphia, at London Grove, Chester Co. ; nephrite at Easton. In Maryland, actinolite and asbestus at the Bare Hills in serpentine ; asbestus at Cooptown. In Virginia, actinottte at Willis's Mt., in Buckingham Co. ; asbestus at Barnet's MiUs, Fauquier Co. Alt \u2014 The alterations of amphibole are simUar to those of pyroxene (see page 220). The fibrous and diallage-like varieties are especially liable lo take up water, owiug to the finely or thiuly divided state osthe mineral. Talc, steatite, serpentine, chlorite, biolite, pinite, chabasite, limonite, magnetite, iron ochre, are among the reported results of alteration. At Ilmenau, a magnesia-mica, a chlorite, and also (as an after product from the chlorite) iron ochre, occur as pseudomorphs after hornblende (v. Fritsch, ZS. GeoL Ges., xii. 104). Groppite, and perhaps rosite, as suggested to the author by L. S\u00e6mann (4th edit., p. 287), may be altered pargasite. Genth describes the asbestiform or fibrous serpentine of Texas aud Providence, Pa., and the baltimoriie as altered asbestus, aud a chrysolite of Delaware Co., Pa., as altered actinolite (Am. J.

The hydrous anthophyllite of New York Island occurs in place near the corner of 59th street and 10th avenue, and also in many places in boulders. The variations in the analyses, as well as in the aspect of the material, show that it is a result of the alteration of an asbestiform tremolite. 247A. Waldheimtte.

It is to be observed that the excess of silica occurs along with an unusual proportion of alkali. 247B. Kokscharoffite. (Kokscharowit N. Nordenskiold, BuU. Soc. Nat. Moscow, xxx. 223, 1857.)

The varieties of beryl depending on color are of importance in the arts, when the crystals are transparent enough to be of value as gems. The principal kinds are : (a) colorless ; (b) bluish-green, called aquamarine, a name sug gested, though not used, by Pliny, where he says of it, \" qui viriditatem puri maris imitantur ;\" (c) apple-green ; (d) greenish-yeUow to iron-yellow and honey-yellow (apparently chrysoberyllus of Pliny and aucient jewelry) ; (e) pale yello wish-greeu (probably the chrysoprasius Plin., and perhaps his chrysolithus in part, as also in more modern times) ; (/) clear sapphire-blue (hyacinthozontes of Plin.) ; (g) pale sky-blue (aeroides Plin.) ; (h) the pale violet or reddish (amethiste basaltine Sage, Min., 231); (i) the opaque brownish-yellow, of waxy or greasy lustre. The above names by PUny are mentioned in his account of beryl. The oriental emerald of jewelry is emerald-colored sapphire. Davidsonite is nothing but greenish-yeUow beryl from near Aberdeen ; and goshenite i3 a colorless or white variety from Goshen, Mass. (anal. 16).

Glass with borax, clear and colorless for beryl, a fine green for emerald. Slowly soluble with salt of phosphorus without leaving a sUiceous skeleton. A yeUowish variety from Broddbo and Finbo yields with soda traces of tin. Unacted upon by acids. According to Lewy, the emerald of Muso becomes white at a red heat, and loses, as a mean result, 166 of water and 012 of organic matter, the latter consisting of 0-03 to 0-05 of hydrogen and 0-09 to 0-06 of carbon. Obs.\u2014 Emeralds occur in clay slate, in isolated crystals or in nests (not in veins), near Muso, etc., 75 m. N.N.E. of Bogota, N. Granada, a rock containing Cretaceous fossUs in its limestone* concretions. A perfect hexagonal crystal from this locality, 2 in. long, is in the cabinet of the Duke of Devonshire ; it measures across its three diameters 21 in., 2\\ in., I\\ in., and weighs 8 oz. 18 dwts. ; owing to flaws, it is but partially fit for jewelry. Emeralds of less beauty, but much larger, occur in Siberia, on the river Tokowoia, N. of Katherinenberg, along with phenacite, chrysoberyl, apatite, rutile, etc., imbedded in mica schist. Ono specimen iu the Royal collection measures 144. in. long and 12 broad, and weighs 16J lbs. troy; another is 7 in. long aud 4 broad, and weighs 6 lbs. troy. Mount Zalora, in Upper Egypt, affords a less distinct variety, and was the only locaUty which was known to the ancients. Occurs about Heubachthal in Salzburg, in mica schist. Transparent beryls are found in Siberia, Hindostan, and BrazU. In Siberia they occur at the emerald mine mentioned, at Mursinka and Schaitanka, near Katherinenberg; near Miask with topaz ; iu the mountains of Adun-Tschilon with topaz, and elsewhere ; in Hindostan at Canjar gum; and in Brazil ou Rio San Matteo. Some Siberian transparent crystals exceed a foot in length. The most splendid aquamarine of which we have any account belongs to Don Pedro, and is from Brazil; it approaches in size, and also form, the head of a calf, and exhibits a crystalline structure only on one side; the rest is water-worn; and it weighs 225 oz. troy, or more than 184 lbs \u2022 the specimen is transparent and without a flaw. Beautiful crystals also occur at Elba ; the tin mines of Ehrenfriedersdorf in Saxonv, and of Schlackenwald in Bohemia. Other localises are, the Mourne Mts., Ireland, Co. of Down; also Killiney near Dublin; yellowish-green at Rubislaw, near Aberdeen, Scotland (davidsonite), and elsewhere in Aberdeenshire ; in small bluish crystals at St. Michael's Mount in Corn watt ; Limoges in France; Finbo and Broddbo in isweden; Tamela * Lewy found the Umestone to consist of Ca 0 47-8, Mg C 16-7, Mn C 0-5, Si 24-4, Si 55, Be 05, Pe 2-6, pyrite 0'6, alkali 2-7=101-2."], [304, "248 OXYGEN COMPOUNDS. and Somero in Finland ; Fossum in Norway ; Pfitscher-Joch, Tyrol ; Bodenmais and Rabenstein in Bavaria ; in Austraha, and elsewhere. Beryls of gigantic dimensions have been found in the United States, in N. Hamp., at Acworth and Grafton, and in Mast., at Royalston ; but they are mostly poor in quality. One beryl from Grafton weighs 2,900 lbs.; it is 32 in. through in one direction and 22 in another transverse, and is 4 f. 3 in. long. Another crystal from this locality, according to Prof. Hu -bard, measures 45 in. by 24 in its diameters, and a single foot in length by calculation weighs 1,076 lbs., making it in aU nearly 2-J- tons. At Royalston, one crystal exceeded a foot in length ; the smaUer crystals are often Umpid, and a yellowish variety forms a gem resembling chrysoUte ; the colors are mostly aquamarine, grass-green, and yellowish-green ; one locality is in the southeast part of Royalston, near the school-house, on the land of Mr. Clarke ; the best crystals are imbedded in quartz ; a still better is situated 4 m. beyond the old one in South Royalston ; some crystals of a sky-blue color in white quartz are beautifuL Other localities are in Maine, at Albany ; at Norway ; Bethel ; Hebron ; in Paris, large, with black tourmaline and mica; at Bowdoinham and Topham, pale green or yellowish white, in veins of graphic granite ; at Georgetown, Parker's island, mouth of Kennebec In N. Hamp., at Wilmot ; at Compton, as good as at Royalston. In Mass., at Barre, excellent specimens ; at Pearl HiU in Fitchburg, at Goshen (goshenite), and at Chesterfield. In Conn., at Haddam, ina feldspar vein in gneiss, on the east side of the river, the crystals having the terminations for a twelfth of an inch transparent (fig. 231, the dotted line indicating the limit of the transparent por tion) ; also at the chrysoberyl locattty ; the Middletown feldspar quarry ; in Chatham, uear the cobalt mine, in granite ; at Monroe, in a granite vein, the crystals often consisting of displaced pieces separated by quartz (fig. 233) ; at Madison, in beautiful crystals. In Penn., at LeiperviUe and Chester, crystals sometimes 10 to 12 in. long and 1+ in diameter, with black tourmaline; at Mineral HilL Kokscharof obtained from Ural beryls for the angle 0 A I, 150\u00b0 3' 24\". The species d',optase and pyrosmalite are homoeomorphous with beryl, and have the same oxygen ratio between the bases and sUica, if the water and chlorine be excluded. Alt. \u2014 KaoUn, mica, limonite, and quartz, occur as pseudomorphs after beryl, the last two by substitution, the others by alteration. The change to kaoUu is the same essentiaUy as in feldspar.

In the preceding table the column of ratios contains the oxygen ratios for the protoxyds and silica or the deutoxyds aud silica, where no sesquioxyd bases are present, as in the first, second, and third groups, and species 282 ; for the protoxyds, sesquioxyds, and silica, where the bases include elements in each of these three states, as in all the other groups. In species 285, the ratio is for the prot oxyds, sesquioxyds, tritoxyds, and silica. The letter r (species 2u8, 287, 293, etc.) signifies oxygen ratio between the bases and silica. This ratio is stated only when the silica is in excess above that of the unisilicate type, and it ex hibits the amount of that excess. Q is used in the second column of formulas for any accessory constituents not sihca ; its value in each case may be derived from the part of the corresponding"], [310, "254 OXYGEN COMPOUNDS. formula in the 6rst column which is in brackets. In species 265 it stands for (Pe, Mn)6b in 284B, for Pefl ; and so on. Examples of an excess of silica occur in many of the above groups ; namely, the Chrysolite group, in leucophanite ; Phenacite group, in mehphanite ; the Epidote group, in jadeite and per haps in saussurite ; the Iolite group ; the Mica group, in muscovite, lepidolite, and cryophylhte ; Scapolite group, in wcrnerite, ekebergite, mizzonite, dipyre, marialite ; Nephelite group ; Leucite group, in leucite ; Feldspar group, in all the species excepting anorthite. It has been shown that this excess of silica is often connected directly with the alkaline nature osthe base, and increases with increased alkalinity, as if the former were determined by the latter. The following are the ratios between the non-alkaline and alkaline portions of the base in the above mentioned groups, as decided from the mean of the analyses, together with the ratios for the bases and sihca : Bases Silica Non-alk.

In each of the groups in this table the increase in the proportion of silica is accompanied with an increase in the proportion of alkalies. Iolite is an exception, as it contains, according to the analyses hitherto made, no alkalies. Sphenoclase (No. 275) is another, but the mineral is uncrys tallized, and it is too little known to be considered in this connection. The two formulas a and b, for the species containing this excess of silica, are those explained on page 204, the first making the excess accessory silica, the second making half of the excess basic.

Obs. \u2014 A common constituent of some eruptive rocks; and also occurring in or among meta morphic rocks, with talcose schist, hypersthene rocks, and serpentine; or as a rock formation; also a constituent of many meteorites. The eruptive rocks, basalt and basaltic lava, consist of chrysolite (the variety olivine), along with labradorite or other feldspar, and augite. Though usually in grains, it is sometimes in rectangular masses several inches thick. A chrysolite rock occurring at L. Lherz, consisting largely of chrysolite, has been called Lherzolyte (See p. 147, under Spinel). The dunyte of F. v. Hochstetter (ZS. G. Ges., xvi. 341 ) is the same rock, according to Sandberger. The latter has a grayish-green color, and greasy and vitreous lustre, with G.=3-295, and occurs with serpentine rock in Dun Mtn., near Nelson in New Zealand. Another similar rock from Moravia, called picryte, consists half of chrysolite, along with feldspar, diallage, hornblende, and magnetite. Another from Norway (called OlivinfeU in German, or olivine rock) has very nearly the composition of pure chrysolite (anal 9); G. = 324\u2014 332, Kjerulf (1. a); granu lar in texture ; of olive to bottle-green color ; it contains some talc, tremolite, and bronzite. Occurs in eruptive rocks at Vesuvius, Sicily, Hecla, Sandwich Islands, and most volcanic isl ands or regions ; at Expailly in Auvergne ; at Unkel, on the Rhine, crystals several inches long ; at Kapfenstein in Lower Styria, in spheroidal masses ; at Sasbach and Ihringen in Kaiser stuhl, Switz. ; near Freiburg, Baden, in dolerite, a variety containing much iron (hyalosider ite); in Thetford and Norwich, Vermont, in boulders of coarsely cryst. basalt, the crystals or masses several inches through ; in dolerite or basalt in Canada, near Montreal, at Rougemont aud Mounts Royal and MontarviUe (anal.' 26).

Most of the crystals are fragile, and therefore unfit for use as gems. Named from *p\u00bb<\"., gold, and SiB ;.. The hyalosiderite, from '__Aos, glass, and alSnous, iron. The Chrysoliihus of Pliny was probably our topaz ; and his topaz our chrysolite. But Pliny's statement that \" topazos \" is the largest of all the precious stones, and that a statue 4 cubits high was made of it, shows that he confounded together different stones, since solid chrysolite crystals are never as large as some topaz crystals, and two inches is an extraordinary magnitude. The hardness mentioned, that it yields to the action of the file and wears with use, is right, and seems to prove that true chrysolite was included under the name of topazion. It came from an island in the Red Sea, and was very highly valued. It is stated by Diodorus Siculus to have resembled glass, but to have had a remarkable golden appearance, especially conspicuous at night (King). Alt. \u2014 Alteration of chrysolite often takes place through tho oxydation of the iron; the mineral becomes brownish or reddish-brown and iridescent It also splits into thin lamin\u00e6 as the change goes on, sometimes so as to resemble a mica. A basalt thus changed was once pointed out to the author as a mica slate, although no further change had taken place than that here mentioned. Chusite, Limbilite, and Sideroclepte of Saussure (J. de Phys., 341, i794), all from Limburg in Brisgau, are chrysolite more or less altered. The process may end in leaving the cavity of the crystal filled with hmonite or red oxyd of iron. Under the action of carbonated waters, the iron is often carried off instead of being peroxy dized, and also some of the magnesia is removed at the same time ; and thus may come serpen tine, picrosmine, which often retain the crystalline form of chrysolite. A further change may produce steatite and other magnesian species. For analyses of altered chrysolite see Walmstedt, in Ak. H Stockh., 1824, and Ramm. Min. Ch., 441; Rhodius in Ann. Ch.

One of three agreeing analyses afforded Erdmann (1. c): Si Si Fe Mn Mg Ca 29-16 1-56 55-87 8 47 3-23 2-29=100-58. It gives the formula, 6 Fe2 Si + 1 Sin2 Si+(Slg, Ca)2 Si, Rammelsberg. It occurs in a gneissoid rock called Eulysyte, consisting in part of augite and garnet, at Tunaberg in Swoden. A furnace-product, which is a lime-iron-manganese chrysolite, has been observed in clove-brown crystals at an iron-furnace in Easton, Pa. An analysis afforded Dr. C. T. Jackson (Am. J.

Comp., Var. \u2014 Garnet is a unisilicate, of resquioxyd and protoxyd bases, having the general formula (\\ R3 + \\ K)2 Si', or (R3)2 Si3+fi2Si 3. The name is from the Latin granatus, meaning like a grain, and directly from pomegranate, the seeds of which fruit are small, numerous, and red, in allusion to the aspect of the crystals. There are three promiuent groups, based on the nature of the predominating sesquioxyd. I. AlumI-IAGARNET, in which the sesquioxyd is mainly alumina(M). II. Ieongarnet, in which it is largely sesquioxyd of iron (Pe), usuaUy with some alumina."], [322, "266 OXYGEN COMPOUNDS. IH. ChrO-iegarnet, in which it is largely sesquioxyd of chromium (<__). The protoxyd bases present, either singly or two or more together, are lime (Ca), magnesia (Mg), protoxyd of iron (Fe), protoxyd of manganese (Mn), with rarely a few p. c. of protoxyd (?) of chromium, protoxyd of nickel, or yttria, or a trace of au alkali. Subdivisions of the above groups have been based on the predominance of one or another of these protoxyds ; and on this ground there are the foUowing varieties or subspecies : A. Grossuxarite, or Lime-Aluminagamet B. Pyrope, or Magnesia-Alnminagarnel. C. Almandite, or Iron-Aluminagarnet D. Spessartite, or Manganese-Aluminagarnet E.

OUVAROVITE, or Lime- Chromegarnel. Excepting the last, these subdivisions blend with one another more or less completely through varieties containing combinations of the protoxyd bases, aud also of the sesquioxyd bases. The foUowing are their characters. Most of the various names enumerated below under each division, making the synonymy, have stood for a time as names of supposed distinct species. A.

The included kinds vary so widely in color and other respects that no one of the names in use wiU serve for the group."], [325, "269 UNI8ILICATES. Chemically there are the following subvarieties : 1. Simple Lime Irongarnet. in which the pro toxyds are whoUy or almost whoUy lime. Includes : (a) Topazolite, having the color and trans parency of topaz, and also sometimes green ; although resembUng essonite, Damour has shown that it belongs here. (6) Colophonite, a coarse granular kind, brownish-yeUow to dark reddish brown in color, resinous in lustre, and usually with iridescent hues ; named after the resin colophony. (c) Melanite (named from /kA_s, black), black, either dull or lustrous ; but aU black garnet is not here included. Pyreneite is grayish-black melanite ; the original afforded VauqueUn 4 p. c. of water, and was iridescent, indicating incipient alteration, (d) Dark green garnet, not distinguishable from some aUochroite, except by chemical trials. Jelletite is green garnet, light or dark, and yel lowish-green, from the moraine of the Findel glacier near Zermatt, Mt. Rosa ; named after JeUet, one of the describers of it. Calderite, a mineral from Nepaul, India, is said to be nothing but massive garnet ; but whether belonging to this group or not is not stated. 2. Manganesian Lime-Irongarnet. (a) Rothoffite. The original aUochroite was a manganesian irongarnet of brown or reddish-brown color, and of fine-grained massive structure. The Roth offite, from Longban, first analyzed by Rothoff, is similar, with the color yeUowish-brown to liver-brown. Other common kinds of manganesian irongarnet are light and dark, dusky green and black, and often in crystals. Thomson's Polyadelphite was a massive brownish-yellow kind, from Franklim, N. J. (anal. 66, 67). The same locality affords another in dark green crystals, containing still more manganese. (.) Aptome has its dodecahedral faces striated parallel to the shorter diagonal, whence Haiiy inferred that the fundamental form was the cube ; and as this form is simpler than the dodecahe dron, he gave it a name derived from ',mr.6os simple. Color of the original aplome (of unknown locality) dark brown ; also found yeUowish-green and brownish-green at Schwarzenberg in Saxony, and on the Lena in Siberia. 3.

The grossularite from WUui afforded G. Magnus only 0-12 p. c. ; the cinnamon-stone of Ala, 0-25\u20140-34; the almandine of Slatoust, none (Pogg., xcvi. 347). In jewelry, the lighter clear garnets are often called hyacinth. The yeUowish is the Jacinta la bella; a yellowish crimson, the Guarnaccino; and another very similar, VermeUle, or Hyacinth- Garnet; the red, with a violet tinge, Rubino-di-rocca, and also Grenat Syrian (from Syriam in Pegu), and probably the Ameihyslizontes of Pliny. The deep and clear red, like Burgundy wine in shade, is the true precious garnet, which is either pyrope or almandite. The ancient name _>-8p_{, meaning a burning coal, alludes to the internal fire-like color and reflection, and was applied also to some ruby. The Latin name carbunculus, from carbo, coal, has the same significa tion. Pyr., etc. \u2014 Most varieties fuse easUy to a light-brown or black glass; F.=3 in almandite, spessartite, grossularite, and aUochroite; 3 -5 in pyrope; but ouvarovite, the chrome-garnet from Canada (No. 84 included), is almost infusible, F.=6. AUochroite and almaudite fuse to a mag netic globule. Reactions with the fluxes vary with the bases. Almost all kinds react for iron ; strong manganese reaction in spessartite, and less marked in other varieties ; a chromium reac tion in ouvarovite, and in most pyrope. Some varieties are partiaUy decomposed by acids ; aU except ouvarovite are after ignition decomposed by muriatic acid, and generaUy with separation of gelatinous sUica. Decomposed on fusion with alkaline carbonates. A brownish-red Arendal garnet, having G.=4'058, was reduced by heating to G.=4\"046, and by fusion to 3-596\u20143-204, Church; and a Ceylon essonite, having G.=3-666, had G. = 3-682 after heating to incipient fusion, Church. Obs. \u2014 Garnet crystals are very common in mica schist, gneiss, syenitic gneiss and hornblende,"], [327, "UNISILICATES. 271 and chlorite schist ; they occur often, also, in granite, syenite, crystaUine limestone, sometimes in serpentine, and occasionally in trap and volcanic tufa and lava. Garnet is sometimes found in the massive form as a prominent constituent of a rock. A white variety (lime-aluminagarnet) occurs, forming, with a little serpentine, a whitish garnet rock at Orford in Canada, having G. = 352 \u2014 3\"53. A similar garnet-felsile exists in Bayreuth in Bavaria. At St. Francois in Canada there is a yellowish-white and greenish-white garnet rock, consisting of the same garnet along with pyroxene, in the proportion, according to T. S.

Eclogyte is a garnet-euphotide, consisting of a massive reddish garnet and grass-green smaragdite or omphacite. These garnet rocks are aU very tough as well as heavy rocks. Many foreign locahties of garnet have been mentioned iu the preceding pages, under the head of composition and varieties. The best cinnamon-stone comes from Ceylon, in gneiss ; Malsjo in Wermland, in crystalline limestone ; on the Mussa-Alp in Piedmont, with clinochlore and diopside, where the crystals present the planes I, 2-2, i-2, f , 3-4, 0, I ; at Mittaghorn, in Switzerland, with the same minerals, reddish-brown in color, and having sometimes the planes i-2 and $ with / and 2-2 ; pale isabeUa-yeUow at Auerbach, with the planes 2-2, I, 8-J, i-2, .-J ; a brownish variety (romanzovite) at Kimito in Finland. A honey-yeUow garnet in octahedrons occurs in Elba. Grossu larite of pale greenish color, comes from the banks of the WUui in Siberia, in serpentine with idocrase, and from Cziklowa, in the Banuat ; in white or colorless crystals in TeUemark, in Norway, and the Schischimskaja Gora, in the Ural; also whitish in a resinopal pseudomorph after coral in Van Diemen's Land. Emerald-green crystals are found at Dobschau in Hungary. Almandite or precious garnet comes in fine crystals from Ceylon, Pegu, BrazU, and Greenland. Common garnet is found in dodecahedrons 3 to 4 inches through at Fahlun in Sweden, Arendal and Kongsberg in Norway, and the ZiUerthal. AUochroite, an apple-green and yeUowish variety, of different shades, occurs at Zermatt in Valais, in geodes of crystals in chlorite schist ; brUhant black crystals (melanite) and also brown, at Vesuvius on Somma ; and in a volcanic tufa at Fras cati near Rome; peak E spada and that of Ereslids near Bareges in the Hautes-Pyrenees (Pyrene ite). Aplome occurs in yeUowish and brownish-green crystals at Schwarzenberg in Saxony, and on the borders of the Lena in Siberia. Spessartite at Spessart near Aschaffenburg in Bavaria ; in the white feldspar of the granite of Elba, at St. Marcel, Piedmont, in pegmatite at Vilate near Chanteloube, Haute- Vienne ; at Broddbo, near Fahlun, in Sweden ; in a porphyritic trap, near Ilefeld in the Harz. Pyrope occurs in trap, tufa, and in the sands of the region, near Meronitz, Trziblitz, and Podsedlitz, in Bohemia, where alone the variety used as a gem is obtained ; also at Zobhtz in Saxony, and the vaUey of Krems in Bohemia, in a serpentine rock. Ouvarovite is found at Saranovskaja near Bissersk, in the vicinity of Kyschtimsk, Urals, Uning cavities or fissures in chromic iron; at Haule, in Rupshu, on chromite. Near Cauterets, the flautes-Pyrenees, large crystals of brown garnet have a nucleus, easUy separable, of dull green crystalUzed idocrase ; the containing rock is a compact gray Umestone. In N. America in Maine, beautiful yeUow crystals or cinnamon-stone (with idocrase) at Par sonsfield, Phippsburg, and Rumford; manganesian garnet at Phippsburg, as weU as the finest yellow garnet in Maine ; in mica slate near the bridge at Windham, with staurotide ; in granite veins at Streaked Mountain, along with beryl ; in large reddish-brown crystals at Buckfield, on the estates of Mr. Waterman and Mr. Lowe ; handsome red garnets at Brunswick. In A. Hamp., at Hanover, smaU clear crystals iu syenitic gneiss ; blood-red dodecahedrons at Franconia, in geodes in massive garnet, with calcite and magnetic iron ; at HaverhiU, in chlorite, some 1| in. ; at War ren, beautiful cinnamon garnets with green pyroxene ; at Unity, on the estate of J. Neal, with actin olite and magnetite, and at Lisbon, near Mink Pond, in mica slate with staurolite ; at Graftou, \\ to 1 in. in diameter. In Vermont, at New Fane, large crystals in chlorite slate ; also at Cabot aud Cavendish. In Mass., at Carlisle, geodes of transparent cinnamon-brown crystals similar to figure 14, with scapolite in limestone; at Boxborough, similar but less remarkable specimens ; also in gneiss at Brookfield and Brimfield ; massive with epidote at Newbury, and in crystals at Bedford, Chesterfield, with the Cummington kyanite, and at the beryl locality of Barre. In Conn., trapezo hedrons, in., in mica slate, at Reading and Monroe ; at Haddam, ib. of manganesian garnet, often 2 in. through, with chrysoberyl; at Middletown feldspar quarry, with octahedral faces (Shepard) ; at Lyme, large blackish-brown crystals in limestone. In N. York, in mica slate, in Dover, Duchess Co., smaU; at Roger's Rock. crystaUized and massive, and colophonite of yeUow, brown, and red colors, abundant; brown crystals at Crown Point, Essex Co.; colophonite as a large vein in gneiss at WUlsboro, Ecsex Co., with wollastonite and green coccolite, and also at Lewis, 10 m. south of KeeseviUe; in Middletown, Delaware Co., large brown cryst ; a cinnamon variety, crys talUzed and massive, at Amity ; on the Croton aqueduct, near Yonkers, in small rounded crystals, and a beautiful massive variety\u2014 the latter, when polished, forms a beautiful gem. In N. Jersey, at Franklin, black, brown, yeUow, red, and green dodecahedral garnets ; also near the Franklin furnace. In Penn., in Chester Co., at Pennsbury, fine dark brown crystals with polished faces, in granite- near Knauertown, at Keims' mine, in handsome lustrous crystals; at Chester, brown;"], [328, "272 OXYGEN COMPOUNDS. in Concord, on Green's Creek, resembling pyrope ; in LeiperviUe, red ; at Mineral HiU, fine-brown ; at Warren, black. In Delaware, cinnamon-stone in trapezohedrons, at Dickson's quarry, 7 m. from Wilmington. Also at Knife rapids on the Mississippi In California, green with copper ore, Hope VaUey, El Dorado Co., on Rogers' claim ; also with copper ore in Los Angeles Co., in Mt. Meadows ; ouvarovite, in crystals on chromite. at New Idria ; iu Alaska, in large trapezohe- drons, near Stickeen river ; pyrope, near Santa Fe, New Mexico. In Canada, at Marmora, dark-red ; at GrenviUe, a cinnamon-stone ; an emerald-green chrome- garnet, containing 6 to 7 p. c of oxyd of chrome, in Orford, Canada, in granular masses and druses of minute transparent dodecahedral crystals, with millerite and calcite (anaL 82); and in the same vicinity large cinnamon-red and yeUowish crystals of garnet along with pyroxene. The cinnamon-stone from Ceylon (caUed hyacinth) and the precious garnet are used as gems when large, finely colored, and transparent. The stone is cut quite thin, on account osthe depth of color, with a pavUion cut below, and a broad table above bordered with small facets. An octagonal garnet measuring 8J- lines by 6i has sold for near $700. Pulverized garnet is some- times employed as a substitute for emery. Alt. \u2014 Garnets containing protoxyd of iron often become rusty and disintegrated through the oxydation of the iron, and sometimes are altered, more or less completely, to limonite, magnetite, or hematite. The action of waters containing traces of carbonic acid and carbonates and silicates iu solution, results in the same changes nearly as with pyroxene, producing at differeut times a loss, or alteration, of bases, or by a further change and the addition of water, steatite, serpentine, chlorite. The lime in the lime garnets may be taken up by the carbonic acid of the waters ; and if magnesia is combined with the carbonic acid (forming a bicarbonate), it may take the place of the lime, and thus give rise to a serpentine or steatite pseudomorph, or to a chlorite, if the iron partly remains. AlkaUne carbonates seldom produce the changes, for alkaline pseudomorphs are rare. An excess of sihca is to be expected in analyses, according to Bischof, since part of the bases are often lost through incipient change. Quartz also occurs with the form of garnet. Troll. Wachtmeister found in a crystaUized, reddish-brown garnet, having G.=3'851, from Klemetsaune in Norway, which was partly penetrated by a whitish mineral, Si 52-11, Si 18 03, Fe 23-54, Mu 1-74, Ca 5-77 = 101-19, in which there is adeficiency of bases, or what is equivalent, an excess of silica, the oxygen ratio of bases and sUica being 1 : 1-7, instead of 1 : 1. SchUl found in a melanite from Kaiserstuhl, Si 45-80, Si 11-00, Pe 12-33, Ca 22-10, Sig 2-00, Fe 7-16, Sin 0'7o =101-09, giving for the oxygen ratio of bases and sUica 1 : D34. Sthamer obtained for a massive garnet, of a dark grayish-green color, from Miask, having a serpentine-like nucleus, Si 4611, Si 12-09, Pe 13-19, Ca 20'33, Sig 7-36=99-08, giving for the oxygen ratio of bases and suica 1:1-3. Pyrope occurs altered to talc at its several localities. A serpentine pseudomorph after garnet, from Schwarzenberg in Saxony, afforded Kersten Si 34-24, Mg 3328, Fe 3-38, Sin 0-41, Na 0-35, H with some bitumen 10-62, magnetic iron 17-50=99-78=82-28 serpentine and 17-50 magnetic iron. Some garnets effervesce with acids, from the presence of carbonate of Ume, wliich they have re ceived probably through the action of waters holding carbonic acid or bicarbonates in solution, as, for example, a black garnet from Arendal, Norway, which contains both calcite and epidote ; and crystals from Tvedestrand, which are whoUy calcite within, there being but a thin crust of garnet. Artif.\u2014 Melanite garnets have been obtained in a porous glass proceeding from the fusion of idocrase (Klaproth), and also of a melanite from Frascati (v. Kobell). MUler mentions tho occur rence of garnet in crystals as a furnace product. Daubree and Studer state that crystals of garnet may be made by fusing together the constituents. Mitscherlich has also obtained garnets arti ficiaUy (Ann. Ch. Phys., lxii. 219). Tritomite of Weibye, a hydrous species, is probably related in composition, as it is in form, to garnet and helvin; it appears to give, although a sesquioxyd sUicate, the garnet oxygen ratio 1 :1.

The name Hyacinth was applied by the ancients to a bluish-violet stone, regarded as our sapphire, and was derived from a flower (lily) so-caUed of this color. [In modern mineralogy a hyacinth color is reddish-orange with a tiuge of brown.] IntagU of zircon are common among- ancient gems, and the fact that the lyncurium of Theophrastus was, as he says, used for engraved signets, while at the same time electric on friction, and often amber-colored, are the principal evidence that it was our zircon. Alt. \u2014 Zircon is one of the least alterable of minerals, as it contains no protoxyds, and only the most insoluble of peroxyds. It however passes to a hydrous state, and is attended ultimately with a loss of sihca and the addition of oxyd of iron and other impurities derived from infiltrating waters. Auerbachite, malacon, \u0153rstedite, lachyophallite, calyptolite, cyrtolite, are probably altered zircon. The following tetragonal zircon-like minerals are probably altered zircon.

Idocrase often contains some water, amounting occasionally to 3 p. c, tho presence of which is probably due to alteration, and hence it is not to be iucluded as part of the protoxyd bases. G. Magnus found (Pogg., xcvi. 347) in crystals from Slatoust, 2-44 fl ; from Ala, 2-98 fl; green, from Vesuvius, 0-29; in another, 203 ; brown, id., 1-79.

Pyr., etc. \u2014 B.B. fuses at 3 with intumescence to a greenish or brownish glass. Magnus states that the density after fusion is 2-93\u20142-945. With the fluxes gives reactions for iron, and a variety from St. Marcel gives a strong manganese reaction. Cyprine gives a reaction for copper with salt of phosphorus. Partially decomposed by muriatic acid, and completely when the mineral has been previously ignited. Obs. \u2014 Idocrase was first found among the ancient ejections of Vesuvius and the dolomitic blocks of Somma. It has since been met with most abundantly in granular limestone ; also in serpentine, chlorite schist, gneiss, and related rocks. It is often associated with lime-garnet aud pyroxene. It has been observed imbedded in opal. At Vesuvius it is hair-brown to olive-green, and occurs with garnet, mica, nephelite, glassy feldspar, etc. ; at Ala, in Piedmont, it is in transparent green or brown brilliant crystals, in chlorite schist, with diopside, ripidolite, etc. Found also at Monzoni in the Fassa VaUey ; at Egg, near Christiansand, Norway ; ou the Wilui river, near L. Baikal (sometimes called vriluite, like the garnet of the same region) ; Cziklovva in Hungary ; in the Urals and elsewhere at localities above mentioned. In N. America, in Maine at Phippsburg and Rumford, just below the faUs, in crystals and massive with yellow garnet, pyroxene, etc., in limestone ; at Parsonsfield, with the same materials, abundant ; at Poland and Sandford (fig. 263). Iu Mass., near Worcester, in a quartz rock, with garnet, but exhausted. Iu N. York, \u00a3 m. S. of Amity, grayish and yeUowish-brown crystals, sometimes an inch in diameter, in granular Umestone ; also at the vUlage, and a mile east of the viUage, of yellow, greenish-yellow, and yeUowish-brown colors. In N. Jersey, yeUowish-brown in crystals at Newton, with corundum and spinel. In Canada, at Calumet Falls, in large brownish yeUow crystals in hmestone with brown tourmaline; at Grenville iu calcite, in wax-yellow crystals. For recent articles on cryst, see v.

It gives a=0\"537541. Named Vesuvian by Werner, from the first known locality. Werner supposed the mineral to be exclusively volcanic ; but as this idea is not expressed, the name is no more objectionable than aU others derived from the names of localities. The earlier name, Hyacinthine, is bad, as the mineral is not the hyacinth of either ancient or modern time. Haiiy's later name, Idocrase (sub jective, hke many others of his) is from .M_>, I see, and \u00abpi.ais, mixture, in aUusion to a resemblance between the crystalline forms and those of other species. Nothing in its signification, or iu any thing else, makes it right to substitute this for Werner's name. In English, the word vesuvian has the objection of being an adjective in form and use ; but this is avoided by giving it the min oralogical termination above employed. Alt. \u2014 Alterations nearly as in garnet, with a far greater tendency to becoming hydrated. Crystals from Maine often have the exterior, though stiU brUliant and glassy, cleavable easUy from the part below, and equaUy so, paraUel to aU the smaller as weU as larger faces, so that a pealed crystal has as brilUant and even planes as before. Pseudomorphs include steatite, mica, chnochlore, diopside, and garnet. An egeran, analyzed by Fieinus (Schrift. Dresd. Min. Ges., i. 235), gave SUica 43-00, alumina 14-70, sesquioxyd of iron 2'40, ib. of manganese 4-00, Ume 30-00, soda 5-33=99-43. It is probably in an altered state, as Rammelsberg infers from the description of Fieinus. The carbonic acid detected by Hermann in idocrase from Slatoust (anal. 23) is evidence of alteration, and this acid and alkaline or earthy carbonates or bicarbonates in solution, are agents by which change is often produced. Artif.\u2014 Mitscherlich has obtained idocrase by artificial methods (Ann. Ch. Phys., lvii. 219) ; Studer, from a fusion together of the constituents ; also Daubree, by the action of chlorid of sflicon in vapor on the required bases (C. R., 1854, July, p. 135)."], [336, "280 OXYGEN COMPOUNDS. 274. MELILITE. MelUite Delameth., T. T., ii. 273, 1796; Fl.

The species of the Epidote Group, enumerated with the formulas on p. 251, are characterized by specific gravity above 3, and therefore high ; hard ness above 5 ; fusibility JB.B. below 4 ; anisometric crystallization, and therefore biaxial polarization ; the dominant prismatic angle 112\u00b0 to 117\u00b0 ; fibrous forms, when they occur, always brittle ; colors white, gray, brown, yellowish-green, and deep green to black, and sometimes reddish. The prismatic angle in zoisite aud other orthorhombic species is 7 A I; but in epidote it is the angle over a horizontal edge between the planes 0 and i-i, the orthodiagonal of epidote corres ponding to the vertical axis of zoisite, as explained under the latter species. T. S. Hunt has observed (0. R., 1863, Am. J. Sci., II. xxxvi. 426, xliii. 205) that the high spe cific gravity and hardness of the Epidote group, as compared with the Scapolite, is to be ascribed to a more elevated or higher multiple equivalent, or, in other words, to a more condensed mole cule. But the numerical value of the multiple, or of the relation between the species, has not yet been ascertained. 276. EPIDOTE. Schorl vert du Dauphine de Lisle, Crist., ii. 401, 1783. Strahlstein pt.

G. of Arendal epidote changes on ignition, from 3'409 to 2'984 Obs.\u2014 Epidote is common in many crystalline rocks, as syenite, gneiss, mica schist, hornblendic schist, serpentine, and especially those that contain the ferriferous mineral hornblende. It often accompanies beds of magnetite or hematite in such rocks. It is sometimes found in geodes in trap ; and also in sandstone adjoining trap dikes, where it has been formed by metamorphism through the heat of the trap at the time of its ejection. It also occurs at times in nodules in dif ferent quartz-rocks or altered sandstones. It is associated often with quartz, pyroxene, feldspar, axinite, chlorite, etc., in the Piedmontese Alps. It sometimes forms with quartz an epidote rock, caUed epidosyte. Such a rock, from Grand Matanne River, Canada, having a hardness of 70, and G.=3-04, gave T. S. Hunt, on analysis (Logan's Rep., 1863, 497), Si 62-60, __1 12'30, Pe 9'40, Mg 0-72, Ca 14-10, Na 0'43, ign. 0'19= 99-71, which corresponds to 61-33 epidote and 3822 quartz. A simUar rock exists at Melbourne in Canada. Beautiful crystaUizations come from Bourg d'Oisans, Ala, and TraverseUa, in Piedmont; Zer- matt in the Valais ; near Gutanen in the Haslithal ; at Kaverdiras and Baduz in the valley of Tavetsch (the latter sometimes referred to zoisite, but opticaUy epidote according to Descloizeaux) ; Monzoni in the Fassa vaUey ; ZiUerthal in the Tyrol, sometimes in rose-red and greenish crystals of smaU size, resembling thulite ; the Sau-Alpe in Carinthia ; and the other localities mentioned above. In N. America, occurs in N. Hamp. at Franconia, crystaUized and granular, with magnetite ; Warren, with quartz and pyrite. In Mass., at Hadlyme and Chester, in crystals in gneiss ; at Athol, in syenitic gneiss, in fine crystals, 2 m.

Epidote is one of Haiiy's crystallographic names, derived from the Greek briSmris, increase, and translated by him, \" qui a recu un accroissement,\" the base of the prism (rhomboidal prism) hav ing one side longer than the other. Iu its introduction Haiiy set aside three older names. Thai lite (from -uM-s, color of young twigs, aUuding to the green color) was rejected because it was based on a varying character, color ; Delphinite and Arendalite, because derived from locaUties. But the name Epidote is now so involved in geological as weU as mineralogical literature that the law of priority cannot well do the justice demanded of it. Werner's name Pistacite from -(.r-xia, the pistachio-nut (referring to the color) was not proposed as early as thalUte or epidote. Alt. \u2014 Epidote is less liable to alteration than most of the sUicates, partly because the iron it contains is mostly, when not whoUy, in the state of sesquioxyd. The analyses afford generally one or two per cent, of water, which is probably foreign to the species ; and in a green mineral from Isle Royale, having the composition of epidote, J. D. Whitney found 5 per cent of water (Rep. Geol. L. Sup., 1851, 97). Artif. \u2014 Epidote has not been found among the crystallizations of furnace slags, or formed in the laboratory of the chemist It has been a frequent result of the action of heat and steam on ferruginous sandstones accompanying the ejection of doleryte and other eruptive rocks; and this fact suggests the method by which it may be artificiaUy formed. 276A.

The more prominent ways of variation are the foUowing: (1) The crystals are sometimes broad tabular, and sometimes very long acicular. (2) The crystals, when weU-formed, often manifest no double refraction, as Descloizeaux has observed. (3 ) The amount of water present varies from none to 1 7 p. c, and the hardness and specific gravity correspondingly, the kinds containing the most water being lowest ; and, in some, G. not exceed ing 253. (4) There is also much diversity in pyrognostic and other chemical characters, as ex plaiued beyond. The varieties that have been distinguished are as foUows : 1. Allanite.

From Achmatovsk, Ural"], [343, "UNISILICATES. 287 Hermann has described and analyzed what he calls bagrationite, from Achmatovsk, which he states has the angles of the bucklandite of Achmatovsk, and which, therefore, is true epidote (q v.). The analyses by Hermann sustain this reference. 3. Orthite included, in its original use, the slender or acicular prismatic crystals, often a foot lono containing some water. But these graduate into massive forms, and some orthites are anhydrous or as nearly so as much of the allanite. The name is from .pfl.f, straight. The tendency to alter ation and hydration may be due to the slenderness of the crystals, and the consequent great ex posure to the action of moisture and the atmosphere. H. = 5 \u2014 6.

Xanthorthite, of Hermann, is yellowish and contains much water, and is apparently an altered variety; G. = 2-78\u2014 2-9. Named from (avBos, yellow, and orthite. 5. Pijrorthite of Berzelius is an impure orthite-like mineral, in long prisms of rather loose tex ture, containing as its principal impurity some carbonaceous material (over 30 p. c), and show ing this in its burning before the blowpipe. Named from nvp, fire, and orthite. From Kararfvet, near Fahlun. 6. Erdmannite, of Berlin, from Stoko, near Brevig, is near orthite in composition. It occurs in imbedded grains and plates, with G. = 3-l, lustre vitreous, color dark brown, and is translucent in thin splinters. Named after Prof. Erdmann. Contains 4 to 5 p. c. of water. AUanite is a cerium-epidote. But, besides a large percentage of cerium, it contains generally the related metals, lanthanum and didymium, with also, sometimes, a Uttle yttrium, and rarely traces of glucinum. The condition of oxydation of the iron has not been exactly determined iu most of the analyses, and consequently the results are discordant. The best determinations, according to Rammelsberg, afford approximately, the garnet-ratio 1 : 1 : 2, instead of the epidote ratio 1:2:3, whence the formula (J R3 + -J R)2 Si3.

Formula (jCa5 + \u00a3-_l)2Si3= SUica 399, alumina 22-8, Ume 37-3 = 100. The amount of sesquioxyd of iron varies from 0 to 6-33 p. c. ; if much more is present, amounting to a sixth atomicaUy of the protoxyd bases, the compound appears to take the monoclinic form of epidote, instead of the orthorhombic of zoisite. Saussurite, according to the analyses, has the 0. ratio for R, _., Si=l : 2 : 34, instead of 1 : 2 : 3, and it appears as if this was another case in which an increase of silica accompanies the increase of alkali in the bases. Both Hunt and Fikenscher's analyses give the 0. ratio 2 : 3\u00a3 for the sesquioxyds and sUica. Hunt's, however, has an excess of protoxyds. In a second analysis by Hunt (see below), the specimen contained mixed talc, amounting to 10 or 12 p. c. ; and if the magnesia in the first, and in Fikenseher's, is due in part to taJc, this would subtract from the silica; and but a smaU reduction in this way would make the ratio 1:2:3.

Obs. \u2014 This species was instituted by Werner in 18()5, first united to epidote by Haiiy and Bernhardi independently in 1 S06, and separated again from epidote on crystaUographic grounds by Brooke, in 1 823. Descloizeaux has confirmed Brooke's conclusion by optical examinations, and fur ther has shown that the crystallization is orthometric, instead of clinometric. Thulite is referred to the species by Descloizeaux, together with the lime-epidote from most of the localities mentioned iu connection with the analyses. The angle i-2 A i-i in thulite is near 152\u00b0. Brooke remarks upon the isomorphism of the species with euclase. Zoisite was so named after Baron von Zois, from whom Werner received his first specimens; and Thulite, after Thule, an ancient name of Norway. The original zoisite is that of the Saualpe in Cariuthia. Other localities are as mentioned. The gray mineral of Fichtelgebirge in Baireut, was referred here by Bernhardi (Lc., 1 806), and both to epidote. ThuUte occurs at Souland in TeUemark, in Norway, with bluish idocrase (cyprine), yellowish-white garnet, epidote, and fluorite; also at the iron mine of Klodeberg near Arendal; and at TraverseUa in Piedmont, forming smaU veins with talc and actinolite in granite. Saussurite forms with, smaragdite the euphotide osthe Alps, a rock which, as a result of glacier action, is widely distributed in boulders over the valley of the Rhone, and the country about Lake Geneva ; the boulders, as ascertained by Prof. Guyot, were derived from the chain of the Sassgrat, through the valley of the Sass, and are distributed to a distance of 150 m. from this place of ori gin. Found also in serpentine, in the Schwarzwald, but more or less altered (anal. 28). Hunt showed that both the very high specific gravity aud composition identified the mineral with zois ite. (For other minerals that have passed under the name of saussurite, see Garnet, Meionite, Labradorite.)

The crystal figured above by the author (and from the cabinet of Prof. Brush) is % in. long, but was attached by one side to a large imperfect crystal, and hence its planes were irregularly developed. The left 1-Z and 2-4 were minute and somewhat rounded. The angle I A i-i by Descloizeaux's measurement, is 1 2 1\u00b0 40', as given above ; Descloizeaux obtained also for i-i A. -2=162\" 20', i-iAi-i, top, = 120\u00b0 nearly; for ..A 4-2=107\u00b0 13', whence i-2Ai'-2=145\u00b0 34', and MiUer found 107\u00b0\" 12',\"whence 145\u00b0 36'. Zoisite is closely isomorphous with epidote. If the figure 266 under epidote (p. 28) is placed with the longer planes vertical, it then represents very nearly the form of zoisite ; the angle of this prism i-i'M-j is J 15\" 24', and -1 A-l = 109; 35'; and correspondingly, the prismatic angle of zoisite is 116\u00b0 40', and the brachydome 1-t has the summit angle 109\u00b0 20'. The position given the crystals of epidote by Haiiy has therefore a crystallogenic interest, and the name he applied to tlie species peculiar significance. 280A. JADEITE. Nephrite or Jade pt.

Obs. \u2014 Jadeite is one of the kinds of pale green stones used in China for making ornaments, and passing under the general name of jade or nephrite. Mr. PumpeUy remarks that the feitsui is perhaps the most prized of aU stones among the Chinese. He also observes that the chalchihuitl of the ancient Mexicans, of which he had seen many specimens, is probably the same mineral. But W. P. Blake identifies this name with the turquois from the vicinity of Santa Fe (Am. J. Sci., H. xxv. 227). 281. PARTSCHINITE. Partschin Haid., Ber., iu. 440, 1847, Ber. Ak. Wien, xii. 4S0.

Comp., Var. \u2014 Gadolinite varies widely in its crystals, and physical and chemical characters, even in specimens from the same locality, and much more so in those of different.

Lang state that the crystals from Ytterby are sometimes obhque in the direction of one diagonal, and sometimes in that of the other ; they adopt Nordenskiold's calculated results. Waage, who makes the form monoclinic, enumerates the planes O, I, i-i, i-i, 1, -1, |, -i, 1-2, i-i, 1-i. His measurements were made with the reflective goniometer, and agree weU with his cal culated results ; which, in addition to the above, are, O A 7=89\u00b0 31', OA 1 = 111\u00b0 29, 0A-1= 112\u00b0 21', Oa \u00a3-.=136\u00b0 7', 1A-1=136\u00b0 10', I A 1 = 158\u00b0 8', I A -1 = 158\u00b0 2'. Waage points out a relation in angles to epidote, observing that the prismatic angle, 116\u00b0, which is nearly that of zoisite, corresponds to \u00a7-i A f-t in epidote (=115\u00b0 32'). The Ytterby crystals examined by v. Lang were partly altered. Descloizeaux found crystals from this locality part a mixture of double and singly refracting material, and part without any action on polarized Ught. Amid the diversity of results it is impossible to decide which is the correct form. The variations in composition are also considerable. The Ytterby, Finbo, and Broddbo gadohnite afford approximately the formula R2 Si ; that of Hitteroe, R8 Si3, the O. ratio between the bases and silica being approximately 4 : 3, as in euclase.

Obs. \u2014 Gadolinite occurs principally in the quarries of Kararfvet, Broddbo, and Finbo, near Fahlun in Sweden ; also at Ytterby, near Stockholm ; at each place indistinctly crystaUized, and in rounded masses, which are often encircled with a yeUow crust, and imbedded in coarse-grained granite. At Kararfvet crystals have been obtained 4 in. long. It has also been met with at Disko in Greenland ; in trap near Galway, Ireland ; imbedded in granite in Ceylon ; at Brevig and Hitteroe in the southern part of Norway, crystals sometimes 4 in. across and twins at this last locality.

Stadeler found water a constant ingredient, and, as it was not expeUed below ignition, regards it as basic. His closely-agreeing analyses give for R+fi, Si, fl the O. ratio 9:8:1, and for Ca, Fe, Pe, 2:4:1. If fl be basic, the O. ratio of bases and silica is 5 : 4, which is expressed in the formula (fl3, R8, fi)6 gi8. But in view of the variation in ratio in the analyses of the Elba mineral, and its opacity, we may reasonably infer that impurities are present (as staurotide exemplifies, p. . . . ), and that these impurities are mainly hydrated oxyd of iron, of the species gothite, which mineral loses its water at a high temperature.

Obs. \u2014 Iolite occurs in granite, gneiss, hornblendic, chlorite and talcose schist, and aUied rocks, with quartz, orthoclase or albite, tourmaline, hornblende, andalusite, and sometimes beryL Also rarely in volcanic rocks. At Bodenmais, Bavaria, it is met with in granite, in crystals, along with pyrrhotine, blende, chalcopyrite ; the variety is the peliom of Werner, named from ir-Aio? in allusion to its smoky blue color. It occurs in quartz at Ujordlersoak in Greenland ; in granite at Cape de Gata, in Spain ; at Krageroe in Norway; Orijerfvi, in Finland (steinheilite) ; Tunaberg, in Sweden; Finspaong in Ostgothland ; Brunhult in Sudermanland ; Fahlun (hard fahlunite) ; Lake Laach, with sanidin ; at Campiglia Maritima, Tuscany, in a trachytic rock, containing also mica, quartz, and sanidin. Ceylon affords a transparent variety, in small roUed masses of an intense blue color, the sapphire d'eau of jeweUers. At Haddam, Conn., associated with tourmaUne in a granitic vein in gneiss ; sparingly at the chrysoberyl locaUty, in an altered or fahlunite condition ; abundant in quartz with garnet and yeUowish-green feldspar, near the Norwich and Worcester Railway, between the Shetucket and Quinnebaug, where the gneiss has been quarried for the road. At Brimfield, Mass., on the road leading to Warren, near Sam Patrick's with adularia, in gneiss ; also good at Richmond, N. H., in talcose rock, along with anthophylhte. IoUte is occasionaUy employed as an ornamental stone, and when cut exhibits different colors in different directions. Named Iolite from iov, violet, and Xi.o?, stone; Dichroite, from its dichroism ; CoMierite, after Cordier, the geologist, who first studied the crystal of the species ; Steinheilite by Gadolin after Mr. SteinheiL Lucas and Haiiy, who adopt cordierite, rejected the eariier names iolite and dichroite because the former is not always applicable, and the latter is equaUy applicable to various other stones. Epi dote, pyroxene, and a multitude of other names, if judged by the same code, would be found to have no better claim to recognition. Alt. \u2014 The alteration of iolite takes place so readUy by ordinary exposure, that the mineral is most commonly found in an altered state, or enclosed iu the altered ioUte. This change may be a sin) \u2022 pie hydratiori (fahlunite, etc.); or a removal of part of the protoxyd bases by cdVbonie acid; or the introduction of oxyd of iron ; or of alkaUes, forming pinite and mica. The first step in the change consists in a division of the prisms of iolite into plates paraUel to the base, and a pearly foliation of the surfaces of these plates ; with a change of color to grayish-green and greenish gray, anff sometimes brownish-gray. As the alteration proceeds, the foUation becomes more com-"], [357, "UNISILICATES. 301 plete ; afterward it may be lost The mineral in this altered condition has many names : as hydrous iolite, pinite, calaspilite, fahlunite, bonsdorffite, esmarkile, chlorophyllile, gigantolite, praseolite, aspasiolite. Pinite, as far as it is altered iolite, includes properly the alkaline kinds. Fahlunite and the foUowing, excepting the last, correspond to iolite + aq. In most cases if the water of the altered iolite be included with the bases, the oxygon ratio between the bases and silica becomes 1:1; it seems, therefore, quite probable that the strong tendency of iolite to take up water is owing to the fact that its silica (whose amount of oxygen exceeds that of the bases by one-fourth) is not saturated with bases. Regarding the water of the altered mineral as basic, esmarkite, chlo rophyllile, gigantolite, and praseolite wiU have the formula (R3, R) Si ; and fahlunite and bonsdorffite, containing twice as much water as. the preceding, would have the formula (R3, fi) gi + fl. If 1 : 3 : 5 : 0 be the oxygen ratio for R, fi, Si, fl in iolite, 1:3:5:1 wUl be the ratio for esmar kite, etc., and 1 : 3 : 5 : 2, for fahlunite, etc. Weissite, iberiie, huronite are names of other min erals supposed to be altered iolite. For the distinguishing characters and analyses of the different kinds of altered ioUte, see PimiB, Fahlunite, and Catasp-Lite, under Hydrous Silicates. MICA GROUP. The minerals of the Mica group are alike in having (1) the prismatic angle 120\u00b0 ; (2) eminently perfect basal cleavage, affording readily very thin, tough, lamin\u00e6 ; (3) potash almost invariably among the protoxyd bases and alumina among the sesquioxyd ; (4) the crystallization either hexa gonal or orthorhombic, and therefore the optic axis, or optic-axial plane, at right angles to the cleavage surface. Soda is sparingly present in some micas, and is characteristic of the hydrous species paragonite (p. ). Lithia, rubidia, and c\u00e6sia occur in lepidohte. Fluorine is often present, probably re placing oxygen. Titanium is found sparingly in several kinds, and is a prominent ingredient of one species, astrophyUite. It is usuaUy regarded as in the state of titanic acid replacing sihca ; but, for reasons elsewhere given, it is here made basic. 1. 0. ratio for bases and silica 1 : 1. 288. Phlogopite.

The species of the Mica group graduate into the hydrous micas of the Margarodite group (p. ) ; and through these they also approach the foUated species of the Talc and Chlorite groups, especially the latter. ' The micas were regarded as of one species untU 1792, when lepidolite was made distinct. The earlier synonymy therefore may be conveniently given here."], [358, "302 OXYGEN COMPOUNDS. Pliny probably included the mineral mica with the Lapis specularis (xxxvi 45) or Selenite ; and the shavings or scales of Lapis specularis strown over the \" Circus Maximus, \" to produce an agreeable whiteness, were probably those of a soft sUvery mica schist. His Hammochrysos also (xxxvii. 73, named from ifi/ms, sand, \\pva6s, gold) was probably sand from a yeUowish mica schist, which abounds by the road-side in many mica-schist regions. Agricola speaks of the deceptive character of this silvery and golden dust, as cited below. This silvery and golden mica in scales is the Cat-silver and Cat-gold of medi\u00e6val Europe.

J Comp., Var. \u2014 Biotite is a magnesia-iron mica, part of the alumina being replaced by sesqui oxyd of iron, and protoxyd of iron and magnesia existing among the protoxyd bases. Black is the prevailing color, but brown to white also occur. The results of analyses vary much, and for the reason already stated \u2014 the non-determination, in most cases, of the degree of oxydation of the iron ; and the' exact atomic ratio for the species and its limits of variation are therefore not pre cisely understood. The 0. ratio, which appears to be dominant, is 1 : 1 : 2, giving the formula (iRa+-ifi)2Si3, which is the formula of garnet. In some cases the ratio is apparently near"], [361, "305 UNISILICATES. 1 : IJ : 2\\ and 1:2:3; and through species containing much iron it passes to micas of the species annite and lepidomelane.

The last two, 30, 31, are the analyses by Rose and v. KobeU, Nos. 20, 21, with the Fe and Pe as recently determined by A Mitscherlich. MitscherUch's results change the ratio from 1 : 1 : 2 to nearly 5 : 3 : 10, or the ratio approximately of phlogopite ; and if his determination should be sustained, the Siberian mica analyzed would appear to be phlogopite.

Pyr., etc. \u2014 Same as phlogopite, except that with the fluxes it gives strong reactions for iron. Obs. \u2014 Biotite was first shown to be optically uniaxial by Biot, after whom it is named ; and, later, to be hexagonal in crystaUization by Marignac (Bibl. Univ., 1847, Suppl. vi. 300); Brooke and MUler (Min., 387); Kokscharof (Min. RussL, iL 291); and quite recently, and after careful measurements, by Hessenberg (Min. Not., No. viL 15, 1866). But stitt the crystals are often slightly biaxial, as first remarked by SiUiman (Am. J. Sci., II. x. 372, 1850), and W. P. Blake (ib., xii. 6, 1851); and later by Dove (Ber. Ak. Berlin, 1853), Senarmont (Ann. Ch. Phys., HI. xxxui. 391, xxxiv. 171), Graib'ch (Lehrb. d. Kryst., 1856), and others. On the ground osthe biaxial character observed, Descloizeaux, in his Min., i. 88, 1862, made the species orthorhombic. Blake examined specimens from Greenwood Furnace ; a silvery- white var. fr. Easton, Pa. ; a crimson from Topsham, Me. ; a fiery-red, by transmitted light, from Moriah, Essex Co., N. V. ; a dark bottle-green from Moor's Slide, Ottawa, Canada ; and seven different varieties from Vesuvius. But the divergence, which was in all very small, was not measured. One of the uniaxial micas examined by Biot is stated by him to have come from Topsham, Me. Kokscharof found some crystals from Vesuvius true uniaxial.

The Vesuvian biotite found on Mt. Somma (Meroxene of Breith.) occurs in briUiant crystals with numerous polished facets. Other foreign locaUties are named in connection with the anal- yses. The mica from Greenwood Furnace, Monroe, N. Y., analyzed by von Kobell (anal. 1), occurs in large and very regular rhombic prisms (sometimes 5 or 6 in. across) oblique from an acute edge ; and also in tetrahedral pyramids ; the faces of the pyramids incline to the cleavage plane at 113\u00b0 to 114\u00b0; v. KobeU gives for the angle BAR (faces of the pyramid) 71\u00b0 to 72\u00b0. This 'is the same mica with that analyzed by Smith and Brush (anal. 2, 3), as Prof. Brush has assured himself by an examination of von KobeU's specimens at Munich. Alt. \u2014 Rubdlan is considered an altered biotite ; it occurs in smaU hexagonal forms, of a red color, in a kind of wacke. Steatite is also a result of the alteration of this species, as in granite at Brunn and Thierscheim. Among the above analyses, several indicate incipient change by the water and chlorine present. Mica, altered to magnetite, has been observed in the Tyrol. The Eukamptite of Kenngott (Ueb., 1853, 58, 1855, and described under the name Chlorit dhnliches Mineral in Ber. Ak. Wien, xi. 609, 1853) is a hydrous biotite, probably a result of alteration, from Presburg, Hungary. It is between mica and chlorite in its characters. Color nearly black, but in very thin folia brown to hyacinth-red or reddish-yellow; H. = 2\u2014 2-5; G. = 273. Com- position, according to an analysis by v.

Obs. \u2014 A scaly-massive mineral at Persberg in Wermland, Sweden, containing imbedded prisms of hornblende, the scales half a Une or so across ; mica-like at Abborforss in Finland; in granite in Ireland, at BaUyellin in Carlow Co., Leinster, at BaUygihen in Donegal Co., and at Canton, mostly in largish crystals or plates (J inch across and larger). The Donegal and Leinster Co. mica is optically uniaxial, according to Haughton. The granite contains also a white muscovite (see anaL 8-11, under Muscovite); and in some eases the black and white form parts of the same crystal ; and, where so, the optic-axial divergence of the muscovite was diminished, according to some trials, 20\u00b0.

It approaches a chlorite. Ptbeolitb of Breithaupt (B. H.

Aotite Dana. The lepidomelane of Cape Ann, described and analyzed by J. P. Cooke (Am. J. ScL, II. xlui. 222), differs, according to the analyses, in having the O. ratio 1:2:3, instead of 1 : 3 : 4. In optical and other physical characters it is like lepidomelane. It occurs in plates and disseminated scales; H.=3; G.=3-169 ; color black; streak dark green ; opaque, except in very thin folia.

B is deduced from A on the supposition that the mineral was mixed intimately (as a result of contemporaneous crystaUization) with cryophyUite, an associated species at the locality, and that the amount of lithia indicated the proportion of cryophylhte. O. ratio deduced for the latter for R, fi, Si, fl=6-2 : 12-1 : 19-9 : 1-6. It maybe found that the biotites having the O. ratio for R, fi= 1 : 2 should be here placed.

These ratios may hereafter prove to be different after a correct determination in each case of the degree of oxydation of the iron. Fluorine is present, but not over 1 p. c. has in any case been detected. Water is often present, especially where the latter ratio is 1 : 6 or 1 : 9 ; and it sometimes amounts to 5 p. c. ; and the kinds containing 3 to 5 p. c. of water have been referred to the spe cies Margarodite ; making the water basic in such kinds, the 0. ratio for bases and sUica becomes 1 : 1, as in other unisilicates. The hydrous kinds so graduate into the anhydrous that the analy ses are here brought all together, although the species margarodite is introduced on page 487. The ratio 1 : 1\\ may indicate that muscovite is a combination of 3 parts of a unisiUcate and 2 of a bisilicate, as in the formula 3 (R3, fi)3 Si3 + 2 (R3, fi) Si3. But if the mineral is a true unisilicate, as its relation to biotite and phlogopite would indicate, but with an excess of sUica, the formula maybe ( K3, fi)2 Si3+ 1| Si ; or else with half the excess of sihca basic. With the 0. ratio 1 : 6 for R and K, the bases correspond to }K3+ . fi ; with 1 : 9, to ft fl3+ ft fi ; with 1 : 12, to h K'-f-r! H. The analyses are here arranged in groups ; first, according as the oxygen ratio between the bases (R+fi) and silica (Si) is 1 : IJ, or 1 : 14 ; and subordinates, into those in which the oxygen ratio between the protoxyds (ft) and sesquioxyds (fi) is either 1 : 6 approximately, or 1 : 9, or 1 : 1 2. It is to be remarked that the incipient alteration of a mica, attended with the introduction of a Uttle magnesia, lime, or soda (Mg, Ca, or Na), with a removal or not of some potash (K), might increase the proportion of protoxyds and thus change the latter ratio from 1 : 12 to 1 : 6, or pro duce the intermediate gradations.

On examining different micas pressed between two plates of glass, and subjecting them to changes of temperature, Senarmont found no perceptible change in the optical axes. GraUich shows that, with slight exceptions, the angle increases with the specific gravity in the mica of a given locaUty. Thus seven micas from Presburg, Hungary, gave the foUowing: Specific gravity 2-714 2735 2-755 2782 2-790 2793 2796 Angle 69-7 70\"0 70-5 7T2 72-3 72-4 72-0 Muscovite was so named by the author in 1850, from Vilrum Muscoviticum ot Muscovy-glass, formerly a popular name of the mineral. Fuchsite was named after the chemist, Fuchs. Talcite of Thomson (1. c), from Wicklow, Ireland, is nothing but margarodite, according to Greg and Lettsom (Min., 203), who say that it invests crystals of andalusite. Thomson, as his descrip tion implies, considered the andalusite prisms and investing mica aU one mineral \u2014 the talcite; and in view of this, the analyses need not here be cited. Thomson's nacrite, from \" Brunswick, Me.,\" is the green mica of Unity, Me. Alt. \u2014 Mica at times becomes hydrated, losing its elasticity and transparency, and often some portion of the potash ; and at the same time it may take up magnesia, lime, or soda. The occur rence of water, magnesia, Ume, and soda in some micas, especiaUy the margarodites, has been attributed to incipient alteration. See analyses under A, 1, and A, 2. These changes may be promoted by waters containing carbonates of these bases. R. Blum (Jahrb. Min., 1865, 269) gives the following analysis by Dr. Wolkenhaar of an altered mica (biotite ?) from the dioryte of Schemnitz, which had lost nearly aU its alumina and consisted largely of carbonates: Si 33-34, Si 3'53, Fe 16-01, Mn 0-89, Mg 2-06, Ca 21'73, Na 2-26, K 0-56, C 20-06=100-44. The carbonic acid would require the Ca 2173, and Mg 2-06, with Fe 1'22, making 45 p. c. of carbonates. Mica occurs altered to steatite and serpentine, and Tschermak mentions cases of alteration to amphibole and stUpnosiderite. 294. LEPIDOLITE. Violetfarbigen ZeoUth (fr. Rozena) ..

Rammelsberg's analysis of the Zinnwald lepidolite (anaL 12) gave him the O. ratio 1-15: 3: 6-2, or nearly 1:3:6; and that of the Rozena (anaL 4) 1:4-4: 9'13, or approximately 1 : 4J : 9, but for which he proposes 1 : 4J : li, since the specimen he analyzed contained free quartz in visible grains, and his sUica might consequently have been too high [the ratio 1 : 1. between the bases and suica would require 1 : 4J: 8i]. From Rosales's analysis of the Juschakova (anaL 17), he deduces the ratio 1:2'8: 6'4, or approximately, as he observes, 1:3:6.

A list of the species of the Scapolite group, with their oxygen ratios and formulas, and the ratios of the non-alkaline to the alkaline protoxyd bases, is given on page 252. Although the oxygen ratios vary from 1:1:2, 1:2:3, 1:3:4, to 1:2:4 and 1 : 2 : 6\u00a3, the species are' closely alike in the square-prismatic forms of their crystals, in the small number and the kinds of occurring planes, and in the angles. The variation in the basal angle of the fundamental octahedron (1 : 1) for the species of the group is less than 40', the extremes being 64\u00b0 13' (sarcolite) and 63\u00b0 40' (meionite). The species are white or grayish-white in color, except when impure, and then rarely of dark color; the hardness 5 \u2014 6-5; G.= 2'5\u2014 2-8 (2-932. in sarcolite). The alkali present, when any, is soda, with only traces of potash. Meionite was the first species of the Scapolite group distinctly recognized. It is, however, probable that scapohte was included with lameUar pyroxene under the name of White Schorl- Spar (Skorlspat) by Cronstedt, who mentions Pargas, in Finland, as one of its localities. The names Wernerile and Scapolite were both introduced by d'Andrada (of Portugal) in the same article (Seherer's J., iv. 35, 38, 1800), and applied to specimens from the same region in Norway. Wernerite is the first of the two in the article. Haiiy used the names Wernerile and Scapolite (supposing the species distinct) in his Traite of 1801. But iu his Mineralogical Course for 1804 or 1805 arbitrarUy set aside the latter for Paranthine. Monteiro, a friend of d'Andrada, and speaking in his behalf, protested in 1809 (J. de Phys., lxviU. 177) against the change, and after arguing that wernerite and scapolite were identical, both on chemical and crystaUographic grounds, urged the adoption of the name Wernerile for the species. In the foUowing pages the name Scapolite is retained for the group, so that the minerals may aU be caUed scapoliles, as those of the feldspar group are caUed feldspars, and those of the mica and chlorite groups, respectively micas and chlorites; and the name Wernerite is appUed to the most prominent division of the old species. This course meets satisfactory the question of priority, and also the convenience of the science. 296. SARCOLITE. SarcoUte Dr. Thompson (of Naples), 1807.

The name paranthine, substituted for scapolite (and for Arendal specimens) by Haiiy, was consequently connected in France, almost as soon as introduced, with the above composition, and continued so to be for nearly 20 years afterward, Berzelius giving the formula Ca3 Si + 3 Si Si (and also the name paranthine) in his N. Syst. Min., 1819, 216. Although Lau gier's analysis of the Arendal scapolites is not confirmed by later analysts, the name paranihite may weU be retained for this section of the ScapoUte group. 299.

Rath of specimens named nuttallile, and attributed to Bolton, are evidently of altered crystals, as the presence of over 3 p. c. of oxyd of iron indicates. The coloi stated, \"blackish-green,\" is further evidence on this point. Moreover it is a very unusual color at the locality, as nuttallite is ordinarily white, grayish-white, and pale smoky brown, the darker color occurring sometimes in crystals that are partly whitish. V. Rath states that the mineral was very difficultly fusible. Thomson's analysis (No. 3) was also made on an altered specimeu, as it gave 5 p. c. of water. Muir, in an analysis of nuttallite pubUshed by Thomson (Min., 383) obtained Si 3781, Si 2510, 3. e 7-89, Ca 18 34,\"K 7-30, H 1-50=97-94. The potash and the low sihca, as well as the iron, in dicate an altered specimen, if the analysis may be so far trusted as to draw a conclusion from it. The color of the mineral (white, to yeUowish, bluish, or greenish) and the associated minerals on the specimen (sphene and green pyroxene) show that Muir probably had true nuttalUte for in vestigation. Wurtz's analysis of the pink scapoUte of Bolton gives more soda than the rest. In a recent trial (priv. contrib.) B. S. Burton found about 3 p. c. of alkalies, sustaining Wolff's results. The bluish-gray massive variety from Malsjo has been analyzed also by Suckow (Verwitt. Min., 138), but as he found no alkalies, his results are questionable, either on the ground of the speci men or the analysis. He obtained gi 48'17, Si 28-27, Pe 238, Ca 19-04, H 2-00=99-86.

Moscow, 1848, 548) differs from the true glaucolite in being difficultly fusible (as much so as orthoclase), and also in composition, these analysts obtaining : Si Si Pe Mn Mg Ca Na fi fl 1. 50-58 27-60 0-10 085 3'73 10*26 2*96 1-26 1-73=99-07 Bergemann. 2. 50-49 28-12 0-44 0*59 2-68 1131 3\"10 P0O 1-78=99-51 Givartovskl It was massive, of a greenish-blue color, with G.=2721, Berg.; 2-65, Giv. It has been supposed to be a feldspar. Alt.\u2014 As the altered scapolites that have been derived from ekebergite or paranthite have not been distinguished from those derived from wernerite, the foUowing observations are made to include aU: In the alteration of the scapolites, one or more of the foUowing changes occur, as Ulustrated is the following analyses of different kinds : 1. The hydration of the mineraL 2. The loss of part or aU of the protoxyd bases, often effected largely through the action of carbonated waters carrying off the lime as carbonate. 3. The substitution of potash for the soda or Ume, due to the action of the carbonates in solu tion in percolating waters. 4. The increase in the amount of soda, probably by the action of carbonate of soda or chlorid of sodium in solution. 6. The introduction of oxyd of iron, through salts of Ume (organic, bicarbonate, eta) in solution. 6. The substitution of magnesia for other protoxyd bases. 7. The loss of siUca as weU as protoxyd bases. By the substitution of potash, the mineral passes either to the state of pinite (anal. 8 to 15), or to that of a potash mica (anaL 15,16). By the acquisition of iron (anal. 17, 1 8) it passes in some cases to epidote (anal. 19). By the introduction of magnesia, it may pass to steatite; or of magne sia and potash, to a magnesia mica (anaL 20). By a loss of bases, the proportion of sihca left increases (anal. 4, 5, 6, 21, 22, 23); and by a los3 of sUica also (which may become opal in its separation), the mineral passes to a kao Kn-like compound, a common result of its alteration (anal. 24). Moreover, silica may remain, and the altered crystal become by additions a siliceous pseudo morph, as occurs at Pargas. Analyses: I. Hydrous. 1, Weibye and Berlin (Pogg., lxxix. 302). II.

Russl., UL 95). Color yeUowish to light oU-green ; lustre greasy ; translucent ; H. = 55, G.= 2-79. B.B. fuses easily with intumescence. From the Sliidianka in Dauria. The analysis af forded 6'4 p. c. of carbonic acid, which is above removed ; this corresponds to 1 1 '4 p. c. of Ca C. AnaL 3. Large gray crystals, containing 9-23 p. c. of Ca C; G.=2-74. In the anal, as above given, 4'06 of C is removed. Occurs at Diana, N. Y., with sphene in calcite. AnaL 4. White crystals with calcite, from Bolton; G.=2'66. In the anal, as above given, 2-5 p. c. of C is removed. Anal. 5, reddish massive, from Bolton; G. = 270. Anal. 8, massive, yel lowish ; H=_4-5 ; G.=2787. Contains 7-80 p. c. of Ca C. From Bolton. Anal. 6. Whitish massive, from Gulsjo ; contains 3-41 Ca C ; G. = 2-69. In the anal, above, 1\"5 p. c. of C removed. Anal. 7. Greenish or yeUowish-green, cleavable, and partly in crystals, from Franklin, N. J., having H.=3-5, G.=278, with subresinous lustre ; B.B. very fusible. Contains 10-72 p. c. of Ca 0. Anal. 9. Greenish-gray, waxy in lustre to pearly, subtranslucent, with H.=5'5, G.=2'640- 2667 ; from Perth in Canada. Contains considerable magnesia as weU as potash. Anal. 10. In grayish crystals, from Diana, associated with sphene. (Not from Bolton, as an nounced ; the specimen shows by its character and the associated minerals that it is unquestion ably from Diana.) Aloerite Hunt (Am. J. Sci., II. viii. 103, 1849) (anal. 11 \u2014 13) occurs in slender square prisms, sometimes 2 or 3 in. long, imbedded in calcite. YeUowish to gray and usuaUy dulL Brittle. H. =3\u20143-5; some crystals more altered, 2'5. G. = 2'697 \u2014 2-712, Hunt; 278, Crossley. From Franklin, Sussex Co., N. J. The varying results of analyses, and the presence of carbonate of lime, of magnesia, and the relations to known examples of altered scapolite, confirm the view derived from the form and appearances, that algerite is an altered scapolite, and related to pinite. WlLSOOTTE Hunt (Logan's Rep. Can., 1853 and 1863, Am. J. Sci., II. xix. 428) (anal. 11) is a mas sive mineral from Bathurst, Canada, affording square prisms by cleavage, and having H. =3-5, G.=2765\u2014 2-776, lustre vitreous, a little pearly on cleavage surfaces; color reddish-white, rose-red, and peach-blossom red. According to Chapman (Am. J. Sci., II. xx. 269), its crystaUiza tion and other characters are essentiaUy those of scapolite. It is associated with apatite, calcite, and pyroxene. The oblique basal cleavage, mentioned by Hunt, is, as stated in the last edition of this work, p. 503, only a fracture. Hunt in Rep. G. Can. 1863 makes it a variety of gieseckite. Occurs also in northern N. York. See further under Pimte, p. 479. Terenite of Emmons (Rep. G. N. Y., 1837, 152) has the form of scapolite, with H. =2 ; G. = 2'o3; lustre a Uttle pearly ; color yeUowish-white or greenish ; and is from a smaU vein m limestone at Antwerp N Y It has not been analyzed, but is probably near algerite or wilsonite. The Pinitartigen (pinite-like) Scapolil of Schumacher (Verz., 98, 1801), from Arendal, is probably simi-"], [380, "324 OXYGEN COMPOUNDS. lar to the algerite and other pinite pseudomorphs. It is described as occurring in crystals and massive, of a white, greenish, and other shades, and as B.B. fusing easily. His Talkartiger Scapo lit, from Arendal, appears to have been a steatitic pseudomorph, it being B.B. infusible. Mica from. Arendal, Norway (Micarelle of AbUdgaard). AnaL 15, 16. The mica occurs im bedded in quartz, and has, according to v. Rath (1. c), the form of 8-sided crystals of scapoUte, 6 in. long. The crystals are covered with mica externally, and within consist throughout of an aggregation of the same mica. The mica is greenish-white, translucent. H.=2\u2014 3. G.=2-833. Oxygen ratio (from v. Rath) 1:5-6: 10-5 ; perhaps 1:6: 10 J, giving 1 : 11 for the oxygen of the bases and sUica. The change from scapohte has consisted in the removal of Ume, addition of Pe, and substitution of potash for soda. Mica from Pargas, anal. 20, is a magnesia mica. The red scapohte of Arendal (anal. 17) has H. =5; G.=2-852. Brownish or brick-red. Dif ficultly fusible. Oxygen ratio 1:2-4: 7-5. In the change, Pe, magnesia, and potash have been introduced. The black scapolite of Arendal (anaL 18) is altered by a large addition of magnesia and iron. Color grayish-black ; streak grayish-white. Rather soft. G.=2\"837. No cleavage. B.B. edges rounded with difficulty. 0. ratio 1:2-1: 2-5 : 1-6, unless part of the iron is sesquioxyd. The epidote pseudomorph of the same locality (anal. 19) gives the oxygen ratio of epidote 1:2:3. The crystals occur imbedded in uraUte. Forchhammer has described other epidote pseudomorphs after scapohte from Arendal, which are albite externally and epidote within. Gabbronite of Schumacher (Verzeichn., 1801) is referred here by S\u00e6mann, who observes that there are, in the Ecole des Mines at Paris, crystals of it of the form of scapoUte (This Min., 506, 1854). Schumacher describes it as bluish-gray, inclining to leek-green ; also grayish mountain green; lustre feeble ; fracture smooth Uke that of flint ; G.=2'947 ; having some resemblance to gabbro. The bluish-gray variety from the Kenlig mine near Arendal, with black hornblende and calcite, and the other from Fredericksvarn, Norway, in syenite. The kaolin from Malsjo, anaL 24, is a reddish-yeUow clay-Uke mass, retaining something of the crystalUne form of scapolite ; G. = 2\"l. The composition corresponds to 1 of alumina to 2 of silica. For another kaolin see under Ekebergite (Passauite). Steatitic pseudomorphs occur at Newton, N. J., and Arendal in Norway. A siliceous scapolite of Pargas, of a gray color, in hmestone, contains 92-71 p. c. of sUica. Albite is announced by Tschermak as occurring pseudomorphous after scapolite. Pseudo- Scapolite of N. Nordenskiold (Bidrag Finl. Min., 66, 1820) is wernerite altered to pyrox ene. The crystals are large and contain crystals of pyroxene, which are most abundant toward the exterior ; from Simonsby, near Pargas. 300. EKEBERGITE. Scapolite (fr. Arendal) pt. Wernerite (fr.

The prehnitoid is from a locality between Kongsberg and Solberg in Sweden, with coarsely crystaUized hornblende ; its hardness is stated by Blom strand to be 7, and G.=2-50. The name dipyre, from Sis, twice, and no, fire, aUudes to the two effects of heat, fusion nudphos phorescence. Prehnitoid refers to a resemblance to prehnite. Alt. \u2014 Dipyre undergoes very easy alteration, much easier than wernerite, and this it probably owes to the large percentage of soda. At aU the localities the mineral occurs to a large extent in a crumbling state. Some of it appears to be changed to a kind of greenish leuchtenbergite. Couseranite appears to be the same mineral in an altered form. It occurs in the same region, and the dipyre may be seen passing into couseranite. Its square prisms are usually rough or rounded exteriorly, and bluish-black or grayish-black to deep black iu color, but sometimes whit ish and blackish on the same specimen. It is often soft and fragUe. Charpentier's mineral came from the department of Ariege (formerly Couserans). Analyses : 1, Dufrenoy (Ann. d.

Obs. \u2014 Nephelite occurs both in ancient and modern volcanic rocks, and also metamorphic rocks aUied to granite and gneiss, the former mostly iu glassy crystals or grains (sommite), the latter massive or in stout crystals (el\u00e6olite). A doleryte containing much disseminated nepheline, such as occurs at Katzenbuckel, near Heidelberg, has been called nephelinophyre and nephelindoteryte. A granite-like rock found near Miask, in which el\u00e6oUte replaces quartz, has been named miascyte, from its locality. A rock composed of orthoclase, el\u00e6olite, and sodalite, from Ditro in Transyl vania, is the ditroyte of Tschermak. The zircon-syenite of Norway contains much el\u00e6oUte. Nephelite occurs in crystals in the older lavas of Somma, with mica, idocrase, etc. ; at Capo di Bove, near Rome (the locahty of the pseudo-nepheline) ; in the clinkstone of Katzenbuckel, near Heidelberg ; at Hamberg in Hessia ; Aussig in Bohemia ; Lobau in Saxony. El\u00e6oUte is found at Brevig, Stavern, and Fredericksvarn, Norway, imbedded in zircon-syenite ; in the Ilmen Mts., Hrals, along with white feldspar, brown hexagonal mica, zircon, pyrochlore, etc.; at Mariens kaja in the Tunkinsk Mts., Siberia, with graphite, caucrinite, zircon. The crystal measured by Soacchi was of the variety sommite, or davyne, occurring at Somma in a geode in Umestone with sodahte (Pogg. Erganz., iu. 478, 1858). El\u00e6oUte occurs massive and crystalUzed at Litchfield, Me., with cancrinite ; in the Ozark Mts., Arkansas, with brookite and schorlomite ; in a boulder, with sodalite, at Salem, Mass. Named nepheline by Hauy (1801), from vsijie\\fi, a cloud, in aUusion to its becoming cloudy when immersed in strong acid; d\u00e6olite (by Klaproth), from .X_f_\u00ab, oil, in aUusion to its greasy lustre, the variety having been made a distinct species earlier by Werner (1808), under the German name of Fettstein. The name sommite, derived from the Vesuvian locality, given in 1797 by Delametherie, has the priority. But Werner early adopted Haiiy's name, and later authors have aU taken the same course."], [385, "UNISILICATES. 329 A mineral from Norway, of a yeUowish-brown color, called pkonite, is very much Uke el\u00e6olite, according to Descloizeaux. Alt. \u2014 Nephelite or el\u00e6oUte is Uable to ready alteration, and usuaUy produces a zeolite, as thom sonite. The Ozarkite of Shepard, according to Smith and Brush, is thomsoniie (q. v.), and its situa tion in cavities in el\u00e6olite shows that it is a product of alteration. The large amouut of soda in nephelite compared with the sihca fits it especiaUy for generating zeoUtes. Blum attributes berg mannite to the alteration of el\u00e6olite (Pogg., lxxxvn. 315, and cv. 133). Gieseckite is shown by Blum to be a pseudomorph after this species. It differs mainly in con tainiug several per cent, of water. It occurs in six-sided greenish-gray prisms of greasy lustre, in Greenland, having 0 A 1 = 135\u00b0 nearly; and also at Diana, in Lewis Co., N. V., with the same angles, for the most part, although the results of measurement vary between 131\u00b0 and 139\u00b0. The crystals of Diana are hexagonal in cleavage ; yet the planes of cleavage are often separated by layers of a waxy appearance, without lustre or cleavage. According to Descloizeaux, the material of the crystals acts on polarized light like a gum or coUoid, and is evidently a result of alteration. Liebenerite, from the valley of Fleims, in the Tyrol, is considered by Blum a simUar pseudomorph, and Descloizeaux sustains this conclusion. See further Pinite, under Hydkous Silicates. El\u00e6oUte has been observed altered also 'to mica and opaL Davyne is regarded as altered nephelite, due to the introduction of carbonic acid, as stated above ; and cancrinite is supposed lo have had the same origin. 304A.

Cancrinite is closely like nephelite in crystaUine form, and it is probably identical with it in atomic ratio, excepting the carbonate and water, which may be due, as stated, to alteration. Davyne is intermediate in composition, and differs only in that it has the carbonic acid combined with Ume alone. Whitney found a trace of chlorine in his analyses. The red color of the Miask cancrinite is due to disseminated grains of hematite, according to Kenngott, who also found calcite in micro scopic grains, and suggests that this may be the source of the carbonic acid of cancrinite.

It is a constituent in the nephelin-doleryte of Merches in the Vogelsberg (anal. 21) ; abundant in trachyte between Lake Laach and Andernach, on the Rhine. Vesuvius presents the finest and largest crystaUizations. Near Rome, at Borghetta to the north, and Albano and Frascati to the south, some of the older lavas appear to be almost entirely composed of it. The leucitic lava of the neighborhood of Rome has been used for the last two thousand years, at least, iu the formation of miU-stones. MUl-stones of this rock have been discovered in the excavations at PompeiL Named by Werner from Ae.K.s, white, in aUusion to its color. Haiiy's name, Amphigene, is of later date, and is from _^i, both, and ytwaoi, to make, in allusion to the existence of cleavage in two directions (which is not a fact), and to his inference therefrom of two \"primitive forms\" (which is only a notion of his); and it has therefore the best of claims for rejection. Alt. \u2014 Feldspar, nephelite, and kaolin occur with the form of leucite, as a result of its altera tion. The glassy feldspar pseudomorphs were first announced by Scacchi, and since by Blum.

FELDSPAR GROUP. The feldspars are characterized by specific gravity below 2*85 ; hardness 6 to 7 ; fusibility 3 to 5 ; oblique or clinohedral crystallization ; prismatic angle near 120\u00b0 ; two easy cleavages, one basal, the other brachydiagonal, inclined together either 90\u00b0, or very near 90\u00b0 ; cleavage a prominent fea ture of many massive kinds, and distinct in the grains of granular varieties, giving them angular forms ; close isomorphism, and a general resemblance in the systems of occurring crystalline forms ; twinning parallel to the clino diagonal section and O, and sometimes 2-. (or the corresponding triclinic planes) ; transition from granular varieties to compact, hornstone-like kinds, called felsites, which sometimes occur as rocks ; often opalescent, or having a"], [392, "336 OXYGEN COMPOUNDS. play of colors as seen in a direction a little oblique to i-l ; often aventurine, from the dissemination of microscopic crystals of foreign substances parallel for the most part to the planes 0 and I. The protoxyd bases are lime, soda, potash, and in one species baryta ; the sesquioxyd only alumina ; the oxygen ratio of the protoxyds and sesquiox yds is constant, 1:3; while that ot the silica and bases varies from 1 : 1 to 3 : 1, the amount of silica increasing with the increase of alkali, and becom ing greatest when alkalies are the only protoxyds. The included species are as follows : CrystaUization. 0. ratio R, B, Si. A_jorthite Lime feldspar Triclinic 1:3:4 Labradorite Lime-soda feldspar 1:3:6 Hy alophA-TE Baryta-potash feldspar MonocUnic 1:3:8 Andesite Soda-lime feldspar Triclinic 1:3:8 Oligoclase \" \" \" \" 1:3:9 Albite Soda feldspar \" 1 : 3 : 12 Orthoclase Potash feldspar Monoclinic 1:3:12 The species appear in the analyses beyond to shade into one another by gradual transitions ; but whether this is the actual fact, or whether the seeming transitions (when not from bad anal yses) are due to mixtures of different kinds through contemporaneous crystaUization, is not pos itively ascertained. The latter is the most reasonable view. It has been shown by Breithaupt and others that orthoclase and albite (or the potash and soda feldspars) occur together in infini tesimal interlami nations osthe two species, and that the soda-potash variety caUed perthite (p. 356) is one of those thus constituted. This structure is apparent under a magnifying power, and also when specimens are examined by means of polarized light. Moreover, these and other feldspars very commonly occur side by side or intercrystaUized when not interlaminated ; as oUgoclase and orthoclase in the granite of Orange Summit, N. Hampshire, and Danbury, Conn. ; in obsidian in Mexico ; in trachytes of other regions. Such facts show that the idea of indefinite shadings be tween the species is probably a false one, since the two keep themselves distinct, and, in the perthite and similar cases, even to microscopic perfection. They also make manifest that contem poraneous crystallization is a true cause in many cases. Intermediate varieties may also come through alteration under the agency of infiltrating waters. Water filtrated through powdered feldspar of any kind soon becomes alkaline by taking up part of the bases. Moreover there is a strong tendency to alteration, and the final production of kaolin, a change involving the loss of aU the protoxyd bases, and also much of the sUica, the oxy gen ratio of the sUica and alumina being thus reduced to 1 : 1, from 3 : 1 in orthoclase or albite, and from 2 : 1 in labradorite. The species andesite is stiU a doubtful one. The play of colors, especiaUy remarkable in much labradorite, and occurring also in some adularia, albite, and oUgoclase, indicates, according to Reusch (Pogg., cxvi. 392, cxviu. 256, cxx. 95), the existence of a cleavage structure of extreme delicacy transverse to the median or brachydiagonal section. In adularia the plane of this cleavage is perpendicular to this section (or that of the clinodiagonal); in labradorite it is in general more or less inclined, and differently in different specimens. The play of color, Reusch observes, appears therefore to be that of thm plates; yet the linings of what he regards as a cleavage system appear to be of indis tinguishable minuteness ; and although the existence of thin plates can hardly be established by means of the microscope, it is proved by their effects in the play of colors, nebulous images within, and the phenomena of inflexion or diffraction which result from their regular grouping. There ap pears to be no connection between the inclination of the plane in labradorite and the colors observed. The play of colors is best seen on a plate poUshed paraUel to the brachydiagonal section (i-T), when, as Descloizeaux states, it is turned to the right or left on an axis slightly oblique to the face, which extends toward the obtuse angle between the edges O/i-l and I' /i-l, and makes an angle of about 70\u00b0 with the edge O/i-l; and the maximum effect is produced iu two positions situated 45' to 50\u00b0 from one another, which are unequaUy inclined to the face i-i. The play of colors is independent of the disseminated microscopic crystals of foreign substances which occasion the aventurine effect. The feldspars are intimately related to the isometric species of the Leucite group. Leucite has the oxygen ratio 1:8:8, one of the feldspar ratios ; so that isometric leucite, monocUnic hy alophane, and triclinic andesite (if this species is sustained), form a trimorphous group. But"], [393, "337 UNISILICATES. while the form of leucite appears at first sight to be very unlike that of the true feldspars, there is actuaUy approximate isomorphism. For the monoclinic and triclinic forms are strictly oblique or clinohedrized dodecahedrons.* If a dodecahedron be so placed that an octahedral axis, that is, the Une between the apices of two of the trihedral solid angles, is vertical, it is then a six-sided prism with trihedral summits. If now this axis be incUned 8\u00b0 6' in one osthe 296 diametral planes of the six-sided prism, it will have the inclination of the axis of orthoclase ; and this 8\u00b0 6' is the greatest amount of divergence from the dodecahedral angles that occurs in the species. The planes /, i-i incline to one another at angles near 120\u00b0, and correspond to the 6 vertical planes of the dodecahedron (as above placed). The basal plane 0 is also dodecahedric, for 0 A 1= 1 22\u00b0 16', and O A i-l (dodecahe dric)=90\u00b0. The four planes 1 are also dodecahedric, as shown by their position and inclinations. Thus aU the twelve faces of the dode cahedron occur in the above figure ; they are lettered D. Again, the planes i-i and 1-i, which replace the edges between the dodecahedric planes I, i-i and 1, 1, with angles near 150\u00b0, correspond to planes of the trapezohedron 2-2 (that truncating the dodecahedron, f. 14), and consequently the figure contains six trapezohedric planes ; they are lettered T. Again, the planes 2-i are cubic; for they make with the dodecahe dric plane 0 the angle 135\u00b0 3', varying but 3' from the isometric angle. 2-i is another cubic face ; it is inclined to Ij a dodecahedric plane, 134\u00b0 19'. There are present, therefore, all six faces of the cube ; they are lettered H. PinaUy the plane J-i, at the top of the figure (and the only remaining one), lettered O, is octahe drie, as shown by its intersections with the cubic, dodecahedric, and trapezohedric faces ; and also by its inclination to the cubic face 2-i=124\u00b0 51', and to the dodecahedric face 7=145\u00b0 47', these angles in isometric forms being 125\u00b0 16' and 144\u00b0 44'. It foUows then that the above figure contains the dodecahedric planes I, I, i-i, 0, 1, 1, with their opposites, or the whole twelve ; the trapezohedric i-i, i-i, 1-i, with their opposites, or six ; the odaliedric, i-i, with its opposite, or two ; and the cubic 2-i, 2-i, 2-i, or all six; and uo others. The angles of the oblique cube are 2-i A 2-i, over 0,=9O\u00b0 6', 2-i A 2-i=96\u00b0 48'. Moreover, the normal apex of the clinohedrized dodecahedron is that part of the crystal occupied by the octahedric plane \u00a7-i ; in other words, f-i is normaUy the basal plane, and not 0 ; and the true inchnation of the vertical axis is 8\u00b0 6' (the angle f-i A i-i being 98\u00b0 6'). Accordingly the two cleavages in orthoclase, paraUel to 0 and i-i, are both dodecahedric. Moreover, the directions of twinning are either dodecahedric (paraUel to i-i, which is the most common, and 0), or cubic (paraUel to 2-i). These relations hold true also for the triclinic feldspars, the only pecuUarity in which is that the principal section has slight lateral obhquity, so that the two cleavage planes (dodecahedric) incline to one another 93\u00b0 16' to 94\u00b0 15' instead of 90\u00b0. G. Rose, in au article on albite (Pogg., cxxv. 457), aUudes to the remarkable fact that the planes 2-i (see p. 349), either side of 0, make with one another in this species very nearly a right angle (90\u00b0 35', Neumann, aud 90\u00b0 4', Descloi zeaux). The fact is not so surprising when it is observed that the planes 2-i are cubic faces. They correspond to 2-i in orthoclase. 310. ANORTHITE. INDIANITE.

The species had been described by him as early as 1802 (1. a), and his description is remarkably complete for the time, it including, besides physical characters, a chemical analysis by Chenevix (anal. 1 above) agreeing nearly in essential points with the later by Rose, and quite as weU as his, with the true or normal composition of the mineral. Bournon supposed that the grains might be rhombohedral in crystaUization ; but Brooke, in PhiUips' Mineralogy (3d ed.), pubUshed in 1823, the year of Rose's publication, an nounced that there were two cleavages, inclined to one another 84\u00b0 45' and 95\u00b0 15', differing not widely from the same angle ( 0 A i-i) as ascertained by Rose. Justice seems to require that Bournon's name should be restored to the species. Beudant, in the first edition of his mineralogy, published in 1824, describes indianite in fuU and caUed it Ume-feldspar, mentioning anorthite only in his index. Christianite was named by Monticelli and CoveUi after the prince Christian Friedrick of Den mark, who explored Vesuvius with them ; Amphodelite from oiup,, double, and __.Aos, spear, the crystals being often twinned paraUel to i-l ; Latrobite, after C. F. Latrobe, the discoverer of the variety. For recent observations on cryst, see Descl. Min., i. 294 ; Hessenb. Min. Not, No. i. 6; Websky, ZS. G, xvi. 530 ; Kokscharof, Bull. Ac. St. Pet., vii. 326.

Pyr., etc B.B. fuses at 3 to a colorless glass. Decomposed with difficulty by muriatic acid, generaUy leaving a portion of undecomposed mineral. Obs.\u2014 Labradorite is a constituent of some rocks. (1) The cleavable mineral, along with hornblende, composes a granite-Uke variety of diabase, or a rock resembling dioryte, but having labradorite as the feldspar. (2) If the hornblendic constituent is a dark lamellar variety of either hornblende or pyroxene, or the species hypersthene, the rock is caUed hyperyte (or hyper sthenyte). (3) If the hornblendic mineral is a light lamellar pyroxene (diaUage), the rock is caUed gabbro. (4) If the hornblende and labradorite constitute a homogeneous fine-grained compact mass, the rock is called amphibolyte or diabase; and (5) if the diabase contains distinct crystals of porphyry, it is a diabase porphyry, the green porphyry or oriental verd-antique of Greece (anal. 25) being of this nature. (6) The crypto-crystaUine, or felsite variety of labradorite, occurring occasionaUy in connection with some of these rocks, has been called incorrectly saussurite and jade or nephrite. The above are labradoric metamorphic rocks. ' There are also the foUowing labradoric intrusive rocks. (7) Doleryte, consisting of labradorite and pyroxene, with generaUy some magnetite\u2014 a rock which, on the one hand, may be light-col ored crystaUine or granitoid, and on the other, dark-colored compact massive, either porphyrite or not, sometimes crypto-crystaUine, and also a ceUular lava ; it includes much of the so-called trap, greenstone, and amygdaloid. (8) Basalt, similar to doleryte in structure, colors, and varieties, but 'containing, in additiou to labradorite and pyroxene, chrysolite in disseminated grains. Dole rytic and basaltic lavas' are the most common of volcanic rocks. (9) Labradorite also occurs in other kinds of lava, and is sometimes found in them in glassy crystals, as in those of Etna and Vesuvius. The labradoric metamorphic rocks are most common among the formations of the Azoic or pre- SUurian era. Such are part of those of British America, northern New York, Pennsylvania, Arkansas ; those of Greenland, Norway, Finland, Sweden, and probably of the Vosges. Being a feldspar containing comparatively Uttle sUica, it occurs mainly in rocks which include little or no quartz (free sUica). Many foreign locaUties are mentioned above. On the coast of Labrador, labradorite is associated with hornblende, hypersthene, and magnet- ite. It is met with in place at MiUe Isles, Chateau Richer, Rawdon, Morin, Abercrombie, and elsewhere, in Canada East ; and in boulders at Drummond and elsewhere, Canada West. It occurs abundantly at Essex Co., N. Y. ; large boulders are met with in the towns of Moriah, Newcomb, M'Intyre, Westport, and Lewis, N. Y. ; also occasionally in Orange, Lewis, St. Law- rence, Warren, Scoharie, and Green Cos. In Pennsylvania, at Mineral Hill, Chester Co., and op- posite New Hope, Bucks Co. ; in the Witchita Mts., Arkansas. Silicite and mornite are from Antrim, Ireland. Labradorite was first brought from the Isle of Paul, on the coast of Labrador, by Mr. Wolfe, a Moravian missionary, about the year 1770, and was caUed by the early mineralogists Labrador stone (Labradorslein), and also chatoyant, opaUne, or Labrador feldspar. Klaproth's analysis above (No. 1) was the first one made (in 1815). Labradorite receives a fine polish, and owing to the chatoyant reflections, the specimens are often highly beautiful. It is sometimes used in jewelry. Alt\u2014 Labradorite, like anorthite, appears to undergo alteration with considerable facihty, it losing lime through infiltrating carbonated or alkaline waters, and receiving water. In some cases, also, it has received considerable iron. The foUowing analyses appear to be of specimens of this altered labradorite. The results are remarkable for either the smaU proportion of lime or large proportion of iron, or the same of potash or of water, each of which may be regarded as an indication of alteration.

Its inferior hardness would indicate alteration. The albite from Pennsylvania, analyzed by Redteubacher (anal. 1 9), is caUed oligoclase-albite by Scheerer; it gives the O. ratio I'l : 3 : 11*7. He appUes the same name to the Snarum feldspar analyzed by Richter, which he says has the external form of scapolite, and G.=2*59; oxygen ratio 1:3: 11'3. It is the olafile. That of Snarum, analyzed by Scheidtauer, was in snow-white crystals, and gave 1-2 : 3 : 118; it holds an excess of protoxyds, owing to the lime present, which may be a result of alteration. Felsite or compact feldspar has usually some free sUica disseminated through it. The foUow ing are analyses of some kinds, either albite-felsile or oligoclase-felsite. The presence of lime is in favor of the latter. Adinole is probably albitic ; it is reddish, from Sala, Sweden. Amausite Ger hard has been considered as oligoclase in base ; the name was given to a granulite (Weissstein) of Namiest in Moravia.

It occurs with orthoclase in some granite, as in that of Pompey's PiUar, and in such cases is usually distinguishable by its greater whiteness. It is common also in gneiss, and some times in the crystalline schists. Veins of albitic granite are often repositories of the rarer granite minerals and of fine crystaUizations of gems, including beryl, tourmaline, aUanite, columbite, etc. It occurs also in some trachyte, as that of Montagna, Island of PanteUaria; in phonoUte, at Lan gas jaU, Iceland ; in granular limestone in disseminated crystals, as near Modane m Savoy. In the compact condition, felsite, it constitutes the base of albite porphyry, a rock sometimes red (as at Agay) with scattered whitish crystals of albite ; also the same of some spilyte, as at Frejus, a compact grayish rock, containing globules of carbonate of lime, the base of which, ac cording to Diday, is 70 p. c. albite ; also of some granulyte or weissstein (white stone). - Many localities of albite are mentioned above. It occurs with epidote and garnet at Arendal; with eudialyte and hornblende in Greenland. In the United States, in Maine, at Paris, with red and blue tourmalines. In Mass., at Chester field, with the same minerals, in lameUar masses (clcavelandite), slightly bluish, also fine granular, and rarely in smaU crystals; at Goshen. In New Hamp., at Acworth and Alstead. In Conn., at Haddam, with chrysoberyl, beryl, columbite, and black tourmaline ; at the Middletown feldspar quarry, in fine transparent or translucent crystals (fig. 305) ; at Monroe, a fine granular variety containing beryl. In N. York, at GranvUle, Washington Co., white transparent crystals ; at Moriah, Essex Co., of a greenish color, with smoky quartz, and resembUng green diallage. In Penn., at Unionville, Delaware Co., a granular variety is the matrix of the corundum (see anals. 20 and 21), having the hardness of quartz (7 \u2014 7-25). It had been taken for indianite. A simUar variety, equaUy hard, is found with idocrase at Sansord, Maine. In California, Calaveras Co., with native gold and auriferous pyrites. In Canada, in fine crystals, at the Suffield sUver mine, near L. Massawippi, N E. of L. Mem phremagog. The name Albite is derived from albus, white, in aUusion to its color, and was given the species by Gahn and Berzelius in 1814. For recent observations on cryst, Descl. Min., i. 317; Hessenberg, Min.

The orthoclase of Carlsbad contains rubidium. The varieties depend mainly on structure, variations in angles, the presence of soda, and the presence of impurities. The amount of soda detected by analyses varies greatly, the ratio to the potash being from 1 : 100 to 1 : J-. But recent chemical investigations have shown, what Breithaupt indicated from ocular examination in 1861, that some of the sodiferous varieties owe the soda to a erystaUme combination of the orthoclase with albite. The perthite (see beyond) has thus been found to con sist of thin alternate layers of these two feldspars. How far this explanation extends to other sodiferous kinds remains to be ascertained. The variations in angles are large, and they occur sometimes even in specimens of the same locality. In crystals of the kind called chesterlite, which are to all appearance regular and undis torted, the angle I' (right prismatic plane) A /(left id.) varies from 121\u00b0 to 127\u00b0, according to the author's measurements ; and other angles make the form triclinic, 0 A I and 0 A I' sometimes differing 5\u00b0, one being 110\u00b0 and the other 115\u00b0; whUe twins compounded paraUel to the clino diagonal section, which are common, prove, by the absence of any reentering angle on the base, that the form is not triclinic (although so made by Breithaupt, who refers the specie3 (B. H. Ztg., xvii. 1 ) to albite). The crystaUization is normaUy monocUnic, and the variations are simply irreg ularities. There are also large optical variations in orthoclase, on which see Descl. Min., L 1129. The variations in amount of soda aud in angles have led Breithaupt to make several species out of the species orthoclase. But untU it is proved that crystals of certain specific angles have uniformly the same specific chemical composition, and further, that kinds having the same specific chemical composition wherever occurring, always, when crystaUized, present the same angles, such species cannot properly be recognized as distinct. The varieties that have been named are the foUowing: Var. 1. Ordinary. In crystals, or cleavable massive, (a) Adularia.

The original was found by Hayden near the York and Lancaster road, 21 m. from Baltimore, in granular limestone, and was whitish or bluish in color. Named from i>\u00bbp.;, a corpse. (d) Amazonstone. Bright verdigris-green, and cleavable. (e) Erythrite. Flesh-red, from amygdaloid, near Kllpatrick. Made out by Thomson to contain 3 p. c. of magnesia. Named from ie-So-s, red. (J) Sanidin of Nose, or glassy feldspar, including much of the Ice-spar, part of which is anorthite. Occurs in transparent glassy crystals, mostly tabular (whence the name from -nm*, a board) in lava, pumice, trachyte, phonolite, etc. Proportion of soda to potash varies from 1 : 20 to 2 : 1. A Mitscherlich finds in some kinds 0-79 \u2014 2-33 p. c. of baryta. Rhyacolite is the same; the name was applied to glassy crystals from Mt Somma (Eisspath Wern). Rose has since observed (Kryst Ch Min., 88) that the specimen he analyzed (Pogg., xxvui. 143) probably contained some mixed nepheUte, and that the mineral is orthoclase.

Usually in cleavable masses, whitish, grayish, or reddish, and opalescent The original was from the zircon-syenite of Fredericksvarn and Laurvig and Brevig, Norway. Brei thaupt made the angle between the two cleavage planes 90\u00b0 22'\u2014 90\u00b0 23', instead of 90\u00b0; and hence derived the name, from //i*p.s, Uttle, and Mua, I incline. The analysis (No. 55) gives for the ratio of Na to K 3 : 2. But Breithaupt has since referred to microclin the feldspar of Arendal, which afforded him the same angle, but yet contains but a trace of soda (No. 22). He also refers here a feldspar from Kangerdluarsuk, Greenland (anal. 54), which is near the first-mentioned in composition, and gave the angles O A _-i=90\u00b0 22', 0 A 1=112\u00b0 9', O A_\" = 113\u00b0 10', O A l-i= 129\u00b0 34', i-i A 7' = 119\u00b0 13' I A _\"=119\u00b0 4', I A i-i = 121\u00b0 43' ; also the feldspar of the micaceous rock (called Miascyte) of Miask (Urals), which has Na : I_=l : 1, with an excess of silica, accord ing to an unsatisfactory analysis ; also a Bodenmais feldspar of gray and greenish colors, with G. =2*575\u20142*594, but he suggests that Kerndt's analysis (No. 56) was probably made on a mixture of microclin and ohgoclase, the two occurring together ; while Potyka found that the green variety (anal. 25) contained little soda. Potyka also states that the actual form was .triclinic, and that the cleavage face had the usual stri\u00e6 of triclinic feldspars; but Kenngott observes (Ueb., 1861, 73) that he did not find the stri\u00e6 on a Bodenmais specimen, and H. Fischer none on the feldspar of the zircon-syenite. Other loc. reported by him are : Lewis Co., N. Y., with black pyroxene ; Baveno in Italy ; Lomnitz and Fischbach in SUesia, of red color ; Scholtzenberg and Kunersdorf, Silesia; Olbern-hau in Silesia, grayish-white, G.=2-593 ; SforzeUa in Predazzo, white, G.=2-596 ; syenite of the Plaueu-Grund, near Dresden \u2014 au extension of its distribution which must make it easy to test the value of its distinctive characters. Notwithstanding the measurements of Breithaupt, microclin is probably monocUnic. Descloi zeaux, after optical investigations (Min., L 341), refers it to orthoclase. It is to be observed that these angles were obtained from kinds having little soda as weU as others having much. More over, loxoclase, in which the amount of soda is stiU larger, is monoclinic. (i) Loxoclase. In grayish-white or yeUowish crystals, a Uttle pearly or greasy in lustre, oOften large, feebly shining, lengthened usually in the direction of the clinodiagonal.

H. Ztg., xxv. 39) it contains 8 p. c. of soda to 5 of potash. But Eedner and Bulk have found (anal. 14, 1 5) that it is an ordinary potash-feldspar with over 14 p. c. of potash, and has G.=2'55 \u2014 2-573. (I) His Muldan is from Mulda near Freiberg; it is stated to have _\"' A.-i = 117\u00b0, I' a i-i = 116\u00b0, OA_=116\u00b0 \u2014 116J\u00b0, Oa/' = 117\u00b0; G.=2'54\u2014 2-56. MoU's analysis (No. 12) shows that it is common orthoclase, although irregular in its angles. (m) Lazurfeldspar (Lasurfeldspath), a feldspar having H.=6, and G. = 2'597, and the cleavage of orthoclase, found near Lake Baikal with lapis lazuli. (n) Perthite. A flesh-red aventurine feldspar, consisting of interlaminated albite and ortho clase, as shown beyond. From Perth, Canada East. (o) Murchisonite is simUar flesh-red feldspar to perthite, with gold-yellow reflections in one di rection, like sunstone ; and stated to have also an unusual cleavage direction besides the two ob served. From Dawlish and Exeter, England. Named after its discoverer, Murchison the geologist. Weissigite, of Jenzsch, is in smaU whitish or reddish-white twin crystals, and is from the cavi ties of amygdaloid at Weissig near Dresden; G.=2-538\u2014 2-546. I. Lea has named (Proc. Ac. Philad., May, 1866) a greenish orthoclase from Lenui, Delaware Co., Pa., \"almost without cleav age,\" lennilite ; other specimens of the same locality, pearly and distinctly cleavable, delawarite ; and a dull bluish-green subtransparent kind, of an aventurine character, containing minute parti cles bright and hexagonal (hematite?) from Blue HU1, 2 m. N. of Media, Pa., cassinite. These are announced only as varieties of orthoclase ; but their distinctive characters are not such as to entitle them to special names. There is no place in the science of Mineralogy for names so given. 2. Compact Oethoolase or Okthoclase-felsite. This crypto-crystalline variety is common and occurs of various colors, from white and brown to deep red. There are two kinds (a) the jasper-like, with a subvitreous lustre ; and (.) the ceratoid or wax-like, with a waxy lustre. Some red kinds look closely like red jasper, but are easily distinguished by the fusibihty. The orthoclase differs from the albite felsite in containing much more potash than soda. Leelite, named after J. F. Lee, is a deep, flesh-red variety, of waxy lustre, from Grjphyttan, Sweden. The Swedish name Halleflinta means false flint A.

Phillips, in an imperfect analysis of murchisonite (PhU. Mag. & Ann., i. 448), obtained Si 68\"6, __1 16-6, K 14'8. The mineral came from Dawlish, and is evidently orthoclase. The perthite afforded Gerhard (ZS. G., xiv. 151) the same composition as obtained by Hunt, viz.: Si 65-83, __1 18-45, Pe 1-72, Ca tr., Na 5-06, K 8-54, ign. 0-32=99-92. But he found, fur ther, that it was divisible into thin reddish and whitish layers, which were respectively orthoclase and albite. These layers afforded him (1. c.) : Si \u00a31 Pe Ca Na _C 1-90 tr. 2-25 1216=99-94 D47 tr. 8-50 3-34=99-06 1. Red layers, Orthoclase 65*36 18*27 2. White layers, Albite 67-23 18-52 Thus proving that the supposed soda- orthoclase is really an intercrystaUization of two hom\u0153c morphous species ; and suggesting that other similar auomahes among the feldspars may have an analogous origin. The O. ratio in No. 1 is 0-94 : 3 : 12-49; in No. 2, 0-96 : 3 : 12-09. An orthoclase, monocUnic in crystals and cleavage, fr. the nephelin-doleryte of Vogelsgebirge. afforded A. Knop (Jahrb.

The mineral is remarkable for the small amount of silica, large of alumina, and the presence of baryta. The pecuUar constitution may be a result of partial alteration, or of crystaUinic mixture ; which is true is not ascertained. It is intermediate between orthoclase and hyalophane.

Pyr., etc. \u2014 B.B. fuses at 5 ; varieties containing much soda are more fusible. Loxoclase fusea at 4. Not acted upon by acids. Obs. \u2014 Orthoclase is an essential constituent of many rocks. 1. Granular crystalline. Granite and gneiss, which consist of orthoclase, quartz, and mica. Mica schist, the same with less orthoclase and more mica. Syenite and syenitic gneiss, like the preceding, but containing hornblende in place of mica. Granulyte, a mixture of granular ortho clase and more or less quartz. Albitic granite, a granite containing albite as well as orthoclase. A similar rock contains oligoclase in place of albite. Pyroxenyte, a rock consisting of orthoclase and pyroxene. Miascyte, a granular slaty rock consisting of orthoclase and el\u00e6olite, from Miask in the Ural. These rocks contain the orthoclase in cleavable grains, and sometimes also in dis tinct disseminated crystals ; when the latter is the case the rock is said to be porphyritic. Tbe finest and largest crystals of orthoclase occur in granitic or feldspathic veins. 2. Compact cryptocrystalline. Orthoclase-/-to'fe, or leelite, already described. It sometimes con tains quartz in disseminated grains ; and Durocher has observed cases in which a felsite graduated into a granite or granulyte. As the rock was originally a clayey rock (derived from the wear (not the decomposition) osthe minerals of granitic rocks) it is natural that there should be the tran sition here mentioned. The feldspar in some of the analyses below may be partly of oligoclase or albite. The hdlleflinta of Sweden is for the most part here included. As the granular orthoclase rocks, granite, gneiss, and the like, graduate into others con taining hornblende, such as syenite, syenitic gneiss, etc., so the compact orthoclase-felsites may graduate into others that are hornblendic, though not visibly so ; \u2014 and these last wUl indicate their hornblendic composition, not merely by their composition as ascertained by chemical analy sis, but also by their high specific gravity. The spherules of variolyte of a white, grayish, or greenish-white color, are mostly a compact feldspar or felsite of some kind. Porphyry, in part, consisting of a felsite base with disseminated opaque crystals of orthoclase; but this felsite base is seldom pure orthoclase. Iu the green antique porphyry, it is an intimate mixture of orthoclase and hornblende. [The feldspar is oligoclase or albite in some porphyry.] Phonolyie (or cUnkstone), a compact grayish rock, often containing crystals of glassy feldspar, and having a zeolite in the base aloug with orthoclase. [In some phonolite the feldspar is oligoclase.] Trachyte, a grayish igneous rock of rough fracture, iutermediate between phonolite and a gran ular crystaUine rock, it owing its roughness of surface largely to the grains of glassy feldspar which mainly constitute it. Argillyte and talcose schist generaUy contain more or less of orthoclase in a cryptocry stalline or un distinguishable state. Often, however, as analyses show, the alkalies are mostly wanting; and when so, the amount of feldspar is smaU ; and it may be whoUy absent. 3. Amorphous. Obsidian or volcanic glass is sometimes an impure orthoclase in a glassy state ; and in other cases it is a mixture of orthoclase or labradorite and augite with chrysoUte and much iron, the materials varying with the lavas of a volcano ; for any lava wUl become glassy, and thus make obsidian, by rapid coohng. G. = 2-25 \u2014 2-8. Pitchstone has the lustre of pitch rather than glass; pearlstone has a pearly lustre, and is some times in spherules (spherulite), or consists of spheroidal concretions. G. = 2-3 \u2014 2-4. The spher ules of pyromeride, porphyry, etc., are quite simUar, though usuaUy having an excess of sUica from mixed quartz. Pitchstone and pearlstone are sometimes in composition albite or oligoclase rocks rather than orthoclase, that is, contain soda, or soda and lime, instead of potash. See analyses below. Fuchs has suggested that these rocks derive their glassy portion from solidified water-glass and not from the fusion of a feldspar. Krablite Forchhammer, or BauUte, appears to be a siliceous feldspathic mineral related to these concretions. It forms the basis of the trachyte, obsidian, and pitchstone of Iceland.

Alt. \u2014 Feldspar may be altered through infiltrating waters carrying more or less carbonic acid in solution (Forchhammer, Fournet, Bischof); also through the action of waters rendered acid by the decomposition of sulphids (Mitscherlich) ; also by ordinary waters holding traces of alkahne and other ingredients in solution (Bischof). The presence of a sulphid of iron, or a mineral containing protoxyd of iron, as some mica, garnet, etc., is often the first occasion of the change. Tbe decomposition of the mineral with the attendant oxydation of the iron distributes ferruginous waters through the rock (or sulphate of iron from the altered sulphid), and thus, by a disaggregating or decomposing action, prepares the way for other agencies.

When the infiltrating waters contain traces of carbonic acid, the feldspar acted on fiist loses its lime, if a lime feldspar, by a combination of the lime with this acid ; next, its alkalies are carried off as carbonates, if the supply of carbonic acid continues, or otherwise as silicates in solution. The change thus going on ends in forming kaolin or some other hydrous silicate. The carbonate of soda or potash, or the silicate of these bases, set freo, may go to tlie formation of other minerals \u2014 the production of pseudomorphic or metamorphic changes \u2014 and the supplying fresh and marine waters with their saline ingredients. Kaolin is generally a simple hydrous sUicate of alumina (see Kaolinite), expressed by the /ormula _tl Si2 + 2 fl=Silica 46'3, alumina 89'S, water 13'9. Orthoclase in changing to it loses 1 __+ | Si. Part of tho sUica set free may go off with more or less of the potash, or may form opal, quartz, siliceous sinter. The alumina also is often in part removed. The same explanation is readUy appUed to the change in albite or other feldspars. When the change is not carried on to the exclusion of the protoxyd bases, certain zeolites may result, especiaUy, as Bischof states, when labradorite is the feldspar undergoing alteration, which species he describes as giving origin to the species mesolite. Massive nepheline or el\u00e6oUte is a stUl more common sourco of zeolites. Anal. 52, by Scheerer, is of orthoclase enveloping the zeolite bergmannite, and 53, of the same enclosed in bergmannite, this zeolite having apparently been formed out of other portions of the orthoclase. When the waters contain traces of a magnesian salt \u2014 a bicarbonate or sUicate \u2014 the magnesia may replace the lime or soda, and so lead to a steatitic change, or to a talc when the alumina is excluded ; and when augite or hornblende is present, it may give origin to chlorite. The action of sulphurous acid from volcanic fumaroles pioduces often a complete destruction of the feldspar and other minerals present, giving rise to deposits or incrustations of silica, in some of its various forms, and also haUoysite, kaolin, etc. Steatite, talc, chlorite, kaohn, Uthomarge, mica, laumontite, occur as pseudomorphs after ortho clase or albite ; and tin ore and calcite often replace these feldspars by some process of solution and substitution. Labradorite more rarely forms kaolin. Orthoclase is also described as occurring altered to albite. This has been mentioned as an example of paramorphism, the two species being dimorphous. But as these feldspars occur together in the same rock, and must have been formed under very simUar circumstances, we can hardly suppose that either is liable to a change Uke that of a dimorphous compound to the form of the other.

A labradorite without alkaU and with the angles of orthoclase is so much of an anomaly as to be at least of very im- probable existence. It may well be altered ortlwclase and thereby pseudomorphous. Nordenskiold, whUe making the form monoclinic in the text, states that he obtained the angle 90\u00b0 22' between the two cleavages with a reflective goniometer, and suggests that the form may possibly be tri- clinic. StUl the other angles are so closely those of orthoclase that this view appears quite im probable, as he also must regard it, since he does not adopt it in the text.

It ia found near Abo, in the parish of Pargas in Finland, and at Aker and Gulsjo in Sweden ; at Taberg in Wermland; at Boden in Saxony ; on Loch Ness in Scotland ; at Achmatovsk in the Ural, along with perofskite ; and in the mines of Schischimsk with red apatite. Humite occurs at Somma, iu ejected masses of a kind of granitic rock, along with forsterite, biotite, pyroxene, magnetite, etc. Abundant in the counties of Sussex, N. J., and Orange, N. Y., where it is associated with spinel, and occasionaUy with pyroxene and corundum. In N. Jersey, at Bryam, orange aud straw colored chondrodite, and also a variety nearly black, occurs with spinel ; at Sparta, a fine local ity of honey-yellow chondrodite; a mile to the north of Sparta the best locality of this mineral in N. J. ; at Vernon, Lockwood, and Franklin. In N. York, in Orange Co., in Warwick, Monroe, CornwaU, near Greenwood Furnace, and at Two Ponds, and elsewhere ; near Edenville in fine specimens on tho land of Mr. Houston; also sparingly in Rossie, on the bank of Laidlaw Lake. In Mass., at Chelmsford, with scapolite. In Penn., near Chaddsford, in Harvy's quarry, of yeUow' and orange colors, abundant. In Canada, in limestone at St. Crosby, St. Jerome, St. Adele, GrenvUle, etc., abundant. The name chondrodite is from x<>.-p>., a grain, aUuding to the granular structure. Brucite was given by Col. Gibbs after Dr. Bruce, editor of the American Mineralogical Journal ; Maclureite by Seybert, after Wm. Maclure. The mineral was first discovered in New Jersey by Dr. Bruce. Fluorine was first detected in it in 1811, by Dr. Langstaff of New York, whose aualysis (No. 1) gives very nearly the correct constitution of the species. Cleaveland, in the first edition of his mineral ogy (issued in 1816), at p. 185, in a brief mention of the undescribed species, speaks of it aa a fluate, eaUing it fluate of magnesia, he evidently having had an imperfect report of Dr. Langstaff's examination, the results of which had not then been published. Dr. Torrey obtained simUar results to those of Dr. Langstaff in 1818. See on these points Am. J. Sci., vi. 171, 1823. D'Ohs son analyzed the mineral in 1817 without finding the fluorine, he obtaining (Lc.) Si 38'00, Mg 54-00, Pe 5-10, __1 1-50, fl 0\"86 \u00a3_n tr., a result very wide from the true composition. Humite was shown to be identical with chondrodite in composition by Rammelsberg.

Sci., II. xliii. 407), and shown that it is tourmaline with oxyd of copper and other impurities. Domeyko made it a silicate of copper (1. o., and Forbes, Phil. Mag., IV. xxv. 111). Ulex's specimen (anal. 30) was procured from a cargo of copper ores landed at Hamburg, and identified as taltalite by its characters. Pyr., etc. \u2014 I., fuse rather easily to a white blebby glass or slag ; II., fuse with a strong heat to a blebby slag or enamel, either white, greenish, or brownish ; III., fuse with difficulty, or, in some, only on the edges, to a brownish, brownish-red, gray, or black slag ; IV., fuse on the edges, and ofton with great difficulty, to a yellowish, grayish, bluish, or whitish slag or enamel, and some are infusible ; V., infusible, but becoming white or paler, sometimes, as the Paris (Me.) rubellite, affording a fine enamel on the edges (Ramm.). With the fluxes many varieties give reactions for iron and manganese. Fused with a mixture of bisulphate of potash and fluor-spar gives a strong reaction for boric acid. By heat alone tourmaline loses weight from the evolution of fluorid of silicon and perhaps also fluorid of boron ; and only after previous ignition is the mineral completely decom- posed by fluohydric acid. Not decomposed by acids (Ramm.). After fusion perfectly decomposed by sulphuric acid (v. KobeU). Obs. \u2014 Tourmaline is usually found in granite, gneiss, syenite, mica, chloritic or talcose schist, dolomite, granular limestone, and sometimes in sandstone near dykes of igneous rocks. The vari- ety in granular limestone or dolomite is commonly brown. Foreign localities are mentioned above. Small hrilliant black crystals in decomposed feld- spar, at Sonnenberg in the Harz, are called aphrizite. Rubellite and green tourmaline occur near Katherinenburg in Siberia ; pink crystals are found at Elba. Pale yellowish-brown crystals in talc at Windisch Kappell in Carinthia ; green at Airolo, Switzerland; white specimens {achroite) come from St. Gothard, Siberia, and Elba. A specimen, formerly in the Grand Duke's coUection at Florence, measuring 1 1 inches square, contains 4 erect green tourmaUnes aud 1 prostrate, 2, 4, and 2\\ inches long, and J to 1 inch thick. In Great Britain, fine black crystals have been obtained near Bovey Tracey in Devon ; also found in CornwaU at different localities ; green near Dartmoor in Devon ; black near Aberdeen in Scotland, and elsewhere ; dark brown at Dalkey in Co. Dublin, Ireland ; green near Dunsanaghy, Co. Donegal ; green and red at Ox mountain, near Sligo. In the U. States, in Maine at Paris and Hebron, magnificent red and green tourmalines with lepidolite, etc., some crystals over an inch in diameter, transparent, ruby-red within, sur- rounded by green, or red at one extremity and green at the other; also blue and pink varieties; at Albany, green and black ; at Streaked Mtn., black. In Mass., at Chesterfield, red, green, and blue, in a granite vein with albite, uranite, and microlite, the crystals smaU and curved, nearly opaque, and fragile, the green crystals often with distinct prisms of red color inside, especiaUy when in smoky quartz ; at Goshen, simUar, the blue in greater perfection ; at Norwich, New Baintree, and Carlisle, good black crystals. In N. Hamp., Alstead, Grafton, SuUivan, Acworth, and Saddle- back Mt ; at Orford, large brownish-black crystals abundant in steatite. In Vermont, at Brattle- boro, black. In Conn., at Monroe, perfect dark brown crystals iu mica-slate near Lane's mine, sometimes two inches in length and breadth ; at Haddam, interesting black crystals in mica slate with anthophyUite, also in granite with iolite, and also at the gneiss quarries, on the east side of the river. In N. York, rear Gouverneur, light and dark brown crystals, often highly modi- fied, with apatite and scapolite in granular limestone (f. 3.8, 339); at Canton; in simple prisms in the same rock near Port Henry, Essex Co.; at Schroon, with chondrodite and scapolite; at Crown Point, one mile south of village, fine brown crystals ; at the chrysoberyl locality near Saratoga, N. Y., black; at Alexandria, Jefferson Co.; at Kingsbridge, brown, yellowish or reddish-brown crystals in dolomite ; near Edenville, gray or bluish-gray and green in three- sided prisms occur ; short black crystals in the same vicinity, and at Rocky HiU, sometimes 5 inches in diameter ; a mUe southwest of Amity, yellow and cinnamon-colored crystals with spinel in calcite ; also near the same vUlage a clove-brown variety with horublende and rutUe iu granu- lar limestone.

The name turmalin from Turamali in Cingalese, was introduced into HoUand in 1703, with a lot of gems from Ceylon. The property of attracting the ashes of burnt peat, after friction, Jed to its being very soon named in HoUand Aschenlrecker, or ash-drawer. In 1717, Lemery, in his Memoir in the Hist, de l'Acad. des Sci., France, referred the attraction to magnetism ; and in 1756 to 1762, appeared the several Memoirs of \u00c6piuus (published in the Mem. Acad. Berlin, vol. xii., and at St. Petersburg) on the electrical properties of tourmaline. The name tourmaline was slow of introduction into mineralogical treatises. The first specimens from Ceylon were cut gems, so that the common characteristics of tourmaline and schorl were not apparent. Linn\u00e6us, m his Syst. Nat., 1768, suggests the relation between them, but de Lisle was the first to descnbe Cey lon crystals, and bring the two minerals into one species. On the name schorl, see pages 204 to 206. Long after the union of tourmaline and schorl, the species continued to bear the latter of these names; and even in 1816, Jameson, in his System of Mineralogy, retains schorl as the name of the species, with common schorl and tourmaline ot precious schorl as two subspecies.

The mica is lepidolite, a species which is related in composition to some tourmaline, and is a frequent associate of the red and green varieties. It appears to take place through the addition of alkaUes. Some rubeUites and green tourmalines at Chesterfield are hollow, evidently from decomposition and removal of the interior ; and in the cavities are occasionally observed smaU crystals of yellow nranite (Tesche macher). Zeuxite, Thomson (Ann. Phil, iv. 299, 1 814) was found in 1 8 14 in acicular interwoven crystals at Huel Unity, CornwaU; color brown, slightly greenish in some lights ; G. =3-051; H.=425; prisms stated to be flat rectangular. Thomson's analysis afforded Si 33'48, Si 3185, Fe 2601, Ca 246, H 5-28=99-07. B.B. becomes scoriaceous at the edges. Loses over 5 p. c. when heated in a glass tube. Greg supposes that this loss may have been of boric acid instead of water, and that tho mineral is a ferriferous tounuahne (Phil. Mag., IV. x. 118). 321. GEHLENITE. Gehlenit Fuchs, Schw.

The crystallization of sillimanite, fibrolite, bucholzite, and also of bamlite andxenolite, was first shown to be orthorhombic by Descloizeaux, on optical grounds. The terminal planes in the crystal figured by the writer (annexed figure) were rough, and, as stated in the last edition, of too doubtful import to be relied on for their angles or their indications as to the symmetry of thecrystals.

Cyanite, when blue and transparent, and in sufficiently large pieces, is employed as a gem, and somewhat resembles sapphire. Named from \u2122rft, blue. The name sappare arose from a mistake by Saussure, Jr., in reading a label of this mineral on which it was caUed sapphire ; a copy of this label is given in J. de Phys., xxxiv. 213 ; the specimen thus labelled was from Botriphinie in Scotland, and was sent by the Duke of Gordon to Saussure the father. Disthene is from Us, twice, or of two kinds, and . .rx-s, strong, aUuding to the unequal hardness and electric properties in two different directions. Von KobeU has shown (Ber. Ak. Munchen, 1867) that the right and left-handed twins may be easUy distinguished by means of polarized light ; they give, with the stauroscope, a cross some what obhque in position ; but the principal optical section does not revolve with the revolution of the crystal ; while the colors change in different order with tho revolution, according as the twin is right-handed or left-handed.

In recent experiments made under Rammelsberg's direction, the Finbo mineral lost in a porcelain oven 22-98 p. c; Schneckensteiu 2073; Schlackenwald 17-73\u201416-23; Trum buU 16-27 \u2014 19-55; BrazU 1540 \u2014 14-29; Altenberg pycnite 1998. The topaz was not fused in the heating, yet somewhat blistered at surface. The BrazU topaz afforded Rammelsberg after the heating in which 154 p. c were lost, Si 30-22, Si 71-34, F 1-56=103-12; and after that in which the loss was 14-_9 p. a, Si 30-10, Si 70-38, F 247 = 102-95, showing that the part lost was not strictly fluorid of silicon, but may have included some fluorid of aluminum. G. Stadeler (1. c.) has shown that part osthe fluorine escapes as fluohydric acid, and makes 89-9 p. c. of the loss to be fluorine. This gives for the TrumbuU topaz (anaL 5), 2116 F; the Brazil, 20-71 F; the Finbo, 22-29, from Forchhammer's results, and 20 66 from Rammelsberg's ; for the Saxon, 18-64 from Rammelsberg's trials, and 20-68 from DeviUe's ; the mean of the whole 20-68.

The large coarse crystals are sometimes six or seven inches in diameter. A variety of topaz from Brazil, when heated, assumes a pink or red hue, resembUng the Balas ruby. The finest crystals are brought from Minas Novas in Brazil. From their peculiar Umpid ity, topaz pebbles are sometimes denominated goutles d'eau. The coarse varieties of topaz may be employed as a substitute for emery. On the cryst. of topaz, see Kokscharof, Min, RussL, ii. 198, 344, iU. 195, 378; Hessenberg, Min. Not, No. vii. 38.

Grothite Dana. (Titanite P. Groth, Jahrb. Min., 1866, 44.) P. Groth has shown that the ti tanite-like mineral, from tho syenite of Plauen Grund near Dresden, differs in composition and cleavage from ordinary sphene. The form 'is monoclinic in habit, being somewhat Uke f. 363 and 367 ; but there is distinct cleavage parallel to one 2, and Uttle distinct paraUel to the other. The angles are 2 A 2=136\u00b0; 2 on l-t=155\u00b0 19' to 156\u00b0 20'; 1-i on i-i about 162\u00b0. H.=65. G.= 352 \u2014 3'60. Lustre vitreous to greasy.

The Coromandel mineral, referred here by Damour, affords, according to him, the O. ratio for R + K + R, Si=2 : 1 ; and for R, fi, R=2 : 1 : 2 ; whence the formula (J R8+i fi+| R*)* Si3.

Lechartier has ascertained that staurolite contains, uniformly, some water, separable only at a high heat ; and that the variations are due to impurities, the powder under the microscope being distinctly a mixture of two or more minerals, and the action of fluo hydric acid on some crystals making them cellular, or even spongy and fragile.

Feldspar-like in constituents and oxygen ratio ; the bases being alumina, and the alkalies and alkaline earths (K, Na, Ca, Ba, Sr), to the almost total exclusion of magnesia and iron ; and the oxygen ratio between the protoxyd and sesquioxyd bases being 1 : 3. III. Margarophyllite Section. Micaceous or thin foliated when crys tallized ; and plane angle of base of prism 120\u00b0. On account of the uncertainties with respect to the relations of the water in hydrous sUicates, the basis for a true classification of them is to a large extent wanting. From the dominance among anhydrous silicates of the grand subdivisions of Bisilicates, UnisUicates, and Subsilicates, the Bame groups might be reasonably looked for among the hydrous. But the formulas of very many of the species may be written according to either of these types, by making more, or less, or none, of the water basic ; and consequently all attempts to define the limits of the groups must be at present unsatisfactory. CrystaUographic and other relations to anhydrous species give help, but not always sure guidance. The following examples elucidate some of the reasons for referring species to the section of BisUicates rather than that of UnisUicates, or the reverse : Laumontite (No. 342, beyond) has a close approximation in crystaUine form to pyroxene, and this suggests a relation to the BisUicates ; moreover, its formula is whoUy pyroxene-Uke, if the water is not basic. It is to be noted that part of the water escapes on heating to 100\u00b0 C. There is the same relation in form between pectolite and pyroxene, as long since shown by Frankenheim ; and the same formula also, if the water, here a more stable constituent, is basic. Okenite is very near hornblende, or another anhydrous bisUicate, in its crystaUization; and it is also Uke it in formula, if half the water is basic. In each of these cases crystaUography appears to show whether any of the water, and how much, is basic. Again, dioptase has the angles nearly, and the bisUicate ratio, of beryl, if the water be not basic. Prehnite has an affinity in its crystaUization to chrysolite ; and, if the water is all basic, the oxygen ratio for the bases and sUica is 1 : 1, or that of a Unisilicate, as in chrysolite. Calamine is approximately isomorphous with prehnite, and, moreover, both are pyroelectric ; and the oxygen ratio is 1 : 1, if the water is not basic. Fahlunite, a result of the alteration of ioUte, is equivalent to iolite plus water. Iolite is a \\ sUicate, there being a deficiency of base for a true unisUicate ; but the added water just sills up the deficiency, so that, if the water is basic, the species is strictly a UnisUicate, the 0. ratio for R, fi, gi, fl being 1 : 3 : 5 : 1, or for the bases R + fi+H and suica, 5 : 5=1 : 1. There seems to be no reason for questioning this basic relation of the water; it is probable that the deficiency of base may lead to the easy absorption of water so characteristic of Iolite. In other alterations of ioUte stUl more water is taken up, so that the 0. ratio is 1 : 3 : 5 : 2; the compound is apparently the same, but with twice the proportion of water, only one-half of it in this case being basic. The same remarks are applicable to margarodite and other hydrous micas in their relations to muscovite and the anhydrous micas."], [450, "394 OXYGEN COMPOUNDS. ApophyUite crystallizes in tetragonal forms\u2014 forms that are common among anhydrous UnisUi cates, and are unknown among BisUicates. Tbe species is therefore arranged beyond as a un - silicate, but as a representative of the ScapoUte group of anhydrous silicates Tritwmteaud Thorite are isometric species, and related to helvite and garnet; and they are UnisUicates, hke garnet, it the water be not basic. , , , , \u25a0 Ti \u2022 . . From these examples it is apparent that the facts give only probable conclusions It is to be hoped that chemistry will soon furnish principles that are encumbered with less ot doubt The group of Zeolites includes species that are feldspar-like in having among them the oxygen ratios for the protoxyds, alumina, and sUica 1 : 3 : 4, 1 : 3 : 6, 1 : 3 :8, 1 : _ .9, 1.3 12, with the only difference that water is present in addition. They are therefore sometimes spoken of as representatives among hydrous sUicates of the anhydrous feldspars. But this inference, though apparently sustained by the oxygen ratios, is far from right. It assumes that the water is not basic. If it be basic, then the species may be ordinary BisUicates or UnisUicates, quite remote from the feldspars. Looking to the crystaUization, it is found that there is, in fact, nothing whatever to sus tain the relation to the feldspars. The species of the Feldspar group are almost identical in angles and physical characters ; whUe the zeolites are exceedingly diverse in both respects, and none have the feldspar form or angles. Nearlv aU the systems of crystaUization are represented among them, and with a very wide range in angles. The feldspars have the prismatic angle near 120\u00b0 ; whUe the zeolites that approach the feldspars most nearly\u2014 that is, the Stilbite group, in which the oxy gen ratio is 1 : 3 : 12, and the crystaUization is in part oblique\u2014 have the prismatic angle near 90' in one species, and from 130\u00b0 to 136\u00b0 in others. The hexagonal species, chabazite, levynite, and gmelinite, usuaUy made a subgroup among the zeolites, have widely different rhombohedral angles. WhUe, then, there is seeming unity in the group of zeolites, there is actuaUy the widest diver sity ; and, wheu fuUy understood, they wUl probably have their places among the UnisUicates and Bisilicates of the first section. Analcite, which is included among the zeolites, is related in form to the feldspars, and in both form and formula (the water being excluded) to the anhydrous sUi cate, leucite. The Margarophyllites appear to constitute a strictly natural group, although under a very vari ous chemical constitution. They are foUated in structure Uke the micas, and, Uke them, have the plane angle of the base of the prism 120\u00b0, the crystaUization being either hexagonal or pris matic, with the angles of base 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0. They include talc and pyrophyUite, margarodite and other hydrous micas, chlorite, margarite, etc.; with also kaoUnite and serpentine, which have the same crystaUization ; and to these are added some species not yet known in the crystaUized state, which appear to be chemieaUy aUied to the margarophylUtes. The true margarophyUites are below 5 in hardness ; greasy to the feel, at least when finely powdered ; and not sparry in appearance when massive, unless through pseudomorphism, in which case this sparry character is that of the original mineral altered to make them.

Berlin, who considers it impure from mixed sihca (quartz), and related to the red zeolite of Upsala analyzed by him. It afforded Retzius Si 60-28, Si 16-42, Ca 8-18, Pe 4-16, Mg and Mn 0-4_ HI 10 i , =99-53. A similar mineral from Fahlun yielded Hisinger gi 60/00, Si 15-6, Pe 1,8, Ca 8-0 H 11-6 97*0; whUe he obtained for the \u00c6delfors zeolite Si 53-76, Si 18-47, Pe 4-02, Ca 10-90, H 11-23=98m8, which is near the composition of laumontite. Bischof has analyzed a pseudomorph of laumontite after orthoclase (see Obthoclase). _\u2022._-\u25a0_.__ _ Pyr., etc.\u2014 In a vacuum, Huelgoet laumontite crystals, according to Malagnti & Durocher, lose in weight 226 p. c, and, over sulphuric acid, 3'85 p. c. ; and regain the same in water or moist air. Heated up to 100\u00b0 C, they lose 3-17 p. c. ; to 200\u00b0, 6-08 p. c. ; to 300 , 7-28 ; and the remainder of the water only at a red heat. B.B. swells up and fuses at 2 7\u20143 to a white enamel. Gelatinizes with muriatic acid. Obs.\u2014 Laumontite occurs in the cavities of trap or amygdaloid; also in porphyry and syenite, and occasionally in veins traversing clay slate with calcite. It was first observed in 1785, in the lead mines of Huelgoet in Brittany, by GUlet Laumont, after whom it is named. Its principal locaUties are at the Faroe Islands ; Disko in Greenland ; in Bohemia, at Eule in clay slate; St. Gothard in Switzerland; the FassathaL in large masses exhibiting a radiated structure ; SarnthaL near Botzen, Tyrol ; Plauenscher Grand, near Dresden ; Hartfield Moss in Renfrewshire, accompanying analcite; tho amygdaloidal rocks in the Kilpatrick hUls, near Glasgow ; and in several trap rocks of the Hebrides, and the north of Ireland. Peter's Point, Nova Scotia, affords fine specimens of this species. It is there associated with apophyllite, thomsonite, and other species of this famUy ; also at Port George, N. S., in veins some times 3 in. thick, and at MargaretviUe, colored green by copper; also at Digby Neck and Long Point. Also found in good specimens at Phipsburg, Maine ; also sparingly at BradleysvUle, Litchfield Co., Conn., near a paper-miU, in narrow seams in gneiss; and at Southbury, Conn., a Uttle east of the viUage, on the land of Mr. Stiles. Abundant in many places in the copper veins of Lake Superior in trap, and on I. Royale ; on north shore of Lake Superior, between Pigeon Bay and Fond du Lac. Found also at Bergen HU1, N. J., iu greenstone, with datolite, apophyUite, etc. ; sparingly at PhUlipstown, N. Y., in feldspar with stUbite, and at Columbia bridge, near PhUadelphia. Alt. \u2014 Most varieties become opaque and crumble at the touch after exposure to the ordinary atmosphere, losing 1 to 2 p. c. of water. Specimens in cabinets can be best preserved from alter ation by keeping them in moist air. Schneiderite (1. c.) is laumontite from the serpentine of Monte Catini, Italy, which has undergone alteration through the action of magnesian solutions. It is described by Meneghini as laminate radiate in structure, with H.=3. Fig. 381 represents a crystal from Mt. Catini (one received by Prof. G. J. Brush from Prof. Bechi); it gave the author the approximate angles I A 7=85\u00b0 \u2014 86\u00b0 30', i-i A 2-1=126\u00b0, -2-i A M = 148\u00b0 15', I A -1 = 135\u00b0, -1 A -1, front, = 133\u00b0, 2-i A 6-. = 144\".

J., as described by Berthier (Ann. Ch. Phys., li. 395), is of three varieties: (1) a thin, green, transparent incrustration ; (2) a bluish-green earthy mineral, very tender and light, becoming transparent, like hydrophane, in water ; and (3) a pale greenish-blue massive material, hard enough to scratch glass, and to be polished for jewelry ; and he observes that the chrysocolla is nearly pure in the first, but is mixed with opal-sUica in much of the second kind, and with opal-sUica and ordinary sUicain the last. Berthier's analysis (No. 4 above) was made on a specimen of the second kind, and according to him probably contained 8 p. e. of opal-sUica in a state of mixture. Berthier, allowing for 8 p. c. of free sUica in this analysis, sug gests that the composition may be Cu Si -1-4 fl, whUe Bowen's eariier analysis (5) gives Cu Si -t 2 fl. ' Berthier's mineral has been named (without sufficient reason) SomerviUite, and the analysis has generaUy been taken as expressing directly his view of the composition. Berthier gives an analysis also of the hard chrysocoUa of SomerviUe (third kind) to show that there is in these ores free sUica.

Bischof observes (Lehrb., ii. 1885) that sUicate of copper may be formed through the action of an alkaline-, lime-, or magnesia-silicate on sulphate or nitrate of copper in solution. He also shows that this sUicate is decomposed by carbonated waters, producing carbonate of copper. The alkaline sUicates are furnished by the decomposing granite, and the sulphate of copper by altered pyritous copper. ButL. S\u00e6mann communicates to the author that he has seen specimens of chryso colla from ChiU, which have in the interior the fibrous structure and composition of pure mala chite, showing that the whole was once malachite. The chrysocolla analyzed by Scheerer (anaL 7) occurs with feldspar, and is supposed to have resiUted from the action of sulphate of copper on the feldspar. Some specimens of the chrysocolla are translucent and brittle on one part, aud earthy, like decomposed feldspar, on the opposite. Found in most copper mines in Cornwall ; at Libethen in Hungary ; at Falkenstein and Schwatz in the Tyrol ; in Siberia ; the Bannat ; Thuringia ; Schneeberg, Saxony ; Kupferberg, Bavaria ; South Australia ; ChiU, etc. In SomerviUe and Schuyler's mines, New Jersey, at Morgantown, Pa., and at WolcottvUle, Conn., chrysocoUa occurs associated with red copper ore, native copper, and green malachite ; in Pennsylvania, near Morgantown, Berks Co. ; at Perkiomen ; at Cornwall, Lebanon Co. ; also with simUar associated minerals, and with brown iron ore, in Nova Scotia, at the Basin of Mines; also in Wisconsin and Michigan, mixed with carbonate of copper. ChrysocoUa is from yp.. 6s, gold, and \u00ab-AX_, glue, and was the name of a material used in soldering gold. The name is often applied now to borax, which is so employed. But much of the ancient chrysocolla was a green stone containing copper as the coloring ingredient, and the best, as Dios corides says, was that which was -_n_<dp_,s .<,_.-\u00a3.\u201e__, or of a fine leek-green or prase color; and the island of Cyprus, which was named from its copper mines, was a prominent locahty. Pliny says the mineral was named after the real chrysocoUa, because it looked like it. It may have in cluded carbonate of copper, as was true to some extent of the chrysocoUa and mountain-green of the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries. The c\u00e6ruleum montanum of WaUerius included both chryso colla and an earthy variety of the carbonate. 347. ALIPITE. PimeUt Schmidt, Pogg, M. 388, 1844. Alipit Glock., 1845.

The name Calamine (with Galmei of the Germans) is commonly supposed to be a corruption of Cadmia. Agricola says it is from calamus, a reed, in allusion to the slender forms (stalactitic) com mon in the cadmia fornacum. The cadmia of Pliny and of other ancient authors included both the native silicate and carbon ate, and the oxyd from the chimneys of furnaces (cadmia fornacum). The two native ores con tinued to be confounded under the name lapis calaminaris, calamine or galmei, until investi gated chemicaUy by Smithson in 1803. Earlier analyses had made out chemical differences, and some authors, before 1790, had rightly suggested a division of the species Bergmann having found 28 p. c. carbonic acid in a Holywell specimen (J. de Phys., xvi. 17, 1780) ; and PeUetier, in a kind from Fribourg in Brisgau, which had been called Zeolite of Brisgau because it gelatinized with acids, 52 p. c. sUica, with 36 oxyd of zinc, and 12 water (J. de Phys., xx. 420, 1782); and Klaproth, in another, similarly gelatinizing, 66 oxyd of zinc and 33 sUica. But Smithson was the first to make known the true composition, and clear away all doubts. De Lisle noticed the crystaUine forms of the two species, describing one kind as prismatic with dihedral summits, and the other as scalenohedral Uke dogtooth spar, yet did not fuUy appreciate the importance of the observation ; while Haiiy, 14 years later, iu his Traite, describes only the crys tals of the silicate, and takes the ground that the zinc carbonatee was only an impure calcareous . zinc oxyde.\" In 1807 Brongniart caUed the sUicate calamine, leaving for the other ore the chemical name zinc carbonatee. In 1832, Beudant foUowed Brongniart in the former name, and designated the latter Smithsonite, after Smithson, who had analyzed in 1803 the carbonate as weU as silicate. Thus the two species were at last, not only distinguished, but mineralogicaUy named. Unfortunately, Brooke & MUler, in 1852, reversed Beudant's use of these names, with no good reason; and in 1853, Kenngott, on account of the confusion of names, as he says, introduced for the sUicate the new name Hemimorphite, and so added to the confusion. These innovations should have no favor. 362 A. Mohesnbtitb Risse (Verh. nat Ver. Bonn, 1865, Ber. 98). A mineral from Altenberg, near Aachen, occurring with calamine.

The yeUowish variety is the orangite (so caUed from the color), from Langesund fiord, which Bergemann, when he so named it, supposed to contain a new metal, caUed by him donarium. The latter has since been found with an exterior of the former. The mineral occurs as pseudomorphs after orthoclase and zircon, and crystals of the latter kind have afforded Zschau (Am. J. Sci., II. xxvi. 359) the angles _A1 = 1S2\u00a3\u00b0, 1A1=123\u00a3\u00b0, the corresponding angles of zircon being 132\u00b0 10'andl23\u00b0 19'.

Obs. \u2014 Occurs at Bastnas, near Riddarhyttan, in Westmannland, Sweden, forming a bed in gneiss, and associated with mica, hornblende, copper pyrites, cerine, etc. It bears considerable resem blance to the red granular variety of corundum, but is readily distinguished by its hardness. Hisinger and Berzelius, in 1803-4, detected in this mineral a new metal which they named cerium, after the planet Ceres, then recently announced ; and the mineral they called cerite. Klaproth made the same discovery about the same time, and gave the name ochroile to the mineral, and ochroile earth to the new earth (aUuding to its color, from u>v. <., brownish-yellow). In his Beitrage, 1807, Klaproth accepted the names of Hisinger and Berzelius, yet added a syllable (lest they should appear to come from . .o_, wax), making them cererium and cerertte \u2014 a change not accepted. In 1839 Mosander proved that the oxyd of cerium contained the new metal lanthanum, and in 1842 another new metal, didymium. 368. ERDMANNITE. Berlin, Pogg, lxxxviii. 162.

In America it has been found at Peter's Point and Partridge Island, in the Basin of Mines, Nova Scotia, both massive and crystaUized, presenting white, reddish, and greenish colors, and asso ciated with laumontite, thomsonite, and other minerals of trap rocks ; also at Chute's cove, Cape"], [473, "HYDROUS SILICATES. 417 d Or, Isle Haute, Swan's Creek, and Cape Blomidon. Large crystals occur at Bergen HiU, N J associated with analcite, pectolite, stUbite, datolite, etc, some of them 3 inches across. It is also found at Gin Cove, near Perry, Maine, with prehnite and analcite in amygdaloid- at the Cliff mine, Lake Superior region (f. 399). ' ApophyUite was so named by Hauy in allusion to its tendency to exfoliate under the blowpipe from -tt- and a leaf. Its whitish pearly aspect, resembling the eye of a fish after boiling-' gave rise to the name Ichthyophlhalmite, from ixt) .s, fish, and o</,fl.,*/i.5, eye. The name ichthyophlhalmite (or ichthyophthalme), given in 1800 by d'Andrada, has priority. But d'Andrada's description (1. c.) is bad in all respects, answering much better for pearly feldspar or adularia, even the specific gravity (2*491) being far out osthe way; it affords some evidence that he may have drawn it from another mineral. It was therefore hardly a violation of the strictest rule of priority that Haiiy, who had studied carefully the crystaUization of the mineral before it was known to d'Andrada, should have named it anew. Neither justice to d'Andrada, nor the good of science, requires that the name apophyllite should now yield place to the earlier one. The ear liest analyses were made in 1805 by V. Rose (Gehlen's J, v.), and Fourcroy & Vauquelin (Ann. du Mus, v.). Alt.\u2014 Occurs altered to pectolite near Tiexno on Monte Baldo, along with unchanged crystals. Artif. \u2014 Crystals have been obtained by Wohler from heated waters, and he inferred that a tem perature of 180\u00b0 F. was necessary to the result. He stated that when heated in water to this temperature under a pressure of 10 to 12 atmospheres, it forms a solution which crystalUzes on cooling. Pearly radiated crystals were formed by Becquerel through the action of a solution of silicate of potash on plates of sulphate of lime (gypsum). Daubree has detected crystals of apo phyUite in the Roman works at the hot springs of Plombieres ; they were covered in part with in-rusting and stalactitic hyahte. 371. EDINGTONITE.

The name Zeagonite is from (ia, to cook, and ay-y-s, barren, and was the first name of the species. Leonhard substituted the describer's name, which it has since held. Von KobeU and Marignac have analyzed crystals from the locaUty at Capo di Bove with a result very different from the above ; and it is supposed that the crystals taken for the analyses were a mixture of gismondite and phillipsite. The crystals were, however, received from the Italian min eralogist Medici-Spada. Credner examined a part of the same lot of crystals, and has described and figured them in the Jahrb. Min. 1847, p. 559 ; and the figures have the twin forms (crucU'orm to octahedral) and stri\u00e6 of phiUipsite. He describes others that are rounded octahedral, with rough edges without the stri\u00e6 \u2014 the true gismondite, according to most authors \u2014 but adds that even-faced octahedrons graduate imperceptibly into the rough, and that aU appear to be one spe cies. He consequently makes aU the crystals orthorhombic, and closely related to phiUipsite. But v. Lang has shown that the crystals are not twins, and have the above angles (Phil. Mag, IV. xxviii. 505). Von KobeU (in the Gel. Anz. Miinchen, 1839) described the crystals as tetragonal, mentioned the twins, and published the following analysis. He also places the species very near phUUpsite, and in his Geschichte der Min. (p. 487) he even queries the identity of the two. Marignac also made the crystals tetragonal octahedrons, with the angles of basal edges 92\u00b0 30', and of pyram idal 118\u00b0 31'. Analyses: 1, v. KobeU (1. e, and J. pr.

The O. ratio for the first is near 1 : 4 : 7-} : 5 ; for the second 1 : 3 : 6 : 3 i. These analyses are sometimes placed under the name zeagonite, as if a third mineral existed at Capo di Bove distinct from the phiUipsite and gismondite. But v. KobeU holds that his results give the true composi tion of gismondite. L. GmeUn, more than 40 years ago, made a chemical examination that led him to refer gismondite to phiUipsite. Marignac regarded the mineral analyzed by him (anal. 2) as true phiUipsite. Certain pale bluish octahedral crystals from Vesuvius, affording, according to PhiUips, the terminal angle 122\u00b0 58', have been caUed zeagonite, which Hausmann refers to zircon (Handb, u. 797). v"], [475, "HYDROUS SILICATES. 419 373.

In the preceding table the constituents of the species are stated without the arrangement of them into formulas. The resemblance to the Feldspar group in oxygen ratio seems, at first thought, to imply resemblance at least in scheme of composition. But it has been observed (p. 394) that instead of unity of crystaUine form and physical characters, as in the Feldspar group, there is the utmost diversity. A relation between the proportion of sUica and alkali holds through the feldspars ; but none exists, or could be rightly looked for, among the varied groups here brought together under the name of zeolites. The water present has produced the wide divergence from the feldspars ; and it is therefore probable that this water is in part, at least, basic. This being so, they may pertain to the two divisions of UnisUicates and Bisilicates. In the foUowing table they are arranged under these heads, and formulas added to correspond with this reference of them. The species of the Mesotype and Levynite groups are made UnisUicates, because they have not sUica enough for the bisUicate type. Thomsonite has the 0. ratio for the bases and sUica=l+ 3 : 4=1 : 1, or that of a true UnisUicate; and natrolite, if the water be basic, is also unisUicate. Further, the close isomorphism of the several species of the Mesotype group renders it probable that they are similar chemically, and therefore aU unisUicate. The species of the remaining groups have sUica enough for BisiUcates, and are so arranged in the foUowing table. Yet those of the groups 3 to 5 have water enough for UnisUicates, if this water bo mainly basic. Thus chabazite and gmelinite have a unisilicate ratio, if two-thirds of the water is basic ; and herschelite and phUlipsite, if four-fifths. But the facUity with which part of the water iu these species escapes is evidence that a considerable part of it, at least, is not basic. Chabazite loses over 7 p. c. of water, or more than a third, by simple exposure to dry air. For other similar facts, see under the species beyond. It is, therefore, not at all probable that enough water is basic to make the species unisiUcate. In the preceding table, the fraction written after the column of A indicates the proportion of water which is made basic in the formulas which here foUow: 1. UNISILICATE. I.

Before the close of the century five subdivisions had been recognized by Werner and the mineralogists of his school: (1) Mehlzeolith (mealy zeoUte); (2) Fasriger zeolith or Fdserzeolilh (fibrous zeoUte) ; these two corresponding to the more modern mesotype (or natrolite. scolecite, mesoUte, and thomsonite); (3) Sirahliger zeolith or Strahlzeolith (radiated zeolite), now stUbite ; (4) Bldttriger zeolith or Bldtterzeoltlh (foliated zeolite), now heulandite and apophyUite ; (5) Wiirfelzeolith (cubic zeolite), now chabazite and analcite. Moreover, Kreuzstein, later caUed harmotome, and Prehnite were regarded as distinct species ; and so also Lapis Lazuli, which had been ranked with the zeolites by WaUerius. In 1801 Haiiy gave the name of Mesotype, or Zeolite proper, to the varieties included under the first two of the above subdivisions, together with apophyUite ; and took a second backward step, which he never retraced, in uniting those of the third and fourth in one species under the name of Stilbite. At the same time he rightly removed Analcime from the old Cubic zeolite. In 1803 natrolite was separated from mesotype by Klaproth, and hence his name should stand for the species so designated. In 1813 Scolecite, and in 1816 MesoUte, were separated by Fuchs and Gehlen ; and in 1820 Thomsonite by Brooke. Haiiy's name mesotype is at present restricted, or should be, to a generic use to include the group of zeolites, viz., natroUte, scolecite, mesolite, and the related species. 377. THOMSONITE.

It occurs with mesoUte and apo phyUite, and probably owes its slight excess of sUica to mixture with the former of these minerals, or else with free silica. Mesole was long since referred to thomsonite by Haidinger. Scoulerite R. D. Thomson, from Port Rush, Antrim, is mesole in structure. It has, Dr. Thom son observes, \" the same composition as thomsonite, with only (according to an analysis by R. D. Thomson) rather less alumina, and 6^ p. c. of soda. The analysis has not been published. 3. Chaldite Thomson, is a compact variety, of a reddish-brown color, from the Donegore Mts, Antrim. Thomson described it in his Mineralogy (i. 324) as haviug G. =2*252, and as containing 9 p. c. of sesquioxyd of iron (most improbable with so low sp. gr.). In the Phil. Mag. for 1840 (xvii. 408), he describes apparently the same brown \" uncrystallized \" mineral as having G. = 2-29, with \" the same constitution as the KUpatrick thomsonite, according to an analysis by R.

Greg A Lett som observe (Min., 160) that the scoulerite graduates into the compact chalUite. In view of the facts, it can hardly be doubted that it is impure thomsonite.

Galactite is ordinary natrolite, occurring in colorless acicular crystaUizations in southern Scot land, instituted as a species on an erroneous analysis. Fargile is a red natrohte from Glen Farg (anal. 24), containing, like galactite, about 4 p. c. of lime. Bergmannite (= spreustein, brevicite, radiolite, pal\u0153o-nalrolite) is natrolite from the zircon-syenite of southern Norway, near Brevig, on the Langesundfiord, occurring fibrous, massive, and in long prismatic crystallizations, and from white to red in color.

Scheerer has shown (Pogg, cviii. 416) that the bergmannite and brevicite, when of a red or reddish color, contain 4 to 7 p. c. of diaspore (a kind containing some iron). The specimen for anal. 12 contained 6\u00a3 p. c. ; and, aUowing for this, the analysis becomes Si 47-47, Si 26-83, Pe 0-60, Ca 0-88, Na 14-42, fl 9-61=99-81. This fact explains the discrepancies in other analyses. Savite afforded Bechi (1. c.) gi 4917, Si 19 66, Sig 13-50, Na 10-52, ft 1-23, fl 6-57 = 100-67. Sella suggests that the magnesia may come from the associated serpentine. Pyr., etc. \u2014 The Auvergne natrolite undergoes, according to Damour, no loss in dried air. At 240\u00b0 C. it loses nearly all its water and becomes milky and opaque ; and if afterward exposed to the free air, it regains all it had lost, excepting its transparency and firm texture ; if again heated, it loses its water at about 90\u00b0 C. In the closed tube whitens and becomes opaque. B.B. fuses quietly at 2 to a colorless glass. Fusible in the flame of an ordinary stearine or wax candle. Gelatinizes with acids. Obs. \u2014 Occurs in cavities in amygdaloidal trap, basalt, and other igneous rocks ; and sometimes in seams in granite, gneiss, and syenite. It is found in the graustein of Aussig and TepUtz in Bohemia ; in fine crystals at Puy de Marman and Puy de la Piquette in Auvergne ; at Alpstein, near Sontra in Hesse ; Monte Baldo, Tyrol ; FassathaL Tyrol ; Kapnik in Hungary ; DeUys in Algeria ; Hogau in Wiirtemberg (the Faserzeolith W.), in yeUowish radiated masses ; etc. In red amygdules (crocalite) in amygdaloid of Ireland, Scotland, and the Tyrol ; the amygdaloid of Bishoptown (gaiactite), acicular crystals, several inches long ; at Glen Farg in Fifeshire ; in Dum bartonshire ; in Renfrewshire ; at Glenarm in the county of Antrim ; at Port Rush ; and at Ma gee Island, near Larne, Ireland. In North America, natroUte occurs in the trap of Nova Scotia, at Gates' mountain, Cape d'Or, Swan's Creek, Cape Blomidon, Two Islands ; at Bergen HU1, N. J. ; sparingly at Chester, Ct. ; at Copper Falls, Lake Superior, in crystals, sometimes on native copper ; also on New York Island. Named Mesotype by Haiiy, from ploos, middle, and rt.-s, type, because the form of the crystal \u2014 in his view a square prism \u2014 was intermediate between the forms of stUbite and analcite. Na trolite, of Klaproth, is from natron, soda ; it aUudes to the presence of soda, whence also the name soda-mesotype, in contrast with scolecite, or lime-mesotype. Schumacher's name bergmannite, after Bergmann, dates from the same year (1801) with Haiiy's mesotype. Alt. \u2014 Occurs altered to prehnite. Iron-natroUte is probably an altered variety. 379.

The Irish crystals lose 7*25 p. c. in dried air, which in six months increases to 9-3 p. c. ; the loss is reduced to 1-5 p. c. after a few days of exposure.

Gmelinite is usuaUy considered rhombohedral, and the crystals as twins, secondary to a rhom bohedron of 86\u00b0 18'. Tamnau makes R A R as in chabazite, and the pyramidal faces the forms . The hexagonal cleavage observed by Rose separates it widely from chabazite. Named Gmelinite after Prof. Ch. Gmelin of Tiibiugen ; Hydrolite from the water present ; Ledererite after Baron Lederer, Austrian Consul at New York. The name hydrolite has the pri ority, but is objectionable because the mineral is not so eminently hydrous as to make it deserv ing of the appellation. 388. HERSCHELITE. Levy, Ann. PhU, x. 361, 1825.

At a duU red heat the loss is 14-.5 p. c, and the mineral is disaggregated ; the total loss at a bright red heat is 14-70 p. c. B.B. whitens, then crumbles and fuses without intumescence at 3 5 to a white translucent glass. Some varieties phosphoresce when heated. Decomposed by muriatic acid without gelatinizing. Obs. \u2014 Harmotome occurs in amygdaloid, phonoUte, trachyte; also on gneiss, and in some metaUiferous veins. Occurs at Strontian, in Scotland, in fine crystals, some an inch through ; in a metaUiferous vein at Andreasberg in the Harz ; at Rudelstadt in Silesia ; Sehiffenberg, near Giessen ; at Schima and Hauenstein in Bohemia ; near Eschwege in Hesse ; at Oberstein in Birkenfeld, im planted on agate in sUiceous geodes ; at Kongsberg in Norway ; with analcite in the amygdaloid of Dumbartonshire. Named from '-p/io's, joint, and rt/iva, to cut, aUuding to' the fact that the octahedron (made by the planes 1) divides parallel to the plane that passes through the terminal edges. On eryst. see Levy's Heuland ; Descloizeaux, Ann. d. M, IV. ix. 339, and Min, i. 412. The prismatic angle 124\u00b0 47' gives for the prism i-2 the angle 87\u00b0 26' and 92\u00b0 34', which is near the angle in phUlipsite ; so that whUe phiUipsite has the 0. ratio for bases and sihca of a bisilicate and the angle I A I oi pyroxene, harmotome has the 0. ratio nearly and angle I A I of horn blende. Damour and Descloizeaux show morvenite to be harmotome (Anu. d. M, IV. ix. 339). The name Andreolite of Delametherie (derived from the locality at Andreasberg) has the priority, and also Ercinite of Napione ; but Haiiy substituted harmotome. of no better signification, and all subsequent mineralogists have foUowed him. 391.

Abundant on the Faroe Islands, in Iceland, and on the Isle of Skye, in amygdaloid; also found on the Isle of Arran, Scotland ; in Dumbartonshire, at Long Craig, and at KUpatrick, Scot land, in red crystals ; at Kincardine, Kilmalcolm, Campsie, Scotland ; at the Giant's Causeway, in the Mourne Mts, etc., Ireland ; at Androasberg in the Harz, and Kongsberg and Arendal in Norway, with iron ore ; in the Vendayah Mts, Hindostan, in large translucent crystals having a reddish tinge ; also in the Nerbudda valley and in the Bombay Presidency ; a brown variety on granite, at the copper mines of Gustafsberg, near Fahlun in Sweden ; at Andreasberg, Kongsberg, etc. \u25a0 Sphcerost'dbile occurs in minute spheres over faroelite in Skye ; at Storr (anal. 13, 14) ; and at Quirang, in spheres as large as a pea. In North America, sparingly in smaU crystals at Chester and the Charlestown syenite quarries, Mass. ; at the gneiss quarry, Thachersville, Conn, in crystals lining cavities in coarse granite ; at Hadlyme, in radiated forms on gneiss, associated with epidote, garnet, and apatite ; at Phillips town, N. Y, in crystals or fan-like groups ; opposite West Point, in a vein of decomposing bluish feldspar, intersecting gneiss, in honey-yeUow crystals ; in the greenstone of Piermont, in minute crystals ; in scopiform crystals of a duU yeUow color, near PeekskUl, N. Y. ; and at Bergen HiU, New Jersey, in smaU but bright crystals ; also at the Michipicoton Islands, Lake Superior ; at Partridge Island, Nova Scotia, forming a perpendicular vein from 3 to 4 inches thick, and from 30 to 60 feet long, intersecting amygdaloid, its colors white and flesh-red ; also at Isle Haute, Digby Neck, GuUiver's Hole, Black Rock, Cape Blomidon, HaU's Harbor, Long Point. The name stilbite is from -WA/? ., lustre ; and desmine from iiupri, a bundle. The species stUbite, as adopted by Hauy, included Strahlzeolith Wern. (radiated zeolite, or the above), and Blatterzeo- Hth Wern. (foliated zeoUte, or the species heulandite beyond). The former was the typical part of the species, and is the first mentioned in the description ; and the latter (made the variety stilbite anamorphigue) he added to the species, as he observes, with much hesitation. In 1817, Breit haupt separated the two zeolites, and caUed the former desmine and the latter euzeolite, thus throwing aside entirely, contrary to rule and propriety, Haiiy's name stilbite, which should have been accepted by him in place of desmine, it being the typical part of his species. In 1822 Brooke (apparently unaware of what Breithaupt had done) used stilbite for the first, and named the other heulandite. In this he has been foUowed by the French and English mineralogists ; whUe the Germans have unfortunately foUowed Breithaupt. Alt: \u2014 Stilbite has been observed changed to quartz. 393.

Red varieties occur at Campsie in SterUngshire, with red stilbite ; also in Fassa Valley, Tyrol ; and brown in ore beds at Arendal. At Peter's Point, Nova Scotia, it occurs in amygdaloid, presenting white and flesh-red colors, and associated with laumontite, apophyUite, thomsonite, etc. ; also at Cape Blomidon, in crystals an inch and a half in length ; at Martial's Cove, Isle Hante, Partridge Island, Swan's Creek, Two Islands, HaU's Harbor, Long Point. In the United States, with stilbite and chabazite on gneiss, at Hadlyme, Ct, and Chester, Mass. ; with these minerals and datolite, apophyUite, etc., in amygdaloid at Bergen HiU, New Jersey ; sparingly at Kipp's Bay, New York Island, on gneiss, along with stUbite; at MeKinney's quarry, Rittenhouse Lane, near Philadelphia, sparingly; on north shore of Lake Superior, between Pigeon Bay and Fond du Lac ; in minute crystals, seldom over half a line long, with hay denite, at Jones's Falls, near Baltimore, on a syenitic schist (Levy's beaumoniite, which is crystal lographicaUy and opticaUy identical with heulandite). Named after the EngUsh mineralogist, H. Heuland. Cerinite How (Ed. N. Phil.

The Margarophyllites, whose general characteristics are mentioned on page 393, have the crystallization of the micas, and the name alludes to the pearly folia. Massive varieties are, however, much the most common with a large part of the species, and they often have the compactness of clay or wax. Talc, pyrophyllite, serpentine, are examples of species presenting both extremes of structure ; while pinite occurs, as thus far known, only in the compact condition. The proportion of silica varies widely, the oxygen ratio between it and the bases having the limits 3 : 1 and i : 1, corresponding- to tersilicates at one extreme and the lower of subsilicates at the other. JBut, reckoning the water, or part of it, among the bases, the species may all be arranged under the heads of Bisilicates, Unisilicates, and Subsilicates ; and, although there must be much that is hypothetical in such an arrangement, the method is adopted beyond. This method of arrangement is in fact no more arbitrary than the common one of making no account of the water. Talc has the oxygen ratio for the silica, bases, 2| : 1 ; but, at the same time, it contains water, and holds it even when highly heated, thereby indicating that part, at least, of the water is basic ; and with basic water the ratio may be 2 : 1 , or that of a true BisU icate. The arrangement of talc at the head of the Bisilicates appears, therefore, not to be alto gether arbitrary. PyrophyUite is a true alumina talc, it having the same oxygen ratio as talc, and like structure, lustre, greasy feel, and even range of color ; and it has its place, therefore, next to talc, among the Bisilicates. Serpentine has not sUica enough for a Bisilicate ; but, with half of its water basic, it is a Unisilicate. Kaolinite is identical with serpentine in oxygen ratio, as pyrophylUte is with talc, and is similarly a UnisUicate. Pinite has the same ratio, excepting half less of water, and is strictly an alumina-alkali serpentine ; and palagonite is another of like ratio and characters. These species, moreover, are all related to the margarodites or hydrous micas. In the foUowing table the species are distributed under the three heads above mentioned. The catalogue of the species and their formulas in the first two of these subdivisions is foUowed by a table containing the oxygen ratio for the protoxyds, sesquioxyds, silica, and water, and also, in another column, those for the bases, sUica, and water ; and under fl in the latter, a fraction js added in parentheses, which indicates what proportion of the water (when any) i3 made basic in the formulas."], [504, "448 OXYGEN COMPOUNDS.

An impure slaty talc, harder than ordinary talc. Talcose slate is a dark, slaty, argiUaceous rock, having a somewhat greasy feel, which it owes to the presence of more or less talc. Pyrallolite is partly pseudomorphous steatite, after pyroxene, like rensselaerite. It varies ex ceedingly in composition, as shown by Arppe and others, and as recognized by A. E. Norden skiold in his Finland Mineralogy, the sUica ranging from 49 to 76 p. c It includes pyroxene, therefore, in various stages of steatitic alteration. Three analyses are given beyond (Nos. 37-39), and others on p. 221, under pyroxene. Anal. 40 is of the same material from Finland, referred by Scheerer to his pitkar andite. The true pitkarandite is simUar, but afforded 12-71 p. c. of Fe, and 9-17 Ca (see anal, p. 221). Comp.\u2014 0. ratio for Mg, Si=l : 21, with a varying amount pf water in both talc and steatite, from a fraction of a per cent, to 7 p. c. In some, the ratio for Mg, gi, A=l : 21 : 1, correspond nig to the formula, the water being basic, (J Mg+1 A) Si=SUica 62-8, magnesia 33\"5, water 3-7 = 100.

Not decomposed by acids. Rensselaerite is decomposed by concentrated sulphuric acid. Obs. \u2014 Talc or steatite is a very common mineral, and in the latter form constitutes extensive beds in some regions. It is often associated with serpentine, talcose or chloritie schist, and dolo mite, and frequently contains crystals of dolomite, breunnerite, asbestus, actinolite, tourmaline, magnetite. Steatite is the material of many pseudomorphs, among which the most common are those after pyroxene, hornblende, mica, scapolite, and spinel. The magnesian minerals are those which com monly afford steatite by alteration; whUe those like scapoUte and nephelite, which contain soda and no magnesia, most frequently change to pinite-like pseudomorphs. There are also steatitic pseudomorphs after quartz, dolomite, topaz, chiastoUte, staurolite, cyanite, garnet, idocrase, chrysohte, gehlenite. Hunt has shown that talc (or steatite) is a rare mineral in Azoic or pr\u00e6sUurian crystaUine rocks The occurrence of renseUaerite in these rocks in northern New York is no exception, any more than pyraUoUte in those of Finland, these being products of subsequent alteration or metamor phism.

The so-caUed rensselaerite occurs in northern New York, in the towns of Antwerp (with the form of pyroxene), Fowler, Dekalb, Edwards (at tlie iron mine, a white variety, from which ink stands have been made), RusseL Gouverneur, Canton (in small crystals), Hermon (in large masses, erystaUine massive) ; and in Canada, at Grenville, Charleston Lake, near BrockviUe, Rawdon, and Ramsay. It is often associated with crystalline Umestone, and graduates at times imperceptibly into serpentine ; its rock-masses are irregular, and are seldom continuous for more than three or four hundred yards. Slabs of steatite are extensively employed as fire stones in furnaces and stoves. It may be turned in a lathe, or formed into tubes \"by boring. The fine-grained varieties (including the rensselaerite) are sometimes carved into ornaments, etc. When ground, it is used for diminishing friction. It is also employed in the manufacture of some kinds of porcelain. Venetian talc is used for removing oU stains from wooUen cloth, etc. A white steatite of a silvery-pearly lustre was the Magnetis of Theophrastus \u2014 a stone, accord ing to this author, of sUvery lustre, occurring in large masses, and easily cut or wrought. The word is the origin osthe modern magnesia. Agricola, in his \" Interpretatio Rerum MetaUicarum\" appended to hi3 works (1546), gives as a German synonym of Magnetis, Talck; and he adds, as other synonyms, Silberweiss and Katzensilber, and also Glimmer, the German now for mica, evi dently confounding the two minerals. He mentions its resistance to fire, and speaks of it as lap is scissilis. Other later writers derive the word talc from the Arabic talk; and Aldrovandus (1648) states that it is of Moorish introduction, adding, \" Hoc nomen apud Mauritanos stellam significare dici tur,\" Stella Terr\u0153 \u2014 Star of the Earth \u2014 being one old name of the mineral, given it because \" like a star and with sUvery lustre it shines.\" C\u00e6sius (\" De Mineralibus,\" 1636) writes the word Ul Latin, Talchus, but most other writers of that century, Talcum. The word stealilis occurs in Pliny as the name of a stone resembling fat ; but no further descrip tion is given that can with certainty identify it. Rensselaerite was named after Stephen Yan Rensselaer, of Albany, N. Y. 400 A.

Obs. \u2014 Compact pyrophyUite is the material or base of some schistose rocks. The fohated variety is often the gangue of cyanite. PyrophyUite occurs in the Urals, between Pyschminsk and Beresof ; at Westana, Sweden ; the Horrsjoberg in Elfdalen, with cyanite; near Ottrez in Luxembourg; in BrazU. Also in white stellate aggregations in Cottonstone Mtn., Mecklenburg Co., N. C. ; in Chesterfield Dist, S. G, with lazulite and cyanite ; in Lincoln Co., Ga., on Graves Mtn. ; in Arkansas, at the KeUogg lead mine, near Little Rock.

Sci., in. 332) from \"Brunswick \" (should have been Unity), Maine, obtained the composition of a pyrophyUite.

He ob serves that more or less carbonate of magnesia is often found in the meerschaum (Am. J. Sci., II. vii. 286) ; also found in Greece ; at Hrubschitz in Moravia ; in Morocco ; at VaUecas in Spain, in extensive beds, affording a light but valuable building stone. The mineral from Morocco, caUed in French Pierre de savon de Maroc, is used in place of soap at the Moorish baths in dif ferent places in Algeria. The word meerschaum is German for sea-froth, and alludes to its lightness and color. Sepiolite Glocker, is from af/iria, cuttle-fish, the bone of which is light and porous ; and being also a pro duction osthe sea, \"deinde spumam marinam significabat,\" says Glocker. Brongniart, in the first edition of his Mineralogy (1807), included under Magnesite (1) the car bonate, which he calls MitchelVs magnesite (see under Magnesite) ; (2) the hydrous sUicate or meerschaum ; and (3) the siliceous carbonate from Baudissero in Piedmont ; he putting \"Mitchell's magnesite,\" the carbonate, first. Karsten, in his \" Tabellen,\" pubUshed the next year, separ ated from meerschaum the carbonate and adopted for it the name magnesite, and in this he has been foUowed by aU German and most other mineralogists. The appUeation of the name magne site to the hydrous sUicate, done in the later writings of Brongniart and by subsequent French mineralogists, is hence in violation of the law of priority. 403.

The glauconite grains are most abundant in the \" green sand \" of the chalk formation, some times constituting 75 to 90 p. c. of the whole. They are often casts of the sheUs of Rhizopods. The material has also been found in Silurian rocks, and beds of other geological periods, and even in the sheUs of recent Rhizopods, and in fragments of coral obtained in deep sea soundings (Am. J.

Delesse states that the serpentine of Odern graduates into feldspar, and appears to have been derived from the alteration of that mineral. Other kinds are pseudomorphs after pyroxene, amphibole, spinel, chondrodite, garnet, phlogopite, sphene, and chromic iron. Even the foliated and fibrous kinds may be partly pseudomorphous. If marmolite or thermophyllite is truly crystallized serpentine, as seems probable, the crystallization of the species is actually micaceous, hke that of chlorite and talc. F. Seepentine Rooks. Serpentine often constitutes rock-masses. It frequently occurs mixed with more or less of dolomite, magnesite, or calcite, making a rock of clouded green, sometimes veined with white or pale green, called verd-antique, or ophiolite. Ophiolite is styled by Hunt (1) dolomitic, (2) magnesitic, or (3) calcitic, according as the ser pentine is mixed with dolomite, magnesite, or calcite. Serpentine rock is sometimes mottled with red, or has something of the aspect of a red 412 porphyry ; the reddish portions containing an unusual amount of oxyd ofiron. Any serpentine rock cut into slabs and polished, is called serpentine marble. 30"], [522, "466 OXYGEN COMPOUNDS.

Serpentine admits of a high polish, and may be turned in a lathe, and is sometimes employed aa a material for ornaments, vases, boxes, ete. At ZOblitz in Saxony, Bayreuth, and in Franconia, several hundred persons are employed in this manufacture. Verd-antique marble is clouded with green of various shades, and is a beautiful material for table and ornamental indoor work. Ex posed to the weather it wears uneven, owing to its unequal harduess, and soon loses its poUshed surface. The names Serpentine, Ophite, Lapis colubrinus, amide to the green serpent-like cloudings of the serpentine marble.

Bastite is an impure foUated serpentine, occurring imbedded in serpentine rock, and is supposed to be a result of the alteration of a foliated mineral of the Pyroxene group, as long since announced by G. Rose. That of Baste, the original locality, was derived, according to Streng, from the enstatite (protobastite) of the region (see Enstatite, p. 208). It has H=3-5\u2014 4 ; G.=25\u2014 2-76 ; lustre metaUic pearly, bronze-like (to which the German name schiller aUudes), to vitreous, and color leek-green to olive- and pistachio-green, and pinchbeck-brown. Besides the direction of perfect cleavage, there are two inclined to one another about 87\u00b0 (Naumann), which is the cleav age of enstatite and hypersthene. According to Descloizeaux, it is probably orthorhombic, and has a negative bisectrix, which is normal to the plane of cleavage, and gives for the axial diver gence 60\u00b0 to 70 .

Obs. \u2014 The pholerite of GuUlemin was from nodules of iron ore in the coal mines of Fins, Dept. of AUier, France. The Chemnitz mineral is from Niederrabenstein (and also at Zeisigwald, etc.), where it constitutes a rock caUed by Naumann pelitische felsitluffe in the Lower Coal formation ; it is various in color, but is shown to consist of crystaUine, colorless, doubly refracting scales. The Schemnitz is the gangue of diaspore, and it may be kaoUnite impure with diaspore. The Jack sonvUle is a kaolin, and may be kaolinite; the analysis afforded 4-86 of free sUica, and 0-90 of undecomposed material which above is excluded. The analyses of kaolinite have been referred to pholerite under the idea that GuUlemin's analy sis was incorrect. But the analysis by Knop appears to show that there is a species with the pholerite composition, but not differing from kaoUnite in its physical or crystaUographic characters. Named from 0_A._, a scale. 418A. Teratolite Glocker (Grundr, 544, 1839 ; Terra miraculosa Saxoni\u00e6 C. Richter, 1732 ; Sax onische Wundererde of old Germ, authors; Eiseusteinmark Breith., Char, 147, 1823, 301, 1832). A. Knop holds (Jahrb. Min, 1859, 546) that the teratohte is an impure Uthomarge-like pholerite, closely related to the mineral from Chemnitz. It is described as having H.=2 \u2014 2|, and G. = 2-49 \u2014 2-5 ; color varied with lavender and other shades of blue, and spots of red, and rarely pearl gray. It is from an amygdaloidal rock overlaid by coal strata at Planitz near Zwickau in Saxony, It contains much oxyd of iron ; but, according to Knop, probably is a mixture of pholerite with some free quartz, pulverized feldspar, hydrate of iron, carbouate of lime, and magnesia.

Obs. \u2014 Ordinary kaolin is a result of the decomposition of aluminous minerals, especiaUy the feldspars of granitic and gneissoid rocks and porphyries. In some regions where these rocks have decomposed on a large scale, the resulting clay remains in vast beds of kaolin, usuaUy more or less mixed with free quartz, and sometimes with oxyd of iron from some of the other minerals present. Pure kaolinite in scales often occurs in connection with iron ores of the Coal formation. It sometimes forms extensive beds in the Tertiary formation, as near Richmond, Va. Also met with accompanying diaspore and emery or corundum. Occurs in the coal formation at Cache- Apres in Belgium ; also in the same at Schlan in Bohemia, and at Rone; hi argiUaceous schist atLodeve, Dept. of Herault, France; at the Einigkeit mine at Brand, near Freiberg, and elsewhere in Saxony ; as kaoUn at Diendorf (Bodenmais) in Bavaria;"], [531, "HYDROUS 6ILICATES, MARGAKOPHYLLITE SECTION. 475 at Zeisigwald near Chemnitz ; as the gangue of topaz at Schneckenstein ; with emery and mar- gante at Naxos; as the gangue of diaspore at Schemnitz; as the material of pseudomorphs aster prosopite at Altenberg (anal. 8), showing weU the hexagonal scales (Johnson & Blake) \u2022 with fluor at Zinnwald, a white powdery substance consisting of hexag. scales ; at RochUtz (car'nat) in a porphyritic rock ; in seams in an argfflaceous rock on the Tweed (tuesite), the Latin name of which place is Tuesis. At Yrieix, near Limoges, is the best locality of kaolin in Europe (a discovery of 1765); it affords material for the famous Sevres porcelain manufactory. The dark-colored clay of Stourbridge, England, is made up in large part of transparent lamin\u00e6 (J. & B.). _ In the U. States, kaolin occurs at Newcastle and WUmington, Del. ; at various localities Lo the limonite region of Vermont (at Branford, etc.), Massachusetts, Pennsylvania ; Jacksonville, Ala. ; Edgefield, S. C. ; near Augusta, Ga. ; and Johnson & Blake observed transparent hexagonal scales abundantly in a blue fire-clay from Mt Savage, Md. ; in the white clay of Brandon, Vt, Beekman, N. Y, Perth Amboy, N. J, Reading, and a locality in Chester Co, Pa, Long Island, and in white and colored clays of various other places. Near Richmond, Va, the mealy constitutes a bed of considerable extent in the Tertiary formation ; at Tamaqua and Summit Hill in Carbon Co, Pa, it occurs in the Coal formation ; in a sandstone of the Quebec group, just below the Chaudiere Falls, filling seams or fissures, often i in. thick, having an unctuous feel, and consist- Lag of minute soft scales. The characters of this species have been weU defined, and its relation to kaolin explained, in an article by Johnson k Blake (1. a), by whom the name kaolinite was proposed They show that Forchammer's formula for kaolin is the true formula, and also that of kaoUnite ; and that the two are one in species chemicaUy and physicaUy. They point out that much Uthomarge should be included, and that the hexagonal scales, which the massive mineral presents under the microscope, may be de'tected in aU kaolin, and also in some dark -colored fire-clays, although much mixed with impurities. They also show that the plasticity of the kaoUnite depends on the fineness of the material, aud that kinds not plastic in water may be rendered so by fine trituration. They suggest that the distinction of kaolinite aud pholerite may disappear on further chemical investigation. The earhest recognition of the mineral distinctively is by Werner in 1780 (1. a), who placed it under tale. It afterward took the name of earthy talc, as used by Hoffmann in 1789 (1. c). The acute Karsten pronounced it a scaly clay (schuppige Thon), and arranged it accordingly in 1808 (1. c.) ; but no author of the next twenty years fuUy adopted his view. In 1807 Brongniart made the species nacrite (1. a), for a fusible, anhydrous, pearly potash-mica, analyzed by Vauquelin (affording Si 50, Si 26, Pe 5, Ca 1-5, K 17 -5), aud referred to it doubtingly the earthy talc, in a note, without any knowledge of it. Hausmann, in 1813 (Handb, 500), says that the schuppige Talc of Andreasberg La the flarz (which he says is wrongly called buttermilchsilber) may perhaps be schuppige Hydrargillite (hydrate of alumina) or Thon, but an analysis was needed to decide it. Hoff- mann, in 1815 (Handb, U. b, 268), makes it his first variety of talc, but queries its nature, and cites an analysis by John of a hydrate of alumina. In 1832 (1. c.) Breithaupt gave the Saxon mineral the name nacrite (nakrit), without any appar- ent reference in the place to Brongniart's or Vauquelin's previous use of this name. But he at the same time questions whether it may not be identical with pholerite (which had been described in 1825). Since then the species has been united to pholerite, under the idea that pholerite was incorrectly analyzed by GuUlemin (which may stiU be true) ; and Breithaupt, in 1841 (Handb, 391), adopts this view, putting pholerite of GuUlemin under nacrite ; and, moreover, he attributes his name nacrite to Vauquelin. This was the state osthe question when the description of kaoUnite by Johnson and Blake appeared. Breithaupt, in 1832, stated that the scales were hexagonal ; and again in his account of the \" nakrit \" of Brand near Freiberg. A. Knop, in 1 859 (Jahrb. Min. 1 859, 594), describes with detail the crystaUization of the Schneckenstein mineral ; he makes it rhombic, with the planes I, O, H, and gives the angle I A 7=118\u00b0. Descloizeaux, in his Mineralogy (1862), shows that opticaUy the scales from Brand, near Freiberg, are orthorhombic, and makes the angles 120\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 ; and Johnson & Blake give the same angles as a mean of their measurements of various kaoUnites. The name Kaolin is a corruption of the Chinese Kauling, meaning high-ridge, the name of a hUl near Jauchau Fu, where the material is obtained ; and the petuntze (peh-tun-tsz) of the Chinese, with which the kaolin is mixed in China for the manufacture of porcelain, is a quartzose feld- spathic rock, consisting largely of quartz (S. W. WiUiams). The word porcelain was first given to the china-ware by the Portuguese, from its resemblance to the nacre of the sea-sheUs Porcel- lana (Cypr\u00e6as), they supposing it to be made from egg-shells, fish-glue, and fish scales (S. W. Williams). 420. HALLOYSITE. HaUoysite Berthier, Ann. Ch. Phys, xxxiL 332, 1826. Galapektit, Gummit, Breith., Char, 99, 1832. Glagerit Breith., Handb, 357, 1841. Smectite Salvetat, Ann. Ch.

Smectite of Salvetat is greenish, and in certain states of humidity appears transparent and almost gelatinous ; it is from Conde, near Houdan, France. Breithaupt's Gummite (Char, 99, 1832) is a \" gum-like haUoysite,\" not adhering to the tongue, from Anglar, though in his Handbuch, where the same locality is mentioned, he quotes Berthier's analysis of collyrite from the Pyrenees. Glossecollite is milk-white and earthy, but becomes translucent on the edges and a little opaline in water. It forms a seam 1 in. thick in a sUiceous SUurian rock iu Rising Fawn, Dade Co., Georgia. 3. Lenzinite is earthy, compact, white, translucent, and somewhat opaline, from Kail in the Eifel ; and brownish, from rifts in pegmatite at La YUate, near Chanteloube, in France. Leonhard considered it (Handb, 1826) a decomposed semiopal. It is described as not gelatinizing in acids. Named after the German mineralogist Lenz. Nertschinskite of Razoumovski, a whitish or bluish earth from Nertschinsk, has been referred to lenzinite. Severite, or lenzinite of St. Sever, was first noticed in 1818, and analyzed in that year by PeUetier (J. de Phys, lxxxvi. 251, 1818). It has sometimes the semitransparency of opal, a soft feel, adheres strongly to the tongue, and makes no paste with water ; it is from the upper arenaceous stratum in the gypsiferous Tertiary at St. Sever in France. It is not clear whether it belongs here or to kaoUnite. 4. Bole, in part, may belong here ; that is, those colored, unctuous clays containing more or less oxyd of iron, which also have about 24 p. c. of water; the iron gives it a brownish, yellow ish, or reddish color ; but more investigation is needed before it is known that they are not mere mixtures. Oropion of Glocker (Syn, 188, 1847) is a dark brown to black bole ; it is the Bergseife of Werner (Ueb.

They occur in a lava cavern on the south side of the extinct volcanic island of Upolu, of the Navigator or Samoa group; the cavern was a passage some hun dreds of yards long, entered about a mile and a half from the sea by a perpendicular descent of 25 feet, and extending toward and beneath the sea, and also up the mountain to an unascertained distance. Its sides and bottom were in places covered with the samoite, which had been formed from the percolating waters. The overlying rock was about 1 5 feet thick. Samoite of SUUman, Jr. (Dana's Expl. Exp. Geol. Rep, 732), is a kind' of feldspar incorrectly analyzed ; probably labradorite."], [535, "HYDROUS SILICATES, MARGAROPHYLLITE SECTION. 479 422 PINITE. Amorphous ; granular to cryptocrystalline ; usually the latter. Also in crystals, and sometimes with cleavage, but only because pseudomorphs, the form and cleavage being those of the minerals from which derived. Rarely a submicaceous cleavage, which may belong to the species. H. = 2-5 \u2014 3-5. G. = 2-6 \u2014 2-85. Lustre feeble, waxy.

Comp., Var \u2014 Pinite is essentiaUy a hydrous alkaUno sUicate. Being a result of alteration, and amorphous, the mineral varies much in composition, and numerous species have been made of the mineral in its various conditions. If crystals of stauroUte may vary 20 p. c. in the propor tion of silica, much more should a massive mineral which has been made by the metamorphism of other minerals. Variations would naturaUy exist from the presence of some of the unaltered original mineral, or of some of its ingredients in an uncombined state ; and in the case of rock masses, from mixture with free quartz, partially altered or unaltered feldspar, or other substances. The varieties of pinite here admitted agree closely in physical characters, and in the amount of potash and water present, and their variations are such as are reasonably attributed to the above causes. The 0. ratio for the bases, silica, and water, deduced from the mean of the analyses, is 3 : 4 : 1, whence the formula (iS'+t (fl3, fi))2Si3=, if ft=__ and ft3 : fi=l : 8, Sihca 46-0, alumina 35-1, potash 120, water 6-9=100 ; or, if ft=JMg+t K and fi3 : fi=l : 5, =Silica 45-9, alumina 32-7, magnesia 2-5, potash 12-0, water 6-9=100; or, if Mg : K=5 : 7 and ft3 : fi=l : 5, =Silica 46*2, alumina 33'0, magnesia 3'3, potash 10-6, water 6-9 = 100. The mineral is related chemically, as it is also physicaUy, to serpentine (which has the O. ratio 3:4:2); and it is an alkali-alumiua serpentine, as pyrophyUite is an alumina talc. The different kinds are either pseudomorphous crystals after (1) iolite ; (2) nephelite ; (3) scap oUte; (4) some kind of feldspar; (5) spodumene : or (6) other aluminous mineral; or (7) dissem inated masses resembling indurated talc, steatite, lithomarge, or kaolinite, also a result of altera tion; or (8) the prominent or sole constituent of a metamorphic rock, which is sometimes apinite schist (analogous to, and often much resembling, talcose schist, and stiU more closely related to pyrophyUite schist). As argiUaceous shale often consists of pulverized feldspar, its conversion into pinite schist would be whoUy simUar to the pseudomorphism of a feldspar crystal into pinite. It is not possible to arrange all the varieties under the above heads. The foUowing are the names that have been introduced, and the characters of the substances to which they are applied : Var. 1. Pinite. Speck stein [fr. the Pini mine at Aue, near Schneeberg] Hoffmann, Bergm. J, 156, 1789; Kieselerde + Thonerde, etc, Klapr., ib, 227, 1790. Pinit Karsten, Tab, 28, 73, 1800.) The original pinite is in 6- to 9-sided prisms ; color brown. Occurs in granite, and is supposed to be pseudomorphous after iolite. Also found at St. Pardoux in Auvergne, at the Puy de Dome, in decomposing feldspar porphyry ; at Miihlenthal, near Elbingerode, the prisms 12-sided, lustreless, with H. =2 -3. AnaL 1-7. 2. GieseckI-E (fr. Greenland, AUan, Ann. PhU, ii. 1813). In 6-sided prisms, probably pseudo morphous after nephelite. fl.=3-5. G.=2*78 \u2014 2*85. Color grayish-green, olive-green, to brownish. Brought by Giesecke from AkuUiardsuk and Kangerdluarsuk, Greenland, where it occurs in compact feldspar Also of simUar characters from a pyroxene rock at Diana, N. Y, the prisms often large, and with the basal edges replaced by a plane inclined about 135\u00b0 to the base. Anal. 8-11. (b) Lythrodes Karsten (Mag. Ges. Fr. BerUn, iv. 78, 1810; John, Ch. Unt, i. 171; SpUttriger Wernerit Hausm., 520, 1813) has a Uttle less silica and more alumina than the above (anaL 12), but is otherwise essentiaUy the same ; it is imperfectly lameUar, scaly in fracture, greasy in lustre ; yeUow, flesh-red, brownish-red, or spotted with greenish and yellowish ; G.=2-51 ; and is from the zircon-syenite of Fredericksvarn and Laurvig. It is regarded as altered nephehte. Of like composition and origin is the (c) Liebenerite Marignac (BibL Univ, vi. 293, 1848), from a porphy ritic feldspathic rock of Mt. Yiesena, in Fleimsthal (anal. 13-15) ; it occurring in 6-sided prisms without cleavage ; H.=3-5; G.=2'814, v. Hauer; 2*806, Breith. ; lustre somewhat greasy ; color greenish-gray ; and without double refraction. (d) Dysyntribite Shepard (Proc. Am. Assoc, 311, 1851, Am. J. Sei, II. xii. 209) is essentially the same with the gieseckite from Diana and elsewhere, Lewis Co, N. Y. ; it constitutes masses or a rock sometimes slaty in structure, and somewhat resembles serpentine, though more waxy in aspect' (anaL 18, 19); H.=3-3-5; G. = 2-76-2-81; colors often mottled, usuaUy greenish, some times reddish or spotted with red. Associated with phlogopite, etc. (e) Parophite T. S. Hunt (Rep. G. Can, 1852, 1863) is similar to dysyntribite, but less pure;"], [536, "480 OXYGEN COMPOUNDS. the analyses vary considerably (anal. 20-23), it being, as regarded by Hunt, a rock, and not a simple mineral ; the name alludes to a resemblance to serpentine ; H.=2'5\u2014 3, and it cuts hke massive talc; G=2-7 \u2014 2\"784; 2-90, fr. Pownal; colors greenish, yellowish, reddish, grayish. It constitutes a schistose rock at St. Nicholas and Famine R, Can, being an altered shale of the Lower SUurian (Quebec group) ; also occurs in Stanstead, Can, on the E. shore of L. Mem phremagog, with chloritic schist; and at Pownal, Vermont, as a bluish-gray schist, that had been considered a taloose or magnesian schist. (/) A green mineral from the Grindelwald glacier (anal. 24), having H.=3-5\u2014 4, and G.=2'85, a somewhat waxy lustre, resembling a compact green talc, and described by FeUenberg (Ber. N Ges. Berne, 1 866) is very similar to parophite. (g) Pinitoid, described by A. Knop (Jahrb. Min. 1859, 558) as a rock, is Uke dysyntribite in characters, and a schist caUed \"pinitoid schist\" approaches parophite. Pinitoid (anal. 25) has H.=2-5 ; G.=2-788 ; color leek-, oU-, and grayish-green. Occurs in the region between Freiberg and Chemnitz, Saxony, pseudomorphous aster feldspar, in a half-decomposed granitic porphyry, constituting about 25 p. c. of the rock. 3. Wilsonite T. S. Hunt (Rep. G. Can, 1853, 1863) is a pinite pseudomorph, with the form and cleavage of scapolite; H. = 3-5; G = 2-76\u2014 2-78 ; lustre somewhat pearly; color rose-red; frag ments translucent; anal. 16, 17. It is from Bathurst, Can, where it was first found by Dr. WUson ; also St. Lawrence Co, N. Y. Terenite(v. 323), from Antwerp, St. Lawrence Co., may be the same. 4. Polyargite and Rosite of Svanberg ( Ak. H. Stockh., 1 840) are close to the preceding in composition. Rosite (anal. 28) is a granular red mineral, occurring in granular limestone at Aker in Sodermanland ; H=:2-5; G. = 2-72. G. Rose and others make it altered anorthite. Polyargite (anaL 26, 27) occurs in reddish lameUar masses at Tunaberg, Sweden ; H=4 ; G.=2-76S ; named from -oA-s, much, and dpySs, sparkle. The name Pyrrholite has been given to a reddish lameUar mineral from Tunaberg, which is very similar to polyargite (Descl. Min, i. 302, 1862) ; it has H.= 3\u20144; and cleavage surfaces incUned together about 87\u00b0; and is apparently anorthite less altered than in rosite and polyargite. It is opticaUy biaxial. The \" pinitoid \" of Sasbachwald, Duchy of Baden (anal. 85), is altered oligoclase, according to Sandberger ; H.=2'5. 5. Killinite Thomson (Min, i. 330, 1836), from KUliney Bay, Ireland, has been stated to have the form and cleavage of spodumene, a mineral that occurs in the vicinity. It has H.=4; G.= 2-56\u20142-66, Thomson; 2-678\u2014 2-688, Galbraith ; lustre weak vitreous ; color greenish-gray, brown ish, or yellowish; anal. 29-33. 6. Other pinite has passed under the name of lithomarge (Steinmark Germ.). That of Zorge (anal. 36) is green, and has G.=3-086, Ramm. The Schemnitz mineral (anal. 37) occurs with dUl niteand kaolinite as the gangue of diaspore, and is gray or greenish-gray in color, with H.=2-5 \u2014 3, G.=2-735. AnaL 47 is of a lithomarge from Schlackenwald. That of Ems (anal. 48) is green to white, and kaolin-like in consistence, and occurs in clefts in the Spirifer sandstone. The compact talc of Klammberg, Tyrol, is probably pinite or agahnatolite in constitution. 7. Agalmatolite (AgalmatoUthus, BUdstein (fr. China), Klapr., Beitr, iL 184, 1797. Pagodite Napione, J. de Phys, xlvi. 220, 1798). Like ordinary massive pinite in its amorphous compact texture, lustre, and other physical characters, but contains more sihca, so as to afford the formula of a bisUicate, or nearly, and it may be a distinct species. Yet, as above observed, the excess of sihca is possibly from free quartz or feldspar as impurity. The Chinese has H.=2 \u2014 2'5 ; G.= 2-785\u20142-815, Klapr. Colors same as for pinite, usuaUy grayish, grayish-green, brownish, yeUow ish. AnaL 38^41. A simUar mineral in composition comes from Nagyag in Transylvania, and Ochsenkopf near Schwarzenberg in Saxony (anal. 44). Agalmatolite was named from -y_A^_, an image, and pagodite from pagoda, the Chinese carving the soft stone into miniature pagodas, images, eta Part of the so-called agalmatoUte of China is true pinite in composition, another part is compact pyrophyUite (p. 455), and stUl another steatite (p. 453). (Brush, Am J. ScL, II. xxvi. 64.) Oncosin v. KobeU (J. pr. Ch, ii. 295, 1834) is related iu composition (anal. 45), and has H.=2; G.=2-8; color apple-green to grayish or brownish; translucent; it occurs in roundish masses imbedded in dolomite with mica, at Passecken near Tamsweg, in Salzburg, (c) Obsite (Oosit Marx, ib, iii. 216, 1834), another related compound (anal. 43), is white to reddish or brownish-red, and occurs in 6- and 12-sided prisms; it is from the Oos valley, duchy of Baden, occurring in what is caUed pinite-porphyry. (d) Gongylile (Gongylit Thoreld, Act. Soc Sci. Fenn, iu. 815, A. Nord, Beskrifn. Finl. Min, 146, 1855) is yellowish or yeUowish-brown, and has cleavage in two directions; with H. =4\u2014 5- G. = 2-7 ; anal. 42. From a schist caUed talcose schist at Kimsamo in Finland.

Obs. \u2014 Gieseckite has been attributed by many authors to the alteration of nephehte (el\u00e6olite). Pisani (C. R, lxii 1324) has found the latter mineral from Brevig, Norway, partly altered to a brick-red material which is true gieseckite in nature and composition. On the same specimen is found true translucent el\u00e6olite, affording only 1'3 p. c. of water on calcination, and entirely solu ble in dUute acids ; by the side of this, red spots where alteration has commenced ; and beyond, the mineral changed to a brick -red uniform material, mostly opaque, with some trans lucent spots of unaltered el\u00e6olite. This red material afforded 5'9 p. c. of water, and dissolved only partiaUy iu dilute nitric acid, leaving an abundant red deposit. On separating the insoluble portion by treatment with cold dilute nitric acid, this afforded, on analysis, Si 46-95, Si 34-65, Pe 1-86, Mg 0-58, Ca 0-68, Na, Li 071, K 8-71, fl 5-58=99-72, thus showing that, besides taking up water, the soda of the el\u00e6olite had been replaced almost whoUy by potash. 423A.

Obs. \u2014 Tufas are formed through the action of waters, and often that of heated waters or steam accompanying an eruption of lavas, on the granulated volcanic rock, or volcanic sand ; aud in the process the protoxyd of iron of the pyroxene of the rock becomes more or less' completely changed to sesquioxyd, and water is taken up, and so the palagonite is produced. As the volcanic rock is made up generaUy of pyroxene and a feldspar always in very variable proportions, uniformity in such results of alteration is not possible. Bunsen observes that palagonite is the basis of the basaltic tufas of Germany, France, Azores, Canaries, Cape Verdes, Tortugas, and probably also of those of the Pacific Islands. Melanhydrite (anal. 14, by Wackernagel, 1. c, and Ramm. Min. Ch.) is velvet-black to brownish-black, and occurs in irregular nodules in a decomposed wacke at Schmelzerthal near Honnef, on the Rhine.

Sometimes O. ratio 1 : 9 : 12 : 2, whence, (J (A3, fl3)+f Si)2 Si3; but this divi sion belongs with damourite, if the two are distinguishable. This species appears to be often, if not always, a result of the hydration of muscovite, there being all shades of gradation between it and that species. Muscovite has the O. ratio for bases and silica of 4 : 5, or nearly; and the deficiency of base for a unisUicate here indicated appears to be the source of its tendency to take up water, the water passing iu to supply it. For analyses and localities see under Muscovite (p 309). A hydrous mica, accompanying cyanite, at Litchfield, Ct, afforded Smith & Brush (Am J.

Comp., Var. \u2014 The amorphous mineral substances here included are results of the alteration of rhodonite, in which the manganese passes from the state of protoxyd to that of sesquioxyd, and other changes take place through the presence of any ingredients in the altering infiltrating waters. A uniformity of composition is not therefore to be expected, and much doubt must exist as to the reality of the species which any chemical analyses may seem to indicate. The most recent analyses (anal. 2 to 5 below) have a correspondence in oxygen ratio which appears to show that there is among them at least one true hydrous sUicate of manganese, and that it is related in composition to hisingerite. The 0. ratio for ft+fi, Si, fl, in analysis 2 is 12-69 : 19'1 1 : 1432 ; 3, 11-56 : 18-69 : 14-86; 4, 12-11 : 19-09 : 14-02; 5, 13-04 : 18-34 : 15-44; each of which corres pond quite nearly to 2 : 3 : 2 J, and to the general hisingerite formula, (ft3, fi)2 Si3+3 aq, in which two-fifths of the water is made basic. Neotocite (anal. 4, 5) is here included by A. E. Nordenskiold along with stratopeite, and good authority appears thus to be given for setting aside the older analysis of it by Igelstrom (anal. 6). In stratopeite, G.=2'64, according to Igelstrom; in neotocite and wiltingiie, G. = 2'7 \u2014 2-8, according to N. Nordenskiold. Bahr's and Svanberg's analyses, 9-12, give a different composition, as the manganese is made sesquioxyd ; but new determinations are required before these, or the analyses of wittingite. can be taken as representing distinct chemical compounds. Bahr writes for analyses 9, 10, 11, Sn2 Si3+3 fl; and for anal. 12, obtains the O. ratio for fi+fi, Si, fl, 13-9 : 17-6 : 8-5.

Loganite of Hunt (=Pseudophite of Kenngott) is near penninite ra composition. A notice of loganite, from Calumet FaUs, Canada, is given under Altered Hornblende (p. 242), as it has the form, angles, and cleavage of that species ; and also of an allied material under Altered Pyroxene (p. 221). It has G. = 2-60\u2014 2-64; color clove-brown to chocolate-brown; lustre duU. Pseudophite of Kenngott (Ber. Ak. Wien, xvi. 1855) has the composition of loganite, but is compact massive, without cleavage, and resembles serpentine (whence the name, from Tiri.oV, false, and ophite or serpentine); H. = 25; G.=2-75 \u2014 2-77 ; lustre weak; color grayish-green, olive-green, pistachio-green; feel unctuous. It forms the gangue of enstatite (Mg Si)atZdjarin Aloysthal, Moravia. In the occurrence of a massive form, penninite is thus Uke talc, pyrophyl lite, and other related species. Descloizeaux found (Min, 436) _? A _?=65\u00b0 28' in penninite, and 0 A _?=103\u00b0 45'; and the latter in the Texas kammererite. The above angles, and figs. 414, 415, are from Cooke's paper on the latter (Am. J. Sei, H. xUv. 201), and f. 41 6 is from Kokscharof (Verh. Min. Ges. St. Pet, 1851).

Exact deductions from the analyses cannot be made until the state o! oxydation of the iron in aU cases is ascertained ; and, further, untU it is also proved that there may not be a crystaUine mixture such as is mentioned above under tabergite. The mineral often contains microscopic grains of magnetite, and these are supposed by Kenngott to occasion some of the discrepancies in the analyses.

It has since been found, and first through examinations by Kokscharof that the chloritfof Achmatovsk, and also that of Schwarzenstein and Ala the three upon which von KobeU based his description of ripidolite, are also monoclinic, and identical with ehnochlore. Ripidolite has nevertheless been, to some extent, set aside for cUnochlore, because of the confusion in the science connected with that name (see p. 502); but the latter name is very objectionable, since there is now a second monoclinic chlorite known (p. 504). The former name is a register of von KobeU's important chemical discovery that the old chlorite included two distinct species (p. 502), and ought to be retained. Talo-Chlorite op Tbavehsella occurs in large hexagonal plates regularly grouped, and presents, according to Descloizeaux, the optical characters of cUnochlore. The plates are twins, consisting of six triangular sections; at centre they are translucent and blackish-green, and have a negative bisectrix, and exteriorly clear green and transparent, with a positive bisectrix. Marig nac regards it as between talc and chlorite. He obtained (Ann. Ch.

Greiner, Tyrol, after hornblende. Grengesite from Grangesberg in Dalecarlia, Sweden (anal. 12), occurs partly in hexagonal crystaUi zations, more or less radiately grouped, and probably results, Erdmann observes (Larobok Min., 1853, 374), from the alteration of pyroxene. Erdmann spells the name Grangesite. Specific gravity 3-1; color dark green. Reported also from FischbachthaL as altered augite, iu mela phyre. Named from \\\\uio6s, green. Werner's species chlorite was shown to include more than one species by von KobeU in 1838, aud the name chlorite was thereupon given by him to the St. Gothard and other chlorites having 25 to 27 p. c. sUica, and ripidolite to that of Schwarzenstein and Achmatovsk having 30 to 33 p. c. of sUica. In 1839, G. Rose reversed the names of v. KobeU (see paper on chlorite by Varrentrapp, Pogg.. xlvUi. 198, 1839) on the ground that v. KobeU's ripidolite was not so characteristicaUy fan-shaped in aggregation as the other species. But the change was unfortunate, as both species are now known to differ but little in this respect, and it has resulted in much confusion in the science. Moreover, it violated an older claim of priority ; for Werner's bldttriger Clilorit (or Chlorites lamel losus),the first crystaUized chlorite recognized by him (in 1800 or eariier, Ludwig's Min, L 118, 1803), was the hexagonal chlorite of St. Gothard, and this should therefore, in the division, have retained the name chlorite. As the term chlorite has become the designation of a famUy of minerals, it seems necessary that it should have some modified form for this species, and hence the application of prochlorite, from xoi, before, and chlorite, in aUusion to its being the earliest crystaUized kind recognized. The foUowing are chlorite-like minerals of doubtful nature : 453. A Chlorite-like mineral from Webster, N.

It is remarkable for the smaU amount of water and iron, and the large proportion of magnesia : a constitution which may have an explanation in its being a mixture of talc and chlorite. It is associated with a talc which Genth found to be nearly anhydrous (p. 453). 454 Apbrosider-TE Sandberger (Ueb. Geol. Nassau, 97, 1847).

The seybertite was discovered in 1828 by Messrs. Fitch, Mather, and Horton, and named clin tonite by them on the spot, after De Witt CUnton, as stated by Mather in his Rep. Geol. N. Y., 1 843. But the name was not published at the time by either of the discoverers ; and Finch, the next year, 1829 (1. c.), announced the mineral under the name of bronzite. Clemson's name sey bertite, after H. Seybert (1832, L c.), has therefore priority of publication, and must be accepted as the name of the species. APPENDIX TO HYDROUS SILICATES. 462. WOLCHONSKOITE.

Berthierine fuses with difficulty to a black mag netic globule, and gelatinizes. The latter is mixed with 50 p. c. or more of siderite and calcite ; Berthier found 40\"3 of the former in the material he examined. Chamoisite forms thick beds of rather limited extent in a limestone containing ammonites, at Chamoison, near St. Maurice, in the Valais ; and a simUar substance is reported from Mettenberg in the Bernese Oberland, and Banwald in the Vosges. Berthierine constitutes a valuable bed of iron ore at Hayanges, Dept. of MoseUe, and also occurs in the ores of Champagne, Bourgogne, Lorraine. 470. ALVITE. D . Forbes & T. DahU, Nyt Mag, xiii.

The last has the lowest specific gravity, G.=7\u2014 7-3. The mineral varies in the state of oxydation osthe bases, owing, as Rose has shown, to alteration of the protoxyds to sesquioxyds ; with the increase of the latter the streak loses its black color. It varies' also in O. ratio for bases and acid between 1 : 4 and 1 : 5. The latter corresponds to Tantalic acid 8605, protoxyd of iron 13-95, and the former to 83-1 and 16'9.

Tantalic and columbic acids were formerly supposed to contain either 3 or 2 of oxygen, and a hypotantalic and a hypocolumbic were recognized. The recent results of Marignac, confirmed by those of Blomstrand, have led to the conclusion that there is but one acid, and that this one con- tains 5 of oxygen, as represented in the symbol above used.

With borax slowly dissolved, yielding an iron glass, which, at a certain point of saturation, gives, when treated in R.F. and subsequently flamed, a grayish-white bead ; if completely saturated becomes of itself cloudy on cooling. With salt of phosphorus dis- solves slowly, giving an iron glass, which in R.F, if free from tungstic acid, is pale yeUow on cooling ; treated with tin on charcoal it becomes green. If tungstic acid is present the bead is dark red, and is unchanged in color when treated with tin on charcoal. With soda and nitre gives a green- ish-blue manganese reaction. On charcoal, with soda and sufficient borax to dissolve the oxyd of iron, gives in R.F. metallic tin. Decomposed on fusion with bisulphate of potash in the platinum spoon, and gives on treatment with dUute muriatic acid a yellow solution and a heavy white pow- der, which, on addition of metallic zinc, assumes a smalt-blue color ; on dUution with water the blue color soon disappears (v. KobeU). Obs. \u2014 TantaUte is confined mostly to albite or oUgoclase granite, and is usuaUy associated with beryl. Near Harkasaari, tantalite is associated with rose quartz and gigantoUte, in albitic granite. At Katiala it is associated with lepidolite, black tourmaUne, and colorless beryl. Occurs in Finland, in Tammela, at Harkasaari near Torro, associated with gigantolite and rose quartz ; in Kimito at Skogbole, in Somero at Kaidasuo, and in Kuortane at Katiala, with lepidolite, tourmaUne, and beryl ; in Sweden, in Fahlun, at Broddbo and Finbo ; in France, at Chanteloube near Limoges, in pegmatite. Ixiolite, from Kimito, was instituted on a supposed (not real) differ- ence of crystaUine form. Ildefonsite is from Ildefonso, Spain, and has G. = 7-416, H. = 6\u2014 7. Named Tantalite by Ekeberg, from the mythic Tantalus, in playful aUusion to the difficulties (tantalizing) he encountered in his attempts to make a solution of the Finland mineral in acids. The name was afterward extended to the American mineral columbite, and to the same from other localities ; while the name columbite, the metal colunibinm having been discovered a little prior to tantalum, received a similar extension, so as to include all tantalite. The subsequent discovery that tantalum and columbium were distinct metals, and that the two compounds differed also in the atomic proportions of the constituents, finaUy established them as independent species. 474.

WoUaston's analysis was made on four grains of the original specimen in the British Museum, sent out from Connecticut by Governor Winthrop to Sir Hans Sloane. Pyr., etc. \u2014 Like tantalite. Yon Kobell states that when decomposed by fusion with caustic potash, and treated with muriatic and sulphuric acids, it gives, on the addition of zinc, a blue color much more lasting than with tantalite ; aud the variety dianite, when simUarly treated, gives, on boding with tin-foU, and dUution with its volume of water, a sapphire-blue fluid, whUe, with tantalite and ordinary columbite, the metaUic acid remains undissolved. The variety from Had dam, Ct, is partially decomposed when the powdered mineral is evaporated to dryness with con centrated sulphuric acid, its color is changed to white, Ught gray, or yeUow, and when boUed with muriatic acid and metallic zinc it gives a beautiful blue. The remarkably pure and unaltered columbite from Arksut-fiord in Greenland is also partiaUy decomposed by sulphuric acid, and the product gives the reaction test with zinc, as above. Obs. \u2014 Occurs at Rabenstein, Bavaria, near Zwiesel. not far from Bodenmais, in granite, with iolite and magnetite; at Tirschenreuth, Bavaria; at Tammela, in Finland; at Chanteloube, near Limoges, in pegmatite with tantalite ; near Miask, in the Dmen Mts, with samarskite ; at Her manskar, near Bjorskar, in Finland; in Greenland, in cryolite, at Evigtok, in briUiant crystals; disseminated through or among the wolfram of Auvergne, and detected by acting with aqua-regia, which dissolves the wolfram and leaves untouched the columbite (Phipson, Chem. News, 1867, 160); at Monte Yideo, S. A. In the United States, at Haddam, 2 m. from the vUlage, in a granite vein, some of the crystals several pounds in weight ; also at the chrysoberyl locality, but not now accessible ; also at the iolite locality, Haddam ; near Middletown, iu the \" feldspar \" or \" china-stone quarry,\" with albite, abundant in fine crystals some very large ; figure 429 represents one J in. long ; another, de scribed by Professor Johnston (Am J. Sei, xxx. 387), weighed, before it was broken, 14 pounds; and the part figured about 6 in. in length and breadth, weighed 6 lbs. 12 oz.; it exhibits the faces i-i, i-i, i-2, I, i-i, i-i, and another imperfect plane, which appears to be 1-3. At Chesterfield, Mass, some fine crystals, associated with blue and green tourmalines aud beryl, in a vein of albitic granite; Acworth, N. H.; also Beverly, Mass.; Northfield, Mass, with beryl; Plymouth, N. H., with beryl ; Greenfield, N. Y, with chrysoberyl. The Connecticut crystals are usually rather fragUe from partial change ; whUe those of Green land are very firm and hard. The occurrence of columbite iu America was first made known by Mr. Hatehett's examination of a specimen sent by Governor Winthrop to Sir Hans Sloane, then President of the Royal Society, which was labeUed as found at Neatneague. Dr. S. L. MitchiU stated (Med. Repos, vol. vui) that it was taken at a spring at New London, Conn. No locality has since been detected at that place. But the rediscovery of it at Haddam, first published by Dr. Torrey (Am. J. ScL, iv. 52), and since near Middletown, about 7 m. distant, has led to the beUef that the original locality was at one of these places, which are about 30 m. W. of New London. For recent papers on cryst. see Descl, Ann. d. M, Y. vUL 395 ; Sehrauf, Ber. Ak. Wien, xhv. 445, 1861; Maskelyne, PhU. Mag, IY. xxv. 41. The crystaUographic identity of the American mineral with the Bavarian was first shown by Dr. J. Torrey (Ann. Lye. N. Y, i. 89, 1824). The metal of columbite was named columbium by Hatchett in 1802, from Columbia, a name of America, whence his specimen was received, and thus came the name columbite given by Jameson and Thomson (see further under tantalite). Rose, after investigating the metal and its compounds, named it anew, caUing it niobium, and this gave rise to the name niobite. Baierite is from the German name of Bavaria. Torrelite Thomson, named after Dr. J. Torrey, is the ordinary Middle town columbite; and Greenlandite Breith, is that from Greenland; both names originated partly in erroneous views of the crystals of the minerals. Dianite is the Bodenmais columbite, in which v. KobeU supposed he had discovered the acid of a new metal, which he called dianium. No good reason has been given for substituting niobium for colmnbium; and yet most Enghsh chemists, as weU as European, have thus far foUowed Rose in rejecting the name given by the Enghsh discoverer. The rule of priority demands recognition. 475. TAPIOLITE. TapioUt A. E Nordenskiold, \u0152fv. Ak. Stockh, 443, 1863. Tantalite (ft Sukula) Arppe, Act. Soc.

PHOSPHATES, ARSENATES, ANTIMONATES. In the anhydrous Phosphates and Arsenates the hardness is from 3 to 6 ; colors various, comprising, besides white or colorless, shades of green, yellow, blue, brown, violet, black, several of them bright ; crystalline forms of each of the systems, except the isometric. The hydrous species have a still wider range of crystallization and colors, including the isometric system in the former, and reddish shades among the latter ; while the limits of hardness are lower, being between 1 and 5 ; a much larger pro portion of the species are clinohedral. In composition, the oxygen ratio for bases and acid which is far the most common, is 3 : 5 ; next to this,"], [583, "ANHYDROUS PHOSPHATES AND AK8ENATES. 527 6:5; the ratios 2 : 3, 4 : 5, 3 : 2 are rare ; while 1 : 1 is unknown, except problematically in two or three species of doubtful composition. The pyrognostic reactions for phosphates B.B. are the foUowing: If the acid is combined with a base which of itself imparts no color to the flame, it wiU give a characteristic bluish-green color, and this may be made more intense by moistening with sulphuric acid before ignition. If the phosphate is soluble in nitric acid, the dUute solution wiU give with acetate of lead a white precipitate, which after washing yields B.B. on charcoal in R.F. a crystalline polyhedral bead of phosphate of lead. Further, according to Bunsen, if a phosphate, or a substance containing but a small amount of phosphoric acid, be heated in a wide closed glass tube, with three parts of dry soda and a small fragment of sodium, it is on fusion converted into a phosphid, which after coohng yields phosphuretted hydrogen when moistened with water. Most phosphates in the state of powder are reduced to phosphids by simple fusion with sodium. Arsenates are easUy recognized by the alliaceous odor given when treated on charcoal, especially when fused with soda. I. ANHYDROUS. ARRANGEMENT OF THE SPECIES.

Beudant named the species xenotime (apparently from i,tv6s, stranger to, and nph, honor), but in the next line gives the deriva tion \" ants, vain, et n/i ., honneur,\" as if the word were kenotime, and adds afterward that his name is intended to recall the fact that the mineral was erroneously supposed by Berzelius (in 1815) to contain a new metal (the metal which he named thorium, before the later thorium was discovered). There is a sneer at the great Swedish chemist in the name, which should have occasioned its immediate rejection. Fortunately the word was misspelt from the first ; and in its accepted form may be regarded as referring to the fact that the crystals are small, rare, not showy, and were long unnoticed. 491.

Obs.\u2014 Cryptolite occurs in the green and red apatite of Arendal, Norway, and is discovered on putting the apatite in dilute nitric acid; constitutes 2 or 3 p. c. of the mass ; it was found espe ciaUy in the red apatite, or in reddish points of the green, and associated with particles of mag netic iron, hornblende, and another cerium ore of a hyacinth-red color, supposed to be monazite. This mineral was looked for in the yeUowish apatites of Snarum without success. Occurs also with apatite in the Tyrol (?); and in the apatite of the Sliidianka in Siberia. Phosphocerite, according to Watts and Chapman, may be the grayish-yeUow powder in the cobalt ore of Tunaberg. The crystaUine forms most common in the powder are an octahedron aud a square or rectangular prism terminatino- in a four-sided pyramid parallel with the lateral planes, resembling fig. 248, under zircon.

The earliest examination of apatite was that of Proust, in 1788 (1. a), on the phosphorite of Estremadura, which led him to call it a calcareous phosphate ; and that of Klaproth, in the same year (1. a), on the Saxon apatite, in which he found P 45, Ca 55. Pelletier in 1790 (1. c.) made a complete, although not entirely accurate, analysis of the phosphorite, detecting even the fluo rine and chlorine, obtaining P 34, Ca 59, fluoric acid 2*5, muriatic acid 0'5, Pe 1, Si 2, C 1= 100. The asparagus stone of Spain was not analyzed until 1798, by Vauquelin (L c): he found only phosphoric acid and lime, respectively 4572 and 54'28 p. c. His results proved its iden tity with the Saxon mineral, and from this tune they were united, along with phosphorite, under Werner's name of apatite, first given in 1 786 to the Saxon mineral. Forbes found in the eupyrchroite (Phil. Mag, IY. xxix. 340) P 44-12. Phosphorite of different locaUties has afforded a trace of iodine, and that from Amberg gave H. Reinsch in addition a trace of bromine. Apatite from Krageroe, according to Voleker (anal. 11), contains uo fluorine. That of Jumilla afforded de Luna T75 p. c. of cerium, lanthanum, and didymium. Near Coquimbo, ChUi, at the mines of TambUlos, occur clear turquois-blue crystals, containing, according to F. Field (Chem. Gaz, No. 400, 1860, p. 224), P 37-69, 6a 36-64, 6u 20-93 CaCl 2-33, fl 2-32=99-91, the copper being present as phosphate. Lechartier has shown (C. R, lxv. 172) that an arsenic acid apatite may be made by fusion together of arsenate of lime and chlorid of calcium ; aud that from the same at a lower tempera ture an arsenic acid wagnerite is obtained in crystals. Pyr., etc. \u2014 B.B. in the forceps fuses with difficulty on the edges (F.=4'5\u2014 5), coloring the flame reddish-yeUow ; moistened with sulphuric acid and heated colors the flame pale bluish-green (phosphoric acid); some varieties react for chlorine with salt of phosphorus, when the bead has been previously saturated with oxyd of copper, whUe others give fluorine when fused with this salt in an open glass tube.

Dissolves in muriatic and nitric acid, yielding with sulphuric acid a copious precipitate of sulphate of Ume ; the dilute nitric acid solution gives with acetate of lead a white precipitate, which B.B. on charcoal fuses, giviug a globule with crystaUine facets on cooUng. Some varieties of apatite phosphoresce on heating. Obs. \u2014 Apatite occurs in rocks of various kinds and ages, but is most common in metamorphic crystaUine rocks, especially in granular limestone, granitic and many metaUiferous veins, particu larly those of tin, in gneiss, syenite, hornblendic gneiss, mica schist, beds of iron ore ; occasion aUy in serpentine, and in igneous or volcanic rocks ; sometimes in ordinary stratified limestone, beds of sandstone or shale of the SUurian, Carboniferous. Jurassic, Cretaceous, or Tertiary forma tions. It has been observed as tbe petrifying material of wood. Among its localities are Ehrenfriedersdorf in Saxony, Schwarzenstein and Pfitsch in the Tyrol ; region of St. Gothard in Switzerland ; Mussa- Alp in Piedmont, white or colorless, and of Uka form and color on the Mittaghorn in Upper Valais ; Rabenstein and Amberg in Bavaria \u2022 Zinn"], [589, "ANHYDROUS PHOSPHATES AND AESENATES. 533 waid and Schlackenwald in Bohemia ; in England, in CornwaU, with tin ores ; in Cumberland at Carrock FeUs, in celandine-green crystals in gUbertite ; in Devonshire, cream-colored at Bovey Tracey, and at Wheal Franco (francolite) ; in Ireland, in a basaltic dike near Kilroot in Antrim, also in Down, Dublin, and Killiney HU1.

Guano is bone-phosphate of lime, or osteolite, mixed with the hydrous phos phate, brushite, and generaUy with some carbonate of lime, and often a little magnesia, alumina iron, sUica, gypsum, and other impurities. It often contains 9 or 10 p. c. of water. It is often granular or oolitic ; also compact through consoUdation produced by infiltrating waters, in which case it is frequently lameUar in structure, and also occasionaUy stalagmitic and stalactitic. Its colors are usuaUy grayish-white, yeUowish and dark brown, and sometimes reddish, and the lustre of a surface of fracture earthy to resinous. Shepard's Pyroclasite (Am. J. Sci., II. xxii. 97) is nothing but the hard guano from Monk's Island, Caribbean sea, the mass of which he named Pyro guaniie, under the wrong idea of its having undergone the action of heat ; and Phipson's Sombre rite (J. Ch. Soc, xv. 277, 1862) is the same thing from Sombrero, as shown by A. A. Julien (Am. J. ScL, II. xxxvi. 423). The waters which have filtrated through the guano at Sombrero have altered the coral rock adjoining, turning it more or less completely into phosphate of Ume of a yeUowish or brownish color; and phosphatic stalagmites and stalactites resinous in fracture are common. Shepard's massive Glaubapatite, yeUowish-brown to chocolate-brown in color, and in fibrous sta lactites, from Monk's Island (L a), is also in aU probabUity merely the guano rock above described. He says the mineral contains 15-1 p. c. of sulphate of soda, with 74-0 of phosphate of Ume, and 10*3 of water; but such a compound is hardly a possibility, and the fact of its existence needs confirmation. The name, from glauber and apatite, aUudes to the composition. The mineral includes also \"tabular crystals,\" which may possibly be brushite, although the composition is against it. 490E.

Alt. \u2014 TriphyUte and tripUte, like other minerals containing protoxyd of manganese, undergo easy alteration by oxydation and hydration ; and the former also by losing its alkalies. The ses quioxyd of iron in Wittstein's analysis (anal. 5) is thus accounted for. The foUowing have come from the alteration of one or the other of these minerals. A. Heterosite.

It is useless to write formulas for these compounds until the state of oxydation of the iron and manganese has been more precisely ascer tained; and even then they are of Uttle value, as the mineral in the altered state is probably a mere mixture. Melanchlor Fuchs (J. pr. Ch, xvii. 171) is altered triphylite according to S\u00e6mann (this Min, 4th ed, 513) It is a phosphate of iron from Rabenstein, containing, in 100 parts, 38-9 sesquioxyd and 3*87 protoxyd of iron, besides protoxyd of manganese, and 9 to 10 p. c. of water ; it occurs on triphyUte.

There occur also hemispherical steUated groups of white crystals, as altered ornithite, which Mr. JuUen has not analyzed, but supposed to be the same compound minus the water. One crystal of the so-caUed ornithite examined by the author had on its edges and surface microscopic tufts of acicular crystals. Epiglaubite and crystallized Glaubapatile of Shepard (Am. J. Sci., H. xxU. 96, 1856). One or the other of these may be metabrushite or brushite. Glaubapatite has already been remarked upon on page 535. It may be added that there is further proof that no such guano compound exists (combination of sulphate of soda and phosphate of lune) in that A. A. JuUen has found no evidence of it in his investigations. His results suggest that Shepard's soda may have come from common salt present, and his sulphuric acid from sulphate of Ume. Epiglaubite is described as occurring in \" smaU aggregates or interlaced masses of minute semi transparent crystals of a shining vitreous lustre, which are always implanted on druses of glaub apatite, with H.=about 2-5,\" and as being \" a largely hydrate phosphate, chiefly of lune, andmay also contain magnesia and soda.\" It is not impossible that the mineral is metabrushite, although some characters are inconsistent with such a conclusion. If so, the name epiglaubite (meaning occurring implanted on glaubapatite) is inappUcable, and should be rejected. 520. PHARMACOLITE.

Ac- cording to Agaphi, the only naturalist who has visited the locaUty, turquois occurs only in veins, which traverse the mountain in all directions. Fischer, in 1816, named the different varieties Calaite, Agaphite (or conchoidal T.), and Johnite (or quartzy T.). Pieces of the size of a hazel- nut are considered very large. An impure variety is found in SUesia, and at Oelsnitz in Saxony ; near the weU of Nasaiph between Suez and Sinai. W. P. Blake refers here a hard, yellowish- to bluish-green stone (which he identifies with the chalcliihuitl of the Mexicans) from the mountains Los CerUlas, 20 m. S.E. of Santa Fe; H.=6; G.=2-426-2-651 (Am. J. Sei, II. xxv. 227). A pale green turquois occurs in the Columbus district, Nevada. Turquois receives a good polish, and is highly esteemed as a gem. The Persian king is said to retain for his own use all the larger and finely tinted specimens. The Cdllais of Pliny is generally regarded as turquois, and probably rightly so. But aU he says of it is, \"CaUais sapphirum imitatur, candidior et litoroso mari simUis,\" resembling sapphire (that is, lapis-lazuli) in color, but paler, and like the sea toward the shore ; indicating a greenish-blue tint and degree of opacity corresponding weU enough with much turquois. The Callaina also of Pliny (to which he devotes a long chapter) is referred to this species, and with even better reason. It was a stone of a pale green color, and was obtained, according to him, amid inaccessible rocks in the countries that lie at the back of India, near Mt. Caucasus, etc. He also states that it was remarkable for its size, and was full of holes and foreign substances, which it is difficult to reconcile with the true turquois. But he speaks in the next sentence of a kind from Carmania (a district of Persia) as of better quahty and clearer, and this may have been real turquois. He says that no stones were more easily imitated, which is very true of turquois. He also remarks that the beauty of the CaUaina is greatly heightened by a setting of gold, the contrast peculiarly befitting it. Pliny also speaks of another stone caUed Callaica (xxxvu. 56), and says of it : \" Callaieam vocant e turbido caUaiuo; ferunt pluris conjunctis semper inveniri ; \" it is so caUed because it is a turbid caUaina, and they are found together. He also remarks that the stone called \"Augetis (xxxvii. 541 multis non aUa videtur quam caUaina,\" by many is thought to be nothing but caUaina. (See further Call_j_*__e, p. 572). The Persian smaragdus, or emerald, aUuded to by PUny (xxxvii. 18, citing from Demoeritus), as \" without transparency, agreeable and uniform in color, satisfying the vision without aUowing it to penetrate it,\" may have been turquois ; yet, as with most of Pliny's descriptions (owing to his mixing different things of similar aspect), when all the other characters given are weighed they leave doubt. It is probable that the turquois \u2014 oriental and occidental \u2014 was as commonly used in Persia as a gem in ancient times as now. The name turquois is French in form, and means Turkish, a Turkish gem, the gem having come into Europe through Turkey. Most of the turquois (uot artificial) used in jewelry in former centuries, as weU as the present, and that described in the early works on minerals, was bone-turquois (caUed also odontolite, from <S--u., tooth), which is fossU-bone, or tooth, colored by a phosphate of iron. Its organic origin becomes manifest under a microscope. Moreover, true turquois, when decomposed by muriatic acid, gives a fine blue color with ammonia, which is not true of the odontoUte."], [638, "582 OXYGEN COMPOUNDS. 564. PEGANITE.

A variety from Providence in CornwaU is in 8-sided tables with a low pyra mid, and has a leek-green color, with G.=3'329\u2014 3372 (Breith., B. H. Ztg, xxiv. 303).

Russl, v. 35) 108\u00b0 56'; the meau of his measurements of Cornwall and Schlackenwald crystals being 108\u00b0 53' 23\" and 71\u00b0 5' 21\". SimUar figures are given by Greg & Lettsom, Min, 384. The angles of B. & M. do not agree with any of the meas urements. First named torberite (torbernite) by Werner, after the chemist Torber Bergmann [Lat Torbernus, as written by Bergmann himself]. Then, this naming after persons having been denounced as an innovation (see Karsten's Werner's Verbess, 43, 1793), Werner substituted Chalcolite (fr. \\aUis, copper, signifying, as he says, \" ein Kupfer haltender Stein \") in allusion to Bergmann's deter mination in 1 7 SO that the mineral was muriate of copper. When, finally, it was shown by Klap roth to be an ore of uranium instead of copper, Werner, with Karsten and others, threw aside chalcolite, because false in signification, and used Uranglimmer (uran-mica). ChalcoUte has since crept back again, but is no more appropriate now than it was sixty years ago. The name tor berite was written as it should be, torbernite, by some mineralogists of last century. Both this species and the autunite have gone under the common name of uranite ; the former also as Copper-uranite, the latter Lime-uranite. 573. AUTUNITE.

Obs. \u2014 Autunite is found usually with other ores of uranium, associated with sUver, tin, and iron ores. Occurs in the Siebengebirge, in the hornstone of a trachytic range ; at Johanngeorgen stadt and Eibenstock ; at Lake Onega, Wolf Island, Russia ; near Limoges, and at St. Symphorien near Autun ; formerly at South Basset, Wheal Edwards, and near St. Day, England. Occurs sparingly at the Middletown (Ct.) feldspar quarry, associated with columbite and albite, in minute tabular crystals and thin scales, of light green and lemon-yellow colors ; also in minute crystals at Chesterfield, Mass, on the quartz or albite, and sometimes in the red centres of tour malines, and at Acworth, N. H, straw-yeUow and light green ; also in a gneiss quarry on the SchuylkiU, near PhUadelphia, about \\ m. above the suspension bridge. Descloizeaux makes autuuite to differ from torbernite (Ann. d. M, V. xiv. 1857) in being opticaUy biaxial, and therefore orthorhombic ; and the planes 2 of the latter thus become 2-i and 2-i, as they incline unequaUy to the base. The angles are stUl very closely the same, the pyramidal 95\u00b0 52', being in torbernite 96\u00b0 6', Kokscharof; 95\u00b0 52', Hessenberg; 95\u00b0 46', Aaidinger. The species are at least closely isomorphous. Berzelius caUs the uranite of CornwaU and that of Autun, respectively, chalcolite and uranite, in his article announcing the composition, in Jahresb, iv. 146, 147, 1823 ; and the special appUeation of uranite to this species dates from that time. Yet, in order to avoid confusion from the double use of the name, it is better to adopt for the species the name of autunite, from one of its noted loeaUties. Fritzsoheite Breith., B. H. Ztg, xxiv. 302, 1865. A mineral much resembUng uranite in its four-sided quadratic (or nearly so) tables, with a perfect basal cleavage ; with H.=2\u2014 25 ; G.= 3*504?; vitreous to pearly in lustre ; reddish-brown to hyacinth-red in color and streak ; trans lucent ; affording Fritzsche (1. c.) reactions for oxyd of uranium, protoxyd of manganese, vanadic acid, phosphoric acid, and water. The red color is attributed to the manganese, and it is consid ered a mangan-uranite containing some vanadic acid. It occurs with crystals of autunite and torbernite at Neuhammer, near Neudeck in Bohemia, in a hematite mine ; at Johanngeorgen stadt, of fine red color, with torbernite. Red crystals in groups, supposed to be this mineral, have been observed on specimens of uranite from Autun, and from Steinig, near Elsterberg, in Saxon Voigtland. May it be au altered uranite ? 574.

Obs Found generally La minute needle-form crystals, and crusts on the surface of the earth, on waUs, rocks, etc. It forms abundantly in certain soils in Spain, Egypt, and Persia, especiaUy during hot weather succeeding rains. Also manufactured from soUs where other nitrates (nitrate of lime or soda) form in a simUar manner, and beds called nitriaries are arranged for this purpose in France, Germany, Sweden, Hungary, and other countries. Refuse animal matter, also, putrified in calcareous soUs, gives rise to the nitrate of Ume. Old plaster, lixiviated, affords about 5 p. c. of nitre. In India it is obtained in large quantities for the arts. Nitre requires for its formation dry air and long periods without rain ; the potash comes mainly from the debris of feldspathic rocks in the soU. The oxydation of the nitrogen of the air is pro moted by organic matters; hence the nitre is generally associated with azotized decomposed organic substances.

In Madison Co., Kentucky, it is found scattered through the loose earth covering the bottom of a large cave. Also in other caverns in the Mississippi vaUey. Those of Tennessee, along the limestone slopes and in the gorges of the Cumberland table-land, afford it abundantly. Nitre, according to Frankenheim, is dimorphous, Uke carbonate of lime ; one form prismatic (aragonite-like), the other rhombohedral (ealcite-like). The prismatic is the normal one between -10\u00b0 C. and 300\u00b0 C. ; and between these temperatures the rhombohedral is easily transformed into the prismatic through the presence of some foreign substance. Above 300\u00b0 the rhombo hedral is the normal one, the prismatic here changing to it, and retaking again its form on a diminution of temperature (Pogg, xciL 354). 591. SODA NITRE.

Obs. \u2014 This long known compound, the Sal sedativum Hombergii, was first detected in nature by Hoefer in the waters of the Tuscan lagoons of Monte Rotondo and Castelnuovo, and afterward in the solid state at Sasso by Mascagni. The hot vapors of the lagoons consist largely of boric acid. To collect it the vapors are made to pass through water, which absorbs the boric acid; the waters are then evaporated by means of the steam from the springs. They yield seven to eight thousand pounds troy per day. These lagoons spread over a surface of about 30 mUes ; and in the distance, clouds of vapor are seen rising in large volumes among the mountains. The crude borax contains 20 p. c. or more of impurities, among which Wittstein and Payen found 13*7 p. c of siUphates (the most abundant, sulph. ammonia 8*5 p. c, sulph. magnesia 2*6 p. c). Exists also in other natural waters, as at Wiesbaden ; Aachen ; KrankenheU near Fobs ; Clear Lake, in Lake Co., California ; and it has been detected in the waters of the ocean. Occurs also abundantly in the crater of Vulcano, one of the Lipari isles, forming a layer on Bulphur, and about the fumaroles, where it was discovered by Dr. Holland in 1813.

An iron-boracite (Eisenstassfurtit) from Stassfurt is described by Huyssen (Jahrb. Min. 1865, 329), having half the Mg replaced by Fe.

B.B. both varieties fuse at 2 with intumescence to a white crystaUine pearl, coloring the flame green ; heated after moisten ing with cobalt solution assumes a deep pink color. Mixed with oxyd of copper and heated on charcoal colors the flame deep azure-blue (chlorid of copper). Soluble in muriatic acid. Soluble in powder in dilute muriatic, nitric, or sulphuric acids, and the massive kind most readUy so. Alters very slowly on exposure, owing to the chlorid of magnesium present, which takes up water. It is the frequent presence of this deliquescent chlorid in the massive mineral, thus originat ing, that led to the view that there was a hydrous boracite (stassfurtite). See on this point Bischof's Steinsalzwerke bei Stassfurt, p. 36, and Steinbeck in Pogg, exxv. 68. Parasite of Volger is a result of the same kind of alteration in the interior of crystals of boracite, which gives the somewhat plumose character it has, and the water.

The borax is dug in masses from the edges and shallow parts of the lake, and in the course of a short time the holes thus made are again filled. This crude borax was formerly sent to Europe under the name of tincal, and there purified. It is announced by Dr. J. A. Veatch as existing in the waters of the sea along the California coast, and in those of many of the mineral springs of CaUfornia (J. Frankl. Inst, 1860). Crystals, 2 or 3 inches across, occur in the mud of Borax Lake, near Clear Lake, Cal, 65 m. N.W. of Suisun Bay and 36 m. from the Pacific. It has also been found at Viquintizoa and Escapa in Peru ; at Halberstadt in Transylvania ; in Ceylon. It occurs in solution in the mineral springs of Chambly, St. Ours, etc, Canada East (Hunt, Logan's G. Rep, 1853). The waters of Borax Lake, California, contain, according to G. E. Moore, 535-08 grains of crys taUized borax to the gaUon (Am. J. Sci., xU. 257). Borax is now extensively made from the boric acid of the Tuscan lagoons, by the reaction of this acid on carbonate of soda. This salt is employed in several metaUurgical operations as a flux, is sometimes used in the manufacture of glass and gems, and extensively in the process of soldering. Named borax from the Arabic buraq, which included also the nitre (carbonate of soda) of ancient writers, the natron of the Egyptians. Prof. Bechi has analyzed a borate occurring as an incrustation at the Tuscan lagoons, which afforded B 43-56, Na 19-25, A 37-19=100, giving the formula Na B3+6 A (Am. J. Sci., H. xvii. 128). 600.

Forbes (PhiL Mag, IV. xxv. 113), from the waters of the hot springs, Baiios del Toro, in the Cordilleras of Coquimbo, may be of the above species. It occurs in the waters in the form of snow-white silky or feathery* flakes, and also as a flaky sediment at the bottom. Forbes suggests that the mineral is formed by the action of hot vapors, volcanic in source, on the lune of the waters through which they pass. 601. HOWLITE. SUicoborocalcite H. How, PhU.

The former analysis cor responds nearly to the ratio 5 : 4 for the two tungstates ; and the latter to 3 : 4 nearly. Hoppe-Seyler (Ann. Ch. Pharm, cxi. 247) found indium in two specimens of wolfram ; one contained 0-228 p. c. The metal tungsten was first recognized in this mineral by the brothers J. Joseph and F. d'Elhuyar, in 1785 (Ch. Anal, of Wolfram, etc., translated from the Spanish by Ch. CuUen, London, 1755, a work of which a German translation by Gren was published at HaUe in 1786). They obtained from the Zinnwald mineral Tungstic acid 65'0, oxyd of manganese 22-0, of iron 13-5= 100-5. Pyr, etc. \u2014 B.B. fuses easily (F.=2-5 \u2014 3) to a globule, which has a crystaUine surface and is magnetic. With salt of phosphorus gives a clear reddish-yellow glass whUe hot, which is paler on cooUng ; in R.F. becomes dark red ; on charcoal with tin, if not too saturated, the bead assumes on cooling a green color, which continued treatment in R.F. changes to reddish-yeUow. With soda and nitre on platinum foU fuses to a bluish-green manganate. Decomposed by aqua regia with separation of tungstic acid as a yellow powder, which, when treated B.B, reacts as under tungstite (p. 186). Wolfram is sufficiently decomposed by concentrated sulphuric acid, or even muriatic acid, to give a colorless solution, which, treated with metaUic zinc, becomes intensely blue, but soon bleaches on dilution. Obs. \u2014 Wolfram is often associated with tin ores ; also in quartz, with native bismuth, tungstate of lime, pyrite, galenite, blende, etc. It occurs at CornwaU, much to the detriment of the tin ores. Foimd in fine crystals at Schlackenwald, Schneeberg, Geyer, Ereiberg, Altenberg, Ehrenfriedersdorf, Zinnwald, and Nertschinsk, and other places mentioned above ; at Chanteloup, near Limoges, in France ; near Redruth and elsewhere in Cornwall ; in Cumberland (the ratio 2 : 3 at LochfeUs, that of 4 : 1 at Godolphin's BaU) ; on the Island of Rona, one of the Hebrides ; in the auriferous sand of the Wicklow rivers, Ireland, with tin. Also in S. America, at Oruro in BoUvia. The crystals of Zinnwald are remarkable as hemitropes. In the U. States it occurs at Lane's mine, Monroe, Conn, in quartz, associated with native bis muth and the other minerals above mentioned, often pseudomorphous after tungstate of lime ; iu smaU quantities at TrumbuU, Conn, at the topaz vein ; massive and in crystals on Camdage farm, near Blue HiU Bay, Me. ; at the Flowe mine, Mecklenburg Co, N. C, with scheelite, crystals with planes I, i-i, -j-i, l-l ; in Missouri, near Mine la Motte, and in St. Francis Co., 1 _ m. from St. Francis River ; in a gneiss boulder on the W. shore of Chief Island, L. Couchiching, Canada West ; at Mammoth mining district, Nevada. This species is shown to be isomorphous with columbite by G. Rose (Pogg, lxiv. 171). Des cloizeaux found in the angles of wolfram some evidence that the crystals were monocUnic. But G. Rose shows from the twins that the form is orthorhombic and not obUque.

Zippe's vanadite (L c.) is referred to descloizite by A. Sehrauf (Pogg, cxvL 355, 1862). The mineral occurs at Kappel in Carinthia, in small clove-brown rhombic octahedrons, with G.=5-83. Tschermak obtained in his analysis (Ber. Ak. Wien, xliv. ii. 1 58) V 45-7, Pb 54-3= 100 (with no zinc, although looked for), and referred the species to dechenite.

Sehrauf suggests that both descloizite and vanadite are dechenite; and Tschermak (Pogg, cxviL 349) that vanadite and dechenite are one species, and descloizite an altered vanadite. Named after the French mineralogist Descloizeaux. 620A. Vanadate as Lead, from PhenixviUe, Pa. A thin crystalline crust of a dark purple, almost black color, but dark hyacinth-red by transmitted Ught, and of a dark yeUow streak, occurs covering quartz, ferruginous clay, and wulfenite, at PhenixvUle. With a magnifying glass it appears to consist of minute lenticular crystals. It could not be whoUy separated from the associated wulfenite and other impurities for analysis, and the result obtained is therefore not whoUy satisfactory. J. L. Smith found (Am. J. Sci., II. xx. 247, 1855): V 11-70, Mo 20-14, Pb 55-01, \u00a3_n, _tl 5-90, Cu 1-13, sand 2*21, aq 2'94=99-03. Subtracting the lead required by the molyb dic acid to make wulfenite, it leaves 22-82 p. c. for the 1T70 of vanadic acid; which is nearer the composition of descloizite than that of dechenite. 621.

Obs. \u2014 This mineral was first discovered at Zimapan in Mexico, by Del Rio. It has since been obtained among some of the old workings at Wanlockhead in Dumfriesshire, where it occurs in small globular masses, sprinkled over calamine, or forming thin coatings on the surface of that mineral, and also in hexagonal crystals, the largest not more than i in. across ; also at Beresof in the Ural, with pyromorphite ; and near Windisch Kappel in Carinthia, in crystals, the angles as above given. This mineral has never been found at Wicklow, Ireland, although so reported by Thomson (Greg and Lettsom). Schabus gives for the forms from Windisch Kappel I, 1 ; I, 1, |; I, 1, 2-2 ; O, I, 1, f ; O, I, 1, 1-2. The basal angle of pyramid 1 in different crystals was 78\u00b0 46'\u2014 78\u00b0 54'. The angles are very near those of mimetite and pyromorphite, the basal angle in the former being 79\u00b0 24' \u2014 80\u00b0 43'; and in pyromorphite of Bleistadt, 80\u00b0 40' (Pogg, c. 297). Kokscharof regards the crystals from Beresof as pseudomorphs after pyromorphite ; and Struve observes that the crystals contain at centre a portion of unaltered pyromorphite (Min. Russl, iu. 44). Del Rio discovered this species at Zimapan, and obtained from it, in 1801, 80-72 of oxyd of lead, and 14-8 of a new metaUic acid, the basis of which he called Erythronium. This result was set aside by himself in the Ann. des Sci. Nat. de Madrid, Feb. 1804 (Ann. d. M, iv. 1819), and also by Descotils in the Ann. Ch, Uu. 1805, both of whom made the acid the chromic, and the mineral a brown chromate of lead. The metal vanadium was not discovered by Sefstrom untU 1830, and then in iron made of ore from Taberg, Sweden ; and in the same year Wohler showed that Del Rio's lead ore was a vanadate. 622.

An ore similar in color and clayey appearance to Domeyko's mineral, has been announced by J. E. Teschemacher among specimens from the Cliff Mine, in the Lake Superior Copper Region. The presence of vanadium was ascer tained by both blowpipe and acid tests. The color is a dark chocolate, and also a bright yeUow. The exact state of composition of the vanadic acid is doubtful. There is no oxyd of lead in the ore, and the brown variety is mixed with an earthy oxyd of iron ; when carefully separated from the gangue it was found to contain no copper. This Min, 531, 1850. 6. SULPHATES, CHKOMATES, TELLTJKATES. In crystalline form, specific gravity, and color, the Sulphates vary almost indefinitely. The hardness is not above 4. The Chromates have bright, deep red, and green to brown colors, with the hardness 2-5 \u2014 3-5. ISTo native hydrous chromates are known. The compounds of sulphates and carbonates, or sulphato-carbonates, have the crystallization ot the sulphates, the carbonic acid being wholly subordinated, as regards the form produced, to the sulphuric, tlie more powerful acid. Thus leadhiUite is hom\u0153omorphous with anglesite, celes tine, etc., susannite with dreelite, and lanarhite with glauberite ; and these species are accordingly here included.

On charcoal the sulphates of the alkalies and alkaline earths are in R.F. reduced to sulphids, which, moistened with dUute muriatic acid, evolve sulphuretted hydrogen ; the other sulphates thus treated give off sulphurous acid, and leave earths or metaUic oxyds, or metals or metaUic sulphids, and sometimes, where the metal is volatUe, coat the .coal with oxyd. All non-volatUe sulphates when fused with soda or neutral oxalate of potash on charcoal yield a hepatic mass, which is more or less absorbed by the coal ; when this is removed, and placed on a bright clean surface of sUver with a drop or two of water, it stains the metal yel lowish-brown to black from the formation of sulphid of sUver ; treated with muriatic acid the fused mass evolves sulphuretted hydrogen. In soluble minerals the sulphuric acid may be readily detected on adding to the solution a few drops of soluble baryta salt, which produces a white precipitate, insoluble in acids and in ammonia. I.

Werner's stangenspath was from Freiberg, (d) In globular or nodular concretions, subfibrous or columnar within. Bologna Stone is here included, being radiated, globular, often reddish-gray in color. It is from a bed of clay in Mt. Paterno, near Bologna, and was early a source of wonder because of the phosphorescence it exhibited after heating with charcoal. \"Bologna phosphorus \" was made from it in the form of sticks, by powdering the mineral and uniting it again with gum.

Calcareobarite Thomson (Min., i. 105) is a white barite from Strontian in Argyleshire, con- taining, probably as mixture, 6'6 p. c. of lime, and some sUica and alumina. He found S 35'23, Ba 48-95, Sr 0-79, Ca 6-60, Fe 0-45, Si 4'14, Si 3-46, moisture 0-57 = 100-19 ; G.=4-1907. Apart of the krumschaliger Schwerspath of Werner \u2014 specimens from Freiberg \u2014 is referred here by Breithaupt, who gives for 7A 7101\u00b0 53', and G.=4*02\u2014 4*29. 5. Celeslobarite ; the spar containing much sulphate of strontian, as that of Binnen vaUey, Switzerland (anaL 2), to which von Waltershausen applied the name baryto-celestine, and also that of anal. 3, 4. The angles of the Binnen spar, according to Hugard, are intermediate between those of barite and eelestite. 6. Calslronbarite, from Schoharie, N. Y, has the aspect of a mere mixture. Shepard made it a compound (1. c.) of carbonates of strontia (22-30) and Ume (12-15), with 6555 p. c. of sulphate of baryta, and says it is partly soluble in muriatic-acid with effervescence. Von Hauer found a specimen from Schoharie labeUed calslronbarite to consist of sulphates alone. Cawk is the ordinary barite of the Derbyshire lead mines. Withering, who first analyzed it (PhiL Trans, lxxiv. 293, 1784), describes it as occurring in roundish forms, consisting of rhom boidal laminae confusedly aggregated and white or reddish in color, with G. = 4*330 ; and a second"], [674, "618 OXYGEN COMPOUNDS. variety as radiated fibrous, somewhat silky in lustre, and at times concentric in structure, yeUow ish-white, and opaque, with G.=4*00. Greg & Lettsom (1858) confine the term to an opaque earthy variety of the Derbyshire lead mines. The barite of Muszar, Hungary, and of Better, near Rosenau, was early caUed Wolnyn. It is common barite, in crystals, usually oblong in the direction of the vertical axis, and generaUy with i-i and 0 large, and also i-2 large. A. Sehrauf mentions the foUowing as other occurring planes : 0, 4-i, 1-i, i-l, H, 8-i, 2-i, 1-i, 1, 2, 1-2, 2-2, 3-3, i-Z (Ber. Ak. Wien, xxxix. 286).

Should the barite contain sulphate of Ume, this will not be absorbed by the coal when treated in powder with soda. Insoluble in acids. Obs. \u2014 Occurs commonly in connection with beds or veins of metaUic ores, as part of the gangue of the ore. It is met with in secondary limestones, sometimes forming distinct veins, and ofteD in crystals along with calcite and celestite. At Dufton, in Westmoreland, England, large transparent crystals occur, sometimes of gigantic dimensions ; some were found lying m the mud at the bottom of a cavern, and one weighed 100 lbs. Other English localities exist in CornwaU, near Liskeard, etc., in Cumberland and Lanca shire, in Derbyshire, Staffordshire, etc. ; fine stalactitic at Newhaven in Derbyshire ; in Scotland, in Argyleshire, at Strontian ; in Perthshire, of a bright yeUow color at Ballindean ; at the Cumber land lead mine ; in Ireland, in thick veins in old red sandstone, at BaUynas. reen in Londonderry. The septaria of Durham, England, which are cut and pohshed for tables, etc, have the veinings fined with brown heavy spar, adding much to their beauty.

It was first discovered at the salt mine near HaU in Tyrol, by Abbe Poda ; and next that of Bex, Switzerland. Other localities are at Aussee, both crystaUized and massive, the former sometimes in splendid geodes (f. 511), the latter brick-red; at Sulz on the Neckar, in Wiirtemberg; Himmelsberg, near Bfeld; Bleiberg in Carinthia ; Luneburg, Hanover ; Lauterberg in the Harz ; Kapnik in Hungary ; Ischl in Hpper Austria; Aussee in Styria; Berchtesgaden in Bavaria ; at Rienthal and elsewhere in the Alps, crystals, or their cavities, within quartz crystals ; Stassfurt, in fine crystals. In the U. States, at Lockport, N. Y, fine blue, in geodes of black limestone, accompanied with crystals of calcite and gypsum. In Nova Scotia it forms extensive beds at the estuary of the Avon and the St. Croix rivers, also near the Five Islands and elsewhere, associated with gypsum, in the Carboniferous formation. A crystal from HaU, figured by Haiiy, was a stout rectangular prism, with planes I on the lateral edges, giving i-i A 7=140\u00b0 4', whence I A 7=100\u00b0 8'. The Stassfurt crystals (f. 510, Blum, Jahrb. Min. 1865, 601) have nearly the ordinary forms of barite, and approximate to them mangles. Sehrauf makes the angle over i-i of an occurring vertical prism (Pogg, cxvii. 650, 1862) 120\u00b0, and v. Rath (Ber. nied. Ges. Bonn, 201, 1862) 121\u00b0 24'. Blum states that the prism I is the most common; it is vertieaUy striated, and these striations are formed of planes of the other vertical prisms measured by him ; measurements only approximations. Sehrauf and Blum make the angle 1-i A l-i=85\u00b0; Fuchs (B. H. Ztg, xxi. 198), 84V; and v. Rath, 84\u00b0 34'. In fig. 511 the plane o is in the same vertical zone with . ; and if . is made the plane 1 (as done by Brooke and MiUer), n is 2-2, and/ 3-3. B. and M. obtained in their measurements for i-i on/, n, o, 153\u00b0 14', 143\u00b0 41', and 123\u00b0 31' (PhU. Mag, III. 19, 178) ; and GraUich and Lang, for the same (Ber. Ak. Wien, xxviL 26), 153\u00b0 60', 143\u00b0 37', 124\u00b0 10'. The latter give for their calculated results, 163\u00b0 18V, I*2\" 69V, 123\u00b0 82V- The prism i-I, which has the angle 102\u00b0 34', may be that homo logous with /of barite; in this case the brachydiagonal above would be the macrodiagonal. Alt. \u2014 Absorbs moisture and changes to gypsum. Extensive beds are sometimes thus altered in part or throughout, as at Bex, in Switzerland, where, by digging down 60 to 100 ft, the unaltered anhydrite may be found. Sometimes specimens of anhydrite are altered between the folia or over the exterior. Also altered to quartz and siderite. 633. ANGLESITE. Vitriol de Plomb Monnel, Syst. Min, 371, 1779.

Obs. \u2014 This ore of lead was first observed by Monnet as a result of the decomposition of gale nite, and it is often sound in its cavities. At LeadhUls it occurred, occupying the cubical cavities of galenite, or disposed on the surface of the ore; and this locahty, and also that of Wanlock head, formerly afforded large and beautiful crystals, some transparent and several inches in diameter. First found in England at Parys mine in Anglesea. Occurs also at Melanoweth in Cornwall ; in Derbyshire and in Cumberland in crystals ; ClausthaL ZeUerfeld, and Giepenbach, in the Harz ; near Siegen in Prussia ; Schapbach in the Black Forest, BadenweUer in Breisgau ; and in Sardinia in smaU but perfect transparent crystals ; Fondon in Granada ; massive in Siberia, Andalusia, Alston Moor in Cumberland ; in Australia, whence it is exported by the ton to England. In the United States it occurs in large crystals at Wheatley's mine, PhenixviUe, Pa. (f. 512, 513, 514); less weU crystaUized in Missouri lead mines ; at the lead mine of Southampton, Mass. ; at Rossie, N. Y. ; with galenite at the Walton gold mine, Louisia Co, Va. Named from the locaUty, Anglesea, where it was first found by Dr. Withering. For recent papers on cryst, Kokscharof, Min. Russl, i. 34, u. 167, iU 243, elaborate ; v. Lang, Ber. Ak.

Sardinian is distorted anglesite from Monteponi in Sardinia, with which Richter found it to agree in composition ; G. = 6-380\u2014 6-392 ; H.=3\u2014 35 ; white and like anglesite in lustre. Breit haupt makes it hemidomatic (monocUnic or hemihedral) ; and found for the fundamental prism the angle 101\u00b0 52' ; and says that the bisectrix of the optical angle is normal to a plane truncating an edge of the fundamental prism, and not to the base as in anglesite. The optical fact stated shows that the prism is normaUy orthometric ; and if the plane referred to be made the base (or plane O) then the mineral agrees with anglesite, both crystaUographically and opticaUy. The so-caUed fundamental prism is prism i-i of anglesite, which has the angle, as above given, 101\u00b0 14'. The form approaches fig. 516 above. Alt. \u2014 Anglesite occurs altered to cerussite (Pb C) ; also to a hydrous anglesite, according to Breith. 634. ZINKOS1TE. Zinkosit Breith., B. H Ztg, xi. 100, 1852. Anhydrous Sulphate of Zinc.

Obs. \u2014 This ore has been found at LeadhiUs, with other ores of lead ; also in crystals at Red Gill, Cumberland, and near Taunton in Somersetshire. Grenada is also stated to be a locality of it, and the island of Serpho, Grecian Archipelago. The crystals seldom exceed an inch in length, and are commonly smaller. Reported by C. U. Shepard (Am. J. Sci., II. xv. 446) from Newberg District, S. C, but there is some doubt as to the locality ; also from the Morgan silver mine, Spar- tanburg District, S. C. Brooke and Miller, who show that the form of leadhillite is orthorhombic, make the prism J-i (of 120\" 20') the fundamental vertical prism, and appear to regard the species as related to aragonite. The fact that the twins are not formed parallel to the faces of this prism (as they should be if the prism -J-i were homologous with the aragonite prism), and the close approximation in angle to anglesite, shown above, besides other reasons, have led the author to adopt the position of the crystals here given, which exhibits the anglesite relation. Susannite (rhombohedral) and leadhil- lite (orthorhombic) are mutually dimorphs, and so also are dreelite and anglesite. Now susannite and dreelite are nearly identical in angle ; and therefore leadhillite and anglesite must be equally related. Since in susannite the sulphuric acid dominates over the carbonic acid, and impresses on the lead salt its character (or the form of the sulphate), the same should be the case with its cor- relate leadhillite \u2014 this species being the 'very same chemical compound. (See on this subject, Am. J. Sci., II. xviii.). The hemihedrism of the species gives origin to the peculiar rhombohe dral aspect of the twins. The angles of these twins are near those of susannite. Fig. 1 is partly from Mohs, with other occurring planes, and is introduced to show the relations of the planes in the position of the crystal adopted. On crystallization, Haidinger, Ed. Phil.

With salt of phosphorus gives an emerald-green bead in both flames. Fused with bisulphate of potash in the platinum spoon forms a dark violet mass, which on soUdifying becomes reddish, and when cold greenish-white, thus differing from vanadi nite, which on simUar treatment gives a yeUow mass (Plattner). Obs.\u2014 First found at Beresof in Siberia, in crystals in quartz veins, or intersectmg gneiss or granite ; also occurs at Mursinsk and near Nischne TagUsk in the Ural, in narrow veins, traversing decomposed gneiss, and associated with gold, pyrite, galenite, quartz, and vauquelinite ; in BrazU, at Congonhas do Campo, in fine crystals in decomposed granite; at Retzbanya in Hungary, at the mine of St. Anthony ; Moldawa in Hungary ; on Luzon, one of the PhUippines, whence crystals were received by the author in 1 842, from El Senor Roxas of ManUa, and understood to be from the northern peninsula of Luzon ; according to Dr. Hochstetter, at the mines of Labo, in the Province of North Camarines, on the southeastern peninsula of Luzon (Dauber). This species was first noticed by Lehman (1. a). The name Crocotte is from \u00abpo*os, saffron. Berthier, in 1832, gave the word the bad form Crocoise, which von KobeU altered (to make it con formable to ordinary mineralogical nomenclature) in 1838, to Crocoisite, and Breithaupt, in 1841, to Crocoite (Krokoit), and v. KobeU also to this last mentioned form in his later works. Haus mann's Callachrome has the priority ; but as the name is a poorer one, not mineralogical in form, and the species was not one instituted by Hausmann, we aUow Crocoite to stand. 643.

Named Melanochroite by Hermann, from u.t\\as, black, and xo6ai color. But, as the color is red, and not black, and the name is therefore false to the species, Glocker changed it to Ph\u0153nicochrc ite, from foirtms, deep red, and xp6a ; and in this he is foUowed by Hausmann. The abbreviated form ph\u0153nicite is bad, because it is too much like the name of another mineral, phenacite. 644. VAUQUELINITE. Yauqueline Berz., Ash, vi. 100, 1818. VauqueUnite Berz., N.Syst Min.

The artificial salt was discovered by Glauber, a German chemist, about the middle of the"], [693, "HYDROUS SULPHATES. 637 seventeenth century, whUe he was operating with sulphuric acid and common salt ; and the name sal mirabile was his own expression of surprise at its formation.

The so-caUed Reussin is impure glauber salt, as pronounced by Reuss in 1791, after his early study of it. It occurred as a deposit of crystals and efflorescent crusts in or about the mineral springs of Saidschitz and SedUtz, and according to Reuss was most abundant near the end of the spring. The crystals (some of which were i to 2 in. long) had the form of stout 6-sided prisms, with two sides smaUer than the others, terminating in two rhomboidal planes \u2014 the form of glauber salt. It is stated to have become a white powder on the expulsion by heat of the crys taUization-water. The analysis was made first on a solution of the salt, and afterward on the effloresced salt, which contained as a result of efflorescence (the usual result) no water ; and hence the amount of water was not ascertained. Crystals reproduced from the solution lost more than half their weight when heated to redness ; corresponding with the fact that bothglauber salt and epsomite contain more than 50 p. c. of water. The analysis afforded Reuss Na S 66-04, MgS 31*55, MgCl 2-19, Ca 8 0-42; which, adding the water and excluding the Mg Cl, corresponds to 68-0 of glauber salt, 3T7 of epsomite, and 0'3 of gypsum=100. Exanthalose Beud. (Tr., ii. 475, 1832) is a white efflorescence, such.as results from the expo sure to the air of glauber salt. Beudant obtained the composition Na S + 2 fl from the analyses : 1.

The gypsum of East River, Pictou, Nova Scotia, according to Prof. W. R. Johnson, and that of Southern Virginia, according to Prof. W. B. Rogers (Am. J. Sci., II. v. 113, 1848), contain 1 atom of water to 2 of sulphate of lime (2 Ca \u00a7 + A), the former affording S 54-7, Ume 394, fl 5-90. The passage of anhydrite into gypsum is exemplified on a large scale in many places, as at the Canaria valley and at Bex in Switzerland (Blum. Pseud., p. 24; Am. J.

This compound is formed artificiaUy only at a high temperature, or above 120\u00b0 C. The incrustations in steam-boUers on the ocean consist largely of it, as shown by J. F. W.

Obs. \u2014 Gypsum often forms extensive beds in connection with various stratified rocks, especiaUy Umestones, and marlytes or clay beds. It occurs occasionaUy in crystaUine rocks. It is also a product of volcanoes, occurring about fumaroles, or where sulphur gases are escaping, being formed from the sulphuric acid generated, and the lune afforded by the decomposing lavas \u2014 lime being contained in augite and labradorite. It is also produced by the decomposition of pyrite when lime is present; and often about sulphur springs where sulphuretted hydrogen is emitted, this gas changing, through reaction with vegetable matter, into sulphuric acid. Gypsum is also deposited ou the evaporation of sea-water and brines, in which it exists in solution. Crystals may be seen to form on evaporating a drop of sea- water in the field of a microscope. Fine specimens are found in the salt mines of Bex in Switzerland ; at HaU in the Tyrol ; in the sulphur mines of Sicily; in the gypsum formation near Ocana in Spain; in the clay of Shotover Hill, near Oxford ; and large lenticular crystals have been met with at Montmartre, near Paris. A noted locality of alabaster occurs at Castelino, 35 m. from Leghorn, whence it is taken to Florence for the manufacture of vases, figures, etc. This species occurs in extensive beds in several of the United States, and more particularly N. York, Ohio, Illinois, Virginia, Tennessee, and Arkansas, and is usually associated with salt springs. Also in Nova Scotia, Peru, etc. Handsome selenite and snowy gypsum occur in N. York, near Lockport (occasionally f. 532) in limestone along with pearl spar and anhydrite ; also near CamiUus, Onondaga Co. ; occasionally crystals are met with in the vicinity of Manlius. In Maryland, large grouped crystals on the St. Mary's, in clay; also near the mouth of the Patuxent. In Virginia, large beds of gypsum with rock salt, in Washington Co., 18 m. from Abingdon ; also near Lynchburg. In Ohio, large transparent crystals havAeen found at Poland and Canfield, TrumbuU Co.

There seems to be good reason for accepting as the true fundamental form that above adopted, since the planes of the fundamental prism I, and 0, cor- respond in this case to directions of cleavage. Most authors make 2-i the prism I, and 2-i (of rare occurrence) the plane 0. The symbols, on this basis, with tbe lettering of MUler, are as foUows, foUowing the above order (Hessenberg, Min.

Named from yvtpos, the Greek for the mineral, but more especiaUy for the calcined mineraL The derivation ordinarily suggested, from yn, earth, and .-//-_>, to cook, corresponds with this, the most common use of the word among the Greeks. Theophrastus, after mentioning localities, speaks of the making of gypsum by burning the proper stones (among which alabaster is included) ; of making plaster or cement from it by \" powdering it, pouring on water, and stirring it with wooden instruments, there being too much heat for the hand; \" of the necessity of preparing it \" imme- diately before the use of it, because it soon dries and becomes hard ; \" of its value for whitening the walls of houses, and of its being an excellent material for making images and ornaments. The word yixbos in Plato and Herodotus has been sometimes translated chalk, but not so in the latest and best Lexicon \u2014 the recent edition of Stephanus. The sentences in Herodotus containing it, and the verb y .i//-_i derived from it meaning to cover or whiten with gypsum, are most intelUgible if calcined gypsum, or preparations from it, are understood. Powdered chalk is not hkely to have been used for a whitewash ; and a wash is impUed instead of dry chalking. Moreover, true chalk was probably unknown to the Greeks, it being a produc- tion of more western countries ; and, according to Pliny, even the Romans included under their term Creta (Latin for chalk) principaUy clays, and prominently the \" Cimolian earth \" (CimoUte, p. 457 ), true chalk being what Pliny caUs \" the inferior kind.\" Theophrastus speaks of a Tymph\u0153an gypsum (so caUed by the people of Tymph\u00e6a) which was a fuUer's earth of some kiud. The word yixpos is, therefore, much more likely to have been appUed at times to white clays than to true chalk. The ancients were acquainted with Ume from the burning of Umestone, and could not have caUed this yiip.is. Plato's expression, Tfiv Sc ~o\u00abri A_u_i* y-'i//-. fi Ac.-ortpax, \" Whiter than gyp- sum or snow,\" is not improved by supposing il chalk; for there is nothing whiter than calcined gypsum, or the ceilings or ornaments made from it. Selenites (=moon-stone) of Dioscorides, which he says was also caUed aphroselenon (moon-froth), \" because it was found at night whUe the moon was on the mcrease,\" was probably crystaUized gyp- sum or modern selenite. His description X.v.-f, _i\u00ab.yrjs, aovfos (=white, transparent, light), is good as far as it goes ; and the uses of the stone which he mentions also agree better with this view than with that of its being either the modern moonstone or cats-eye, to which it has been referred. The name is from o-_X>j\u00bb7), moon, and aUudes probably to the peculiar moon-Uke white reflections. Some aggregated crystallized masses might well have suggested the name aphroselenon. It is doubtful what Pliny had in view under the name selenitis (xxxvii. 67) : it is probable, from his brevity on the subject, that he did not know the mineraL Lapis specularis (Specular-stone) of Pliny was mostly crystaUized gypsum (the rest being mica); he speaks of it (xxxvi. 69) as affording by burning the best of gypsum. ' AXaff aoToiTiis (or alabaster-stone, meaning the stone out of which ointment vases of the kind caUed alabaslra were made) was with Theophrastus and Pliny mainly if not whoUy stalagmite, which is now osten caUed oriental alabaster (see under Calcite) ; and Thebes in Egypt was a famous locality. Such vases were made of other materials, and it is possible that gypsum-alabaster was one ; for when polished it often resembles some clouded stalagmites. This opinion is favored \u2014 though not placed beyond question \u2014 by the statement in Theophrastus, which PUny reiterates,* that the gypsum-stone is \"very simUar to,\" '-notunUke\" (meaning in the rough state, of course) olabastrites, which resemblance is not obvious if stalagmite is the only alabastrites. The alabas- iritis of Pliny, from Syria, said to be white spotted with various tints, may be offciis kind, as Syria was noted for its gypsum-stone, according to Theophrastus and Pliny. * It is not clear that PUny is here independent authority. He appears to _t. citing from Theophrastus in the most of what he says about gypsum ; and in one or two cases!!- cites blun deringly. He says, for instance, that plaster aster hardening may by pounding be powdered [for use again] ; whereas Theophrastus states more correctly that \"by burning it may again and again be made fit for use.\""], [697, "HYDROUS SULPHATES. 641 ' _\\&ffaoT0ov (alabastron) occurs as the name of alabaster-stone in the writings of the histo rian Herodianus about two centuries aster Christ, but without description. The alabastrum of Pliny, something white and froth-like, caUed also, as he says, stimmi, stibi, and larbasis, and com ing from sUver mines, cannot be alabaster. There is here probably some mistake on the part of PUny. Burnt gypsum is called Plaster-of-Paris, because the Montmartre gypsum quarries, near Paris are, and have long been, famous for affording it.

It is manufactured for the arts, and is very extensively employed in medicine and dyeing. White vitriol, as the term is used in the arts, is the sulphate of zinc in a granular state, like loaf sugar, produced by melting and agitation whUe cooling. The name Gallitzenite, which has priority, was given the mineral by Beudant from a popular German name Galitzenstein. But although so caUed in Germany, zinc vitriol is not a stone from GaUcia (Poland), as the word impUes, whUe it is eminently a product of the mines of Goslar in the Harz.

Beudant ascertained that there was a native alum-Uke mineral which had the constitution attributed last century to true alum \u2014 that is, was a simple sulphate of alumina, without an alkaU or other prot oxyd (Tr., 449, 1824). Griiner, in 1821 (GUb. Ann., lxix. 218), made known a native ammonia alum; Thomson, in 1828 (Ann. Lye. N. Y., in. 19, 1828), a native soda-alum; A A. Hayes, in 1845 (Am. J.

On coal it fuses readUy to a black slag, giving off a strong selenium odor, and is finally reduced to a metaUic globule. With borax it fuses and forms a yeUowish-green pearl, which is of the same color on cooling. With soda on charcoal metaUic lead is obtained. Occurs with selenid of antimony and lead, malachite, etc., at the Friederichsgliick mine, near HUburghausen, and at Eisfeld. May it be a selenate, or is it only a mixture ? 7. CARBONATES. The carbonates have a hardness not exceeding 5, and consequently will not, when pure, strike fire with a steel. The anhydrous come under the common general formula, KO, CO5, but present three types of crystallization, a rhombohedral, with R A R near 105\u00b0 ; an orthorhombic, with I A /near 120\u00b0; and a monoclinic, with I A I near 105\u00b0. They constitute therefore a case of pleomorphism, while all, still, are approximately isomorphous. These anhydrous species have a vitreous to subpearly lustre, and are typi cally spars. The hydrous carbonates vary much in crystallization, and in some cases have a strongly pearly lustre. All effervesce in hot acids, and part of them in cold. I. ANHYDROUS CARBONATES.

Carbonaceous matters, or carbon, give a clear yellowish tint to some crystaUized calcite and various duU colors, from pale drab and buff through gray and bluish-gray to deep black, to com pact calcite or Umestone ; the carbonaceous matters having been derived from the animals of the sheUs, corals, etc., out of which the limestones were originaUy made, or from the plants of the same seas, just as soUs and mud are now colored from the same cause ; and when these carbo naceous matters are allied to petroleum or bitumen, the rock has a fetid or bituminous odor when struck with a hammer. The fact that the dark colors mentioned are due to carbonaceous sub stances and not to metaUic oxyds is proved by the rocks affording, when burnt, white quicklime. The black marbles thus colored are named Anlhraconite (from dvOpa(, coal) by v. MoU (Ephemer., ii. 305, 1806), Lucullan by John (Ch. Unters., 219), and Lucullite by Jameson (Min., ii. 180, 1816); they include the Marmor Luculleum Plin. (xxxvi. 6). The Nero Antico of the ItaUans belongs here. The bituminous or fetid limestones are also caUed anthraconite when black ; and also, from the odor, Sioineslone (syn. Stinkstone; Slinkstein, Sanstein, Stinkkalk, Germ.), some being Ught gray in color. Dolomite, or carbonate of lime and magnesia, often constitutes the veins and shells of a compact Umestone, as shown by Hunt; and the magnesia found by analysts in such rocks may be gen erally present as a mixture of dolomite with calcite, rather than as a chemical substitution of magnesia for lime. (See under Dolomite.) Sand, chlorite, and other minerals are sometimes taken up mechanicaUy by crystallizing calcite. Mica, talc, chlorite, serpentine are often disseminated in crystalline limestones, having been formed in them at the time of their crystallization, and are among the materials which produce the cloudings or variegated colors of such limestones. Tho varieties that have been named are as foUows : A. Well crystallized. 1. Ordinary. Crystals and crystallized masses afford easily cleavage rhombohedrons ; and when transparent they are what is caUed Iceland Spar, and also Doubly-refracting Spar (Doppel-spath Germ.). The crystals vary in proportions from broad tabular to moderately slender acicular, and take a great diversity of forms. But the extreme kinds so pass into one another through those that are intermediate that no satisfactory classification is possible. Many are stout or short in shape because normally so. But other forms that are long tapering in their fuU development occur short and stout because abbreviated by an abrupt termination in a broad o, or an obtuse rhombohe dron (as -i or R), or a low scalenohedron (as J3), or a combination of these forms ; and thus the crystals having essentially the same combinations of planes vary greatly in shape. The foUow ing groups may answer some purpose in the arrangement of the crystals in a cabinet. They are here characterized by stating the form or forms that are dominant, or most largely developed ; and the term abbreviated is used as above explained. Intermediate forms may be assigned to the group with which they have the most in common, (b) o group, or flat tabular (f. 553a) ; the edges of the tables may be made of prismatic planes, or of rhombohedral, etc. (c) Low rhom bohedral or naU-head, \u2014 IR, -iR, etc. (d) R group, the fundamental rhombohedron dominant (f. 550). (e) fi?, or cuboid group, (f) 2R group, (g) 2R abbreviated, (h) iR group, (i) iR abbreviated, (j) Long rhombohedron group, including the longer rhombohedrons, of which 11, 13, -14, are rather common (f. 551). (k) Long rhombohedron abbreviated, producing some times forms that look much Uke 3- or 6-sided prisms (f. 553d). (I) Low scalenohedron group, M ia, t . etc. (m) Ordinary scalenohedron or dog-tooth group, that of la, one of the most com mon of forms (f. 552a, 555-559). (n) Same abbreviated (f. 564, 565). (o) Long scalenohedron group, or that of I7, 1\", etc. (p) Same abbreviated, (q) Prism-scalenohedron group, the scalenohe dral planes being combined with an oblong prism i (f. 554). (r) Prismatic group, the prism i being elongated and dominant ; and variously terminated. Preunnerite Esmark, from amygdaloid in Faroe, is calcite in cuboid crystals and massive, smalt blue to violet in color, brownish-yeUow by transmitted Ught, subtransparent to translucent, and chalcedonic in aspect. 2. Twin-crystals. Groups (--/corresponding to the different kinds described on p. 675. 3. Crystals with internal impurities, etc. (a) Having interior planes or other evidence of changes in the progress of their formation (f. 575, 576, 579). (.) Containing impurities symmetricaUy arranged. 4. Spiral or curved aggregations of crystals, (a) Spirally arranged crystals, (b) Bent or curved erystaUizations. 5. Pseudomorphous calcite. Natrocalcile includes pseudomorphs of calcite after celestite from Sangerhausen, named under the mistaken idea that the material contained soda. 6. Reichite (Breith., B. H. Ztg., xxiv. 311) is a pure calcite from Alston-Moor m Cumberland, white in color, with an angle of 105\u00b0 20', according to Breithaupt's measurements, and G.=2-666 2*677."], [734, "678 OXYGEN COMPOUNDS.

Paris, 1775, Chaux carbonatee quartzif.re __, 1801) ; crystals of the form in fig. 550c, from Fontainebleau and Nemours, France, which contain a large amount of sand, some 50 to 63 p. c. according to Delesse, with G.=2'53\u2014 2'84, the latter from one containing 57 p. c. of sand. 15. Hislopite Haughton (PhiL Mag., IY. xvii. 16, 1859) is a grass-green cleavable calcite from Central India, containing about 14 p. c. of a sUiceous material like glauconite (q. v.), to which the color is owing. C. Varieties based on fibrous or lamellar structure. 1 6. Satin Spar ; fine fibrous, with a sUky lustre. Resembles fibrous gypsum, which is also caUed satin spar, but is much harder and effervesces with acids. 17. Argentine Kirwan (Min., i. 104, 1794 ; Schieferspath Hofmann, Bergm. J., 188, 1789; Slate Spar). A pearly lameUar calcite, the lameU\u00e6 more or less undulating ; color white, grayish, yel lowish, or reddish. 18. Aphrite, in its harder and more sparry variety (Schaumspath Freiesleben), is a foUated white pearly calcite, near argentine ; in its softer kinds (Schaumerde W., Silvery Chalk Kirwan, Ecume de Terre H.) it approaches chalk, though lighter, pearly in lustre, sUvery-white or yeUowish in color, soft and greasy to the touch, and more or less scaly in structure. D. Granular massive to cryptocrystalline ; Limestone, Marble, Chalk. 19. Granular limestone (Saccharoidal limestone, so named because Uke loaf sugar in fracture). The texture varies from quite coarse to very fine granular, and the latter passes by imperceptible shades into compact limestone. The colors are various, as white, yeUow, reddish, green, and usually they are clouded and give a handsome effect when the material is polished. When such limestones are fit for poUshing, or for architectural or ornamental use, they are caUed marbles. (a) Statuary marble is pure white, fine grained, and firm in texture. The Parian marble from the island of Paros (the Lychnises of the ancients), Penielican from the quarries near \u2022 Athens, lumi marbles of the coast of Tuscauy, and the Carrara, of Modena, Italy, are among the best of statu ary marbles. Architectural marble includes both white and colored. (6) The Cipolin of Italy is white, with pale greenish shadings from green talc; it does not stand the weather well, (c) Giallo antico of Italy is ochre-yeUow to cream-yellow, with some whitish spots, (d) The Sienna, or Brocatello de Sienna, is yeUow, veined or clouded with bluish-red. having sometimes a tinge of pur ple, (e) The Mandelato is a Ught red with yeUowish- white spots. A red kind from Tireo in Scot land has different shades of red, as rose-red, flesh-red, reddish-white ; one from Tennessee is clouded with brownish- and purplish-red. (/) The Bardiglio is gray with crowded dark well-defined cloudings, consisting partly of serpentine, from Corsica, (g) Turquois-blue marble, from the quar ries of Seravezza near Carrara, has a fine grayish-blue color, veined with white, (h) Verd-Antique is clouded green, the color, owing to the presence of serpentine (see p. 465), yeUowish-green to bluish-green. 20. Hard compact limestone. Yaries from nearly pure white, through grayish, drab, bufl\" yellowish, and reddish shades, to bluish-gray, dark browish-gray, and black, and sometimes"], [735, "ANHYDROUS CARBONATES. 679 variously veined. The colors duU, excepting ochre-yeUow and ochre-red varieties. Many kinds make beautiful marble when poUshed. (a) Black, (b) yellow, (c) red, and (d) fetid kinds have been mentioned (pp. 676, 677). The Pqrtor (d), called sometimes Egyptian marble, is of black color, handsomely veined with yeUow dolomite, and comes from Porto- Venere. near Spezia ; the rock is of the lower Lias. (_) Panno-di-Morte (Death's Robe) of Italy is black, with some white fossU sheUs. (/) Marble of Languedoc is fine deep red or brownish-red, with some white and gray due to fossUs, and is from St. Beaume in France, (g) Griolte, from the Dept. of Herault, France, has a reddish-brown base, with somewhat regularly arranged spots of clear red, and some whitish round spots due to goniar tites. (h) Sarencolin marble, from the Pyrenees, is deep red mixed with gray and yeUow. (i) Bird's-eye marble is gray, with whitish crystaUine points, and is from central New York . (k) Shell-marble includes kinds consisting largely of fossU sheUs ; (I) Madreporic marble, those containing corals ; (m) Encrinal, those containing encrinal (crinoidal) remains, (n) Lumachelle is a dark brown sheU-marble, with brUUant fire-Uke or chatoyant internal reflections proceeding from the sheUs, and from Bleiberg in Carinthia ; and another kind, with the sheUs yeUow, comes from Astrachan. (o) Ruin-marble is a kind of compact calcareous marl, showing, when poUshed, pictures of fortifications, temples, etc., in ruins, due to infiltration of oxyd of iron. ( p) Lithographic stone is a very even-grained compact limestone, usuaUy of buff or drab color ; as that of Solenhofen. (q) Breccia marble is made of fragments of limestone cemented together, and is often very beautiful when the fragments are of different colors, or are imbedded in a base that contrasts weU. The colors are very various. (r) Pudding-stone marble consists of pebbles or rounded stones cemented. It is often caUed improperly breccia marble. (s) Hydraulic limestone is an impure limestone. The French varieties contain 2 or 3 p. c. of magnesia, and 10 to 20 of sUica and alumina (or clay). The varieties in the United States contain 20 to 40 p. c. of magnesia, and 12 to 30 p. c. of sUica and alumina. A variety worked extensively at Rondout, N. Y., afforded Professor Beck (Min. N. Y., 78) Carbonic acid 34-20, lime 25-50, magnesia 12-35, sUica 1537, alumina 9'13, sesquioxydof iron 2-25. Oxyd of iron is rather prejudicial to it than otherwise. Yicat observes that in the best French there are 20 to 30 p. c. of clay, and in that only moderately good 10 to 12 p. c. Au impure Umestone of France, which needs no sand for making the cement, it containing calcite 54 p. c, clay 31, oxyd of iron 15 = 100, is caUed plaster cement (Dufr. Min., iL). 21. soft compact limestone, (a) Chalk is white, grayish-white, or yeUowish, and soft enough to leave a trace on a board. The consoUdation into a rock of such softness may be owing to the fact that the material is largely the hollow sheUs of rhizopods. The creta of the Romans (usually translated chalk) was mostly a white clay, true chalk being Uttle known to the ancients. The kind described by Pliny as the most inferior kind of cretaceous earth, and as used for marking the feet of slaves, was probably true chalk. (b) Calcareous marl (Mergelkalk Germ.) is a soft earthy deposit, often hardly at aU consolidated, with or -without distinct fragments of sheUs ; it generaUy contains much clay, and graduates into a calcareous clay. 22. Concretionary massive, (a) Oolite (Rogenstein Germ.) is a granular limestone, but its grains are minute rounded concretions, looking somewhat like the roe of fish, the name coming from '_>.i/, egg. It occurs among all the geological formations, from the Lower SUurian to the most recent, and it is now forming about the coral reefs of Florida, (b) Pisolite (Erbsenstein W.) con sists of concretions as large often as a small pea, or even larger, the concretions having usuaUy a distinct concentric structure. It is formed in large masses in the vicinity of the Hot Springs at Carlsbad in Bohemia. 23. Deposited from calcareous springs, streams, or in caverns, etc. (a) Stalactites are the calcareous cylinders or cones that hang from the roofs of Umestone caverns, and which are formed from the waters that drip through the roof; these waters hold some bicarbonate of Ume in solution, and leave carbonate of lime to form the stalactite when evaporation takes place. Stalactites vary from transparent to nearly opaque ; from a granular crystaUine structure to a radiating fibrous ; from a white color and colorless to yeUowish-gray and brown. (b) Stalagmite is the same material covering the floors of caverns, it being made from the waters that drop from the roofs, or from sources over the bottom or sides ; cones of it sometimes rise from the floor to meet the stalactites above. It consists of layers ; but these are very irreg ularly curved, or bent, owing to the knobs and conelets that are made over the floor; and polished specimens generally owe much of their beauty to the agate-like or onyx-Uke bandings. Stalagmite is the Alabastrites (alabaster-stone) in part (if not whoUy) of Theophrastus, Pliny, and other ancient writers ; that is, the stone of which ointment vases, of a certain form caUed alabasters, were made. (See Gypsum, p. 640.) A locaUty near Thebes, now weU known, was"], [736, "680 OXYGEN COMPOUNDS. largely explored by the ancients, and the material has often been hence called Egyptian alabaster. It was also formerly caUed onyx and onychites; Horace,' in the 3d book of his Odes, speaks of au ointment vase of onyx Pliny mentions columns of \"onyx,\" or \"alabastrites,\" that were 32 ft. in height, and mentions Damascus as affording a kind whiter than that of Thebes. In the arts it is often now called Oriental Alabaster; and sometimes also Gibrallar-stone, from the occurrence of the material in a cavern at Gibraltar. (c) Calc-sinter, Travertine, Cale Tufa. Travertine ( Confetto di Tivoli) is of essentiaUy the same origin with stalagmite, but is distinctively a deposit from springs or rivers, especiaUy where in large deposits, as along the river Anio, at TivoU, near Rome, where the deposit is scores of feet in thickness. It has a very cavernous and irregularly banded structure,. owing to its mode of formation. It is the Lapis Tiburtinus of Vitruvius, u. c 7, and PUny, xxxvi 48, etc. ; the word travertine being a corruption of tiburtine. It includes also, especially under the name of cale tufa, ceUular depositions from the waters of smaU springs or sources, which often contain fossU leaves, twigs, moss, nuts or seed, etc. The 'Osteocollus (Beihwelle, Beinbruch) Gesner (p. 31, 1565), \"qui ossa fracta intra corpus sumptus,\" as was thought at the time (osteocolla of later authors), is, as long since shown, a ceUular cale tufa, consisting of incrustings of fragments of reeds or other marsh plants. It means bone-glue. Inolite, GalUtzin, is also calc-sinter. (d) Agaric mineral; Rock-mUk (Bergmilch, Montmilch, Germ.) is a very soft, white material, breaking easUy in the fingers, deposited sometimes in caverns, or about sources holding Ume in solution. (e) Rock-meal (Berg-mehl Germ., Farina fossilis Bruckm., etc.) is white and Ught, Uke cotton, becoming a powder on the slightest pressure. It is an e_8oise_ce(sce, and is comm.n- near Paris, especiaUy at the quarries of Nanterre. t Analyses: 1, 2, Stromeyer (GUb.

Varieties containing metaUic oxyds color the borax and salt of phosphorus beads accordingly. With soda on platinum foU fuses to a clear mass ; on charcoal it at first fuses, but later the soda is absorbed by the coaL leaving an iufusible and strongly luminous residue of lime. In the soUd mass effervesces when moistened with muriatic acid, and fragments dissolve with brisk effervescence even in cold acid. Obs.\u2014 Andreasberg in the Harz is one of the best European localities of crystaUized calcite ;"], [737, "ANHYDROUS CARBONATES. 681 there are other localities in the Tyrol Styria, Carinthia, Hungary, Saxony, Hesse Darmstadt (at Auerbach), Hesse Cassel, Norway, France, and in England in Derbyshire, Cumberland, CornwaU, Scotland ; in Iceland.

The material of the common marbles is either granular or compact Umestone. These rocks when burnt form quicklime.* Alt. \u2014 Calcite occurs under the forms of dolomite, calamine, spathic iron, malachite, azurite, gypsum, smithsonite, barite, fluorite, limonite, gothite, red iron ore, minium, meerschaum, chlo rite, quartz, chalcedony, garnet, feldspar, mica, pyrolusite, hausmannite, manganite, marcasite, galenite, blende, native copper. The change to dolomite, as Bischof explains, may take place through bicarbonate of magnesia in solution ; to spathic iron (Fe C) through sulphate of iron in solution, forming sulphate of lime and carbonate of iron ; or by carbonated waters containing bicarbonate of iron, which slowly dissolve calcite, whUe the carbonate of iron takes its place, forming a pseudomorph by substitution ; to smithsonite (ZuC) through sulphate of zinc in solu tion; to calamine (2n3Si+l_ fl) probably by a change first to 2nC and then to the sUicate, through alkaline silicates iu solution ; to malachite through a solution of sulphate of copper, which forms carbonate of copper and sulphate of lime ; to gypsum or anhydrite through the action of sulphuric acid, which acid is produced by the oxydation of sulphuretted hydrogen or otherwise, thus forming sulphate of lime; to quartz by waters containing alkaline sUicates, which afford free silica ; to fluorite, limonite, and other species, by the removal of the Ca C by waters which hold carbonic acid or alkaline sUicates, and at the same time contain the ingredients forming the replacing mineral. Limonite or red iron ore might result from the decomposition of pyrite in the vicinity. HoUow scalenohedrons from the province of Arnsberg were found by Noggerath (Verh. nat. Ver.

Some kinds included under the name have the two carbonates in other proportions ; but this may arise from their being mixtures of dolomite with calcite or mag nesite. Protoxyd of iron replaces part of the magnesia in some dolomite ; so also protoxyd of manganese ; and more rarely oxyd of cobalt or zinc. The varieties are the foUowing : (1) CrystaUized. Pearl spar includes rhombohedral crystaUizations with curved faces. (2) Columnar or fibrous. Miemite, from Miemo, Tuscany, is either in crystals, columnar, or granular, aud pale asparagus green iu color. (3) Granular, or saccharoid, constitutes many of the kinds of white statuary marble, and white and colored architectural marbles, names of some of which have been mentioned under calcite. (4) Compact massive, like ordinary limestone. Many of the limestone strata of the globe are here included, and much hydraulic limestone, noticed under calcite. (5) Compact porcellanous, Gurhofian; snow-white and subtranslucent, with a conchoidal frac ture, sometimes a little opal-like; from Gurhof, iu lower Austria. (6) Ferriferous; Brown spar, in part. Contains carbonate of iron, and as the proportion increases it graduates into ankerite (q. v.). The color i3 white to brown, and becomes brownish on expo sure through the oxydation of the iron. A columnar kind, containing 10 p. c. of carbonate of iron, has been caUed Brossite (anal. 19); G.=2915. Tharandite, from Tharand, near Dresden, is crystaUized, and contains 4 p. c. of Fe.

Very many of the Umestone strata of the globe are thus partly or whoUy dolomitic, though usuaUy not as pure as in the above analyses. T. S- Hunt says that dolomites make up the chief part of the Calciferous, Clinton, Trenton, Guelph, Niagara, and Onondaga limestones of Canada (Logan's Rep., 1863, 456). In 1857 (Logan's Rep., 1857, 200) he announced that the veins and shells of some ordinary limestones were magnesian. In the Portor marble (p. 679) the body of the rock contains only 1*0 p. c. of carbonate of magnesia, and the veins 35-5 p. c. A limestone from Dudswell, Canada, contains CaC 92-5, MgC 1*3, sand 6-2; and the fossUs are of similar composition ; but a yellowish material enveloping the fossUs and filling veins consists of Ca 0 66-60, MgC 11-76, FeC 3-23, with 26-72 mso!uble=98-31. This being a mixture of dolomite and calcite, the latterwas removed by acetic acid, and the residue, 52 p. c, then afforded CaC 51*75, MgC 35*73, FeC 12-52=100. In the Trenton Umestone of Ottawa, the fossU corals, sheUs, and crustaceans are changed to whitish dolomite ; and a fragment of an Orthoccras gave CaC 56-00, MgC 37-80, FeC 5-95=99-75. Pyr., etc. \u2014 B.B. acts like calcite, but does not give a clear mass when fused with soda on platinum foil. Fragments thrown into cold acid are very slowly acted upon, while in powder in warm acid the mineral is readily dissolved with effervescence. The ferriferous dolomites become brown on exposure. Obs. \u2014 Massive dolomite constitutes extensive strata, caUed limestone strata, in various regions. CrystaUine and compact varieties are often associated with serpentine and other magnesian rocks, and with ordinary Umestones. Some of the prominent localities are at Salzburg, the Tyrol, Schemnitz in Hungary, Kapnik in Transylvania, Freiberg in Saxony, tho lead mines at Alston in Derbyshire, etc. In the U. States, in Vermont, at Roxbury, large, yeUow, transparent crystals osthe rhomb-spar variety, in talc. In Rhode Island, at Smithfield, a coarse cleavable variety, occasionaUy presenting perfect crystals, with white talc in calcite. In A. Jersey, at Hoboken, white hexagonal crystals (f. 580), and in rhombohedrons. In N. York, at Lockport, Niagara FaUs, and Rochester, with calcite, celestite, and gypsum ; also at Glenn's FaUs ; in Richmond Co., at the quarantine, crys tallized dolomite, in rhombohedrons, and at the Parish ore bed, St. Lawrence Co. ; on Hustis's farm in PhUlipstown, a variety resembling Gurhofite, with a semi-opaline appearance and a fracture nearly like porcelaiu. Dolomite is generaUy supposed to be injurious as a manure for soils, on account of its magnesia; but this is not so, unless used after calcination, before it is fully air-slaked. The lime it affords when burnt makes a more durable cement than common limestone. Named after Dolomieu, who announced some osthe marked characteristics of the rock in 1791 \u2014 its not effervescing with acids, while burning like Umestone, and soluble after heating in acids. He observes in his paper that, as early as 1786, he had found the white marble of many of the ancient statues and monuments of Italy to consist of this peculiar rock ; and eighteen months before the date of his paper he discovered \"immense quantities of simUar limestones \" in the Tyrol. Woulfe, in the PhiL Trans. for 1779 (at p. 29), describes a ferriferous dolomite or ankerite, with some analytical determinations, which was in pearly rhombohedrons, resembhng somewhat those of spathic iron, and came from Joachimsthal. \" In its natural state \" it effervesced strongly with \" rectified \" muriatic acid, which would indicate the presence of more iron than he obtained (6 or 6 p. c. of Fe O, C 0-2). It may have been ankerite. Alt. \u2014 Dolomite occurs altered to spathic iron, calamine, steatite, limonite, red iron ore, gothite. pyrolusite, and quartz, and by processes simUar to those explained under calcite."], [741, "ANHYDEOUS CARBONATES. 685 717.

S. Hunt (Logan's Rep., 1863, 457, 611) found the magnesite rock of Canada to contain 8 to 10| P- c- of carbonate of iron, with 8 to 40 p. c. of insoluble matters, mostly mixed quartz. That of Sutton afforded MgC 83-35, FeC 9-02. mixed silica 8-03=100-40. The white portions of the verd-antique of Roxbury, Mass., are magnesite with about 4 p. c. of carbonate of iron, as shown by Jackson, Hayes, and Hunt. In the baudisserite, Berthier found C4L80, Mg 39-00, meerschaum 19-20=100 (Ann. d. M., 1822, 316). A variety of the same was early analyzed by Giobert (J. d. M., xx. 291, 401, 1803), and another, from Castellamonte, by Guyton (Ann. d. Ch., xlvU. 85, 1803). A magnesite from Sasbach, Kaiserstuhl, contains hydromagnesite. P. Meyer found (Ann. Ch. Pharm., cxv. 129), after separating the impurities, C 45'27, Mg 47-69, Ca 2*47, fl 4-57, equivalent to Mg C 82-88, Ca C 4-41, Mg 8-14, fl 457. Pyr., etc. \u2014 B.B. resembles calcite and dolomite, and Uke the latter is but slightly acted upon by cold acids ; in powder is readUy dissolved with effervescence in warm muriatic acid. Obs. \u2014 Found in talcose schist, serpentine, and other magnesian rocks ; as veins in serpentine, or mixed with it so as to form a variety of verd-antique marble (magnesitic ophiolite of Hunt); also, in Canada, as a rock, more or less pure, associated with steatite, serpentine, and dolomite. The breunerite variety has been found in a meteorite from OrgueU (Descl). Occurs at Hrubschiitz in Moravia, where it was first discovered by MitcheU ; at Kraubat and Tragossthal, Styria ; at Frankenstein in Silesia ; Snarum, Norway ; Baudissero and CasteUamonte in Piedmont ; at other locaUties above mentioned. In America, at Bolton, Mass., in indistinctly fibrous masses, traversing white limestone ; at Lynnfield, Cavendish, and Roxbury, Mass., mixed with or veining serpentine ; at BarehUls, near Baltimore, Md. ; in Penn., in crystals at West Goshen, Chester Co. ; near Texas, Lancaster Co. ; as a rock, iu Sutton and Bolton, Canada East ; in Canton Upata, Venezuela, near Mission Pastora, looking like porcelain in the fracture, as observed by N. S. Manross : in Tulare, Alameda, Mariposa, and Tuolumne Cos., California. Delametherie, in his Theorie de la Terre, ii. 93, 1795, uses the name magnesite for the carbonate of magnesia, sulphate, nitrate, and muriate, and the carbonate is placed first in the series. Brong niart, in his Mineralogy, ii 489, 1807, appUes the name to a group, including (1) the carbonate caUed Mitchell's magnesite, (2) meerschaum, (3) the Piedmont magnesite, and (4) other sUiceous varieties. As both Brongniart and Delametherie gave the first place to the carbonate, the name magnesite would rightly fall to it in case of tho division of the group. Karsten, in his TabeUen, 1808, recognized this division of the species, and formaUy gave to the carbonate the name mag nesite. The German mineralogists have foUowed Karsten, as should have been done by aU. But in France, Beudant, in 1824, gave the name giobertite to the carbonate, leaving magnesite for the sUicate, and most osthe French mineralogists have foUowed Beudant. Giobert analyzed only the sUiceous variety from Baudissero, the true composition osthe mineral having been ascertained by Lampadius, somewhat earher, from specimens brought by Mitchell from Moravia. 719.

Obs. \u2014 Siderite occurs in many of the rock strata, in gneiss, mica slate, clay slate, and as clay iron stone in connection with the Coal formation and many other stratified deposits. It is often associ ated with metaUic ores. At Freiberg it occurs in silver miues. In CornwaU it accompanies tin. It is also found accompanying copper and iron pyrites, galenite, vitreous copper, etc. In New York, according to Beck, it is almost always associated with specular iron. OccasionaUy it is to be met with in trap rocks as spherosiderite. In the region in and about Styria and Carinthia this ore forms extensive tracts in gneiss, which extend along the chain of the Alps, on one side into Austria, and on the other into Salzburg. At Harzgerode in the Harz, it occurs in fine crystals in gray-wacke ; also in CornwaU, Alston-Moor, and Devonshire. The Spherosiderite occurs in greenstone at Hanau, Steinheim, and Dransberg, and many other places. Clay iron-stone, which is a sUiceous or argillaceous carbonate of iron, occurs in coal beds near Glasgow ; also at MouiUar, Magescote, etc., in France, eta In the United States, in Vermont, at Plymouth. In Mass., at Sterling. In Conn., at Roxbury, an extensive vein in quartz, traversing gneiss ; at Monroe, Lane's mine, in smaU quantities. In N. York, at the Sterling ore bed in Antwerp, Jefferson Co., in rhombohedral crystals ; at the Ros sie iron mines, St. Lawrence Co. In K Carolina, at Fentress and Harlem mines. The argilla ceous carbonate, in nodules and beds (clay iron-stone), is abundant in the coal regions of Penn., Ohio, and many parts osthe country. In a clay-bed under the Tertiary along the west side of vChesapeake Bay for 50 m."], [747, "ANHYDROUS CARBONATES. 691 Named Spherosiderite by Hausmann in 1813, from the concretionary variety, and retained by him for the whole. Haidinger reduced the name to Siderite, the prefix sphero being applicable only to an unimportant variety. Beudant's name Siderose has an unaUowable termination. Chalybile, Glocker, should yield to Haidinger's earlier name siderite, as recognized by v. KobeU and Kenngott. Alt. \u2014 Spathic iron becomes brown or brownish-black on exposure, owing to a peroxydation of the iron and its passing to limonite (Fe2fis) ; and by a subsequent loss of water, it may pass to red iron ore or specular iron (Fe), or to magnetite (Fo Fe), the last at times a result of deoxydation of Fe by organic substances. It also changes by substitution, or through the action of alkaline siUcates, to quartz. 722. RHODOCHROSITE. Magnesium acido aereo mineralisatum Bergm., Sciagr., 1782 (with- out descr. or loc).

It usuaUy occurs in calcareous rocks, and is generaUy associated with calamine, and sometimes with Umonite. It is often produced by the action of sulphate of zinc upon carbonate of lime or magnesia. Found at Nertschinsk in Siberia, one variety of a dark brown color, containing cadmium, another of a beautiful bright green ; at Dognatzka in Hungary ; Bleiberg and Raibel in Carinthia ; Wiesloch in Baden, in Triassic limestone; Moresnet in Belgium; Altenberg, near Aix la ChapeUe (Aachen), in concentric botryoidal groups. In the province of Santander, Spain, between tho Bay of Biscay and the continuation of the Pyrenees range, at Puente Viesgo, the mountains being only four leagues from the coast ; the smithsonite here occurs in mountain Umestone ; in other places it is found in dolomite, probably muschelkalk ; it is in vertical lodes, found fre- quently in scalenohedrons as a pseudomorph after calcite. At Ciguenza, 5 mUes E. of Santan- der, the lode varies in width from 1 to 2 meters to 1 inch ; the mineral is drusy, cavernous ; blende is abundant, and changes into pure white smithsonite ; the latter also occurs Uke chalce- dony, in reniform and botryoidal masses ; it sometimes contains galena and cerussite. In Eng- land, at Roughten GiU, Alston Moor, near Matloek, in the Mendip HUls, and elsewhere ; in Scotland, at LeadhiUs ; in Ireland, at Donegal. In the U. States, in Conn., at Brookfield in very smaU quantities. In N. Jersey, at Mine HiU, near the FrankUn furnace, only pulverulent from decomposition of zincite. In Penn., at Lancas- ter abundant, and often in fine druses of crystals, also sometimes pseudomorphous after dolo mite; at the Perkiomen lead mine; at the Ueberroth mine, near Bethlehem, in scalenohedrons, also an earthy variety abundant as au ore.

Obs. \u2014 The most common repositories of aragonite are beds of gypsum, beds of iron ore (where it occurs in coraUoidal forms, and is denominated ftos-ferri, \"flower of iron \"), basalt, and trap rock; occasionaUy it occurs in lavas. It is often associated with copper and iron pyrites, galenite, and malachite. It is forming at an old mine in Monte Vasa, Italy, at a temperature below the boUing point of water. It constitutes the pearly layer of sheUs. Minute pointed crystals occur in drusy cavities in the sinter of the thermal springs of Baden. First discovered in Aragon, Spain (whence its name, the word in Spain having but one r), at Molina and Valencia, near HigraniUa, in six-sided prisms, with gypsum, imbedded in a ferruginous clay. Since found at Bilin in Bohemia, in a vein traversing basalt in fine prisms ; at Breisgau in Baden ; at Baumgarten and Tarnowitz in SUesia ; at Leogang in Salzburg, Austria ; in Waltsch, Bohemia, and many other places. The flos-ferri variety is found in great perfection in the Sty rian mines, coating cavities and eveu caves of considerable extent, and associated with spathic iron. At Dufton, a silky, fibrous variety, caUed satin spar, occurs traversing shale in thin veins, generally associated with pyrite. In Buckinghamshire, Devonshire, etc., it occurs in stalactitic forms ia caverns, and of snowy whiteness at LeadhUls in Lanarkshire."], [753, "ANHYDROUS CARBONATES. 697 Aragonite in fibrous crusts and other forms occurs in serpentine at Hoboken, N.

The compound ordinarUy catted bicarbonate of lime. The mineral is known only as a mixture in collyrite, a hydrous sUicate of alumina. J. H & G. Gladstone state (1. c) that there is carbonic acid enough in the coUyrite to form a bicarbonate with the lune present ; but this view of the composition is set aside because of the solubUity of the so-called bicarbonate, and its being unknown in the solid state ; and hence they suggest that the excess of carbonic acid may be combined in the mineral with alumina, making a hydrous carbonate of alumina and lime, or perhaps replaces part of the sttica in the alumina silicate. But although the bicarbonate referred to is known only in solution, the most likely condition for finding it in the mineral kingdom is in one of the hydrous silicates of alumina, Uke coUyrite, in which there is present much water, loosely held ; the mineraL therefore, is most probably a carbonate of the formula above given ; especially since a carbonate in which __1 or Fe enters is, as the authors admit, yet unknown to chemistry.

Also occurs in the neighboring province of Guipuzcoa, Spain, near La Nestosa, at the mines of Las Nieves and La Augustina ; at Bleiberg and Raibel in Carinthia ; near Reimsbeck, in West phaUa; in Hollenthal, on the Zugspitze in Bavaria ; at Taft in the province of Jesd in Persia.

Obs. \u2014 Aurichalcite occurs at Loktefskoi, at a copper mine of the Altai, where it is associated with calcite and limonite, sometimes forming a drusy covering upon these minerals ; at Matloek, in Derbyshire, of a pale green color, laminated structure, and pearly lustre ; at Roughten-GiU, in Cumberland; Leadhills, Scotland; zinc mines of the province of Santander, Spain. In the U. States, at Lancaster, Pa. (Taylor, Am. J. Sci., II. xx. 412). The buratite comes from Loktefskoi ; Chessy, near Lyons ; Framont, Tyrol ; Retzbanya, in Hungary, in microscopic rhombic or rhombohedral tables, and also oblong rectangular forms (a mineral lately proved to be calciferous) ; CampigUa in Tuscany. The mineral aurichalcite was first described as a greenish variety of calamine by Patrin, in 1788 (L c), and caUed Brass ore (Mine de Laiton), \"because,\" as he says, \"the compound of copper and zinc is here made by nature.\" Among the brass or copper ores of the ancients, aurichalcum was reputed the best (Pliny, xxxiii. 2) ; and Sage was thence led to suggest (1. c, 1791) that the cupriferous calamine (which afforded, as he showed by experiment, the best of brass, without the addition of either copper or zinc) might be the ancient aurichalcum. As the ore is a scarce one, this is not at all probable. But the idea explains the use osthe word for the species. In addition, it is to be said that brass (or an alloy related to it) was called aurichalcum by Virgil and Horace, and also in the middle ages. The Latin word aurichalcum is regarded by some good authorities as derived from '.f>_*x_x_o; (=mountain brass); and, in fact, the Latin poets just mentioned wrote it orichalcum. But others regard it as a hybrid word (from the Latin aurum, gqld, and j^aX-ot, brass or bronze), and the o of the poets as an example of the admissible change in Latin of au to o. Glocker, in view of the first of these derivations, changes aurichalcite to orichalcite; but, whatever the derivation, as the use of aurichalcum dates from before PUny's time, we moderns may as well let it stand without correction. 750A.

Erhard obtained for it (L c.) : C 16-48 Cu 7018 fl 9-30 Cl 4*14 gangue 0*70=100-80, whence he derives the formula 7(0u! 0+A)+CuCl-l-3 A, equivalent to 7 of malachite, 1 of a hydrous chlorid of copper. According to this formula the mineral consists of 14 Cu, 10 fl, 1 Cu Cl. If now the Cu Cl is from mixed atacamite, it is combined with 3 Cu fl. The remainder. 11 Cu, 7 0, 7 fi, corresponds, excepting an excess of water, very nearly to the composition of azurite ; 1 1 Cu, 7 i G, 3 J fi, would be precisely azurite. Atlasite may, therefore, be a mixture of about 3| parts of azurite with 1 part of atacamite. 753. BISMUTITE. Bismutit Breith., Pogg, lui. 627, 1841. Kohleusaures Wismuthoxyd, Wismuthspath, Germ.

If the number connected with H is halved in each case, and the barred capitals are replaced by common capitals, they wiU then con form to the old system. The native hydrocarbons are very imperfectly known. Most of the kinds hitherto recognized in mineralogy are more analogous to rocks than minerals. Amber, for example, instead of being a species, is a mixture of four or more species, as Berzelius long since pointed out, and only two of the number have thus far been investigated. The presence of succinic acid, one of these two, is spoken of as an essential constituent and distinguishing feature of amber : and this it is ; but only in the way that feldspar is a constituent of granite. Petroleum, Asphaltum, and the various kinds of mineral resins and wax are simUar mixtures, in the Ught of chemistry, as has been shown by many investigators. But still the true line of investigation is so Uttle appreciated that new resins or asphalts are from time to time brought forward as species in mineralogy upon characters that only prove them to be mixtures. And chemistry, whUe working toward a better state of this department of mineralogy, often faUs in its researches to distinguish educts (native ingredients) from products. The facts in the case, and the true idea of the science, sustain the course of the author in here removing amber from mineralogical species, and caUing, not amber, but the insoluble resin which constitutes four-fifths of its mass, succinite ; and in endeavoring to apply the same method throughout the hydrocarbon section. Much more investigation is demanded before satisfactory results can in aU cases be attained. But by pursuing the subject in the way here recognized, the section wUl ultimately become an exhibition of the actual species of hydrocarbons in nature, and thus be elevated to the same level with other parts of the science."], [779, "723 SIMPLE HYDROCARBONS.

Boston, II. ix. x. Am. J. Sei, II. xl. xiv. xlvL). Pelouze and Cahours continue the naphtha series to .lbH\u201e, and state evidence of the existence of stiU higher members^ But Warren arrived at the conclusion that the naphtha or marsh-gas series terminates with 0, H20, and that the otts of higher density and atomic numbers belong to the ethylene series (0 H3_). More over, Warren brought out the fact that there was a second naphtha group, differing from the other in its higher boiUnl points-the Beta-naphtha group above This chemist also determined with great exactness the shotting points of the two groups, and found that in both there was the"], [780, "724 HYDROCARBON COMPOUNDS. common difference of about 30\u00b0C. for successive terms in the series Cor for a difference of 0 Ha) ; but that the boiling points in the second series were about 8\u00b0 higher correlatively than those of the 1st series, as the tables show. The specific gravities and vapor densities for 761 are from Ronalds. Those of the others, 762 to 772, are from Warren, excepting tlie vapor densities of 762, 763. The vapor density of 767 has not yet been determined. Warren's specific gravities were taken at 0\u00b0 C. Ronalds has observed that the gaseous compounds of the marsh-gas series Oa H\u201e and \u20ac3 H, (2d and 3d terms in the marsh-gas series) also exist in connection with petroleum. Marsh-gas itself, the first term in the series OH.,, is a very common gas of coal beds and bituminous depos its, as well as of modern marshes. Petroleum passes by insensible gradations into pitlasphalt or maltha (viscid bitumen) ; and the latter as insensibly into asphalt or solid bitumen. Petroleum occurs in rocks or deposits of nearly att geological ages, from the Lower Silurian to the present epoch. It is associated most abundantly with argUlaceous shales and sandstones, but is found also permeatiug limestones, giving them a bituminous odor, and rendering them sometimes a considerable source of oil. From these oleiferous shales and Umestones the ott often exudes, and appears floating on the streams or lakes of the region, or rises in oil springs. It also exists collected in subterranean cavities in certain rocks, whence it issues in jets or fountains whenever au outlet is made by boring. These cavities are situated mostly along the course of gentle anticlinals in the rocks of the region ; and it is therefore probable, as has been suggested, that they originated for the most part in the displacements of the strata caused by the slight uplift. The ott which fills the cavities has ordinarily been derived from the subjacent rocks ; for the strata, in which the cavities exist, are frequently barren sandstones. The conditions required for the production of such subterranean accumulations would be therefore (as others have explained) a bituminous oU-bearing, or else oil-producing, stratum at a greater or less depth below; cavities to receive the ott ; an overlying stratum of close-grained shale or Umestone, not aUowing of the easy escape of the naphtha vapors. If the ott exists ready formed in the rocks, only a slight heat above that common to the rocks would be needed to expel the oU slowly from below. And, without heat, as Hunt states, the oil might be expelled through the pressure of superincumbent waters from the oil-bearing shales or clays, and would rise and occupy the cavities because so light as to float on the waters. But if the oil-producing bed contained not the oil ready made, but only hydrocarbonaceoua matters that may afford it on destructive distillation, the ott would have required considerable heat for its production. In the Caspian and Rangoon naphtha regions the oleiferous clayey deposits are nearly or quite superficial, and the oU, a viscid kind, exudes readUy into pits made for cottecting it. In the United States liquid oU occurs in the Lower Silurian, in the \" Bird's-eye \" Umestone of Riviere a la Bose (Montmorenci), Canada, and of Watertown, N. Y, in drops in fossil coral; and in the Trenton limestone at Pakenham, Canada, the cavities of large Orthocerata sometimes hold several ounces (T. S. Hunt, Am. J. Sci., H. xxxv. 166, 1863); on Grand Manitoulin Id, where a spring affording it arises from the Utica shale, the source possibly the subjacent limestones; at Guilderland, near Albany, from the Hudson River group, as observed in a spring by Beck ; quite freely in limestone and shale near Chicago; far more so in Kentucky, in the Cumberland oil region, the wells, \" from which tens of thousands of barrels of oil have flowed \" (Newberry), descend 200 ft. into the Blue Limestone, in which there are bituminous shaly strata overlaid by sheets of thin-bedded compact limestone ; these features prevaU from Lincoln and Casey Cos, through Adair and Russell, Cumberland and Clinton Cos, Ky, and Overton and Jackson Cos, Tenn. In the Upper Silurian traces have been observed in the Niagara limestone and the Medina red shales ; at Gaspe, Canada, in a Lower Helderberg limestone, on Silver Brook, etc. ; near Chicago, so abundant in a Umestone as to ooze out, and the rock may be made to burn, owing to its presence. In the Lower Devonian, the Corniferous limestone is regarded by Hunt as the source of the oil of Enniskillen, Canada, where there are large areas covered by the half-inspissated bitumen. Hunt states (L c.) that at Rainham, Canada, on L. Erie, shells of Pentamerus aralus are sometimes fitted with petroleum ; and that in other places in the region imbedded corals, Heliophyllum and Favosites, have, in certain of the layers, their cells full of oU (while in other layers it is absent from the corals), and in quarrying, the oil flows out and collects on the water of the quarry ; and at Gaspe, Lower Devonian sandstones afford oU springs and give rise to beds of thickened petro leum, and the chalcedonie geodes of a trap dyke, intersecting the sandstone, sometimes contain petroleum. In the Middle Devonian, the Black shale, or Genesee slate, is supposed by many geologists to be the principal source of the oil of Pennsylvania, the Kenawha valley, and other parts of eastern Yirginia, and of Ohio and Michigan ; but J. P. Lesley attributes much of the oU of western Pennsylvania to the Subearboniferous. Near Fredonia, Chatauque Co, and at Rock vUle, Alleghany Co, oil is found in connection with Chemung rocks, or the Upper Devonian (HaU). A little oil has been observed in connection with Triassic shales at Southbury, Conn. The ott"], [781, "SIMPLE HYDROCARBONS. 725 of southern California proceeds from Tertiary shales. On Trinidad a thick oil, with asphalt occurs in connection with lignite and other vegetable remains in the shales constituting the upper part of the Tertiary ; and specimens of the vegetable material, partly changed to oU and pene- trated by it, and having its cells looking as if they had been corroded, as a result of the chan\u00b0-e are described by Watt (Q. J. G. Soc, xvi. 46o). \u00b0 ' Noted foreign locahties are 3 m. from Ye-nan-gyoung (Fetid-ioater-rivulet), Burmah (and exported from Rangoon), where there are about 100 weUs, from 180 to 30U feet deep, each lined with hori- zontal timber, but not all now worked (Oldham); the peninsula of Apcheron on the western shore of the Caspian, at Bakee, where naphtha exudes from argiUaceous and calcareous beds especiaUy the former, of the Middle Tertiary (Abich), and where it has long been used for burn- ing in lamps and for cooking ; near the centre of the region the light and pure naphtha oU is obtained, whUe along its borders the ott is a thicker petroleum, or passes into an asphalt, and solid masses of this asphalt are often seen floating in the Caspian ; on the island of Tscheleken, near the eastern coast of the Caspian, in Balkan Bay; on the banks of the Kuban, promontory of Tainan, east side of isthmus between the Azof and Black Sea ; near the river Betehora, in the government of Archangel Russia ; near the village of Amiano, in Parma, Italy, whence enough was formerly obtained to light the streets of Genoa; at Zante, one of the Ionian islands (ancient Zacynthus), which has furnished oil for more than 2,000 years, its petroleum spring having been mentioned by Herodotus. Pliuy mentions the ott of a spring at Agrigentum, SicUy, and states that it was coUected and used for burning in lamps, as a substitute for oil. He distinguishes this oU from naphtha, which he says was too light and inflammable for such a use. Of naphtha, he mentions a locality in \" Parthia \" (about the sources of the Indus). OU is found also near the city of Mexico, and on the river Lagun. The ott spring of Cuba, Alleghany Co., N. Y, caUed the Seneca OU Spring, long known, was described by Prof. SUliman in 1833 (Am. J. Sci., xxui. 97) as a dirty pool, about 18 ft. across, covered with a film of ott, which was skimmed off from time to time for medicinal purposes. The po-called \" Seneca oil,'' sold at the time in the shops (and from which he often distiUed naphtha for preserving potassium), he observes was not from this spring (around which the Seneca Indians then had a reserve of a square mile), but, as he was told, from Oil Creek, Yenango Co., Pa, about 100 m. from Pittsburg. Seneca Lake has oU on its surface in some parts, and it is said to have given the name to the ott ; but whether this is the true source, or whether it came from its being coUected and sold by the Seneca Indians, is not clear. Hildreth in 1833 (ib, xxiv. 63), and later in 1836 (ib, xxix. 86, 121, 12!)), gave an account of the salt weUs of the Little Kenawha vaUey, which then afforded, he says, 50 to 100 gaUons a year. He also speaks, in 1833, of a weU 475 ft. deep, 30 m. N. of Marietta, Ohio, which, when first opened, discharged at intervals of 2 to 4 days, for 3 to 6 hours each time, throwing out 30 to 60 gaUons of oil at each \"eruption,\" but was then yielding only a barrel a week. In 1 840 a spouting well of oil, at Burksville, Kentucky, was described (ib, xxxix. 195); the well was bored for salt, and 200 ft. down a \"fountain of pure oU was struck, which was thrown up more than 12 ft. above the surface of the earth,\" emitting, according to the estimate, 75 gallons a minute; it \"continued to flow for several days succes- sively,\" but then fatted; and efforts to bring it into action again, or find another, were not suc- cessful. The petroleum of EnniskiUen, Canada, was mentioned in 1844 by Mr. Murray, in the Canada Geological Report for 1846 ; and in 1857 wells were sunk for the coUection of it. In 1859, on Oil Creek, Yenango Co, Pa, a boring for salt, but 75 feet deep, let out the first fountain of oil of that now famous oil-region. For many weeks it discharged 1,000 gaUons per day. The origin of petroleum, including the lighter as well as heavier kinds, has been attributed by some to the decomposition of vegetable substances alone (Bischof, ete.) ; but it is now gene- ratty admitted that it has come from animal as well as vegetable, as urged by Dufrenoy (Min, iv. 602, 1859), J. S. Newberry (Ohio Agric. Rep, 1859), and T. S. Huut (Can. Nat, vi. 241, 1861, Am. J. Sci.. II. xxxv, Ch. News, 1863). The conditions favorable to the formation of naphtha, as shown by the characteristics of the deposits in which it is found native, are the following: (1) the diffusion of organic material through a fine mud or day; (2) the material in a very finely divided state; and (3), as a conse- quence of the preceding, the atmosphere excluded as far as possible from the material undergoing decomposition. There is reason to believe that no more heat was required than what was afforded by the natural climate or temperature osthe region and the process of fermentation. Shales, the most common oil-bearing rocks, were originally the fine mud of deep or shaUow seas ; and the Umestones were the same, only the mud was calcareous in nature, like the coral mud of many a coral lagoon, as the author has elsewhere described after personal examination. These shales ordinarily contain few fossUs of any kind, and very rarely distinct vegetable remains. It may be questioned whether tough fucoids (sea-weeds), or the branches and leaves of ordinary plants imbedded in such clays, would ever become so subdivided or disorganized as to make the requisite emulsion with the mud free from any vegetable forms ; and it is more probable that the vegetable material present was either delicate water-plants, or was derived from abundant infusorial or microscopic vegetable life. The limestones, on the contrary, are sometimes fuU of"], [782, "726 HYDROCARBON COMPOUNDS. fossils, but these axe animal ; and, as the solid parts which make the fossils are to a large extent ground up to make the mud that becomes the Umestone, the organic material these hard parts contain, as well as that of the fleshy parts and otts, would be diffused through the mud or earth in the very condition demanded. The Ught native oils do not occur in coal beds, which were made from thick beds of vegetable debris. In the above-mentioned circumstances, with the deposits under pressure from superincumbent beds, the atmospheric air almost totally excluded, the organic material might undergo decompo sition through the reactions of its own elements alone. (See on this subject, and the reactions mentioned below, Bischof, Chem. G, ii. 1853, T. S. Hunt, Can. Nat. and Ch. News, L c.) The average composition of dry wood (the ash and nitrogen excluded) is represented by Oa H\u201e 04= Carbon 49-66, hydrogen 6-21, oxygen 44-13=100. Taking two parts, we have OuHieOs. If now the oxygen combines with carbon to form carbonic acid, 4 00, will thus be removed, leaviDg 0BHie, which is the composition of one osthe species of the naphtha group, the fifth, on p. 720. But -OeHie, or CuH,!, its multiple by 4, corresponds also to 3 (6, Hh)+\u20acs Hi, +^ (\u20ach H1(), the first two members light naphtha oils, and the last an ethylene, a composition much like that of Pennsylvania petroleum. The decomposition might not be as simple as here taken, as J to 1 p. c. of nitrogen is also present, and there would also be some animal materiaL But the Ulustra tion is still satisfactory. That no water (H2 O) would be formed from the elements of the organic material is apparently indicated by the fact that this would make an excess of carbon or a defi ciency of hydrogen. From Che vandier's numerous analyses (Ann. Ch. Phys, HI. x. 1 29), the average composition of dry wood is carbon 51-21, hydrogen 6'24, oxygen 4P45, nitrogen 1*10, corresponding, if the nitrogen is not counted, to 0i2 H,,.607.s; from which the resulting oils_ might be nearly the same as above. Were there less confinement by superincumbent beds or earthy material, part of the hydrogen might be lost by combining with the carbon and escape as marsh gas (0H4), and thus determine the formation of the thicker oils ; or else of the soUd insoluble hydrocarbons, more or less oxyge nated, which make many shales a rich source of ott on distillation. With the air not weU excluded, as in the case of all thick beds of vegetable debris, such as have formed peat and the various kinds of coal, the decompositions would be more complex ; out side oxygen carrying off, it may be, part of the hydrogen (as water), and of the carbon (as carbonic acid). Thus 0]2 Hi8 08 (composition of wood) may change to 0]2 EM.i Od, the average compo sition olpeal; or to .\u201e Hi2 03.6=Carbon 67'92, hydrogen 5'66, oxygen 26-42 = 100, a medium brown coal (or lignite); or Oi2 H3.,6 0o.87=Carbon 85-88, hydrogen 5-82, oxygen 8-30=100, Wigan cannel coal, etc. Marsh-gas (6H4) is a common gas of marshy places aud of Artesian wells, and so also, though less abundantly, carbonic acid (Bischof). The distttlation of wood witt afford the soUd hydrocar bons of the paraffin group ; Reichenbach, in his discovery of paraffin, obtaining it from the wood of the Fagus sylvatica. Dr. J. S. Newberry states (priv. contrib.) that off the shores of Lake Superior, at Marquette, he observed bubbles of gas coming from the bottom to the surface, which proved to be carburetted hydrogen ; and also, now and then, drops of oU slowly rising, and finally spreading over the surface, which oil proved on examination to be a kind of petroleum. Although the vegetable origin of the oil was not certain, it seemed to be altogether probable. On the island of Trinidad the oil-producing beds are clayey beds in the Tertiary, containing remains of plants, and Watt states (Q. J. G. Soc, xvi. 460) that there is full evidence that the liquid and soUd bitu men was produced at the ordinary temperature and condition of cUmate in the occurrence of numerous specimens of the vegetable matter in process of transformation, which have, as a con sequence, the organic structure more or less obttterated. ln the change of animal matters to ott, there is more nitrogen present to give complexity to the mutual reactions. But when the material is animal oils, there are only carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, as in the case of vegetation. In such oils there are nearly the proportions OieHsiO.. Iu the case of such a compound (oleic acid), the forming of carbonic acid from the oxygen would separate O02, and leave .\u201e H31, of the ethylene ratio; in that of 0,, H3t 02 (margaric acid) the same would leave 0i6 H34, or a combination of marsh-gas oils. Warren and Storer have obtained (Mem. Am. Ac. Boston, ix. 177, Am. J. ScL, II. xiii. 250) from the destructive distillation of a fish-oil, after its saponification by lime, aU the compounds above enumerated of the Naphtha group, besides others of the ethylene and benzole series. Dr. Newberry has observed that cannel coal sometimes shows by its animal fossils that part of its otty products may be of annual origin (Am. J. Sei, II. xxiii. 212, 1857), instancing a case in Ohio in which the coal contained fossil fishes. He also remarks on the disagreeable smeU of some limestone oil, and attributes it to its animal origin. Dufrenoy, in his Mineralogy (iv. 602, 1859), gives prominence to the fact that remains of fishes are common in oU-producing shales, and to the view that they are the source of the oil, men tioning as examples the black shales in the Coal formation at Saarbruck in Prussia, and Ygornay near Autun in France ; the Peruvian (Zechstein) at Mansfeld; grayish limestone, in the Lias, at Doubs; and grayish shale, in the"], [783, "SIMPLE HYDROCARBONS. 727 Middle Tertiary, at Menat, 30 m. from Clermont, France ; all of which abound in the remains of fishes. The shales adjoining the Albertite of Nova Scotia have been mentioned as another exam ple of this kind. The black semibituminous or coaly shales of the Triassic of the Connecticut vaUey contain numerous fossU fishes, aud these are the only fossils. Lesquereux derives petroleum (Trans. Am. Phil. Soc. Philad, xiU. 313) mainly from the decom position of fucoids and other marine plants, arguing for it on the ground of its occurrence so largely in rocks of marine origin. S. F. Peckham, in a recent communication to the author, sustains the idea that the Ught naphtha oUs are solely of animal origin. It is to be noted that wherever marsh or water plants have grown in past time there must have been also a profusion of minute animal life to afford nitrogen and sulphur to the accumula ting debris ; and, conversely, vegetable Use of microscopic, if not also of larger kinds, is present wherever there is animal Use. The word naphtha is from the Persian nafata, signifying to exude ; and petroleum from nirpos, rock, and oleum, ott (the latter from the Greek iXaior, oil), dating only from the middle ages (see Syn.). Alt. \u2014 Petroleum undergoes alteration of condition in two ways : 1. The evaporation of its lighter oils. When exposed to the air the petroleum is free from pres sure, except the ordinary atmospheric, and open to the heat and winds of the region. As a con sequence the Ughter naphtha oUs pass off, leaving only the heavier, and the substance becomes gradually viscid, or even a soUd consisting largely of sottd hydrocarbons ; and the so-called asphalts, which may thus result, will be ordinary bituminous of one kind or another, or largely paraffin, according as paraffin is present or not in the native ott. In most oU regions, when the oU occurs at the surface open to the air, more or less of soUd bitumen is to be found. Hunt speaks of the large \" gum-beds \" of half-dried bitumen in the ott region of EnniskUlen ; and Winchell says that in the neighboring but less productive district in Michigan, masses of inspissated ott are common, and some are as hard as asphalt. At the naphtha island of Tschelekan there are large quantities of Neft-gil, as it is there called, which is nearly pure paraffin. The hot cUmate of the Caspian is favorable for such a result. 2. The oxydation of sqme or all as the ingredients constituting the petroleum. In the process of oxyda tion there is first a loss of some of the hydrogen by its union with oxygen to form water, which escapes. Thus the oils of the Marsh-gas series (0\u201e H2 \u201e +- 2) may pass to the less stable ethylenes (0_H2_); or, by further loss of hydrogen, to species of the Ben_ole series (0_H2._6), or of the Naphthalin series (0- H2__i2). The last two appear to occur sparingly in nature. Secondly, there is oxygenation ; that is an absorption of, and union with, oxygen. These oxygenated substances have been yet but little investigated (see Asphaltum). They are probably all soUd at the ordi nary temperature. Hard bitumen or asphalt may hence consist either (1) of unoxygenated, or (2) partly of unoxy genated and partly oxygenated, the usual fact ; or (3) solely of oxygenated hydrocarbons (very rarely, if ever, true in nature). The state of solidity is not proof that any part of the bitumen is Oxygenated. SCHEERERITE GROUP. Wax-like, or butter-like. General formula that of the Marsh-gas series, or 0n E_2_+2.

Warren, by his superior methods, proves that the species obtained by them were not pure (1. a). Each of the four ethylene compounds above mentioned have been obtained from Rangoon tar, besides some species of the Naphtha group (at least 0, Hi \u201e and 08 Hi 8), traces of some of the Benzole series, and also naphthalin. The name piltollum is from mr.-, pilch, and oleum, ott, analogous to petroleum; andpiitasphal imn, from the Greek for pitch and asphalt. The word maltha is from the Greek pa\\8 ij, soft wax ; it was also used sometimes for a mixture of wax and pitch, employed for making the surface of writing-tablets, and for some kinds of cements. But PUny (u. 108) describes under this name an inflammable mud flowing from a pool at Samosata in North Syria on the Euphrates, which he says (ii. 109) was similar in nature to naphtha ; and this use of the word has led to its later appUcation to viscid bitumens. Petroleum in cavities in crystals. Davy, in his examinations of the fluids in crystals (Phil. Trans, 1822, 367, and postscript), found only water, except in the case of quartz from Dauphiny. The liquid in this case was about as viscid as linseed oil ; brownish in color ; became soUd and opaque at 13\u00b0 C. (56\u00b0 F.) ; had a smell resembling naphtha ; acted like a fixed oU when heated, the tem perature of ebuUition being high ; and burned with flame, producing a white smoke. The cavity was i in. across, but only a sixth of it was occupied by the fluid. Davy made his investigations of the fluids in crystals by having the crystals bored through to the cavity by a lapidary, and was the first to use this method. Peteolene. Boussingault obtained from the viscid bitumen and asphalt of Bechelbronn an oil which he called Petrolene, and announced it as the liquid ingredient of all asphalt, the solid one being named by him Asphaltene (see Asphaltum). It was separated by heating in an ott bath to a temperature of 300\u00b0 C. None of it passed over at a temperature below 100\u00b0 C. He obtained for its composition (Ann. Ch. Phys, lxi. 141, lxxUL 442) : Carbon 87-36 86-78 87-45 86'98 (i) 88-4. Hydrogen 11*90 12*20 1230 12-70 12-5. He writes for it the formula 0iO Hi6, making it of the camphene series, 0, H2\u201e-4. It boiled at 280\u00b0 C. The vapor density is stated at 9415, or \" double that of ott of turpentine.\" There can be no doubt that the petrolene was a mixture of oils. Warren states (priv. contrib.) that from Boussingault's data, as given in his article, the vapor density should have been 8'49 instead of 9-415 ; and also that his own researches on various hydrocarbon oils, including the products from the destructive distttlation of albertite, lead him to beheve that petrolene probably"], [786, "HYDROCARBON COMPOUNDS 730 consists mainly of oils of the Ethylene series ; that 0,\u201e H32 would have for its boding point 295 C, and vapor density 7*745; but that the Uquid is made up of oils of both less and greater density. The Bechelbronn tar and that simUar from Lobsann (both in the Dept. of Bas-Rhin, France) aro called also Mineral Graisse and Graisse de Strasbourg. _-..__,_\u201e\u2022_;\u201e_: Yolckel has subjected a viscid bitumen from Travers, near Neufchatel, to distiUation m iron cylinders (Ann.

But (as Warren observes) with such a mode of distiUation artificial products were likely to have been obtained, and among them benzole or naphthalin ; and the presence of either of these compounds would account for the divergence from the ethylene series. The composition is compared by Yolckel to that of oil of amber (an admitted product of distilla tion, and not native to amber). Dopping obtained for the oU of amber passing over at 200\u00b0 C, C 87-48, 87-32, H 12-06, 11-98=99-54, 99-30. The ratio for 0, H, is 5 : 8, which is also that for amber itself; and the formula is Ok> H,6, or that arrived at by Boussingault for his petrolene. Solid Petrolene. The asphalt of Peklenicza (Murakoz), Austria, affords a solid portion, solu ble in ether and hardly at all so in alcohol (in this respect Uke the asphaltene of Boussingault), which, according to Nendtvich (Haid. Ber, iiL 271, Jahrb. G. Reichs, viL 743), has the same composition with petrolene. The observations thus far made seem to point to a Camphene series of Hydrocarbons as char acteristic of many viscid bitumens, and of some, if not many, asphalts. But the investigations have not been sufficiently exact to sustain satisfactorily the conclusion. PARAFFIN GROUP. Wax-like in consistence ; white and translucent.

The peculiar inertness of the paraffins with regard to chemical combination is urged by Watts and Frankland as favoring the latter formula. Whichever the series, they are regarded as species of high atomic weight, n not being less than 28. The different species, varying in the value of n, vary also in boiling point, and other characters. Those here recognized have not been studied with that care which is demanded for full confidence in their stated composition, or in their purity as simple species. Paraffins occur in the Pennsylvania petroleum, a freezing mixture redu cing the temperature being sufficient to separate it in crystals. Also in the naphtha of the Caspian, in Rangoon tar, and many other liquid bitu mens. It is a result of the destructive distillation of peat, bituminous coal, lignite, coaly or bituminous shales, most viscid bitumens, wood-tar (from which it was first obtained by Reichenbach), and many other substances."], [787, "SIMPLE HYDROCARBONS. 731 The name is from the Latin parum, little, and affinis, alluding to the feeble affinity for other substances, or, in other words, its chemical indif ference. 778.

Obs.\u2014 -Constitutes about four-fifths of the Urpeth CoUiery ozocerite, and is separated from the latter through its solubility in cold ether. The crude wax, as found, was soft enough to be kneaded in the fingers ; had a greasy feel, and gave a greasy stain to paper ; was subtransparent ; of a brownish-yellow color by transmitted light, but yellowish-green and opalescent by reflected ; and had an odor slightly fatty, which was stronger when melted. It occurred in cavities near a fault in the coal measures, and part in the solid sandstone. Laurent obtained a variety of paraffin by the dry distiUation of the bituminous shale of Autun, which melted at 33\u00b0 C, was very soluble in ether and insoluble in alcohol, and which consisted of Carbon 85-745, hydrogen 14-200=99-945. It may be identical with the above. It is quite probable that the urpethite obtained by Johnston was not free from mixture with the second paraffin separated by him from the Urpeth mineral by means of boUing ether, which is here referred to ozocerite (p. 732) ; and such a mixture might account for the divergence of the melting point from that of Laurent's paraffin. Taking 33\u00b0 C. as the true melting point, the several paraffins here described, urpethite, hatchettite, ozocerite, Johnston's third from the Urpeth wax, and zietri sikite, have nearly a common difference in melting points of 13\u00b0\u2014 17\u00b0, the temperatures being respectively 33\u00b0, 46\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 73\u00b0 90\u00b0. The mean difference is about 14\u00b0 ; this would make the melting points 33\u00b0, 47\u00b0, 61\u00b0, 75\u00b0, 89\u00b0. 779. HATCHETTITE. Hatchetine (fr. Merthyr-Tydvil) Conybeare, Ann.

Charred and decomposed by concentrated and boUing sulphuric acid. No apparent change in boiling nitric acid. Conybeare (1. c, 1822) stated that the Merthyr-Tydvil hatcliettite \" melts in warm water under 170\u00b0 F, whereas true bitumen does not in boiling water ; \" and this loose remark is the only ground for the statement that 76-6\u00b0 C. is the melting point of one variety of the mineral. Obs.\u2014 From the crevices of iron-stone septaria, and often in geodes containing also quartz crystals, in the coal-measures near Merthyr-Tydvil in Glamorganshire (and, Johnston adds, in some of the midland counties of England) ; also in a bog on the borders of Loch Fyne in Argyleshire, Scotland. The latter has not yet been analyzed. Also reported from Rossitz in Moravia (Jahrb. G.

The mineral wax of Urpeth CoUiery, after the separation of what was soluble in cold ether (see Urpethite, p. 731), afforded Johnston (1. c.) another portion through its solubUity in boiling ether; and this is apparently identical with true ozocerite. While soluble in boUing ether it is sparingly so in boUing alcohol. As obtained from the ether solution it was yeUow, and had the consistence of soft wax. A kind from Boryslaw in Galicia, examined by Hofstadter (Ann. Ch. Pharm, xci. 326, 1854), resembled the preceding in its appearance, but was darker colored, being blackish-brown ; in thin pieces reddish-brown to leek-green by transmitted light; G=0'944; melting point 60\u00b0. By fractional crystallization it was separated into parts varying in fusibility from 60\u00b0 to 65\u00b0 5' C. That from Truscawitz, Galicia, examined by Walter (J. pr.

Hermann has described a wax-like mixture from seams in a rock in the vicinity of Lake Baikal which he caUs Baikeriie (J. pr. Ch, lxxiii. 230). About 60-18 p. c. of it was soluble in boiUng alcohol, 100 parts dissolving 1 ; and this portion appears to be ozocerite. It was tasteless and inodorous ; melting point 59\u00b0 C. ; G.=0'90. The rest (29*82 p. c.) of the baikerite consisted as foUows: 7*02 wax-like substance insoluble in alcohol; 32*41 viscid resiu; 0'39 earthy impuri ties. The same compound has been obtained from mineral coaL peat, and petroleum, mineral tar etc by destructive distillation. The following are examples : 1, Anderson (Rep. Brit. Assoc ' 1856, J. pr.

Comp., Var., etc. \u2014 The almost complete insolubttity of this fossU wax in ether distinguishes it decisively from ozocerite. 1. Magnus, who made the first examination of the fossil wax brought by v. Meyer from Slanik. Moldavia, appears to have had a different substance in hand from that examined by Glocker (by whom ozocerite was named) and by Schrotter, as he states that only a very little of it was dissolved by alcohol or ether, and the rest, after the action of these solvents, was eroded with holes, show ing the presence of insoluble and soluble constituents. The insoluble was soluble in ott of tur pentine, and of this part the melting point was 82\u00b0, aud the composition as given below. 2. The wax from Zietrisika, Moldavia, examined by Malaguti, is regarded by him as identical with that of Magnus. It waswliated, conchoidal in fracture, pearly in lustre, deep red-brown in color with a greenish reflectio_J*_u1t in very thin pieces brown, and a little harder than beeswax. It was very slightly soluble in alcohol or boiling ether, and very soluble in oil of turpentine and naphtha, with no action from alkaUes or cold sulphuric acid. It melts at 84\u00b0 C, and boils at above 300\u00b0. On subjecting it to boiling alcohol, a small portion was dissolved, whose melting point was 75\u00b0 ; by a second treatment another portion was obtained, having for the melting point 78\u00b0; and at the fourth, the portion dissolved was found to have the same melting point as that of the undissolved mass, which was 90\u00b0. This then, which he catts brown ozocerite, appears to be the point of fusion of the true zietrisikite, and this alone was analyzed ; as the rest, his yellow ozocerite, he says, \"est un melange, j'ai juge inutile d'en faire l'analyse.\" Analyses: 1, Magnus (L a); 2, 3, Malaguti (1. a): C H Melting T.

Hermann found 66 p. c. of a wax-like substance insoluble in alcohol and 18 p. c. of another soluble in alcohol, besides 13*33 p. c. of a resin. In ether a large part was insoluble ; and this portion may be identical with the zietrisikite, or the insoluble paraffin from the Urpeth wax (p. 731). 781C. Ptropissite Kenng., Ueb. 1850-'51, 148. Kenngott has thus named an earthy, friable, coaly substance, of grayish-brown color, and without lustre, and having G. = 0-493\u2014 0-522, which forms a layer 6 to 9 in. thick in brown coal at Weissenfels, near HaUe. It is a mixture of species instead of a mineral, and has not yet been properly investigated. A small part is soluble in alcohol, especially in boiling, and thjs, precipitated by adding water, is a wax-Uke substance, paraffin-Uke in aspect. But whether true paraffin, or whether an oxygenated wax, related to geocerite (a species derived from a simUar earthy brown coal from Gersterwitz, near Weissenfels), has not been ascertained. It melts easUy to a pitch-like mass, and hence the name, from np, fire, and trf___, pitch. It affords 62 p. c. of paraffin on dry distiUation. On the composition of the related Gersterwitz earthy coal, see pp. 757, 758; also, C. Karsten, ZS. G, ii. 71.

He thus leaves the constitution of elaterite in doubt. It appears to be partly a carbohydrogen near ozocerite, and partly an oxygenated insolu ble material. Mr. Henry, Jr., found 36 to 40 p. a of oxygen (J. de Ch. Medicate, L 18): but his results, as Johnston observes, are evidently untrustworthy. It is found at Castleton in Derbyshire, in the lead mine of Odin, along with lead ore and calcite, in compact reniform or fungoid masses, and is abundant.

The mineral occurs in the form of shining scales, flat crystals, and thin layers between the rings of growth and throughout the texture of pine wood (identical in species with the modern Pinus sylvestris) from peat beds in the vicinity of Redwitz, in the Fichtelgebirge, North Bavaria. The crystals described by Clark (f. 616) were obtained artificiaUy by means of ether and alcohoL An oily substance was extracted by Schrotter by means of ether from wood of the same peat bed which afforded the fichtelite ; and this solution yielded two substances, one of which was an ott, regarded by him as identical with fichtelite in ratio ; it gave on analysis, Carbon 88*58, hydrogen 11*34=99-42. The other substance was crystallized and contained oxygen. Tecorelin was obtained from pine trees of the same species in marshes near Holtegard in Den mark. The resin from the wood, first observed by Steenstrup, was found by Forchhammor, aster dissolving it in boiling alcohol to contain two substances crystallizing from the solution at differ ent temperatures. The tecoretin was the least soluble of the two, or that which crystallized out first (the other was his phyllorelin, see p. 737); its crystallization was monoclinic, and its fusing point 45\u00b0. From the analysis Clark writes the empirical formula OH2; but states that the mineral resembles fichteUte in every other respect. 785. HARTITE. Hartit Haid., Pogg, Uv. 261, 1841.

It is from the brown coal beds of Ober hart, near Gloggnitz, not far from Vienna. Reported also from Rosenthal near Koflach in Styria, and Pravali in Carinthia. It occurs among the layers or tissues of the wood, and also in clefts in the coal or lignite. Branchite is colorless and translucent, with G. = 1*0442, and comes from the brown coal of Mt.

According to BerzeUus (Lehrb, viii. 431, Pogg, xu. 419), it consists mainly (85 to 90 p. c.) of a resin which resists aU solvents (properly the species succinite), along with two other resins soluble in alcohol and ether, an oil, and 2-J to 6 p. c. of succinic acid. Schrotter and Forchhammer state that after removing these soluble ingredients, true succinite has the ratio 40 : 32 : 4, which is the ratio deduced from the analyses of the whole mass, and which indicates that the mixed resins are polymerous with succinite. Their nature has not been investigated. Amber is hardly acted on by alcohol. Burns readily with a yeUow flame, emitting an agreeable odor, and leaves a black, shining, car bonaceous residue. Obs. \u2014 Amber occurs abundantly on the Prussian coast of the Baltic ; occurring from Dantzig to Memel, especiaUy between Pttlau and Dorse Gross-Hubnicken. It occurs also on the coast of Denmark and Sweden; in Galicia, near Lemberg, and at Miszau; in Poland; in Moravia, at Boskowitz, etc. ; in the Urals, Russia ; near Christiania, Norway ; in Switzerland, near Bale ; in France, near Paris, in clay, in the department of the Lower Alps, with bituminous coal, also in the department of l'Aisne, de la Loire, du Gard, du Bas-Rhin. In England, near London, and on the coast of Norfolk, Essex, and Suffolk. It also occurs in various parts of Asia. Also near Catania, on the SiciUan coast, sometimes of a pecuUar blue tinge. It has been found in various parts of the Green sand formation of the United States, either loosely imbedded in the soil, or engaged in marl or lignite, as at Gay Head or Martha's Yine yard, near Trenton and also at Camden in New Jersey, and at Cape Sable, near Magothy river in Maryland. In the royal museum at Berlin there is a mass weighing 18 lbs. Another in the kingdom of Ava, India, is nearly as large as a chttd's head, and weighs 2-J- lbs. ; it is intersected by veins of carbonate of Ume, from the thickness of paper to one-twentieth of an inch. It is now fuUy ascertained that amber is a vegetable resin altered by fossUization. This is inferred both from its native situation with coal, or fossil wood, and from the occurrence of insects incased in it. Of these insects, some appear evidently to have struggled after being entangled in the then viscous fluid ; and occasionally a leg or wing is found some distance from the body, which had been detached in the effort to escape. Goppert has shown (Ber. Ak. Berlin, 1853, 450, Q. J. G. Soc, x. Am. J. Sci., II. xviu. 287) that at least 8 species of plants besides the Finites succinifer have afforded this fossttized resin, and he enumerates 163 species as represented by remains in amber. Besides pines, species of the famtty Abietine\u00e6 and Cupressine\u00e6 have prob ably contributed to it. Amber was early known to the ancients, and called uX_*. oo--, electrum, whence, on account ot its electrical susceptibilities, we have derived the word electricity. It was named by some lyncu rium, though this name was applied by Theophrastus also to a stone, probably to zircon or tour maUne, both minerals of remarkable electrical properties. _ PUny mentions, as one proposed derivation of electrum, the fable, as he regards it, that the sisters of Phaethon, changed into poplars, shed their tears on the banks of the Eridauus (or Padus), and that these tears were called electrum, from the fact that the sun was usually caUed elector; as another, that it comes from Electrides, the name of certain islands in the Adriatic; or another electrides, the name of certain stones in Britannia, from which it exudes. He gives it as his opinion that \" amber is an exudation from trees of the pine famtty, like gum from the cherry, and resin from the ordinary pine ; \" and, as proof that it was once Uquid, aUudes to the gnats, ete, in it. He observes that it had been long caUed succinum, because of this origin, \"quod arboris succum prisci nostri credidere.\" He says that in his time it was \" in request among women only.\" But 1;it had been so highly valued as an object of luxury that a very diminutive"], [797, "OXYGENATED HYDROCARBONS. 741 human effigy, made of amber, had been known to sell at a higher price than Uving men, even in stout and vigorous health.\" 799A. -_RA_rr__TE (FossUes Harz (fr.

Torbanite has H.=2*25 ; G.=1'18, Heddle ; color clove-brown; powder yellowish ; tough. Comp.\u2014 Ratio for O, H, O, from the analyses, 40 : 68 : 4, or near that of succinite, = Carbon 78-43, hydrogen 11*11, oxygen 10*46=100. The ratio 40 : 66 : 4 is less near, giving the percent age C 78-7, H 10-5, O 10-8 = 100. Analyses : 1, WiUiams (L c); IA, same with ash excluded; 2, MiUer ; 2A, same with ash excluded : 0 HO Ash 1.

Other analyses of torbanite give less oxygen. The oxygen includes a little nitrogen and sulphur. WiUiams makes the formula O30, H6003=Carbon 78-60, hydrogen 10'92, oxygen 10'48, agreeing hardly as well with the analyses as the above. Does not melt when heated. In a platinum crucible affords a fatty odor, and burns with a dense smoky flame. No action with moderately dilute nitric acid ; completely carbonized by con centrated sulphuric acid. Obs. \u2014 BathviUite occurs in the torbanite or Boghead coal (of the Carboniferous formation), adjoining the lands of Torbanehitt, in the grounds of Bathville, Scotland. It forms lumps which fill cavities in the torbanite. Other cavities are occupied by calcite, pyrite, etc. It may be an altered lump of resin ; or else material which has filtrated into the cavity from the surrounding torbanite. The analysis of Miller shows that some of the torbanite has the same composition. As proof of the absolute purity of the substances analyzed could not be had, the results are open to some doubt, as WiUiams observes. Yet the mode of occurrence of the bathvUUte, and the nearness in composition of this insoluble substance to the equally insoluble succinite, favors the view that it is essentially a good species, and that its composition is not far from that above given. 804. Torbanite. Torbanite, although related to cannel coaL has a very nearly uniform com position, according to all analyses thus far made, excepting that of Mttler, and this composition is like that of bathvillite, excepting less oxygen. It corresponds very nearly with the formula O\u2122 H\u00ab 8 O... 6= Carbon 82*19, hydrogen 11 -64, oxygen 6-17. The mean of five analyses (see p. 757) is, Carbon 81-15, hydrogen 11-48, with oxygen about 6-0, nitrogen 1-37 = 100 ; excluding the nitro gen, C 82-28, H 11-54, O 6-08=100. Taking the oxygen at 5\"40 instead of 6*0 (see anal, L a), the formula would become O40 H6a O.. The nitrogen is without doubt in combination with por tions of the other ingredients. But, allowing for this, the close relation to the amber group still holds, both as regards composition and insolubiUty. Less than 1-J P- c of torbanite is soluble in naphtha (Fyfe). Although the above formula cannot be taken as the formula of the species at the basis torbanite, it is probably not far from it. Torbanite may contain bathviUite as mixture. 805. XYLORETINITE.

The material of the layer is of loam-like aspect, but gives a shining wax-like streak, has G. = l-297, Wackenroder, and loses 22 p. c. of water at 100\u00b0 C. The dried mass is nearly half sand and other earthy materials. The leucopetrite is associated in the coaly layer, according to Bruckner, with other organic compounds, soluble in alcohol of 80 p. c, including two resins, two wax-like substances (p. 738), and an acid which Briickner calls Georetinic acid (p. 748). By a distiUation of the mass of the brown coal, 28 p. c of the whole passes over as a butter-Uke mass, which is related to the paraffins, but, according to Bruckner, contains 2 p. c. of oxygen. It afforded (f) Carbon 84-04, hydrogen 14-10, oxygen [1-86], and he writes the formula O5_H110O. It is soluble easily in hot absolute alcohol and ether, and very sparingly in alcohol of 80 p. c. ; crystals in pearly hexagonal plates from the alcohohc solution ; melts at 50\u00b0 C.

The existence of a sulphur-bearing resin like the above from Tasmania renders it probable that the New Zealand coal is impregnated with a similar insoluble resin ; 2*37 p. c. of sulphur would correspond to the presence of about 44 p. c. of such a resin. 818.

The insoluble portion has not been investigated. Hatchett found (L c.) vegetable resin 55, bitumen 41 (the insoluble part, which he regarded as asphalt, aud alludes to in the name retinasphalt), and earthy matter 3=99. A retinitefrom Halle afforded Bucholz (Schweig. J, i. 290, 1811) 91 parts soluble in absolute alcohol, and 9 parts insoluble. The former gives a yellcwish-brown deposit on dilution, and is more soluble in boiling dilute alcohol than in cold ; and it is insoluble in pure ether and turpen tine. The latter is also insoluble in ether. Both are soluble in alkaUes, which would seem to indicate that they are acid in their relations. The resin fuses with more difficulty than most resins, blackens in the heat, and gives out a strong aromatic odor. By distiUation yields a brown thick oil, some water containing a little acetic acid, besides carbonic acid and carburetted hydrogen. 826. DOPPLERITE. Dopplerit Haid., Ber. Ak.

Named after Bergrath Doppler, who was the first to bring the substance to notice. C. W. Giimbel has referred here (Jahrb. Min. 1858, 278) a substance from a peat-bed near Berchtesgaden. It is soft, plastic, elastic, black, of waxy lustre, tasteless ; on drying in the air it resembles compact coal, is brittle and velvet-black, and has H. = 2-5, G. = 1'439, lustre vitreous, with powder brownish-black. The air-dried material loses, at 80\u00b0 C, 12 p. c. of water. Unlike dopplerite, it burns with a bright yeUow flame, is partially soluble in alcohol, and the alcoholic solution affords a resin (Kenng. Ueb, 1858, 142). A pitch-black coal-like substance from the peat-beds at Kolbenmoor, near Berchtesgaden, the same that are described by Gumbel, related to dopplerite in composition, and in not burning with a flame when inserted in fragments in the flame of a candle, has been analyzed by C.

The ratio 48 : 40 : 16=12 : 10 : 4 affords the percentage C 661, H 4*6, O 29'3=100. The substance is regarded by Rochleder as an acid related to ulmic acid.

ASPHALTUM. \"Ac<pa\\ros Aristot, Strabo, Diosc, etc. Bitumen Plin., xxxv. 51. Asphalt, Mineral Pitch. Asphalt, Bergpech, Erdpech, Germ. Asphalte, Bitume, Fr. [For syn. of Pittasphalt or Mineral Tar (Bergtheer Germ.), see p. 728.] Asphaltum, or mineral pitch, is a mixture of different hydrocarbons, part of which are oxygenated. Its ordinary characters are as follows : Amorphous. G. = l \u2014 1-8; sometimes higher from impurities. Lustre like that of black pitch. Color brownish-black and black. Odor bitumi nous. Melts ordinarily at 90\u00b0 to 100\u00b0 O, and burns with a bright flame. Soluble mostly or wholly in oil of turpentine, and partly or wholly in ether ; commonly partly in alcohol. The more solid kinds graduate into the pittasphalts or mineral tar (p. 728), and through these there is a gradation to petroleum. The fluid kinds change into the solid by the loss ol a vaporizable portion on exposure, and also by a process of oxydation, which consists first in a loss of hydrogen, and finally in the oxygenation of a portion of the mass. Comp. \u2014 The action of heat, alcohol, ether, naphtha, and ott of turpentine, as well as direct analyses, show that the so-called asphaltum from different localities is very various in composi tion. Yet the true composition is not known of any one of them. It has been shown only that the foUowing are the classes of ingredients present : A. Oils vaporizable at about 100\u00b0 C, or below; sparingly present, if at all B. Heavy oils, probably of the PittoUum or Petrolene groups (pp. 728, 729); vaporizable between 100\u00b0 and 250\u00b0 C. ; constituting sometimes 85 p. c. of the mass. C. Resins soluble in alcohol. D. Solid asphalt-like substance or substances soluble in ether and not in alcohol; black, pitch-like, lustrous in fracture; 15 to 85 p. c. E. Black or brownish-black substance or substances not soluble either in alcohol or ether ; similar to D in color and appearance, Kersten ; brown and ulmin-like, Volckel ; 1 to 75 p. c. F. Nitrogenous substances ; often as much as corresponds to 1 or 2 p. c. of nitrogen. Boussingault attempted an investigation of the composition in 1837 (Ann. Ch. Phys, lxxiv. 141), and arrived at the conclusion that there were two principles present ; one petrolene, an oil, the other asphaltene, a soUd, and concluded that all asphalts were mixtures of these two in different proportions. But his petrolene, as already observed, is beyond question a mixture of oils ; and his asphallene needs much more investigation. His special examinations on this point were made only on the asphalt of Bechelbronn. Ho found in it (1) no light ott (or A), as nothing was given off at 100\u00b0 C. ; (2) 85'4p. c. of heavier oil, or his petrolene, vaporized between 100\u00b0 and 230\u00b0 C. (B); and (3) 14*6 p. c. of a black, lustrous, asphalt-like soUd, his asphaltene, soluble in ether, ott of turpentine, and fatty oils, but not in alcohol (D). Asphaltene was the solid sub- Btance after subjecting the asphaltum to a temperature of 250\u00b0 C. in a hot oil-bath. (Boussingault has been quoted by Berzelius, Kersten, Rammelsberg, and others, as making the asphaltene not soluble in ether, but he expressly mentions its solubttity. He also states earUer that the mass of the asphalt was wholly soluble in ether ; and, also, that he used ether to separate it from the impurities present, after which kind of purification it burnt without residue.) Boussingault's analysis of asphaltene afforded : Carbon 750 Hydrogen 9*9 Oxygen 14*8=99*7 ; giving the ratio for \u20ac, H, 0=40 : 64 : 6. He closes the paper with his analysis of an asphalt (the mass) from Caxitambo, as follows : 0 75*0 H95 0 15*5=100; and remarks on the near approach of this alphalt in composition to asphaltene. But m 1840 (L c Ixxiii 444) he gives two new analyses of the Caxitambo asphalt, m which he obtamed only 1-65'of oxygen and nitrogen (see anaL 7, below); and adds that \"his eaxUer analysis was made"], [808, "752 HTDEOCAEBON COMPOUNDS. by the method ordinarUy foUowed at that time, by which method he was never able to obtain more than 76 p. c. of carbon.\" The remark virtuatty concedes the inaccuracy of the analysis also of asphaltene, or at least gives sufficient occasion for a very large doubt. No special mention is made in this second paper osthe asphalt of Bechelbronn, but analyses are given of petrolene from the locality. .... Nendtvich, in an investigation of an asphalt from Peklenicza, Austria, found it to consist almost solely oi asphaltene, that is, it was soluble in ether and not in alcohol; and in 1843( Jahrb. G. Reichs, vii. 743) obtained for it nearly the composition of asphaltene (or C 72*4o, H 11-07, 0 16-48); but in 1847 (Haid. Ber, iU. 271) he rejects his earUer results, and states that the mineral contained no oxygen, and was essentiaUy identical in composition with petrolene, as stated Other analysts have not afforded more satisfactory results. Part have been contented with analyses of the undivided mass ; while others have ascertained the portions soluble in different menstrua, without ascertaining the constituents of the substances obtained. The foUowing table contains the proportions of the ingredients A, B, C, D, E, above, m a few asphalts. The letters E and A, in connection with the statement of the solubility, stand for ether and alcohol. 1, Boussingault (1. a); 2, Kersten (J. pr. Ch, xxxv. 271) ; 3, 4, Vblckel (Ann. Ch.

But these are generally, if not always, connected with rock deposits containing some kind of bituminous material or vegetable remains (see p. 725). Some of the noted locaUties of asphaltum are the region of the Dead Sea, or Lake Asphaltites, whence the most of the asphaltum of ancient writers ; a lake on Trinidad, 1| m. in circuit, which is hot at the centre, but is solid and cold toward the shores, and has its borders over a breadth of 4 m. covered with the hardened pitch with trees flourishing over it; and about Point La Braye, the masses of pitch look Uke black rocks among the foliage ; at various places in S. America, similar lakes, as at Caxitambo (not Coxitambo), Peru, which is used at Payta, on the coast (under the equator), for pitching boats, etc. ; at Berengela, Peru, not far from Arica (S.), where it is put to the same use ; in California, near the coast of St. Barbara, an area of some acres; in a large bed, near Avlona in Albania (G.=l-205).

On evaporation the resin obtained has a clear red color, and remains soft and viscid at the ordinary temperature. Nearly insoluble in caustic potash. Odor resinous, disagreeable ; but after fusion for some time at 100\u00b0 0, this odor is succeeded by an agreeable one ; on cooling it regains the original odor. It is said to form a lake like that of Trinidad, in the province of St. Juan de Berengela, about 100 m. from Arica, Peru, aud is used at Arica for paying boats aud vessels. 831. MINERAL COAL.

Anthracite (Anthracit Karst, Tab, 58, 96, 1808. Glanzkohle Germ.). H.=2 \u2014 2-5. G.= 1-32\u20141-7, Pennsylvania; 1-81, Rhode Island; P26\u2014 P36, South Wales. Lustre bright, often -submetallic, iron-black, and frequently iridescent. Fracture conchoidal Volatile matter after drying 3 to 6 p. c. Burns with a feeble flame of a pale color. The anthracites of Pennsylvania contain ordinarily 85 to 93 per cent, of carbon ; those of South Wales, 88 to 95 ; of France, 80 to 83 ; of Saxony, 81 ; of southern Russia, sometimes 94 per cent. Anthracite graduates into bituminous coaL becoming less hard and containing more volatile matter ; and an intermediate variety is caUed free-burning anthracite. 2. Native Coke. More compact than artificial coke, and some varieties afford considerable bitu- men. From the Edgehill mines, near Richmond, Va, according to Genth, who attributes its ori- gin to the action of a trap eruption on bituminous coaL Bituminous Coals (Schwarzkohle Hausm., Handb, 73, 1813. Steinkohle pt. Germ.). Under the head of Bituminous Coals, a number of kinds are included which differ strikingly in the action of heat, and which therefore are of unlike constitution. They have the common characteristic of burning in the fire with a yellow, smoky flame, and giving out on distiUation hydrocarbon oils or tar, and hence the name bituminous. The ordinary bituminous coals contain from 5 to 15 p. c. (rarely 16 or 17) of oxygen (ash excluded); while the so-called brown coal or lignite eon- tains from 20 to 36 p. c, after the expulsion, at 100\u00b0 C, of 15 to 36 p. c. of water. The amount of hydrogen in each is from 4 to 7 p. c. Both have usuaUy a bright, pitchy, greasy lustre .(whence often caUed Pechkohle in German), a firm compact texture, are rather fragile compared with anthracite, aud have G. = l-14\u2014 1-40. The brown coals have often a brownish-black color, whence the name, and more oxygen, but iu these respects and others they shade into ordinary bituminous coals. The ordinary bituminous coal of PennsylvaniahasG. = l-26\u2014 1-37; ofNewcastle Eno-land P27; of Scotland, 1-27\u20141-32; of France, 12\u2014 1*33; of Belgium, 1-27\u2014 13. The most prominent kinds are the following: 3. Caking Coal. A bituminous coal which softens and becomes pasty or semi-viscid in the fire. This softening takes place at the temperature of incipient decomposition, and is attended with the escape of bubbles of gas. On increasing the heat, the volatUe products which result from the ultimate decomposition of the softened mass are driven off, and a coherent, grayish-black cellular, or lotted mass (coke) is left. Amount of coke left (or part not volatUe) varies from 50 to 85 p c. A caking eoal wiU lose its caking quaUty ff kept heated for 2 or 3 hours at 300\u00b0 C , and sometimes on mere exposure for a time to the air."], [811, "MINEEAL COAL. 755 4. Non-Caking Coal. Like the preceding in all external characters, and often in ultimate composition ; but burning freely without softening or any appearance of incipient fusion Per- centage of volatile matter same as for caking coal, but the coke is not a proper coke bein<* in now- der, or of the form of the original coaL There are all gradations between caking and non-caking bituminous coals. In external char- acters the two kinds are alike. They often break into layers : and there is besides a horizontal banding arising from a succession of very thin non-separable layers, slightly differing in lnstre or shade of color. Cherry coal or soft coal (of England) is a non-caking coal igniting well and burn- ing rapidly, while splint or hard coal ignites less readily, burns less rapidly, owing to the smaller amount of volatile matter. Coals which do not cake on burning are called free-burning coals whUe the caking are caUed binding coals. 5. Cannel Coal (Parrot Coal). A variety of bituminous coal and often caking; but differing from the preceding in texture, and to some extent in composition, as shown by its products on distillation. It is compact, with little or no lustre, and without any appearance of a banded structure ; and it breaks with a conchoidal fracture and smooth surfaces ; color duU black or grayish-black. On distillation it affords, aster drying, 40 to 66 of volatile matter, and the material volatilized includes a large proportion of burning and lubricating oils, much larger than the above kinds of bituminous coal ; whence it is extensively used for the manufacture of such oUs. It graduates into oil-producing coaly shales, the more compact of which it much resembles. The original Parrot coal is a cannel from near Edinburgh, which burns with a crackling noise, whence the name (Percy) ; and Horn coal, a kind from South Wales, which emits when burning something of the odor of burning horn. 6. Torbanite. A variety of cannel coal of a dark brown color, yellowish streak, without lustre, having a subconchoidal fracture ; H=2-25 -f G.'=117 \u2014 1 -2. Yields over 60 p. c. of volatile mat- ter, and is used for the production of burning and lubricating oils, paraffin, illuminating gas. Named from the locattty at Torbane Hitt, near Bathgate in Linlithgowshire, Scotland. Also caUed Boghead Cannel (see p. 742). 7. Brown Coal (Braunkohle Germ., Pechkohle pt. Germ., Lignite). The prominent character- istics of brown coal have already been mentioned. They are non-caking, but afford a large proportion of volatile matter. They are sometimes pitch-black (whence Pechkohle pt. Germ.), but often rather dull and brownish-black. G.=l*15 \u2014 1*3; sometimes higher from impurities. It is occasionally somewhat lamellar in structure. Brown coal is often caUed lignite. But this term is sometimes restricted to masses of coal which still retain the form of the original wood. Jet is a black variety of brown coal, compact in texture, and taking a good polish, whence its use in jewelry. 8. Earthy Brown Coal (Erdige Braunkohle) is a brown friable material sometimes forming layers in beds of brown coal. But it is in general not a true coaL a considerable part of it being soluble in ether and benzole, and often even in alcohol ; besides affording largely of oils and paraffin on distiUation. For a notice of \" coal \" of this kind see under Leucopetrite, p. 743. Such a coal is sometimes caUed wax coal and paraffin coal (Waehskohle, Paraffinkohle, Germ. ). See also Bathvillite, p. 742. 9. Mineral Charcoal. Fibrous charcoal-like substance often found covering the surfaces between layers of coal, and observed in coal of all ages. It is soft, and soils the fingers like charcoal One variety of it is a dry powder. Comp. \u2014 Most mineral coal consists mainly, as the best chemists now hold, of oxygenated hydro- carbons. On page 742 it is shown that the kind of cannel coal called torbanite and the sub- stance bathvillite are closely related in composition, as well as insolubility, to the species of the Succinite group ; and it is probable that other cannel coals contain this or some related compound ; and that oil-producing (not oU-bearing) shales include a similar kind of hydrocarbon. The ordinary bituminous coals often have 10 to 15 p. c. of oxygen, and may be of analogous composition, though differing much in the precise constitution us these hydrocarbons, some containing such as produce a pasty fusion or incipient decomposition when heated (caking), and others such as undergo no semi-fusion (non-caking). The brown coals, in which there are 20 to 35 p. c. of oxygen, must include other kinds of oxygenated hydrocarbons, of the insoluble kinds. But microscopic exam- inations appear to show that woody fibre is present in it in various stages of alteration. Besides oxygenated hydrocarbons, there may also be present simple hydrocarbons (that is, con- taining no oxygen). This would seem to fottow from the small percentage of oxygen (2\u20143 p. c. ) in the Tyneside cannel, while the hydrogen is as large in amount as in any cannel or bituminous coals. And there are various bituminous coals, low in oxygen, that suggest the same conclusion. At pres- ent, however, chemistry knows of no simple hydrocarbons that are insoluble in naphtha and benzole. The presence of free carbon is naturaUy inferred from the composition of coals like the anthra cites which afford very little volatUe matter. But even these coals contain ordinarUy 15 to 2*5 p c of each oxygen and hydrogen ; and Berthelot holds- that they are hydrocarbon compounds like other coals. It is remarkable that in one of the analyses of anthracite from Piesberg, Han over (anaL 4), no oxygen whatever was found, while there were 2-23 p. a of hydrogen."], [812, "756 HYDE0CAEB0N COMPOUNDS. The portion of coal soluble in naphtha or benzole, although small in amount, indicates the pie sence of other hydrooarbons\u2014 simple or oxygenated\u2014 oUs or resins. Their nature remains to be ascertained. Fyfe obtamed by means of naphtha, from the Torbane mineral, 1*2 and 1-4 p. c; from cannel coal, 2\u2014 4 p. c. ; and from Newcastle caking, in three experiments, i% 5-8, 9-8 p. c. of soluble material These results do not accord with the ordinary statements with regard to the insolubility of coal, and the subject needs far more extended study. Under microscopic examination, when in thin slices, many bituminous coals (including most cannel coals, the gas coals of Nova Scotia, Pelton, etc.) are seen to consist of three kinds of material, as first observed by Hutton (GeoL Soc. London, 1832-33), and further more particularly by Dr. Aitken of Glasgow (Ronalds & Richardson, Chem. Techn, L 778). (1) An opaque black substance, which is insoluble in acids as well as other menstrua, and, as suggested, may be free carbon (?). ' It is stated to be the mam constituent of anthracite. (2) A yellow or reddish resin-like substance, which is translucent or transparent, volatile by heat, and insoluble in naphtha, muriatic and nitric acids. (3) Earthy matter, which is more or less soluble in water, and is earthy impurity. The resin Uke material, No. 2, may wett be a species of the Succinite group (see above). In many pitchy bituminous coals it is impossible to make out the structure here described, on account of their opacity. Some Nova Scotia coal contains yellow matter, which is soluble in ether, and slightly so in turpentine and nitric acid ; and the same is true of that of the Pelton coal. Many brown coals, as the Bovey, show the structure above described. Coals often contain resins disseminated in visible points through the mass, which may or may not be of soluble kinds. Sulphur is present in nearly aU coals. It is supposed to be usually combined with iron, and when the coal affords a red ash on burning, there is reason for beUeving this true. But Percy mentions a coal from New Zealand (anal. 18) which gave a peculiarly white ash, although containing 2 to 3 p. c. of sulphur, a fact showing that it is present not as a sulphid of iron, but as a constituent of an organic compound. The discovery by Church of a resin containing sul phur (see Tasmanite, p. 746), gives reason for inferring that it may exist in this coal in that state, although its presence as a constituent of other organic compounds is quite possible. The presence ot nitrogen, sometimes 2 p. c, proves the presence of nitrogenous hydrocarbons; but of what nature is unknown. The above review of the composition of coal shows that as yet very Uttle is known as to its actual constituents ; and that no analyses to determine them can be satisfactory which are not carried forward by the aid of the microscope, and by the preparatory separation of the coal into parts, as far as possible, by different menstrua, and the separate analyses of these part3. The impurities present, which constitute the ash of the coal, consist of sUica or quartz, oxyd of iron, clay, and other aluminous siUcates, or such ingredients as make up the mud and clay of fine soil or alluvium ; also some silica, potash, and soda, derived from the original vegetation. The ash in the purest mineral coal amounts to but 0'25 to 1 p. c. ; but in that which passes for the best there are ordinarily 5 to 8 p. c. ; and in most that is used for fuel there are 8 to 15 p. c.

In the United States, the anthracites occur east of the AUeghany range, in rocks that have undergone great contortions and fracturings, while the bituminous are found farther west, in rocks that have been less disturbed ; and this fact and other observations have led some geologists to the view that the anthracites have lost their bitumen by the action of heat. For observations on the geological relations of coal beds, reference may be made to geological treatises. The origin of coal is mainly vegetable, though animal life has contributed somewhat to the result. The beds were once beds of vegetation, analogous, in most respects, in mode of formation to the peat beds of modern times, yet in mode of burial often of a very different character. This vegetable origin is proved not only by the occurrence of the leaves, stems, and logs of plants in the coal but also by the presence throughout its texture, in many cases, of the forms of the original fibres ; also by the direct observation that peat is a transition state between unaltered vegetable debris and brown coal being sometimes found passing completely into true brown coal. Peat^ differs from true coal in want of homogeneity, it visibly containing vegetable fibres only partially altered ; and wherever changed to a fine-textured homogeneous material, even though hardly consoUdated, it may be true brown coal. The derivation of coal from woody fibre has been explained in a general way on page 754. From the statements there made it is obvious that the vegetable material, in changing to ordinary mineral coal, has not passed necessartty through the stage of brown coaL When the material"], [815, "759 MINEEAL OOAL. was long steeped in water, and buried under fine mud so as to exclude almost entirely atmospheric air, the decomposition in progress may have carried off most of the oxygen by its combination with the carbon osthe plants, to form carbonic acid. Thus it happened probably with the cannel coals, as explained by Newberry, and also, though in general less perfectly, with most of the best bituminous coals. But when the bed had as free access to the air as occurs in the case of peat beds, there would have been a loss of carbon and hydrogen as marsh-gas, and also, probably, through combination with external oxygen, forming carbonic acid and water, whUe a large part of the oxygen would remain. Between these extremes, of excluded air and very imperfectly excluded, and of pressure from heavy superincumbent earthy beds and Uttle or no pressure, Ue the condi tions which attended the origin of the various kinds of coal, and determined, in connection with the nature of the vegetation itself, the transformations in progress. Extensive beds of mineral coal occur in Great Britain, covering about -r\\,- the whole area, or 11,859 square miles; in France about Tjhr, or 1719 sq. m. ; in Spain about fa, or 3408 sq. m. ; in Belgium _-, or 518 sq. m. ; in Netherlands, Prussia, Bavaria, Austria, northern Italy, Silesia, Spain, Russia on the south near the Azof, and also iu the Altai. It is found in Asia, abundantly in China, in Persia in the Cabul territory, and in the Khorassan or northern Persia, in Hindos tan, north of the Gulf of Cutch, in the province of Bengal (the Burdwan coal field) and Upper Assam, in Borneo, Labuan, Sumatra, several of the PhiUppines, Formosa, Japan, New South Wales and other parts of AustraUa, New Zealand, Kerguelen's Land ; in America, besides the United States, in Chtti, at the Straits of Magellan, northwest Ame/ica on Vancouver's Island near the harbor of Camosack, at BeUiugham Bay in Puget's Sound, at MelviUe Island in the Arctic seas, and in the British Provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Newfound land. In the United States there are four separate coal areas. One of these areas, the Appalachian coal field, commences on the north, in Pennsylvania and southeastern Ohio, and sweeping south over western Virginia aud eastern Kentucky and Teunessee to the west of the Appalachians, or partly involved in their ridges, it continues to Alabama near Tuscaloosa, where a bed of coal has been opened. It has been estimated to cover 60,000 sq. m. It embraces several isolated patches in the eastern half of Pennsylvania. The whole surface in Pennsylvania has been estimated at 15,437 sq. m, or i the whole area of the State. A second coal area (the Illinois) Ues adjoining the Mississippi, and covers the larger part of lUinois, though much broken into patches, and a small northwest part of Kentucky ; it is continued westward over a portion of Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, Arkansas, and northern Texas west osthe Mississippi. The latter area is divided along the Mississippi by a narrow belt of SUurian rock ; the whole area is about the same with that of the Appalachian coal field. A third covers the central portion of Michigan, not far from 5000 sq. m. in area. Besides these, there is a smaller coal region (a fourth) in Rhode Island, which crops out across the north end of the island of Rhode Island, and appears to the northward as far as Mansfield, Massachusetts. The total area of coal measures in the United States is about 125,0u0 sq. m. Out of the borders of the United States, on the northeast, commences a fifth coal area, that of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, which covers, in connection with that of Newfoundland, 18,000 sq. m, or 5 the whole area of these provinces. The mines of western Pennsylvania commencing with those of the Blossburg basin, Tioga Co, those osthe States west, and those of Cumberland or Frostburg, Maryland, Richmond or Ches- terfield, Va, and other mines south, are bituminous. Those of eastern Pennsylvania constituting several detached areas \u2014 one, the Schuylkill coal field, on the south, worked principaUy at Mauch Chunk on the Lehigh, and at Pottsvitte on the SchuylkiU \u2014 another, the Wyoming coal field, worked at Carbondale, in the Lackawanna region, and near Wyoming, besides others interme- diate \u2014 those of Rhode Island and Massachusetts, and some patches in Virginia, are anthracites. Cannel coal is found near Greensburg, Beaver Co, Pa, iu Kenawha Co, Va, at Peytona, etc.; also in Kentucky, Ohio, Illinois, Missouri, and Indiana; but part osthe so-called cannel is a coaly shale. In England, the principal coal fields are the Manchester of Lancashire and Cheshire ; the Great Central of South Yorkshire, Nottingham, and Derby ; that of South Wales, Glamorgan- shire, etc. ; the Newcastle field of northern England. In Scotland, a range of beds extends across from the Firth of Forth to the Firth of Clyde ; whole area 1650 sq. m. In Ireland, the three are the Limerick fields about the mouth of the Shannon, the KUkenny fields to the east- ward, and that of Ulster on the north. Cannel coal occurs iu Great Britain at Lesmahago in. Lanarkshire, about 20 m. from Glasgow ; also near Wigan in Lancashire, and West Wemyss in. Fyfe. Mineral coal occurs in France, in smaU basins, 88 in number, and covering in aU, according to Taylor -LT of the whole surface. The most important are the basin of the Loire, between the Loire and the Rhone, and that of Valenciennes on the north, adjoining Belgium. In Belgium, it occupies a western and eastern division, the western in the provinces of Namur and Hainault, and the eastern extending over Liege."], [816, "760 HYDEOCAEBON COMPOUNDS. Brown coal comes from coal beds more recent than those of the Carboniferous age. But much of this more recent coal is not distinguishable from other bituminous coals. The coal of Rich mond, Virginia, is supposed to be of the Liassic or Triassic era; the coal of Brora, in Sutherland, and of Bovey, Yorkshire, is Oolitic in age. Tertiary coal occurs on the CowUtz. in Oregon (anal. 14), and in many places over the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains, where a \" Lig nitic formation \" is very widely distributed ; but it is rarely in beds of economical importance. The coal known to the Greeks and Romans was probably brown coal. The first sentence, in the synonymy, from Aristotle evidently alludes to mineral coal of some kind ; and the first of the two cited from Theophrastus (a favorite pupil of Aristotle) refers to a similar substance, and per haps the same specimens. The locality of the latter, Liguria (or northwestern Italy along the Mediterranean), where, ho adds, there also is amber, may be taken with some freedom, as articles brought by vessels trading with Ligurian ports, even though coming from French ports beyond, might be referred to Liguria. Elis, on the way to Olympias, is given as another locality. The sentence ends with the statement that \" these coals are used by the smiths,\" showing that the value of the substance as fuel was wett understood at the time (4th century B.C.). Theophrastus says further, that it will continue to burn as long as any one blows it, but on stopping it deadens, but may be made to burn again ; and that it burns with a strong disagreeable odor. The second cita tion from each, Aristotle and Theophrastus, relates to a simUar coal. The locaUty, in Thrace, identifies it with the Thracian stone of Dioscorides and PUny, the locality of which, according to the former (from AristotieJ, was at Sintia, on the river Pontus (on the Macedonian border of Thracia, to the west of the present Constantinople). According to Dioscorides and PUny (quot ing further in part from Aristotle's \" Wonderful Things heard of\"), water would make the Thra cian stone to burn, and ott extinguish it ; which is either altogether a fable, or a partial truth based on somebody's observation that masses or piles of impure pyritiferous coal wiU become hot, and sometimes ignited, in consequence of being wet. Aristotle mentions its bituminous odor when burning. The Gagates (whence our word jet) occurred, according to Dioscorides and Pliny, at Gagas or Gages, a place in Lycia (Asia Minor). The former describes it as black, smooth, and combustible, to which PUny adds, that it was Ught, and looked much like wood, and that it emitted a disagree able odor when rubbed, and burned with the smeU of sulphur. It was, in part at least, true lig nite. Lignite is common in Syria, in the rocks of Mt. Lebanon, as near Beirut; and beds of coal have been recently opened in Asia Minor.

The cavities are mostly microscopic, but occasionally i in. across, or even larger. They are gen erally arranged in layers, and are sometimes counted by thousands in a single crystaL Brewster counted 30,000 in a chrysoberyl j in. square. The strata run irregularly with reference to the symmetry of the crystal, often intersect one another, and are sometimes curved ; it is rare that 3 or 4 strata are parallel. The very low refracting power, less than that of water, is a remarka ble character osthe fluid (the refraction index of water being D336 ; of alcohol D361 ; of ether 1-358). The fluid from a quartz crystal from Quebec, which exploded with much force when heated, had a disagreeable taste. In his original memoir Brewster states that the fluid was 32 times more expansible than water, but in the later reference to it in 1863 (Phil. Mag, 1. c.) makes it 21 times. _ The lower index of refraction, 11311, obtained for the fluid of a topaz, is so much below the other, 1-2106, that it may indicate a distinct species. 834.

Obs. \u2014 Pyrrhite was found by von Perovski of St. Petersburg at Alabaschka, near Mursinsk in the Ural, where it occurs in drusy feldspar cavities, containing also lepidolite, albite, and topaz.

According to chemical and blowpipe trials by A. A. Hayes (Am. J. Sci., II. ix. 423) on speci- mens furnished him by Mr. Teschemacher, these crystals consist of columbate of zirconia, colored apparently by oxyds of iron, uranium, and manganese. B.B. in the forceps, on tbe first impulse of the heat, becomes darker, and the fine orange color returns on cooling, even if the heat has been high ; at the melting point of cast iron, in the reduction flame, the flame becomes permanently darker and brown. With borax (6 parts to 1 of assay) it dissolves, and affords a clear colorless glass, which becomes instantly fpaj.1116 or opaque on flaming ; transferred to the oxydating flame becomes opaque. With salt of phos- phorus (in the same proportion) in the inner flame gives a clear glass, and when reduced the glass is green ; but in the outer becomes yellow. With a Uttle more of assay the glass remains clear. With soda (12 parts to 1 of assay) dissolves; some clear portions are seen in the globule whUe hot, but on cooling opacity precedes the crystallization of the globule; finally a gray-brown slag remains, which, cooled from the outer flame, has a green color, indicating oxyd of manganese. Decomposed by much soda, and the resulting mass, heated with nitric acid, gives a heavy white, insoluble powder, which with boUing water takes a white flocculent form; the powder exhibited all the characters of columbic acid (?). The acid solution, when mixed with carbonate of ammonia, remains clear ; heated, some oxyd of iron falls, and the fluid is Ught"], [820, "764 UNCLASSIFIED SPECIES. yeUow ; with oxalic acid, a white earth separates, which, heated with sulphuric acid to destroy the oxalic acid, dissolves, and the fluid forms with potash, before complete neutralization, a white double salt, which has the characters of that from zirconia, but may also contain oxyd of cerium. The oxalate, when first formed, did not afford, when heated, the cinnamon-brown color characteristic of deutoxyd of cerium. The extremely smaU amount of the mineral under' examination forbids the expression of certainty respecting the base. Although inclining to the opinion osthe existence of cerium in the mineral from the red color of the crystals, Mr. Hayes observes that he obtained no positive proof on this point. 834. ALHRG1TE.

Mean of four closely agreeing analyses by Marignac (Bib Univ Geneve, Aug. 25, 1867, p. 286) : Cb, ti Sn th Ce La, Di Y Fe Ca ign. 51*45 0*18 15*75 1849 5-60 1*12 3*17 2-75 1-07=99-58. G.=5-23. The amount of metaUic acids varied between 51-15 and 51-75. Analyses of tho metaUic acid gave the relation, Cb 29-31, ti 22-14, differing materially from Hermann's results. Marignac, having previously examined the acids of euxenite (see p. 522), concludes that the rela tion between the metaUic acids is the same as ip \u00e6schynite, and that these two minerals differ mainly in the character of the bases they contain ; and that both may be represented by the general formula 5 R ti+ 2 R- Ob. Agnesite. Carbonate of Bismuth W. Macgregor, Sowerby's Enghsh Min, Beud., Tr, ii. 375, 1832; Agnesite B. & M. Min, 591, 1852. An earthy steatite-like mineral from St. Agnes in Corn waU, having G.=4-31, made by Macgregor to consist of C 51-3, Bi 28-8, Ee 2-1, _il 7-5, gi 6-7, fl 3 6=100 ; which result is pronounced by Beudant as probably \" quelque grande erreur,\" and so proved by Thomson (Min, ii. 594), who states, after personal trials, that it did \" not effervesce with acids, and contained only a trace of bismuth \" ; and also by Greg and Lettsom, who examined a specimen in the late Mr. Allan's coUection, from Mr. Macgregor, with the same result as to effer vescence, and say that it may be an impure bismuth ochre. Allan appears to have thought it unworthy of a place in his edition of Phillips' Mineralogy (1837), and does not even allude to it under bismuth ochre. Altaite (48, p. 44). This rare species has been identified at the Stanislaus mine, Cal, and F. A. Genth has also observed it in minute quantities associated with petzito at the Golden Rule mine, Cal (Am. J. ScL, II. xiv. 311). The mineral from the former locality is tin- white, with a yel lowish tinge, tarnishing to bronze-yellow; streak gray; with H. =3, and has a distinctly cubic deavage. Composition, after deducting in 1, 1'03 p. c, and in 2, 196 of quartz : 1. Te 37-31 Pb 60-71 Ag 1*17 Au 0*26=99-45. 2. [37-00] 47-84 1P30 3-86=100-00. No. 1 is the first complete analysis of this species, and confirms the assumption of Rose that it is a compound analogous to hessite. Dr. Genth calculates No. 1 to contain 99-25 p. c. of altaite and 2-20 of hessite ; and No. 2, 77-42 altaite, and 23-11 p. c. hessite. An earner result on another specimen obtained by Genth, after separating carbonates and excluding 8 p. c. free gold, and 3-45 quartz gave Te (37-14), Ag 44-49, Pb 18-37 = 10000. This may represent 70-85 hessite, and 29-26 altaite' The material appeared to be pure, but Genth states that further investigation is needed to ascertain whether there is a teUurid of silver, or tellurid of silver and lead, which has a white color and cubic cleavage.

Tankite is referred to anorthite on p. 337, on the authority of Descloi zeaux, who has found them to have the same forms of crystals and angles (Mem. Soc. Min. St. Pet, II. ii. 1867). Descloizeaux also pubttshes (L c.) the foUowing analyses of tankite by Pisani: gi 42-49, Si 34-70 \u00a5e Oil, Mg 0-30, Ca 15-82, Na, Li 1-60, K 0-63, fl, F 4-80=101-08 ; whence the oxygen ratio, R, R, Si, 1 : 3 : 4. The mineral is from the iron mines of Arendal, Norway, where it was originally obtained by Mr. Tank. Anorthite crystals from the Juvenas meteorite have been measured by v. Lang (Pogg, cxxxitt. 188). Arsenopyrite (94, p. 78). Von Zepharovich has measured crystals of this species, with the foUowing results (Ber. Ak.

The following are additional observations on this species: Artif. \u2014 Field has shown (PhiL Mag, IV. xxiv. 123) that when an alkaline hypochlorite is added to a boUing solution of the sulphate, nitrate, or chlorid of copper, the latter being in excess, the precipitate produced has the formula 3 Cufl+Cu Clfl. The same is formed when potash is added to an excess of chlorid of copper. If, in the first case given above, the time of ebulUtion is too short, the precipitate has the composition 3 Cu fl + Cu Cl fl + 2 aq. Field's analysis gave Cu 49-85, Cu Cl 2802, fl 22*13, agreeing very closely, as he observed, with that of Berthier (anal. 1) from Cobija, Bolivia, The formula requires Cu 49-56, CuCl 28-01, fl 22-43=100. This is also the composition of botaUackite. Field states also that atacamite is formed in ChiU at a seashore locality by the action of salt in the sott on chalcopyrite. Debray finds that crystals may be obtained by heating to 200\u00b0 C, Cu3N with a concentrated solution of common salt; or to 100\u00b0 C, ammoniacal sulphate of copper with the same. Babingtonite (242, p. 227). The small, black, brittiant crystals from Athol referred to babing tonite by Shepard (p. 228), do not afford very nearly the angles of that species. They are usually implanted on green epidote, and, although black, they appear, 617 under a glass, to pass so gradually into the underlying mineral that the first impression is naturally that they are only a black variety of epidote. Yet they differ also from this species in angle. The author has attempted to make new measurements, but the crystals for the purpose were so minute (fa of an inch in length) that they require further study for satisfactory results. The author's figure and \" approximate measurements \" from the last edition of this work are consequently here added without modification, or even the change in the lettering that is required to bring the figure into parallelism with the figures of babingtonite.

The author learns further from L. Lesquereux (March 4, 1868) that, as existing species of the famiUes Populus, Myrica, and Laurus are wax-bearing, wax may have been afforded to the Gesterwitz beds by the species, now fossU in that basin, Cinnamomum Rossmass leri Heer, Gautiera lignitum Web, Laurus primigenia and _.. Lalages Heer, and species of Sassa fras ; and, as Ceratopetalum myricinum of de la Harpe is probably a Myrica, this also may have been one of the wax-yielding species of the era. And although no Populus has yet been identified from the basin, species are common in the Tertiary of other parts of Europe and of America, and plants of the genus probably contributed largely towards these lignitic beds.

Au analysis afforded Te 73-43, Ag 4-08, Pb 0-72, Ni 20 98 = 99-_1; the nickel contained a minute trace of cobalt. B.B. in the open tube gives a subUmate fusing to colorless drops, leaving a gray mass ; on charcoal burns with a bluish flame, giving a white volatile coating, and a greenish-gray residue ; in R.F. with soda a gray powder of magnetic metallic nickel. Soluble in nitric acid, giving a green color, and on evapora tion yielding a white crystalline powder of tellurous acid. Genth considers the analysis lo correspond to 6-ti0 p. c. hessite, 117 altaite, 2 29 native tel lurium, aud 89-25 meionite, which he assumes to have the composition Ni2 Te3, although he observes that the hexagonal form would better agree with the formula Ni Te. But the latter view would require that over one-third of the mixture should be native tellurium, which he thinks scarcely probable, as the material for analysis, when examined by a strong magnifier, showed a smaU quantity of dark colored hessite, but every other particle had a reddish hue, without the slightest admixture apparently of any grayish-white mineral. Menaccanite (181, p. 143). A variety of this species, from the basalt of Turner's HiU quarry, Staffordshire, gave D. Forbes (Phil.

It is a whitish and grayish-white rock, subcrystalline in fracture, with H.=\u00ab-5 and G. = 3-07, and constitutes ridges in the vicinity of Canaan, Ct.

According to Walchner (Mag. f. Pharm, xxv. 1) it is only a mixture ; and, according to Sandberger (Jahrb.

The tenorite, or oxyd of copper (CuO) in small delicate folia, occurring at Vesuvius, possesses, according to Maskelyne (Rep. Brit. Assoc, 1865, 33), double refraction, and moreover is opticaUy biaxial. This author also states that there are two equal cleavages inclined to one another 72\u00b0. As the names tenorite and melaconite were given the same year, and tenorite was made non-isometric (hexagonal) by its describer, it appears to be right that tenorite should be sustained for the above mineral, and melaconite be left for the isome tric kind, if any such proves to be a native species. That there is an isometric form of this Cu 0 has been announced by Becquerel, as stated on p. 137. Tenorite may have the form and dimen sions found by Jenzsch in crystals of Cu O from the hearth of a furnace (1. a), or those approxi mately of brookite ; and this would place it near brookite in the system, under the chemical for mula Ou 02 (analogous to that of brookite). Having this place in the arrangement it would be numbered 19SB. Melaconite crystals from CornwaU, coUected by Mr. TaUing, have been described by Maske lyne (1. c.) as monoclinic, with the planes O, i-i, I, 1, -1, 6-i, 6-6, and O A i-i=80\u00b0 28'. No measured angles are given, but only the deduced dimensions. They have basal cleavage easy. The crystals are often twins, and the composition-face in some of them is i-i. H. a little above 4; G.=5*82527. Church has ascertained that the crystals are essentially pure Cu O. It would appear, according to these observations, that this oxyd of copper is trimorphous ; and there exists a doubt whether tenorite may not have this obUque form. Tetradymite (31, p. 30). F. A.

The trichite, he states, is not pyrox ene or hornblende ; the belonite may be a feldspar. Tridymite Vom Rath, Vorgetr. Ch. Ges. Bonn, March 7, 1866, pub. in 1868 (copy rec'd from v. R, May 8, 1868).
