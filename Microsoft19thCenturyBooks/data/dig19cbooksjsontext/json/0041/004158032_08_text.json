Wordsworth in 1810 published Cavendish's Life of Wolsey from two manuscripts in the Lambeth library \u2014 it had never been printed entire before \u2014 it is a very interesting work, as Cavendish was Gentleman Usher to Wolsey, and continued with him to the last \u2014 it was first printed in 1641, but no publication was ever more unfaithful to the manuscript, from which it professed to be taken \u2014 There is a striking similarity between many of Shakspeare's speeches and Caven dish's narrative\u2014 Wordsworth says, that Stowe in his Annals had inserted large extracts from Cavendish's Manuscript."], [15, "c.

Warham as Archbishop of Canterbury was Le gatus natus, Wolsey was Legatus a latere \u2014 in John son and Steevens' Shakspeare the enumeration of the D.

Kemble has omitted these lines, and consequently there is no word to which they has reference. Lord Sands \u2014 \" I'm glad they are going.\" these words should have been omitted, or else Lovel's speech (in which he says that the gallants must either leave their French fashions, or pack to their old play-fellows) should have been retained\u2014 these mis takes are of no great importance, but still when a person undertakes to revise a play, he has no right to represent the author as guilty of inaccuracies, which do not exist in the original text.

(Enter Wolsey and Campeius with a commission. Burnet in his History of the Reformation says \u2014 \" Wolsey wrote an earnest letter to Campeius at \" Rome, to hasten him over ; the draught of it is in \" his Secretary's hand, amended in some places by \" his own ; and concluded thus, \u00ab I hope all things \" shall be done according to the will of God, the de \" sire of the King, the quiet of the kingdom, and"], [18, "8 c. g. 1805-1806. \" to our honour, with a good conscience' \u2014 but Wol \" sey dasht out this last word with a good conscience, \" perhaps judging that was a thing fit for meaner \" persons, but that it was below the dignity of two \" Cardinals to consider it much.\" Enter Gardiner\u2014 in this scene he should not be dressed as a Bishop, he was not made Bishop of Winchester till Dec. 5 1531, after Wolsey's death \u2014 this scene is supposed to pass in 1528 when Cam peius came into England \u2014 the King absolutely gained Campeius to do all he could for him without losing the Pope's favour \u2014 he led a very dissolute life in Eng land, hunting and gaming all the day long, and fol lowing whores all the night \u2014 he brought a bastard* of his own over with him, whom the King knighted \u2014 so that if the King sought his pleasure, it was no strange thing, since he had such a copy set him by two Le gates, who representing his Holiness so lively in their manners, it was no unusual thing, if a King had a slight sense of such disorders. (Burnet). The King concludes this scene with saying \u2014 \" Would it not grieve an able man, to leave \" So sweet a bedfellow ? but, conscience, con- science \u2014 \" O', 'tis a tender place, and I must leave her.\" Shakspeare goes too far in making the King regret so so sweet a bedfellow\u2014 he is however in some degree countenanced by Cavendish \u2014 but Wolsey, in one of * Jortin in his Life of Erasmus says, that the young man was not a bastard, but born in wedlock, before his father went into orders."], [19, "C. G. 1805-1806. 9 his dispatches to Rome, about the divorce, says, that because of some diseases in the Queen, which were incurable, the King had resolved never to come near her more\u2014 (Burnet probably) \u2014 tho' the King's anxiety for a divorce was doubtless increased by his love for Anne Bullen, yet his scruples of conscience were not a pretence \u2014 Rapin well observes, the wonder is he did not feel them sooner \u2014 he was mar ried to his brother's widow, when he was about twelve years' old, a dispensation from the Pope hav ing been first obtained \u2014 about two years after he, by his father's command, made a formal protestation, that he did not confirm his marriage, but retracted and annulled it \u2014 Henry the 7th, when he was just dying, charged his son to break it off \u2014 and it was not till after a serious consideration of the reasons on both sides, that Henry the 8th, six weeks after he came to the crown, was married again publickly \u2014 when the divorce came to be agitated, the Queen solemnly protested that her marriage with Prince Arthur had never been consummated, but there were the strong est presumptive proofs to the contrary. What were the King's secret motives, is only known to Heaven, but the principal reason which he always assigned was, that he found by the law of Moses, \" if a man \" took his brother's wife, they should die childless.\" \u2014 this made him reflect on the death of his children, which he now looked on as a curse from God for that unlawful marriage \u2014 upon this he set himself to study the case, and called for the judgments of the best Divines and Canonists \u2014 he likewise commanded the Archbishop of Canterbury to require the opinions of the Bishops of England \u2014 and they all, (except the"], [20, "10 C. G. 1805-1806. Bishop of Rochester,) declared that they judged it an unlawful marriage\u2014 Warham had from the first ob jected to it. (Burnet.) Scene 3d. If Kemble had any authority for chang ing Shakspeare's Old Lady into Lady Denny, he should have pointed it out in a note\u2014 if he had none, his caprice was inexcusable. Scene 4th. The King concludes the act with an apostrophe to Cranmer\u2014 Cranmer suggested that in stead of applying to the Pope for a divorce, it would be better to consult all the learned men, and the Uni versities of Christendom * * the King was much pleased with the suggestion, and said that Cranmer \" had the sow by the right ear.\" ( Burnet.) Act 3d. Shakspeare begins this act with an in teresting scene between the Queen and the two Car dinals \u2014 this Kemble has, with much discredit to him self, omitted \u2014 it was retained at C. G. in 1773 \u2014 Davies in 1784, says, it is omitted as tedious and un necessary \u2014 Cavendish gives a circumstantial account ofthe beginning of this interview, at which he was doubtless present \u2014 it corresponds with the scene in Shakspeare \u2014 he concludes with saying \u2014 \" and there \" with she took my Lord Cardinal by the hand and \" led him into her privy chamber, with the other \" Cardinal \u2014 where they tarried a season talking with \" the Queen, and ive might hear her very loud, but \" what she said we could not tell.\" Norfolk tells Wolsey it is the King's pleasure he should confine himself. \" To Esher house, my lord of Winchester's.\""], [21, "c. g. 1805-1806. 11 Shakspeare is inaccurate Ashere was a house situate near Hampton Court, belonging to the Bishoprick of Winchester, (Cavendish) and conse quently to Wolsey himself, who was the Bp. of that See. In Wolsey's 3d speech to Cromwell, Kemble has omitted 5 lines and half which should have been re tained, but he has restored as many which were not in the prompt-book of 1773. Act 4th. It has long been customary to give the part of Griffith in this act to Cromwell, for the sake of mak ing the whole more worthy of the attention of a re spectable performer\u2014 there is however a manifest ab surdity in representing the same person as in the con fidence of Wolsey and the Queen\u2014 Cavendish says, that the Queen at her trial prepared to leave the Court, leaning upon the arm of Mr. Griffith her General Receiver when she was called back \u2014 \" Madam,\" quoth Griffith, \" Ye be called again.\" \" On, on,\" quoth she, \" it maketh no matter,\" &c. Katharine \u2014 \" He step'd before me, happily, for my example\" \u2014 happily here means haply \u2014 Herbert in his Country Parson says \u2014 \" he turns his care to \" fit all his children's dispositions with some calling, \" not sparing the eldest, but giving him the preroga \" tive of his father's profession, which happily for his \" other children he is not able to do.\" Katharine \u2014 \" Of his own body he was ill, and gave \" The clergy ill example\" \u2014 one ofthe articles brought against Wolsey was, that,"], [22, "c. G. 1805-1806. 12 being conscious he had the lues venerea, he had not withstanding approached the King continually, and had often whispered him in the ear. (Rapin.) Johnson and Steevens read \u2014 \" This cardinal * * \" Was fashioned to much honour. From his cradle, \" He was a scholar, and a ripe and good one.\" Kemble reads \u2014 \" Was fashioned to much honour from his cradle : \" He was a scholar, and a ripe and good one.\" the old reading is the better\u2014 Kemble by altering the punctuation has perverted Shakspeare's meaning, which was, not to say simply that Wolsey was a good scholar, but that he made as early a profici ency in learning as it was possible for a child to do Cavendish says \u2014 \" being but a child he was very \" apt to be learned, wherefore he was conveyed to \" Oxenford, where he shortly prospered so in learning, \" as he told me by his own mouth, he was made \" Bachelor of Arts, when he past not 15 years of \" age, in so much that for the rareness of his age, '\u00ab he was called most commonly, through the Uni \" versity, the Boy Bachelor.\" Shakspeare's concise account of Wolsey's death agrees exactly with the longer account of Cavendish \u2014 Cavendish says that Wolsey was the haughtiest man alive, but he represents his conduct, after his fall and retirement to the North, as exemplary \u2014 and Wordsworth in a note shows, that Cavendish's ac count is fully confirmed by an authority, which can-"], [23, "c. g. 1805-1806. 13 not be suspected of partiality to Wolsey's memory \u2014 Wolsey was about 60 when he died\u2014 he kept his last Easter at Peterborough \u2014 upon Maunday Thursday he washed and kissed the feet of 59 poor men \u2014 the number denoted that he was then 59 years of age* \u2014 it was in his last discourse, as he lay on his death bed, that he said the words which have been so often quoted \" if I had served God, as diligently as I \" have done the king, he would not have given me \" over in my grey hairs \u2014 but this is the just reward I \"must receive, for my diligent pains and study, that \" I have had to do him service \u2014 not regarding my \" service to God, but only to satisfy his pleasure.\" In the former editions of Cavendish's work it is said that Wolsey \"poisoned himself,\" but Words worth assures us, that these words do not occur in any ofthe four MSS. that he had seen. Kemble has, with singlar impropriety, given the small part of the Messenger to Sir Henry Guildford \u2014 in the 1st and 2d acts he makes him act the part of the Queen's Gentleman Usher, and give her a cushion to kneel on \u2014 and now he offends her, by not showing her that respect, of which such a man as Sir Henry Guildford could not be ignorant that she was extremely tenacious \u2014 she had been much disquieted, because she would not lay down her title of Queen : * Pepys says April 4 1667 \u2014 \" My wife had been to White \" Hall to the Maunday, it being Maunday Thursday ; but the King \" did not wash the poor people's feet himself, but the Bishop of \" London did it for him\"\u2014 this silly ceremony is said to have been kept up by the Archbishops of Canterbury at Lambeth to a much later time."], [24, "14 c. g. 1805-1806. many of her servants were put from her on that ac count, but she would accept of no service, from any that did not use her as a Queen and call her so * * she had the jointure that was assigned her, as Prin cess Dowager, and was treated with the respect due to that dignity, but all the women about her still called her Queen. (Burnet, i) Sir Henry Guildford was in reality Comptroller of the King's house \u2014 (Cavendish) \u2014 Kemble has given him the parts ofthe Queen's Gentleman Usher, Sir Nicholas Vaux, the Messenger, and Dr. Butts \u2014 just before the entrance of the Messenger, Kemble has improperly omitted 3 short speeches \u2014 Katharine's last speech is altered for the worse. Act 5th. Scene 1st. \u2014 Cranmer enters to the King \u2014 Steevens tells us that the substance of this and the two following scenes is taken from Fox's Acts ofthe Martyrs, from which he gives a long extract \u2014 it is not certain in what year this design against Cranmer took place \u2014 Burnet (see pp. 342-344) thinks it was in 1546\u2014 certainly several years after the birth ofthe Princess Elizabeth, which was in 1533. Scene 3d. When Cranmer exhibits the ring, Nor folk says \u2014 \u2014 \" Do you think, my lords, \" The King will suffer but the little finger \" Of this man to be vex'd ?\" These words were really spoken by Lord Russel, whom Fox improperly calls Earl of Bedford\u2014 in this scene Kemble has made several small changes\u2014 one of them does him credit, if it was made in conse quence of looking into Burnet\u2014 he gives the Lord"], [25, "c. g. 1805-1806. 15 Chancellor's speech to the King, to Norfolk, who thereby speaks what he actually did say the King in Shakspeare says of Cranmer \u2014 \" If a prince \" May be beholden to a subject, I \"Am, for his love and service, so to him.\" These lines should not have been omitted. King \u2014 \" Come, come, my lord, you'd spare your \" spoons\" \u2014 it was the custom, long before the time of Shakspeare, for the sponsors at christenings to offer gilt spoons \u2014 the spoons were called apostle spoons, because the fingers of the Apostles were carved on the tops of the handles \u2014 some gave the whole twelve, others the four evangelists, or even the saint only, from whom the child received its name \u2014 (Steevens) \u2014 Congreve is probably the last person who mentions the apostle spoons on the stage \u2014 in Love for Love, Angelica says to Foresight, \" you prophesied popery \" was coming, only because the butler had mislaid \" some of the apostle spoons.\" Kemble has restored some lines which were omitted in 1773, but he has omitted still more which were then retained \u2014 on the whole he has not improved the play by his revisal.

Kemble begins his play, not as Shakspeare, not as Garrick, not as Colman, but as Tate \u2014 and to Tate he adheres pretty closely\u2014 he restores however some few lines which Garrick had restored before \u2014 Oswald is directed to enter and make his exit singing Tol de rol, &c\u2014 for this valuable stage direction we are not indebted to Tate, but Kemble. Act 2.

When Shakspeare met John Kemble in the Elysian fields, he said to him \u2014 \" I thank you heartily for your \"performance of my Coriolanus, Hamlet, Brutus, \" &c. \u2014 but did you never hear the good old proverb ? \" \u2014 the Cobler should not go beyond his last \u2014 Why \" would you tamper with the text of my plays ? \u2014 \" why give many of my characters names which I \" never dreamt of? \u2014 above all what could induce you \" to restore such passages of Tate, as even Garrick \"had rejected when he revised King Lear?\u2014 St."], [144, "134 c. g. 1808-1809. \" Lawrence never suffered more on his Gridiron, than \" I have suffered from the Prompt-book.\" Dr. Warburton is generally considered as one of Shakspeare's worst Commentators, yet he has a note on the Fool's prophecy, or rather prophecies, (act 3 scene 2) for the sagacity and acuteness of which Dr. Johnson very properly commends him\u2014 the Fool concludes the 1st part of his prophecy with \" Then comes the time, who lives to see't, \" That going shall be used with feet.\" the expression is not a very common one, but it oc curs in a Greek Epigram \u2014see Brod\u00e6us p. 408 \u2014 Avd^u-Tmg &XP' irodEg, n 'March 9- Never acted, Independence, or the Trus tee \u2014 Munden \u2014 C.

(Dram. Censor.) THIRD THEATRE. In 1810-1811, a Sd theatre was much talked of both in and out of Parliament \u2014 it was chiefly owing to the exertions of Mr. Whitbread in settling the affairs of D. L., and to his opposition in the House of Commons, that the bill for a 3d theatre did not pass\u2014 the advocates for that measure seem to have overlooked one material point\u2014 as Colley Gibber said to Christopher Rich on a similar occasion, \" where are your actors ?\" \u2014 an Act of Parliament cannot create them, and money can only purchase such as there are \u2014 the Proprietors of a 3d theatre would probably have seduced some few performers from the D. L. and C. G. Companies by the offer of a larger salary or better parts \u2014 (as John Rich did when he opened L. I. F. in 1714) \u2014 they must have completed their establishment from the theatres out"], [231, "221 THIRD THEATRE. of London \u2014 the latter measure would have been only forestalling the market \u2014 as it is, a performer who has distinguished himself in a provincial theatre, is pretty sure of an engagement at D. L. or C. G. \u2014 sooner or later according to circumstances \u2014 the re sult of a 3d theatre must ultimately have been, that the theatrical talents, which existed, would have been divided by 3 instead of 2, and that consequently plays would have been worse acted in all the 3 theatres \u2014 rarely has it happened, that with 2 theatres there have been two strong Companies \u2014 the only rational plan on which a Sd theatre could have been opened, would have been to have confined it to the performance of Operas. The promoters of a 3d theatre had formed some very good resolutions. No freedoms of any kind, or orders, even to authors or performers, were to be granted, as they only serve to influence, or overpower the judgment ofthe public, as to the merit of plays or actors \u2014 and also they occasion cabals, by introducing partizans for insidious purposes \u2014 or they are used as decoys, to give a false appearance to the theatre. The theatre was to have been built in such a man ner as to afford the greatest possible security against fire \u2014 and to secure to the spectator and auditor the full advantage of sight and hearing, without forcing either the performers or the company to overstrain their organs. The prices were to have been \u2014 boxes 6s. \u2014 pit 3s. \u2014galleries 2s. and Is.\u2014 the size of the theatre was to have been little more than the extent of old D.L., which, exempt from renters and other free people,"], [232, "222 THIRD THEATRE. would, at the old prices, hold as much money, as the modern excessively large theatres, loaded as they are with so many gratis admissions \u2014 the stage boxes were to be appropriated to the friends of the per formers, instead of orders\u2014 see Dramatic Censor for 1811\u2014 pp. 97\u2014 218. It seems that the Proprietor of C. G. had sold the dormant Patent. Peake the Treasurer of D. L. in a letter dated Nov. 5 1809 says \u2014 \" It may be proper to announce \" that, should a third theatre be really desirable, and \" called for by the public, the dormant Patent an \" nexed to this theatre, under the royal sanction, \" will be immediately put in action for the attainment \" of that object.\" Fry, the Solicitor for the intended Subscription Theatre, in a letter dated Nov. 8 1809 says \u2014 \" We \" understand that when it was in contemplation to \" pull down old Drury, and rebuild the late theatre, \" as the Company was then playing on a patent that \" had not many years to run, in order to induce the \" public to subscribe for the erection of the new \" theatre, it became necessary to obtain a more \" permanent tenure, than a temporary patent \u2014 and \" as Mr. Harris then had lying dormant what was \" considered to be a patent in fee, that patent was \" purchased with some of the fund raised for build \" ing new Drury\"\u2014 (Outom)\u2014 the Patent men tioned in these letters was that granted to Killegrew."], [233, "c. g. 1810-1811. 223 C.

On the 1st night of this season, 12 centre boxes of the private circle were thrown open to the public \u2014 no more private boxes were retained than there had been in the old theatre before the fire \u2014 but because the Crown and Anchor treaty was not strictly adhered to, the O. P. riots were renewed \u2014 and continued till the Proprietors were compelled to give up the point \u2014 the theatre was shut for a week in order to make the necessary alterations \u2014 /Oulton) \u2014 might, as is usual in these cases, overcame right \u2014 nothing could be more reasonable, than that both the Patent Thea-"], [234, "c. g. 1810-1811. 224 tres should be on the same footing \u2014 but it would have been more prudent, if the Proprietors of C.

Of the scene in the 4th act, Ballantyne says \u2014 \" Mrs. Siddons, with a curious perception of truth \" and nature, peculiarly her own, displayed through \" her feeble and falling frame, and death-stricken \" expression of features, that morbid fretfulness of \" look, that restless desire of changing place and po \" sition, which frequently attends our last decay \u2014 \" with impatient solicitude, she sought relief from the \" irritability of illness by the often shifting her situ \" ation in her chair, having the pillows on which she \" reposed her head, every now and then removed \" and adjusted\u2014 bending forward, and sustaining \" herself, while speaking, by the pressure of her \" hands upon her knees, and playing, during dis \" course, among her drapery with restless and un \" easy fingers ; and all this with such delicacy and \" such effect combined, as gave a most beautiful, as \" well as most affecting portraiture of nature fast ap \" proaching to its exit\u2014 to select passages from this"], [315, "C. g. 1811-1812. 305 \"scene for particular admiration would be idle \u2014 \" every part being made with minute and watchful \" skill to conduce to the general impression\u2014 yet one \" beauty of her performance must not pass unno \" ticed \u2014 the astonishing nicety with which her \" powers are made gradually to decay from the \" beginning to the end of the scene, when her anxi \" ous directions to Capucius seem to have exhausted \" her, when ' her eyes grow dim,' and her bodily \" and mental powers seem but just to suffice, as she \" is supported off, to lay upon her servants her last \" and pathetic injunctions.\" Mrs. Siddons' last performance at Edinburgh (as was then supposed) was on March 13 1812, in Queen Katharine \u2014 Ballantyne concludes thus \u2014 \" we have \" lost, and for ever, an artist, whose performances \" rendered appropriate praise either difficult or un- \" necessary, and adequate praise impossible \u2014 future \" times may wonder at, and perhaps doubt, in their \" honest love of some contemporary favourite, the \" magic wonders delivered to them by the present \" age of the powers of Siddons \u2014but we can only \" say, and, we think, truly say, that no sculptor or \" painter, in the sublimest flights of his fancy, ever \" embodied\u2014 no poet in the most luxuriant indulg- \" ence of his imagination, ever described \u2014 a crea- \" ture so formed, so gifted, to agitate, to awe, and \" astonish mankind by her professional powers, as \" her, whose matchless form, face, voice, and eye \" are now finally withdrawn from our public \" admiration.\" VOL. VIII. \\"], [316, "c. g. 1811-1812. 306 Mrs. Siddons latterly did not play Isabella and Belvidera so well as she used to do\u2014 this however was merely owing to her not being able to throw her self down on the stage, and make such bodily exer tions as she had formerly been accustomed to make \u2014these things may be called st/aj^ge tricks, but when judiciously introduced, and happily executed, they add vastly to the effect produced on an audience \u2014 the last season that Mrs. Siddons was on the stage, in Measure for Measure when she knelt to the Duke, she could not get up without assistance \u2014 this was of course given to her \u2014 but to conceal the real reason, Mrs. Powell, who acted Mariana, was also assisted in rising. Mrs. Siddons, in some particular situations, had a look with her eyes, which it is hardly possible to describe\u2014 she seemed in a manner to turn them in her head \u2014 the effect was exquisite, but almost painful.

CUMBERLAND'S POSTHUMOUS PLAYS, 1813. Cumberland in 1806 published his own Life in one vol. 4to. \u2014 as Tacitus says \u2014 \" suam ipse vitam \" narrare, fiduciam potius morum, quam arrogantiam"], [400, "Cumberland's posthumous plays, 1813. 390 \" arbitratus\" \u2014 in the course of his work he gives his own opinion of most of the plays which he had then written. Dr. Johnson says, that Dryden in his preface to Secret Love discusses a curious question, whether a poet can judge well of his own productions \u2014 and determines very justly, that, of the plan and dispo sition, and all that can be reduced to principles of science, the author may depend upon his own opinion \u2014 but that, in those parts where fancy pre dominates, self-love may easily deceive. Cumberland's first piece, the Banishment of Cicero, was printed in I76I \u2014this T. is founded on history, but great part of it is fiction\u2014 Clodia is in love with Frugi \u2014 he is in love with Tullia, the daughter of Cicero \u2014 he rejects the solicitations of Clodia \u2014 she instigates Clodius, who is her brother, and with whom she is too intimate, to kill Frugi \u2014 Clodius kills Volumnius, supposing him to be Frugi \u2014 Clodia stabs herself\u2014 the last scene lies in the Temple of Vesta \u2014 Frugi is killed fighting \u2014 Terentia and Tullia are forced off the stage by the followers of Clodius and Gabinius \u2014 Clodius says of Cicero \u2014 \" Be it my task to cast this Exile forth.\" In fact Cicero left Rome in the night, and without the knowledge of Clodius\u2014 this T. was not acted\u2014 it is badly calculated for representation \u2014 Cumber land considers the dialogue between Cicero and Atticus iu the 3d act one of his happiest efforts in point of poetry\u2014 many other parts of this T. are particularly well written, but it is liable to some serious objections\u2014 the subject is badly calculated"], [401, "cum'berland's posthumous plays, 1813. 391 for the Drama\u2014 Clodius, and not Cicero, is the principal character\u2014 and the love episode of Frugi and Tullia is a poor piece of business the Edi tors of the B.

L. Jan. 3) had fitted Shakspeare's play for the stage by abridging and transposing only \u2014 it was now revived upon another plan. Act 1st does not differ materially from the origi nal\u2014Modena and Charmian are properly changed to Mutina and Charmion \u2014 but Mar/. Antony should have been altered to Marc Antony, as in the bill \u2014 the letter k in a Roman name is an unpardonable solecism. Act 2d, begins with Shakspeare's 2d scene, but the conclusion of it, in which Enobarbus describes Cleopatra on the Cydnus, is most injudiciously omitted \u2014 Capell has transposed it\u2014 then follows Shakspeare's 5th scene with Cleopatra and her attendants \u2014 next comes an unimportant scene be tween Antony and Octavia at Athens\u2014 this is from Shakspeare's 3d act Cleopatra, &c. are disco vered at Alexandria \u2014 the first part of this scene is chiefly from Shakspeare, but when Antony enters, the remainder of the act is from Dryden\u2014 Dryden's VOL. VIII. E E"], [428, "c. G. 1813-1814. 418 scene is a very good one, but it is not introduced in this place with propriety \u2014 in \"Dryden's play, Venti dius in the 1st act estranges Antony from Cleopatra, after which, naturally follows the scene in which Antony reproaches her \u2014 but the editor of the pre sent play reverses the order of things, and makes Dryden's 2d scene precede his 1st \u2014 in Dryden's play the scene lies the whole time at Alexandria, but in this alteration Antony is represented as coming back to \u00c6gypt merely to tell Cleopatra that they must part \u2014 which is not only contrary to the fact, but absurd in itself \u2014 there was nothing like a quarrel between Antony and Cleopatra till after the battle of Actium. Act 3d begins with the 6th scene of Shakspeare's 3d act \u2014 then follows the 7th scene \u2014 the battle of Actium takes place in the sight of the audience \u2014 and the act is concluded from Shakspeare with slight alterations. Act 4th is nearly the whole of it from Dryden \u2014 the celebrated scene between Antony and Ventidius is introduced with propriety \u2014 that in which Venti dius leads on Octavia, might have been spared \u2014 and the one from Dryden, which is improperly in serted in the 2d act, might have been substituted for it\u2014 Octavia's coming to Antony in \u00c6gypt is a poetical fiction on the part of Dryden, and the scene itself is not equal in merit to the scenes of Shakspeare, which are left out to make room for it \u2014 Dryden's description of Cleopatra on the Cydnus is omitted. Act 5th is made up from Shakspeare and Dryden \u2014 Ventidius kills himself as in Dryden \u2014when An-"], [429, "c. g. 1813-1814. 419 tony has fallen on his sword, the play is concluded from Shakspeare \u2014 C\u00e6sar and his party enter \u2014 after which, the scene changes to the interiour of the monument \u2014 Antony, Cleopatra, &c. are discovered \u2014 Antony dies\u2014 and the act proceeds as in Shaks peare, but with great omissions \u2014 Cleopatra's speeches are sadly mutilated \u2014 the play concludes with two short scenes, partly from Shakspeare \u2014and a grand funeral procession. This alteration is attributed to Kemble\u2014 but his name does not appear in the titlepage \u2014 Capell's alteration is the better ofthe two \u2014 the modern editor omits too much of Shakspeare \u2014 yet it must be allowed, that no person has altered one of Shaks peare's plays materially, and has yet succeeded so well \u2014 the reason is obvious\u2014 he has selected the best parts of Dryden's best Tragedy, instead of patching up a play, with stuff of his own inven tion, as Davenant, Tate, Gibber, &c. have done. This revival of Antony and Cleopatra did not meet with the success it deserved \u2014 it ought not however to have been brought forward without a first rate actress in Cleopatra\u2014 Mrs. Siddons would have made a glorious part of Cleopatra (supposing the part not to have been mutilated) and perhaps have fixed the play in the favour of the public she had been more than once or twice solicited by Kemble to act Shakspeare's Cleopatra, but she continually declined for a very foolish reason\u2014 she said she should hate herself, if she should play the part as it ought to be played. 25.

The writer of Strictures on the Performers in 1795 says \u2014 \" Bannister's action is generally good, \" and apposite to the sentiment \u2014 there is no passion \" that operates in the human mind, but what he can \" with facility pourtray by his features \u2014 they have \" a flexibility of muscle, and a power of expression, \" that have never been equalled by any male per \" former since the days of Garrick \u2014 there is aspark \" ling animation in his eyes that approaches near to \" the brilliancy of those of our English Roscius \u2014 \" the movements of the lower part of his face are, \" if possible, more at his command than the rest\u2014 \" so that he can easily express all internal motions \" as far as the human face is capable of expressing"], [477, "d.

Bannister, in his farewell address to the audi ence, said, that his health warned him to retire, and that their patronage had given him the means of doing so with comfort\u2014 at the conclusion of his speech, he bowed respectfully to the audience, and was led off by all the performers of the theatre, who attended to witness his farewell \u2014 no performer ever quitted the stage more deservedly respected, or re gretted.

L. could not furnish an actor to speak the 7 lines which belong to Ventidius, the name should have been changed to Sempronius in the message, and the line and half, quoted above, should have been omitted \u2014 Lamb improperly con cludes this act with Timon's 1st soliloquy from the next act \u2014 he makes Timon leave his house, and instantly re-enter without the walls of Athens. Act 4th \u2014 perhaps too much is omitted.

Downman published his Lucius Junius Brutus, or the Expulsion of the Tarquins, in 1779 \u2014 his play on the whole does him considerable credit \u2014 it is pro fessedly not a Tragedy, but a historical play \u2014 the important character of Aruns is rather comic than tragic \u2014 Downman says in his preface \u2014 \" there are \"not wanting many good judges of composition, \" who wish that the less studied diction, and more \" plain and level metre of the school of Shakspeare \u00ab' (which ended with Southerne) had been continued \" to the present time A diversification of cha \" racters hath been attempted in this piece ; and to \" give every character the mode of sentiment and \" expression peculiarly suited to it however it \" may appear to us, when we are reading, no small \" attention is requisite in written dialogue of any \" kind, for an author entirely to cast off self\u2014 this \" was the characteristic of Shakspeare.\" -Cumberland's play was published in his posthu mous works \u2014 it is a moderate Tragedy \u2014 he has written the characters of Brutus and Tullia very well, but the rest of his play has not much to re commend it \u2014 he calls it the Sybil, (Sibyl) or the Elder Brutus\u2014 he has perhaps managed the charac ter of the Sibyl as well as it could be managed, but such a sabulous character in a modern T. creates disgust \u2014 it might have passed muster very well in one of Seneca's plays Payne has properly omitted it Brutus, when his son is brought in as a traitor, with the utmost apathy calls Valerius aside, and makes a speech of 14 lines to him about his having pulled down his house, and thereby acquired the name of Poplicola\u2014 this is very unnatural \u2014 and"], [689, "d. l. 1818-1819. 679 the anticipation of the name of Poplicola is an un pardonable blunder\u2014 besides it was not simply for the pulling down of his house on mount Velia, but for several popular laws which he proposed, that, in the course of time, he acquired that name. Payne's Brutus met with success vastly beyond its merits. Act 1\u2014 the 1st scene is unimportant\u2014 the 2d is from Downman \u2014 the rest ofthe act from Cumber land. Act 2 \u2014 the 1st scene is from Downman\u2014 the 2d scene and the beginning of the 3d seem to be written by Payne\u2014 when Sextus, &c. euter to Lu cretia, the act is concluded from Downman. Act 3 \u2014 the 1st scene is chiefly from Cumberland \u2014 scene 2d \u2014 in this scene Lucretia, on the first re presentation, stabbed herself \u2014 this circumstance, which was better calculated for the Drama than almost any other in the story, was afterwards omitted \u2014 it should have been retained, and Lucretia's last speech in Lee's [day might have been introduced with propriety \u2014 as the scene now stands a little is borrowed from Cumberland and Downman \u2014 scene 3d is unimportant \u2014 scene 4th (the Forum) is chiefly from Downman \u2014 some few lines are from Cum berland.

Act 5\u2014 the 1st scene is chiefly from Cumberland \u2014 the 2d scene is at the house of Brutus \u2014 Valerius enters, and Brutus speaks the lines about Poplicola \u2014 the last scene has some few speeches from Cum berland, but it is chiefly from Lee\u2014 the mention of Tarquinia is brought in with great impropriety- Payne ends his play well for stage effect \u2014 yet it may be doubted whether Cumberland's catastrophe is not preferable, as it includes the whole of the history of Brutus \u2014 Sextus Tarquinius and Brutus fight \u2014 they kill each other, and the play ends with the dying speech of Brutus\u2014 in reality Aruns and Brutus killed each other, each of them being more intent on wounding his adversary than defending himself \u2014 but the poetical license, which Cumberland has taken, is a very fair one. Payne, with great want of judgment, calls the principal stickler for the Tarquins, Horatius\u2014 if he had looked into Livy, he would have seen that Hora tius, who lived at the same time as Brutus, was of the popular party\u2014 if he had read through Livy, he probably would not have found one instance, in which the family of the Horatii were not on the same side\u2014 he calls the attendants on Tullia Ladies of the Court -if a man will write on a Roman story, he is bound to make himself a little acquainted with the manners of the times. Payne says that 7 plays have been written on the subject of Brutus, only 2 of which have been acted \u2014 for Lee's Lucius Junius Brutus see D. G. 1681 \u2014"], [691, "d. l. 1818-1819. 681 it was altered to the Patriot and brought out at D. L. in or about 1703\u2014 Duncombe's Junius Brutus came out at D. L. Nov. 25 1734. The History of Brutus is ill suited to the Drama, and if 7 more plays were to be written, probably not one of them would be a good one \u2014Lee, Dun combe, Cumberland, and Payne have been forced to introduce a contemptible love episode in order to spin out 5 acts \u2014 Downman concludes his play with the expulsion of the Tarquins, and before the con spiracy for their restoration \u2014 in all these plays the character of Brutus is considerably softened \u2014 see Plutarch's Life of Poplicola.
