SOUTH-WEST DIVISION. PARISH OF NORTON N some of the old records, this parish is called Normanton ,\u25a0 an appellation which Hutchinson derives from its old possessors, the Normans : but Sur- tees supposes that \" the name is probably simply Norton, from its situa- tion in reference to Stockton.\" It is not, however, likely that the place would receive its title from its relative position to a dependant town, which, in ecclesiastical matters, Stockton originally was. The parish of Norton is bounded by Billingham on the north-east and north, by Grin- don on the north-west, by Redmarshall on the west, and by Stockton on the south and east. It forms only one constablery, which includes the ma- nor of Blakiston. The number of inhabitants in 1801 was 965 ; but in 1811 they had increased to 1053, and in 1821 to 1180. In the year 1828-9, the value of the lands and buildings in the parish was estimated for the county-rate at 4s. 3jd. per annum. This is a member of one of the bishop's great manors, and is described in the Boldon Book as follows : \u2014 In Norton there were thirty villains, each holding two oxgangs of land under the like rents and services as those of Boldon, except cornage rent, which they did not pay, for want of pasturage.* There were twenty farmers, who held forty oxgangs of land, rendering, for every two oxgangs, half a mark. They each ploughed and harrowed half an acre in the lord's demesne, provided two men two days in mowing and reaping, and the like at hay-making ; also, four carts one day, or one cart four days, for leading hay and corn ; and dressed four portions of land in autumn, with all * \" This exception,\" says Hutchinson, \"confirms a curious particular, as it distinguishes, that tbe born, sounding an alarm on tbe approach of an enemy, was not of a military nature, to call the vassals and tenants to arms, but to warn the husbandmen to drive their flocks and herds from the pastures into the strong-hold*, where they had castle-guard.\" VOL.

Alan de Normanton held one carucate of land for 10s., and provided thirty-two men to work one day, and four carts one day, or two for two days, to lead corn ; and his men were to work, by dressing four portions of land in autumn, with their families, except the housewives. Adam, the son of Gilbert de Herdwick, held thirty-six acres of land in Norton near Herdwick, then called sixty acres ; and rendered two marks at the bishop's pleasure. The mills had ei\u00b0*ht acres allotted to them, and the Mill-meadow, and paid twenty marks. The punder had four acres, and the thraves of Norton ; and rendered fourscore hens and five hundred eggs. Twelve cottagers held tofts and crofts, and thirteen acres in the town-fields ; rendering 6s., workino* fourteen days, and dressing four portions of land in autumn. North-meadows were in the bishop's hands. Norton paid 3s. for toll of ale. The whole vill provided two milch cows. In Hatfield's Survey, the tenants are distinguished into tenants in drengage, free tenants, bond tenants, selfodes, cottagers, and tenants by exchequer rents. Alan de Normanton's tenure, said to be in drengage, was now, from an intermediate occupier, called Lucas-land, and vested in Sir Roger Fulthorpe, Knt. ; and the whole of the services were commuted for 9s. lOd. rent at Mi chaelmas, and 10s. exchequer rent. The tenure consisted of two messuages and one carucate; the latter including eight oxgangs, of fifteen acres each. Sir Roger held twenty-nine acres besides, once Master John of Norton's, called Trumperland, under 6s. 8d. rent. Free tenants : \u2014 Richard Stanlawman, a messuage and three oxgangs, once of Adam Fitz-John, by foreign service and Ils. ; Robert Johnson, a messuage and oxgang called Bysesland, 16s. 8d. ; Robert Spurner, a messuage, three oxgangs, and twelve acres, once of William Fitz-Thomas the Clerk, 18s. Gd. and foreign ser vice. Bond tenants : \u2014 John Sandy, and twenty-three others, each held one entire bond-land of two oxgangs (each of fifteen acres), for which he paid 2s. in money at the four usual terms ; 6d. for scatpennies at the Purification ; six bushels of scat-oats at the same period; and 6d. for aver pennies at Martinmas. Each led five wainloads of wood on St. John's day, provided two hens at Christinas, and ten eggs at Easter. They wrought three days in every week, except a week at Easter and Pentecost, and thirteen days at Christmas. They were to fallow one day in the de mesnes of Stockton, and thereby were entitled to a corrody. Every two villains were privileged to erect a booth at St. Cuthbert's fair; and when required, the villains were, in every year, to build a house, forty feet long, and fifteen wide. Every servant to a bond tenant, of the age of sixteen years, paid yearly to the lord, towards the portions or dressing of land in autumn, 12d. Selfodes, or those who subsisted independent of the lands, as self-holds, of whatever degree, dwellers in the vill, paid to the lord 3d. yearly. The punder paid fourscore hens at Christmas, and five hundred eggs at Easter. Cottagers: \u2014 William Couper held a cottage, once Adam Edeson's, and one acre of coteland, paid 6d., and owed thirteen days' work yearly ; the price of composition for each day was a farthing, and the composition for four portions of tillage 3d. each by agreement : all these services were compounded for lljd. rent at Michaelmas. John Magson and nine others held eleven cottages and seven acres, and divers roods and parcels under the same services. The tenants held amongst them two acres and a rood, called Punderland, and paid as under Boldon Book, now 2s. *]&. obol. William Etys and three others held the common forge, 18d. John Mageson a dovecote, 6d. The tenants had the common bakehouse, 66s. 8d. ; the toll of ale, 10s. ; and they paid in lieu of two milch cows, 12s. Norton, Stokton, and Hertburn mills, with eight acres and the meadows near the mill, viz.

They ground their corn at a thirteenth mulcture. Whenever the bishop repaired or rebuilt his manor-house at Stockton, they were to carry his timber for that pur pose. They also carried a dole or pipe of wine from the river Tees to the bishop's cellars, in his manor-house of Stockton. A few scattered freeholds appear on the records. In Bishop Hatfield's time, a resident family had assumed the local name ; and held two parcels of land, with two oxgangs, in the vill of Stock ton, by fealty and certain rents: and Will o' the Oise, of Norton, held a messuage and sixteen acres of land in Norton, rendering 16s. 8d. rent. The Fulthorpes held some lands here; and Roger de Fulthorpe, of Norton, died seized, in the 9th year of Bishop Langley, of a messuage, a dovecote, and three oxgangs of land, in Norton, held by military service and Ils. rent, leaving Isabella his daughter and heiress. Lands in Norton and Wolviston were specified in the settle ment made by Thomas Fulthorpe, Esq., in favour of his daughters, Isabel and Philippa, dated June 24, in the 19th year of Bishop Neville. Whilst the wapentake of Sadberge was in the crown, King Henry II. granted a weekly market to Norton on the Lords day, with the like privileges as other markets held under royal authority in England.* The principal part of the property in this parish is still held by lease or by copy of court-roll under the see of Durham. The village of Norton is pleasantlv situated, li miles north from Stockton. It is above half a mile in length, extending from south to north on the easy inclination ofa hill; the church, with the vicarage and its plantations, standing at the north end, and oppo- site to which is a spacious green, surrounded by houses, and having the Grammar School, a neat, low building, on the south side. The principal street or road is beautified by rows of trees on each side. Besides the above seminaryr, there are in Norton a ladies' boarding-school and a day- school. Messrs. W. and J. Page carry on an extensive tannery here ; and there are two large breweries, with eight inns and public houses ; also a number of the various tradesmen, shopkeepers, and mechanics, necessary in so considerable a village. A large Wesleyan Methodist chapel, con- taining a gallery, was erected here in 1824 ; to which a Sunday-school is now attached. Norton Hall, a handsome mansion-house, is the property and residence of John Hogg, Esq. The beauty of the situation, and the salubrity of the air, render Norton a desirable place of residence. Colo- nel Grey, collector of the customs at Stockton ; John Cartwright, Esq., justice of the peace ; Christopher Tennant, Esq. ; Henry Stapylton, Esq. ; Colonel Maddison ; Christopher White, Esq. ; Miss Ward, and several others, reside here either occasionally or altogether. -f The parish contains between twenty and thirty farms. * It was no uncommon thing to bold markets and fairs on this day (see Sedgefield, vol. i. p. 427), wiiich was also lung observed in this country, as it still is on the Continent, as a dav of recreation and amusement. \" The 13. of Ianuary (1583) being Sonday about foure of the clocke in the afternoon, the olde and under propped scaffoldes rounde about tbe Bear-garden, on tbe soutli side of the Thames, ouer against the Citty of London, ouercharged with people, fell suddenly downe, whereby to the number of 8 persons men and women were slaine, and many others sore hurt and brused.

He had been for many years i.n VOL. II. C"], [14, "STOCKTON WARD\u2014 S. W. D. 4 The Chinch. It is said that, by the Pope's command, Norton was made a collegiate church by William de Carilepho, for the maintenance and support of the secular canons, whom he removed out of the the service of the Hudson's Bay Company, and was applied to for information by Mr. Arthur Dobb.% whose attention to the subject bad been aroused' by the publications of preceding voyagers. Though the Company themselves were for a lung time exceedingly jealous of their monopoly, and net only discouraged all attempts at northern discovery, but withheld what little information came to their knowledge, yet the facts which Mr. Dobbs oljtained'from Mr. .Middleton confirmed his former opinions, and rendered in his mind the exist ence us a passage into the Pacific quite conclusive. On the strength of these facts be prevailed on the Lords ofthe Admiralty to appropriate a ship of the navy for the purposes of discovery, and to give the command of her to Captain Middleton. Accordingly, the Furnace bomb and the Discovery pink were put under his orders, the latter being commanded by Mr. William Moor. Middleton left England in 1741, and passed the winter in Churchill River, in latitude 53 deg. 50 min., where he unaccountably was detained till July 1, 1/42. Leaving this river, he stood along the coast to the northward, and on the 4th saw Brook Cobham, which had still' much snow lying on it. On the 10th, he was in lat. 03 deg. 51 min., long. 88 deg. 34 min., the Welcome being here 11 orl2 leagues in width, and full of flouting ice, from the upper part of which they procured fresh water for the use of the ships' companies. Having got through the ice, he observed, to the northward of Cape Dobbs, another headland on the north-west side of the Welcome, in lat. 05 deg. 12 min., long. 80 (leg. 6 min. west, beyond which was a fair opening or river, six or eight miles in width which extended within to the width of four or five leagues. Into this opening the ships proceeded, to secure them from the ice, until it had dispersed in the Welcome. Tlie entrance into this river, called the Wager, lies in lat. 65 deg. 23 min. The ice floated in and out with the flood and ebb tides ; but a good anchorage was found on the northern side, free from the ice, in a cove which he called Savage Sound. After exploring the Wager, it was discovered to have no other outlet but that by which they had entered ; and, on the 4th of August, the ships departed out of it. In lat. (55 deg. 38 min , long. 87 deg. 7 min. west, they entered another opening, lying north-west of Wager River, 13 leagues in width ; and, on the following day, they were in lat. (id deg. 14 min., long. 80 deg. 28 min. west, at which place it had narrowed to eight or nine leagues. Though tlie tide came from the eastward, the appearance ofa fair cape or heudh.nd, and the trending of the land, gave the greatest joy, all believing that this cape would prove the north-east point of America ; and Middleton therefore gave it the name of Cape Hope. The next day, when the fog had cleared away, they perceived the land to extend to westward of north, making a deep bay ; and standing on towards the bottom of this bay, they saw plainly that they could not proceed above six or eight miles far- ther. On trying the set of the tide, they found it slack water, and concluded therefore that they must have overshot the opening to the eastward at which the tide entered. \"Here,\" says Mr. Barrow, \"Middleton talks very unintelligibly of a. frozen strait to the eastward of them. On the 8th, he says that, at ten in the morning, he went on shore, taking with him the gunner, carpenter, and his clerk, to try if he could find from whence the flood came into this strait or bay. He describes tbe entrance of the frozen strait, among the islands on the east side, as bearing east two leagues ; he travelled, he says, about 15 miles, to the high- est mountain that overlooked the strait and east bay on the other side, and saw the passage the flood came in at ; the narrowest part, he says, of this strait is four or five leagues, and five, six, and seven in the broad- est, almost full of large and small islands, and in length about 10 or 18 leagues; to tbe westward it was full of ice, not broken up, but fist in every part to the shoals and islands in the strait. Finding no hope in that direction, aud the ice not being broken up, it was resolved in council to try the other side of the Welcome, from Cape Dobbs to Brook Cobham, to know if there was an opening there, and then return to England. Thev accordingly bore up on the 9th August, stood away to the southward, and on the 15th, after watering the ships at Brook Cobham. Middleton set sail for England.\" Soon after his arrival, Mr. Middleton was accused to Mr. Dobbs of having received a bribe of \u00a35000 from his old employers not to make any discoveries, and of having consequently neglected to examine the coast. The Lords of the Admiralty called on Captain Middleton to answer the strong charges preferred against him by Mr. Dobbs, which he did in detail; but the impression of bribery or treachery had gone forth, and it does not appear that the Board of Admiralty was satisfied with his explanation, or, at least, that they ap- proved of his conduct, though he asks them for that approbation. On the contrary, it may rather be infer- red that they considered him culpable ; for, the very next year after his return, an act of parliament was passed, by which a reward of \u00a320,000 was otfered to the person or persons, being subjects of his majesty,"], [15, "NORTON. 5 cathedral church of Durham. Tanner says, \" It may be presumed that Norton was not so early, the first mention of prebends here, which hath yet occurred to me, being in 1227.\"' The college consisted, after that date, of eight prebendaries or portionists, in thc patronage of the bishop of Durham ; and so continued to the time of the dissolution. In 1291, these prebends were esti mated at \u00a36 per annum; but their value in 1531, 26 Hen. VIII., was only \u00a3-1, 6s. 8d. each, or \u00a331, 13s. 4d. in all. The stipends arose from part of the tithe of corn of the parish. In 1553, Lancelot Thwaites, Anthony Salvin, Nicholas Thornhill, John Tunstall, Nicholas Lenthall, Row land Swinburn, and Jerome Bernard, received pensions of \u00a35 each. Norton church stands on the highest ground in the village towards the north. It appears to have consisted originally of a regular chancel, transept, and nave, with the tower in the centre ; but the south end of the transept has been shortened, and the whole seems to have undergone considerable alterations. The nave has regular aisles, each formed by two round pillars, with ca pitals of light round mouldings, and pointed arches. The tower is supported by four circular arches, one of which opens into the north transept, or Blakiston porch. The chancel has been stalled for the prebendaries ; and there are still traces of pilasters and ornaments near the altar. The font is fixed in the wall, close to the altar-rails, and has probably been formerly used as a vessel for holy water. All the windows are flat-topped : that to the east consists of three lights under a low arch. Immediately beneath it, and over the altar-table, is a beautiful painting of the Last Supper, the gift of the late rector. An organ, also presented by him, is placed in a lofty gallery beneath one of the arches of the central tower. The church-plate consists of two flaggons, a chalice, and a paten, \" the gift of the Rev. Christopher Anstey, vicar of the parish church of Norton, county of Durham,\" 1808. The tower contains three bells; one dated 1607, one 1613, and a third inscribed, \" Venite erultemus Domino, 1664, R.

The hands are elevated, and the legs crossed, the feet resting on a lion in the act of destroying some animal. The head is bare, and the sword sheathed. Six coats of arms are sculptured on the shield, viz. those of Blakiston, Surtees, Bowes, Dalden, and two of Conyers. These bearings have been supposed to point out Thomas Blakiston, who died in 1484; but Surtees proves that they could not have been borne by any of that family before 1586 \u2014 too late a date for the effigy. \"Does the figure,\" says he, \"represent some elder Blakiston, and have who should discover a north-west passage through Hudson's Strait to the western and northern ocean of America. It ought, however, to be observed, that the expedition sent out in 1746, under the direction ofa committee, returned without examining the supposed \"frozen strait,\" on the existence of which Captain Middleton's character for veracity mainly depended \u2014 Barrow's Chronological History qf Voyages into the Arctic Regions, p. 278. Jeremiah Moore, Esq., died at his house in Norton, July 27, 1753, aged 57- He was the last of his fa mily ; and had, in tbe former part of his life, suffered extreme hardships, through the cruelty of his elder brother, by whose means he was carried into Turkish slavery, and, at the time of his brother's death, was a common seaman in the navy, having been pressed in the -Mediterranean, after he had made his escape from the Turks. When he came to his estate, be converted it into money, and settled in the north, exercising acts of goodness to all his poor neighbours, to whom be left largely. Having no relations, he bequeathed to six gentlemen, who were kind to him in his adversity, \u00a31500 each ; and to his housekeeper, Mrs. Ann Kendal, his executrix and residuary legatee, \u00a33000 in trust for her son. All the legatees were enjoined to receive their legacies at his house in Norton, over a large bowl of punch, on the 1st of March next after his death ; and thev were required yearly to commemorate that day as long as they lived, it being the day he escaped from slavery. \u2014 Hutchinson, vol. iii. p. 112.

He was educated at Oxford, where he was made Fellow of Magdalen College in 1488. On entering into holv orders, he became famous for his great learning, piety, and gravity. He was constituted president of the above college about 1504, and took the degree of B. A. three years afterwards. Among other prefer ments, besides the vicarage of Norton, he received the mastership of St. Cross Hospital, near Winchester, 1505; the rectory of West Mongton, Somersetshire, 1506; and the prebendship of Whitchurch, in the ca thedral church of Wells. At the desire of Richard Fox, bishop of Winchester, he left the presidentship of Magdalen College, and was by him made the .first president of Corpus Christi College, then newly esta blished, 1516 ; the deficiency of emolument being compensated by tbe rich rectory of Clyve, Glocestershire. He resigned the living of Norton in 1518, reserving to himself a yearly pension from it of 20 marks, to be paid by the abbot and convent of Selby, Yorkshire. \" He was a person of great gravity, of most exact ex ample in his life and conversation, very charitable and devout, and had nothing wanting in him to complete a theologist.\" He published \" Not\u00e6 & Observationes in Plinii Naturalem Historian*! ;\" and left in MS. \"Comment, in Auli Gelii Noctes Atticas,\" \"Com. in Plautum,\" \" Epistol\u00e6 ad Simon.

A marble stone, with an inscription, provided by himself, was laid over his grave.

School. \u2014 The school in this parish appears to have been founded as early as the year 1650, from which period certain lands have been held for the support thereof under the bishop of Durham, leases thereof hav ing been granted from time to time for three lives. The property belonging to this charity at the time of the Commissioners' Inquiry consisted of the following particulars : \u2014 \u00a3. s. d. A dwelling-house, garden, and school-room in Norton, occupied by the master rent-free.

Christopher Anstey, the yearly rent of ... ... ... ... ... ... 2 10 0 The Hermitage Garth, containing 1.} rood, let to William Wilkinson, at the yearly rent of 0 15 0 The premises above mentioned, excepting those in the occupation of the schoolmaster (and from whom these were derived is not known), appear to be tbe whole of what are com- prised in the bishop's lease. The following were derived from a grant of Lord Crewe in 1720 :\u2014 Two fields in Darlington Lane, containing about 5 acres, let with the Lady Close, as above mentioned, to James Freeman. About 2 acres of meadow land in \" The Bottom,\" let to Ralph Stoddart at the yearly rent of 5 0 0 A cottage and garden in Norton Street, let to the same tenant at the yearly rent of ...6 6 0 Total annual income ... ... \u00a340 1 0 All these premises are let to yearly tenants, and at fair rents. In respect of the emoluments derived from the sources above mentioned, the master is required to teach six boys of the parish, appointed by the vicar, without any charge.

The Commissioners report that the school was then much reduced in numbers from what it had been formerly; a circumstance which it seems was to be attributed entirely to the misconduct of the Rev. John Pattison, then master. It is now, however, gradually reviving under the mastership of his successor, the Rev. John Parker. Thompson's Charity. \u2014 In the Parliamentary Returns of 1786, it is stated that John Thompson, by deed, in tbe 1st Geo. I., gave to the poor, and for upholding and maintaining the church at Norton, land then vested in Thomas Smith, John Hogg, and John Burdon, and producing \u00a36, 3s. per annum. After passing through the hands of various intermediate trustees, this property is now held in the name of Thomas Jefferson Hogg, of the Temple, barrister. The premises consist of a field near the town of Norton, containing about four acres, let to Colonel Grey, as yearly tenant, at a good rent of \u00a318; and two other closes, containing together about five or six acres, let to George Smith, as yearly tenant, at a good rent of \u00a312. The rent of the close first mentioned has, as long as can be remembered, been carried to the account of the church-rate, and the rent of the latter to the account of the poor's rate. Snowdon's Charily. \u2014 John Snowdon, by will, date unknown, gave to the poor ofthe parish of Norton, to be transferred to the vicar and churchwardens, \u00a3100 three per cent, reduced annuities, the interest to be divided amongst four decayed housekeepers belonging to tbe parish. The sum of \u00a3100 three per cent, re duced now stands in the names of the Rev. Christopher Anstey, deceased, John Hogg, Thomas Robinson Grey, and John Grey. The dividends are received by Messrs. Clarke and Bailey, solicitors, of Stockton, and paid over to the vicar and churchwardens, who divide the amount amongst five or more poor widows of shoemakers. Blakiston. The manor of Blakiston stands on the north-western verge of Norton parish, adjoining Thorp and Wynyard. The old hall was taken down many years ago, and the materials sold at Stockton. The scite was near the road, with deep meadows on the west, and some broken ground falling ra pidly to the Thorp beck. AVilliam de Carilepho, bishop of Durham, in 1093 granted the manor of Blakiston to the prior and monks of Durham. Bishop Flambard disseised them of this possession, then called Bleches ton, and granted it to his nephew, Richard (ancestor of Fitz-Marmadukc). The monks com plained ; and, feeling compunction on his death-bed, the bishop was borne in his last moments on his couch into the cathedral, and made restitution by the ceremony of offering his gold ring on the high altar. King Henry I. confirmed this possession, with an especial warranty against Richard, \"that I,\" said the king, \"be no more afflicted with the clamour of the monks.\" The convent granted the estate, under certain reserved rents, to the family of Park. Galfrid. del Park, of Blakiston, is mentioned in 1264. About 1320, Richard de Park, lord of Blakiston, founded a private chapel here.* His son Richard, in 1341, alienated to Roger de Blakiston (in one evi dence most plainly Roger the Cook) a messuage, five oxgangs of arable, and the meadow which he * He gave, for the souls of himself, bis wife Amice, and their successors, to God and St. Mary, and the cha pel of the Holy Trinity in Blakiston (by consent of the prior of Durham, chief lord of the fee), and to John dc Blaykeston (the first mentioned of that name), chaplain, and to all his successors, four oxgangs and seven acres, and a toft and croft, with their meadows, in Blakeston, which Richard de Oveton some time held, and four acres which Robert Trigg held, and ten acres which Germanus of Norton held, and an acre and a half which Walter the Mower held for term of life ; to celebrate matins and all canonical hours daily, and mass, viz. requiem three times ; and on the other days the mass of the Arirgin, with placebo and dirige.

At the same time, he released to Hugh Blaykeston (the direct an cestor of the family) the messuage which he held in Blakiston, and 6s. rent. On Tuesday in Passion-week, 1349, a fine was levied, between Roger de Blakeston ancl John Fitz-Roger, of Herdewyke, complainants, and Richard de Park and Christian his wife, deforceants, of six mes suages, 200 acres of land, 12 acres of meadow, 200 acres of pasture, a moiety of a messuage, and a mill, with their appurtenances, in Blakiston.* The manor continued in this family, -f- which gradually advanced in wealth and importance, till the time of William Blakiston, who married Alice, daughter of William Claxton, of AVynyard, Esq., November 26, 1581 ; and was knighted at AVhitehall July 23, 1603. His son, Sir Thomas Blakiston, was created a baronet in 1615, and sold the estate in the same year, after it had be longed to his ancestors for a series of 300 years. \\ Alexander Davison, merchant, of Newcastle, purchased Blakiston. He was charged with a horse, &c. for the king, was afterwards knighted, and lost his life at the age of 81, during the gallant defence of Newcastle, together with Joseph Davison, his youngest son. His eldest son, Thomas Davison, Esq., who inherited his father's spirit and loyalty, compounded for his estates for _fl412. He was afterwards knighted; and, on the Restoration, was made high sheriff of Durham. He died May 23, 1667- His grandson, Thomas Davison, of Blakiston, Esq., married Anne, daughter of Sir John Bland, of Kippax, co. York ; and afterwards Theophila, daughter of Charles Turner, of Kirkleatham, Esq. Thomas Davison, Esq., eldest son of the above by his first wife, married Martha, daughter of AVilliam Hoar, of Limehouse, by whom he had issue Thomas, born January 8, 1744-5, who took the additional name of Bland (which has since been borne by his descendants), and resided at Kippax Park in Yorkshire. The manor of Blakiston was sold, above 30 years ago, to William Russell, of Brancepeth Castle, Esq., whose grandson, AVilliam Russell, Esq., M. P., is the present proprietor. PARISH OF STOCKTON. The parish of Stockton, which was divided from Norton by act of parliament in 1711, is bounded by the latter parish on the east and north, by Elton, Long Newton, and Egglescliff'e on the west and south-west, and by the Tees on the south and south-east, It includes four constableries, viz. 1. The Borough of Stockton ; 2. The Copyhold Township of Stockton ; 3. East Hartburn ; and, * Long after, in the reign of Edward IA^., Edward Park, Esq., the lineal representative of the ancient lords of Blakiston, in vain endeavoured to recover the estate by suit in the court of the prior of Durham, chief lord of the fee, against the Blakistons. t Marmaduke Blakiston, a younger son of Thomas Blakiston, of Blakiston, Esq., was attainted in the rebellion of the earls in 1569. Sir AVilliam Blakiston, second baronet, and son of Sir Thomas, was a colonel in the service of King Charles I. He refused to compound for his estates, and afterwards underwent a long imprisonment in Maxtoke Castle, Warwickshire. His estates, valued at \u00a3600 per annum, were restored at the Restoration. The title expired in him ; but numerous families of the same name had descended from the younger branches of the original stock. VOL. H. E"], [22, "STOCKTON AATARD.\u2014 S. AV. D. 12 4. Preston-on-Tees. The population of this parish, in 1801, was 4177 persons; which number, in 1811, had risen to 4406. In 1821, there were 9?6 houses, inhabited by 1158 families, Comprising 5184 individuals. Of these families, 105 were employed chiefly in agriculture, and 456 in trade, manufactures, or handicraft ; tlie remaining 597 being either engaged in professional pursuits, or unemployed. The annual value of property in the parish of Stockton was estimated for the county-rate, for the year ending January 12, 1829, at \u00a3*15,951, 10s. Stockton. The town of Stockton forms two distinct constableries, one called the Borough, and the other the Town. The former comprehends that part of the town in which all the property is freehold ; and the latter comprises the houses and streets that have been added at different times to the ori ginal town, and are copyhold or leasehold under the vicar and vestrymen, not included within the jurisdiction of the Borough. But, though these districts have each a constable, the same church wardens and overseers of the poor act for both, as they form but one township. The origin of Stockton cannot now be ascertained, and its early history is involved in deep ob scurity ; but its antiquity may be inferred from its giving name to one of the Wards of the county. Mr. Brewster, in his History of Stockton, says, \" AVhether the town of Stockton derives its origin from its vicinity to the Castle, or whether the Castle was erected there for the convenience of the town, is neither easy nor material to determine. It is most probable, however, that this, as well as many other towns and villages in similar situations, was built for the protection afforded by the Castle in those times of feudal tyranny, when the inferior inhabitants of this country, from the de pressed state of their minds, and the severity of unequal laws, were not able to protect themselves.\" It has been conjectured that the Castle and manor of Stockton belonged, about the time of the Conquest, to some of the Norman barons, by whom they were given to the see of Durham ; as, although a member of the wapentake of Sadberge, this place was part of the possessions of the see before the purchase of that earldom. But the earliest authentic description of the bishop's manor here is in Boldon Book, to the following effect : \u2014 There were eleven villains and a half in Stockton, each holding two oxgangs of land ; their rents and services being the same as the villains of Boldon, except cornage. There were also six who held nine oxgangs of land in farm, performed tlieir services, and paid as those of Norton. Adam, the son of AV alter, held one carucate and one oxgang of land, rendering a mark in silver. AVil liam de Tumba held four oxgangs for half a mark, and one oxgang by favour of the bishop, and was free from work whilst he continued in the bishop's service, but when out of that service, was to work in proportion to half a carucate of Walter's lands. Robert held the hull toft near to his house, paying 16d. Elwin and Robert, cottagers, paid 12d. for two tofts; and Goderine, the cot tager, 6d. Suane, the smith, paid 4d. for a toft. The punder had six acres and his thraves in Stockton, Hartburn, ancl Preston, as others, and rendered fourscore hens and 500 eggs. The pas sage of the river produced 20d. The whole vill provided a milch cow. The bishop held an ox gang of land on the other side of Tees, opposite to the hall, which rendered 4s. In Hatfield's Survey is a very particular account both of the Borough and manor.

Tenants without the Borough: \u2014 Richard Brantingham, souter, dwelling in Auckland, held half a burgage for life, did suit of court once in three weeks, and paid for each omission 6d. and Id. at the four terms. John Collesson and John AVorksall held each a burgage by 6d. and 8d. rent respectively. John Alverton, fysher, dwelling in Alverton, and seven others, each held halves of burgages as above. John at Towneshend and Thomas Dobynson, neifs of the lord, held the one half, the other the fourth ofa burgage. John Tose in Sedgefield, and twenty two others, held fourths of burgages.

The Castle. It is not known whether the scite of the ancient Castle of Stockton was ever occupied by the Romans ; though, about 40 years ago, a coin of Nero Claudius C\u00e6sar, who invaded Britain about the year 59, was found when digging the foundation of a quay, near the spot where the Castle wall joined the river. This structure is said to have been of great strength, and to have been built by one of the kings of England, after which it became the occasional residence of the bishops of Durham. In Boldon Book, however, it is merely called \"The Hall; and, in Hatfield's Survey, \" The Manor-house.\"* AVhilst Richard I. was preparing for the crusades, Hugh Pudsey, the munificent but ambitious bishop of Durham, inflamed with the zeal of the times, \" after the exam ple of many other prelates, also took upon him the vow and the cross, and on his part levied money for the expedition. He built for his own use a beautiful galley [either at Stockton or Hartlepool] for his passage, together with several other ships to transport his troops, retinue, and attendants.\" But the king persuaded him to waive his intended journey, and remain at home, where he officiated as regent for the north of England during the absence of King Richard. Philip de Poictou, the next bishop of Durham, was particularly attached to King John, whom he is said to have enter tained on a visit at Stockton Castle, where John afterwards granted a charter to the burgesses of Newcastle, dated \" Stockton, February 5th, 1214.\" Bishop Farnham made Stockton almost his constant residence for eight years, and died here in 1257, previous to which he had \"abandoned * \" The term of Castle,\" says Surtees, \" as applied to Middleham, Auckland, and Stockton, seems the? courtesy of later times. The early charters are universally Apud Stockton, or in Manerio nostro, &c.\""], [25, "STOCKTON. 15 his bishopricke voluntarily ; and contentinge himselfe with three good manors of that see, Hoveden, Easington, and Stockton, betoke himself to contemplacon.\"* Bishop Kellow rebuilt the Castle or Manor-house at Stockton in a very elegant manner.-}- The residence of later prelates at Stockton was merely occasional, though this edifice received some repairs from Bishop Barnes in 1578. In the summer of 1597. Bishop Matthew lay here to avoid the plague, which raged at Durham ; and, in that year, part of Stockton Castle was accidentally burned. Dr. Morton was the last bishop of Durham who resided at Stockton, whence he fled into Yorkshire, after the defeat of the king's army by the Scots at Newburn. The Castle remained for some time in possession of the royalists, and seems to have been consi dered as a post of considerable strength and consequence, guarding one main passage from the bishopric into Yorkshire. \" His majesty,\" says Rushw-orth, \" did deliberate about the increase of his forces at Stockton Castle, a place of great importance, situate on the river of Tees, the border of the bishopric and Yorkshire, in regard the Scots had brought in more men to Newcastle, and placed more at Durham than were at the beginning of the treaty. However, to avoid all suspicion and jealousy, his majesty was pleased to waive those intentions.\" According to the articles agreed upon betwixt the English and Scotch commissioners at Rippon, concerning the cessation of hostili ties, the river Tees was fixed upon as the line of demarkation for the two armies, \" excepting al ways the town and Castle of Stockton, and the village of Eggscliff'e,\" which were still to be occupied by the king's garrison.]: Stockton is not recorded to have stood any siege; as, indeed, the town was neither walled nor defensible ; but the Earl of Callender appears to have taken possession of it for the parliament in 1644. In the following year, it was delivered up to the English by the Scots, on the latter receiv ing their recompence for the blood of Charles I. ;\u00a7 and, in 1647, parliament ordered the Castle of Stockton to be totally slighted and dismantled. It did not, therefore, fall a sacrifice to the ra vages of time, but to the distracted state of the kingdom. The order of parliament for the sale of the bishop's lands brought it into the hands of private persons, who appear to have demolished it for the sale of the materials, with which some of the stone houses in the town are said to have been built.

An imaginary draught of the elevation of the Castle, previous to its demolition, is given in Brewster's History of Stockton. It commanded the old passage of the river, near the Water Gate. A sort of embattled cow-house,* just on the north of the road to Tees bridge, marks the exact scite. The large squared stones and ancient masonry in the south-western angle of this erection, prove that it has actually formed part of the Castle-barn, or of some other office or out house. The Castle has been moated, and the agger and fosse may be distinctly traced. The road from Stockton to Tees bridge lies in the western moat, a little rivulet from St. John's Well runs through the southern fosse, a row of cottage houses is built in the eastern, and a garden, the walls of which are evidently built out of the squared stones of the Castle, rises out of the northern ditch. Within this square there is not a stone of the foundations to be seen.-f- This inclosure is still called the Park ; and by the side of the road to the bridge a walk was made about 30 years ago by subscription, and planted with trees by George Sutton, Esq.j The bailiff of the Borough was also keeper of the Castle, with the territories, gardens, and orchards belonging to it, and was allowed pasture, herbage, and hay, within the pastures of the bishop, for two horses and ten cows; together with a patent fee of \u00a36, 13s. 4d. per annum, and other profits, advantages, and emoluments of place.

In the reign of Queen Elizabeth, there were 72 bo rough-holders in Stockton ; and from that period it does not appear that the town either increased in trade or celebrity for many years, but is said to have shown symptoms of decay. In the year 1602, Nicholas Fleatham, mayor, and the burgesses of Stockton, petitioned Tobias Matthew, VOL. II. \u2014 27. G"], [30, "STOCKTON AVARD.\u2014 S. AV. D. 20 bishop of Durham, for a renewal of the charter granted by Anthony Beke, for a market and fair, which they represent had been for many years discontinued. This charter, dated 4th June, 44th of Elizabeth, was, no doubt, the means of infusing new life and vigour amongst the inhabitants, whose commerce had for some time been nearly extinct ; and, shortly afterwards, they disputed with the bishop the right of receiving duties from ships coming into the port for anchorage and plankage. A decree of the bishop's court of chancery, in 1620, determined the dispute in favour of the bishop, and proved that the anchorage and plankage duties were paid in the time of Henry Yl., and that there was a staith or quay in the outer court of the bishop's Castle at Stockton, at which ships coming into the port arrived, and that the said staith or quay had decayed within two or three years last past. From this period the town continued to rise gradually in the scale of prosperity to that degree of eminence which its situation on a navigable river demanded ; and, on the 24th of April, 1666, it obtained a charter from Bishop Cosin, for a fair and market, similar to those granted by Bishops Beke and Matthew. On the establishment of tranquillity, after the great rebellion, it is represented that there were \" diverse large and spacious fields and parcels of ground lying and being within the township territories of Stockton, which lay in common and un divided.\" The enclosure of these wastes* created a spirit of improvement in the town, which has ever since rapidly increased in population. The Borough is governed by a mayor, recorder, and aldermen. There are at present six of the latter; but the exact number requisite to complete the body corporate does not appear to be de termined. The mayor is elected, on the first Tuesday after the 29th of September, by a majority of the burgesses or owners of houses, buildings, &c. of burgage tenures in the town. It is not necessary, as in most other corporations, that the person elected to the office of mayor should be first chosen an alderman ; for it does not appear that the latter title was anciently known in this corporation, it being formerly distinguished by the style of \" mayor and burgesses,\" &c. ; but hav ing been once elected into the office of mayor, he afterwards becomes one of the body now called aldermen, and so remains as long as he continues in the possession of burgage property. The mayor, by virtue of his office, is in the commission of the peace, and also a justice of the court of pleas at Durham, during his mayoralty.

Every Court-day, of which there are generally two in each year, a jury is impannelled to try petty causes within the Borough, in the usual manner of holding courts leet and courts baron, which should always be held within a month of Easter and Michaelmas. The Borough court is held in the Town Hall, and the copyhold, or halmote court, at an inn. A greve or bailiff' is ap pointed by the bishop, and the recorder of Stockton is generally the steward of his courts leet and baron.* The revenues of the corporation arise from the rents of houses, &c, which are generally held under the bishop's lease ; and from the Custom House, the Town Hall, and the Shambles, together with the tolls of the market, which belong to them. The emoluments arising from the anchorage and plankage lease (originally granted by Bishop Neile, on the decision in 1620, to Rowland AVetherall) are also now vested in the hands of the corporation, upon trust, that they apply and dispose of them in making and repairing the public streets and pavements, or for other public uses, \" in such manner as the mayor, aldermen, and burgesses, from time to time to be assembled at the courts to be held for the Borough, or the major part of them, should direct, appoint, or ap prove.\" Out of these rents the expenses of the corporation are paid, and _C30 per annum is allowed to the mayor towards the expenses of his mayoralty, which greatly exceed this sum. Though the number of the owners of burgages is continually varying, there are only 72 borough rights, which are laid down on the old plan, preserved amongst the corporation records ; and on one section (near No. 45) a memorandum states, \" This is the thing in question, and has never had a Borough right.\" These Borough rights consist of a certain portion of ground, with the * In 1824, a piece of plate, value \u00a3100, was presented to Leonard Raisbeck, Esq., recorder, as a token of approbation of his conduct in that office."], [32, "STOCKTON AVARD.\u2014 S.W.

In the course of time, he removed to London, and practised with success ; and his first introduction to the city was by the office of remembrancer. He was sheriff in 1768, an alderman shortly afterwards, and attained the highest honours ofthe city in 1770. He was then in parliament, and was first brought into conflict with the government of the day, by refusing to back the press warrants, which until this period were current in the city. But he was soon engaged in a more immediate personal struggle with the House of Commons. The Speaker had issued his warrant against the printers of two periodical papers (the Gazetteer and the Middlesex Journal), on a charge of misrepresenting the speeches of certain members of the house. The printers, refusing to attend at the bar, were secured under a royal proclamation (offering a reward for their apprehension) ; but on being brought before the sitting aldermen, AVilkes and Oliver, were discharged, and even bound over to prosecute the per son who made the capture. Meanwhile, Miller, the printer of the London Evening Post, similarly circum stanced, was taken into custody by a messenger from the house; and the serjeant-at-arms came to the Mansion-house to demand the bodies of both printer and publisher, who had appealed to the lord mayor. His lordship asked the messenger whether he had applied to a magistrate to back the warrant, or to any peace-officer of the city to assist him ; and on receiving a reply in the negative, informed him, \" that as long as he held that high office, he was the guardian of his fellow citizens' liberties, and that no power on earth should seize a citizen of London without authority from him or some other magistrate ofthe franchise;\" and declaring Miller at liberty, he made out his warrant to commit the messenger for an assault and false im prisonment. The commitment was signed by Crosby, mayor ; and, at the request of Miller's counsel, by Wilkes and Oliver also. The serjeant-at-arms bailed the messenger. The House of Commons ordered the lord mayor and Alderman Oliver to attend in their places (together with Alderman Wilkes), to answer for withstanding the execution of the warrant. Oliver was voted to the custody of the lieutenant of the Tower on the 25th March ; and, two days after, on a division of 202 to 39, the lord mayor was committed to the same place. On this occasion, it was moved (to shew the tender mercy of the house) that, in consequence of his bad state of health, he should only be committed to the custody of the serjeant-at-arms; when Crosby immediately rose and said, \"An honourable gentleman has talked ofthe lenity to be shewn me on account of my health, and my being only committed to the custody of the serjeant at-arms. I know that I was prejudged on Monday, and that the string of resolutions and warrants is now in the gentleman's pocket. I ask no fa\\'our of this house \u2014 I crave no merev from the treasury bench \u2014 I am ready to go to my noble friend in the Tower, if the house shall order me. My conscience is clear, and tells me that 1 have kept my oath, and done my duty to the city of which I have the honour to be chief magis trate, and to my country. I will never betray the privileges of the citizens nor the rights of the people. I have no apology to make for having acted uprightly, and I fear not any resentment in consequence of such conduct. I will through life continue to obey the dictates of honour and conscience, to give my utmost sup port to every part of the constitution of the kingdom, and the event I shall always leave to heaven, at all times ready to r-eet my fate.\" Tlie committal of the lord mayor was an event of peculiar and extraordinary importance to the city, and was felt in every part ofthe kingdom. Addresses and congratulations poured in from all parts, praising the firmness, decision, aud patriotism ofthe chief magistrate. His lordship remained in prison until tbe proro- gation of parliament ; when he left the Tower, accompanied by Alderman Oliver, under the discharge of 21 pieces of cannon belonging to the Artillery Company, and passed along Tower Street, and straight through the city, with a procession of 53 can i iges in his train. At night, the city was illuminated. On the conclusion of his year, the lord mayor received the thanks of the corporation, and a splendid silver cup, value \u00a3200, which still remains in the possession of his family. The feeling of the nation was unequivocally shewn on this occa- sion ; and it is not too much to say, that \" the manly stand which he made against the whole power of <to-. vernment, in defence ofthe rights and franchises of which he was the protector, forms an important epoch in the history of the liberties of England \u2014 for, ever since that period, the proceedings and debates in parlia- ment have been regularly printed and published, which before they were not, and the British empire ia"], [33, "STOCKTON. 23 Present State of Stockton. The town of Stockton is situated 242 miles north-north-west from London, 20 miles south-south east from Durham, 27 miles south from Sunderland, 11 miles east-north-east from Darlington, and 4 miles north-north-east from Yarm. The size and population of this town have increased pro gressively with its commerce. At the Restoration (1660), it was so despicable a place, that the best house in it could\" hardly boast of any thing better than clay walls and a thatched roof; and it contained only 120 families. At a muster of militia on Chester Moor, the proportion of men furnished by Stockton was nine. In 1666, this town contained 136 families, poor and rich. In 1692, there were 350 families; and, in 1725, 430 families, besides the poor. During the last cen tury, the increase has been rapid. In 1780, there were 1040 householders; and in 1794, 3614 in habitants, exclusive of Portrack, Preston, and Hartburn. In 1821, the population of this town was 5006, being an increase during the preceding 27 years of 1392 souls, averaging yearly during that period an augmentation of nearly 52 persons. The High Street of Stockton is 'JO yards broad, and has a very handsome appearance. The first order for paving occurs l'Jl'J, and soon after an order for making two pumps. In I7I8, an order appears \" that all the whole Borough from the common channels shall be paved ; that a smith's shop adjoining the Toll-booth shall be purchased, and that the moneys which shall yearly come to the Borough shall be laid out in paving.\" The last thatched house in Stockton was pulled down in 1788.* The east side of the High Street was flagged in 1810, and the west side in 1812. On this side stood the oldest house in Stockton, well known by the name of \" The Blue Posts,''' with the date 1485 on the front. -j- It was taken down in 1811, and the ancient stone posts added thereby in possession of an inestimable advantage, for which Crosby deserves to be pointed out in grateful remembrance, and to hold a distinguished place in the annals of his country.\" Mr. Crosby was thrice married. The foundation of his ample fortunes has been attributed to his first marriage with the widow of \u2014 AValraven, a rich salesman and dealer in seamen's tickets. After her death, he again entered into wedlock with the relict of \u2014 Coombe, collar-maker to the Ordnance. In 1772, he led to the altar, as his third bride, Mary, the daughter of Mr. James Mead, a wealthy merchant of London, and widow of the Bev. \u2014 Tattersall, of Gatton, in Surrey. AVith this lady he had the manor of Chellsfield Court, in Kent. Alderman Crosby was President of Bethlem and Bridewell Hospitals, Governor of the Irish Society, A'ice-president of London AVorkhouse, and Chairman of the four principal City Committees. He died February 14, 1793, in Chatham Place, and was buried with considerable pomp in Chellsfield church. His large property, for he had no surviving issue by any of his wives at the time of his death, was, with the exception of several small legacies and annuities, which were to devolve on the decease of the parties to the hospitals of Bethlem and Bridewell, divided amongst his five sisters or their children. A good portrait of this patriotic and distinguished magistrate is placed in the Irish Committee-room, Guildhall. \u2014 Memoir qf Brass Crosby, Esq. \u2014 Surtees' Durham, vol. iii. p. 196. * On August 8, 1792, a bag, containing a large quantity of silver coin, was found bv some workmen em ployed in pulling down a house belonging to Mr. Crow, adjoining the Black Lion inn. It contained a regu lar series from Edward AT to James II. , and many of them were in good preservation. They were supposed to have been concealed at the Revolution, and were claimed as treasure-trove, 840 of them (weighing 9 lb. 4 0?.) being delivered to the bishop of Durham, as lord of the manor. Several other coins and tokens have also been found here. S t This was the family-house of the Burdens. A house west of the church, which belonged to a branch of the Burdons whose heiress married AVebster, is inscribed \" H\u00e6c domus \u0153dijicata suit, Anno Domini 1671- \" A house in Thistle Green has the date 1692. $11 the stone buildings are, perhaps without exception, reared out of the ruins of the Castle.

The breadth of this street (which is about three-quarters of a mile long), the beauty of the buildings, and its extreme cleanliness, render it the most handsome in the north of England Several smaller streets branch from the High Street eastwards towards the river. The first is Castle Gate and Cottage Row. The next is Finkle Street, adjoining to which is the Playhouse Yard, leading into Silver Street and Bishop Street ; and at the bottom of these is a small square, called Thistle Green. East of the church is a spacious Green, now planted with trees and shrubs. It was inclosed with wood rails in 1803; and, in 1822, these were succeeded by a paling of iron. Tlie vicarage and other good houses range along the north side of the square. A row of houses, with gardens, extends to the east (Paradise Row) on the scite of an old ropery. A lane leads from the east side of the square to Smithfield,* near the water side, which is terminated by Cleve land Row, so called from its commanding an admirable prospect of the Yorkshire hills. House u-ife Lane, on the south of the square, leads to the river ; and Cherry Lane, once a garden, communicates with Thistle Green. Along the side of the Tees, and forming a kind of crescent, are a great many good houses, quays, wharfs, granaries, bond and other warehouses, breweries, manufactories, steam-engines, ship-building and timber-yards, &c. On the west side of the High Street are several new and regularly built streets. The first on the north are named SmitKs Street and Atkinson's Street. Dovecot Street and Ramsgate succeed; and Park Row runs from the southern extremity of the main street along the Darlington road. The west ends of the three last named avenues are connected by a range of houses called the West Row ,* adjoining which, and running in a parallel direction, are Brunswick Street, Skinner Street, &c. The New Walk, extending from the town to the bridge by the Castle Field or Park, is a plea sant promenade, and much frequented at all seasons of the year. It is inclosed and kept in good order ; though its rural effect is now somewhat destroyed by the railway. In 1820, an act was obtained and put in force for watching, paving, and lighting the town ; by which the commissioners are also invested with power to remove nuisances, &c. The Gas Works are situated at the south end of the High Street, where they were erected under the authority of an act of parliament, in 1822, at the cost of \u00a3\"5000. The front of the building is of brick, with stone pilasters and coping, forming an ornamental termination to the street. The town is now well lighted with vapour luminaries, supplied by 12 retorts, from a gasometer of the dimensions of 12,000 cubic feet. The greater part of the inhabitants are provided with excellent water from a spring near the bridge, called St. John's Well. There is also a house containing a cold bath ; but it is not noted for any peculiar qualities. The Church. Stockton was originally parcel of the parish of Norton, and contained a chapel of ease, which stood near the centre of the old church-yard, south of the present church. A flat marble slab, without inscription, which is said to have been in the chancel of the chapel, marks its situation. The passage which led to the chapel from the High Street, though now built up, may be traced by two houses with their gables to the street, and whose fronts still form a lane. * From the residence of the anchor-smiths ; or from a family of the name of Smith, who were the princi pal proprietors."], [35, "STOCKTON. \u25a025 The ordination of the chapel of Stockton bears date under Bishop Poor, before 1237. The vicar agrees to find an officiating chaplain, and the parishioners shall have in their said chapel of Stockton baptism, burial, and all ecclesiastical rights; they shall visit their mother church on the Feast of the Assumption, ancl shall pay to the vicar 50s. at four terms. On every Lord's Day the parishioners shall offer one penny with the consecrated bread, except when they attend the mother church. Bishop Farnham, after his resignation of the see of Durham, gave four oxgangs and the toft and croft which belonged to Matildis de Cumba, to the chapel of St. Thomas the Martyr, in Stockton; and Bishop Kirkham ratified the donation. (See Hatfield's Survey, page 14.) There appears also to have been a free chantry heie, dedicated to the Alrgin Mary. Shortly before the dissolution, William Baynbrigg gave the third of an oxgang to provide two wax-lights to burn before the altar of St. Thomas-a-Becket. In 1548, the whole revenues of the chapel amounted to \u00a35, 3s. 6d. per annum. Yet this poor pittance was not reserved under the new establishment for the maintenance of a chaplain, but was seized by the crown, and granted out to individuals. A memorandum in the Harleian MSS. says, \"The chappell of Stoketon standeth a myle from the p'yshe churche, not only for easment of th' inhabitants of the towne of Stoketon, but also for th' easment of divers p'ishioners of sundrie other p'ishes in the winter tyme, when for rayny fludes they can come none wher els to here devyne ser- vice.\" The premises were ordered to be leased to AVilliam Croston, of London, for 21 years, at \u00a3?8 rent.

D. 26 Stockton chapel being by length of time ruinous, and much too small, and the inhabitants grow ing every day more numerous, the building of a new church became necessary. On September 2, 1705, the Rev. T. Rudd preached a sermon on the subject from 2 Sam. vii. 2, \" See noio I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth ivithin curtains ,*\" and when the brief was read, May 21, 1710, he preached on Exod. xxv. 8, \" Let them build me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them.\"\" The foundation-stone was laid June 5, 1710; and the structure was consecrated by Lord Crewe, August 21, 1712. The expense of the building was \u00a31577 . the whole sum collected was \u00a31625, 13s. 9d. \u00a3550 was collected on the brief, \u00a383 on the brief in Stockton, \u00a340 in Nor ton and Blakiston, the justices ofthe county \u00a3267, l^e bishop \u00a3100, and divers private subscrip tions, &c. In the 12th year of Queen Anne, I'Jll, an act of parliament was obtained to make Stockton, with East Hartburn and Preston, a distinct and separate parish from Norton. The act states, that Stockton is an ancient corporation and borough, and by reason of its situation upon a naviga ble river not far from the sea, becoming a place of good trade and commerce, and very populous, instead of a ruinous chapel, the inhabitants had built a beautiful new church upon a parcel of the waste of the manor, near to the place where the ancient chapel stood, &c. It was thereby enacted, that there should be a vicar to have the care of souls of the inhabitants of such parish of Stockton, and a perpetual succession of vicars there, to have capacity and succession by the name of the vicar of the parish church of Stockton upon Tees, and be enabled to sue and be sued in that name in all courts and places of this realm, and should have and enjoy all tithes, offerings, oblations, obventions, mortuaries, and other ecclesiastical benefits. That the patronage of the vicarage should belong to the bishops of Durham, and that they exercise all ecclesiastical jurisdiction within that parish ; and that the inhabitants be subject to the customs and usages for the choice of churchwardens, overseers of the poor, surveyors of the highways, constables, and other like parish officers, as they had theretofore been. That there should be twelve vestry-men, to be chosen and have succession as therein directed, for the better raising and ascertaining future taxes, assess ments, and contributions, for discharging debts contracted about building the church, buying bells, keeping the same in repair, and defraying the yearly expenses of churchwardens, and paying \u00a3100 to the inhabitants of Norton in discharge of all contributions towards Norton church, all cesses and taxes to the parish of Norton, as for expenses touching the obtaining the said act. Then fol low the rules for choosing the first vestry-men, to continue in office for the term of three years, with the method of electing successors in case of death, and at the end of every three years a new set of vestry. men. And the act directs that the minister, churchwardens, and vestry-men assem bled, or the major part of them, should make by-laws, rules, orders, and directions for the good of the parish and better government thereof, the same to be ratified and confirmed by two justices of the peace for the county ; and should from time to time rate, tax, and assess all lands, tenements, houses, and personal estate in the said parish, as the major part of them should think just and reasonable, towards discharging the matters before noted, for building a vestry-room, and making other improvements about the church, and keeping the same in repair; and for raising a yearly sum, not exceeding \u00a320, to be paid to the vicar for the time being, as an augmentation of his in come ; to be collected by the churchwardens, and, if need requires, to be levied by distress and sale, by warrant from two justices, with right of appeal to the quarter sessions by persons ag grieved, where the same should be finally determined, and costs awarded. The lord bishop was thereby impowered to grant to the vicar, without any fine, a parcel of waste ground near the alms."], [37, "STOCKTON. 27 bouse, of the yearly value of \u00a320 or thereabouts, and any other waste ground in the manor, not exceeding the yearly value of \u00a320. And it was thereby also enacted, that the vicar should hold the parcel of waste ground adjoining to the church-yard on the east side thereof, the same being intended for a place for a house to be built upon for the vicar. And the vicar was thereby im powered to take lands, not exceeding \u00a3100 a year, over and above the lands and provisions before stated ; and was directed to bear and pay a third part of first fruits, tenths, procurations, and synodals for the parish of Norton. In the first year of George I., 1714, an act was obtained to explain and make more effectual the act of Queen Anne, whereby the vicar for the time being was invested with power to demise the waste grounds granted as before mentioned. The church is situated on the east side of the High Street, and is a spacious, convenient struc- ture of brick, with copings of freestone to the doors and windows. Its length, including the tower and chancel, is 150 feet ; and its breadth 67- The height to the middle of the roof is 40 feet. The tower at the west end is 80 feet high, and has a set of six bells. A clock and chimes were added in 1736, the tunes of which were altered in 1819- These are now removed, and a new clock, with chimes, have been put up during the present year (1832). There are five square pil- lars, supporting circular arches, on each side of the nave of the church, the whole of which is re- gularly stalled with oak ; and the reading-desk and pulpit are of handsome workmanship. The west gallery was erected in 1719, and an excellent organ was placed in it in 17-59. The north gallery was added in 1748, and the south gallery in 1827-* The whole of the side windows are modern sashes under circular arches; besides which there are skylights in the roof over the galle- ries.

A plot of ground, adjoining the church on the east, was originally intended for the building of a vicarage-house ; but a house was afterwards purchased on the north side of the ground so allot ted. Bishop Chandler left \u00a3200 for this purpose, Lord Crewe's trustees gave \u00a350, and \u00a380 was raised by the sale of bricks which had been prepared for building on the allotment. The parson age was repaired and enlarged by the Rev. C. Anstey in 1783. The waste granted by the bishop for the augmentation of the living, called Thistle Green, and now containing Workhouse Street and Silver Street, was leased out, by the vicar and vestry, for a thousand years, under the following reserved ground-rents : \u2014 \u00a3. s. d. \u00a3. s. d. 27 Aug. 1716, lease to James Cook -13 0 0 Same date, lease to John Cook - - 4 5 0 Same date, lease to David Douthwaite 6 2 0 Same date, lease to AVilliam Peacock -400 Same date, lease to Jonathan AVatson- 2 12 6 Brought forward - 29 19 6 4 Mar. 1719, lease to Cuthbert Hodgson 2 7 6 20 April, 1719, lease to Jona.

Large sums have been expended by the lessees in building and otherwise improving the premises, and valuable considerations were paid by persons purchasing under the first lessees. The Rev. AV. N. Darnell attempted to invalidate these leases, on the grounds that the provision partook of the nature of a charity, that the vicar and vestry-men were merely trustees, and that the leases were in effect a total alienation, and therefore a breach of trust, and that only building leases for a term usual in such cases were in the contemplation of the legislature. The case was first heard before the ATice-Chancellor, Sir Thomas Plumer, in April, 1817, who held the leases good. In November, 1821, the cause was heard on appeal before the Lord Chancellor, who con firmed the former opinion ; observing, however, that he conceived the legislature had given a more extensive power than they intended ; but that as the terms of the act had been complied with, he could not cut down the leases, especially after they had been acquiesced in for upwards of a century. Chapels. The Roman Catholic Chapel is a plain brick building, situated in the Playhouse Yard, a most inconvenient part of the town, near the quay side ; and the approach to it is awkward and dis agreeable. The Rev. J. Dugdale, from Ushaw College, is the resident pastor. The house be longing to the place is not occupied by him, having been let on lease at the time when no resident priest was at Stockton. It was intended to attempt the building of a new chapel and residence in a more appropriate situation ; but, probably from the want of funds, this plan is for the present abandoned, and the old chapel is now receiving some improvement by being enlarged towards the east, and the erection of a small gallery at the west end. The number of communicants is about 70 ; and there is a considerable extent of country placed under the pastoral eare of the reverend gentleman stationed here. The Baptist Chapel, in AArest Row, was originally built for a warehouse, but was converted into a chapel in 1809, and is now under the ministry of the Rev. William Leno*. This sect had"], [41, "STOCKTON. 31 formerly another meeting-house in another part of the town, at which the Rev. D. Fernie, who died in 1790, for many years officiated. The Independent Chapel, also in AVest Row, was erected in 1815, at the cost of about \u00a3500, the principal contributor to which was Mr. Henry Beckwith. It is a neat building, and will ac commodate about 300 hearers. The Rev. G. Newton at present officiates as minister here, but is not as yet regularly placed. Wesleyan Methodist Chapel. \u2014 The Rev. John A\\resley first preached at Stockton on August 16, 1748, since when his followers have continued to increase till they have become here, as in many other towns in' England, the most numerous sect of Dissenters, if it be proper so to designate them. Their first chapel was rebuilt in 1813. The present edifice is situated in Brunswick Street. The foundation-stone was laid March 16, 1823, by Richaid AValker, Esq., assisted by J. Wilkin- son, Esq., mayor; and the chapel was opened on the 31st December in the same year, when col- lections were made amounting to upwards of \u00a3200. It is 20 yards long and 18 broad, and will accommodate 1200 hearers. A Sunday-school and two dwelling-houses for the ministers are at tached ; and the whole forms a neat, substantial edifice, and ranks as one of the principal orna ments of the town. Though destitute of fanciful decorations, it has a simple elegance and majesty in its appearance, which is more in unison with the object of its erection, than if profusely adorned with architectural beauties.* Primitive Methodist Chapel. \u2014 This sect met for some time in a room in Playhouse Yard ; and their first camp-meeting here was held on St. Swithin's day, 1821. The present chapel, erected in 1825, is situated in Maritime Street, Smithfield, and will contain about 350 persons. Unitarian Chapel. \u2014 The Unitarians appear to have met here at the close of the 17th century ; the Rev. John Thompson being ordained their minister in 1688, and for whom a meeting-house was built in 1699- He was succeeded, in 1729, by his son, the Rev. John Thompson ; who was followed, in 1753, by the Rev. A. Blakie. The present chapel, a neat and comfortable building, was erected on the scite of the old one, at the north end of the High Street, in 1756. The Rev. B. Evans became minister here in 1785, the Rev. Robert Marr in 1792, and the Rev. S. Kennady in 1803. The Rev. J. C. Meeke, who succeeded in 1821, has been followed by the Rev. C. Nut tar, the present pastor. The congregation is not numerous, but respectable and intelligent.

The Workhouse, situated at the corner of the street to which it gives name, is the receptacle of the paupers of the parish, who are lodged, fed, and clothed in it, under the direction of a master and mistress, at the average weekly cost of 3s. lOd. each for all above 10 years of age, and 3s. 6d. for those below it.

Alms-houses. \u2014 From the Parliamentary Returns of 1786, the alms-houses appear to have been founded by Margaret Bailey, John Stope, Matthew AViggoner, and James Cook. The date of this foundation, though stated in these Returns to have been 1708, was probably 1682. The only endowment which can be traced is under the will of James Cook, dated December 29, 1702, whereby he bequeaths \u00a3100 to be paid to the mayor, vicar, and overseers of tbe poor of Stockton, to be placed out at interest at five per cent., or laid out in the purchase of lands or tenements, the yearly produce thereof to be by them distributed amongst the needy and poor people that should dwell in the alms-houses of the said town of Stockton, for their better support and maintenance ; but in case the said town or parish should not allow the said poor people the yearly charity or assessments which had been usually given and collected for them out of tbe said town and parish, the same should be repaid to bis executors, or their executors, administrators, or assigns ; and he ap pointed John Cook and Lucy Dalston, his son and daughter, his executors. By indenture, November 27, 1732, it was stated that the sum of \u00a3100 given by James Cook was in the hands of the said John Cook, who alone proved the will, and took upon himself the executorship, and that he died insolvent ; that the said Lucy Dalston was advised that she was not liable to the said legacy, or any part thereof, but was willing to give tbe sum of \u00a350 to be applied for the purposes directed by the will of the said James Cook, and that the said mayor, and vicar, and the churchwardens, had agreed to accept the same ; and that the said \u00a350 should be paid to Ralph Bunting in part of a sum of \u00a3200 payable out of the leasehold premises belonging to the Charity School. No interest on this sum of \u00a350 has been paid from the funds of the school for several years ; but when the payment was discontinued, or whether the principal was ever paid off, cannot now be ascertained, the old accounts being lost. George Brown, Esq., who was also a benefactor to the school, by his will, dated February 16, 1811, be queathed to George AVelbank and others, \u00a33000, to be applied in rebuilding these alms-houses. With this sum a new building was erected in 1816, consisting of 36 apartments for the alms-people, and a committee room and dispensary. It is in the Gothic style, fronting the High Street, and forms a handsome ornament to the town. The alms-people are appointed by the vestry. Charily School. \u2014 This school was instituted by voluntary subscription in 1721, when it was resolved that a school should be taken as near the church as possible ; that a master* should be appointed, with a salary of \u00a320, to instruct 2(1 boys to read, write, and cast accounts ; that the boys should be of the parish of Stockton, and approved of by the majority of the trustees at their meetings of five or more, whereof the mayor, vicar, or treasurer for the time being, should be one, and that the said boys should be clothed; 19 of \u2022 \" Mem.

In 1729, tbe trustees purchased the leasehold interest in two closes of meadow-land called Lustram and Elwick-mire, situate in the town-fields of Stockton, which were held under lease from the bishop of Durham, for three lives, for the sum of \u00a3670, under a reserved rent of \u00a35, 3s. 4d. Towards this purchase, the sum of \u00a3200, mentioned under the preceding head, was borrowed from Ralph Bunting, Esq. On May 24. 1824, the Right Rev. Shute, Lord Bishop of Durham, renewed the lease of this property for the lives of Isaac Ste- phenson, aged 22, Samuel Stephenson, aged 16, and Joseph Pease, aged 25 years, at the yearly rent of \u00a35. The fine upon this renewal was \u00a31080, 7s- 4d., from which the bishop made a donation to the school of i 7t>0. In 1772, a further purchase was made, for \u00a31635, of six copyhold closes adjoining the town of Stockton, and containing by estimation 26 A. 2 r. 31 p. \u00a31205 of the above sum was advanced by Frances Stapylton. In 1809, Richard AValker, the surviving trustee, sold two of the closes for a sum of about \u00a31200 ; at which time, it is stated, the sum remaining due in respect ofthe money borrowed for the purchase was paid off. The pecuniary legacies and donations to this establishment since the year 1721, out of which funds the purchase-money of the estates above mentioned was derived, have amounted, as appears from a table of be nefactions in tbe church, to the sum of \u00a32686, 10s.

The school is supplied with books, stationery, and materials for the girls' work. AVith a few exceptions, which will be noticed, the charity is conducted according to certain rules agreed upon in 1814, by which it is provided that every benefactor of \u00a35, 5s., and every annual sub scriber of \u00a31, Is., should be deemed a trustee ; that a select committee should be chosen every year, consist ing of five trustees; and that the vicar, the mayor, and treasurer, should always be of the number; that such committee should visit the school as often as they should see occasion, particularly at Easter and Mi chaelmas, to fill up vacancies; that 20 boys and 20 girls ofthe parish of Stockton should be clothed accord ing to the old rules ; no child to be taken under 7, or above 1 1 years of age, and to continue there to the age of 14 : that the vacancies should be filled up from the general school, preference being given to merit. \u00a3The number of children clothed is now increased to 40 boys and 40 girls.] That all children who should conti nue in the school their full time and behave themselves well, and then go out to some honest employment, should have a Bible and Prayer Book, and 40s. in money given to them, under certain regulations therein mentioned.

That in the morning and evening, prayers, extracted from the Liturgy of the Church of England, should be read in the school. That the master, with the scholars, should attend divine service every Sunday, Wednesday, and Friday, and other holidays. That the school should be taught on the Madras system, and that the regulations established in the Barrington school at Auckland should be adopted. One of the subscribers is appointed annually to act as treasurer, and the accounts of his receipts and dis bursements are submitted to the inspection of the other trustees. The present handsome school-house, which was completed in 1816, is 56 feet by 32, 18 feet high, has 10 large windows, is well ventilated, and has an excellent inclosed garden and play-ground adjoining. Jenkins's Charily. \u2014 Major John Jenkins,* in 1661, bequeathed 52s. per annum to the poor of Stockton, to be paid every Sabbath-day 12d. in white bread. This sum is paid to the churchwardens by the owners of certain lands in the parish of Stockton ; and 12 penny loaves are provided every Sunday, which are given to poor widows who attend divine service. Bunting's Charily.\u2014 Elizabeth Bunting, by will, July 14, 1765, gave \u00a3300 to the vicar and churchwar dens of the parish of Stockton, the prodnce of which was to be distributed amongst such poor housekeepers living in the town of Stoekton, who should not receive any allowance from tlie said parish, and as should be thought and approved of as fit objects to partake of the same- The personal estate of the said Elizabeth Bunting being insufficient for the payment of her debts, the said legacy was declared to be void by a decree ofthe Court of Chancery, February 25, 1772; but George Hartley and Ann his wife, being determined to perpetuate the said charitable donation, with that view invested a like sum in the purchase of \u00a3378, 13s. 6d. three per cent, consols, in the names of Ralph Bradley and AVilliam Hoare, who has taken the surname of Harland. Tlie dividends, amounting to \u00a311, 7s- per annum, are transmitted by Mr. Harland to the vicar, and he distributes the amount amongst poor persons resident in the town of Stockton, and not receiving pa rochial relief, in sums varying in general from 10s. to 20s , and in some cases to 40s. A book is kept, con taining au account ofthe persons to whom he distributes this money.

Two of the latter bequests have already fallen to the school ; and the stock now stands in the names of George Hutchinson, John Hutchinson, and Leonard Raisbeck. In respect of the legacy of \u00a3500 left for the female^benefit club, whereof the testator's wife and I\\lrs. Sleigh were the patronesses, \u00a315 per annum is paid to the treasurer of that club. The yearly sum of \u00a33, in respect of the legacy of \u00a3100, is re-invested from time to time for the benefit of the other female club in Stockton ; and on this account there was in January, 1829, \u00a3130, 17s, 8d. three per cent, consols standing in the names of Thomas R.

The dividends in respect of the residue, \u00a3600 stock, are divided equally, and paid over to the treasurers of three male benefit clubs still existing. Mr. Sutton also bequeathed to the late Mrs. Sutton s Blanket Fund, the interest of \u00a3200 five per cent. consols; to the Dispensary, while that establishment shall continue, the interest of \u00a3300 three per cent. consols; to the Sunday-school, the interest of \u00a3100 do.; to the School of Industry, the interest of \u00a3300 do. ; as an addition to the stipend of the organist (interest to accumulate for 20 years), \u00a3400 do. ; towards enclosing a burying-ground, if purchased within six years from the testator's death, \u00a3600 do. ; towards pav- ing, lighting, and improving the town, if an act of parliament be procured within five years from his death, \u00a3200; and to the Bible Society, \u00a3100. Gibson's Charity. \u2014 Thomas Gibson bequeathed to the poor of East Hartburn \u00a320, the interest thereof to be distributed to them in white bread every Lord's Day, at the communion table in Stockton church, or failing them, to the other poor there present. This sum appears to have been carried to the account of the church-rate, as 20s. is paid thereout yearly, and disposed of in bread to the poor of the township of East Hart burn, who attend divine service, if there is a sufficient number, and if not, to other poor persons. Benevolent and Literary Institutions, &,-c. The Dispensary, which affords medical and surgical aid to the afflicted poor, occupies part of the Workhouse, where it was established above 30 years ago, since which it has been the means of relieving and restoring to health many hundreds of the distressed objects of its bounty. The gentlemen of the faculty give their attendance ; and the house apothecary receives a salary for dis pensing medicines and receiving patients on two or three days in each week, and for attending at their own houses the patients who are not able to leave home. A Society for tlie Relief of Lying-in Women was commenced in 1817- -4 Society for the Sup pression of Vagrancy and Mendicity has also been established for some months, which has tended very considerably to remove beggars, &c. from the streets; at the same time that it affords food and lodging to the poor and deserving traveller. ATarious other societies for the relief of the sick and distressed exist in Stockton. Grammar School. \u2014 In 1785, a spacious room was built by subscription, in the AArest Row, for a Grammar School. The ground on which the building is erected is leased to thc corporation from the bishop of Durham. The master usually receives an allowance. of =\u00a320 per annum from the corporation, on condition of teaching boys recommended by the mayor. The School of Industry, in Castlegate, was established in 1803, for educating and clothing fe males free of expense. It is supported by voluntary contributions ; and there are generally' near 40 children under tuition. Sunday-schools are established in the National School-room and in most of the chapels of the town, at which above 500 children are instructed in the rudiments of learning. Stockton also eon. VOL. II.

James Cundill, vicar; and there are, besides, a number of day-schools for children of both sexes. An auxiliary Bible Society was commenced in Stockton in 1812. Missionary and other socie ties, for the promotion of religious knowledge, are also supported by the Church and Dissenting congregations. Benefit Societies. \u2014 To provide a certain pecuniary aid against the hour of sickness and debility, there are in this town about a dozen associations formed amongst the operatives, tradesmen, and others, for the support of their members, who are required to contribute from 2d. to 4d. per week to their respective funds. One of these associations is composed of about 50 females, and the others comprehend upwards of 600 males. (See Suttoii's Charities.) The Savings Bank, for Stockton and the neighbourhood, ranks amongst the provident institu tions in this town, *and is held in a room at the Alms-houses, in the High Street, where it was established in 1816, and is now open everyr Wednesday from twelve to one o'clock. It is under the direction of twelve trustees. In November, 1827, no fewer than 857 persons had deposits in this bank, amounting to .\u00a325,418, 18s. 2^d. ; and its funds continue to increase. Thc Stockton, Yarm, and Norton Institution for the Instruction of Mechanics and for the Pro motion of uses ul Knowledge, established April 11, 1825, is in the possession of a valuable library of several hundred volumes, besides a variety of apparatus and mechanical instruments, and a col lection of minerals. This useful institution occupies a large room in Mason's Court. A general meeting is held on the first Thursday in every month, for the discussion of literary, philosophical, and scientific subjects, &c. ; but the library is open weekly. Adults pay a yearly subscription of 12s., but apprentices only half that sum. The Subscription Library, at Mr. John Ellerby's, High Street, was established July 5, 1791, and now contains above a thousand useful and interesting volumes, connected with nearly all the depart ments of literature. There are about 70 members, each of whom contributes 16s. per annum, besides two guineas as purchase-money at entrance. The business of the institution is under the direction of a committee; and Mr. Nathan Thompson, of the Customs, is the present treasurer. The Church Library, established in 1800, is kept in the vestry, and consists principally of works on Divinity. The Unitarians have also a library in their chapel ; and there are four Circulating Libraries, where most of the popular novels of the day may be had. The Subscription News Room, in the Town Hall, is well supplied with London and country journals ; and any stranger may be admitted on being introduced by a subscriber.* * In the history of the literature of Stockton, tbe name of Joseph Ritson will ever hold a conspicuous place. This distinguished English critic and collector was born here October 2, 1752. His father, Joseph Ritson, was descended from an ancient family of yeomanry who had long held lands at Hackthorpe, in AVestmoreland. Ritson's destination was the law, and he was placed with Ralph Bradley, Esq., an eminent conveyancer in Stockton. After some years, he entered of Grey's Inn, where he was called to the bar, and continued a member of that society until his death. He practised exclusively as a conveyancer; and his talents, accuracy, and integrity, secured him a high professional character, and might have led to wealth; but ancient English poetry, rhyme, and ballad, and the drama, had more charms for him than the law, and he contented himself with a very moderate share of business, merely sufficient to eke out a small private in come. In the then little explored treasures of the British Museum, and the Bodleian Library, he found subjects congenial to his taste ; and he also paid considerable attention to ancient English history. Thouo-h he did not profess to be an author, yet the introductory \" Dissertation\" to his Ancient Songs and Metrical Romances, the \" Life and Notes\" to Robin Hood, and several other illustrative essays, evinced the depth of his researches into early English literature.

The Town Hall, or Town House, erected in 1735, and enlarged when the old Toll-booth was taken down in I'J^, occupies the centre of the High Street, the effect of which it is thought by some to destroy. It is, however, a large, handsome, and commodious structure, forming a square, with Dr. Percy, whom he accused of having forged the greater part of his \"Reliques,\" he displayed an indefen- sible asperity, which caused him to be represented as a cynic and misanthrope in private life. His temper was indeed somewhat irritable, and perhaps influenced by an early disappointment ; and he had adopted \"peculiar ideas, both as to religious and civil government.\" But he was neither morose nor unsocial, his friendships were steady and lasting, and if tenacious of his own opinions, he was at least most tolerant of those of others. He abstained, on a principle of humanity, from animal food, and published a book in de- fence of his sentiments on this head. Amongst other peculiarities, he adopted a singular orthography, which he intended should give every word, root, and derivative its full due. In London, his daily walk from his chambers to the Museum almost bounded his rambles; and his summer vacations were mostly spent with his only sister at Stockton, or occasionally his relatives in AVestmoreland. In 1791, he visited Paris, accom- panied by his old and early friend, AVilliam Shield, Esq. ; and, on one occasion at least, visited the late Sir Walter Scott at Laswade, whose \" Border Minstrelsy,\" then newly published, was to Ritson's mind an epi- curean banquet. Sir Walter, in a letter to a friend, gives the following testimony to his virtues : \u2014 \" I loved poor Ritson, with all his singularities ; he was always kind and indulgent to me. He had an honesty of principle about him, which, if it went to ridiculous extremities, was still respectable from the soundness of the foundation. I don't believe the world could have made Ritson say the thing he did not think. I wish we had his like at present.\" Ritson's constitution was naturally delicate, and was perhaps further weakened by the extreme abstinence which he had imposed upon himself. He suffered repeated attacks of apoplexy ; and a final stroke carried him off, after a fortnight's illness, on September 23, 1803. He had for some years held the official situation of \" High Bailiff of the Liberty of Savoy,\" and, at one time possessed a competent fortune; but, though he detested gaming, he had speculated with nearly his all in the funds, and the revulsion consequent upon the peace of Amiens swept away most of his capital. He was therefore under the necessity of selling by auction a part of his valuable library; on which occasion, \"The Seven Sages of Greece, Edinb. 1578,\" sold for \u00a331, 10s., no other copy being known to exist; \" Bibliographia Scotica,\" a MS. intended for publication, \u00a345, 3s.; and Shakspeare, by Johnson and Steevens, with three vols. of MS. notes by Ritson, \u00a3110. After his death, his nephew, Joseph Frank, Esq., to whom his attention had been parental, reluctantly disposed of the remainder of his library. The following catalogue of Ritson's publications was communicated to Robert Surtees, Esq., by the gen- tleman just mentioned : \u2014 \" Verses addressed to the Ladies of Stockton, first printed in the Newcastle Mis- cellany, 1772,\" 8vo. \u2014 \" The Descent of the Crown of England \\jn three Tables printed on one Sheet], 1778, 1783.\" \u2014 \" The St*ckt*n Jubilee; or, Shakspeare in all his glory.

It contains an assembly-room, a court-room, a news-room, a tavern kept by the town's serjeant, and other suitable apartments for the use of the town. The principal entrance is on the south, over which are the arms of the town cut in stone. On the north, a handsome piazza, erected in I768 for the accommodation of the market-people, stretches along the lower story, above which is a regular range of the assembly--room windows. Mr. Brewster remarks that the style of this edifice produces an effect similar to that of some of the buildings in Holland ; and it may be added that the neat order in which it is kept by the corporation, may vie with any thing of the kind in that country, so celebrated for its cleanliness. In I768, an old covered cross in the market-place was removed, and the present handsome Doric Column, 33 feet high, erected on its scite, a little to the south of the Town Hall. The Shambles. \u2014 Shambles were erected for the butchers in Stockton in I768, which the corpo- ration came to a resolution of rebuildins in 1821. The foundation-stone of the new erection was laid June 21, 1823, and the work carried on for a few days, when it was levelled by order ofa party in opposition to the measure. It was again begun, and again demolished ; and, in the fol lowing year, counsel was heard at the Town Hall on both sides, when a verdict was given in fa vour of the projected improvement, and notice of appeal laid in by the oppositionists. The work, however, proceeded, and the building was completed and opened in June, 1825. It is of brick, one story high, with stone copings along the tops of the walls and windows; and its interior ar rangements are convenient. It must be confessed, however, that the beauty of the High Street, in the centre of which it stands, is decidedly injured by it. The Custom-house. \u2014 The first Custom-house in Stockton, on the removal of the officers from Har tlepool in 1680, was situated in the Red Lion Inn Yard, whence it was removed in 1696 to the foot of Finkle Street. In 1730, the corporation built a new Custom-house there, on the scite of the old one. In 1828, the present building was erected further to the north, but still near the quay, \"for the ease of merchants and the despatch of business.\" Its interior is commodious, and the princi pal room is well lighted from a dome in the roof. Several good warehouses for wet and dry goods are attached.

The boat-house and adjoining ground were conveyed to the mayor and burgesses. The bridge is an elegant structure, consisting of five arches. The span of the centre arch is 72 feet, and it is 23 feet high from low- water mark : the two next are 60 feet in span, and the end arches 44. The passage for carriages is 18 feet broad ; and there is a raised pavement of three feet for foot-passengers, who, as well as carriages, &c. for- merly paid toll each way. It was built by subscription, and cost =\u00a38000, the subscribers being entitled to interest not exceeding five per cent. In 1792, the tolls were let for \u00a3*702; and, in 1814, for \u00a3-1005. In 1817, they were reduced to ,\u00a3900, principally on account of the discontinu- ance of the races. The act provided, that when the incumbrances should be discharged, and a sufficient purchase of land made as an equivalent for the bishop of Durham's rent, the bridge should become free, and be repaired at the equal charges of the county of Durham and the North Riding of Yorkshire. The debt was cleared off August 2, 1816; and, in 1819, a mob, under the impression that the passage of the bridge should consequently be free, attacked the gates, two of which they threw into the river, and carried a third in triumph about the town. The tolls, how ever, ceased January 1, 1820; and the purchases for the bishop were completed in July, 1821, having been effected by the produce of the tolls after the debt was discharged, as directed by the act. The Toll-house has since been greatly improved, and is much frequented as a public house. Markets, internal Trade, fye. The various charters granting a Market to Stockton have already been mentioned. It is held on tlie AVednesdays, and abundantly stored with all kinds of grain, butcher's meat, fish, poultry, butter, eggs, vegetables, &c, and attended by a host of hawkers, with their different sorts of wares. Another w*ell supplied market is held on the Saturdays.* A Fair is held here annually, according to ancient charter, on the 18th of July ; and Statutes for hiring servants on the two last AVednes day^ before the 13th May and the 23d of November. Fairs for the sale of cattle, sheep, &c, established 1811, were also held on the last Wednesday of every month; but, in 1830, it was found necessary to shorten that interval, and hold them once a fortnight. At an annual Agricul tural Cattle Show, prizes are distributed to those who produce the best bred stock. In 1785, the Tees Bank was established by Henry Hutchinson, Esq.; and which existed until December, 1825, when it stopped payment. Another, the Stockton and Cleveland Bank, failed July 25, 1815. The establishments now existing in Stockton are, the Commercial Bank (Messrs. Skinner and Co.), commenced in 1815; and a branch from Messrs. Backhouse and Co.'s Bank, Darlington, opened in 1826. A Joint Stock Bank was also incorporated here in 1831. -f- * Several riots, on account of the high price of corn, occurred at Stockton in the year 1740; and some of the offenders were transported for seven years to America. t In 1666, John Wells, a Stockton tradesman, issued tokens. The obverse had the king's head, with long hair, a* la Cavalier, crowned, \"Gon save the king;\" reverse, \"john wells, 1666, in Stockton.\" These and similar tradesmen's tokens, put in circulation for convenience, were called in on the issue of government halfpence and farthings in 1672. In 1812, Messrs. Christopher and Jennett, of Stockton, issued copper tokens of one penny value; and, during the scarcity of silver coin in 1813, the same gentlemen issued sixpenny and one shilling silver tokens. In 1818, paper tokens, value 2s. 6d. and 5s., were put in circulation in Stockton. vol. ii.\u2014 28. M"], [52, "40 STOCKTON WARD.\u2014 S. AV. D. The manufactures here are linen, sail-cloth, worsted, thread, &c. Mr. Jasper Whitfield, who carried on an extensive business as a damask-weaver, has recently resigned ; and his premises are occupied by his son, as a sail-cloth manufactory. There is a ship-building yard at Smithfield, belonging to Henry Markham, Esq. ; and another at Cottage Row End, the property of AV. H. Mellanby, Esq. The vessels built here are of the first class, and many of them of heavy burthen. Mr. Andrew Brown carries on a large iron and brass foundery at the north end of the High Street ; and Mr. Thomas Jackson another in the West Row. There is a manufactory for rolling and smelting lead, belonging to Mr. Stark, close to the river. Mr. Thomas A. Tennant and Mr. Ro bert AVilson each have roperies here. There are five corn-mills in Stockton ; which also contains about 40 hotels, inns, and public houses, and three breweries ;* also four porter-merchants and seven spirit-merchants. Here are nine or ten attorneys' offices,**}- five coal-fitters, five printers and booksellers, with a number ofthe shopkeepers, grocers, flour-dealers, drapers, tailors, shoemakers, dress-makers, joiners, wrights, smiths, turners, &c. necessary for the population of the place. J A mail-coach commenced running through Stockton to Sunderland and Shields on September 6, 1806. The hours of its arrival and departure were adapted to the alterations made in the arrange ments ofthe north mail; but, during the present year (1832), it has been discontinued, and the letters, Sic. are now brought from Darlington in a gig. Conveyances may be had daily to all parts of the kingdom. Post-chaises, hack horses, and vehicles of various descriptions, are kept at the different inns; and the passage to the western parts of the county has been rendered cheap and pleasant by the opening of the Stockton and Darlington Railway. The township of Stockton includes several farms\u00a7 and corn-mills. Mr. Robert AVilson has a brick and tile manufactory at the Tile Shades; and there is a ropery at St. Anne's Hill. * \" The ale brew'd in this town is very famous, and becomes a grateful present often from the gentry to their friends in London.\" \u2014 Magna Britannia et Hibernia, Antiqua \u00a7 Nova, 1720, vol. i. p. 610. f In vol. i. page 498, will be found the monumental inscription of Ralph Bradley, Esq., who was born at Greatham, September 2, 1717- He was called to the bar by the society of Grey's Inn, but soon after set tled at Stockton, and confined himself almost exclusively to the practice of conveyancing ; from his reputa tion in which, and his retired habits, he increased his small paternal estate to \u00a340,000. After deducting certain legacies, he devised the bulk of this property to trustees, to place certain sums of it in the public funds, there to accumulate till January 6, 1860, when the whole was to be applied to the purchase of such books as \" promote the interests of virtue and religion, and the happiness of mankind.\" On the deci sion of the Lord Chancellor, after Mr. Bradley's death, his fortune devolved on Joseph Yeal of Greatham ; his two sisters, viz. Margaret Parkin, of the same place, widow, and Sarah Yeal, of London ; and Mary, wife of John Sutton, of Stockton, Esq., and daughter of Edmund Bunting, of the same place, Esq., his first cousin. X March 20. 1821, a newly-erected steam-mill for grinding corn, belonging to Mr. C. Cooke, of Stockton, was discovered to be on fire ; and the whole of the building except tbe engine-house, together with a quanl tity of corn and flour, were destroyed. \u2014 In 1823, the mustard manufactory belonging to Mr. Musgrave was entirely consumed by fire. \u00a7 In 1736, potatoes were first planted in this neighbourhood by Thomas Baker; and he allowed none but his son to see the process. Mr. Brewster claims the gratitude of posterity for this person ; but whatever may have been the results of the experiment, the secresy with which it was \"attempted to be effected repels any assumption of patriotism or philanthropy in the motives of the individual by whom it was made."], [53, "STOCKTON. 41 River, Port, Shipping, Commerce, fye. The River Tees is the source of the growing prosperity of Stockton. The tide reaches no higher than Worsal, about three miles above Yarm, which is, by the course of the river, about 20 miles from the sea. When the river approaches Stockton, the shore becomes very low, and tlie stream continues winding. In its approximation to the ocean, from Portrack, the Tees expands into a large bay, which is about three miles across, and at the mouth is a little contracted by a tongue of land, called Seaton Snook, from which a bar of sand stretches across the estuary to the Cleveland coast, near Coatham and Redcar. At spring tides, about 10 or 12 feet is the depth on the bar at low water, and from 26 to 28 feet at high water. In neap tides, about 12 feet is the depth at low water, and 22 feet at high water, at the same point. The bay or estuary of the Tees is a place of great safety for ships in stormy seasons ; and many vessels, which are not concerned in the trade of the river, enter it for shelter. A mile below Portrack, on the Yorkshire coast is Newport, where there is a commodious quay, staiths, and granaries ; below which, on the same side of the river, is Cargo-fleet, or Cleveland-port, where many of the larger vessels load and unload by means of smaller craft from Stockton. From the rapidity of its upper course, and from the numeious streams which it receives from hill and moorland, this river often rises suddenly in flood,* and passes the low level shores, which scarcely confine its downward current. Stockton, standing upon elevated ground, suffers little on these occasions ; but the opposite low Yorkshire grounds are frequently inundated, and the ship ping are often driven from their moorings. -f*- In 1784, the Tees was frozen over near Stockton, when a sheep was roasted whole upon it. In 175-5, after the breaking up of the ice in the river, which had been closed for five weeks, a consequent flood did considerable damage ; and on De cember 15, 1819, the Tees was again frozen over, and continued in that state for an equal length of time. \" The whole course of the Tees,\" says Surtees, \" is winding ; but the curve of the river at Port rack was so extraordinary, that the course of the river during this inflection measured two miles and upwards, whilst the neck of the peninsula was only 220 yards. It had been frequently pro posed to cut through this neck of land, and considerable exertions were made for that purpose by AVilliam Sleigh, Esq., then mayor of Stockton, in 1791- The planj was, however, reluctantly abandoned at that time, but was resumed in 1802, under the management of gentlemen engaged in, or materially connected with, the trade of the place. \" The plan adopted was to raise a sufficient capital by subscription shares of =\u00a350 each, and to obtain an act to form the subscribers into a corporation or company. A capital of .\u00a35000 (which it was presumed would, prove adequate to carry the plan into effect) was readily procured; and, * There was a person appointed formerly, whose business was to warn the water ; i. e. to give the inha bitants of the lower vales of Tees timely notice when the river reached Nesham in flood. t On January 23, 1796, Thomas Hutchinson drove out of the Tees to the sea in an open boat, and was picked up next day near Holy Island. The boat sunk a few minutes after he was taken out. This circum stance has been commemorated by a native poet, in stanzas of no common merit. \u2014 In the same year, another boat drove to sea, with only an oid man and an old woman on board. The boat was found next day floating near Whitby, and the aged pair, both dead, lashed to each other and the mast. X The plan was originally proposed, several years before, by Mr. Edmund Harvey, of Stockton, pewterer, who constructed a tin model of his intended canal."], [54, "STOCKTON WARD.\u2014 S. AV. D. 42 on calculations founded on the entries and clearances of vessels at the Custom-house, it appeared that duties, at the rates afterwards inserted in the bill, would produce \u00a3735 per ann., which it was expected would cover the annual disbursements, and allow a dividend of 10 per cent, (the maxi mum proposed to the subscribers.*) Some unforeseen circumstances retarded the progress of the measure, particularly the opposition of the late Lord Harewood, who was owner of Mandale-mill and granary, on the Yorkshire side, at the very extremity of the curve formed by the then wind ino* course of the Tees. This property his lordship conceived would be so much injured by the proposed cut, that he declared his intention of opposing the bill in parliament. After five years of unsuccessful negotiation for a compromise, the subscribers resolved, in 1808, to push their bill in opposition to Lord Harewood's influence. Pending its progress in parliament, however, an agree ment was concluded, by which Lord Harewood consented to withdraw his opposition on condition of receiving ,\u00a32000 when the cut should be made navigable. The bill passed in 1808 ; the exca vation was executed under contracts with different undertakers; and the new channel was opened for vessels September 18, 1810.f The expenses much exceeded the original estimate, and includ ing the cost of the act, the purchase of land, and other contingencies, amounted to .\u00a39300; and there has since been disbursed, in jetties and other works, about ,\u00a32400. Towards meeting this excess, as well as to discharge the obligation to Lord Harewood, 80 additional shares were created under the powers of the act, and the deficiency was supplied by the appropriation of the duties as they accrued.\" The act incorporates the subscribers by the title of \" The Tees Navigation Company,\" ancl not only authorizes the making of the cut, but also the cleansing, deepening, straightening, and other wise improving the navigation of the river between the bridge at Stockton and the sea, giving most ample powers for these purposes. It enables them to levy the following duties on all vessels lad ing or unlading cargoes in the river Tees : \u2014 For every British vessel entering or clearing coastwise, * The committee, November 26, 1802, state in effect that \"all vessels laden for Stockton, which, from causes frequently unavoidable, discharge their loading at Cargo-fleet, Middlebrough, Newport, or Portrack, are obliged to send their goods to the wharf in the river boats, from whence frequent injuries, &c., and vice versa as to goods conveyed from Stockton down the river to vessels lying at or below Portrack. Sometimes the boats in the winter months are prevented getting down for several days. A tide is frequently lost in attempting to navigate the crooked channel of the river ; for the wind most favourable from the sea to Port rack is direct contrary for a considerable portion of the course from Portrack to Stockton ; every vessel of 200 tons and upwards, built at Stockton, is obliged to be tracked down the river to Portrack. The ready admission of the flood-tide will accelerate the time of high water at Stockton half an hour, and the ready discharge of the ebb-tide will prevent the accumulation of ice, and scour the channel from the sands which obstruct the navigation. The river thus deepened will admit laden vessels of 160 or 200 tons burthen to come up from sea to Stockton, and deliver their cargoes at the wharf, when the wind is favourable, in one tide.\" t The opening of the cut was commemorated at Stockton by public rejoicings. The morning was ushered in by the ringing of bells. At half past seven, three sloops, decorated with flags, &c, proceeded from Port rack through the canal, attended by the volunteer band of music, the custom-house boat, the Redcar life boat, and a numerous assemblage of pleasure-boats, &c. Several guns were fired from the vessels, as each entered into and went out of the canal, which were returned by guns placed on the quays at Stockton. AVhen the sloops arrived at that place, the company's flag (most elegantly designed) was taken down from the mast-head of the sloop which came up first, and conveyed through the street, preceded by the band of nuisic after which it was placed on the top of the cupola on the Town Hall. At twelve o'clock, the workmen were regaled with meat and drink ; and at two o'clock, 70 gentlemen sat down at the Town Hall to dinner, the volunteer band performing."], [55, "STOCKTON. 43 Gd. per ton; every British vessel to or from a foreign port, 9d. per ton; except such vessel be laden with Norway timber only, then 6d. per ton; every foreign vessel, Is. 6d. per ton; except such foreign vessel be laden with Norway timber only, then ls. per ton.

There are also other duties payable to the Borough : ls. is paid for every 120 deals imported, and 4d. for every 100 bushels of corn. Fisheries. \u2014 The river Tees produces great abundance of excellent fish, such as flounders, eels, smelts, or sparlings, &c. ; but, owing to a large supply of sea-fish, these are seldom to be found in the market. In early times, the fishery on the Tees seems to have been an object of consequence. In 1530, regulations were made for arranging disputes between those using drawing-nets and such as used haling-nets, and for settling the time of taking smelts, sparling, &c. In shallow parts of the river, about Middleton-one-Row and upwards, there is plenty of trout. But the principal fishery is that of salmon, which may be taken in the Tees, according to the act of parliament passed in the 1st of George I., from the 22d of November to the 12th of August, by any of the fishermen, on their paying to the vicar a small sum for each boat, as a tithe of fish. In the spawning season, the salmon proceed up as near to the source of the river as the depth of water will allow, and there deposit their spawn, about the end of autumn, which, in the state of fry, come down in shoals to the salt water, in about a year and a half from the time of spawning. Sea trout go up the river to spawn as far as Barnard Castle, which, by the course of the stream, is at least 30 miles above Dinsdale ; and within this extent the kipper fish might have excellent ground for breeding, if they were protected during the season. The present method of working the lead mines is also consi dered detrimental to the fishery. Near the mouth of the river there is a fishery for cockles, which are gathered on a ridge of sand left dry at ebb tide, near the middle of the stream : large shoals of porpoises also frequent these sand banks, and are supposed to be very injurious to salmon and other fish of inferior size.f * A forest of fruit and other trees was found buried at a great depth in the earth whilst making the excavation. t Parsons and AVhite's Directory, vol. i, p. 314.

Dr. Campbell, in his \"Political Survey of Great Britain,\" published in 1774. says, \"As Liverpool is a port of prodigious commerce, raised to its present flourishing condition since traffic was thought a point worthy of being considered in history ; so Stockton-upon-Tees is a port of no despicable trade, that has started up almost within memory. At the Restoration, it was a village so despicable that the best house in it could hardly boast of any thing better than clay walls and a thatched roof; and yet, near 50 years ago, there came in one year to the port of London, as appears from the Custom-house books, *J5 vessels from thence, and the trade is much increased since.\" In 1815, Stockton wa? made a bonding port for goods enumerated in Table C. of the Ware housing Act; and in 1818, the indulgence was extended to timber; privileges which have proved highly advantageous to the increasing trade of the place. In May, 1832, the Lord Commissioners of his Majesty's Treasury were pleased, by their warrant, to approve of the port of Stockton, as a warehousing port, for sugar, coffee, dried fruits, rice, cheese, or cocoa nuts, either on importation direct, or removal coastwise. These, with the privileges before mentioned, make Stockton a bond ing port for all articles of general merchandise allowed to be warehoused, except tobacco. The goods carried coastwise are chiefly lead, flour, butter, cheese, bacon, oak-timber, linen and linen-yarn, worsted-yarn, alium, &.c. ; and the imports are wine, groceries, fruit, foreign and Bri tish spirits, porter, seeds, hops, and every other article necessary for the consumption of the sur rounding country. * \" One open place 702 feet in length, beginning from tbe south side of Mr. James Cook's key, and so to the north side of Mr. Robert Jackson's key, and in breadth 20 feet from high-water mark. 2.

In 17-56, there was shipped foreign 2431 tons, 10 cwt. 1 qr. ; in 1793, only 310 tons, 3 cwt. 2 qrs. ; but, in 1804, the trade had rallied to 719 tons, 19 cwt. ; and, in 1820, the export was 685 tons, 11 cwt. This trade is now so trifling, that a regular account of it has not latterly been kept at the Custom-house. The exportation of grain also, which in 1749 amounted to 35,400^ quarters of wheat and 5387 quarters of rye, is now discontinued. The chief articles of import are fir timber, wainscot logs, deals, masts, spars, staves, iron, hemp, flax, tallow, oak bark, linseed, clover-seed, raw yarn, hides, &_c. In 1831, 95 vessels arrived from foreign parts, and 17 cleared. The most important alteration and improvement in the trade of this port, however, arise from the facilities now afforded for its participation in the coal-trade. In 1770. there were landed in the port of Stockton, 4096j chaldrons and 65 tons of coals; in 1780, 222 chaldrons and 21 tons; and in 1790, 220s chaldrons and 41f tons. Since the formation of the Stockton and Darlington Railway, ancl the opening of Seaham Har bour, the shipment of coals has increased with unexampled rapidity. The first loading from the Railway was made in January, 1826; and, during the year 1831, 161,123 chaldrons were shipped ; a circumstance which sufficiently accounts for the very great increase in the number of vessels cleared. From the partial stoppage of this trade on the Tyne and Wear, as well as from other causes, the shipment, from January 1, up to September 4, 1832, was 180,000 chaldrons.

The following is a statement of the number of vessels belonging to the port of Stockton, with their tonnage, at the under-mentioned dates: \u2014 January, 1795 ... 47 vessels ... 5730 tons. September 30, 1821 ... 66 vessels ... 6880 54-94ths tons. January, 1827 ... 57 vessels ... 5465 18-94ths tons. January, 1829 ... 74 vessels ... 7296 tons. January, 1832 ... 80 vessels ... 7970 tons. In 1820, the Stockton Shipping Company was established, on the dissolution of the United Shipping Company. The Merchant Shipping Company was remodelled in 1824. Two sets of excellent vessels belonging to these companies (about seven in each), with superior accommodation for passengers, are established in the London trade. One from each set leaves Stockton and Lon don every Sunday morning. There are also regular traders to Hull, Sunderland, Newcastle, Leith, &c* * Amongst the many brave and excellent seamen produced by the port of Stockton, Christopher Allison deserves particular notice. In Entick's History of the AVar is the following passage: \u2014 \"The year (1758) was introduced by the capture of the Machault privateer, of 14 nine-pounders and 182 men, in Dungeness road, on the 1st day of January, by the Adventure armed ship, commanded by Captain Bray for the king, and by Christopher Allison (a native of Stockton) for the owners in contract with government. Captain Bray, in his correspondence with the Admiralty (dated the 2d of Jan.), informs them, that ' while he laid at anchor on the 1st of January, he saw a snow reach in for the Ness, which, at first, he took for a man-of-war, but that he cleared ship, and veered away to the splice on the windlass ; that about two, cut the splice, and made sail large ; that in a few minutes after, they began to fire at each other, when judging that the enemy intended to rake the Adventure, he ordered the helm to be put hard a-port, which had the desired effect of laying her athwart hawse, her bowsprit coming in between his mainsail and mizenmast. That we, he says, passed the end of the mizen topsail sheet through his bobstay, and made it fast ; but fearing to lose such a good opportunity, and that they would get clear, got a hawser, and passed it three times round her bowsprit and the capstan on the quarter deck ; so that the action greatly depended on the small arms, which was very smart about an hour. That she then struck her colours; that she began to fire again, when boarded; but was soon silenced ; having 40 men killed and wounded, whereas the Adventure had but a man killed and two wounded.' \" Captain Bray was rewarded for this service with the command of the Princess Amelia, an 80-gun ship. The principal part ofthe merit ofthe action was, however, claimed by Captain Allison, who, appealing for the truth of his statement to the crew of the vessel, affirmed that he himself, in opposition to the wishes of Captain Bray, put the helm a-port, so as to lay his ship athwart the enemy ; that with his own hands he lashed the vessels together ; and that he headed the boarding party when the enemy struck, but was received by a discharge of small-arms ; during the greater part of which time, Captain Bray and the pilot were in the round-house, which was musket-proof During the latter part of his life, Captain Allison resided at Stock ton, and annually commemorated his exploit on New-year's day by a bowl of punch. He died July 11, 1808, aged 87 years."], [59, "STOCKTON. 47 Tn 1822, the river Tees was first visited by a steam boat; and one was built for the use of the port in 1824. There are now seven belonging to the Tees, and which are chiefly employed in towing ships. Stockton is also visited regularly, during the summer months, by two steam vessels from London, besides others from Hull, Newcastle, and the neighbouring ports, with goods, pas sengers, &c. A life-boat was established at Redcar, near the mouth of the Tees, about 1804, which has often proved highly serviceable to the crews of vessels wrecked on the coast. As a considerable time necessarily often elapsed before either this boat or that at Hartlepool could reach ships in distress on the north side of the Tees, Jonathan Backhouse, Esq., of Darlington, provided a life-boat at his own expense, which is stationed at Seaton-Carew. In 1825, a meeting was held at Stockton for adopting a general system of relief for mariners shipwrecked on the neighbouring coasts, when a considerable subscription was raised for the purpose. Raihvays. \u2014 In the year 1767, a navigable canal was projected, and surveyed by Messrs. Brind- ley and AVhitworth, to pass from Stockton, by Darlington, to AVinston, with collateral branches from Cotham-Stob to Yarm, from Darlington to Croft Bridge, and from Thornton to Piersbrido*e. The expense of this project was calculated at \u00a3)63,722, and estimates were made of the carriage of merchandise, and the products of the country, which greatly flattered the scheme; but, from want of funds, the project was relinquished, without an application to the legislature. In 1812, Mr. John Rennie again made a survey for a canal. In 1822, however, an act of parliament was ob- tained for forming a railway from AVitton Park, three miles west of Bishop-Auckland, by way of Darlington, to Stockton, under the title of \" The Stockton and Darlington Railway ;\" and the foundation-stone was laid in the same year by T. Meynell, Esq. This great work, which is the property of 60 shareholders, was completed in September, 1825. It is nearly 30 miles in length, ancl cost about \u00a3\"125,000. Several coaches, drawn by horses, travel daily at the rate of seven to nine miles an hour on this rail-road, between Darlington and Stockton. There are also six locomotive engines, besides horses, employed in the transit of coal, lime, lead, manufactured goods, &c. ; and there are two engines stationed on the line, which are used to assist the loaded waggons in their passage over the elevated parts of the road. An extensive land-sale depot for coals is formed at Stockton, near the Tees bridge, where a hotel has been erected. At the distance of about a fur- long higher up the river, an elegant chain bridge is thrown across, for the passage of the coal- waggons, &c, by a continuation of the railway, down the south side of the Tees to Middlebrough and Newport. This bridge, which was opened January 1, 1831, is 274 feet long, 25 feet broad, and 60 feet high. In 1824, a bill was introduced into parliament for the formation of a rail-road, to extend from Stockton to the coal districts in the northern parts of the county ; but, owing to some informality, it was thrown out. In 1828, however, it was again introduced and carried. On February 18, 1829, Lord Lowther presented a petition for a bill for this (the Clarence) railway ; and, on the 20th, he brought in a bill \" to enable the Clarence Railway Company to vary and alter the line of their railway, to abandon some of the branches thereof, and to make other branches therefrom, and for altering, amending, and enlarging the powers of the act passed for making and maintain- ing the said railway.\" This bill passed the Commons April 14; and, after an ineffectual opposi- tion by the Marquis of Londonderry, was read a third time and passed in the House of Lords on May 21. The royal assent was given on the 1st of June following. By this act, the proprietors are authorised to form a line of railway, including branches, from 47 to 49 miles in length ; and vol. n.

The work is now rapidly proceeding ; and, in tire course of a year or two, will be so far completed as to allow carriages to pass from the central parts of the county to Stockton. Inhabitants, Amusements, fye. The people of Stockton are industrious, honest, and hospitable ; the latter virtue not having yet been obliterated by the suspicious selfishness too often produced in populous, commercial, and money-getting places. In common with their neighbours, they have participated in the various turns of political excitement of which the last age has been so richly productive. During the French Revolutionary war, a corps of volunteers was raised here; and in 1803, upon the alarm of invasion, another corps was enrolled, who were presented with a pair of elegant colours, thc gift of the ladies of Stockton. They were dissolved in 1813. A corps of yeomanry cavalry was raised in 1820. Besides the ebullitions of loyalty or of popular feeling which have occasionally taken place, it is but justice to add, that the people of Stockton have ever been ready, by public sub scriptions and other methods, to alleviate the distresses of their fellow creatures. The Theatre is situated in the Green Dragon or Playhouse Yard, where it was erected in 1768, and first opened bv Mr. Bates's company of comedians.* Since that time, the managers occupying the other theatres in the county have successively taken it; and Messrs. Beverley and Roxbv's company now occasionally perform here. Though not in a very eligible situation, it is tolerably well attended, and will hold, when full, about \u00a3'40.-f- The Assemblies, held in the Town Hall, are patronized by all the fashionables in the town and neighbourhood, and take place monthly du ring the winter. Races are held on the Carrs on the Yorkshire side of the river. The course, which is considered a very good one, is a mile in circuit. In 1809, it was flooded by the river, and the horses in some places ran belly deep in water. The races commence on the Thursday in the first week after the York August Meeting. These amusements were discontinued from 1815 to 1825; ancl, though revived and carried on regularly since the latter date, they are not well at tended. A Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons (No. 19), which was constituted on the 3d of February, 1725, at the Swan and Rummer, Finch Lane, London, was afterwards removed to the *' This company performed at Durham, Sunderland, Darlington, &c. Mr. Shield, the popular composer, was one of the band ; and it was Bates who afterwards conducted the commemoration of Handel at West minster Abbey. The celebrated Mr. Holcroft and Cunningham the poet also belonged to this company. t Joseph Reed, well known as a dramatist, was born at Stockton in 1722, and was by profession a rope maker, in Sun Tavern Fields, London. In 1758, \" Madrigal and Trulletta,\" a mock tragedy, being his first production, was performed at Covent Garden. In 1761, \"The Register Office\" appeared, and at once ranked its author amongst the standard dramatists of his country. Its' characters are all well conceived and ably contrasted ; and Margery Moorpout is probably the finest specimen of genuine Yorkshire on the stage. She has immortalized the little village of Ayton (\" canny Yatton\") under Rosebem-. It is said that Foote copied his Mother Cole from the Gulwell of Reed ; and severe strictures have been written on the impro priety of exhibiting such specimens of depravity before the public. But, when improper passions are not excited, it cannot surely be wrong to bold up the hypocrite to scorn and detestation. AVhose morality was ever unhinged by witnessing the villany of lago? In 1766, Mr. Reed produced his tragedy of \"Dido,\" which, though not without merit, was only acted three nights. His last piece, \" Tom Jones/' a comic opertu was performed at Covent Garden in 1769, and well received. He preserved through life the character ofa sensible, worthy, friendly man ; and his taste for the drama never prevented his attention to business. He died in London, August 15, 1787, leaving a handsome fortune to his two sons, John AVatson Reed, a soli citor in London, and Shakspeare Reed, now of Thornhill, near Sunderland, Esq., and a magistrate for the county of Durham."], [61, "STOCKTON. 49 Swan, in Exchange Alley, and from thence to the Queen's Head, Stockton, on the 2d of December, 1756, when it was made No. 30. In 1773, it was removed to the inn now called the Vane Arms, and entitled the Lodge of Philanthropy. It is at present closed. Portrack Is a hamlet in the township of Stockton, from which place it is distant one mile east-by-north, being situated on the river Tees, where vessels are moored during the winter. Here is a ship building yaid, belonging to John Mellanby, Esq. ; a block and mast maker, a public house, &c. Preston-upon-Tees Is a township containing five farmsteads and a public house, two miles south-by-west from Stock ton, situated on the north side of the river Tees, at the point where a large Whinstone Dyke enters the county of Durham, and which extends nearly in a direct line to the village of Bolam, about 18 miles to the west-north-west. By Boldon Book, there were seven villains in Preston, each holding two oxgangs, and their rents and services as those of Boldon, except cornage. Walter held one carucate, AValdewin one carucate, Adam son of AV alter of Stokton one carucate for 10s. in lieu ofall services, Orine son of Toki and AVilliam son of Utting one carucate, and Richard Rand two oxgangs ; their rents and services as Alan of Normanton and AValter de Stoketon. The whole vill provided one milch cow. Hatfield's Survey states that John de Carrowe paid for the lands of Thomas cle Seton, in Pres ton, at the four great terms, viz. at St. Martin's, 10s. 6d., and at every other term 9s. 2d., doing foreign service and suit of court, in all 38s. AVilliam Baron held certain lands, ground at the manor mill, and did suit at the Halmote Court, paying 10s. at the Feasts of St. Martin ami St. John Baptist. Thomas Baron held a parcel of ground, did suit as above, and paid 6d. ; also one other parcel, and paid at St. Martin 6d., and at every other term 3d. Matilda Bowes held one oxgang, and paid at the four terms 14s. A family had early assumed the local name. Adam son of Adam de Preston occurs 1234. Alice, daughter and heiress of Ranulph de Preston, was the wife of Robert de Eden, who died seized of lands here in 1413. His descendants, of Belsis and Auckland, held the family estate at Preston till it was sold, some years ago, by Sir Robert Eden, Bart., to David Burton Fowler, Esq. Ararious other families, however, held lands here. John Randolph died seized of nine mes suages and oxgangs in 1362 ; and the chief, and latterly manorial property, belonged to the Setons, from whom a part of it descended to the Hotons of Herdwyk, and the remainder to the Sayers. After passing successively through the hands of Sir Marmaduke and Sir \\Arilliam AVyvill, Barts., it came to the Withams, who sold it, in 1722, to Sir John Eden, Bart., whose great grandson con veyed it, with the rest of his property here, to David Burton Fowler, of the Inner Temple, Esq. Preston Hall is now in the possession of Marshall Robinson, Esq. East Hartburn Is a pleasant village and township, situated on the brook from which it derives its name, 1.' mile west-south-west from Stockton. It contains a small shop, a shoemaker, a butcher, and a public"], [62, "STOCKTON AVARD.-S. AV. D. 50 bouse; and the township includes eleven farms. In Boldon Book it is stated that there were twelve villains and a half in Hartburn, each holding two oxgangs of land, and their rents and ser vices similar to those of Boldon, cornage excepted. There were three cottagers who wrought four teen days in the autumn, and the whole vill provided one milch cow. Ten carucates of the demesne lands of Stockton and Hartburn were in firm, and the rent was twenty chaldrons of corn. In Bishop Hatfield's Survey, John Lakan is the only free tenant named, who held by foreign service. The tenants of the demesne held a parcel of land near the bishop's sheepcot : there was a common furnace, forge, and kiln. The records do not clearly distinguish between this manor and West Hartburn, in the parish of Middleton St. Geooge. PARISH OF REDMARSHALL. The parish of Redmarshall is bounded by Norton on the east, by Grindon and Sedgefield on the north, by Stainton and Bishopton on the west, and by Elton on the south. It includes three con stableries: 1. Redmarshall ; 2. Carleton ; and, 3. Stillington. The whole parish, in 1821, contained 52 houses, which were inhabited by 58 families, amounting to 264 persons. The estimated annual value of the lands and buildings, for the year 1828-9, was =\u00a32147. Redmarshall. Emma, Lady of Redmershill,* occurs at an early date in a charter to Finchale Abbey. This manor afterwards reverted to the see of Durham, for Anthony Beke gave it to his brother, John Beke, Baron of Eresby in Lincolnshire, who sold it to Thomas Moulton ; and he sold it to Sir Henry Lisle, Knt., lord of the manor of Wynyard, who gave the manor of Redmarshall to Cathe rine his niece, wife of Alane of Langton, burgess of Berwick and Newcastle, and to the heirs of the body of the said Catherine for ever, as appears by his deed bearing date A. D. 1306. This manor continued vested in the lords of AVynyard till 1596, when AVilliam Claxton, Esq., died without male issue. One-third part of it afterwards passed through the famiUes of Morley of AVe myngton, co. Lancashire, Buckle of Whitton, Place of Dinsdale, Bromley of Nesbit. and Spear man. In 17-50, the trustees under the will of Gilbert Spearman conveyed it ancl a third of Claxton's porch to John Tempest, of AVynyard, Esq., for \u00a3'3540; and it is now the property of the Marquis of Londonderry. Another third of the manor was carried, by the marriage of the daughter of AVilliam Claxton with Sir AVilliam Blakiston, of Blakiston, Knt., into the latter family, who sold it to Nicholas Foowood, of Bishopton, from whom it passed, in 1612, to John Cooke, of Newcastle, draper. In 1613, AVilliam Jennison, Esq. (who married Anne, the youngest coheir of AVynyard) sold his third of this manor to Anthony Buckle, yeoman. The freeholders here, in 1684, were, Robert Bromley, Gent., of Nesbit; Thomas Davison, Clerk ; AVilliam AVilliamson, of St. Helen's Auckland, Gent. ; Timothy AVright, of Newcastle * Surtees derives the etymology of Redmarshall from \" The Hill ofthe Red Mere,\" or Red Mere's Hill; because it could be seen from a considerable distance, rising over a level district of loam and red clay, where the floods of winter would formerly collect and rest on the tenacious soil in a broad discoloured pool or mere.

The principal proprietors at present, besides the Marquis of Londonderry, are, Morton John Davison, of Beamish, Esq., Mr. James Pallister, and Mr. George Hutchinson. The township includes five farms, and contains a public house. The Church. \"The tower of the church,\" says Hutchinson, \"is so much disproportioned to the size of the edifice, ancl so dissimilar in its construction, that it carries evidence of its being originally built as a place of defence.\"* A heavy circular arch connects the nave ancl chancel. In the north wall of the latter are three stalls, formed by pointed arches, springing from corbels of human heads; and in the south wall, near the altar, is an arched recess ; but the monument, if it ever contained one, has been removed. The porch to the south is called Claxton's Porch, and contains a large window which gives light to the whole nave. Two recumbent figures, male and female, of very elegant work in alabaster, but much defaced by time and neglect, occupy a broad altar-tomb here, ancl are conjectured by Hutchinson to represent some of the Claxton family. In Glover's Pedigree of the Lords of Wynyard, however, it is stated, that Thomas Langton, of AVynyard, who died in 1417, ancl his wife Sibill, of Layton, both lie \" in the porche of the parish churche of Redmershill, under a tombe of alabastre, having both their portraictures engraven very sumptuously.\" The lead roof of the church was removed, and the lights altered, in 1806; but the whole still exhibits traces of high antiquity.

The yearly sum of \u00a34 has been paid to the parish officers by the tenant of Bishopton Field, which contains about 100 acres. Of this sum, 20s. is received yearly at Easter by the overseers of the town ship of Redmarshall ; 12s. 6d. at Christmas, and 7s- 6d. at Easter, by the overseer of Carleton ; and \u00a32 at Easter by the overseer of Stillington. These sums are distributed by the respective overseers amongst the poor of the townships above named, in sums varying from about 3s. to 10s. Carleton. This village is situated about four miles north-west from Stockton, and contains a school, two blacksmiths, a cartwright, and a shoemaker. The township includes ten farmsteads. Carlentune was one of the places which had been seized and detained from the see by the men of Northumberland, ancl of which restitution was ordered by the charter of Henry I., executed in council at Nottingham in 1109- By Boldon Book, there were 23 farmers in Carleton, who held 46 oxgangs of land, rendering for every two oxgangs 10s., and providing- a carriage for lead ing hay or corn six clays, ancl making four portions in autumn with all the household except the housewife, ancl paying two hens and twenty eggs. Gerbrode held four oxgangs, paying 20s. ; whilst in the service of the bishop he was exempt from work, but otherwise was liable at the will of the lord to perform the same with other farmers there. Helias held two oxgangs at 20s. rent ; Walter the miller two oxgangs, paying 10s. dejirm. and 2s. for work. Suminia, the widow, held two oxgangs for life, clear of rents and services, which after her death reverted to the lord. Wil liam, the son of Orm, held one carucate of land, paying 10s., and attending the great chace with one greyhound. For the mill was rendered 20 skeps of corn of Jarrum measure. In Hatfield's Survey the tenures are set forth as follows: Dringage land, William the son of John de Redmershill, ancl Simon de Camera, each held four oxgangs of land containing 60 acres, by 5s. rent, attending, as their only service, the great chace with their greyhounds. The free te nants were only three, viz. Thomas son of John Gower, Hugh de Laton de Thorp, and Thomas de Cramblyngton, who each held a rood of meadow only, the two former by 4d. rent, the last by 8d. William Umfray, John of Neseham, and 18 others, held 31 messuages and 56 oxgangs, paying 5s. an oxgang, and for every two oxgangs 19d. in lieu of the six days leading in Boldon Book, 2s. in lieu of the four portions of autumnal tillage, and hens and eggs as before. Besides, they were bound to lead timber and mill- stones for Carleton mill; and should the bishop rebuild or repair"], [65, "BISHOPTON. 53 his manor-house at Stockton, the tenants were bound to assist in leading timber, as well as roofing for Stockton mill when wanted. The tenants had the common bakehouse at 2s. rent, the mill 6s., and the brewery 2s. Thomas Godfrey, a neif to the lord, residing at Seaton-Carrow, paid 5s. a year.* The families of Rungeton, Blakiston, Redmershill, Culley, and Hertburne, held lands in Carle ton of the bishop in capite. In 1684, the freeholders were, AVilliam Forrest, Recusant; Ann Stelling; and AArilliam Newton, of Redmarshall. The Richardsons and Davisons liave held lands here from a remote period ; and the estate of the latter is still in the possession of the Rev. Edward Davison, of Durham. The greater part of the township, however, is copyhold under the see of Durham. -f- Stillington Is a hamlet and township, situated between two small brooks, about two miles to the north-west of Redmarshall ; being separated from the main body of the parish by a junction of Bishopton and Grin don. It contains three farms. Merton College, Oxford, held lands here at an early date; for, in 1367, AVilliam de la Pole held five acres in Stilyngton, of the Master of Merton-hall, bv the service of a rose ; and the same service recurs in the escheat on Michael Earl of Suffolk, in the 10th year of Bishop Langley. At present, the Rev. Edward Davison holds a considerable estate here by lease under the college. The following extracts from the Sequestrators Books relate to Stillington : \u2014 \"6 Sept. 1644.

In this instance, the slave, who was by the harsh condition of his birth attached to the soil, and no more entitled to quit it than his master's horse or ass, com pounds at an annual price for his liberty, and for the services which were due from him to his lord ; his chil dren would still inherit the servile condition of his blood, but, removed from the immediate eye of their owner, would probably soon mingle in the general mass of population, unreclaimed and undistinguished.\" + Sir Cuthbert Sharp is in possession ofa pewter flaggon, containing about a gallon, and bearing the fol lowing inscription within a wreath :\u2014\" The free gifte ofthe Inhabitants of Carleton, in the county of Dur ham-\u2014 AVinne it and weare it.

The earliest account of Bishopton occurs in the Continuation of Simeon : \u2014 \" There arose a feud betwixt Cumyn and Roger de Conyers, from whom he could never extort either homage or fealty, as from the other barons. Roger, therefore, in self-defence, began to fortify his house at Biscop tun for very fear of AVilliam. Cumyn made an attempt with a strong force to surprise the place, but was repulsed and obliged to retreat ; and here the bishop found a safe residence, and received the homage of such of his vassals as returned to their duty.\"* But what is most remarkable, as observed by Hutchinson, is, \" that though the village stands on high ground inclining to the south-east, and the church is built on an eminence in the centre, where the ground, strong by na ture, was easily fortified ; yet the place chosen for the strong-hold where Conyers defended him self against the troops of the usurper of the see, is a flat a little distance east of the village, and overlooked by the whole adjacent eminence. This situation could be chosen for no other apparent natural cause, than that water could be obtained there to fill the trenches. The plain is very nar row, but the whole ground marshy.\" This singular fortification, still called the Castle Hill, is nearly a regular cone, with a flat or truncated summit, formed of the common clay ancl coble-stone of the country thrown together. Its height is estimated by Hutchinson at 60 feet; and some of the older inhabitants of the village remember it to have been much higher than it now is, with a summit so small that not more than four or five people could stand upon it. At present, its height is 43-j feet, and its top is 50 feet wide by30;-f- the latter circumstance sufficiently accounting for the diminution of its altitude. Its base is surrounded by a deep circular trench ; a second, or outward fosse, runs at a considera ble distance to the east and west, but approaches the inner ditch much nearer on the north and south, forming an irregular square; ancl on the south of the station flows the Bishopton beck, by means of which the trenches might be easily inundated. There are no marks of buildings on the * In Lambarde's Dictionary, and the Chronicle of Lindisfarne, Bishopton is thus mentioned : \u2014 \" Biscop ton a village in the bishoprike of Durham wheare one Roger Conyers a nobleman of that country, in tyme of Kinge Stephen resistid one AVilliam Cumyn an ambitious prelate, which sought by forcible and warlike meanes to invade the sea, and to have compelled the monkes of Durham to have elected him after Gaufride (which died about the yeare 1136) their bysbop, which bycause they refused to do, he beseiged, sacked & spoiled not only th' abbey, but the towne of Durham also, withe suche crueltie & exquisite tormortes of deathe against suche as resisted him, as scarsely is the like to be found eyther in the Scottes or Danes them selves, which have after a. most barbarous sort often tymes heryed that, quarter, howbeit, in th' end, he bothe lost his desyre & was compelled by the nobilitie of the country (armed for that purpose) to submitte him selfe to the lawfully elect, whose name was AVilliam also ; whatsoever the cause was it is named of the by shop.\" Surtees observes, \"It would be no difficult matter, perhaps, with less of theory than is admitted into very grave works, to connect the faulchion-legend of Sockburn with the real exploits of the Constable at Bishopton, Cumyn playing the part of Dragon.\" See Sockburn. t Measured September 22, 1832, by Mr. M.

Perhaps this was a dernier resort ; yet troops driven within the breast-works and circumvallations might be annoyed by the engines of an enemy ; and even a strong bow would carry an arrow with force from the plain with out the ditches to the summit.\" It was, however, no uncommon plan, in those early times, to se lect places which could be flooded with facility, in preference to what would now be considered more obvious advantages, for the scites of fortified manor-houses, and even occasionally of castles of the highest class. The Castle Hill is, perhaps, one of the most remarkable specimens of the primitive mode of de fence which this country now contains.* There are few persons unaccustomed to the sight of an cient castles, whose strength would \" laugh a siege to scorn,\" wherein war has been systematically carried on, and wrhich are consequently connected with the commonly received ideas of chivalry and battle. But on viewing this exposed and grass-grown mount, or standing on its summit, the mind of the visitor is irresistibly led to the contemplation of the rude warfare in which only it could be useful : the imagination pictures the fierce attack \u2014 the spirited defence \u2014 the close, san guinary, and mortal struggle to win or to guard the trenches \u2014 and the savage troops of the un principled and cruel usurper, repulsed, broken, and finally defeated, leaving their dead and dying to welter in the ditches which had defended their conquerors. To Conyers, who retained his alle giance to the rightful bishop when the other barons of the palatine had deserted him, may be ap- plied the lines of Milton : \u2014 '\u25a0' Faithful found His loyalty he kept, his love, his zeal ; Nor number, nor example, with him wrought To swerve from truth, or sway his constant mind, Though single.\" Among the faithless, faithful only he ; Among innumerable false, unmoved. Unshaken, unseduced, unterrified, Bishopton, after the above transaction, continued in the possession of the family of Conyers for at least five centuries.-)- In 1613 and the two following years, Sir George Conyers, of Sockburn, Knt., and George Conyers, Esq., his son and heir, alienated the whole of their manors of Bishop ton, Stainton, and Newbiggin, in various parcels, to their tenants.

This small parish and constablery is bounded by Stockton on the east, by Norton and Redinar shall on the north, by Bishopton on the north-west, and by Long-Newton on the south-west and south. In 1801, its population amounted to 78, in 1811 to 76, and in 1821 to 105, consisting of 21 families, residing in separate houses. The annual value of the lands and buildings was esti mated for the county-rate, in 1828-9, at =\u00a31363. Maud, cousin to Robert Bruce, gave four oxgangs of land at Elton to Guisborough priory, which was confirmed by the said Robert, and afterwards by Bishop Kellaw. About the year 1200, the manor of Elton belonged to AArilliam de Homez, and was afterwards vested for several descents in the family of Gower. In 1378, it was held by Thomas, son of Sir William Gower. Ralph Gower, Gent., died in 1546, seized of half the manor of Elton, and of half the advowson ; the other moiety having become vested in the family of Bowes, at least as early as 1435. The latter portion descended, in 1556, to the coheirs of Sir George Bowes, of Dalden, of whom Dorothy intermarried with Sir Cuthbert Collingwood, of Eslington, Northumberland, who, in 1573, conveyed his moiety of the lordship of Elton, and of the advowson of the rectory, to Thomas Serjeantson, of Preston on-Skerne, and John Thomas and Christopher Jefferson, of Elton, yeomen. The other half shortly after became vested in the family of Errington. John Errington, of Elton, Esq., was a colonel in the service of King Charles I., and named a delinquent in the ordinance of parliament 1644. He died in 1666; and John Errington, his son, who had also been a lieutenant-colonel in King Charles's army, sold Elton, in 1682, to Sir Robert Shafto, Knt., recorder of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. The Erringtons are mentioned in the Sequestrators' Books as follows : \u2014 \" On pet'con of Mrs. Mary Errington, wife of Coll.

The Shaftos' portion was sold some years ago by John Shafto, of AVhitworth, Esq., to Thomas Wade, of Fatfield, Esq., for \u00a311,000. The heiress of the family of Jefferson inter married with Thomas Hogg, Esq., whose grandson, Thomas Jefferson Hogg, Esq., of the Temple, barrister, is owner of this portion of the estate and of a third of the advowson. The Suttons of Stockton also hold a portion of Elton. Their estate here was much improved, and beautified with plantations, &c. by the late George Sutton, Esq., of Elton House. This handsome mansion is now the property of his grand-nephew, George Hutchinson, Esq., who has assumed the name of Sutton. The small village of Elton is about 3 miles west-south-west from Stockton, on the road from thence to Darlington. It is the residence of a cartwright and a blacksmith, the latter of whom keeps a public house. The parish contains eight farms. The Church Is a very small, humble edifice, consisting of a nave, chancel, and south porch. A circular arch divides the nave and chancel, and another is closed up in the north wall of the nave. The old narrow lights are partly replaced by modern sashes. Monuments. \u2014 A recumbent effigy of a knight in armour, supposed to represent one of the Gowers,* lies under the arch in the north wall of the nave.

The parish of Long-Newton is bounded by Stockton on the east, by Elton and Bishopton on the north, by the chapelry of Sadberge on the west, by Middleton St. George on the south-west, and by Egglescliffe on the south. It forms only one constablery, which includes Coatham-Con yers, or Coatham-Stob, and Goosepool, part of West Hartburn. In 1801, the population was 295, which had decreased in 1811 to 253, but in 1821 had increased to 338, residing in 64 houses. The annual value of property was estimated for the county-rate, in 1828-9, at _\u00a33070. Long-Newton was anciently held by the Baliols, under, or as a member of, their great lordship of Gainford.* After their forfeiture, it was held of the Beauchamps Earls of AVarwick, their suc cessors in the honour of Barnard Castle.

Further, the same John took his own personal oath to observe this convention, and so did John Fitz-Robert, Eustace de Balliol, Walter de Foun tains, and Henry de Baliol, and Nigel de Baliol shall take the same oath ; and the same oath and surety shall be made for the bishop by Ralph prior of Durham, Ralph prior of Finchale, Master William the arch deacon, and John de Rumes the seneschal; and John de Baliol and those of his party swore faithfully that they would labour to obtain of the king that the bishop may have the homage of Gainford, and of the afore said knights' fees which are within the wapentake of Sadberge, and held of the barony of Gainford ; and if the king shall direct homage to be done to the bishop for the premises, he (Raliol) shall readily perform it; and if the king enquire of Baliol as to the said homage, he shall answer according to the truth, as far as en quiry mav be made of the best and wisest men of the country; and so soon as the bishop shall have had Baliol's bomage for the same five knights' fees and one fourth, he shall readily give up to Baliol all the an cient charters of the vill of Newton. \u2014 At Auckland, 5 Dec. 1231, in the presence of the archdeacon of Dur ham, and Robert de Ambian, Jordan Hayrun, Hugh de Capella, Jordan de Dalden, and others.

(created A^iscount Micklethwaite, of Ireland, in 1725) ; and is now the property of John Dennison, Esq., of \u2014 in Yorkshire. The house is an old gavel-ended mansion, near broken ground, on a small water, and almost hid in a grove of elm and abeille. Some of tlie rooms are pannelled with old wainscot ; and over the chimney of the principal lower apartment is a hunting piece, the stag at bay, executed with great spirit on the pannel. An upper room is hung with tapestry. Human bones have been frequently discovered near the pondstead, probably the scite of the domestic chapel and cemetery. Three farms belonging to the ancient vill of West Hartburn, or Goosepool, are attached to the parish of Long-Newton, and pay tithes to the rector, but join with Middleton St. George in the poor-rate.

PARISH OF EGGLESCLIFFE. The parish of Egglescliffe is bounded by Stockton on the north, by Long-Newton on the north west, by Middleton St. George on the west, and by the Tees on the south and east. It includes three townships, viz. 1. Egglescliffe ; 2. Aislaby ; and, 3. Newsham. In 1801, the entire parish contained 420 inhabitants; in 1811 the number had increased to 476, and in 1821 to 542, consist ing of 120 families, inhabiting 119 houses. The annual value of property here was estimated for the county-rate, in the year 1828-9, at .\u00a35647, 10s. Egglescliffe. \" There is reason to suppose,\" says Brewster, \" that Egglescliffe was a place of great antiquity-, and an ancient mart. There is a field which retains the name of Castle Field, or Castle Holme, though no traces of a castle are to be found, no rany history denoting one.\"* The Aislakbys, lords of the adjoining vill, were the ancient owners of Egglescliffe, from whom it passed by mar riage, about 1420, to the Astleys. AVilliam Astley, by charter, August 4, 1554, granted the Castleholmes, a free fishery', ancl the tenement called Holehouse, (which formed the manor of Eg glescliffe) to James Garnet, of Blasterfield, co. AArestmoreland. His great grandson, John Garnett, of Egglescliffe, bapt. October 22, 1615, was a captain of horse in the regiment of Colonel George Heron, in the service of King Charles I., and compounded for his estate for \u00a33142. In 1670, the year after the death of his only child, he sold the manor of Egglescliffe to Thomas AVood, D.

It is situated on a low peninsula, and is nearly surrounded by tbe river Tees, which winds round it in the form of a horse shoe, and is here navigable for vessels of 60 tons burthen. The population of the town in 1811 amounted to 1431, and in 1821 to 1504 persons ; and the annual value of property assessed to the county-rate in 1830 was \u00a32812. The main street runs north and south, and is very spacious. The town house stands nearly in the middle of the street ; and a custom exists here, after ringing the curfew in the cupola of this erection, of striking on the bell the number of the day of the month. The town contains 17 inns and public houses. There is not much trade, and no manufacture of any importance. The commerce of Yarm consists prin cipally in corn, flour, cheese, butter, and bacon, which are sent hence to London ; and this town par takes with Stockton in the advantages of the salmon fishery. The market-day at Yarm is on Thursday ; but from the vicinity of this place to the rising town and port of Stockton, it had considerably declined, but is again reviving, owing to the erection of several corn-mills in the town and neighbourhood, and the forma-"], [81, "EGGLESCLIFFE. 69 bounded by the undulating summits of the Cleveland hills. Many of the houses in Egglescliffe are but one story high, with small gardens in front, which, were the roads through the village kept in good order, would have a very neat appearance. In an open space in the centre stands the pedestal and part ofthe shaft of an old stone cross, from which it has been implied that a market was formerly held here. Messrs. Kay carry on an extensive tannery near the bridge, where there is also a paper- tion of the A'arm branch of the Stockton and Darlington Railway. The fairs, of which there are four an- nually., are on the Thursday before the 6th of April, on Ascension Day, on the 2d of August, and on the 19th of October for horned cattle ancl horses, and the following day for sheep and cheese. The October fair is one of the most considerable in the north of England, and brings a great influx of money into the town and its vicinity. From 300 to 400 waggons and carts, laden with cheese, are usually brought to this great fair. The following testimony in honour of Yarm cheese is quoted by Surtees : \u2014 \" Peter Basire, of Rouen, to his mother, Mrs. Basire, of Rouen, at AixcHffe, 26 Feb. 1655. \u2014 I, remembering the good cheese you make, if there be any shipps wh lade coals near your dwellinge, or at Newcastle, for to come directly to Roan, I doe intreate you to send me one as bigge as thc moone.\" The parish church of Ararm, dedicated to St. Mary Magdalen, stands at the west side of the town, and was rebuilt in 1730. The exterior is plain and rather homely ; but the interior is much admired for its neatness and good order. It is, however, chiefly remarkable for a window of painted glass, beautifully exe- buted, by Pecket, in which is exhibited a full length figure of Moses delivering the law on Mount Sinai. This living formerly was a rectory; but it is now only a perpetual curacy, of which the archbishop of York is the patron. The Catholics, the Independents, and the Wesleyan and Primitive Methodists, have each a chapel here ; and the Society of Friends have a meeting-house. There is an ancient Free Grammar School in Yarm, founded and endowed, in the time of Queen Elizabeth, by Thomas Conyers, of Egglescliffe, and the benefits of which have been very essentially extended by the liberality of the late William Chaloner, Esq. A National School, capable of containing 160 boys and girls, was built by subscription in 1816, and is supported by voluntary contributions. It appears from Tanner's Notitia that there was \" here an ancient hospital, dedicated to St. Nicholas, founded by some of the family of Brus, before the year 1185,\" and which continued till the dissolution ; but not a vestige of it now remains. There was also a house of Black Friars, said to have been founded by the second Peter de Brus, who died in 1240; but it has disappeared, and a commodious mansion has been erected upon the spot, called the Friary, now the seat of Thomas Meynell, Esq., the grounds of which are delightful, and extend about a mile along the banks of the Tees. Owing to the peninsular situation of this town, and to its slight elevation above the bed of the river, it is very liable to floods. One of these calamities is mentioned in 1635. But the most memorable are those of the 17th of February, 1?53, and the 16th and 17th of November, 1771- The inundation of 1753 was occa- sioned by a sudden thaw on the western hills, which laid the town seven feet deep under water in the higher parts, and touched the coverings of the shambles which stood in the main street. All the shops and ware- houses were quite filled ; and great quantities of furniture, wares, and live stock were swept away, without, however, occasioning the death of any of the inhabitants. The damage was estimated at \u00a37000. The flood of 177L at the time of the eruption of the Solway Moss in Cumberland, and the destruction of the Tyne Bridge at Newcastle, was more fatal and tremendous. The water in some parts of the town rose upwards of 20 feet in perpendicular height ; and many of the inhabitants were taken in boats from the roofs of their houses. A great quantity of property and nine lives were lost; and many more must have perished inevi- tably, had they not been preserved by the active humanity and timely assistance of the people of Stockton and the neighbouring villages. Since that time, the greatest floods were in 1783 and 1822. On the latter occasion, the wind blew a hurricane from Friday evening till Sunday morning (February 3), and a deluge of rain fell on the high grounds, which contain the sources of the great rivers. The Tees began to rise at nine o'clock on Saturday evening ; and, during a moonlight night, many of the inhabitants were employed in removing their property to the upper floors. The water continued rising till ten on Sunday morning, and then stood seven feet deep in the main street. The morning was beautifully calm, and the view from the high grounds of Egglescliffe was singularly grand : the Tees had become an immense smooth silver lake, on which boats were plying, and in the midst of which the town of Yarm seemed immersed. After remaining sta tionary nearly two hours, the flood began to retire, and the streets were nearly free from water by tive in the afternoon. The Tees rose to an unusual height on October 14, 1829. \u2014 Parliamentary Reports, Graves's Cleveland, Surlees's Durham, Parsons and While's Directory, Sykes's Local Records, eye."], [82, "STOCKTON AATARD\u2014 S.

The \" Yarm depot\" of coal and lime is likewise situated near tlie bigh road which crosses the bridge; being connected, by a branch of about a mile in length, with the main line of the Stockton ancl Darlington Railway. Egglescliffe is the residence of two black smiths, a bricklayer, a stone-mason, &c. ; and contains an inn ancl three public houses. This place, during the civil wars, was garrisoned, with Stockton, for the king; and the Parish Register mentions a skirmish at Yarum-bridge, in February, 1643. The Church Egglescliffe church stands on the brink of the declivity which slopes down to Yarm bridge. The western tower is square, with corner pinnacles and battlements at the top ; and there is an embattled projection, at about two-thirds of its height, towards the south. On the south side of the nave is a broad porch, called Pemberton's Porch, under an octagonal pillar supporting pointed arches ; and a pointed arch separates the nave and chancel. The east window has five lights, and the other windows of the chancel three, under pointed arches. Monumental Inscriptions. \u2014 In the south wall of Pemberton's Porch, under an arch, is the re cumbent effigy of a knight clad in chain armour : the right hand holds the sword hilt, and the other the scabbard ; a sort of winged serpent is biting thc lower point of the shield, which bears the arms of Aislakby; the legs are crossed, the feet resting on a lion. In the church-yard is an other figure, much worn and mutilated, of a knight in chain armour, in the act of drawing the sword, the legs crossed, and the feet resting on two animals. The latter effigy is now improperly placed upright against the exterior east wall of the south porch.

Perouse's object was the capture of the Com- pany's annual ships, with their rich cargoes of oil, furs, &c. ; and he fell in with the Seahorse, commanded hy Captain Christopher, at sea, just previous to her arrival at Churchill. A frigate was immediately de- spatched in pursuit ; but the night drawing on apace, and Captain Christopher perceiving that the French- man was ignorant of the coast, and by his following the English ship that he was determined to govern his own vessel by her motions, sent his men aloft, and furled his sails, pretending to come to an anchor. The enemy immediately conjectured that it would be dangerous for him to proceed farther ; therefore he directly- brought his frigate to an anchor in reality. Captain Christopher, rejoicing in the success of his deception, made sail to sea with the utmost dispatch, and, aided by the darkness of the night, was soon out of sight, leaving the Frenchman busied in getting up his anchor. Fired with this disappointment, Perouse burnt the factory, and proceeded to York, to secure the other ship, the King George, then lying at that place, under the command of Captain Fowler. As there was not sufficient depth of water for his ships to enter York, he anchored in Nelson River, and made every disposition for an attack upon the ship and factory by the dawn of the next day ; but Captain Fowler had perceived the three large vessels at anchor, and, naturally conjec- turing that they could have no good intentions towards him, put to sea during the night. Perouse despatched a fast-sailing frigate after him, which soon came in sight of the runaway, who, finding the Frenchman to have a great superiority in point of speed, tacked about, and stood in for the land to the south of A'ork, hop- ing thereby to entice his enemy into shallow water. The French captain, however, perceived his design, and, fearing lest in further pursuit he might incur the risk of shipwreck, put off to sea ; and Captain Fowler pur sued his voyage to England in safety. \u2014 Ann.

He left \u00a310 to the repair of Egglescliffe church, and \u00a320 to buy implements of husbandry for the poor parishioners. t Dr. Isaac Basire, prebendary of the 7th stall, rector of Egglescliffe and Stanhope, and archdeacon of Northumberland, was a most singular character, and his life was chequered with a great variety of fortunate^ and unfortunate events. He was born in Jersey according to Wood, but Grey's MS. Notes say at Rouen, educated at Cambridge, and, in consequence of his great literary attainments, first made chaplain to Bishop Morton, and then to his majesty King Charles I. about the year 1639. During the civil war, which soon after commenced, he remained firmly attached to the interests of his royal patron, and the privileges of the church. Being sequestered and plundered, he escaped and fled to the king, whom he accompanied, both at Oxford and Carlisle, but was afterwards taken and confined in Stockton Castle. After some time, he ob tained his liberty ; but being still apprehensive for his safety, he passed over to the continent, where he formed the resolution of propagating the doctrines of the Church of England among the Greeks, Arabians, Egyptians, Ike, and travelled through Apulia, Naples, Sicily, Morea, &c., into Syria and Palestine. Du ring his journey, he collated the several confessions of faith of the different sorts of Christians, Greeks, Ar menians, Jacobites, Maronites, &c, which he kept by him in their own languages. In his travels he endured many hardships, particularly when, in 1653, he passed from Aleppo to Constantinople by land, being 600 miles, without either servant, or Christian, or any man with him that could speak the Frank language ; yet, by the help of some Arabic acquired at Aleppo, he performed that journey in the company of twenty Turks, whose courtesy was purchased by his dispensing to them in the physical line, he having studied medicine at Padua. In this arduous and dangerous undertaking, he became so famous that he was chosen professor of divinity, and president of the synod of Maresvaharpeli, in Transylvania, where he was in favour with the Prince George Ragotski. After fifteen years of incessant labour, this distinguished missionary returned into England to his family.

There is a tra dition that the north arch was cut, and formed into a draw-bridge, during the civil wars. The structure originally consisted of five pointed arches; but that to the north has been made more capacious, and built in a semicircular form, to abate the violence of inundations ; and the bridge itself has been widened and rendered a substantial structure. In 1805, an elegant iron bridge, consisting of one arch 180 feet in span, cast by Messrs. Walkers and Co., of Masbrough, near Ro therham, was erected here; but, owing to some defect in the abutments, it unfortunately fell down about midnight on the 12th of January, 1806, when it was just on the point of being opened. This bridge is stated by Mr. Graves, in his History of Cleveland, to have cost .\u00a38000; and the weight of iron contained in it was 250 tons. Early Nook is a hamlet about a mile north from Egglescliffe, through which the Stockton and Darlington Railway passes, and where the branch to Yarm commences. Here is a vitriol manu factory, recently commenced by Mr. AVilson, of Darlington. Several new houses are erecting for the workmen ; and there is also a public house near the railway. Aislaby, Or Aislakby, contains a small scattered village, one mile west-north-west from Yarm, and 5 miles south-west-by- south from Stockton. Here is a corn-mill, a blacksmith's shop, and a public house kept by a butcher. The township includes nine farms. The abbot and convent de Augo gave to the prior and canons of Guisborough the land in As lakeby, which Richard bishop of Durham confirmed. The ancient family of Aislakby is first mentioned in 1313, when William de Aislakby and Agnes his wife presented the chantry of St. Thomas the Martyr, founded within the manor, to Thomas de Manneby, chaplain. In 1410, the estate became, by marriage with the heiress of Aislakby, the property of Hugh de Asteley; and it was sold, July 10, 1557, by William Astley, to Robert Hindmers, Clerk.* The family of the latter falling into female issue, Aislaby was purchased of them, in 1595, by Michael Pemberton, Esq.-f- His grandson, Michael Pemberton, of Aislaby, Esq., was a major in the service of King Charles I., and had two brothers, John and Henry, captains. John Pemberton, Esq., grandson of the last named Michael, alienated the estate, about 1720, to Robert Raikes, of Northallerton, Esq. In 17 \u2014 , Robert Raikes Fulthorp, Esq., sold the reputed manor of Aislaby to Rowland Webster, Esq., of Stockton, from whose descendant it has been recently purchased by the Earl of Eldon. A younger branch of the Aislakby family held an estate here, which has been divided into nu merous freeholds, passing through the families of Blakiston, Radcliffe, Story, Heghfeld, Bullayn, Brandling, Punshon, and Fowler.

This property continued in the direct line of the family, till Francis Killinghall sold his estates in 1569, and, in 1587, died an officer in the garrison at Berwick. A third of the manor, however, seems to have been vested in a younger branch of the Killinghalls ; and, after passing through the hands of various proprietors, the bulk of the property was re-united to that family by purchase from Richard Madox in 1606. John Killinghall, Esq., a prudent and wealthy man, who died in 1574, was the father of this second line.

About 10 or 12 years ago, these gentlemen refused payment of their respective portions, and, on the visit ofthe Commissioners for inquiring concerning Charities in 1829, produced their purchase-deeds, which contained no notice of any charge for charitable purposes. Under these circumstances, the payment of the above sums cannot be enforced without further evidence. Middleton-One-Row consists of one long row of good houses, 5 miles east-south-east from Dar lington, built upon the summit of the banks of the Tees, which here slope steeply clown to the water, forming almost a terrace in front of the houses. The prospect is very beautiful, the village being situated exactly at the point where the Tees, after forming an extensive curve round the parishes of Sockburn and Dinsdale, ancl approaching from the south, again turns eastward, form ing a sine curve. On the right arc seen the rich woods of Dinsdale, extending far up the river, and clothing its lofty banks, on the summit of which stands the splendid hotel attached to Dinsdale spa. In front there is an extensive prospect into Yorkshire. AVithin the last twelve years, several new houses have been erected here, and others rebuilt or enlarged, many of which are well furnished for the accommodation of the numerous visitors who come here to enjoy the benefits re sulting from the neighbouring sulphureous spring. The large inn called Davenport Hotel has lately been rebuilt on an extensive scale; and the village contains a circulating library, and seve ral shops and tradesmen. In summer, temporary bazaars are occasionally opened here, for the sale of fancy goods, toys, &c. In short, Middleton-One-Row now affords every convenience and comfort necessary in a place of public resort. A pleasant footpath, with seats at convenient dis tances, leads from hence, along the margin of the river, to the baths at Dinsdale. Over-Middleton, as has been shewn, came early into the possession of the family of Surtees, and was held of the bishop by fealty and 4s. 6d. rent. On the division of the family estates in 1552, the manor of Over-Myddelton was allotted to Marmaduke Surtees, whose grandson sold it to An thony Felton, of \u2014 Jarrowe, Gent., who again conveyed it in 1608 to Arthur Aldbrough, of Aid brough, Esq. ; and he, in 1612, granted to Christopher and Alan Ayscough. James Ayscough, of Middleton-One-Row, occurs as refusing to compound with the parliament for his estates. Some parcels of the manor had, however, been alienated at an early period, and which passed to the fa milies of Hedworth, Forster, Hodshon, Killinghall, &c. In 1558, AVilliam AArren, of Billy hall, died seized of property here, which was purchased from his descendants, in 1595, by Roger Wil son, Clerk, vicar of Kelloe, whose son, Marmaduke \\Afilson, held it in 1675. Thomas, AA'rightson, Esq., of Nesham Hall, now possesses considerable property here. vol. n. \u2014 30. Y"], [92, "STOCKTON WARD\u2014 S. AV. D. 80 West Hartburn may be termed an extinct village, for the very name is almost forgotten, and substituted by Goosepool, which is properly applied only to that part of the vill situated in the parish of Long-Newton. Two rows of cottages, with a well in the centre, near the northeastern verge of the parish of Middleton St. George, are the remains of the village, which stands on the Stockton and Darlington Railway, and contains a public house. According to tradition, there was formerly a chapel and burying-ground here, and some of the older inhabitants affirm that grave stones have been dug up in the fields; but there are no records to prove the existence of such a chapel. The families of Bart, Surtees, and Killinghall, successively held property here. 3 June, 1 Eliz.,' AVilliam AVren, of Billyhall, died seized of half of West Hartburn, held by knight's ser vice, leaving Anthony his son ancl heir, whose grandson, Lindley AVren, sold this estate to Francis Forster, Gent., in 1628, from whose descendants a part of it has acquired the name of Forster House. This is now the property of the Rev. AVilliam Addison Fountain, rector of Middleton St. George. Oak Tree is a hamlet so called from the sign of a public house, 5i miles east from Darlington. Mr. Thomas Ellis, the principal proprietor, has here a large brewery and malting. Pounteys Bridge* \u2014 This structure stood about 300 yards below the scite of the sulphur well. The date of its erection is unknown ; but it may fairly be ascribed to the Saxon, if not to the Ro man era, and was probably the first that was thrown across the Tees. Defences were erected near it on each side of the river ; ancl it is supposed to have long been the chief entrance into the county from the south. In the course of time, a house of hospitality for travellers, and a chapel dedicated to St. John, were erected upon or near the bridge, and endowed by the Surtees's and others. There was also a hermitage-f- in the immediate vicinity, in which AVilliam Byndelawes, of Burton in Lonsdale, was placed by John prior of Durham in 1426. On the decline of Sadberge, and the increasing use of the more open road by Croft Bridge, the old High-street here became gradually deserted; a circumstance which was accelerated by the frequent robberies committed in the wet, hollow pass of Countys-lane, whilst the perpetrators found a safe refuge in Dinsdale wood.j The * As the meaning of the original words, Pons Teys, become gradually unknown, the word bridge was im properly added. Many similar instances of reduplication occur ; as AVhite Mere Pool, AVarden Law Hill, &c. t The hermit on or near the bridge was no uncommon character in those days, as will appear from the following notice of one in no very secluded situation: \u2014 \" There was a hermitage upon Tyne Bridge in 1429, when the priest who resided there was left a legacy of six marks annually, for which he was ordered to sing for the soul of his benefactor, Roger Thornton. The situation was well chosen, being in view of those who were exposed to perils by water, and of the numerous pious passengers who were obliged to pass the bridge.\" \u2014 Mackenzie' s Hist, of Newcastle, vol. i. p. 209. The scite of Pounteys Bridge, however, with its woods, its rural mill (for there was then one immediately above the bridge), and the rest of its rich and romantic scenery, was infinitely better adapted to the commonly received ideas of a hermit's life than the bustle of a commercial river ; and it requires no great stretch of the imagination to picture the ascetic counting his beads amongst the lovely recesses near Middleton.

Ralph Rymer and your seise how the money shall be safely conveyed unto him according to the former agreement, which was, that hee should send two men to you to Durham, who might help to guard it with your own company to Brafferton ; unto which company Dr. Gilbert will give order to two of his fa mily at Greatham Hospitall, that upon your sending for them, they shall come provided to goe along with you from Durham ; for Mr. Hilton's sonne, who brought your letter hither, tells us that he was in great clanger to be robbed about Darnton and Neesum by thieves and highwaymen that lay upon the street there, to set upon passengers who they thought carried any money with them ; and he named Barwick for one, a famous thiefe, with others in his company, besides one -Middleton, and one Coperthwaite, who layd at Nee-"], [93, "CRAIKE. 81 date of the total destruction of Pounteys Bridge does not appear.

This small parish, otherwise called Craikeshire, or Craike Hall, is three miles in circuit, and locally situated in the wapentake of Bulmer, in the North Riding of Yorkshire, within two miles east of Easingwold, though it belongs to the county palatine of Durham, having been given to St. Cuthbert in 685, by Egfrid, king of Northumberland. It is mentioned in the grant of that mo- narch as, \" Villam qu\u00e6 vocatur Creec, et tria milliaria in dreuitu ipsius vill\u00e6 ,\u2022\" and it is said that the saint founded a monastery in this his new possession. In 1228, Walter Grey, archbishop of York, granted 20 days indulgence to any person who would contribute to the hospital of St. Mary de Pratis, in Craike. The bishops of Durham have constantly had within the manor of Craike a seneschal, a chief forester and keeper of the castle, a park keeper, and a bailiff'. In the parliamentary population returns, Craike is included with the South-west Division of Stockton AVard; and its inhabitants, in 1801, amounted to 404, in 1811 to 453, and in 1821 to 538 persons, living in 109 houses. It is comprehended in the Deanery of Darlington, ancl Hut- chinson says it is included in the land-tax assessment with Darlington AVard, and pays thereto \u00a3*160, 16s. 5d. ; but it is not assessed for the Durham county-rate. In a Beport laid before the House of Commons, however, the annual value of property in Craike assessed to the county-rate in 1830, is returned with Bulmer wapentake, at ,\u00a33259. In the militia service, the legislature have thought it expedient to embody the inhabitants with the men of Yorkshire ; and, by the Boundaries Act, recently passed in conjunction with Earl Grey's Act for amending the Representa- tion of the People, this parish is united with the North Riding of Yorkshire in the election of members of parliament. Little connection, therefore, remains between Craikshire and the county of Durham, from the nearest point of which, as has been stated, it is above 28 miles distant. The ruins of Craike Castle (now occupied as a farm-house) stand on the summit of a lofty emi nence, on which the Romans had a fortress. In the time of the Saxons, this castle was a royal palace. The hill commands a most extensive prospect of the forest of Galtres, and the beautiful and picturesque vale of Mowbray, so called from its ancient owner, Roger de Mowbray. -f- On the sum for tlieir prey, and that he was putt to ride full speed for four miles together, to escape them in their pursuit of him.

These sums are distributed by the rector and churchwardens, with the sacrament-money, on St. Thomas's day. Ralph Bellwood left 10s. a year, to be paid at Easter out of his estate at Craike; but this payment has been withheld for about 25 years, there being no evidence in writing of the liability of the estate. Poor's Lands. \u2014 Two fields in Stillington parish, containing about 8 acres, let for \u00a314, 14s. per annum ; and a close in Farlington parish, containing 6 acres, and let for \u00a38, 8s., are under the management of the over seers, who distribute the amount of the rents in coals to the poor during the winter season.

ROM Dinsdale and Sockburn on the south-east, to the extremity of Stanhope parish on the north-west, Darlington AVard measures about 45 miles in length, and averages nearly 15 miles in breadth. It is the largest of the five civil and ecclesiastical compartments into which the county palatine of Durham is divided, and is bounded on the east by Stockton AA'ard, on the north-east by the newly-formed AVard of Durham and the western extremity of Chester AVard, on the north by the imaginary line separating the county of Durham from North- umberland, on the west by Cumberland, and on the south-west ancl south by the river Tees, dividing it from AVestmoreland and York- shire. About one half of this Ward, extending from its eastern boundary, is a fine cultivated district, embellished with a number of handsome villas, richly ornamented with wood and water, and provided with market towns; but the sterility of the bleak and wild hills of the western portion is compensated by its mineral trea- sures. The principal rivers of the Ward are, the Tees ; the Skerne, which enters its eastern boun- dary near the village of Preston, and, passing by Darlington, falls into the Tees at Croft Bridge ; and the Wear, which winds through it by a circuitous route from west to east. These livers are replenished by a great number of brooks and rivulets, which intersect the Ward in every direction. This Ward, of which Darlington is the capital, forms one of the deaneries in the archdeaconry and diocese of Durham ; and its seventeen parishes and eight parochial chapelries are arranged in three divisions, of which the following is an enumeration : \u2014 SOUTH-EAST DIVISION.

The estimated annual value of property assessed to the county-rate for the year ending January 12, 1829, was \u00a3\"1325. \" The minute parochial divisions of the district,\" observes Surtees, \" prove its early settlement and cultivation. No fairer spot could attract the notice of a Norman soldier, and nowhere were his descendants more likely to transmit their possessions in deep hereditary peace. The knights of the Tees might mingle in the Border warfare ; but the bugle-horn of an assailant would seldom startle the inmates of their quiet halls. Their mansions stood without tower or peel. Dinsdale had only its fosse; and Sockburn on its level lawn was guarded only by the circling sweep of the Tees. The sale of the estates to wealthy families, already possessed of hereditary seats, has occa sioned, within the last century, the desertion of these ancient halls and quiet fields, which now breathe a spirit of even deeper retirement.\" Siward, the first recorded possessor of Dinsdale, is supposed to have lived in the time of the Norman princes ; and his son held Gosforth and half of Mileton by the service of one knight's fee.

Flis son, Sir Alexander Surteys, left an infant heir, who was the third Sir Thomas Surteys, and the last of his line who attained knightly degree.

This occasioned his leaving London, and gave him an opportunity of quitting a profession that was contrary to his inclination, and of following the roving life he loved, and the arts for which he had talents. He painted, designed, and etched. Arertue heard that he had learned the latter of Hollar ; but this he himself denied. Ralph Thoresby, in his Ducatus Leodiensis, often mentions Mr. Place with great encomiums, and specifies various presents that he made to his museum. He says that Mr. Place discovered an earth for, and a method of making porcelain, which he put in practice at the man sion-house of York, and of which manufacture he gave Thoresby a fine mug. (This pottery cost him much money : he attempted it solely from a turn to experiment ; but one Clifton, of Pontefract, took the hint from him, and made a fortune by it.) This author adds that Mr. Place discovered porphyry at Mount Sor ril, in Leicestershire, of which he had a piece to grind colours on ; and he specifies views of Tynemouth Castle and Light-house, the cathedral of York, churches and prospects of Leeds, drawn and etched ; and a mezzotinto of Henry Gyles the glass painter, executed by Mr. Place. He also scraped plates of John Moy ser, Esq., of Beverley, his particular friend ; of Thomas Comber, dean of Durham ; and of Bishop Crewe : the last is finely executed. Many sketches of castles and views which he took in AVales, and of various places in England, Scotland, and Ireland, several of them well finished, are extant, and have been engraved. A view of Scarborough Castle was drawn as late as the year 1715. His prints are very scarce. He seldom resided in London, and drew only for his amusement, seldom completing what he undertook ; and in his rambles painting, drawing, and engraving occasionally. In the reign of Charles II. he was offered a pension of \u00a3500 a year to draw the royal navy, but declined accepting it, as he could not endure confinement or de pendance. He died in 1728, aged 81 ; and his widow, by whom he had a daughter, married to AVadham Wyndham, Esq., quitting the manor-house in York, disposed of his paintings, among which were an admired piece of fowls, and others of flowers and fish, unfinished.

It is surrounded by two en trenchments; the outer fosse (which has been recently cleaned out by the tenant, and is wide and dee])) including an area of two acres. Two ancient elms and some remains of buildings point out the chief approach from the south. The building itself is now occupied as a farm-house. The walls are thick, ancl the rooms low, with heavy beams and rafters. A stone, with the arms of Place, is let into the wall on the left of the door. It is generally believed that there is a subterra neous passage beneath this house, which tradition carries as far as Middleton-One-Row, about two miles distant ; ancl an account is preserved, by some of the older inhabitants of the place, of a des perate adventurer who penetrated a considerable way into this dreary avenue, until he was stopped by an iron grate. The idea of concealed treasure, as usual, mingles with superstitious feeling on this subject. The Church Ralph Surteys, before 1195, gave the church of Detensale, with its lands and rights of pasture, to St. Cuthbert, and Hugh bishop of Durham, and his successors, in pure and perpetual almoigne, to provide lights for the shrine of St. Cuthbert ; and this grant, after some hesitation, was con firmed by his grandson, Ralph Surteys, in 1252. Bishop Philip granted the church of Detenes hale, with the chapel of Pountays, to AVilliam Briton, Clerk, charged with an annual pension of three marks to the prior and convent of Durham, which was recovered in 1332 against Robert de Calne, rector.

There is no tower, the west end of the building consisting of two ga bles, formed by the nave and aisle, and surmounted by crosses. The east window consists of three lights, under a pointed arch ; and there are irregular arched windows on each side of the chancel, and in the aisle and nave.

And it was provided, that the said trustees should certify to the said Thomas AVivill and his heirs, once in every three years, how the money was dis- posed of. The yearly sum of \u00a36 is paid to the churchwarden by \u2014 Calvert, of Richmond, on account of William John Anderson, Esq., owner of the Swinwithwaite Temple estate. \u00a33 thereof is usually paid to a school- mistress bv quarterly payments, for which, and a gratuity received from the rector, she teaches all the poor children ofthe parish who apply, in a school-room belonging to the parish. The remainder is given away to poor persons of the parish, in sums varying from 4s. to 20s. Part of the rent-charge appears to have been frequently applied in repairing the school-room above mentioned. The Sulphur Well was accidentally discovered in 1789, by some workmen employed by the late Mr. Lambton in searching for coal at Dinsdale. The men had bored to the depth of 72 feet, chiefly through red rock and whinstone, when the spring burst forth with a tremendous smoke and sulphureous stench. The remarkable quality of the water having attracted attention, a hole was made in the ground, in the channel of the spring, for the purpose of bathing; and one of the workmen, who for many years had suffered from chronic rheumatism, was cured by drinking the water and using the bath. From this period until 1797. it was much resorted to by the neighbour in<r villagers, for whose use a bath was then built. o o i The large quantity of hepatic air in this spring is very remarkable, and probably exceeds the proportion in any medicated water of which the analysis is before the public. The separation of the sulphur is so copious, that large quantities may be collected out of the channel of the spring. The water is clear and sparkling at the well-head, but gradually becomes opaque as the sulphur separates from the gas. Like most hepatic waters, it leaves a slight sweetness on the palate. The stream, which issues through a very small bore, flows ten gallons in a minute at the rock, and at the surface five gallons : neither weather nor season make any observable alteration in quality or quantity. On applying the bulb of the thermometer to the stream as it breaks into day, the quicksilver stands at 52, eight degrees above the temperature of the neighbouring springs. According to the analysis of Mr. Thomas Dixon Walker, surgeon, of Hurworth, one gallon of the water contains, \u2014 OF GASEOUS FLUIDS, Sulphuretted Hydrogen* 20- cubic inches.

For whatever complaints the Harrowgate water has acquired its just reputation ; the Dins dale spring may fairly put forth rival pretensions ; and it is but truth to state, that its aperient qualities are rendered more certain than those of the Harrowgate water, from its possessing a much larger proportion of the sulphate of soda. The muriates certainly are in smaller proportion.'\" From the increasing celebrity of the water, the original bath soon became too small for the con tinually augmenting number of visitors; and, about eight years ago, a suite of hot and cold baths were erected on an extensive and convenient plan, affording every comfort to the invalid. They are situated close to the river; and on the eminence behind them stands Dinsdale Hotel, erected by Lord Durham, and opened in 1829. This splendid establishment, which has been elegantly furnished by Mr. Henry Marshall, of Newcastle, contains above 70 apartments, with proportionate stabling and offices. Balls are occasionally held here in the summer season, which are attended by all the nobility and gentry in the neighbourhood. The upper apartments command a most beautiful and extensive prospect down the river Tees, and of the whole of the level vale of Cleve land,* with its romantic boundary of mountains. The spa is nearly surrounded by a fine thriving plantation, which extends about a mile to the south-west, and is intersected by shady walks, the principal of which runs along the side of the Tees. On one side of this path the trees rise suc cessively above each other on a steep bank, and on the other form a rich fringe overhanging the water's edge. The deep repose of the scene is only interrupted by the occasional appearance of a solitary angler ; while \u2014 \" The river, rushing o'er its pebbled bed, Imposes silence with a stilly sound.\" About two miles higher up the river are the remains of an old bath.

That part of the parish of Sockburn which lies within the county of Durham is bounded by Dinsdale on the north-east, by Nesham in the parish of Hurworth on the north-west, and by the Tees on the west, south, and east; thus forming the southern extremity of the peninsula already described. In 1821, it contained only 9 houses and 43 inhabitants, being an increase of 6 persons within the preceding ten years. The estimated annual value of property assessed to the county rate in 1828-9 was \u00a3691. In Lambarde's Diet. p. 324, this manor is thus mentioned : \u2014 \" Soctburgh in Chron. Lindisf. after that Aldunus and his wandringe mates had reposed the reliques of their great patron Cuth bert, and buylded somwhat at Durham, then begged hard, not for cantels of chese as other poore men doe, but for large corners of good countries, as al their profession used, and obteyned of k. Canute the manor of Standrop. Then also moved they noble and gentlemen by the example of their kinge to doe somwhat, accordinge to their proportion ; and as every man was more dolt then his fellow, so obteyned they more at bis handes. Amongst others one Snaculf, the son of Cykell, [before 1015] gave them Soctburgh, Morton, and others.* Soctburgh was of some estimation be fore that the see came to Durham ; for while it was in the Holy Isle, Higbald was consecrated bishop at Sockbyry, after tbe death of Cynewulfe,\" A. D. 780. Leland says, \" The house and land of Sokburn hath bene of auncient tyme the very inheritance of the Coniers, whos name (as I lernyd of himself) is in auncient writings Congrues and not Comers.\" It is probable this manor was granted out early to one of this Norman family for some valiant action, emblematically described in the following legend, preserved in Bowes' s MSS., p. 51 : \u2014 \" In an ould Manuscript w'1 I bave sene of ye descent of Connyers, there is writ as follow eth : Sr Jobn Conyers, Knt., slewr y' monstrous and poysonous vermine or wyverne, ancl aske or werme, wh overthrew and devoured many people in fight, for that ye sent of y' poison was so strong yt no person might abyde it.

Y' place where this great serpent laye was called Graystane; and as it is writ ten in ye same manuscript, this John lieth buried in Sockburne church in compleat armour before the Conquest.'1'' The ancient service by which the manor of Sockburn was held, mentioned as early as 1396, proves the antiquity of the legend. \"At the first entrance of the bishop, the lord of Sockburn, or his agent, meets him in the middle of the river Tees, at Nesham, where the water is fordable, (otherwise on Croft Bridge,) when he presents a falchion to the bishop, and repeats the following words : \u2014 ' My lord bishop, I here present you with the falchion, wherewith the champion Conyers slew the worm, dragon, or fiery flying serpent, which destroyed man, woman, and child ; in memory of * This grant includes the right of Sac and Socne. Sac was a privilege of a lord of trying causes arising among his tenants and vassals, and of imposing fines on them for offences ; also the fine or forfeiture itself. Soc likewise signified tbe power and authority to administer justice, but more properly the territory or dis trict endowed with that privilege. Hence, the name of Sockburn, as now spelt, would imply the boundary or limit of the Soke ; while Socbyrig, by which it is designated on the consecration of Higbald, signifies the seat or capital of such district, and has therefore been referred by some to Sadberge. vol. ii. 2 B"], [106, "92 DARLINGTON WARD.\u2014 S.

The bishop takes the faulchion in his hand, and immediately returns it courteously to the person that presents it, wishing the lord of Sockburn health, and a long enjoyment of the manor.11 This ceremony was performed so late as 1771** \"hen the steward of Sir Edward Blackett presented the faulchion to Bishop Egerton on his first entrance.* There is a drawing of the faulchion in the herald's office, Durham visitation. On the pommel are three lions of England guardant. These were first borne by King John, so that this faulchion was not made before that time, nor did the owner kill the dragon. The black eagle in a field, or, on the other side, was the arms of Morcar, Earl of North umberland. The grey stone, mentioned as tbe monument of Conyers1 victory over his dreadful enemy, is shewn to the traveller in a field adjoining the church, but without any other evidence than tradition, that there a dragon died.-f To quit the regions of fable : Roger Conyers was by the Conqueror made constable of Durham Castle, ancl keeper of all tbe soldiers1 arms therein ; and which office wras settled on him and his heirs male for ever, by grant under the great seal of William cle Carilepho, bishop of Durham. Bishop Flambard gave Rungetun in Yorkshire to a second Roger Conyers before 1126. His son, who was a baron of tlie bishopric, and rendered the important services to Bishop William at Bishopton, held Sockburn. With his eldest son Robert, he offered up at the altar of St. Cuthbert the church of Rungetun ; and they also granted to Sherburn Hospital their churches of Sockburn and Bishopton.

My Lord having notice that the high sheriff, accompanied with the whole of thc gentry of tlie county and the militia-horse, expected his approach, took horse a little before bis coming to the river side. As soone as he came in sight of the banks, the trumpetts sounded, and the gentry, with the troops of horse, all in one body, judged to be about 1000, moved into the midst of the river, where, when my Lord came, the usual ceremony of delivering a great drawne faulchion was performed, after which the trumpetts sounded againe, and great acclamations followed; which ended, they proceeded in order to Dar lington. \u2014 Aug. 23, 1651, Durham.\" Tlie bishop himself writes as follows : \u2014 \" The confluence and alacrity of ye gentry, clergy, and other peo ple was very great, and at my first entrance through the river of Tease, there was scarce any water to be seene for tlie multitude of horse and men yl filled it, when ye sword yl killed ye dragone was delivered to me with all the formality of trumpets and gunshots and acclamations y' might be made.

In page 54 wiil be found the more probable conjecture ot Surtees, who, after alluding to the defence of Bishopton by . Conyers, adds, \"He afterwards bad the address to bring the Scotch intruder Comyn a humble kneel ing penitent before the episcopal throne. To bring about this most wished conclusion implies as much cou rage, and certainly more address, than if the Constable had finished the contest in the usual manner with bloody hand. The Constable's staff and the Wardenship of Durham Castle, which he had recovered siom Comyn, seems a most appropriate reward ; and if the green acres of Sockburn \\. ere added to the \u00ab*ift, he was still not overpaid.\" There is no real evidence of an earlier possession of Sockburn by the Conyers family than these transactions. *"], [107, "SOCKBURN. 93 now fallen, and not a foot of land is held by Conyers in either county.1'* In 1635, William Con yers, Esq., died without issue male, leaving two daughters his coheirs. Katherine, the eldest, died under age ; and Anne, the survivor, intermarried with Francis Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury, by whom she had a son, Conyers Talbot, who died without issue, and an only daughter Mary, married to John Stoner, of Stoner, in Oxfordshire. Before 1685, Sockburn was alienated by the latter to Sir William Blackett, of Newcastle, whose descendant, Henry Collingwood Blackett, Esq., an officer in the army, is the present proprietor. Sockburn is situated 7 miles south-east-by- south from Darlington, and comprehends within its parochial jurisdiction the two townships of Girsl.y and Over-Dinsdale, which arc on the opposite side of the river, in the wapentake of Allerton shire, and North Riding of Yorkshire,**!*- so lllat their inhabitants have to cross the water in boats when they visit their parish church, there beino- no bridges nearer than Croft or Yarm.

The little church, standing lonely on its level green, has survived the halls of its ancient patrons. Deep traces of foundations of gardens and orchards a little to the south, point out the scite of the mansion ; and one old decaying Spanish chesnut, spared by the axe, whose bulk and indurated bark have protected it from other injury, seems alone to connect the deserted spot with some recollection of its ancient owners.11 The only approach to the church and manor is by a narrow carriage-road from the north ; and the solitude of the place seems enhanced by the uninviting announcement of \" Aro road but to Sockbumf The whole township consists of one very large farm, now in the occupation of Mr. Robert Dunn.

The chancel, five paces in width, and ten in length, is divided from the nave by a pointed arch rising on brackets. Tbe nave is nine paces in length, with a kind of aisle or porch to tbe south, formed by a pillar supporting pointed arches. On the north side is a porch in which lie the tombs of Con yers. A stone with a curious piece of knot-work is built up in the west ward of the church, and a rude cross in the south wall. Some sculptured stones, nearly defaced, lie in the south porch.

This parish is bounded by Dinsdale on the east, by Haughton-le-Skerne on the north, by th<? parish of Darlington on the northwest and west, and by the Tees and a small portion of Sockburn. on the south. It consists of the two townships of Hurworth and Nesham, which, together, con tained in 1801 a population of 867 persons; but in 1811 they had increased to 957, and in 1821 to 1124, comprising 245 families, living in 237 houses, of which 63 were situated in Nesham, and the rest in Hurworth. The annual value of the lands and buildings in the parish was estimated, in 1828-9, for the county- rate, at _\u00a3>4589, 10s. ; viz. Hurworth and Nesham 10s. Hurworth. Hurworth was the lordship of the Tailboys from an early date, and, on the grant of Sadberge to the bishop, was held of the see by the twentieth part of a knight's fee and suit once in three weeks at the court of Sadberge. Robert Lord Tailbois died without issue in 1540; and his sister, Elizabeth, with her husband, Thomas Wimbysh, of Kyme, in Lincolnshire, Esq., granted the manor and advowson of Hurworth to Sir Leonard Beckwith, of Selby, co. York, Knt., for i?266. His son and heir, Roger Beckwith, of Selby, Esq., conveyed the same, for iJ330, to Henry Law son, of Nesham, Esq., and George Ward, Gent. The family of Ingleby had also held lands here from 1382, called Inglebifs Manor, which were united by purchase to the moiety held by Henry Lawson, Esq., whose grandson Henry died under age. His aunts, Frances, wife of Richard Braithwaite, Esq., and Ann, wife of Henry Jennison, of Winyard, Esq., became bis coheirs: but the whole centered by purchase in Jennison ; and, in 1727, John Jennison, of Nesham Abbey, Gent., sold the manor of Hurworth and half the advowson to John Bland, of London, merchant. Besides the moiety of the manor held by the Wards, several other freeholds have existed here. In 1684, the freeholders were, Benjamin Lister, Esq., barrister; John Burnett, of Croft, Gent.; William Jennison, Gent., of Nesham Abbey ; Ann Byerly, widow, at London ; Judith Richardson, spinster; Hamond Beaumont, Clerk; Ann Marley, widow; Thomas Bromley, Gent., of Monk- Heselden ; George Slany, of Middleton-Tyas ; Thomas Bulman, Gent.; William Ward, aged; Michael Harrison, Gent. ; Robert Smith, Gent., of Durham ; Ninian Gresham ; Robert Warde, of Darneton ; Cuthbert Bore, of Skipbridge-house ; Timothy Kitchingman, at Baulke, in York shire ; Francis Buckle, William Walker, and James Hamilton. The property is scarcely less divided at present. The township contains about fifteen farms. There are three gentlemen's villas here, viz. Pilmore House, near Croft, the seat of Surtees Raine, Esq. ; Hurworth Cottage, belonging to George James, Esq. ; and Newbus Grange, lying on the river betwixt Hurworth and Nesham, the property of the widow of the late Jonathan Featherstone, Esq. Hurworth is a considerable village, pleasantly situated on the brink of a steep hill above the river Tees, 3i miles south-south-east from Darlington, and about one mile east from Croft Bridge, to which its township extends. It is one of the most delightful situations in the county of Dur ham, commanding a rich, though not an extensive view over Teesdale, where the river winds."], [111, "HURWORTH. 97 round a plain, and its opposite banks rise abruptly to a considerable height, forming an amphi theatre of about four miles in circumference. The houses, many of which are well built, form one wide street, extending from east to west. The late residence of Colonel Robert Murray Macgre gor now belongs to \u2014 Mowbray, Esq., banker; and several other tespectable families have resi dences here. Many of the inhabitants are employed in weaving linen for the Darlington manufacturers. There is a Methodist chapel here, which was first opened in 1827; and, besides the National School (see Charities), there is a day-school kept by a master. Hurworth is the re sidence of a surgeon, and contains four public houses, with grocers,* shopkeepers, butchers, smiths, and other tradesmen. -f- * On June 25, 1829, during a storm of thunder and lightning, tbe electric fluid descended upon tbe house occupied by Mr. Charles Gascoine, grocer, Hurworth, splitting the shop door, and knocking down bis infant child, which was standing near the same. The maid servant, who at the time was engaged up stairs in making a bed, was thrown to the floor, taken up insensible, and completely blackened by the action ofthe lightning. Medical aid was promptly obtained ; and after two hours of unwearied perseverance on the part of Mr. Walker, surgeon, she was restored to life. t William Emerson, the celebrated mathematician, was the son of Dudley Emerson, of Hurworth, where he was born May 14, 1701. His father, who possessed a small estate, taught a school; and it was from him that William received the first rudiments of education. He afterwards obtained some assistance in the study of the learned languages from the curate of Hurworth, who boarded in his father's house. It was not till he was nearly 20 years of age that he first displayed a love for the beauties of science ; and he placed himself under masters at Newcastle and York for his improvement. After his return to Hurworth. he opened a school, but which was soon resigned; and about his 32d or 33d year, he married a niece of Dr. Johnson, rector of Hurworth, who had promised to give her \u00a3500 as a marriage portion. Some time after the mar- riage, Mr. Emerson took an opportunity to mention this matter to the Doctor, who did not recollect, or did not choose to recollect, any thing of it, but treated the mathematician with some contempt, as a person of no consequence, and beneath his notice. Emerson (who had as independent a spirit as any man, and whose patrimony, though not large, was equal to all his wants) would easily have surmounted the pecuniary disap- pointment ; but this contemptuous treatment stung him to the very soul. He immediately went home, packed up his wife's clothes, and sent them off to the Doctor, saying he would scorn to be beholden to such a fellow for a single rag; and swearing, at. the same time, that he would be revenged, and prove himself to be the better man ofthe two. His plan of revenge was truly noble and laudable. He was resolved to de-- monstrate to his uncourteous uncle, and to the world, that he was not to be rated as an insignificant or igno- rant person ; and, in order to prove this, he determined to labour till he became one of the first mathemati- cians of the age. Iu his 42d year, he published his book of Fluxions ; and, at his first appearance in the world as an author, stepped forth like a giant in all bis might, and justly claimed a place amongst mathematicians ofthe very first rank. Having thus secured his- fame upon a firm and solid basis, he continued, from time to time, to favour and instruct the public with other most valuable publications upon the several branches of the mathe matics. These appeared in the following order: \u2014 In 1J43, Fluxions, 8vo. ; in 1749, Projections of the Sphere, and Elements of Trignometry, 8vo. ; in 1754, Mechanics, 4to. ; in 1755, Navigation, 12mo. ; in 1763, Arithmetic and Geometry, 8vo., and Method of Increment, 4to. ; in 1764, Algebra, 8vo. ; in 1767, Arithmetic of Infinites and Conic Sections, 8vo. ; in 1768, Elements of Optics and Perspective. 8vo. ; in 1709, Astronomy, Mechanics, Centripetal and Centrifugal Forces, 8vo. ; in 1770, Mathematical Principles of Geography, Navigation, and Dialling; Comment on the Principia, with the Defence of Newton ; Tracts, 8vo. ; and in 1776, Miscellanies, 8vo., which was his last work. Besides the above, he wrote several fugitive pieces in the Ladies Diaries, the Miscellanea Curiosa Mathematica, and other periodical and miscellaneous works, sometimes under the signature Merones (formed by a transposition of the letters of his name), and sometimes under the still more whimsical one of Pliilufliicntimechanalgegcomastrolongo, and probably under several others. Mr. Emerson was, in person, something below the common size, but firm, compact, and well made, very active and strong. He had a good, open, expressive countenance, with a ruddy complexion, a keen and pe netrating eye, and an ardour and eagerness of look that was very expressive of tlie texture of his mind. His."], [112, "DARLINGTON WARD.-S.E. D. 98 The Church * Stands immediately on tbe edge of the river bank. This edifice was so small, that latterly the1 greater part of the parishioners were excluded for want of accommodation. In 1831 and 1832, dress was \\-ery simple and plain, or what, by the generality of people, perhaps, would bave been called gro tesque and shabby. A very few hats served him through the whole course of his life ; and when he purchased one (or, indeed, any other article of dress), it was a matter of perfect indifference to him whether the form and fashion of it was that of the day, or of half a century before. One of these hats, of immense superficies, had, in length of time, lost its elasticity, and the brim of it began to droop in such a manner as to prevent him from viewing the objects before him in a direct line. This was not to be endured by an optician : he therefore took a pair of shears, ancl cut it round close to the body of the hat, leaving a little to tbe front, which he dexterously rounded into the resemblance of a jockey's cap. His wigs were made of brown or dirty flaxen coloured hair, which at first appeared bushy and tortuous behind, but grew pendulous through age, till, at length, it became quite straight, having, probably, never undergone the operation of the comb ; and, either through the original mal-conformation of tbe wig, or from a custom he had of frequently inserting his hand behind it, bis hind-head and wig never came into very close contact. His coat, or more properly jacket. which he constantly wore without any waistcoat, was of a drab colour. His linen came not from Holland or Hibernia, but was spun and bleached by his wife, and woven at Hurworth, being calculated more for warmth and duration than for shew. He had a singular custom of frequently wearing, especially in cold weather, his shirt with the wrong side before, and buttoned behind the neck. But this was not an affectation of singu larity : he bad a reason for it ; \u2014 he seldom buttoned more than two or three of the buttons of his jacket, one or two at the bottom, and sometimes one at tbe top, leaving all the rest open. In wind, rain, or snow, there fore, he must have found the aperture at the breast inconvenient if bis shirt had been put on in the usual manner. His breeches bad an antique appearance, the lappet before not being supported by two buttons placed in a line parallel to tbe horizon, but by buttons descending in a line perpendicular to it. In cold wea ther, he used to wear, when he grew old, what he called shin-covers- Now, these shin-covers were made of old sacking, tied with a string above the knee, and depending before the shins down to the shoe ; they were useful in preserving his legs from being burnt when be sat too near the fire (which old people are apt to do) ; and if they had their use, he was not solicitous about the figure or appearance they might make. This singularity of dress, together with his character for profound learning, and knowledge more than hu man, caused him to be considered, by ignorant and illiterate people in the neighbourhood, as a wise or cunning man, or conjuror. It is related that, by virtue of a magic spell, he pinned a fellow to the top of his pear or cherry-tree, who had got up with a design to steal his fruit, and compelled him to sit there a whole Sunday forenoon, in full view of the congregation going to and returning from church. That he did compel a man to sit for some time in the tree was a fact ; not, however, by virtue of any magic spell, but by standing at the bottom of the tree, with a hatchet in his hand, and swearing that if he came down he would hag (i. e. hew) bis legs off. This opinion of his skill in the black art was of service in defending his property from such de predation, and therefore it would have been impolitic to discourage it : but he was apt to lose his patience when he was applied to for the recovery of stolen goods, or to investigate the secrets of futurity. A woman came one day to him to inquire about her husband, who had gone six years before to tbe West Indies or America, and had not been heard of since. She requested, therefore, to be informed whether he was dead or living, as a man in her neighbourhood had made proposals of marriage to her. It was with much difficulty the supposed prophet repressed the rising furor till the conclusion of the tale ; when, hastily rising from the tripod, or three-footed stool, on which he usually sat, in terms more energetic than ever issued from the shrine at Delphi, he gave this plain and unequivocal response : \" D \u2014 n thee for a b \u2014 h ! thy husband's \"one to hell, and thou may go after him.\" The woman went away, well pleased and satisfied with the answer she had received, thinking she might now listen to the proposals of her lover with a safe conscience. Emerson was by some people looked upon as an atheist ; but be was as much an atheist as he was a magi cian. He firmly believed in the being ofa God; he did not believe it, as he sometimes said, \u2014 he knew it he was certain of it, to a demonstration. But it must be acknowledged that he did not always speak of re vealed religion, the Church of England, or tbe clergy, in terms of respect. He set himself to work to exa mine the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament, and collected two small quarto volumes of what he conceived to be contradictory passages, and arranged them, like hostile troops confronting each other, on the opposite pages of his book. His diet was as simple and plain as his dress ; and his meals pave little inter- ruption to his studies, employments, or amusements. During his days of close application, he seldom sat"], [113, "HURWORTH. 99 however, the whole body of the church was taken down, and rebuilt on a large scale, by means of which 400 free sittings and a sufficient number of additional pews were obtained. The low square tower to the west is all that now remains of the ancient building*. It was intended to suffer the <_. old pillars and arches forming the side-aisles to stand ; but, on removing the exterior walls, they down to eat, but would take a piece of cold pie or meat of any kind in his hand, and, retiring with it to his place of study, could satisfy his appetite for knowledge and food at the same time. He catered for himself, and pretty constantly made his own market. When bis stock of groceries or other necessaries grew low, on the Monday morning he took his wallet, which he slung obliquely across his shoulders, and set forward for the market at Darlington. After having provided all the necessary articles, he did not always make di rectly home again ; but, if he found good fair ale, and company to bis mind, he would sit himself down con tentedly in some public house, for the remainder of tbe day, and frequently during the night too : sometimes he did not reach home till late on Tuesday or even Wednesday. He remained talking or disputing on va rious topics \u2014 mechanics, politics, or religion, \u2014 just as his company might be, varying the scene sometimes with a beef-steak, mutton-chop, or a pan of hot cockles; for it is remarkable, that his ale did not injure, but rather improve his appetite, and that be never felt the head-ache, or any immediate ill effects afterwards. The last time he made an excursion to Darlington with his wallet, our philosopher made a figure truly con spicuous : this was the only time be ever rode thither, and he was then mounted on a quadruped whose in trinsic value, independent of the skin, might be fairly estimated at half-a-crown. Being preceded and led by a boy, hired for that purpose, he crawled in slow and solemn state, at the rate of a mile and a half in an hour, till in due time be arrived at Darlington, and was conducted, in tbe same state, to the great entertain ment of the spectators, through the streets to the inn where he wished to refresh himself and his beast. What idea Emerson himself entertained of the velocity with which the animal could move, appears from this, that when a neighbour of his, from Hurworth, asked him, towards the evening, if he was going home, \" D \u2014 n thee,\" said he, \" what dost thou want with my going home?\" \u2014 \"Only,\" said tbe man, \"because I should be glad of your company.\" \u2014 \" Thou fool, thou !\" rejoined the other, \" thou'lt be at home long enough before me, man. Thou walks, and I ride!\" It is pretty certain that if any reward or recompense had been offered to Emerson for bis mathematical labours, and had not come to him in his own way, he would not have accepted it. He did not wish to be admitted a fellow of tbe Royal Society, \" because,\" he said, \" it was a d \u2014 n'd hard thing, that a man should burn so many farthing candies as he had done, and then have to pay so much a year for the honour of F. R. S. after his name. D \u2014 n them, and their F. R. S. too.\" Inheriting a small patrimonial estate of about \u00a360 or \u00a370 a year, he was as independent and happy as if he bad enjoyed so many thousands. He was never known to ask a favour, or seek the acquaintance ofa rich man, unless he possessed some eminent qualities of mind. Notwithstanding his imperfect and desultory course of education, he acquired a general knowledge of me dicine, music, and most other sciences. He was very fond of angling ; and, while he thus amused himself, would stand up to his middle in water for several hours together. When he was building a house upon the small farm which he possessed by the side of the Tees, he never hesitated to plunge into the water, for the purpose of collecting stones from the bed of the river. He was affected, about that time, with some slight gouty symptoms, and said that wading was serviceable to him, because the water sucked the gout out of his legs. When he wrote his Treatise on Navigation, he must needs make and fit up a small vessel ; and, with this, he and some young friends embarked on tbe river Tees, that ran by his door at Hurworth ; but the whole crew got swamped frequently ; when Emerson, smiling, and alluding to his book, said, \" They must not do as I do, but as I say.\" During the greatest part of his life, Mr. Emerson had enjoyed strong and uninterrupted health ; but, as he advanced in years, he was afflicted with the stone and gravel to an excruciating degree. In the agony of these fits, he would crawl round the floor on his hands and knees, sometimes praying and sometimes swear ing, and devoutly wishing that the mechanism of the human frame had been so contrived as to go to wreck without all that clitter-my-clatter, as he called it. As he grew weaker, the violence of the disease abated ; and he died, at last, apparently without much pain, on the 28th of May, 1782, in the 81st year of his age, having previously disposed of his books and instruments. His wife survived him nearly two years. They had no children. With much difficulty, he had been persuaded by his friend, Dr. Cloudesley, of Darlington, to sit for his picture, which was taken hy Sykes. Emerson, like other great men, had his foibles and defects. He was singular and uncouth in his dress and manners, and hasty and impetuous in his temper ; but whatever failings he had, they were overbalanced by his virtues. He had a great, firm, and independent mind, that could not be brought to submit to any thing vol. 11.\u2014 31. 2 D"], [114, "DARLINGTON WARD.\u2014 S. E.

A subscription was collected, and a school-room was built on part of the waste belonging to the township of Hurworth.

Pour's House. \u2014 On July 16, 1730, Anthony Robinson, with the consent of John Johnson, rector, in con- sideration of \u00a358, sold to William Harrison the Church-row House, with the appurtenances, in Hurworth, late in his occupation, for the use of tbe poor of the parish of Hurworth, according to the usage and custom of the said Church-row tenants, under the yearly rent of 4s. This house is held by the overseers of the township of Hurworth, as a poor-house, at a good rent of \u00a310, 10s. This is paid to the rector and church- wardens, and distributed bv them about Christmas amongst the poor ofthe parish, in sums varying from Is. to 3s., six parts out of ten in the township of Hurworth, and the remainder in the township of Nesbam.

This sum is in the hands of William Ward, Esq., of Nesham, who pays interest at four per cent. The amount is divided equally between the two townships of the parish, and the respective shares are given away by the rector and churchwardens, with the produce of the preceding charity. Hurworth Place is a hamlet at the north end of Croft Bridge, 3f miles south from Darlington, and opposite to the village of Croft* in Yorkshire. Here is an extensive depot for coals, with a range of staiths for their delivery into carts, connected with the Stockton and Darlington Railway by a branch, which was opened October 27, 1829, amidst great rejoicings.

Croft is a neat and pleasant village, surrounded by gardens, and containing several good bouses, most of which are respectably fitted up as lodgings, to ac commodate the numerous visitors that resort hither during the summer season. Tbe resident population, in 1831, amounted to 375 persons; and the annual value of property, in 1815, was \u00a35135. The church, which is dedicated to St. Peter, stands immediately opposite the end of the bridge, and is a large and vene rable Gothic structure. A thorn bush grows on the top of the tower. This picturesque appendage was, some years ago, ordered by a dignitary of the Establishment to be removed; but, though cut down, it has again sprouted forth, to adorn with its freshness the antique pile whereon it has taken root. The living is a rectory, in the archdeaconry of Richmond and diocese of Chester, valued in the King's Books at \u00a321, 8s. 4d., and now in the incumbency of the Rev. James Dalton. There is a ladies' boarding school at Croft Hall, and a circulating library in the village. The mineral water called Croft Spa contains hepatic air, calcareous earth, Epsom salt, and sea salt ; and resembles the Harrowgate Sulphur Spa, both in smell and medicinal properties. It is much used both for bathing and drinking. A handsome hotel and posting-house was built at Croft some years ago by Mr. Chaytor.

From a passage in the life of St. Benedict, by St. Gregory the Great, it has been inferred that there were, in the time of that patriarch, monasteries of religious women, over whom be had full authority. It is not, however, certain whether they dwelt in convents or in their own private houses ; and as the rule of St. Benedict was made for men only, it is more probable that monasteries of virgins were not established till after bis death. F. Mabillon seems to fix tbe origin of Benedictine nuns about 620; but there were several deviations made from the rule at various times. Speed describes their habit as \" a black robe, with a scapular of the same, and under the black robe a tunick of wool that has not been dy'd, if it can be had ; others wear the tunick quite white. When they go to the choir, or upon other solemn occasions, they wear over all a black coul, like those of the monks.\" The same writer adds, \" There are some who exactly observe the rule of St. Benedict, who never eat flesh, unless they are sick ; who rise at midnight to mattins, and who fast strictly from tbe festival of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross till Easter. Others, who call themselves mitigated, eat flesh three times a week, that is, on Sundays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays ; excepting only during the Advent and Septuage sima, and from the Ascension to Whitsuntide, according to the regulation they pretend was made by the Holy See. They rise not at midnight to mattins, but some say them at nine at night, and others at four or five iu the morning.\""], [120, "106 DARLINGTON WARD\u2014 S. E. D. the earliest of which is a confirmation by Henry II. The family of Fitz-Ralph made successive grants of the lands around the abbey, and of the right of grinding at their manor-mill without multure. Roo-er de Conyers gave 17 acres in Bishopton, with such right of common as belongs to one oxgang of 24 acres; Bishop Hugh gave two acres at Wayngate-letch ; in 1258, Innocent Domini Pap\u0153 Scriptor, procurator of the church of Haighton, released to tbe nuns of Nesham all right to the tithes of Little Burdon ; William de Clifford granted an annual pension of ten marks out of the rectory of Washington ; and the nuns also possessed rents and property in Hart lepool and other places. Bishop Neville, by his charter, dated May 12, 1450, granted licence to the prioress and convent to receive from Hugh Forster 5s. rent out of a burgage in North Auckland, and 4s. out of another burgage of John Spence. Bishop Booth, in the third year of his pontificate, confirmed the same. In the 13th year of Bishop Neville, the prioress had licence to purchase houses in Darlington. In 1350, Margaret occurs prioress of Nesham. In 1428, Joan de Egleston, the prioress, having resigned, the same Joan, together with Dame Joan Tympton, Dame Alice Bewlof, Dame Margaret Hawyck, Dame Margaret de Witton, Dame Agnes de Tudhowe, Dame Beatrix de Kyllow, and Dame Joan de Blaykeston, nuns of the house or priory of Nesham, assembled in their chapter house, by letter supplicated Bishop Langley for licence to elect an abbess ; and their choice fell upon Dame Margaret Danby. Dame Elizabeth Naunton occurs prioress in 1488-1499- Dame Joan Lawson, the last prioress of this monastery, surrendered it into the king's hands, December 29, 1540, before Thomas Leigh, one of the commissioners. According to Dugdale, Nesham Abbey was valued at i?20, 17s. fd. ; but Speed states it at \u00a326, 9s. 9d. In 1553, the following pensions were paid : to Joan Lawson, prioress, \u00a36 ; to Elizabeth Hooper, Margaret Trollop, Joan Lowick, Barbara Middleton, and Elizabeth Hugill, \u00a31, 6s. 8d. each; and to Margaret Dawson, \u00a31. No imputation seems to have been thrown on the inmates of this monastery, who had been limited to eight in number. The prioress survived the dissolution of her house near twenty years. Her will bears date at Nesham ; and it was probably her singular fate to be an honoured guest in those very halls where she had once presided over her little train of female votaries. On September 1, 1540,* Henry VIII., by letters patent, granted to James Lawson, merchant, of Newcastle, (to whom his sister, the prioress, had, in 1537, granted a lease of the possessions of the abbey,) for \u00a3227, 6s., the house and scite of the dissolved monastery of Nesham, the church bells, and burial-ground, and all the bouses, granges, barns, buildings, cartilages, gardens, and orchards, within or adjoining the scite and circuit of the monastery ; besides the possessions be longing thereto in Nesham, Hurworth, Dinsdale, Little Burdon, and Cockfield, to hold of the crown in chief, by the service of the twentieth part of a knight's fee, subject to a crown-rent of 25s. 3d. at the Feast of St. Michael the Archangel only.

Wood says, \" While he continued in that house which was at least three years, he avoided, as much as he could, the rough paths of Logic and Philosophy, and traced those smooth ones of Poetry and Roman History, in which at length he did excel.\" He after-"], [121, "HURWORTH. 107 the wife of Henry Jennison, of Winyard.* April 4, 1666, Sir John Lawson, Bart., (probably a trustee for Braithwaite) granted two full parts of Nesham Abbey to John Ramsay, Esq., and one third part to Nicholas Pearson, Gent., who appears to bave been a trustee for Thomas Jennison. The heirs of Jennison, in 1672, granted this third part to Thomas Cooper, of Sedgefield, chirurgeon, from whose descendants it passed to Thomas Holme, Gent. The other parts of the abbey lands were divided into several independent freeholds. In 1684, the freeholders in Nesham were, Sir John Lawson, Bart. (Yorkshire) ; Robert Burnett, Gent., in Yorkshire ; Miles Garry ; the heirs of George Sayer ; Noah Pilkington, of Darlington ; the heirs of Thomas Lumley ; John Waite ; and Thomas Mowrey. Of Nesham Abbey not one stone remains upon another. Just to the west of the village, ancl near the ford, a small runner falls into the Tees, and here, in a level grass field, some traces of foundations are still distinguished.

It is probable that he found considerable amusement in the wild scenes which he has described; though it may be hoped that tbe account of his nuptial evening is only spoken in character: \u2014 \" Thence to Darlington, where I boused, All night long by th' pot I tarry'd, Till at length I was espoused. As if I had not been marry'd.\" In his latter days, he removed to Appleton, near Richmond in Yorkshire, upon what his biographer calls \" an employment, or rather a second marriage.\" He died there May 4, 1673, and was buried at Catterick, \"leaving behind him the character ofa well-bred gentleman and a good neighbour.\" * The following extracts from the Sequestrators' Books (which relate to the whole parish) mention this estate : \u2014 \" Apud Sadberge, die Ven'is, 23 Aug. 1644. \"Lawson's lands in Hurworth \u00a3200 and \u00a3100, and Neesham \u00a3150, \u00a360, late belonginge to James Law son, an infant, \u00e6tatis 16, deceased, is now descended upon two coheirs, viz. 1. \u2014 Braithwait, in AVestmore land, plen\u00e6 \u00e6tatis ; and 2. \u2014 Jennyson, sonne of Mr. Henry Jeiinyson, \u00e6tat. 14 or 15.

The village contains a school, two shopkeepers, a blacksmith, a joiner, and three public houses ; and the township includes five or six farms.-)- The halo which successful love can shed over even more indifferent landscapes, was scarcely wanting to inspire Braithwaite with his enumeration of the beauties of Nesham : \u2014 \" Thence to Nesham, now translated, Once a nunnery dedicated.

This extensive parish is bounded by Hurworth on the south, by Dinsdale on the south-east, by Long-Newton on the east, by Bishopton, Stainton, and Aycliffe on the north, by Heigbino-ton on the north-west, and by Darlington on the west.

No great integral manor appears in Haughton at any time, the lands having been held in va- rious proportions immediately under the bishop. Boldon Book distinguishes Magna and Parva Haighton. In the former, the villains held nine oxgangs, and paid for each oxgang 12d. rent, harrowed wheat four days, mowed two days, and led hay two days with one wain, and the same service in corn harvest; and from the Feast of St. Peter ad Vincula to Martinmas, the tenant of each oxgang worked for the lord two days the first week, and one day the second week, and tilled four portions in autumn and harrowed half an acre, and harrowed one day with one horse, threshed half a chalder of wheat, and carried one wain load of wood ; all which rents and services might be altered at the bishop's pleasure. Gilbert held 40 acres for 2s. rent, in exchange for the land which his father held in drengage ; he was to assist at the autumn tillage, and to serve on embassies. O O 7 o -** The son of Aldred held 40 acres by a similar exchange. Walter, son of Sigge, held two oxgangs of 36 acres for 12s. rent. Richard Dune held 37 acres de Foresta, and paid the first year 4s.

Ten cottagers paid 5s. 6d., and each gave the lord nine days' work in a year, and worked at the autumn tillage and in hav harvest Walter de Halcton was farmer of the demesne, with a stock of four ploughs and four harrows, and with the sown land specified in his indenture, the grange, ox-house, and close court, and paid 20 marks. Two tofts were in the bishop's bands. In Parva Haighton were five tenants, each holding a toft and croft and eight acres, and paying 5s. 6d., and \" on another score11 one mark for 40 acres. Adam de Selby held the demesne in farm, with a stock of two ploughs and two harrows, the sown land, tbe grange, and fold-yard, and paid eight marks; and he provided the bishop's litter when he journeyed by Derlyngton, and kept tbe bishop's manor-house and court there, and whatsoever matters were brought thither, at his own charges, in consideration of a certain cultivated field called Hacdale. The pasture, with the sheep, was reserved in the bishop's bands; but Adam had liberty to keep 100 sheep there as long as he was farmer of the demesne. Burdon mill paid for the mill- pool, which was on Haughton land, 12s. It was probably after the date of Boldon Book that Bishop Hugh granted Little Haughton to William, son of William, son of the King Stephen. Hatfield's Survey mentions as Free Tenants, Robert Plomer, a messuage and two oxgangs by foreign service and 2s.

The other half was in the hands of the bishop, and the bailiff of Darlington reckoned for it in his account. This manor contained eight carucates, of 120 acres each, worth a groat an acre; and nine acres of meadow in Halekeld holm, [the hay of] which used to be sold for 46s. 8d., were in the hands of the said bailiff.

There was a common forge let to a smith for 8s. The Inglebys of Hurworth held property here for several descents; and the Wakerfiehls held lands under them by the service ofa red rose on St. John the Baptist's day. The Greystanes pos sessed a freehold ; and some small portions belonged to the Earls of Warwick, and afterwards to the Earls of AVestmoreland. Little Haughton continued in the family of Le Scrop from tbe time of Hatfield's Survey till the reign of Elizabeth, when it passed to Thomas Pudsey, of Barford, Esq., who married Elizabeth, sister to the last Henry Lord Scrope of Bolton. The Pudseys, by successive grants, conveyed Haughton-field to John Barnes, Clerk (rector of Haughton, and bro ther of Bishop Barnes), who died in 1590, leaving Anne and Margery, bis daughters, coheirs. Anne became the wife of William Place, Gent., and died without issue ; and Margery married William Lambton, of Stainton, Esq. On the death of their son, William Lambton, without issue, Haughton-field passed to his sisters, Anne, married to Nicholas Chaytor, Esq., and Margaret, the wife of John Killinghall, Esq. In 1684, the freeholders in Haughton township were, Sir William Chaytor, Bart., and William Killinghall, Esq., Haughton-field ; Thomas Birbecke, Gent., in West moreland ; John Warcopp, Gent, in Yorkshire; Sir John Lowther, Bart., in Westmoreland; Chris topher Dickon, Thomas Dickon, of London; and Thomas Dickon the younger. The principal proprietors here at present are, Captain Colling ; James Crow, Esq. ; Mrs. VValdy, of Yarm ; and John Richmond, Esq. On the 9th of April, 1666, a decree was obtained in the bishop's court, for a division and inclo sure in Haughton. There was assigned to the bishop, in lieu of his waste in the township, a parcel of ground called Dickins's Parrock, containing 1 acre, 1 rood, and 17 perches of land. The rector bad assigned to him East and West Holmes, Houndwell's, Wetings, and Burdon Briggs, together with 28 acres, in lieu of 36 cattlegates. The village of Haughton-le-Skerne consists principally of one street of good houses, on a dry and gravelly soil, on the north bank ofthe Skerne river, li miles east-north-east from Darlino*ton, for the manufacturers of which town many of the inhabitants are employed in weavino* coarse linens. Here is a large shoe-thread manufactory (formerly a flour-mill), belonging to the Messrs. Parkers, situated on the Skerne, and worked both by water and steam. The village contains two public houses, with butchers, shopkeepers, tradesmen, and mechanics ; also a circulating library, kept by Mr. Matthew Scotson, schoolmaster, who is chief constable for the South-east Division of Darlington Ward. In 1825, the Wesleyan Methodists built a neat chapel at Haughton. Cap tain Colling has recently erected a residence on the south bank of the Skerne, immediately oppo site the town, called the Red Hall : it is of stone, with steep sloping roofs, projectino* o*ables &c. ancl presents a somewhat singular specimen, in the present day, of that style of architecture. The township includes about a dozen farms,"], [125, "HAUGHTON-LE-SKERNE. 111 The Church Stands at the west end of the village. It is a plain, spacious structure, consisting of a chancel, a nave without aisles, and a west tower. The entrance is by a porch on the south, in which is a cir cular arch, springing from Norman capitals, and now partly closed up. Tbe chancel opens under a circular arch, and, with the altar-table, is wainscotted with oak in the Gothic style. The pulpit and reading-desk (on each side of the entrance into tbe chancel), and the pews in the nave, are also of oak, ornamented with fleurs-de-lis. There is a gallery at the west end of the church. The east window is a modern sash under a circular arch ; the south window of the chancel consists of five lights under a pointed arch ; and the rest of the windows are irregular. Above one of the south windows of the nave, a circular arch is built up in the wall, with ornaments of human heads ; and there are several other traces of early antiquity. The late rector placed the whole structure in a creditable state of repair and neatness, and erected a convenient vestry of brick on tbe north side of the chancel.* There was a guild in this church, dedicated to St. Mary; and, in the year 1498, John Esh took of the lord one cottage, with its appurtenances, formerly Robert Johnson's, which Edward Bechem surrendered to John, to be held by him and bis sequels, for the use of the guild of St. Mary, in the church of Haughton.

E. D. 114 The parsonage, which was repaired and improved by the late incumbent, is a spacious conVe-\u00bb nient double house, with a good garden, situated to the north-west of the church, and sheltered on the south and west by a shrubbery and forest trees. The glebe consists of 249 acres, 2 roods, and 1 perch, of which the greatest part lies in Haughton township, and the rest in Coatham and Sadberge. The rector is generally entitled to tithes, excepting that the townships of Barmpton, Sadberge, Coatham, and Morton, pay moduses respectively for hay of 4s. 6d., 18s. 8d., \u00a31, and 5s. Whessoe pays a modus of _\u00a3T, High and Low Beaumond Hill i?3, 4s., and Greystones and Humbleton \u00a31, 13s. 4d., for corn and hay. All these pay small tithes in kind. There are also small portions of tithes received from the townships of Darlington and Cockerton. There is a prescriptive payment of 8s. out of the rectory of Haughton to the rector of Long-Newton, and another of __?1, 18s. at Pentecost to the rector of Egglescliffe. The rector has a copyhold manor extending over a part of the township of Haughton. The tenure is very simple, the house or land passing merely by entry in the book of the manor with tbe consent of the rector, testified by his signature :* the quit-rents are trifling, about \u00a33, Ils. per annum for the whole. Charities. School. \u2014 About the year 1768, a subscription was commenced for the institution of a day-school at Haugh ton ; and, with the help of \u00a350 from Lord Crewe's trustees, \u00a3145, 15s. was raised. This sum, which before was left at interest in the rector's hands, was, in 1808, employed by the parish, together with Mrs. Alexan der's charity mentioned below, in building poor-houses for Haughton, on the rector's waste and part of the glebe. The sum of \u00a3-1, 10s. is paid half-yearly to the rector by tbe churchwardens and overseers for these cottages, together with ls. per annum as a ground-rent; and a memorandum states, that \u00a3140 ofthe above money belongs to the school, and \u00a340 to the poor. In the Jubilee year (October 29, 1809), the Sunday school was established by subscription ; and, in 1815, a commodious school-house was built on the glebe, by leave ofthe bishop, including separate rooms for the boys and girls, and lodging-room for tbe master. The expense of this erection amounted to \u00a3368, 17s-, including fixtures. Tbe principal subscribers were, the bishop, \u00a350 ; the Diocesan Society for Parochial Schools, \u00a350 ; the dean and chapter of Durham, \u00a330 ; Lord Crewe's trustees, \u00a330; the Rev. T. Le Mesurier, \u00a330; stirs. Judith Dobree (an aunt ofthe rector), \u00a330; the Rev. Robert Croft, \u00a320; Robert Surtees, of Mainsforth, Esq., \u00a310; Mr. Waldy, \u00a310; and Mr. Robert Colling, \u00a310. Some additions were made to tbe master's house at a subsequent period, the expense of which, amounting to \u00a343, was paid bv the master ; but \u00a327 was repaid to him from money given for that purpose by stirs. Dobree and other contributors. The schoolmaster receives \u00a37 per annum, as the in terest of the above \u00a3140; besides an augmentation from the subscribers to the Sunday-school. All the children of the parish who apply are admitted to the day-school at a reduced quarterage, varying from 2s. to 5s. There are from 50 to 70 children on an average, who are taught reading, writing, and accounts. They find their own paper; but the master provides slates and pencils, and the rector furnishes a great many of them with books. The Commissioners for inquiring concerning Charities mention a sum of \u00a386, 9s. 7d-, belonging to the Sunday-school, in the savings bank at Darlington, the interest of which was added to the principal, in order to form a fund to supply any incidental deficiency in the subscriptions. The Sun day-school is attended by about 160 children. Barker's- Charily. \u2014 Thomas Barker, by will, in 1686, bequeathed a rent-charge of 20s. from an estate in Newbiggin, in the parish of Bishopton, to be distributed at Easter to the poor of the parish of Haughton. This sum is received from the tenant of the Marquis of Londonderry at Newbiggin, and distributed at Eas ter as hereafter mentioned.

Donor unknown. \u2014 An estate in Sadberge, the property, in 1789, of Elizabeth Ward, widow of John Ward, is charged with 9s. per annum for tbe poor of tbe parish of Haughton. A close at Sadberge, containing be- tween 2 and 3 acres, known by the name of the Charity Field, is now the property of John Richmond, Esq., who pays the above sum, which, together with the two preceding rent-charges of \u00a31 and \u00a31, 4s., amounting altogether to \u00a32, 13s. per annum, are divided at Easter among the several townships ofthe parish (except Sadberge) in the following manner : \u2014 Haughton, Ils.; Whessoe and Beaumond-Hill, 9s. 2d. ; Morton, )\u2022 8d. ; Barmpton, 10s. 5d. ; Burdon, 7s- lid. ; Coatham-Mundeville, 9s. lOd.

Donor unknown. \u2014 Certain lands called Richardson's Closes, in Sadberge, and said to have been purchased from that family by Steele, are charged with \u00a31, 7s- annually for the poor of the parish of Haughton. This estate belonged, in 1789, to Mrs. Margaret Steel; but tbe payment ofthe rent-charge was discontinued, in 1790, by Richard Steel, who succeeded his sister Margaret in tbe estate. A bill was filed in the Court of Chancery in 1795, at the relation of Miss Vaughan (niece of tbe Rev. W. Vaughan, rector of Haughton), to compel payment. Richard Steel died pending the proceedings, leaving an eldest son, Francis Steel, a brewer at Rochdale, who was out of the jurisdiction of the Durham Court of Chancery ; and the Commis- sioners do not consider that any attempt to establish this payment could be attended with success. Alexander's Charily. \u2014 By will, bearing date February 10, 1789, stirs. Alexander bequeathed to the rector and churchwardens of Haughton the sum of \u00a340, to be by them and their successors placed at interest, and such interest to be distributed on Christmas-eve to such poor inhabitants of the village of Haughton as they shall in their discretion think objects of charity. This sum, as already shewn, was applied in building cot tages. The sum of 40s. is paid out of the poor's rate to the churchwardens, and distributed by them at Christmas, in sums of ls. or 2s. each, to poor persons residing in the township of Haughton. The charities belonging to tbe chapelry of Sadberge will be noticed in the account of that place. Great Burdon Is a small neat village and township, 2 miles east-north-east from Darlington, containing a corn mill and a public house, with a bridge of one arch over the Skerne. This was one of the villages which Henry I. restored to the church of Durham, with Carleton and Aycliffe ; and it is also in cluded in Bishop Flambard's charter of restitution. The whole vill seems to have been granted out under reserved rents assigned to the almoner. In Bishop Hatfield's time, Olivia de Walworth held a messuage and four oxgangs of land of the prior of Durham, and Goceline Surtees held a messuage and two oxgangs, all in Great Burdon. The families of Ingleby and Neville also held lands here. In 1684, the freeholders were, Anthony Garmonsway ; \u2014 Husband, widow, at Dar lington ; and John Hall, Gent., at Durham. At present, Richard Cundell, Esq., and Mrs. Waldy, of Yarm, hold property here. Little Burdon Is situated to the east of Great Burdon, and midway between Haughton and Sadberge. The estate belonged to tbe nuns of Nesham from before 1226; and, at the dissolution, their rents here were valued at 105s. 4tl. Little Burdon was granted, with the rest of the abbey lands, to James Lawson; and, on April 1, 1600, Henry and James Lawson conveyed it to Henry Stapleton and Mary his wife, who granted it, in 1622, to Sir Henry Constable, Viscount of Dunbar. The estate afterwards belonged to Richard Neltborpe, of Norfolk, Esq., on whose attainder for high treason in 168\u2014, Bishop Crewe seized it as a forfeiture, and granted it on trust to his steward, Edward Arden, Esq. ; but Nelthorpe's attainder being reversed under King William, the bishop was vol. 11. 2 PI"], [130, "DARLINGTON WARD\u2014 S. E. D. 116 obliged to restore the lands, with the arrears of rent. In 1720, James Nelthorpe, Esq., conveyed Little Burdon to William Davison, of Beamish, Esq. ; and it is now the property of Morton John Davison, Esq. Morton Consists of a few scattered houses, 3 miles east from Harrington, and contains a public house, a cartwright, and a blacksmith ; and the township includes five farmsteads. Great Morton stands on the south side of the Yarm road, and Morton-Palmes on the north. The former was early the estate of the Surteys's, and, on the division of their possessions, was assigned to Marmaduke Sur tees, whose son, Thomas Surtees, Esq., sold a third of Morton to Thomas and Henry Storie. The whole now belongs to Morton John Davison, of Beamish, Esq. Morton-Palmes is supposed to be the place mentioned in Hatfield's Survey as held by John de Morton and his parceners, by knight's service and 16s. r>\\t\\. rent, and for cornagc at Michaelmas only 20d. Bryan Palmes, a Yorkshire gentleman, from whom this place derives its addition, married tlie heiress of Radclyffc of Tunstall, but, engaging- in the Northern Rebellion, was attainted and forfeited his estates here and at New ton Hansard. Before 1687, two-thirds of Morton-Palmes was sold by Henry Garth, Gent., to Sir William Blackett, Bart., wdio acquired the remaining third from George Morland, Esq., and Mary his wife. In 1698, be alienated this manor, with Nesham, to Charles Turner, of Kirklcatham, Esq. Sadberge. The county or wapentake of Sadberge undoubtedly existed as a separate district from a very early period. King Richard I., when preparing for the Crusades, sold it, with tbe earldom of Northumberland for life,* for __?11,000, to the magnificent Hugh Pudsey, bishop of Durham; a transaction which, while it replenished the coffers of the king, drained as they had been for the purposes of his expedition, also gratified the ambition of the prelate. -f- Tlie charter grants, \" The manor of Sadberg, with the wapentake to the same manor pertaining; and the service of Peter Carun of one knight's fee for Seton and Oveton ; the service of Thomas Amundevill of one knight's fee for Cotham and Tryford ; and the service of the son of Godfrey Baard for two parts of a knight's fee in Midelton and Hertburn ; with sac and soc, toll and theem, and infangnetliefe,:]; and all franchises and customs, and with pleas of the crown, in such manner as we held tbe same whilst we retained it yet in our bands, and as tbe bishop holds his other lands and knights' fees within bis bishopric ; and the bishop and bis successors may dispose of the same lands and lieges to the * It was probably from the latter circumstance that Sadberge has been erroneously styled an earldom.

Baliol agreed to do suit at Sadberge for Long-Newton ; but that place seems to have been generally held parcel of the great honour of Gainford. In the time of Bishop Langley, it was asserted that Barnard Cas tle, Marwood, Cleatlam, Eggleston, Langton, Middleton in Teesdale, Newbiggin, Stainton, ancl other places in the western extremity of tbe county of Durham, were members of this wapentake. -f A court of assize was held at Sadberge by tlie justices itinerant, commissioned by the bishops of Durham ;| also a county court, in which the sheriff of Sadberge sat, and where causes were tried, fines of lands levied, and escheats taken on the decease of free tenants within the county or wapen take of Sadberge, the earliest of which on record were taken under Lewis Beaumont. At what time this court was discontinued is not known ; though it appears, from a letter in the court of Durham, that, as late as 1611, Christopher and Francis Hall intended to prove the will of Dorothy Pinckney, widow, at Sadberge. There was a castle here, and a gaol for prisoners ; and sundry * It sometimes happened that one person held the same office for both the county and Sadberge ; but there were always distinct patents for each. + Lambarde, after speaking of the sale to Bishop Pudsey, adds, \" This Satberge was at that tyme and longe sence called a countye, conteyninge (as I thinke) the greatest portion of that which we now calle the byshopricke of Durham. I heare of some gentlemen of that quarter, that theare be dyvers fines yet extant, acknowledged before the bishop in his court of Satberge, and that the most part ofthe countrye resorted to courte thyther, which gyveth me to thinke, that it should be called SACBERGE, of Sac and bypig (the Saxon wordes), which signitie the court of causes or plees, from which signification Socburgb before is not muebe different.

E. D. 118 manors and lands were held by the special service of maintaining the same, and supporting the prisoners. The bailiff's common fee was 40s. The main road into the county from the south was by Pounteys Bridge through Sadberge, J J O c *-> By Hatfield's Survey, the lands were all held by military service. William Faweon held four burgages and 30| acres of land in the fields by fealty and suit of court, from three weeks to three weeks, and paying a double relief; and be, with others, holding lands within the wapentake, (to wit) the Baron of Greystock, the prioress of Nesham, Robert de Ogle, Walter Tailbois, Isabel the widow of John Percy de Kildale, John de Aslayby, the heirs of Alexander Surteys, and others, had the keeping of the gaol and prison, and were answerable for the escape of prisoners; and William aforesaid paid at Easter and Michaelmas by equal portions 4s. 8d. There were forty-one, together with Faweon, who held eighty-four burgages and lands under the same tenure. Besides these ancient burgagers, the following new ones are specified in the Survey : Robert Marshall, one messuage and 17 acres, sometime of Thomas tbe chaplain, Ils., and one place called Sherwynde's place, ld. ; Agnes, daughter of John Rogerson, a tenement called Hernyngber's-place, which used to pay 21d., then 18d. ; Henry de Ingleby and four others held one forge, one burgage, and three plots or places, under certain rents. The demesne lands are stated to consist of 23 oxgangs, each containing 16 acres. Numerous subdivisions of property occur here. Amongst other proprietors may be named, in Bishop Beaumont's time, Kays and Mortons ; in Bishop Bury's time, Marshalls, Chibburns, and Lucas of Norton ; and in Bishop Hatfield's time, Le Wrays, Waryns, Sherwynds, Hacksmalls, Bedales, Hewetsons, Ings, and sundry others. The Wrays and Marshalls held their lands for many generations. In all these cases, it appears that the burgages were held in free borough te nure, by service at the borough court ; and the lands by military service, and in soccage. In 1684, the freeholders in Sadberge were, Sir Thomas Pennyman, Bart., in Yorkshire ; Robert Cas son, (lands at Newbiggin); Thomas Garmonsway, Minde; Robert Allen, in Yorkshire; Ralph Pemberton, Gent. ; Thomas Reed, of Yarum ; James Nelthorpe, of Little Burdon, Esq., in York shire; the heirs of Richard Garmonsway; Sir William Blackett, Bart., of Morton-Palmes; and John Harrison. The principal proprietors at present are, Sir William Pennyman, Bart.; and John Richmond, Esq., Neicto?i Grange. The village of Sadberge is situated 3 \\ miles east-by-north from Darlington, on tbe crown of a fine eminence, which rises with an easy ascent from every side to such an elevation, that it commands an extensive prospect over the south-east part of the county of Durham, and up Teesdale as far as the high grounds above Barnard Castle, but of no great distance northward. The ground on which the present chapel stands is most elevated ; and as it appears to have been forced, and is trenched round, it may be presumed that there stood the castle, gaol, and court-house, in ancient times. The scite agrees admirably with Lambarde's derivation of \" the Hill of Plees,\" or \" the Court upon the Hylf* The chapel consists of a low nave and chancel, and has evidently been built out of the old squared stones of tbe gaol or manor-bouse. There are monumental inscrip tions in the burying-ground belonging to the families of Pemberton and Garmonsway. The chapel is dedicated to St. Andrew, and in the patronage ofthe rector of Haughton. The living is a cu racy, not in charge nor certified ; and the Rev. C. Piper is tbe present curate. The Wesleyan * Similar elevated situations were generally chosen by the Anglo-Saxons for their courts of popular assembly and provincial jurisdiction."], [133, "HAUGHTON-LE-SKERNE. 119 Methodists have also a small chapel here. The village itself retains few traces of its former im portance ; and all that remains of the ancient privileges of the place is the county pinfold, to which strayed cattle are sometimes brought from distant parts of the county of Durham. Sadberge, however, is a neat, well-built place, consisting chiefly of new brick houses, and with the road from Darlington to Stockton running through it.* Mr. Christopher Richmond has bere a tan-yard ; and there are three public houses, with shopkeepers, wrights, &c. The township includes six farmsteads. Charities. School. \u2014 In 1790, a subscription was commenced by the wealthier inhabitants of Sadberge for thc esta blishment of a school. The bishop of Durham gave \u00a320 towards the building of a school-house, and \u00a35 yearly towards a Sunday-school, which is now attended by all tbe children who live within any convenient distance. The cost of the building was upwards of \u00a363. A salary of \u00a35 a year is paid to the master, in addition to a small contribution from between 20 and 30 day-scholars. There is an annual donation of \u00a35 from the trustees of Lord Crewe's charities, who also contributed to the building. The Commissioners for inquiring concerning Charities state the funds, at the time of their visit, to consist of \u00a3124, 19s. 7d- in the Darlington sayings bank; \u00a3108 stock in the new four per cents, standing in the name of John Richmond, Esq. ; and \u00a340 given by stirs. Dobree, now in the hands of Dr. Bandinel, bearing five per cent, interest. Barker's Charity. \u2014 Thomas Barker, in 1686, left 10s. yearly to the poor of Sadberge, which is received from the tenant of the Marquis of Londonderry at Newbiggin, and paid away as after mentioned. Buck's Charity. \u2014 George Buck, July 18, 1704, gave one-fourth of the proceeds of estates purchased for charitable purposes (see Darlington) to the poor of Sadberge. In 1827, the Commissioners state this pro portion at \u00a35, 5s., which is distributed at a vestry meeting, together with the amount of Barker's gift and other charity money, in sums varying from ls. to 3s. Poor Stock. \u2014 There was a cottage belonging to the poor of Sadberge (from whence derived is not known), which was sold, in 1786, for \u00a314. The Rev. Matthew Soulby, in 1759, bequeathed \u00a320 to the poor of Sadberge. These sums, amounting to \u00a334, were delivered to the present rector, Dr. Bandinel, who placed them in the Darlington savings bank, and agreed to make up \u00a33 yearly on account thereof, whatever inte rest might be received. The overseer gives this sum away with other charity money. Charities of Harrison and others. \u2014 By deed, dated 1720, Frances Harrison, stirs. Davison, Thomas Bar ker, and others, gave \u00a337, the interest to be distributed to the poor of Sadberge. A note of hand for this sum, from the late Sir James Pennyman, of Ormesby, Bart., to the chapel- warden, dated November 8, 1770, was handed over to the Rev. T. Le Mesurier, late rector, by the curate of Sadberge, as outstanding and un paid. It does not appear up to what period the interest was paid ; and the Commissioners think it would now be in vain to attempt the recovery of this money for the benefit of the charity. Barmpton, Formerly Bermton, is a hamlet and township 3 miles north-east from Darlington, with rich low lands on the Skerne. It is the residence of a cartwright and a blacksmith, and, with Skirmingham, contains six farmsteads. The convent of Durham were the superior lords of Bermeton and Skir mingham at a very early date. Two curious charters relative to these estates remain in tbe trea sury: 1.

Berme ton was afterwards leased out by the convent at small monied rents, which, in time, became insig. nificant compared with the value of the land. One third of the manor was granted in 1312 to Walter Gylet, whose descendant sold it in 1403 to Henry Lord Percy, son of Henry Earl of Northumberland, Adam Sparawe, Esq., and Adam Winship and Robert Loblay, chaplains. The other two thirds became vested in the families of Tailbois, Skirmingham, and Lumley; and a fa mily which had assumed the local name occurs in 1350, whose lands were possessed by Goceline Surtees in 1367- In 1397' William de Wakerfield held a messuage and 31 acres of Thomas Col vile, Knt., by knight's service and suit of court. In 1391, Isabel, Lady of Skirmingham, died seized of four messuages and seven oxgangs in Bermeton : her heiress was Joan, daughter of Tho mas de Eshe. Margaret, daughter of Anthony Eshe, carried a chief portion of the manor of Bermton to William Smyth, of Nunstainton,* whose lineal descendant, Sir Edward Smythe, Bart., sold it to Major-general John Lambton, ancestor of Lord Durham. Other portions of Barmpton belong to the Rev. Robert Croft, and Edward Garmondsway Waldy, Esq. Skirmingham is not named from the time of the charters of Prince Henry and Nigel de Albeini, until 1390, on the death of Isabel, Lady of Skirmingham. Joan de Eshe bad three husbands ; but her issue was extinguished in her grandchildren, and the estate passed to a distant branch of the family, and afterwards by marriage to Thomas Norton, who was attainted after the Northern Rebellion. Skirmingham, however, was re-purchased for his son, who granted it for -fl700 to the trustees of Richard Madocks, citizen and goldsmith. A portion of the estate belonged to the family of Porter in 1600. At present, Skirmingham is the estate of Robert Hutton, of Sobergate, in Yorkshire, Esq. Elleyhill belongs to Charles Bacon, of Styford, in Northumberland, Esq. Coathaji-Mundeville, Or Coatham-Amundei-ille, is a hamlet and township, 4 miles north from Darlington, situated on an eminence on the great north road, and near the river Skerne, on the west bank of which is an extensive shoe-thread manufactory, commenced by the late Mr. Thomas Porthouse, and now car ried on by Mr. Isaac Burdon. The township contains six farmsteads and two public houses. This place derives its addition from its earliest recorded owners. About 1200, Thomas de Amundeville granted an oxgang of 13 acres, an acre of meadow, and a toft and croft, to Richard, son of Walter Parson of Halcton, and his heirs by his betrothed wife, paying a pound of cumin seed on St. Cuthbert's day, in autumn, and knight's service as belongs to an oxgang, ofthe whole fee which Thomas Amundeville holds of the crown, viz. nine carucates by the service of one knight. Afterwards, Thomas de Amundeville, of Wotton, sold the manor of Cotum super Scyren to Gab frid Russell, seneschal of Durham, who was, upon his hopes of salvation, to provide and maintain one chaplain to celebrate daily in the chapel of St. Mary Magdalen, of Cotum, for the soul's rest of Thomas de Amundeville, and his parents Ralph and Clarice, and of Richard Tingri, and ofall the faithful departed, with various penalties for non-observance.

The bishop had bis manor-court at Coat ham, where suit was done once in three weeks. Tbe Greystanes and Surtees's were the principal free tenants. In 1684, the freeholders here were, Ralph Tunstall, Clerk, in Lincolnshire ; Wil liam Jackson, Gent.; George Morland, Esq., justice (Greystones) ; William Wilson, of Coatham ball Garth, Gent., at Durham ; John Nicholson, Gent., Doctor of Physick, at York. Coatham-hall Garth, a neat modern house, belonged to the Dalstons, of Acorn-ban k , Westmoreland, whose heiress married Norton, and the heiress of Norton married Hodgson : the estate was sold to the Rev. James Robson, vicar of Aycliffe, and is now by subsequent conveyance the property of Mrs. Eli zabeth Porthouse. The manor of Greystones, which includes Nesbetf, otherwise Humbleton, lies to the west of Coatham, bounded by Coatsay-moor in Heighington on the north, and by Walworth and Arch deacon-Newton on the west, and contains 564 acres. By the successive charters of Thomas Parson of Acle (Aycliffe), and John de Ketton, this estate became the property of the convent of Durham at an early period. In 1447, however, it appears as a free manor, which John Kelynghall held of the bishop, by the service of keeping the gaol of Sadberge, one pound of cumin seed, a pair of spurs, and suit at the manor-court of Cothom. It afterwards passed to the Perkinsons, Tunstalls, Heighingtons, Smythes, and others, until it was purchased of the Morlands, in 1744, by George Surtees, Esq., for <_P4400. Robert Surtees, of Mainsforth, Esq., is the present proprietor. Whessoe and Beaumond-Hill This small township is situated 2 miles north from Darlington. Whessoe lies on the west of the great road, and Beaumond-Hill on rising ground to the east. They contain a few scattered farm houses, and the hamlet called Harroivgate. By Boldon Book, there were in Quosshur 14 oxgangs; the tenant of each paying 12d., working for tbe lord one day in every week, mowing the lord's meadows three days, and tilling four por tions in autumn with the whole family except the housewife ; besides ploughing and harrowing an acre and a half for every plough, and leading a wain load of wood. Toke and Orm, brothers, each held two oxgangs by monied rents and services. Robert Fitz-Meldred (the great lord of Raby) held a carucate, and paid 10s. 8d., tilled four portions, fed a horse and dog, and found four oxen to carry the bishop's wine. A widow held a toft and croft, paid 6d., provided six days' work, and tilled four porcations. Hatfield's Survey mentions John Shepherd and others as bond-tenants, commuting tlieir services for monied rents, in all 26s. 8d. The brewery paid 12d., the forge 4d., for woodlades 3s. 6d., for wodsilver 12d., and ten hens; and the punder paid ten hens. Robert Fitz-Meldred's lands were in the tenure of Jobn Redhode, who, as well as William Queshowe and William Wakirfield, per formed such services as are named in Boldon Book. The vill of Whessoe is still held by lease or copy of court-roll under the see of Durham. In 1 430, Roger Thornton, of Newcastle, merchant, died seized of a messuage and two oxgangs of land bere, each oxo-ane* containing 24 acres. The families of Perkinson and Shepherd held lands in Whessoe for many descents ; and Sir John Lowther (the first Viscount Lonsdale) was owner of Beaumond-Hill in 1684.

The parish of Darlington is bounded on the south by Hurworth, on the east by the same parish and by Haughton-le-Skerne, which latter also encloses it on the north ; Heighington forms its north-western boundary, and the parish of Coniscliffe and the river Tees enclose it on tbe west. The parish includes four townships : 1. Darlington; 2. Blackwell; 3. Cockerton ; and, 4. Arch deacon-Newton. The township of Darlington is subdivided into four constableries : 1.

The entire parish, in 1801, contained 5349 inhabitants; in 1811, 5820; and in 1821, 6551, being 1399 families, in habiting 1026 houses.

History. \u2014 Darlington, or, as it is sometimes written, Derlington,* is a place of high antiquity, and a borough by prescription. Soon after the establishment of the episcopal see at Durham, \" Styr, the son of Ulphus, obtained licence of King Etheldred that he might give Dearningtun, with its dependencies, to St. Cuthbert ; and the donation was solemnized at York before the Archbishop Wulstan, Bishop Aldhunc, and the other nobles who attended the king, with a heavy curse on all who should violate the patrimony of the saint.11 Since that time it has been held under the bishops of Durham. From Turgot, aud other monastic writers, it appears that when William Carilepho removed tbe seculars from the cathedral church in 1082, Darlington was one of the receptacles appointed for that body of religious. A century afterwards, Bishop Pudsey built a mansion-house bere, on the banks of the Skerne, which was the occasional residence of bis successors. The present beautiful church is also said to owe its origin to him. By Boldon Book, in Derlington there were forty-eight oxgangs, which the tenants in villenage held as well under the old as the new bailiwick (from whence it may be inferred that Bishop Hugh had made some alteration in the constitution of tbe place), and paid for each oxgang 5s. Their service consisted of mowing the bishop's meadows, winning and leading the hay, for which work they received a corrody ; inclosing the limits of the court, working at the mill, bringing one load of wood for every oxgang, carrying the bishop's baggage when he travelled, and also carrying yearly three loads of wine, herrings, and salt. There were twelve tenants who each held an ox gang of land, and paid rent as the villains, but did not perform the like services; yet served on the bishop's embassies. Osbert Bate held two oxgangs, paid 22tb, and served on embassies. The sons of Wybert held two oxgangs, for which Gilbert used to pay 8s. ; they paid the same, with an * Hutchinson conjectures the derivation of this name to be from '\"oeop or Deophnj, signifying dilectus, and run or ron, villa, hence a chosen town, built on holy land, and the favourite place of the prelates.\" Surtees says, \" I have somewhere seen that the Skerne was called the Dare ; and Dare-inge-tun would very well represent the actual scite of the place amidst the deep rich inges or meadows of the Skerne.\""], [137, "DARLINGTON. 123 addition of 10s., and served on embassies. Odo held a toft and 33 acres of the culture of Usbert, ... were sown, and paid 10s. only, without services; and in another place 26.'- acres, for which he paid 10s. till Robert, son of William de Mowbray, who was his ward, attained to age Galfrid Joie, 20 acres, 40d. and served on embassies. Lambert held six acres for 12d. rent. The smith held eight acres at the will of the bishop, on condition of providing the iron-work of the ploughs of Little Halcton, and the small iron-work necessary about the court of Derlyngton. Four cot tagers paid 4s. for their tofts, and helped in making mullions (ricks) of hav, and carried fruit and worked at the mill. The punder had nine acres and the thraves, like other punders, and rendered fivescore hens and 500 eggs, Tbe Borough, the dyers, and the Jirmi (rents), paid 10 marks. Tbe mills of Derlyngton, Haighton, and Ketton, paid 30 marks. In 1291, Edward I. was at Darlington, and issued from thence his summons to fifty-seven of tlie chief military tenants in the north, to repair to the wars of Scotland. By Hatfield's Survey, the free tenants were thirty-nine in number, and held sixty-seven parcels of land and messuages, by divers rents, payable at the four usual terms. They held amongst them certain lands, viz. Calfhous, Swatergate, Elesbankes, Sadbergate, Cockyrtongate, Bathel- gate, Duresmgate, Prestgate, and Huraworthgate, by ancient custom, for which the lord received nothing, though they were parcels of his ancient and proper waste. Fourteen tenants held ten oxgangs of the demesne for 20s. rent per oxgang. The vicar of Derlyngton held a plot of ground, worth 12d. per annum. The janitor dwelt in a house within the inclosure of the manor, worth 3s. 4d. per annum. Ralph of Eseby and thirteen other bond-tenants held twenty-two messuages and thirty-two oxgangs, paying for each oxgang 5s. (the services as those of the tenants in villenage under Boldon Book). The tenants jointly held the common forge, at 4d. rent. The tenants in villenage paid 12d. for toll of ale, and the burgesses of Derlyngton 2s. William de Hoton and John de Tesedale held the whole fishery by metes and bounds in the field, and paid 2s. They also paid 53s. 4d. for the office of punder, to which appertained nine acres of land and meadow.

The same tenants rendered 35 hens at Christmas, and for wodsilver at the same festival 2s. Twenty-seven tenants held divers messuages, tenements, and cottages, with certain acres of land, under the name of Exchequer-lands. All of them rendered the services due from four cottages, viz. making hay-ricks, carrying fruit, and work ing at the mill, until it could be known which individual cottages should be charged with those services. The following is evidently an addition to the original Survey : \u2014 \" Ingelram, Gentill, and his partners, hold the Borough of Derlyngton, with the profits of the mills,* the dye-house, and Other profits pertaining to the Borough, under fourscore and fourteen pounds, 6s. rent.\" * The following minutes relative to the customs and regulations concerning Darlington and Blackwell mills occur at later dates : \u2014 \"Darlington and Blackwell mills, manor of Bondgate. \u2014 The verdict of the jury impannelled and sworn at the court held of the manor of Darlington, the 6th day of August, 1647, before us, John Coulson, Esq., steward, and Christopher Mickleton, Gent. \u2014 Mem.

I told him it was ill suffered of them that were the heddes of the towne to let them make such unlawfull assemblies together in the strete, and that it was a very ill example, and hard to judge what inconveniencys might followe, or what attemptats they wold enterprise when such a number of light felowes were assembled.

The first election took place in December, 1832; and, on the day of chairing (tbe 24th), the town presented a scene of unusual gaiety and animation. The novelty of tbe occasion attracted great numbers of persons from the surrounding district ; and the numerous individuals and parties in the streets mostly wore the favours of one or other of the candidates. The carriages and chairs provided for the members (John Bowes, Esq., of Streatlam Castle, and Joseph Pease, Esq., of Darlington, one of the Society of Friends) were profusely decorated with ribbons and evergreens; while several bands of music, with flags, from the different polling places, attended on the occasion. The freeholds in Darlington have been minutely subdivided from the time of the earliest records. In Bishop Bury's time, Thomas, son of Jolanus de Morton, held two burgages by three suits of court at the Toll-booth, and eight pounds of wax to Darlington church. In the beginning of Bishop Hatfield's time, Richard cle Denton, John Bruys, Maude widow of John Underwode, Hugh tie Newton, Peter son of Peter Clerkson, and several others, held messuages and lands.

A square pile of buildings, called Bakehouse Hill (probably from its having been the scite of the town bakehouse), stands on the east or lower side of the square, to the north of which is the street leading to the Skerne bridge, and to the south the entrance to the church and the Lead Yard. Northgate branches off to the north of the square, Bondgate to the west, and Blackwellgate towards the south-west. Skinnergate runs parallel with thc High Row, and Hun gate with the South Row, with which it is connected by the Bull Weind, so called from a rude sculpture of a bull on the corner bouse, supposed to have been the scite of the Nevilles' property. Prebend Row and Tubwell-gate (so called from an old tub-well) are on the north side of the mar- ket-place. Priestgate is a street leading to the east from Prebend Row. Union Street branches west from Northgate. King Street, Queen Street, Regent Street, and Albion Place, are of recent erection on the north side of the town. Paradise Row is on the south-west, forming a continua tion to Blackwellgate. On the east side of the Skerne, several new streets and rows have been erected on the ground anciently occupied by the bishop's park. Clay Row is immediately oppo site the end of the bridge ; and Freeman's Place, Park Street, Chapel Street, and Bridge Street, form avenues in different directions. An act was obtained for paving, lighting, watching, and cleansing the town of Darlington, March 24, 1823, under the powers of which it has been considerably improved. In 1830, a com pany was formed for lighting the town with gas. In 1830-1, the amount of rate collected by the commissioners under the Darlington Improvement Act, at Is. per pound, on \u00a3\"J4:29, was i?371, 9s.

The college consisted of a vicar and four prebendaries; Darlington, Black- well, Newton, and Cockerton. Under the Lincoln taxation, 1292, the whole revenues are stated at \u00a3^3, 6s. 8d. An inquisition made by Bishop Neville states that \" the prebendary of the pre- bend of Derlyngton has annexed to his prebend ten tenements within thc vill of Derlyngton, then on lease as affirmed for 117s. ; he has also two oxgangs of arable land, with the meadows pertain- ing to them, worth 26s. 8d. per annum, and these are certain and settled, and form the carpus prebend\u00e6. He receives also of uncertain matters, the tithes of hay and grain of Derlyngton, which he shall hold of three successive years, if he shall so long live ; and during each of those three years, he shall pay to the prebend of Cokerton 40s., to the prebend of Newton 40s., and to the prebend of Blackwell \u00a3i ; and when the same three years are elapsed, the prebendary of Derlyngton is to trans- fer and betake himself, as to the perception of tithes, to the prebend of Blackwell, and to receive the tithes of hay and corn of Blackwell for three successive years ; and for the next three of Newton ; and for tbe next three of Cockerton ; till, having completed his cycle, he returns to Darlington.\" The other prebendaries succeeded each other in order, and each enjoyed the tithes of Darlington three years in twelve. The prebendary of Cockerton had two granaries leased for 26s. 8d., and two ox gangs of arable land, 26s. 8d. per annum. The prebendary of Newton had one granary and three tenements leased for 30s. 6d., and two oxgangs 26s. 8d. The prebendary of Blackwell had one granary, two tenements, and a parcel of waste, sometime leased for 24s., ami two oxgangs 26s. 8d. The prebend of Darlington, with all its appurtenances, was worth \u00a318 per annum ; the prebend of Cockerton \u00a316; the prebend of Newton, __?12; and the prebend of Blackwell, \u00a3\"20. The said four prebendaries were only charged with the repairs of the chancel, and with the Royal Tenth when it should happen, viz. 18s. each. This inquest was undertaken on the petition of Master Richard Wytton, vicar, stating that none of the above amply endowed prebendaries either resided or provided a deputy ; ancl that be, the said vicar, was no longer able to support the burthen of the whole parochial cure, his revenues being minished and brought low, as well by the pestilence, which was rife amongst the people, as by other misfortunes and accidents; and, moreover, on account of his exile revenues, the name of vicar was little honoured amongst the people. Bishop Neville, in consequence, ordained (Novem ber 8, 1439), with the consent of the prior and convent of Durham, that the name of Vicar should cease, and be changed to that of Dean ; for the support of which dignity an additional prebend was erected, to be held conjointly with the deanery, and to consist of the oblations, mortuaries, altarage, and offerings, which the vicar then held, together with his ancient manse; and, on the death or removal of the prebendary of Darlington, all his tithes of grain and hay were to be inte grally attached to the deanery, and his successor was to hold but his two oxgangs of land and his pension of 40s. After three years, the dean was to receive the tithes of each of the three other prebends in succession for an equal length of time, and so return to that of Darlington. Another ordinance follows, May 21, 1443, that every prebendary shall provide one officiating clerk, or in default pay five marks to the dean. On the petition of Roland Hardgyll, dean, in 1451, the same prelate issued another ordinance, that when the dean came next in course to the prebend of Dar lington, he and his successors should perpetually keep it, leaving the other three prebendaries to their usual course of rotation.

The collegiate church was dissolved in 1550, reserving only a small monied stipend (\u00a3322, 6s. 8d. per annum) for an officiating minister.* The grant for life to Queen Henrietta Maria includes the sums stated above for the deanery, and the prebends of Cockerton, Blackwell, and Prebend Row. The greater part of the lands and tithes belonging to the deanery are now- vested in the Duke of Cleveland, subject to the above crown rents ; and those belonging to the other prebends are dispersed in va rious bands. There were four chantries in this church; but by whom or when founded is unknown. 1. The chantry of St. James, wdiose annual revenues were valued at \u00a36 at the dissolution. William Wighteman was the incumbent in 1501 ; Ralph Swalwell, 1523, with a salary of 60s. paid by the bishop. 2. All Saints' chantry ; the yearly revenue at the dissolution, .\u00a34, 19s. 3. Marshall's Chantry (see Grammar School, Charities). 4. St. Mary's chantry. John Coman occurs chaplain in 1344; Ralph Byrd in 1424. Besides these, there was the free chapel or chantry of Badelfielde, or Battlefield, situate within the manor ancl parish of Darlington, and in the patronage of the bishop, who paid an annual salary to the chaplain out of the exchequer. Its origin is unknown ; and the name of Battlefield is probably a corruption of tbe Bathela mentioned in Boldon Book, and Bathley in Hatfield's Survey. Robert Bushell, the last incumbent, in 1553 received a pension. of \u00a32, 6s. 8d. It has already been stated that Darlington church was erected by Bishop Pudsey ; and its cost must have been great, for the stone is supposed to bave been brought from the quarries of Cock field Fell, 12 miles distant. It stands near the Skerne, and is a stately elegant pile, in the form of a cross, from the centre of which rises a square tower, surmounted by a lofty and beautiful octa gonal spire. On Tuesday, July 17, 17-50, this spire was struck with lightning, and was so shat tered as to render it necessary to take the higher part down. In rebuilding it, the rolls at the angles were omitted, and it is now six feet lower than before the accident. With the exception of the windows in the north and south aisles, the whole of the body of the church and the tower are ornamented with regular series of blank and open windows, ofthe earliest date of pointed architec ture, with connecting belts and deep drip-stones. The principal entrance is from the west, under a pointed arch, with several deep mouldings, and a canopied niche above. The nave has reoular aisles, each formed by four pillars supporting pointed arches. The first pillar of the north aisle is clustered, the second and fourth cylindrical, and the third octagonal. On the south, the first pil lar is clustered, the second and fourth octagonal, and the third cylindrical ; and one of tbe arches is deeply fluted. The central tower is supported by four arches, deeply fluted and ornamented with the nail-head ornament, rising from light fluted columns with richly banded capitals. The * Pensions paid in 1553: \u2014 To Robert Bushell, prebend of Cockerton, \u00a31, 10s.; to Simon Binkes, pre bend of Prestgate, \u00a31, 13s. 4d. ; to John Hewis, prebend of Blackwell, \u00a31, 13s. 4d. ; to Robert Warde, William Thompson, and Marmaduke Fayrebarne, \u00a33 each, \u00a39; to Anthony Wilde, \u00a32; to Thomas Rich\u00bb ardson, minister, \u00a34; total, \u00a319, 16s. 8d."], [147, "DARLINGTON. 131 two capitals towards the chancel are adorned with rich foliage. The ends of the transept are of equal dimensions; and that to the south is more richly decorated than any other part of the church. All the ranges of windows in the transepts are connected by blank lights under pointed arches, with pilasters of uncommon elegance ; and there are circular ornaments of great beauty introduced between the spandrils of the middle window to the south. A lofty arch, with a lower one beneath for the rood-loft,* separates the nave and chancel. About the year 1822, an organ was erected here by subscription. On the north of the altar is a recess under an obtusely pointed arch, sur- mounted by an embattled canopy, with foliage in the spandrils. The arms of Cardinal Langley are on the stalls in the chancel ; and against the south wall are inscriptions, enumerating the cha- ritable endowments of the parish. The east end of tbe chancel is modern. The church has been frequently repaired, and is kept in good order; but the appearance of the interior is much injured by tbe irregularity of the pews and galleries. There are six musical bells in the tower, on which, at every fourth hour, the clock chimes a tune. Four of the bells were cast anew in 173-, and cost \u00a3188, 9s. 7-kl. The weight of the six is 58 cwt. 1 qr.

Catholic Chapel. \u2014 Until a few years ago, there was no resident Catholic clergyman in Darling ton, the duty being performed once a month by the priest stationed at Stockton ; an arrangement which would probably have been continued, had not the sale of the Cliffe property broken up the ancient mission there. -f- On that event, the Rev. W. Hogarth was removed to Darlington ; and, by his exertions and personal sacrifices, assisted by tbe donations of several individuals, the old chapel (which was totally unfit for the increasing congregation) was pulled down, the present beautiful edifice was erected, and the congregations of Cliffe (seven miles distant) and Darlington were united. The plan of the chapel was from the designs of I. Bonomi, Esq. It is situated in Paradise Lane, and is built of freestone, and covered with Westmoreland slates, combining strength with elegance. The interior presents a grand and solemn appearance, highly increased by the pannelled oak ceiling. Over the entrance are the arms of the Withams of Cliffe. It was opened May 29, 1827- The number of communicants average upwards of 200; and there is a wide extent of country attached to the station.j lence of a few charitable individuals, the profits arising from bis poultry, &c, yet he was enabled to realise \u00a3200. \u2014 Sy fees' s Local Records. * The following are given by Hutchinson as the customary tithes of this parish: \u2014 \"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 calves are reckoned as half a calf, and pays lOd\u2014 7. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20, a whole calf, and pays ls. 8d. \u2014 10 sheep, a whole fleece, 2s. \u2014 14 do., no more. \u2014 24 reckoned 2 fleeces, 4s \u2014 5 lambs is half a lamb, and pays 2s. \u2014 10 do. is one lamb, 4s. \u2014 14 do. is no more. \u2014 16 is 2 lambs, and 24 is only reckoned for 2 lambs. \u2014 Each milch-cow pays three halfpence for renewal.\" + The chapel at Cliffe is the only place of worship which, at the Reformation, did not pass from its Ca tholic possessors ; and it remained in their hands, through all the storms of succeeding revolutions, till un toward circumstances alienated it from its late owners, the Witkams.

Independent Chapel. \u2014 Nonconformity commenced at an early period in Darlington. After the ejectment of the Rev. John Rogers, in 1662, from Cogland in Cumberland, he continued to exer cise his ministry in his own house at Startford near Barnard Castle, and at various places in the county of Durham ; and in 1672, during tbe indulgence granted by Charles II. , he licensed places of worship both at Darlington and Stockton ; and bodies of Dissenters bave continued to hold their meetings here. In 1312, an individual presented the Independent congregation with a piece of ground in Union Street, on which he also erected the exterior walls of a chapel. This building was completed by the congregation, who, in 1825, caused it to be considerably- enlarged. It was, however, found necessary to purchase a piece of ground on the west, to prevent the possibility of the windows on that side being* built against ; from which unforeseen circumstance, there is a con siderable debt upon the chapel. It is a neat and commodious edifice, and will accommodate be tween 500 and 600 hearers. The Rev. Richard Gibbs, who succeeded the Rev. Charles Gollop, is the present minister. The Friends' Meeting-house. \u2014 The Society of Friends have long formed a numerous and influ ential body in the town and neighbourhood of Darlington. Their meetinghouse, a plain, conve nient structure, is situated in Skinnergate. The Baptist Chapel is situated in Albion Row. At present, there is no stationed minister here; but the duty is performed by stir. Lightfoot. Wesleyan Methodist Chapels. \u2014 The first Methodist chapel erected in Darlington was in Clay Row, on the scite now occupied by the premises of Messrs. George Middleton and Sons. This sect afterwards removed to a chapel in Northgate, and subsequently to premises in Bondgate, now in the occupation of stir. John Davison. In 1812, the present chapel was erected. It is a spacious and elegant structure, situated in Bondgate, with dwelling-houses attached for the preachers. The interior is tastefully and conveniently arranged, having a laige gallery extending around it. There is sitting-room for about 1400 people; but many more have occasionally been assembled bere. Another chapel was erected in 1831, on the east side of the Skerne. It is a small, neat building, lighted with gas, and will contain about 300 hearers. Primitive Methodist Chapel.\u2014 On October 16, 1821, the foundation-stone of a chapel for the Primitive Methodists, or Ranters, was laid in Queen Street ; and the building was opened for wor ship on March 3, 1822, when upwards of 1000 persons attended. Support of the Poor. In 1316, the amount of the poor-rates for the entire parish of Darlington was ,\u00a32950, 15s., of which sum \u00a32351, 10s. was for the township. In 1818, \u00a3'2485 was collected for tbe township, and ,\u00a33107, 9s. for the whole parish ; and in 1821, \u00a32240, 3s. was collected for the township, and \u00a3'2883, 19s. for the parish.

The bishop's ancient manor-house, after long neglect, was farmed of the bishop's housekeeper, during the last century, by the town, as a work-house for their poor. In 1806, it was purchased ofthe bishop by the township, under the Act for the Redemption of the Land-tax; and an addi- tional building, consisting of a centre and two wings, fronting to the west, was erected adjoining it on the south. On the pediment in the front is the following inscription : \u2014 \" Erected by the Town ship under the Act of 22 George III. in 1808.\" The interior of the old building retains many traces of antiquity in its low arches, thick walls, and long passages.* The whole of the apart ments, both in the old and new parts of the house, are kept remarkably clean and in good order ; as are also the beds, bedding, &c. There is a regular rotation in the meals of the week ; but no restrictions are made as to quantity. The number of inmates at present is about GO. In front of the new building is a large plot of ground, used as a garden for the house. A small farm, containing about 22 acres, has recently been taken by the township, on which many of the poor are employed in spade husbandry. They receive wages in proportion to the number of their families, besides their own dinners in the work-house on every working-day. Not withstanding the short time which has elapsed since the commencement of this experiment, it has already proved extremely useful, and is expected to lead to tbe most beneficial results. * In one ofthe apartments is preserved an ancient oaken arm-chest, ornamentally carved and pannelled, and having the marks ofa coat of arms on the lid.

Grammar School\u2014 Queen Elizabeth, by letters patent, bearing date 15th June, in the 5th year of hef reign, upon the petition of Henry Earl of Westmoreland, and James Pilkington, bishop of Durham, granted that from thenceforth there should be a grammar school in the town of Darlington, to be called \" The Free Grammar School of Queen Elizabeth,\" for the education and instruction of youth in grammar, to consist of one master and one usher ; and the four churchwardens of Darlington for the time being were constituted governors of the said free grammar school, and of the possessions, revenues, and goods thereof, and were made a body corporate with the usual powers. The appointment or removal of tbe master and usher was placed in their hands; and they and their successors, with the assent of tbe Earl of Westmoreland and bishop of Durham for the time being, were authorised from time to time to make good, fit, and salutary sta tutes and orders concerning the management of the said free school, and the rents, revenues, and goods thereof. And the said queen, being desirous to carry her intention and purpose in this behalf into effect, gave and granted to the said governors and their successors two messuages or tenements and 24 acres of ara ble land, 8 acres of meadow, and 40 acres of pasture, with their appurtenances, situate in Heighington, in the county of Durham ; two several burgages, with the appurtenances, situate in a street called the Well Row in Darlington ; and also an annual rent of 8s. 3d. issuing out of a burgage in the Head Row of Dar lington, and another annual rent of 4s. 3d. issuing out of another burgage in the Head Row of Darlington ; and also a close of land, containing by estimation two oxgangs, in the town fields and parish of Thornaby, in the county of York ; all which premises were lately parcel of the possessions of Robert Marshall's chantry, theretofore formed in the church of Darlington and then lately dissolved, and amounted to the clear yearly value of \u00a35, 4s. lOd. And for the better support of the said school, tbe said queen granted to the said go vernors and their successors licence to bave and obtain any manors, messuages, lands, tenements, rectorial tithes, or other hereditaments whatsoever within England, so as they should not exceed the clear yearly value of \u00a310. In 1748, certain statutes and regulations were for tbe first time made by tbe governors, with the assent of the bishop of Durham, the title of Earl of Westmoreland being then extinct. The principal ordinances are as follows : \u2014 \" That the upper master should be qualified to instruct youth in the elements of grammar and the Latin tongue, and should be licensed by tbe bishop ; that in the choice of an upper master, preference should be given to a graduate of either ofthe universities, and that he should not be displaced unless for good and suffi cient cause, exhibited in writing, and allowed by the governors. \u2014 That the like qualifications, licence, and rules should be required and observed with respect to the under master; and that he should teach the boys com mitted to his care in such manner as the upper master should direct. \u2014 That Latin or English prayers should be read every morning in the school. \u2014 That the boys should be taught the Catechism on every Saturday forenoon ; and that they should be publicly examined once a year, and that 20s., to be deducted out of the upper master's salary, should be then disposed of in little honorary premiums or books. That every offence against school discipline should be punished with small pecuniary fines, to be applied for the use of the school. \u2014 That all the rents and revenues of the school should be received by tbe governors, and accounts kept by them in a book to be provided for the purpose. That all leases or agreements should be signed by the go vernors, and their common seal affixed thereto; such leases to be for the best improved rents without fine \u2014That the under master should receive yearly \u00a318 for his salary, and all such voluntary gratuities as should be given him by the parents ofthe children under his care; and that the rest ofthe school rents, after pay ment of all taxes, charge of repairs, and other incidental charges, should be paid to tbe upper master.\" The property belonging to the school (as also that of all the other charities in Darlington) was surveyed by the direction of tbe churchwardens in the year 1823, and plans and maps of the whole were printed and published. The endowment of the school comprises the several premises granted by the charter, which are now occupied as follows: \u2014 1. An estate in Heighington, consisting ofa house with farm buildings and 74 a. 24 p. of land, let to a yearly tenant, at a good rent of \u00a3143 a year. The tenant is not bound to keep the premises in repair. \u2014 2. Three closes in Thornaby, in the county of York, containing 27 a. 2 r. 10 p., let to a yearly tenant at \u00a320 a year. \u2014 3. A dwelling-house with a shop fronting Tubwell Row, with several small dwelling-houses in a yard behind, and a smith's shop with a chamber above, and a yard. These premises were let on lease about 35 years ago, for a term of 99 years, at tbe yearly rent of \u00a38, 6s., to Mark Feetum, whose widow, Elizabeth Feetum, is now entitled to his interest in the premises. The greater part of the buildings standing on these premises were built by the lessee, at the expense of upwards of \u00a3700 ; the whole are now in good repair, and stated to be worth about \u00a324 a year. \u2014 4. A dwelling-house and premises demised to Christopher Watson, by lease, bearing date March 22, 1798, for the term of 99 years, from May 12, 1797, at \u00a32, 5s. a year. This lease is now vested in Elizabeth Haw, widow of Thomas Haw, who purchased Chris-"], [155, "DARLINGTON. 139 topher Watson's interest therein \u2014 5.

Several messuages in Tubwell Row, demised to Robert Wilson and Christopher Watson, by lease bearing date September 15, 1828, for 31 years, at the yearly rent of \u00a315, 10s. \u2014 7- Certain premises, viz. all that piece or parcel of ground then used as a garden, in a street called Priestgate, demised to William Fee- tum, by indenture bearing date March 31, 1801, for the term of 99 years from the 12th May then next, ct tbe yearly rent of \u00a31 : the lessee covenanted to repair and keep in repair the demised premises, and any buildings thereafter to be erected by him, his executors, &c, casualties by fire or storm excepted. There are now several small houses on the premises.

Two cottages fronting Skinnergate, with a yard, wash-house, and garden behind, in occupation of Isabella Thompson, as yearly tenant, at a fair rent of \u00a310. \u2014 9. The two annual rents granted by tbe charter are paid in respect of two houses in the Head Row in Darlington ; the one paying 8s. 3d., and \"the other 4s. 3d. The income of the school, including the rent of \u00a31 reserved on the premises let to William Feetum (No. 7), and a rent of 15s. formerly paid for a room occupied by Dr. Peacock adjoining No. 8, amounts to \u00a3247, 8s. 6d. The principal part of the rents are paid to the governors, but tbe collection of some of them has been improperly left to the master himself. Tbe school formerly stood at the east end of the church; but, in 1813, it was pulled down and the scite added to the church-yard, in pursuance of an agreement entered into with the parishioners ; and another school of the same dimensions was, at the expense of the parish, built about 80 yards southward of the old scite, upon a plot of ground which had been purchased by the parish for enlarging the church-yard. The Rev. William Clementson was appointed upper master iii 1806, and li- censed by the bishop, having held the office of usher from the year 1795. The salary of the usher has been increased to \u00a370, and the upper master receives the clear residue, which, for the three years previous to the visit of the Commissioners for inquiring concerning Charities, averaged between \u00a3120 and \u00a3130 a year; but as the rents have been lately improved, bis income will now be increased. The school is considered as free for classical instruction to tbe whole parish ; and any boy belonging thereto, provided he can read tolerably, is admitted on application to the master. The charge of entrance-money is discontinued. All the scholars who learn reading, writing, or arithmetic, pay 7s- 6d. ; and for learning mathematics, and geography and the use of the globes, they pay from 12s. 6d. to 15s. a quarter. Boys not belonging to the parish pay for classi- cal instruction one guinea a quarter. There are now about 60 scholars, part of whom are learning the classics under the upper master. The usher has some scholars under him, learning the rudiments of the Latin grammar, but is principally employed in teaching the English grammar, writing, and accounts. In addition to his salary, be receives from the upper master 2s. 6d. per quarter for each boy instructed in mathematics, geography, and the use of the globes. Small presents are distributed to the boys annually by the upper master, to a greater amount than the sum of \u00a31 required by the statutes. \"It would perhaps be unjust to the present master,\" say the Commissioners, \"to impose upon him any new regulations with respect to the charges last mentioned; but as there are now no children who receive a gratuitous instruction at the school, notwithstanding the ample income thereof, it appears to us desirable that the governors should, with the advice of the principal inhabitants, draw up such new regulations as they may think best qualified to extend tbe benefit of the endowment, to be adopted on the election of any future master, and to submit the same to the bishop of Durham, with whose approbation they may be established as part of the statutes. We also conceive that the governors ought immediately to take upon themselves the collection of tbe rents, to keep a book of accounts and of the minutes of their proceedings, and to meet at regular periods for the purpose of settling the accounts and transacting any other business which tbe affairs of the school may require ; and immediate steps ought to be taken for viewing the farm at Thornaby, and re-letting it at a fair rent.\" Blue Coat Charily School. \u2014 By indenture, April 19, 1713, Dame Mary Calverly assigned to trustees a sum of \u00a31000 due to her on bond from Edward Pollen, to lay out the principal, or so much thereof as should come to their hands, in the purchase of lands or tenements, and pay the rents thereof and the interest ofthe money in the mean time till such purchase should be made, for and towards the support and maintenance of a charity school intended to be established at Darlington, for instructing poor children there in the principles of the Christian religion according to the Church of England, and for clothing them, and teaching them to read, write, and cast accounts, and buying them books and putting them out apprentices to trades, and for the maintenance of a schoolmaster, under such regulations as the trustees should think proper. In 1722, the sum of \u00a3650 was received as the produce of Pollen's bond, wdiich sum, together with contributions and sav- ings, amounting in all to \u00a31280, was placed in the hands of George Allan. A suit was subsequently insti tuted in the Court of Chancery, to recover this sum from his representatives; and in 1800 a decree was vol. h.\u2014 33. 2 O"], [156, "140 DARLINGTON WARD\u2014 S. E.

The stock now stands in the names of Jonathan Backhouse, jun., Samuel Forster, jun., and Thomas Buttery. This charity is known by the name of the Blue Coat School, although there never was any school-room belonging to it. Since the establishment of a parochial school conducted on the Na tional system, 20 children of the parish of Darlington, named by tbe trustees, and called the Blue Coat Boys, have been taught by tbe master of that school; and the dividends arising from the stock, \u00a341, 15s. 4d., are disposed of for their benefit in the following manner: \u2014 The schoolmaster receives annually \u00a318 for teaching these boys, besides bis salary from the subscribers ; and he is also allowed his bill for books, paper, and school requisites, which generally amounts to 40s. or 60s. ; and 15s. is paid yearly for firing. The children receive an entire suit of clothing once in two years, the annual average cost of which is about \u00a320. Robert Noble, by will, May 20, 1/19, gave to the use of the Blue Coat Charity School in Darlington the yearly sum of 40s.' This has never been paid, probably because the master teaching the boys was not li censed by the bishop, agreeably to the terms of the will. Forslcr's Alms-houses. \u2014 Francis Forster, by indenture, March 9, 1632, for the great and good affection he bore unto the poor and aged people of Darlington, conveyed to trustees his two lesser houses lately erected in Northgate in Darlington, with liberty to go through the other house garth for water to the river Skerne, for the use of such six only poor men or women, married or unmarried, as should be impotent, or so old and infirm as not to be able to labour for their living, born in Darlington, or resident there for three years, to be nominated by tbe heirs and assigns of the said Francis Forster, with the assent of the churchwardens of Darlington or any two of them. These premises consist of two tenements under one roof. They are occu pied by two widows placed there by the churchwardens. The two present inhabitants both receive parochial relief. There is no charity appropriated specifically to the inmates. The premises are kept in repair by the owners of the property adjoining on the south. Pease's Alms-houses. \u2014 An indenture, June 10, 1820, recites that Mary Pease contracted for the purchase of a part of a garden or orchard, in Chairgate, otherwise Glover's Weind, in Darlington, for the residue of a term of 980 years from December 1, 1694. She caused tho buildings thereon to be pulled down, and erected on the scite four alms-bouses, which she vested in trustees, who were to keep them in repair, and to insure them for \u00a3150, and to permit four poor women, being widows of the age of 60 years at least, of a good moral character and not of the Society of Quakers, to dwell in the said alms-bouses without paying any rent, ex- cept the yearly sum of 5s. a piece, to form a fund for repairing the said alms-bouses. And it was provided that whenever, after the number of trustees should have been reduced to three, a vacancy in the said alms- houses should occur, it should be lawful for the Society of Friends, at one of the monthly meetings to be held at Darlington, or within that district, to elect another such poor woman ; and it was further provided, that if any of the said alms-people should marry, or be guilty of any gross immorality or impropriety of con- duct, she should be expelled ; and that when the full sum of \u00a320 should have been raised from the rent of 5s. above mentioned, the alms-women should be permitted to inhabit the said alms-houses rent-free ; and that the said sum, when raised, should be placed out, the interest thereof to be applied in keeping the said alms- houses in repair, insuring the same, and paying any other necessary charges, and that tbe surplus, if any, should be divided amongst the poor alms-women. There are four tenements in the Post-house Weind, to which the trustees appoint four poor widows of the description above mentioned. The 5s. rents have been occasionally, but not regularly demanded. Nothing has yet been invested, and a sum exceeding what has been received has been expended on the alms-houses by two of the trustees, Edward and Joseph Pease. Bellasses' Charily. \u2014 James Bellasses, by will, October 10, 1630, bequeathed all his messuage, burgage tenements and hereditaments, with their appurtenances, which he lately bought of Ralph Wilson, with four beastgates in Bracken Moor, for the following uses, viz. That there should be several houses built of the front of the said tenement, for the erecting of which he had already made good provision of timber, brick, and stone, for the furthering of which be bequeathed \u00a320 to be bestowed on tbe same work, therein to place. workmen for the linen or woollen trade, in such manner as should be most useful for the towns of Blackwell and Darlington and the country next adjoining, for the performance of which he put in trust the burgesses and headmen of the borough of Darlington, to order and dispose thereof; and he directed that the land in How den and Blackwell bought of Robert and Francis Parkinson, in which Sir William Bellasses was nomi nated joint purchaser, should be surrendered to the burgesses and headmen of Darlington, for the settin**** forward of a trade, aud to be joined to his bouse in Darlington, and for such like uses as the house was fiven and provided for The premises first mentioned by the testator are supposed to be three tenements situate in Blackwellgate and fronting Skinnergate. These premises are known by the name of the Alms-houses, and are occupied rent-free by three poor widows of the parish of Darlington, appointed by the churchwardens. \u2014 The district called Bracken Moor, whereon four beast-gates were devised by the testator, was inclosed about 100 yeara"], [157, "DARLINGTON. 141 ago, by private agreement; and it does not appear that any allotment was set out in respect of these beast- gates. \u2014 The land in the manor of Blackwell, to which the trustees were admitted in 177L consists of four closes called tbe Poor Howdens, containing 19 a. 1 r. 23 r. Up to 1812, the rents were paid over to the churchwardens, but afterwards were received by the late George Allan, Esq., against whom proceedings in Chancery were threatened. In 1823, the churchwardens took possession ofthe premises, and for three years the lands were farmed by a committee appointed at a meeting of the inhabitants for that purpose. In March, 1826, Jonathan Backhouse, Esq., became tenant, at the yearly rent of \u00a330. The receipts of tbe churchwardens, in respect of Bellasses' charity, have been carried to one account with the rents of another charity derived from William Middleton, as hereafter mentioned. The Commissioners state that \u00a3225, 7s- 10d. is now due to these charities, independently of several defalcations. The present annual income is \u00a330 from the charity of James Bellasses, and \u00a333 from tbe charity of William Middleton. It appears to have been thought impracticable to carry the intentions of the first named donor into effect, by establishing a manufactory in tbe houses supposed to bave been left for that purpose, and those houses have consequently been appropriated to the use of three poor alms-women ; and as the charitv was intended for the benefit of persons employed in the linen and woollen trade, it has been applied in binding out children of tlie parish of Darlington apprentices, almost exclusively to weavers ; and this application has not been re- stricted to tbe income arising from Bellasses's, but has been adopted also with regard to stliddleton's charity. The children selected are generally those of paupers, and they are chiefly bound out as parish apprentices; the premium never exceeds 30s. The Commissioners object to this mode of application, as having little effect, except in relieving the parish from the maintenance of the children, without furnishing them with such in- struction in a good trade as would enable them to obtain a livelihood after tbe expiration of their apprentice- ships. They add, \" Considering the state of these charities, the amount ofthe sums due thereto from different quarters, the inefficient system of applying the funds, and the excess of income beyond what is required for such mode of application, and also the want of trustees, it appears to us that the directions of a court of equity will be necessary for establishing the charity on a proper foundation.\" Middlelon's Charily \u2014 William Middleton, in 1659, conveyed to the churchwardens and overseers of Dar lington a copyhold field called Poor Moor, containing six acres, situate in the township of Blackwell, the yearly rents of wbicb were appropriated to tbe placing out poor boys as apprentices. The premises called the Poor Moors now consist of three closes, containing* together 12 a. 3 r. 12 p., with a good barn and stable, which have recently been much improved. They are now held on lease, at the yearly rent of \u00a333. The rents are carried to tbe same account as those of the preceding charity. Buck's Charily. \u2014 George Buck, by will, July 18, 1704, gave \u00a3100 to be laid out in lands, the rents and profits thereof to be paid as follows; viz. three-fourths to the minister, churchwardens, or overseers of the parish of Darlington, and the residue thereof to the curate, churchwardens, or overseers of Sadberge, to be by them respectively distributed, three-fourths amongst the poor of the said parish of Darlington, and the other fourth part amongst the poor of the township of Sadberge, on the 11th November yearly. The pro- perty purchased is now called Buck's Close, and an acre of copyhold land adjoining thereto. They are now divided into three parcels : \u2014 One parcel, containing 1 a. 1 r. 30 p., is let to William Thompson, on lease for 21 years from March, 1824, at the yearly rent of \u00a38, the lessee covenanting to build on the land a good brick cow-house. Another parcel, containing 3 R. 4 p., including a small garden, is let to William Grey, upon an agreement for a term of 18 years from March 31, 1827, at a good rent of \u00a34. And the third parcel, containing (inclusive ofa rood of garden) 1 a. 1 K. 30 p., is let to Charles Parker, Robert Parker, and Ed- ward Parker Toulmin, bleachers, on an agreement for the same term, at a good rent of \u00a39. The rents are divided into four parts, one of which is paid to the churchwardens of Sadberge ; and the other three parts are divided amongst the different townships ofthe parish. The division, in 1827, was as follows: \u2014 f. 5*. d. Township of Sadberge 5 5 0 \u2014 Darlington 8 8 0 \u2014 Cockerton and Newton 4 0 0 \u2014 Blackwell 3 0 0 Bishop's rent, stamps, &c. ... ... 0 7 0 21 0 0 These proportions are distributed by the respective churchwardens ; that of Darlington forming part of a Christmas distribution hereafter mentioned. Pope's Charity. \u2014 John Pape, by will, June 9, 1599, gave to the poor people of Darlington four horse loads of coals, to be paid at Christmas yearly out of his burgage house in the High Row, and he also gave to th\u00a9"], [158, "DARLINGTON WARD\u2014 S. E. D. 142 poor people of Darlington 3s. 4d., to be paid out of the said house, and to be bestowed in bread, and divided amongst them yearly at Easter, by the vicar and churchwardens, desiring that the aged poor and impotent should be especially relieved. The houses in Darlington High Row, on which these payments are charged, are now the property of Mr. Jacob Brantingham, grocer. No coals have been delivered for a great many years ; but, in lieu thereof, 3s. 4d. in money is paid annually to the churchwardens, as well as the 3s. 4d. for bread. Both of these sums form part of the Christmas \"distribution hereafter mentioned. Four horse loads of coals would now cost much more than 3s. 4d. ; and it is conceived that the poor are entitled to that quantity of coal, or to the full value thereof in money. Forster s Charity. \u2014 Christopher Forster, by indenture, January 1, 1605, demised to Francis Forster a close of pasture in Bondgate in Darlington, on the north side joining upon the high road to Yarm, for 1000 years, at the yearly rent of ld. payable to the said Christopher, and 8d. to the chief lord of the fee; and the said Francis Forster and Richard his son, by indenture, November 20, 1641, in consideration that the profits of the said close should during the said term go to the use and behoof of the poor of the town and borough of Darlington and Bondgate in Darlington, granted to the churchwardens of Darlington the said lease and all tlieir interest therein for the remainder of the said term. This close is now called Carlton Close, and con tains 2 a. 2 r. 8 p. : it is let by the churchwardens and overseers of Darlington, at the yearly rent of \u00a311. This rent also forms part of tbe Christmas distribution, as hereafter mentioned. Barker's Charity. \u2014 Thomas Barker, by will, May 22, 1686, gave to Bishopton parish, Long-Newton pa rish, Haughton parish, and Darlington parish, 20s. each yearly, to be paid out of his lands at East Newbiggin. He also gave to Sadberge town and Croft parish (in Yorkshire) either of them, 10s. in the year, to be paid out of his lands in East Newbiggin, upon Candlemas day. This yearly sum of 20s. is paid by the tenant of lands in East Newbiggin under the Marquis of Londonderry, and forms part of the Christmas distribution. Prescot's Charily. \u2014 Arthur Prescot, by will, February 2,\" 1705, gave \u00a340, to the intent that the same should be placed out at interest, one moiety whereof to be yearly distributed amongst the poor widows of Darlington, and the other half among the poor of the township of Blackwell. The sum of \u00a320 was laid out in February, 1828, in the purchase of \u00a319, 13s. ld. stock new four per cents, and forms part ofa sum now standing in tbe names of Robert. Botcherby and George Horner, the residue having been derived from Carr's charity, hereafter mentioned. The dividends are added to the Christmas distribution. The other sum of \u00a320, together with \u00a340 left by the will of John Corns orth in 1675, is supposed to have been laid out in the purchase of a close at Blackwell, called the Poor's Close, containing about two acres. This land is let to a yearly tenant, at a good rent of \u00a310. The rent is received half-yearly at May-day and Martinmas by tbe churchwarden, and distributed, as soon as received, in sums varying from 2s. to 3s. 6d., amongst poor persons residing in tbe township of Blackwell, whether they belong to it or not. Noble's Charily. \u2014 Robert Noble, by will, May 20, 1719, charged his freehold messuages and tenements standing in tbe High Row, with the payment of 20s. yearly to the churchwardens, to be by them distributed on the 29th September to such poor as were not charged to or received relief from the rate. The premises now belong to Mr. Forster, who pays the sum of 20s. every December. This also forms part of tbe Christ- mas distribution. Walker's Charily. \u2014 Elizabeth Walker, by will, April 11, 1791, gave to the minister and churchwardens of Darlington \u00a350, to be laid out on government securities, and the interest divided on Christmas day, yearly, amongst 12 poor widows of the town of Darlington, in such proportions as the said minister and churchwar dens should think fit. This money was laid out in the purchase of \u00a358, 3s. five per cent. Loyalty annuities, now standing in the names of James Topham, Stephen Buttery, and Shaftoe Carr, and producing dividends to the amount of \u00a32, 18s. 2d. per annum. This sum also forms part of the general distribution at Christmas. Carr's Charity. \u2014 Shaftoe Carr, by will, January 1, 1809, gave to the churchwardens of the township of Darlington \u00a350, upon trust, to place tbe same out at interest, and to distribute the same on St. Thomas's day, yearly, amongst such poor people belonging to the said township as they should think fit. With this money, \u00a350 stock was purchased in the five per cents in 1819, in the names of Robert Botcherby and George Horner. By the reduction of tbe five per cents, tbe stock is now \u00a352, 10s. new four per cents, producing annual dividends to tbe amount of \u00a32, 2s. This also forms part of the Christmas distribution. Christmas Distribution.\u2014 The income derived from the several charities above mentioned, of which no specific application has been stated, is distributed at Christmas annually, the amount being about \u00a330; to which is usually added a portion of the sacrament money. The curate, attended by the churchwardens, \"oes round the whole ofthe town of Darlington a few days before Christmas, and such a sum of money is given to each poor person as the funds will allow. The sum seldom exceeds 3s. 6d. to any one family, and the same sum or 4s. is given to some of tbe widows, their proportion being increased in respect of Elizabeth Walker's charity. The poor of the other townships of tbe parish, and occasionally persons of other parishes (if deserving) being resident in Darlington, receive a portion of the money thus distributed."], [159, "DARLINGTON. 143 Lamb's Charily. \u2014 Matthe.w Lamb, by deed, May 1, 1714, gave to George Allan of Darlington, and the churchwardens, and their successors, heirs, and assigns, an annuity of 12s., charged upon certain houses in Blackwell Street, to be paid yearly on Good Friday, and to be distributed to 12 poor and needful widows, ls. each. The premises charged with this payment now belong to Messrs. Trenham and Lowson, brewers, by whom the rent-charge is regularly paid ; and the amount is given away by the churchwardens at Christ inas, to 12 poor widows of Darlington, ls to each. Catherick's Charily. \u2014 Catherine Catherick, by will, May 20, 1720, charged her two copyhold bouses and orchard in Bondgate with the yearly payment of \u00a32, 12s. to tbe minister and churchwardens and their suc cessors, on the 1st May and 1st November, in trust, to lay out the same in 12 pennyworth of bread every Sunday, to be distributed amongst such poor people of the town as they should think fit. The two houses above mentioned have been lately rebuilt, and form one large dwelling-house, now the property of Francis Kipling. The rent-charge is paid annually in December, and bread to the amount of 4s. 4d. is given away on the last Sunday in every month, in penny and twopenny loaves, to poor persons attending divine service, according to a list, tbe vacancies in which are filled up, as they occur by death or otherwise, by the minister and churchwardens. Lady Calverly's Charity. \u2014 Dame Mary Calverly, by will, May 10, 1715, bequeathed several legacies, to tbe amount of \u00a3905 or thereabouts, to be paid out ofa mortgate of \u00a31500 upon Ipslev estate in Warwick shire, and the interest or profits of the residue were to be distributed amongst tbe poor people of tbe parishes between Northallerton and Darlington. In respect of this charity, \u00a330 a year was formerly paid, \u00a310 of which was received by the churchwardens of Darlington, who distributed the same to poor persons of that place. Since 1821, the whole payment has been discontinued by Beilby Thompson, Esq., owner ofthe pro perty supposed to be charged with it ; and the Commissioners recommend the interference of a court of equity. Phillips' s Charily. \u2014 Gideon Gravett Phillips, of Darlington, died in the year 1800 ; and on a slip of paper attached to his will, which was dated in tbe same year, was written in his own hand-writing, \" Town \u00a3100.\" This legacy was paid to tbe guardians of the poor, and, by order of a vestry meeting in 1804, laid out in building the poor-house. Benevolent , Literary, and Religious Institutions, SfC. The Dispensary, for the relief of the sick poor, occupies a part of the Town House, where it was established October 25, 1809, in commemoration of the 50th year of the reign of King George III.; since which period, medical and surgical aid have been administered to several thousand pa tients. This useful charity is supported by annual subscriptions and donations; a benefaction of five guineas and upwards constituting the donor a Governor for life. The following is a list of the present governors: \u2014 The Right Rev. the Bishop of Durham; the Duchess of Cleveland; John Allan, Esq.; Jonathan Backhouse, Esq ; Samuel Barret, Esq.; G. L. Hollingsworth, Esq.; stir. Richard Hodgshon ; Mr. John Ianson ; Lord Durham ; Lord W. Powlett ; Edward Pease, Esq. ; Joseph Pease, Esq. ; and William Russell, Esq.

The Wesleyan Benevolent Society, for visiting and relieving the distressed and sick poor in Darlington, is chiefly suppoited, as its name implies, by members of the Methodist connexion. Its designs are, \" to search out real objects of charity, to alleviate their distresses as far as its funds will allow, and to administer religious instruction and consolation to the sick and tbe dying.\" The visits take place weekly, and one shilling is advanced at each visit, except in cases of peculiar dis tress, when the donation is increased. During the year ending May 31, 1830, 956 visits were paid to 76 persons; in the following year, 804 visits to 70 persons; and in 1831-2, 107 persons were visited at 1105 different times. The society is supported by monthly and annual subscrip tions, and by a yearly collection made in the chapel. The National School was established in 1812; but it was not till 1824 that the present building in the Lead Yard was erected, and a considerable addition has since been made to it. About 250 boys attend, from each of whom Mr. Storey, the master, receives Id. per week, besides a stated salary of \u00a3'50 per annum from the funds of the school (See also Blue Coat Charity School, page 139-40.) The schoolroom for the girls is in an upper story ; and there are, on an average, about 200 educated here. The whole of the children are assembled in the school on Sunday afternoons, and addressed by the officiating curate. The Lancasterian School, in Skinnergate, was built in 1819, and is supported by voluntary subscriptions (principally from Dissenters) and the weekly pence of the scholars. The average number of boys attending is from 140 to 150, who are taught reading, writing, arithmetic, English grammar, and the principles of general knowledge, particularly as connected with religious sub jects, by Mr. Shotton, the master, under whose superintendence this establishment is increasing in usefulness. The Female School of Industry is held in the upper apartments of the Lancasterian school. It is supported by the Wesleyan Methodist Sabbath and Week-day School Society, and manao*ed by a committee of twelve females and two secretaries, who provide the institution with work, fix its prices, and fill up vacancies in the school, which is open for the reception of 100 female children of tbe poor, of all denominations, at six years old and upwards. They are instructed in readino*, writing, cyphering, sewing, knitting, marking, &c, and pay ld. per week each. The mistress re ceives a salary of twenty guineas yearly, together with a moiety of the children's weekly pence. Sunday Schools. \u2014 The Wesleyan Methodist Sabbath and Week-day School Society has been established 25 years, and is governed by a president, a treasurer, a committee, and four secreta ries, who, with assistants, impart religious instruction to the children in separate classes. The society is supported by voluntary subscription ; and its receipts and disbursements, includino- the proceeds and expenses of the School of Industry, generally average upwards of ,\u00a3100 per annum.

There is an infant-school in Bondgate ; and about eight other day-schools are kept by masters and mistresses in various parts of the town. A Subscription Library and News-room, supported by about 100 members, is held in the Town's Hall. Another news-room is held in a house on Bakehouse Hill. Libraries are attached to most of the Dissenting chapels of the town, besides one belonging to the Sabbath School Society. The Church Missionary Society for Darlington and its vicinity was instituted in 1822, and is now under the management of the Rev. J. Marrincr, President ; the Rev. P. Barlow, Treasurer ; Mr. Robert Wilson, Secretary ; and a Committee of twelve. It is supported by annual subscrip tions, donations, contributions, collections at annual meetings, &c.

Like all the other Wesleyan Missionary Auxiliaries, this one acts on its own plan, and under a committee of its own, while its efforts are subservient to the wishes of thc parent institution. Numerous branch societies have been formed in the adjacent villages; and these, in conjunction with the Darlington Society, have annually remitted a considerable sum (averaging above \u00a3200) to the treasurer in London. The society has been formed upwards of 10 years ; and the uniform increase of its yearly collections, and the persevering zeal and unanimity which prevail among the members, give promise of conti nued prosperity. The annual meeting is held in May or June, in the Wesleyan chapel. The Auxiliary Bible Society for Darlington and its vicinity was established in 1812, to co-ope rate with the British and Foreign Bible Society in London, to which it remits annually about \u00a3'280. 12,994 copies of the scriptures have now been issued by it. The Duke of Cleveland is president. An Auxiliary Anti-Slavery Society has been established some years in Darlington. The Darlington Temperance Society was instituted in 1831 ; and the first anniversary was held in the Wesleyan chapel, October 4, 1832.

Since its publication, however, they have increased to about 6'70.* Public Buildings. Thc Bridge over the Skerne consists of three arches of stone, and communicates with tbe great roads to Stockton and Yarm. Hutchinson says that it had formerly nine arches : so far back as Li land's time, however, it had but three. It was widened and repaired in 1832; but the foot paths at the sides are still inconveniently narrow. A cast iron bridge of one arch is now constructing, to be thrown across the Skerne at a short distance further down that river than tbe old bridge, thereby facilitating tbe communication of the main body of the town with the new streets to the east. The Town's House. \u2014 The old Toll-booth was taken down in 1807; and on April 13, 1808, the first stone of the present building was laid by George Allan, Esq., of Blackwell Grange, George Lewis Rollings worth, Esq., and Richard Hodgson, Esq., of Darlington, amidst great rejoicings. It is situated near the high side of the market-place, and is an elegant structure of stone, with a terrace and balustrade on the top, surmounted by a handsome cupola. The lower story is occu pied by the Dispensary, and by various warehouses. The upper story contains a spacious room, lighted by six large windows, and which is used f >r public meetings, and the transaction of the town's business. Petty sessions are held here on alternate market-days, when two or more of the * A Savings Bank was established in Darlington in May, 1817; and a great number of persons availed themselves of this method of investment. Owing, however, to some real or alleged defalcations, a \" panic\" commenced amongst the depositors, and the establishment is now broken up. From May 10, 1817, to Fe bruary 5, 1833, the receipts were \u00a394,501, 18s. 4d., and the repayments \u00a393,925, 2s. 9d., leaving a balance in hand of \u00a3576, 15s. 7d-, which is expected to be paid in a few weeks. From the unwillingness which has been manifested by several to receive back their deposits, it is probable that the institution will be revived in a short time. A Mechanics' Institution, for Darlington and its vicinity, was established in 1825, and at one time con sisted of above 150 honorary and ordinary members, who possessed a very valuable library. This establish ment, however, is now extinct."], [163, "DARLINGTON. 147 following magistrates attend for the administration of justice: \u2014 Captain Cumby, of Heighington ; the Rev. W. S.

The Market-cross, a plain pillar of stone, elevated on four steps, stands on the north side of the Town's House. It was built by Lady Brown, the heiress of the Barnes family, in whom the office of bailiff had long been vested. An intention existed, some time ago, to erect a new and more lofty cross in the centre of the square, on the spot now occupied by a large gas-light pillar; but this design is, for the present, abandoned. The Shambles, erected in 1815, are situated to the south of the Town's House. They are en- closed by a neat basement wall and corner pillars of stone, with an iron railing, and covered in at the top. They are well supplied with butcher's meat. Markets, Fairs, Manufactures, Trade, SsC. A weekly market is held here on Mondays, at which there is a plentiful supply of the produce of the rich agricultural district which surrounds the town. On alternate Mondays there is a large show of cattle, and at the proper season a show of sheep and wool, the most abundant in the north of England. Hutchinson gives the following statement of the average price of long wool at Dar- lington for 21 years ; the customary stone weight of wool being 18 pounds, of 16 ounces to the pound : \u2014 \"Wool, 1761, sold at 10s. 9d. a stone\u2014 1762, at 9s. 3d\u2014 1763, at 12s. 6d\u2014 1764, at 12s\u2014 1765, at 12s. 9d\u2014 1766, at 14s\u2014 1767, at 12s. 3d\u2014 1768, at 11s. 9d\u2014 1769, at 11s. 6d\u2014 1770, at 10s\u2014 1771, at 10s. 6d. \u20141772, at 12s\u2014 1773, at 11s\u2014 1774, at 12s\u2014 1775, at 12s. 6d\u2014 1776, at 12s. 9d\u2014 1777, at 13s.\u2014 1778, at 10s\u2014 1779, at 8s. 3d\u2014 1780, at 8s\u2014 1781, at 8s. 6d.\" In Messrs.

Mr. Culley says, \" When you reach that fine country on both sides the river Tees, you are then in the centre of this (the short-horned) breed of cattle ; a country that has long been eminent for good stock of all kinds.\" They are fed at four and five years old, in a gene ral way, from 80 to 90 stone weight; and some are much larger. In 1779, a fat ox, bred by Mr. Thomas Hill, of Blackwell, was killed at Darlington, and sold by a butcher there for \u00a3109, 11s. 6d.

Surtees says, \" The place, situated in a rich grazing country, famous for its large woolly sheep, and supplied in plenty with every necessary article of food, has been always well situated for manufacture, and has been, as far back as memory or tradition extends, noted for its manufacture of camblets and other woollen goods ; and still more so for its linen manufactures of measured 6 feet in stature ; was in length 9 feet 5^ inches, and over the shoulders 2 feet 10 inches broad : he was in girt before the shoulders 9 feet 7i inches, behind the shoulders 10 feet 6 inches, and over the loins 9 feet 6f inches. In 1789, an ox of stir. Milbank's, of Barningham, five years old, weighed 166 st. 4| lb. stir. Basnett, of Darlington, purchased a cow with a bull calf (tbe famous Hubbock) at her foot. At four years old, the calf was purchased from an intermediate owner by stir. Robert Colling and Mr. Waistell of Ellyhill ; and from them he was transferred to Mr. Charles Colling, who also purchased a cow and heifer of remarkably handsome form from stir. Maynard, of Ayreholm. This bull and cow are tbe undoubted stock of the present Improved Durham Short-hums. The Durham ox, bred by stir. Charles Colling at Ketton in 1796, was supposed to weigh 168 stone when exhibited as a show in 1801 by Mr. Bulmer, who purchased him for \u00a3140, and the same year sold him to John Day for \u00a3250. This enormous animal (for which \u00a32000 was refused by Day) was exhibited for nearly six years in all parts of England and Scotland. When slaugh tered, in February, 1807, he weighed 220 stone. At stir. Coding's sale in 1810, the bull Comet was sold for one thousand guineas, stir. Mason, of Chilton, obtained the pure breed of improved Durham short-horns by spirited and judicious purchases from stir. Colling's stock. The prices which have been offered and refused for some of this breed must appear enormous to th, uninitiated : For the cow Marcia (daughter to Gaudy, who was got by Favourite) Mr. Mason, in 1807, refused 700 guineas. Charles, of the same breed, was let for the highest sum which any bull ever obtained in England, viz. \u00a3450 for two seasons. Bailey's Yiew of the Agriculture of Durham contains numerous instances of the excellence of this breed. Mr. Charge of Cleasby, and stir. Culley of Denton, first introduced the Lincolnshire breed of sheep to this part about 40 or 50 years ago. The Teeswater breed of sheep is said to be the largest in the island. It is, however, a breed only calculated for warm rich pastures, where they are kept in small lots, in small inclosures, and well supported with food in severe winter seasons. The legs are longer, finer boned, and support a thicker and more firm and heavy carcase than the Lincolnshires ; the sheep are much wider on the backs and sides, and afford a finer and fatter grained mutton. The weight per quarter in two years old wedders is from 25 lb. to 35 lb., and in particular instances to 55 lb. or more. There is now scarcely a flock which has not been improved by a dash at least of the Dishley blood. Hutchinson says, \" The saddle and coach horses bred here are not excelled by those of any other part of the kingdom, and some of the most capital race-horses bave been produced in this part of the country. Tbe meadow lands are luxuriant, and excellent corn grows in this and the adjacent parishes ; no part of this island possessing a more skilful race of husbandmen than are settled hereabout.\" * The following exercise of authority relative to Darlington market is quoted by Surtees from the Rolls of Bishop Cosin : \u2014 \" Durham. \u2014 Whereas we are credibly informed, that the inhabitants of our towne and borough of Dar lington have of their owne heads, without any authority, in late levyed and erected a new markett in the said towne, for the sale of all manner of cattell in the season of the year unaccustomed, to wit, from the fort night day next before Christmas to Whitson Monday then next after, and do with much violence resist the opposers thereof by us appointed for that purpose, to the disgust of the people, and prejudice of other neigh bouring faires and marketts ; which illegal practice being by us considered of, we do hereby prohibit tbe same, and discharge them from keeping or continuing the said markett for cattle at the said time unaccus tomed; and do hereby require the sheriffe of our said county palatine, or his under sheriffe, that publique proclamation may be by them caused to be made in the open and accustomed markett-place of the said town\u00a9 of our pleasure therein. \u2014 Given at our castle of Bishop Auckland, the 2d day of Aprill, 1664.

The woollen articles manufactured when Hutchinson wrote were, tammys, moreens, barateens, &c. ; but this business was in a great measure superseded by the linen manufactures, in which a capital of nearly \u00a3150,000 was employed a few years ago. This trade has also declined, the manufacture of the heavier description of linens being chiefly transferred to Barnsley and Knaresborough ; whilst the finer diapers are principally manufactured in Dumferline and the north of Ireland. The principal employment of the labouring classes in Darlington is in the combing, and other occupations connected with the spinning-mills. The worsted produced is applicable to every common purpose, as well as for the finest imitation India shawls, Brussels and other carpets, &C.11 Messrs. Edward Backhouse and Co., and Messrs. Ed ward and Joseph Pease, have long been the principal persons engaged in the business of worsted spinning in Darlington ; and there are four or five other worsted and woollen yarn manufacturers. Messrs. Francis Kipling and Son, and stir. William Thompson, are extensive carpet manufacturers. Messrs. Ianson, Toulmin, and Ord, are owners of a mill for flax-spinning ; and they have extensive bleaching-grounds on tbe north of the town. The Messrs. Kipling and several others carry on business here as manufacturers of linen, drills, sail-cloth, &c. ; and there are two or three stuff manufacturers. There are, within a few miles of the town, thirteen water-mills on the river Skerne; and it has been estimated that upwaids of 1500 looms are employed in Darlington and the neighbourhood in the above manufactures.* Leather has for many years been a staple article of trade in Darlington, where greater quantities have perhaps been produced than in anyr other town in England of its size. Mr. George Middle ton and Sons, Clay Row, are tanners, tawers, and morocco leather and glue manufacturers. They have a steam-mill on their premises for the preparation of bark, and which is also used for grind ing flour. Mr. James Dove, tanner, Clay Row, also carries on an extensive business; and there are six curriers and leather-dressers in Darlington. The manufacture of hats is carried on here by several persons ; and there are three or four glove-makers. Two large iron-founderies have been commenced near the railway. The internal trade of thetown is considerable; and there are great numbers of well-supplied shops in all the businesses necessary to the populous agricultural and manufacturing district in which it is situated ; besides numerous mechanics, wrights, and other workmen. There are seve ral booksellers and printers in Darlington ; and eight or nine attorneys. The King's Head Inn and posting-house, Prebend Row, is a respectable establishment ; and there are about 40 other inns and public bouses ; besides several wine, spirit, and porter merchants. The bank of Messrs. Backhouse and Co. was established in Darlington in 1774. and now has branches at Durham, Sun derland, and Newcastle. There is also in this town a branch of the Stockton Commercial Bank. A joint stock bank was established here February 5, 1832; and its success has more than equalled tbe expectations of its projectors. The Darlington Commercial Insurance Company, established in 1782, for the purpose of insuring goods at sea, consists of about 140 members, and is now in a thriving condition.

D. 150 Page 47 contains an outline of the history of the Stockton and Darlington Railway. During the discussions which took place previous to the obtaining of the act of parliament for its formation, it was proposed by Christopher Tennant, Esq., of Stockton, in 1818, to form a navigable canal from Portrack to the western coal-mines, in a more northern direction, leaving out Darlington, and crossing the country by Mordon, Bradbury, Windleston, and near West Auckland, to the Gaun less at Evenwood bridge. A petition for a railway on this line was presented to parliament, Ja nuary 28, 1819 ; and tbe advantage promised was that of reaching the collieries in the shortest line. The plan, however, was opposed by the wealthy individuals interested in the commerce of Darlington, as well as by several landholders in the same district, who insisted on retaining the line by that town. The excess of the distance is extremely trifling, and the southern railway cer tainly traverses a more populous and commercial district, besides shortening the important branch to Croft Bridge. The office of the Railway Company, an ornamental building, is situated at the corner of Union Street, Northgate. There are extensive land- sale staiths near the north entrance into the town of Darlington ; and a lofty and strong arch has been thrown across the Skerne for the railway, near which a hotel has been erected. The following collieries now transmit their produce by this rail way. \u2014 On the western branch, Buttetknowle, in tbe township of Lynesack and Softley, chapelry of Hamsterley ; Cockfield; Noru-ood, in the township of Evenwood and Barony, Auckland St. Helen's; and New Etherley, West Auckland. On the north-west, or main Une, and its branches, Witton Park, Old Etherley, St Helen's, Black Boy, Shildon, Eldon, Coundon, Shildon Lodge, and Deanery. Previous to the formation of the railway, the supply of coals to Darlington, and even to Croft and some distance in Yorkshire, was at a great expense by carts from the northern collieries. Fifty years ago, even asses were employed to carry them 20 or 30 miles on their backs to various parts. Hence may be conceived the incalculable advantages wbicb have accrued to the manufactures, as well as to the comforts of the district, from this useful undertaking; independently of the impor tant benefits derived from the facilities which it affords for tbe import and export of every article of commerce. Inhabitajits. During the last century, much of the primitive rudeness which existed in Darlington- and its vici nity has been smoothed down, principally through the powerful influence of the Society of Friends, and that of other religious bodies; and few towns now possess a more orderly population. Its nu merous charitable institutions bave been noticed in the preceding pages ; but the failure of tbe Me chanic's Institution evinces either a supineness in the acquirement of scientific knowledge scarcely to have been expected in the present day, or an indifference or jealousy in the more influential classes, deterring them from the encouragement of such establishments. Darlington has no regular theatre ; and the inhabitants chiefly derive their amusements from the more rude and imperfect exhibitions occasionally produced by itinerant parties. An important change, however, appears to be takino* place in the channel of commerce in the county ; and Darlington, participating so largely as it does in the advantages of that change, will probably receive an influx of mixed character, which, whe ther it be for the better or the worse, may effect a slow and silent revolution in the manners of its inhabitants."], [167, "DARLINGTON. 151 OXENHALL, O\u00e6en-le-Field, or O.vneyjield, a constablewick belonging to the township of Darlington, from which place it is distant 3 miles south, consists of two farms. By Boldon Book, William held Oxenhall, viz. one carucate and two portions of tillage within the territory of Derlyngton. He was to have a horse-mill, and was quit of multure and of service to the bishop's mills, and paid 60s. per annum. He also performed the fourth part of a drengage service, viz. ploughed four acres, and sowed and harrowed them, the bishop finding seed ; made ready four portions of land in autumn, three of them with all the men of his manor, and all his own proper family except the housewife, and the fourth with one man from each house except his own mansion ; kept dog and horse for a quarter of a year for the chace, carried the prelate's wine with four oxen, and made vaivare. Nicholas de Oxenhale died seized of this manor in 1337, leaving Richard his son and heir. Be- fore 1378, John Lord Neville and John Fairfax, Clerk, had acquired the manor from John, son of Roger de Belgrave. Lord Neville held it under Hatfield's Survey; and it continued in his de- scendants till the attainder of Charles Earl of Westmoreland in 1570. Queen Elizabeth, in 1574, granted Oxnetfield Grange to Thomas Brickwell and Andrew Palmer, the former of whom sold it in 1602 to William Bore. Before I7OO5 Oxenhall was purchased by the Milbankes ; and it is now the property of Lady Byron. Oxenhall contains those well-known curious pools or wells called Hell Kettles. In Brompton's Chronicle they are thus mentioned : \u2014 \" On Christmas day, 1179, a wonderful matter fell out at Oxenhale, viz. that in the land of Lord Hughe, bishop of Duresme, the ground rose up to such a height, that it was equal to the tops of the highest hills, and higher than the spires and towers of the churches, and so remained at that height from nine of the morning till sun-set. But at the setting sun the earth fell in with such a horrid crash, that all who saw that strange mound, and heard its fall, were so amazed, that for very fear many died, for the earth swallowed up that mound ; and where it stood was a deep pool.\" Lord Lyttleton, in his Note in the Appendix to the Life of King Henry II., says, \"Camden supposes these deep pits in a field near Darlington, which, in his time, the common people called Hell Kettles, to be the remains of this very extraor- dinary rising and sinking of the earth ; but, in the account above given, only one pit is mentioned, and naturally the falling in of an heap of soil so raised would form but one. This hill probably was puffed up by subterraneous fires, like that in the Lucrine Lake, now called Monte-novo ; but what has filled up the chasm caused by its sinking, or divided it into different cavities, it is not easy to say.\" The ancient opinion of these pools was, that they were bottomless, and that the water in them was hot. Another idea existed that they had a subterraneous communication with the Tees. Le- land says (Itin. vol. vi. p. 24), \" Mr. Doctor Bellazis told me, that a dukke, markid after the fas- cion of dukkes of the bishoprike of Duresme, was put in into one of the pooles called Hei Ketelles, betwixt Darlington and Tesebank, and after was found at **** bridge, upon Tese thereby, wher Gervalx (Clervaux) duellith, and that be it the people had a certain conjecture, that there was species subter betwixt the ij places.\" Camden says that Bishop Tunstall found a goose in the Tees, which he had marked and put into the largest pool for an experiment.* Dr. Kay, in a letter to * Numerous instances are preserved by tradition of similar circumstances, all probably derived from the above ; and one story magnifies Leland's duck or Camden's goose into a cow, which a pike dragged by the vol. 11. 2 R"], [168, "152 DARLINGTON WARD\u2014 S. E. D. Camden, describes the largest as 30 yards deep. Mr. Grose visited and measured them in 177^- They are four in number ; three of them are near each other in tbe second field from the road, betwixt the second and third milestone; and the fourth and smallest is in tbe field next the turn pike. The diameter of the three larger pools is about 38 yards each, and their respective depths 19-^ feet, 17 feet, and 14 feet; the diameter of the smallest is 28 feet, and its depth only 5|- feet. All of them are nearly round ; tbe water stands to the brim, is quite cold, and impregnated with sulphur, curdling with milk, and refusing to mix with soap. There seems no reason to suspect a communication with the Tees; because, as observed by Hutchinson, \"though the pools are near the level of the river, they are never influenced theieby in great floods, which would otherwise shew a sudden rising, falling, agitation, or boiling up, if the water of the river was forced thither, up any level, or by virtue of syphonical operations and exhausted air in some subterraneous tube.\" Various conjectures have been adopted to get rid of the account of the preternatural formation of the Hell Kettles. Coal-works wrought out and drowned, lime-pits, alum or marle-pits, have all been brought forward ; but the circumference of the pools seems too large for old coal-works, be sides that no coal is ever known to have been wrought in this neighbourhood ; and, amongst the above ideas, that of old marle-pits seems the most plausible. Hutchinson says, \" Marie was known to the Romans, and by them exported hence to foreign countries; we have statues mentioned by our antiquaries, dedicated to Nehallennia, or the tiew moon, particularly some inscribed by Nego ciator Cretarius Britannicianus, a dealer in marie, chalk, or fuller's earth, to the British territo ries: and these being called Nehallennia 's Kettles, or of NIE-HEL, in tbe old German tongue, from the trader's dedication, might be corrupted to or called Hell's Kettles, and the monastic writers, to efface the memory of the old superstition, might devise the foregoing miraculous ac count.\" Notwithstanding this very laboured deduction, however, the vicinity of Croft and Dins dale Spas proves the possibility of the formation of these holes by subterraneous fires or sulphur ; and the story in the old chronicle, after making due allowance for a little exaggeration, is perhaps entitled to some consideration. The name might probably be derived from their supposed infernal origin, or, according to Surtees, from the dark, deep aspect of the pools, and the sulphureous taste of their waters,* nose into the pool whilst drinking, and which was afterwards seen floating in the Tees ! Nothing could be more natural, however, as observed by Surtees, than for a duck or goose to leave these brackish Kettles, and traverse two or three fields to the clear water of Tees. * In the records of Bishop Skirlaw, who entered on tbe see in 1389, are mentioned \"three acres, called Helle, in Darlington, (held) by fealty and tenpence.\" In the Polyolbion, 29th Song, the Tees recites : \u2014 \" Then I do bid adieu To Bernard's battelled towers, and seriously pursue stly course to Neptune's Court ; but as forthright I runne, The Skern, a dainty nymph, saluting Darlington, Comes in to give me ayd, and being prowd and ranke, Shee chanc'd to looke aside, and spieth neere her banke, (That from their lothsome brimms do breath a sulpherous sweat) He/l-ketllcs rightly cald, that with the very sight This water-nymph, my Skerne, is put in such affright, That with unusual speed she on her course doth hast, And rashly runnes herselfe into my widened waste.\""], [169, "DARLINGTON. 153 Blackwell Is a neat small village and township, 1| mile south-by-west from Darlington, situated on a fine ridge of land on the banks of the Tees, and commanding a view of the deep meadows and green levels of that river, which form an amphitheatre of three or four miles, hemmed in by rising wooded grounds. The village contains a school, two blacksmiths, a cartwright, a brick-maker, a corn-mill, and four public houses ; and the township includes eight farmsteads. John Allan, Esq., a magistrate, has a handsome and pleasant residence here. Blackwell Grange, an elegant, spacious mansion of brick, stands about a mile to the south of Darlington, on risino* oround betwixt the Tees and Skerne, commanding a rich and varied prospect over Darlington and the adjacent coun try.

Five farmers held four oxgangs, and paid'rents and services like those of Darlington. Thomas Fitz-Robert held an oxgang, and paid 40d. Four acres, once of John Ru fus, paid 16d.

Robert Bland paid 6d. for a little plot of land, Hugh Pundere 12d. for one acre, and there was a toft waste. In Bishop Bury's time, a family had assumed the local name. By Hatfield's Survey, John Mid dleton held a messuage and five oxgangs, 23s. 8d. He also held a parcel of tillage called Gromball, two parcels called Lynholme and Elstantoftes, a tenement called the Castle-hill, the herbage of Bathley, and divers other small portions. William Strygate, chaplain, Emma Morrell, Peter Thomesson, and four other tenants, held portions of land by rents and knight's service. John Verty and nineteen others held 24 messuages and 40;'> oxgangs, the rents and services as those of Darlington. They also held five oxgangs, which were once bond-land, paying at the Feast of the Purification ten quarters of wheat, five of barley, and fifteen of oats. Five cottagers made hay ricks, carried fruit, worked at the mill, and paid at the four terms 21d. each. Twenty-five tenants held certain tofts and crofts, tenements and lands, called Exchequer-lands, free ofall service, only paying clivers annual rents. Tbe bond-tenants held an acre called Punder-land, 2s. 6d. ; and they paid for the office of Punder 10s., for wocllades at the Nativity of St. John Ils. 9d., and for toll of ale 3s.

The family of Middleton, mentioned in the Survey, long held lands here ; as did the Eures of Witton, and the Bowes's of Streatlam. The principal or manorial property belonged to the Earls of Westmoreland, who, in 1563, sold lands here to Edward Perkinson of Beaumond Hill, and which afterwards belonged to the Garnets. In 1685, the freeholders here were, William Richard son, Gent., in London ; Whayre Fawcett, Gent. ; Thomas Garthorne (sold to Peter Hutchinson, who lives at Cornforth).

A. * This gentleman devoted himself, from an early age, with extreme ardour to the collection of materials for a history of his native county. His library contained, besides his own collections, the greater part of Randall's MSS., and a large portion of those of Gyll, Hunter, Mann, Hodgson, and Swainston. In 1774, he circulated printed queries, calculated to elicit information; but he finally declined the task of himself arranging for the press the materials which had cost him so much time and labour ; and his printed works are confined to a republication of Hegge's Legend of St. Cuthbert; Hall's MS. Catalogue of Bishops, from the Dean and Chapter's Library ; the Life of Bishop Trevor, 1776 ; the Returns of Members of Parliament for the County of Durham ; the Foundation Charter of the Cathedral ; and the well-known Collections for Gateshead, Sherburn, and Greatham Hospitals. That the ardour of stir. Allan as a collector was not, how ever, confined to provincial antiquities, is evinced by his purchasing, at tbe splendid price of \u00a3700, stir. Tunstall of Wyclitfe's noble collection of British Birds, antiquities, and curiosities ; the birds alone of which are said to have cost stir. Tunstall \u00a35000. Surtee3 says, \" Paintings were not forgotten : these filled every pannel, gradually initiated themselves along the passages, and cloathed the walls of the great staircase. Of the portraits, some of the most remarkable are, Anna Boleyn, by Holbein ; Sir Henry Wotton, by Sir P. Lely ; Lady Castlemaine, by Lely ; William Earl of Pembroke and bis Lady, by Jansen ; Margaret, sister to Henry VIII., when young, by stlaubeuge ; and a gallant portrait of Lord Fairfax, the Parliament general, by Lely ; a Lion Hunt, bv old Wyke ; a Landscape, by Teniers ; and the Head of a Corpse, horri bly expressive, by Caracci. The collection included several excellent crayon drawings by Francis Place \u2014 Philip Wolrych, Esq., a fine head of Charles II., and William Penn and his wife.\" The library of stir. Allan was rich in English topography ; and his law library was also extensive. His most remarkable pursuit, however, was printing, at his private press, such subjects of antiquity or biography as struck his fancy, which he commenced doing about 1768. Most of these productions are now extremely scarce, and are highly valued by collectors. Concerning the \"Collections relating to St. Edmund's Hospital at Gatesheved,\" bis son, John Allan, Esq., says, in a letter to stir. Nichols, \" There were but fifty copies printed, and that when I was too young to have made any observation. I can only add, that from what I have been told, that a great part of it was executed by a small folding-press ; but a regular printer having set up business in the town during the progress of it, a frame was made, to bold four quarto pages (tbe pre vious part having been performed by a page only at a time) which were composed at home, and sent, with the paper ready damped, to be worked off by the printer. The Tracts relating to Greatham and Sherburn Hospitals were printed in the same manner; and it is curious to observe, that an intimate acquaintance of my father's, now living, asserts, that the proofs never stood in need of correction, he himself being not only the compositor, but the distributor ofthe types when the form was broken up.\" In 1763, stir. Allan enter tained a design of publishing an elaborate Copperplate Peerage; but was deterred from its accomplishment by the expense. In 1704, he had an offer of the place of Richmond Herald, a situation which, though in earlier life it might have been very acceptable, was then refused as incompatible with his established profes sional connexions and future prospects in his native county. On his father's death in 1790, he retired en tirely from the pursuit of the law, and chiefly devoted the leisure of his remaining years to the forwarding his favourite scheme of a County History of Durham. A great part of the materials of Hutcbinson's valuable work were drawn from the stores preserved at Grange. When the museum collected by stir. Tunstall, and improved by Mr. Allan, was offered for sale by public auction by the trustees of the latter gentleman, it was thought that it would be creditable to the Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne to rescue this celebrated collection from the hammer, and preserve it in its original integrity. That body, accordingly, purchased the whole in 1822 for \u00a3500; and it now forms a part of the extensive and valuable collection deposited in their Library. stir.

He was a candidate at the next election, 1818, but declined a poll, and immediately afterwards retired to France, and lived at St. Omers for several years greatly respected. He died, after a short but severe illness, July 21, 1828. His remains were interred in the family vault, at Darlington.

It is intended for a new line of road to be made from Darlington to Barton-lane-end, to communicate with the road to Richmond. Cockerton Is a large village and township, one mile north-west from Darlington, on a small stream which falls into the Skerne a little to the south of the latter place. Many of the inhabitants are employed in weaving linen for the Darlington manufacturers. A school-room was built here by subscription in 1825, and endowed with \u00a35 per annum by Lord Crewe's trustees. Divine service is performed in it every Wednesday evening by one of the parish curates ; and here is also a Methodist chapel, which was built in 1823. The village contains three public houses ; and the township includes twelve farmsteads. Cockerton was one of the places given by Styr to St. Cuthbert, along with Darlington. Accord ing to Boldon Book, the villains held 47 oxgangs of land under the like rents and services as those of Darlington. Five farmers held three oxgangs and a half by the same services as those of Dar lington ; and six cottagers paid 3s. lOd. and worked as those of Blackwell. In Bishop Bury's time, Thomas, the son of Jollanus de Morton, held, by the courtesy of England, a messuage and four oxgangs of land in Cockerton, by homage, fealty, and a certain rent to the bishop's exchequer. By Hatfield's Survey, John of Morton held a messuage and four oxgangs, by knight's service and 20s. ; and one parcel, once of Margaret Ralph, 12d. Geoffrey Kellaw, a messuage and ox gang, and rendered one hen at the Nativity, and one farthing at Michaelmas. John Dow held one tenement, which he acquired of John de Morton, 12d. He ancl three other cottagers held each a cottage and garden, containing half an acre of meadow land, paid 3s. 4d. per annum each, drove cattle to the bishop's manor-house when required, cleaned the houses within the manor-place of Derlyngton against the coming of the bishop or his officers, made bay-ricks, carried fruit, and worked at the mill. John Cornforth and eighteen other bond-tenants held 31 messuages and 39 oxgangs, the rents and services as those of Derlyngton. They paid for woodlades at the Feast of St. John Ils. 10d., for the office of Punder 10s., for toll of ale 2s., and they answered for the rent of one plot near the gate, which was once Stephen the Punder's, 16d. ; and for an increment of a toft and croft, once of Robert Fitz-Ralpb, 2s.

Cockerton Field House, to the south of the village, was the estate of the Hodgsons in 1650. Some years ago, it belonged to John Wetherall, Esq., and recently to Richard William Johnson, Esq., solicitor in Darlington. It is now occupied by the convent of nuns of the order of St. The resa, who removed hither from Cocken (see vol. i. p. 367), allcl from whom it has received the ap pellation of Carmel House.

The parish of Aycliffe is bounded by Haughton-le-Skerne on the south, by Bishopton on the south-east, by Great Stainton and Sedgefield on the east, by Bishop-Middleham and Merrington on the north, by St. Andrew's Auckland on the north-west, and by Heighington on the west. It is divided into four townships or constableries, viz. 1. Aycliffe, which includes Heworth ; 2. Braf ferton, which includes Ketton and Newton-Ketton ; 3. Preston -le-Skerne, which includes Grindon and Howhills; and, 4. Woodham, which includes Nun-Stainton, Copelaw, and Ricknall. The entire parish, in 1801, contained 1137 inhabitants; in 1811, 1129; and in 1821, 1378, comprising 293 families, inhabiting 286 houses. The estimated annual value of property assessed to the county-rate for the year ending January 12, 1829, was \u00a3'9196, 10s. Aycliffe. The village of Aycliffe (in old records written variously Aclif, Aicliffe, Accliffe, and Aykley) is supposed to have derived its name from the old oak-woods which stood there. It was, with School- Aycliffe in the parish of Heighington, amongst the villages which Simeon says were mortgaged or pledged for a time by Bishop Aldune to the Earls of Northumberland, towards supporting the wars of those times.

The same prelate granted the church of Aycliffe to the convent of Durham, with the tithes belonging thereto; and Bishop Flambard received a confirmatory grant of Aycliffe from the crown, specifying that it was one of the places the people of Northumberland had injuriously claimed against St. Cuthbert and the see. Bishop Farnham granted free-warren to the convent in their lands of Aycliffe. Bishop Hatfield in 1379, Fordham in 1388, and Dudley in 1484, granted licences for the convent to ac quire lands in this parish ; in consequence of which, the dean and chapter are now proprietors of nearly all the land in Great Aycliffe, which they let in 21 years leases renewable every seven years. The extensive possessions of the church have never left space for any large freehold estate here. The Claxtons of Old Park, the Conyers of Sockburn, and the Bulmers of Tursdale, anciently held parcels of freehold in Aycliffe. In 1685, the freeholders were, John Whitfield, William Simpson, John Walker, Thomas Thursby ; John Atkinson, aged and blind ; Richard Richmond; Robert Byerley, Esq. (Heworth); and William Richmond, of Dry-close. At present, Mr. Nicholas Gra ham, Mrs. Watson of Heworth, and the Messrs. Elcoats, possess property in this township.

Great Aycliffe is a considerable village, pleasantly situated on the great north road, and on the west bank of the Skerne, 5 miles north from Darlington. About 100 of the inhabitants are em ployed in weaving linen for the Dallington manufacturers ; and on the east side of the village a paper-mill ancl a corn-mill are put in motion by the Skerne, which here frequently overflows its low banks, and inundates the neighbouring meadows. Here are five hotels and inns, with masons, blacksmiths, joiners, grocers, and other tradesmen. The township includes fourteen farms. The Church Is a handsome structure, with a west tower about 85 feet high ; and as it stands on a rising ground at a short distance. west of the village, it has a fine effect when viewed from the Darlington road. The principal entrance is through a south porch. The steeple is supported by pointed arches, under one of which facing the nave is an old painted coat of arms of King Charles I., and a gallery beneath. The nave has regular side-aisles ; that to tbe south being formed by three pointed arches, supported by cylindrical pillars ; and that to the north by three circular arches with zigzag mouldings, the pillars octagonal. The chancel opens under a pointed arch, with the nail-head ornament. The east window is a square modern sash. The windows in the south aisle are under circular arches, and those in the north aisle are square. According to the Saxon Chronicle, in the year 782 a synod was held at Aycliffe, and another in 789. There was a guild instituted in the church, dedicated to St. Mary the Virgin, \"to which"], [174, "DARLINGTON WARD.\u2014 S. E.

Monuments. \u2014 The fragments of two Saxon crosses, which formerly stood on square pedestals in the church-yard, are deposited in the porch beneath the tower. One of them was re-erected, a few years ago, in its original situation; but the injury it sustained from some wanton or bigotted per sons caused it to be again removed. This, which appears to be the elder and ruder of the two, has no figure except a snake and some other animal : the transept or cross limb is broken off. The other is richly sculptured with figures in compartments, separated from each other by the most delicate Saxon tracery and ornaments. One compartment represenes the crucifixion, and the sol diers piercing tbe Saviour's side; three rude figures above are possibly intended to represent the Trinity. In another department are two figures, one wearing a pall; and a fourth subject is sup posed to be St. Peter crucified with his head downward.* A knightly effigy, 6 feet 10 inches in height, lay in tbe church-yard, on the south side of the church ; but it has recently been removed into the chancel. The hands are elevated and clasped on the breast, the sword sheathed, a plain shield on the left arm ; the legs are crossed, tbe feet resting on a dog. Tbe whole is much defaced by time and exposure to the weather. On a flat slab within the altar-rails are sculptured two crosses. By the side of one is a pair of pincers; and near the other a sword, a hammer, and some other instrument, and a cross patee.

This legacy was invested in the navy five per cents, in lieu of which there is stock in the new four per cents, producing dividends to the amount of \u00a33, 18s. 2d. yearly. This sum (deducting the expense of receiving the dividends) is paid to the master of the parochial school at Aycliffe, which was built by sub scription, and has no other endowment. On account of this payment, he instructs eight children, nominated by the vicar and churchwardens, in reading, writing, and accounts, at 3d. per week each, which is half the ordinary charge. Gibson's Charily. \u2014 Thomas Gibson, by will, February 3, 1702, devised to the poor of the township of Great Aycliffe, his close called the Millholme, of the yearly value of 40s., and directed that the parson of the parish there for the time being should take and from time to time renew the lease thereof in his name, for the use of the poor of Great Aycliffe for ever, and should distribute the rent thereof in white bread to the said poor every Lord's day at the communion table. The Millholme is situate in the township of Great Aycliffe, and contains between one and two acres of land. It is let to Ralph Thompson, at a high rent of \u00a33, 10s. a year. There is no separate lease of the Millholme, but it is included in tbe lease granted from time to time by the dean and chapter to the lessees of the entire estate of which it forms a part. The pro portion of the fine paid for the charity land has been 30s. for each of the three or four last renewals, and the share of the rent paid is ls. About 5s. or 6s. yearly is kept in band to prepare for tbe fine to be paid on the renewal ofthe lease; and the remainder, after paying ls. rent, is given away in white bread every Sun day, at the discretion of the minister, to poor old persons of the township of Great Aycliffe attending divine service, one, two, or three loaves to each person. The sum to be divided amounts to about ls. 4ld. for each Sunday, and for this sum there are eighteen penny loaves provided. Heworth, a mile to the north of Aycliffe, is named in Boldon Book, as being in the tenure of Gilbertus, for three marks, on payment of which be was discharged from all tbe ancient services, which were due in thanage, similar to Ricken-hall. By Hatfield's Survey, it appears that Heworth was tbe property of William Brus, who then held the vill by foreign service and 15s. rent. From his heirs it passed to the Hotons of Herdwyk, who conveyed a part in 1441 to trustees for the convent of Durham. The remainder passed by marriage to the Hebbornes.

Brafferton Is a village and township, about a mile to tbe south of Aycliffe, on the east of the Skerne. A Me thodist chapel was erected here about 20 years ago; ancl, in 1823, a school-room was built by sub scription, and endowed with \u00a3T2 a year by the Diocesan Society. The township contains a corn mill, a few mechanics, and about a dozen farms. By Boldon Book, Brafferton rendered 24s. 3id. for cornage, one milch cow, one castleman, and five chalders of barley, the like of meal ancl of oats. The thane attended the chace with two grey hounds and five cords, and followed the court, but did not feed dog nor horse. Under the Survey, the services were commuted, for a milch cow 6s., for a castleman 15s., for cornage 22s. 6d., and for scat (or exchequer-grain) seven bushels of wheat, seven of malt, and one quarter six bushels of oats. The families of Chauncelor and Brafferton held lands here. In 1368, Thomas de Brafferton, \" ex treme sick in the time of the late visitation,11 conveyed to trustees two messuages and 108 acres of land, with intent to enfeoff Thomas his son, then a minor, which was deemed fraudulent and col lusive, to deprive the bishop of his right of wardship. Brafferton was afterwards divided amongst the Eures, Forsters, Killing-halls, Aslakbys, and Wrenns. In 1685, the freeholders were, William Wilson, of Durham, Gent. ; Edward Searle, Gent. ; Richard Thursby, Gent. ; Ralph Tunstall, Gent., attorney ; and Sir Mark Milbanke, Bart. (Ketton). Ketton is situated 2 miles south from Aycliffe. The bouse stands on rising ground above the Skerne, to the east of the great road. Bishop Carilepho gave this place to the convent of Durham ; yet, by Boldon Book, Adam de Holmed held it on lease of the bishop at 20 marks rent. The convent, however, bad afterwards uninterrupted possession till the Reformation ; after which Ket ton was granted to Sir Arthur Darcy, Knt., from whom it passed to Sir William Belasyse, and afterwards to the Wildes and Milbankes. Sir Ralph Milbanke sold Great Ketton, some years ago, to the Rev. Henry Hardinge, rector of Stanhope. Frederick Hardinge, Esq., is the present pro prietor. Newton-Ketton, where John Trotter, Esq., has an estate, is entirely leasehold.* Preston-le-Skerne Is a village and township on the Skerne, to the east of Aycliffe, ancl containing eleven farms. The De la Poles held lands in Preston under the Nevilles for several descents, until Roger Thornton, merchant, of Newcastle, purchased their possessions here. The Walworths also held lands under the Nevilles. In 1384, John Neville, lord of Raby, granted all his possessions here to Thomas Claxton, Esq., of Old Park, whose descendants conveyed them to the Conyers o/ Horden. In 1767, the heiresses of Conyers sold their lands here to Rowland Burdon, Esq., for \u00a3'20,000. An, other portion descended through thc Clements, Stephensons, and Pewterers, to Robert Chalmers, of Auckland, Esq.; ancl be sold it in I77I, for \u00a3* 21 00, to Rowland Burdon, Esq., who, some years ago, conveyed the greater part of his property here to Mr. Paul Watson, of Bradbury.

After their attainder, it belonged successively to the families of Moor, Cropley, and Mickleth waite, and latterly to \u2014 Dennison and Edward Wilkinson, Esqrs. Woodham. The village of Woodham is situated on the great north road, 8 miles from Darlington, with a bridge of one arch over the Skerne. It contains a public house ; and, exclusive of Nun-Stainton and Ricknall Grange, there are ten farms in the township. The village is said at some distant pe riod to have been burned by the Scots. There are continued traces of foundations by the Skerne side to the east of the bridge. Thomas cle Acley was lord of Woodham (and Whitworth) in 1291. Cicely, daughter of Gilbert de Heworth, gave the service of Thomas Fitz-Thomas de Wodham, arising from half the vill of Wodom, to the support of a chaplain at Pounteys-bridge ; and the service of Thomas de Wodom, arising from the other half of the vill, to the monks of Durham. The Whitworths (supposed to be the same family under the name of their new residence) afterwards held both manors. The manor of AVoodham subsequently passed to the Ayscoughs ancl the Jenisons of Walworth. In 1685, the freeholders were, Francis Hutton, Gent. ; the heirs of Richard Greeveson, of Rushyford ; the heirs of Richard Heighley ; John Skelton, Esq. (Ricknall Grange), in Yorkshire; and Thomas Woodham, Gent. The principal property in Woodham is now vested, by purchase from Lord Durham, in the Earl of Eldon ; and a part belongs to Mr. John Nelson.* * Woodham-moor seems to have been the usual place for the county-races in the reign of James I.

Ricknall Grange. \u2014 Ricknall Grange and mill are situated on the Skerne, a little above Preston, and 6i miles north from Darlington. Here are three farms. By Boldon Book, there were in New Rickenhall twelve villains, each of whom held one oxgang of land of nine acres, for which they wrought three days in the week between St. Peter's day and Martinmas, and the rest of the year two days in the week. They each tilled four portions of land for winter sowing, and rendered two bens and 20 eggs. The demesnes, with four ploughs and the stock of sheep, were in tbe possession of the bishop. Hatfield's Survey states that there were 12 oxgangs of land, containing 20 acres each. William Tedy of Acley held the whole vill, with tbe aforementioned work and other privi leges, at 100s. 6d. rent. John del Loge held the Grange in farm, with the demesne lands, contain ing four carucates, each carucate eight oxgangs, and each oxgang 20 acres, at _\u00a320 rent. The prior of Durham paid for the scite of Acley-mill 12d. The estate is still leasehold under the see of Durham. Nun-Stainton is a hamlet separated by the Skerne from Bradbury and the Isle in Sedgefield parish, and containing two farmsteads and a corn-mill. Bishop Pudsey confirmed to M. Prioress of Monketon and the nuns the whole vill of Staynton-upon-Skyren in Haliwerfolc, as freely as Iveta de Arches, sister of the prioress, gave the same ; and also the privileges which John de Amundevill held in the chapel of Staynton, viz. that the church of Acley should provide a chap lain to celebrate in it all rites save burial ; \" and we the more heartily grant and confirm these privileges, because of the difficulties and great perils which the folk of Staynton might incounter in the long distance which lies betwixt them and the mother church.11 These privileges were con firmed on some disputes which occurred between the nuns and the vicars of Aycliffe. After the Dissolution, the estate was granted to Lord Latimer ; and he immediately conveyed to the Smythes, who had been tenants under the nuns. In 179-, Sir Edward Smythe, Bart., sold Nun-Stainton to Major-general John Lambton, of Lambton ; from whose descendant, Lord Durham, it has passed to the Earl of Eldon. PARISH OF HEIGHINGTON. This parish is bounded by Aycliffe on the east, by St. Andrew's Auckland on the north, by Gainford on the west-, and by Darlington and Haughton-le-Skerne on the south. It includes seven constableries : 1. Heighington; 2. School- Aycliffe ; 3. Redworth ; 4. Midridge-Grange ; 5. Coatsay- Moor; 6. Walw-orth ; and, 7- Killerby. In 1801, there were 1316 inhabitants in the parish, who, in 1811, had decreased to 1113, In 1821, however, the number had advanced to 1383, consisting of 318 families, inhabiting 300 houses. In 1828-9, the annual value of property assessed to the county-rate was \u00a3?8795. Heighington. By Boldon Book, there were sixteen villains in Heighington, each of whom held two oxgangs, and rendered ten chalders of malt, the like of meal and of oats, and 64 chalders of aver-malt, of"], [179, "HEIGHINGTON. 163 the accustomed measure of Heghyngton-hall; carried\" eight wodlades, ancl rendered 32 bens, 1000 eggs, 26s. for cornage, one milch cow, and one castleman. There were two cottagers, each holding 15 acres, for which they wrought two days in every week throughout the year, and joined with thc villains in their scats, or exchequer-dues, tbe milch cow, and yeulwaiting.* Three other cot- tagers held each four acres, and wrought, from St. Peter's day to Martinmas, two days in the week, and the rest of the year one day in the week. The villains ancl cottagers weeded all the growing corn of the vill, and provided each week in autumn, for each oxgang of land, one man to reap, and prepared four portions of land with their whole families except the housewives, when they were intitled to a corrody. Every villain ploughed and harrowed an acre, ancl had their corrody ; ancl they made one portion, one day, with all the harrows of the town. The sixteen villains ren- dered 16s. for michelmet,-f and 6s. for yeulwaiting. Simon Hostarius held 60 acres, and rendered a bezant. Thomas the Clerk held four oxgangs for half a mark, tilled three portions, and served on embassies. Thomas de Penie held two oxgangs, once of Hugh Boun, ancl paid 2s. rent, and 2s for cornage. The mills of Heghyngtonshire paid 12 marks. The punder bad six acres and his thraves, and rendered fourscore hens and 500 eggs. The demesne lands were in farm. All the villains and cottagers of Heghyngton served in winning and leading the lord's hay, and inclosed and fenced in the court ancl the virgultum : they also carried the lord's corn where he ordered, be tween Tyne and Tees ; and each provided one cord at the great chace, and the bishop himself pro vided, for the proportion of Heghyngton-hall, 15 cords. Under Hatfield's Survey, the free tenants had increased considerably. Robert Gileth, John Chilton, Robert Menvile, John Couhird, AVilliam North, John of Nottingham, ancl two others, held messuages and lands at clivers rents, in all 12s. 8d. Seven tenants held Exchequer-lands un der certain rents. Richard Scrope, Chivaler, 100 acres, called The Brakkes, without rent. The free tenants and the tofts in Heighington paid altogether 4s. for cornage at the Feast of St. Cuth bert in September. The service of the cottagers was the same as in Boldon Book, but commuted for payments; as were also the services of the bond-tenants, amongst whom the vicar held a mes suage and two oxgangs for 10s. ld. obol. In the valor of the manor, it is described to consist of one manor-house, with one oxgang of land, and two granges, one curtilage, 28 oxgangs of demesne, each containing 15 acres, and eight acres of meadow ; the whole value, <\u00a310, 13s. 4d. The Scropes continued for several descents to hold Freeman' s-brakes. The other freeholds in Heighington have always been minutely subdivided. The AVyots, Ferys, Hunters, Evenwoods, and Del Norths, occur in early records. In 1685, the freeholders were, AVilliam Morley, John Fewler, John Chaytor of Richmond, Thomas Dobson, Anne Lawson, Christopher Runthwaite, John Atkinson, Robert Tewart, John Rain, AA^illiam Runthwaite, Richard Robinson, AVilliam * The yeulwaiting was the watch, or wails, as they are still called, who paraded the streets with music. \"Most ofthe ancient church customs,\" says Hutchinson, \"were derived from the heathens, and this in par ticular ; for when the sun approached to its winter period, or solstice, they devised tbe fable, that Typhon, or the evil spirit of darkness, was contending with the god of day, and that his legions were dispersed over the earth, to carry mischiefs to mankind ; therefore, to repel their malignity, or drive them from the habitar tions of man, music was used, and fires lighted. After Christianity was received, this old custom was re tained, to please those whose minds superstition and ancient practices had prejudiced ; and the waits, or musical watch, and yeul-fires, were continued, only applying them to the birth of our Saviour, the Sun of Righteousness, instead of the former ridiculous fable.\" t The payment for the michelmet was for the charges of the Michaelmas court, or mote of the manor. vol. n. 2 U"], [180, "DARLINGTON WARD.\u2014 S.

That the said school should be free for the children of all the inhabitants within the said parish, and for all other children born within the said parish, or main tained at the charge of any of tbe inhabitants within the said parish, paying only 4d. a piece at entering, and 2d. quarterly ; but that for teaching other children not appointed to be free, the schoolmaster might take 2s. a piece yearly, and no more, of the poorer sort ; but for rich men and gentlemen's sons such wages as he and they should agree upon. That the schoolmaster should take especial regard that every scholar should come duly and orderly to tbe church every .Sunday and holiday, at morning and evening prayer. That the schoolmaster should instruct his scholars in the accidence and Lilly's grammar, and also in the Greek grammar, and other easy Latin and Greek authors therein mentioned, according to their capacities, and as the bishop of Durham for the time being should direct. That upon festival days and other convenient tinies tbe master should instruct his scholars in writing and accounts, and should weekly peruse their writing and cyphering, and set them copies, without taking any thing other than was above limited. That the master should not absent himself from the school bevond tbe time therein specified without the licence of the bishop of Durham, or in the time of a vacancy of the dean and chapter of Durham. That the master should be nominated by the dean and chapter of Durham whenever a vacancy should occur, and if they should not no minate within two months, by the bishop of Durham. And a power was given to the bishop of Durham for the time being, or such as he should appoint, and in time of a vacancy of the said see, to the dean and chapter of Durham, to oversee and visit the said school, schoolmaster, and scholars, and their proficiency in learning, and to examine whether they should keep these articles ; and upon breach of any of these articles, or for any other cause, offence, or misdemeanor seemin\" just and reasonable, to deprive or remove any such schoolmaster, which deprivation should be openly read in the parish church of Heighington, on some Sunday in the forenoon, in the time of divine service, and that from the time of such publishing, the said office of schoolmaster should be judged and deemed void to all intents and purposes.

D., and four others, for three lives, a close called the Waste, and another close called Halliwell Close, and half a rood of land, with the school-house erected thereon, with tbe appurtenances, situate within the township and terri- tories of Heighington, at the yearly rent of 4s., on trust that the said lessees, their heirs and assigns, should let the said premises to tbe best advantage, and pay the rents to such schoolmaster or schoolmasters as they or their successors should appoint ; such schoolmasters to be allowed and approved of by the said bishop and his successors. In 1770, the Rev. Robert Blacklin was appointed master of the grammar-school at Heigh- ington by the dean and chapter; and he for several years taught school, and received the yearly rent-charge of \u00a310 ; and he also enjoyed the freehold land called Brecking Hill, paying thereout \u00a32, 9s. annually for the poor, as hereafter mentioned, and also the leasehold land demised by tbe bishop of Durham in 1724. In 1808, complaints having been made of his conduct as schoolmaster, and it being stated to the bishop of Durham that he had neglected the tuition of the children, the bishop, by an instrument bearing date October 26, 1808, declared the office of schoolmaster to be void ; and this sentence was read in the parish church on the Sunday following, stir. Blacklin paid no attention to the sentence, but continued to receive the yearly rent-charge of \u00a310, and also to enjoy both the freehold and leasehold premises till the year 1810, when he gave up the leasehold premises in consequence of legal proceedings having been instituted against him for the recovery thereof, the three persons upoii whose lives the lease was granted being all dead. From this period also, Robert Surtees, Esq., by whom the rent-charge of \u00a310 was payable, withheld that payment. After possession was obtained of the leasehold premises, subscriptions were raised for rebuilding the old school-house, which had fallen down, and application was made to the bishop of Durham for a new lease. By indenture, September 18, 1811, the Right Rev. Shute bishop of Durham demised the said premises, by the same description as contained in the lease of 1724, to trustees for three lives, at the same rent and upon the same trusts as declared in the lease of 1724. A school was erected by subscription on the old scite in 1812, at an expense of nearly \u00a3300; and in 1813 a master was appointed by the lessees. At a meeting of the trustees, held January 24, 1829, Mr. Blacklin agreed, on condition that he should receive \u00a3100 of the arrears of the rent-charge immediately, and \u00a320 a year for his life, to resign possession of the lands, and give up his appointment to the dean and chapter, who had consented that the present master, Mr. Dickinson, should be appointed to succeed him. The school-house was enlarged in 1831. The following is an account of tbe present state of the school property : \u2014 1. The yearly sum of \u00a310, part of the rent-charge of \u00a311 granted by Elizabeth Jenison. This rent-charge is now payable by Robert Sur- tees, Esq., the owner of lands in Bishop-Middleham charged therewith. 2. The freehold premises in Heigh- ington, purchased in 1697- Thev consist of 11 acres of land, now divided into three closes, charged with \u00a32, 9s. yearly, as the interest of certain legacies for the poor of the parish of Heighington, and of the town- ship of Heighington. Tbe value of these premises is stated to be \u00a320 per annum. 3. The leasehold pre- mises comprised in the indenture of 1811. These consist of the school and three fields, containing together about 8^ acres, and a garden attached to the school. The latter is occupied by Thomas Dickinson, the pre- sent master, rent free. One of the fields, containing about 3A acres, is also in his occupation, having been let to him by the trustees at a good rent of \u00a312. The other two fields, containing about 5 acres, are let to a yearly tenant, at a good rent of \u00a310 a year. This rent is received by the master, who pays all the out- goings, and keeps the premises in repair. The Commissioners for inquiring concerning Charities say, \" For the income which the master derives from the leasehold premises as above mentioned, no scholars are taught free ; but all children of the parish, of the poorest class, by certificate from any of the trustees, are taught at 2d. a week, children of the middle class at 4d., and those of farmers and more substantial persons at 6d. a week.

March's Charity. \u2014 An indenture, June 5, 1595, recites that Jobn March, by his will, gave \u00a3100 to be placed in the Town-chamber of Newcastle, that the said sum should yearly, or every second year at the fur thest, be lent out by the mayor and burgesses unto the honestest and least wealthy of the young men of the fellowship or company of merchants, or any other free burgess inhabiting in the town and county of New castle upon Tyne, upon good security for repayment of the same, with \u00a310 interest for the use thereof. \u00a35 of this interest was to be distributed yearly to the poorest and neediest of the inhabitants of Newcastle ; and the other \u00a35 was to be paid and distributed amongst the poor people inhabiting and dwelling in the parish of Heighington, on a certain day yearly. The mayor and burgesses of Newcastle pay \u00a34 annually in respect of this bequest, the same sum having been paid from about the year 1660. This is given away by the minis ter, churchwardens, and the twelve, on \u00b1>iew Year's Day, with other charity money, in sums varying from ls. to 5s., amongst poor persons of the parish of Heighington, a list of whom is furnished by the overseer. Brabant's Charity. \u2014 Hercules Brabant, by will, April 22, 1612, (see Staindrop.) gave 20s. yearly to tho poor of Heighington. The sum of 19s. (ls. being deducted for land-tax) is paid by the tenant of Robert Surtees, Esq., of Redworth, the owner of the property charged. It is divided between the townships in the manner hereafter mentioned. Sundry Charities. \u2014 From 1770 to 1329, Brecking Hill was held by the Rev. Robert Blacklin, who paid thereout annually \u00a32, 9s. to the overseer, produced by the following rent-charges : \u2014 Widow Nattrass, 1632, 4s.; John Dobson, 1654, 6s.; Cuthbert Pickering, 1655, 19s.; Widow Airey, 1666, 4s.; Thomas Dobson., 1732, 5s. ; AVidow Morley, ditto, Ils. As the annual value of Brecking Hill is now estimated at \u00a320, at least one-fourth part thereof ought to be applied to charitable uses, as tbe produce of the two sums of \u00a320 and \u00a35, stated to belong to the parish and township of Heighington. It is supposed that the \u00a320 advanced by Mr. Dowbiggin on this purchase has been paid off by some charity money subsequently received. The whole of the charity money arising from the sources above mentioned amounts annually to \u00a38, 8s. ; of which \u00a31, 2s., part ofthe \u00a32, 9s. paid out of Brecking Hill, is appropriated to tbe poor ofthe township of Heighington only, and the remainder (\u00a37, 0s.) is divided amongst the other six townships of the parish in proportion to the rentals, and given away to poor persons of those townships by the respective churchwardens or overseers. Broom Dykes is a small village in the township of Heighington, 5?2 miles north-north-west from Darlington, and contains three public houses. Matthew AVilkinson, Esq. is the principal proprie tor. Houghton Bank is a hamlet 6 miles north-west from Darlington, containing two public houses and a cartwright's shop. School-Aycliffe Is a small village about half a mile north-east from Heighington, ami 5.'- miles south-south-east from Bishop-Auckland. Here is a small old mansion-bouse, with gables and mullions. Tbe town^ ship contains two farms. Sculacle, mentioned in Boldon Book as paying two marks, is supposed to have derived its name from a school established here at a very early date by the prior and convent. In Hatfield's Sur vey, it is said to be held by a free rent and knight's service, 26s. 8d. A family named Scolacle held property here of the bishop for several generations. The manor of School-Aycliffe became the possession of the Nevilles, and was granted by Ralph Lord Neville to Robert de Binchestre, who dying without issue, his possessions passed to AVilliam Forster, of North Auckland, and Jo hanna his wife, A considerable portion of this manor afterwards became vested in the Smythsons, from whom it passed, in 1606, to Francis Forster, of Darlington, for \u00a3360.

A part of School-Aycliffe, called Hollyhill, now belongs to Francis Burton, Esq. ; and the remainder to Ralph Page, Esq., whose family have long held property here. Redworth, A scattered village, is situated on the northern side of a lofty swell of limestone, a mile to the north west of Heighington, and 5 miles south-south-east from Bishop-Auckland. It contains two public houses, and a blacksmith's, a cartwright's, and a grocer's shop. The township includes twelve farmsteads. Redworth House, the seat of Robert Surtees, Esq., commands an extensive prospect to the north and east. On the west is Shackleton Hill, now planted to the summit, with a sum mer-house, built bythe late Crosier Surtees, Esq. Hutchinson says, \"Itis wound round with three distinct terraces, and is thought to be the remains of a Danish fort ; the mount bearing an exact similitude to those in the more northern parts of this island, where the Danes were stationed for many years. It is the only monument we have observed of that people between Tyne and Tees.\" From its lofty elevation, and the wide prospect from its summit, it is well calculated for a post of observation ; but there is no evidence to confirm Hutchinson's supposition. By Boldon Book, there were sixteen farmers in Redworth, each holding an oxgang, and render ing for every two oxgangs 5s. and two hens: for each oxgang they tilled three portions in autumn with eight men, led bay one clay with eight wains, and ploughed one day. Three cottagers held 12 acres, and wrought as those of Heighington. Under Hatfield's Survey, the whole vill was held by free tenures. Richard Redworth, William Heighington, William Elmetlon, William Hunter, Richard Hetheworth, Jobn Smale, and others, held divers portions at fixed rents. The Redworths and Heighingtons continued to bold lands for several descents, as did the Euros of AVitton. A pasture called Rawmore was the possession of the Scroops. An heiress of the Heighingtons mar ried into the family of March. In 1685, the freeholders were, George Trotter, Gent, of Byers- Green ; Thomas Dobson, Christopher Todd, Christopher Raine, Thomas AVhite, sen., Thomas AVhite, jun., John Richmond, Thomas Richmond, James Dobson, George Crosyer, Gent.

Newbiggin is a small village, manor, and constablewick, in the township of Redworth, situated at the source of a rivulet, 4^ miles south-by-east from Bishop-Auckland. In Boldon Book it is called the New Vill next Thickley, and was held by Guy of Redworth in exchange for that place, he rendering one mark, twelve days' reaping, working at the mill-pool ancl dam, going on embas sies, and carrying the bishop's wine betwixt Tyne and Tees with a wain of four oxen. By Hat field's Survey, John of Nottingham held tbe New A'ill by tbe same rent and services. Henry Staynesby held a messuage and certain lands lately brought into culture, 5s. ; and William Heigh ington held a parcel on Newbiggin-moor, Is. Ralph Lord Neville gave this manor, with Scole- Acle, to Robert de Bynchestre, from whose descendants it passed by marriage to the Burnynghalls, and from them to the Crosyers, in which family it continued till the death of George Crosyer in 1714. Jane, the youngest of his four daughters and coheirs, intermarried with Edward Surtees, ancestor of the present proprietor.

Old Thickley, or West Thickley, (so called to distinguish it from East Thickley, or Thickley- Punchardon, in the parish of St. Andrew's Auckland) is a hamlet and constablewick in Redworth township, 4 miles soutb-by-east from Bishop-Auckland. It was one of the places resigned to the Earls of Northumberland, and was restored by Canute to the see. By Boldon Book, Aid Thikley, part ofthe territory of Redworth, paid one mark for cornage at St. Cuthbert's day in September. By Hatfield's Survey, John Gregory and three others held 62 acres of demesne, under ls. per acre. There were 74 acres and half a rood in Widebopleys out of lease, but held by the farmer of Mid rich-Grange. John Shepherd held a cottage under 4d. rent, and certain services commuted for 12d. Tlie bond-tenants paid scat-oats, and rendered services as those of Heighington. The tenants paid for a milch-cow at Martinmas 4s., for cornage in September 1 6s., for michelmet 8s., and for yol wayting 2s. 8d. Eight tenants held one messuage, three tofts, one croft, one tenement, two gar dens, and 36 acres of land, under certain exchequer-rents.

Midridge-Grange.* This township, 5 miles south-south-east from Bishop- Auckland, is pleasantly situated on an emi nence, the base of which is crossed by tbe Witton, Darlington, and Stockton rail-road. It contains four farms and a corn-mill. Several fruitless litigations have been instituted to prove that this township (like the adjoining township and village of Midridge) was a member of the parish of St. Andrew's Auckland. It is, however, still held by the mother church of Heighington. The Grange is first mentioned in Hatfield's Survey. The manor-place, with a lodge for the bai liff, and 21 oxgangs of arable land, containing altogether 305 acres, 113 acres of mowing land, with several pasture grounds, were valued at \u00a3?28, 9s. 5d. yearly. A piece of Woodland, called Drythop, was claimed by William de Lilburn, who refused to permit the bishop's tenants to de pasture therein. The Grange was let to farm to William Hunter, at \u00a320, 13s. 4d. rent. In later times, Midridge-Grange became the seat of the Byerleys. The loyal Colonel Anthony Byerley, who commanded a regiment in the service of Charles I., garrisoned his house at Midridge for the king; and his troopers were long remembered in popular tradition as Byerley 's bull-dogs. The Grange, a spacious, treble, gable-ended mansion, could not be made capable of any regular defence ; but, as Surtees observes, as the colonel's neighbour, Loyzelure of Coatsay-Moor, bore a captain's commission under the Parliament, it might be necessary to keep a few buff jackets-)- and bandeliers * From Middle-ridge, as occupying elevated ground rising abruptly between two runners of water. Grange was the common name for a granary. t \" In the reign of King James I.,\" says Grose, \" no great alterations were made in the article of defen sive armour, except that the buff coat, or jerkin, which was originally worn under the cuirass, now became frequently a substitute for it, it having been found that a good buff leather would of itself resist the stroke of a sword ; this, however, only occasionally took place among the light-armed cavalry and infantry, complete suits of armour being still used among the heavy horse. Buff coats continued to be worn by the city trained bands till within the memory of persons now living, so that defensive armour may in some measure be said to have terminated in the same materials with which it begun, that is, the skins of animals or leather.\" Of the buff coats, which were worn over the corslet, several are yet preserved ; and Captain Grose has given an"], [187, "HEIGHINGTON. 171 in the house of Midridge.* Colonel Byerley afterwards compounded for his loyalty by a fine of _\u00a32000 ; and died April 22, 1667, aged 47.

He died in May, 1714, and was buried at Goldsborough, co. York. The estate afterwards passed by marriage to Thomas Jervoise, of Herriard, co.

This township, 3 miles south-west from Heighington, and 5 miles north-west from Darlington, contains nine farmsteads and about 24 scattered houses, and is divided into two districts or hamlets, called High ancl Low Walworth, in the former of which is situated Walworth Castle. The ham let called Walworth Gate contains the shops of a blacksmith and a cartwright and joiner. Walworth was early in possession of the family of Hansard, who are supposed to have sprung from a cadet of the house of Raby.\u00a7 Elizabeth, heiress of the last William Hansard, was placed engraving of one which was used in the time of Charles I. by Sir Francis Rhodes, Bart-, of Balbrough Hall, Derbyshire. They were usually lined with silk or linen, secured before by buttons, or by a lace, aud often richly decorated with gold or silver embroidery. * The same writer adds, that he remembers having seen a number of crooks in the long lofts or galleries under the roof, where the soldiers are said to have swung their hammocks. It would be unjust to the gallant colonel to identify bis efforts with those described in the following extract from a play called the Old Troop, brought out after the Restoration by Lacy the player, who had served his master during the civil wars : \u2014 \" You, comet, have a name that's proper for all cornets to be called by, for they are all beardless boys in our army. The most part of our horse were raised thus : \u2014 The honest country gentleman raises tbe troop at bis own charge ; then he gets a Low Country lieutenant to fight his troop safely ; then he sends for his son from school to be his cornet ; and then be puts off his child's coat to put on a buff coat : and this is the constitu tion of our army.\" The names of the officers of the Troop sufficiently express their habits ; as Flea-flint Plunder-Master-General, Captain Ferret-farm, and Quarter-Master Burn-drop. Tbe officers connive at tbe plunder of the country for a suitable share of the booty.

He was born in 1590 ; and, though his patrimony was considerable, he de termined on devoting himself to a religious life, and, at the age of 27, entered the society of Jesuits. For 30 years he was superior of the house of probationers in England, and distinguished himself in that office as well by the accuracy of his discipline, as by the rectitude of his private conduct. He published a controver sial work in English against \" Viam tulam,\" by Humphrey Lindus. He died October 10, 1656. t Thomas Jennison, an elder brother, who had taken orders as a Jesuit, was implicated in the \" Popish Plot\" invented by the infamous Titus Oates, and was committed to Newgate. Robert, mentioned in the text, turned Protestant, in consequence, as he said, of the horror he felt at Mr. Ireland protesting innocence until his death, whereas he (Jennison) had seen him in London at the time he declared he was in Stafford shire. He appeared as a witness on the trials of Viscount Stafford and Sir George Wakeman ; and his first essay in that character was to relate a slight conversation he had had with Ireland. He then swore that he knew nothing more of the matter ; but, like the rest ofthe witnesses employed on that occasion, his knowledge afterwards marvellously increased ; and he swore positively to the names of four Irish gentlemen, or ruffians, who were engaged to assassinate the king, and that his brother Thomas had said to him, \"That if C. R. would not be R. C, he should not long be C. R.,\" &c. In order to deprecate the idea of his having any si nister object in view with regard to the family estates, it is related that he would not deliver in his informa tion until he had obtained a promise from the lords of the privy council, of a pardon to be extended to his brother, though continuing obstinate. Mercy, however, to a Catholic and a Jesuit, was, at that period, out of the question ; and the unfortunate victim, after enduring all tbe hardships of a prison for a twelvemonth, died in Newgate on September 27, 1679.

It is completely surrounded by the parish of Gainford, and stands in a low situation, near the source of a small rivulet. By Boldon Book, here were twelve villains, each of whom held two oxgangs, and they rendered eight chalders of malt, the like of meal and of oats, and 48 chalders of aver-malt, of the measure of Heighington-hall ; they led six woodlades, rendered 24 hens, 26s. for cornage, one milch cow, one castleman, 12s. for michelmet, and 4s. for yeulwaiting; ancl performed equal work with those of Heighington. Two cottagers paid ls. 6d. and wrought six days in autumn ; ancl Simon Hostarius (the Door-ward) held a carucate of free land, by the twelfth part of a knight's fee. By Hatfield's Survey, John of Killerby held Simon's lands, being a messuage and 61 acres, by the same service. John Robertson and Hugh Herreson also held lands. Nine tenants held 24 oxgangs of bond-land, and for every two acres paid 8s., led seven woodlades, tilled three portions in autumn, led three great lades between Tyne and Tees, led corn four days, weeded the bishop's growing corn, mowed two days in every harvest week, ploughed ancl harrowed one acre, and tilled one portion with all their men, with other services for the mill as the tenants of Heighington. The whole of the bond-lands paid four quarters of wheat, eight quarters of oats, and 40 of malt ; and each tenant provided one cord at the great chace. There were two cottagers, and five tenants of exchequer-lands.

In the following year, AVilliam Tempest died seized of a messuage, eight tofts, 160 acres of land, and two acres of meadow in Denton, which be held of the Earl of AVestmoreland. In the reigns of Mary and Elizabeth, the Brackenburys of Selaby held lands in Denton in soccage of the crown, as of the manor of Castle Barnard, and Arcelbrake and Cherrytree meadows of the Earl of AVestmoreland, as of his manor of Raby. In 24 Eliz. George Tonge held the manor of Denton of the queen's manor of Castle Barnard ; and he also claimed the right of presentation to the chapel. George Tonge, of Denton, Esq., compounded with the parliament for his estates for \u00a3\"320. The Byerleys of Midridge-Grange, the Wilkinsons of West Layton, and the Carrs of St. Helen's Auckland, successively held this estate, which subsequently came into tbe possession of the Culleys, celebrated as graziers and agriculturists ; and it is now the property of Matthew Cul ley, Esq., of Fowberry Tower, Northumberland. The village of Denton is situated in a valley, 6 miles north-west-by-west from Darlington. It contains a large farm-house, a blacksmith's, a cartwright's, and a grocer's shop, a public house, and a school, kept by the Rev. John Birkbeck, sub-curate of Denton. On the west side of the villao*e is the old mansion-house of the Tonges, with its characteristic projecting gables and mullioned windows. It is now let in tenements. The Chapel. The ancient chapel of Denton having become much dilapidated, it was taken down, and the pre sent building erected in 1810, principally with the old materials.* It is a plain, neat structure, consisting of a nave and chancel, without tower or side-aisles. The pulpit is placed against the *\"May2, 1700.

King James I., in his route to AValworth, sat down on an eminence above Houghton-le-Side, since known by the appellation of Legs Cross, from whence he viewed Raby Castle, declaring it to be the fairest in his dominions.^ Part of this township belongs to the Duke of Cleveland, and another portion to John Bowes, of Streatlam, Esq., M.

Hilton, who belonged to the Hilton family, of Hilton, in the parish of Staindrop, left a son, named Cuthbert, of great notoriety, who, having taken orders in no church, but having been trained as bible clerk under his father, went to Barnard Castle, and celebrated illicit marriages upon the centre of the bridge. The old rhyme made use of by him on these occasions, after having made the parties leap over a broom-stick, is still remembered : \u2014 \" My blessing on your pates, and your groats in my purse ; A'ou are never tbe better, and I am never the worse.\" This Pontifex Maximus left six sons, on whom he quaintly bestowed the names of Abraham, Job, Solomon! David, Cuthbert, and Alexander, and who seem to have derived no stain from their father's illegal practices. Thev were remarkable only for their industry and ingenuity, and were the first artisans in Barnard Castle who practised the art of dyeing cloth of various colours. \u2014 Sir C.

E. D. 176 PARISH OF CONISCLIFFE. The parish of Coniscliffe is bounded on the north by Heighington, on the east by Darlington, on tlie south by the Tees, and on the west by Gainford. It is divided into two townships, called High and Low Coniscliffe, which contained together, in the year 1801, a population of 351 per sons; but, in 1811, the number had increased to 376, and in 1821 to 391, consisting of 84 families, residing in separate houses. In 1828-9, the annual value of property assessed to the county-rate was \u00a33609, 10s. By the Red Book, and other ancient authorities in the church records, it appears that Coniscliffe was very early given to the see by Snaculf, the son of Cykell. Other authorities say that lands in Coniscliffe were given by Styr, the son of Ulphus, to St. Cuthbert. The manor, from distant an tiquity, belonged to the Greystocks, who are said to have been lineal descendants of Ulphus. In the pleas ot quo warrants) of the 21st Edward I , it is stated that John de Greystock had, within his manor, the privileges of furca and infangtheof, goods and chattels of felons, and fees of court, together with free-warren in his lands there. In an inquisition taken on the death of John Grey stock, Knt., in the 30th year of Bishop Langley, the manor is described \" to extend itself as well to the vill of Nether Coniscliffe as the vill of Over Coniscliffe, and was held in capite, by the ser vice of half a knight's fee, suit at the court of Sadberge, and 13s. 4tl. rent.

Elizabeth, heiress of the house of Greystock, carried her large possessions by marriage to Thomas Lord Dacre, whose three granddaughters married the sons of Thomas Duke of Norfolk. The manor of Conis cliffe was assigned to Elizabeth, wife of Lord AVilliam Howard ; and the estate is still held by their lineal descendant, Henry Howard, of Corby, Esq. Branches of the old Cumberland or Westmoreland families of Arasey, Thirkeld,* and Sal- * Richard Thirkeld was born at Coniscliffe ; and, at an advanced age, he entered Douay college. He was made priest in 1579, came to England as a missionary, and principally laboured in and about York, where he was apprehended on the 24th of March, 1583, as he was going by night to visit a prisoner. On tbe days of his trial, May 27 and 28, be behaved with great intrepidity, and encouraged several Catholics who were placed at the bar at tbe same time. He was found guilty of high treason, and, on the next day, was drawn from the Castle to the place of execution, where he was hanged, cut down alive, dismembered, bowelled, and quartered, according to the letter of the sentence ; and a fire of straw was made upon the place, to prevent the Catholics from gathering up any of his blood. Christopher Bayles was also a native of Coniscliffe, and performed his studies partly in the English college at Rome, and partly in that of Rheims. From the latter he was sent priest upon the English mission in"], [193, "CONISCLIFFE. 177 keld,* were long established at Coniscliffe, probably from connection with the Greystocks and Dacres. In 1685, the freeholders in the parish were, Francis Bowes, of Thornton, Esq. ; Stephen Thompson, of Ulnaby, Gent, ; John Arasey, of High Coniscliffe, Gent. ; William Gibson, of the same, Gent. ; and Francis Oswald, of Low Coniscliffe, Gent. High Coniscliffe, Or Church Coniscliffe, is situated near the Tees, 4^ miles west-by-north from Darlington, on the brink of a long ridge of limestone rocks, which have been wrought to the very walls of the out- buildings, so as to form perpendicular cliff's, and have a singular and beautiful appearance when viewed at a distance. Large quantities of limestone are still got and burnt in the parish ; but the quarries near the village have been long disused. A Methodist chapel was erected here in 1826; and there is a school kept by the parish-clerk. High Coniscliffe contains two public houses; and the township, with Carlebury and Ulnaby, includes six farmsteads. The Church. The church, with ils cemetery, stands on high ground on the south side of the village, and is almost insulated by the deep workings already mentioned, which have been carried so far beneath its base as to convey the idea of its being undermined. The cliff's \"glitter in the sun like the white walls of some giant fortress;\" and the church, perched upon their brink, may be compared to its watch-tower. It consists of a chancel, nave, north aisle, ancl west tower ; the latter being embattled and surmounted by a spire. The north aisle is formed by four cylindrical pillars, with 1588 ; and, after some time, was committed to prison, where he was racked, in order to compel him to con fess where he had said mass, and by whom he had been entertained or relieved ; and, at one time, he was hung up in the air for 24 hours together. When brought to the bar, be was arraigned, tried, and condemned, under the statute of 27th Eliz., for being made priest beyond the seas, and coming into England to exercise his priestly functions; though he defended himself by the example of St. Augustine. He was drawn to Fleet Street, to a gallows erected over against Fetter Lane, and was there hanged, bowelled, and quartered, March 4, 1590. On tbe same day, Alexander Blake and Nicholas Horner were hanged for relieving Mr. Bayles, contrary to the statute. \u2014 Dr. Bridgewater '_.* Collections, sol. 116. Ribadaneira's Appendix, c. 4.

There are eight townships under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Gainford, properly so called, viz. 1. Gainford; 2. Piercebridge ; 3. Summerhouse ;* 4. Bolam; 5. Morton-Tynemouth ; 6. Headlam; 7- Langton; and, 8. Cleatlam.f These townships in 1801 contained a population of 1152 persons, which in 1811 had increased to 1310, and in 1821 to 1523, consisting of 315 families, inhabiting 292 houses. In 1828-9, the annual value of property assessed to the county-rate was .\u00a39740, 10s, Gainford. This township gave name to an ancient and extensive manor and territory, comprehending all that side of the county of Durham in which it is situated. The first church was built here, and afterwards given to the see, by Egfrid, bishop of Lindisfarne, together with the vill of Gainford, and those of Clyffe and Wycliffe on the south side of the Tees. Camden mentions the seizure of * Piercebridge and Summerhouse are situated in the South-east Division of Darlington Ward ; but, for the sake of perspicuity, are here treated of with the parish to which they belong. t Cleatlam is partly in Gainford and partly in Staindrop parish ; but the population of the whole town ship is included in the return of the former."], [198, "DARLINGTON WARD.\u2014 S. W. D. 182 these parts by the Danes.* Gainford was one of the places mortgaged to the Earls of Northum berland by Bishop Aldune to support the wars ; but it was not restored to the see. Bishop Wil-** liam de Carilepho having offended William Rufus by espousing tbe cause of his brother Robert, that king granted the forest of Teesdale and Marwood, together with the manors of Middleton and Gainford, to Guido Baliol, who had come into England with tbe Conqueror. This manor conti nued to be a separate honour, with Barnard Castle, held by that family until the attainder of Jobn Baliol ; when, notwithstanding the bishop's right of forfeitures in the county, these places were seized by the king, and granted to Guido de Bello Campo, or Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, to hold in capite of tbe crown. It was not till the time of Lewis Beaumont, in the 1st year of King Edward III., that the right of the see was recognized, after judgment obtained in parliament ; and the AVarwicks appear to have held possession for some time afterwards. During the civil wars, Sir John Sommerset, of Gainford, Knt., refused to compound with the Parliament for his estate. At present, there are several proprietors in Gainford, amongst whom are the Duke of Cleveland ; John Bowes, of Streatlam Castle, Esq., M. P. ; and William Sherwood, Esq. The village of Gainford is pleasantly situated on the north bank of the Tees, 9 miles from Dar lington and from Barnard Castle, and 4 miles south-east from Staindrop. It is \" seated,\" says Hutchinson, \" in a most delightful valley, through which the river winds beautifully. There are steep and broken cliffs on the Yorkshire side, skirted and crowned with scattered groves. The opposite lands consist of fine meadows, hanging with an easy declivity towards the river. \u2014 Compa rison is frequently made between Gainford and Hurworth, as to the beauty of their situations; but they are wholly dissimilar, the one being on an elevated brow, and the other in a sequestered vale.\" The village consists of a square, with a green**}- in the centre, surrounded by several good houses. On one which formerly belonged to the Edens is inscribed, \" [16 \u25a0 I E \u25a0 96].\" To the west stands one of those large old halls or mansion-houses common in the south of the county of Durham, sup posed to have been built by the Rev. John Cradock, vicar of Gainford, whose family resided here. To the east a range of genteel buildings stretch along the undulating brow of the bank of the Tees, ancl front the south. Amongst the resident gentry may be named, Lowis Walton, Esq., a magis trate and deputy lieutenant of the county ; G. B. Wharton, Esq. ; Robert Ward, Esq., whose property here formerly belonged to the Shaftos of Whitworth ; Captain Stamp, R.

Balder-garth, which de rives its name from the unfortunate son of Odin, is a tract of waste land on the very ridge of Stanmore ; and a brook, which falls into tbe Tees near Barnard Castle, is named after the same deity. A field upon the banks of the Tees is also termed Woden-Croft, from the supreme deity of the Edda. Thorsgill is a beauti ful little brook and dell, running up behind the ruins of Eglistone Abbey. Thor was the Hercules of the Scandinavian mythology, a dreaded giant-queller, and in that capacity the champion of the gods, and the defender of Asgard, the northern Olympus, against the frequent attacks of the inhabitants of Jotunheim. There is an old poem in the Edda of Soemund, called the song of Thrym, which turns upon the loss and re covery of the Mace, or Hammer, which was Thor's principal weapon, and on which much of his power seems to bave depended. It may be read to great advantage in a version equally spirited and literal, amon\" the Miscellaneous Translations and Poems of the Honourable William Herbert.\" \u2014 Notes to Rokeby. + Several of the villages in this part of the county have large open spaces in their centres ; a disposition which adds much to their comfort and salubrity, as well as affording a proper place for the sports of child hood, the recreations of youth, and even the relaxations of old age.

The AVesleyan Methodists have a chapel here. Gainford is the residence of two surgeons, and contains three inns or public houses, with smiths, joiners, and other tradesmen ; and the township includes three or four farms and a corn-mill. -f In Grey's Notes it is remarked that Gainford castle was built by Bishop Beck ; but there are no remains, or even tradition of a castle here, though it is probable there was some fortress, where the powers and privileges of the honour were maintained. \u00a3 * Her mother was a maid of honour to Queen Charlotte, consort of George III. + John Cade, an industrious collector and antiquary, was born at Darlington in 1734. His parents were respectable, though of low condition ; and he received the rudiments of his education at the Free Grammar school in his native town. From school he was sent to a wholesale linen-draper in London, where he rose by honest industry from the lowest situation in the warehouse to the first in the counting-house ; after which he was admitted a partner in a branch of the concern at Dublin, where he made a small but competent for tune, and retired, about the year 1775, first to Durham, and afterwards to Gainford, devoting the subsequent part of his life, except a few of his last years, to antiquarian researches. After quitting business in the city, he amused himself in illustrating Bishop Gibson's edition of Camden's Britannia with all the topographical engravings of every kind that had fallen into his hands. From 1782 to 1784, he was in frequent corres pondence with Dr. Kaye and stir. Gough on Roman roads; a subject which led to an altercation with the historian Hutchinson. About 16 years before his death, be had a paralytic stroke, which deprived him of the use of his legs, and he was confined to his bed ever after. During that period, he was, nevertheless, cheerful, and conversed with pleasure on the topography and antiquities of the country. In 1788, he com municated to stir. Gough several corrections, by himself and stir. Allan, for the counties of Durham and York, in the new edition of Camden then publishing. In the same year, he favoured stir. Nicholls with \" Some Conjectures on the Formation of tbe Peat-Mosses in the Mountainous Parts of the Counties of Dur ham, Northumberland, Cumberland, &c, in which other analogous Circumstances are briefly mentioned,\" printed in the Gent. Mag. vol. lix. p. 967- That he was not a member of the Society of Antiquaries arose from his own diffidence and infirm state of health. He communicated to their Arch\u00e6ologia, however, seve ral valuable papers on different subjects. Some years before his death, he gave all his illustrated books on antiquities to the son of his early benefactor in trade ; but the Goth sold them in stir. Cade's life-time ! He latterly spent much of his time in reading sermons and other theological works. He died at Gainford, De cember 10, 1806, aged 72, and was buried at Darlington, stir. Allan says, \" He was charitable, hospitable, cheerful, and as good a man as I could have wished to have been acquainted with when young, or as I can desire to form an intimacy with as my age advances.\" He was never married ; but a maiden sister, who resided in his house, survived him, and died at Darlington in November, 1812. \u2014 Nichols' Lit.

Among many nations, the idea of putting into the grave, with the dead, utensils to which the party was much at tached, hath prevailed : in a grave was lately dug up a tobacco stopper, cut in boxwood, tipped with silver, marked I. t., a hand grasping a bible at the top. In the green were lately discovered, in a gravel pit, many human skulls, but no other bones ; probably the evidence of some dreadful decapitation, in the feudal ages, by the guillotine.\" \u2014 Hutchinson, vol. iii. p. 223. Mr. Cade mentions a rude-shaped stone coffin, with a circular cavity for the head, and containing a skull and some bones, discovered in digging a grave at Gainford. Part of an antique seal-ring was found in it, containing a green stone or flux, the intaglio a Cupid, with something like a hammer or pick-axe in his hand, raised against a festoon or olive-branch. Mr. Cade conjectures that this ring belonged to some of the lords of Raby, who might be interred here before the foundation of Stainthorp. vol. ii. 3 B"], [200, "DARLINGTON WARD.\u2014 S. W.

It probably needs but the sanction of fashion to be as much frequented as those places; and the attractions of the neighbouring scenery are certainly inferior to neither of them. The Church. Barnard Baliol, about 1159, gave the churches of Gainford, Castle Barnard, and Middleton in Teesdale, to the church of St. Mary in York, and to the monks there, with two oxgangs of land in Middleton, a toft, and a croft ; ancl it is noted in tbe grant, that the churches of Castle Barnard and Middleton were chapels in his father's time. After the dissolution, Gainford church was given to Trinity College, Cambridge ; and the vicar for the time being presents to the dependent chapels. The church is situated on the south side of the square. It consists of a nave with regular side aisles, a chancel, and a square western tower, in which is a clock and three bells. It is supported by pointed arches, springing from clustered columns. Tbe side-aisles are each formed by two lofty cylindrical pillars, supporting pointed arches ; and a pointed arch forms the entrance into the chancel. There are three lancet lights to the east, and two on the south side of the chancel. Two similar windows are closed up by the vestry on the north. There are two pointed windows in the south aisle; the rest are irregular. The chancel bears traces of much higher antiquity than the nave.

Henry Greswold, October 12, 1691, gave \u00a3100 to John Raine, Henry Eden, Cuthbert Swainston, and Cuthbert Raine, to be laid out in the purchase of lands or an annuity, the profits to be paid towards a yearly salary for the schoolmaster of Gainford, for teaching the poor children of the said parish. In January, 1804, the representatives of two of the obligors paid in \u00a325 each, which, together with \u00a339, 10s. 6d., an ancient poor stock, making \u00a389, 10s. 6d., was laid out in the purchase of \u00a3156, 0s. 3d. three per cent, consols, in the names of the Earl of Darlington and Robert Eden Duncombe Shafto, Esq. The remaining \u00a350 bad been paid before 1804, and is now invested on mortgage of the tolls of the turnpike road leading from Barnard Castle to Stockton, producing \u00a32, 10s. interest yearly. The schoolmaster receives this sum, and also \u00a32, 16s. 2d. as his proportion of the dividends of the stock in respect of the sum of \u00a350 belonging to the school. For this payment he instructs in reading, writing, and accounts, six children re commended by the churchwardens, from any part of the parish, exclusively of the chapelry of Barnard Castle.

Selaby Hall, an elegant mansion, is delightfully situated on an elevation to the north of the road leading from Gainford to Barnard Castle. Selaby was formerly the seat of the ancient family of Brackenbury, of whom Robert, second son of Sir AVilliam de Brackenbury, was appointed, with 30 others, February 4, 1342, to array all the defensible men in Darlington Ward to oppose the Scots. Sir Robert Brackenbury (familiar to the readers of Shakspeare) was appointed Lieutenant of the Tower, July 7, 1483, 1st King Richard III., removed 1st King Henry VII. Richard Brackenbury, a younger son of Anthony Brackenbury, of Selaby, was a gentleman-usher to Queen Elizabeth.

D., of Snow Hall, for 30 years engaged himself in the active du- ties of bis profession, with zeal and ability rarely surpassed. Not content with the ordinary routine of pro- fessional education, he had, during the early years of his life, applied himself with ardour to the study of Cullen, Gregory, and other eminent authors, until his theory and his practice thus combining and lending mutual aid to each other, he gradually acquired that confidence in himself which was ever after so fine a trait in his character, and by which be was enabled instinctively, as it were, to recognize latent disease, and to administer promptly either to its prevention or its cure. In cases of fracture of the skull, or other accidental or natural derangement of the head, he was eminently successful. One of these, in particular, deserves to be recorded. During his residence at Bishop-Auckland, a boy fell from a high wall, and beat upon his head. Dr. Sherwood, though altogether in despair of saving him, trepanned the boy, prolonged his life to this day, and was consulted on the extraordinary operation he had performed by almost every eminent practi- tioner in the kingdom. His classical education had been from circumstances limited ; but be gave signal proof, when in tbe society of those who had approached nearer to the \" integros fontes\" than himself, that be had afterwards traced them to their source, had tasted, and had drunk deeply too, of the thousand delightful rills which fall into the grand stream of poetry. Amidst his other active employments, be stole many an hour which he conse- crated to the history, the poetry, the biography of his own county. See Surtees's \"History of Durham,\" vol. i. p. 10, Introduction ; and judge of the man \" without the early and valued assistance of whom that work would never have been undertaken.\" But troubles came thick and throng upon him ; first through the perfidiousness of friends ; and, soon after, his daughter and his favourite son were taken from him within a few weeks of each other. His eldest daughter died on the 25th of October, 1829, aged 22. Elizabeth Sarah Sherwood was kind and affectionate upon the truest principle of filial duty ; and during her many and painful days upon her death-bed, her sinking mind was awed, and at the same time cheered, by intense feel- ings of unfeigned religion. Ralph Sherwood, son of Dr. Sherwood, was born April 3, 1798, and received a liberal education at AVit- ton-le-Wear. He was destined for the medical profession ; and with this view he studied for a while in London, and was afterwards removed to Edinburgh, where he studied anatomy under the late James AVilson, Esq., at St. George's Hospital. Here his quickness and talent, his great attention to anatomical and surgical pursuits, and the accuracy of his pencil and pen in sketching off-hand, in the hospitals to which he had access, those various morbid and other appearances produced bv nature or the hand of the operator, soon gained for him the notice and approbation of men whose lightest word was praise. During his abode in Edinburgh, stir. Sherwood became possessed of five very amusing letters written by stir. Ritson to stir. Laing, which, with a portrait of their author etched by himself, he communicated to stir. Nichols, who inserted them in the third volume of \"Literary Illustrations ofthe Eighteenth Century,\" p. 775, &c. Mr. Sherwood bad, how- ever, imbibed a love for the stage while in London ; and at Edinburgh he formed an intimacy with Mr. Yates, now of the Adelphi, who had then newly entered into the profession. This friendship increased his dramatic ardour; and a subsequent acquaintance with Mr. J. Russell served to confirm it. He bad, at this time, some difference with his father, on account of his expensive habits; and at length, in July, 1818, he made his first appearance on the stage at York, as Dandie Dinmont, in Guy Mannering. Under the assumed name of Sherwin, he continued to perform with the A'ork company, sustaining the countrymen, Scotchmen, and sailors with success. His Tyke, in particular, was much admired. It is said that at this time he was visited bv an uncle, a physician, who had returned from the East Indies with an independent fortune, and who, after expostulating with him on the profession he bad chosen, offered to be at the expense of finishing his medical education, and sending him out to the same situation which he himself had occupied. The reply of Ralph will be considered by some as evincing independence, and by others as displaying petulence : \" It is my father's duty to do all this for me ; and I will not receive the obligation from any other person.\" He afterwards joined the Litchfield and Birmingham company ; and when the disastrous fire occurred at tbe latter theatre, he lost all his theatrical properties in the conflagration ; an occurrence sufficiently unpleasant to a metropolitan, but peculiarly afflicting to a provincial performer. The minor theatre at Birmingham was opened for the benefit of the sufferers by the fire ; and the humanity of the \" hardware folks\" may be sur mised from the fact, that Ralph shared only seven shillings and four-pence, after performing three nights.' He, however, realized a considerable sum by a solo performance at Litchfield ; and, soon after, he was en gaged at tbe Brighton theatre, where he was first seen by Emery, who afterwards said, on his death-bed, \" AVhen I'm gone, Ralph, of all the actors I know, is most likely to supply my place.\" Surfeited at length vol. ii. 2 C"], [204, "DARLINGTON WARD.\u2014 S. AV. D. 188 Piercebridge, A village and township, 5 miles westby-north from Darlington, derives its name from a bridge of three arches, which here crosses the Tees to Cliffe* The village includes an open green, through which the road passes to the bridge. The houses are mostly cottages. Here are two schools, and four inns and public houses ; and the township contains five farmsteads and a corn-mill. Pierce bridge is a parcel of the honour of Barnard Castle, and was resigned by the first bishop of Durham with itinerant acting, Mr. Sherwin sought and obtained his father's forgiveness, and was received under the paternal roof. It is probable he would now have relinquished the stage altogether ; but, on the death of Emery, he again felt \" his soul in arms and eager for the fray ;\" his \"truant disposition\" returned, he abruptly left bis father's bouse, and repaired to London. After some difficulty, the doors of Drury were opened to him, through the mediation of the late stir. Oxberry ; and he appeared on February 14, 1823, in his favourite character of Dandie Dinmont. The result was an immediate engagement for three years, at \u00a37, \u00a38, and \u00a39 per week. Here he performed Paddock, in My Spouse and I ; Giles, in The Miller's Maid ; Donald, in The Falls of Clyde ; Robin, in No Song no Supper ; and some other characters of minor import; in all of which he well supported his theatrical reputation. A contemporary biographer describes him as follows : \" In person, Mr. Sherwin is five feet nine inches in height, very stoutly made (which our country readers will readily believe when he states bis weight to be fourteen stone), with black eyes, jet black hair, and a florid complexion ; his countenance is peculiarly handsome and intelligent, and bears the impress of good hu mour, the most valuable imprint Nature ever gave to a comedian's face. His general appearance partakes so much of the gentleman farmer (perhaps with rather more of the latter than the former), that it is difficult to conceive how he could adapt himself to any other line of characters than those pourtrayed by the late Emery. In private life he is unassuming, intelligent, and polite ; a determined bon vivant ; and though, probably, rather more devoted to the jolly god than prudence might suggest, never infringing on the decencies of society by his irregularities. His vocal pretensions are extremely moderate, his voice being a barritone of small com pass ; he sings the little allotted to him respectably, and in society compensates by the humour of his manner for any defect of bis glottis.\" His constitution, however, seems to have been injured ; and, having slept in a damp bed at Cambridge, he never recovered the effects of it. His dying sister, above mentioned, now be sought her father, as a last request, to be reconciled to Ralph, which, after some hesitation, be promised ; and his son was suffered to come home to die. The full and free condonation of what was past, and the pleasu rable intercourse and conversation between father and son, \u2014 as far as the grief of the former for the death of his danghter, and the deeply rooted disease of the latter, would permit, \u2014 will not be soon forgotten by those who witnessed them both. Overcome by the gloom which, from all sides, lowered around him, the unhappy father would talk incohe rently of his lost daughter from morning till night ; and he would sit gazing, with a vacant, glassy eye, upon a picture of his son in one of his characters. He was forlorn and blighted \u2014 reason reeled on her seat \u2014 she received not from him that \" sweet oblivious antidote\" so often administered to others \u2014 the conflict was over, and he hurried into eternity.

Leland says, \" Persebridge, sumtime of five arches, but a late made new of three arches. There is a prati chapel of our lady, hard by Persebridge, of the foundation of John Bailiol, king of Scottes.\" Probably the above was the bridge referred to. \" In the old map of the North Riding of Yorkshire,\" says Gibson in his Camden, \" it is called Presbrigge, and, according to tradition, should be called Priestbridge, from two nei<-*h bours of that order, who built it of stone, it having been of wood before; or from the priests appointed to serve the devotion of travellers, as well as in the neighbourhood of a chapel, the ruins of which remain hard by the bridge.\" This chapel, of which no traces now remain, was dedicated to St. Mary ; and there was a chantry in it, with A2, 2s. 4d. salary annexed to it.

A great part of the vallum remained here till about two years ago, when it was demolished, and the stones used in the erection of some cottages, with the excep- tion of a few that retained fragments of inscriptions, and which were removed to the repository of the Antiquarian Society of Durham. A considerable portion of the mound or enclosure is still vi- sible. The annexed inscription on an altar found here is given in Camden ; and it is added, \" The distinct mention of Condati would tempt us at first sight to be- d + in lieve that this was the ancient Condate, placed hitherto at Congleton in Cheshire; but the course of the Itinerary, and the distance on each hand, will by no means c o n d a t i give us leave to remove it from thence, and much less to bring it into this county.\" attonivs In the Britannia Romana, p. 296, it is rendered, \" Dis manibus.

The line in the hase I have ventured to read e.v jussu susceptum solvit libenti animo, because it was common for them to pretend that they took a vow upon them by the command or order of some deity.\" In the year 1749, a fragment of a Roman inscription was dug up at Carlebury, and transcribed by Dr. Hunter, but was so mutilated as to afford no reading. A great many coins, urns, a stone coffin, and many other antiquities, have been found here. An instance is given in Camden of an idol, which the person into whose hands it fell, through an excess of zeal, caused to be crushed to pieces. In the Arch\u00e6ologia is given an engraving of a small brass figure of Mercury, communicated by Mr. Cade, and said to have been found here. On December 2, 1642, the Earl of Newcastle, on his march towards York, was opposed for se- veral hours at Piercebridge by Captain Hotham, with a small party of Fairfax's horse and two pieces of cannon. The Royalists erected a battery on Carlebury hills, the Parliamentarians on Cliffe banks. Rushworth says, \"The Earl of Newcastle did overpower the Lord Fairfax's force with great cannon.\" In this skirmish, Colonel Thomas Howard, of Tursdale, (son of Lord Wil- liam Howard,) was killed, with several other officers of the royal party. The earl, after forcing the passage, continued his march to York ; while Hotham retreated to Lord Fairfax's quarters at Tadcaster.

By Hatfield's Survey, the tenants of Bolam paid to the farmer of Midridge-Grange for liberty to water their cattle at Wydhope stream. The De la Poles formerly held a large estate here. An inquisition taken on the death of Ralph Earl of Westmoreland states that he held 40 acres of land in Bolam of the Earl of AVarwick.

He was admitted a member ofthe col lege of pbvsicians on June 26, 1692, and soon attained the first rank in bis profession. He was a zealous AVhig ; and bis companionable talents, and proficiency in polite literature, acquired him patrons of great rank and influence. A division which arose among the members of the medical profession, on the subject of the establishment ofa dispensary for the poor ofthe metropolis, induced Dr. Garth, who espoused the measure, to compose his mock-heroic poem, \" The Dispensary.\" It was first published in 1694, and being widely read and admired, materially contributed to the fame of the author. In a few months it passed through three editions, in consequence of which he afterwards made many additions and corrections; and, in 1706, he pub lished a sixth edition, with several descriptions and episodes not before printed. In 1697, he composed and printed bis \" Harveian Oration,\" which was much extolled for its latinity. In this oration be ridiculed the multifarious classes of quacks with a just spirit and inimitable humour. Although a party man, he was al ways ready to benefit men of merit on every side, and hence was an early encourager of Pope. In 1710, he addressed a copy of verses to Lord Godolpbin on his dismissal, and displayed bis attachment to the House of Hanover by an elegant Latin dedication of an intended version of Lucretius to the Elector, afterwards George I. On the accession of the latter, he received the honour of knighthood, the ceremony being performed with the Duke of Marlborough's sword ; and he was appointed physician in ordinary to the king, and physician general to the army. He is said to have had a very extensive practice, in which he conducted himself with great moderation as to his views of pecuniary reward, and with a strict regard to the honour and interests of the profession. He died in the height both of medical and literary reputation, January 18, 1718, and was buried in the church of Harrow on the 22d. Sir Samuel Garth has left no work behind him directly profes sional, and indeed appears to have been too much addicted to conviviality and elegant literature to pay much attention to science. He was a distinguished member of the Kit-Kat Club, which was instituted in 1703, with the design of supporting a warm zeal for the Protestant succession of the House of Hanover, and con sisted of about 30 noblemen and gentlemen of talent.

Next to \" The Dispensary,\" his \" Claremont,\" a complimentary poem on tbe seat of the Duke of Newcastle is bis most elaborate production.

AV. D. 192 Staindrop. Staindrop (from Stainthorp, a stony village) is a place of considerable antiquity, being of greas importance in the time of Canute, who, in veneration of St. Cuthbert, gave his mansion-house in this town, with its appendages, as an offering at the holy shrine. Symeon, and other authors who notice this transaction, say the appendages consisted of Cnapton (supposed to be Snotterton), Shot ton, Raby, Wackerfield, Evenwood, Aycliffe, Lutrington, Eldon, Ingleton, Thickley, and Middle ton or stiidleston; but, as several of these places lie at a considerable distance, it is doubtful whether they were ever appendages to Staindrop, though they were the property of Canute. Bishop Flambard looked with eyes of jealousy upon the extensive territory which the convent of Durham held by the royal gift, and seized the dominion of Staindropshire ; but, on the approach of his dissolution, he restored it to the monastery; and it was shortly afterwards, in 1131, granted by Prior Algar to Dolphin, a descendant of Uchtred, to be holden of him in capite, under the yearly rent of \u00a34. It would appear, however, that the convent bad made a reservation of the church in this grant. After the marriage ofthe son of Dolphin, Robert surnamed Fitz-Meldred, with the heiress of Neville, his posterity assumed the latter name. Bishop Hatfield, by his licence, dated the 24th of January, 1378, empowered Ralph Neville,, Earl of Westmoreland, to erect and found a college in Staindrop ; for the perpetual maintenance of which, the earl gave and assigned two messuages and twelve acres of land, with their appurte nances, at Staindrop, for the habitation of the master, clerks, and poor persons, together with the advowson of the church of Latham, in Lancashire, which was a cell to Durham ; and Brigham church, in Cumberland, was also appropriated to this college, to augment its revenue. Leland, in his Itinerary, vol. i. pages in allusion to the Nevilles and this college, says, \" Johan (Ralph's second wife) erected the very house itself of the college of Staindrop ; it is set on the north side of the collegiate church, and it is strongly buildid al of stone.\" In Tanner's Notitia, page 116, it is described as \"a college for a master or warden, six priests, six clerks, six decayed gentlemen, six poor officers, and other poor men, to the honour of the Arirgin Mary. It was endowed at tbe Dis solution with \u00a3170, 4s. 6d. per ann. in the whole, and \u00a3\"126, 5s. lOd. clear.\" From the bishop's register, however, it appears that this foundation was more liberal than is here stated ; being, as is therein asserted, instituted for the perpetual support of a custos, eight chaplains, four secular clerks, six esquires, six gentlemen, and six other persons; bat the licence does not restrain the founder to numbers, or their quality ; and it is probable, as conjectured by Hutchinson, that the earl intended this house for the reception of his military retainers, or those servants more immedi ately about his person, sex valectorum, who should be reduced by misfortunes, or otherwise dis abled.

They have long been disused ; but the market was revived some years ago, much to the benefit of the town."], [209, "STAINDROP. 193 Staindrop consists principally of one wide street, of above half a mile in length, through which passes the road from Durham to Barnard Castle. The Staindrop Beck* runs near the north side of the town.

There is also a subscription news-room at the Queen's Head. Several grocers, drapers, shopkeepers, tailors, dress-makers, boot and shoe makers, joiners, smiths, &c, carry on business here; and there is acorn-mill in the township. The stalls for the market are rude, but substantial erections, and stand in an open space in the street. One or more of the following magistrates attend at the Queen's Head on alternate Satur days, for the administration of justice, viz. John Trotter, Esq., of Staindrop; the Rev. J. AV. D. Merest, vicar ; and Lowis AValton, Esq., of Gainford.j The Church. Staindrop church stands at the east end of the town. It is a spacious and stately structure, consisting of a tower, a nave and regular side-aisles, and a chancel. Leland says, \" I hard that afore Rase of Raby time, ther was that alonly that now is the south isle.\" This appears the more probable from the circumstance that the arches of the south aisle are adorned with the zigzag or nament, which those of the north aisle want. There are four circular arches on each side of the nave, and lofty pointed arches support the tower. A pointed arch also separates the nave and chancel. Within the altar-rails, in the south wall, are three niches or stalls for the officiating priests. The altar-table and the stalls of the chancel are of oak. The mullions of the east window form three successive tiers of pointed arches under a low circular arch ; and it contains the arms of England ancl of the Nevilles in stained glass. There are also three large windows under pointed arches on the south side of the chancel, and two on the north. The windows of the side-aisles are under low circular arches ; and there are three lancet lights in a recess to the north. A gallery extends over the north aisle. In 1787, the Honourable Raby Vane made the parish a present of six bells, cast for the purpose in London ; and the Right Honourable the Earl of Darlington pre sented the church with an excellent organ, the organist of which was also appointed and paid by him. Monuments. \u2014 Leland's account of the monuments in this church is as follows: \u2014 \"In this south isle, as I hard, was buried the grauntfather and grandedam of Rase Raby, and they made a can tuarie there. In the waule of this isle appere the tumbes and images of three ladys, wherof one hath a crounet, and a tumbe of a man childe, and a flat tumbe varii marmoris.

The sides and ends of this beautiful monument are ornamented with delicate tabernacle work, representing pointed arches. The effigy of the earl represents him in complete armour, except the head, which rests on a helmet, bearing the family crest, a bull's bead ; the hands are elevated, in gauntlets ; on the breast a cross ; the legs are extended, spurs on the heels, and the feet resting on a lion. The heads of the countesses rest on cushions, supported by cherubs ; and at the feet of each figure is a desk, with two kneeling clerks. Tbe whole of the figures are executed with great freedom and elegance.* Adjoining to the above stands the monument of Henry, tbe fifth Earl of Westmoreland, and his three wives. It is of wood, and supports three wooden recumbent figures. The earl is represented in armour, with a curled head and pointed beard, the hands elevated without gauntlets, the legs extended, and the feet resting on a greyhound. The hands of the two countesses are elevated, and their dresses are without ornament and stiffly executed.

There are two arches in the wall of the south aisle, one of which appears to have been con structed for a superior personage, being ornamented with tabernacle work, at the summit of which is a bracket, as if designed to support a small crucifix or image, with a lamp or light. Under this are preserved two recumbent effigies of stone, apparently of females. A canopy is sculptured over the head of one of them, which is probably the coronet mentioned by Leland, as there is now no figure to be found with the latter ornament. In this wall is another circular arch, but without ornament above it ; and bere is another recumbent female effigy, and that of a child laid by it. Ararious figures of lions, Sec., on which the feet of some of the effigies have formerly rested, are deposited with them in these recesses, which are now covered over by the wood- work of the pews. In 1343 Ralph de Neville obtained licence from Prior Fossour and the convent for founding three chantries in this church ; and it is probable the south aisle was originally a porch for this purpose. * Ever since the commencement of the war against images at the Reformation, it has been a disgraceful characteristic of the people of this country, that they appear to be actuated by a propensity to injure and destroy every specimen of art or antiquity which comes within their reach ; an impulse which even the idea of sanctity connected with our churches cannot always counteract. The heads of the cherubs and clerks on the splendid monument above described have long been broken off; and it is scratched in several places with the initials of those whose perverted ambition has prompted them thus to hand down their names to posterity as its defacers."], [211, "STAINDROP. 195 Near the tombs of the Nevilles is a beautiful mural monument of marble, with an excellent bust t>f John Lee, Esq., M.

The tithes of the whole parish are vested in the Duke of Cleveland. Two small fields or closes are attached to the living as glebe. The Friends' Meeting-house in Staindrop was erected on the demolition of the village of Raby, where they had previously possessed a place of worship. About sixteen years ago, the Wesleyan Methodists purchased a house on the south side of the street, which they converted into a chapel, containino* sitting-room for about 150 persons. A well-attended Sunday-school is now attached to it. On May 30, 1827, a neat and commodious chapel, belonging to the Independent Calvinists, was opened at Staindrop, ajicl will seat about 350 hearers. The Rev. S. Jackson has continued to officiate as minister since its opening. The Poor-rates of the township of Staindrop, in 1816, amounted to .\u00a3571, 18s.; in 1818, to \u00a3686, 7s. ; in 1820, to =\u00a3787, 7s. ; but, in the following year, they are stated at but =\u00a3'353, 15s. At present, the rate is collected once in twelve weeks ; the fixed sum being i?136 at each collection. Charities. School. \u2014 John Grainger, by will, in 1/10, gave \u00a3300 for teaching 30 poor children of Staindrop. This sum is in the hands of Thomas Papilion, Esq., of Acrise, near Folkestone, by whom the sum of \u00a315 yearly, as the interest at five per cent., is regularly transmitted to the trustee for the use of a schoolmaster, who in structs 30 children of Staindrop in reading, writing, and accounts, without any charge. There being no public school or school-house in the parish, the children are taught in a house provided by the master. Sunday-school. \u2014 A Sunday-school was established for the poor children of this parish, about 50 years ago, by the subscription of the late Earl of Darlington, Mrs. Raby A*\"ane, and other individuals.

The master receives a salary of \u00a36, 6s. a year, and the rest of the income is applied principally in purchasing books and rewards for the children. Brabant's Charity. \u2014 Hercules Brabant, by will, April 22, 1612, gave a yearly rent of 20s. out of his lands at Redworth, to the vicar and churchwardens of Staindrop, to be distributed by them and their successors to 20 of the most aged and impotent poor people of that parish. He also gave two sums of 20s. to the pa rishes of Brancepeth and Heighington ; and he directed that if the \u00a33, or any part thereof, should not be regularly paid, for every month's non-payment he charged the said land with the payment of 10s. for the same uses. The sum of 19s. is received in respect of this charity by the churchwardens, at Easter, from the tenant of lands at Redworth, belonging to Robert Surtees, Esq. ; ls. is deducted for land-tax. This money is carried to the general charity account, and given away in tbe manner hereafter mentioned. Poor's Lands. \u2014 The following parcels of land have for a great length of time been let by the minister, churchwardens, and twenty-four for the time being, and tbe rents have been applied for charitable purposes in the parish ; but it is not known from whom any part of the lands were derived. 1. A field, containing about 3 acres, called the Lee Close, let at the yearly rent of \u00a310, 10s. 2. About 7 acres of land, called the Ackwards, let at the yearly rent of \u00a334. 3. A garden, containing about three-quarters of an acre, let at the yearly rent of \u00a37, 14s. 6d. 4. An allotment, called tbe Moor Butts, set out upon the inclosure of Staindrop Moor, in 1764, to John Brownless, the churchwarden, in trust for the poor, in respect of their ancient lands. This allotment contains 2h acres, and is let at the yearly rent of \u00a314, 15s. A small parcel of land was also sold in 1826 ; and \u00a332, 5s. 7d., the produce of the sale, is placed in a bank in Darlington. The rents above mentioned, with 19s. received in respect of Brabant's charity, making altogether \u00a367, 18s. 0d., form one fund, which is divided into 20 parts, as follow : \u2014 For Staindrop township, 7 ; Raby township, 5 ; East Quarter (which contains AVackerfield, Hilton, and Ingleton), 4 ; and Langley Dale and Shotton, 4. The share appropriated to the township of Staindrop is distributed soon after Easter, by the churchwardens, with the minister, chiefly to poor widows, and other poor persons not receiving parochial relief, in sums vary ing from 5s. to 10s. each. In Raby, it is distributed in like manner, in sums varying from 8s. to 30s. The four parts appropriated to the east quarter are again subdivided between the townships of Ingleton, Wacker field, and Hilton, the former receiving two-fifths, and the two latter three-fifths between them ; and these several shares are distributed amongst such poor of the respective townships above mentioned as are selected by the inhabitants, in sums varying from 5s. to 25s. In Langley Dale and .Shotton it is given away in a similar manner, in sums varying from 10s. to \u00a32. Township of Staindrop. \u2014 John Simpson, by will, April 5, 1680, left to his wife, Ann Simpson, all his lands in Staindrop, subject to the annual payment of 20s., to be paid to the minister, churchwardens, and overseers of Staindrop, for the putting out poor children apprentices, or to be distributed at their discretion amongst poor widows and fatherless children in Staindrop. The property was divided before 1794; and 14.5., part ofthe rent-charge, is now paid by the Duke of Cleveland's steward, as charged upon property be longing to his grace ; 4s. is paid by John Hodgson, shoemaker, in Staindrop, as charged upon a house belong ing to him ; and 2s. is paid by Sliss Lee, of Staindrop. The whole is generally applied towards putting out a child of the township of Staindrop apprentice, or in supplying clothing for such child when bound out. Snotterton, about a mile west from Staindrop, was anciently a manor, though it now contains but an old mansion-house. It is supposed to have been one of the places resigned to the Earls of Northumberland, was afterwards successively the property of the Nevilles and Bainbriggs, and was subsequently annexed by purchase to the possessions of the late Earl of Darlington. Raby and Keverstone Is a township containing a number of scattered farm-houses, a small hamlet of cottages, ancl Raby Castle, with its extensive and beautiful park. Raby was formerly a considerable villao*e, but was pulled down many years ago, for the improvement of the park and the road near the castle. That part of the township called Keverstone is an elevated piece of ground, which commands a wide view over a delightful valley to the east. Keverstone Hall is the residence of Thomas Fleshfield Scarth, Esq., land-agent to the Duke of Cleveland.

Raby Castle. This \" noble pile of stately towers, retaining all the appearance of antiquity, and givino* the most perfect idea of a great baron's palace in feudal ages,\"* is situated one mile north from Staindrop. It stands on a rocky eminence, surrounded with a parapet and embrazured wall, together with a deep fosse ; and here, it is supposed, anciently stood Canute's mansion, which he gave to the church of Durham, along with Staindrop and its other appendages. The present edifice is, however, principally indebted for its splendour to John de Neville, who, in 1379, obtained a licence to \" make a castle of bis manor of Raby, and to embattle and crenelate its towers \" &c. Mr. Grose says this castle, \" with its nearly circular terraces, enclosed within a military wall, is said to measure two acres, and the demesnes annexed to exceed thirty miles in length.\" It is a massive Gothic structure, uninjured in its pristine appearance, all the modern repairs and addi- tions being made in unison with the general taste of the edifice. The south front is very beautiful, and the style and proportion of its windows are truly elegant ; but the east front, with its lofty embatted towers and arched gateway, and extending to an immense length, presents tbe most im posing and warlike appearance. There is but one entrance into the outward area of the castle, by a gate on the north side, guarded by two square to*- ers, and flanked with a parapet, ornamented with turrets; but there are two entrances from thence into the inner area, one of which was opened by the late Earl of Darlington ;\u2022*(\u2022 and the other is an ancient one from the west, with a double gate and covered way strengthened by two square towers, from whence a portcullis was, in times of danger, let down before each gate. This gateway, at irregular distances, is flanked with square towers ; and from one of them, on the north, a hanging gallery forms a communication with tbe large square bulwark now called Clifford's Tower, from which another gallery extends eastward to a smaller tower, gar nished with turrets ; and from thence, on the east, is a modern curtain wall, which conceals a re cess, and adjoins the other gateway, where carriages pass into a large Gothic saloon, under the * Leland says, \" Raby is the largest castel of loggingees in all the north countery, and is of a strong build ing, but not set other on hill, or verv strong ground.

The rooms are very numerous, and more modern in their disposition and proportions than might have been expected within tbe strong embattled walls of so ancient a building ; but by means of numerous passages and closets, many of which have been scooped out of the walls, and back staircases, the apartments are extremely convenient, well connected, and at the same time perfectly distinct. One of the drawing-rooms is 30 feet by 20, and the adjoining dining-room is 51 feet by 21, with plate glass windows, set in light brass frames. The great hall, or \" rendezvous apartment,\" is 120 feet long by 36 broad, being lengthened 30 feet about 50 years ago, and terminated by a circular tower. \" Here assem bled, in the time of the Nevilles, 700 knights who held of that family.\"* The west end of this room is crossed by a gallery, which in ancient times was used \"for music, and that mimicry with which our ancestors were so much pleased.\" The different towers are supposed to have received their names from the distinguished persons to whom, during the periods of civil war and Scottish incursions, they were consigned to be defended or garrisoned. There are many good paintings in the castle. In the dining-room in Clifford's Tower is a large music-piece, containing the group of figures which Rubens placed in the centre of the marriage-feast of Cana, in which he disposed his own portrait as a chief musician, with his contemporaries as performers. There are also in this room, and in other parts of the castle, many excellent portraits of personages connected with the present family. The situation of the castle is rather pastoral than romantic, being on the side of a vast amphi theatre of country-, which affords a prospect of rich cultivation, terminated on the east and west by distant hills, and to the south by an extended plain, exhibiting that freedom now so generally adopted in rural speculations. On the other hand, the nearer parts of the horizon are beautifully verged by plantations raised by the late Lord Darlington, who, in every part of his extensive pro perty, gave the highest proof of his attention and taste. \" Although the surrounding country boasts not much of tbe marvellous and sublime in nature, yet the deficiency of such objects seems amply supplied in another style, by the growing elegance of every reform, where convenience, profit, and order, are happily blended.\" There are several approaches to the castle, viz. one for domestics, another leading to the Darlington road, a third from Staindrop bridge, and a fourth from the Durham road, near Keverston Hall.

Geoffrey, his son and heir, took the surname of Neville, ancl left two sons, Robert and Geoffrey, from the latter of whom descended the Nevilles of Hornby. Robert, the elder, accompanied King John into France, and was afterwards governor of the castles of Norham, Wark, ancl Bambrough, warden of all the king's forests beyond Trent, sheriff of Yorkshire, and governor of York castle. Though, at one time, he joined the rebellious barons against King Henry III.,* yet he was restored to favour, and died 10 Edward I., leaving Ranulph, his grand- son, his heir, who also inherited from his mother the lordship of Middleham in Yorkshires Ranulph de Neville was one of those who fomented the disputes between Bishop Beck ancl the people of Durham, touching the right of the bishop to order them to the wars in Scotland ; and he soon after quarrelled with the prior of Durham, respecting the offering of a stag every year upon St. Cuthbert's day, by which service, and a yearly rent of \u00a31, he held Raby with the eight adjoining townships.^ He afterwards accompanied Edward II. into Scotland, and died April 18, 1331. He is said to have paid little attention to secular affairs, but spent much of his time in conversation with the canons of Merton and Coverham, to whom he bequeathed considerable pro perty ; and it is added that he committed incest with his own daughter, for which Bishop Kellaw compelled him to do public penance. He had two sons by his first wife, viz. Robert, commonly called The Peacock ofthe North, who died in his father's life-time; and Ralph, who consequently became his heir.

It afterwards came into the possession of Henry Lacy, Earl of Lincoln, and hence acquired tbe name of Lincoln's Inn. Bishop Ne ville was elected archbishop of Canterbury by the monks, and confirmed by King Henry ; but, aware of the jealousy with which he was regarded by the Pope, who supposed him likely to interfere with the payment of the tribute promised to the court of Rome by King John, he gave no reward for their good tidings to the two monks who brought him the news, nor would allow any thing towards discharging their costly journey to Rome. The event, indeed, justified his anticipations, the Pope refusing his assent to the election ; and on a future occasion, when elected bishop of Winchester, his promotion was obstructed by the king. He built a chapel, dedicated to St. Michael, without the east gate of Chichester, and died at London in 1244. \u2014 Fuller's Worthies. t Dugdale relates that Robert, son of Robert de Neville, and father of Ranulph mentioned above, fre quented tbe company of a certain lady in Craven, in an adulterous manner ; and, being surprised by some of her husband's friends, was by them so mutilated that he died of the wound, June 6, 1271, and was buried at Coverham, co.

His body was brought in a chariot drawn by seven horses into the bounds of the church-yard, and then carried upon the shoulders of knights into the middle of the church, where the abbot of St. Mary's in A'ork (in consequence of the bishop's absence, and the impotency of the prior) performed tbe office of tbe dead, and celebrated the morrow mass, at which were offered eight horses viz. four for the war, with four men armed, and all their harness and habilaments; and four for peace; and also three cloths of blue and gold. Four of the horses, however, were redeemed after the funeral, by John de Neville, son ofthe deceased, for 100 marks. Alice, his widow, sent to the sacrist 120 pounds in silver, to be employed in the repairs of the cathedral ; and also, for celebrating his anniversary, one vestment, two tunicles, one cope, three albs, three stoles, four maniples of black satin, and another embroidered vestment to be used at tbe celebration of the sacrament. t Alexander, third son of Ralph Lord Neville, was born at Raby, and became first canon and then arch bishop of York, where he beautified and strengthened the castle of Cawood. Being much in favour with Richard II., the enemies of that king designed to imprison the archbishop in Rochester Castle; but he tied for protection to Pope Urban at Rome, \" who partly out of pity (that he might have something for his sup port), and more out of policy (that York might be in his own disposal upon the removal of this archbishop), translated him to St. Andrew's in Scotland, and so dismissed him with bis benediction.\" This translation' however, was by no means agreeable to the applicant ; as the archbishoprick of St. Andrew's was inferior to that of A^ork in honour and revenue ; and, besides, tbe Scots, looking at that time with jealousy on all Eng lishmen, could not but be particularly opposed to one of the family of Neville, so active in the wars ao-ainst them. \" Indeed,\" says Fuller, \" half a loaf is better than no bread ; but this his new translation was rather a stone than half a loaf, not filling his belly, yet breaking his teeth, if feeding thereon.

Dugdale mentions but two wives : Jane, daughter of the Earl of Rutland ; and Margaret, daughter of Sir Richard Cholmley. t There had, not long before, been a secret negotiation entered into between some of the Scottish and English nobility, to bring about a marriage between Mary Queen of Scots, at that time a prisoner in Eng- land, and the Duke of Norfolk, a nobleman of excellent character, and firmly attached to tbe Protestant re- ligion. This match was proposed to all the most considerable of the English nobility, and, amongst the rest, to tbe Earls of AVestmoreland and Northumberland. As it seemed to promise a speedy and safe conclusion to the troubles in Scotland, with many advantages to the crown of England, they all consented to it, provided it should prove agreeable to Queen Elizabeth. The Earl of Leicester (Elizabeth's favourite) undertook to break the matter to her; but before be could find an opportunity, the affair had come to her ears by other means. The intelligence threw her into a violent fury; \"like a royall queene shee swore\" to be revenged ; and the Duke of Norfolk, with several of his friends, was committed to the Tower. During the month of October, an unusual ferment was visible in the counties of York, Durham, and Northumberland; and the court was repeatedly alarmed with rumours of rebellion, which could never be traced to any authentic source. The Earl of Sussex communicated tbe information to the Earls of Northumberland and Westmoreland, and was satisfied with the apparent loyalty and sincerity of their answers. In a few days his suspicions revived : they were confirmed by the refusal of the two lords to obey his invitation to York. Still Northumberland balanced between the danger to himself, and bis secret engagement to Mary : but he was suddenly awakened from his irresolution, by a real or feigned alarm in the dead of the night, that an armed force was on its march to apprehend him at Topcliffe. He rose, and repaired in haste to the castle of Brancepeth, where the Earl of AVestmoreland, notwithstanding the entreaties of Norfolk (who' was bis wife's brother), had already called around him some hundreds of his friends and tenants. The next day, the banner of insurrection was unfurled. The real object of the insurgents was to march to Tutbury, to liberate tbe queen of Scots, and to extort from Elizabeth a declaration that Mary was next heir to the throne. But, to increase their numbers, they addressed a proclamation to all persons professing the Catholic faith, calling on them to unite in this attempt to redress the national grievances, restore the ancient worship, and protect from ruin the old nobility of the realm. As the insurgents advanced, they burnt the Bible and the Book of Common Prayer in the cathedral of Durham, and re-established the mass at Rippon. Their standard represented the Saviour, with blood streaming from his wounds, and was borne by Richard Norton, of Norton-Conyers, Esq., an aged gentleman, whose grey locks and enthusiastic air aroused the feelings and commanded the respect of the beholders. On Clifford Moor they mustered their forces, and held a council of war ; when, not finding themselves supported by the Catholics, they abandoned their design of liberating tbe queen of Scots, and with 7000 men hastened back to Raby Castle. This sudden retreat compelled Sir George Bowes, the commander ofthe royalists, to throw himself into Barnard Castle, which surrendered at the end of ten days. In the interval, the two earls had taken possession of Hartlepool, to open a communication with the Spanish Netherlands ; and had dis patched messengers into different counties, to solicit aid from the noblemen and gentlemen distinguished by their attachment to the ancient faith, or known to abet tbe cause of the queen of Scots. In their new ma nifesto, they no longer talked of the reformation of religion, but of the necessity of determining the succes sion to the crown. The two earls, however, who spent their large estates in hospitality, and were extremely beloved on that account, were masters of little ready money ; the Earl of Northumberland bringing with him only 8000 crowns, and the Earl of AVestmoreland nothing at all for the subsistence of their forces. In these circumstances, AVestmoreland began so visibly to despond, that many of his men slunk away ; though North umberland still kept up his resolution, and was master of the field till December 13 ; when the Earl of Sus sex, accompanied with Lord Hunsdon and others, having marched out of York at the head of 3000 men, and the Earl of AVarwick following with 12,000, the insurgents retreated from Brancepeth to Hexham.

He afterwards passed to the Netherlands, where the king of Spain allowed him a slender pension ; and he died in exile in 1584, at a great age, and the title became extinct.* Though Bishop Pilkington endeavoured, soon after the rebellion, to re-establish the right of the see, by claiming the forfeited estates of Westmoreland in the county palatine, the act of attainder, passed in the 13th year of Elizabeth, provided that, \" for that time,\" all the forfeited lands and goods should pass to the queen and her successors. King James I. caused an inquisition to be taken of the manor and castle of Raby, with their appendages ; and they passed by grant to cer tain citizens of London, in trust, to be sold, under which they were purchased by Sir Henry A-'ane, Knt.,-f- who was, in 1631, ambassador to the states of Denmark, Sweden, Holland, and Bohemia, comptroller of the king's household, and a privy counsellor ; and, in 1639, he was secretary of state and treasurer of the household. King Charles I., on his progress to Scotland, in May, 1633, was entertained at Raby Castle by Sir Henry Vane ; and on April 29, 1639, that monarch again visited Raby, on his march against the Scottish covenanters. Sir Henry, however, during the civil wars, took part with the parliament. In 1645, this castle was taken by a daring coup-de-main ;\\ across the Borders into Liddesdale, escorted by their allies, 300 Scottish horse, the partizans of Mary. Though this insurrection bad been suppressed with so little bloodshed, the Earl of Sussex and Sir George Bowes, marshal of the army, put vast numbers to death by martial law, without any regular trial. Sixty-six persons suffered death at Durham, among whom were Plumtree a priest, Struther an alderman, and several peace officers who had acted under the orders of the insurgents. In a tract of 60 miles by 40, from AVeatherby to Newcastle, it is said there was scarcely a village which did not witness the execution of some of the inha bitants ; and several were put to death at York. Those, however, who possessed lands or chattels, under went the formality of a trial, that the forfeitures consequent on their attainders might indemnify the queen for the expenses of the campaign. The bishop of Durham writes, that in this county the sheriff cannot pro cure juries, \"the number of offenders is so grete, that few innocent are left to trie the giltie.\" Tbe Countess of Northumberland, with the Earl of AVestmoreland, Ratcliffe, Norton, stlarkenfield, Swin burn, Tempest, and the other exiles, were safe under the protection of the Border clans, and, in a short time, were all conveyed to the continent. The Earl of Northumberland, in his flight, fell into the hands of thieves, and was stripped and otherwise ill treated by them. At length he reached the house of Hector of Harlaw, an Armstrong, with whom be hoped to lie concealed ; for Hector had engaged his honour to be true to him, and was under great obligations to this unhappy nobleman. But the faithless wretch betrayed his guest for a sum of money to Murray, the regent of Scotland, who sent him to the castle of Loughleven, then belonging to AVilliam Douglas. All tbe writers of that time agree, that Hector, who was rich before, fell shortly after into poverty, and became so infamous, that \" to take Hector's cloak\" grew into a proverb to express a man who betrays his friend. Lord Northumberland continued in the castle of Loughleven till the year 1572 ; when James Douglas, Earl of Morton, being elected regent, the exile was given up to the Lord Hunsdon at Berwick, and, being carried to York, suffered death. \u2014 Hutchinson, vol. i. p. 448.

He then proceeded to Geneva, from which he returned, much indisposed towards the English liturgy and church government. About this time, several persons, who were uneasy at home on account of tlieir religious opinions, migrated to New England ; among whom was Vane, who, notwithstanding his youth, was elected governor of Massachusetts ; but his enthusiasm soon led the colonists to repent their choice, and his government terminated at the next election. He then returned privately to England, married, and was appointed a joint treasurer of the navy. He was chosen to represent Hull in the next parliament, yet still kept on such terms with the royal party as to obtain knighthood. The spirit ofthe times, however, soon led him to take part against the court, and he was very instrumental in producing the condemnation of Lord Strafford, and he also carried up to the lords the articles of impeachment against Archbishop Laud. He likewise acted as one of the parliamentary commissioners at tbe treaty of Uxbridge in 1645 ; and at the negotiations in the Isle of Wight in 1648, he was an opposer of the terms of peace. Either from policy or feeling, however, he bad no immediate concern in tbe king's trial or death ; but he was one of the council of state appointed to supreme power after that event. In 1651, he was appointed a commissioner to be sent into Scotland, in order to introduce the Eng- lish government there. He continued a strenuous adversary to Cromwell during the whole progress of that leader to sovereignty, on which account the latter found means to imprison him in Carisbrook Castle. He even sought to intimidate him by questioning his title to the Raby estate, notwithstanding which be conti nued inflexible during the whole of tbe protectorate. After the restoration of the Long Parliament, he was nominated one of the committee of safety, when he strenuously exerted himself to restore republican govern ment, until the Restoration put an end to all further contest.

The Convention Parliament petitioned in favour of him and Lambert, and the king promised that his life should be spared. Charles II., however, kept his word in this instance much the same as in other matters, and Sir Henry was brought to trial for high treason. Although accused only for transactions that occurred after the king's death, he was found guilty in the teeth of a defence of great vigour and ability, in which he pleaded that, if complying with the existing government was a crime, all the nation had been equally criminal. He further observed that he had, in every change, adhered to the Commons as tbe root of all lawful authority. At the scaffold he behaved with great composure and resolu tion, and began to address the people in justification of his conduct, but was rudely interrupted by drums and trumpets, which was deemed a novel, as it was certainly a most indecent practice. Sir Henry Arane, like most religious enthusiasts who interfere in politics, was a very doubtful and equivocal character, and mingled much fanatical speculation with an extraordinary degree of acuteness and general good sense. Al though he employed craft and dissimulation as his means, there is little reason to doubt that be was sincere as to his ends, and the real convert to republicanism which he professed to be.

This township extends from 2 to 4 miles north-west of Staindrop, along the north side of the Staindrop Beck, westward from Raby Park, in which that part of the township called Shotton is situated. The whole contains fifteen farms, and nearly 40 scattered houses. The Gaunless smelt- works are situated in Langley-Dale, and are said to yield about 400 pigs, or 3200 stone of lead, and above 200 ounces of silver per week. A Methodist chapel was erected here about 20 years ago, on a piece of land which, previous to the inclosure of the extensive commons here, was consi- dered as a part of Marwood township. Langley-Dale and Shotton were anciently parcels of the estate of the Earls of Westmoreland, and are now tbe property of the Duke of Cleveland. \"In Langley-Dale,\" says Hutchinson, \"is a tower on a fine mount, an ancient outpost and guard to the castle.

PARISH OF COCKFIELD. The parish of Cockfield is bounded on the south by Staindrop and the chapelry of Barnard Cas tle, on the west by Middleton, on the north by Hamsterley chapelry, and on the east by St. Helen's Auckland. It consists of the townships of Cockfield and AVoodland ; the latter being completely separated from tbe former by Lynesack and Softley in the chapelry of Hamsterley. In 1801, they contained 539 inhabitants; but in 1811 they had increased to 577. an<f m 18-1 to 688, consisting of 154 families, inhabiting 146 houses. In 1828-9, the annual value of property assessed to the county-rate was \u00a321^1, 14s. Cockfield. The manor of Cockfield anciently belonged to the Vavasours.

In the 31st year of the same prelate, William Vavasour died seized of the manor, with the advowson of the church there ; and a certain mine Carbonum Maritimorum, in the same manor, value 20 marks, when let to farm. In 1420, Bishop Langley granted his pardon to Ralph Earl of AVestmoreland, for purchasing without licence, of Henry le A'avasour, Chiv., the manor of Cockfield, with the advowson of the church ; and on March 16, 1425, the bishop confirmed the settlement made thereof by the earl to Johanna his coun tess, and the heirs male of their bodies, which had been made without licence. Cockfield was parcel of the forfeited estates. King James I., on August 17, in the 2d year of his reign, granted to Henry Lidley, of Halden in the county of Kent, Knt., and John Starkey, of the same, Gent., all the manor ancl appurtenances of Cockfield, valued at \u00a320, 13s. 3d. per annum ; with the profits of the courts there, valued at 2s. per annum. The Duke of Cleveland is now lord of the manor. The village of Cockfield is situated about 3 miles north from Staindrop. It consists chiefly of scattered houses, but is rapidly increasing in size and population, in consequence of the influx of w-orkmen and others connected with the coal-mines of the district. Cockfield Hall, an old manor house, stands a little to the south of the village, and is now occupied as a farm-house ; but a con siderable portion of the moat around it is still visible. Here are a damask weaver and manufacturer, two breweries, four public houses, and several mechanics, tradesmen, and shopkeepers. The Pri mitive Methodists erected a small chapel here in 1826 ; and the AAresleyans have the use of a school-room, which was built by Mr. George Dixon,* and afterwards enlarged by the parishioners. There is another school in the village. The township includes eleven farms. * \"This place gave birth to two of the most ingenious men of the age: Mr. Jeremiah Dixon, a Quaker, was educated in mathematics by stir. Jobn Kipling of Barnard Castle, and figured in a public character, being sent by the Royal Society to the island of St. Helena, to observe the transit of Venus. He was em ployed to set the limits and bounds of the provinces of Maryland and Pennsylvania, and measured a deTee of longitude. He was also the inventor of several useful machines used about tbe coal-works. Mr. George Dixon, his brother, was educated under the same master; and though of a genius that rivallled Jeremiah, yet he confined himself to a more retired line of life, being employed in the north, in various coal works and other mine adventures, in which he displayed an extensive knowledge, and competent judgment. The death of those two valuable men is a great national misfortune, and to individuals who were acquainted with them, an inestimable loss. They were the sons of an old and faithful servant, under the Raby family, whose picture is preserved at the castle, inscribed, ' An Israelite indeed in whom there is no guile.' \" Hut chinson, vol. iii. p. 283. Mr. George Dixon was a very ingenious man \u2014 a good mathematician, a mineralo gist, a painter, an engraver, a great experimentalist in chemistry, hydraulics, and pneumatics, and also an excellent land-surveyor and \"most beautiful planner.\" John Bailey, Esq., of Chiliingham, Northumberland, was the son of Mr. AVilliam Bailey, of Blades Field near Bowes, in the county of York. He shewed a taste for drawing very early in life, and was patronized and assisted both in that and in mathematical studies by Mr. George Dixon, of Cockfield, who was his uncle by marriage. He Mas employed when a young man by that gentleman as tutor to his children, during which time he devoted his leisure hours to drawing and engraving many of the pieces which bear his name ; but he never followed engraving as a sole occupation. No doubt stir. Bailey profited largely in his scientific know ledge by living under the roof of his relation. After attending to the education of his cousins, he practised land-surveying, and for a short time was mathematical teacher under the Rev. John Farrer at AVittonde- Wear. He there married the daughter of Nicholas Greenwell, Esq., and shortly afterwards became Lord Tankerville's land-agent at Chiliingham, which he continued to the time of his death. He, at the same time, did a great deal of business as a general land-agent and surveyor, and few men have greater claims to the gratitude of posterity for the many lasting improvements in rural economy planned and executed by him. Mr. Bailey engraved several of the plates of Hutchinson's topographical works: he was also the author of an \" Essay on the Construction of the Plough,\" 8vo., and joint writer with Mr. Culley of the Northumber land Report, drawn up for the Board of Agriculture. He died June 4, 1819, aged 68."], [229, "COCKFIELD. 213 The Church Is a humble structure, apparently of great antiquity, consisting of a nave and chancel, without tower or side-aisles.

Cockfield Fell is a large tract extending northward from the village to the Gaunless, and abound ing with rich seams of coal, the winning of which now gives employment to several hundreds of pitmen. Aravasour's mine here, mentioned in 1375, is the first inland colliery upon record ; and since that time coals have been constantly wrought in this district. \" On Cockfield Fell,\" says Hutchinson, \" are many lines and entrenchments, a plan of which, communicated by Mr. Bailey, was published in the Antiquarian Repertory.\" It is, however, probable that these mounds are nothing more than the refuse of old coal workings. Since the commencement of the Stockton and Darlington Railway, ancl its branch by way of Cockfield Fell to Butterknowle, the working of coal has been prosecuted here with great vigour. The pits, some of which are now (1833) sinking in the very centre of the village, are seldom more than from 20 to 30 fathoms deep ; and the seam of coal, which is of good quality, averages near six feet thick.* Woodland.

The manor of AVinston was anciently the estate of the Scropes of Masham ; but on the attainder of Henry Scrope for treason against King Henry Y.,* it was forfeited to the bishop of Durham. Being proved an entailed estate, Bishop Neville restored it, April 15, in the 14th year of his epis copacy, to John, brother of Henry Scrope. AVinston afterwards belonged to the Menvilles, and was again forfeited by the attainder of Ninian Menville.

That structure was built in 1763 and 1764, from a plan designed by Sir Thomas Robinson. The arch is the segment of a circle, measuring 112 feet span, is 22 feet broad, and 20 feet between the parapet walls.

But before this mischievous plot could be effected (which was to have kill'd the king, and all bis brethren, ere he went to sea ; five ships being ready at Suthampton, to waft the king over into France) it was discovered.

The parochial chapelry of Whorlton, which consists of but one township, is bounded on the east and north by the parish of AVinston, on the west by the chapelry of Barnard Castle, and on the south by the Tees. In 1801, its population was 245; in 1811, 246; and in 1821, 300, con sisting of 58 families, inhabiting 55 houses. The annual value of property assessed to the county rate for the year ending January 12, 1829, was _\u00a3J1723, 10s. \u2014 j 0 j . \u201e, _ _ Charles Earl of Westmoreland forfeited AVhorlton, with his other estates, on his attainder in 1569 ; and it remained in the crown till the reign of King James I., when it was comprised in a grant of Barnard Castle to the citizens of London, in trust for sale. It was purchased from the trustees by Taylor and Lee, who resold it to Ambrose Johnson, in whose family it continued till the year 1725, when it became by purchase the property of Mr. Sanderson. It remained for some descents in his posterity, the Milburnes, of Armathwaite Castle, co. Cumberland; but Thomas Harrison, Esq. of Stubb House, is now the principal proprietor. The village of AVhorlton is pleasantly situated on the north bank of the river Tees, 3 miles east south-east from Barnard Castle, and commands an extensive view over tbe adjacent lands in York shire, including Rokeby Park,* the elegant seat of Jacob Bacon Sawrey Morrit, Esq. on the west. * The beautiful estate of Rokeby, the charms of which are now deservedly raised to celebrity by the poem of Sir Walter Scott, long gave name to a family by whom it is said to have been possessed from tbe Con quest downwards ; and \" Rokeby's lords of martial fame\" are at different times distinguished in history. lt was the Baron of Rokeby who finally defeated tbe insurrection of the Earl of Northumberland, in the time of Henry IV. The Rokeby, or Rokesby, family continued to be distinguished until the great civil war, when, having embraced the cause of Charles I., they suffered severely by fines and confiscations. The estate then passed from its ancient possessors to the family of Robinson, from whom it was purchased by the father of the present proprietor. The ancient castle of Rokeby stood exactly upon tbe scite of the present mansion, by which a part of its walls is inclosed. It is surrounded by a profusion of fine wood, and the park in which it stands is adorned by the junction of the Greta and the Tees. The title of Baron Rokeby of Armagh was, in 1777, conferred on the Right Reverend Richard Robinson, Primate of Ireland, descendant of the Robinsons, formerly of Rokeby, in A'orkshire. Sir Walter Scott thus describes the romantic glen, or rather ravine, through which the Greta finds a pas sage between Rokeby and Mortham, the former situated upon the left bank of Greta, the latter on the right bank, about half a mile nearer to its junction with the Tees. \"The river runs with very great rapidity over a bed of solid rock, broken by many shelving descents, down which the stream dashes with great noise and impetuosity, vindicating its etymology, which has been derived from the Gothic, Gridan, to clamour. The banks partake of the same wild and romantic character, being chiefly lofty cliffs of limestone rock, whose grey colour contrasts admirably with the various trees and shrubs which fincl root among their crevices, as well as with the hue of the ivy, which clings around them in profusion, and hangs down from their projec tions in long sweeping tendrils. At other points the rocks give place to precipitous banks of earth, bearing large trees intermixed with copsewood. In one spot the dell, which is elsewhere very narrow, widens for a space to leave room for a dark grove of yew trees, intermixed here and there with aged pines of uncommon size. Directly opposite to this sombre thicket, the cliffs on the other side of the Greta are tall, white, and fringed with all kinds of deciduous shrubs. Tbe whole scenery of this spot is so much adapted to the ideas of superstition, that it has acquired the name of Blockula, from the place where the Swedish witches were supposed to hold their sabbath. The dell, however, has superstitions of its own growth, for it is supposed to be haunted by a female spectre, called the Dobie of Mortham. The cause assigned for her appearance is a lady's having been whilom murdered in the wood, in evidence of which her blood is shewn upon the stairs"], [235, "WHORLTON. 219 and the church and rectory-house of Wycliffe* on the south. There is not, as observed by Hut chinson, a more beautiful situation upon the whole river. Below the brink of the cliff is a petri fying spring of considerable strength. Several of the houses in the village bear dates of the early of the old tower of Mortham. But whether she was slain by a jealous husband, or by savage banditti, or by an uncle who coveted her estate, or by a rejected lover, are points which the traditions of Rokeby do not enable us to decide.\" The castle of Mortham, which Leland terms \" stir. Rokesby's place, in ripa citer, scant a quarter of a mile from Greta- bridge, and not a quarter of a mile beneath into\" Tees,\" is a picturesque tower, surrounded by buildings of different ages, now converted into a farm-house and offices. Tlie battlements of the tower itself are singularly elegant, the architect having broken them at regular intervals into different heights ,* while those at tbe corners of the tower project into octangular turrets. They are also from space to space covered with stones laid across them, as in modern embrasures, the whole forming an uncommon and beautiful effect. The surrounding buildings are of a less happy form, being pointed into high and steep roofs. A wall, with embrasures, incloses the southern front, where a low portal arch affords an entry to what was the castle court. At some distance is most happily placed, between tbe stems of two magnificent elms, a monument said to have been brought from the ruins of Eglistone priory, and which, from the armoury richly carved upon it, appears to have been a tomb ofthe Fitzhughs. The situation of Mortham is eminently beautiful, occupyinc*- a high bank, at the bottom of which the Greta winds out of the dark, narrow, and romantic dell above de- scribed, and flows onward through a more open valley to meet the Tees, about a quarter of a mile from the castle. Mortham is surrounded by old trees, happily and widely grouped with Mr. Morritt 's new planta tions. \u2014 Notes to Rokeby. * The famous John AVickliff, usually regarded by Protestants as an eminent reformer of Christianity, or, as he has been somewhat quaintly styled, the Morning Star of the Reformation, was of the family which derived its name from this place ; and Fuller imagines that he was a native of the county of Durham. He was born about 1324, and studied first at Queen's College, and then at Merton, Oxford, where he distinguished him- self by bis attention to school divinity and the works of Aristotle, the most abstruse parts of whose writings he is said to have committed to memory. He also became intimately conversant with the civil and canon law, and with the laws of England ; to which he added a diligent perusal of the Scriptures, and the works ofthe Latin fathers ofthe church. As early as 1356 he inveighed against the authority of the Pope, in a treatise \"Of the Last Age of the Church;\" and, in 1360, he was active in opposing tbe mendicant friars, who took every opportunity to establish their credit and power in the university. In one of his tracts he says, \" Freres drawen children fro Christ's religion into their private order, by hypocrisie, lesings, and steling; for they, tellen that their order is more holy than any other, that they shullen have higher degree in the bliss of heaven than other men that been not therein, and seyn that men of their order shullen never come to hell, but shullen dome other men with Christ at domes-day.\" In 1361, Wickliff was appointed master of Balioi College, and was presented to a college living ; and, in 1365, Simon Islip, the primate, constituted him war- den of Canterbury College, which he had then newly founded at Oxford. An equal number of regular and secular priests having been placed as fellows in this college by the founder, after his death disputes arose, which led to the expulsion of Wickliff and the other three secular members of the college in 1367- On an appeal to Rome, the measure received the sanction of the papal court, a circumstance which exasperated the mind of the ejected warden against the Pope. In 1372, he took the degree of D. D., and he then delivered lectures on theology with great applause. Disputes at this period existed between King Edward III. and tbe court of Rome, relative to the homage and tribute exacted from King John ; and the English parliament had determined to support their sovereign in his refusal to submit to the vassalage in which his predecessors had been forced to acquiesce. A monk came forward as the advocate of the church ; and Dr. Wickliff wrote a reply, which made him favourably known at court, and procured him the especial patronage of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster. In 1374, he was sent to Bruges in Flanders, to confer with the Pope's nuncio on the liberties of the English church. In the same year the king gave him the valuable rectory of Lutterworth in Leicestershire ; and he shortly after obtained a prebend in the collegiate church of AVestbury in Gloucestershire. He had now taken a de- cided part as to ecclesiastical politics; and having, in bis writings, not only charged the Pope with simony, covetousness, ambition, and tyranny, but also styled him Antichrist, it can be no matter of surprise that be was denounced as a heretic. Nineteen articles of alleged false doctrine, taken from his works, were trans mitted to Pope Gregory XL, who in 1377 returned three bulls addressed to the archbishop of Canterbury vol. ii,\u2014 37. 3 L"], [236, "DARLINGTON WARD.\u2014 S. AV. D. 220 part of the last century. On the east side of the road is a row of new stone cottages, with flagged roofs, ancl small gardens in front.

Edward III. died before the bulls arrived ; and the Duke of Lancaster, who chiefly ruled the kingdom under his nephew, was the avowed protector of the refractory divine. Therefore, when be appeared at St. Paul's church, on the citation of the two prelates, he was accompanied by a vast concourse of people, and was supported by the Duke of Lancas ter and the earl marshal. The manner of their entrance, with a train of attendants, was highly offensive to the bishop of London, to whom it appeared more like a triumph than a trial. The court was held in the chapel, where a number of prelates and a few noblemen attended. Wickliff, according to custom, stood up to hear what was charged against him. The lord marshal would have him seated; the bishop of London opposed the proposition. The Duke of Lancaster, in a warm reply, threatened to humble the pride of all the prelates in England ; the bishop making an animated and rather sarcastic reply, the duke threatened to drag him out of the church by the hair of his head. In an instant all was uproar and confusion ; and the noble men carried off their prologee in triumph. AVickliff afterwards attended at Lambeth palace, and delivered to the two prelates a defence or explanation of tbe propositions objected against him. The populace flocked together in crowds to protect him, and he was dismissed without any judgment taking place, partly, as it appears, owing to a mandate from the queen, Anne of Bohemia. Pope Gregory XI. dying in March, 1378, tbe commission he had issued necessarily ex pired, and AVickliff escaped further question for the present. In consequence probably of anxiety and fa tigue, he was seized with a severe fit of illness, on his recovery from which be applied himself anew, by writing and preaching, to his task of undermining the papal authority. The disputes then existing in the church between the rival pontiffs, Urban AT and Clement VII., furnished him with an opportunity for ar gument and invective, of which he freely availed himself. Having, in some of his works, advanced peculiar notions relative to the Eucharist, they attracted the notice and condemnation of the chancellor of the univer sity of Oxford, on which AVickliff appealed to the king and parliament in 1382 ; but not being supported, as he had anticipated, by his former patron John of Gaunt, be was compelled to submission ; and he accordingly made a confession of bis errors at Oxford before Archbishop Courtney, six bishops, and other clergymen, who had already condemned bis tenets as heretical. A royal letter was procured by the primate, addressed to the chancellor and proctors, directing them to expel from the university and town of Oxford all who should har bour Wickliff or his followers, or hold any communication with them. He was, however, allowed to retire unmolested to his rectory at Lutterworth, where he continued to preach, and completed a translation of the Scriptures, in which he bad engaged some years before. In 1383, he was seized with palsy, and this attack furnished him with an excuse for not making his appearance to a citation of Pope Urban VI. A second paralytic stroke terminated his life on tbe 31st of December, 1384. The works of Wickliff are extremely numerous; but most of them remain in manuscript, in the libraries of Oxford, Cambridge, and Dublin, the British Museum, and Lambeth. Among those which have been printed are, \" Trialogus,\" 1525, 4to., republished at Frankfort 1753, 4to., containing a body of theology, in tbe form of a conversation between Truth, Falsehood, and AVisdom ; \" AVickliff's AVicket, or a Learned and Godly Treatise of tbe Sacrament,\" Nuremberg, 1546, 8vo., reprinted Oxford, 1612, 4to. ; the Prologue to his Translation of the Bible, published by R. Crowley, under the title of \" The Pathway to Perfect Know ledge,\" 1550, 12mo. ; and his version of the New Testament, first edited by the Rev. J. Lewis, London, 1731, folio, and more recently by H. H. Baber, M. A., 1810, 4to. The version of the Old Testament re mains unprinted. AVickliff was a bold and original speculator both in religion and politics ; and the influence of his writings on the state of public opinion in Germany, may be estimated from the proceedings against him at the council of Constance, after his death, when his sentiments being condemned on the score of heresy, his bones were ordered to be taken up and burnt : and this sentence, to the disgrace of his adversaries, was exe cuted 44 years after his death, and his ashes thrown into a brook. That they were carried by the brook into a river, and by the river into the sea, has been adduced by his admirers as emblematical of the diffusion of his doctrines, and by bis opponents as typical of their ultimate dispersion. Many paradoxical notions are to be found in AVickliff's writings. Like some other moral and theological philosophers, he has entangled himself in the doctrine of fatalism, and became involved in the abyss of what was called the supralapsarian heresy. This will be obvious from a short extract of a summary of his doctrines taken from his famous \" Trialogue,\" mentioned above. He asserts that every thing happens through neces-"], [237, "AVHORLTON. 221 The Chapel Stands to the south of the village, and is a small humble edifice, consisting of a nave and chancel, separated by a low circular arch.

By an award, May 13, 1793, Cornelius Harrison, of Stubb House, Esq., was adjudged lia- ble to the payment of this interest, as being the legal representative of Thomas and Richard Holmes above named; and he consequently, until bis death in 1806, used either to pay 16s. a year, as the interest ofthe above-mentioned legacy, to the curate, to distribute, or distributed the amount himself; and his sister, who was his executrix, continued the same practice until her death in 1810. When Thomas Harrison, Esq., succeeded to his father's property, he refused to pay any interest, on the ground that the principal never came to his father's bands. Since tbe representation made by the Commissioners for inquiring concerning Chari- ties, however, he has agreed to continue the payment when called upon for it. Donor unknown. \u2014 A small piece of land in the township of AVhorlton, containing about half an acre, is supposed to have been left many years ago, the rents to be given to the oldest poor inhabitant not receiving relief. The land was formerly let by tbe township officers, and latterly produced \u00a31 per annum, which was disposed of as above mentioned. About ten years ago, a sum of money being wanted to rebuild the township school-house, this land was sold for \u00a330, which was its full value, and the money was laid out upon the school. sity ; that he resisted tbe admission of that doctrine a long time, because it is inconsistent with tbe liberty of God ; but that he was finally obliged to give way to it, and to allow at the same time that all the sins com- mitted in the world are necessary and inevitable ; that God could not prevent the sin of the first man, nor pardon it without the satisfaction of Christ ; but the incarnation and its consequences were all matters of absolute necessity. He goes on to state, that God approves of our becoming sinners, that he obliges us to commit sin, and that man cannot act better or otherwise than he does act. A father, he says, wdio perse- veres in justice until death, cannot transfer an inheritance to his son, unless he also merits for him the grace of living holily. On the doctrine of transubstantiation, this early reformer seems to have entertained no very precise ideas. He indeed positively asserted that tbe effectual consecration of the elements required personal purity in the priest ; and that the guilt of mortal sin destroyed all power and authority, all title to respect and obedience in clerical and lav officers of all descriptions, from the Pope to the deacon, and from the king to the constable. To this doctrine, evidently a heated consequence of his hatred of the papal power, must be attributed much of the antipathy with which Catholics have ever been accustomed to regard the memory of Wickliff. Even among Protestants, he has met with some severe censurers of his opinions, including Me lancthon and Dr. Fell. The praise of talents and learning, however, cannot be denied him. His followers in this country were numerous, though the utmost severity was resorted to for their extirpation. On the continent, his writings probably paved the way for the anarchy, the fanaticism, and the outrageous conduct ofthe Hussites and the Anabaptists. \u2014 Biog.

Bridge. \u2014 On June 9, 18C9, the foundation stone of an intended bridge over the river Tees, at Whorlton, was laid by Miss Headlam, daughter of the archdeacon of Richmondshire, amidst great rejoicings; but, during the flood which occurred in the night of October 13, in the same year, the structure, so far as completed, was entirely carried awa}'. On August 19, 1830, the foundation of the north pier of a chain bridge was laid here ; and, on April 1, 1831, the main chains were thrown over the piers, and safely moored into the rock on each side. On July 7. this elegant structure, which was erected from the designs and under the direction of Mr. Green, architect, of Newcastle, was opened for public use by a procession, consisting of a band of music, the architect, and the committee of management, on horseback, followed by a train of twenty-seven carriages, and a very numerous assemblage of spectators on horseback and on foot. The span between the points of suspension is 180 feet. Sledwish. \u2014 This estate was some time the property ofa family named Clopton, whose principal seat was in Warwickshire.

History. \u2014 This district anciently formed a part of the honour of Gainford, and belonged to the crown, being independent of the jurisdiction of the bishops of Durham. It has sometimes been enu merated as one of the appendages of the county of Sadberge; but, as there is no evidence to shew at what time it was united to, or dissevered from that territory, the probability is that the idea has arisen from both places being originally detached from the see.* About the year 1093, AVilliam * Spearman, in his Enquiry, p. 48, says, \" The coroners of Barnard Castle anciently delivered up their rolls to the king'sjustices itinerant, at Sadberge, before the 10th of Richard I., but they never appeared at Durham."], [239, "BARNARD CASTLE. 223 Rufus gave to Guy de Baliol, who came into England with the Conqueror, the forests of Teesdale and Marwood, together with the lordships of Middlcton-in-Teesdale and Gainford, with all their royal franchises, liberties, and immunities.* The Castle of Barnard, with the park and demesne lands, remain members of the township of Marwood to this day : and in old maps the town of Marwood is placed where the present street called Gallgate begins. On an eminence at the head of this street, where the roads divide, several stone steps and a broad pavement were dug up some years ago, by many supposed to be the remains of the market cross of Marwood, but by others considered to be vestiges of the engine once used for the decapitation of criminals ; a conjecture which is strengthened by the present name of Gallgate, and the old appellation of Hang Slave, used in ancient records.-f- Near to the same place is an old chapel, called Bedekirk, now occupied as a farm-house ; but it is not mentioned in any of the ecclesiastical records, nor has it been used as a place of worship within the memory of the oldest inhabitants. Marwood is said to have been the original town, but after the erection of a fortress near it, the inhabitants deserted their ancient dwellings, and, being encouraged by a grant of privileges, were induced to build habitations under the protection of the Castle, which was built by Barnard, the eldest son of the before-named Guy de Baliol, about the year 1178. Barnard Baliolj granted to the inhabitants a burgage tenure ; and they afterwards received from his son, also named Barnard, \u00a7 a charter of privileges, which is still preserved in the town chest, wrote on vellum, in a strong square hand, and is to the following effect : \u2014 \" Bernard, de Baill. omnib. boibs suis z amic's Francis z Anglis presentibs z futuris sals, sciatis me dedisse z concessisse et hac carta mea confirmasse burgesibus meis de Castello Bernard, z heredibs suis omes illas liberalitates z liberas consuetudines quas dedit eis pater meus z concessit tenendas a me z heredibs meis feudo z heredilate secundum liberalitates de Richemunt quas dedit eis pater meus z concessit Hii sunt testes Ran dulf fil.

X On the invasion by the Scots, 3d Stephen, this Barnard was one of the northern barons who met in council at Thirsk, and was sent from thence to King David to persuade him to retreat. Not succeeding in this, he betook himself to arms, and shared in the honours gained by the English army at the Battle of the Standard. He was afterwards taken prisoner, with King Stephen, at the battle of Lincoln in 1142. In the 20th Henry IL, the Scots having laid siege to Alnwick Castle, Barnard de Baliol, Robert de Stuteville, and other barons, marched to its relief. A thick fog obscured their passage, and a halt was recommended ; but Baliol exclaimed, \" Let them stay that will; I am resolved to go on, though none follow me, rather than dishonour myself by staying here.\" His example inspired the rest with courage ; they marched forward, sur prised the enemy, and in a short skirmish took the Scottish king himself a prisoner, and sent him to Rich mond Castle. Among other benefactions to the church, Baliol gave his lands in Teesdale, with pasturage for 60 mares and colts of two years old, and six score young cattle, 12 kine, and two bulls, to the monks of Rievaulx \u2014 Dugdale's Baronage, vol. i. p. 523. \u00a7 In Dugdale called Eustace- 3 M VOL. 11."], [240, "DARLINGTON WARD\u2014 S. W. D 224 This instrument is a grant and confirmation of privileges to the burgagers of Castle Barnard, and their heirs, to be held of the grantor and his heirs, in chief, in fee, and inheritance, similar to the liberties of Richmond, in Yorkshire. This Barnard, or his father, perhaps both, were adhe rents of Galfrid Rufus, bishop of Durham ; in consequence of which, Cumyn, who usurped the see, sent a detachment to this town and neighbourhood, where they committed great ravages, cruelly tortured many of the inhabitants, and carried others away prisoners. Huo*h Baliol, the next in succession, confirmed the charters of his predecessors, and granted to the inhabitants of Barnard Castle \"all that common pasture, and all common lands in the east and north parts, from a certain rivulet which flows from Watesca/e, or Watershaw, and runs into Beck dam; and from the road which leads from Castle Barnard, and goes towards Stanhope,1'' with this exception, that they and their heirs \" should not take from the wood of Wythners, Hankeslave, or Berlainicker (places which are not now known), without the consent of him and his heirs.\" Wa tershaw-beck, where it runs into Beckdam, and the road leading from Barnard Castle to Stanhope,* are the distinguishing boundary marks of the common then granted, lying to the north and east of the town, including the town-fields which were inclosed in 1733, by virtue of an act of parliament. Hugh Baliol married Agnes cle A'alencia, niece to King Henry III., and she had in jointure Mid dleton ancl Gainford. Alexander, king of Scotland, in the time of this Hugh, after having subdued all the fortresses in Northumberland for Lewis of France, came before Barnard Castle, where Eus tace de ATesey, on a reconnoitring party, was slain by a shot from a cross-bow ; but it does not appear that the fortress was attacked. -J- John Baliol, the next possessor of Barnard Castle, granted a fourth charter to tbe inhabitants, in which a second race of grantees are mentioned, under the title ot freeholders ofthe town; to whom, and the burgagers, the deed conveys a certain common pasture in Marwood, in exchange for lands which the grantor bad inclosed in his park, and others which the burgagers had released to him and his heirs. The boundaries of this pasture are described as follows : \u2014 \" From a cross called Roger Cross, by the wall up to the Saltury, or Deer's Leap, under Stanley on the west, and from thence to Egleston way, adjoining to Beaconstone-gate, on the north, and so by Egleston way to the west foot of East-Moss-Mire-bridge, and so in Blackdean towards the north.\" It is bounded on the north and north-east by the land conveyed by the preceding charter. The proprietors of lands and tenements in Barnard Castle, by these two charters, had granted to them an extensive tract of country, comprehending no less than 97*30 acres of land, capable of high cultivation. John * Stanhope here signifies Slonchope, or Stonehiil, a place now called Stane-ton-hill. t The following account of this affair is in Lambarde's Dictionary, p. 44, from Matthew Paris : \u2014 \" Toward the end of Kinge Jbons reigne, what tyme Lewes of Fraunce molested this realme, Alexander king of Scot land came to Dover, and did to Lewes the homage that of right he ought to Jhon : and as he passed by Cas tle Barnard, with his companie (which castle then stode in the precinct of Halywerkfolk in the custodie of Hugh Baliol) he surveid it about, to espie whether it were assailable of any side ; and while he was thus occupied, one within discharged a cross bowe, and strake Eustace Vesey (which had marryed his syster) on the forhead with such might, that he fell dead to tbe ground, whereof the kinge and all his nobles conceaved great sorrow, but wear not able to amend it.\" Hugh Baliol was in great favour with King John; and, with Philip de Hulcotes, resisted the incursions of the king of Scots. \" Certain it is,\" says Dugdale, \" that he benefited himself not a little in those trouble some times of King John's reign (being then for the king;) for when all was quiet, at the entrance of Kino- Henry the Third, he could not forbear his wonted course of plundering.\" He still, however, enjoyed the favour of the latter monarch."], [241, "BARNARD CASTLE. 225 Baliol, then lord of Castle Barnard, about the 14th year of King Henry III., is reputed to have founded an hospital there, dedicated to St. John the Baptist, and endowed with certain lands* Alexander, the third son of John Baliol, gave the inhabitants of Barnard Castle a confiimatory charter, which revoked some of the restrictions contained in his father's grant; so that the family of Baliol, in five successions, held and enjoyed Barnard Castle of the crown per baroniam integrant, with jura regalia. The records quoted by Hutchinson as belonging to the time of John, fifth son of John Baliol above mentioned, supply a complete statement of the franchises ancl privileges of this liberty. From some of these it appears, that there was anciently an \"itinerant judge,\" sent to dispense justice; there was also a chief bailiff of the liberty, a constable of the Castle, a forrester, and a porter of the Castle, with separate fees; and a coroner was appointed by the lord of the liberty. Spearman observes, \" that the bishop of Durham had his proper escheator, and three coroners allowed by quo warranto ; his three coroners are in his own three wards, Easington, Darlington, and Chester whereof Barnard Castle was not a parcel till of late (since the reign of Philip and Mary) ; he hath now his other coroner for Stockton Ward.\" The lords of the liberty had formerly \" divers knio-hts' fees, wardships, marriages, and reliefs there; and had the goods ofthe nief or native, which they frequently took into their own hands.\" They had free-warren and chase, over an extent of laro*e moors and wastes ; they had also the soil, mines, quarries, and other perquisites, from whence they made the grants before specified. They had the return of writs and warrants awarded thither, so that no officer could enter the liberty, but by writ de non omittas : they had also the privileo-es of markets and fairs, the goods and chattels of felons condemned within their courts, and received a yearly rent, called the Brew-farm, from all the alehouse keepers, who were obliged to be licensed by the steward in open court. John Baliol married Isabel, daughter of John Plantagenet, Earl of AVarren and Surrey ; and, in 19 Edward I., he was one of the chief competitors for the kingdom of Scotland. The dispute be- * John Baliol married Dervorguill, or Devergald, eldest daughter and heiress of Alan of Galloway, consta- ble of Scotland, by Margaret, daughter of the Earl of Huntingdon, younger brother of William kin\"* of Scotland. By this union be acquired a great accession of wealth and influence ; and on the strength of it his son laid claim to the crown of Scotland. He was sheriff of Cumberland from 33 to 39 Henry III. inclu- sive, and governor of the castle of Carlisle. On the marriage of Margaret, the king's daughter, to Alexander, the young king of Scotland, their tuition was committed to John de Baliol and Robert de Ros of Wark ; but, within two years, they were both accused to King Henry at Nottingham of having abused their trust. Richard Earl of Gloucester, and John Mansell, one of the king's counsellors, were despatched to Edinburgh with a choice body of men ; and learning that tbe young king and queen were shut up in the Castle, they procured entrance, with a few followers, by pretending to be the inferior servants of Robert de Ros. The queen \" presently came to them, and made a grievous complaint of her bard usage ; expressing that she was kept there like a prisoner, in a solitary place, near the sea, and destitute of any wholesom air; being neither permitted to go abroad, nor to have attendance of waiting-maids fit for her ; no, nor to enjoy her husband's bed. All which the earl and Mansell remedied.\" The offenders, however, appear to have escaped with very little punishment; for the king remitted the fine of 100 marks levied upon Ros; and, as to Baliol, \"partly for his father's sake, who had been very serviceable to King Jobn in his great distresses, and partly for mo- ney (of which he had store), he made his peace.\" In 42 Henry III., he had command to attend the king at Chester, well accoutred with horse and arms, to oppose the incursions of Llewellyn, Prince of Wales. He afterwards assisted the king against the rebellious barons, and was taken prisoner at the battle of Lewes. How he escaped is unknown ; but he was subsequently active, with other northern barons, in raising forces for the king's redemption. He died 53 Henry III. His memory is rendered famous by the foundation of Baliol College, Oxford, which he commenced in 1263, and which was completed by his widow. \u2014 Dugdale's Baronage, vol. i. pp. 524, 554. Biog.

D. 226 ing referred to King Edward, he adjudged the right to Baliol.* On the forfeiture of his estates, Bishop Beck claimed Barnard Castle, as of the jura regalia of his palatinate ; but the king, being determined to abridge the overgrown power of this prelate, seized the palatinate, which he shortly afterwards restored in a mutilated state, having taken from it the large possessions which it had acquired on the attainder of Baliol and Bruce. Edward gave Barnard Castle, with its members, to Guy Beauchamp, Earl of AVarwick,f in whose family it continued for five descents. Thomas Earl of Warwick, his grandson, was chosen one of the governors of King Richard II. 'during his minority, but incurred that monarch's displeasure ; and when Richard assumed the reins of govern ment, AVarwick was suddenly arrested, and banished to the Isle of Man. In 1398, the Castle, town, and lordship of Barnard Castle, together with the manors of Middleton and Gainford, were granted to William Scroope, Earl of AViltshire, and the heirs male of his body. In the following year, however, they were restored by Henry IAT. to the Earl of Warwick.]: * AVhatever may be thought of the interference of King Edward in the affairs of Scotland, it is certain that Baliol was the candidate most justly entitled by primogeniture to the crown of that kingdom. The halo which romance and romantic history have thrown around the character of Bruce, has placed the preten sions of his rival in the shade, and subjected the memory of the English monarch to much undeserved obloquy. t This nobleman, the same year that his father died, had summons, with many other great men, to be at Carlisle on the eve of Pentecost, well furnished with horse and arms, to march into Scotland ; this being the time that the king made a personal expedition thither, and obtained a great victory at Falkirk. Tbe Earl of AVarwick behaved himself so gallantly in this battle, that the king rewarded him with all the castles and lands of Geffrey de Mowbray lying in that kingdom (except the manor of Okeford, near Roxburgh), with other large possessions. The next year, be was employed beyond the sea. In the 31st of Edward I., he attended the king again to Scotland, and was in person with him at the memorable siege of Caerlaverock. 34th Edward I., he had a summons to AVestminster, to consider touching an aid towards making the king's son a knisiht. The same year, he bad a licence to entail his lands on Hugh Despenser, in failure of male issue. He was one of tbe barons whom King Edward I. on his death-bed desired to be good to his son, and not to suffer Piers Gaveston to return again into England. On the ascendancy of that favourite, therefore, the Earl of AVarwick joined Thomas Earl of Lancaster aud others, and took Gaveston prisoner at Scarbo rough ; but King Edward II. interceding for him, the Earl of Pembroke undertook, upon forfeiture of all he had, that their victim should not escape, provided he himself were allowed to conduct him to a conference with tbe king. The rest seemingly assented to this; but, during the journey of Pembroke with Gaveston, the Earl of Warwick came in the night with a number of armed men, and took the latter back to AVarwick Castle, where, after a short consultation, he was beheaded. The particular enmity which AVarwick bore to Gaveston is said to have originated in that minion of royalty calling him \" The black dog of Arden,\" from his swarthy complexion. None of the actors in this murder were punished. Thomas Earl of Warwick, son of Guy, was two years old at his father's death in 1315 ; and on his coming of age, \"he was scarce ever out of some great and memorable employment,\" being present at numerous bat tles in France, particularly those of Cressy and Poictiers, and at the siege of Calais. He afterwards accom panied Prince Edward for three years in bis wars against the infidels. In 41 Edward III., he was joined in commission with the bishop of Durham and others, to supervise the Marches of Scotland ; and he was one of the founders of the Order of the Garter. In 43 Edward III., he went over to Calais to assist the Duke of Lancaster aud tbe Earl of Hereford, who were threatened by the French army, and whose troops were wasted by famine and plague. On landing, he severely reprehended these noblemen for delaying to fi<*-ht, saying, \" I will go on and fight before the English bread which I have eaten be digested.\" He accordingly drove the French before him ; but, on his return towards Calais, fell sick of the pestilence, and died Novem ber 13. \u2014 Dugdale, vol. i. p. 230, fye. X He died April 3, 1401. Richard, his son, was made Knight of the Bath by Henry IV., whom he as sisted against Owen Glendower and Henry Hotspur. Having obtained licence to visit the Holy Land, he travelled through France and Italy ; and, at Verona, fought a single combat, according to the custom of the age, with Sir Pandulph Malacet, or Malet, who had challenged him, and whom he nearly slew. At Jeru-"], [243, "BARNARD CASTLE. 227 Though Bishop Booth made great efforts to confirm the determinations made in favour of the see in the parliament of Edward III., issued many instruments, and had repetition ofthe adjudi- cations in his favour, yet the family of AVarwick continued to hold Barnard Castle, which after- wards passed in marriage with Anne, one of the daughters ancl coheiresses of the celebrated Richard Neville, Earl of AVarwick,* to Richard Duke of Gloucester, who ascended the English throne in 1483 as Richard III. ; previous to which, Barnard Castle was one of his favourite seats. Tanner, in his Notitia, p. 117, says, \"Richard Duke of Gloucester obtained a licence from King Edward IV., an. regni 17 (1477). to found a college in the Castle here, for a dean and twelve se- cular priests, ten clerks, and six choiristers, to the honour of Christ Jesus, the A'irgin Mary, St. Margaret, and St. Ninian, and to purchase lands, &c. not exceeding the yearly value of 400 marks.\" In the English Monasticon, p. 369, it is added from the words of the licence, \" They to be a body corporate, with all rights, powers, and privileges as such ; and the said duke and bis heirs to be perpetual patrons of the said college, to be called the college of Richard Duke of Glou- cester, at Barnard Castle, in the diocese-of Durham.\" It is presumed that this institution was never completed ; Richard's ambitious views and speedy death, within eight years from the date of the licence, no doubt causing its failure. Probably, however, some buildings were erected for the purpose, as there is now to be seen, at the corner of Newgate Street, a sculptured stone, about four feet high, representing an ecclesiastic in a canopied niche, boldly relieved, grasping a crosier in the right hand and a book in the left, with a rampant boar on each side, apparently on very friendly terms with the biped between them. This ornament, which is now much defaced, seems to have been intended to surmount a gateway. A sculpture of a boar passant, the crest of Richard, is built up in the wall of a house in Newgate Street; a stone with the name of itirartHlg is placed in a house on the west side of Tborngate ;-f- and there are several other memorials of the \" bloody and devouring boar\" in various parts of the town and Castle. Barnard Castle and manor were restored by King Henry ATII. to Anne, widow of the Earl of Warwick, and mother of Anne and Isabel, wives of Richard III. and his brother the Duke of Cla rence. But this appears to have been merely a means of acquiring them himself; for, on Decem ber 13, 1488, by a special feoffment and fine, she conveyed them wholly to the king, entailing them on the issue male of his body, with remainder to herself and her heirs. After belonging to sundry persons, these possessions became, by marriage as is supposed, the property of Charles Earl of salem, he set up his arms on the north side of the temple. On bis return to England, 12 Henry IV., he was joined with the bishop of Durham and others, to treat concerning a peace with Scotland ,* and he armed himself to assist in putting down the Lollards, 2 Henry V. Being appointed governor of Calais, he sent three challenges to the French court, from wdience three knights were despatched to the tournament. These he himself successively encountered and vanquished, appearing on each occasion in a different suit of armour; and soon after, being at Constance, he received a challenge from \" a great duke,\" for his lady's sake, and, in justing, slew him. He served actively during the wars of Henry V. in France, and was appointed lieutenant general of that country by Henry VI., in which office he died about four years after. * Son of Richard Neville, Earl of Salisbury. He acquired the title and the estates of the Beauchamps by marriage with Anne, daughter of Richard Earl of AVarwick, and sister and heiress to his son, Henry Duke of AVarwick.

Upon his insurrection, Sir George Bowes, of Streatlam, anticipated the insurgent earls, by seizing upon and garrisoning Barnard Castle, which he held out for ten days against all their forces, and then surrendered it upon honourable terms, being allowed to depart with arms, ammunition, ancl baggage.* By the suppression of this rebellion, and the consequent forfeiture of the Earl of Westmoreland, Barnard Castle reverted to the crown, and was leased to Sir George Bowes. It was afterwards granted by James I. to his guilty and unhappy favourite, Robert Vis count Branspeth and Earl of Somerset, on whose attainder it again reverted to the crown, and was appropriated for the maintenance of the Prince of AVales's household. King James, in the 16th year of his reign, demised to Sir Francis Bacon, attorney-general, ancl others, the Castle of Barnard Castle, with the lordship or manor, for a term of 99 years, in trust, to empower them to grant leases for 27 years or three lives, under certain rents, for the benefit of the Prince of Wales ; and the survivors of the grantees assigned to Sir Henry Arane, for the unexpired residue of the term. Charles I., in the second year of his reign, by his grant, drted March 14, 1626, in consideration of a large sum of money, conveyed to Samuel Cordwell and Henry Dingley, in trust, for Sir Henry, the reversion of the assigned premises, together with all deer and wild cattle in the parks, and free chase and free warren on the estate, to be held of the crown in capite, by knight's service, under the yearly rent of _P100, 19s. 4d. In 1629, his majesty granted all tbe forfeited estates, and all rents arising therefrom, except a few then remaining in the crown, \" to sundry citizens of Lon don, in trust to sell the same, from whence all the titles of purchasers are derived.\" The Castle, honour, and privileges, with the parks, lands, and appurtenances, were purchased by an ancestor of the present Duke of Cleveland ; and, in the 16th year of Charles I. (1640), Sir Henry ATane obtained a grant from the crown of sundry privileges annexed to his manor of Raby, and honour of Castle Barnard, which was created a barony by AVilliam III. This title was first conferred upon Sir Christopher Vane in 1699.f In 1636, the plague raged so violently in this neighbourhood, that the Magdalen fair was \" cried down ;\" and, in April, 1645, that dreadful visitation again made great havock in the town and vicinity. During the civil wars, the Castle was held for the king ; when Oliver Cromwell laid siege to it, and, by the advice of a deserter from the royal army, erected batteries on the commanding emi nence on the Yorkshire side of the Tees, called Towler Hill, whence he levelled the engines of de struction upon the Castle with such effect, that the garrison was soon forced to capitulate. After the rout at Newburn, in April, 1642, 500 Scots, of whom 200 were cavalry, were quartered upon the inhabitants of Barnard Castle, \"and left a debt of \u00a380.\"l Cromwell is said to have visited * See Sadler's State Papers, vol. ii. p. 330.

On September 19, 1729, a very violent storm of thunder and lightning visited Barnard Castle. The electric fluid set fire to a barn, which it consumed with the corn therein.* On July 11, 1748, a fire broke out in the house of Robert Newby, a barber in this town, which destroyed two houses before it was extinguished. The Hon. Henry Arane sent his engine and ap paratus to assist the inhabitants, and afterwards made a present of them to the town. In March, 1784, as some men were ploughing in the lands of Swaites Hall, near Barnard Castle, they turned up several pieces of silver, which, upon examination, were found to be coins of Henry I., and had in all probability lain in the ground near 600 years. It is remarkable that a tradition of treasure being bid there bad been handed down in the family for ages. During the night of October 13, 1829, there was a strong gale of wind, accompanied by heavy and long-continued rain. The river Tees was swollen to a height not exceeded within the memory of the oldest inhabitant of Barnard Castle. It flooded many of the houses, particularly in Bridge.. gate, where it swept away furniture, clothes, &c. from the inhabitants. On September 8, 1831, a very magnificent display of Chinese fire-works took place at Barnard Castle, in honour of the coronation of their majesties, King AVilliam IV. and Queen Adelaide, which continued from eight oVlock till half past eleven in the evening. On August 25, 1832, Barnard Castle and its neighbourhood were visited by a dreadful thunder storm, accompanied by a whirlwind, which completely unroofed a thatched house, and laid the inmates senseless on the floor, but without further injuring them. A large stack of hay was thrown down ; and a person named Armstrong, who was breaking stones on the road, was lifted off his feet, and thrown to the ground without being much hurt. The whirlwind crossed the river Tees, tore up some large trees near Lartington Hall, ancl killed a calf in a field at Cotherstone. The Tees rose to a great height, ancl the road between Barnard Castle and Bowes was rendered almost impassable.

There is but a hill betwixt the chaces of Langley and Marwood.\" The ruins of this once magnificent fortress enclose an area of about 6\\ acres. The strongest portions of the walls stand on the verge of a cliff, which rises precipitously from the bed of the river Tees to the height of 70 feet, commanding a rich and extensive view of the beautiful valley called Teesdale.* It has been a place of considerable strength, and probably of much service to the country, as the first barrier in this direction to the incursions of the Scots, whose predatory warfare, and the necessary protection of the inhabitants of the country and their cattle, required an area which is larger than that of any other castle in England. It was detached from the town by a strong and high wall with two gateways, one opening to the Market-place, and another to the Flatts. The area entered by the Market-place gate does not appear to have had any communica tion with the chief strong-holds and bulwarks of the place, but probably contained the chapel : it is separated from the interior buildings by a deep fosse which surrounds the rest of the fortress. The gateway leading to the Flatts opens from a large area to the Roman road, which communicated with the ford, and gave name to the village on the Yorkshire side of the river, called Streetford, now corrupted to Startforth. This entrance is under a circular arch, partly built up, with vestiges of flanking buttresses; and is defended by a semicircular tower. Further to the west is an angular projection, near which is still visible the top of the arch that formed the communication between the outer and inner moat. At the north-west corner of the fortress stands \" Baliol's Tower,\" a round building of great size and high antiquity, of excellent masonry in ashler-work, and contain ing a vault 30 feet in diameter, the roof of which is plain, without ribs or central pillar. This tower is in good preservation, having been repaired some years ago, and fitted up as a shot manu factory.-)- The west front of the Castle overlooks the river, ancl appears to have contained the principal lodgings. In one part is a bow-window hung on corbels, in tbe upper ceiling of which is the figure in relief of a boar passant ; and other lofty arched windows have adorned this part of the structure. Beneath the walls, cottages and miniature gardens have been constructed on the shelves of the rock, which is here extremely steep. J To the south, the wall appears very ancient * Immediately adjacent to the river, the banks are thickly wooded ; at a little distance they are more open and cultivated ; but being interspersed with hedge-rows, and with isolated trees of great size and age, they still retain the richness of woodland scenery. The village of Startforth, with its little church, appears immediately beneath the feet. To the west is Towler Hill, and Lartington Hall, the seat of H. Witham, Esq. ; while Mickle Fell presents a blue shade at the extremity of the horizon. The Tees itself flows in a deep trench of solid rock, chiefly limestone and marble. \" Nor Tees alone, in dawning bright, Shall rush upon the ravish'd sight ; But many a tributary stream Each from its own dark dell shall gleam.\" t The process here is the same as in the shot-tower at Elswick, near Newcastle ; that is, the shot is cast at the top of the tower, and, by cooling as it falls, obtains that roundness and solidity for which it is admired by sportsmen. X About 40 years ago, near to where these houses stand, a part of the shell of the Castle, high as that which remains, slid from its base and fell over the cliff. The chasm has been filled up with a low wall Early in the morning of March 12, 1827, a rock of some tons weight was separated from its long abode, and"], [247, "A.

The most remarkable structure remaining in the interior of the walls is \" Brack enbury's Tower,\" situated near the north-eastern corner, and said to have been anciently used as a dungeon. Indeed, as observed by Sir AAralter Scott, \"it bears a name which we naturally connect with imprisonment.\" Its remains consist of an arched vault, now open at one end ; the original entrance being closed up by earth and ruins. There is a niche or closed window at the further end, a fire-place on one side, and two or three niches on the other. A passage from this place through the wall on the south is filled up with rubbish. The outside of the vault is covered with earth and bushes; and a small square hole descends from the top, probably a chimney, or for the purpose of letting down provisions. To the north of Brackenbury's Tower, \u2014 \" The batter'd walls possess remembrance still Of fearless Noll's attack from Towler Hill. \"% came down with a tremendous thundering noise, from a height of 20 yards, against a house in Bridgegate, occupied by persons named Green and Dickinson. Instantly the side of the house gave way ; and two chil dren who were sleeping in a lower room were for some time buried in its ruins, but were taken out unhurt. Dickinson, who occupied an upper room, was asleep in bed ; but though the floor gave way, and one side of the house disappeared, his bed was kept up by a holdfast to the remaining wall, and be remained suspended like a tenant of the air. Through assistance, however, all the inmates of the house were rescued from their perilous situation. * In the spring of 1810, a part of the south wall of Barnard Castle fell. It battered in the roof of a house, and a man at work in a saw-pit below was providentially preserved by a tree falling across it. + Several coins of Edward I. and Edward III. have been found within the Castle walls, in good preserva tion ; also some Ave Maria brass pieces. X Page 18 of \"Castle Barnard, a Poem,\" published in 1823. Mr. George Layton, author of this little work, was born in or near Baldersdale in Yorkshire, in 1790 or 1791, and, having received a tolerable edu cation, he commenced the business of teacher at a school in Bowes. After the failure of a school at Hew orth Shore, on the Tyne, he was employed as a labourer in the establishment of Messrs. Doubleday and Easterby, at Bill Quay. At the celebrated public meeting on the Town Moor of Newcastle, on October 11, 1819, to deliberate on the outrage at Manchester, Mr. Layton was one of the speakers, and seconded the resolutions. In consequence however, of the political notoriety he thus acquired, be was discharged from his situation, and opened a school at North Shields ; in addition to the duties of which, he laboured assiduously in the dissemination of political knowledge, and advocated the popular principles of annual parliaments, uni versal suffrage, and vote by ballot. Some time afterwards, he again entered the service of Messrs. Double day and Easterby, as warehouseman in their establishment at Newcastle ; but, in consequence of a difference with Mr. James Wright, principal agent in the concern, he was compelled to quit this situation, wdien he opened a public house. Here, however, the natural openness of his disposition, and his inexperience in bu siness, exposed him to the attempts of the designing, and he was shortly an insolvent. Mr. Wright now, with laudable and uncommon magnanimity, successfully exerted bis influence to procure for him the situa tion of warehouseman in the chemical establishment of Messrs. T. B. and L. Bowe, of Brentford ; and, having acquired considerable experience in that line, Mr. Layton, in the course of time, became conductor of the concern, in which capacity he still continues. He has written and published several papers on che mical subjects; besides inventing an ingenious method of simplifying the science of navigation. As secretary of the Brentford Political Union, also, he has produced addresses, &c, which have elicited the praises of some of the best judges of that species of composition. vol. ii. 3 O"], [250, "DARLINGTON AVARD.\u2014 S.

The inner moat is very deep at the north-west corner, near Baliol's Tower, and is o-enerally dry, though considerably below the level of the pond just mentioned. In the ground adjoining the Castle, called the Flats, the Ever, a large reservoir, now dried up and culti vated, supplied the garrison and the Castle; inclosed within the walls of the outer area of which, in times of danger, the neighbourhood obtained shelter, for which protection the adjacent lands paid a rent, called castle-guard rent. The Town. Barnard Castle is situated 25 miles south-west from Durham, 16 miles west-north-west from Darlington, and 244 miles north-north-west from London. \" From Stanthorpe,\" says Leland, \" to Barnardes Castle, by meatley good corne ancl pasture, five miles. This is a meatley praty toun, having a good market, and meatley welle buildid. The toun self is but a part of Gaineford paroch, wher the lied chirch is six miles lower on Tese, ancl in the bishoprike.\" Hutchinson says, \"The air of this part of the country is remarkably salubrious, the market is cheap and abundant, coals are plentiful within the distance of eight miles : the town stands in a fine sporting country, and the situation possesses every advantage, to render a rural and retired life pleasant.\" The town is about a mile in length, and stands pleasantly on the southern inclination of a hill descending swiftly to the Tees, which here forms nearly a right angle, coming down from the north-north-west, and turning eastward. Nearly at this point the ancient street called Thorngate* commences, and runs northward, till, becoming steeper, it is called The Bank, at the head of which stands the Town Hall. Beyond this the street widens to upwards of 40 yards across, and is called the Market Place, ancl, higher up, the Horse Market ,* from the northern extremity of which the Cattle Mar ket runs north-east, and is joined by Gallgate. From Thorngate, a street called Bridgegate-f winds towards the west and north-west till it reaches the bridge and the foot of the rocks on which stand the ruins of the Castle. Opposite the Town * On tbe east side of Thorngate is an old building which has the appearance of a religious house. Round a bow-window is cut in the square character this sentence : \" Soli Deo honor et gloria.\" Tanner (p. 116) notes, that \" tbe provincial of the friers heremites of the order of St. Austin, obtained leave of Archbishop Nevill, in the vacancy of the bishoprick of Durham, to build a friery and chapel, upon ground given by Tho mas Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, in his lordship of Castle Barnard, within the parish of Gainford, as ap pears by stir. Hutton's Extracts out of Archbishop Nevill's Register; but whether this took effect, I know not, no mention either in printed books or manuscripts.\" The back buildings form a square, and other ap pearances encourage the idea that the religious edifice stood here Hutchinson. The front of this buildin\" was some years ago used as a chapel by Dissenters. t \" In the time of Bishop Langley,\" says Mr. Layton, quoting Hutchinson, \" either from some jealousy of the burgagers, touching an infringement of their privileges, or some dispute relative to the rights of the lord of this franchise, or perhaps to perpetuate the testimony of a grant then lost, Nicholas del Spence and John de Yrland, bailiffs of Castle Barnard, and the burgagers or burgage holders, entered into an instrument for the purpose of handing down to posterity the best evidence they could of such rights and privileges, settin\"* forth, ' That the liberties of Castle Barnard were as follow, to wit, that Hugh de Baliol had granted to all his burgagers of Castle Barnard, and all their tenants therein dwelling, common of pasture in his wood of Marwood, for all their cattle, without paying any agistment or pannage rent: also that they might drive their cattle in Hermyre at their pleasure : that each burgager might have and make his furnace without paying any consideration ; also might have room for building, and to gather his dung in ihe way before his door to the middle way.' The last privilege appears to be retained to this day, in certain parts of the town, with little diminution : in one street particularly, where the inhabitants, from its narrowness, are precluded"], [251, "BARNARD CASTLE. 233 Hall, a good street, called Newgate, branches off from the Market Place to the east.* Several new streets have been formed within the last few years. One of these, called King Street, leads from Gallgate to the Crook ; and another in the same line has received the appellation of Queen Street. A number of narrow lanes ancl alleys branch off from the principal streets in different directions. Great improvements have been effected in this ancient town. The old streets were formerly dirty and ill paved ; and the Bank was so steep, that the footpaths consisted of flights of steps. This has been lowered, and the whole of the streets are now well paved ancl lighted. An old building called the Tollbootli, ancl the butchers' shambles, formerly stood in the Market Place ; but, being condemned as public nuisances, they were removed, about the year 1800, by the Earl of Darling ton (the lord of the manor), at the solicitation of the inhabitants. Most of the houses in the town are of stone, and many of them roofed with the flags called \" Brignal Slates,\"-)- which gives them a substantial appearance. Numerous sculptured stones are built up in the walls, several of the old houses having been erected from the ruins of the Castle. The Town Hall is an octangular building, around the basement story of which is a circular piazza, with iron rails, and inclosing a dungeon. Here butter, eggs, poultry, &c, are exposed for sale on tbe market-days. A commodious room in the upper story is used for transacting the town's business, and for the magistrates' meetings. It is lighted on four sides ; and on the north front is. the following inscription : \u2014 \" This building was erected in 1717 ('l Mt\u20ac expence of Thomas Breaks, Esq. a native of this place.\" The whole is surmounted by an open cupola with a bell, j The Bridge. \u2014 In Leland's time, Barnard Castle bridge consisted of three arches. Probably this structure had gone to decay ; for the present bridge is of two pointed arches, that on the Durham the enjoyment of their immunity in its fullest extent, the scavengers, as a memento of olden rights, when scraping the road (which they sometimes do), leave here and there, according to circumstances, pretty exten sive deposits of mud; these, exclusively of confirming the charter, furnish, with other contingencies, a most delectable treat to at least two of our senses, when entering or leaving the town in that quarter. Should the passenger have the luck to be on foot, he has a favourable opportunity of exhibiting his breeding (the deficient width of the street obliging the foot-way to be conveniently constructed for that purpose, though apparently with little effect), by stepping off every few yards, to give the pass. AVhile advancing in this zigzag direction, he has an eligible chance of descending mid-leg deep into one at least of these portions of congregated filth before spoken of, and acquiring the appearance of possessing a pair of Wellington boots, which, in these times, are no contemptible acquisition. But should he be unlucky enough not to receive a due proportion in this way, he will have no cause to complain, as the movements upon his flank by carts, horses, and children, will furnish quantum sufftcit.\" It is but justice, however, to say, that Bridgegate, which forms the main entrance into Barnard Castle from Yorkshire, now participates, as far as circumstances will allow, in the improvements effected in tbe other parts of the town. * In a house in this street is an ancient oaken chair, which some conjecture to have been a part of the Castle furniture in the time of its royal owner. The seat is plain ; but a wreath of flowers runs up each of the back-rails. In the centre of the cross-rail is the crown of England, supported by a figure on each side ; and the foot-rail is also ornamented with a crown. t In June, 1797, in working a slate quarry near Barnard Castle, a toad of great magnitude was discovered in a large stone (solid, excepting the spot occupied by the incarcerated animal).

This church was given by Barnard Baliol, with those of Gainford and Middleton, to the monas tery of St. Mary at York. It stands on elevated ground, a little to the east of the Bank, and to the south of Newgate, and is a spacious building, in the form of a cross, with a detached tower at its north-west corner. A leaded spire was removed about 40 years ago, when the tower was raised 60 feet. All the exterior walls of the church are embattled. The entrance from the west was taken down and re-erected in 1813; at which time, the whole of the interior, which had become extremely ruinous, was repaired and new-pewed. On each side of the nave is a narrow side-aisle ; that on the south being formed by four pointed arches supported by octagonal pillars, and that on the north by two circular arches and a wide elliptical one, supported by cylindrical pillars. The south porch of tbe transept was the burial-place of the family of Bowes, several of whose escut cheons, with antique gauntlets and shreds of dresses or banners, are hung around the walls. The entrance to the chancel is beneath a pointed arch, sculptured with leaves and human heads, and supported by pilasters with embattled capitals. \\ The east and south windows of the chancel are under pointed arches (though the latter were formerly different), and there is a small window to the north. The south transept is lighted by a square window divided into compartments to the south, and a highly ornamented one under a pointed arch to the east ; and in the north transept is a modern sash. The windows of the aisles are square, divided into compartments. The font is thus described by Hutchinson : \u2014 \" There is a remarkable bason, of large dimensions, for a font, in this church, of an octagonal figure, cut in black marble, or porphyry, which is found in the bed of the river Tees, near this place : four of the faces have each a shield raised thereon, bearing Saxon characters ; the intermediate facings are inscribed with a figure, much like some of the tradesmen's marks or devices, but, doubtless, here of religious implication, and perhaps symbolical of the Tri nity : the characters are cyphers, to express the usual sentence which we see inscribed on old fonts in various modes, viz. ' Pater filius et spiritus sa?ictus.'\" There is a large gallery over the west end of the nave, and another in the north transept. An elegant and fine-toned organ was erected in the south transept, by voluntary subscription, in 1823; but, as it stands on the pavement, it is in danger of being injured by the dampness. In Hutchinson's time, there were four bells in the * During the great flood of 1771. the Tees was so high at Barnard Castle, that the arch on the Yorkshire side of tbe bridge not being large enough to contain so great a quantity of water, the battlement was forced down, and the water took its course along the street, drove away the causeway, washed away the soil down to the rock, and demolished eight dwelling-houses, so that not one stone was left upon another. The ground was so swept away that the end of the bridge was at least four yards higher than the rock, and persons passing into Yorkshire were obliged to go down a ladder. + Tbe Barnard Castle Tragedy, a local ballad, relates how one John Atkinson, of Morton, near Appleby, courted Betty Howson, of Barnard Castle Bridge-end, and after having gained her affections, forsook her for another, whom he married ; upon which she broke her heart and died. \u2014 Sykes's Local Records.

In 1820, it was \u00a32189, 9s. ; and in 1821, \u00a31547, * In the course of the service at the ordination of the Rev. S. Jackson (now of Staindrop), June 19, 1828, the following summary of the history of Nonconformity in Barnard Castle was read : \u2014 \" It mav afford o-rati- fication perhaps to some present on this interesting occasion, to be informed that Nonconformity had an early introduction into this town. The celebrated John Knox married the sister of Sir George Bowes, of Streat- lam Castle, in this parish, Knight Marshal to Queen Elizabeth, who valiantly defended Barnard Castle against the rebellious Earls of Northumberland and Westmoreland ; and it is not improbable that the stern Scottish Reformer occasionally preached the gospel in this town or in the vicinity. Certain it is, that the cause of Nonconformity was introduced into this town upwards of 200 years ago, by the pious and benevo- lent Lady Isabella Bowes, wife of Sir AVilliam Bowes, and daughter of Judge Wray. She was a liberal patroness of the puritan ministers. Her influence was used to obtain the liberty of such pious and conscien- tious ministers as had been .-ilenced for Nonconformity to the Established Church, and then to place them in those situations she deemed to need their zealous efforts. Her ladyship gave \u00a31000 a year towards the maintenance of preachers under her patronage. On tbe decease of her husband, his body was sent from Nottinghamshire, for interment among his ancestors in the church of Barnard Castle. Her domestic chap- lain, Mr. Dike, attended the funeral, and, on his return, represented to her ladyship the very ignorant and irreligious state of the town, then destitute of a resident preaching minister. She was anxious that he should take up bis residence here for the good of souls ; but he declared he durst not venture among so surly a peo- ple. He recommended the courageous Richard Rothwell, who came here ; and bis zealous labours were attended with such success in this neighbourhood, that he obtained the appellation of \" the Apostle of tbe North,\" and many came from a great distance, and admired the order and number of his congregation. In 1644, the Parliament sent the Rev. John Rogers to be minister of this parish, whose continued labours were a great blessing to the town and neighbourhood during 16 years. He was ejected on the Restoration of Charles the Second. Lord Wrharton then presented him to the rectory of Croglin, in Cumberland, from whence he was ejected by tbe Black Bartholomew Act, which, for their Nonconformity to the Establishment, deprived of their livings upwards of 2000 of the most pious, learned, and conscientious ministers that ever lived in any age or country. Mr. Rogers returned to the neighbouring village of Startforth, and preached in the manor-house there, which belonged to bis brother-in-law, stir. Alderman Barnes, of Newcastle ; also at Darlington, Stockton, Teesdale, AVeardale, &c. After enduring many labours, persecutions, and priva tions, he died in 1688, aged 78- He was intimate with Sir Henry Vane, who sometimes rode from Raby Castle, to attend his pious labours. His son, the eminent Rev. Timothy Rogers, one ofthe ministers ofthe Old Jewry, London, was born in this town ; and a near relative of his wife, Mr. Butler, was a great bene factor to the parish clergyman. One of Mr. Rogers's successors was stir. Lisle, who preached at Startforth, Cotherstone, Langley-Dale, Wolsingham, and Hedley-Hope. The Rev. Messrs. AVarden, Orel, Shield, Prattman, sen., &c., were ministers in succession.\" t \" When that zealous Christian (AVesley) visited Barnard Castle, on his tour through tbe British Isles, the enlightened townsmen, staunch resisters of innovations in religion, literally threw cold water upon all his efforts to convert them ; for, bringing out the water-engine, they showered down their blessings upon his head, till this persecuted friend of mankind deemed it advisable to commence a retreat (or, according to the idiom Napoleon, to make a lateral movement ) , in which he was pursued by the implacable enemy with their flying artillery : and not till he had fairly cleared the place, was he enabled to wash his hands of them.\"\u2014 .

Charities. St. John's Hospital. \u2014 This hospital is said to have been founded by John Baliol in 1229 ; but there is no authentic document relative to its foundation. It is included in the \" Valor Ecclesiasticus,\" made in the 26th Henry VIII., 1536, and is there stated to be in the gift of the crown, and to be of the yearly value of \u00a35, 15s. 8d., subject to an annual payment to three poor women, to pray for the soul of the founder, of 3s. 4d. in money, and 3s. in coals annually, making in the whole 6s. 4d. ; leaving a clear annual income of \u00a35, 9s. 4d. The present income is derived solely from property in the township of Barnard Castle, which is described in the existing lease of the premises in the following terms ; viz. \" The mansion houses and capital messuages belonging to the hospital, with the barns, stables, out-houses, buildings and garth, garden and yard on the back side thereof, situate on the south side of a certain street in Barnard Castle, called Newgate Street, with another parcel of ground used as a garden, before the same, called the Tenter Garth ; and the several closes thereinafter mentioned, the boundaries whereof are therein respectively described, viz. The Bank Close, the Crook Close, another close called the Crook Close, theretofore divided into three, tbe Little Garth, the Gall gate Garth, a close called Westwick Town End Close ; a close adjoining the Lowfield Inclosures and the Lowfield Lane, the Pinfold Close, the low end of the Broom Close ; and also the several allotments set out to Robert Lodge and Anthony Pearson, Martha Bass and AVilliam Hutchinson, on the division of the inter common fields belonging to Barnard Castle, called the Crook, tbe Newfield, the Ings, the Lowfield, the stlid dlefield, and the Northfield, in lieu of certain days work ridges and parcels of land lying in the several intercommon fields [containing in all 57 A. 1 r. 9 p.H- And also the several allotments set out to tbe said Robert Lodge and Anthony Pearson [containing 29 a. 2 r. 29 p.], on the division of the Town Pasture, in lieu of sixteen cattle-gates ; and all other the bouses, lands, tenements, commons, &c. to the said hospital belonging.\" Tbe master is appointed by the Lord Chancellor ; and the Rev.

It came out of the fire-place of the first story ; and though some old men were sitting round tbe fire, it did not burt them, except striking one deaf a little time. It then proceeded to the next room, tore the plastering from the wall, ploughed up the boards for two yards or more, and passed under the feet of an old woman who was sitting on an iron bedstead, yet did her no harm. Having descended to the lower story, it played round the room in the most astonishing manner, leaving marks of its power. From thence it went through the wall into the back kitchen, where it knocked one man down ; and though the mistress of the house and a girl were nearly in a line with it, they only found its effects a few hours. A person in the kitchen said he distinctly saw it go out of the door in the form of a ball of fire. When the master went into the rooms to look after the old people, the sulphur was so strong that he could scarcely enter, and the scene was past description.

He has no duties to perform as custos, and his emoluments arise from the fines received on grant- ing of leases for lives, which appears to have been the practice of preceding masters for many years. By the last lease, which bears date June 18, 1796, the Rev. AVilliam Lipscomb demised to Dorothy Lodge, spinster, Thomas Bass, and Benjamin Bass, and their heirs, in consideration of a surrender of a former lease and of \u00a3141, the several estates and premises belonging to the hospital, for three lives, subject to the payment du- ring the said term, unto the said AVilliam Lipscomb and his successors, of the yearly sum of \u00a39, 16s. 8d., viz. 3s. 4d. to each of the beadwomen in the said hospital, on the first of every month in each year, and the further sum of \u00a31, 5s. to buy the said beadwomen coats or gowns at Christmas, every other year during the said term, and the residue of the said \u00a39, 16s. 8d. unto the said AVilliam Lipscomb and his successors, \u00a34, 10s. thereof being an improved rent for the better accommodation of the beadwomen in the said hospital. An acknowledgment of 20 horse loads of coals, or the sum of 10s., was to be allowed out of the remaining part of the rent above mentioned. The parties in possession of the hospital estate under this demise are, stir. William Luke Prattman, who in right of his wife, formerly Dorothy Lodge, is entitled to about three quar- ters, and the Misses Bass, as representatives of Thomas and Benjamin Bass, are in possession of the remain- der. The shares of the respective owners are divided from each other. In right of the lands described in the indenture of demise, several allotments were made on the inclosure of Barnard Castle Moor; and by the award of the commissioners, March- 6, 1799, 62 a. 1 r. 28 p. were set out to Mrs. Dorothy Christiana Pratt- man, and 25 a. 3 r. 19 p. in two plots to Thomas and Benjamin Bass, as their respective shares of the said common, in right of their lands and tenements of hospital tenure. The portion of the hospital lands held by Mr. Prattman consists of about 60 acres, of the annual value of \u00a3117; and the portion held by the Misses Bass consists of about 27^ acres, of the annual value of about \u00a350. These quantities do not include the al- lotments on Barnard Castle Moor, which are of very small value. There are about two acres besides, held by Charles AVatson, valued at \u00a36 or \u00a37 per annum. The hospital is a low thatched building, containing one room only, and is called the Bedehouse. It is si- tuated in Newgate Street, and two old women reside therein rent-free, and receive 10s. monthly between them. There formerly used to be three poor women, between whom the stipend was divided ; but the ap- pointment of the third has been withheld for about 20 years, to increase the stipend of the other two. For nine months in the year, stir. Prattman pays this sum to the poor women, who, in the absence of the custos, are appointed by him ; and for the other three months in the year, the same payment is made by the Misses Bass. The sum of \u00a31, 5s. is paid to them every other year at Christmas, for coats or gowns. The residue of the rent is paid to the custos, who receives therefore \u00a32, Ils. 8d. in the years in which the allowance for gowns is made, and \u00a33, 16s. 8d. in the alternate years. The hospital premises are kept in tolerable repair by the lessees, one fourth of tbe expense being paid by the Misses Bass, and three fourths by Mr. Prattman. The beadswomen receive also a regular annual supply of 20 horse loads of coals from the estate called Low Huller Bush, belonging to the Bowes family. Charities of Percival and others. \u2014 Robert Percival, by will, December 9, 1729, gave to the minister and four-and-twenty, and churchwardens of the township of Barnard Castle, \u00a340 to be put out, and the interest to be by them yearly distributed amongst the poor of the said township. Christopher Lonsdale, by will, March ll, 1747, gave \u00a340 in trust, to be put out, and the interest thereof yearly paid over to the use of the poor of the town of Barnard Castle on Christmas-eve. Peter Waistell, by will, August 29, 1752, gave \u00a3100 in trust, to be laid out, and the interest to be distributed amongst the poor people of Barnard Castle, dwellers in the said town, on or about the 21st October yearly. Dame Elizabeth Bowes, widow of Sir William Bowes, Knt., in her lifetime gave \u00a330 to the minister and churchwardens of Barnard Castle, in trust, to place the same out, and to distribute the interest amongst such poor housekeepers living in the said town, in such man- ner as they should think proper, yearly, in the month of December. The whole of these sums, with the ex- ception of \u00a310 of the latter, was, oil July 15, 1783, laid out in the purchase of a close in the parish of Startforth, in Yorkshire, the rents to be appropriated in shares for the purposes intended by the donors. This land contains by admeasurement 2 a. 2 r. 30 p., and is let to a yearly tenant at a fair rent of \u00a38, which is divided amongst the four townships of the chapelry in the following manner, being the proportion in which they pay to a church-rate, viz. Barnard Castle, \u00a34, 9s. 6d. ; Streatlam and Stainton, \u00a31, 8s. 6d. ; Marwood, \u00a31, 6s. 3d. ; and Westwick, 15s. 9d. The share appropriated to the township of Barnard Castle is divided into two portions, one of which, with other charities hereafter mentioned, is distributed at Christmas, and the other at Easter. According to lists, made out by the minister and churchwardens, of such persons of the township of Barnard Castle as they think most deserving and most necessitous, the money is given away at the vestry, in sums generally varying from 6d- to 2s. The names of the persons relieved are entered in a book. The shares belonging to the other townships are paid to the respective churchwardens for distribution. Charities of Glenton and others.\u2014 John Glenton, December 3, 1578, charged his lands in Startforth with the payment of certain sums, amounting to 40s. per annum, for the poor of Barnard Castle. This payment, vol. 11.\u2014 38. 3 Q"], [258, "DARLINGTON WARD.\u2014 S. AV. D. 240 in 1793, was released for 20 years' purchase. Ambrose Brunskill, Esq., December 26, 1668, gave a house m Barnard Castle, value \u00a35 per annum. This house having fallen down, its scite was let for \u00a33, 10s- a year, which rent, in 1793, was released for \u00a370. Mary Finlay, June 26, 1688, gave a third part of Broadgates, then producing \u00a31, 8s. yearly; and Thomas Barker gave \u00a35, producing 6s. per annum. The amount of these two sums, \u00a31, 14s. per annum, was released in 1793 for 20 years' purchase. The whole of the above purchase-money, amounting to \u00a3142, was laid out in the premises purchased for the work-house, the total cost of which was \u00a3285 (\u00a3140 being raised on mortgage, see Waste Lands). The several yearly sums charged upon tbe work-house, in respect of the charities above mentioned, amount to \u00a37, 2s. ; but the sum of \u00a33, 12s. only has been paid by the overseer. The Commissioners for inquiring concerning Charities, however, state that' the inhabitants are liable to the payment of the full sum. The sum paid is given away amongst the poor of the township of Barnard Castle, with their share of the charities of Percival and others, at Christmas, in the manner before stated. Emmerson's Charity. \u2014 The Rev. Ezra Emmerson, of Bishop Auckland, by will, December 25, 1733, gave to the minister and churchwardens of Barnard Castle, for the time being, \u00a350 to be placed out at interest, and the produce to be distributed amongst the poor of Barnard Castle. It is understood that this sum was laid out as part of the purchase-money of an estate called Northfield Farm, in the township of Boldron, in the parish of Startforth, Yorkshire, bought by the governors of Queen Anne's Bounty, for the benefit of the incumbent of the perpetual curacy of Barnard Castle, and that the annual sum of \u00a32, 10s. was charged thereon as the interest of Emmerson's gift. This sum is paid by the incumbent, and given away amongst the poor of the township of Barnard Castle at Christmas, together with other charities, in the manner before mentioned. Sanderson's Charily. \u2014 William Sanderson, by will, probably executed in 1755, devised to trustees bis land in Barnard Castle, called the Crook, to permit three poor men to receive and take the profits thereof to their respective uses for their respective lives, and after their respective deaths, then to the use of three such other poor men as should be named and chosen to succeed them ; that is to say, two out of the town of Bar nard Castle, to be elected by the vicar of Gainford, the rector of Romaldkirk, and the rector of Middleton-in- Teesdale ; and one out of the town of Eggleston, to be nominated by the latter rector. The lands described formed part ofthe open fields, which were divided and inclosed under an act of 23 Geo. III. The commis sioners allotted to Sanderson's charity to the poor of Eggleston for their share in the Crook, an allotment containing 2 a. 3 r. 27 p. ; and to the poor of Barnard Castle, two plots, each containing 3 acres. The Eggleston allotment is divided from the others by a fence, and is let by the poor man entitled to the rent, and who receives it himself, to a yearly tenant, at a fair rent of \u00a39, 15s. The other allotments have been let by the vestrymen, who act as trustees, at the rent of \u00a320. Under an act of parliament passed in the 35th Geo. III., for inclosing and allotting Barnard Castle Moor and other waste lands, the commissioners set out \" to the trustees of Sanderson's charity,\" 8 A. 2 r. 33 p. in three plots. These at present lie together and form one field, which is let by tbe vestrymen at a fair rent of \u00a38. AVhen either of the poor persons belong- ing to Barnard Castle dies, the twelve vestrymen present the names of three poor men living in the town, to the vicar and rectors named in the will, and they elect one of them to succeed to the vacancy. The vestry- men always adhere to the directions ofthe donor, in selecting such persons as have been in better circumstances but reduced to poverty. The rent of Barnard Castle share of the Crook lands, and two-thirds of the rent of the new allotments, are paid to the overseer, who allows each of the two poor persons of his township 4s. 6d. a week, amounting to \u00a323, 8s. per annum. In order to defray the expense of the inclosure under the act o\u00a3 1783, tbe sum of \u00a320 was advanced by AVilliam Hutchinson, Esq., being part ofa sum of money in his hands, left by Lord A^ane and AVilliam Hutchinson for the use of the poor ; in respect of which, the tenant pays (in addition to the rent) 13s. 4d. annually, and the Eggleston poor man pays 6s. 8d. as his share of the interest. The Crook lands belonging to the Barnard Castle poor are subject to a payment of Ils. lid. yearly, called Acre Money, and the Eggleston portion to an annual payment of 5s. lid. on the same account.* Charity arising from the Sale of Waste Lands in Barnard Castle. \u2014 By an act of parliament passed 35 Geo. III., for inclosing certain waste lands in the manor of Barnard Castle, viz. Barnard Castle Moor, containing by estimation 6000 acres, the Little Moor, 40 acres, and Glenton Green and the Baiting Steads, 20 acres, it was enacted that the said commons should be sold, and that out of the proceeds of such sales the commissioners * According to the act of parliament, passed in 1783, for enclosing the open fields within the township of Barnard Castle, certain payments called Acre Money are chargeable for ever on the different allotments, in lieu of winter tillage; unless the same are bouo-ht at 25 years' purchase, according to the following rates, viz. 6d. for every cattle gait on the town pasture; ls. Cd. per acre for the Low field, Middle field, North field, the Ings, and the New field ; and 2s. per acre for the Crook. Until such Acre Money is purchased it is to be vested in the churchwardens and overseers of the poor of Barnard Castle for the time being, and by them to be collected from the occupier of each allotment, and applied in reduction of the poor rates, together with the interest of the money paid by the proprie tors for the redemption of the Acre Money chargeable on their respective lands. Tiiere is now nearly \u00a31000 three per cent, consols derived from this source, the interest of which and the Acre Money still payable amount to between \u00a350 and \u00a360 per annum."], [259, "BARNARD CASTLE. 241 under the said act should, in the first place, pay all the costs of surveying and selling the same, and of making a high road through the Little Moor ; that the the mortgage on the poor-house should be discharged, in lieu of which the overseers should pay \u00a36 per annum to the minister, churchwardens, and vestrymen ; and that the remainder of the money should be placed in the funds, and tbe interest, with the \u00a36 above mentioned, distributed to such poor persons, male and female, as the lord of the manor or his agent, the minister, church \u2022 wardens, and vestrymen, and twelve other respectable inhabitants, should think fit ; such poor persons not receiving alms or parish relief, and so as no one should receive more than \u00a35 in any one vear : and it was provided that the oldest poor persons resident within the said township should be preferred, \"if they should be thought in all other respects proper objects of the said charity. The net produce of the sale is supposed to have been invested in the purchase of \u00a32314, 3s. lOd. stock in the three per cent, consols, in the names of the Rev. John Davidson, Edward Harrison and Robert Kipling, the minister and churchwardens at the time of tbe investment. The dividends amount to \u00a369, 8s. 6d. yearly, and to them is added the sum of \u00a36 above mentioned. Out of this income there is paid to eight poor men, \u00a35 per annum each, to other ei\u00b0ht poor men \u00a34 each, and to one old man (tbe last elected) the remaining \u00a33, 8s. Od. The same persons re- ceive the pensions for life, unless they become chargeable to the parish, in which case others are appointed. The payments are made half-yearly, on the 24th June and 24th December, on which day the electors meet. Dent's Charity. \u2014 William Dent the elder, of Brightwell, co. Berks, clock-maker, on April 29 and 30, 1706, assigned to trustees two several messuages or tenements and premises, situate in Cost Street, within the pa- rish of Stepney, co. Middlesex, for the educating of such poor boys as should be born in the town of Barnard Castle, with power to sell the same premises, and to lay out the produce in purchasing other houses or lands of the like value, in the county of York or bishoprick of Durham. These premises were sold previously to the year 1749, and the sum of ,\u00a3133 raised thereby was lent to John Dent, who became bound for the pay- ment of the said sum and interest to AVilliam Hutchinson of Barnard Castle. It is now in the hands of Miss Lee of Staindrop, daughter of the late Sir John Lee, who pays \u00a35, 6s. 8d. yearly as the interest. For the last few years, this sum has been paid to the treasurer of the National School in Barnard Castle, where ten children, named by the minister and churchwarden, arc taught free of any charge. Charities qf Lord Fane and IV. Hutchinson. \u2014 William Hutchinson, of Barnard Castle, July 30, 1718, gave \u00a320 to the poor of that place; and AVilliam Lord Arane A'iscount Duncannon left \u00a350 to the same purpose. These two sums form what is called the AVidow's Bread Fund. The first sum was laid out as mentioned under Sanderson's Charity, and 20s. is received yearly as the interest thereof. The remaining \u00a350 is in the hands of George Peter Hutchinson, Esq., of Eggleston, who pays \u00a32, 2s. yearly as the interest. AVith this income seven twopenny loaves are provided every Sunday, and given to seven poor widows attending divine service, who are selected by the minister and churchwardens. As this supply would amount only to \u00a33, 0s. 8d. per annum, the loaves are made rather larger, in order to make up the amount of \u00a33, 2s. Hutton's Charity. \u2014 Matthew Hutton, by wiil, November 19, 1726, directed his executors to lay out \u00a3120 in the purchase of lands and tenements in the county of A'ork or Durham, that the rents and profits thereof should be disposed of in buying bread, to be distributed every Sunday immediately after divine service amongst the poorer sort of housekeepers or other poor people of the town of Barnard Castle. In October, 1730, two closes in Startforth were purchased with this money. Upon the inclosure of Barnard Castle Moor, an allot- ment was set out in respect of these lands, which now contain 18 a. 2 r. 7 p- These premises have been let at \u00a314 a year, which is a fair rent. The tenant pays \u00a31, ls. 6id. every four weeks, in order to meet the expense of the bread, 5s. worth of which, in 30 twopenny loaves, is given away every Sunday by the sexton in the church, after morning service. The bread thus given away not consuming tbe whole of the rent, at the end of each year there is a double portion given away for one month, so as to dispose of the surplus. Township of Streatlam and Stainton. \u2014 John Bowes, Earl of Slralhmore, by will, July 3, 1817, di rected that the clear yearly sum of \u00a325 should for ever after be a charge upon bis Streatlam estate, and paid to or among the poor of Streatlam and Stainton. No distribution has been made in respect of this legacy. Manufactures, Trade, Institutions, Education, \u00a7c.

Ullathorn and Longstaff, and some others, are conducted on an extensive scale, and give employment to a great number of people. The waters of the Tee9 are supposed to be the best in England for dyeing ; and the goods manufactured here obtain the highest prices in the London market, on account of the brilliancy of their colours.* In treating on the manufactures of Barnard Castle, it would be unpardonable to omit that of gingerbread, with which most of the towns in this part of the kingdom are supplied. A market is held here every AVednesday, and four /airs annually, viz. on Easter and Whitsun- AVednesdays, for pedlery, &c. ; and on Magdalen eve and day, for horses, cattle, and sheep. A fortnight fair for cattle is also held on alternate AVednesdays. The tolls of the fairs and markets are farmed under the Duke of Cleveland. Petty sessions are held here on the first AVednesday of every month, when one or more of the following magistrates attend : \u2014 The Rev. John Headlam, Wycliff'e; the Rev.

Most of the windows on the opposite side of the street were broken, and several families near the place removed their goods and children, many of them nearly naked. The loss was estimated at \u00a31500. * In the great flood of 177L the water penetrated into some cellars occupied by a dyer at the south end of the bridge. A few pieces of tammies were in the kettle at the time, receiving their last process ; but the operator, not chusing to run the risk of destruction by attempting to remove them, retreated with the ut most celerity. After the torrent had subsided, tbe man with great anxiety visited the kettle ; when, on removing the sand and mud, the pieces were found to have attained a colour beyond his most sanguine expec tations. The articles were sent to London, and gave such satisfaction that orders were forwarded for a further supply of tbe same shade ; but the unlucky dyer, not being again assisted by the Genius of the river, failed in every subsequent attempt to produce it. + Sir John Hullock, Knt., Baron of the Exchequer, was born in the year 1764, and was son of Timothy Hullock, Esq., of Barnard Castle. In early life he entered at Gray's Inn, and was in due time called to the bar, at which he practised upwards of 20 years, with the reputation of being one of the soundest lawyers in AVestminster Hall. He does not appear, however, to have had much practice, until after the publication of his work on the Law of Costs. This brought him into notice ; and he rose by degrees to fill the second place (next to stir. Scarlett) amongst the counsel on the northern circuit. As an advocate, it was his practice to grasp firmly the strong points of an argument, and rest bis case upon them, instead of frittering away his strength, and weakening the impression, by an over-anxiety to anticipate every thing. Ofthe manliness of his character, the following anecdote has been adduced as a proof: \u2014 \" In a cause which he led, he was parti cularly instructed not to produce a certain deed unless it should be absolutely necessary. Notwithstanding this injunction, he produced it before it was necessary, with the view of deciding the business at once. On examination, it proved to have been forged by his client's attorney, who was seated behind him at the time, and who had warmly remonstrated against the course which he had pursued. Mr. Justice Bayley, who was trying the cause, ordered the deed to be impounded, that it might be made the subject of a prosecution. Be fore this could be done, however, stir. Hullock requested leave to inspect it ; and on its being handed to him, immediately returned it to his bag. The judge remonstrated ; but in vain. No power on earth, Mr. Hul lock replied, should induce him to surrender it : he had incautiously put the life of a fellow-creature in peril; and though he had acted to the best of his discretion, he should never be happy again were a fatal result to ensue. Mr. Justice Bailey, not sorry, perhaps, to have an excuse for assisting the design, continued to insist on the delivery of the deed, but declined taking decisive measures until he had consulted with the associate judge. The consultation came too late ; for the deed was destroyed without delay, and the attorney escaped.\" In the year 1816, Mr. Hullock was promoted to the rank of Serjeant-at-Law. During the few years that he remained Serjeant, he was engaged in several important causes. On the resignation of Mr. Baron Wood"], [261, "BARNARD CASTLE. 243 The banks of Messrs. Backhouse and Co., and Messrs. Skinner and Co., have long had branches in Barnard Castle. A Joint Stock Bank was commenced here in 1830, and has been highly suc- cessful. A Savings Bank was established on April 13, 1816; and in November, 1826, the depo- sits amounted to i?ll,689, 13s. 6d. From about the year 1828, however, its funds have gradually decreased ; and, at present (June, 1833), the amount invested is _P9H7, 4s. 2d., belonging to 308 depositors. There are branches of four fire and life insurances in this town ; also an Association for the Prosecution of Felons. The staff* of the Durham Militia is stationed here ; and by the late act of parliament \" for amending the representation of the people,\" Barnard Castle is appointed one of the polling places for the Southern Division of the county of Durham. Barnard Castle contains many good shops, belonging to grocers, flour-dealers, linen and woollen drapers, ironmongers, druggists, &c. ; and there are a number of smiths, machine-makers, joiners and cabinet makers, braziers, tanners and tawers, and other tradesmen and mechanics ; besides three printing offices. There are six corn-mills in the town and vicinity ;* and about twenty-five inns and public houses, a brewery, and several wine, spirit, and porter merchants. Since the opening of the Stockton and Darlington Railway, the facility given to the manufacturers and tradesmen of the latter place for the cheap conveyance of their goods, has operated injuriously to the trade of Barnard Castle; but it is not improbable, in the present age of speculation and im provement, that, in a short time, a branch of this medium of communication may be extended to this town, which will thereby participate in the advantages so widely diffused in the adjoining district. in 1823, stir. Serjeant Hullock was promoted to the office of one of the Barons of the Court of Exchequer \u2014 a situation which he held until the time of his decease, and the duties of which, it is allowed on all hands, he discharged in the most exemplary manner. Some few of his judgments may, perhaps, not be universally as- sented to ; but for integrity, sagacity, and knowledge combined, he has not left his superior. Mr. Baron Hullock had arrived in Abingdon, as one of the Judges of Assize of the Oxford Circuit, on Saturday, July 25, 1829 ; and on the Sunday he attended divine service at St. Helen's church, in apparently good health ; but in the course of that night be experienced a violent attack of cholera morbus. Notwithstanding the at- tendance of Drs. Ogle, Tomkins, and Turner (his family physician), he lingered till the evening of Friday, when he expired. On August 21, his remains reached Barnard Castle, and were deposited in tbe famiiy vault. A numerous concourse had assembled to view the procession, who all seemed deeply sensible of the loss that had been sustained by his death. Indeed, the poor of this town, where he generally resided during the summer months, have great cause to remember him, for he was to them a most liberal benefactor. A number of aged women, who had subsisted chiefly by his charity, voluntarily followed his empty carriage, while it was proceeding to his house after the funeral, weeping and deploring his death in the most affecting manner. An excellent funeral sermon was preached in the church on the Sunday following, by the Rev. John Davidson, from 2 Sam. iii. 38, \" Know ye not that a prince and a great man is fallen this day in Israel ?\" stir. Baron Hullock is said to have kept up his law reading to the last; not merely in reports, but text books. He published, \"The Law of Costs,\" 8vo. 1792; \"The Law of Costs in Civil Actions and Proceed- ings,\" 8vo. 1796; and another edition, in two volumes, 1810. He was recorder of Berwick, which he resigned, and was succeeded in 1810 by Christopher Cookson, Esq. His lordship had been many years mar ried; and bis lady survives him. \u2014 Ann.

Cook, the proprietor, and her two daughters, in endeavouring to remove what paper possibly could be saved, were soon enveloped in flames. The neighbouring farmers, after the alarm was given, were obliged to break in the shutters, and with much difficulty got them out of the place from the upper windows. Mrs. Cook was carried down apparently life less, and expired the next day ; her eldest daughter leaped out of one of the windows, but so much burnt that her life was despaired of; and the other was carried down in the same manner as her mother, nearly suffocated. vol. ii. 3 R"], [262, "DARLINGTON WARD.\u2014 S.

Efforts have recently been made to procure the patronage of the neighbouring ladies for a benefit-society for females, which, it is hoped, will soon be established. The National School was founded in 1814, by subscription, towards which the late bishop of Durham contributed i?100. The school-room is situated on the south side of the church-yard ; ancl the average attendance of scholars is about 160, including both boys and girls. (See page 241.)

On June 19, 1773. the Free and Accepted Masons of Barnard Castle walked in procession from their lodge, to lay the foundation stone. William Hutchinson, Esq.,\u00a7 master of the lodge, took his place in the procession, dressed in white and gold ; with Mr. * The first Sunday-school in Barnard Castle was commenced in the work-house by a poor man named AVilliam Emmerson, who, observing tbe want of education amongst the children employed in the manufac tories, assembled as many as he could for instruction on Sundays. His efforts were at first regarded with contempt, and he struggled on for some time amidst the derision of those around him. The effects of his perseverance, however, are now visible in the popularity of these institutions in this town. t While upon tbe subject of the iterature of this town, it may not be improper to mention Mr. AVilliam Alasey, who, on December 9, 1826, died at his father's house in Barnard Castle, after a few months' illness, aged 24 years. This young man, who bad been first a clerk in the office of Mr. Stokoe, attorney, New castle, and afterwards in the chambers of stir. Askew, counsellor, evinced considerable talents as a poet, a critic, and a moralist ; and although he did not leave much behind him, yet wdiat he did leave reflects honour on his memory. His last piece was an \"Address to the Breeze,\" written during his return from France, wdiither he had been in search of health. This blessing, however, was denied ; and, soon after his return, he fell a victim to a rapid consumption, which consigned him to an early tomb Selector, vol. i. p. 115. % So called from its vicinity to Egliston abbey, or priory, for Tanner calls it the former, and Leland the latter.

The piers are founded on the rocks on each side of the river, and are now completely covered with ivy ; while thick copses of trees and brushwood adorn the banks, and partially conceal the fanciful niches and jutting projections into which the rocks are split.

Amongst these may be noticed the tragedy called \" The Princess of Zanfara,\" written to expose the inhumanity of the slave-trade, but which, when offered to stir. Harris for performance, was rejected by him on account of its similarity to \" Oroonoko\" and \" The Revenge.\" Dr. Carr observes, \" All I can say of it is, that it is a much better tragedy than either stir. Harris has mentioned.\" In compiling his History of Durham, stir. Hutchinson was much assisted by his friend, John Allan, Esq., of Grange, who had himself projected a similar work. AVhen the two first volumes were completed, a dispute occurred between Mr. Hutchinson and his printer, stir. Solomon Hodgson, of Newcastle, respecting the pub lication of the third, the work having swelled out considerably beyond its prescribed limits ,* and Mr. Hut chinson instituted a suit at the assizes of 1793. On the trial, stir, (afterwards Sir Alan) Chambre led the cause on behalf of Mr. Hodgson, and holding up the well-known portraits which have since appeared in Nichols' Literary Anecdotes, said, \"This is the representation of Mr. Allan and bis amanuensis Mr. Hut chinson, and there is a dog placed between them. AVbat is the dog intended to represent \u2014 but my client, who has been used like a dog !\" The matter was referred to Mr. Raine, barrister-at-law, and a final period put to an expensive litigation. The property of tbe work and the impressions that remained unsold now became solely Mr. Hutchinson 's, who states in bis introduction to the third volume, printed at Carlisle, that after a labour of ten years, he was a loser of \u00a3100. Four hundred copies were afterwards purchased by Mr. Nichols, of which a considerable part were consumed by fire on February 8, 1808. Mr. Hutchinson corresponded with Mr. Grose and stir. Pennant ; the former of whom he furnished with a drawing of Finchale, and who in return presented him with a drawing of Alnwick Castle, but criticised with some severity on his View of Northumberland. \" At an advanced age, the faculties of Mr. Hutchinson continued equal to the business of his profession, which he still practised.

There are fourteen farms in this township, which is chiefly the property of the Duke of Cleveland. Streatlam and Stainton, This township contains the little village of Stainton, a castle and park at Streatlam, and a num ber of scattered houses, about 2 miles north-east from Barnard Castle. The village stands on the brink of several large freestone quarries, which have been wrought for the erection of many of the principal buildings of the neighbourhood, and from whence most of the stone for Barnard Castle was procured. In reference to these workings, this place is sometimes styled, in old records, Stain ton en les Craggs, and Stainton Law. Here are a school ancl a public house; and the township includes ten farms. Streatlam, or Street-le-ham, derives its name from its position on the Roman road between Binchester and Bowes. There was anciently a chapel here ; but no traces of it now remain. Streatlam and Stainton, with Broomlaw, Barforth, Cleatlam, Osmondcroft, and Huller Bush, were given by Barnard Baliol in dowry with Agnes his niece, on her marriage with Sir John Trayne, whose daughter and heiress married Sir Adam Bowes, great grandson of Sir William Bowes, cap- tain of 500 archers, and governor of Bowes Castle, Yorkshire.

His grandson, Sir Ralph, was upwards of 20 years sheriff of Durham ; and his son, also named Ralph, was knighted at the battle of Flodden, 1514. Sir George Bowes of Dal- den, successor to Sir Ralph, left three daughters, and the entailed estate of Streatlam consequently passed to a younger branch of the family, descended from Richard Bowes of Aske, whose son, Sir Georo-e Bowes, Knt., withstood the rebellious Earls of Northumberland and AVestmoreland, and was by special commission made Knight Marshal north of Trent, and, with his brother Sir Robert, appointed ambassador in Scotland. He married, first, Dorothy, daughter of Sir William Mallory, of Studley, co. York ; and, second, Jane, daughter of Sir John Talbot, of Albrighton, co. Salop. ; and died 1580. Sir William Bowes, Knt., son of the last Sir AVilliam, was ambassador in Scotland, and treasurer of Berwick until the dissolution of that garrison by King James.

It stands in a deep vale, a small brook [crossed by a neat bridge] runs close to its front ; high and irregular hills arise on every side, in some parts covered with a forest ; the whole aspect is gloomy and confined.

This parish is bounded on the south-east by the chapelry of Barnard Castle, on the north-east by the chapelry of Hamsterley and the parish of Stanhope, on the west by the imaginary line which divides the county of Durham from Cumberland, and on the south-west by the Tees, which sepa rates it from Westmoreland and Yorkshire. It includes four townships, viz. 1. Middleton ; 2. Eg gleston ; 3. Newbiggin ; and, 4. Forest and Frith. The entire parish, in 1801, contained 1843 inhabitants; which number, in 1811, had increased to 2218, and, in 1821, to 2866, consisting of 537 families, inhabiting 376 houses. Of these, 70 families were employed chiefly in agriculture, 245 in trade, handicraft, or in the lead mines, and the remaining 222 were cither engaged in pro fessional pursuits or unemployed. The annual value of property assessed to the county-rate, for the year 1828-9, was \u00a36655, 4s. The face of the country in this extensive parish presents a striking contrast to those parts of the county already described. At the distance of a few miles above Barnard Castle, the view on the Durham side of the Tees begins to wear a desolate aspect : trees are only to be seen within a few fields of the river, beyond which steep and lofty fells continue to rise above each other, uncheered by a single hedge-row, the inclosures being universally loose stone walls. Still the prospects on the south side of the river are beautiful for some distance ; until at length the whole becomes one vast and cheerless scene of solitary wildness. Though Middleton Fell does not exhibit the rug gedness of what is commonly called mountain scenery, there is, nevertheless, a considerable degree of sublimity in its lofty piles of hills, against which the clouds may be seen rolling or flying off in sheets of mist, thus accumulating the numerous becks or runners of water which run down between the eminences, or forming swamps in the hollows. In winter, snow-storms are here extremely dangerous; and in summer, the only vegetable productions are scattered clumps of whin-bushes, * In one of the apartments is a portrait of the celebrated Sir George Bowes, Knight Marshal, in the 58th year of his age ; also portraits of the late George Bowes, Esq., and his sisters."], [267, "MIDDLETON-IN-TEESDALE. 249 and coarse reedy grass ; the latter affording subsistence to a few sheep. The belated wanderer on these moors, as he toils from hill to hill in the hope of discovering a termination to his journey, or wades through the numerous intersecting rivulets and morasses which impede his progress, may well exclaim, with Goldsmith's pilgrim, \u2014 \" For here forlorn and lost I tread, With fainting steps and slow, AVhere wilds, immeasurably spread, Seem lengthening as I go.\" There was formerly a forest in upper Teesdale, the haunt of herds of deer. On Rood-day, 167-3, above 400 deer were destroyed here by a severe storm of snow. The native breed existed till lately ; and sometimes a stray one, from the parks of Scotland, is met with. The old road from AVestmoreland is now superseded by a new line, descending with a more gradual inclination, and passing by Tees Force to Bowlees near Newbiggin. A road was also formed a few years aco from the town of Middleton across the Fell to the village of Daddry-Shiels in AVeardale, and which is in general tolerably commodious, though some of the hills over which it is carried are so steep as to be rather dangerous. It is, however, in the bowels of the earth, and not upon its surface, that the industry of man has been here most successfully applied ; and the riches of the lead-mines in this district have well repaid his exertions. The river Tees, in its course along the verge of this parish, presents a succession of wonders. The Winch Bridge is said to have been the earliest suspension bridge in Europe, and was thrown across the Tees, at a place where that river falls in repeated cascades, for the convenience of persons employed about the mines. It was certainly in existence upwards of 80 years ago, thouo*h the precise date of its erection is unknown. The correct dimensions of this bridge, as o-iven by W. C. Trevelyan, Esq., in Brewster's Philosophical Journal, 1828, are as follow : \u2014 Ft. in. Length of bridge between the rocks, ... ... ... ... ... 59 4 Length of chain supported by the rock on the north side, ... ... 12 0 Length of ditto on the south side not visible, being covered with earth.

These chains were fixed by bolts into the rock at each end, ancl on them were laid wooden cross-rails 3j feet distant ; on these were laid deals lengthwise, forming a floor 1 ft. 9 in. broad, with a hand-rail 2 ft. 9 in. high on each side. Less chains were placed near the ends, and fixed to the rocks at a little distance to prevent the swinging; but most imperfectly was their office performed. -f- \"Let the reader then,\" says Mr. Sopwith, \" imagine so flimsy a fabric in so ruinous a state ; the chains decaying, the floor in some parts open, in others rotten, and the broken hand-rail on each side yielding as soon as touched; to these let him add the unearthly creaking * Some of the iron links, almost worn through, are preserved in tbe museum at AVallington. + About the end of August, 1820, a party of nine men and two women were passing this bridge from Hol wick to the Durham side, most of whom being upon it at the same time, the unusual weight entirely destroyed the balance ; and one of the chains being overstrained by a previous inclination to one side, it snapped, and three men were thrown into the Tees.

Still, however, the rapid motion of the foam beneath (especially during floods) dazzles the eye; ancl the roaring, dashing, ancl hissing of the water, as it bounds from rock to rock, stuns the ear; while the tremulous vibrations of the bridge render the footing seemingly insecure ; until the spec tator's head turns giddy, and he clings to the railing, glad that his reason corrects his senses, and that he is in reality safe. The High Force.\u2014 This sublime cataract is about 4 miles higher up the Tees than the Winch Bridge. Here tlie whole body of the river, augmented in its progress by numerous tributary streams, is hurled over a lofty precipice. Above the Force, the water is from 40 to 60 feet wide ; but, at the very edge of the fall, a huge castle-like rock rears its gigantic head in the middle of the stream ; ancl between it and the south shore, the river, circumscribed in its breadth, \" boils, and wheels, and foams, and thunders through,\" falling into a deep pool beneath. On the north side of the central rock, there is a narrow shelving fall, which is sometimes dry in summer, and may ge nerally be crossed with ease at the top. During extraordinary floods, however, the water has been known to overtop this rock, when the whole river descends in one vast sheet of foam. The entire height of the fall, at ordinary times, is about 70 feet. The height of the rock on the south side of the river above the surface of the pool is 90 feet, and the general depth of water below is 36 feet. An inn has recently been erected on the heights overlooking the Force, from whence may be had a beautiful view of the fall and the windings of thc river above it. A footpath descends from this place, and winds round the bottom of the precipices on the north side of the river, which are over hung with brushwood ancl a few ash and yew trees, and beautified with wild flowers, forming a striking contrast to the surrounding sterility. At the end of this path, a flight of rude steps de scends to ti e verge of the pool, where the spectator, within a few yards of the roaring flood, is in closed, as it were, in this awful theatre of nature's wonders. Bare perpendicular rocks rise on the opposite side of the river, the strata of which, as well as of the central rock, are strongly marked, and, with the perpendicular fissures by which they are intersected, look like the mighty masonry of a race of sjants. Another flight of steps and a footpath winds up the rock to the verge of the cliff; and, in dry seasons, the top of the central rock may be gained, from whence the spectator may view the torrent rushing into the boiling abyss below. \" Being on the giddy verge of so lofty a rock,\" says Mr. Sopwith, \" the rapidity of the stream, the thundering noise with which it mingles with the deep sullen waters below, and the clouds of foam which often reflect the iris' lovely hues, altogether combine to produce mingled sensations of terror, astonishment, and delight.\" Cauldron Snout. \u2014 About seven miles above the High Force, the waters of the Tees expand into a deep, lethargic lake, called the Weel, about two miles long and half a mile broad, formed by the interception of the river by basaltic rocks. The author of \" A Tour in Teesdale\" describes the face of tha country here as follows : \u2014 \" The conception of a scene so wild and magnificent, is difficult. * \" An Account of the Mining Districts of Alston Moor, AVeardale, and Teesdale, in Cumberland and Durham, by T.

The whole length of this fall, from the commencement of the declivity to the bed of the stream below its last precipitation, is 596 yards. The view from the foot of the cascade is thus described by the writer just quoted : \u2014 \" The awful ancl tremendous grandeur of the sight that arrests your attention is almost more than the mind can bear : a painful, pleasing expan sion of heart \u2014 that internal sensation and best criterion of the true sublime \u2014 seizes you with instan taneous and overwhelming energy. Directly before you, the river is hurled headlong down, from rock to rock, in a deep recess, through the declivity of a mountain, all but perpendicular, for seve ral hundred feet ; and if it is possible that the horror of this scene can be aggravated, it is so by the uncouth aspect of the surrounding objects. This is the only situation of easy access, and safe enjoyment when gained : you command at once the whole view of this astonishing cataract ; the course of its wildly dashing stream not being in a direct line, but in many a devious bound. Ascend the hill to the wooden bridge, which you will see at a dreadful height, and in the most romantic position, near the top of the fall. It is a single plank, but broad and firm, with a railing (which has been lately placed) on each side, so that you may safely cross it. The stand in the centre is sublime indeed ! Not wholly divested of a sense of personal danger, you look downward, directly through a shaggy cleft, on the tumbling waters, wetting you with their spray, and shooting in their most impetuous career, white as snow, and swifter than an arrow, beneath your feet.\" The course of the Tees, from its source in Yadmoss in Cumberland, is environed with lofty round-topped fells, intersected by mountain streams.* Middleton. This territory anciently belonged to the Baliols; and, with the other estates forfeited by the Earl of AVestmoreland, is now (with the exception of Eggleston and a few smaller portions) the property of the Duke of Cleveland, whose possessions extend from Piercebridge to the extreme western verge of the county, a distance of between 30 and 40 miles. The town of Middleton is situated 10 miles north-west from Barnard Castle, 12 miles south-west from Stanhope, and 253 miles north-north-west from London. Though it stands near the wild uncultivated fells above described, the scenery in its immediate vicinity is extremely pleasant, and the surrounding moors impart to it a romantic character. The houses are scattered along the sides of hills, in no part forming a regular street of any considerable length. Robert Stagg, Esq., prin cipal agent to the London Lead Company, has a handsome residence at the west end of the town. This gentleman has greatly improved the adjoining ground, and transformed an uneven boggy waste into smooth and beautiful lawns. The Baptist Chapel, a neat structure, was also erected by him in 1829. The Wesleyan Methodists have had a chapel here about 30 years ; and the Primi tive Methodists also erected a chapel a few years ago. * \" Yade more,\" saith Leland, \" hath the hede of Tees.

A market is held here every Saturday ; and on alternate Sa turdays it is well supplied, and numerously attended by the miners, who receive their wages once a fortnight. Three annual fairs are held, viz. on the third Thursday in April, the 7th day of July, and the second Thursday in September. Here are six inns and public houses, with several shopkeepers and mechanics. A corn-mill is worked by the Hudshope Beck, which flows through the town to the Tees. A handsome stone bridge of one arch, 80 feet in span, was erected across the river, about 20 years ago, by public subscription.* The Governors' School was erected by the London Lead Company. Its dimensions are 20 yards by 12 ; and in winter it is warmed by stoves. The average number of scholars, boys and girls, is about 150, each of whom pays ls. per quarter, orphans and the children of widows excepted. The system of education is nearly similar to that used in the National Schools. -f A Sunday-school is held in this building, which is attended by about 250 scholars. There are in Middleton four other academies and schools. The Company's Library, containing several hundred volumes, is kept in their offices, and is free to their workmen ; but other persons pay ls. per quarter each. There is also a subscription library, containing about 130 volumes, at Mr. Jonathan Horn's, the parish clerk ; and a reading and neivs room has recently been established. Middleton is one of the poll ing places at elections for the Southern Division of the county of Durham. Masterman Place, or, as it is sometimes called, New Middleton, was erected in 1823 by the London Lead Company, from the chaste and appropriate designs of Mr. Bonomi, and under the direction of Robert Stagg, Esq. It consists of several uniform rows of neat and convenient cot tages, situated in a spacious garden, a portion cf which is appropriated to each dwelling. The increasing population of Middleton had considerably enhanced the rents of dwelling-houses there; and it was to diminish this burden that the Company built Masterman Place, in which, as vacan cies occur, they place their most deserving* workmen; thus combining general utility with the re ward of individual merit. The first occupiers took possession of their new abodes in May, 1824, accompanied by bands of music, &c. The rent of each cottage and garden is \u00a34> per annum. The beneficial effects of the regulations adopted by the London Lead Company towards their workmen, are strikingly apparent in the general decorum anc! good behaviour visible in Middleton. t * A previous bridge, built in 1811, fell when nearly completed. Richard Attee, a butcher, who was in tbe habit of crossing between Middleton and Mickleton in A'orkshire, had frequently predicted its fall, and, at the time of this catastrophe, happened to be on tbe spot with bis wife. Full of liis favourite theme, he ven tured beneath it to point out its imperfections ; when his wife perceived the structure moving, and instinc tively rushed forward to drag him from his perilous situation. At that instant the bridge fell and destroyed them both, in tbe presence of numerous persons who had assembled to view the tottering fabric. + By the Company's regulations, the children of tbe miners must attend the school until they are nine years of age : they are afterwards employed in washing the lead ore during the summer months, and in win ter again attend school. At the age of fourteen, they work in the mines in winter, and wash the ore in summer ; pursuing their education in the Sunday-school. They are also required to attend one or other of the places of worship in Middleton every Sunday until they attain the age of eighteen, when they undergo an examination on subjects connected with the scriptures, and are considered as regular workmen. X This was particularly exemplified in December, 1832, when, for the first time, this town became the scene of an electioneering contest. On this novel and exciting occasion, scarcely a single instance of intoxi cation was to be seen ; and a person concerned in the management of the election, disappointed by the total"], [273, "MIDDLETON-IN-TEESDALE. 253 Drunkenness and quarrelling are punished with immediate dismissal ; and in other respects a strict but salutary discipline is preserved. Each man pays 30s. a year to a general fund, and receives therefrom, during sickness or inability to work, 8s. per week for six weeks, and afterwards 6s. per week as long as he continues incapable of following his employment. At 65 years of age, each miner is allowed 5s. per week for life. The Company, at their own expense, provide medical as sistance in addition to the above, not only for the men themselves, but in every case that it is needed by their wives and families. It is, therefore, \" with longing, lingering looks behind,\" that any of the miners leave their situations; and they generally endeavour, as soon as possible, to return to them again. The Church This church, with \" two oxgangs of land, a toft, and a croft,\" were part of the possessions of St. Mary's at York, the abbot of which formerly presented at the nomination of the Baliols, for the bishop of Durham's institution. At the forfeiture of the Earl of Westmoreland, the right of pre- sentation was vested in the crown. The church is an antique structure ; and a small square tower, containing three bells, stands at some yards distance. The principal entrance is by a south porch, under a pointed arch. An aisle on the south side of the nave is formed by two circular arches and a wide elliptical one ; the first pillar being cylindrical, and the second oblong, of massy dimensions. The chancel is entered by an elliptical arch. The east window and three on the south side of the chancel are under pointed arches ; but the lights of the nave and aisle are irregular. The font is a bason cut in the top of an upright cylinder. There is a niche under a pointed arch on the south side of the altar-table, and a piscina within the door which opens from the chancel to the north. Above the entrance into the vestry is a large stone, sculptured with a sword, an ornamented cross, &c. ; and there is a nearly similar stone over the south entrance of the church.

School This school was founded by indentures of lease and release, 18th and 19th March, 1729, by Christopher Stephenson and Mary his wife, Robert Hoggart and Elizabeth his wife, and Margaret Robinson and Grace Robinson, sisters and coheirs with the said Mary and Elizabeth of William Robinson ; the rec tor of stliddleton-in-Teesdale, the rector of Stanhope, and the rector of Wolsingham, to have the nomination of the schoolmaster. Hutchinson says that the lands settled on this school were ofthe yearly value of about \u00a320, which the worthless heir, a plumber in London, diminished by various litigious suits, with an intention to frustrate the charitable purposes of his ancestors, on account of some legal informalities in the settlement. Parish Land. \u2014 There is in the township of Middleton a parcel of land, containing 6 A. 1 B. 6 p., on which is built a workhouse, which receives the poor of the four quarters of the parish, each quarter paying a certain sum per week for every pauper sent there. It is not known how this land originally came to the parish. Perkins Charity. \u2014 Thomas Perkin, of Hudgill, by will, February 9, 1711-12, gave to John Allanson his dwelling-house and close, commonly called Hudgill Close, containing by estimation 3 acres, paying yearly to the poor of Middleton township 5s., to the poor of Newbiggin township 10s., and to the poor of the Forest township 10s., to be paid the 29th November. The premises are now the property of Thomas Robinson, of Hudgill. No payment having been made of this rentcharge for 14 or 15 years, the Commissioners for inquir ing concerning Charities directed a letter to be written to stir. Robinson, inclosing a copy of the will of Tho mas Perkin ; and by his answer, dated December 24, 1828, he declared his intention of resuming the payment from that time, when called upon by the parish-officers. Township of Middleton. \u2014 Poor's Stock. \u2014 The sum of \u00a354 poor stock was, in 1764, put out to interest in the hands of the trustees of the turnpike road between Appleby and Kendal. The interest, \u00a32, 14s. per annum, has been improperly carried to the general account of the poor's rate. Township of Eggleston. \u2014 Sanderson's Charily, see page 240.

The interest, amounting to 17s- per annum, is now disposed of accordingly. Township of Newbiggin. \u2014 School. \u2014 AVilliam Tarn, by indenture, July 18, 1799, gave \u00a3400 three per cent, consols, upon trust, to the Draper's Company of London, from the annual dividends of which 20s. was to be deducted for expenses, and tbe remainder paid to the rector and churchwardens of Middleton, to be applied, in the first place, in providing a competent supply of coals or other fuel for the use of the school at Newbiggin, and that they should pay the remainder of the dividends to the schoolmaster of the said school for his own use, deducting half a guinea, to be presented to the curate of Middleton, for examining the chil dren educated in the said school, on the Sunday nearest to the 2d day of July (being tbe birth-day of the said William Tarn), in the church of stliddleton-in-Teesdale, and for preaching a sermon there upon the occasion. The sum of \u00a311 is received annually about July from the Draper's Company, on sending them a receipt signed by the curate and churchwardens. After deducting 10s- 6d. for the examining curate, as above prescribed, tbe remainder is paid over to the schoolmaster, on his agreeing to supply the school well with fuel ; and the churchwardens think it a part of their duty to see that a good fire is kept. The school is taught in a building belonging to the township. There are 50 children in it on an average, all of whom pay for their instruction. Lind's Charily. \u2014 Cuthbert Lind left \u00a340 to the poor of this township, producing \u00a31, 12s. 6d. annually. This money has been improperly carried to the account of the poor-rates. Poor's Slock. \u2014 About \u00a320 poor stock belonging to Newbiggin is mentioned in the parish books ; but there is now no trace of it. Township of Forest. \u2014 The Poor's Stock of this township is stated in the parish books to amount to \u00a339, 10s. ; but there is not now any money out at interest, nor has any interest been paid to the poor in respect of it since 1/80. Harwood School. \u2014 Robert Brumwell, in 1724, left \u00a380 for instructing the poor of Harwood. During the time of stir. Emerson, a former rector, in whose hands the money was placed, no interest was paid for five years; and the interest being added to the principal, became \u00a3100. The interest of this sum, at \u00a34 per cent, is regularly paid to the schoolmaster, who is also the minister of the chapel, in equal portions, by the Rev. I. Headlam, archdeacon of Richmond, Dr. Headlam, of Newcastle upon Tyne, and J. Ingram Esq. formerly of Staindrop. The trustees of Lord Crewe's charities have for many years given \u00a35 annually to the support of this school. The children of the township are all instructed free, by means of a voluntary payment by the Duke of Cleveland, by whom the school was built on his own land."], [275, "MIDDLETON-IN-TEESDALE. 255 The extensive lead-mines and works at Manor Gill ancl Lodge Syke, about a mile and a half north-west from Middleton, belong to the London Lead Company, who now occupy nearly the whole of the mineral district in Teesdale. Forster, in his Section of the Strata, enumera es 38 mines here ; but this number is continually varying, by the opening of new mines, and the working out of old ones.* Stotley Hall, an old mansion, at present used as a farm-house, stands to the east of Middleton. It anciently belonged to the Cumins, and is now the property of John Bowes, Esq., M. P. ; as is Foggyforth, or Foggerthwaite, which was successively in the possession of the Scroops and Tem pests. The Hope farm, to the north of Middleton, anciently belonged to the monastery of Rivaulx, and, after the dissolution, became in succession the property of Tailbois of Thornton, Clervaux of Croft, and Tempest. Eggleston. This manor formed part of the forfeited possessions of the Earl of AVestmoreland, and was pur chased from the citizens of London, in 1631, by John Child, of the Inner Temple, Esq., and Da niel Britain, citizen and vintner. In the following year, they conveyed it to Tobias Ewbank, of Staindrop ; and, after belonging to the family of Sanderson, it became, in the beginning of the last century, the property of an ancestor of the present proprietor, George Peter Hutchinson, Esq. The manor renders 3s. 4d. yearly to the lord of Barnard Castle, and is free of toll there. The village, township, and chapelry of Eggleston is situated 4 miles south-east from Middleton, and 6 miles north-by-west from Barnard Castle. It is inclosed by lofty hills on the north, and slopes down towards the Tees, having a rivulet running through it. Eggleston Hall, the seat of G. P. Hutchinson, Esq., is a handsome building, in a style well suited to so wild a region as sur rounds it. The pleasure-grounds are most judiciously and tastefully disposed, containing an arti ficial waterfall of considerable height, and a subterranean walk, which has been blasted in the rock on the river's side. The chapel of ease to Middleton stands in the centre of what was laid out by the late Mr. Hutchinson as a botanic garden ; and is a small neat building, consisting of a nave and chancel, with a little cemetery attached. The living is a curacy, not in charge nor certified; but it has been augmented by Queen Anne's Bounty. The rector of Middleton is patron ; and the Rev. Richard Thompson is the present curate. The following inscriptions are on mural mo numents in the chancel : \u2014 \"Here lies the body of William Hutchinson, Esq. who departed this life the 8th of August, 1749, aged 68 years.\" \"Sacred to the memory of AVilliam Hutchinson, Esq1* who died July 31st* 1769, in the 39th year of his age.

Here are a public house and a few mechanics ; and the township includes eight farms.* Eggleston smelt-mill, the property of the London Lead Company, was erected a few years ago, under the immediate direc tion of Robert Stagg, Esq., and is undoubtedly the most complete establishment of the kind in the north of England. The situation is so chosen, and the building so constructed, that the ore may require no lifting, but descend from process to process until it is brought out as lead at the lower part of the mill. \" A mile to the north of the village of Eggleston,\" says Hutchinson, \" above a little brook, stands an ancient monument, called Standing Stones. It has consisted of an uniform circle of rough stones, with an inward trench, and in the centre a cairn ; much of the materials have been taken away to repair the roads. At a small distance, and close by the brook, is a large tumulus, crossed from the east to the west by a row of stones. The adjacent ground, forming an inclining plain, was proba bly the field of battle, and the monuments mark the place of interment of some distinguished chief tains. There is no circumstance in history which we can, with any certainty, fix here. The monuments are of distant antiquity.\" Other writers, with some plausibility, imagine that this is the remains of a small Druidical circle. Newbiggin Is a village and township, 2\\ miles north-west from Middleton, where there is a small old Wes leyan chapel, a school (see Charities), a smelt-mill, a public house, and a few tradesmen. It is principally the property of the Duke of Cleveland; but the Rev. J. Headlam, of AVycliff'e, has some possessions here. Fokest and Frith This extensive township commences about 4i miles north-west from Middleton, and terminates on the borders of Westmoreland, near the source of the Tees. Harwood is a large district, occu pying the western extremity of this township, where there are many lead-mines, in which a consi derable number of the inhabitants are employed. There is a chapel of ease here, which was rebuilt by subscription in 1802, and has been above 30 years under the ministry of the Rev. George Car pendale, who receives a yearly allowance for his pastoral duties from the Duke of Cleveland. Be sides the school taught by Mr. Carpendale (see Charities), there is another at Low Forest, the master of which receives a quarter-pence from the scholars, and the Duchess of Cleveland makes out his income. The duke has a sporting seat, called Grass Hall, in this township. There are numerous farms, principally occupied by miners, and consisting chiefly of pasture and meadow land. The tenancy is said to be scarcely less hereditary than the proprietorship, several farms having been transmitted from father to son from many generations. The houses are for the most part extremely rude in their construction ; but their being whitewashed partly redeems the poverty of their aspect, and this operation is said to be always performed, with becoming loyalty, on the approach of the duke to the moors in the shooting season. -f- * Destructive fires occurred here on November 5, 1743, and September 27, 1769. The latter was sup posed to be the work of incendiaries. t Sopwith's Account ofthe Mining Districts, p. 144."], [277, "DARLINGTON WARD. NORTH-WEST DIVISION.

Much of the country in this parish displays scenery similar to that already described in the account of Middleton-in-Teesdale.

W. D. 258 Stanhope. The name of Stanhope is derived by Hutchinson from Stone-hope, the fortified hill, or Stand hope, the hill where the inhabitants made their chief resistance against an enemy. This idea is furnished by an eminence at the west end of the town of Stanhope, and lying between it and the Wear, called the Castle Hill, or the Castle Heugh, which is 108 feet high above the river, with a ditch across the crown of the mount, and around the summit of which the remains of a strong wall have been discovered. A castle is mentioned here in the time of Bishop Beck. By Boldon Book, there were 20 villains in Stanhope, who each held one oxgang of land, render ing 2s. with 16 days' works of one man, between Pentecost and Martinmas: each villain led the lord's corn four days with one carriage, and made four portions of seed land ; mowed two days, when he received a corrody, and made and led the hay, having a loaf on leading days, as well for corn as hay ; carried and re-carried, between Stanhope and Wolsingham ; and carried the game killed in the forest to Durham and Auckland. Moreover, at the great hunt, they erected, for the entertainment of the prelate and his suite, a kitchen, larder, and dog-kennel ; and prepared beds or couches for the hall, chapel, and chamber; and brought all the provisions for the lodge. The sons of Gamel de Rogerley and others held lands by the service of providing a man 40 days in the forest at fawning time, and the like at rutting time, and going on messages ; others prepared the seed land in autumn. Aldred the smith had 12 acres at 3s. rent, and others on various duties. Lambert the marble cutter had 30 acres of land for his stipend, whilst he wrought in the bishop's service. AA'illiam AArilde, as headborough man, held a toft, a croft, and seven acres of land for his service. All the tenants and villains repaired the mill-dam ancl brought the mill-stones. The punder had six acres of land and the customary sheaves of corn, and rendered 40 hens and 400 eggs. By Hatfield's Survey, the bishop's almoner held 100 acres of land in Rookup at 2s. rent. New landside was held by AVilliam Merley, at 6s. 9d. rent, and Huckleyfield at 2s. rent. Roger de Dirlton held Bolyopeshele, at 6s. 8d. rent ; Robert Todd, Horseleyburn-field, at 12d. rent ; Richard Dowy, Moreland, at 3s. rent; Thomas Marshall, Harlaugh, at 12d. rent; Thomas Rogerley, New field, at 6s. 8d. rent ; John de Merley, Josyanbanks, at 2s. 3d. rent ; John Blackhead, Wodcroft, at 13s. 4d. rent; and AVilliam Featherstonhalgh, three acres on Callandland, eight acres on Stan forland, and three acres in Feryfeld. The master of Greatham hospital held a pasture for cattle on Swynhoplaw. The parson of Stanhope held a close of land, called Migge Close, of five acres, at 20c!. rent, Le Frith, at 2s., and parcel of the Ele, containing one acre, at 4d. And there were fourscore acres of land, called Steward Hall, formerly of Gerard Sharrom, and afterwards of Ber tram Monboucher, Knt., which used to render 20s., but were then waste; as were also the lands of John Ykeland of Bedyk, which formerly yielded 13s. 5d. Numerous proprietors occur here at various times, amongst whom were a family named Stan hope ; though it does nut appear that they were at all connected with the present family of that name. The Powers, Littleforths, Merleys, Bedales, Collinsons, Emmersons, and Dawdrys, held divers possessions here. The family of Featherstonhaugh had considerable estates here from the time of King Stephen; and Thomas Featherstonhaugh, Esq., of Stanhope Hall, who married Anne, daughter of John, and sister of Sir James Clavering, Bart., was elected M. P. for the county of Durham in 1679. The last of the family was slain at the battle of Hochstet, and the estate was purchased by the Earl of Carlisle. Stanhope Hall, the ancient seat of the Featherston-"], [279, "STANHOPE. 259 haughs, stands to the west of the town. It is a lofty quadrangular building, supported at the corners by buttresses. The balustrade, &c. which formerly adorned the roof, are now removed ; and the house is occupied by two farmers. From the Earl of Carlisle this estate was purchased by the ancestor of the present proprietor, Cuthbert Rippon, Esq., M. P. for Gateshead. The ancient town of Stanhope is pleasantly situated in AVeardale, 21 miles east-south-east from Alston, 15 miles west-north-west from Bishop Auckland, 20 miles west from Durham, and 265 miles north-north-west from London. It was so considerable in the time of Cardinal Lano*ley, that in 1421 he ordained a weekly market on Friday, and two annual fairs. Dr. Basire, in 1669 ob- tained a patent for reviving the weekly market, which is still continued ; ancl there are now three fairs here yearly, viz. on the Wednesday before Easter, on the second Friday in September, and on the 21st of December. The September fair is for the sale of cattle, ancl the others for the sale of pedlery, &c. The town consists principally of one long street, through which passes the road from Durham to Alston. A small plain cross stands where the market is held, near which was formerly a wooden shade for the market-people; but this is decayed and fallen down. A fine ter- race runs along the south side of the town, on which stand the Castle, rectory, and several other neat houses. The Wesleyan Methodists have had a chapel in Stanhope between 30 ancl 40 years, to which a Sunday-school is now attached. A Subscription Library is kept in the National School, where the schoolmaster attends for the receipt ancl delivery of books every Friday evening, from six to eight o'clock. A Savings Bank has existed in this town for some years; the funds of which, in 1827, amounted to \u00a3'4600; but at present, owing to the decline of the lead trade and some other causes, the deposits do not exceed ,\u00a32000. Here are five inns and taverns, two corn-mills, and se- veral shopkeepers, tradesmen, and mechanics. The magistrates who attend the petty sessions at Stanhope on alternate Fridays are, the Rev. AV. N. Darnell, A. M. ; Cuthbert Rippon, Esq., M. P. ; and the Rev. William Wilson, of AVolsingham. Stanhope Quarter includes about twelve farmsteads. Stanhope is one of the polling places at elections for the Southern Division of the county of Durham. The Church Is situated on rising ground to the north of the town, and consists of a low square western tower, a nave with regular side-aisles, and a chancel. The roof of the nave rises steeply, and the ridge forms a curve. The tower is supported by a pointed arch ; and its lights are narrow, with circular tops. The aisles are formed by four circular arches, supported by cylindrical pillars ; and there is a pointed arch over the entrance into the chancel, on the north side of which is a porch under an elliptical arch. The chancel is railed off from the nave, and stalled with ornamented seats in the cathedral fashion. The east window and two on the south side of the chancel are divided into compartments under circular arches, and contain some very fine and perfect specimens of stained glass. The nave is lighted by windows under circular arches. There is a gallery at the west end of the church ; and texts of scripture in the old English character, some of them partially defaced, are placed in various parts of the interior. There are no monuments in the church.* The church yard is adorned with some very fine trees.**}- There was a chantry in Stanhope church, dedicated to St. Mary, value \u00a310, 10s. * An ancient custom still prevails here of decorating the church with evergreens at Christmas. + In June, 1752, Ann Myers died at Stanhope, in her 106th year. She had her memory perfect to thc last, and could read small print without the aid of spectacles until within two years of her death. vol. ii. \u2014 39. 3 X"], [280, "260 DARLINGTON WARD.\u2014 N.

Votum solvens lubens posuit.* The living of Stanhope is one of the richest fti the kingdom. Its revenue principally arises from the mines in this extensive district, of the produce of which the rector receives the ninth part, and the bishop of Durham the tenth. The value of the living has been variously estimated, from \u00a36000 per annum upwards ; but it is evident that it must fluctuate with the trade from whence it is derived. ** Gent. Mag. 1749, p. 449. \" Is it possible,\" says Hutchinson, \"a boar was such excellent game, that an altar should be raised in commemoration of the conquest ? It is more probable, and more just to the charac ter of a leader of Roman cavalry, to presume some enemy of greater consequence was typified by the figure of the boar. In all the Scotch excursions, we find that figure cut on the monuments, to distinguish the northern people; and the situation ofthe altar encourages the idea.\" On the other hand, however, mytho logy, history, and romance, combine to attest the importance which was attached to the conquest of wild animals ; and the later adventures and charters of Pollard's Land and Ferryhill in this county (which see) are so strikingly in point, as to afford a strong presumption in favour of a literal acceptation of this in scription."], [281, "STANHOPE. 261 Charities. > Hartwell' s School\u2014 The Rev. William Hartwell, D. D., rector of Stanhope, by will, March 9, 1724, de- vised his estate in Fishburn, then rented at \u00a380 per annum, to such charitable uses as were thereafter men- tioned ; viz. for the benefit of two tradesmen, to be appointed by the corporation of Durham ; two exhibitioners from the schools of Durham and Newcastle ; the widows of two ministers of the diocese of Durham ; tbe debtors in Durham gaol; and a schoolmaster in Stanhope, and other purposes. By a codicil, recitXthat he had lately purchased, at the east end of the town of Stanhope, a little bouse and garth, he thereby appro- priated the same, after the decease of the then possessors, to the use of the schoolmaster for the time beinn* (endowed by him in bis will) for his convenience and better subsistence, that he might not have lod-rino* and school-rooms to seek ; and for repairing the same, and fitting up the school-room with seats for tbe scholars, he left \u00a320, to be under the direction of his executors, or whomsoever they should appoint. The dean and chapter of Durham, in pursuance of the directions of the testator, act as trustees of this charity. Weardale Schools.\u2014 In 1819, Bishop Barrington, with the sum of \u00a32000, purchased \u00a329.57, 9s. 8d. three per cent, consols, in the names of Lord B irrington, William Keppel Barrington, and Georo-e Ba'rrino-ton, and directed that the dividends of the same might be applied for the promotion of the moral and religious educa- tion of the children of the poor within the diocese of Durham, by assisting in the support of certain schools for poor children in AVeardale, which the said bishop was then forming. In the same year, the bishop pur- chased of Joseph Harrison and others a parcel of ground at or near AVearshead in AVeardale, of George Col- lingwood a parcel of ground at Boltsburn in AVearhill, and of George Humble a parcel of ground containing one rood or thereabouts at Heathery Clough ; also a parcel of copyhold land in Stanhope from Cuthbert Rippon and others ; and he caused a school, with proper buildings attached to the same, to be erected on each of tbe said parcels, at the expense of about \u00a32000. The following schools, which are now principally supported with the funds of this charity, and under the management of its trustees, were founded and endowed before the bishop's charity was created. Westgate School. \u2014 Rich_rrd Bainbridge, April 7. 1681, granted a customary tenement in Weardale, called Field Stile, to trustees, for a term of 16 years from the time of bis death, to the following uses, viz. after the payment of his debts, for the raising so much money out of the rents and profits as could be during the said term, as a fund for the maintenance of a schoolmaster to teach and instruct the poor children of the parish of Stanhope at Westgate. On May 1, 1700, the sum of \u00a370 had been received on this account, wherewith cer- tain lands were purchased. The property now belonging to the school consists of \u2014 1. A meadow in AVest- gate, containing about 4 acres, let to a yearly tenant at a fair rent of \u00a314. 2. Part of a field called Crooked Salter, lying undivided from the rest of the said field, and from which a yearly rent of 18s. 9d. is derived. 3. The sum of \u00a350 secured by bond, and producing \u00a32, 10s- interest. This money arose from the sale of an allotment, containing 7 a. 2 r. 12 p. 4. The old school-house, the upper part of which the present master has as part of his salary, and tbe lower part is let at the fair yearly rent of \u00a33, 10s. These several sums are paid over to the treasurer of the funds appropriated to the support of tbe AVeardale schools. The buildinn* now used as a school was much enlarged at the expense of the late bishop of Durham ; but the work was badly done, and it has since required repairs to a considerable amount, which bave been paid out of the rents above mentioned. The school is now under tbe direction and control of tbe trustees of the AVeardale schools, from whom the master receives a salary which far exceeds the annual income of the old foundation. Boltsburn School \u2014 May 15, 1762, George Collingwood bargained and sold to Edmund (Keene) bishop of Chester, and rector of Stanhope, and bis successors, rectors of Stanhope, a piece of ground at Boltsburn, con- taining in length 10 yards, and in breadth 6 yards, and all the buildings erected thereon, and intended for a school-house, in trust, that thev should from time to time appoint a proper person to be a schoolmaster, who should enjoy the said house rent-free, keeping the same in repair, such schoolmaster to be removeable for misbehaviour at the discretion of the said rector for the time being. The building is now used as a dwelling- house, a new school having been erected at Boltsburn by the late Bishop Barrington. The house is let at the rent of \u00a32, 10s., which is paid to the treasurer for the funds derived from the late bishop for the schools in AVeardale, out of which funds a schoolmaster receives an annual salary. Chapel School \u2014 There is no permanent endowment to this school except a house, which was formerly used as a school, but is now let at \u00a36 a year, a new school having been built by the late bishop of Durham. The rent is received by the treasurer of the funds provided by the said bishop for the schools in Weardale, and out of those funds the master receives a salary exceeding the amount of the rent above mentioned. Dr. Harlwell's Charity. \u2014 The Rev. AVilliam Hartwell, D. D., by will, bearing date as before mentioned, also gave to the use of the poor of Stanhope a house and garth, in the town of Stanhope, then rented by hia curate at \u00a37 per annum ; and he directed that the said rent should be employed in binding out two poor"], [282, "262 DARLINGTON WARD\u2014 N. AV. D. children yearly, lads and lasses, to some useful trade or business, by which they might get a livelihood with out begging ; and the care of this he left to the rector, curate, or four-and-twenty ; but that if any curate of the said church should thereafter think the said house and garth convenient for his abode, it should be let to him by the rector at the usual rent of \u00a37- The old cottage which formerly stood upon these premises, being in a ruinous condition, was pulled down by the late rector some years ago, and a new house erected by him at an expense of upwards of \u00a3840, tit for the residence of one or two curates, as the circumstances of their families might make it convenient. There are now two curates licensed for the parish of Stanhope, one of whom resides in the house lately built, and enjoys the two fields, which contain about 3 acres, paying to the other curate in consideration thereof \u00a315 a year, and the yearly sum of \u00a37 to the rector, wherewith two ap prentices are placed out every year. The rector sees that the indentures are properly executed, and the children bound to trades whereby they may afterwards obtain their own livelihood. Barrick's Charity. \u2014 Ralph Barrick, by will, May 26, 1689, gave \u00a320 to the poor of the parish of Stan hope, for a continuing stock, that the interest should be duly paid by his executors every AVhit-Monday to the churchwardens and overseers of the parish of Stanhope, to be distributed to the most needful poor of tbe parish at their discretion. This legacy is supposed to have been laid out in the purchase of stints or pasture gates in Westernhope Common; and it is said that about 30 years ago an allotment of about 10 acres was set out in lieu of these stints. The owner of this allotment pays 20s. yearly in respect thereof to the chapel warden of St. John's chapelry, who disposes of it to poor persons within the chapelry. Chapman's Charity. \u2014 Barbara Chapman, who died May 3, 1829, by her will directed her executor, Tho mas Greenwell, Esq., to purchase so much stock three per cent, consols as would produce in yearly dividends \u00a320, to be invested in the names ofthe rector of Stanhope and her executor, and their successors, upon trust, to bestow the yearly sum of \u00a36 on the education of four poor boys of the parish of Stanhope in the English school there, and the further yearly sum of \u00a36 upon the education of four poor boys of the said parish in the school at Frosterley ; the remaining \u00a38 to be distributed yearly on St. Thomas's day (or, if on a Sunday, on the Saturday preceding) amongst such poor persons belonging to the low quarters ofthe parish, and in such proportions and manner, as they, the trustees, should deem proper, stir. Greenwell purchased \u00a3666, 13s. 4d. stock accordingly, in the names of himself and Dr. Philpotts; and the children were nominated in October, 1829, and placed in the schools at Stanhope and Frosterley. Lost Charities. \u2014 The sum of 20s. yearly was paid till within the last few years to the chapeiwardens of St. John, by \u2014 AVatson, owner of an estate in Weardale, called Froghall. AA^atson is now dead, and since bis death payment has been refused, nor is there any evidence as to the origin of the payment. Several other charities are mentioned in the Parliamentary Returns of 1786; but there is no trace of any payment having been made with reference to any one of them within the last 45 years, or any evidence to support a claim to them at the present time. Township of Frosterley. \u2014 School. \u2014 John Hinks, by will, January 8, 1735, bequeathed \u00a3120 to the townships of Frosterley, High Bishopley, and Low Bisbopley, towards making, erecting, and maintaining a free school in Frosterley ; and he appointed \" six of the principal freeholders within the said townships\" to be joint trustees of the said principal sum ; and he thereby excluded the lord of tbe manor and his successors, and their stewards and agents, from having any thing to do therewith, until they should give or procure to be given another sum of \u00a3120 for the augmentation of the endowment of the said intended free school. In November, 1773, this legacy formed part of the purchase-money (\u00a3200) of a messuage or tenement with a garth in Frosterley, and three parcels of ground there, called Smiddy Croft, Bottlingham, and Mill Eale. The school was built by subscription in 1747, at an expense of \u00a390, 10s., on land given for the purpose by Thomas Todd. The estate now consists of two cottages, a byre, and about 4 acres of land, let at a high rent of \u00a321. There is also an allotment of about 6 acres made to the school land out of Frosterley Intack, which was inclosed about 20 years ago, This is let at a fair rent of \u00a311, Ils. a year. This land was exonerated from the land-tax by a certificate of the commissioners, December 16, 1814. Mary Todd, who died Decem- ber 12, 1824, by will gave \u00a3200 to be placed out on government security, and the interest applied to teach eight poor children at Frosterley. Of this legacy \u00a320 was paid for the duty, and tbe residue was invested in the purchase of \u00a3198, 3s. lOd. stock in the three per cent, consols, in the names of Thomas Emerson, ex- ecutor, and Dr. Philpotts. The income of the school arises from these sources ; and there are six acting trustees. There is a residence for the master, together with a garden adjoining the school-house, which he occupies rent-free ; and he receives a salary of \u00a320 a year. For this sum he instructs six children free, who are appointed by the acting trustees, in rotation, from the townships of Bishopley and Frosterley ; and for the other children in the school he makes a charge, the amount of which is settled by the trustees. The master's sister lives with him, and instructs, in respect of Mary Todd's legacy, eight girls of the same townships, who are appointed by Mr. Emerson. She receives a salary of \u00a310, and takes other girls also, for whom she charges a limited quarterage. A considerable sum has recently been laid out in repairs."], [283, "STANHOPE. 263 Morgan's Charity \u2014 Thomas Morgan, by will, May 10, 1641, conveyed to trustees certain premises in Frosterley, and also reserved to the same trustees a rent-charge of 20s- payable out of the lands called Barns Eale ; and the trustees were directed to pay the yearly sum of 20s. to each of three almswomen, the price of 20 horse loads of coals and the carriage thereof, and the expenses of the repairs of the messuage which was to be used as an alms-house. And he desired Mr. Ferdinando Moorcroft, and his successors, rectors of Stan- hope, from time to time to see the said poor women elected, their allowance duly paid them, and their house repaired ; for which the trustees should bestow in largess of him 5s. a year. The property which belonged to the testator consists of a dwelling-house, stable and out-buildings, with about 9 acres of freehold land now belonging to George Goligbtly. There is also an alms-house, consisting of two rooms, in which three poor women of Stanhope reside rent-free. Mr. Golightly appoints these alms-women, and pays to each of them 25s. yearly, of which sum 5s. is considered as an allowance in lieu of coals. He also defrays all the expenses of repairing the alms-house, and he rebuilt it about 15 years ago. The rector of Stanhope has not been in the habit of visiting this institution ; the allowance therefore of 5s. granted to him yearly for visiting has not been paid- Stanhope Castle. \u2014 The original part of this edifice, built by the late Cuthbert Rippon, Esq., consists of a square pile of building, of two stories in height, and fronting the south, with two se- micircular projections on each side. To the east the present proprietor has added an elegant con- servatory, leading to a lofty square tower, which is occupied by an extensive museum, and lighted by large and elegant windows divided into Gothic compartments. The entrance to this tower, in consequence of the declivity on which it and the conservatory stand, is in the second story, around the interior of which is a beautiful gallery of brass, from whence a geometrical staircase descends to the repository of mineral curiosities. The upper walls are covered with splendid specimens of ornithology and other rarities. From the centre of the roof a large and elegant brazen chandelier is suspended by massive chains. The whole reflects credit on the taste of the spirited proprietor. All the towers and surrounding* walls of the Castle are embattled. From the main entrance on the ***> south of the original building, a road winds through the pleasure-grounds on the west, and over an arch which crosses the road through the town of Stanhope. In the gardens are extensive green houses, with quadrant roofs, &c. ; and the adjoining masses of trees are happily arranged. The Heatherburn Caves, and Linkirk, or Fairy Holes, axe at a short distance to the north of Stanhope. They consist of curious natural grottos, formed by fissures or shakes in the limestone rocks, and are open for near a mile in length, \" where Nature, in all her gloomy sport of subterra nean magnificence, displays the wonders of the Peak and other celebrated caverns.\" Unthank lies on the south side of the Wear. In Bishop Skirlaw's time, William de Marley the elder died seized of this manor and its appurtenances. His descendants falling into female issue, it passed by marriage to AArilliam Maddison of Aldergill, in whose family it remained for several generations. It afterwards passed to the Westgarths, and is now the property of \u2014 Hildyard, Esq., of Stokesley.

About 50 children are educated here, for ls. 9d. per quarter each, at the National School, wddch was built by the late bishop of Durham, and is now used on Sunday afternoons as a chapel of ease, divine service being performed in it by one of the curates of Stan hope. Here are also a Methodist chapel, a public house, a smith's shop, and a few tradesmen and mechanics.

The line of this spirited undertaking, which is entirely a private speculation, will proceed nearly north from Stanhope to the millstone quarries about 3 miles distant. Turning to the east, it will pass by Mainsfield and Knitsley, and then nearly north-east to Stanley. Hence, in an easterly direction, it will cross the parish of Chester-le-Street, about a mile to the north of that town, and proceed till it approaches the AVear nearly opposite Penshaw; where, turning north-east-by-north, it will cross directly over, by way of West Boldon, to the east end of South Shields ; thus completing a line of nearly 35 miles. By it a ready conveyance to the sea will be provided for the lead of this district, as also for the excellent limestone which abounds here ; while it will materially benefit the coal districts through which it passes. Foreign timber, deals, and every other kind of merchandise, may with ease be forwarded up to every part of its line. It is likewise in contemplation to con struct a branch from near Old Durham, by way of Rainton and across the Wear, to the nearest point of approximation between the Stanhope Railway and that river ; but the preliminaries of this latter undertaking, which will require the sanction of parliament, are not yet matured.

It contains a number of scattered houses, the village of AVestgate, and part of the hamlets of East gate and Rookhope ; including thirteen farms ancl three corn-mills, two of which are at Westgate. In Stanhope Park the bishops of Durham held their great chace, the services towards which have frequently been quoted from old records ; and the tenants who held of the bishop, on his summons, erected a tabernacle for his reception, and resorted hither with horses and dogs, bringing the ne cessary provision of the household, and doing other services appendant to the chace. The bishops had here their master of the forest and bow-bearer, as also a park-keeper, a pale-keeper, and other officers for their forest and parks. In this liberty they had their moor-master, or manager of their mines, coroner, bailiff, receiver, ancl other inferior officers ; and exercised therein all royal privi leges. In 1327, the English army encamped in Stanhope Park, and the Scots on the hills opposite, without coming to an engagement.* * The king of Scotland had determined to wrest, if possible, from the young King Edward a renunciation of that superiority which had been claimed by his father and grandfather ; and accordingly an army of 24.000 men, under Randolf and Douglas, crossed the Borders, and ravaged the county of Cumberland. Edward waited six weeks at York, waiting for the arrival of his forces. At. the suggestion of Mortimer, he had pur chased for \u00a314,000 the services of John of Hainault and a body of foreigners. The proceedings of this in glorious campaign are thus described by that luminous historian, Lingard: \u2014 \"At length the English, amounting to more than 40,000 men, marched to Durham, but were unable to obtain any certain intelligence of tbe enemy. An army of Scots was peculiarly adapted for predatory excur sions. It consisted entirely of cavalry, and was unincumbered with provisions or baggage. Their drink was the water of the river or brook, their meat tbe cattle of the country, which they slaughtered, and then boiled in the skins : and they carried with them a scanty supply of oatmeal in a bag, which each horseman attached to his saddle. The velocity with which they advanced or retreated was such, as to make it difficult either to discover or pursue them. On the fifth day, intelligence reached the king, that the enemy were burning the villages at a distance of 10 miles from the city. The army was immediately in motion, and marched in three divisions, in each of which the infantry occupied the centre, with the cavalry on its flanks. Orders had been issued that no man should quit his banner under the penalty of death. In this manner they advanced for two days without overtaking the Scots : on the second evening it was resolved to gain by a rapid march the left bank of the Tyne, and to intercept the return of the enemy. AVith this view the baggage and provisions were conveyed back to Durham, and no man was permitted to carry with him more than a single loaf tied to"], [285, "STANHOPE. 265 Westgate. \u2014 This village is situated 5^ miles west of Stanhope. Leland says, \"The bishop of Duresme hath a praty square pile on the north syde of Were ryver caullid the AVestgate, and thereby is a parke, rudely enclosid with stone, of a 12 or 14 miles in cumpace; it is xii miles up in Weredale from Akeland castelle.\" There are now no traces of the tower mentioned. The AVes leyan and Primitive Methodists have chapels here, each capable of containing about 500 persons. The National School affords instruction to about 100 children, at ls. 9d. each per quarter. Here are four public houses, and a few shopkeepers and mechanics. Stanley was anciently the estate of the Lumleys and Nevilles. Forest Quarter This large district extends from Park Quarter to the borders of Cumberland, ancl includes the market-town called St. John's Chapel, several hamlets, and a number of scattered houses. There his saddle. They set out at midnight ; rode all day in a straight line over mountains and valleys, heaths and morasses ; and a little before sunset crossed the river at the town of Haydon. Here they remained seven days, still ignorant ofthe motions ofthe enemy, and sutfering from the continual rains and the want of pro- visions. The soldiers murmured ; suspicions of treason were circulated in the camp ; and Edward by procla- mation promised the honour of knighthood, and an annuity of \u00a3100 for life, to tbe first man who should bring him intelligence of the Scots. The army now recrossed the river ; and on the fourth day, about three in the afternoon, Thomas de Rokesby, galloping up to the king, said, 'Sire, the Scots are at the distance of three leagues, posted on a mountain, where for the last week they have expected you. I have seen them myself, having been made prisoner, and released, that I might claim the reward which you promised.' Edward im- mediately turned to the neighbouring abbey of Blanchland, where he spent tbe night, and with many of his friends prepared himself by devotional exercises for tbe expected battle of the next day. \"In the morning Rokesby led the army towards the Scots. They were encamped in huts on the summit of a mountain on the right bank of the Wear. At the sight of the English they formed themselves on foot in three divisions on the declivity, with the river between them and tbe enemy. Edward ordered his men to dismount, made several knights, and rode through the ranks attended by bis principal lords. After a short pause, the army marched slowly to the bank of tbe river : but the Scots remained immoveable in their position ; and an English herald was sent to propose, that one of the two nations should retire to a certain distance, and allow its adversary to cross the water, and form on the opposite bank. Douglas replied that he had come there against the will ofthe king, and should not leave the mountain to please him. If Edward were not content, he might cross over, and drive him away if he could. On the receipt of this uncourteous answer, the English were ordered to lay all night on their arms. The Scots, leaving a division to watch the river, retired to their huts, ' where,' says Froissart, in his quaint style, ' they made marvellously great fires, and, about midnight, set up such a blasting and noise with their horns, that it seemed as if all the great devils from hell were assembled together.' Tbe two following days were spent in tbe same manner: but on the third at dawn the Scots had disappeared. They were discovered in the afternoon, posted on another moun- tain of still more difficult access, and on the same side of the river : and the king following, pitched his camp in Stanhope Park, opposite to the enemy. In the midst of the night an alarm was created by shouts of * A Douglas, a Douglas ! die, ye English thieves.' That gallant chieftain had passed tbe river at a distance with 200 followers, and entering the rear of the camp, galloped towards the king's tent, tbe cords of which he cut with his own sword. He killed about 300 men, and retired with some loss. The object of this nocturnal visit was soon explained. The next day, Edward learned from a prisoner that the whole Scottish army had received orders to assemble in the evening, and follow the banner of the Lord Douglas. Apprehensive of a nocturnal attack, he called his troops under arms, and appointed them their stations during the night. All was tranquil and silent : in the morning two trumpeters were brought in, who declared that the Scots had left their camps at midnight, and were on their march towards Scotland. But the English disbelieved the account, and remained the greater part of the day in the same position. At length the fact was ascertained : to pursue a more active enemy, who was already at the distance of 30 miles, would have been a fruitless task ; and the army marched back to Durham, and thence to York, where it was disbanded. Such proved the lu- dicrous result of this mighty expedition, in which the English commanders were foiled by the superior skill and activity of their foes.\""], [286, "DARLINGTON AVARD.\u2014 N. AV.

Newlandside Hall, an ancient estate of the AVards, is the seat of John Rippon, Esq. Frosterley is a village and manor 2 miles south-east from Stanhope, belonging to Cuthbert Rip pon, Esq. Ranulph Cant held Frosterley by Boldon Book ; after which, the families of Bradley, Dewy, and Morgan, held possessions here ; and the manor for some time belonged to the Swinburns. There was anciently a chapel at this place ; but it has long since gone to decay, though its scite is still called the Chapel Close. The Rev. W. N. Darnell, rector of Stanhope, has recently erected a small neat chapel of ease here, which will shortly be opened for worship. The Wesleyan Metho dists have also a chapel at Frosterley. The village contains two public houses, two blacksmiths' shops, and a few tradesmen ; and there is a day-school, besides the free-school mentioned under the Charities. The bridge over the Wear at this place was carried away by the great flood of 177jj but was shortly after rebuilt. High and Low Bishopley is a district 2A miles east from Stanhope. PARISH OF WOLSINGHAM. The parish of Wolsingham is bounded on the north-west by Stanhope, on the north-east by Lan chester, on the east by Brancepeth, on the south-east by the chapelry of Witton-le-Wear, and on the south by Hamsterley. It is divided into four constableries or quarters, viz. AVolsingham, Wolsingham Park, and Wolsingham East and South. The number of inhabitants in this parish in 1801 amounted to 1834, and in 1811 to 1923; but in 1821 they had increased to 2197, compris ing 476 families, inhabiting 390 houses. The annual value of property assessed to the county-rate for the year 1828-9 was \u00a310,101, 10s. AVolsingham. By Boldon Book, the villains held 300 acres, rendering nine marks ; they cut and carried all the bishop's corn within the manor of Wolsingham, with the help of the lord's bondmen ; mowed all the meadows of Bradley, and won and led the hay ; wrought nine score clays at the lord's command, carried six score loads of wood, and prepared the seed land at Brandwood, with all their house hold, except housewives; prepared four portions of seed land at Wolsingham, when they received a corrody ; and when they mowed and carried the hay and corn, they had each a loaf of bread. AVilliam Presbyter and Jacob his son held lands, rendering a rent in money. Walter Crok and others for their lands went the bishop's messages, and superintended the villains at mowing and reaping. Roger de Bradley held lands in Bradley by service ofthe forest 40 days in fawning time, and 40 days in rutting time, and by fencing and keeping Bradley meadows. Roger de Roangers held under the forest service ; Ralph the bee-keeper held six acres ; Adam the headboroughman vol. 11. 3 Z"], [288, "DARLINGTON WARD\u2014 N.AV.

The punder had six acres, and rendered 40 hens and 400 eggs. The demesne was farmed out, and rendered 16 chalders of wheat, the like of barley, and 70 chalders of oats. Henrv Pudsey, nephew to Bishop Pudsey, founded and began to erect a religious house at Backstaneford, near AVolsingham ; but he was induced to discontinue its progress here, and to fix upon the more eligible situation of Finchale for the scite of his monastery. The remains of a con siderable edifice, enclosed by a deep moat, are still visible here, adjoining to a field called the Chapel-garth, the supposed scite of the intended institution. By Hatfield's Survey, AVilliam Jebbeson held the manor of Wyshill, and lands formerly Robert Scot's, and made forest service for the same, viz. 40 days in the fawning time, and 40 days in rut ting time.

The service of the cottagers was the carriage of the bishop's hawks, cleaning the manor-house for the reception of the lord and his ministers, assisting to clean the mill pool, going on the lord's errands, attending the lord's chace, and working at hay. The services of the bond-tenants were nearly similar to those noted in the Boldon Book : they held amongst them a piece of land called Bradshaw, another piece called Medhop, a pasture called Gosecroft, and 20 acres called Harekar. There was a manor-house, with a garden and orchard, and three acres of meadow land appertaining ; also a park, 8:} miles in circuit ; and several cow pastures, as Jeff'eleys, Townstedhouse, Farneyley, and Blackburn Tonges. Besides the persons named in the Survey, sundry others are mentioned holding in capite, as Matilda, the daughter of Thomas, the son of Philip de Frosterley, Roger Kitwryght, Thomas the son of Theobald, Richard de Blackhead, Catherine o' the Ele, John de Bradley, and several others, whose estates were of no great value. New Minster, in Northumberland, had possessions at AVol singham, of the gift of the bishops of Durham. The principal proprietors in this parish at the present day are, the Countess of Coventry, Anthony AVilkinson, Esq., and T. Bowes, Esq. In 1765, an act of parliament was obtained for dividing and inclosing 10,000 acres of common here ; and, in 1769, two separate acts were obtained, for dividing the town-fields and the moor in the township of Thornley. The town of AVolsingham is situated on the north bank of the AArear, at the point where it re ceives the united streams of the rivulets of Thornhope and Weserow,* 16 miles west from Durham, 23 miles south-south-west from Newcastle, and 260 miles north-north-west from London. Mr. Turner says, \"The views down the Wear from the hill above AVolsingham are sufficient to excite an ardent curiosity to trace that beautiful river from this place to its junction with the sea.\" The principal street of the town, which lies on the road between Durham and Stanhope, contains many * In 1810, a bridge was erected over the latter stream; and in 1817, another bridge, which crosses it at Uppertown, was taken down and rebuilt."], [289, "WOLSINGHAM. 269 good houses, and is tolerably paved; and there is a good bridge over the Wear.* The first stone of the Town Hall was laid in 1824; but, for several years afterwards, this building remained in an unfinished state for want of funds. It is, however, now completed, and is a neat edifice; the upper story being used as a news-room and for public meetings, and the lower part for depositing stalls, &c. Some old cottages formerly stood in the market-place, where they formed an awkward obstruction ; but they were purchased, a few years ago, by the Rev. William Wilson, rector of Wolsingham, who, at his own expense, had them taken down, and the space cleared for the market. f There are in AVolsingham chapels belonging to the AVesleyan and Primitive Methodists ; and the Baptists, who previously met in a licensed room, erected a neat chapel in 1830. Forty or fifty poor girls are instructed at a charity-school, which is supported at the sole expense of the Misses Wilson, of AVolsingham ; and there is a respectable seminary for young ladies, besides five or six day-schools. About 160 children attend the Church and Methodist Sunday-schools of this place. A subscription library was commenced here in 1826; and though, for the sake of general useful ness, the terms were fixed so low as 6d. per month, it is supported with laudable spirit, and now contains about 200 volumes. A market is held here every Tuesday,* and eight annual fairs at the following periods, viz. on the 12th of May and 2d of October for toys and pedlery ; and on the Tuesdays before the 1st and 31st of March, and before the 12th of May, 15th of September, 29th of October, and 23d of No vember, for cattle, &c. ; but not many of the latter are now brought hither. The first hiring for servants and cattle show was held November 15, 1763. Here are thirteen inns and taverns, two bar-iron manufacturers, three edge-tool manufacturers^ and several stone-masons, joiners, smiths, shopkeepers, and other tradesmen and mechanics. A building for a workhouse was purchased in 1772.11 * An old bridge was swept away by the great flood of 1771- The present structure was commenced shortly after, and the centres were taken out ofthe arches on September 10, 1772. t To prove the high estimation in which their venerable pastor is held by his parishioners, they presented him, in 1831, with an elegant silver tureen, bearing the following inscription: \u2014 \"Presented to the Revd* AVilliam AVilson, M. A. rector of AVolsingham in the county of Durham, by his parishioners, as a testimony of their affectionate regard and gratitude for his many acts of kindness, and bis zealous discharge of the duties of bis profession as their minister, during an almost constant residence of 44 years, and also for his impartial attention to their peace and comfort as a magistrate, 27th June, 1831.\" X In 1795, corn being very dear, the gentry in this neighbourhood purchased rye and barley at Newcastle, and sold it at AVolsingham at reduced prices. Though there was an abundant harvest, the market-prices, in consequence of the proceedings relative to tbe currency caused by the war, were still kept up ; and on October 29, the inhabitants of Stanhope and its environs (mostly miners) came into AVolsingham in great numbers, and, being joined by some of the town's people, took the corn by force from the farmers, and sold it in the market for 10s. 6d. or 12s. the boll, instead of 16s. or 20s. (tbe price demanded), returning the money to the farmers. They also took the butter from the deale. s, selling the pound of 20 ounces for 8d. instead of lid., and returning the money. A part of the machinery belonging to two mills was broken, and some other trifling damage done; but it does not appear that any legal measures were ever commenced against the actors in this affair. \u00a7 On May 26, 1812, the Society of Arts presented a gold medal to stir. Thomas stlachell, of AVolsinghr.m, surgeon, for the invention of an annular saw, which cuts deeper than its own centre, well adapted for the division of cvlindrical bones, surrounded by muscles, blood-vessels, or nerves, and with less injury to those parts than by any other instrument in use. || In December, 1786, Ralph Wilson died in the workhouse at AA'olsingbam, in his 101st year."], [290, "DARLINGTON AVARD\u2014 N.

He also receives the rents of the land belonging to the school, the whole of which now lies on the south side ofthe river; an exchange having been made many years ago for the benefit ofthe school. At the time of the Commissioners' inquiry, 1828, the rental amounted to \u00a356, 10s. In respect of this foundation, the trus- tees have directed that 18 boys of the parish should be instructed free, in writing, reading, and arithmetic, and classics if required. They are not admitted under nine years of age, and remain for three years. The master receives also \u00a33, 10s. per annum as the interest of \u00a3100 left to the school by Jonathan Wooler in 1789, and \u00a34 per annum as the produce of a similar sum left by George AVooler in 1826. In respect of each of these two sums, he instructs four children of persons not receiving relief from the parish, appointed by tbe respective trustees, in the same manner as the 18 appointed on the old foundation. He has also about 30 day scholars, and 10 or 11 boarders in his house; be keeps two assistants, one for teaching writing, and the other for mathematics. Charities qf Markindale and others. \u2014 There is some land in Wolsingham, known by the name of the Poor's Land, which was left by Markindale, Astley, and others unknown, for the use of the poor of AVolsingham. One parcel, called Leadgate Field, contains 1 a. & 10 p., and is let at \u00a35 a year. Another parcel, called the Low Field, containing 4^ acres, is let together with an allotment of 3 a. 1 r. 10 p. (set out on an inclosure in respect ofthe other lands above-mentioned) at a good rent of \u00a312 a year. The rents are paid to the church- warden, and distributed on St. Stephen's day by the parish officers with the assistance of the curate, to such poor persons of the parish as are thought most deserving. The produce of the two charities next mentioned, amounting to \u00a32, 3s. 4d. a year, are added to this ; and 2s. or 3s. is given to each person. Clarke's Charity. \u2014 George Clarke, in 16/6, gave 3s. 4d. yearly to the poor, payable out of land possessed by John AVren. This sum is paid by John Wren Jackson, in respect of a field in Wolsingham. Ayre's Charity. \u2014 John Ayre, by will, in 1685, left \u00a32 yearly to the poor, payable out ofthe Havre Field. This field, consisting of about 4 acres, now belongs to AVilliam Henderson, by whom the rent-charge is paid. Charities of Gordon and Nowell The Rev. Robert Gordon, who died in 1780, by will directed his execu- tors to invest \u00a3200, and to lay out the annual produce for the benefit of the poor of tbe parish of AVolsingham. This legacy was laid out in the purchase of \u00a3272, 2s. 2d. stock in the four per cents, which have been since reduced to three and a half per cent. On November 29, 1780, the Rev. AVilliam Nowell, rector of AVolsing- ham, transferred \u00a3200 four per cent, bank annuities into the names of the same trustees, for the benefit of the poor of the parish. The executors of John Bowdler, Esq., the last trustee, are possessed of both these sums, the dividends on which, amounting to \u00a316, 10s. 6d. per annum, are remitted annually to the rector of Wolsingham. The amount is distributed generally in March, after notice given in the church, chiefly amongst such poor householders residing in and belonging to the parish as receive no parochial relief. The sums given to each family vary from 2s. to 5s. Jonathan Wooler s Charity. \u2014 Jonathan Wooler, who died August 3, 1789, by will left the interest of \u00a3100 to the grammar school of Wolsingham (which see), and the interest of \u00a3100 to poor widows who should have no relief from the parish. AVith these legacies \u00a3200 stock was purchased in the four per cents, since reduced to three and a half per cent. In the distribution of the moiety of the dividends, \u00a33, 10s., none receive the benefit of the charity but suqh poor widows as belong to and live within the parish and receive no relief, and the number is restricted to 20. The money is divided annually by the rector and trustees, on the Friday in Easter-week, into nearly equal sums. In general the number relieved has been about 12. George Wooler's Charity. \u2014 George Wooler, by will, May 12, 1826, bequeathed two several sums of \u00a3100 to the same purposes as the last-named charity. They have been invested in the purchase of \u00a3200 stock in the new four per cents; and \u00a34, one moiety of the dividends, is paid to the master of the grammar school, and the other moiety is distributed to the same persons that receive the above charity.

East Quarter Extends eastward from Wolsingham to the distance of 5 miles, and contains the village of Thorn ley, a corn-mill at Bradley, a number of scattered houses, and a landsale colliery at Helm-park, where there is a public house. The constablery includes 21 farmsteads. Thornley, 3 miles east from Wolsingham, contains a subscription school, built in 1824, to which the trustees of Lord Crewe's charities contributed \u00a320, and which is now used as a chapel, divine service being performed in it every Saturday evening by the curate of Wolsingham. Here are a public house, and two blacksmiths' and a cartwright's shops. Thornley and Greenwell, with Helm park and Redmyr, were part of the possessions of the Nevilles, and were forfeited at their attain der. Small Lees, or Poor Lees, was granted, April 28, 13 Henry VIII., by Robert How and his wife to John Hall, to the use of \" the church-wark and ornaments of St. Nicholas' church in Dur ham.\" Redgate House, a mile north-east from Wolsingham, is the residence of Mr. George Emerson. Bradley anciently gave name to a resident family ; but, at the time of Hatfield's Survey, it was held by Ralph Eure, of Witton, who rendered for it 22s. ; holding therewith Sunningside, containing 200 acres, at 20s. ; and Kittespark and Walkerland, at 6s. rent. In Bishop Langley's time, Sir Wil liam Eure obtained licence to embattle and fortify the house. In the reign of Queen Elizabeth, Bradley had become the estate of the Tempests, and was forfeited by the attainder of Robert Tem pest and Michael his son for engaging in the Northern Rebellion. It was granted as a reward to Sir George Bowes, of Streatlam, whose lineal descendant, Thomas Bowes, Esq., of Durham, is the present proprietor. Bradley Hall lies in a fine valley, in a retired and romantic situation. The house has been extensive, and fortified by deep moats and a strong curtain wall. The more an cient part was probably erected in the reign of Henry VI. ; but an elegant projection in the front is apparently in a more modern style than the rest of the building. All the lower apartments are vaulted ; but the whole has been long neglected and falling to decay.* South Quarter. This constablery extends from AVolsingham to the distance of 4 miles southward, and contains Wolsingham Common, the corn-mills of Holbeck and Goosecroft, a blacksmith's shop, and eighteen farms. Holbeck House, in a gloomy situation to the south-west of Wolsingham, was the ancient seat of the family of Craggs, and latterly the property of the Boweses. Wyshill, or Wyserley, named in Hatfield's Survey, is now divided between Mr. Joseph Stobbs and Mr. William Hender son. Brandwood anciently gave name to a resident family, from whom a moiety of it passed by marriage to the Eglestons ; but it subsequently belonged to the families of Dawson and Moses. * Cut-throat House is a ruinous cottage in this lordship, on the south side of the Wear, and derives its name from one of those deeds, the result of an aberration of intellect, at which human nature revolts.

The chapelry of Hamsterley forms part of the parish of St. Andrew's Auckland, and is bounded on the north by the parish of Wolsingham, on the west and south-west by Middleton-in-Teesdale, on the south by Cockfield and Staindrop, on the south-east by thc chapelry of St. Helen's Auck land, and on the north-east by Witton-le-Wear. It contains three townships, viz. 1. Hamsterley; 2. South Bedburn; and, 3. Lynesack and Softley. The population ofthe chapelry, in 1801, was 1318; in 1811, 1552; and in 1821, 1650, consisting of 345 families, inhabiting 328 houses. The annual value of property assessed to the county-rate for the year ending January 12, 1829, was \u00a3\u20226998, 4s. 3|d. Hamsterley. This vill was anciently part of the possessions of the Eures, who continued to hold it for many generations. The Lumleys and Boyntons also held lands here. An extensive tract of land in Hamsterley was formerly called the West Park. Sir AVilliam Chaytor, Bart., of Witton Castle, is now the principal proprietor in this township. The village of Hamsterley is pleasantly situated on the summit of a steep hill, 7 miles west-by north from Bishop Auckland. Here is a Baptist chapel, erected by subscription in 1774, with a small endowment, a library, a burial-ground, a school-room, and a house and garden for the mi nister,* which office is now filled by the Rev. David Douglas, who keeps a boarding-school. The Wesleyan Methodists have likewise a small chapel in this village. A school was built by subscrip tion in 1822 ; but it has not been well attended, and is now unoccupied, in consequence of the death of the Rev. Thomas Gibson, the late master. There is, however, another day-school here. Ham sterley contains three inns and public houses, and a few mechanics and shopkeepers; and the * stir. Isaac Garner was the son of a minister of this chapel. His parent died during his childhood ; and he was apprenticed in the printing-office of the Newcastle Journal, in which paper first appeared the early effusions of his muse. He went to London soon after the expiration of his apprenticeship, where he married \u25a0a respectable woman wdth a small fortune, and commenced business on his own account ; but, being irregular and inattentive, his trade soon declined, and a domestic quarrel caused a final separation between him and his wife, though they had two children. About the commencement of the French war, he was engaged as captain's clerk on board the Hind frigate, destined for the West Indies, where she was stationed about two years. During this time, at the request of the captain and other officers, he wrote \" The Hind, or a Voyage to the West Indies,\" a poem. He returned to London about 1795, and worked at his own business ; but he soon became a soldier in the Middlesex militia, in which he continued till the peace of 1801, when the regi ment was discharged. In 1802 or 1803, he was employed on the Tyne Mercury newspaper, Newcastle, when he wrote a curious poem, addressed to the editor, entitled \" An Epistle to your Dog,\" alluding to the cut of a dog with a book open before him, which was generally placed at the head of humourous stories, wonders, jests, &c- in the newspaper. He was afterwards employed at several different places, but returned to New castle in 1813, where, after working a short time in the office of Messrs. Mackenzie and Dent, he died on the 13th of October in that year, in the 55th year of his age. Among his poetical pieces were some of consider able merit. In addition to those already mentioned may be noticed, \" The Splendid Guinea,\" which first appeared in a Whitehaven newspaper in 1811 ; \" A Sonnet to the Rainbow ;\" \" Epitaph on John Simpson, of Hamsterley, Woolcomber ;\" and \" Verses written on the Banks of the River Eden.\" Though latterly some what eccentric in his manners, the conversational powers of Mr. Garner were of no ordinary description."], [294, "I DARLINGTON WARD\u2014 N.

It stands about half a mile from the town, and is a neat building, in the form of a cross, with a low western turret. The entrance is by a south porch, inclosing a circular arch. The transept is entered by a pointed arch ; and there is a holy water bason on the south side of the chancel.

The present trustees, appointed February 27, 1819, are Lowis Walton, Michael Garthorn, James Hewitson, and Jonathan Kendal. The Bull Piece and the allotment are let together at \u00a316 a vear, which is paid half-yearly to Jonathan Kendal, who lives in the township of Lvnesack and Softley.

It is given away, in the three places above mentioned, to poor persons belonging to the respective townships, in sums varying from 3s. to 10s. South Bedburn Is a village and township, occupying a romantic situation betwixt the river Wear and the Bedburn rivulet, 4 miles south-by-east from Wolsingham. At the north-western extremity of this town ship, and within 300 yards of the Harehope-burn, a small stream which rises in the adjoining hills, is a remarkable piece of antiquity called \" Hie Castles.\" It consists of a fortified enclosure, at the foot of a high ridge of hills : its form is oblong, of about 90 paces by 70- It is defended on every side by a lofty mound or vallum of loose pebble stones, with an outward ditch. On the side where the gate or entrance is, a little stream of water runs down a deep gill, where perhaps a bridge or platform of trees or hurdles, easily removed or destroyed, was used. The interior plain is capable of receiving 500 huts, so that the fort, if it may be so termed, would secure within its vallum be tween 2 and 3000 people. It is supposed to be an ancient British fortress, many of which Julius C\u00e6sar found in this island, concealed among the mountains, or in the midst of thick forests.* This township contains two corn-mills ancl twenty-^hree farms. Bedburn Forge gives name to a small village, one mile north-west from Hamsterleyr, and was, till 1820, an extensive bleachery, where linen cloth and yarn were whitened by chemical process; but, since that year, it has been employed in the manufacture of edge-tools, spades, shovels, bread-knives, &c. In Bishop Hatfield's time, Mayland, in this township, was the estate of Hugh de Buminghall, who held the manor and 100 acres of land by foreign service and 6d. or a pair of spurs at the feast of St. Cuthbert in September. The Brackenburys afterwards held property here by a sparrow- hawk or 12d. Bedburn Hall was, in Hatfield's time, in the possession of Robert Emerson, who rendered 8s. ; and it afterwards became the property of the Euros. It now belongs, together with Bedburn Forge, to John Fogg Elliott, Esq., who resides in Durham, and the hall is unoccupied. Redford was a part of the possessions of the Eures; and the Shipleys belonged to the family of Blackden. Redford Grove is now the property of Robert Surtees, Esq., of Redworth. Hoppyland also belonged to the Eures, lords of AAltton. It has long been held by the family of Leaton,-f- and is at present the property of George Thomas Leaton Blenkinsopp, Esq., of AA'hickham House. Shull is the residence of AVilliam Backhouse, Esq.

By Hatfield's Survey, the prior of Finkley held lands here by foreign service and 30s. rent ; and John Mawe also held lands. Twenty-eight tenants held 35 messuages and te nements of the bishop's exchequer lands, under certain rents. The Nevilles afterwards acquired possessions here, which were forfeited by Charles Earl of Westmoreland ; and the Duke of Cleve land is now lord of the manor. There is no assemblage of houses in this township which can be properly called a village ; but the following are its most populous hamlets or districts : Potter- Cross, West Pits, Hous, Softley, Lynesack, and Trough- Lane-Head. Several public houses are scattered amongst these places ; and there is a corn-mill on the Gaunless. The township includes nearly 60 farms. It it a hilly sterile region ; but it contains several collieries, which enliven its aspect and are gradually augmenting its population. Craike Scar colliery is worked by Messrs. Hardy, Kendall, and Hodgson ; and Butterknowle and Copley collieries by Messrs. Dowson and Co. A branch of the Stockton and Darlington Railway from West Auckland to these collieries, a distance of 5 miles, was opened on May 1, 1830, in the presence of between 2 and 3000 spectators.

It consists of the townships of AVitton-le- AVear and North Bedburn, which contained together, in 1801, 695 inhabitants; in 1811, 826; and in 1821,882, comprising 175 families, inhabiting 167 houses. The annual value of property assessed to the county-rate for the year 1828-9 was \u00a34256, 8s. 6d. AArITTON-LE-WEAR. This place was anciently a royal manor, being held by the crown till the reign of Henry II. , who granted it to Henry de Puteaco or Pudsey, in consideration of 2000 marks of silver, paid by his uncle, then bishop of Durham. Shortly afterwards, it became the seat of the Eures or Evers. Grose says, \" This was the baronial castle of the Lords de Eure, a family of ancient note and emi nence in the county, descended from the Lords Clavering and Warkworth, and by the female line from the Vescys and Attons. They were famous for their warlike exploits against the Scots, as a reward for which, King Edward I. bestowed upon them Kitness, a town in Scotland,\" supposed to mean Thurso, in Caithness. In 1410, Bishop Langley granted his licence to Sir Ralph Eure to fortify his castle of AA^itton with a wall, and to embattle, encarnale, and entower the same.

Sir William compounded for \u00a31000, with \u00a340 a year settled. \"James Lord Darcy, of Havan, in the kingdom of Ireland, about the year 1689 took away the lead, timber, and chimney-pieces, to Sadberye, near Richmond, with a design to build another house there : but the greatest part of the materials was afterwards sold by auction, for much less than the sum paid for their pullino- down and removing, &c.\" About 1743, the manor and castle of Witton were sold by Henry Darcy, Esq., to William Cuthbert, Esq., serjeant-at-law, and recorder of Newcastle, for about \u00a315,000. On the death of his son, John Cuthbert, Esq., without issue, they became the property of Henry John Thomas Hopper, Esq., the eldest son of Ralph Hopper, Esq., counsellor-at-law, who had married Philadelphia, daughter of AA^illiam, and sister of John Cuthbert, Esq. The affairs of Mr. Hopper came into the hands of the Lord Chancellor, who caused his property to be sold by auc tion ; and on October 11, 1816, AVitton Castle and estate were purchased for \u00a378,000, by AArilliam Chaytor, Esq., since created a baronet, and now M.

It is a large oblong building, with towers and turrets, and was nearly rebuilt durin\u00b0* the last century ; but on December 27, 1796, it was discovered to be on fire, and the flames rao-ed with such violence, that all attempts to stop their progress were ineffectual. All the elegance of the internal structure was entirely destroyed, and the outer walls only left standing. The Castle has been greatly enlarged and beautified by the present proprietor, who has also improved the grounds.

At the foot of the plane the locomotive engine, built by stir. George Stephenson, of Newcastle, was ready to re ceive the carriages ; and here the novelty of the scene had attracted an immense concourse of spectators, both on horse and foot. The train of carriages was then attached to the engine in the following order: \u2014 1. Loco motive engine, with the engineer (stir. Stephenson) and assistants. 2. Tender with coals and water; next, six waggons, loaded with coals and flour ; then an elegant covered coach, with the committee and other pro prietors of the railway ; then 21 waggons, fitted up for passengers ; and, last of all, six waggons, loaded with coals; making, altogether, a train of 34 carriages, exclusive ofthe engine and tender. Nearly 300 tickets were distributed ; but such was the pressure and crowd, that both loaded and empty carriages were instantly filled with passengers. The signal being given, the engine started off with this immense train of carriages; and such was its velocity that, in some parts, the speed was frequently 12 miles an hour, and in one place, for a short distance, 15 miles an hour, at which time the number of passengers was counted to 450, amount ing, together with the coals, merchandise, and carriages, to near 90 tons weight. After some little delay in arranging the procession, the engine, with its load, arrived at Darlington, a distance of 84' miles, in 65 mi nutes, and was received with bursts of applause. Six waggons loaded with coals, intended for Darlington, were then left behind; and, obtaining a fresh supply of water, and arranging the procession to accommodate a band of music and passengers, the engine again set off, and arrived at Stockton in 3 hours and 7 minutes, including stops. By this time, there were not less than 600 persons within and banging by the carriages, which excited a deep interest and admiration. Part ofthe workmen were entertained at Stockton, and part at Yarm ; and there was a grand dinner for the proprietors and their most distinguished guests, to the num ber of 102, at the Town Hall in Stockton."], [298, "DARLINGTON WARD\u2014 N.

The views to the west, south, and east, include the windings of the river and its junction with the Bedburn, the church of Hamsterley, Toft Hill, the Castle and Park of AA'itton, and the town of Bishop Auckland. The Grammar School (see Charities) has been occupied for many years by the Rev. George Newby as a boarding-school, which ranks amongst the best and largest seminaries in the north of England ; Mr. Newby and his five assistant teachers (viz. a second master, and masters for writing, mathematics, French, and Italian) having generally under their care from 80 to 90 pupils. Here are four inns ancl public houses, and several tradesmen and mechanics. There are many good houses in the village. Witton Hall,\\ on the west, is the residence of Colonel James * On October 22, 1767, a farm-house, barn, and stable, with all the stock, near AVitton, were consumed by tire. t Thomas Jackson, S. T. P., was born here of a worthy family ; but having many relations who lived in great wealth and splendour in Newcastle, he was designed by bis parents to be a merchant there. His taste for literary pursuits, however, could not be repressed, and he was sent in 1595 to Queen's College, Oxford, and in the following year removed to Corpus-Christi. His industry was so eminent that he soon became distinguished for his knowledge in mathematics, philology, logic, history, philosophy, the oriental languages, &c. He also knew something of heraldry and hieroglyphics. But all his various acquirements were made subservient to the study of divinity, in which he was so eminent as to read a divinity lecture once a week, not only at bis own college, but also at Pembroke College, at the request of the master and fellows. As vice-president of his college, he moderated at the divinity disputes with great candour and modesty. He commenced D. D. in 1622, and in the following year became vicar of Newcastle. Though a rigid Calvinist, he yielded the point of absolute predestination to the persuasions of Bishop Neile, who made him his chap lain, and joined with Dr. Laud in bringing him back to his college, where he was elected president in 1630. Upon this promotion, he resigned the vicarage of Newcastle; and, in 1635, was collated to a prebend of Winchester, having been made chaplain to the king some time before. In 1638, be obtained the deanery of Peterborough, but did not enjoy this dignity quite two years, being taken from it by death in 1640. He was a man of blameless life, studious, humble, industrious, pious, and learned. As vicar of Newcastle, he per formed all the duties of an excellent parish-priest ; and whenever he went out, be usually gave what money he had about him to the poor, who at length so crowded around him, that his servant took care he should not have too much in his pocket. His numerous works were collected and published in 16/2 and 1673, in three volumes, folio. His \" Commentaries on the Apostle's Creed\" is considered his principal performance. His writings were much admired and studied by Bishop Home, whose biographer ranks Dr. Jackson with \"the English fathers of the church.\" \u2014 Fuller's Worthies. Alh. Ox. vol i.

X This mansion was for some time, in the latter part of the 18th century, the residence ofa mysterious person, who called himself Charles Joseph Douglas ; but his origin was not known to his most intimate friends, though he wns said to have been born on one of the AVest India islands, of parents who were engaged in the cause of the \" pretender\" in 1745, and to bave served in tbe army at tbe battle of Minden, of which he frequently gave long and minute descriptions. By his marriage with a lady of the name of Douglas he became possessed of Witton Hall, which, after her death, was secured to him by some deed of hers; and to qualify himself to take the estate he proved himself denizen by long laboured searches for his pedigree in the descents of the noble family of Douglas. Hutchinson says, he was a man of uncommon talents, who had \" undergone strange vicissitudes of fortune, and rested here for a while in tbe lap of luxury and ease, to give a new spring for adventures still more unaccountable, and attempts more capricious than he had before ex perienced : with a most extensive genius, he possessed a spirit of liberality deserving a better fate than that which he purchased by his follies ; but, pushed forward by an extravagant vivacity, he was again launched"], [299, "AVITTON-LE-WEAR. 279 Cookson ; and Newby Lowson, Esq., ancl Colonel Henry Shadforth, have pleasant mansions. On March 12, 1764, the north arch of the bridge over the Wear at AAritton gave way by suddenly springing upwards. During the great flood of 177L it was entirely destroyed; and on October 10, 1787, a succeeding bridge was swept away by a flood, which did considerable damage to the lands in the neighbourhood. The present biidge is a good, substantial structure, of two arches. The Church. This church was anciently prebendal to Auckland college. It is an ancient structure, consisting of a nave with a north aisle, a chancel, and a low western tower. The aisle is formed by three pointed arches, supported by cylindrical pillars ; but there is no arch over the entrance into the chancel. The east window consists of three pointed lights under an elliptical arch ; and the south window of the chancel is pointed. A window on the south side of the nave is surmounted by an elliptical arch, with pointed compartments; ancl in the north wall, which was taken down and re built some years ago, are three lancet lights. The font is a bason cut in the top of a truncated cone. A gallery was erected at the west end of the church in I78O by John Cuthbert, Esq., of Witton Castle; and another has since been added over the north aisle.

School \u2014 John Cuthbert, by will, February 11, 1783, bequeathed \u00a3200 to trustees, to invest the same on real or government security, and to pay the dividends or interest thereof to the Rev. John Farrer, the then schoolmaster at AVitton-le-Wear, and to the schoolmaster to be appointed by the owners of the castle and manor of Witton for the time being, for their teaching, in the school there given by the testator, six poor boys, to be nominated by the owner and owners of the said castle and manor for the time being. And by a codicil annexed to bis will, he gave \u00a3100 for the repairs, improvements, and adornment of each ofthe two churches and chancels of AVitton ancl Hamsterley ; and \u00a3100, as his friend Mr. Farrer had greatly raised the school, to enlarge and render it more commodious to himself and the number of young gentlemen sent to study under him. These sums were applied as directed. On the inclosure of AVitton Common in 1775, the com missioners set out for the school an allotment of I r. 29 p., subject to the payment of a rent of 2^d. to the bishop. There is no other endowment to the school, except what arises from Cuthbert's legacy of \u00a3200, which was laid out in the purchase of \u00a3268 stock, three per cent, consols, stir. Farrer continued to teach in the school above mentioned till 1794. He was succeeded by stir. Rawes, who also held the office of stipen diary curate under him ; and in 1806, the Rev. George Newby was appointed stipendiary curate by Mr. Farrer ; and without any appointment to the office of schoolmaster, he obtained from the bishop of the dio cese a licence \" to the office of master of the grammar school of AVitton-le-AV'ear.\" From the Report of the Commissioners for inquiring concerning Charities, it appears that he had continued to occupy the school and the allotment, and to receive the dividends arising from tbe legacy of stir. Cuthbert, amounting to \u00a3137, 10s. 6d., though he never instructed any children on account thereof; but that he had at sundry times paid to Richard Fothergill, the parish clerk, and who kept a school built by subscription, sums amounting to \u00a392, 14s. for teaching some children; that, after tbe death of Fothergill in September, 1824, WillianX'haytor, Esq., sent six poor boys to Mr. Newby for instruction, but that he soon dismissed them, it being inconvenient to teach them, as they were unable to read ; and that there were then no children taught. The Commis sioners therefore urged the surviving trustee to make some arrangement with stir. Newby, who received the whole proceeds of the charity, for appropriating its benefits agreeably to the intention of tbe founder. In consequence of this representation, the charity has since been transferred to the village school above men tioned, the master of which receives the whole, and instructs six poor children of Witton. Poor's Stock. \u2014 There is a sum of \u00a3120 stock, in the three per cent, consols, standing in the names of Newby Lowson, Esq., the Rev.

North Bedburn. This extensive township lies on the north side of Witton, and contains two public houses and nine farmsteads. Greenhead is a small village, 5\\ miles north-west from Bishop Auckland ; and Fir Tree is a hamlet 6 miles north-west from that place, and containing a school. There is sup posed to have been an iron smelting furnace in this township, for there are several heaps of hard slag or cinders, and one of the farms is still called Smelt House. The Eures of AVitton were anciently the principal proprietors here. By Hatfield's Survey, Ro- bert de Drilleton held AVadley, formerly the estate of Leon. Heriz, rendering a rent in lieu of a sparrow-hawk. Ralph de Eure, Mil., held Macnell and 80 acres of land, rendering 5s. rent. John Spring and Robert Hagerston each held a toft and 100 acres in Little Mayland. Harperley was held by John Conyers, Chiv., of Bishopton and Sockburn, who rendered 20s. John Barker held Wodingfield, containing 40 acres, and rendered 20s. Divers other persons had lands in the manor of North Bedburn. The exchequer lands, consisting of 20 parcels, with 26 messuages, were held by 18 tenants, under certain yearly rents; and John Lodge held the herbage of Bedburn Park in farm, rendering 13s. 4d. at four terms in the year. Wodingfield shortly afterwards was held by the family of Chauncellor, and became part of the estates of the Nevilles. It was forfeited by Charles Earl of Westmoreland. Harperley became part of the possessions of the Cradocks of Gainford ; and Marmaduke Cra dock, Esq., built a house here in an elevated situation, the old hall lying low. George Pearson, Esq., of the city of Durham, clerk of the peace for the county, afterwards held Harperley Park, on which he made many judicious improvements, and planted extensive ancl thriving plantations.* His daughter married George Hutton Wilkinson, Esq., the present proprietor, who has also consi derably improved the lands, so that Harperley is now one of the most pleasant seats in the county- CHAPELRY OF ESCOMB. This small chapelry, which is a member of the parish of St. Andrew's Auckland, is bounded by it on the north-east, south-east, and south, and by the chapelry of AVitton-le-Wear on the north west. In 1801, it contained 162 inhabitants; in 1811, 190; and in 1821, 232, consisting of 56 families, inhabiting 52 houses. The annual value of property assessed to the county-rate in 1828-9 was \u00a31238, 14s. 3d. Escomb was one of the places resigned to the Earls of Northumberland. By Boldon Book, there were thirteen villains, each holding an oxgang of land, and rendering the like services and rents as * In 1792, the Society of Arts presented the silver medal to George Pearson, Esq., of Harperley, on ac count of the improvement of 100 acres of land by 7700 yards of hollow drain."], [302, "DARLINGTON AVARD\u2014 N.

Humphrey the Charioteer held six acres which belonged to Ulf the Ranger, rendering 12d. yearly. The punder held a toft and croft, with three acres, rendering 20 hens and 300 eggs, and tilling three portions of land. In Hatfield's Survey, Sir Ralph Eure is noted to hold lands called Shaylfield, and eight acres of free land called Tods-stanes. The villains held each an oxgang, containing 20 acres, and performed their services like those of Bondgate in Auckland, with 12d. increase rent. They rendered amongst them 9d. for cornage, 6s. for a milch cow at Martinmas, for aver-pennies 6s. 8d., for woodlade like those of Auckland, and wrought the customary work at the mill: they also rendered 10 hens and 100 eggs. The services of the exchequer tenures are also noted, in which the rahunt occurs.* Bishops Pudsey, Beck, and Fordham, successively made grants of land here ; the latter to Sir Ralph de Eure, who, in Bishop Langley's time, died seized of li acre of land, called St. AAllfrid's acre, and also of eight acres of meadow.

These 30 children are appointed by the trustees, and the number is always kept up : none are considered eligible until they are seven years of a\"e. Brusselton is a district 4 miles south from Bishop Auckland, containing two farms, a colliery leased under the bishop, and a lofty circular tower, which was built by one of the Carrs, on an eminence so lofty that it is said to command a view of the eastern and western oceans. At New Etherley also there is a leasehold colliery. West Auckland Is a considerable village and township, 3j miles south-by-west from Bishop Auckland, situated at the junction of the high roads from Durham to Barnard Castle, ancl from Darlington to AVolsing ham, &c. The railway from Stockton to Witton Park extends along its eastern extremity. Seve ral of the houses in AVest Auckland bear traces of considerable antiquity. Here are nine inns and public houses, a number of tradesmen and mechanics, and a private lunatic asylum ; and the town ship includes twenty-four farms.* By Boldon Book, there were in West Auckland eighteen villains, who held each an oxgang of land, providing three men weekly in autumn to win and lead the hay, during which service they had a corrody ; each led corn two days, and together they provided eighteen hens, nine score eggs, one milch cow, and made three carryings between Tyne and Tees. William Coupman and others held divers parcels of land under certain rents, ancl the services of ploughing and harrowing the lord's lands, making hay, preparing ridges of fallow in autumn, and serving on embassies. Elstan a drenge held four oxgangs of land, tilled four portions in autumn with all his men except those of his household, ploughed and harrowed two acres, served on embassies between Tyne and Tees, and provided four oxen to draw the bishop's wine. It appears that the lands were in the bishop's hands during the minority of the heir, a portion thereof being assigned to the mother for his maintenance. All the villains of Aucklandshire, viz. of North Auckland, West Auckland, Escomb, and Newton, provided for the bishop's chace, for each oxgang of land, one cord, assisted to build the bishop's hall in the forest, with a butler's room, a dispensa, a chamber, and privy, besides a chapel of the dimension stipulated, and a portion of the paling, hedge, or fence around the lodge : they were entitled to 2s., and, on the bishop's quitting the forest, to a full tun or half a tun of beer, if so much remained. They were to keep the hawk-yard, ancl were entitled to make eighteen booths at St. Cuthbert's fairs. Besides, all the villains and tenants were, at the bishop's summons, to attend the rahunt ; and they also wrought at the mill. In Hatfield's Survey, the free tenants and their services are specified, with divers drengage te nants, among whom was John Dalton, whose posterity continued there to late times. Thomas Surtees held 100 acres of land, called the Kingfield. * On April 29, 1740, some school-boys, paring off a green sod in the road between St. Helen's and AVest Auckland, found about 45 pieces of silver, supposed to he about 200 years old, some of which looked very fresh."], [306, "286 DARLINGTON WARD.\u2014 N. W. D. The Taillours, Boltons, Sockburns, Coupmans, Batmans, Fishes, Allgoods, Fosters, Perkinsons, and Daltons, held various possessions here. In the reign of Elizabeth, the Edens acquired lands in AVest Auckland by marriage with the coheiresses of Dalton and Hutton. This family took part with Charles I. during the civil wars. In 1672, Robert, son of John Eden, Esq., was created a baronet, and represented the county of Durham in the parliaments of 1678 9, 1689, 1698, 1702, 1705, and 1710. John his son, who succeeded to the baronetcy in 1720, sat in the parliaments of 1713, 1714, and 1722.* His grandson, Sir John Eden, Bart., was elected M. P. for the county in 1774 and the two following parliaments. The property of this family in West Auckland is still held by Sir R. J. Eden, Bart., of AVindleston.-f An estate in this township belonged to the Carrs, from whom it passed to the Milbankes, who sold it to Sir C. Musgrave, Bart. A great part of the township is held by copyhold tenure under the bishop of Durham. Lutrington was one of the places given to the church of Durham by Canute. By Boldon Book, Galterus de Lutrington rendered for this vill 20s., tilled three portions of land in autumn with all his men except those of his household, served the bishop on embassies, provided four oxen to draw the prelate's wine, and attended the great chace. In Hatfield's Survey, it appears that Lord AVil liam Bowes then held this manor, and performed his service in the lands of Coundon with his men. The Collingwoods, Tonges, Langtons, and others, were successively proprietors of this place, which now belongs to Robert Surtees, Esq., of Redworth. Woodhouse was part of the ancient possessions of the Pollards. Etherley. \u2014 This village is situated 3;'? miles south-west from Bishop Auckland, and contains a colliery, a school, three public houses, and a few tradesmen. Royal Oak is a hamlet deriving its name from the sign of a public house, and is situated partly in Redworth township, parish of Heighington, 5 miles south-by-east from Bishop Auckland. Evenwood and Barony. Evenwood is a village, constablery, and joint township with Barony, pleasantly situated on the summit of a steep hill, which rises on the south side of the Gaunless, 5 miles south-west from Bishop Auckland. There is a black and brown earthenware manufactory at New Moor ; and the constablery contains a Methodist chapel, a school, a corn-mill, two public houses, several weavers and other tradesmen, and twelve farms. The old castle at Evenwood has now totally disappeared, the last remains of its walls being removed a few years ago ; and the scite is now occupied by a farm-house, where the moat may still be traced. Barony is a constablery on the north side of the Gaunless, over which there is a bridge, connect ing it with Evenwood. Ramshuw is a hamlet in this constablery, 44 miles south-south-west from Bishop Auckland, and containing a public house and three farms. Morley, 5 miles west-by-south from Bishop Auckland, contains nine farmsteads and a blacksmith's shop. The hamlet called Toft Hill contains two public houses, a few tradesmen, and nine farms. * \" It is related of him, that on some project for equalizing the land-tax which was brought before parlia ment, he placed a brown loaf and a pair of wooden clogs on the table, saying, ' There \u2014 when the south eats and wears what we do in the north, then mak us like and like.' He was a popular man of a popular family.\" \u2014 Sir C Sharp's List qf Knights and Esquires. T Many of this family have been employed in offices of great trust and honour ; and one of them, viz. Wil liam Eden, whilst ambassador at the Hague in 1793, was created Baron Auckland, which title is now held by his son, the Right Hon. George Eden, of Grosvenor Street, London, and of Eden Farm, near Bromley, Kent."], [307, "ST. ANDREAV'S AUCKLAND. 287 Evenwood was given to the church of Durham by Canute; but, in the time of Bishop Beck, it was the estate of John Hansard, who conveyed it to that prelate in exchange for AVerkersall. It was let by succeeding bishops to the Nevilles and others; and in 1368, Bishop Hatfield granted for a term of years a blomestage, bloomery, or iron furnace, in Gordon and Evenwood Patk, at the rent of 16s. a week ; the dry wood for that purpose to be delivered by Allan, the bishop's seneschal, John de Kingeston, constable of Durham, or some person especially deputed. Bishops Hatfield and Fordham both appointed park-keepers here for life. By a survey taken in 1646, it appears that this Barony then comprehended Evenwood, Killerby, AVest Auckland, a decayed baronial mansion in a park of 300 acres, a great common called Raley Fell, and a large colliery called Thorne, where the bishop, in right of jura regalia, had \"all manner of privileges, royalties, fran- chises, and immunities.\" The township is still nearly all copyhold under the bishop of Durham, who receives from it about 4d. per acre, and holds a court leet and baron, in March and October, for the recovery of debts under 40s. &c. PARISH OF ST. ANDREAV'S AUCKLAND. This extensive parish is bounded on the south-west and west by the chapelries of St. Helen's Auckland, Escomb, ancl Witton-le-Wear, on the north by the parish of Brancepeth, on the east by the chapelry of Whitworth and the parish of Merrington, ancl on the south-east by Aycliffe and Heighington. It formerly possessed a very extensive parochia] jurisdiction, both in civil and ec- clesiastical matters ; but ten of its twenty-seven townships have been abscinded from the mother church, and placed under the authority of four parochial chapels at St. Helen's Auckland, Escomb, Hamsterley, and AAritton-le-AArear. It now contains the following townships, viz. 1. St. Andrew's Auckland ; 2. Bishop Auckland ; 3. Shildon ; 4. East Thickley ; 5. Midridge ; 6. Eldon ; 7- Coun- don ; 8. Coundon Grange ; 9- AVindleston ; 10. AVesterton ; 11. Middleston ; 12. Pollard's Land ; 13. Binchester; 14. Newfield ; 15. Byers Green ; 16. Newton Cap ; and, 17- Hunwick and Hel mington. The whole, in 1801, contained 3304 inhabitants; in 1811, 3523; and in 1821, 3907, being 901 families, inhabiting 733 houses. The annual value of property assessed to the county rate for the year ending January 12, 1829, was \u00a320,951, 15s. 8|d. The parish abounds in coal and lime ; the soil is generally well suited for the production of corn, turnips, &c. ; and the scenery is finely diversified by hill and dale, and wood and water, particularly near Bishop Auckland. This parish derives its name from the number of oaks which formerly grew here (see also Aycliffe). St. Andrew's Auckland, Sometimes called South Church, is a village situated on the river Gaunless, over which there is a bridge, 1 mile south from Bishop Auckland, and 11 miles south-south-west from Durham. It con tains a corn-mill, a brewery, and six public houses. St. Andrew's Place, a little to the north, con sists of rows of new cottages, several of which are erecting for the population collected by the coal-mines. The township includes five farms.

In the 26th of Henry VIII., the deanery was valued at \u00a3100, 7s. 2d., and the prebends at \u00a379, 16s. 8d., as will be seen in the following list, which contains the names of the eleven prebends and their yearly value : \u2014 \u00a3. s. d.

It was now ordained, that the dean and his successors should receive all obventions, lands, rents, rights, and liberties, which the vicars formerly had. And also that the dean should constantly reside, and provide a priest to officiate in the prelate's cha pel at Auckland. And that he should provide priests, and other fit officiating ministers, as usual, to tbe duty ofthe parish church and chapel, where all his tithes, and other revenues and emoluments, arise. And as to those prebendaries who neither resided, or furnished proper clerks to officiate in their stead, that all pretence for non-residence might be removed, a certain parcel of land was appointed, lying on the south side of the church, on which they might build ; being enjoined by tlieir obedience, that, before the expiration of two years next following, such habitations should be erected. It was also ordained, that every canon that did not reside should provide a proper vicar or curate to officiate in his absence; and that the five first or senior canons, viz. Master Robert Avenell, Walter de Langton, Galfrid de Vesano, Jobn de London, Master Adam de Brompton, and their successors, should engage priests, and pay them annually five marks each ; and the four next canons, John de Lacey, Sire Richard de Insula, John de AVytbam, and Allan de Kirkham, should engage deacons, with stipends of 40s. a year each ; and the rest of the canons should have subdeacons, with stipends of 30s. annually: which curates were to be presented to the dean for his approbation, with certain rules touching their successors. It was also ordained, that divine service should be chaunted all the year round, at the usual hours, after the method used at York and Salisbury, and that high mass should be daily celebrated at the third hour ; and also that the mass of the A^irgin Mary should be celebrated by Master Adam de Brompton, or his curate, and their successors, at the usual time. And that the presbyters appointed by tbe dean to inspect more particularly into the affairs of the parish, and all other ministers, should conform to proper habits, and at all times shew obedience. The curates of the prebendaries were to officiate weekly, according to their different degrees: the dean to regulate all spiritual matters, and to proceed even to the punishment of delinquents. Matins to be said every day for the benefit of the parishioners. The first stall on the south side of tlie choir was reserved for the bishop; the first stall on the north side was the dean's place ; the canons, whose curates were priests, to hold the next places ; after them the canons, whose curates were deacons ; and lastly the canons, whose curates were subdeacons : and that the same order should be held in processions. + \"As the times were altered, the aforesaid allowances for the vicars were not sufficient for their mainte nance, and therefore none that were fit for it could be found to serve the same ; that still some ofthe pre bends were sufficient to bear double their expense, others could scarce do it, and some not at all ; therefore he (the bishop) resolved to amend the same. Accordingly, the revenues of the three prebends of Bishop Auckland, Eldon the Greater, and Eldon the Lesser, being each of them \u00a320 per annum, he ordained, that as they became vacant, each of them should be divided into two prebends, so to constitute six, and the reve nues of each to be equally divided between the two possessors. There being also seven prebends belonging to the said church whose produce was not sufficient, he directed that they should be joined, so as to make but three prebends, one of them worth \u00a3 10 and each of the other two only 100s. per annum. He ordained that the priestly canons, not being resident, should allow their vicars ten marks a year; the deacon canons their vicars seven marks at least ; and the canons subdeacons to theirs five marks.

There were two chantries in this church ; one dedicated to the Blessed Virgin, and the other to John the Baptist. The former was valued at \u00a38, 12s. 6d., and the latter at \u00a37, 16s.; but their founders are unknown. The church suffered greatly at the dissolution, which took place in the 1st of Edward VI., 1547, when it was left neither rectorial nor vicarial, but became a donative or curacy, with but a small provision, considering the extent, population, and opulence of the parish.

The deanery lands were purchased by Sir Arthur Hazelrigg; but, after his attainder they were granted to Bishop Cosin, who annexed them to the see for ever. The dean's house, and likewise some of the prebendal houses, which are situated a little to the west of the church, have been long converted into dwellings for farmers. The church is a large Gothic structure, consisting ofa western tower, a nave and side-aisles, a transept, and a chancel. The walls are embattled, and supported by buttresses. There is a lame one at the south-west corner of the tower, containing a winding staircase. In the entrance-porch on the south, which has an elegant groined roof, are three arched windows, now built up. The tower rises on a pointed arch, springing from pilasters. There are five pointed arches on each side of the nave, supported by alternate clustered and octagonal pillars. In the south wall of the chan- cel are arched niches for the officiating priests. The east window is under a lofty pointed arch ; and there are three pointed lights on the south side of the chancel, with blank arches between them. The transepts and aisles are lighted by pointed windows, some of them adorned with elegant tra- cery ; and there are clerestory lights over the nave. A gallery at the west end is inscribed, \" Ro- bert Hilton, Gen. 1721 ;\" and contains an organ. There is another gallery in the north transept, now called Kennet's Porch. The stalls of the dean and prebends remain in the chancel. Monuments. \u2014 In the church are two effigies. One of them is of wood, and represents a knight in a coat of chain armour, which covers his head, arms, and hands : the face is bare, the hands elevated, ancl the legs crossed ; the feet resting on an animal, supposed to be a boar, thus identify ing the figure as one of the Pollards.

Hcnknoll adjoins the church of St. Andrew's on the west. It was anciently a manor held of the bishop, and afterwards belonged to the convent, who gave it to John de Belassis, in exchange for his lands in the parish of Billingham (see vol. i. p, 511). Henknoll continued in this family for many generations. It was recently purchased by Luke Seymour, Esq. Bishop Auckland, This market-town and township is pleasantly situated at the confluence of the AA^ear and the Gaunless, 10 miles south-west from Durham, and 256 miles north-north-west from London. It is an ancient borough by prescription, the tenements being held by burgage tenure ; ancl at an early date it contained a manor-house. By Boldon Book, there were 22 villains in North Acland, or Alclet, each of whom held an oxgang of land, rendering two chalders of aver-malt, and one icheit or wehit of scat-malt, and the like of meal or bread-corn and oats, 8d. for aver-pennies, 19d. cor nage, one hen and ten eggs, three woodloads if brought to Auckland, and two and a half if carried to Durham : they wrought two days in each week from the day of St. Peter ad A7incula to Mar tinmas, ancl from thence one day in each week the rest of the year : besides, they each prepared four portions of land in autumn, with the whole family except the housewife, and for each carucate ploughed and harrowed two acres aud a half extra work. The whole vill provided a milch cow. The headborough man had an oxgang of land for his service; the smith had the like; the punder had 12 acres, and had the customary thraves, rendering fourscore hens ancl 500 eggs. The tolls of beer (big or barley) produced 8s., and the mills 24 marks. The free tenants are named, among whom is a Pollard, who then held 10A acres of land. By Hatfield's Survey, the Pollards were possessed of considerable estates. The Lord AArilliam Colvyll held 40 acres of land, formerly the estate of AAralter Burdon, and afterwards of Robert Herle. The heirs of AVilliam Kereby held lands called AArelcrok ; William Bowes, Esq., held 60 acres upon AVellyngthorn ; the dean of Auckland held several lands therein specified ; and Richard de Bedlyngton, chaplain, held 20 acres in Priestfield in free alms, of the gift of the bishop. Se venteen cottagers wrought three clays at hay, and had a farthing a clay. Twenty-two tenants held the old demesne lands, containing 134 acres, at 7d. per acre. Twenty tenants held the new de mesne lands, containing 79 acres, at 18d. per acre. The meadow grounds are next specified. In the rents of the bond tenants, the measure was to be cumulat, or upheaped. The borou\"*h was farmed out, with the profits of the borough court, burgage fees, tolls, profits of mills, the brew farm, and toll of beet in West Auckland, and the common furnace in North Auckland, at the rent of \u00a326, 13s. 4d. The fulling-mill produced 46s. 8d. \u2014 the park \u00a38, with 50 acres of meadow therein, 100s. The property in Bishop Auckland was afterwards divided amongst numerous persons.* In 1638, on an information filed by the bishop's attorney-general in the chancery at Durham, touchino the customary service of certain copyhold lands in Auckland, called Moor Close and AVio-ton Walls * In 1463, licences were granted by the prior of Durham to Thomas Man, of Bishop Auckland, and to John Etrick and Thomas Jonson, of Greatham, to go to the Holy Land upon a pilgrimage an-ainst the Turks having previously, before the shrine of St. Cuthbert, branded them upon the right side of their naked breast* with a hot iron shaped like a cross \u2014 Sykes's Local Records."], [313, "ST. ANDREWS AUCKLAND. 293 it was decreed, \"that all persons having right therein, for ever thereafter, should yearly and every year from thenceforth, upon any warrant from the steward of the household, or clerk of the kitchen, for the time being, of the bishop and his successors, keep and provide, and have in readiness, for the use and service of the bishop and his successors, fourscore and ten good and able horses, well and sufficiently furnished, in a year, to be taken up by ten horses at a time, as occasion should re- quire, so that they might once in every year have the service of ninety horses, paying 6d. a day for each one of the ninety horses aforesaid,\" on pain of forfeiting their copy -right, and beino* subject to attachment. In 1672, under a decree, a division was made of certain lands in Bishop Auckland, called the Hitherfield, Middlefield, and Farfield, consisting of freehold and copyhold lands. The Castle. \u2014 The bishops of Durham have had a residence at Auckland from an early period. Leland says, \" There was a very auncient manor place longing to the bishop of Duresme at Ake- land. Antonius de Beke began first to encastellate it, he made the great haulle, there be clivers pillars of black marble spekeled with white, and the exceeding faire gret chambre, with other there. He made also an exceeding goodly chapelle ther, of ston well squarid, and a college with dene and prebends yn it, and a quadrant on the south-west side of the castelle for ministers of the college. Skirlaw, bishop of Duresme, made the goodly gate-house at entering into the castelle of Akeland. There is a fair park by the castelle, having fallow deer, wild bulles, and kin.\" There are now no remains here of the erections of Bishop Beck, except the church of St. Andrew's ; though it is pro- bable that the original edifices remained till the time of the civil wars. On May 31, 1633, Kino- Charles I., on his progress to Scotland, came to Auckland Castle, where he was entertained by Bishop Morton. The palace of \" Durham's mitred princes,\" however, did not escape the fate of the rest of the accumulated pageantry of centuries, during the succeeding storms, \u2014 When \" the fierce zealots fought and bled For king or state, as humour led ; Some for a dream of public good, Some for church-tippet, gown, and hood, Draining their veins, in death to claim A patriot's or a martyr's name.\" During the Commonwealth, this place was granted by the parliament to Sir Arthur Hazelrigg, who was so much pleased with the situation, that he determined on making it his chief residence, pulled down nearly the whole of the ancient structure, and erected out of its ruins a magnificent mansion. The restoration of King Charles II. followed, and Auckland Castle again changed mas ters, Bishop Cosins being presented to the diocese. He, however, declined making use of the ha bitation built by Sir Arthur, considering it a pollution of the sacred materials of the former structure to have been made \" the habitation of fanaticism ;\" and he accordingly demolished it, and built the present elegant chapel. The Castle is finely situated on an eminence, and is formed by a line of irregular square masses of buildings, built at different times, and combining the character of the old English mansion with some features of the castellated style ; several portions of which are rich with heraldic and other ornaments. Pennant says that it \" resembles some of the magnificent foreign abbeys;\" an idea which is supported by the appearance of the chapel on the east, the architecture of which is richer than that of the Castle, and has been compared to that of King's College in Cambridge. A recent writer adds, \"The windows are beautiful, and the numerous buttresses surmounted with pinnacles give it an air of great lightness and elegance, which is enhanced by its commanding situation on the summit of the fine sloping lawn which descends to the river, and along which a terrace with embrasures contributes to the general effect of the whole.\" A stone screen, with open pointed arches, at a little distance from the buildings, forms a considerable embellishment. The entrance"], [314, "DARLINGTON WARD\u2014 N. AV. D 294 from the Market-place of the town to the park is by a handsome gateway, erected by Bishop Trevor. The principal apartments of the Castle are distinguished by a character of plain and simple ele o*ance, and derive great beauty from their loftiness. The breakfast-room contains portraits of Bishops Cosins, Crewe, Talbot, Chandler, Butler, Barrington, and the present venerable prelate; and in an adjoining room is a fine view of the city of Durham. The spacious dining-room is em bellished with the following paintings : \u2014 Jacob and his twelve sons, all by Zurbiram, except Ben jamin, which is a copy made by Pond ; the four Fathers of the Latin Church, Augustine, Gregory, Jerome, and Ambrose, by Bloomari ; the four Evangelists, by Lanfrane; and Cornaro, a noble Venetian, his son, grandson, and great grandsons, by Titian. The drawing-room is a grand apart ment, 62 feet long and 27 high, with a groined ceiling and an oaken floor. The furniture is ap propriate and beautiful. \" On the upper landing of the staircase,\" says stir. Sopwith, \" a window, filled with plate glass from mullion to mullion, is so transparent that the stranger scarcely suspects it to be glazed, and fancies he feels the open air on approaching it.\" Mr. Pennant says, \" On the old wainscot of a room below stairs are painted the arms of a strange assemblage of potentates, from Queen Elizabeth, with all the European princes, to the emperors of Abissinia, Bildelgered, Car thage, and Tartaria, sixteen peers of the same reign, knights of the garter, and above them the arms of every bishoprick in England.\" The interior of the chapel is extremely elegant. There is a beautiful marble monument on the right side of the entrance, with a Latin inscription, to Bishop Trevor, A handsome carved screen runs across near the west end. The floor is of chequered marble; and two rows of light clustered marble columns, 16 feet high, and surmounted by pointed arches, support the roof. In the centre of the floor, a plain stone, with a modest epitaph, records the death of the founder, Bishop Cosins, in 1671- The windows are beneath pointed arches, ancl adorned with stained glass. Carved stalls are arranged along the walls; and there are two desks for the chaplains in the centre. The decora tions of the altar-table, with its massive golden plate and candlesticks, have a fine effect. Above is a painting of the Resurrection, by Sir Joshua Reynolds. At the west end is an organ, dated 1688. The chapel was ventilated with flues, and the windows and floor repaired, by the present bishop. In 1752, Bishop Butler made great improvements in Auckland Park, by levelling and planting. It was his intention to add about 130 acres of land to the Park, and he had begun to pale a part of the new inclosure. These improvements were carried on by his successor, Bishop Trevor, who pulled down the south wall of the garden in 1754. In about the space of four years, he expended \u00a38000 on the Castle and Park, including the purchase of a house on the south side of the street (now the gateway) near the entrance to the Castle.* The Park is well planted ; and the scene is varied with verdant slopes, rising grounds, woods, and deep precipices impending over the river AVear; beyond which, the nearer landscapes are composed of wild and irregular woodlands, bold cliff's and eminences, mingled in a picturesque manner. The more distant views consist of rich cultivated grounds, through which the AVear winds its course. The Town. \u2014 Leland says, \" The towne self of Akelande is of no estimation, yet is ther a praty market of corne. It stondith on a praty hill bytwcen 2 ryvers, wherof Were lyith on the north syde, and Gaundelesse on the south, ancl an arrow shot or more benethe they meete, and make one streame, and ren to the este, and each of these ryvers hath an hill by it.\" The point at the con- * In 1757, at the building of a bridge in the Park, over the Gaunless, a Roman urn of greyish clay was discovered, filled with earth and human bones."], [315, "ST. ANDREAV'S AUCKLAND. 295 fluence of the Wear and Gaunless is occupied by the Castle, behind which is the Market-place, a spacious square, surrounded by good houses. Neivgate Street extends from hence to the south, on the east side of which the road from Durham enters the town, having passed a bridge over the Gaunless. At the southern extremity of Newgate Street, a row of new houses has received the ap- pellation of Brougham Buildings. To the west of the Market-place, Far Bondgate, Back Bond gate, and High Bondgate, form the avenues to Newton Bridge, over the AVear.* This structure was built by Bishop Skirlaw in 1388. It rises to a great height above the river, and consists of two arches; one ofa circular form, 101 feet in span; the other a pointed arch, of 91 feet span. The western extremity of the town consists of mean cottages, \"occupied by a numerous vagrant tribe, who, from this centre of seldom-inhabited homes, issue forth to vend their brooms, mugs, and other commodities.\" On the east and north sides of the town, buildings are erected on the very brink of the hills, which are extremely steep. The banks are formed into hangino* wardens, and the whole aspect is picturesque and beautiful. -f- The Chapel here was of great antiquity, and dedicated to St. Anne, appertaining to the o*uild instituted in the church of St. Andrew's; the guild being held in the chapel to the time of Edward VI. The present edifice was erected above 50 years ago, and stands in the centre of the Market place. It is a neat Gothic structure, with a tower and decorated pinnacles. The interior is conve niently arranged, and contains an organ. The ground-floor belongs to the Grammar School. The living is a perpetual curacy, not in charge, in the patronage of the bishop of Durham, ancl incum bency of the Rev. George Fielding, A. M. There is no cemetery attached. \\ * On March 8, 1831, a large pair of horns, attached to a part of the skull, and supposed to belong to a red deer, were found in a gravel bed in the Wear, about a quarter ofa mile west of the town. Each horn measures above four feet from the root to the tip ; and they are about 40 inches apart at the widest point of the curve. + Several instances of longevity have occurred in Bishop Auckland. In 1736, a woman here, who was 108 years of age, got a new set of teeth. On August 27, 1786, died at this place, Mrs. Nansome, in the 105th year of her age; on May 14, 1816, Mrs. Jane AVebster, aged 104 years; on February 8, 1818, in the workhouse, Hannah Robinson, aged 103; on February 26, 1825, Grace Cummins, aged 100; on January 4, 1827, Parkinson Wouldhave, aged 108; and on May 2, 1828, John Clay, aged 100. X On May 29, 1 740, the body of stirs. Drage, wife of Theodore Drage, of Bishop Auckland, Esq., was removed from thence to be interred at York. Soon after her decease, the corpse was dressed in her wedding suit, with a pair of new slippers on, and put into a leaden coffin, which was inclosed in another of deal or fir, and another of fine wainscot (brought from London) contained the other two. On the above day, about six weeks after her death, the procession began in the following order : \u2014 Two men on horseback, in black, with caps and favours ; two kettle-drums in mourning ; a horse led by a man on foot ; two trumpeters, the trum pets hung with rich gilt escutcheons of silk ; a man on horseback displaying a very large gilt escutcheon on a black pole ; two singing men from the choir at Durham ; two men in black cloaks, caps, and favours, bear ing each a pole covered with black silk ; tbe hearse drawn by six horses, three men on horseback on each side, in black, with caps and favours; two men behind after the same manner ; the undertaker (Mr. AVatson from Durham) ; the mourning coach, drawn by six horses, in which were Mr. Drage, his daughter, and two friends ; and, lastly, two men on horseback, in black, with caps and favours. The procession passed very slowly through all the streets of Bishop Auckland, during which time the trumpets sounded and the drums heat in a solemn manner. The interment took place at York, between nine and ten o'clock in the evening, as follows : \u2014 Four branched lights, two and two ; two kettle-drums ; two trumpets ; a branched light ; two pole bearers ; a man servant between two branched lights ; two men in cloaks ; two branched lights ; master of the boys ; boys of the choir two and two ; singing men two and two, with branched lights on each side ; canons two and two ; two branched lights ; two vergers ; prebendaries two and two, with branched lights on each side ; the corpse with the pall flung up, and lights on each side ; child and maid ; mourners with lights on each side ; lastly, two branched lights closed the procession \u2014 Sykcs's Local Records. vol. ii. 4 G"], [316, "DARLINGTON WARD\u2014 N.

The Wesleyan Methodist Chapel, in Back Bondgate, holds about 300 people. The Society of Friends have a meeting-house in Newgate Street; ancl the Primitive Methodists have a licensed room in Far Bondgate. A Branch Bible Society has been established in Bishop Auckland for some time. Education. \u2014 There is a ladies' boarding and day-school in High Bondgate ; and, besides the Grammar and Barrington Schools, and the School of Industry (see Charities), there are six other day-schools in the town. An infant-school has recently been established by the present bishop, and is well attended. Support of the Poor. \u2014 In the year ending March 25, 1816, the poor-rates in this township amounted to \u00a3974, 2s. In 1818, they had increased to \u00a31361, 14s.; and in 1821, they were \u00a31164, 7s. During the year ending March 25, 1833, nearly \u00a31100 was collected, by a rate of 8d. in the pound on houses, and ls. in the pound on land. The poor -house is situated at the south end of Newgate Street ; ancl there are generally from 30 to 40 paupers in it, who are maintained on an average at 2s. 6d. per week each. They have two meat dinners in each week, and on the intermediate days have pease-soup. Boiled milk is the regular breakfast ancl supper; though such as chuse it get tea or coffee. There is no restriction as to the quantity eaten. Charities. Free Grammar School \u2014 In 1604, King James I., on the petition of Anna Swyfte, granted his patent for the establishment of a school, to be called \" The Free Grammar School of King James,\" within the town of North Auckland, alias Bishop's Auckland, with one master and one under master ; twelve discreet and ho nest men to be governors ofthe goods, revenues, and possessions ofthe said school. On April 12, 1605, the said Anna Swyfte granted to governors an annual rent of \u00a310, out of a grange or tenement called Ellergill, in the parish of Stanhope, payable at the feast of St. Martin the Bishop in winter. On April 17 following, Ralph Madison, proprietor of Ellergill, gave another annuity of \u00a36 out of the same premises. On April 17, 1638, Bishop Marlon granted to Liuley Wren and others, governors of the Free Grammar School, and their successors, the school-house lately built near the chapel of St. Anne, in the Market-place, and the cottages and appurtenances adjoining, paying to the king, &c. 2s. On October 15, 22 Jac. I., the lord ofthe manor of Bishop Auckland granted a parcel ofthe waste called West Mylne Batts, containing 8 acres, at a rent of 4s., to Richard Richardson, who afterwards conveyed to the governors. The school still stands in the Market place, and the chapel of ease has been erected over it. A part of it is used for transacting the town's busi ness. There is also a house and garden on the opposite side of the Market-place, given by the late bishop of Durham for the use of the master, who receives the rent-charge of \u00a316 from Ellergill, \u00a321 as tbe rent of AVest AI ill Batts, and 15s. from lands in Bondgate bequeathed by AVilliam AVall. In respect of this income, no children are taught free ; but all the children of the parish, who are able to read, are admitted and in structed on the payment of 7s. 0d. a quarter for reading English, writing, and accounts, and 10s. 6d. for the classics. For boys not belonging to the parish, the master is at liberty to make his own charge. There are, on an average, 55 boys in the school, about 10 of whom are generally receiving instruction in the classics. There is an usher appointed and paid by the master. Lord Crewe's Charity for Education and Clothing \u2014 Nathaniel Lord Crewe, amongst other charities, be queathed \u00a320 a year for teaching, and \u00a330 a year for clothing 30 poor boys of Bishop Auckland. In 1811, the trustees doubled the allowance for clothing. The yearly sum of \u00a320 is now paid to the master of the Barrington School for instructing the boys, and their clothing is superintended by the incumbent ofthe parish. Walton's Charities. \u2014 Edward AValton, a member of the Society of Friends, bequeathed \u00a32000 for the esta blishment of schools at Bishop Auckland, Shildon, Sunderland, and Shotton. This sum is now vested in the purchase of \u00a33000 new four per cent, stock ; and there is a school and school-house at each of the above places, the income being equally divided amongst them. The sum of \u00a320 per annum is paid to each of the masters; and \u00a310 is applied in the purchase of books, and in the binding of boys and girls apprentices in each place. The master of the school at Bishop Auckland instructs 20 children of the labouring poor in read ing, writing, and accounts, free of expense ; the children being also supplied with books, &c. There are, or"], [317, "ST. ANDREWS AUCKLAND. 297 an average, 20 more children in the school, who pay for their instruction. The schoolmaster of Shildon in- structs free 25 children of that place. The whole is under the direction of tbe Society of Friends. The Barrington School. \u2014 A school was erected in Bishop Auckland, in 1809, by Bishop Barrington, at an expense of about \u00a32250, and comprises a large school-room, with apartments for the master and usher, and for a housekeeper and female servant to take care of the furniture, and provide for the maintenance of the master and usher, and such persons as are admitted into tbe school for the purpose of learning the duties of schoolmasters. The yearly sum of \u00a3436 (part of the dividends of \u00a330,000 three per cent- stock, left by the bishop for the purposes of education in tbe county) is appropriated to this school, the annual cost of which averages about \u00a3367- In June, 1830, a surplus of \u00a3814 had accumulated, and was at the discre- tion ofthe trustees of the general charity. The school is conducted on the Madras System, and is open to all the children of the parish of St. Andrew Auckland, who apply to the master for admission. There are generally from 170 to 200 receiving instruction, including 30 boys on Lord Crewe's foundation. They are taught reading, writing, and accounts, and are supplied gratuitously with pens, ink, paper, books, and all school requisites. The girls are taught the same as the boys, but are not allowed to remain after the age of 11 years, when, if they wish it, they are transferred to another establishment, called the School of Industry, the expense of which is paid from this fund. Persons wishing to learn the Madras System of education, on bringing proper certificates of good conduct, are admitted into the school, and are boarded and lodged for about six weeks gratuitously, if they are not of sufficient abiiitv to pay for themselves. Tbe salary of the master is \u00a380 a year ; and be also receives \u00a320 a year for instructing 30 boys from Lord Crewe's trustees. He lives in the house, and is maintained there at the expense of the charity. The usher, who is in fact one of the head boys of the school, is also boarded and lodged in the house ; he receives no regular salary, but occasionally a gratuity. \u00a324 per annum is appropriated for the purchase of clothes, &c. as rewards to the teachers or assistants ; and \u00a320 yearly for putting them out apprentices to trades. On producing a certifi cate of good conduct from his master, three years after leaving school, every teacher is entitled to a reward of \u00a32. \u00a320 a year is set aside for rewards to the children. The mistress of the School of Industry receives a salary of \u00a328, and has the use of a bouse and garden, rented by the trustees of the Beadsmen, and an al lowance of coals. Bcadhouses. \u2014 This establishment was founded by Bishop Cosins, for four poor people, two men and two women, of Bishop Auckland. There are houses and other property in the town belonging to them, and which are let for \u00a327, Is. per annum, besides a rent-charge of \u00a34 yearly upon an estate in Allertonshire. The Beadspeople receive \u00a33, 6s. 8d. every three years, for renewing the cloaks worn by them when they attend at the bishop's chapel ; also \u00a34 annually from Lord Crewe's charities, and \u00a320 annually from Bishop Bar rington's charities. The Beadhouses are kept in repair by the bishop, who makes their inmates a gift of 10s. 6d. at Christmas. Wall's Charity. \u2014 AVilliam AVall, by will, September 24, 1670, bequeathed the following annual rent-charges out of his property in Escomb and Bondgate, viz. To the poor of the township of Bondgate in Auckland, 15s. ; to the master of the Free School there, 15s. : to the poor prisoners in the gaol at Durham, 15s. ; and to the poor box, or to the rest of the poor of St. Andrew Auckland, 15s. ; the several sums to be paid at Christmas, Easter, and Whitsuntide. Mr. Thomas Peacock, wdio now holds the above property, pays the several rent- charges. Pearson's Charily\u2014 Thomas Pearson, by will, April 16, 1713, devised a messuage and farm at AVesterton, which he held of the dean and chapter of Durham, to the vicar or parson of St. Andrew Auckland, and bis successors, in trust, for the poor of the said parish. The lease has since been renewed from time to time. By the last lease, September 26, 1826, the property was let for 21 years to the Rev. John Bacon, his executors, &c. at the yearly rent of \u00a31, 13s. 7d. ; the fine for renewal being \u00a3140, 19s. 7d. The premises are now let at \u00a360 a year, which is received by the Rev. George Fielding, and carried to the same account with other charities hereafter mentioned, amounting to \u00a319 per annum, and the money collected at the sacrament. Out of this money \u00a32, 10s. is paid annually to the parish clerk, in lieu of Easter-dues from the poor persons re- lieved. From \u00a315 to \u00a325 a year has been distributed to the poor of Bishop Auckland, in sums varying from ls. to 3s. ; and from \u00a310 to \u00a318 to the overseers of the other townships, for distribution. A sum is placed in a bank, to provide for the next renewal of the lease.

The land consists of about 3 acres of meadow-, and is let at \u00a36, 6s. per annum. \u00a360 has been received on account of a railway passing through it, with which two cottages have been erected on the scite of the original one, which had fallen down. The rents arising from these premises, instead of being appropriated to four persons, have been im properly distributed to the poor of the township of Shildon not receiving parochial relief, or in some cases in addition to their weekly pay, chiefly in sums of 10s. or 20s. Markets, Fairs, Trade, \u00a7c. \u2014 A weekly market is held here every Thursday ; and five fairs an- nually, viz. on Ascension-day, Corpus Christi-day, the Thursday before the 10th of October, and on the last Thursdays but one in March and October. The two latter were established in 1825, for the sale of horses, cattle, and sheep ; they are well attended, but the three ancient fairs are now nearly obsolete. An attempt was made in 1650 to establish fortnight fairs. The markets are well supplied with corn and other provisions. Two well-attended hirings for servants are held at May-day, and two at Martinmas. Petty sessiotis are held in a room beneath the chapel on the first Thursday in every month, when one or more of the following magistrates attend for the administra- tion of justice: \u2014 Sir William Chaytor, Bart., of Witton Castle; John Trotter, Esq., of Staindrop; Robert Surtees, Esq., of Red wort li ; J.

Since the formation of the railway from Witton Park, which passes throuo-h Shildon, this place has increased rapidly in size and population. At Old Shildon many new houses and cottages have been built ; and a spacious chapel of ease is now erecting, in the Gothic style, with lancet windows and a western tower. Chapel Row is a neat and uniform rano*e of houses ex tending from the eastern extremity of Old Shildon, and forming nearly a crescent, frontino* the south. New Shildon, a little to the south, is also a considerable village, where there is an exten sive depot of coals. Coaches run regularly, on alternate days, on the railway between this place and Darlington. Public houses, shops, and other businesses, are increasing in number ; and an Auxiliary Bible Society has been established. Shildon was held with Henknoll by the Belassis family, partly of the Lilburns.

At the assizes held at Durham, August 6, 1638, before Judge Berkeley, the singular spectacle was presented of trial by waging battle being offered and accepted for deciding the right to lands at Thickley, betwixt Ralph Claxton, demandant, and Richard Lil burn, tenant. The defendant appeared at ten o'clock in the forenoon by his attorney, ancl brought in his champion, George Cheney, in full array, with his stave and sand-bag, who threw down his gauntlet on the floor of the court, with five small pieces of coin in it. The tenant then introduced his champion, AArilliam Peverell, armed in the same manner, who also threw down his gage. The judge, after examining the champions, ordered them into the custody of his two bailiff's of the court, till eight o'clock next morning, when they were ordered to put in pledges to appear at the court of pleas on the 15th of September, at which time it was again deferred to December 22, and the king desired the judges of the northern circuit to hold conference and consider how the cause might be tried some other way. The result of the conference was, that six of the judges overruled the ob jection of Judge Berkeley, that the champions were hired, the exception being too late after battle waged and sureties given, and that in fact Lilburn was entitled to his trial by battle if he persisted. Means were found, notwithstanding, to defer the trial by battle from year to year, by finding some error in the record, till at length it was ordered that a bill should be brought in to abolish this mode of decision.

John, who is a twin, was born June 4, 1751 ; and, after attending the grammar school of his native town, was sent to Oxford, where his progress was so rapid that, on July 11, 1767, he was elected Fellow of Uni versity College, though he was then but 16 years of age. Having finished his education, he was entered a student of the Middle Temple in Hilary Term, 1772- Here he pursued his studies with the most intense application, and, after the usual noviciate, was called to the bar in 1776. He principally devoted his atten tion to the practice of the Courts of Equity ; but, from a natural timidity, shunned appearing at the Chan cery bar as a pleader, and confined himself chiefly to the business of an equity draughtsman, in which he was reputed extremely able. Finding this pursuit equally injurious to his health and advancement in life, he determined to quit tbe bar, and, it is said, went so far as to sell his chambers ; but, by the earnest intreaties of his friends, he consented to resume the practice of the profession, which he now entered into with increased activity and determination. His exertions in court were crowned with success : he soon acquired a very ex tensive practice, and great reputation*-as an able lawyer and excellent advocate. In a few years, he had more briefs than any council at the bar; and, in 1783, he procured a patent of precedency, by which be became entitled to all the honours of the silk gown, and ranked with the king's council. In the same year, he was introduced into parliament, being returned, through the interest of Lord AVTeymouth, for the borou-di of Weobly, in Herefordshire. On entering the house, he acted decidedly with the Pitt party ; and, on the^th of June, 1788, he was appointed solicitor-general, and received the honour of knighthood.

On July 18, 1799, he was ap- pointed Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas, on the resignation of Sir James Eyre ; and, at the same time, was elevated to the peerage, by the title of Baron Eldon of Eldon in the county of Durham. Shortly after, the resignation of Lord Roslyn opened his way to the custody ofthe great seal, which was committed to his care on April 14, 1801. The death of stir. Pitt, and the consequent change of administration, produced his lordship's resignation in February, 1806; but upon the return of stir. Pitt's friends to power, he was again appointed chancellor.

Since that time, notwithstanding his advanced age, he has ever been active in supporting the political principles which guided the former part of his life. On the passing of stir. Peel's Catholic Relief Bill, in 1829, a com- mittee of noblemen and gentlemen were nominated to conduct a subscription for the purpose of presenting to the Earl of Eldon a lasting testimonial for his eminent services during his long and laborious public life. It was understood to be the wish of his lordship that the money subscribed for tbe Eldon Testimonial should be applied to the establishment of six scholarships in University College, Oxford, to be called \" The Eldon Scholarships.\" The subscriptions amounted to several thousand pounds.

The use of the bath was to the Romans a necessary, rather than a luxury ; though their public baths were extremely magnificent. It was customary in these to anoint the body with oil or perfumes, and then to exercise themselves in the sph\u0153i'isteriiiiii. After this, they entered the adjoining caldarium, or warm bath, where they sat and washed themselves. The seat was below the surface of the water, and upon it they used to scrape themselves with bronze or iron instruments called slrigiles ; or this operation was performed by an attendant slave, much in the way that ostlers treat horses when they come in hot. They then rubbed themselves with their hands, and were washed from head to foot by pails or vases of water being poured over them. Being carefully dried, they were covered with a light shaggy mantle, called gausape. Effeminate persons had the hairs of their bodies pulled out with tweezers, their nails cut, and their bodies anointed or perfumed, even to the soles of their feet. After resuming their clothes, they went into the tepidarium, and either passed very slowly through, or staid some time in it, that they might not too suddenly expose their bodies to the atmo sphere in thefrigidarium. \u2014 Lib. of Ent.

ANDREW'S AUCKLAND. 305 Binchester was one of the vills resigned to the Earls of Northumberland ; but, though it is said not to have been restored to the church, Boldon Book states that it rendered 5s. cornage, one milch cow, one castleman, four chalders of malt, the like of meal or bread corn, and the like of oats ; and that for each carucate of land the villains ploughed and harrowed two acres at Coundon, and every of them made three portions in autumn for each oxgang with one man, and carried one tun of wine, and the millstones for Auckland mill ; that the drenges fed horse and dog, and attended the bishop's forest hunt with two greyhounds and five cords, followed the court, and served on embassies. By Hatfield's Survey, this place was held with Hunwick by Robert of Binchester, by virtue of the grant of the bishop, by foreign service. The family of Binchester held this property till 1420, when it was conveyed to Ralph Earl of AVestmoreland. After the attainder of the last earl, Binches- ter was purchased by the AVrens; and during the civil wars, Linley AArren, Esq., compounded for his estates for \u00a3300. Some years ago, this family sold their property here to Charles Lyon, Esq., who rebuilt Binchester Hall on a modern plan. It has recently been purchased by the bishop of Durham, and is at present unoccupied. The hall and a delightful terrace near it (beneath which hanging plantations adorn the declivity) command a fine view of the Castle, Park, and town of Bishop Auckland, the windings of the A\\rear, and the principal objects of the surrounding country.

The village of Byers Green is situated on the south side of the Wear, 4 miles north-north-east from Bishop Auckland, and contains two public houses and several wrights and other tradesmen. The township includes some lime-works and five farmsteads. In Bishop Hatfield's time, this place was held by Richard de Park, and was afterwards mostly the property of the Nevilles. After belonging to several successive proprietors, the greater part of it is now in the possession of R. E. D. Shafto, Esq. Byers Green Hall is the residence of Thomas Shafto, Esq.

Rumby Hill is a hamlet 4 miles north from Bishop Auckland, containing two public houses. The prospect from this place is extensive and beautiful. By Boldon Book, there were thirteen villains in Newton, whose services were similar to those of North Auckland. In Hatfield's Survey there are but two inconsiderable free tenants named. The exchequer lands let at a certain rent, and consisted of 40 tenements and 72 parcels of land. New ton-Cap was long the property and seat of the Bacon family, one of whom made considerable pro gress in the erection of a new mansion, which was never completed, and has for some years been in a state of rapid decay.

Here are a corn-mill, a brewery, two public houses, and a few tradesmen. By Boldon Book, this place was held by the Binchester family ; and the Burdons, Huttons, Eures, Nevilles, and other proprietors, occur at subsequent periods.

This parish is bounded by St. Andrew's Auckland on the west, by Aycliffe on the south, by Bishop Middleham and Kelloe on the east, by St. Oswald's and Brancepeth on the north, and by the chapelry of AAliitworth on the north-west. It includes four townships or constableries, viz. 1. Merrington; 2. Ferryhill; 3. Hett;* and, 4. Chilton. In 1801, the population of the parish was 1068; in 1811, 1098; and in 1821, 1279, being 271 families, inhabiting 257 houses. In 1828-9, the annual value of property assessed to the county-rate was \u00a36525, 4s. 3d. Merrington. Bishop AA7illiam de Carilepho gave the manor of Merrington to the church of Durham ; and, at the present day, the whole, with the exception of 100 acres of land belonging to Sir R. J.

In 1143-4, \"on the Eve of the Assumption of the A'irgin, AVilliam (Cumyn, the Scottish intruder) gathered together his men at the chapel of St. John (of Meringtoun), distant about five leagues from Durham, and began to turn the same church into a castle.

William's men did not sustain the onset. Some fled headlong; the other part barred themselves into the church, round which they had nearly completed the fosse ; and, manning the tower and the outworks which they had finished, vainly strove to drive off' the assailants with darts and arrows ; but the besiegers, reckless of wounds or death, forced their way through the win dows, and hurling firebrands on the defenders, were speedily masters of the place.\"-f- The large and well-built village of Merrington is situated 3 miles east-north-east from Bishop Auckland, on the centre of a broad and lofty limestone-ridge, and commands a prospect of the vale * Ferryhill and Hett are annexed to Durham Ward. t Contin.

The Church Is situated at the east end of the village, and forms a conspicuous object from the surroundino country. There are now no traces of the fosse said to have been dug around it by Cumyn. The building itself seems of high antiquity. The tower, nearly 60 feet high, rises from the centre of the nave, and is supported by two round Norman arches ; that to the west being plain, restino* on buttresses; and that to the east springing from clustered pillars with rude capitals. There are double round-headed lights on each side of the tower, which is surmounted by crockets and open battlements. The principal entrance of the church is from the south, and has been ornamented with pillars ancl zigzag ornaments, but is now covered by a porch. A south porch opens from the nave under a blunt-pointed arch, and is called Lawrence's porch. A narrow circular arch, beneath which is a neat screen, divides the nave and chancel.

The latter conveyed a moiety of the manor to John Jeft'rayson ancl John Morland, Esqrs., who immediately conveyed to John Lord Bishop of Durham. * \"The boar or brawn of Brancepeth,\" says Surtees, \"was a formidable animal, which made his lair on Brandon-hill, and walked the forest in ancient undisputed sovereignty from the AVear to the Gaunless. The marshy, and then woody vale, extending from Croxdale to Ferry-wood, was one of the brawn's favourite haunts, affording roots and mast, and the luxurious pleasure of volutation. Near Cleves-cross, Hodge of Ferry, after carefully marking the boar's track, dug a pitfall, slightly covered with boughs and turf, and then toling on his victim by some bait to the treacherous spot, stood armed with his good sword across the pitfall. ' At once with hope and fear his heart rebounds.' At length the gallant brute came trotting on bis onward path, and seeing the passage barred, rushed headlong on the vile pitfall. \u2014 The seal of Roger de Ferie still remains in the treasury, exhibiting his old antagonist, a boar passant.\" Besides the evidence of the stone in Merrington church-yard, mentioned above, a rough misshapen stone trough at a house in Ferryhill is said to have been used by the boar ; though the name of the good-natured person to whose courtesy so unwelcome a guest was indebted for the accommodation, has not been preserved. t Died at Chilton, December 26, 1819, Robert Roan, labourer, aged 105 years. u. 4 L VOL.

Bishoi* Middleham Is a manor belonging to the see of Durham By Boldon Book, there were in Middleham and Corn forth twenty-six villains, whose rents and services were similar to those of Boldon. There were seven cottagers, each of whom held six acres, and wrought from the feast of St. Peter to Martin mas two days in every week, and for the rest of the year one day in the week. Four bordarii held four tofts and crofts at 4s. rent, and tilled four portions of land. AVilliam the headboroughman held two oxgangs of land in Cornforth, in right of his office. The two places paid 17s. 8d. cornage, 10 marks for the mill, and provided a milch cow ancl a half. The punder had 12 acres, ancl ren dered four score hens and 400 eggs. Arkil held four oxgangs, and paid 14s. ; and Ralph held two oxgangs, paid 10s., and led five wain-loads of wood. The demesnes were in the bishop's hands.

Osbert, the nephew of Bishop Flambard, gave the church of Middleham to the prior and convent of Durham in 1146;* but, in 1278, it was instituted a vicarage, ancl annexed to Finchale Abbey, by Bishop De Insula, and so continued till the dissolution. The present building is supposed to have been erected by Bishop Beck. It stands on the hill south of the village, and consists ofa nave ancl side-aisles, each formed by three round pillars supporting pointed arches, and a chancel opening under a pointed arch. There are entrances both from the north and south. The ancient lancet lights have been nearly all replaced by modern sashes. The font is a fine old bason of Stanhope marble. Monumental Inscriptions. \u2014 A stone in the south wall of the chancel bears a Latin inscription to Edward Hutton, LL.B.; and a flat stone near the altar commemorates Jane Hutton, who died December 4, 1660.

It is now let at a good yearly rent of \u00a310. One moiety of this sum is distributed with Lady Freville's charity, and the other in a similar manner about Easter. * Dr. Samuel AVard was born at Bishop Middleham, being \"a gentleman of more antientry than estate.\" He was first scholar of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, and from thence elected to a Fellowship in Ema- nuel ; a situation with which he was so well satisfied, that it required considerable influence on the part of his friends to induce his acceptance of a domestic chaplaincy offered him by Montague, bishop of Bath and AVells. On the death of Dr. Aldrich in 1609, he was appointed Master of Sidney Sussex College; and in 1615, he was presented by Bishop Montague to the archdeaconry of Taunton. In 1617, he was collated to the prebend of Ampleford, A'ork ; and, in 1624, was rector of Much-Munden, Herts. He assisted at the Synod of Dort in 1618, in 1620 served the office of vice-chancellor, and in the year following was appointed Lady Margaret's Professor of Divinity, which office he held for about 20 years. During this time he enjoyed the friendship of many of the learned of his time. In a letter to Archbishop Usher, he says, \" There was the last week a codfish brought from Colchester to our market to be sold, in the cutting up which there was found in the maw of the fish a thing which was hard, which proved to be a book of a large 16\", which had been bound in parchment ; the leaves were glewed together with a jelly, and being taken out, did smell much at the first, but after washing of it Mr. Mead did look into it. It was printed, and he saved a table of the contents. The book was entituled ' A Preparation for the Cross ;' it may be an especial admonition to us at Cambridge. Mr. Mead upon Saturday read to me the heads of the chapters, which I very well liked. Now it is said to be made by Richard Tracey, of whom Bale maketh mention, Cent. q. p. 719- He is said to flourish there 1550 ; but I think the book was made in K. Henry 8ths time, when the six articles were a-foot : the book will be printed shortly.\" This was accordingly done, under the title of Vox Pisces, in 1626. While the succeeding storms were gathering through the kingdom, the Master of Sidney, notwithstanding his ad- mirable government of his house, his inflexible integrity, and the excellent simplicity of his life, remained unpreferred, being blamed for leaning to Puritanism and Calvinistic doctrine. In 1641, in consequence of his supposed principles, he was nominated one of the Committee for Religion in the Jerusalem Chamber, as well as one of the Assembly of Divines at Westminster ; but he never sat in either. In the following year, he concurred in the measure of sending the college plate to supply the royal mint at York ; and, resisting the republicans in a similar demand, he was deprived of his emoluments, and imprisoned for several weeks. A disease, contracted from confinement, put an end to his existence a short time after his enlargement, Sep- tember 6, 1643. His last words were, \" God bless the king \u2014 and Lord Hopton.\" Some of those who had been educated under his care did not desert him in his hour of trial, amongst whom was his favourite and affectionate pupil, Seth Ward (afterwards bishop of Salisbury), who attended him till his death. Dr. Ward's printed works are few : after the Restoration, some of his Determinations and Prelections were published by Seth Ward. \u2014 Surtees, vol. iii. p. 9. vol. 11.\u2014 42. 4 N"], [340, "DURHAM WARD. 320 The Hope. \u2014 This land, containing one acre, is enclosed with two acres more allotted to the parish clerk in 1693 ; and the whole is let for \u00a38 per annum.

It i* distributed to the poor of this township at Easter, with their share of the two preceding charities. Cornforth Is a large and pleasant village, irregularly built round a green of several acres, on the northern slope of a hill, 5 miles north-north-west from Sedgefield. Its name is supposed to be derived from the bishop's manor-mill on the beck, now a paper and corn-mill. There is another paper-mill in the township, a brick and tile manufactory, and a pottery at a hamlet to which it gives name. Here are five public houses, a school, and several tradesmen; and the township includes thirteen farms.* The Clarence Railway passes through it. In Bishop HatfieldVtime, Richard de Kellaw and Robert Usher were free tenants in Cornforth, and their possessions were afterwards united in the Shaws. The Hutchinsons,-f- Haswells, and Garthornes, occur at subsequent periods ; and the two latter families still hold considerable property. Mainsforth Is a hamlet and township, containing eight houses and three farms, in an open and airy situation, 3 miles north-west from Sedgefield. j The name is derived by Hutchinson from the Mam Ford over the morass between Middleham and Ferryhill. By Boldon Book, Robert de Maynesford held all the lands here in free service, except 26 oxgangs which belonged to the bishop. Hatfield's Survey states that the free rent of the vill was 36s. 8d. ; and AVilliam Hancelap, Thomas Smyth, Thomas AValworth, Hugh de AVestwyk, and others, are named as free tenants. The chief portion of the estate soon after became vested in the family of Herdwyk, from whom it descended to An thony Hebborne, and was forfeited by him in 1569. Parcels of it were granted to sundry persons, all of which appear to have centered in the Huttons, who, in 1708, sold Mainsforth to Robert Surtees, of Ryton, Gent., and Edward Surtees, of Crawcrook, ancestors of the present owner, Ro bert Surtees, Esq., F. S. A., whose splendid and elaborate \" History and Antiquities of the County Palatine of Durham\" is now in the course of publications * The farm of Stobcross derives its name from being the burial-place ofa suicide who had drowned him self in the Floatbeck. Some years before, he had seduced a poor girl, who \"put herself down for love\" near a ruined dovecot in this township, which had been the place of meeting with her traitor lover. Her spirit is still said to hover round the spot in the form of a milk-white dove, distinguished from its companions by three distinct crimson spots on the breast. t Hutchinson the historian states that the celebrated founder of the Hutchinsonian system was a native of Cornforth ; but other authorities affirm that he was born at Spenithorne, near Bedale. X On June 29, 1754, the following challenge appeared in the Newcastle Journal: \u2014 \"I take the liberty after this publick manner, to acquaint the country, that Peter Ditchburn, of Mainsforth, in the county of Durham, will throw the long bowls, a pound and a-half weight, leap, and pitch the bang (?) with any man in England, for ten or twenty pounds, and meet them at any place within twenty miles of Mainsforth aforesaid.\" \u00a7 stir. Cade describes the scite of a Danish fort at Mainsforth ; but its existence is denied by Hutchinson.

This place early gave name to a resident family. In 1262, an agreement was made with tive prior and convent of Durham, by the Thurstanton s, Fulthorps, and others, by which they conceded all their marsh to the prior, in consideration of certain pasturage on the moorof Fery. The Fulthorps held this manor till 1613, when it passed to the Shaws, from whom it passed to Sir Thomas Ro binson, of Rokeby, Bart., who conveyed to Hendry Hopper, of Durham, whose nephew, Robert Hopper AVilliamson, Esq., is the present proprietor.* Garmondsway Is an extra-parochial constablery, consisting of a few farms belonging to Sherburn Hospital, 4A miles north-north-west from Sedgefield. It is undoubtedly the Via Garmundi (Gormundus, the Dane) along which King Canute went barefooted pilprimage to the shrine of St. Cuthbert.

The parish of Brancepeth is bounded on the south by Merrington, Whitworth, and St. Andrew's Auckland, on the west by AAritton-le-AArear, on the north by Lanchester and the chapelry of Esh, and on the east by St. Oswald's in the suburbs of Durham. It contains seven townships, viz. 1. Brancepeth ; 2. Brandon and Byshottles; 3. Tudhoe; 4. Willington; 5. Stockley ; 6. Helmington Row; and, 7- Crook and Billy Row. The whole, in 1801, contained 1680 inhabitants; ancl, in * In July, 1822, a labourer, who was employed winning stones at Thrislington, turned up with his pick- axe some broad limestone flags, scarcely 18 inches below the surface, and discovered lying beneath them a perfect human skeleton. On the right side, near the hip bone, lay the iron head apparently of a lance or javelin. This first discovery was on the highest ground of tbe field. Another skeleton was found about 20 yards to the north-west, with a smaller lance head, also of iron. Eight or nine other sepulchres, containing human bones, were afterwards opened at various distances, but all apparently gathered round the crown of the field, where perhaps lay the chieftain ofthe race: in none of these were found any implements either of war or peace. The mode of sepulture was uniform and simple. The soil and marie, or soft limestone, had been cleared away to the depth of about two feet, and the skeleton lay on the level marie. On each side a row of large round stones was arranged, and on these were supported broad flags of limestone, which covered the deposit. The distance and regularity of the graves seem to forbid the supposition of their tenants having fallen in battle ; and this was probably the family burial-place of some early Saxon owner of the soil, before the conversion of his tribe to Christianity. In one deposit there were the remains either ofa female or a very young person; in another, the bones of a horse, and also some smaller animal, perhaps a dog, were found mingled with human remains. The graves were not dug east and west, but in various directions. The larger lance head measured nearly 8 inches in length, and a little above 1 inch in diameter ; the smaller, 7 inches by nearly 1 inch in diameter. The teeth of the two skeletons near which the lance heads were found were quite perfect. Some small portions of wood were adhering to the larger lance head. \u2014 Sykes's Local Records. t In 1284, Arnald de Auclent, Master of Sherburn, and Philip, rector of Middleham, made a composition relative to the tithe-corn of Garmondsway."], [342, "DURHAM AVARD. 322 1811, 1725; but, in 1821, they had increased to 2152, comprising 371 families, inhabiting 338 houses.

Brancepeth.* This village is pleasantly situated 4| miles south- west-by -west from Durham, at the point where the higli road to Wolsingham is crossed by the Stockley rivulet, which terminates in this parish at the AVear, wherein there are many huge stones, which Oulton says are never covered except when the river overflows; and when water is poured on them, it soon becomes brackish. At Salt-water Hough, not far distant, there is a salt spring in the middle of the river, which is seen bubbling up when the water is low, and tinges all the stones near it with a red colour : it is as salt as brine, and, when boiled, produces a great quantity of bay-salt. Brancepeth contains an inn ancl a few tradesmen ; ancl the township includes eleven farms. Brancepeth Castle stands to the south-west of the village. It was originally erected by the an cient family of Buhners, who were seated here for many generations, till Bertram, their last male representative, died, and his only daughter, Emma, married Geoffrey Neville, the grandson of Gilbert de Neville, a Norman who came into England with the Conqueror. Henry, their son, having been in arms with the refractory barons, in the 17th of John, gave 100 marks to regain the king's favour; and, as a security for his loyalty, he engaged to forfeit all his possessions, and deli vered two hostages, together with this castle to be held at the king's pleasure. He died without issue in 1227, a\"d his estates devolved upon his sister Isabel, who was espoused by Robert Fitz- Meldred, lord of Raby, by whom she had a son Geoffrey, who, in honour of his mother, assumed the surname of Neville (see Raby, p. 200, &c). After the forfeiture, this castle and its appendages were sold in 1633, by the king's commissioners, to Lady Middleton, Abraham Crosselis, and John Jones, who, in 1636, conveyed them to Ralph Cole, of Newcastle, in trust for his son Nicholas, afterwards Sir Nicholas Cole, whose son, Sir Ralph Cole,-f- in consideration of \u00a316,000, together * Popularly supposed to be derived from Brawn's path (see page 311), as Brandon is from Brawn's den; but the dedication of the parish church to St. Brandon, abbot of Clonfert in Ireland, excludes at least the latter part of the hypothesis.

Anthony Lord Grey, eighth Earl of Kent of that name, was the son of George Grey, Esq., and grandson of George Grey, second Earl of Kent. He was born at Brancepeth, and, being educated for the church, became rector of Burbach in Leicestershire, \" where he preached constantly, and kept an hospitable house for the poor according to his estate.\" On the death of his kinsman, Henry Grey, seventh Earl of Kent, in 1639, the title descended to him ; but though he was summoned as a peer to parliament, he excused himself on account of his age, and \" abated nothing in the constancy of his preaching, so long as he was able to be led up into the pulpit. \u2014 Such was his humility that honours did not change manners in him.\" He died 104-, and was succeeded in the title by his eldest son Henry. \u2014 Fuller's Worthies. t Member of parliament for the city of Durham in 1678 and the following parliament. \"This family,\" says Sir C.

He was taught the art by Vandyke, and is said to have retained Italian painters in his house to the injury of his fortune. He died August 9, 1704, and was buried in the family vault at Brancepeth. The family fell as suddenly as it rose, like a bright exhalation in the evening, and the grandchildren of Sir Ralph died in landless poverty.

These windows were erected in 1821, by stir. Collins, of London. Considerable alterations have been made in the disposition of the gardens, pleasure-grounds, &c. The park is well stocked with fine deer, and was enlarged a few years ago by the addition of upwards of 100 acres of land.

The side-aisles are each formed by two light octagonal pillars, supporting pointed arches. The entrance to the chancel is by a pointed arch, beneath which is a screen and lofty spires of beautiful trellis-work. The chan- cel is regularly stalled, and lighted by a large window of five compartments under a pointed arch to the east, with two others to the south, and three to the north. A porch on the south sideof the chancel opens beneath a circular arch, and is lighted by three windows : it is used as a vestry, and contains an antique carved chest.

The Nevilles anciently held the right of presentation to this living, which, after their attainder, was vested in the crown. In 1695, the advowson was held by Thomas Swinborne, Esq. ; but fall ing into Chancery, it was purchased about 120 years ago, for \u00a31750, by Mr. Goodfellow, from whom it has descended to the Shaftos of AVhitworth. The rector is entitled to all tithes. The parsonage-house is a neat modern building, looking over an extensive meadow in front, around which there is a beautiful gravel walk, half a mile in extent, overhung with sycamores, &c. Charities. Dobbinson's Charity. \u2014 Anne Dobbinson, by will, January 21, 1662, bequeathed the interest of \u00a366, 13s. 4d. to the poor of this parish, viz. \u00a32, 5s. to AVillington, 15s. to Helmington, Crook, and Billy Row, and 20s. to the other townships. In 1745, the principal was laid out in the purchase of about 7 acres of land in the town ship of AVillington, now let for \u00a39 a year. In 1823, tbe parishioners converted an old cottage on this land into a schoolhouse, the master of which pays a yearly rent of \u00a31.

Grice's Charity. \u2014 Henry Grice, ofthe city of London, merchant tailor, left certain property in Hamsterley, the rents thereof to be applied in the purchase of bread to be distributed to eight poor inhabitants of Brance peth and four of Stockley, in the parish church every Sunday after divine service. The property consists of a barn, stable, and yard, and about 40 acres of land, let at a good rent of \u00a330, 10s. per annum. The prac tice has been to purchase wheat, and to have it ground and baked for every alternate Sunday, when 24 loaves arc given away to poor persons appointed by the four-and-twenty. Township of Tudhoe. \u2014 Wilson's Charity. \u2014 Henry AAllson, in 1716, bequeathed \u00a320 for the use ofthe poor of Tudhoe. This sum is in the bands of Mr. Peter Richardson, who pays 16s. annually as interest, for teaching one or two poor boys of Tudhoe to read. Holywell, to the east of Brancepeth, in Bishop Hatfield's time was held of the Nevilles by John Randolf, whose three daughters married AVilliam Hee, AVilliam de Elmeden, and John Fossour. Thomas Elmeden exchanged his lands in this parish for others in Elmeden with John de Neville ; and they remained in that family till the attainder. Brandon. The village of East Bratidon, so called to distinguish it from a farm named West Brandon, is situated 3i miles west-south-west from Durham, and contains a school, three public houses, and several tradesmen. The township, a part of which is distinguished by the name of Byshottles, in cludes twenty-three farms, two corn-mills, a paper-mill at Langley,* ancl a bleaching-mill. On the crown of Brandon Hill, which is a very lofty eminence, there is a curious tumulus, of an oblong form, 120 paces in circumference at the base, and about 24 feet in perpendicular height ; but whe ther it was erected for a beacon, or covers the remains of some distinguished hero, has not been ascertained, for it has never been opened, and is now covered with a thick plantation of fir.

It is said that some of the murderers of Thomas a Becket fled to Haireholm in this township after the fact, and built a chapel to his memory. Bur negill, sometimes written Burninghill, derives its name from the hill overlooking the gill or valley of the river Browney. It anciently gave name to a resident family, and, after the attainder of the Nevilles, was held by the Hedworths. Littleburn, anciently the seat of the Calverleys, and in mo dern times of the Doubledays and Reeds, is at present the residence of W. A. Cunningham, Esq. Burn Hall was anciently held of the lords of Brancepeth by the Brackenburys, from whom it passed by marriage to the Claxtons. \u2014 Claxton, of Burn Hall, Esq., was engaged in the North ern Rebellion, but was excepted out of the act of attainder at the earnest request of the Bowes family, with whom he was related by marriage. This estate was subsequently the property of the Peacocks, and afterwards passed to the Smiths.* It now belongs to Bryan John Salvin, Esq., who has recently erected an elegant mansion near the scite of the old hall.-f- Tudhoe. This pleasant and healthy village, anciently called Tudhowe, is situated near the source of a brook, 1 mile south of the river Wear, and 5 miles south-south-west from Durham. It contains two large boarding-schools for young ladies and gentlemen, a day-school, and a public house ; and the township includes eight farms and a paper-mill. In 1279, Hugh Gubyoun was lord of Tudhoe, which afterwards belonged to the Nevilles. The Salvins are now the principal proprietors here. AVillington Is a village and township on the north side of the AVear, ancl on the line of the great Roman road, 4 miles north from Bishop Auckland. It contains a brick ancl tile manufactory, a school, a public house, ancl eight farmsteads. Two neat mansions here are occupied by Colonel R. AV. Mills and William Mills, Esq. In the time of Cutheard, second bishop of Chester, this place was given by one Barnard, a priest, to St. Cuthbert, that he might be admitted as a member of the convent. The family of Bowes had possessions here, which afterwards became united to the large estates of the Nevilles. AVillington now belongs to William Russell, Esq., who recently purchased some property here belonging to the Greenwells. * Dr. John Smith, a famous orthodox divine, was born at Lowther in 1659, settled at Durham 1681, ad mitted a minor canon 1682, and was nominated to the churches of Croxdale and AVitton-Gilbert in 1686; be went to Madrid as chaplain to Lord Lansdowne, then ambassador. In 1694, Bishop Crewe constituted him his domestic chaplain ; and in 1695, he was collated to the rectory and hospital of Gateshead, and to a prebend of Durham in the month of September ; in 1699, was treasurer of the cathedral ; in 1704, he was collatedto the_ rectory of Bishopwearmouth, and built the parsonage-house there; died at Cambridge, July 30, 1715, \u00e6t. 56, and was buried in St. John's chapel. He married Mary, eldest daughter of AVilliam Cooper of Scarborough. George, his son, was of Burn Hall, born May 7, 1693 ; took orders in tbe Nonjuring church, and was made titular bishop of Durham ; a famous antiquary, and editor of Bede's works, and a tract enti tled \"Saxons not converted to Popery;\" ob.

It does not appear to have ever been severed from the chief manor of Brancepeth. Helmington-Row Is a small township, 4| miles north-by-west from Bishop Auckland. It was anciently held by the Birdons, and was afterwards divided amongst a number of proprietors. Four of the farms in this township are now the property of AVilliam Russell, Esq. ; and the remaining one, Job's Hill, be longs to Mr. J. Greenwell. Crook and Billy-Row. Crook is a scattered village, 5 miles north-north-west from Bishop Auckland, a part of it extend ing into the township of Helmington-Row. It contains a corn-mill, a school, two public houses, and a few mechanics and tradesmen. Billy-Row is a hamlet and joins township with Crook ; and here is an eminence, called Billy-hill, which is said to be sometimes recognized by distant mariners. The township includes sixteen farms. It was an ancient member of the manor of Brancepeth, and now belongs to William Russell, Esq. CHAPELRY OF ESH. The chapelry of Esh, or Ash, occupies the lofty ridge of land between the rivers Derness and Browney, which form its southern and northern boundaries. It is bounded on the east by the pa rish of St. Oswald's, and on the west joins that of Lanchester, on which it is dependent. In 1801, the population was 276, which in 1811 had increased to 383, and in 1821 to 470, consisting of 69 families, inhabiting 65 houses. The annual value of property assessed to the county-rate in 1828-9 was \u00a31563, 10s. The chapelry includes ten farmsteads. Esh anciently gave name to a resident family, the various branches of which held the estate from the middle of the 13th century till the extinction of male issue in the reign of Henry V 1 1 1 . The two daughters of Anthony Eshe, Elizabeth and Margaret, intermarried with Thomas Norton and AVilliam Smythe of Nunstainton ; the latter of whom engaged in the Northern Rebellion, and forfeited his life estates here, and at East Herrington, Walworth, and Nunstainton. His son, George Smythe, succeeded to the inheritance; whose grandson was created a baronet on the Re storation. Sir Edward Joseph Smythe, of Acton Burnall, co. Salop, Bart., is the lineal represen tative of the family ancl proprietor of Esh. The village of Esh* is situated 5 miles west-north-west from Durham. It contains a dame-school, a public house, and a blacksmith's and cartwright's shops. A stone cross stands here, inscribed I. H. S., and, on the other side, 1687- Esh Hall, a long irregular building, fronting the south, is supposed, from the arms on the gateway, to have been erected after 1660, by Sir Edward, the first baronet, whose descendants soon deserted it for their maternal estates in Shropshire. A cham ber on the highest story has been fitted up as a domestic chapel. * John Hunter died here September 23, 1806; he bad completed his 106th year the preceding April. vol. n. 4 P"], [348, "DURHAM WARD. 328 The Chapel This chapelry is dependent on Lanchester. A small pension was reserved on the dissolution, and the endowment has since received augmentations from Lord Crewe's trustees and from Queen Anne's Bounty. The chapel was almost entirely rebuilt in 1770, with \u00a3100 from Lord Crewe's trustees and some other subscriptions. It consists of a long narrow nave and chancel of equal height and breadth, and ofa south porch, which opens under a low pointed arch. This portion alone is perhaps part of the old chapel; and here, when Hutchinson wrote, lay a fine recumbent effigy of stone, supposed to belong to the family of De Eshe.

Catholic Chapel. \u2014 This edifice is of stone, ancl covered with the flags so common in this part of the county. It is a neat plain structure, and, with a house for the clergyman, was built on land obtained from the late Sir Edward Smythe, Bart. The Rev. W. Fletcher officiates here and at the Brooms on alternate Sundays. The number of communicants at Esh chapel is about 120.-f- F/ass is situated close to the Derness, and belonged to the Brasses, Johnsons, and Halls. It is now the property of Lady Peat. Blackburn was anciently the estate of the Carlisles, and passed in marriage to the Thirkelds in 1488, who sold it to John Wrangham before 21st Eliz. It now be longs to the Misses Stringer. Ushaw is a village, containing a public house, three-quarters of a mile east from Esh. * Esh was part of the dissolved collegiate church of Lanchester; and the tithes of corn and bay were granted by the crown, 30th Eliz., to Edmond Doddyng and Miles Downing, Gents. They have passed through various bands to the Smythes, who bave recently sold several portions of them. t There was a previous chapel about a mile from the scite of the present edifice. \" The reliques of seve ral ancient Roman Catholic families,\" says Surtees, \" seem to have gathered round the old hall of Ash, both before and after its desertion by its owners ; a circumstance which generally took place during the existence of that system of compression and exclusion generated by the penal laws ; when the younger branches of Catholic families were prevented from entering on any active line of life, and had no resource but to gather round their chiefs, existing on such scanty annuities as the family estates could provide.\" The Rev. Ferdi nando Ashmall, the last survivor of the Ashmalls of Amerston, resided at Esh many years, and officiated at the chapel. He died February 5, 1798, aged 104 years. A writer in the Catholic Magazine and Review for March, 1832, describes the travelling costume and equipage of Mr. Ashmall as \" at once characteristic of the man, and the times in which he lived, when to be known as a Catholic priest might have endangered his safety, or exposed him to insult at least. The old leathern gaiters, drawn considerably above the knee, the left heel alone armed with a spur, the well worn grey coat, the cheque cloak wrapped up and fixed behind the saddle, and the slouched hat drawn carefully over the flaxen wig. Mounted upon a pony, whose colour age recounted should have been white, but whose rough and soiled coat wore the appearance of no great ex pense of grooming, and whom the loss of sight rendered at once unfashionable and unsafe. The salutation of the peasant, as going to his daily toil, of ' Weel, I warrant ye are for the fair :' and the ready reply of ' Aye, aye, I reckon see *.' has afforded many a joke to his friends.\""], [349, "WITTON-GILBERT. 329 Ushaw College.\u2014 When the English Catholic Secular College at Douay in French Flanders was seized by the republican army, the professors and students who had not previously fled were im- prisoned at Dourlens in Picardy, from whence they escaped to England in 1794. Shortly after their arrival, the greater part of them established a seminary at Crook Hall, where the Rev. Tho- mas Eyre was the first president and professor of divinity, and the learned historian, Dr. Lingard, the first vice-president and professor of philosophy. This situation becoming too small for the growing establishment, Dr. Gibson, Catholic bishop of the district, conceived the design of forming another on a larger scale; and, aided by the liberal support of the Catholic clergy and laity, he was enabled to raise the present ample edifice on the Ushaw estate, which consists of 250 acres of land, and was purchased from Sir E. J. Smythe, Bart. The building was commenced in 1804; and on July 19, 1808, the president and his community took possession of their new habitation. The whole was not finished, however, till November, 1819- Dr. Gibson, to whom it owed its ex istence, lived to witness its completion, and died in June, 1821. The Rev. Thomas Eyre died in 1810, and was succeeded by the Rev. Dr. John Gillow. On the death of the latter on July 6, 1828, Dr. Youens, the vice-president, was appointed to the presidency. He resigned in April, 1833, and was succeeded by Dr. Briggs, the Coadjutor. Ushaw College is beautifully situated on an eminence, about 4 miles west from Durham. It is a large quadrangular building of stone, inclosing a spacious court. The play-grounds are exten- sive and well laid out ; and there are improving plantations on three sides of the house, the sombre recesses on the west being appropriated for the burial-ground. The interior of the College is com- modious; and there is an ambulacra, or broad passage round the court, inclosed on all sides, with large windows at suitable distances, so that no inclemency of weather can deprive the students of exercise. The refectory is the largest dining-room in the north ; and the dormitories are airy and capacious. The library contains above 11,000 volumes, on divinity, the classics, &c. ; 4000 of which were recently presented by the Rev. Mr. AA^ilkinson, Kendal, and are, for the most part, rare, choice, and costly, of superior editions, and the fruit of many years patient collecting. The chapel contains a fine-toned organ, and mass is celebrated every Sunday. Besides containing from 50 to 60 private rooms, the house is sufficiently capacious to accommodate 140 students, together with professors. The course of studies and mode of teaching are nearly the same as were pursued at Douay. Five years are devoted to the Latin, Greek, English, and French languages ; to history* sacred and profane ; geography, writing, arithmetic, and elocution. The study of poetry occupies one year more ; rhetoric another ; then follow two years of philosophy ; and, lastly, three years assio-ned to theology and the sacred scriptures complete the course. The number of superiors and masters employed is fourteen. The northern district is supplied with Catholic clergymen from Ushaw ; while the English Secular Colleges at Rome and Afalladolid are considerably indebted to this institution for their students and superiors. CHAPELRY OF AVITTON-GILBERT. The chapelry of Witton-Gilbert, with the dissolved rectory of Kimblesworth annexed, is bounded by Lanchester and Esh on the west and south-west, by the parish of St. Oswald's on the south, by the chapelry of St. Margaret's on the east, and by the parish of Chester-le-Street on the north.

In 1828-9, the annual value of property assessed to the countv-ratc* was \u00a33505. AA7itton-Gilbert. Witton derives its addition from Gilbert de la Ley, who held it in the time of Bishop Pudsey, with Tanfield de la Leigh, and a considerable tract of country to the west. He gave 60 acres of arable land to the almoner of St. Cuthbert, and founded an hospital at AA^itton for five lepers. Philip dc la Ley gave lands to Robert de Musters, but resumed and bestowed them on AVilliam de Laton, in whose heirs general they descended to the Musgraves and Colvilles, who alienated their property in Witton-Gilbert in small parcels. Fulforth gave name to a resident family, and afterwards belonged to the Eshes, Hildyards, AVrays, and others. The village of AAHtton-Gilbert is situated 3j miles north-west from Durham, on the north side of the river Browney, ancl contains four public houses and several mechanics and tradesmen.* This township and Kimblesworth include twenty farms ; one of which, called Sacriston-heugh, derives its name from being anciently appropriated to the sacrist in the church of Durham. The Church. Witton-Gilbert was anciently a dependent chapel under St. Oswald's, and was made parochial in 1423, on the petition of AVilliam Batmanson, John Shepherdson, and other inhabitants.-}- The church, with the parsonage, stands a little to the south of the village. It is a small neat structure, consisting of a nave and chancel, separated from each other by an oaken screen. The chancel has an old pointed light ; but the windows of the nave are modern. A gallery was erected at the west end of the nave in 1742.J An altar -tomb in the church-yard belongs to the family of Hopper of Witton-Gilbert ; and there is a Latin inscription on a head-stone to John Smith, killed by a thunder stroke April 28, 1723, aged 42.

Beaurepaire. \u2014 The house and chapel of Beaurepaire (corruptly called Bcarpark) were founded by Prior Bartram IL, 1244 \u2014 1258, as a place of solace and retreat for himself and his successors; and Prior Hugh enclosed the park and added to the buildings. Bishop Beck, during his quarrel with the convent, broke down the fences of the park, and drove out the game. In 1315, the Scots committed ravages here ; and again in 1346, when King David and his army lay at Beaurepaire. Prior Fossour made this place his residence, and re-edified the buildings.* After the dissolution, the manor-house and park were regranted to the deanery; but the ruin of the neglected buildinos is said to have been completed by the Scottish armies in 1641 and 1644. Dean Granville, however, made a claim on the executors of his predecessor, Sudbury, for the dilapidations of Bearpark.-f- The ruins of Beaurepaire lie about 3 miles north-west from Durham, within a rapid sweep of the Browney. Of the chapel, only the shattered and roofless shell is now standing. The walls have been supported by buttresses, between which were double lights; and the east window consists of three lights under a square label. The interior has been highly ornamented with pilasters, &c. Two niches with pedestals on each side of the east window have apparently contained images. An apartment under the chapel has been lighted by small square windows. A long buildino*, the gavels of which are still standing, supposed to be the refectory, adjoins the chapel on the west : a large south window is divided into twelve lights by a transom and mullions. Other confused frag ments of buildings may be traced. Kimblesworth Consists of two farms ancl four houses, situated 3 miles north-by- west from Durham. It was an ciently a rectory ancl peculiar belonging to the convent of Durham ; and the foundations of its little church may be still traced. It fell to decay, and the parish was annexed to Witton-Gilbert in 1 593.^ * There were anciently Keepers of this manor.

It was after wards parcel of the estates of Robert and Michael Tempest, of Holmside, attainted in 1569; and Kimblesworth became subsequently the property of the Boweses, Sandfords, and Honeywoods, from which last it passed to General Lambton, and is now the property of the Earl of Durham. Findon Hill, a tenement in this parish, passed from the Boweses to the Harbotles, and aftet wards to the Hildyards of Fulforth and others. It also now belongs to the Earl of Durham. PARISH OF PITTINGTON. This parish is bounded by those of St. Oswald and St. Giles in the suburbs of Durham on the west, by Houghton-le-Spring on the north, by Easington on the east, and by Kelloe on the south. It includes three constableries: 1. Pittington, Elemore, and Hetton-on-the-Hill ; 2. Shadforth and Ludworth ; and, 3. Sherburn. The lands of Sherburn Hospital are extra-parochial. This parish in 1811 contained 818 inhabitants; and in 1821, 875, being 193 families, inhabiting 189 houses. In 1828-9, the annual value of property assessed to the county-rate was \u00a34969, 10s. The parish abounds in limestone and coal. Pittington, Anciently Piddingdune, derives its name from the Pidding brook. Bishop William de Carilepho granted North and South Pittington to the church of Durham; and, after the dissolution, they were annexed to the cathedral. The lands not allotted to the prebends were let on leases; the principal portion being the Hallgarth estate, which was leased first to Sir Henry Anderson, Knt., Provided always, that our byshop of Durham and stir.

The tenants here, during the Commonwealth, were in duced to buy the reversions at about eight years purchase, but, on the Restoration, lost the benefit of their bargain, and were obliged to pay for renewing their leases. Margaret, sister and heiress of William Simpson, was the wife of Edward Shipperdson of Murton, whose descendant, Edward Shipperdson, Esq., is still lessee of the manor of Pittington-Hall-Garth. The village of Pittington is situated at the foot of a lofty limestone hill, 4 miles east-by-north from Durham, and contains a school and several public houses and tradesmen. Hal/garth (so called from the Prior's Hall, built here by Hugh AVhitehead, last prior and first dean of Durham) is about half a mile to the south, and contains the church, the family mansion of the Shipperdsons, and the vicarage. The old hall was taken down by Dr. Tunstall, prebendary of thc tenth stall. Here is a colliery belonging to the Marquis of Londonderry, from whence a railway, 8 miles long, extends to the river Wear at Penshaw.* Hallgarth Mill is situated to the west of the village. The township includes eight farms. -f- The Church Retains traces of high antiquity. There is a low oblong tower on the west, supported by buttresses, and surmounted with battlements and pinnacles. The north aisle is formed by four circular arches and a pointed one, supported by cylindrical pillars, which are alternately fluted and surrounded by a spiral band. The circular arches are adorned with double rows of zigzag ornaments. The cor responding pillars of the south aisle are plain cylinders supporting pointed arches. The chancel is separated from the nave by a plain round arch. The east end of the chancel has been rebuilt, and contains three narrow round-headed lights ; and there is an ancient pointed window to the south. The windows of the nave are modern. From fragments of arches now built up in the walls, it would appear that the church was anciently much larger than at present. \\ Monuments. \u2014 In the vestry is preserved the mutilated effigy of a knight in armour, similar to that already described at Whitworth (p. 313), except that the shield is plain. On a blue marble slab within the altar-rails is a Latin inscription to Ralph Shipperdson, Esq., who died July 16, 1719, aged 42. Another, before the altar, records the deaths of Thomas Hall, Esq., of Elemore Hall, April 10, 1680; of Elizabeth, his daughter and heiress, and wife of Thomas Conyers, Esq., July 18, 1685, aged 24; of Susanna, daughter of Henry Firebrace, Esq., ancl wife ofthe above Thomas Hall, November 28, 1715 ; and of Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Conyers, Esq., and wife of George Baker, Esq., July 5, 1725, aged 35. On another slab : \u2014 \"To the memory of George Baker, late of Elemore Hall, Esq. who died the 15th May, 1774, aged 51. And here also lies Judith Baker his wife, who died April 30, 1810, aged 86.\" * In the autumn of 1827, when the Duke of AVellington visited some of the principal towns, cities, and noblemen's seats in the north of England, a splendid carriage was built, at the cost of \u00a3200, by the Marquis of Londonderry, for the purpose of conveying his grace along this rail-road. Accordingly, the duke, having arrived with the marquis from A\\rynyard, ' entered the carriage at Hallgarth, and was accompanied along the whole line to Penshaw by the greetings of many thousand spectators. + On May 26, 1812, the Society of Arts presented a gold medal to the Rev. Dr. F. Haggit, for his im provement of 50 acres of waste land at Pittington. X There were two chantries in this church : that of St. Katherine, founded by Matilda, the daughter of AVilliam ; and that of St. Mary the Virgin. Jobn Kirkman, the last incumbent of both chantries, had a pension of \u00a34 per annum, which he received in 1553.

Elemore, included in the estates of Little Haswell and Haswell Grange, in the parish of Easing ton, was given by Bishop Pudsey to his monastery of Finchale before 1190. After the dissolution, the manor of Little Haswell became the property of the family of Anderson, from whom it passed in 1631 to AVilliam Hall, of Newcastle, merchant, for \u00a34600- By successive marriages, Elemore passed to George Baker, Esq., of Crook, grandfather of the present proprietor, George Baker, Esq. Elemore House is seated in a hollow vale ; and the estate has been recently improved by planta tions, &c. Hetton-on-the-Hill, a hamlet to the north-east of Elemore, appears anciently to have been united with Hetton-le-Hole (see vol. i. p. 368). It belonged to the Daldens, Boweses, Blakis tons, Collingwoods, ancl others ; ancl, in the last century, it passed from the Sparrows to George Baker, Esq., of Elemore. Belmont is the seat of the Rev. Percival Spearman AVilkinson. Shadforth. This village is situated 5 miles east-south-east from Durham, and contains a school, two public houses, two blacksmiths, and a joiner and cartwright. The township includes fifteen farms. Shad forth was anciently a member of Queringdonshire ; ancl, by Boldon Book, Shadforth, North Sher burn, and Cassop, had 51 villains, whose services were similar to those of Boldon. In Shadforth only one free tenant (Thomas) is named, who held two oxgangs of land, rendering 40d. fee-farm rent, and serving on embassies. By Hatfield's Survey, Sir Ralph Eure, Knt., had acquired the lands of Thomas de Tesetlale; ancl there were two other free tenants, Isaac Bonner and the heir of John Freeman. Sixteen bond tenants held each a messuage and two oxgangs of land. Shadforth is within the bishop's manor of Easington. On August 26, 1635, a division of common lands in Shadforth and Sherburn took place. Ludworth, in which the church acquired an interest at an early date, was held by a family of the same name from before 1209 to 1349, and afterwards by the Holdens, who alienated it to Roger Thornton, merchant, whose heiress carried it to the family of Lumley. In the time of Bishop Pil kington, it was sold to Sir Richard Belasyse, of Morton, Knt., from whose descendants it passed to the Carrs of Cocken. The old tower of Ludworth, supposed to have been built in 1422 by Thomas Holden, is a dark, gloomy pile, resembling one of the lowest class of Border fortresses. Sherburn. The villao-e of Sherburn, so called from its situation on the ancient Shire-brook or burn which formed the northern limit of Queringdonshire, is situated 3 miles east-by-south from Durham, and contains three public houses, a school, and a few tradesmen ; and the township includes a corn-mill and nine farms. By Boldon Book, Ulkill held lands in North Sherburn, and Christian Cementa rius and others held South Sherburn, in which were also ten cottagers. In Hatfield's Survey, only one Sherburn occurs ; and the services of the bond-tenants were similar to those in Shadforth. In the 16th century, a family named Pearson had acquired freehold property here. Sherburn Hall, formerly the seat of the Tempest family, was purchased in 1827 from Thomas Hopper, Esq., by John Pemberton, Esq., who now occupies it. Sherburn Hospital.

It was founded about the year 1181, by Bishop Pudsey, for the reception of 65 vol. ii. 4 R"], [356, "336 DURHAM WARD. poor lepers, a master, and other officers, and dedicated to Christ, the Blessed Arirgin, Lazarus, and his sisters Martha and Mary. Constitutions were framed for its government by the founder, and afterwards confirmed by Bishop Kellaw.* In the time of Bishop Langley, great abuses were com plained of; ancl the pious institution being converted into private emolument, and the buildings suf fered to go to ruin, that prelate issued a commission, dated September 4, 1429, directed to AVilliam Chancellor, his temporal chancellor, ancl others, empowering them to visit and examine the dilapi dations in the hospital erections, ancl to make inquiries concerning the abuses of the charity. Upon the commissioners reporting the miserable condition of the institution, the bishop applied to Pope Eugene IAr. for redress, who granted him a faculty to make new rules and ordinances for the better governing thereof, which he accordingly did on July 22, 1434. It appears by these rules that the leprosy was at that time almost eradicated, and two lepers, \" if they could be found,\" were to be admitted, who were to be kept apart from the rest of the poor people admitted to the house. The latter were to be 13 in number, and each was to be provided with meat and drink of lOd. value every week, or lOd. ready money at their own option, ancl to have yearly 6s. 8d. for fuel and clothes, and to mess and lodge in the same house, anc) daily to attend mass. In 1557, Anthony Salvin, master, petitioned Bishop Tunstall that a commission of inquiry might issue, relative to the abuses committed by Thomas Leghe ancl Anthony Bellasis, previous masters ; which commission was accordingly issued, and depositions were taken thereon April 27, 1557- Owing to the disorders produced by the differences of faith at that time, an act was passed in 27th Eliz. (1584), whereby this establishment was re-incorporated by the name of \"the Master and Brethren of Christ's Hospital, in Sherborne, near Durham, in the county of Durham.\" The num ber of brethren by this act was increased to 30, to be nominated (with one exception in favour of the owners of Thornley) by the master, who was to be appointed by the bishop, and be a preacher, having no cure or charge of souls elsewhere. In 1594, a commission of inquiry visited this and other hospitals in the county. Some additional statutes were made by Bishop Matthew in 1595,-f- * By these, the male and female lepers were to have their respective houses at separate sides of the area. Each leper was to have a loaf and a gallon of beer daily ; three days in the week flesh meat, and four days fish ; so that one dish of meat, lish, cheese, or butter, should serve two ; but on great days, two dishes were to be provided, particularly on Quadragesima day, when they were to have fresh salmon or other fish, if they could be had, for one dish ; and on Michaelmas day they should have geese, a goose to every four ; but if that festival happened on a weekly fast day, the goose feast was to be postponed to Sunday. AVith fresh fish, flesh, or eggs, a measure of salt was delivered, the 20th part of a razer. During Lent, each had a razer of wheat to make furmenty, and two razers of beans to boil ; sometimes greens or onions ; and every day ex cept Sunday the 7th part of a razer of bean meal ; but on Sunday a measure and a half of pulse to make gruel. They were allowed yearly three yards of woollen cloth, russet or white, six yards of linen, and six yards of canvas, with other necessaries, as trusses of straw and bundles of reeds, with four yule clogs for the vigils of our Saviour. The brethren were to choose their prior, and the sisters their prioress. They were allowed fire from Michaelmas to the day of All Saints. Certain rules were ordained for tbe sick, for fune rals, and prayers. From Pentecost to Michaelmas, red herrings and salted viands were prohibited ; and each member was allowed in money, at two days in the year, 5d., and once in the year 5s. They were allowed to see their friends ; and strangers from a distance were suffered to rest in the Hospital all night. Disobe dient members were punished, at the discretion of the prior and prioress, by corporal correction ; for further contumacy, they were reduced to bread and water ; and after the third offence, they were liable to be ejected. + The allowance of diet for the poor brethren was as follows : \u2014 \" At breakfast on work days, One kind of milkness, one loaf of bread weighing about twenty-four ounces to four, and small beer sufficient. At dinner, On Sundays and Thursdays two kinds of flesh meat, one roasted on Sundays, and on the other days two kinds of milkness and one of milk, and another of fish or flesh as best may be provided, and each day to four a loaf of tempsed bread, weighing xxiiij ounces, and a loaf of brown bread, weighing xxiiij ounces, and single beer sufficient.

That the master should be always a person in holy orders, of the degree of master of arts at least, a li censed preacher, and one who should be capable of business, and should apply himself to it, especially for the maintenance and prosperous estate of the Hospital. 2. That the master or his deputy, appointed by him to act in his name, should usually reside within the said Hospital for the better ordering and governing the members thereof. 3. That the master, if he should not be constantly resident in person, should often repair thither to preach and read lectures, and to inquire and hear the complaints of the brethren when they should have any, and see them redressed. 4. That the common seal should be kept by the master in a box locked up, and not trusted with the de puty, and that the master should be always present when the seal should be put to any instrument. 5. That tbe counterparts of the leases should be preserved in the custody of the master himself, and as often as there should be occasion to trust any writing out of his hands, he should take a note for the safe delivery of it. 6. That no demise of lands anciently used to be demised should pass otherwise than by the common seal, and that no demise of lands not demisable by Queen Elizabeth's foundation should be accounted valid in law, though it should be duly sealed with the common seal. 7- That upon sealing of any lease, 12d., and no more, should be given to every member that should attend to sign the lease. 8.

That every master, soon after his induction, should be bound to the bishop of Durham in the penalty of \u00a3400 for the payment of \u00a3200, or stock and stores of that value, to his lawful successor. 11. That an exact inventory should be taken by every master at his coming into his place, ofall the plate, household goods, kitchen and brewing vessels, utensils in tbe dairy and cellar, and for husbandry, linen, bedding and all other furniture, as well belonging to the house of the master as the houses of the brethren, and one copy thereof lodged in tbe bishop's registry with the said bond. 12. That \"the original of these statutes should be safely locked up in the same box with the common seal, to be delivered with the said seal to the next successor, and that a book should be prepared for common use, wherein these statutes, as far as they concern the brethren, should be fairly written with Queen Elizabeth's Act of Foundation, in the 27th year of her reign, and such other rules as should thereafter be made.

That as many brethren should be lodged within the bouse as the ancient lodgings would permit, and had usually for many years past resided therein. 15. That in filling up the vacant places of the in-brethren, a preference should be often given to the out brethren, who in the master's opinion shonld deserve to be taken into the house, yet so as that it should be matter of choice and discretion in the master, and not of obligation to proceed in that way. 16. That these qualifications should be required in every man that should be admitted into Sherburn House as a brother ; that he should be a single person who should have lived well aud creditably in the world, and should not at the time be worth \u00a320 ; that he should be born in the county of Durham, unless by special allowance of the bishop the county should be dispensed with ; and particularly that such as had lived within"], [358, "DURHAM AVARD. 338 Dr. Bell, the master, in the last-mentioned year increased the annual provision ofthe out-brethreil to \u00a34, and gradually raised the annual payments to the in-brethren to \u00a37, 6s. each, which sums were paid until 1819. He also, before that year, erected a new range of buildings behind the apartments of the brethren, for their better accommodation. In 1819, Bishop Barrington ordered a new wing to be erected, containing 15 apartments, for the out-brothers, so that the whole might be accommodated within the building. Those who, from having wives, could not comply with the the manors, and been tenants to the lands of the bishopric or hospital-estate, if in other respects they should be as well qualified, should have the preference; that he should be ofthe age of 56, or upwards, never un der ; that he should not be labouring under any sickness, or incurable or infectious disease, though the lame and impotent should be considered in tbe first place. 17- That he should be a constant member of the Church of England, and continue so. 18. That to this end, every man desiring to be a brother should present a petition to the master, setting forth his case, with a certificate of his age under the band of the minister of the parish where he was born, and another certificate of his peaceable, social disposition, and sober behaviour, and conformity to tbe Church of England for some years past, under the hands of credible gentlemen and others, neighbours to the place where he should have last lived, which petitions and certificates should be filed by the master, to be produced when he should be called upon. 19. That no one should be treated as a brother and member of this corporation, or entitled to any profits as such, who should not have first taken bis oath for performing such ordinances and rules as bad been and should thereafter be made and set down by the bishop of Durham, under his hand and seal, which oath should be taken before the bishop, if he should be at that time in the city of Durham, or else before his spiritual chancellor, or the chancellor's principal surrogate, without fees. 20. That within a month after every vacancy, the master, if he should be in the country, should be bound to put in a new brother, or within six weeks at most, if the master should be far absent; and that upon the master neglecting to fill up the place within that time, it should be in the power of the bishop to name a brother without the master, who should be accordingly admitted. 21. That no woman, child, male relation, or friend, should be suffered to abide in the room or lodging of any brother on any account, except a nurse to take care of the sick. 22. That no brother should presume to be absent from prayers, to go abroad, much less to lie out of the house without leave of the master or his deputy, which should be sparingly allowed, and the time of absence not above two or three days, and the leave to be noted in a book kept for that purpose. 23. That the brethren should attend duly morning and evening prayer, sermons on the Lord's Day, and the Holy .Sacrament as often as it should be administered. 24. That the chaplain of the said Hospital should be constant in reading the morning and evening service, according to the Liturgy of the Church of England, and preach every Lord's Day, and administer the Holy Sacrament four times in the year at least, and should be diligent in visiting the sick. 25. That a Bible and Whole Duty of Man should be provided for every in-brother, which upon the death of any one of them should go with ali the furniture of his chamber (bought by the master) to his successor. 26. That no brother should be a drunkard, guilty of any notorious crime, or live a disorderly offensive life. 27- That in all these cases the master, to whom the power and authority of governing the brethren and the servants of the house is committed, should by himself or his deputy, or the chaplain, correct and punish the offender according to tbe quality and degree of the offence, (that is to say,) at first by a serious admonition, and then by suspending him from his diet for two, three, or more days, but never longer than three weeks at a time, the value of the diet of the suspended person to be divided among the other brethren, not offenders ; aud that if afterwards any brother should go on offending in the same way, the master should then carry his complaint to the bishop, that be may be removed, or otherwise punished as the bishop should think fit. 28. That the brethren who should be well, should eat together at dinner in their common hall, unless for rea sons to be given to the bishop, he should dispense with this rule for any time. 29. That the woman who is to wash their clothes, &c. should be of middle age, of good fame and converation, as the same also was required ofall the other servants and ministers belonging to the house. 30. That the late orders concerning the manner of diet of the brethren throughout the year, with some few alterations as annexed in a separate paper, should be revived and enforced. 31. Lastly, as to the relief of poor travellers at the gate, which had been customary, the bishop gave no in junctions ; idle vagrants, he adds, should be discouraged and punished, necessitous travellers on their honest occasions supplied ; but care should be taken that such as should have no legal settlement be not made bur thensome to the Hospital by au indiscreet relief."], [359, "PITTINGTON. 339 rules of the resident brethren, were to receive \u00a320 a year for life ; but none are in future to be appointed who are not single or widowers.* The following is the yearly rental of the estates belonging to the Hospital in 1829 :\u2014 Rents for the demesne land, &c. let by the master alone, at rack-rent, to yearly tenants \u00a31795 5 <) Rents reserved on leases granted for three lives, or 21 years, by the master and brethren, and renewed from time to time on the payment of fines ... ... ... 89 18 9' Prescript rents payable to the master and brethren ... ... ... 8 19 8* \u00a31894 3 5i The amount of the fines paid to the master for the renewal of leases from 1809 to 1829 was \u00a313,394, 18s. 5d.

It consists of a nave, a chancel, and a west tower. The nave has three round-headed lights on the south ; and the chancel has three pointed lights on each side, adorned with tracery. The east window has been restored with five lights, and contains some painted glass, ancient and modern. The chancel is stalled for the use of the brethren.

After the Restoration, he petitioned the king to be restored, and enjoyed it till his death in December, 1679. f Dr. Gregory's benevolence was diffusive and general. While master of this Hospital, he did not confine the old men as heretofore to the strict allowance, which, good as it might have been when anciently settled on them by their founder, was now become a sad and scanty pittance ; but, as far as it was in his power, made them enjoy the sense and spirit of the benefaction. He demolished all the little wretched huts in which they were huddled together, and erected a handsome commodious stone edifice. For this purpose he cut down and sold a large wood at Ebchester, belonging to the Hospital, as it is said, and adequate to the expense. % Dr. Bell was born at St. Andrew's in 1753, and was educated in the University of that place. In 1789, he was appointed chaplain to Fort St. George, and minister of St. Mary's, at Madras, where he undertook the gratuitous superintendence of the Military Male Orphan Asylum until 179C, during which time he founded the Madras (since called the National) System of elementary Education. No sooner were its advantages known, than it was patronized by the government of Fort St. George ; and on Dr. Bell's arrival in Eng land in 1797, the highest authorities in church and state decided in its favour, and it has since been adopted in every civilized nation in the world. In Great Britain alone, there are at the present time \" 10,000 schools, without any legislative assistance, wherein 600,000 children are educated.\" In 1809, Dr. Bell resigned the valuable rectory of Swanage in Dorsetshire, with the rectorial tithes and pa tronage of the parish of Worth, in favour of the nominee of his patron, the bishop of Durham, by whom he was put in possession of the mastership of Sherburn; and he was also a prebendary of Westminster. He distributed no less a sum than i.120,000 to va rious national institutions and public charities ; and many valuable works on education were written by him. He died at Chelten ham, January 28, 1832, and was buried in Westminster Abbey. AVHITAVELL HOUSE, EXTRA-PAROCHIAL PLACE.

Under Hatfield's Survey, it was held by the master of Sherburn ; and this estate, with its mines and tithes, is still held by lease under Sherburn Hospital, and its inhabitants are provided with sittings in the chapel there. Thomas Bullock occurs as lessee of AVhitwell about 1660, from whom it passed to the Middletons and Teesdales. In 1810, it descended to the Rev.

T does not appear in the writings of any of our ancient topogra- phers, that there was a town where Durham now stands before the monks rested there with the remains of St. Cuthbert, about the year 995, on their return from Ripon, whither they had fled to avoid the attacks of the Danish marauders. On this occasion, the procession halted at Wredelau, generally supposed to be the lofty eminence of Wardonlaw, 5 miles distant from the eastern coast, and commanding a full prospect of the fertile vale of Wear.* At this spot, according to the account of the monkish historians, the ark which contained the body of St. Cuthbert became sud denly immoveable ; and it was only on the third day, after a so lemn fast and supplication, that the saint communicated his pleasure in vision to a monk named Eadmer, commanding that their course should be directed towards Dunholme,f where his church was in future to find a secure establishment.} The sloping sides of the eminence where the city and cathedral of Durham were afterwards erected, were as yet entirely covered with shaggy wood ; the summit alone presented a small ex tent of level and arable surface. Here, on the arrival of the procession, the holy reliques were deposited under a tent or tabernacle of boughs, and afterwards translated to a small edifice distin- * Some, however, have imagined that the name may be rendered Weardale; and others think that Ward ley, in the parish of Jarrow, is the place mentioned (see vol. i. p. 17). t Derived from the Saxon dun, a hill, and holme, a river. Out of this the Latins framed Dunelmum, which (the Normans calling Duresme) was afterwards corrupted into Durham Camden. X Tradition adds that the bishop and his host were still ignorant of the precise spot designed for their fu- ture residence, and that it was accidentally discovered to them by a person meeting a woman in quest of her lost cow, who informed her that she would find it in Dunholme. The astonished monks rejoiced at the pro- pitious sound, and followed their guide, who fortunately led them to a country \" flowing with milk and ho- ney.\" In reference to this circumstance, and emblematic of the rich meads and valleys on the river AVear, the effigies of the women and the bountiful cow, on the west corner tower of the east transept of the cathe- dral, are said to have been erected This legend, however, is not mentioned in the early writers, and rests on the sculpture, which may have given rise to it. \"It does not appear from Simeon's narrative,\" says Surtees, \" that any doubt was entertained as to the designated spot. Of the situation of Dunholme, already perhaps known by that name, and tenanted at least by agricultural occupants, the monks of Chester could scarce be entirely ignorant ; and if we strip off the veil of miraculous fiction in which the ecclesiastical writers involve every fact of church history, we may probably find in the apparent strength and security of the place the real motives of preference.\""], [362, "CITY OF DURHAM. 342 guished by the name of the White Church, where they rested three years, while a cathedral was erecting by Bishop Aldune. The miraculous circumstances which had attended the translation of the church to Durham excited the zeal of all ranks. The gifts and oblations of the wealthy flowed in on all sides ; and those who had only personal labour to offer, eagerly flocked to share in the erection of the sacred edifices. To this conflux the city of Durham owes its origin. After clearing the woods, habitations were allotted to the workmen near the spot selected for the occupation of the religious ; and many would afterwards continue to prefer a residence where they expected the peculiar favour and protection of the powerful patron saint. The larger church or cathedral of Aldune was finished ; and \" into this new Basilica, St. Cuthbert's restless body in the three hundred and ninth veare after his first buriall, was with all funeral pompe enshrin'd.\"* In the 20th year of Bishop Eadmund, Simeon-f* places an irruption of the Scots, who penetrated as far as Durham, where they lost most of their troops; and he adds that the heads of several of their leaders were exposed on poles in the market-place. On the accession of the Conqueror to the throne of England, many of the English who were uneasy under the Norman yoke assembled at Durham, where they erected fortifications for their defence, and made frequent sallies, waiting the arrival of Sevenoe, the Danish king ; but not re ceiving the expected assistance, they betook themselves to flight, and William entered the city, and granted to the inhabitants many privileges. In 1069, William I. sent Robert Cumin, whom he had created Earl of Northumberland, to Durham, with a guard of 700 veteran Normans to enforce his authority. Though repeatedly cau tioned by Bishop Egelwin, Cumin entered the city, displaying on every occasion the most un bounded cruelty, insolence, and oppression, and allowing his troops to indulge in every species of wantonness, riot, and plunder. They forcibly took possession of the houses, and committed various enormities against the inhabitants. Many of the latter, who had determined to fly from the ap proach of Cumin, were, according to Simeon, prevented and driven to the adoption of desperate measures by a heavy fall of snow, which precluded the possibility of escape. They began to form associations against the Normans, upon which Cumin proscribed and murdered several of the * Legend of St. Cuthbert. It is added, \" Now among tbe monkes that attended St. Cuthbert to Dun holme, I find one Rigulfus that had lived 210 yeares ; an history to bee rank't under tbe same common place with the wand'ring Jewe ; a poore monument to be remembred by ; sith he gives noe account to posterity how he spent soe many yeares ; for where meerely long age is the commendation of a man, I may well graunt he had a long beeing, not a long life. \u2014 Another of St. Cuthbert's followers was Eadred a monke, who for six yeares before he dyed was dumbe, and could never speake but in the church, where (as if religion had lent him a tongue when nature denyed) none was more vocal to sing his part.\" Robert Hegg, author of the very curious work just quoted, was, according to AVood, a prodigy of his time for forward and good natural parts. He was born at Durham in 1599; admitted scholar of Corpus Christi College, November 7, 1614; and Probationer Fellow, December 27, 1624, being then M. A., and accounted (considering his age) the best in the University for mathematics, history, and antiquities. The Legend of St. Cuthbert, with the Antiquities of the Church of Durham, was written in 1626, and left in manuscript at his death, being so neatly penned as to be frequently mistaken for print. He died suddenly of apoplexy, June 11, 1629, and was buried in the chapel of his college. Four editions of his Legend have appeared at different times. t Simeon of Durham, an early English historian, was a contemporary of AVilliam of Malmesbury, in the 12th century. He both studied and taught the sciences, and particularly the mathematics, at Oxford. He became precentor of the church of Durham, and died probably soon after the year 1130, at which time his history terminates. He employed himself assiduously in collecting ancient records, especially in the north of England, after they had been scattered by the Danes. From these he composed a history of the Saxon and other kings, from the year 616 to 1130. This work, which was continued by John, prior of Hexham, to 1156, is printed among Twysden's \"Decem Scriptores,\" and separately in 1732, 8vo. \u2014 Cave, vol. ii."], [363, "CITY OF DURHAM. 343 landholders. This acted as a summons to the peasants, who immediately armed themselves and surrounded the\" city. The Normans, overcome with drunkenness and revelling, had sunk into a state of sluggish inaction, and were surprised at the dawn of day at beholding an armed force breaking open the gates of the city. These fell upon their drowsy opponents, and made a dreadful slaughter, insomuch that the streets were filled with blood and carcases. Many were shut up in the house where the earl lodged, and defended it bravely ; but the enraged populace threw in fire brands, set the edifice in flames,* and killed every one that attempted to rush out. The earl was amongst the slain ; and only one man, covered with wounds, effected his escape. The king immediately sent troops to revenge the death of Cumin ; but they proceeded no farther than Northallerton, where, according to Simeon's account, being enveloped in a thick foo, they spent their time in listening to various legends of the fate which had overtaken former violators of the holy patrimony, by which means they frightened each other so effectually, that, as soon as it cleared up, they marched back to York. The spells which St. Cuthbert hurled through the misty air were not, however, sufficiently potent to unnerve the arm of the Norman tyrant. He marched northwards, and ravaged and destroyed the country in so merciless a manner, that for 60 miles be tween York and Durham, he did not leave a house standing, reducing the whole district by fire and sword to a terrible desert, smoking with blood, and in ashes.-f- The news of his approach was no sooner known in Durham, than the bishop convened a chapter of his clergy ; and the result of their deliberations was the removal of the body of St. Cuthbert to Lindisfarne.} Hoveden relates, \" that on the tyrant's approach to Durham, he found the town evacuated, the ecclesiastics fled, and the church left without a minister to perform any sacred office.\" As soon as the troops retired, the inhabitants came from their hiding-places. On the return of the monks from Lindiefarne, they found that the treasures, which in the precipitancy of flight were left at Durham, had been plun dered and profaned ; and the massy crucifix given by Earl Tosti was thrown from the high altar, broken, and robbed of its gold and jewels. \u00a7 The king, on his return from an expedition against Malcolm of Scotland, in the year 1072, ap pointed AAralcher to the bishopric, and ordered a castle or fortress to be built at Durham, for the * \" The fire was so vehement, that the flames were seen to take hold of the western tower of tbe cathedral. This afflicting circumstance alarmed the multitude ; the religious inhabitants of the city, even those in arms, ceasing the slaughter, fell upon their knees, with eyes filled with tears, and elevated hands, petitioning hea ven that by the assistance of the holy saint, and through his interposition, the sacred edifice might be spared from destruction. Quickly the wind shifted, and bore the flames from the church.\" \u2014 Simeon. t Neither monasteries nor churches were spared ; and a dreadful famine and mortality ensued, unequalled in the annals of Britain, the people being reduced to eat the flesh of horses, dogs, and cats, and at last even human carcases. For nine years the land lay unfilled, being infested with robbers and beasts of prey ; and the remnant ofthe inhabitants, who had escaped the sword, died in the fields, overwhelmed with want and misery. X Their first day's journey ended at Jarrow, the second at Bedlington, the third at Tughall, and on the evening of the fourth they reached Lindisfarne. The bishop, with a vast concourse of people, having arrived on the shore opposite the island, found the sea at high water. The severity of the winter rendered the night air intolerable to the aged as well as the tender, which caused great lamentation ; when, by a particular in terposition, the sea retired, and left a dry passage for the poor wanderers, who, with loud thanksgivings and holy joy, passed over to the island. But what completed the miracle was, that as soon as the multitude had passed, the sea returned, and closed up the vacancy which a few moments before had divided the water. \u2014 Simeon. \u00a7 Simeon adds that tbe sacrilege was contrary to the pleasure of the king, who ordered the offenders to be delivered up to the ecclesiastics.

William I., after revenging the death of the bishop, bestowed great gifts on the city of Durham ; and the keep of the castle owes its origin to him. The crucifix of Tosti was restored, enriched afresh with gold and gems, and accompanied by robes and other ornaments of divine worship. The increasing patrimony of the church caused a corresponding increase in the size and population of the city ot Durham. Among the malcontents, on the accession of William Rufus, was William de Carilepho, who had succeeded to the bishopric. After the king had quelled the southern insurrections, he sent an army into the north, which laid siege to Durham, and soon reduced the place. The bishop flying into Normandy, the temporalities ofthe see were seized by the crown, John de Tailbois and Ernesius de Burone were made governors of the castle and palatinate, and it was not till the year 1091 that the bishop was restored. Shortly after his reinstatement, he granted to the convent the manor of Elvet, in thc order of a borough, \" where the monks should have 40 merchants' houses or trades mens' shops, distinct and separate from the bishop's borough of Durham, that they might trade there freed from duties payable to the bishop and his successors.\" This prelate commenced build ing the present cathedral. AArhilst the temporalities were in the hands of the crown, in the time of Bishop Flambard, the borough of Durham sustained considerable damage by fire. After his restoration, he finished the cathedral, and connected it with the castle by a line of communication and defence. The space be tween them was cleared of houses and levelled, and a moat was added to the defence of the fortress. This city entertained the members of congress, in April, 1139, when a treaty of peace was ao-reed upon. The Empress Matilda, and Prince Henry her son, with many barons and Scottish nobles, being present on the occasion. While Cumyn the intruder held the castle of Durham, his soldiers frequently sallied forth, and every where spread terror and devastation. The suburbs of Elvet and Framwellgate, of which the partisans of Bishop De St. Barbara had possession, were fired and reduced to ashes. Some of the prisoners were suspended across ropes, with heavy weights attached to their neck and feet; others were repeatedly plunged in the frozen bed of the river ; of others the naked feet, protruded through an aperture in the wall, were exposed to the severity of the night. The punishment of the boot, or something like it, seems to bave been also inflicted. Imprisonment, chains, and famine, completed the catalogue. The very name of Durham became a source of terror ; and a place formerly conse crated by religious reverence, was feared and detested os a kind of hell upon earth. The borough of Elvet was restored by Bishop Pudsey, who also built Elvet bridge, and com pleted the city wall along the bank of the AA^ear from the North Gate of the Bailey to the AArater * The Conqueror, on this occasion, desired to see the body of St. Cuthbert, vowing, at the same time, that if he had been deceived in the relations he had beard of tbe incorruptibility of the saint's remains, and if the body was not found in the state represented to him, he would put to death all those of superior rank through-. out tbe city who had presumed to impose on him. These menaces terrified all who heard him ; but the king determined to satisfy his curiosity, immediately ordered the officers of the church to open the sepulchre. Whilst lie stood by, however, he found himself smitten on a sudden with a burning fever, which so distracted him that be rushed out of the church, leaving untasted a sumptuous banquet which the ecclesiastics had pre pared for him, and instantly mounted his horse, and fled from the city with such haste that he never abated the speed of his courser till he had crossed the Tees. This supposed preternatural interference is said to bave overawed tbe people, and to have contributed largely to the veneration paid to the saint's shrine. Tra dition mentions, that the king, in his haste, took his way down tbe narrow street called King's Gate, eadinn* to the Bailey, and now called Dun Cow Lane \u2014 Simeon."], [365, "CITY OF DURHAM. 345 Gate on the south, near which some remains are still visible. The king, during the displeasure which Pudsey had excited, repeatedly deprived him of the custody of the place; and on the death of the prelate, Hugh Bardolf seized on the castle for the\" crown. The keys of the city remained meanwhile suspended above the shrine of St. Cuthbert.* King John resided at Durham in 1213, during his progress to the north. King Henry III., on his northern excursion, honoured Durham with a royal visit, and for a short time resided in the city, during the episcopacy of Bishop Farnham. In 1255, he again visited the city. After the death of Bishop De Insula, 1283, the archbishop of York came to Durham to assert his spiritual superiority, but was refused admittance into the cathedral; and attempting, in conse quence, to pronounce sentence of excommunication against the refractory ecclesiastics in the church of St. Nicholas, was attacked by the inhabitants ofthe borough, and, after repeated insults escaped with difficulty by tlie private road leading to Kepyer. Edward I., after the victory of Falkirk, halted at Durham, where he held a council of his nobles and gave away the estates of several of the Scots who had opposed him. He forgave to the prior and convent the sum of =\u00a31012, 9s. 11 [d , their arrears of subsidies. Intelligence having arrived of the Scots being again in arms, he immediately marched back his troops to give them battle ; and on his return he celebrated the festival of Christmas at Tynemouth. In 1300, the kino* was ao*ain at Durham, as a mediator between the bishop and his convent (luring their bitter animosities. In the reign of Edward II., A. D. 1313, a numerous army, headed by Bruce, entered Northum berland; a party of whom, whilst the inhabitants were in their beds, surprised the suburbs of Durham, which they reduced to ashes. In 1316, the Scots made another incursion, and destroyed the seat of the prior at Beaurepaire. In 1323, the walls of the city cf Durham, having been neglected and become ruinous, were re stored and put into a state of defence by Bishop Beaumont, who, this year, received a severe cem sure from Edward II. for his negligence in matters so important to his palatinate. Edward III. lay at Durham previous to the campaign in Stanhope Park, and returned thither after it. Accompanied by his nobles, he visited the cathedral ; and, after allowing his soldiers two days of rest in the city, he marched to York, and disbanded his troops. A circumstance, honour able to the inhabitants of Durham, must not be omitted : when the army marched forward in quest ofthe Scots, they left tlieir baggage and waggons in a wood at midnight; the people of Durham found them there, removed them at their own cost, and placed them in their empty barns. Each wao-o-on was distinguished by a little bannerol attached to it. Froissart adds, that the horses were all well shod at Durham. On April 1, 1333, King Edward III. arrived at Durham on his march northward, previous to the battle of Hallidown-hill. At a feast given here on the installation of Bishop Bury, in Decem ber the same year, the king and queen of England, Baliol king of Scotland, two archbishops, seven bishops, five carls, and all the northern nobility, were entertained with magnificent hospitality. On October 17, 131*6, was fought the celebrated battle of the Red Hills, commonly called the battle of Neville's Cross. David, king of Scotland, assembled one of the most powerful armies which had ever crossed the Border; and whilst King Edward was prosecuting his victorious career in France, he invaded England by the western marches. The first efforts of the storm fell upon the little tower of Liddell. AValter Selby, the governer, surrendered at discretion, after a brave defence ; * Ralph de Grimesbi, one of Bardolf's soldiers, attempting, though with reverence, to take them from thence, was miraculously obliged to desist by the iron becoming hot whilst in his hands. He hastily returned the keys to the holy sepulchre, but was afterwards punished with madness and death.\u2014 Gals Coldingh. c. 10,"], [366, "CITY OF DURHAM. 346 but David, with strange inhumanity, ordered him to be beheaded on the spot. After burning the abbey of Lanei-cost, the Scots pursued their usual route through Cumberland and Tynedale. They sacked the priory of Hexham, but spared the town, reserving it as a depot for their future plunder. The same orders were issued as to Darlington, Durham, and Corbridge. After crossing the Tyne and Derwent. David halted at Ebchester, and the next day encamped, without meeting with serious opposition, at Beaurepaire. The northern nobles, meanwhile, exerted the remaining resources of the country with vigour and dispatch; and an army of 16,000 men was quickly assembled, under the archbishop of York, the bishops of Durham, Lincoln, and Carlisle, the Lords Neville and Percy, and the sheriff's of Yorkshire and Northumberland. David, heedless of the approaching dano-er, continued at Beaurepaire, indulging in the pageantry of war, and wasting the country round Durham. On the 16th, the English forces lay in Auckland Park : the next day they moved forward, and, after gaining the rising grounds, halted at Merrington, from whence the motions of the Scots on the western hills might be plainly distinguished. The English leaders hesitated whe ther to advance or to observe the enemy, and expect his attack in so favourable a position ; the marshals and standard-bearers moving a little forward, the troops insensibly followed them, and thus they proceeded slowly to Ferryhill. Here a strong foraging party of the Scots, under Dou glas, fell unexpectedly into the midst of the English troops, and were pursued, with the loss of 500 men, as far as Sunderland Bridge. The English halted again on the high grounds above the Wear ; but the standard-bearers went forward, and the army moved slowly on in order of battle, leaving Durham on the right, to the Red Hills. Douglas, who had escaped from his pursuers, meanwhile reached the Scottish camp, and gave the first information of the approach of the Eng lish force. David had employed the preceding day in drawing out bis troops (as if in defiance of opposition) on Durham moor, in order of battle, with standards flying, and had passed the night in Beaurepaire park and wood, without the precaution of a scout or a sentinel on the watch. The prudent advice of Douglas to retreat to the hills and avoid an engagement, was rejected with dis dain ; and the Scots advancing to meet the attack, the armies joined battle on the Red Hills, a piece of broken and irregular ground rising swiftly from the Wear. The Scots were formed in three divisions, under the king, the Earl of Murray with Sir William Douglas, and the high steward of Scotland. The English distributed their force in four bodies : Lord Percy led the first, Lord Neville the second, Sir Thomas Rokeby, sheriff of Yorkshire, commanded the third, and a strong body of cavalry under Edward Baliol formed the reserve. On a little hillock in the depth of Shaw-wood, called the Maidens' Bower, the prior with his attendants knelt around the holy cor porax cloth of St. Cuthbert, which was elevated on the point of a spear within sight of both armies.* The city of Durham lay in dreadful suspense, a prize to the conqueror; and whilst the remaining * Davies says that in the night before the battle, \"there appeared to John Fossor, then prior ofthe abbey of Durham, a vision, commanding him to take the holy corporax cloth, wdiich was within the corporax, where with St. Cuthbert covered tbe chalice when he used to say mass, and to put the same holy relique upon a spear point, and next morning to repair to a place on tbe west of the city of Durham, called the Red Hills, and there to remain till the end of the battle. AVhich vision the prior taking for a revelation of God's grace and mercy, through the mediation of holy St. Cuthbert, went early next morning, with the monks of the said abbey, to the said Red Hills, and there most devoutly prostrated themselves in prayer for victory in the said battle (a great number of the Scots pressing by them, with intention to have spoiled them, yet had no power to commit any violence upon such holy persons so occupied in prayer, being protected by the good pro vidence of Almighty God, by the mediation of holy St. Cuthbert, and the presence of the said holy relique).\" Prior Fossor soon after inclosed the corporax cloth in a splendid banner of red velvet, which was dedicated to St. Cuthbert, and carried before the troops of the bishopric. Shortly before the Reformation, the people of Durham assaulted a procession of the monks, and injured this venerable standard. After the dissolution, it fell into the hands ofthe wife of Dean AVhittingham, who \"did most dispitefully burn the same in her fire.\""], [367, "CITY OF DURHAM. 347 brethren of the convent poured forth their hymns and prayers from the highest towers of the ca- thedral,* their eyes wandered with anxious doubt over the field of approaching combat. The Scots were severely galled as they advanced by the English archers ; and John Graham, impatient at seeing his men fall without the means of resistance, requested of the king an hundred lancers to break the archers : his request was denied, and the troops were ordered to keep the line of battle. Actuated at once by courage and indignation, Graham threw himself singly or with few attendants amongst the archers, dispersed them on every side, and fought till his horse was struck by a broad arrow, and himself, wounded and bleeding, was scarcely able to regain the ranks of his countrymen with life. The high steward immediately led his division to the charge with broad swords and battle-axes ; the archers were driven back through Lord Percy's division, which they disordered in their retreat ; and the Scots, pursuing their advantage, threw the whole of the body into confusion. Alctory hovered on the side of the invaders ; but the day was restored by the courao*e and election of Edward Baliol. AVith a powerful body of cavalry, he made an impetuous charge on the hi\u00bbh steward's divisions, and drove them from the field. King David was meanwhile eno-ao-ed with equal fortunes against Lord Neville ; and Baliol, suffering the high steward to retreat unmolested, threw himself on the flank of the royal troops, which were left uncovered by that commander's flight. The disorder of the Scots became irretrievable; and their third body, under the Earl of Murray, were cut to pieces amongst the inclosures which prevented their escape. After all was lost, a gallant band of nobles formed themselves around their king, and fought with the courao-e of despair, till only eighty of their number survived. David, after receiving two arrow wounds, and resisting several attempts to take him captive, was compelled to surrender to John Copelantl, a Northumbrian esquire, two of whose teeth he dashed out with his clenched steel gauntlet. -f Be- sides the king, the Earls of Fife and Monteith, and Sir AA'illiam Douglas, were made prisoners ; the Earls of Murray and Strathmore, John and Alan Steward, and a long list of Scottish nobility, were amongst the slain. Of the English leaders, Lord Hastings alone fell. Out of an army of 30,000 Scots and French auxiliaries, 15,000 were left dead upon the field ; whilst the loss of the English was very trifling, j After the battle, the prior and monks, accompanied by Ralph Lord * In commemoration of tbe event, the organist, singing-men, and singing-boys of the cathedral, went annually to the summit of the middle tower, and sung the Te Deum to an audience in the church-yard be low. This was continued (except during the Commonwealth) until the year 1811, when it ceased, but was resumed on the 29th of May, 1828. \u2022f On Queen Philippa demanding the king of Scotland from John Copeland, he replied that he would not deliver his prisoner to any man or woman except his own lord. At this time, Edward III. was at Calais, and on hearing of the conduct of Copeland, be ordered him to repair thither, which summons he immediately obeyed, having previously secured his captive in a castle in Northumberland. The king, on seeing him, thanked him for his bravery, made him a knight banneret, and settled on him \u00a3100 a year in lands, and then told him to return home, and deliver his prisoner to the queen. David Bruce was imprisoned eleven years in the Tower, when he was ransomed by Robert Stuart, his nephew, for the sum of 56,000 marks sterling. X Fordun, quoted bv Surtees. \u2014 The night before tbe battle, according to Davies, King David was in a dream admonished that in no wise he should attempt to violate the church goods of St. Cuthbert, or any thing pertaining to that holy saint. In the battle, a cross brought from Holyrood House was taken by the English : \" which cross is recorded, by most ancient and credible writers, to have come to the said king (David) most miraculously : being hunting the wild hart in a forest near Edinburgh, upon Holy Rood day, commonly called the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, the king separated from his nobles, &c. suddenly there appeared unto him, as it seemed, a most beautiful hart, running towards him with full speed, which so affrighted his horse, that he violently ran away ; but the hart so fiercely and swiftly followed, that he forcibly threw the king and his horse to the ground; who being much dismayed, cast back bis hands betwixt tbe tines ofthe hart's horns to stay himself, when the said cross slipped into his hands most wonderfully ; at the sight of vol. 11. 4 U"], [368, "CITY OF DURHAM. 348 Neville, John his son, Lord Percy, and many other nobles, proceeded to the cathedral, and joined in a solemn thanksgiving to God and holy St. Cuthbert for the conquest obtained that day. On that spot of ground whereon was exhibited during thc battle the holy corporax cloth, was after wards erected, to commemorate the victory, an elegant cross of stone work, built at the expense of Ralph Lord Neville, and which was called Neville's Cross* On December 23, 1356, King Edward III. again visited this city, and issued his summons for his military tenants to attend him on a northern expedition, in which Berwick was besieged and reduced. On March 24, 1399, there was a general array, on Gilesgate Moor, of the men able to bear arms within the county of Durham. In 1404. two peers and two knights were executed at Durham, for being concerned in a conspiracy against Henry 1Y. In the autumn of 1416, the plague raged at Durham ; and Bishop Langley, by proclamation, dated September 3, adjourned the sessions from Thursday before the feast of St. Matthew, till Monday after the Circumcision (January). This visitation continued for five yeais, during which time many thousands of people died in this city and neighbourhood. In 1424, Durham was crowded with nobility on the liberation and marriage of the Scottish king (James I.) with the Lady Jane, daughter of the Earl of Somerset. Tbe hostages were received which tlie hart immediately vanished away, and was never after seen, no man knowing certainly what metal or wood the said cross was made of. In the place where this miracle was so wrought, now springs a fountain, called the Rood Well. The night after the cross so bechanced to him, he was warned in his sleep, by a vi sion, to build an abbey in the same place.\" The king, coming on this expedition, brought the cross with him as a miraculous and most fortunate relique. It was, with many other jewels and monuments, and other no blemen's banners taken in the battle, offered to the shrine of St. Cuthbert. It was called the Black Rood of Scotland, being, as it were, smoked all over. \u2014 Davies' Riles and Monuments. * This cross \"had seven steps about it, every way squared, to the socket wherein the stalk of tbe cross stood ; which socket was fastened to a large square stone, the sole or bottom stone, being of a great thickness, viz. a yard and half every way : this stone was the eighth step. Also the said socket was fastened with iron and lead to the sole stone, on every side of the corner of the socket stone, which was three quarters deep, and a yard and a quarter square about, every way. The erected stalk of the cross, was in length three yards and a half up to the boss, having eight sides, all of one piece: from the socket it was fixed into the boss above, into which boss the stalk was deeply soddered with lead and sodder. In the midst of the stalk, in every second square, was the Nevil's cross. A saltire, in a 'scutcheon, being Lord Nevil's arms, was finely cut out upon the said stalk ; and the bottom of the stalk was soddered deep in the bole of tbe socket, with lead and sodder ; ancl at every corner of the socket was a picture of one of the four evangelists, finely set forth, and carved in stone mason work. The boss at the top ofthe stalk was an octangular stone, finely cut and bordered, and most curiously wrought ; and in every square of the nether side thereof, in the mason work, was Nevil's cross, in a 'scutcheon, in one square, and the bull's head, having no 'scutcheon, in the next square ; so in the same reciprocal order about the boss. On the top of the boss was a stalk of stone (being a cross a little higher than the rest) soddered deeply with lead and sodder into the bole of the boss above, whereon was cut out, on both sides ofthe stalk ofthe said cross, the picture of our Saviour Christ crucified, with his arms stretched out, his hands nailed to the cross, and his feet nailed upon the stalk of tbe cross be low, almost a quarter ofa yard above the boss, the picture of the blessed Virgin Mary on one side, and the picture of St. John the Evangelist on the other side, most pitifully lamenting, and beholding his torments and cruel death, they both standing on the top of the boss : all which pictures were most artificially wrought together, and finely carved out of one entire stone, some parts thereof through-carved work, both on the east and west sides of the cross, with a cover of stone likewise over their heads, being all most finely and curiously wrought together out of the said hollow stone ; which cover of stone was covered over finely with lead.\" In 1589, in the night-time, \"the same was broken down and defaced, by some lewd, contemptuous, and wicked persons.\" All that remains of this cross is an octagonal stone. The pillar affixed in it is no part of the original structure, but appears to have been placed there in more modern times for the purpose of a mile-stone. In Hutchinson's History is an imaginary drawing of the original cross, in which, by an unac countable mistake, the octagonal stone above mentioned has been omitted by the designer. The prior and monks likewise erected a cross of wood on the scite of the Maiden's Bower Davies."], [369, "CITY OF DURHAM. 349 here, a truce for seven years was agreed upon between the two kingdoms, and certain laws were established for the government of the Borders. The king and queen of Scotland remained in the city a considerable time, and left it about the end of March. The delegates of England and Scotland met several times at Durham, in the episcopacy of Bishop Neville, for the purpose of adjusting the affairs of the two kingdoms. In 1448, Henry ATI. came to this city, on a pilgrimage to the shrine of St. Cuthbert.* In 1463, Lord Montague was here with his army, previous to the battle of Hedgeley Moor. Bishop Fox, on July 23 (the anniversary of his installation), 1503, entertained, among other distinguished personages, in the great hall of his palace, the Princess Margaret, daughter of Henry VTIL, in her progress into Scotland, where she was afterwards married to King James IA'.f * The following letter from the king to M.

In 1589, the plague, which was then ravaging the northern counties, broke out at Durham ; and it appears that it was not totally subdued till 1597- The poor inhabitants of this city were lodged in huts in the fields; and traces of the arrangement of these miserable abodes might be seen on Elvet-moor before the late inclosures. Bishop Matthew retired to his castle at Stockton to avoid the infection. October 27, 1597. there were dead in Elvet more than 400 persons, in St. Nicho las' parish 100, in St. Margaret's 200, in St. Giles's 60, in St. Mary's in the North Bailey 60. Twenty-four prisoners died in gaol. 210 deaths are recorded in the parish of St. Nicholas between the 11th of July and 27th of November. Many of these persons were buried on the moor, or at St. Thomas's chapel, beyond Claypath. The plague broke out again in September tbe following year.* In 1604, it appeared in St. Giles's parish. Similar visitations occur in 1644 and 1645. On April 13, 1603, King James I. rested at Durham on his first entrance into England. He was received by the magistrates, and afterwards entertained at the castle by the bishop, when he was pleased to grant his warrant to liberate all the prisoners in the gaol. During the progress of that monarch into Scotland in 1617. one of his majesty's footmen, named Master Heaburne, arrived in the city of Durham on Good Friday, April 18, and signified to George Walton, Esq., mayor, that it was his majesty's pleasure to enter that place in state on the 19th, Easter-eve. The king came in by Elvet ; and the mayor, mounted on horseback, received him on Elvet bridge. Master Heaburne took his station near the mayor and aldermen until the king's arrival, when a loyal speech was delivered by the mayor, who surrendered to his majesty the staff' and mace, and also presented, in the name of the city, a silver bowl, gilt, with a cover. After this, the mayor was directed by Master Heaburne to remount his horse and ride before his majesty, when having pro ceeded a few yards, a stop was made, whilst an apprentice recited some verses to his majesty. The mayor was then placed next the sword, and, bearing the city mace, rode before the king to the ca thedral. On Easter Monday the king rode to see a horse-race on AVoodham moor, and returned to Durham ; and on the Tuesday, being St. George's day, he continued his progress to Newcastle. In 1615, the king sent letters into the bishopric for the array of all men able to bear arms, be twixt the ages of 16 and 60 : the whole number which appeared on Gilesgate Moor was 8320. On June 1, 1633, King Charles I. arrived at Durham on his progress to Scotland. He was met by Sir AArilliam Belasyse, high sheriff', and the gentlemen of the county. As soon as his majesty alighted, he went first to the abbey church, a canopy of state being borne over him by eight pre bendaries. After service and a speech from Dean Hunt, he went to the castle; and the next day (Sunday) morning, he heard a sermon from the bishop at the abbey, where none were admitted * The plague was probably in part occasioned by continued inclemency of the seasons, and the immense quantity of wet which fell during several years. \" Remember that the spring was very unkind by means of the abundance of rains ; our July hath been like to a February, our June even as an April ; so that the air must needs be corrupted.

After service he dined at the deanery, at the bishop's charge. Then he attended evening prayer, and after wenl to the castle, where he kept his court all the time he was at Durham, and did touch divers persons for the king's evil. His majesty was attended by the Duke of Lenox, the Earls of Newcastle, Suffolk, Cumberland, Pembroke,* Northumberland, Salisbury, Cleveland, Southampton, Northampton, and Holland, Lord Treasurer Weston, Lord Wharton, Lord Grey of Chiliingham, Dr. Laud, bishop of London, Dr. AVhite, bishop of Ely, the Scots Marquis of Hamilton, and Lord Bothwell. Whilst the king and his retinue were at Dur- ham, they were entertained by the bishop at the expense of .C1500 a day. In April, 1639, King Charles was again at Durham, on his march against the Scotch Covenanters; when Bishop Mor ton, with great expressions of joy and welcome, entertained his majesty during his stay. The kino remained at Durham while the horse and foot, intended to be levied there, were raised and upon their march. In 1640, the Scottish army entered the county after the battle of Newburn, on which occasion Rushworth says, \"As for the city of Durham, it became a most depopulated place: not one shop for four days after the fight, open ; not one house in ten that had either, man, woman, or child, in it ; not one bit of bread to be got for money, for the king's army had eat and drank all in their march into Yorkshire ; the country people durst not come to market, which made that city in a sad condition for want of food.\" In 1649, Durham Castle was sold by the parliament to Thomas Andrews, Lord Mayor of London, for \u00a31267, Os. lOd. ; and in 1651, Durham Borough and Fram- wellgate were sold to the corporation of Durham for _P200. On July 14, 1650, Oliver Cromwell arrived at Durham, where he was met by Sir Arthur Haselrigg, governor of Newcastle, with Colo nel Pride and other officers, who attended him to that town on the day following. After the battle of Dunbar, a great number of Scottish prisoners arrived at Durham. They were confined in the cathedral, where they defaced many fine tombs, &c.-f- In 1660, the Restoration of King Charles II. was celebrated at Durham with great demonstrations of joy. On April 26 and 27, 1682, there was a great flood in the river AVear at Durham. On August 3, in the following year, there was such an inundation of the river, that the judges of assize (Jones and Strut) entered the city by Gilesgate. On St. George's day, April 23, 1699, there fell hail in and about Durham five inches in diameter. Floods occurred in 1722 and 1725. \\ * During King Charles's abode at the castle, Dickey Pearson, the bishop's fool, and the last individual it is presumed who was entertained in that capacity, seeing the Earl of Pembroke richly and fantastically dressed, accosted him very brotherly, \"I am the bishop of Durham's fool, whose fool are you?\" + Sir Arthur Haselrigg, in a letter to the council of state, dated Newcastle, October 31, 1650, says, \" AVhen they came to Morpeth, the prisoners being put into a large walled garden, they eat up raw cabbages, leaves and roots, so many, as the very seed and labour at 4d. a day, was valued at \u00a39, which cabbage (they having fasted, as they themselves said, near eight days) poisoned their bodies ; for, as they were coming from thence to Newcastle, some died by the way-side. AVhen they came to Newcastle, I put them into the greatest church in the town ; and tbe next morning, when I sent them to Durham, about 140 were sick, and not able to march. Three died that night, and some fell down on their march from Newcastle to Durham, and died. On being told into the great cathedral church, they were counted to be no more than 3000, although Colonel Fenwick wrote me that there were 3500.\" X The Parish Register of St. Oswald's, in recording the burial of John Slater, one of the bailiffs, from St. Nicholas, July 8, 1 722, says, \" Ye River was risen so high y' they could not bring the corps up New Elvet, but were obliged to carry it up Old Elvet & ye Ratten Row.

On June 14, 1740, the people assembled in great numbers at Durham, and offered 8s. per boll for wheat, which being refused by the farmers, they seized the corn, on which blows ensued, and several on both sides were wounded. During the alarm occasioned by the rebellion in 1745, meetings of the clergy and gentry of the county were held in Durham Castle, and an association was formed for providing armed men and horses for the public service, every member subscribing one month's pay for each man and horse he sent, at the rate of 3s. 6tl. a day. Subscriptions of money and arms were also received ; and all Papists, reputed Papists, and Nonjurors, were ordered to send to Durham Castle all their horses, mares, and geldings, exceeding thc value of \u00a35 each, on pain of being proceeded against according to law. They were likewise ordered to remain within five miles of their own habitations. The volunteers raised by the above means mustered on Framwellgate Moor, but were discharged in December, on the horse-militia ofthe county being raised.* In the evening of January 27, 17\"46, his Royal Highness the Duke of Cumberland arrived in Durham on his way to Scotland. He was met by- the mayor, recorder, and aldermen, with the town's music and banners, at the head of Elvet, where he was welcomed to the city in a short speech by the recorder : they then, amidst the acclamations of the people, marched in procession before his royal highness through the city, which was illuminated. -f- In 17-59, an act of parliament was passed for rendering the river AA7ear navigable up to Durham ; but the commissioners never qualified to put it in force. A plan had been proposed in 1720; and in 1796, Mr. Robert Dodd, and afterwards Mr. Whitworth, surveyed the river, with a view of joining the Tyne and Wear, by a cut through the vale of Team, to the Wear near Picktree, and thence to the city of Durham. After several weeks of severe frost, there was, in January, 1763, a clear passage on the ice in the river AVear from Chester-le-Street to Durham. In 1769, Crossgate Moor (200 acres) was divided ; the dean and chapter reserving 6d. an acre and the mines. In 1772. Elvet Moor (400 acres) was divided under the same reserved rent. In 1801, Framwellgate and Brasside Moors and Witton-Gilbert Common (2400 acres) were divided. The late bishop (Barrington) had one-sixteenth of the soil allotted, and all the mines. This vene rable prelate appropriated one-third of his whole allotment to the founding of schools within the county of Durham. In 1817, Gilesgate Moor (270 acres) was divided. The Marquis and Mar chioness of Londonderry had one-sixteenth allotted as lord and lady of the manor, and reserved the mines. On April 18, 1770, the bells of Durham were rung on account of Mr. AA^ilkes's enlargement. In the evening an effigy was carried round the town on an ass, and afterwards burnt in a large fire in the Market-place, where 45 gallons of beer were given to the populace.

During the great flood of 1771, the Wear at Durham was 8 feet 10 inches higher than ever known before. Two houses at the end of Framwellgate bridge, with all the furniture, were entirely swept away. One of the Abbey mills and the bridge belonging to the dean and chapter were carried away, as were four arches of Elvet bridge ; and all the lower buildings of the city, garden walls, &c. were either destroyed or left in a ruinous condition. Mrs. Morgan's house and Mr. Wilkinson's coach house, both in Elvet, were driven down by the water; but the houses behind prevented them from being carried off. Many other houses were greatly damaged ; and several horses, cows, &c. were drowned in the stables and byers. There was, however, no loss of human life, though a youno woman fell into the water, by the bank giving way, and was carried 700 yards down the river, when she was saved by the assistance of her fellow servant. On May 11, 1794, a violent storm of hail, attended by thunder and lightning, happened at Dur ham. The electric fluid entered the upper part of the house of Lowther Rutter, Esq., forced its way through several of the apartments, and did considerable damage. It afterwards penetrated the house o? Mrs. Smith adjoining, melted and broke all the bell-wires, tore the wainscot and paper in several of the rooms, and set fire to two gowns that were hanging on the back of a chair, which Mrs. Smith, with wonderful presence of mind, extinguished with the carpet. No person was in jured in either of the families. In 1798, an Armed Association was formed in the city of Durham. About 500 of the inhabit ants enrolled themselves, from whom a very efficient corps of 300 men was selected, Ralph John Fenwick, Esq., lieutenant-colonel commandant. The colours were presented bv Lady Milbanke on October 10. A corps of cavalry was soon after raised, under the command of Henry Methold, Esq. Both corps remained embodied till May, 1802. On November 6, 1803, the Durham Armed Association was again called out, on the recommencement of the war. Colonel Fenwick resigned the command, in consequence of ill health, in 1806, when a handsome piece of plate was presented to him by the corps. Edward Shipperdson, Esq., succeeded to the command ; and the corps re mained embodied till March 24, 1813, when they had their last parade, and extended their services to the local militia. A piece of plate was presented to Colonel Shipperdson by the officers and privates, April 19, 1813. On Sunday, January 7, 1804, about two o'clock in the morning, the cotton manufactory belong ing to Messrs. Salvin, near St. Oswald's church, was discovered to be on fire in the upper stories ; and notwithstanding the presence of the fire-engines, and the exertions of the volunteers and other inhabitants, the whole was reduced to a heap of ruins in the course of a few hours. At the jubilee, October 25, 1809, on the entrance of King George III. into the 50th year of his reio-n. the inhabitants of Durham evinced their loyalty by various acts of munificence. Besides a large sum appropriated by the dean and chapter for the liberation of prisoners confined for small debts, a general collection, amounting to =\u00a3'120, was made and distributed to more than 1000 poor families. Thomas AVilkinson, of Oswald House. Esq., presented to a great number of poor old persons 2s. 6d. each. Upwards of 500 charity children were also enabled to participate in the ge neral festivity. On June 15, 1812, the freemen of Durham, in consequence of several encroachments, perambu lated the boundaries of the city, a custom which had been neglected since the inclosure of the adjacent moors."], [374, "354 CITY OF DURHAM. On April 13, 1814, the city of Durham was elegantly illuminated on account of the news of the surrender of Paris to the Allies. Amongst the rejoicings at Durham on account ofthe coronation of King George IAr., July 19, 1821, a small ox, the gift of Lord Stewart, now Marquis of Londonderry, was roasted at the head of Old Elvet. It was soon cut in pieces, which, together with a quantity of bread, were thrown indiscriminately amongst the people, who immediately commenced pelting with it those on the plat form, so that his lordship's generosity on this occasion was literally thrown away. Several barrels of ale were also given away, which added considerably to the tumult and confusion. On August 30, 1822, his Royal Highness the Duke of Sussex visited the city of Durham, where a Masonic Provincial Grand Lodge was held to receive him. A splendid procession took place, during which his royal highness was loudly cheered. He afterwards dined with the Masons in their hall. A snow-storm, accompanied by a dense fog, commenced January 11, 1823, which extended over the whole county, and continued for about six weeks. The AVear was frozen ; and the roads were so blocked up, that for some days the mail-bags were forwarded from Rushyford to Durham on horseback. During the stay of his grace the Duke of Wellington in the northern counties, in October, 1827, he visited the bishop at Durham Castle, where, with the nobility and gentry of the county, be was entertained with a splendid banquet. The ceremony of proclaiming his majesty King AArilliam TY. took place at Durham, July 5, 1830, with the usual solemnities. On October 31, 1831, a meeting of the freeholders and other inhabitants of the county of Dur ham was held in the area in front of the court-house, to deliberate on the rejection of Earl Grey's bill for amending the parliamentary representation of Great Britain. The number present was between 8000 and 10,000. On May 15, 1833, a violent storm of thunder, lightning, and hail, wdiich extended over the greater part of the county, fell with peculiar violence upon the city of Durham. The hailstones were exceedingly large, and broke several of the windows of the cathedral, as well as those of many private houses. The flashes of lightning were almost incessant, and 21 were counted in one minute.* General A'iew of the City. The city of Durham is situated nearly in the centre of the county, in 54\u00b0 5' north latitude, and 1\u00b0 27 west longitude from London. It is 15 miles south of Newcastle, 48 south of Alnwick, 67 east-south-east of Carlisle, 50 east-north-east of Appleby, 87 north-east of Lancaster, 67 north north-west of York, 256 north-north-west ofthe metropolis of England, and 132 south-south-east from that of Scotland. It contains five parishes, two extra-parochial places, one township, one parochial chapelry, and a barony and borough, of which the following forms the enumeration, with the returns of the number of inhabitants in 1801, 1811, 1821, and 1831,-f and the estimated annual value according to the assessment for the county-rate in 1828-9. * Hutchinson's Durham, Surtees's Durham, Brand's Newcastle, Sykes's Local Records, Parochial Regis ters, Public Papers, &c. t The Castle Precincts, in 1831, and probably also in 1801 and 1811, was included with St. Mary-le-Bow parish. The parish of St. Oswald (including the townships of Shincliffe and Broome) is stated in the returns for 1831 to contain 6288 inhabitants; but it will be perceived that the enumeration annexed is 810 short of that sum, which number is also wanting to complete 10,125, the specified population of the city.

The borough of Framwellgate is also incorporated with the city. The appearance of Durham and its environs, from whatever point they are surveyed, is at once unique and striking; the public edifices exhibiting an extraordinary degree of magnificence and grandeur.* Hanging woods and gardens mingle with the buildings, and clothe the steep banks of the winding river, which forms a singular curve in the shape of a horse-shoe, and incloses a loftv peninsula or promontory, whereon are situated the Cathedral, the Castle, the Palace Green, the College, the streets called the South and North Bailey, and Sadler Street, anciently called Flesh ewer Raw, from its occupation by butchers. At the north end of this street, and on the isthmus the error may have arisen from the Borough and Barony of Elvet being united in the return.

Several rows of new houses have been erected on what was formerly Gilesgate Moor. * This great actor was the son of Roger Kemble, a country manager, and was born at Kingstown, Here fordshire, on May 3, 1 758, on the very night on which his mother had played Anne Bullen, in the play of Henry the Eighth. Having received a proper education, he was placed with stir. Gibbs, an eminent sur geon at Coventry ; but, after serving two years, be commenced actor, and ran through the usual vicissitudes of a provincialist's tour. In 1782, his sister, stirs. Siddons, electrified the Drury Lane audience ; and the managers of Covent Garden, on the report that her brother possessed great talents, sent a liberal offer to Stephen, who was then performing at Edinburgh, and who made his first essay at Covent Garden theatre in 1783 as Othello. In the mean while, Sheridan had engaged John Kemble, the real hero of the above report, at the rival theatre ; and Stephen, eclipsed by the splendid talents of his relatives, became, in the green-room term, a shelf-fish. At the expiration of his engagement, he starred at the provincial theatres, until he be came manager at Newcastle and Edinburgh. His company also performed at Durham, Sunderland, North and South .Shields, Berwick, and Glasgow; and Terry, Liston, H. Siddons, Egerton, Faulkner, Lee, and Miss Smith (now stirs. Bartley), at different times belonged to it. In 1805, he retired into private life; but in 1817 he was induced to become manager of Drury Lane theatre, and played Falstaff, which was advertised \"to be performed without stuffing.\" Both his own efforts, however, and those of his company, were so far beneath the public expectation, that, at the latter end of the season, many people could scarcely be prevailed upon to visit the theatre, even with orders, stir. Kemble subsequently retired from the stage, and died at Durham, June 6, 1822. His remains were interred in the chapel of tbe Nine Altars, in the cathedral. stir. Kemble was (not in bis last, essay) a sterling, if not a sbewy actor, and an excellent reader, stir. Sheridan considered him to be the best declaimer be had ever heard on or off the stage. He principally ex celled in the old men, both of tragedy and comedy. He is said to have been fond of personating Hamlet, even when be weighed 18 stone; on which a ludicrous caricature likeness was published, with the line, \u2014 \" Oh ! that this too, too solid flesh would melt !\" inscribed beneath it. He was possessed of considerable literary talents, having written various addresses, songs, &c, which appeared from time to time in different journals: he also published \"Odes, Lyrical Ballads, and Poems,\" 8vo. 1809, with a portrait; and produced two dramatic pieces, called \"The New Inn,\" and \" Flodden Field.\" Indeed, be was a man of general in formation, and a learned and entertaining companion. In person, he was about 5 feet 9 inches in height ; his countenance strongly resembled that of his incomparable sister, and bis figure in his youth (on dit) that of his brother John. Latterly, be was immensely fat ; a circumstance which has given rise to numerous anecdotes, proving that, like Falstaff, \" he was not only witty himself, but the occasion of wit in others.\" Mrs. Kemble (formerly Miss Satchell) was an excellent actress, and a great favourite with the audiences of Durham, &c. She was considered the best Yarico of her day ; and her performance of that character elicited from the poet Burns a well-known complimentary stanza. \u2014 Dram. Biog. t Anciently Clayport. The neck of land here is not above 200 paces in width ; and there are sufficient appearances on the adjacent ground to support the conjecture that a sluice or moat once crossed it, whereby the whole city could be completely insulated. Leland, in the first volume of his Itinerary, says, \" The towne of Duresme stondeth on a rocky Iiille ; and stondeth as men cum from tbe south cuntre on the ripe of Were, the which water so with bis course naturall in a botom windeth about, that from Elvet a greats stone bridge of 14 arches, it crepith about tbe towne to Framagate-bridge, of three arches, also on AVere, that betwixt these two bridges, or a little lower, at St. Nicholas, the towne, except the length of an arrowshot, is brought in insulam; and some hold opinion, that of auncient tyme. Were ran from the place wher now Elvet bridge is, strait down by St. Nicholas, now stonding on a hille ; and, that the other course, part for pollicy, and part for digging of stones for building of the town and minstre, was made a valley, and so the water course was conveyed that way, \u2014 but I approve not full of this conjecture.\" In 1791, the old gateway called Clay path-gate, a weak single arch of stone and rubble which stood near the east end of St. Nicholas' church, with some adjoining shops and houses, were removed. There was a foot-passage on the east side."], [379, "CITY OF DURHAM. 357 A flight of steps leads from the north-west corner of the Market-place by the New Place to the factory-house. These are said to be the stairs by which the archbishop of York escaped from the fury of the mob in 1283 (see page 345). To the east of Sadler Street is Elvet Bridge, from which Old Elvet* proceeds in nearly a straight line to the south-east, and contains many respectable houses. New Elvet turns south from the end of the bridge, and ascends rather steeply till it divides into Church Street, leadino- to the oreat south road, and Hallgarth Street,-^ turning to the south-east, and joining the Stockton road. At the end of this street is a lofty conical eminence, called Monfjoye. The city is paved, lighted, and watched, under the direction of commissioners appointed for that purpose by an act of parliament passed in the 30th year of the reign of Georo-e III., and consider ably amended in the 3d year of George IV. To defray these expenses, toll-bars are erected at the different avenues leading to the city, where toll is collected, which, in addition to a triflin\"* assess ment made upon the householders, is sufficient for all the purposes of regulating and improvinr* the city. Under the authority of this act, many obstructions have been removed, and the streets rendered commodious ; so that the city, for public convenience, neatness, and cleanliness, is not now surpassed by any other in the kingdom. Two police-officers receive a salary of _C50 a year each; and there are two assistants, who are paid for their services when on duty. A constable is appointed annually, in every township within the liberties of the city. In the centre of the Market-place is a public Pant, or fountain of excellent water, which sup plies the greatest part of the city with that necessary of life. The reservoir is of an octagonal form, and ornamented with a statue of Neptune, which was placed there in 1729-t The Gas ivorks, situated on the banks of the river behind Framwellgate, were completed in 1823, in the winter of which year the city was first lighted with that brilliant vapour.

From the Palace Green is an avenue leading to the public walks, called The Banks, which were formed and are kept in repair by the dean and chapter. \" These celebrated walks,\" savs Mr. Warner, in his Northern Tour, \" accompany the bending of the stream, and command several in teresting peeps at the city, and its august ornaments, the castle and cathedral. The banks, rocky and abrupt on one hand, and sloping to the river on the other, darkened by a solemn depth of shade, sequestered and retired, in the immediate neighbourhood of a busy scene of society, afford a retreat of the most agreeable nature. The variety of scenes which they open also is remarkable ; deep glades, and solemn dells; scarred rock, and verdant lawn ; sylvan glades, and proud castel lated edifices. From the elegant New Bridge, the last mentioned feature is seen to great effect ; the castle and cathedral blend their battlements and turrets together, and rise with inconceivable majesty from the sacred groves which clothe their rocky foundations.

The PrIORY, CATHEDRAL, COLLEGE, &C The church at Durham was, on its first institution, served by seculars, who are said to have been governed by a provost. Bishop AAralcher first projected a change, intending to introduce regular canons, but did not live to effect his purpose. His successor, AArilliam de Carilepho, in the year 1083, accomplished that object, aided by the power of the crown, under the influence of the see of Rome. After having ejected from his church the clergy whom he found within its walls, on ac count of their irregular lives, ostensibly professing the rule of St. Benedict, like their predecessors of Lindisfarne, but some of them married and having children, and most of them of scandalous conversation, he introduced into his cathedral a colony of poor and strict Benedictines, who had travelled northwards from AA'mchelcumb and other places, and had been permitted by AValcher to take up their abode in the long-deserted monasteries of AVearmouth and Jarrow. Upon Aldwin, a man of great discretion and high moral character, was conferred the care and management of Dur ham monastery. After accomplishing this great reformation in the convent, the bishop gave to it * Count Boruwlaski was the son of a Polish nobleman attached to the fortunes of King Stanislaus, who lost bis property in consequence of that attachment, and who had six children, three dwarfs, and three well grown. What is singular enough, they were born alternately, a big one and a little one, though both parents were of the common size. The little count's youngest sister was much less than him, but died at the age of 23. The count continued to grow till he was about 30, when his height was 3 feet 2 inches. He never ex perienced any sickness, but lived in a polite and affluent manner, under the patronage of a lady, a friend of thc family, till love, at the age of 41, intruded into his little peaceful bosom, and involved him in matrimony, care, and perplexity. The lady he chose was of his own country, but of French extraction, and the middle size. They had three children, all girls, and none of them dwarfs. To provide for a family novv became an object big with difficulty, requiring all the exertion of his powers (which could promise but little) and his talents, of which music alone afforded any view of profit. He plays extremely well upon the guitar ; and by having concerts in several of the principal cities in Germany, he raised temporary supplies. At Vienna he was persuaded to turn his thoughts to England, where it was believed the public curiosity might in a little time benefit him sufficiently to enable him to live independently in so cheap a country as Poland. He was furnished by very respectable friends with recommendations to the Duchesses of Devonshire and Rut land, and several of the most distinguished characters in this kingdom, whose kind patronage he is not back ward to acknowledge. He was advised to let himself be seen as a curiosity, and the price of admission was fixed at a guinea. The number of visitors, of course, was not very great. After a pretty long stay in Lon don, be went to Bath and Bristol, and visited Dublin and some other parts of Ireland, whence he returned by way of Liverpool, Birmingham, and Manchester, to London. He also visited Edinburgh and some other towns in Scotland ; but for many years life has resided in Durham, under tbe patronage of the cathedral clergy. In every place be visited, the count acquired a number of friends. In reality, the ease and polite ness of his manners and address please no less than the diminutive, yet elegant, proportions of his figure, astonish those who visit him. His person, when in bis prime, was pleasing and graceful, and his look manly and noble. He speaks French fluently, and English tolerably. He is remarkably lively and cheerful, though fitted for the most serious and rational conversation, and is now above 90 years of age. Such is this wonderful little man \u2014 an object of curiosity really worthy the attention ofthe philosopher, the man of taste, and the anatomist.

Melsonby resigned his office of prior, and retired to Farn, to prepare for death. After that event had taken place, his remains were removed to Durham, and buried in the chapter-house, in the grave of Bi shops Edmund and Ethelred. The writer ofthe life of Bartholomew, then a hermit at Farn, has recorded in his narrative divers miracles in connexion with the death of the ex-prior. Heming, the man deputed to minister to him during his illness, saw a choir of angels, in wdiite apparel, waiting upon the roof of the her mitage to receive his soul ; and at the same moment, Bartholomew espied, in a corner of the cell, the arch fiend himself, in the shape of a bear, lamenting bitterly that the dying man had escaped his snares, and was going to his reward. Bartholomew more than once sprinkled a few drops of holy water on the beast, to make him withdraw; but against these he was proof: till at last the patience of tbe hermit was exhausted, and he boldly dashed the water vessel, with the whole of its contents, in the face of the fiend, and thus, to his great vol. 11. 4 Z"], [382, "360 CITY OF DURHAM.

King Canute had visited it, not with regal pomp, but with the humi liations of a penitent. From Trimdon he proceeded by Garmondsway to Durham, divested of all ensigns of royalty, and even with naked feet. He gave to the church Staindrop, with its appen dages, Cnapton and Shotton, also Raby, Wakerfield, Evenwood, Aycliffe, Lutrington, Eldon, In-, gleton, Thickley, Middleton or Middleston, and Brunton on the south ofthe Tees. William the Conqueror had also extended his patronage to this shrine. Bishop AArilliam de Carilepho, there fore, conceived the idea of erecting a more magnificent church than that of his predecessor Aldune to the memory of the great St. Cuthbert. On his return from exile, he brought over from Nor- deligbt, effected his purpose. The body, when on its road, rested for a night before the altar of St. Mary's* in Gateshead, and was miraculously guarded by milk-white doves, which \"fluttered around the coffin during the hours of darkness. \u2014 Brief Account of Durham Cathedral. * The value of the archdeaconry of Durham, with the rectory of Easington annexed, was rated for first fruits, in the year 1534, at \u00a31000 ; and the archdeaconry of Northumberland, to which the curacy of Howick is annexed, was valued at the same period at \u00a336, 13s. 4d. per annum. In 1832, an act of parliament was passed for separating tbe archdeaconry of Durham from the rectory of Easington ; and the latter living is now in the incumbency ofthe Rev. Henry George Liddell, A. M."], [383, "CITY OF DURHAM. 361 mandy the plan of a new church ; and the old one was pulled down 76 years after its first erection. The foundation of the present cathedral was laid on August 11, 1093, with a solemnity suited to so great and pious a work ; the bishop being assisted therein by Malcolm king of Scotland, and Turgot the prior. It was arranged that the bishop should complete the church, and the prior and monks the monastic buildings; and in those days, before rates were thought of, the work proceeded quickly or slowly in proportion to the amount of altar-offerings and burial-fees, great sums beino frequently paid for the privilege of interment near the patron saint. Bishop Carilepho died in 1095 ; and the work was so zealously proceeded in by his successor, Bishop Flambard, who was also assisted by the convent, that the building was nearly completed before his death in 1128. On September 4, 1104, he caused the body of St. Cuthbert to be carried round the cathedral in a pro cession of monks, with a numerous train of attendants, and then deposited in a sepulchre prepared for it ; he himself preaching a sermon on the occasion.* Over the sacred remains he built a stately * The miraculous incorruptibility of the body of St. Cuthbert has been for centuries \" well attested and as well believed.\" Hegg, on the authority of Bede, relates, that St. Cuthbert \"had now an eleven yeares lyen in his sepulchre (at Lindisfarne), when the monkes thought to place his bones, by this time drye and disrobed of flesh, among their other reliques, for kisses and adoration : but behold a wonder ! They looke for a skeleton, but found an entire body, with joints flexible, and flesh so succulent, that there onely wanted heate to make his body live without a soule ; nay his very funerall weedes were soe fresh, as if putrefaction had not dared to pluck him by the coate. This was rather to pay his debt to heaven than to nature; who after he had restored his soule to God, should keepe back the payment of his body from corruption. In other men it is true, that sleepe is tbe image of death, but here the grave suffer'd a cheat, and death was the image of sleep. After the manifestation of this miracle of bodily immortality after death, Eadfrid then bishop, caused him to be lay'd in a new sepulchre, and to be advanced for state and reverence above the pavement in the sanctuary, for it was not fitt that he should have his grave among the dead, whose body lived by sanctity when his soule was gone.\" During the subsequent wanderings ofthe monks, and their settlement at Chester and Durham, the belief in the incorruptibility of the saint's remains was strongly inculcated. At the time of their translation by Bishop Flambard, however, doubts were entertained of the authenticity of the accounts so confidently given ; and, as the day fixed for the ceremony approached, these doubts began to be openly expressed, and it was even said that the bishop himself was amongst the unbelievers. To ascertain tbe truth, \" it was determined,\" says Dr. Lingard, \" that Turgot, the prior, with nine associates, should open the tomb in the silence of the night, and make a faithful report concerning its contents. As soon as their brethren were retired to rest, the ten visitors entered the church. After a short, but fervent prayer, that God would pardon their temerity, they removed the masonry of the tomb, and beheld a large and ponderous chest, which had been entireiy covered with leather, and strongly secured with nails and plates of iron. To separate the top from the sides required their utmost exertions ; and within it they discovered a second chest, of dimensions more propor- tionate to the human body, and wrapped in a coarse linen cloth, which had previously been dipped in melted wax. That it contained the object of their search, all were agreed : but their fears caused a temporary sus- pension of their labours. From the tradition of their predecessors they had learnt, that no man had ever presumed to disturb the repose of the saint, and escaped the instantaneous vengeance of heaven. The stories of ancient times crowded on their imaginations : engaged in a similar attempt, they expected to meet each moment with a similar punishment ; tbe silence of the night, the sacredness of the place, the superior sanc- tity of their patron, aided these impressions, and at last an almost general wish was expressed to abandon so dangerous an experiment. But Turgot was inflexible. He commanded them to proceed ; and, after a short stru^o-le, the duty of obedience subdued the reluctance of terror. By his direction they conveyed tbe smaller chestlfrom behind the altar to a more convenient place in the middle of the choir; unrolled the cloth; and, with trembling bands, reared up tbe lid. But instead of the remains of the saint, they found a copy of the Gospels, lyings on a second lid, which had not been nailed, but rested on three transverse bars of wood. By the help of two iron rings, fixed at the extremities, it was easily removed, and disclosed the body lying on its ri\"ht side, and apparently entire. At the sight, they gazed on each other in silent astonishment ; and then, retirin-r a few paces, fell\" prostrate on the floor, and repeated in a low voice the seven psalms of penitence. Gradually their fears were dispelled ; they arose, approached the body, lifted it up, and placed it respectfully on a carpet spread on the floor. In the coffin they found a great number of bones wrapped in linen, the \u25a0mortal remains of the other bishops of Lindisfarne, which, to facilitate the conveyance, the monks had depo."], [384, "CITY OF DURHAM. 362 shrine, called the Feretory, composed of costly marble lined and gilt ; and by the liberal donations of the numerous pilgrims who came to worship here, this shrine soon became one of the richest in sited in the same chest, when they were compelled to leave their ancient monastery. These they collected and transferred to a different part of the church ; and, as tbe hour of matins approached, hastily replaced the body in the coffin, and carried it back to its former situation behind the altar. The next evening, at the same hour, they resumed the investigation ; and tbe body was again placed on the floor of the choir. They discovered that it had been originally dressed in a linen robe, a dalmatic, a chasuble, and a mantle. AVith it bad been buried, a pair of scissors, a comb of ivory, a silver altar, a patine, and a small chalice, remarkable for the elegance and richness of its ornaments. Having surveyed the body till their veneration and curiosity were satisfied, they restored it to the tomb in which it had formerly reposed, and hastened to communicate the joyful intelligence to their anxious and impatient brethren.\" Public scepticism, however, was not silenced by this private investigation ; murmurs of dissatisfaction were still heard ; and it was not till the day ap pointed for the ceremony of the translation, that Turgot agreed to give occular proof of the truth of his re port. '' To the number of fifty they entered the choir ; the chest, which enclosed tbe remains, was placed before them, and the lid was removed; when Turgot stept forward, and stretching out his hand, forbade any person to touch the body without his permission, and commanded his monks to watch with jealousy the exe cution of his orders. The abbot of Seez then approached, raised up the body, and proved tbe flexibility of the joints, by moving the head, the arms, and the legs. At the sight every doubt vanished ; the most incre dulous confessed that they were satisfied ; the Te Deum was chaunted, and the translation of the relics was immediately performed with the accustomed ceremonies.\" In placing the scene of the nocturnal examination of St. Cuthbert's coffin in the church, the learned histo rian above quoted appears to have overlooked the fact, that Bishop Carilepbo, on demolishing the old cathe dral, bad erected a temporary shrine for the body in the cloister-garth; and that it was not deposited behind tbe altar till after tbe ceremony of the translation by Flambard. The shrine just mentioned was afterwards adorned with a marble statue of the saint. After the suppression, it was demolished by Dean Horn ; and the statue was broken to pieces by Dean AVhittingham. The shrine in the Feretory was ele vated above the floor. At the visitation in the reign of Henry VIII., Dr. Lee, Dr. Henley, and Mr. Blithman, the commissioners, according to Davies, \" found many valuable and goodly jewels, especially one precious stone, which by tbe estimate of those three visitors, and their skilful lapidaries, was of value suffi cient to redeem a prince- After the spoil of his ornaments and jewels, they approached near to his body, expecting nothing but dust and ashes ; but perceiving tbe chest he lay in strongly bound with iron, the gold smith with a smith's great fore-hammer broke it open, when they found him lying whole, uncorrupt, with his face bare, and bis beard as of a fortnight's growth, and all tbe vestments about him, as he was accustomed to say mass, and his metwand of gold lying by him. AVhen the goldsmith perceived he had broken one of bis legs, in breaking open the chest, he was sore troubled at it, and cried, Alas ! I have broken one of his legs ; which Dr. Henley hearing, called to him, and bade him cast down his bones : The other answered he could not get them asunder, for the sinews and skin held them so that they would not separate. Then Dr. Lee stept up to see if it were so, and turning about, spake in Latin to Dr. Henley, that be was intire, though Dr. Henley not believing his words, called again to have his bones cast down : Dr. Lee answered, If you will not believe me, come up yourself and see him : Then Dr. Henley stept up to him, and handled him, and found he lay whole : Then he commanded them to take him down ; and so it happened contrary to their expectation, that not only his body was whole and uncorrupted, but the vestments wherein bis body lay, and wherein he was accustomed to say mass, were fresh, safe, and not consumed. AVhereupon the visitors com manded him to be carried into the revestry, till the king's pleasure concerning him was further known ; and upon the receipt thereof, the prior and monks buried him in the ground under the place where his shrine was exalted.\" After this interment (1542), a marble stone was placed over the grave. In a recent publication, by a clergyman of Durham, tbe following particulars are narrated: \u2014 \"This marble stone was disturbed for the first time from that period, on Thursday, May 17th, 1827, and such discoveries were then made as proved that the grave which it covered contained the reputed remains of the sainted patron of the church of Dur ham. The blue stone was found to rest upon soil eighteen or twenty inches in thickness, beneath which was a large slab of freestone of nearly a similar size, containing upon its lower face, the name of Richard Hess well, a monk, who is known to have died before the year 1446, and which must have been removed, in 1542, from the cemetery garth on the south side of the church, the only burial place of the monks, to serve as a cover to the vault below it. Its surface was purposely turned downwards, to show that it was converted to a use for which it was not originally intended. In a walled grave beneath this stone, of the form of a paral lelogram, appeared a chest of a similar shape, in great decay, made strong originally by rods of iron, with"], [385, "CITY OF DURHAM. 363 England. It was inclosed within a semicircular termination at the east end of the choir, and was supported by nine stone pillars, the gift of Alexander king of Scotland, who was present at the iron rings on its sides and ends. This was the new coffin, made in 1542. The remains of an earlier coffin next appeared, probably that described in the investigation of 1104 as covered with skins, for there were observed upon it evident traces of some such envelope. In connection with the fragments of the lid of tin's second coffin, were discovered, towards its lower extremity, in a confused state, numerous human bones, some of them those of children. These were probably the relics preserved in the shrine at the dissolution, which might naturally enough have been enclosed in the new coffin prepared for the saint in 1542. The discovery of the remains of children seems to warrant this supposition, as the monks are known to have been in pos session of bones which they passed off as relics of children slain by Herod. After these bones were removed, a third coffin presented itself, which, although in great decay, was of a character materially different from those already described. The character and decorations of this third chest proved it to be the self-same coffin so minutely described in 1104; and, in consequence, the identical coffin in which the remains of Cuthbert were placed at Lindisfarne, in the year 698. Its lid, and sides, aud bottom, and ends, exhibited rude deli neations, in lines carved apparently with the point of a knife, of evangelists, apostles, saints, &c. and the in scriptions in connection with each figure were in characters used at the time of St. Cuthbert's death, and of a period long anterior to tbe settlement of the monks at Durham. In the lower end of this third coffin, and apparently originally placed beneath its lid, which was much broken, was discovered a full grown skull in a somewhat decayed state. This was probably the reputed skull of Oswald, king of Northumberland, the only human relic which was suffered by the investigators of 1 104 to remain in the coffin of Cuthbert. AVhen the fragments of the lid, and sides, and ends of this last-mentioned coffin had been removed, its contents, along with the bottom on which they rested, were raised from the grave, and placed by its side \u2014 and then it was discovered that the dark dingy mass of matter before the eyes of the investigators, consisted of a human ske leton swathed in robes originally of great beauty, but most of them in great decay- The outer envelope, portions of which were found adhering to the coffin, had apparently been of linen; and such was the outer envelope in which Cuthbert had been swathed in 1104. The other robes were so tattered, and torn, and confused, that the exact situation of each could not be ascertained. \"Amid these decayed robes were found other relics of greater interest. 1. A coarse comb of ivory which corresponds most minutely with the description of the ivory comb found and left in the coffin in 1104. This comb had been fabricated by Elfred the sacrist, about the year 1022, for the purpose of assisting in cutting the hair of the saint, which was reported to require that operation periodically ; and as often as it was per formed, a portion of the hair which was removed, was exhibited to the spectators glittering like gold, and miraculously triumphing over the fire to which it was applied. AV'ill it be believed that this pretended hair was in very\" reality gold wire itself; a quantity of which was found in connection with the skull of tbe skele ton durin-T the investigation of which we are writing ? 2. A small tablet of wood covered with silver, proba bly the silver altar spoken of as contained in the coffin in 1104. The thin covering of silver was so much broken during its removal, that a few letters only of an inscription upon its surface could be preserved. The tablet of wood, upon which the plating of silver had been laid, had apparently been previously used in its uiiornamented state for the same purpose of an altar, as it also contained an inscription in the characters of the seventh century, proving that it had been fabricated in honour of St. Peter. 3. A small sacramental burse of the size of an octavo book, made of fine linen, and reduced by time to a dusky brown colour, as if it had been tanned. 4. A rich stole, woven with flattened threads of pure gold, and ornamented with inlet fio-ures in tapestry work of prophets, and apostles, and evangelists, with the name cf each in legible letters of siTk, and an inscription in similar characters, proving that it had been made by command of \u00c6lfl\u00e6d, for the pious Bishop Frithestan. 5. A maniple of the same materials, similarly ornamented, and containing a simi lar historical inscription. 6. A girdle and two bracelets, woven with threads of pure gold and scarlet silk ; the former flattened like those of the stole and maniple above described. 7- A maniple of gold and scarlet silk of the most ingenious and ornamental texture, but from its shape and character belonging to a period a full century posterior to the year 1104 ; and, therefore, placed within tbe coffin after-that period. 8. A cross of pure \"old, as has been ascertained by investigation, found upon the breast bone of the skeleton, siting from its neck^by a cord of silk and gold thread, running through a bright loop of the latter material, and set with fifty-three stones, apparently garnets. The cross, with the stones, weighs 15 dwts. 12 grs. \"AVhen the skeleton of the saint was laid bare, the bones, although no longer connected by sinews and ligaments, were found to be perfect, and smooth, and dry, and in their respective places. Those of the right arm were in an elevated potion, as if giving the benediction. The length which they occupied upon the bottom of the coffin measured five feet eight inches from the extremity of the skull to the ancle. The ribs and the bones of the feet had fallen from their places. A portion of the front of the skull was faintly marked vol. ii. \u2014 44. 5 A"], [386, "CITY OF DURHAM. 364 above ceremony. Bishop Flambard enlarged the plot of ground intended for the monastic build ings ; though he was frequently, till near his death, engaged in dissensions with the prior and monks. with a tint of gold, of the breadth of a ribbon or fillet. In 1104, there was observed a fillet of gold, set with precious stones, upon the forehead of the saint. Portions of the face cloth, which at that time was not per mitted to be raised, were also discovered ; and two round artificial balls, of a whitish colour, were found in the cavities once occupied by the eyes. [[An engraving of the skull is here inserted, to shew that it corresponds with the description given ofthe face of St. Cuthbert, as it was seen through the cere-cloth in 1104.] The result of this investigation proved that these were the reputed remains of St. Cuthbert, and that the story of his incorruptibility was the invention of the monks of Lindisfarne. \u2014 AV'ith the exception of the bones already mentioned, the inner coffin appeared to have at no period contained animal matter, as no traces of flesh and blood were found, even in their most decomposed state. The dust and ashes, in connexion with the skeleton, were those of the various robes in which it bad been clad from time to time, to give it the bulk and appear ance of a body in a state of preservation. \u2014 The bones of Cuthbert, and the other human relics found in his grave, were re-interred the same evening, in a new coffin, with the various fragments of the two external coffins already mentioned, and the grave was closed as before. Such portions of the inner coffin as were pre served, including one of its rings, with the fragments of the silver altar, and that of wood, together with the cross, the ivory comb, the stole, the two maniples, the bracelets, tbe girdle, the gold wire from the skull, the remains of the five outer robes, and some of the rings of the outer coffin made in 1542, were removed into the Manuscript Closet of the Library, where they are now carefully preserved.\" The investigation here described was made by the Rev. AV. N. Darnell, B. D., the Rev. W. S. Gilly, A. M., and the Rev. J. Raine, A. stl., attended by the deputy receiver, the clerk ofthe works, the verger, and the master mason. The last named reverend gentleman shortly after published \" Saint Cuthbert, with an Ac count of the State in which his Remains were found, upon the Opening of his Tomb in Durham Cathedral, in the Year 1827,\" 4to. In 1828 appeared a tract (attributed to Dr. Lingard) entitled, \" Remarks on the ' Saint Cuthbert' of tbe Rev. James Raine, &c. ;\" the author of which argues that this was not the skeleton of the saint, and adduces several instances of bodies being preserved from corruption for centuries ; in parti cular, that of Edward I., which, in 1770, was found with its robes entire; and, coinciding* with the descrip tion ofthe body of St. Cuthbert in 1104, \"a cere-cloth of the finest linen covered the whole surface ofthe body, fitting closely to the features of the face and the fingers of the hands ;\" \u2014 \"a sinking or dip between the chin and under lip was very conspicuous ;\" \u2014 \" there was an unusual fall or cavity on that part of the bridge of the nose which separates the orbits of the eyes ; and some globular substance, possibly the fleshy part of the eye-balls, was moveable in tlieir sockets under the envelope.\" Tbe gold wire described by stir. Raine is also said to have been used to fasten the mitre to the head ; the engravings on the coffin do not exactly answer the description of those on the coffin of St Cuthbert; there ought to have been therein, be sides the comb, the burse, and the portable altar, a plate of gold on the forehead, a chalice, a paten, and a pair of silver scissors ; and the cross, the girdle and bracelets, and the stole and maniples found, are not mentioned in the old accounts ofthe body. The cere-cloth, it is remarked, adhered so closely to the face in 1104, that it could not be removed with the nail ; and the suspicions of the witnesses on that occasion would have quickly detected any imposture. This author contrasts the descriptions of the skull by Reginald in 1 104, and a medical gentleman in 1827 ' \u2014 \" Reginald says that the nose was bent a little outwards : ' aliquan- tulum obcurvus :' the medical gentleman, that the nasal bone was short, and turned upwards in a very sin gular manner. According to Reginald, the chin was deeply furrowed : according to the medical gentleman, the chin bone was most remarkably prominent. Assuredly, little proof of identity can be drawn from these descriptions.\" The difficulty is remarked of distinguishing between the decomposed remains of a human body, and those of the robes and coffin, after the lapse of so many ages. In a note, this author says, \" The writer of these pages hus been favoured with the following information from one of the monks, the deposita- ries ofthe secret: that, according to the tradition which has descended to them, the body of St. Cuthbert was buried under the shrine in the reign of Henry VIII., and was taken up again during the reign of Queen Mary; that the Catholic clergy, previously to their expulsion under Queen Elizabeth, buried many things which they esteemed sacred, in the vault, under the place where tbe shrine had stood, but, for greater secu- rity, deposited the saint's body in a vault, in a different part of the church ; and that the secret was commu- nicated to the restorers of the English Benedictine Congregation, by some of those who had actually been employed in this removal. The spot itself is distinctly marked in a plan of the cathedral which they keep, but that spot they are under an oath of secresy not to disclose.\" The author of the \" Remarks,\" by comparing the preservation of St. Cuthhert's body to similar circum- stances not miraculous, tacitly gives up tbe opinion of a supernatural interference in this case. The tradition, mentioned has long prevailed, and is thus alluded to by Sir AValter Scott in his Marmion : \u2014"], [387, "CITY OF DURHAM. 365 The chapter-house was erected during the episcopacy of Bishop Rufus, 1133-1140. In 1153 Bishop Pudsey began a new chapel at the east end of the cathedral, with the intention of dedicat ing it to the honour of the Arirgin Mary, and to which females might have free access for devotional exercises ; but before the work had proceeded far, vast clefts were discovered in the building which was considered as a manifestation of the saint's displeasure, he having had, when livino* a strong antipathy to the presence of women, and which induced the bishop to relinquish his purpose. Having failed in his attempts at the east end, he commenced building a chapel at the west end which he called the Galilee* The body of the church was vaulted with stone, about the year 1242, by Bishop Farnham and Prior Melsonby. The great central tower was built as high as the gallery by the same prior, and finished by Prior Hugh de Derlyngton, who erected the upper tower in which the bells now hano-.f The eastern transept, called the Nine Altars, was commenced by Bishop Poor, in conjunction with Prior Melsonby-, in 1235, and is supposed to have been finished by Prior Hotoun, who also o-ave the choir the groining of stone which it now possesses. A vestry was erected contiguous to its south aisle about the year 1300, and which was demolished in 1802. Prior Fossour made many reparations and new works. \" There, deep in Durham's gotbic shade, His relics are in secret laid ; Save of bis holiest servants three Deep sworn to solemn secrecy, AA'ho share that wond'rous grace But none may know the place : Still, no account is preserved, nor even a conjecture hazarded, of whose remains were deposited in the exact spot previously occupied by those of St. Cuthbert ; and the tradition, vague in itself, does not state the nature of the sacred articles which were placed there. On the other side, it may be observed that the hands ofthe body of St. Cuthbert, in 1104, were joined over the lower part of the breast; but tlie ric-ht arm ofthe skeleton found in 1827 was raised, as if giving the benediction. Neither of the disputants seems to bave attached sufficient importance to the circumstance, that at the investigation in 1537, accordin-*** to Harpsfield and Davies, one of the legs of the body was broken or injured by the workman employed in opening the coffin. It follows, therefore, that the skeleton found in 1827 cannot be the same which was disinterred at the former period ; for \"the bones, although no longer connected by sinews and liuaments, were found to be perfect, and smooth, and dry, and in their respective places ;\" and there is no good reason for disputing the authority of those writers in this particular, if admissible in others. An iron-bound chest long lay neglected in the bishop's palace ; and Hutchinson says that tradition affirmed it to have contained the saint's body. * The dislike of St. Cuthbert to women is said by some to have been occasioned by a false charge of seduc tion, brought against him by a daughter of the king of the Picts, and for which he was about to be punished, when the ground miraculously opened and swallowed her up alive. Other authorities impute it to the horror felt by the saint at the wickedness which had been exposed by tbe burning of Coldingham monastery. He appropriated a chapel in a distant part of the island of Lindisfarne for the reception of females ; and, in such abhorrence did this stern saint hold the fair sex, that he detested cattle on their account, and would not per mit a cow to come within sight of his sacred walls ; because \" where there is a cow there must be a woman, and where there is a woman there must be mischief.\" In 1333, the queen of Edward III., having followed the king to Durham, was conducted to him through the gate of the abbey to the prior's lodgings, where having supped, and gone to bed with her royal lord, she was soon disturbed by one of the monks, who rudely intimated to the king, that St. Cuthbert by no means loved the company of her sex. The queen upon this got out of bed, and having hastilv dressed herself, went to the castle for the remaining part of the night, asking pardon for the crime she had inadvertently been guilty of against the patron saint. \u2014 In 1417, two servant girls of Newcastle were enjoined certain penances, for having put on the habits of men, and impiously approached the shrine of St. Cuthbert at Durham. + Upon the summit was a small cupola or spire, cased with copper or brass; and in this state it remained till the midnight preceding Corpus Christi Day, 1429, when it was set on fire by lightning, while the monks were at prayer, and most materially injured. The fire was not discovered till long after day-break, and :!; was not extinguished till after mid-day. This accident cust the church \u00a3233, 6s. 8d. in repairs-"], [388, "366 CITY OF DURHAM. On December 31, 1540, Hugh AVhitehead, prior, in conjunction with the convent, surrendered the monastery into the king's hands; the revenues of which were then valued, according to Dug dale, at \u00a3\"1366, 10s. 5d. ; but Speed says they were rated at \u00a31615, 14s. lOd. On the 12th of May, 1541, the king granted a new Foundation Charter to this church, instituting therein a dean and twelve prebendaries, and ordaining, that instead of the title of the cathedral church of the blessed Mary the Virgin and St. Cuthbert the Bishop, the same should for ever thereafter bear the denomination of the cathedral church of Christ and blessed Mary the Virgin. He made the dean and prebendaries, and their successors, a body corporate, by the name of the dean and chapter of the cathedral church of Christ and blessed Mary the Virgin; empowering them, under that deno mination, to do all legal acts, and plead and be impleaded. He also granted them all the scite of the monastery, and the ancient rights, liberties, and privileges thereof. The Endowment made by the king bears date the 16th of May, 1541. The establishment at present, besides the dean and prebendaries, consists of two archdeacons chosen from among the prebendaries), eight minor canons, .eight singing men, ten singing- boys, a master of the choristers, eight alms men, two masters of the grammar school, eighteen scholars, two vergers, and one porter. Willis says, \"The king, converting the priory into a college of se culars, assigned his new dean and prebends their respective apartments out of the old monastry, v. itliin the precincts of which the bishop, dean, prebendaries, and other members, have very good houses, the best of any cathedral in England, according to the dignity of the prebends, which are reputed more richly endowed than any other church, owing, as I hear, to the members allotting themselves, at first, their respective dividends or shares out of the chapter lands, and not leasing them in common, by which practice (in this sole church of the new foundation) some prebends are of more value than others, whereas in the rest they are all equal, as they might be here possibly at first, though the improvements of estates have made a disproportion, as it now continues.'' They are frequently called \" the golden prebends of Durham,\" on account of tlieir wealth and extensive patronage. The statutes by which the dean and chapter are regulated were prepared by Nicholas Heath, archbishop-elect of York ; Edmund Bonner, bishop of London ; Cuthbert Tunstall, bishop of Durham ; Thomas Thirlby, bishop of Ely ; and AArilliam Armistead, chaplain to their majesties ; who were commissioned for that purpose. These statutes were confirmed under the great seal, on the 20th of March, in the first and second years of the reign of Philip and Mary. In chapter xviii. the following- lands, manors, &c. are assigned to the dean and prebendaries, viz. : \u2014 To lhe Deanery. \u2014 The manor and park of Bearpark, with Herber-close, and three arable closes, near Stot gate, Almsford, with Shipley and Whitwell, North and South Ravensflat, with Summer Pasture and Holme ; the tithes ofthe rectories of Billingham and Merrington, and ofthe villages belonging to them.

In 1567, tne prebends were augmented with ad ditional lands and tithes, which, at that period, produced to each of the prebendaries upwards of \u00a314 per annum. In 1577, the disturbances between the chapter and their tenants became so se rious as to require the interposition of the state ; and the queen's privy council in the north were ordered to hear the parties, and make determination thereon; when an adjudication was made, as a perpetual ordinance to be observed between them. In 1633, the dean and chapter petitioned the king (then at Durham) for a confirmation of their charters and endowments, which was granted. The disputes between the chapter and their tenants were again laid before the council in 1639, and an order was made thereon. The proceedings during the Commonwealth will be noticed under the article University. In 1649, a commission of survey was issued, relative to the possessions of thechurch.

He was educated at St. John's College, Cambridge ; ancl it is said he was nominated to the see of Durham in 1 552 (Bishop Tunstall being then living), but declined accepting it. Soon after the accession of Queen Mary, he was ejected from the deanery, and lived abroad during the whole of her reign, distinguishing himself in some warm theological discussions at Frankfort. On the accession of Elizabeth, he was restored to his dignity, and soon after became bishop of Winchester. He died June 1, 1579. His name is frequently coupled with that of Dean Whittingham, as having fanatically destroyed many of the antiquities of the cathedral and college of Durham. + This zealous ecclesiastic was born in 1524 in the city of Chester. He matriculated at Brazen-nose College, Oxford, which he quitted for a fellowship at All Souls in the same university, and that again for a studentship at Christ Church. In 1550, the rigour exercised by Mary against the Protestants caused him to withdraw to the continent, where settling at Frankfort, he became by marriage nearly connected to the great reformer of Geneva. The attachment which this alliance confirmed in him to the peculiar dogmata of Calvin, with respect to church discipline, occasioned much ill-will between him and the clergy of Durham, when, after her accession to the throne, Elizabeth sent for him, and preferred him to the deanery of that cathedral. Wood says that he caused some of tile stone coffins of the priors \" to be plucked up, and appointed them to be used as troughs, for horses to drink in, or hogs to feed in. All the marble and free stones also that covered them, and other graves, he caused to be taken away and broken, some of which served to make pave- ment in his house. He also defaced all such stones as had any pictures of brass, or other imagery work, or chalice wrought, engraven upon them ; and the residue he took away and employed them to his own use, and did make a washing house of them, at the end of the centery garth ; so that it could not be discerned afterwards that ever any were buried in the said centery garth, it was so plain and straight. The truth is, he could not abide any thing lhat appertained to a goodly religiousness, or monastical life.\" An apologist for Whittingham, speaking of these charges by Wood, says, \" Sure I am that all these, and other the like impieties, as the Oxonian calls them, are in no degree so impious, as what himself says of that idolatrous monk Cuthbert's being brought to Durham, by the power and will of Almighty God, to set up a church full of idols, and priests almost as stupid as the wooden images they worshipped.\" Dean Whittingham assisted in translating the Geneva Bible ; and the initials of his name are affixed to a few of the Psalms in Hopkins and Sternhold's version. He died June 10, 1579, and was buried in the cathedral. \" Soon after was a tomb-stone laid over his grave, with an epitaph of twelve long and short verses, engraven on a brass plate, fastened thereto ; which, with most, if not all of the monu- ments, which were set up after his time, were miserably defaced by the Scots, when they invaded England, in 1(110. So that as he had before in a woeful manner, violated the monuments of his predecessors and others, so was his, by invaders; and nothing now left to preserve his memory, or person to shew the place where his carcase was lodged.\" X He had been a voluntary exile in the time of Queen Mary, and travelling to Rome in 1558, was put into the inquisition there, on n charge of heresy, said to be contained in his writings on logio and rhetoric. He suffered the torture, and would have been put to death on refusing to deny his faith, had not a fire happened, which induced the populace to force open the prison, that those confined might not perish ; by which accident he escaped. He was afterwards employed on several embassies by Queen Elizabeth.\u2014 Strype. vol. ii. 5 B"], [390, "368 CITY OF DURHAM. p. m. Bland. \u2014 Thomas Dampier, D. D., 1774, p. m. Cowper. \u2014 Hon.

He was also intended for the law ; but not finding the profession adapted to his taste, he took deacon's orders in the church in 1/23- His first work was \" Miscellaneous Translations, in Prose and Verse,\" from Roman authors, with a Latin dedi cation to Sir George Sutton, who bestowed on him a small vicarage. On visiting London, he joined a set of minor wits iu attacking Pope. In 1727, he published a \" Critical and Philosophical Inquiry into the Causes of Prodigies and Miracles as related by Historians,\" which he dedicated to Sir Robert Sutton, through whose interest he became I\\I. A. and rector of Brand Broughton, Lincolnshire. In 173G appeared his \" Alliance between Church and State, or the Necessity and Equity of an established Religion and Test Law demonstrated from the Essence and End of Civil Society, upon the fundamental Principles of the Law of Nature and Nations.\" In 1738 was published the first volume of his great work, \" The Divine Legation of Moses demonstrated on the Principles of a Religious Deist, from the Omission of the Doctrine ofa Future State of Rewards and Punishments in the Jewish Dispensation ;\" which being attacked by several opponents, he published a \" Vindication\" of his opinions. He now endeavoured to conciliate Pope, by writing in his defence ; and an intimacy commenced between them which lasted till the death of the poet, when he bequeathed to AVarburton half his library, and the copyright of such of his works already printed as were not otherwise disposed of, \u2014 a legacy supposed to have been worth __?4000. Pope had introduced him to Sir. Allen, of Prior Park, near Bath, whose niece, Miss Gertrude Tucker, he married in 1740 ; and this connexion ultimately made him possessor of the splendid seat of Prior Park. He now rapidly advanced in the course of preferment, and in 1759 became bishop of Gloucester. In 17G2, he severely animadverted on the princi ples of Methodism, in his \" Doctrine of Grace, or the Office and Operation of the Holy Spirit vindicated from the Insults of Infidelity and the Abuses of Fanaticism.\" The last years of his life were embittered by the decease of an only son, who fell a victim to consumption at the age of 19. Bishop AVarburton died at Gloucester, June 7, 1779, and was interred in the cathedral church, where a monument was erected to his memory. The second, third, fourth, and fifth volumes of his *' Divine Legation\" had been published in succession. His woiks were collected and published by his friend, Bishop Hurd, in 1788, G vols. ito. ; and a biographical memoir, forming a seventh volume, appeared several years after Encye. Brit. \u25a0f He was also archdeacon of Northumberland, and stands pre-eminent amongst the clergy of the diocese; having esta blished, at bis own expense, parochial libraries, in every parish in Northumberland, comprising upwards of 30,000 volumes, which cost him about \u00a31400, although he was supplied with them by the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge at 40 per cent, under prime cost. These useful libraries are placed* \"under the care of the parochial ministers, and the books are lent gratuitously to the parishioners. X. John Fox was born at Boston in Lincolnshire in 1517, and was educated at the university of Oxford, from whence he was expelled for heresy in 1515. After suffering great distress, being deserted by his friends for his religion, he was re stored to his fellowship in the reign of Edward VI. In the reign of Mary he went abroad, and earned a subsistence at Basle by correcting in a printing-office. On the accession of Elizabeth, he returned to England. It is said that he resigned his prebend at Durham on account of the strictness of the church discipline. He, however, obtained a prebend in the church of Salisbury.; and he might have received much higher preferment if he would have subscribed to the articles enforced by the church. In 1575, Fox, though narrow in his notions of toleration, interceded for the German Anabaptists, then under persecution. He died in 1587. His \" History of the Acts and Monuments of the Church,\" or \" Book of Martyrs,\" hag elicited volumes both of praise and censure. \u2014 Biog. Bril. Preface to Wordsworth's Eccl.

He became master of Durham school in 1098 ; and being ordained deacon and priest in 1609, was collated to the 6th prebend by Bishop James. He was afterwards rector of Boldon, master of Gateshead hospital, and one of the high commissioners for the province of Vovk. On July 7, ] 628, he preached a sermon in the cathedral of Durham, from Psalm xxxi. 7, \" I hate them that hold of superstitious vani ties,\" in which he took occasion to make a most bitter invective against some of the bishops, charging them with 110 less than popery and idolatry. He was, in consequence, degraded and dispossessed of all his ecclesiastical preferments, and fined ,\u00a3500, for the non-pavment of which he suffered eleven years imprisonment in the King's Bench, and at length was set at liberty bv the house of commons in 1640. On Dr. Carr's death, he was restored to his prebend by the lords, and lived to the year 1652, or near it, having passed his 82d year. + He was the youngest of two sons of John Lord Bishop of Durham, and was born November 11, 175C. He was edu- cated at Eton, and afterwards at All Soul's College, Oxford. In 1781, the Duke of Bridgewater presented him to the rec- tory of Middle in Shropshire, and, in 1797, to that of Whitchurch in the same county, both which he retained till his death. In 1796, he published an edition of the Hippolvtes of Euripides; and he also edited \"A Fragment of an Ode of Sappho, from Longinus ; and an Ode of Sappho, from Dionysius Halicarn.\" In 1773, he wrote a memoir cf the Lord Chancellor Egerton for the Biographia Britannica ; and in the l'8th volume of the Transactions of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts he published a description ofthe under-ground inclined plane, executed by the late Duke of Bridgewater, at 'Walk- den Moor, in Lancashire. In Januarv, 1808, Mr. Egerton, and his sister Lady Amelia, the wife of Sir Abraham Hume, were raised by his majesty's sign manual, to the rank of earl's children ; and on the 21st of October, 1823, he succeeded his brother in his' titles being eighth Earl of Bridgewater, ninth Viscount Brackley, and Baron EHesmere, a Prince of the holy Roman empire. He resided'manv years at Paris, where he defended the public character ofthe late Duke of Bridgewater. The earl's eccentricities were a general topic of conversation at Paris : he had. at the time of his death, his house nearly filled with doers and cats, which he had picked up at different places. Of the fifteen dogs which he kept, two were admitted to the honours of his table, and the whole of them were frequently dressed up in clothes like human beings. In his last days when so debilitated as to be unable to leave his own grounds, he is said to have adopted a strange substitute tor the sports of the field, to which he had been addicted. In the garden at the back of his house there were placed about 300 rabbits, and as manv pigeons and partridges, whose wings had been cut. Provided with a gun, and supported by sen ants, the infirm earl would enter the garden and shoot two or three head of game, lo be afterwards put upon the table as his sporting trophies ! He died in April, 1829. His will is long and extraordinary ; but nothing is intimated relating to his favourite dogs. His remains were brought to England tor interment."], [392, "370 CITY OF DURHAM. p. depr. Marleye\u2014 William Selby, A. stl., 1608\u2014 Peter Smart, A.

In 1642 he obtained a fellowship, from which he was ejected in 1649 for refusing to take the covenant. He then visited France and Italy; and returning home on the Restoration, he was chosen one of the university preachers, and in 1061 he assisted in revising the Liturgy. In 1664 he was made dean of York, and towards tlie close of that year he was removed to tlie deanery of St. Paul's, London. In this station he distinguished himself by his munificent contributions towards the repair, and afterwards to the rebuilding of the cathedral. In 1668 he was presented by the king to the archdeaconry of Canterbury, which preferment he resigned after he had held it two years. He was chosen prolocutor of the lower house of convocation, which station he held in 1677, when he was unexpectedly raised to the metropolitan see of Canterbury. In 1687, he was, with six other prelates, committed to the Tower for presenting to King James II. a remonstrance against the decla ration of indulgence ordered to be read in churches ; and being tried in the court of King's Bench, the archbishop and his colleagues were acquitted. On the secession of the king, he concurred with the lords, spiritual and temporal, assembled at Guildhall, December 11, 1688, in signing an address to the Prince of Orange, demanding a free parliament, the security of laws, liberty, and property, and recommending indulgence to Protestant dissenters. He subsequently refused to take the oath of allegiance to WUliam III. and his consort, in consequence of wiiich he was removed from his high station in the church, in February, 1689 ; and, a few months after, he retired to Fresingfield, where he died in November, 1693. Sancroft was a man of great industry and learning, of which he left evidence in several published works and a large collection of manuscripts. -\u2014Biog. Brit."], [393, "CITY OF DURHAM. 371 p. m.

He was admitted at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1708, and became a fellow of his college and D. D. in 1729. He received various preferments in ihe church, including the rectory of Rothbury in Northumberland, and a prebend in York cathedral; and was finally collated to lhe archdeaconry of Northumberland and made prebendary of Durham.

GrainillcS/iarp, Esq., a gentleman eminent for his philanthropy, purity of principles, and learning, and one of the sons of Dr. Sharp, was born at Durham in 1734. He was educated for the bar, but did not practise at it ; and he obtained a place in the Ordnance office, which he resigned at the commencement of thc American war, thc principles of which he did not approve. He then took chambers in the Temple, and led a life of private study. He first became known to the public by bis spirited defence of a poor and friendless negro named Somerset. This man, having been brought to England by bis master, during a fit of sickness was turned out into the streets to die. With unparalleled baseness, when by the charity of Mr. Sharp and others he had been restored to health, he was claimed again as propertv, the result of which was a series of law proceedings, which not only cleared Somerset from the contemptible being who as serted a ri\u00bbht to his person, but determined that slavery could not exist in Great Britain. Such an incident could not tail to deeply impress a benevolent mind, and slavery in every country became the object of Mr. Sharp's unceasing hostility. Having succeeded in the case of an individual negro, he interested himself in the condition of others, whom he found wandering in the streets of London, and at his own expense sent a number of them to Sierra Leone ; he also soon after became tlie institutor of the celebrated Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade, and witli similar humanity sought to modify the harsb practice of impressment. He was likewise led by his political principles to be tlie warm advocate of parliamentary reform, in support of which be published \" A Declaration of the People's Natural Right to a Share in the Legislature,\" in which work he contends for a revival of the system and political institutions of Alfred. This worthy individual, who attained the age of 79, died July 6, 1813, unceasing in study, and active in benevolence to the last. He was an able linguist, and versed in theology; in respect to which he exhibited an ardent zeal for the principles of the Church of England ; and his private conduct was as pious and regular as his exertions in tlie cause of humanity were spirited and en thusiastic. His library was very extensive, and he possessed a curious collection of Bibles, some of which he presented to the British and Foreign Bible Society, of which he was also a zealous promoter. He published tracts on various subjects ; but his principal work is \" Remarks on the Uses of the Definitive Article in the Greek Testament, &c to which is added a plain matter-of-fact Argument for the Divinity of Christ,\" 1798, 8vo.\u2014 Nichols's Lit. Ance. Life by Houre. f This learned divine was born at 1703, at Cartmel in Lancashire, where his father was a clergyman of the established church. Ha studied at St. John's College, Cambridge, where he was admitted B. A. in 1723 ; and lie was afterwards elected a fellow of Christ's College, in the same university. He took the degree of M. A. in 1727, and in 1 732 he made himself known by an English translation of Archbishop King's \" Essay upon the Origin of Evil,\" with notes and observations. During the controversy occasioned by Dr. Samuel Clarke's \" Demonstration of' the Being and Attributes of God,\" Law published a very ingenious \" Enquiry into tbe Ideas of Space, Time, &c.\" in which he combats the opinions of Dr. Clarke. While at college, he also assisted in editing Stephen's \" Thesaurus Lin gu\u00e6 Latin\u00e6,\" 1735, 4 vols. folio. In 1737 he was presented to the living ut* Graystock in Cumberland. In 1743 he obtained the archdeaconry of Carlisle, with the annexed rectory of Salkeld, where he took up his residence in 1746. \" There he wrote his \" Consider ations on the Theory of Religion,\" with \" Reflections on the Life and Character of Christ.\" which may be considered as the most va luable productions of his pen, and liave been frequently reprinted. In 1749 he proceeded D. D., and in his inaugural thesis he defended the doctrine of the natural mortality of the soul. He held several benefices previously to his elevation to the bishopric of Carlisle, which took place in 1769, through tbe influence of the Duke of Graston, chancellor of the university. In 1774 he published a tract, entitled \" Considerations on the Propriety of requiring Subscription to Articles of Faith ;\" and he afterwards edited the works of Locke, with a preface and life of the author, 4 vols. 4to. He died at the episcopal seat of Rose Castle in Cumberland, August 14, 1787. Besides the works mentioned already, he was the author of sermons, controversial tracts, and \" Observations occasioned by tbe Contest about Lite, \u25a0fary Property,\" 1776, 8vo.

In its original form, this edifice consisted of the nave and chancel, with their side-aisles, a middle transept, two western towers, and the lofty steeple rising from the intersection of the nave and transept; the whole terminating to the east in the se micircular projections usual in the early ages. Afterwards, the Galilee chapel was added on the west ; and the chapel of the Nine Altars, forming another transept, was appended on the east. The cathedral, it has been observed, \" now exhibits not only the most perfect specimen of Norman architecture in the kingdom, but a most instructive series of examples of other styles in connexion with the early English, tlie decorated, and the perpendicular periods.'\"* In the year 177*3. upon a survey of the cathedral, it was found to be in great want of repair ; when the dean and chapter immediately began the costly work, which has been continued with little intermission to the present time ; and though some alterations have been made not much in accordance with good taste, the progress of decay has been happily arrested, as may be concluded from the fact that, in 177*5, the walls of the north front were covered with wall-flowers, stone-crop, and other plants of a similar nature. \" Of late years,\" says Mr. Allan, \" the expense of this excel lent undertaking has amounted to a sum not less than from _C1500 to oP2000 annually ; and by means of a judicious appropriation of the means provided for this purpose, an income has been se cured sufficient to defray the charges of future repairs. The dean and chapter have evinced their munificence by an annual donation of _C300 in aid of this great undertaking, which reflects the highest honour on that venerable and opulent body.'1 The North Front. \u2014 In the time of Prior Algar, the buildings which occupied what is now called the Palace Green were removed, and the whole north front of the cathedral is now displayed at once to the view. Its magnificent proportions, its windows, its pilasters, and its arches, present a combination peculiarly striking ancl imposing. The immense north window ofthe middle transept was originally constructed by Prior Fossour, and restored by Prior Castell, whose effigies formerly occupied two roundels above it. These are now replaced by a figure of Bishop Pudsey and that ofa prior in his chair. Hutchinson observes that, a century after this, the figures will betray the spectator into an error, and lead him to determine that this part of the structure was erected, or at least rebuilt, by Pudsey-. A square and an octagonal tower surmount the corners of this tran sept. On the north-west corner tower of the east transept was placed the sculpture of the women and cow, which has given rise to the tradition before recorded : it was restored some years ago. This transept is ornamented with octagonal corner towers, surmounted by conical spires. The north front of the cathedral has lost some of its \" fair proportions11 during the late repairs; as, in stead of restoring its ornamental projections, they have been chiselled down to the plainness re quired. The length of the cathedral from east to west is 420 feet. The Great Central Tower is 212 feet high. There are two long windows in each front, above which is the bell-loft,*f- and the whole is surmounted by a parapet. Figures of saints and patrons * According to Mr. Rickman, the Norman style, speaking in a general way, prevailed from the Conquest to about the year 1190, the early English from 1190 to 1300, the decorated from 1300 to 1400, and the per pendicular from 1400 to the dissolution. t There were anciently three bells in this tower, to which Thomas Spark, first prebendary of the third stall, added three more from one of the western towers. In 1632, eight bells were cast from the metal of the original ones, and cost \u00a3128, 12s. Jd. They were re-cast in 1693. On October 25, 1766, in honour of the accession of King George III., the bells were rung for the first time after being re-hung in one level, the tenor bell being 35 cwt. The third bell had been re-cast."], [395, "CITY OF DURHAM. 373 of the see formerly stood in niches ; but these were removed during the late repairs.* The upper part of this tower has been recently cased with cement ; but, from the expensiveness of this mate rial, the remainder was renovated in the usual way The West Front of the cathedral is seen to great advantage from the opposite side of the river. \"The basement line of the elevation,\" says Mr. Carter, \"presents the projecting chapel of the Galilee, flanked by huge buttresses and arches, springing out of the rock, to contribute due sup- port to its walls, which form one vast combination of security to the main edifice itself.\" Above is the great west window, divided into seven compartments, and ornamented with the most eleo-ant tracery, beneath a pointed arch : it is the work of Prior Fossour. At the north and south corners of the building are square towers, 143 feet high, richly adorned with pilasters ancl blank arches, and surmounted by turrets and parapets. The latter ornaments are modern ; though an unsuccess ful attempt has been made to render them similar to the original forms. There were formerly spires of wood covered with lead on these towers ; but they were removed about the year I667. The East Front, or Nine Altars, displayed a fine specimen of the early English architecture, at the time when that style was rapidly assuming the decorated character ; but, under the chisel ling process above alluded to, the boldness of its canopies, niches, and other ornaments, has been materially injured. It presents two tiers of lofty, narrow, pointed windows; the lower tier con taining nine, and the upper six, its centre being occupied by a large circular window, called St. Catherines window, from its bearing the form of the wheel used at her martyrdom. The original beautiful tracery of this window has been restored ; but colossal busts of William Rufus and Bishop Carilepho, which stood under canopies in the buttresses adjoining to it, were removed during the late repairs. The South Side of the cathedral is enclosed by the cloisters, college, &c. The principal entrance to the cathedral is by a gateway on the north, wbich was originally built by Bishop Pudsey, at the time when the ancient entrance from the west was closed by the Galilee; but, within the last 50 years, it has suffered many incongruous alterations. \u2022f- On the door is a cu rious metallic ring, or knocker, sculptured with a terrific visage in bold relief, and well executed, with which persons claiming sanctuary were accustomed to alarm the inmates of the cathedral in the night-time. | There was also an ancient chapel, dedicated to the Holy Cross, in this place. * They are now deposited, with others from the eastern face of the Nine Altars and other parts of the church, in the shrine. \" Most of these figures are highly interesting, some from the persons whom they re present, and others from their style of carving. A mutilated effigy, bearing in its hands the figure of a church, with round-headed windows and door-ways, represents, perhaps, Bishop Carileph ; and there are effigies of other bishops, some of them of good execution. One, in particular, whose face is almost entirely obliterated by time, holds in his hand a crozier, of the decorated period, the upper part of which is as perfect as it was left by the carver. There are, moreover, mutilated figures of St. George and the Dragon, of St. Michael and the Serpent, affording, as far as it goes, a good specimen of the body armour of the period in which it was carved; of St. Christopher with the burden upon his back, from which he derived his name; St. Anthony with his bell ; and, most especially, a well-carved figure of St. Cuthbert holding in one of his hands his usual accompaniment, the head of King Oswald, the founder of his see.\" Several other frag ments of antiquity have been placed here.\u2014 Brief Ace. of Durh.

X In ancient time, before the house was suppress,, the abbey church, the church-yard, and all the circuit thereof was a sanctuary for all manner of men that committed any great offence, as killing of a man in his own defence, or any prisoners who had broken out of prison, and fled to the church door, knocking to have it opened : also certain men lay in two chambers over the north door for that purpose, that when any such offenders came and knocked, they instantly let them in at any hour of the night ; and run quickly to the"], [396, "CITY OF DURHAM 374 The interior decorations of th s gateway have suffered much from time and the white-wash with which they are plastered. On entering the cathedral, the visitor is overwhelmed with the awful solemnity of the scene by which he is surrounded; ancl the striking magnificence of the whole precludes, for some time at least, every idea of examining the parts of which it is composed. \" How reverend is the face of this tall pile, Whose ancient pillars rear their marble heads, To bear aloft its areb'd and ponderous roof, By its own weight made steadfast and immoveable, Looking tranquillity.\" The length of the nave is 240 feet ; and its breadth, with that of the side-aisles, 80 feet. The height of the vaulted roof is 'JO feet. \" In the inside of the cathedral,\" says Mr. Pennant, \"is preserved much of the ponderous, yet venerable magnificence of the early Norman style. The pillars are vast cylinders, 23 feet in circumference.\" Hutchinson adds, \" The two extreme columns to the west rise from bases of the form of a complicated cross, having pointed projections from the interior angles ; the dimensions of each base are 15 feet every way, being exactly similar to those wiiich support the columns of the tower and dome, vulgarly called the lanthorn ; the pillars are clustered, having three semicircular pilasters in each front, divided by an angular projection. The next column eastward rises from a base of the form of a cross, 12 feet each way, supporting a clus tered pillar, thc pilasters of which, towards the centre aisle, run up to the roof through the facia, between the upper windows; the next rises from a square base of eight feet, and is richly fluted, terminating with a plain capital, which supports the gallery above the side aisle. Each interme diate pillar is clustered like those described in the second place, stretching up to the roof, ancl those in the intervals are circular, making the succession consist of a clustered pillar and a round one al ternately ; the first round pillar is fluted as before described, the second covered with the zigzag figure, and the third grooved with the figure ofa net. The pillars opposite to each other are ex actly similar in their ornaments and dimensions. It is also to be observed, the clustered and round pillars through all the building have their bases of the dimensions before set forth. All the side walls are decorated with pilasters opposite to the columns, and the interior spaces under the win dows are filled with double pilasters and intersecting round arches throughout the whole building, Galiley bell, and toll'd it, that whosoever heard it might know that some bad taken sanctuary. When the prior bad notice thereof, he sent orders to keep themselves within the sanctuary ; that is, wdthin the church and church-yard, and that every one should have a gown of black cloth, with a yellow cross, called St. Cuth bert's cross, at the left shoulder, that every one might see the privilege granted to St. Cutbbert's shrine, for offenders to fly unto for succour, and safeguard of their lives, till they could obtain their prince's pardon : and that they should lie within the church or sanctuary, on a grate, made only for that purpose, adjoining to the Galiley south door. They had likewise meat, drink, bedding, and other necessaries, at the cost of the house, for thirty-seven days, being only such as were necessary for such offenders, until the prior and con vent could get them conveyed out of the diocese. This privilege was confirmed not only by King Guthrid, but by King Alured likewise.\" \u2014 Davies. Several instances are recorded of persons claiming this privilege, one of which is as follows : \u2014 \" On the 25th of February, 1185, James Manfeeid, late of Wycliff, 'gentilman,' in his own person came to the church of St. Cuthbert, at Durham, and there, tbe bells being rung, urgently requested the immunity of tbe said church, and the liberty of St. Cuthbert, for that he, near the village of Ovyngton, in the county of York, about the 26th of January, as he believes, in the year aforesaid, along with others, made an attack upon one Sir Rolland Mebburne, chaplain, rector ofthe church of Wycliff, and feloniously struck him in bis body with a ' Wallych-bill,' (Welsh bill or axe) and gave him a mortal wound of which he instantly died ; for 'which felony, the said James begged the immunity of the said church, in the presence of the vicar of Kellow, Roger Morland, and Nicholas Dixon, witnesses called in upon the occasion.\""], [397, "CITY OF DURHAM. 375 except only in the east transept. The arches between the great columns are all semicircular, the outward members dentelled, the interiors zigzagU The under gallery opens to the middle aisle, with one round arch divided within into two arches, supported on a centre pillar. There is an upper gallery of single arches. At the west end of the nave is a short cross aisle or transept, in length 90 feet, and 18 feet wide from the centres of the columns, over the ends of which rise the west towers.\" The groined roof of the nave and aisles is remarkably chaste ancl beautiful. In the west wall of the nave is still visible the lofty arch which formed the principal entrance previous to the erection of the Galilee; and on each side of it are doors leading into that chapel. In the south aisle, and immediately opposite the north entrance, is a door-way leading into the cloister; which, from its graceful proportions and chaste ornaments, is considered to belong to Bishop Pudsey's period, when the Norman architecture had reached its perfection.* At the east end of the aisle is another door-way, highly ornamented with pilasters and arches. In the pave ment of the nave, near the west end, is a cross of blue marble, traditionally said to mark the boun dary beyond which females were not permitted to advance in the direction of the shrine. The font was the work of Dean Hunt and the chapter. The first child baptized in it was \"Richard sonne of Mr. John Robson, parson of Morpethe, 24th March, 1621.\" It is described by a traveller who visited Durham in 1634, as \" not to be paralleled in our land.

In turning from the north door towards the Galilee, between the two first pillars on the left hand, stood our Lady of Pittie's altar, enclosed with wainscot, and embellished with a painting of the Virgin supporting upon her knees our Saviour, in the state in which he was taken from the cross. In the recess, under the western tower, was St. Saviour's altar. In the south aisle, in the space between the two pillars opposite to the font, stood an altar with a rood called the **** Bound Rood,\" upon which was a carving of the Redeemer, with his hands tied by a cord, and thence the name. Prior Burnaby was buried in the middle aisle of the nave. A partition wall anciently extended across the east end of the middle aisle of the nave from the one to the other of the western pillars which support the central tower. In front of this wall, on tbe west, stood a splendid altar, called Jesus' Altar, at which mass was sung every Friday. A small door-way at each end led to the transept ; and upon the altar itself stood a pax, or folding tablet, used during mass, containing a representation of the crucifixion, in brilliant, colours. Above the altar, and upon the face of tbe wall, were carved in stone and gilt the history and passion of our Redeemer ; still higher, were figures of the apostles, in the same material ; and above, upon a richly-ornamented parapet, stood \" tbe most famous rood in all the land,\" with the picture of Mary on one side of our Saviour, and that of St. John on the other. Two arch- angels, glittering with gold, stood, one by Mary, and another by John ; \" so that, for the beauty of the wall, the stateliness of the picture, and the liveliness of the painting, it was thought to be one of the grandest monuments in the church.\" Behind this wall of partition, and beneath tlie tower, stood the clock. Priors Auckland and Castell were buried before Jesus' Altar, under marble stones : that of the latter was inlaid with his half-length figure in brass, and an inscription in verse. The space between the two pillars of the north aisle, next adjoining to the Altar of Jesus, was occupied by a loft, in which stood \" a pair of organs,\" used by the master and choristers on Fridays weekly, when mass was sung at the altar adjoining. The north aisle of the nave was separated from the transept by folding doors, never opened except on pro- cession days. Above the door way, the wooden work was carried up almost to the groining of the aisle, and was surmounted by long spikes of iron. Annual processions were made by the prior and convent, on St. Mark's day, to the church of St. Mary-le-Bow ; on Monday in Ascension-week, to St. Oswald's; on Tues- day, to St. Margaret's ; and on Wednesday, to St. Nicholas' ; on each of which occasions a sermon was preached by one of the monks. On Ascension-day, Whit-Sunday, and Trinity-Sunday yearly, were splen- did processions, in which the prior and monks appeared clad in all the pomp of their opulent house, and bearing the invincible banner of St. Cuthbert and the shrine of Bede. On Corpus-Christi day, the monks joined with the various guilds and fraternities of the citizens, bearing their banners and lighted torches, and met the Corpus-Christi shrine, belonging to the church of St. Nicholas ; and after divine service in the choir of the cathedral, the whole congregation, clerical and lay, made a procession round the shrine of St. Cuthbert. vol. 11. 5 D"], [398, "CITY OF DURHAM. 376 steps.

There are several monuments and inscriptions in the nave; but most of the more ancient tombs and brasses in the cathedral, which covered the remains of many distinguished prelates ancl other eminent persons, have been swept away by the hands of sacrilege and fanaticism ; and several of those which remain do not now occupy their original places. The principal portion of the south aisle towards the east was anciently appropriated to the Nevilles of Raby. Ralph Lord Neville, who died in 1368, was the first layman buried in the cathedral ; ancl, five years afterwards, the Lady Alice, his wife, was interred by his side, in the nave. John Lord Neville, their son and heir, who died in 1389, and the Lady Matilda Percy his wife (daughter of Hotspur), were buried in the south aisle, into which, in 1416, were removed the bodies of the above Ralph and Alice; ancl at the same time a chantry was founded here for the souls of the family. The Neville chapel was enclosed at each end by a wall, ancl towards the nave by an iron railing. Bishop Neville was buried in it in 1457- The monuments are now placed under two of the arches between this aisle and the nave ; ancl before one of them lies the slab which covered the bishop, bearing the vestiges of its ancient ornaments. The alabaster altar-tombs and their superincumbent figures were reduced to their present mutilated state by the Scottish prisoners after the battle of Dunbar. The tomb of John ancl Matilda Neville was, in 1832, purified from a thick coat of ochre wash; when it was discovered to have been originally gilt and painted with gaudy colours. The arms upon it are those of Neville ancl Percy alternately. The remains of the principal effigies are extended on the tomb ; and the figures in the niches probably represent their issue. One of these, with its back to the spectator, is supposed by some to have been a monk or nun, and by others a child which died in infancy. (See page 202.) Between the pillars on each side of the nave are placed slabs to the memory of some of the Bla kistons of Gibside ; of Thomas Cradock, Esq., who died February 25, 1639; of Gabriel Clarke, D. D., who died in May, 1662 ; of Edward Kirkby, precentor, who died March 18, 1688; ancl of Dulcibella Morton, who died on the eve of St. Matthew, 1688, aged 44, and her son George and daughters Elizabeth ancl Anne.

Each of the aisles is formed by two cylindrical pillars and a clustered one, the former being respectively grooved in a spiral and a zigzag form. They are also enclosed by wooden skreens. The enclosure in the north transept served for a long period as the vestry of the minor canons; but when, in 1796, it was determined to destroy the Galilee, the Consistory Court, which had previously been held in that part of the church, was removed hither ; and a vestry was assigned for the minor capons in another place. The first court was held here April 28, 1797-1\" There are three windows on the east, and one at the end of each aisle. j The great north window of the transept has been already noticed.

Beneath it is the clock, erected by Dean Hunt and the chapter in 1632, ancl which is a very elegant and curious piece of mechanism, exhi biting a view of the planets and their motions, the variations and age of the moon, the day of the month, &c. On December 24, 1808, it was connected with the chimes in the tower. It was for merly surrounded with railing, and its pannelled doors contained a perspective view of the interior of the cathedral.* In the centre of this transept is the great dome or lanthorn, supported on four clustered pillars, and from the floor to the centre of the roof above 160 feet in height. Round the bottom of the dome is a hanging gallery supported on corbels, each intermediate one sculptured with a human figure: the battlement of the gallery is formed in open rose-work. The superstructure is ornamented in pannels with pilasters, terminating in tabernacle work. Between each window is a round pilaster, the capital of which is pierced in flowers and foliage : pilasters of the same order are placed in the angles, and from the eight pilasters spring the groins of the arched roof or vault of the dome, which are braced at intervals, and finished with a circle in the centre, in a light and beautiful style. In the south branch of this transept is the elegant monument of Bishop Barrington, placed there by public subscription in 1833, and which gives full proof of the high taste and feeling of its sculptor, Chantrey. A full-length figure of the prelate, arrayed in his ecclesiastical vestments, is displayed in tlie attitude of prayer. It is in profile, as if turning away from the world and its at tractions. The natural dignity of the countenance is subdued by the solemnity of devotion; and the head is reverentially bowed. The right hand is placed upon the breast, in token of sincerity ; whilst the left leans upon the Bible, typifying the mental support derived from its contents. The drapery is arranged with simplicity and grace, and the execution of the whole is highly finished and elegant. The right, or projecting shoulder, however, seems to fall away rather too much. On the tablet below is the following inscription : \u2014 THIS PUBLIC TRIBUTE IS ERECTED TO THE MEMORY OF SHUTE BARRINGTON THIRTY FIVE YEARS BISHOP OF DURHAM WHO DIED MARCH 25 1826 IN THE 92d YEAR OF HIS AGE AND 57TH OF HIS EPISCOPATE IN HIS WORKS OF PIETY AND MUNIFICENCE HE BEING DEAD YET SPEAKETH. In the north wall of this transept is a mural monument to William Hartwell, S. T. P., prebend, who died June 1, 1725, aged 70. The front of the Choir, which was formerly decorated with effigies of the saints and patrons of the church, with an appropriate inscription in letters of gold to each, is now enclosed with an oaken their knees in the choir during the annual solemnities of Good Friday. The two priors, William and Robert Ebchester, were buried before this altar. The third altar was that of our Lady of Houghall, near which was buried Prior Hemmingburgh. This chapel is now used by the vergers as a depository for the splendid copes and other habiliments used in ancient times. The first chapel on the north side of the choir was dedicated to St. Benedict ; and near it was buried Prior Berrington. St. Gregory's altar was the next ; and the third was the altar of St. Nicholas and St. Giles. Prior Fossour was buried near the latter, stitched up in the hide of an ox, which cost, including the wages of the tailor, 5s. In 1729, the grave was incidentally opened, when the hide was \" tolerably fresh,\" but the body was much decayed. * It is supposed that the clock and the font were removed during the imprisonment of the Scots in 1650."], [401, "CITY OF DURHAM. 379 skreen, curiously carved with human heads and festoons of fruit and flowers. The entrance is by two marble steps; and over the door is a large and fine-toned organ.* The choir is 117 feet in length, and 33 feet in breadth. It has four pillars on each side; two of them clustered, and two round, the latter ornamented with a spiral groove. The double gallery above is formed of circular arches, each of the lower openings divided by a single column. The groined roof is decorated, at the terminating points of the ribs, with ornamented roses, one of which contains a human flo-ure with three round balls in an apron. The eastern extremity of the choir exhibits that style of ar- chitecture prevalent at the period when the original semicircular termination of the church was removed, and finishes with a fine pointed arch. The floor is inlaid with black and white marble. The stalls for the bishop, dean, prebendaries, &c, are said to be of the date of Charles II. , and are finished in a magnificent manner, with rich spires of tabernacle work behind them, forming skreens between the nave and its side-aisles. Below the stalls are seats for the lay singers, alms-house men, and scholars. The pulpit, which originally stood in the middle of the choir, is now affixed to a pillar on the north side : it is finely ornamented, in the Italian style, with inlaid figures, nearly as large as life, representing some of the apostles, and which are so artfully shadowed as to appear like a delicate painting in bronze. Near it is a stall for the bishop's lady, and opposite are stalls for the ladies of the prebendaries. Behind the latter, and occupying the space between two of the pillars, is Bishop HatfelcTs throne, erected by that prelate about the year 1370. It is considerably elevated ; and in the centre is a chair of state, having a canopy of ornamental tabernacle work. Bishop Crewe repaired it in the year 1700; and it was new painted and gilt by Bishop Egerton in 1772. Under the throne is the tomb of the founder, now only visible from the south aisle, and that with difficulty from its elevation. It consists of a large sarcophagus, with a recumbent effio-y, which is thus described by Mr. Carter: \u2014 \"This beautiful statue has fortunately been preserved in a nearly perfect state to this time ; a few of the most prominent parts having only suffered. The bishop is habited in his episcopal dress, richly adorned with sculpture, painting, and gilding, in imitation of embroidery. The outer garment is the chasuble, in its ancient ample form, and much ornamented. On his hands are the episcopal gloves, embroidered on the back ; on his left arm is the maniple. Beneath the chasuble is the linen alb, or surplice ; and under that appears another o-arment or tunic, on which are richly embroidered three shields of arms. On the central shield are the arms of England ; on the two lateral ones the bishop's own coat. The honour of bearing the arms of England in this manner seems a proof of the high estimation in which this magnani mous prelate was held by his sovereign, and perhaps might have been granted to him in conse quence of the distinguished part he bore in the signal battle of Neville's Cross. The feet of the bishop are covered with rich embroidered shoes, and on his head is the mitre, of its ancient low form\" The painting and gilding which adorned this statue are now, however, entirely defaced by a thick coat of light yellow. The altar-skreenf was finished in 1380, ancl cost 800 marks {\u00a3533, 6s. 8d.), of which John Lord Neville contributed 600. The work, having been previously wrought in London, was sent hither * There were anciently three organs belonging to the choir, in addition to that near Jesus' Altar. One, as at present, stood over the skreen, highly ornamented, and used only on feast-days ; in front of which was a desk, from whence the lessons were occasionally read to the people below. Tbe second stood on the north side of the choir, and was used only when the works of Augustine, Ambrose, Gregory, and Jerome were read; and the third, the place of which is not stated, was used during the daily service. + The high altar, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, St. Oswald, and St. Cuthbert, was the \" goodliest in all the church.\" Its decorations were rich and numerous. Curtains of white silk were suspended at each of its vol. 11. 5 E"], [402, "CITY OF DURHAM. 380 bv sea, and erected by seven expert masons, who were almost a year in completing it, during which time they were allowed diet and wages from the convent. It is composed of a species of plaster, called French pierre ; and the design is divided into three stories. The lowest or basement story is solid; but the second ancl third are open, so that the statues which filled the niches, or rather canopies, were seen, though in a back view, from the east side. The light and airy pinnacles, rising in a pyramidal form, tier above tier, in splendid confusion, cannot be too much admired ; though the whole of the skreen has been greatly mutilated at different periods since its erection. On each side of the altar are four seats for the officiating priests, formed of pillars supporting pin nacle work, and of the same materials and design as the skreen.* The floor of the side-aisles is considerably lower than that of the choir. The windows of the soutli aisle are of various periods. Near the base of Bishop Hatfield's tomb, in this aisle, is a por tion of the grave-stone of Emerie de Lomley, prior of the dependent monastery of Lytham, in Lan cashire, who flourished in 1333. The vestry formerly extended along the exterior of the south wall, but is now demolished .\"(\u25a0 A gallery was erected in the north aisle, a few years ago, for the female servants of the College. j The Sacrist's Exchequer, resembling the vestry contiguous to the south aisle, was built by Prior Wessington, but removed long ago. ends ; and the daily ornaments above, and in front, were of red velvet, embroidered with large flowers in gold, and other embellishments. The ornaments for the day of the Assumption were of white dan'ask, set with pearls and precious stones. Above the altar was suspended, by gilt rods of iron fixed in tbe skreen, a splendid canopy, containing a pix of pure gold, over which was spread a covering of lawn, embroidered with gold and red silk, with tassels of gold at its corners. Upon the canopy stood an emblematical pelican of silver, vulning her breast for the sake of her young ones ; and upon the altar itself was laid a book, richly covered with gold and silver, called the Liber Vit\u00e6, containing the names of the benefactors to the church, in order of time, from the very earliest period of its history to the dissolution, all of which were, once a year, gratefully recited during the solemnity of mass. This book is now in the British Museum ; but it has lost its splendid binding. Thirty-four of its first leaves are written in letters of gold and silver, after which there is a gradual falling off in its penmanship. \u2014 Three lamps, suspended by chains of silver, and standing in silver basons, threw a dim but perpetual light, in sunshine and at midnight, upon the altar, \" in token that the house was always watching to God;\" and there was, besides, another lamp, lighted only during the solemnity of mass. At the north end of the altar, a pelican, in gilt brass, with expanded wings, billing the blood front her breast to feed her offspring, served as a lectern or reading desk, from which were read the epistle and gospel for the day. The present desks were the gift of Bishop Cosin. * Bishop Beaumont was buried before the high altar in 1333. In 1575, Bishop Pilkington was interred near the entrance ofthe choir, his remains having been removed from Auckland, where they were previously buried. Bishop James was interred here in 16l7; as was Dean Sudbury in 1684. t In the south aisle was placed the Black Rood of Scotland, already mentioned. X In the east end of this aisle, and extending across it from pillar to pillar, was \" the grandest porch called the Anchorage, having in it a very elegant rood, with the most exquisite pictures of Mary and John, with an altar for a monk to sing daily mass.\" Here dwelt an anchorite, frequently visited by the priors. In 1406, Bishop Skirlaw was buried before the altar of St. Blaze, hence afterwards called Skirlaw's altar. At the west end of this aisle was buried, in 1446, Prior Wessington, who \"devoted his active mind, and time, and means, to the benefit of the fraternity over which he presided, iu ascertaining and vindicating its ri\u00abhts, in repairing the decayed portions of the church and monastic buildings, in erecting new structures, in orna menting tbe windows with painted glass, and in procuring silver plate, and copes, and vestments, and every other requisite for the pageantry of divine service, as it was then performed. The gross amount of money expended during his period for the above purposes extends to \u00a37881, 8s. 3-^d., a very large sum when con verted into the money of the present day. Prior Wessington was also the author of a Treatise on the Origin of the Benedictine Order, preserved in manuscript in the library, and the compiler of much useful informa tion respecting the early history ofthe church of Durham, bound in the same volume. He wrote, also, the inscriptions beneath the portraits on the choir skreen.\" \u2014 Brief Ace. of Durh. Cath."], [403, "CITY OF DURHAM. 381 Immediately behind the altar-skreen, and on a level with the choir, is the chapel called the Feretory, where the gorgeous shrine of St. Cuthbert was anciently situated.* It is 37 feet in length, * The shrine and its ornaments are thus described by an old writer : \u2014 \" His sacred shrine was exalted with most curious workmanship, of fine and costly green marble, all limned and gilt with gold ; having four seats or places convenient underneath the shrine, for tbe pilgrims or lame men, sitting on their knees to lean and rest on, in the time of their devout offerings and fervent prayers to God and holy St. Cuthbert, for his miraculous relief ancl succour ; which being never wanting, made the shrine to be so richly invested, that it was esteemed to be one of tbe most sumptuous monuments in all Englcnd, so great were tbe offerinn*s and jewels bestowed upon it; and no less the miracles that were done by it, even in these latter days. \u2014 At the west end of this shrine of St. Cuthbert was a little altar adjoining to it for mass to be said on, only upon the great and holy feast of St. Cuthbert's day in Lent : at which solemnity the prior and the whole convent did keep open household in the Frater-house, and dined all together on that day, and on no day el_e in the year : and at this feast, and certain other festival days, in time of divine service, they were accustomed to draw up the cover of St. Cuthbert's shrine, being of wainscot, whereunto was fastened unto every corner of the said cover to a loop of iron, a very strong cord, which cords were all fastened together at the end, over the midst of the cover, and a strong rope was fastened unto the loops or binding of the said cords ; which rope did run up and down in a pulley under the vault, over St. Cuthbert's Feretory, for the drawing up of the cover of St. Cuthbert's shrine ; and the said rope was fastened unto a loop of iron, to the north pillar of the Feretory, having six very fine sounding silver bells fasten'd to the said rope ; which, at the drawing up of the cover, made such a goodly sound that it stirred all the people's hearts that were within the church to repair unto it, and to make their prayers to God, and that holy man St. Cuthbert ; and that tbe beholders might see the glory and ornaments thereof. Also the said cover had at every corner, two hoops of iron, made fast to every corner of the said cover, which did run up and down on four round staves of iron, when it was drawing, which were made fast in every corner of the marble stone that St. Cuthbert's coffin did lie upon ; which said cover on the outside was very finely and artificially gilded. And also on either side ofthe said cover were painted four lively images, curiously wrought, and miraculous to all beholders thereof. And on the east end was painted the picture of our Saviour sitting on tbe rainbow to give judgment, very artificially and lively to be- hold ; and on the west end of the said cover was the picture of our Lady, and the picture of Christ on her knee ; and on the height of the said cover from end to end was a most fine brattishing of carved work, cut throughout wdth dragons, fowls, and beasts, most artificially wrought and set forth to the beholders thereof; and tbe inside of tbe said cover was all varnished and coloured with a most fine sanguine colour, that the beholders might see all the glory and ornaments thereof; and at every corner of the said cover there was a lock to lock it down, from opening and drawing it up.\" On each side of the Feretory were splendid almries for depositing the reliques and other offerings to the saint ; \" for great were the gifts and godly devotion of kings, queens, and other estates, at that time, towards God and holy St. Cuthbert in this church.\" Images of saints in alabaster were placed around ; and here were preserved the banners and other trophies taken at tbe battle of Neville's Cross. Miraculous cures are said to have been wrought at this shrine. In the latter end of the 12th century, Thomas, the Norman archbishop of York, came to Durham. For two years he had laboured under a grievous indisposition, and his case had been pronounced desperate by his physicians. In consequence of an admoni tion in a dream, he passed the night at the tomb of St. Cuthbert, and during his sleep saw the saint approach him, who passed bis hand over his limbs, restored him to health, and ordered him to protect the interests of the church of Durham. So late as the reign of Henry VIL, a healing was performed here on one Richard Poell, a courtier. Hegg says, \" Indeed, it seemed the monkes were put to a great shift to mayntayne the saintships of Thomas of Becket and St. Cuthbert, when they pretended such amity between those two saints, that by way of exchange, they that belonged to St. Thomas, must goe and be healed by St. Cuthbert, and they which belonged to St. Cuthbert, must goe to be made whole by St. Thomas ; a small journey for a sick man to take, between Canterbury and Durham ! But the monkes knew well, that some would not bee able to undertake such a pilgrimage, others rather to use the saintship of a phisitian, some againe rather to be content to dye at home, others perhaps to recover by the way, or dye in their journey ; or else to save the credit of their saint, they might take such an order, they should never come thither.\" In a list compiled in 1383, and first printed by Dr. Smith in his edition of Bede, there are mentioned, as contained within the shrine, a pix of crystal containing the milk of St. Mary the Virgin ; manna, from the grave of St. Mary ; a portion of the bread blessed by our Lord ; a piece of the tree under -which the three angels sate with Abraham ; bones of the innocents slain by Herod ; a piece of the desert in which our Saviour fasted forty days ; one of the stones aimed at St. Stephen ; a piece of tbe throne upon which Christ sate with his twelve disciples; a portion of the twelve thrones of the apostles ; three griffin's eggs, &c. &c \" In an"], [404, "CITY OF DURHAM. 382 ancl 26 in width ; and is now used as a depository for the various reliques of antiquity which have from time to time been discovered, or removed from their original places. The plain slab supposed to be the o-rave-stone of St. Cuthbert is in the centre; and there are cavities in the adjoining pave ment, said to have been hollowed out by the feet of pilgrims in ancient times. A wooden skreen surrounds the Feretory on the south, east, and north. The Eastern Transept, or Chapel of the Nine Altars,* sometimes also called the New Work, occupied about 40 years in building. Various \" indulgences\" were granted to those who contri buted either money or labour towards its completion. It measures 134 feet from north to south, ancl 38 feet from east to west, and is entered by gates leading from the side- aisles of the choir, from which several steps descend into this chapel. Besides the windows already described, that to the north is considered very beautiful, as are those to the south, erected by Prior Wessington. Under each tier of windows, a gallery runs the whole length of the transept. The pilasters, from whence rise the groins of the roof, -J- are of an angular projection, light and elegant, and consist of clusters of small circular columns, alternately of black marble and white freestone, belted in two places with a triple roll. The Nine Altars, like tbe other internal parts of the church, had periodically received its coat of wash ; and these pilasters had been subjected to the same sweeping and indis- old manuscript ofa monke of Durham,\" says Hegg, \"I find a catalogue ofthe reliques of this abby, which were soe many, that it seem'd a charnell-bowse of saints bones ; for from hence at the resurrection, St. Ste phen will fetch his tooth, Zachary a leg, Simon an arme, St. Christopher an elbow, St. Lawrence a finger, St. Ambrose some of his haire, St. Ebbe her foote, with many many more ; besides, an whole wardrop of saints apparell, both coats and hoods, and stockens of the apostles, with diverse fractions of the crosse, and the sacred sepulcher.\" In 1255, \" Henry III. beinge in tbeise partes visited St. Cuthbert (as they call it), and, while he was at his devotions, a courtyer wyspered in his eare, that dyvers byshops of his bad hydden much treasure in St. Cuthbert's tombe.

Each walked bare-headed, covered with a linen sheet, and carry ing in his hand a lighted candle of the weight of half a pound. John Robynson, of the same place, performed a similar penance in Finchale abbey. In the same year, Lionel Claxton, gentleman, did penance in the cha pel of Beaurepaire, for a like reason. \u2014 Sykes's Local Records. * The Nine Altars, from whence this transept derives its name, were all, except one, of a double dedica tion. That in tbe centre, beneath the circular window, was dedicated to St. Cuthbert and St. Bede; the next on the south, to St. Thomas a Becket and St. Catherine; the third, to St. John the Baptist and St. Margaret ; and the fourth, to St. Andrew and St. Mary Magdalen. That adjoining the centre one on the north belonged to St. Martin and St. Edmund; tbe second, to St. Peter and St. Paul; tbe third, to St. Aidan and St. Helen; and the last, to St. Michael the Archangel. Each of these altars had its skreen and tester of wainscot, ornamented with branches, flowers, and other imagery work, in paint and gilding; and to some of them was attached an almry in the masonry of the wall, in which were kept their vestments and ornaments. Bread and wine were served daily by the sacrist to tbe officiating monks from an almry or closet adjoining to the south door. A frame of iron work of nine branches, supporting nine cressets or lamps of earthenware, gave light to tbe Nine Altars and the shrine from one end of the year to tbe other, during the hours of darkness. Bishop Bury was interred beneath a richly ornamented marble stone, in front of the altar of St. Andrew and St. Mary Magdalen, on April 21, 1345. At the other extremity of this transept, in front ofthe two last altars, was buried, in 1311, Bishop Beck, the first person interred within the walls of the cathedral. His body, from a reverence to St. Cuthbert, was not carried through the church, but brought into the Nine Altars by a door- way made in its north wall for that purpose, tbe outline of which is still visible. + On June 15, 1829, a young man named William Taylor, a slater, who was assisting in making certain repairs in the roof of the cathedral, fell from a height of 78 feet upon the. flags, in the chapel of the Nine Altars, but received only trifling injury !"], [405, "CITY OF DURHAM. 383 criminating brush of obliteration.

Another tomb-stone belongs to Henry Evans Holder, M. D., of Barbadoes, who died February 22, 1817, aged 36. The Galilee, or St. Mary's Chapel, as has been observed, is at the west end of the cathedral, resting upon a solid rock, which rises nearly to the pavement in the adjoining end of the nave. Its dimensions are 78 feet by 50; and it is divided into five aisles by four rows of pillars, running east and west ; there being three pillars and two pilasters in each range. Each pillar is formed of vol. 11. 5 F"], [406, "CITY OF DURHAM. 384 four small round columns placed together, the base of which is only two feet square. They con sisted originally of but two columns, and the other two were added by Bishop Langley. The pi lasters consist of two round columns, detached from the walls, with ornamented capitals. The arches are circular, and decorated with a zigzag moulding. In the west wall is a singular recess, supposed to have been a vestry. The chapel is lighted by three large windows to the west under elliptic arches, and a smaller one at each extremity under a pointed arch. On the south are four pointed windows, which have been recently renewed. The original entrance was from the north, so that women needed not to come within the gates of the church. This door was closed with masonry in Bishop Langley's time; ancl its external mouldings are now in a state of decay. The o-reat western door-way of the cathedral, which formed a communication with the Galilee, was also closed by the same prelate, and two new entrances opposite the aisles were opened.* The cost of these alterations was .\u00a3471, *^s* 9X The north aisle of the Galilee, separated by a partition wall for the purpose, had been for some time converted into a repository for the wills, &c. belonging to the Consistory Court ; but upon their removal into their present place of custody upon the Palace Green in 1820, the wall was taken away, and the aisle again united to the fabric. After a long period of desecration, the Galilee was fitted up with moveable benches ; and on Easter Sunday, 1828, an evening service during the summer months was commenced. During the present state of the church of St. Oswald, the chapter have permitted the Galilee to be used for divine service by that parish. The burying-place of the Venerable Becle-f- is pointed out in the floor by a slab bear- * In the space within the closed door-way he erected for himself a tomb, beneath which be was eventually buried ; and upon which, for a long period afterwards, was held tbe Consistory Court, referred to by the following inscription above the arch: \u2014 \" Jttdicium Jehov\u0153 est. Domine Deus da servo tuo cor inlclligens ut judicet populn' tint' et discerned inter bonu el malum.\" He also founded a chantry to the honour of tlie blessed Virgin and glorious confessor St. Cuthbert, within the arch-way, for the good of bis soul. Beneath the great west window was an iron pulpit, from whence a monk preached to a congregation, chiefly of fe- males, every Sunday at one o'clock. It will hardly be credited, that, amongst other improvements, it was in contemplation, in 1796, to demolish this chapel, for the purpose of opening a carriage-road to tbe original western entrance of the cathedral ! The lead was taken off the roof; and, but for the opportune interference of Dean Cornwallis, this most unique specimen of the architecture of its time would have been swept away. t The bones of the Venerable Bede were stolen from Jarrow, about the year 1022, by Elfrid the sacrist ; and, after being preserved in the coffin of St. Cuthbert, they were removed in 1370, at the solicitation ofa monk named Richard of Barnard Castle, and deposited in a handsome shrine in the Galilee. At the Refor mation, this shrine was defaced, and the bones were buried in the ground on which it had stood, and co vered by a large stone. In the course of the year 1830, tbe tomb was examined about the surface, and a few abbey pieces and other coins were discovered; when tbe stone was carefully replaced. On May 27 (the day of Bede's anniversary), 1831, the sepulchre was again opened, in the presence of W. S. Gilly, A. M., subdean ; Thomas Gisborne, A. M., residentiary ; James Raine, A. M., librarian ; William Jopling, mason ; Francis Bulmer, George Heron, Ralph Stockley, Robert Carr, and Henry Carr ; and, after finding a few more abbey pieces in their course downwards, the workmen, at tbe depth of about three feet from the level ofthe floor, came in contact with the following human bones, which, though incomplete, had been arranged in their respective places in a coffin of about six feet in length, which was in a very decomposed state: \u2014 > 1. The palvariitm, tolerably perfect, consisting of the os front is and the ossa parietalia ; the former so re markably flat (still more so than that attributed to St. Cuthbert), that a cast was made of it. 2. The ossa temporalia, and portions ofthe bones ofthe basis ofthe skull. 3. The lower jaw, apparently that ofa per son advanced in years, as the teeth were gone, and their cavities had disappeared. 4. A portion of the malar bones. 5. The heads of both the humeri. 6. The radius and ulna of one fore-arm. 7- The os humeri of the other. 8. A portion of the sternum. 9. The thigh bones. 10. Eight bones of the tarsi of the feet. The remainder of the skeleton is supposed to bave been dispersed amongst a number of depositories of relics. In the upper part of the grave, and apparently iu the place which the right hand would have occupied if raised for the benediction, was discovered a massy ring of iron, plated with a thick coat of gold, and containing"], [407, "CITY OF DURHAM. 385 ing the old monkish rhyme, \" Hac sunt in fossa Bed.e venehabilis ossa.\" Many fragments of inscriptions have been replaced.

It was commenced in 1.368 ; but the work proceeded slowly, and it was not finished till 1498; the whole cost being \u00a3838.* The windows were anciently glazed, but are now open : the mullions and tracery were repaired about 60 years ago. In the centre of the quadrangle are the marble basons wherein the monks washed their hands and faces before dinner. These were formerly inclosed in a neat edifice called the Lavatory. The Dormitory, commenced in 1398, oc- cupies the west side of the cloister. Beneath it is the Treasury, in which are preserved the char- ters, yearly account rolls, and other records of the church, from the period of its foundation in 1093; forming an unrivalled collection of antique documents, seals, &c. In this aisle also are the present vestries ; and at its southern end is a large room, used in old times as a common hall, and in which was the only fire to which the monks had access.****- The north aisle of the cloister con tained pews or carrels, each having a desk, at which the monks pursued their studies. A meridian line was carved upon the floor of this aisle in 1829, under the direction of the Rev. John Carr, upon a boss the device ofa cinquefoil, a common ornament at the time ofthe dissolution. It was lined in ternally with one or two folds of thick woollen cloth, as if to tit it to its situation ; but no remains of the hand were there. This ring, with all tbe coins found in the grave, were placed in the library ; and the bones, with a memorial upon parchment of the particulars of the exhumation, were re-interred in a box of oak covered with lead. The upper slab of the tomb was carefully replaced, and upon it was engraved the inscription in the text. * Ten rolls of the annual expenses, from 1408 to 1419, have been preserved, of which the following is a brief abstract : \u2014 The supervisors ofthe work were in succession Thomas Ryall and Sir Hugh Werkeworth the latter evidently an ecclesiastic ; their fee seems to have been 6s. 8d. upon each inspection. The master masons were in their turns Thomas Mapilton and Thomas Hyndley, whose wages were \u00a35, 6s. 8d. per an- num in money, and a garment at Christmas, of the value of 13s. 4d. The ordinary masons worked for 3s. 8d. per week in summer, and 3s. 4d. in winter. Their apprentices and helpers received some of them 2s. 6d. per week ; but many of them were paid at a much lower rate. Quarry-men, 2s. 8d. to 14d. per week. Car- penters, 3s. to 2s. One man had 8s. for carving the arms of the bishop in stone. The timber came from Rainton, Shincliffe, Backstanford-wood, and Bearpark ; and there are likewise mentioned \" Eastland boards,\" or Norway timber, purchased at Newcastle and Hartlepool, and seven loads of \" Kendal boards,\" which must have been of oak. The stone was obtained from a quarry at Westburne, 6s. 8d. being paid for damage, and 9d. per fother for its carriage. Lead cost Od. per stone, and 3s. 4d. per fother was paid for working it into sheets. Iron cost 5d. per stone, and 4d. per stone was charged for fashioning it into nails, work tools, &c. Nicholas Kervour (the carver) received lOs. for making an angel and roses, and 4d. each for 280 \"keys,\" or bosses for the crossings of the beams. Seven shilling were paid for the carving of three angels (which still remain), and twenty \"scuchons,\" or coats of arms. Here were the arms of Bishop Skirlaw, Clifford, Wil- loughby, Bowet archbishop of York, Neville, Spencer, Latimer, Langley, Umfreville, De la Hay, Newark and Wycliffe (Skirlaw's two executors), Greystock, Bertram, Hilton, Scroop of Masham, Dacre, Mowbray, Percy, Maltravers, Lumley, Basset, Eure, Tempest, Ogle, Kyme, Fultborp, Bowes, Hansard, Old Percy, Percy and Lucy, Beauchamp, Heron, Vere, Surtees, Chancellor, Mitford of Molesdon, Widdrington, Elstob, Montboucher, Middleham, the see of Durham, and three other coats. These, with a few others, were re stored in 1828. t At the south-west entrance of the cloister, on Maunday Thursday yearly, were placed as many poor chil dren as there were monks in the convent, each of whom washed, dried, and kissed the feet of one of the children, and then gave him 30 silver pennies, seven dried herrings, three loaves of bread, and a wafer cake."], [408, "CITY OF DURHAM. 386 A.

It was originally the Frater house, or Refectory, in which the prior and convent dined on festivals ; and after the Reformation, it was used as the common hall of the minor canons. Dean Sudbury conceived the idea of appro priating it to its present use ; and the library was speedily built on the old crypt-work beneath.* At the south end of the eastern aisle of the cloister was the prior's house, now the deanery, near which was the ancient registry, and a prison to which the monks were committed for slight offences.-f- The Chapter-house, adjoining the east side of the cloister, when in its original state was without a rival in the kingdom. It was built by Bishop Rufus in the genuine Norman style, and mea sured internally about 80 feet in length by 37 in breadth, the east end being circular. The inte rior was decorated with Norman columns and intersecting arches. Against the eastern wall stood an ancient stone chair of Norman work, in which the bishops of the see had, from the earliest period, been successively installed. The roof was elegantly groined, and the floor rich with in- * The collection of books is extensive. \" The printed volumes,\" says a late writer, \" amount to nearly 8000, and there are nearly 700 MSS. upon various subjects, of 500 of which an elaborate catalogue has been printed by the dean and chapter. The rest are music bequeathed to the library by Mr. Falle, one of the prebendaries, in 1742. The contents in the closet on the left hand, with the exception of one or two gifts in modern times by the late Dr. Wharton, of Old Park, &c, and the purchase a few years ago of a very early copy of the works of Laurence, prior of Durham from 1149 to 1154, of which the library had previously pos sessed merely a transcript, comprise as many of the books of tbe monastic church of Durham as were pre served at the Reformation. Among these are some of a very remote antiquity. There is a copy of the Vulgate N\". T. written before the year 700; another, upon good authority, in the hand-writing of the Vene rable Bede ; a Cassiodorus super Psalterium, transcribed by the same pen ; and there is a Latin Ritual called King Alfred's prayer book, of a still higher date than even the MS. first mentioned. But we suspect that it is misnamed. It contains a Saxon interlineation by Aldred, a monk of Lindisfarne, whose name might easily be confounded with that of Alfred ; and the prefix would then follow as a matter of course. \u2014 Among many brilliantly-illuminated books, there is a magnificent copy ofthe Vulgate in four volumes, given to the monks by Bishop Pudsey, and containing his autograph in every book. These volumes still retain their ori ginal binding, exhibiting externally all the Norman ornaments of the period to which they belong, and in ternally many splendid illuminations. One in particular, an initial in the book of Maccabees, gives a distinct representation, not of one, but of numerous warriors arrayed in the armour and costume of Pudsey 's period ; these are valuable data \u2014 and prefixed to the last volume, that of the New Testament, are illuminations ex hibiting every architectural variety of the Norman arch, and pier, and shaft, and pedestal, during the time of the donor. These specimens of antient art and taste are now safe, for college nurses are not now permit ted to go into the library in wet weather, and cut out illuminations to amuse the children under their care. Such things were ; and this book, in particular, has suffered severely. Other volumes, brilliantly illuminated, have been shamefully despoiled of their decorations. It was Dr. Dobson's nurse (1695-1718) who is said to have been guilty of these abominations. \" The other MSS. are chiefly topographical. Those of Dr. Hunter were purchased by tbe chapter in 1756, for 40 guineas, and those of Randall and Allan in 1823, for \u00a3150. The library is rich in early printed books, and can boast of Caxtons, Wynkyn de Wordes, and of more than one editio princeps of the classical authors. The Roman altars, &c. were found at different periods, in the counties of Durham and Northum berland. The greater part of them belonged to Warburton, the author of the Vallum Romanum. From him they passed to Dr. Hunter, whose widow sold them to the chapter. A cabinet of coins and other cu riosities, collected chiefly during his travels in Greece and the Holy Land, was bequeathed to the chapter in 1724 by Sir George Wheler, of whom the library possesses an excellent original portrait, lately presented by the Rev. C. G. Wheler. In this cabinet is preserved the original matrix in brass of the obverse of the seal used by the convent from the foundation of the cathedral to the dissolution.\" The Rev.

In 1799, however, this building not being con sidered sufficiently \"comfortable,11 the groined roof and the east end were demolished, the monu mental inscriptions were broken to pieces, and a modern room was erected on the scite. A portion of the old decorations, however, which had been covered with plaster in the walls that were left standing, has recently been restored. There are vaults beneath the whole square of the cloister, supported on short columns, and to tally dark. The various aisles form a labyrinth, from whence the return is not easily found ; a me. lancholy recess for religious severity, penitence, or punishment ! It is formed of excellent mason work, and, did it not strike the visitor with horrible ideas of mistaken austerity, is as admirable as many other parts sf the saored edifices. The only entrance is a narrow and low arched way under the library, opening into the deanery kitchen court. -j- The space of ground on the south of the choir, extending to the prior's apartments, was the Cemetery of the priors and monks. The foimer were buried here till 1322, and the latter till the dissolution. Many of the monumental stones and coffins were removed from hence, along with one of the holy water stoups, by the wife of Dean Whittingham, to her house in the Bailey, to serve as pickling troughs, thresholds, and paving stones. Here was anciently a school, in which children were taught to sing. The College is a spacious oblong square, wherein are the deanery and prebendal houses, which may be approached by a passage leading from the cloister. The kitchen, which was anciently that of the monastery, is very curious, being of an octangular form, vaulted with a cupola light, and having the chimney concealed, whence it has been compared to the abbot's kitchen at Glastonbury. \\ * Here were interred the bones of Aidan, the first bisho;> of Lindisfarne, and two or three of his succes sors ; also the remains of Bishops Aldune, Edmund, Eadred, Walcher, Carilepho, Flambard, St. Barbara, Pudsey, Pictavia, Marisco, Farnham, Kirkham, Sticbel (his heart only), Insula, and Kellawe. Here too were buried Priors Turgot and Melsonby. *t Hegg says, \"The subterraneous passages under this church (as in other abbeys) are manie ; but what end these substructions under ground, should have in the makers' intent, whether to conceal their treasures in tyme of invasion, or for worse purposes, 1 cannot determine: one of which cavernes (\"here sometime stood Ethelwold's cross) cover'd with a round stone, leadeth to the castle.\" The cross here alluded to was erected by Bishop Ethelwold near Lindisfarne abbey, and inscribed with his name and other memorials. It was held in such veneration, that after being broken by the Danes in their first descent on this island, the parts were put together by skilful workmen, with lead and cement. It was afterwards carried with the re mains of St. Cuthbert wherever the flying monks wandered with their holy charge, and at last was placed in the Cemetery of Durham cathedral, where it shared the destruction committed by Deans Horn and Whit tingham. The original socket or foot-stone of this cross still lies a few paces to the east of the ruined church of Lindisfarne, and is called the Pelling Stone. Whenever a marriage is solemnized at the church, after the ceremony the bride is to step upon it, and if she cannot stride to the end thereof, it is said the marriage will prove unfortunate. J The roll of expences for building the kitchen has been preserved, and is supposed to be the earliest now in existence connected with the cathedral. It measures 5^ yards in length, by a suitable breadth, and con tains an endorsement, in continuation, 2h yards long. The whole is closely written. The work commenced at Martinmas, 1368, and it was not finished till a year and a half aftei wards. John de Berrington, and after him John de JBillesfield (both monks), superintended the work.

At the east end of the square is the College Gateway, opening into the street called the Bailey. It was built by Prior Castel, on the scite of a former gate; and above it lie renewed St. Helen's cha pel, where mass was celebrated twice a day for the benefit of the laity. After the Reformation, this upper story was for a long time used as the exchequer of the dean and chapter. The pre bendal houses, being partly modern and well built, have a respectable appearance. The whole west side of the square was of old occupied by the Guest Hall of the convent, and its requisite buildings. This was the great place of entertainment and hospitality, at which all ranks and estates of men met with a hearty welcome. A fountain stands at the upper end of the square: it was repaired and beautified in 1791, ancl supplies the neighbouring families with water, which i, brought from Elvet Moor. The Prebends' Walk is a pleasant terrace, situated behind the west end of the College square, and commanding a delightful view of the river Wear and its precipitous banks.* The burying ground, on the north side of the cathedral, has been used for ages. In 1829, the chief part of it was levelled, ancl the rubbish which had accumulated near the walls removed. During the operation many ancient coffin lids of stone were found. One which covered the remains of a child in a stone coffin below, appeared to belong to the Norman period, and was curiously or namented. It was at this time discovered that an effigy near the north door, said to represent a man who leapt from one of the towers for a purse of gold, ancl was killed by the fall, was in reality the effigy of a Lady Lumley who had been buried below. Bishop Matthew, in 1594, granted a licence to John Lord Lumley to remove the bones of his male ancestors from their place of sepul ture, near the north door of the cathedral, to the church of Chester-le-Street. In this burying ground is a mutilated effigy of a very early date, bearing a shield in the shape of a parallelogram 'i besides numerous other ancient grave-stones of an interesting character. Here was interred Dr. Basire, archdeacon of Northumberland and prebendary of Durham in the time of Charles I. and Charles II.; also Christopher Mickleton, Esq., compiler of the MSS. which bear his name, and who died August 26, 1669, aged 56.

The curious stained glass in the win dows, described in that work, is now nearly all removed or destroyed ; which, with the removal of the gorgeous roods, shrines, images, and pictures, so elaborately enumerated by the graphic pen ofthe writer (who must have witnessed what he described), may tempt the antiquary to re-echo the \" Ichabod !\" pronounced by the devotee ofthe ancient faith. It must, however, be acknowledged, that the stupendous architecture of the nave and other parts is displayed to greater advantage by the removal of extraneous objects, which must have injured its primitive magnificence. \u2014 Other authorities consulted are, Hutchinson's History; Allan's \"View of the City of Durham :\" \" A brief Account of Durham Cathedral,\" &c. The last-named work contains a catalogue, compiled by Prior Wessington, ofthe property of various kinds, acquired bythe convent upon tbe death of each bishop of Durham, in succession, from William de Carilepho in 1095. to Cardinal Langley in 1437, all of which was exhibited during mass upon the obit of each prelate respectively.

This tower feh on May 29, 1637, bringing with it a great portion of the west end of the church. The sum of -PI 17. 14s. was raised by subscription towards its repair; but it was not opened for divine service till 1685, in which year it was new stalled. The present tower was built by the parish in 170-2, and refaced after its original plan in 1827- The church is a neat building, consisting of a nave and chancel; the exterior walls being embattled and supported by buttresses. It is lighted bv five lofty ornamented windows on each side,-f- and a window of five compartments under a pointed arch to the east. The ceiling of the nave is neatly stuccoed. A low pointed arch separates the nave and chancel, beneath which is a light wooden skreen, erected by subscription in 1707- There is a gallery at the west end of the church, built in 1741 ; and an organ was placed in it about two years ago. The font is a neat pedestal and bason of marble. The church is warmed by a stove presented by the Rev. W. N. Darnell. The bishop's and archdeacon's visitations are usually held in this church. * This ingenious poet and dramatist was born of parents in humble life, at Mansfield in Nottinghamshire, in 1703. He was apprenticed to a stocking-weaver, but left that laborious employment for menial servitude. Becoming footman to the Hon. Mrs. Lowther, he published by subscription a volume of poems, entitled, \" The Muse in Livery,\" which attracted public favour, less from its intrinsic merit, than from the situation of the author. His next effort was \" The Toy-shop,\" a dramatic satire on the fashionable sullies of the time. Pope was induced to patronize this piece, and through bis influence it was brought upon the stage in 1735. It had so much success, that Dodsley was enabled, by means of his profit as an author, to set up a bookseller's shop in Pail-Mall, which ultimately proved a very prosperous concern. Proceeding in his literary career, he wrote the farce of\" The King and the Miller of Mansfield,\" founded on an old ballad, which succeeded so well that he produced a sequel to it, called \" Sir John Cockle at Court.\" In 1741, he brought out a musical piece, entitled, \" The Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green ;\" and, in 1745, he made an attempt to introduce on the stao-e a new species of pantomime, in \"Rex et Pontifex.\" A loyal masque, in honour of the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, appeared in 1749. His next work was \"Economy of Human Life,' a well-known collec tion of moral maxims. He wrote a tragedy, entitled \" Cleone,\" which had some success on the stage, but possesses no extraordinary merit. A selection of Fables in prose, with an ingenious \" Essay on Fable,\" pre fixed was one of his latest productions. Having acquired a competent fortune by his double occupation of author and bookseller, he retired from business to enjoy the fruit of his exertions.

This church is a small neat structure, situated on the west side of the South Bailey, and consists ofa nave and chancel, separated by a plain circular arch, and without a tower or side-aisles. On the exterior of the chancel wall is an antique carving of our Saviour, seated on a rainbow, his right hand elevated, and the left resting on a book : in the corners are the animals usually appropriated to the Evangelists. This sculpture originally belonged to the church of St. Giles, and is supposed to be of a date not much later than 1200. The east window was erected, by the subscription of three gentlemen, in 1830, ancl represents the arms and badge of the Nevilles in stained class. The rest of the windows (all on the south side) are plain sashes. There is some curious oaken carved work in the chancel, which has lately been ornamented with the armorial bearings of a few of the rectors, and some of the persons who have held property or were buried in the parish. The church was stalled and a vestry built in 1826. There was anciently a chantry in this church, dedicated to St. Catherine, and of the annual value of \u00a35, 7s. 9d.

Church of St. Nicholas. This church occupies the north side of the Market-place. It is a spacious edifice, constructed principally of small stones. The north wall, however, is very strong, and supported by square buttresses. The exterior was repaired and chiselled over in I768, when a large new window was inserted at the west end ; and the tower was again repaired in 1833. It occupies the south-west corner of the church, and beneath it is the principal entrance, which has a groined roof. The south aisle extends from the tower to the eastern extremity of the church, and is separated from the nave by two pointed arches supported by a slender octagonal pillar, and from the chancel by two smaller arches and a light pillar. Between the nave and the north aisle, which runs the whole leno*th of the building, there are three pointed arches, with low octangular pillars; but the chancel is sepa rated from this aisle by two circular arches, supported by a heavy cylindrical pillar and two pilas ters with Norman capitals. Hence the date of this part of the building has been fixed as far back as the time of Bishop Flambard. A low pointed arch separates the nave and chancel. The win dows are all modern sashes. An ancient stone pulpit was removed in 1803. Near the chancel are seats appropriated to the mayor and aldermen, and the Drapers1 Company. At the west end of the church is a gallery, erected in 1721 by Sir John Eden, Bart., now used by the children of the United Blue Coat ancl Sunday Schools, and containing an organ. Another gallery, 34 feet in length, was erected over the north aisle, by voluntary contributions, in 1826. Three slabs in the south aisle bear traces of brass plates ; and on one in the north aisle is an imperfect inscription to one of the Bowes family, and Mrs. Anna Gowland, who died July 1, I747, ao*ed 60.* * This church anciently contained four chantries, viz. St. Mary's, value \u00a34, founded by Huso de Quer ringdon ; St. James's, valued at \u00a35, 18s. 4d., founded by Thomas Cockside and Alice his wise ; the Holy Trinity, of the value of \u00a37, 13s. lOd. ; and Sts. John the Baptist and Evangelist, value \u00a36, 16s. 4d., founded by Thomas Kirkbey, rector of Whitburn. Tbe two chapels on Elvet Bridge were also chantries under this church ; and there was anciently a guild in it, called the Corpus Christi Guild, established by virtue of a licence from Bishop Langley, according to the ancient mode of instituting fraternities of merchants, before any royal charters were granted for that purpose. The procession with the Corpus Christi shrine has been alluded to in the account of the cathedral. In 1546, St. Nicholas' church was visited by the royal commis sioners, Drs. Harvey and Whitby. The former \" called for the said shrine, and when it was brought before him, he trode upon it with his feet, and broke it into pieces, with many ornaments of St. Nicholas5 church.'*"], [415, "CITY OF DURHAM. 393 The cemetery consists of two narrow strips of ground on the south and north of the church The Parochial Register commences in 1540 ; the following are extracts : \u2014 \"January, 1564.

The body of the church consists of a nave and chancel, separated by a pointed arch ; but no side-aisles. The whole underwent considerable repairs, and the windows were renewed, in 1828 ; but much of the original masonry still remains. A free gallery was erected by subscription, at the west end ofthe church, in 1829- A Sunday-school is held in the belfry.

The ruins of a small edifice, called the Magdalen Chapel, are still visible in a garden on the north side of St. Gilesgate. This was a place of worship attached to a small hospital (St. Mary Magdalen's) which stood near it, and in which were maintained six poor men and women. The hospital and chapel were built in 1439, and were under the direction of the almoner of Durham priory. The chapel-yard and the original endowment are enjoyed by the Rev. James Raine, A. M., as librarian of Durham cathedral, to which office they were attached when the chapel fell into decay. There was anciently a chapel on the south side of Claypath, dedicated to St. Thomas the Martyr; but there are now no remains of that edifice to point out its scite. Church of St. Oswald. This church stands in a fine elevated situation, in the centre of a large burial-ground, at the top of Church Street. It was founded and dedicated before the Conquest; but the present fabric can- not claim so high an antiquity. It is a spacious and regular structure, consisting ofa nave, side- aisles, chancel, and western tow-er. On each side of the nave are two octangular and three cylindrical pillars, supporting circular arches. The arches under the tower and over the entrance of the chancel are pointed. In the south wall are four low arches for tombs. The wooden roof is vaulted, and jointed with rose knots ; the rafters being supported on brackets ornamented with cherubs bearing vol. ii. 5 I"], [418, "CITY OF DURHAM. 396 blank shields. On one of the knots is an inscription in a circle, <&VatC JJf 9. 2128 \u2666 <ffattftt, btsr. which fixes its date about 1411. The windows are of various periods. A gallery occupies the west end of the church. At present this edifice is disused, being in a dangerous state, owing, it is be lieved, to the creeping of the coal seams below. The walls, particularly those of the chancel, are shrunk and cracked, and require to be propped both externally and internally ; and the architects who have viewed the church, concur in condemning it. Whether the scite will be secure for a new structure, remains to be investigated. The service for the parish is, in the interim, performed in the Galilee of the cathedral.* Monumental Inscriptions. \u2014 In the floor of the nave are memorials of the Steeles, Watsons, and Davisons ; also one to John Rud, father of Thomas Rud, vicar of this parish, who died June 30, 1720 ; and another to Jacob Clement, who died December 17, 1690, aged 49.

These, however, have gradually decreased ; and only four or five families * By an act passed in the 27th year of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, it was declared high treason for priests made by Roman authority to come over into England, or to remain here ; and no less than thirteen Catholics successively suffered death for their religion in the counties of Durham and Northumberland. The following appalling transactions occurred in the city of Durham : \u2014 Richard Hill, John Hogg, and Richard Holiday, all born in Yorkshire, and Edmund Duke, a native of Kent, were students in the college at Rheims. They were sent upon the English mission in March, 1589 90; and landing in the north, they were, upon a slight suspicion, stopped in a village. Being found, on examination, to be priests, they were committed to Durham gaol, found guilty of high treason under the above act, and hanged and quartered in May, 1590.* John Speed, layman, was executed at Durham on February 4, 1594, for aiding and assisting of priests, whom he used to serve in guiding and conducting from one Catholic house to another. He died with great constancy, and might have saved bis life if he would have conformed to the established church. John Bost, or Boast, was born at Penrith, Cumberland, and educated in one of the English universities, where he took the degree of A. M. Being reconciled to the Catholic church, he went to Rheims, and was sent on the English mission in 1581. He laboured with so much zeal, that wdien one Francis Ecclesfield, an informer, promised the lord president to have two of the gravest priests of tbe north betrayed to him, the latter desired him rather to be sure of Bost. At length, after many narrow escapes, Ecclesfield learned that he was in the house of stir. William Claxton, and went thither himself to confession and communion. Being now sure of his victim, he immediately repaired to Sir William Bowes, and conducted him and others to the house to apprehend stir. Bost. For some time he remained concealed from his enemies; but the informer bidding them pull down the house or burn it, they began to make breaches in the walls, and at length disco vered tlieir prey. He was sent up to London, where he was, for a long time, kept prisoner in tbe Tower, and so frequently and cruelly racked that he was afterwards forced to go crooked upon a staff. At length, he was sent back to the north for trial. When brought to tbe bar, with John Ingram and George Swallowell, he evinced great intrepidity, encouraged the latter to stand firm, and absolved him in tbe presence of his judges. Being sentenced as a traitor, he was drawn to the place of execution, July 24, 1594 ; and there was scarcely turned off the ladder, when be was immediately cut down, so that he stood on bis feet and was but chered alive. At the taking out of bis heart, he spoke aloud thrice, \"Jesus, Jesus, Jesus forgive thee.\" Bishop Matthew, who bad previously known him, is reported to have said, \" It was pity so much worth should have died that day.\" Ingram was executed at Gateshead, and Swallowell at Darlington. (See vol. i. p. 351.) Thomas Pa/asor, or Pallicer, priest, was born at Ellerton-upon- Swale, in tbe parish of Boulton, York- shire, and performed his studies at Rheims and Valladolid. Being sent upon the English mission, he was apprehended in tbe house of Mr. John Yorton (of the family of Norton of Norton-Conyers), in the parish of Lamesley.

About 20 years since, I have been shewn the hole from whence it issued, and the marks of its former channel. This is a constant tradition here.\" The place, however, was called Dryburne long before this execution, as is proved by the above extracts from St. Margaret's register ; also from the following entry (characteristic of the spirit of the times) in St. Oswald's :\u2014 Duke ~\u00bb ( Semyr,aryes~i f were hanged and quartered $\u00a3 I iiii X>X [\u2022 to hyr Magestye -I f D'f\u00ab\u2122e for there Hogge 4 1 Tretors I J J horryble offences the 27 Hoiyday J (. & rebels ) (_ day of May, 1590.

Bo;h husband and wife, who were then Protestants, were present at the execution of the priests above-named, & being much moved at their courage & constancy, were thereupon converted. The gentlewoman's father, wl* j was very rich, & a puri tan, was so exasperated at this, lhat he made his last testament (which is still kept in the archives at Durham), & gave his remaining substance to thc public uses and pretended charities of that city, unless his graceless daughter Grace, as he calls her in his will, should conform : if so, for every time she went to church he ordered one hundred pounds for her, till the whole was paid. The sum which he thus gave away, and which, rather than perform that condition, she chose to forego, was about Z.2500.\"\u2014 The will of Henry Smith is still at Durham, though in a very tattered condition.

The latter person consented to go to church, and was pardoned : but the rest were all executed at Durham, August 9, 1600 ; except Mrs. Norton, who, being supposed with child, was reprieved. During tbe years 1629, 1630, 1631, and 1632, there were in the county of Durham 104 compositions sor recusancy, the annual payments of which were \u00a31165. On March 4, 1633, \" Jo.

Flood, a Roman Catholic priest.\" Bennet Constable, priest, a Benedictine, died in Durham gaol, in the year 1683. In addition to the biographical notices scattered through other parts of this work, tbe following brief sketches of Catholics born in this city or the county, and who wrote or suffered during the sanguinary period above alluded to, may not be uninteresting: \u2014 Robert Warde, a native of this diocese, was admitted probationer fellow of Merton College, Oxon., 1536, and was principal disputant with Bishop Ridley in the divinity school in 1554. A little before the accession of Elizabeth, Mr. Warde (then B. D.) went to Rome, where he died, October 14. 1558. \u2014 William Warde, a priest, ofa Cumberland branch ofthe same family, was executed at Tyburn, July 26, 1641. Luke Kirby was born, according to some authors, in this bishoprick. but others say at Richmond in York- shire. He was received into tbe English college at Douay in 1575. On returning to England in 1580, he was apprehended and sent prisoner to the Tower ; where he and stir. Thomas Cottam, another priest, suffered the torture called the scavenger' s daughter. This engine was a broad iron hoop, consisting of two parts, fas- tened to each other by a hinge. The prisoner was made to kneel on the pavement, and to contract himself into as small a compass as he could. Then the executioner, kneeling on bis shoulders, and having introduced the hoop under his legs, compressed the victim close together, till he was able to fasten the extremities over the small of the back. The time allotted to this kind of torture was an hour and a half, during which it commonly happened that, from excess of compression, the blood started from the nostrils, and sometimes, it is said, from the extremities of the bands and feet. stir. Kirby received sentence of death November 20, 1581, but did not suffer till the 30th of May following ; when, after disputing the justice of bis sentence at the gallows, be was hanged till he was dead. Hugh Taylor, a native of Durham, performed his studies at Rheims, where he was made priest in 1584, and sent upon the English mission. Being apprehended in the following year, he was hanged, drawn, and quartered at York, November 26, 1585. Marmaduke Bowes, a Yorkshire gentleman, was executed at the same time for harbouring stir. Taylor, or, as some say, for having only given him a cup of beer at bis door. Taylor and Bowes were the first victims to the act of 27th Eliz. Edward Burdon, born in the county of Durham, was educated at Trinity College, Oxford, but turned Catholic, aud went to Rheims. Returning to England as a missionary in 1586, he was apprehended, tried for high treason, and executed at York, November 29, 1588. *> William Patenson, or Pattenson, was a native of this bishoprick, an alumnus and priest at Douay college during its residence at Rheims, and sent upon the English mission in 1589- Being apprehended and sen- tenced to die, he was placed in the condemned hole with seven malefactors, six of whom he converted to the Catholic faith. The next day, January 22, 1591-2, he was hanged, cut down, and butchered alive at Tyburn. Thomas Stevenson, a secular priest, came to England from Rheims in 1583. He was apprehended in the course of ten months ; and having undergone various cruelties from hunger, thirst, vermin, and the torture, for 27 days, he was exiled June 21, 1585. He became a Jesuit June 3, 1597; and, after visiting Rome, came again on the English mission, and died March 23, 1624, aged 72- John Lake nby was a native of Shadforth, and was educated at Oxford, until the garrison there was sur- rendered to the parliamentary forces in 1646 ; when he went beyond the sea and turned Catholic. After some time spent at Douay, he returned to England in the time of Cromwell; when he was seized and imprisoned, and afterwards died in great poverty. He was accounted a proficient in Greek, Latin, and ecclesiastical history. Thomas Whitfield, born 1612, became a Catholic at the age of 13, and a Jesuit in 1639. He was 25 years on the English mission, and published \"Reflections on the Signs ofthe true Church of Christ,\" 1655, 8vo. John Fenwick, a Jesuit, whose true name was Caldwell, was a native of the bishoprick of Durham, and born of Protestant parents, who turned him off on his becoming a Catholic. He was educated at St. Omer's, sent to England in 1675, and, being procurator for his brethren, was apprehended soon after the breaking out of the Popish Plot.

Thomas Witham, many years chaplain to the Earl of Shrewsbury, and latterly living in retirement at Durham. A laro-e and commodious house adjoins the chapel, and was built at the same time with it, for the clero-yman. It was used as the episcopal residence of the late bishop of the district.

The present building is in Claypath ; and, though much too laro*e for its regular congregation, it is occasionally filled by persons of other persuasions at public meetings, 8_c.

They had formerly a chapel in Court Lane, Elvet ; which beino* found too small, the present edifice was erected, and opened November 13, 1808, by the Rev. Jabez Bunting, of Sheffield. It is situated in Old Elvet, and is a spacious and convenient buildino*, capable of seating with ease above 1000 hearers. Three preachers are stationed in Dur ham ; the dwelling-house of the superintendant being contiguous to the chapel. The Primitive Methodists opened a chapel a few years ago in Silver Street Lane ; and the Kil hamites, or New Connexion, have recently licensed a room in Old Elvet, formerly used as a Ca tholic chapel. \\ * It was opened on May 31, 1827, and dedicated to St. Cuthbert; on which occasion bigh mass was per formed by the Rev Dr. Smith, bishop of Bolina, and vicar apostolic of the northern district, assisted by the Rev. R. Gillow of Ushaw College, the Rev. Thomas Gillow of North Shields, and others ; and an appropriate sermon was delivered by the Rev. James Wheeler. About 400 persons were present ; and a collection was made in aid of the building, amounting to upwards of \u00a349, which was ultimately increased before the close of the day, by private contributions, to above \u00a390. + The Rev. Edward Walsh, a Jesuit, who officiated as clergyman some years in Durham, and died October 22, 1822, aged 83, was highly respected for his learning and many amiable qualities. He lived on such good terms with tbe cathedral clergy, that he was frequently styled \" the thirteenth prebendary.\" X Other sects have occasionally appeared in Durham, amongst which may be named the followers of Jo hanna Southcott. Mr. James Brown, commonly called the Durham poet, was a distinguished member of this body. He was a native of Scotland, and lived many years in the Side, Newcastle, where he followed the business of a tailor, and attended fairs with ready-made clothes. At this time he was a rigid Buchanite, and used to relate that be and several others fasted 40 days and 40 nights, in imitation of our Saviour. He once owned, however, in confidence, that they softened the rigours of their fast by taking a little boiled water and oatmeal. After the death of his first wife, he married an eccentric old lady iu Durham, who was pos sessed of some property ; and, in consequence, he removed to this city. He always imagined himself (with some truth indeed) a most extraordinary poet ; and many of his effusions at elections, and on other public occasions, were productive of much amusenlent. The last collection which be published (1820) was entitled \" Brown's Poems, on .Military Battles, Naval Victories, and other important Subjects. The most important ever penned in this Age. A Thunderbolt shot from Zion's Bow at Satan's Kingdom.\" The following stanzas from a poem on electioneering may serve as a specimen : \" Rage Hell and Fury \u2014 Lord aid my pen, \" When hills and rocks on reprobates are falling, To lash the Devil in reprobate men\" No help from Messrs.

In \u00b0*eneral, the overseers of the different parishes in Durham discourage the entrance of paupers into the poor- houses, and prefer paying them an out-cess. The North Bailey has no poor-house. A part of an old building adjoining the Town Hall, called the Neiv Place, and in some records the BulFs Head * is appropriated as the work-house of the parish of St. Nicholas, in which at present (February 1834) there are only seven or eight inmates, who are allowed three meat dinners in the week but have no fixed rules as to rotation or quantity of diet. In St. Giles's poor-house there are four in- mates, all of them very old, and whose diet is therefore quite unrestricted. Elvet poor-house is situated in Union Place, an airy row of houses near Church Street, and there are now eight pau pers in it; but the number is fluctuating, and sometimes advances as far as twenty. Here is a regular scale of diet, which is as follows : \u2014 Breakfasts, One pint of hasty pudding and one gill of milk. \u2014 Suppers, One pint of milk or broth with bread. \u2014 Dinners, Sunday, Roast or boiled beef and potatoes. Monday, One pint of broth, with bread and potatoes. Tuesday, Boiled beef and potatoes. Wednesday, Same as Monday. Thursday, Generally boiled beef. Friday, Same as Tuesday. Saturday, Same as Monday. The work-house of St. Margaret's stands in a healthy situation on the new line of road from Framwellgate bridge to the north. The average number of people in it is about 22 or 23 as it receives the poor of the townships of Framwellgate, Crossgate, Broom, the South Bailey, and Brandon in the parish of Brancepeth, who are farmed at 2s. 6d. per week each. The followino* is the rotation of diet : \u2014 Breakfasts, Hasty pudding and milk \u2014 Suppers, Bread and milk, or broth and bread. \u2014 Dinners, Sunday, Beef or mutton, with broth and bread, and potatoes or vegetables. Monday, Broth and bread. Tuesday. Same as Sunday. Wednesday, Same as Monday. Thursday, Stew, with potatoes and bread. Friday, Sheep's liver and bacon, with potatoes. Saturday, Same as Thursday. \u2014 Those who work are allowed flesh dinners every day, and tea in addition to their other meals. The latter article is also allowed to old people. This eccentric individual thought himself divinely inspired ; and, under the idea that he should never die, he once piqued himself on having overreached a person of whom he bad purchased a life annuity. He was very susceptible of flattery ; and various were the letters and eulogies which be received, purporting to have come from the emperors of Morocco and Russia, the king of England, tbe Grand Turk, &c, all which he believed to be genuine ; though they were, in reality, written by his acquaintances. He died in Old Elvet, July 11, 1823, aged 92. His widow, who was also a believer in Johanna Southcott, and often imagined she had visions concerning a future state, died in Gilligate, June 27, 1824. * It was part of the possessions of Charles Earl of Westmoreland, and tradition says was his palace.

The arms of Bishop Langley are placed over the doors of each of the schools ; and on the one at the south end is inscribed, \" Schola pro piano cantu ct arte scribendi ;\" and on the other, \" Schola pro addiscendis rudim : lilerarum.\" These schools are said to have been endowed by Bishop Lang ley with \u00a316, 13s. 4d. per annum out of the manor of Kaverdley in Lancashire, and \u00a32 a year each from the revenues ofthe bishopric. The master of the Grammar School receives \u00a37, 7s- Id. annually (being half of tbe above rent-charge, after deducting the fees), and \u00a32 from the receiver of the bishop. He has also the benefit of the school at the north end of the building, which he lets at \u00a36 a year; but he performs no duty in respect of these emoluments, distinct from his duties as master of the Grammar School (see Education). The school for plain song and writing has long fallen into disuse, and its mastership has become a sinecure, the profits of which are, the remaining moiety of the above rent-charge, the annuity from the bishop's re ceiver, and \u00a310 as the rent ofthe school-bouse. The alms-house founded by Bishop Cosin was endowed by him with a rent-charge of \u00a370 out of lands in Great Chilton. It contains eight separate apartments for sour men and four women. The alms-people are appointed by the bishop from the poor of Durham, except two (one of each sex) who are taken from the parish of Brancepeth. The persons appointed are never under 50 years of age, and are generally much older. When appointed, they are single, widows or widowers ; but, in some instances, their families are admitted by tbe alms-people to live with them.

They regularly attend morning and evening prayers in tbe cathedral. Smith's Charities. \u2014 Henry Smith, by will, July 20, 1598, bequeathed all his coal-mines to the city of Durham, \" that some good trade might be devised for the setting of the youth and other idle persons to work as should be most convenient, whereby some profit might arise to the benefit of the city, and relief of those who were past work, and had lived honestly upon their trades.\" This charity was soon after employed in establishing a cloth manufactory ; but it does not appear to have been properly conducted, and lands and tenements were purchased with the capital, of which the following is the present state : \u2014 1. The New Place, in the parish of St. Nicholas, let to nine tenants, at rents amounting to \u00a382, 10s. per annum, with about \u00a35, 10s. for a place to deposit the market stalls. 2. A copyhold farm at Evenwood, containing 261 a. 1 r. 37p., let at \u00a3220 per annum. 3.

A small estate, called Glake-ball, in the township of Wit ton-Gilbert, let at \u00a327 per annum. 8. The manufactory in the Back Lane, Durham, let on lease in 1824 to Gilbert Henderson, at the yearly rent of \u00a328, 16s. This establishment, which employs about 150 persons, is carried on by John Henderson, son of the lessee. The income from the above rents may be stated at \u00a3464, 16s. per annum, out of which about \u00a3300 is distributed annually, in sums varying from 5s. to 20s., to poor persons of the city and suburbs of Durham.

Callaghan's Charity \u2014 Francis Callaghan, by will, February 7, 1675, devised, out of his premises in the Market-place, Durham, to the churchwardens or overseers of the parish of St. Nicholas, tbe annual sum of 20s., at Christmas, to be by them distributed amongst the most needy people of the said parish ; and to the church- wardens and overseers of the parish of St. Giles, the like sum of 20s. at Christmas, to be by them distributed amongst the most needy persons of that parish ; also, that there should be paid out of the rents of tbe said shops, to the vicar ofthe parish church of St. Nicholas and his successors, 20s. yearly at Christmas, and also to the lecturer or preaching minister of St. Nicholas \u00a34 yearly at Pentecost, on condition that the said lec- turer should preach a sermon yearly in the said church on tlie day on which the testator should happen to be buried there, and give notice thereof by causing the bells of the church to be rung as was usual in case of divine service ; in recompense for which ringing, he directed there should be paid out of tbe profits of the said shops to the bell-ringers 5s. yearly at Pentecost ; and in case tbe said lecturer should at any time neg- lect to preach, he directed that the said legacy of -14 should sor ever cease, as if it had never been given. These payments were disputed a few years ago by the owner of the premises charged ; but, after some liti gation, they are now resumed. Cooper's Charity. \u2014 Thomas Cooper, by will, March 6, 1702, gave a yearly rent-charge of \u00a35, 4s., to be paid half-yearly out of his lands at Fishburn, to the churchwardens of the parish of St Nicholas sor the time being, to be by them laid out in bread, and distributed in the parish church every Sunday, 2s. weekly, amongst the poor people attending divine service.

It is now let by the churchwardens at a good yearly rent of \u00a320, which is carried to tlieir general account. Out-rents The churchwardens of this and the other parishes of Durham are possessed of houses, shops, and small plots of land, the fines and rents from which are carried to the accounts of tbe respective churchwardens. Parish of St. Giles \u2014 Finncy's Charity. \u2014 Jane Finney, by will, November 14, 1728, devised a close in or near Claypath to trustees, to pay the profits thereof to the minister of this parish for the time being, sor distribution amongst the poor. She also gave a house, garth, and garden, sor the support of the charity school of blue-coat boys and girls in Durham. The last-mentioned property was sold in 1799 for \u00a3140, which was invested in the funds for the benefit of the said school. With respect to the close in Claypath, the trustees being long dead, a contract was made, about 1810, by the Rev. Joseph Watkins, then incumbent of this parish, for the sale thereof for \u20ac150 to John Hancock, upon condition that any heir of the trustees might, notwithstanding, resume the property. The purchase-money was never paid, and the purchaser mortgaged tbe property for 2000 years to stir. Watkins, for the purpose of securing the principal with inte rest at five per cent. The yearly sum of \u00a37, 10s. was paid after this transaction, for the use of the poor, as interest ; and tbe lessee or his representatives built on the land, treating it as their own property. As tbe incumbent had no authority to alienate this property, the Commissioners in 1829 recommended that steps should be taken for appointing new trustees, to whom the premises should be conveyed ; and, that, in consi deration of the money which had been laid out in building thereon, a lease for 40 years should be granted at the yearly rent of \u00a37. 10s. These proposals were acceded to. The yearly sum of \u00a37, 10s., which, according to the will of the donor, ought to have been distributed amongst poor persons not receiving parochial relief, has hitherto been paid to a schoolmaster, who for this sum, and the produce of the following charity, teaches 13 children of this parish. Smith's Charity. \u2014 Jane Smith, by will, July 14, 1785, bequeathed to John Tempest, Esq., \u00a360, to be ap plied in such manner as he should think fit for the benefit of the poor boys and girls of the charity-school in Gilligate. In respect of this charity there is a sum of \u00a375 three per cent, consols; and the dividends, amounting to \u00a32, 5s. per annum, are received by the schoolmaster above mentioned. Parishes of St. Mary-le-Bow and St. Mary-the-Less. \u2014 Hutchinson s Charity. \u2014 Barnabas Hut chinson, by will, December 11, 1633, charged his house with 20s. a year for the poor of the North and South Bailey. Nothing has been paid since 1751 ; and as the property has been divided and sold to different par- ties, no claim can be legally established against any of them without identifying the particular house charged. Parish of St. Oswald. \u2014 Cock's Charity. \u2014 The Rev. John Cock, by will, May 27, 1701, bequeathed to trustees the sum of \u00a3600, to purchase freehold lands and tenements, and to pay the proceeds thereof to the minister and churchwardens of this parish, sor distribution yearly in the following manner : \u2014 \u00a32, 10s. sor Bibles, Prayer Books, the Whole Duty of Man, some brief explanation of the Creed, and other books of practical divinity, for the poor inhabitants of the parish ; \u00a35, if there should be occasion, for physic and other necessaries for the sick poor ; \u00a35 for clothes for poor widows, widowers, or housekeepers, and \u00a35 in money ; \u00a34 for teaching the daughters of the poor to read, spin, knit, and sew, and their sons to read, write, and cast accounts ; \u00a36 for \" setting out\" one poor boy, of good character, and able to read, write, cast accounts, and repeat the Church Catechism ; and the surplus, if any, to be applied in furnishing apprentices of tbe parish with work-tools ancl setting them up in business, the sum allowed to each not to exceed 40s. This legacy was applied in the purchase of a farm at Cockerton for \u00a3660, the surplus of which sum has been liquidated out of the rents. It contains 45 a. 2 r. 24 p., and is let at \u00a370 per annum, subject to a deduction of 9s. 6d. for the lord's rent, and Ils. lid. for land-tax.

This sum was lent in 1757, on mortgage ofa house in St. Gilesgate, held on lease of 40 years from the dean and chapter. \u00a32, 10s. per annum, as interest, was paid up to 1824, when the descendants of tbe mortgager ceased paying; and, the lease having expired, there is not much hope of recovering the proceeds of the bequest. Chapelry of St. Margaret. \u2014 Hutchinson' s Charity. \u2014 Alderman John Hutchinson, in 1702, bequeathed 52s. a year, issuing out of two houses in Framwellgate, to be distributed in bread, every Sunday, to 12 poor people attending divine service in the church. Small loaves are provided, and given away as directed. Charities of Andrews and Simon. \u2014 The Rev. John Simon, in 1739, gave \u00a312, 12s. ; and Catherine An- drews, in 1782, bequeathed \u00a3100, to the poor of this chapelry not receiving parochial relief. These sums, in 1784, were laid out in the purchase of \u00a3200 three per cent, consols; and the dividends are divided into three parts, one of which is distributed by the curate to the poor of the chapelry generally, and the other two parts by each of the cbapelwardens of Crossgate and Framwellgate, amongst the poor of their respective districts, in sums varying from ls. to 2s. fid.

Surtees' s Charily. \u2014 Robert Surtees, by will, December 27, 1617, left a rent-charge of 6s. 8d. a year to the poor of this chapelry, out of his lands at Northwart, near Stockwellhugh ; but it has not been paid for the last 50 years. A rent-charge of 5s. a year, left by the same person to the poor ofthe parish of St. Giles, is also lost. Benevolent, Religious, and Literary Institutions. The Infirmary for the Sick and Lame Poor of the County of Durham. \u2014 In 1785, a Dispensary was established in the city of Durham, to which the present Infirmary owes its origin. This spa- cious ancl convenient building is situated in Allergate, where it was erected by voluntary subscrip- tion in 1792 and 1793,* on a piece of ground given by the late Thomas Wilkinson, Esq., of Cox- hoe. It is supported by subscriptions and donations; donors of \u00a340 or upwards, and subscribers of \u00a31, Is. per annum, being constituted trustees, who hold quarterly meetings. A committee of twelve is appointed annually, which meets once a month, to examine the accounts and superintend the conduct and expenses of the house. Every subscriber of one guinea per annum may recom- mend two out-patients, and two such subscribers may jointly recommend one in-patient. Every subscriber of two guineas per annum may recommend one in-patient, or four out-patients, and so in proportion for larger subscriptions. Benefactors of .\u00a310 at one time have the same privileges as subscribers of one guinea per annum; of \u00a320, the same as subscribers of two guineas; and for every additional \u00a310, they obtain proportionate privileges. Townships, parishes, bodies corporate, or societies, for a benefaction of \u00a310, have the same privileges during a period of ten years (exclu- sive of the year of subscription) as a benefactor of \u00a310; and for a subscription of any smaller sum, they have the same rights as private subscribers to the same amount, and may nominate a person to exercise those rights. In cases of sudden accident, or diseases which require the immediate help of a surgeon, the afflicted are admitted at any hour of the day or night, without recommendation; but patients of all other descriptions must obtain a subscriber's recommendatory letter previous to their admission. Two physicians (Drs. Trotter and Cooke) and two surgeons (Messrs. Green and Stoker) attend the Infirmary gratuitously. The Rev.

The Infirmary was opened for the reception of patients on September 17. 1793, when a sermon was preached in the cathedral, and a collection made in aid of tbe funds, which amounted to \u00a354, 6s. 7d- ; after which, the bishop, the dean and prebendaries, the mayor and corporation, Rowland Burdon and George Clavering, Esqrs., the gentlemen of the faculty, the parochial clergy, and others, went in procession to the building. vol. 11. \u2014 46. 5 M"], [430, "CITY OF DURHAM. 408 chinson is the secretary ancl treasurer, Mr. William Porter is the house apothecary, and Mrs. Ann Simpson is the matron.

A Temperance Society has recently been established in Durham, which includes a considerable number of members. The Rev. P. Penson is secretary. Education. The University. \u2014 In 1650, a petition was presented to parliament, from several persons of for tune in the county of Durham, praying for a re-establishment of the courts of justice; and that the college and houses of the dean ancl chapter, then empty ancl going to decay, might be employed for erecting a college, school, or academy, for the benefit of the northern counties, which were so far distant from the universities ; and that part of the lands of the said dean and chapter, near the citv, might be applied by trustees to pious used. The subject of a college engaged the attention of Cromwell, who, in a letter, dated March 11, 1650, calls it \"a matter of great concernment and importnance as that which (by the blessing of God) may much conduce to the promoting of learn ing & piety in these poore rude & ignorant parts, there being also many concurring advantages to this place, as pleasantness & aptness of scituation healthfull aire & plenty of provisions which seeme to favour &: plead for theire desires therein.'\" The subject was again pressed upon the parliament in the following year, by petition from the grand jury at the assizes, January 14, 1651-2, on behalf * This library contains a large and valuable collection of printed books, chiefly in theology, and a few MSS., among which is a coeval, if not the original, MS. of Symeon ; a very early transcript of the Sermons of \u00c6thelred, abbot of Rievaux ; a curious service book, which, before the Reformation, belonged to the church of Hutton Rudby, in Cleveland ; an early copy, upon parchment, of Chaucer, which has never been collated ; and other treasures, the greater part of which was bequeathed to the library, in 1667, hy the Rev.

By a petition to Richard, how- ever, from the provost and fellows of the college at Durham, September 4, 1658, it appears that the scheme of his father (whom they compare to Augustus for restoring peace, to Henry V. for his valour, to Henry VII. for his prudence, and to Edward VI. for his piety) had not been carried into full effect at his death, \" whereon this new erection was left an orphan scarce bound up in its swaddling cloaths;\" and they conclude by \"beseeching the Father of Mercies to make your high ness as heir to all your fathers matchless abilities for war and government, so of his love, zeal and resolution to promote this work which he began in this place ; that by the vital beams of your piteous aspect, it may be cherished and grow, 'till it bear much fruit, for the good and happiness of these parts of the land, in which it was planted by a hand which never miscarried in any of its high and magnanimous atchievements.\" At the Restoration, this new seminary shared the fate of that system of government to which it owed its establishment. The present university of Durham was founded by act of chapter, with the consent of the bishop, on September 28, 1831. In 1832, an act of parliament was obtained to enable the dean and chap ter to appropriate a part of the possessions of their church to the establishment of an university, in connection with their body, \" for the advancement of learning ;\" and it received the royal assent by commission on the 4th of July in that year. Unforeseen circumstances, for a time, prevented this design from being carried into full effect ; and it was not till October 28, 1833, that the university was opened for the reception of students. The government of the institution is, by the act, vested in the dean and chapter ; and the bishop of Durham, for the time being, is ex officio visitor. The following officers were appointed : \u2014 Warden. \u2014 The Ven. Charles Thorp, B. D., Archdeacon of Durham, late Fellow and Tutor of University College, Oxford. * It is a singular fact that George Fox, the founder of the Quakers, has assumed to himself the conse- quence, and what he thought the merit, of having been the means of suppressing this laudable institution. \"We came (in 1657) to Durham,\" says he, \"where was a man come down from London, to set up a college there to make ministers of Christ as they said. I went with some others to reason with the man, and to let him see, that to teach men Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, and the seven arts, which was all but the teachings of the natural man, was not the way for to make them ministers of Christ ; for the languages began at Babel ; and to tbe Greeks, that spake Greek as their mother-tongue, the cross of Christ was but foolishness ; and to the Jews that spake Hebrew as tlieir mother-tongue, Christ was a stumbling- block, and as for the Romans who had the Latin and Italian, they persecuted the Christians ; and Pilate, one of the Romans, set Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, a-top of Christ when he crucified him ; and John the Divine, who preached tbe word that was in the beginning, said that the beast and tbe whore had power over tongues and languages, and they are as waters. Thus I told him he might see the whore and the beast have power over tbe tongues and the many languages which are in Babylon. Now, said I to the man, dost thou think to make ministers of Christ, by tbe natural and confused languages which sprang from Babel, are admired in Babel, and set a-top of Christ by a persecutor ? Oh no ! So the man confessed to many of these things, and when we bad thus discoursed with him, he became very loving and tender, and after be had considered farther of it, he never set up his college.\" vol. ii. 5 N"], [434, "CITY OF DURHAM. 412 Professor of Divinity and Ecclesiastical History. \u2014 The Rev.

A printed prospectus contains the following regulations : \u2014 Students are admitted in any ofthe Terms. \u2014 The age of admission to the Academical Course is from 15 to 21, the candidates being subject to due examination, in order to ascertain their fitness. Beyond this age, students are admitted only by special leave. \u2014 Students of any age are admitted, under limitations, to attend particular classes, without being of the Academical Course, and without Academical privileges. \u2014 Students, under tbe age of 26, are admitted to the Divinity Course, after due enquiry and examination by the Profes sors before the Dean and Chapter.\u2014 Students, beyond the age of 26, are admitted only by special leave. The Academical Course extends to Four Years. \u2014 Nine Terms, or 3 years of residence, are necessary to the B. A. degree, which will only be conferred after examination by the Officers or Fellows, in presence of the Dean and Chapter, at tbe usual Academical period. \u2014 Twelve Terms, or 4 years, must precede the examina tion which closes the Academical Course. The degree of stl. A. will be conferred at the usual Academical standing. \u2014 Fifteen Terms, or 5 years of residence, the study ofthe two last years being under the Divinity Professor, will entitle a student to be examined in Theology; and at this standing the Testamurs of attain ment and character will be given. The degree of B. D. will be conferred at the usual Academical standing. \u2014 Students, with a B.

It is to be' regretted, however, that the time prescribed by the act for the openino* of the establishment did not permit the erection of a suitable edifice. The premises are now fully occu pied ; and further expenses must be incurred for every addition, which the accommodation of the increasing number of students may render necessary. Grammar School. \u2014 There were anciently two schools belonging to the monastery. One was si- tuated in the cloister, where novices were taught, by one of the oldest and most learned of the monks, in a wainscotted hall, opposite the Treasury door; and those students who were thouo*ht deserving were sent to Oxford. The other school was in the Infiimary, without the abbey-o*ates, where tbe boys of the almery were educated. On the extinction of these seminaries at the dissolu- tion, King Henry VIII. appointed commissioners to set out dwelling-houses for the master and usher of the new Grammar School. f During the civil wars, this school was suffered to fall into decay, or according to some, was destroyed by the Scots in 1640. After the Restoration, it was re-founckd by the dean and chapter. The following is the subsequent succession of masters and sub-masters : 1666, Thomas Battersby, master; Samuel Martin and Jobn Nichols, sub-masters. \u2014 Thomas Barkas, mas- ter; William Greggs, William Hanbv, and Nicholas Fewster, sub-masters 1690, Thomas Rud, A.B. master ; Peter Nelson, sub-master. \u2014 1699.

The choristers shall not be limited to that age, but may be admitted scholars if they are fit ; in case they have proved them- selves particularly serviceable to the choir, ancl skilful in music, they are to be preferred before any others.

In 1812, the establishment was remodelled under its present name, and the spacious school-rooms now used were erected on the south side of Claypath. Bishop Barrington subscribed \u00a3309, 17s-, the purchase-money of the scite; and the remaining ex penses were defrayed by voluntary contributions. At present, there are 304 boys and 144 girls instructed at these schools, on Dr. Bell's system of education ; ancl 100 of the children (viz. 50 boys and 50 girls) are also clothed from the funds of the institution.

Poverty, aided perhaps by intemperance, at length overtook him ; and his intellects becoming unsettled, he was placed in a mad-house. In this melancholy state, his ruling passion still manifested itself; and his \" Song to David,\" written partly with charcoal on the walls of his cell, bears a powerful attestation to the strength of his mental powers, even in their derangement- On recovering his liberty, he published translations of Horace, Ph\u00e6drus, &c.

It is supported by subscriptions ancl donations; and its objects are to assist in the formation and building of new schools, and providing them with masters; and also to re-moclel or supply with books those already established. The meetings of tlie society are held at Durham ; ancl the officers are, the bishop of Durham, president ; G. T Fox Esq., treasurer; and the Rev. Thomas Baker, the Rev. T. R.

The subscriptions paid in 1833 amounted to _\u00a3194, 10s. 6d. Tbe total number of grants to schools out of the society's fund, from its commencement up to December, 1833, was 281, amounting to \u00a33254, 2s. 2,.d.

The proceeds are applied, by virtue of an act of parliament passed in 1822, to the support of the schools of the county; and 37 grants, amounting to \u00a31008, 5s. 6d., have been made from time to time, at the recommendation of the committee of this society. The general state of the society's schools, De- cember, 1833, was as follows:\u2014 In Durham, 111 day and Sunday-schools, and 34\"Sunday-schools only ; in Northumberland, 93 day and Sunday-schools, and 28 Sunday-schools only; being a total of 266 schools, in which 19,129 children were educated. Infant Schools. \u2014 In 1824, infant schools were established by subscription in Claypath and New Elvet ; both of which being well attended, a third has since been opened in Allero-ate. Sunday-schools.\u2014 Besides the established Sunday-school mentioned above, about 140 children attend that of the Wesleyan Methodists, and above 60 are taught in that of the New Connexion. The Independents have also a well-attended Sunday-school in their chapel. Other Schools. \u2014 There are in Durham five ladies' boarding and day-schools, one for gentlemen, and about fifteen day-schools; affording, in conjunction with the institutions above described, am ple means for the instruction of youth of all classes.* Public Buildings. The Castle. \u2014 The original edifice belonging to the early Saxon bishops of Durham, upon the scite of the present Castle, was burnt down in 1069, when occupied by Earl Cumin. William the Conqueror commenced the present structure in 1072, for the purpose of awing the inhabitants of the district into submission. The keep, a lofty, ill-formed octagon, of irregular sides, is supposed to have been originally the work of this monarch ; ancl it was afterwards rebuilt by Bishop Hatfield. It became an incumbrance soon after the Reformation, and the bishops were discharged from future * In November, 1802, died at Durham, in the 88th year of his age, stir. Robert Harrison, a profound ma- thematician. He was appointed master of tbe Trinity-school, Newcastle, January 14, 1757, w-here he also took private pupils, of whom, amongst others of great respectability, were the present Earl of Eldon and Lord Stowell. He possessed a most retentive memory, understood Greek and Latin, and had a competent knowledge of the Oriental languages. On resigning the mastership of the Trinity-school, he removed to Durham, where he continued till his death. He was a member of a newspaper or coffee-room in this city, where he sometimes smoked a pipe. This indulgence being prohibited by a general order, he struck his name out of the subscription-list, adding, \" Vanished in smoke.\" He dressed very neat ; wore a dark blue coat without a collar, with a triangular hat ; and carried a cane with a large amber head to it. For some time before his death, he suffered his beard to grow, and lived in a state of strict seclusion. When in Newcastle, he was called Beau Harrison, and in Durham, Philosopher Harrison ; probably from his having, in conjunc- tion with Mr. Isaac Thompson, given lectures on natural and experimental philosophy at Newcastle. He left a very valuable collection of mathematical books. In Nichols' Lit. Anec. vol. viii. p. 326, he is mentioned. vol. 11. 5 O"], [438, "CITY OF DURHAM. 416 dilapidations in Morton's time. Bishop Crewe, however, repaired the shell of this edifice. Tbe upper part, becoming ruinous, and dangerous to the surrounding buildings, was ordered to be taken down by Bishop Thurlow in 1789- Its remains stand upon the top of an artificial circular mount, 44 feet high, and are supposed to be supported by crypt-work beneath. The diameter of the tower itself is 63 feet 6 inches in the widest part, ancl 61 feet in the narrowest. In Leland's time it con tained \" 4 highes of logginges,\" ancl a parapet originally surrounded the summit of the building. The angles are supported by buttresses. Round the mount are three terraces, which command a a beautiful view of the city ancl its environs, and also a considerable extent of the adjacent country. On the erection of Framwellgate bridge, the fortifications were continued from the keep along the brow of the hill, so as to command the passage. This part of the Castle was destroyed by fire in the time of Bishop Pudsey, who rebuilt it about the year 1174. The chapel, now in darkness, belongs to this period ; as does the great original door-way. The latter is ornamented with mouldings ancl decorations the richness of which surpasses description, but which is now in closed bv a gallery erected by Bishop Tunstall. Bishop Hatfield rebuilt the great hall, which incloses the court-yard on the west, ancl which, in its original state, measured 132 feet in length, by 36 in breadth. Bishop Fox, amongst other alterations, curtailed this hall, by converting a portion of its southern end into offices and bed-rooms. A stair-case tower and a new chapel were built by Bishop Tunstall. Nearly \u00a33000 was expended by Bishop Neile on the repairs of the Castle; ancl King Charles I , when entertained here by Bishop Morton, expressed his approbation of the alterations, though Hatfield's hall of state had been thereby further abridged. The Castle, as has been observed, was sold by the parliament to the lord mayor of London in 1649 ; when it was miserably defaced. After the Restoration, Bishop Cosin placed it in a complete state of re pair ; ancl the present decorations and wainscotting of the great hall, ancl the screen at its south end, are his work. Bishop Crewe repaired the north-west turret of the Castle. Bishops Butler and Trevor made great alterations, pulling clown the old tapestry hangings in the dining-room, and substituting some tasteless ornaments in stucco. The present drawing-room was constructed by Bishop Egerton; and Bishop Barrington, in 1791, rebuilt Tunstall's gateway. He also cleared the arch of Pudsey 's great door-way from the numerous coats of white-wash which had, from Tun stall's time down wards, concealed its splendid decorations. He restored the great dining-room to its original use on public occasions; ancl the whole fabric was put into repair, partly during his latter years, ancl partly by the present bishop at the commencement of his episcopacy. The situation of Durham Castle is commanding and beautiful ; and its exterior, particularly the north front, is uncommonly picturesque. The interior, however, is far exceeded in elegance by many places of much less importance. The pannels of the entrance hall are adorned with paintings of the Apostles, ancl a good one of Charles I. In the next apartment is a large Italian painting, \" Cupid in a Forest,\" also some curious representations of the great church of Milan and other structures. The bishop's gallery is adorned with numerous engravings of cathedrals; and some of the rooms are hung with tapestry of a great age.* The ancient fortifications connected with the Castle extended round the whole brow of the hill, and enclosed the ballium, from whence the street called the Bailey derives its name, and in which * The Rev. John Wesley, who visited this Castle in May, 1780, after describing tbe meanness ofthe fur niture at that time, says, \" In the largest chambers the tapestry is quite faded, besides that it is coarse and ill-judged. Take but one instance: in Jacob's Vision you see on the one side, a little paltry ladder, and an angel climbing it. in tbe attitude of a chimney-sweeper : on the other side, Jacob staring at him, from under a large silver-laced hat !\""], [439, "CITY OF DURHAM. 417 many of the houses were anciently held by castle-ward.* There were five gates. The o*reat north gate was rebuilt by Bishop Langley in 1417, alK-- was useu from that time as a gaol. It divided Saddler Street from the North Bailey. This gate was a fine specimen of the architecture of the age, and very strong ; the outward or lower part being defended by a gate and portcullis,-}- within which was a recess constructed with sally-ports ancl galleries for the annoyance of assailants who might force the first gate. The upper part was secured by double gates. From its confined situation, however, in a public part of the city, it was adjudged to be a nuisance, and was accord ingly taken down in 1820, and its scite and materials sold for thc small sum of \u00a3823. Owen-gate, where Queen Street now stands, is conjectured to have been an inner gate. King's-gate commanded the ford over the river into Elvet. Sidgate stood on the scite of the present Dun Cow Lane. The Water-gate, anciently styled La Porte du Bayle, or the Bailey-gate, stood at the southern extre mity of the Bailey, ancl commanded another ford over the river. Bishop Neville, in 1449, \"ranted to Robert Rhodes and his heirs liberty to annex this gate to his mansion-house, with the power of closing and opening the same at his pleasure. It was accordingly closed every night, till the Rev. Henry Egerton, A. M., having purchased the adjacent grounds, widened the street, and promoted the building of a spacious arch, without gates, in the place of the old gateway. This arch now forms the entrance into the city from the New Bridge. Framwellgate Bridge. \u2014 This structure was erected by Bishop Flambard, about the year 1120. It is an excellent piece of masonry, consisting of one pier, and two flat elliptic arches of 90 feet span. In 1760, a large gateway tower, which stood at the city end of the bridge, was taken clown for the convenience of carriages. In July, 1828, the battlements were renewed.* As this brido-e forms the only outlet of the city to the north, it would be a great improvement to widen it, and to * Robert Surtees, of Mainsforth, Esq., F. S. A., was born in the Bailey, April 1, 1779. His father, Ro- bert Surtees, Esq., was the son of Hauxley Surtees, of Newcastle upon Tyne, merchant-adventurer, and nearly related to the family of Surtees of Redworth. During tbe greater part of his life, he devoted the energies of his highly-cultivated mind to the study of the antiquities of his native county, and at length con- ceived the idea of writing its history. The first volume of this splendid work (which Dr. Dibdin, in his Bibliographical Decameron, styles \" a princely folio\") appeared in 1816; the second followed in 1820, and the third in 1822. He did not live, however, to complete the fourth and concluding volume of this great undertaking, which has been some time in the press. He died February 11, 1834, and was interred at Bi- shop-Middleham on the 14th. The funeral was private, and attended only by a few friends ; the coffin being carried to the grave on the shoulders of bis tenantry, to whom his many amiable qualities had endeared him. Mr. Surtees was the author of several poems of no common merit. He has been thus characterised by a lite- rary gentleman of Durham : \u2014 \" Few men have ever enjoyed a larger share of public respect and private af- fection than this estimable and excellent gentleman, whose loss has left a blank in society that will not be readily supplied. It may be truly said of him that be was admired, honoured, and beloved by all who bad the good fortune to be acquainted with bis profound erudition, his elegant and classical mind, his splendid talents as an antiquary, his truly noble character as an English country gentleman, and his native goodness of heart, which was manifested in every action of his life, towards men of every rank, sect, and opinion. He was a man of the most amiable and virtuous habits, \u2014 upright in bis principles, straight-forward in his con duct, generous in his hospitality, unostentatious in his charity, \u2014 his breast was full of 'the milk of human kindness,' \u2014 and he died as be had lived, a devout and exemplary Christian.\" A subscription has been com menced, for the purpose of erecting a public testimony of respect to his memory and of gratitude for his services to the literature of his native county. + On February 11, 1773, some workmen being employed to enlarge the building, were altering tbe top for that purpose, when the portcullis (which was supposed to have been up for above a century) unexpectedly rushed down, and stopped the communication between tbe Bailey and Sadler Street, till the workmen with saws and axes cut it to pieces.

A new road has recently been formed from the bridge to the north, which avoids the old awkward passage through Framwellgate. Elvet Bridge. \u2014 This bridge was built by Bishop Pudsey, about the year 1170; and consists of nine or ten arches, eight of which are open. It was repaired in the time of Bishop Fox, who granted an indulgence to all who should contribute towards defraying the expense. In 1760, a part of the crowded buildings which stood on its north pillars were removed.* A vote having been passed at the quarter sessions, to double the width of the passage of Elvet Bridge, the work was commenced in July, 1804, and the last arch was closed August 4, 1805.f There were anciently two chapels upon this bridge, dedicated respectively to St. James and St. Andrew ; one of which stood on the scite of the old house close to the bridge, now inhabited by Mr. Adamson, veterinary surgeon. The other occupied the scite of the new houses on the south side of the bridge. Tradition mentions another chapel, dedicated to St. Magdalen, from whence, it is said, the Maudlin, or Magdalen-steps, leading from the bridge into Sadler Street, derive their name. On the north side of the bridge is a building, erected in 1632, and formerly used as a house of correction ;\\ but which, after the erection of the new gaol, was sold to the late Stephen Kemble, Esq., and is now the printing ancl publishing office of the Durham Chronicle. Thc New Bridge. \u2014 A bridge for horse and foot passengers was erected in 1574, at the southern extremity of the Bailey. \u00a7 It was swept away by the great flood of 1771- The foundation stone * In September, 1768, tbe floor ofa smith's shop on this bridge sell down, just as he opened the door to enter it, and all his tools fell into the river : the whole fabric soon followed. t The workmen found a noble of Edward VI. amongst the 'masonry of the southernmost pillar. | In this prison, on November 13, 1810, died the celebrated piper, James Allan, a character well known in most parts of the United Kingdom, but particularly in Northumberland. He was born at Rothbury, of Faw or Gipsy parents ; and, on account of his musical proficiency, was admitted into Alnwick Castle, in the capacity of piper to the Duchesso f Northumberland. His irregular conduct, however, soon caused his dis missal ; and he now commenced a most extraordinary career of adventure and vagrancy. His thefts and escapes from prison, his enlistments and desertions, and his amours, have formed materials for volumes. By his own account, he had travelled the whole extent of the continents of Asia and Europe, and had also been in Africa. He was at last capitally convicted of horse-stealing at the Durham assizes in 1803, and received sentence of death, which was afterwards commuted into transportation for life ; but, on account of his age and infirmities, this was never put in execution, and he was still kept in confinement. The first signature of the prince regent (afterwards George IV.), officially addressed to the city of Durham, was a free pardon for Allan ; but, before its arrival, the aged minstrel, worn out with a complication of disorders, bad breathed his last, in the 77th year of his age. Various portraits have been affixed to different editions of his memoirs. Tibbv Allan, his widow, died at Rothburv on March 27, 1830, aged 109 years. On April 20, 181 7, died in this house, where he bad been kept nearly 46 years, a lunatic usually called Dicky, whose real name could never be made out, but was supposed to have been Richard Williamson. He was first discovered in 177L in a complete state of nudity, in an out-building near Newton HaU, then the seat of Thomas Liddell, Esq., who allowed Is. a week towards his maintenance, and which was continued by his successors. It was generally conjectured that he had escaped from some asylum ; but be was never able to tell his name, nor could it ever be discovered where he had come from. He was perfectly harmless, and sometimes repeated parts of tbe service of the church with great propriety. He was supposed, at the time of bis death, to be about 80 years of age. \u2014 Sykcs's Local Records. This building is said to be haunted by the restless sprite of an old piper, who, as the story is, w-as brought down tbe river by a flood, and, on being rescued from the water, became an inmate of the house of correction, where he died a few years after. His bagpipe long continued to be heard here by the credulous at midnight. \u00a7 \" At this bridge,\" says Hutchinson, \" there happened a remarkable accident : A Mr. Dalston of tbe Cothamhall-garth family, forced his horse over the battlements, in the dark, and was killed ; he was passing the bridge on his return from a country visit with a large company, and though in the midst of them, was missed by none till they arrived at the house where he was to lodge.\""], [441, "CITY OF DURHAM. 419 of the present elegant bridge, erected by the dean ancl chapter, was laid with Masonic honours on August 17, 1772 \u2022\u25a0 and uas opened for the public April 11, 1778- It consists of three semicir cular arches, with a balustraded battlement; the designs for it being by Mr. George Nicholson, architect to the dean and chapter. It is situated a little lower down the river than the scite of the old bridge, and adds much to the beauty of the scenery in the adjacent walks. Town Hall. \u2014 The Town Hall, or Tollbooth, stands on the west side of the Market-place, where it was first erected and given to the city by Bishop Tunstall, about the year 1555, with apartments behind it for public festivals. It is not known whether there was a common hall prior to the build ing of this edifice ; but there was a Tollbooth in the middle of the Market-place, where weights and measures were adjusted. In 17-52, George Bowes, Esq., M. P., at an expense of \u00a372, 9s., raised the roof of the council chamber nearly three feet, and had it ornamented ancl painted : it contains large and elegant paintings of Charles II. ancl Bishop Crewe. The large room in front* was taken down and rebuilt in 17-54. The roof is ornamented with a neat cupola, which rises from its centre. Piazza. \u2014 A large market cross-f- was erected in 1617, by Thomas Emmerson, Esq., of London, whose arms were placed on the west side. It had a large pillar in the middle, ornamented with a dial; but becoming ruinous, the corporation ordered it to be taken down in I78O. The materials were employed in erecting a spacious and handsome piazza, on the north or lower side of the square, where the market for corn, provisions, &c. is now held. The pant has been already noticed. The Exchequer, in which the Court of Chancery of the County Palatines is held, was built, about the year 1450, by Bishop Neville, whose arms in the front of it are still visible. It is a strong * Pelty Sessions are held here every Saturday, when two or more of the following magistrates attend for the administration of justice: \u2014 John Ralph Fenwick, Esq., Edward Shipperdson, Esq., John Fawcett, Esq., Thomas Hopper, Esq., George Townsend Fox, Esq., Thomas Greenwell, Esq., and the Rev Edward Davi son, all of Durham; John Pemberton, Esq., Sherburn Hall; William Thomas Greenwell, Esq., Greenwell Ford ; and Anthony Wilkinson, Esq., Coxhoe. \u2014 A Court Leet, View of Frank Pledge, and Court Baron, for the city of Durham and borough of Framwellgate, is held at the Guildhall, before the steward or his de puty, twice a year, a month after Easter and Michaelmas, when all the inhabitants and resiants within the manor are required to attend, and to do tlieir suit and service to the lord of the manor, upon pain of amer ciament. The town-clerk grants the summons for the recovery of debts under 40s. in this court. t Chambre's History of Durham states, that \"a beautiful marble cross, which stood in the upper part of the street of Gillygate, in a place there called the Maid's Arbour, was given to Wm. Wright, of Durham, merchant, at his petition, by Master Ormstrong Scot, Lord of Keepyere, to be set up in Durham Market place; on which occasion the figures ofthe twelve apo3tles, of curious workmanship, in stone, were repaired and sumptuously gilt. At this time, Thos. Spark, elected Suffragan Bishop, by Bishop Tunstall, was Bishop of Berwick, master of Holy Island, and custos and master of Gretham Hospital. At his charge the cross was erected in the Market-place, where an old Toll-booth stood, in which work he expended eight pounds.\" This cross has long since disappeared. X This is an original and independent court, and no appeal can be made from the equity side but to par liament. Like the High Court of Chancery, it has two powers or courts, the one ordinary and the other extraordinary. The former is a common law court, where Scire Facias' to repeal patents granted by tbe bishop, on becoming forfeited, recognizances estreated, &c, are proceeded upon ; and tbe latter is a court of equity,' in which all matters arising within the jurisdiction, relating to, or cognizable by, courts of equity, may be determined: this court has a concurrent jurisdiction in these matters with the High Court of Chancery and Court of Exchequer at Westminster, and has an exclusive jurisdiction in all matters relating to the re venues and rights of the bishop, as count palatine, being the bishop's exchequer. The chancellor, who is appointed by the bishop's patent, or, in the vacancy of the see, by the king, is the judge, and has the custody of the great seal of tbe county palatine, and the sealing of writs in this court, and in the court of pleas at Durham. The proceedings in this court do not differ from those in the High Court of Chancery, except from local circumstances, points of practice, &c. ; and in petitions and motions, in which it follows the Exchequer practice. The bishop also appoints, by his patent, his attorney and his solicitor-general. The solicitors in VOL.

Many of the originals, however, have been destroved. In this building is preserved a chest, the nether surface of the lid of which contains a curious specimen of Durham painting during the reign of Henry VI. The subject is heraldic, and the accompaniments are not devoid of character. *t In 1172, England was divided into six circuits by Henry II., wdio caused justice to be dispensed by iti nerant judges. The last assize held at Durham under the royal commission, previous to the civil wars, was on August 22, 1642, by Sir Robert Heath, Knt. All legal process was afterwards discontinued within tbe county, and no sheriff was appointed, till 1646. The first gaol delivery after this interval was before Mark Shaftoe, Esq., April 12, 1647, when six criminals were executed. John Wasted, of Scorton, Esq., delivered tbe gaol by commission in July, 1648, when nine criminals were executed. The first assize held here after the Restoration was on August 12, 1661, when the judges were entertained by Bishop Cosin at a cost of \u00a3141, 14s. 2d. In consequence of increasing business, spring assizes for the four northern counties were established in 1819 ; and Jonathan Raine, Esq., opened his commission for holding a general gaol delivery at Durham, on the 22d of March in that year. The assizes for the county are now held about the first week in August and tbe last in February. Notices of executions, &c, at Durham, are scattered through the various parish registers above quoted.

The County Court of Durham is held in the Court-house every fortnight, before the sheriff, who, by virtue of the peculiar privileges of the palatinate, presides as sole judge of this court, and all proceedings in it are held before him ; but the county-clerk, a patentee officer appointed by the bishop, issues all tbe processes ; and all pleadings are held in his office at the Exchequer, and he receives for his own use all the profits thereof.

In the interim, however, a marshal or clerk of the markets was appointed, under a statute of 25th Edward III. ; and the several crafts, who exercised their trades within the city, framed restrictions and bye-laws for their own government, which, being confirmed by the bishops, obtained the force of a charter. Bishop Pilkington, January 30, 1565, granted a charter of incorporation to the city, by the name of alderman* and burgesses within the city of Durham and Framwellgate, with several privileges. Tlie alderman was to be elected annually by twelve assistant burgesses (whose office was for life) ancl twelve others appointed for that purpose.

This charter was confirmed by King James I., February 14, 1605, and continued in force till 1684, when it was surrendered to Bishop Crewe, who immediately granted a new charter of incorporation. Some informality having been discovered, however, in the form of surrendering the old charter, the new one was deemed illegal, and the corporation still subsisted under Bishop Matthew's charter until 1768.

John Drake Bainbridge, 1770- For many years, innovations had been practised in the city, by persons not entitled to their free- dom exercising trades within the liberties, ancl apprentices obtaining their freedom by the illicit practices of several of the free companies; and the corporate body, at a public meeting in 1728, made several bye-laws, whereby they imposed a fine on all intruders who should exercise their trades within the city, and ordained that the mayor should hold four guild days in the year, at three of which every person claiming title to his freedom should be called, before he should be ad- mitted. But, notwithstanding these regulations, several efforts were made to evade the ordinances ; and, in 17-56, an experimental freedom was created, to try the validity of the bye-laws, which brought on a legal discussion in the Court of King's Bench, when the bye-laws were confirmed. The arguments used in this trial, however, led to the discovery of a plan for the removal of the bye-laws. This attempt was made in the year I76I,* and threw the whole city into confusion, creating, in the end, such a schism in the corporate body, that, in 1768, the number of members prescribed for carrying into execution the several powers of the charter could not be obtained, and the charter itself became dissolved and obsolete. The city, in consequence, was placed under the government of bailiffs. A petition for a new charter was presented to Bishop Trevor ; but he died before the matter was proceeded in. The petition was renewed to his successor, Bishop Egerton, who granted a new charter, dated October 2, 1780, in which the defects of the old charters were remedied, and the * \"On the 2d of November, 1761, at a meeting of some of the Aldermen and Common Council, at the Toll Booth, the Town Clerk, by their order, in an arbitrary ancl hasty manner, did call over the names of 264 persons, or thereabouts, living in different counties, in order to be admitted freemen ofthe city, though no way entitled thereto ; several wardens of different companies, and freemen, then and there objecting and protesting against the same, but no notice was taken of such objections and protests; and, at the election of a member for the city, in the place of Mr. Lambton, 215 persons so called on the 2d of November, were admitted to poll as freemen of the city.\" \u2014 Mann's MSS. quoted by Hutchinson."], [450, "426 CITY OF DURHAM. powers and privileges of the corporation and citizens confirmed.

All the sons of mercers and drapers are free, but only the eldest son of a freeman of the other companies is free by patrimony ; it does not signify where they are born. Seven years servitude to a freeman of any one of the companies entitles a person to his freedom of the city. The privileges of a freeman consist in voting at elections for representatives ; toll free ; rent of a farm let for \u00a3200 per annum, which yields about 4s. every half year to each resident freeman. \u2014 The Mayor of Durham has no salary, house, or other privilege; his fees of office, on an average, will not amount to more than thirty shillings per annum : his chief business is to manage the markets and charities : the office is merely honorary. \u2014 The Town Clerk has a salary of two gui neas per annum from the corporation ; he is paid for the business he transacts for the city, which may amount upon an average to \u00a340 or \u00a350 per annum ; his fees for swearing in freemen will amount to about 40s. per annum. \u2014 The Recorder has a salary of \u00a34, 4s. per annum. \u2014 The two Serjeants at Mace, for attending meet ings, making proclamations, Sec., have a salary of \u00a32 each per annum, besides stallage, or smaU tolls, usually amounting to about \u00a36 per annum each ; they also get annually a livery, including hat, shoes, stockings, &c. \u2014 The Commissioners under the Durham Paving Act have a right to erect toll-bars and take tolls; they are in debt to the amount of \u00a310,000. \u2014 The whole of the resources, after deducting the bishop's \u00a320, which the corporation of Durham have at their disposal, is \u00a3168 ! which has hitherto been spent in tavern and other trifling expenses.

Parliamentary Representation. The city of Durham was not represented in parliament till the time of the Commonwealth, when Anthony Smith* was its representative in the parliaments of 1654 and 1656. In the last parlia ment of the Commonwealth, neither the city nor county was represented ; but, after the Restora tion, efforts were made to procure an act to enable both to send members, which, though strenuously opposed by Bishop Cosin during his life, was at length carried in 1673. The members for the city were to be elected by the mayor, aldermen, and freemen; but, in consequence of various doubts which arose as to who should issue the writ, no members were returned before 1678. The follow ing list of members for the city is principally compiled from that printed by Sir C. Sharp : \u2014 Charles II. \u2014 March 27, 1678, Sir Ralph Cole, of Brancepeth Castle, Bart., and John Parkhurst, of Catesby, Northamptonshire, Esq.t \u2014 Cole polled 408 ; Parkhurst, 379 ; William Tempest, of Old Durham, Esq., X 319; John Turner, of Kirkleatham, Esq., sometime recorder of Durham, 187; and William Chris- \u2022 Anthony Smith was one of the fraternity of mercers, ancl mayor of Durham in 1657. He voted with those who wished tint the crown and title of King should be offered to Cromwell. He is styled, in various publications of the day, an alderman, master of an hospital, and a registrar of marriages, worth \u00a3200 per annum ; and he appears as a magistrate of the county in 1658. He died March 12, 1682-3, and was buried on the 13th, at St. Nicholas, Durham. + He was steward to Bishop Crewe. Mr. Arden, in a letter to Miles Stapleton, Esq., the bishop's secretary, February 15, 1675-6, London, says, \" Another grett secret I will impart to you. Supposeing my Lord Roscommon should wave standing for Durham, and my Lord recommend Mr. Parkhurst, who has some invitations to stand, pray give me your opinion if you think he may carry it for one, upon my Lord's interest; and pray hint to me in your letter, who you think the fittest persons to make application to and to in gage in effecting this, and who are the forward and leading men among the Comons. You are so knowing in this affair, as you are able to \"ive a great help to the management of this; and it may redound to your advantage, knowing whom you oblige, and it is often seen that the hindmost dogg doth take the hare.\" In the life of Lord Crewe, published in 1790, is an anecdote which shews the extent of conscience allowed to the bishop's steward. \"Mr. Parkhurst voted for the Exclusion Bill. The King told my Lord his steward had voted against him. ' Sire,' says my Lord, ' I'll turn him off to-morrow,'\u2014 aid so he did !\" Mr. Parkhurst represented the county of Northampton in several parliaments, and died May 9, 1731, aged 88. His second son. Dormer, was Temporal Chancellor of the diocese from 1719 to 1761; and his great-grandson, John, is well known as the learned lexicographer.

He presented two petitions against the return of Mr. Parkhurst, which were referred to a committee; but the result does not appear. His expenses at the next election are stated at L239, Us. 5d. He was deeply engaged in the Tory interest, and strongly suspected of being a party to some intrigue in favour of the exiled family ; for n letter from Mr. Cuthbert Bowes to Dr. Adams (prebendary of Durham), dated March 19, 1695, states, \" We have been mightely allarmed about ye late conspertsy and inteended invation.

Mr. Ralph Bcilby, who revived that art in the north, was born here, August 12, 1713, and educated at tbe Grammar School. He was the son of William Beilby, a respectable jeweller and silversmith, who married the daughter of Alderman Bain bridge, and, being unsuccessful in business, removed to Newcastle, where his well-educated sons introduced a taste for the fine arts which forms an epoch in tbe intellectual history of that town. Ralph, having learned to be a silversmith, jeweller, and seal-engraver under his father, became the common resource in several use ful arts and accomplishments, and commenced engraving on copper, which was not then practised in the north of England. In 17*18, Dr. Hutton applied to him to execute the numerous wooden diagrams in his large work on Mensuration. Mr. Hutton bad seen wood engraving executed in London ; and, from his de scription, Mr. Beilby, who was an excellent artist in the making and tempering of tools, contrived what was necessary to cut out the lines and figures wanted. His apprentice, Mr. Thomas Bewick, exhibited an un common aptitude in this kind of engraving ; and, being kindly encouraged by his master, he also invented many new tools, so that all the diagrams for Hutton's five volumes of the Repository were executed with facility and accuracy ; likewise the diagrams for Horsley 's edition of the works of Sir Isaac Newton. In 1777. Mr. Beilby took bis former apprentice into partnership, which connection continued for upwards of 20 years. The former was afterwards engaged in a watch-glass and clock manufactory, but retired from busi ness some years before his death, which occurred January 14, 1817, in the 74th year of his age. Besides his talents as an engraver, he was distinguished for his literary and scientific acquirements. The \" History of Quadrupeds,\" with wood cuts by his partner Bewick, and tbe first volume of \" British Birds,\" with its ele gant preface, are honourable specimens of his skill in composition. He also understood the science of music well, and was one of the first and warmest promoters of the Literary and Philosophical Society, Newcastle. From his integrity, gentleness, and intelligence, he was highly esteemed in the respectable circle of friends in which be moved. \u25a0f From existing fragments, it appears that there was a paper called \" The Durham Courant\" printed in 1735. It is supposed to bave been published by Patrick Sanderson, bookseller, in whose name appeared, in 1767, an account of Durham, compiled by Christopher Hunter, M. D., and containing Davies' Rites and Monuments. In treating on the chronology of the city, Mr. Jacob Bee ought to be mentioned. He was born in 1636, and followed the business ofa skinner and glover. \"Bee's Diary,\" now in the library of the late Robert Surtees, Esq., of Mainsforth, is a very curious collection of local occurrences, stated, indeed, in quaint and homely language, but their authenticity has never been disputed.

It is ordered, that Simon Lackenby is to keep, in lieu of his inter-common ground, one suffi cient bull for the use of the city and borough kyne, for three years next ensuing ; and lo give ten shillings towards a si/ver plate for a course.\" The following sessions order was issued, January 14, 1695 : \u2014 \" It is thought fit and so resolved by the Justices in open Court that from henceforth their wages goe and be employed for and towards the procuring a plate or plates to be run for on Durham Moor. And that it be recommended to Mr. Mayor of Durham, Chairman at this Sessions, to communicate the same to the Bishop of Durham.

The hospital was founded and endowed in 1112, by Bishop Flambard, for a master and brethren ; but, during the devastations committed by the usurper Cumin, it was destroyed by fire. Bishop Pudsey restored the house, and confirmed the endowment, appointing the fraternity to consist of thirteen brethren (six of them to be chaplains) and a master. At the dissolution, its revenues were estimated at \u00a3486, Os. lOd. a year in the whole, and \u00a3167, lid. clear. It was granted by Henry VIII. to Sir William Paget ; and it * Before concluding this account of the city of Durham, it may not be uninteresting to notice a few of those persons, who, from tlieir peculiar habits or eccentricities, have been, in a manner, identified with its localities, and have formed, during their day, living features in its scenery. Of these, Thomas French was one ofthe most remarkable. He was well known in the city by the fictitious title ofthe Duke of Bauble shire, which, on the decline of his understanding, he assumed, and wherein he seemed to have more pride than any peer of the realm adorned with a real one. He wore a star composed of pieces of cloth of different colours, or of painted paper, on the breast of bis spencer, a cockade in his hat, and several brass curtain rings on his fingers. He was so enthusiastically enraptured with his visionary dignity, as to imagine that he had frequent correspondence with the king, on the subject of raising men, carrying on the war, and other impor tant matters of state. He died in the work-house, May 16, 1796, in the 85th year of his age. A biogra phical sketch of this singular character, furnished by Mr. John Sykes, of Newcastle, appeared in Hone's \"Every Dav Book,\" accompanied by a portrait. Mr. A. Fcalonby died at Durham, August 15, 1818. This person, who lived during the greatest part of his life in a state of abject penury, is said to have died worth \u00a320,000. He not unfrequently accepted em ployment on the turnpike, in the breaking of stones, &c. The clothing which he wore up to the time of his death, was so patched that scarcely a particle of the cloth of which it was originally composed could be seen, amongst the shreds and patches which it exhibited. \u2014 Ann. Biog. The figures and countenances of Tommy Sleigh, or Sly, an ideot who used to distinguish himself by carry ing the corporation drum before processions; Thomas Simpson, commonly called \" Gag ;\" Ben Galley, with bis constant exclamation, \" A nip ! a nip !\" Chicken ; an old Methodist lady, always seen with her hymn book in her band; and Hutchinson Alderson, bellman of the city, \u2014 have all been perpetuated by local artists. The last named personage is still living, and in the exercise of his vocation, though now opposed by a rival. He is a native of the city of Durham, and was formerly in the militia, when he lost one of his bands in the following manner : \u2014 A Durham lady, whose husband was in the habit of employing Alderson as a shoemaker, bad a favourite parrot, which, on the cage door being left open, escaped, and was shortly after seen flying from tree to tree in a neighbouring wood. Alderson proceeded with his gun to the spot, where, placing himself within a few yards of tbe bird, he fired at it, having previously poured a little water into tbe muzzle, which he thoughtlessly imagined would bave the effect of bringing down the bird without doing it material injury; but, unhappily, tbe piece exploded, and shattered his right hand so dreadfully that immediate am putation was rendered necessary. Since that time, be has held different little offices in Durham, where his convivial habits and vast fund of anecdote have rendered him an agreeable and humourous companion. His chief claim to distinction, however, rests on other dignities. As a church, which tradition says once existed at Butterby, has long since disappeared, it is a Durham proverb to say of those who have not been at church at all, that they bave attended service at Butterby. About 1823, there appeared in a London paper an ac count of a marriage at this imaginary church, \" by the Rev. Hutchinson Alderson, rector.\" From that time, he began to be designated a clergyman, and was successively dubbed A. M. and D. D. He himself enjoyed the waggery, insisted on the young gentlemen of the city touching their hats to him, and at last assumed the title of\" The Right Reverend Hutchinson Alderson, Lord Bishop of Butterby,\" or \" Hut. But.\" by which distinction he is still known. Several gentlemen of Durham became his prebendaries, &c. ; and he proceeded to give orders, oral and written, respecting the repairs of the church, preaching of sermons, &c Table-book."], [459, "CITY OF DURHAM. 435 afterwards became, by purchase from the Cockburnes, the property of the Heaths. The latter family, in 1658, sold it to Ralph Cole, Esq., whose son, Sir Nicholas Cole, again disposed of it in parcels to the families of Tempest, Carr, ancl Musgrave, whose descendants are yet owners. The only portion of the hospital now standing is the gateway, a strong and not inelegant piece of masonry, with pointed arches. Old Durham is situated about three-quarters of a mile east of the city. Mr. Cade considers it to have been a Roman station ; and others have concluded, from the name, that there was a town here previous to the erection of the present city. It does not appear, however, that either of these conjectures are capable of proof. It anciently belonged to the Booths, and afterwards to the Cock- burnes, lords of Ormstrong, from whom it passed to the Heaths. The heiress of this family inter- married with John Tempest, Esq., M. P. for the county in 1675; and Old Durham is now vested in the Marquis of Londonderry, by his marriage with the heiress of the Tempests. Here is a public house, and some public gardens, the views from which are deservedly celebrated for their beauty. The Maiden's Bower, where a cross anciently stood, is situated near the junction of the Sunderland and Sherburn roads. Peel-law, or Pellaw Wood, is supposed to derive its name from a peel, or fortress, which stood upon a late, or hill, on the bank of the Wear. Elvet. \u2014 On a cliff opposite to Pellaw Wood is a platform called Maiden Castle (by some de rived from the British Mad, beautiful ; and by- others considered as denoting a fortress which has never been conquered), supposed to have been a Roman fortification. The hill, or scar, is nearly perpendicular, and about 100 feet high ; and its crown consists of a large level area or plain. Houghall, an ancient manor-house, erected by Prior Hotoun, and forming part of the prebendal estates of Durham, is situated about one mile south-east of the city. The building has been sur rounded by a moat and other fortifications, and is said to have been in the possession of Sir Arthur Hazelrigg during the civil wars, when it was for some time the residence of Oliver Cromwell. Ignatius Bonomi, Esq., the county architect, has recently erected a picturesque mansion, in the Gothic style, near the extremity of Church Street, and which has been denominated the Rising Sun. \u2014 Mount Oswald, formerly Oswald House, about a mile and a half south from Durham, has been lately rebuilt, and is the residence of Percival Wilkinson, Esq. Farewell Hall, now a pub lic house, was the family residence of the Farnhams. There is a paper-mill at Relly, and a flour mill (formerly a paper-mill) at Stonebridge, near Neville's Cross. Finchale Priory. \u2014 In the time of Higbald, bishop of Lindisfarne, 792, there was a synod held at Finchale,* for the purpose of regulating church discipline and manners; and, according to Leland, another synod was held here in 810; whence it has been inferred that this was a place of some note in the Saxon era. St. Godric, a hermit, directed it is said by a vision, retired to this secluded situation in 1101 or 1107, and erected a chapel and hermitage, where he resided C3 or 66 years.f About the year 1118, the hermitage of Finchale was granted by Bishop Flam- * Anciently written Pincanheal, Wincanhale, Phincanhale, and Fincley ; a difference supposed to have arisen from the similarity between the Saxon letters p p, p w, and pf. t St. Godric was born at Walpole, in Norfolk. His biography is thus given by Hegg: \u2014 \"In his younger age he was a pedlar, and carried his moveable shop from fair to fair upon bis back ; afterward, to make a better fortune, he ventured into Flaunders, Denmark, and Scotland, and in his way thither, used to visit the Holy Island, much delighting to heare the monkes tell wonders of St. Cuthbert ; which soe enflamed his devotion, that he undertooke a pilgrimage to the Holy Sepulchre ; and by the advice of St. Cuthbert in a dreame, repayred againe to the Holy Land, and washing his feete in Jordan, there left his shoes, with a vow to goe barefoot all his life after. At Finchale he built bis cell of thatch, dedicating it to the Virgin Mary, where he lived 63 yeares, in that heate of devotion, that he would stand whole winter-nights praying up to vol. ii. 5 T"], [460, "CITY OF DURHAM. 436 bard to the monastery of Durham, in free alms, subject to Godric's life, who should hold it of them, and after his death, that it might be inhabited by such of their brethren as they should appoint. In 1180, Bishop Pudsey granted a charter for a cell at Finchale; but it does not appear to have been carried into effect till the year 1196, when Henry, the bishop's son, founded a priory for Benedictines, subordinate to the convent at Durham. At its dissolution, 26 Henry VIII., it con sisted of a prior* and eight monks; and its revenues were valued at __?122, 15s. 3d., according to Dugdale, but, in Speed, at \u00a3146, 19s. 2d. It was restored to the church by King Henry's deed of endowment, and is at present appropriated to the support of one of the prebendaries. The ruins of Finchale priory stand in a low and retired situation, around which the Wear forms a beautiful curve, and separates it from the lofty cliffs and hanging woods of Cocken, about 3 miles north from Durham. The church originally consisted of a nave and side-aisles, a chancel, ancl a transept. In 1436, the side-aisles were removed, the four pointed arches which ran along each side of the nave were walled up, and a window was inserted beneath each ; the masonry of these alter ations being of a very inferior description to that of the primitive structure. The western door way is beneath a fine pointed arch, and has been recently laid open to view, after remaining concealed for perhaps two centuries by farm-buildings and ivy. At the intersection of the nave and transept are four massive circular columns, with octagonal capitals, forming a quadrangle of 21 feet. These, as is proved by a view in Stevens' Monasticon, supported a low tower and octa- tbe neck in the river that ran by his cell ; which so angred the devill, that one tyme be stole away his clothes that lay on the bank side ; but spying him, he brought him back with a Pater and an Ave-maria, and forcing tbe devill to be just, against his will, made him restore them, though his apparell was soe coarse, that the devill (the thief) would scarce have worn them ; for bis jerkin was of iron, of which he bad worn out three in the tyme of his hermitage ; a strange coat, whose stuffe bad the iron-monger for the draper, and a smith for the taylour : Neither was bis lodging softer than his coat, who had a stone for his pillow, and the ground for bis b;.d ; but his dyet was as coarse as either ; for to repent both within and without, as his shirt was of sackcloth, soe half the meal that made him bread, was ashes. An angell sometimes played the sexton, and rang his bell to awake him to his Nocturnes, who for want of beads, used to number his prayers with pebble stones. The devill Proteus-like, used to transforme himself into shapes before him, which rather made him sport, than affrighted him, which soe provok'd the devill, that as he sate by his fyre, he gave Goodrick such a box on the care, that had be not recovered himselfe with the sign of the crosse, he had feld him downe. He had the Psalter continually banging on bis little finger, which with use, was ever after crooked. Thus after he had acted all tbe miracles of a legend, be ended his scene in the year 1170, not deserving that honour confer'd upon his cell by the forenamed Bishop Pusar (Pudsey), who told him, he should be seven yeares blind before his death, so that the bishop deferring his repentance till the tyme of his blindness (which Goodrick meant of the eyes of his understanding) dyed unprovided for death.\" Other authorities say, that Godric. besides mixing ashes with the flour for his bread, kept it three or four months before he ventured to eat it, lest it should still be too good. Like St. Anthony, be was often haunted by fiends in various shapes ; sometimes in the form of beautiful damsels, and so was visited by evil concupiscence, which he cured by roll ing himself among thorns and briars. When his body grew ulcerated, he increased the pain by pouring salt into the wounds. By these uncommon penances, and the miracles that he is said to have wrought (amongst which Lambarde says that his \" pilgrimage was profitable to barren women\"), he obtained so much renown that he was admitted into the calendar of saints. * Priors qf Finchale. \u2014 Thomas, sacrist of Durham, first prior. \u2014 Radulpus, t'pe Phil. ep.

In one of the columns is a winding staircase, which led to the upper part of the structure. The transept contains several arched windows and door-ways, some of them closed, and others partially so, by masonry. The extreme wall of the north limb is entirely o-one. The chancel, in its original state, appears to have had side-aisles, each formed by four pointed arches supported by cylindrical columns. The tracery of one of the windows is entire and ex- tremely chaste and elegant. The east wall lias all fallen to decay. In September, 1832 an exca vation was made in the rubbish (in some places eight or nine feet in depth) from one end of the transept to the other; when a part of the original floor was laid bare, as well as the bases of two of the central pillars, the foundations of three altars, the remains of a tomb of the Norman period and several specimens of paving tiles of various colours. From this passage another was made to the high altar, attended with equally interesting results. The remains of the cloisters, refectory, ancl prior's lodging, range along the south side of the church. The area of the cloister-garth is about 24 yards square. The refectory was a handsome apartment, nearly twelve yards in length and eight in breadth, having five windows to the south and four to the north ; ancl an arched door-way still remains entire. Beneath is a spacious vault supported in the centre by four plain octagonal pillars, from which thc groins rise, and extend to the pilasters in the side walls. The ribs are of hewn stone, and the workmanship of the whole vault extremely good. A portion of a similar vault remains a little further to the east. A subterraneous passage is said to have communicated between this place ancl Durham Castle. \" The remains of the priory,\" says Mr. Allan, \" in conjunction with the opposite cliff's of Cocken, rising with amazing grandeur, compose a peculiarly fine and interesting scene. During the sum- mer months, frequent excursions are made to this delightful place, which cannot fail aff'ordino* a bigh gratification to those who love the wild, the grand, and the sublime. No situation could have been found better adapted to monastic seclusion than the spot whereon the ruins are situated ; all around is calm and peaceful, and well calculated to impress the superstitious mind with feelino-sof religious enthusiasm.\" It is said that St. Godric, Henry Pudsey, and several others of note, were buried in this church. About half a mile further down the river is a place called St. Godric's cha pel; but there are no remains of buildings to warrant the appellation. Finchale belongs to the township of Elvet. A farm-house is situated adjacent to the ruins, Township of Framwellgate. \u2014 This township contains eighteen farms. Pity-me and Borough House form a hamlet on the great north road, where there are two public houses. There is a public house at Whitesmocks, and another at Durham Moor Houses, a hamlet li mile north-west of Durham. Crook Hall is situated near the north end of Framwellgate street, This estate was anciently called Sidgate, and derives its present name from a family of Crook who settled here in the time of Edward II., and from whom it passed to the Billinghams. It is now the property of Robert Hopper Williamson, Esq., and the residence of the Rev. James Raine, A. M.* The dean ancl chapter have a yearly payment of 53s. Id. for tithes out of the lands here. Harbourhouse, or Arborhouse, anciently belonged to the Kellaws, who assumed the name of Fossour, subsequently changed to Forcer. The last of the family, Basil Forcer, Esq., died during the last century-. The manor was recently purchased from \u2014 Donald, Esq., by Thomas Fenwick, Esq., banker, of New. castle. A mile north of the city is Dryburn House, the property and residence of William Lloyd * Rector of St. Mary-Ie-Less, and of Meldon, co. Northumberland, and librarian to the dean and chapter. This gentleman is the author of \"Saint Cuthbert,\" 4to. 1827, and of several other learned and elaborate works on the antiquities and history of the county.

This place was one of those resigned by the bishops to the Earls of Northumberland ; but, by Boldon Book, it was held of the bishop by the abbot of Peterborough by agreement and free alms. It afterwards belonged principally to the Boweses till the 5th of Bishop Pilkington, when it was alienated to Anthony Middleton. Having become the property of the Blakistons, it passed from Marmaduke Blakiston, prebendary of the cathedral, in the 7th year of Bishop James, to the family of Liddell of Ravensworth. It now belongs to William Russell, Esq. of Brancepeth Castle. Township of Crossgate. \u2014 This township, in which is situated the fragment of Neville's Cross, contains one farm and three public houses in its environs. Township of Broom. \u2014 This township anciently gave name to a resident family. By Hatfield's Survey, their lands here had become the property of Robert Belford ; and, after passing through the hands of various proprietors, Broom became part of the possessions of the Fossours, or Forcers, 27th Langley. Mr. Robert Cooke now holds considerable property in this township, which con tains five farms. Aldin Grange, or Aldernage, about 2 ; miles west from Durham, occupies a plea sant retired situation, sheltered on the east and north by the banks of the Browney, over which there is an old and narrow stone bridge.* Great improvements have been made in the houses and grounds by the present proprietor, Francis Brashaw Taylor, Esq., who has also recently purchased from the Tempests a house called Broom Hall. Anton Style, or Aldin Style, is a small village, 3 miles west from Durham, containing a public house and a cartwright's shop. There is a paper-mill at Moorsley Banks. Township of Sunderland Bridge. \u2014 The manor of Sunderland, or Sunderland-by-the-Bridge, anciently' belonged to William de Kilkenny, and a moiety of it afterwards passed to the Nevilles, and from them to the Hotons. The Salvins have long been the principal proprietors here. The village of Sutideiland Bridge is pleasantly situated on the ridge of a steep hill, on the south side of the Wear, and between that river and Croxdale water, 3_j miles south-by-west from Durham. It contains a public house, two schools, a smith's shop, and some other tradesmen. A large and pleasant mansion, a little to the east, with an excellent garden and orchard, and about seven acres of land, is the residence of the Rev. Thomas Smith, minister of the Catholic chapel at Croxdale. The bridge over the Wear consists of four arches. It was partly rebuilt in 1769- Some antiqua ries have supposed this place the scite of a Roman or Danish camp. * There is a tradition in this neighbourhood, that King David Bruce, after the battle of Neville's Cross, concealed himself under this bridge, where he was discovered by his shadow on the water. The concurrent testimony of all the historians who bave described the battle, however, and the circumstantial accounts given of the personal bravery of David, are totally at variance with this vague tradition. + This place was the residence of Jobn Bedford, Esq., M. D., in his latter years, and where he lived remarkably recluse till his death in 1776- He was the third son of Hiikiah Bedford, a Nonjuring clergy man, who, in 1714, was sentenced to be imprisoned three years and pay a fine of 1000 marks for publishing a book entitled \" The Hereditary Right of the Crown of England asserted,\" said to have been really written by tbe Rev. George Harbin. Tbe Earl of Weymouth, ignorant of the real author, sent a present of \u00a3100, by the hands of Harbin, to Bedford, on account of his sufferings, stir. Bedford wrote in Latin a life of Dr. Barwick, which he afterwards translated into English; also, from the French, \"An Answer to Fontenelle's History of Oracles.\" He died in 1724. William, bis eldest son, was a physician, and died 1747- Thomas, his second son, was educated at Cambridge, and became the minister of a congregation of Nonjurors at Comp ton in Derbyshire, where he died in 1773.

Prior to the year 1*74, it was the property of the Salvins, and has ever since continued in their possession.* William Thomas Salvin, Esq., is the present representative of the family. Croxdale Hall occupies an elevated situation near the banks of the Wear, about 3 miles south of Durham, and commands a rich prospect towards the south-west. The pleasure-o-rounds, with the adjacent woods and plantations, are laid out with great taste. Round their western extremity flows a small rivulet, the channel of which is a romantic dell, so deep and narrow that the sun's rays are excluded nearly throughout the year ; and this circumstance, in ancient times, gave rise to the idea that it was the abode of evil spirits, which probably gained credit from its beino- the resort of rob bers and other lawless persons. To banish the infernal inhabitants, a cross was erected ; and Croir dale became the name of the adjacent lands. Several pleasing views may be obtained from Croxdale Scar, a neighbouring cliff.

A Catholic chapel, attached to the hall, was erected by the late Mr. Salvin, for the use of persons of that religion in the district, and finished and beautified in a superior style of Gothic architecture by the present proprietor. The altar-piece is much admired. The number of communicants is about 180 ; and the tolling of the bell at the chapel of the Establishment answers the double pur pose of calling the Protestant and the Catholic to worship their God. Butterby (anciently Bcautrove, from its beauty) is an ancient manor, pleasantly situated on a peninsula formed by the Wear, about 2 miles south of Durham. It was formerly part of the pos sessions of the Lumleys, and is supposed to have formed a marriage portion with Margaret, daugh ter of Ralph Lumley, who married Sir John Clervaux, of Croft. Elizabeth, their daughter, became sole heiress and representative of the Clervaux family, and married Christopher Chaytor, Esq.

Butterby was sold, by authority of an act of parlia ment, in 1695, to the Doubledays, sometime of Jarrow, from whom it passed by purchase to Mr. Ward of Sedgefield, and has since become the property of W. T. Salvin, Esq., of Croxdale. It is a constablery of itself, free from all tithes, and paying a prescript rent of \u00a31, 13s. 4d. to the cu rate of Croxdale at Midsummer. The manor-house stands in a low ancl recluse situation near the river Wear, and is surrounded by a moat, which, though now dry, might easily be filled with water. Hutchinson mentions a coat of mail, with other armour, in a large stone trough, which were discovered some years ago in clean ing the moat. An ancient hospital, dedicated to St. Leonard, is supposed to have stood in an ad joining field, where many stone coffins and holy water basons have been dug up. The grounds near the house are remarkably fertile ; and there is not a sweeter rural scene in the whole country. A paper-mill at Butterby was blown down by a high wind in 1815, but has been since rebuilt. A considerable salt spring flows from the fissure of a rock in the bed of the river Wear at this place, about 40 feet from the shore; but owing to its being subject to a mixture of fresh water, it is difficult to ascertain the quantity of salt which it contains in its purest state. The water is re puted to be an effectual cure for diseases caused by the deleterious fumes arising in the smelting ancl refining houses belonging to the lead works. In a small rift, or dell, nearly opposite the salt spring, is a sulphureous spring ,- and through a fissure in the neighbouring rock issues a spring of fresh water, both of which were discovered by some workmen employed in boring for coal, at the depth of 12;} fathoms. A great number of persons frequent these wells, as the waters possess considerable medicinal powers. By an analysis made by W. R. Clanny, M. D., of Sunderland, a wine gallon of the sulphureous water contains the following gaseous and solid substances : \u2014 Carbonic acid gas 8* cubic inches. Muriate of soda 565 grains.

The township contains six farms, and a village, f 2 miles south-east from Durham, where there are a school, a corn-mill, and three public houses. It is nearly surrounded by a large public garden. A chapel of ease, with a burial-ground attached, was built and endowed in 1826 by the dean and chapter. The living is a perpetual curacy, in the patronage of the vicar of St. Oswald's ; and the Rev. Isaac Todd is the incumbent. Here is a stone bridge of three arches over the Wear, erected by Bishop Skirlaw in the place of one then gone to decay. It was re-edified in 1617, but was car ried away by a flood, February 7, 1752. It was restored the following summer. Near the village is the pleasant seat of John Prince, Esq., called Shincliffe Hall. * Burke's History ofthe Commons, vol. ii. page 141. t It is said that Bishop Sever was born at Shincliffe ; also Sir Richard Empson, \" the o*reat favourite of K.

They bear the distinctive appellations of Bed- j^lL^P^ll^f lingtonshire, Islandshire, and Norhamshire, and have hitherto been generally in- A^]00^jj^\\ eluded in descriptions of the county of Northumberland.* Their dependence on \\bv&^____A(&<2) the county of Durham is, indeed, gradually expiring; for, by the Boundary Act, 2 & 3 Will. IV. c. 64, they are annexed, in the election of members of parliament, to the Northern Division of Northumberland ; and a bill is now (April, 1834) in preparation for disunitino- them altogether from Durham, and attaching them to Berwick-upon-Tweed.-f- Bedlingtonshire, or Bedlington Parish. \u2014 About the beginning of the 10th century, Cutheard, the second bishop of Chester, purchased this district out of the funds of St. Cuthbert, and wave it to the see. It was sold, in 1659, to Robert Fenwick, Esq., for \u00a3\"1296; but, on the Restoration, it was again given up to the church, and is as yet included in the East Division of Chester Ward. It is bounded on the east by the German Ocean, and on the north and south by the rivers Wansbeck and Blyth, and contains 191,000 acres, or about 30 square miles. It is divided into the following townships: \u2014 Bedlington, Cambois and North Blyth, Choppington, Netherton, and East and West Sleekburn. The population, in 1821, was 1862, inhabiting 292 houses; and the annual value of property assessed to the county-rate, in the year 1828-9, was \u00a39877- The Bedlington Iron Works have long been carried on extensively by various firms. Islandshire and Norhamshire were granted by King Oswald to the first Christian bishop in his dominions; and the donation was confirmed by several succeeding monarchs, including Alfred the Great, and his dependent, Guthred, king of Northumberland. They occupy a triangular area of about 7*2 square miles, at the northern extremity of that county, and are bounded on the north-east by the sea, on the north-west by the Tweed, and on the south by Bambrough and Glendale Wards. Islandshire contains the parish of Holy Islands the three parochial chapelries of Ancroft, Kyloe, * See the respective works of Hutchinson, Mackenzie, &c. t It is not easy to conjecture why this place has been chosen in preference to the county of Northumber land, in which the districts alluded to would have been more naturally included. As far as relates to Bed lingtonshire at least, the existing inconveniences will be only removed, literally speaking, and not abolished. X This island lies in the German Ocean, 1| mile from the main land. By the ancient Britons it was called Inis Medicante, also Lindisfarne, the latter a compound of Lindis, the name of a river which runs into the sea from the opposite land, and the Celtic word Fahren, a recess ; but, on account of its religious appropria- tion, it was subsequently called Holy Island. At low water, the sands between it and tbe main land are left nearly dry. Exclusive of a narrow spit of land which extends about a mile in length to the west-north-west, the island is about 6 miles in circumference, and contains about 1000 acres of land, half of which on tbe north side consists chiefly of barren soil and sand-hills. There is a lake of 7 acres in extent on the north-west cor- ner, and some curious caves on tbe west. The south-east corner of the island is terminated by an almost perpendicular rock of a conical figure, which rises to the height of 60 feet, and is crowned with a small fort or castle. The antique ruins of the abbey and cathedral church, though they have been frequently plundered for the erection of houses in the village, are still magnificent, and are now kept from further decay by their proprietor, H. C. Selby, Esq., of Swansfield, near Alnwick. The length ofthe church is about 138 feet, ancl"], [468, "NORTH DURHAM. 442 and Tweedmouth, and the townships of Elwick and Ross, which belong to the ecclesiastical juris diction of Belford parish, in Northumberland. In 1821, these contained 1347 houses and 7856 in habitants ; and the assessed annual value of property, in 1828-9, was \u00a332,326. Norhamshire consists merely of the extensive parish of Norham, which contains the chapelry of Cornhill, and the townships of Duddo, Felkington, Grindon, Horncliffe, Horncliff'e Loan End, Longridge, Nor ham,* Norham Mains, Shoreswood, Thornton, and Twizell. The whole, in 1821, contained 3906 persons, inhabiting *J25 houses ; and the annual value of property assessed to the county rate, in 1828-9, was \u00a321,045. its breadth 36 feet ; and the style of architecture resembles, in a great degree, that of Durham cathedral. After the desertion of this place by the monks, the original monastery was destroyed ; but a cell of Benedic tines, subordinate to Durham priory, was subsequently established, the annual revenues of which at the dis solution are stated in Dugdale at \u00a348, 18s. lid., and in Speed at \u00a360, 5s. The parish church stands within a few yards of the ruins. The Farn Islands \" form two groups of little islands or rocks, to the number of seventeen ; but, at low water, the points of several others appear above the surface ; they are all distinguished by particular names.\" The House Island is distant 1 mile and 68 chains from the coast, and is the largest of the group, memorable as the place where St. Cuthbert passed the last years of his life, and as the retirement of Ethelwold, St. Bar tholomew, and Priors Thomas and Melsonby. A Benedictine priory was established here ; and the remains of a church and some other buildings are still to be seen, together with a stone coffin, in which, it is said, the holy St. Cuthbert was first interred. The revenues of the priory were valued, at the dissolution, at \u00a312, 17s. 8d. per annum. There is a light-house upon this island, and another upon that called the Staples, 3 miles further east. The Meg-rock, the Pinnacles, the Plough, and the Goldstone, are the names of other islets, the most distant of the group being 7 or 8 miles from tbe coast. \" Some of them yield a little grass, and serve to feed a cow or two, which the people are desperate enough to transport over in their little boats.\" \u2014 Pennant, View of Northumberland, fye. * Norham Castle is situated on the top of a bigh steep rock, on the south bank of the Tweed. Bishop Pudsey built the great tower, which is still to be seen, and is 70 feet high, consisting of four stories. To wards the river, the ruins now hang upon the verge of the precipice, and have been parti}- washed away by the encroachments of the stream. The wall, stretching from the Tweed on the south side, was guarded with a strong tower gateway. The passage bending towards the east, through the wall, was very steep, and guarded by another large gateway, strengthened by two heavy round flanking towers, and a wide moat, which extended round the castle on the land side, enclosing a spacious area, fortified by a strong wall, garnished with demi-bastions, to defend the keep or main tower, the vaults or prisons of which are yet entire. The whole is constructed of soft red freestone, and has a very gloomy appearance. In 1138, after a gallant defence, the town and castle of Norham were taken and destroyed by King Da vid I. of Scotland, but were restored again by Bishop Pudsey in 1154. The pusillanimous King John was several times at Norham, in treaty with the Scots; and, in 1215, he besieged tbe castle, in consequence of the Northumbrian barons having paid homage to Alexander II. of Scotland, but in 40 days he was obliged to raise the siege. The ambitious Edward I., in 1292, met the Scottish nobles in Norham Castle, and, in order to decide the contest for the vacant crown of Scotland, requested them to acknowledge him as Lord Para mount of all Scotland, which, after some deliberation, was agreed to, and judgment was pronounced in favour of John Baliol, who swore fealty to Edward in the castle of Norham, before many nobles of both nations. In 1318, Norham was besieged by the Scots, but was so ably defended by its governor, Sir Thomas Grey, and the Lords Percy and Neville, that it was preserved from the hands of tbe enemy. In 1322, however, they gained possession of the fortress, but retained it only for a short period, being compelled to abandon it by King Edward, after an assault of ten days. On the night of the coronation of King Edward III., the Scots attempted to surprise the castle; and, in the following year, they took it by storm, but did not hold it long. In 1355, a party of Scottish troops, under Sir William Ramsay, burnt and plundered the town ; and, in 1498, the castle, which had been repaired by Bishop Fox, was besieged for sixteen days by James of Scot land ; but, on its being relieved by the Earl of Surrey, the besiegers were obliged to retreat. Previous to the battle of Flodden Field, the Scots again assaulted tbe castle here, and, by the advice of a traitor who had deserted the garrison, gained possession of it. Bishop Barnes alienated Norham to the crown ; and the ma nor now belongs to the Haggerston family, and the castle to Sir Francis Blake, Bart., by whom the ruins are carefully preserved \u2014 View of Northumberland."], [469, ";V|)> i: II AM CA8T1L1E., X, I Kill I M' Ull AM"], [470, ""], [471, "ADDENDA \u2014 \u00abe\u00bbfe\u00ab\u00ab\u2014 ADDITIONS, CORRECTIONS, &c.

On November 10, 1828, two shocking murders were committed at Cowley House, near Sedgefield, by a man named Joseph Hutchinson, on the bodies of his father and brother, John and Israel Hutchinson, who were joint occupiers of the farm. The family, consisting of the father, two sons, a daughter, and her husband, were quietly sitting at dinner, when Joseph deliberately rose and went into a back kitchen for a poker, with a tremendous blow of which be brought his brother to the ground nearly lifeless. He next aimed a blow at his brother-in-law, which grazed his forehead, but he fortunately effected his escape with his wife ancl children ; on which Joseph attacked his father with the same weapon. He then went into the yard, and coolly told the servant girl to go in and get her dinner ; but he presently re-entered with a hammer, with which he continued beating the beads of his victims till all signs of life were extinct. Taking a horse out ofthe stable, he rode to Durham as if nothing had happened, but was appre hended near Coxhoe on his return. On his trial, February 23, 1829, being asked whether he was guilty or not, he replied, \"I did it, but were they Christians or not?\" From the evident insanity of bis manner, and the evidence of a surgeon of Sedgefield, the jury expressed their opinion that he was of unsound mind ; and be was taken back to prison, and ordered to be detained.

Previous to the burning down of the rectory bouse, tbe superstitious and vulgar part of the inhabitants of Sedgefield were alarmed by an apparition, denominated tbe Pickled Parson, which tor many years was presumed to infest the neighbourhood of the rector's ball, \" making night hideous.\" The supposed origin ofthe tale is attributed to the cunning of the rector's wife, whose husband having died about a week before the tithes (which are generally let off to farmers, and the rents paid on the 20th of December) became due, she concealed bis death by salting his body in a private room.
