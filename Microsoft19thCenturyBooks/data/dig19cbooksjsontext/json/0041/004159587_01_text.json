During six centuries, it was, in almost every thing but the name, a miniature kingdom ; and its \" mitred princes\" still possess a consi derable share of their ancient and peculiar dignities. The important place which it occupies in the early history of our country, its local features, its productions, and its capabilities, cannot but excite a powerful interest. The history and description of such a district, therefore, it is hoped will be acceptable to the public generally, and to its own inhabitants in particular. In compiling the following pages, much personal research and industry have been employed, and many important local works consulted. The laborious and invaluable volumes of Hutchinson, and the erudite and \" princely folio\" of Surtees, have fur nished ample materials for a foundation, on which the superstructure has been erected. The researches of these talented writers have left little to add to the gene ral history of the county. The various statistical facts introduced are principally drawn from parliamentary or other authenticated documents, A considerable portion of the work has been devoted to parochial and local history. The descriptions of churches and other ancient and public buildings are generally given from personal examination. It has been no part of the editor's plan to enter into lengthened and scientific disquisitions on their architecture ; but simply to de scribe them as they are, and to leave the enlightened antiquary to deduce his own inferences. The accounts of the various Charities of the county are collected from the Reports of the Parliamentary Commissioners ; and it is hoped that this part of the work will be found particularly interesting and useful. These inheritances of the poor have been too frequently lost or misappropriated ; and it is highly desirable to render their nature and extent generally known, and to record them to posterity."], [12, "IV PREFACE. The biographical sketches introduced have received a degree of attention propor tionate to their importance, and have been collected from a variety of sources too numerous to particularize. They attach an interest to places which otherwise would be comparatively obscure; and the birth-place or the residence of every individual who has distinguished himself by his talents or his virtues is consecrated to future ages. Many curious and interesting incidents have been drawn from Sykes's Local Re cords ; and to the editor of that valuable work our gratitude is due for the kind and liberal manner in which his private collection of local literature has been opened for the service of this work. The editor also tenders his thanks, for many interesting communications, to Robert Henry Allan, Esq., F. S. A., of Durham, the value of whose favours is enhanced by the manner in which they are conferred. Acknowledgments are due to a great portion of the parochial clergy of the county, for the assistance they have contributed towards the accounts of their respective churches and parishes. Several gentlemen connected with Catholic and Dissenting congregations have likewise liberally furnished materials illustrative of their re spective places of worship. From many of the resident gentry of the county, also, much polite attention has been experienced. In fact, tlie disposition to assist has been so strongly evinced, and by so numerous a body of individuals in every station of society, that the editor feels himself incompetent to the task, however pleasing of enumerating his obligations. They appear in almost every page of the work ; and the selection of a small portion for acknowledgment would be ingratitude to the majority. The editor is aware that, in detailing these advantages, he is confessing an increased responsibility on his part. With regard to the imperfections of this work, however, he relies upon the candour of his readers for indulgence towards an undertaking of such vast, multifarious, and complicated detail. By the unexpected decease of Mr. Mackenzie, the completion of the work, from page 373 of the first volume, suddenly devolved upon the present writer. The execution of the task, under such circum stances, has been attended with difficulties of no ordinary character ; but it has been his constant study to collect with care, and to relate with accuracy, every circum stance and particular that could possibly tend to elucidate the history of this impor tant county : the success of his exertions must be left to the opinion of his readers."], [13, "LIST OF SUBSCRIBERS.

Their territories extended from the eastern to the western sea, and from the rivers Humber, Don, and Mersey, on the south, to the Tyne on the north ; including, besides Durham, the modern counties of Cumber- land, AArestmoreland, Lancashire, and Yorkshire. The districts of Norham, Holy Island, and Bedlington, belonged to the Ottadini. After the subjuga- tion of the Brigantes by the Romans, their country was called Maxima Ccesariensis ; and the conquerors, while they constructed those stupendous lines of defence called the walls of Hadrian and Severus, did not neglect to secure the tranquillity of their acquisitions by the more certain arts of peace, the gradual introduc- tion of their language, manners, and customs, and the amalgamation of the native deities with their own comprehensive mythology. They erected the city of Vinnoviam, now Binchester ; and they had strong military posts at several other places. The celebrated road called Watling Street entered this county from Catterick ( Cataractonium ) at Piercebridge, and passed by way of Bin- chester and Lanchester (Longovicum ) to Ebchester (supposed to be the Epiacum of Ptolemy), from whence it entered Northumberland. Another road crossed the Tees at Barnard Castle, and passed by Streatlam and Stainton to Binchester ; and Dr. Gale places a road at Winston.

Mr. Cade, however, applies both these names to a road which entered the county near Sockburn, and thence proceeded by Sadberge, Stainton-le-Street, Bradbury, Mains forth, Old Durham, Chester, and Gateshead, to Shields.

The Roman camps were constructed with great military skill ; and the Castra Hyberna, or regular stations, were either built in a town or city, or so contrived as to form towns of themselves. Each was surrounded by a ditch and parapet, termed the fossa and vallum ; and the latter was distinguished into the agger, the earth which was cast up, and the sudes, or wooden stakes to secure and strengthen it. This enclosure was square, and divided into two parts ; vol. I. c"], [18, "GENERAL HISTORY. X After the retirement of the Romans from Britain, and the subsequent inroads of the Picts and Saxons, Ida, a chief of the latter people, landed at Flamborough in 547, drove back the Britons from the coast, and founded the kingdom of Bernicia. He was slain in battle by Owen, a British chief, in 559; and in the following year, \u00c6lla, one of the chieftains who came over with Ida, ac quired the sovereignty of Deira* This state, which extended from the Humber to the Tyne,f formed, when united with Bernicia, on the north ofthe latter river, the kingdom of Northumber land, or the country north of the Humber ; the sovereignty of which was first assumed by Ethel frith, surnamed the Fierce. It is foreign to the purpose of the present work to describe the wars, revolutions, and cruelties, which stain the history of this kingdom, and which belong more properly to the province of the general historian. Milton says of them, \" Such bickerings to recount, what more worth is it than to chronicle the wars of kites and crows flocking- and fighting in the air?\" A more legitimate subject of discussion will be found in the origin and progress of the ecclesiastical see and palatine franchise of Durham. The following chronological table of the kings of North umberland, however, will form an useful reference: \u2014 one containing the pavilion of the general and chief officers, and the other the tents of the common soldiers. Between these was a space of about 100 feet in length, called Principia, where the altars and statues of the gods, and probably the ensigns of the troops, were deposited. Dr. AVhitaker observes that many of the roads, \" now supposed to be purely Roman, were really formed in the line of previous British trackways ;\" and there is reason to suppose that the Britons had a general road round the whole coast of the island, as vestiges of such a work have been observed in various parts of Eng land, particularly along the coasts of Northumberland, Durham, and Yorkshire. The Roman roads were raised some height above the ground which they traversed, and proceeded in as straight a line as possible, running over hill and valley, with a sovereign contempt for all the principles of engineering. They consisted of three distinct layers of materials ; the lowest, stones, mixed with cement (statumen) ; the middle, gravel or small stones ( rudera), to prepare a level and unyielding surface to receive the upper and most important structure, which consisted of large masses accurately fitted together. These roads, especially in the neigh bourhood of cities, had, on both sides, raised footways (margincs), protected by curb-stones, which defined the extent of the central part (agger) for carriages. The latter was barrelled, that no water might lie upon it. The good condition of the roads was thought to be of such importance, that the charge was only entrusted to persons of the highest dignity, and Augustus himself assumed the care of those in the neighbourhood of Rome. The expense of their construction was enormous ; but they were built to last for ever, and to this day remain entire and level in many parts of the world, where they have not been exposed to destructive violence. The Roman soldiers in this country amused themselves with perpetuating their names, or complimenting their victorious leaders by monumental inscriptions; and the many public works they constructed evince their unrivalled skill, industry, and discipline. Their veterans were no less famed for \"their knowledge and assiduity in architecture and sculpture, than for their valour in the field, for they fought and laboured with equal skill and vigour. Some have suggested their example to the modern nations of Europe, who, in times of peace, support in idleness many hundred thousands of soldiers, who might be usefully employed in public works, for the safety, defence, or convenience of their countrymen and themselves. * It happened that Pope Gregory I., surnamed the Great, when in a private station, before he was elevated to the pontifical chair, had observed in the market-place of Rome some British youths exposed for sale, whom their mercenary parents had sold to the Roman merchants. Struck with their fair complexions and bloom ing countenances, Gregory asked to what country they belonged ; and being told that they were Angles, he replied that they ought more properly to be denominated Angels. Inquiring further concerning the name of their province, he was informed that it was Deira, a district of Northumberland. \" Deira !\" replied he, \" that is good ! they are called to the mercy of God from his anger (de iraj. But what is the name of their king ?\" He was told that it was \u00c6lla or Alia. \" Alleluia !\" cried he ; \" we must endeavour that the praises of God be sung in their country.\" These allusions led to the mission of Augustine, and the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons to Christianity. t Surtees, vol. i. p. ii.

It is certain that Christianity was introduced at an early period into Britain ; but, tinder the devastations committed by the Saxons, history has lost sight of it. Edwin, second kirifj of North umberland, enjoyed tbe title of Bretwalda, or chief king of Britain ; and having married Edilberga, daughter of Ethelbert, king of Kent, through her persuasions, and those of the missionary Pauli nus, he embraced Christianity.* He was slain in battle with Penda, king of Mercia; Iiis queen and children, with Paulinus, escaped to Kent ; and idolatry was once more established. * His conversion was effected by a victory obtained over the treacherous Cuichelm and Cynegils, kings of Wessex, and which was attributed to divine interference- In a meeting of his wilan, or counsellors, on the subject, the first who ventured to speak was Coiffi, the pagan high- priest, who, instead of opposing, advised the adoption ofthe foreign worship. His motive was singular. No one, he said, had served the gods more assiduously than himself, and yet few had been less fortunate. He was wearv of deities who were so indif ferent or so ungrateful, and would willingly try his fortune under the new religion. To this profound theo logian succeeded a thane, whose discource, while it proves the good sense of the speaker, exhibits a striking proof of national manners. He sought for information respecting the origin and the destiny of man. \"' Often,\" said he, \" O king, in the depth of winter, while you are feasting with your thanes, and the fire is __ _ _\u00bb' l - - _ _ .. _ _ - - _ _, - , .. ._._, blazing on the hearth in the midst of your hall, you have seen a bird, pelted by the storm, enter at one door, and escape at the other. During its passage it was visible: but whence it came, or whither it went, you knew not. Such to me appears the life of man. He walks the earth for a few years ; but what precedes his birth, or what is to follow his death, we cannot tell. Undoubtedly, if the new religion can unfold these important secrets, it must be worthy our attention.\" At the common request Paulinus was introduced, and explained the principal doctrines of Christianity. Coiffi declared himself a convert, and to prove his since- rity, offered to set lire to the neighbouring temple of Godmundham. With the permission of Edwin, he called for a horse and arms, both of which were forbidden to the priests of the Angles. As he rode along he was followed by crowds, who attributed his conduct to a temporary insanity. To their astonishment bidding defiance to the gods of his fathers, he struck his spear into the wall of the temple. Thev had ex- pected that the fires of heaven would have revenged the sacrilege. The impunity ofthe apostate dissipated their alarms; and urged by his example and exhortations, they united in kindling the flames, which with"], [20, "GENERAL HISTORY. XII In struggling for his kingdom with the usurper Cedwall, King Oswald erected the standard of the cross, to which he attributed the decisive victory he obtained near Hexham. He sent an em bassy, in 634, to request from Donald, king of Scotland, with whom he had formerly sought refuge, missionaries to assist in the conversion of his subjects. The first who was sent, Corman, a monk of a morose and rigid disposition, soon returned in disgust to his monastery ; but when, in presence of the community, he accused the Northumbrians of barbarism and ignorance, he received a severe and sensible rebuke. \" Brother,\" exclaimed a voice, \" the fault was yours. You exacted from the pagans more than their weakness would bear. You should have first stooped to them, and gradu ally have raised their minds to the sublime truths of the gospel.\" At the sound, every eye was fixed on the speaker, a private monk of the name of Aidan, who was chosen as the successor of Corman by the unanimous suffrage of his brethren. Having received the episcopal consecration, he repaired to the court of Oswald, who condescended to explain in English the instructions which the bishop delivered in his native language; and such were the effects of their united labours, that, in the space of seven days, 15,000 persons are said to have been baptized. Many of Aidan's brethren left Scotland to assist in the holy work ; and he received from the king the island of Lin disfarn, since called Holy Island, in which he built a monastery, under the religious rule of St, Columba, and long an object of veneration to the Northumbrians. SEE OF LINDISFARN. Aidan, first bishop of Lindisfarn, traversed, with unwearied perseverance, every part of the kingdom of Northumberland ; and the austerity of his life, his contempt of riches, his charity to the poor, and his attachment to the duties of his profession, gained the hearts, while his arguments convinced the understanding of his proselytes.* During his episcopacy, his royal patron, Oswald, was slain in battle with Penda. -f Having held the bishopric seventeen years, he died, it is said, of grief for the loss of Oswin, king of Deira, who was basely put to death by Oswy, king of Berni cia. Aidan was canonized for his piety and virtue. the fane consumed the deities that had been so long the objects of their terror and veneration. \u2014 Lingard's Hist, of England, vol. i. p. 123. * Bede bears honourable testimony to the virtue of the ecclesiastics of this period. AVith a glowin\" pencil he displays their patience, their chastity, their frequent meditation on the sacred writings, and their indefa tigable efforts to attain the summits of Christian perfection. They chose for their habitation the most dreary situations ; no motives but those of charity could draw them from their cells ; and, if they appeared in public their object was to reconcile enemies, to instruct the ignorant, to discourage vice, and to plead the cause of the unfortunate. The little property which they enjoyed was common to all ; poverty they esteemed as the surest guardian of virtue; and the benefactions of the opulent they respectfully declined, or instantly em ployed in relieving the necessities of the indigent. \u2014 View of Northumberland, vol. i. p. 304. t The inhuman conqueror caused the remains of his royal victim, after being horridly mano*led, to be sus pended on a pole, like those of an infamous malefactor ; on which account the name of the place, Maserfield was afterwards changed to Oswald's-tree, now Oswestry. Part of the body of Oswald was interred at Glou cester ; his head was translated to Lindisfarn, and afterwards found in the coffin of St. Cuthbert \u2022 and his arm was kept in a silver case at Bambrough. It is related by Bede, that Oswald being at dinner on Easter day, his servants informed him that some poor people waited for alms at the door, whereupon he ordered the dish (of silver) and the meat upon it to be broken and distributed amongst them. The bishop Aidan, who was present, was so affected by this act of charity, that he took him by the hand and exclaimed, \" Never let this arm perish !\" After his death, Oswald received the honours of a saint. Bede says that when Penda laid siege to the royal fortress of Bebbanburgh, or Bambrough, and attempted to set it on fire, the wind changed on the prayer of Aidan, and blew the flames the other way. He is also said to have calmed a storm, by pouring some sanctified oil on the sea."], [21, "GENERAL HISTORY. XIII Finan, a Briton, succeeded Aidan in 651, and converted to Christianity Peada, son of the san guinary Penda, and Sigebert, king of the East Angles. He is said to have erected a church in Lindisfarn, built of timber, and covered with reeds, after the humble model of the Scottish edifices. He died in 661, and was succeeded by his countryman, Colman, who resigned the see at the end of three years, in consequence of King Oswy taking part against him in a dispute with Wilfrid, afterwards archbishop of York.* He carried with him into Scotland part of the relics of St. Aidan. Tuda succeeded to the vacant see, and died within the year, of the plague which then ravaged Northumberland. f The see was removed to York by his successor, Cedda ,- and Lindisfarn was governed for fourteen years by Eata, its abbot, who had been a monk of Melrose. The pious and humble Cedda, at the instance of Alfred and Oswy, resigned his see to Wilfrid, who having incur red the displeasure of King Egfrid, that monarch requested Theodore, archbishop of Canterbury, to sever Lindisfarn from York ; and Eata was appointed bishop of the former in 6/8. AVilfrid went to Rome, and procured a mandate from the pope for his restitution ; but this was disregarded by Egfrid, and the refractory bishop was condemned to perpetual exile. \\ Eata soon after incurred the displeasure of Theodore, in consequence of having questioned that archbishop's power over the northern churches, which had been exercised in severing the newly-founded diocese of Hagulstadt, or Hexham, from Lindisfarn. The enraged metropolitan summoned a council on the banks of the Aln in 684, and Eata was compelled to exchange bishoprics with Cuthbert, then bishop of Hexham. The early part of St. Cuthbert's life is involved in much obscurity, and the accounts given by historians relative to his origin are also extremely contradictory ; some asserting that he was of regal extraction, and others contending that he was of plebeian race. The latter opinion, however, is the most probable. He was educated in pastoral life on the banks of the Leder,\u00a7 and was after wards for some years distinguished by his peculiar sanctity of life as a religious brother of the * This dispute, which was conducted with great warmth at the monastery of AVhitby, related to the proper time for celebrating Easter, and the most approved method of wearing the ecclesiastical tonsure. The Roman church, about the middle of the sixth century, adopted a new cycle, with which the British Christians were unacquainted. The Romanists also shaved the crown of the head, which was surrounded by a circle of hair, supposed to represent the wreath of thorns forced on the temples of the .Messiah ; whilst the Scottish mis sionaries permitted the hair to grow on the back, and shaved in the form of a crescent the front of the head. Each party was surprised and shocked at the uncanonical appearance of the other ; but each pertinaciously adhered to their own opinion, and the controversy threatened to destroy the fabric that had been erected with so much labour and perseverance. t There had been a total eclipse of the sun in the preceding May, from whence the most alarming disas ters were predicted. The summer was extremely dry : the heavens, to use the expression of an ancient chronicler, appeared to be on fire ; and the pestilence above alluded to, which was called the yellow plague, and was of the most fatal description, made its appearance in the southern parts of the island, and gradually advanced towards the north. Its symptoms have not been described ; but many of the East Saxons, ima gining it was a proof of the displeasure of the gods, relapsed into idolatry. Many died in the course of a single day's illness, and hardly more than one in thirty recovered. During twenty years this plague visited and revisited England and Ireland, and whole districts were depopulated by it- In the latter country, an ancient writer computes its victims at two-thirds of the inhabitants. The highlands of Caledonia were alone free from this dreadful visitation ; an exemption which the natives piously attributed to the intercession of their patron, St. Columba. X He founded the see of Selsey, in the kingdom of the South Saxons ; and, after some further struggles for the restitution of his authority, he was restored to his abbeys of Hexham and Ripon, of which latter he was subsequently adopted as the tutelary saint. \u00a7 He is said to have been first induced to enter upon a religious life by a vision of the holy Aidan ascend ing into heaven. vol. i. d"], [22, "GENERAL HISTORY. XIV house of Melrose. From thence he was appointed to the office of hostillar in the monastery of Ripon ; but he soon returned to his parent church, of which, in process of time, he became prior. Appointed prior of Lindisfarn, he exercised the duties of his office with unremitting attention. The discipline and morals of the brethren, which had, it seems, undergone some relaxation, were restored by his exertions, in which zeal and perseverance were not more conspicuous than modera tion and command of temper. Through the whole of the surrounding district, many who had re lapsed into idolatrous practices were brought back to the pale of the church ; and in situations where the wildness of the country or the barbarous manners of the people had precluded the ap proach of former pastors, the ignorance of the inhabitants was instructed, and their ferocity softened, by the diffusion of the gospel truths. Tlie prejudices of the age, which considered the entire abandonment of worldly intercourse as the most exalted stage of religious purity, was per haps peculiarly adapted to impress a mind already highly turned to contemplative exercises of devotion. After passing fourteen years in the convent of Lindisfarn, Cuthbert determined on retiring from the extended sphere of his pious labours, and on spending the remainder of his time in religious seclusion. The largest of the Fam Islands, now called the House Island, was as yet unmarked by tlie habitation of man, and was selected for his solitary residence. He erected, with his own hands, a humble edifice of stone and turf for his abode ; and on this desolate spot he led a life of extreme austerity and seclusion, forcing the barren soil to yield him sustenance by the labour of his hands, and employing the intervals of leisure in exercises of prayer and meditation ; inter- rupted only by the occasional visits of the brethren of the convent, who resorted to him for religious instruction or counsel. Nine years of his life passed in this solitary retreat. On the deposition of Trumbert, bishop of Hexham, a synod was held at Twyford on the Aln, in the presence of King Egfrid and the archbishop Theodore, at which the common voice nominated the anchoret of Farn as successor to Trumbert ; but it was not till the monarch, attended by his nobles and the clergy of the convent, had sought him in his cell, and had with the most earnest entreaties pressed his acceptance of the vacant bishopric, that he could be prevailed on to leave his retirement. On his exchange with Eata, he was consecrated bishop of Lindisfarn, at York, on Easter-day, April 'J, 685, by Theodore, attended by seven assisting prelates. It is at this period that Cuthbert is gene rally supposed to have received a grant from Egfrid of the vill of Craike, with the surrounding territory for three miles, and of the city of Carlisle, with fifteen miles of adjacent country. Cuthbert did not long retain the honours he had thus reluctantly accepted. After presiding in Lindisfarn two years, he voluntarily relinquished his dignity, and feeling the approach of age and infirmity, retired once more to his hermitage in Farn, where he expired two months afterwards, in the 39th year of his monastic life, and in the 53d from the foundation of the see of Lindisfarn. His last moments were employed in exhorting his brethren to a strict preservation of their religious discipline, to unity amongst themselves, and submission to the authority of the Catholic church. He had intended to be buried in the oratory at Farn ; and a stone coffin,* the gift of Cedda, too-e ther with a piece of fine linen presented by Virca, abbess of Tynyngham, were preserved bv him for the purpose of his interment. He, however, yielded to the earnest request of the monks of * It is related that when the monks were flying from the Danes, the holy corpse of St. Cuthbert floated in this coffin down the Tweed from Melrose to Tillmouth. This boat or coffin still exists near the ruined chapel at the latter place, though broken in two pieces. It is 10 feet in length, 3| in diameter, and only 4 inches in thickness, and has been proved by experiments to be certainly capable of floating with the weight of a human body. On the intention of some of the people in the neighbourhood to convert it to profane uses, the spirits of darkness are said to have broken it in the night."], [23, "GENERAL HISTORY. XV Lindisfarn, who desired that his remains should rest amongst them ; and was consequently inter- red, first in the cemetery of the old church there, and afterwards, on its being rebuilt, on the right of the high altar. His last injunction to his brethren, that, rather than submit to any violation of their religious institutions, they should take up his reliques and fly with them to seek a more secure place of refuge, has been exalted by the monastic writers into a prophetic view of the future trou bles of his church. Such was the life of St. Cuthbert, the saint and patron of Durham.* * Surtees, vol. i. p. iv. ; Raine's St. Cuthbert ; &c. The public works ascribed to St. Cuthbert are, the foundation of a monastery at Craike, restoring the nunnery at Carlisle, and establishing a school there for the advancement of religion. In imitation of him, the monks of Lindisfarn wore no garments of various or costly colours, but generally such as were of the natural colour of the wool. So highly was the memory of St. Cuthbert venerated, that more than forty churches and chapels in the northern counties were dedicated to him ; and King Alfred, to whom he is said to have appeared in a vision, promising him success over the Danes, honoured his name upon his coins. Though it would be absurd to dignify with the name of history, in the usual acceptation of the term, the various legends of miracles, &c. with which the real character of St. Cuthbert has been obscured, yet they ought not to be altogether passed over as unworthy of notice, for they form important data in the history of the human mind. In the Legend of St. Cuthbert, many extraordinary stories, extracted from Bede and others, are related of him. His future honours were foretold when he was a child, by an infant of three years old, who gravely reproved him \u2014 \" Fie, Saint Cuthbert ! what, a presbyter and a bishop, and playing with boys?\" as if he had seen his mitre and crozier. AVhen on his way to the abbey of Melrose, he was opposed by the devil, who was compelled to retreat, after a good cudgelling. Being faint and weary after such violent exertion, a horse discovered to him a loaf of bread. On his arrival at the abbey, Boysilus, the prior, by a prophetical physiognomy, solemnly received him in his arms, as though he had expected him ; and the book of St. John's gospel, in which he was taught, was entire in Durham cathedral in Prior Tur- got's time. In his dreary solitude at Farn, he had a variety of combats with the devil, the print of whose cloven feet, it is said, is to be seen in many places. If any person, out of devotion, came to visit him, he retired to his cell, and discoursed to them only through the window. Once, indeed, to oblige a lady, the abbess of Coldingham, he paid her a visit at the isle of Coquet, where, going down to the sea-shore, as was his custom every night, two sea-monsters presented themselves, kneeling before him, as to demand his bene- diction, which having received, they returned to the deep. Two crows, on being reproved by the saint for plundering his crop of grain, or stealing the thatch from his dwelling, retreated in the utmost confusion, and returned a few days after, bringing with them, as a penitential oblation, a portion of swine's grease, to anoint the sandals of the saint. That they came honestly by the grease must be taken for granted. AA'hile he was preaching to a crowded audience, the alarm was given that a cottage was on fire ; a number of his auditors withdrew, but all their efforts to extinguish the flames were ineffectual. The saint, suspecting the illusion, repaired to the scene of action, and ordered a few drops of holy water to be sprinked on it, on which the devil sneaked off, and the fire disappeared. Another time, the devil assumed the likeness of a beautiful woman, and, whilst the saint was preaching, placed himself in a conspicuous place, and so bewitched the congregation that all their attention was diverted from the discourse, until the saint destroyed the deception by sprinkling the pretended lady with holy water. Almost every one of the forty chapters of the life ot' this saint contains a separate prodigy. He is even said to have raised the dead, and to have converted water into wine by the mere touch of his mouth. The monks of Lindisfarn, says the author of the Legend, \" defloured all the miracles of saints in holy writt, and bestowed them upon their St. Cuthbert.\" It is traditionally said that St. Cuthbert still retains an affection for his old residence at Lindisfarn, where the superstitious beUeve he often comes in the night, and, sitting upon a rock, uses another as his anvil, on which he forges his \"beads. ' These are Entrochi, and are found in a bed of black shiver, or slate, mixed with iron ore. Sir AValter Scott has thus interwoven this tradition in his poem of Marmion : \u2014 \" But fain St. Hilda's nuns would learn, And said they might his shape behold, If, on a rock, by Lindisfarn, And hear his anvil sound ; St. Cuthbert sits, and toils to frame A deadend clang \u2014 a huge dim form The sea-born beads that bear his name : Seen but, and heard, when gathering storm Such tales had AVhitby's fishers told, And night were closing round.\" The learned author of \" A brief Account of Durham Cathedral,\" says of St. Cuthbert's alleged miracles, \" AVere it not that we know their writers had other objects in view, and that, from the ignorance of the age, they were otherwise received, we should, from their nature, conclude tbat they were intended as so many ro-"], [24, "GENERAL HISTORY. XVI The see of Lindisfarn continued vacant for a year, during which it was governed by Wilfrid, then in possession of Hexham. In 688, Eadbert was consecrated bishop, under whom the humble edifice of Finan was replaced by a cathedral of stone roofed with lead. On the translation of the remains of St. Cuthbert into this edifice, their incorruptibility is related to have been discovered (see City of Durham). During Eadbert's episcopacy, he never exacted tithes or church-dues* from the poor. He died in 698, and was succeeded by Eadfrith, or Egfrith, a learned monk of Lindisfarn, who translated the gospels into the Latin and Saxon languages, which work is now de posited in the British Museum, in the Cottonian collection. The Arenerable Bede addressed an expostulatory epistle to this bishop, on the episcopal duties and the decline of religious discipline.-f On the death of Eadfrith in 724, he was succeeded by Ethelwold, abbot of Melrose, who erected a ponderous stone cross, long held in high veneration. During his episcopacy, Ceolwulph, king of Northumberland, abdicated his throne, and assumed the cowl at Lindisfarn, where he caused ale and wine to be given to the monks, instead of milk and water, the beverage recommended by Aidan. + Ceolwulph endowed the church with many valuable grants, and after his death was ca nonized. His body, after lying some years at Lindisfarn, was removed to Norham, from whence his head was subsequently translated to Durham cathedral. Cynewo/f was inducted to the bishopric on the death of Ethelwold in 740; but he afterwards incurred the displeasure of King Eadbert, who kept him a long time prisoner at Bambrough, for having refused to give up the murderer of Offa (a person of the royal line), who had taken refuge in the church of Lindisfarn. This is the first recorded instance of St. Cuthbert' s privilege of sanc tuary. Friethbert, bishop of Hexham, administered the church during Cynewolfs confinement, who, after presiding 40 years, resigned the see, and retired to the hermitage of Farn. Higbald, mantic tales, to take their turn with stories of ghosts, and giants, and fairies, and amuse the people ofthe pala tinate during their winter nights.\" From such wilful frauds as they are here charged with, an elegant writer endeavours to exculpate the memory of the founders of Christianity in this country. \" The ancient monks,\" says he, \" were a pious but simple race of men. They sedulously studied the scriptures, and admired the pro digies which the Almighty is recorded to have wrought in favour of his chosen people. They knew that his arm was not shortened : they doubted not that he was ready to do for his servants under the new law, what he had already done for his servants under the old. Hence, they frequently became the dupes of their own credulity, attributing to the interposition of providence every extraordinary event, or unexpected coincidence.\" * Origin of Tithes. \u2014 \" The laws of Ina, king of the AVest Saxons, are supposed to have taken place about the year 090 ; the fourth section of which is to the following purport : ' The first fruits of seeds, or the church dues arising from the product of corn, &c. are to be paid at the feast of St. Martin ; and let him that fails in the payment forfeit 40s.' as Lambert reads it, or 00s- according to Sir Henry Spelman (a Saxon shilling con- sisted of 5d. sterling), and, besides, pay ike dues twelve limes over. And in section 62d, ' Church-dues are to be paid where the person owing them dwells in the midst of winter.' These laws are mentioned, as they appear to be the first on record touching such kind of maintenance for the church. The oblations and gifts of the people, which first arose in benevolence, as acts of piety, were transformed, by usage and custom, into , a right, and now advanced into the firmer title of ordinance. Hence modern lawyers say, that tithes are due of common right, as having existed from the first establishment of churches, and made regular from the divi- sion of parochial limits.\" \u2014 Hutchinson, vol. i. p. 27- + From this epistle it appears that it was not unusual for persons of rank, at this period, to enter upon the monastic life, or become founders of religious houses, rather from a wish of ease and exemption from temporal service than from any reUgious dispositions. In the mean time, the Anglo-Saxons were grown so intolerably licentious, that Boniface, archbishop of Mentz, in a letter of remonstrance, accuses them of being worse than their heathen forefathers.

XVII his successor, was consecrated at Soccabrigg in 780, and held the see till 803, during which time he was troubled with various calamities, not only from the civil anarchy then prevailing, but from the invasions of the Danes, who now began to make descents on the shores of England. In 793> they landed in Northumberland, where the treasures of the church of Lindisfarn offered an easy booty. Their impiety polluted the altars, and their rapacity was rewarded by the gold and silver ornaments, the oblations of gratitude and devotion. The monks endeavoured by concealment to elude their cruelty ; but the greater number were discovered, and were either slaughtered on the island, or drowned in the sea. On a second descent, in the following year, the Danes were de- feated ; and the bishop with the remnant of his monks returned to Lindisfarn, where they found the body of St. Cuthbert still inviolate. The zeal of all ranks was displayed in the restoration of the sacred edifices. During the prelacy of Higbald, in 787-1 a papal legate had travelled into Northumberland, and was present at an assembly of all the principal clergy and laity, when cer tain orders were agreed to for the discipline and reformation of manners. Higbald was succeeded by Egbert, who was inducted at Bywell by Eanbald, archbishop of York. Heathured followed in 821. The enlightened and beneficent Egfrid became bishop in 830, and contributed largely to the honour and opulence of the church, to which he gave the town of Jedworth, Gainford with its church, Billingham, and the rest of his possessions between Tyne and Tees, with his estates at Clyff' and AAryclift' in Yorkshire. He died in 845, and was succeeded by Eanbert. Eardulph, the sixteenth and last bishop of Lindisfarn, was appointed in 854, at which time Northumberland was divided between two tributary princes, Osbert and \u00c6lla, who are accused of having plundered the church of the possessions of Warkworth, Tillniouth, Billing- ham, Clyff\", AVycliff', and Craike. Their dissensions opened an easy passage to the Danes, who, under Halfden, pillaged and destroyed Tynemouth priory, and afterwards proceeded northward, destroying and plundering almost every church and monastery in Northumberland. Before they reached Lindisfarn, however, the bishop and his colony of monks had fled, taking with them the body of St. Cuthbert and their other precious relics, viz. the head of St. Oswald, the bones of Aidan, Eadbert, Eanfred, and Ethelwold, the cross erected by the latter, and their sacred vessels, altars, &c. ; all of which they inclosed in one ark or shrine. They wandered through Scotland, with their precious burden, for several years; and at AVhithern, in Galloway, they attempted to sail for Ire land, but were driven back by tempests.* After remaining for short periods at Norham, Melrose, and Tillniouth, they at length found a refuge in the abbey of Craike. Whilst they rested here, Eadred the abbot related, to a numerous assembly of Danes and Eng lish, that St. Cuthbert had appeared to him, and uttered the following command : \u2014 \" Say to the people that I have sent thee, commanding them to bring forth Guthred, the son of Hardiknut, whom they sold to a widow woman as a slave.

This disaster affected them sore, but St. Cuthbert appeared in a vision to Hendre- dus, one of his monks, and commanded them to search the shore for the book lost at sea, three miles from land. They did as they were admonished, and found it much more beautiful than before, both within and without, being no way injured by the salt water, but rather polished by some heavenly hand, which did not a little increase their joy. Being weary with seeking the book, and with bearing the saint's body, he pre sented to their eyes a bridle on a tree, and a red horse running towards them, that offered himself to be bri dled, to ease their labour in carrying the chest wherein St. Cuthbert's body lay. \u2014 Davies' Rites and Monuments. vol. i. e"], [26, "XVIII GENERAL HISTORY. demption paid, let him be shown to the multitude; and it being my will, and I rejoicing therein, bind the armilla* on his right arm, and let him be proclaimed king.\" This order was received with joyful acclamation. The youth was found in the vale of AVhittingham, and, with Alfred's approbation, received the crown of Northumberland as his dependant. There was considerable policy in this novel affair, which, by placing the son of a Danish general on the tributary throne, conciliated the minds of that envious people ; and, under the influence of their patron saint, the Northumbrians were reconciled to his government. Peace being thus established, the bishop and the abbot, with their train of monks, &c, removed their sacred relics from Craike to Cuncacastre, or Chester-le-Street, where Eardulph established his see in 882, and commenced the building of a new cathedral of wood. SEE OF CHESTER-LE-STREET. During the episcopacy of Eardulph, King Alfred and his dependant, Guthred, jointly granted, that wherever St. Cuthbert's remains should rest, there should be an inviolable sanctuary ; and that the possessions of St. Cuthbert and his church, as well such as were at that time, or thereto fore, granted, as those which might thereafter be acquired by purchase or otherwise, should be for ever freed and discharged from all customs and services, and should be held and enjoyed by the church, with all such sovereign jurisdiction and power as the demesne of the crown was held ; and this was confirmed by the acclamations of the assenting people, assembled on this solemn occasion, and became an ordinance established for ever. Thus originated the jura regalia which dignifies the palatine of Durham. Eardulph annexed the vacant see of Hexham to his own; and they continued united during a period of 230 years. Under his successor, Cutheard, appointed in 900, the church continued to prosper, notwithstanding the distracted state of the country, and the piratical descent of Reino-. wald (see Castle-Eden). He purchased Sedgefield with its appurtenances, and the district now called Bedlingtonshire. Barnard, a priest, gave Willington to the church; and Tilred, an abbot, gave a moiety of South Eden. Tilred succeeded to the bishopric in 915. Under the next prelate, Wigred, appointed in 928, King Athelstan, in the course of an expedition against the Scots, visited the shrine of St. Cuthbert, and confirmed the possessions and privileges of the church, with the additional grant of South AA^earmouth and its dependencies, viz. AVeston, Offerton, Silksworth the two Ryhopes, Burdon, Seaham, Seaton, Dalton, Dalden, and Hesilden. Uhred, or Uchtred, succeeded in 944 ; at whose death, in 947, Se.vhelm, a person of depraved mind and manners, pos sessed the see for a few months, when he was expelled, or, according to Simeon, the patron saint afflicted him with madness till he passed the limits of the bishopric. Aldred, his successor, enjoyed the see till 968; when Elfsig became bishop. Alditne, or Aldwin, the ninth and last bishop of Chester-le-Street, and who had been tutor to Edward the Confessor, was inducted in 990, at a very unhappy era; for, five years afterwards, the Danes again invaded the island, under Sweyn, kino of Denmark, and Olaus, king of Norway, who plundered Northumberland, and burned the city and castle of Bambrough. To avoid the cupidity and barbarity of their old enemies, the bishop and his religious fraternity quitted Chester-le-Street, where the see had been established 113 years, and fled, with the body of their saint and all their treasures and sacred relics, to Ripon in York shire, where they rested till the ravagers quitted their country.

The contempt of riches which distinguished the primitive monks of Lindisfarn had long evapo rated, and successive grants of lands to St. Cuthbert had already swelled the domains of his bishop and clergy. Now, however, a greater impulse than ever was given to this kind of devotion ; and all ranks hastened to offer either their oblations to the new church of Durham, or their labour to wards its erection. In a solemn assembly of nobles and prelates, held at York, in the presence of King Ethelred and Archbishop AVulstane, Styr, the son of Ulphus\u201e conferred on the church of Durham, in perpetuity, Darlington with its appendages, and lands in Coniscliffe, Cockerton, and Haughton, and in Normanby and Seaton. Snaculf, the son of Cykell, contributed Bradbury, Morden, Sockburn, and Grisby.* On the other hand, Simeon records the mortgage of twenty-four villas-f by the bishops of Durham to the Earls of Northumberland, for their protection during the calamities of the period; but he adds that restitution had been withheld by the succeeding earls. Bishop Aldune's death is said to have been occasioned by grief, on the unfortunate event of a battle with the Scots at Carham._J; Eadmund, 1020\u20141041 It is probable that the disorders consequent on the struggles of the Scots and Danes with the natives, perplexed the councils of the ecclesiastics of Durham ; as a bishop was not elected for three years after the death of Aldune. Whilst the monks were one day discussing the subject, Eadmund, a secular priest of noble birth, casually entered the church, and, in a jesting manner, exclaimed, \" AVhy cannot you make me a bishop ?\" The perplexed ecclesiastics hailed the inad vertent expression as the effect of inspiration ; Eadmund, with great surprise and reluctance, was elected by common consent ; and the decision was confirmed by an appeal to the miraculous shrine * \" Soe ready was the devotion of those tymes to give all to the church, to receive it in heaven ; whiles the monkes were well content to enjoy themselves here in this life, as if they onely before other men had this priviledge, to bee happy in both worlds.\" \u2014 Legend of St. Cuthbert.

So severely was the defeat of this army felt, that many parts of the country were almost depopulated by the fatal catastrophe."], [28, "GENERAL HISTORY. XX of St. Cuthbert. The new prelate assumed the monastic habit, received the approbation of King Canute, and was consecrated in 1021, by Wulstan, archbishop of York, at Winchester. He proved himself worthy of the elevation to which chance had conducted him, and governed the see with dignity and prudence. During his pontificate, Canute made his celebrated barefoot pilgrimage to the shrine of St. Cuthbert (see City of Durham). \u00c6lfred, a monk of the convent, about this time travelled into Northumberland, and collected the most valuable reliques of the saints and confes sors from the various churches, all of which he transferred to Durham. He also removed the re mains of the ATenerable Bede from Jarrow, and deposited them in the shrine of St. Cuthbert. Eadmund died at Gloucester, whither he had been summoned to attend the king. Eadred, 1041\u20141042. Eadred, a secular priest, seized the possessions of the church, with part of which he purchased from Hardicanute a nomination to the bishopric. He died, however, ten months after his consecration. Egelric, 1042\u20141056. Egelric, a monk of Peterborough, who had accompanied Eadmund to Durham, was declared bishop by the authority of Earl Godwin. Being considered an alien by the monks of Durham, they expelled him ; but he was reinstated by the powerful Siward, Earl of Northumberland. He commenced several religious works; and, amongst others, pulled down the old wooden church at Chester-le-Street, and begun the erection of a new one of stone. During this work, a treasure (probably Roman, though said by Simeon to have been hidden by Sexhelm) was discovered, which Egelric appropriated to his own use, and transmitted to the monastery of Peterborough, whither he himself shortly retired, having resigned the see to his brother Egelwin. Egelwin, 1056\u20141071. The appointment of Egelwin was confirmed by the influence of Earl Tosti. After the Norman Conquest, this bishop and the Earls Edwin and Morcar submitted to the new sovereign, and swore allegiance to him at York. The north of England, however, was far from being in a state of secu rity ; and the task of its entire subjugation was soon after committed to Robert Comyn, a Norman noble, whose death at Durham was amply and cruelly revenged by the dreadful devastations com mitted by the Conqueror himself (see City of Durham). His troops were scarcely withdrawn, when Malcolm, king of Scots, penetrated, with a marauding army, through Cumberland into Cleve land and the bishopric, carried desolation down the course of the Tees, and burned the towns and monasteries of Hartlepool and AVearmouth.f Though the revenues of the church of Durham had been augmented by a donation from Earl Copsi of the church of St. Germanus in Marske, and va rious lands there and in Thornton, Tocketts, Redeliff', and Guisborough, yet Egelwin found him self so oppressed under the Norman power, by which the patrimony of the church was obliged (as * He was afterwards accused to AVilliam the Conqueror of robbing the church, committed for trial, and died in prison in London, more than twenty-four years after his resignation. t Earl Cospatric, in retaliation, made a similar inroad into Cumbria (then belonging to Scotland), and re turned with a plentiful harvest of plunder to his castle of Bambrough. After Malcolm, who was then at Wearmouth, received intelligence of this, the war assumed a still more sanguinary aspect. The Scots who were impelled not only by the hope of plunder but also by the thirst of revenge, crossed the Tyne, burnt the churches and villages, massacred the infants and the aged, and forced along with them all the men and women able to bear the fatigue of the journey. So numerous were the captives, that, according to a historian who was almost a contemporary, they furnished every farm in the soutli of Scotland with English slaves."], [29, "GENERAL HISTORY. XXI \"well as the possessions of the laity) to provide soldiers and military aids, that he determined to fly with his treasures to Cologne. He was compelled by a storm, however, to take refuge in Scotland ; and, having returned to England in the enterprize of the Earls Edwin and Morcar, he was be trayed and taken with the other heads of the party in the Isle of Ely, and sent prisoner to Abing don, where he died in confinement. The see remained vacant one year, during which Simeon says an officer was sent by the king to impose a tax on the church-lands; but, by the usual occurrence of a vision,* he was deterred from doing it.j AValcher, 1072\u2014 1080. On the return of King AVilliam I. from an expedition into Scotland, he caused Walcher, the son of a nobleman in Lorraine, and who had been invited into England, to be elected bishop of Dur- ham. He was famous for his sanctity and learning ; and, soon after his elevation to the episcopacy, he received from the king the earldom of Northumberland, vacant by the deposition and death of Waltheof. This bishop is generally allowed to have been the first who exercised the palatines powers, in the full sense of the word ; though it is certain that various privileges had been annexed to the see from the time of Alfred. \" The motives,'1'' says Surtees, \" which at this peculiar crisis might lead to the delegation of so extensive a privilege are sufficiently obvious. The vicinity of Scotland, then an active and vigilant enemy, and, not less, the insecure state of the northern pro- vince, always restless under the severity of the Norman yoke, demanded that at such a distance from the seat of government a power should exist capable of acting on emergency with vigour and promptitude ; and the motives are no less apparent which would incline the monarch to select for this important trust an enlightened ecclesiastic, appointed by and attached to the crown, in prefer- ence to a hereditary noble, less easily conciliated, and already possessing a dangerous share of local influence. Owning henceforth, within the limits ofthe palatinate, no earthly superior, (he succes- sive prelates of Durham continued for four centuries to exercise every right attached to a distinct and independent sovereignty. The paramount seignorial property in all lands, from which, accord ing to the principles of the feudal system, arose the privileges of escheat, forfeiture, and wardship, and the possession of mines, wastes, forests, and chaces ; the supreme jurisdiction, as well civil as military (the former exercised by the establishment of courts of law and equity, the appointment * Hegg says, \" The saint in a sleepe soe beate him with his pastoral staffe, that the next morning not able to rise, he was glad to send his cloake to St. Cuthbert's shrine (which was there kept in memory of the fact) and to aske pardon before he could receave any ease.\" t Malmsbury says that learning and religion were little regarded at this period. There was very little scholarship even amongst the clergy. If they could read the church service, they thought themselves quaU fied for their function, and seldom carried their education much higher. If any of them understood grammar, he was looked upon as a prodigy of knowledge. The monks forsook the austerities of their order, and be came expensive and sumptuous in their diet and habit. The rich among the laity were abandoned to luxury and debauchery ; they thought it a hardship to submit to the old customs of devotion, to appear in church at morning prayer, but had matins performed in their bed-chambers whilst they were still at repose. The poor were generally made a prey to the wealthy, who treated them without humanity, and as if they were by na ture of an inferior creation : they were frequently plundered of their little effects, and sold for slaves to fo reign nations. Justice, temperance, and religion, were rare qualities in this era. \u2014 Hutchinson, vol. i. p. 111. X Palatine, a term which, originating in the palace of the Byzantine emperors, and signifying, in its sim ple and restricted sense, nothing more than an inhabitant of the palace, came successively to denote an officer of the household, a governor of a province with extensive delegated powers, and, at last, when these gover nors grew sufficiently powerful to make themselves feared by their masters, a feudal prince, who owed little more than a nominal subjection to the paramount sovereign \u2014 Surtees, vol. i. p. xv. vol. i. \u2014 48. f"], [30, "XXII GENERAL HISTORY. of officers, and the levying of taxes and subsidies ; the latter by the power of array, as well of ships as soldiers), together with a jurisdiction of admiralty, as well along the coast as in the navi gable and other waters, and the royal privilege of the mint, were all included in this extensive franchise, of which tlie various branches were either generally or individually ratified by express confirmation or exception in various successive acts of parliament, or other matters of record of high and public authority. Of this royalty the limits were at all times co-extensive with the bounds of the palatinate. These, at the period of the Norman Conquest, included the chief part of the district betwixt Tees and Tyne, with the exception of the earldom or wapontake of Sadberge, and of the liberty of Barnard Castle (of which the first was subsequently acquired by purchase, the latter by right of forfeiture), the districts of Bedlington, Norham, Holy Island, and Craike (which though geographically included in Northumberland and York, were henceforth, as parcel of the possessions of the see, considered as integral portions of the county of Durham), together with Hexhamshire, the city of Carlisle, and a district in Tiviotdale. Of these last possessions the see of Durham was deprived by the jealousy of Henry I.\" Bishop Walcher was of a mild and easy disposition. His humanity revolted from the idea of oppressing the inhabitants of the country himself; but indolence prevented him from seeing or from restraining the oppressions of his officers. The archdeacon Leof'win plundered the treasures of the church ; and the country groaned under the tyranny of Gilbert, AValcher's kinsman. Liulph, a Saxon noble, had ventured to accuse them before the prelate ; and, shortly afterwards, his house was beset in the night, and he himself was slain. Walcher publicly declared his innocence of the homicide, compelled the murderers to offer the legal compensation,* and engaged to act as mediator between them and the relations of Liulph Both parties met by agreement at Gateshead ; but the bishop, perceiving indications of violence among the people, retired into the church. It was set on fire. He first compelled tlie murderers to go out, who were immediately slain. Unable to bear the vio lence of the flames, he wrapped his mantle round his head, and appeared at the door. A voice immediately exclaimed, \" Good rede, short rede ;f slea yc the bishop C and he fell pierced with a number of wounds. The monks of Jarrow conveyed his naked body by water to their own monas tery, and afterwards to Durham, where it was privately interred. The king commissioned his bro ther Odo to avenge the death of Walcher. The guilty, who had attempted to surprise Durham, fled at his approach ; but Odo, thinking it unnecessary to discriminate between guilt and inno cence, executed without investigation such of the native inhabitants as fell into his hands, and ravaged the whole country. j * By the Saxon laws, murder, as well as other crimes, was punished by a pecuniary fine, the amount being proportioned to the rank of the suffering party. t An old proverb, meaning that the shortest counsel is the best. X The death of Walcher was predicted by a man named Eardulf, who rose from the dead at Ravensworth for that purpose. Whilst his friends were attending his funeral, he suddenly started bolt upright ; and, after the company were recovered from their fright by a proper quantity of holy water, he proceeded 'to relate to them all that he had seen and heard during a trance of twelve hours. He saw several of his former acquain tance in Paradise, and was an eye-witness ofthe torments which were preparing for several incorrigible sin ners yet living. His horrible description of the iron chair to which the evil spirits were to chain Waltheof, one of the bishop's murderers, and from which the darting flames hissed and crackled, is worthy of the pencil of a Hellish Breughels. \u2014 Simeon, lib, iii. c. 23. Eadulf, surnamed Rus, a relative of Liulph, is said to have been the person who killed -the bishop. He was soon after slain by a woman, and was buried at Jedvvord, from which place of sepulture his body was cast out by the command of Prior Turgot, and left to rot upon the earth."], [31, "GENERAL HISTORY. XXIII AAralcher is said to have intended to recal to the cathedral of Durham the monastic order, who had been superseded by the secular clergy. It is supposed that the latter assisted to stir up the discontent of the people against the bishop's administration. During his episcopacy, King William I. presented to the church several rich gifts, and restored Billingham to tlie see, which had been forcibly withheld for many years. He also gave to the see Howdenshire, in the county of York. William de Carilepho, 1080 \u2014 1095. The see remained vacant for six months till the nomination of AViUiam de Carilepho, abbot of St. A^incent's in Normandy, who was consecrated at Gloucester, January 3, 1082, by Thomas, archbishop of Canterbury, in the presence of the king. He was afterwards Chief Justice of Eng- land ; and Pope Gregory VII. issued a bull for the establishment or restitution of his see. He exerted himself in reviving peace and good order in his bishopric, and completed the design of Walcher, by translating the monks of AVearmouth and Jarrow to the cathedral, and distributing the seculars in the churches of Darlington, Auckland, and Norton. Soon after the accession of William Rufus, Carilepho joined with the Norman nobles who declared for Robert, elder brother to the king. On the discovery of the conspiracy, he fled to Normandy, and the royalists took pos- session of the city and castle of Durham. The temporaries of the see were held for the crown by Ivo Tailbois and Ernesius de Burone, and the appendages of Howden and AArells were severed from its patrimony. During the progress of the king to the north in 1091, however, he restored the bishop to his see and possessions, who commenced building the present magnificent cathedral. Falling a second time under the king's displeasure, and being obliged to obey a mandate to travel towards Windsor under the pressure of severe illness, he expired there January 6, 1095, and was interred in the Chapter-house at Durham. He has been represented by historians as possessing genius, talents, and learning, with a laudable simplicity of life and manners ; but also as ambitious, intriguing, and ungrateful. During his prelacy, AATilliam II. gave to the church the district of Alverton, and the convent of Durham received from Edgar of Scotland a grant of the abbey of Col dingham. Tynemouth, however, was wrested from the see by Mowbray, Earl of Northumberland. Ralph Flambard, 1099\u20141128. After a vacancy of four years, during which the temporaries, amounting to \u00a3300 a year, were held by the crown, AArilliam II. conferred the bishopric on his minister and favourite, Ralph, sur named Flambard (the devouring torch), as a compensation for an attempt which his enemies had made on his life ;* but compelled him, at the same time, to make him a present of _P1000. Bishop Flambard advised the king to retain in his own hands the prelacies and abbeys which became va cant ; arrested Anselm, archbishop of Canterbury, in the street ; and made a predatory irruption * Flambard was a Norman clergyman of obscure birth, ready wit, dissolute morals, and insatiable ambition. For his services in raising money by extortion, <&c., the king appointed him to the offices of royal chaplain, treasurer, and justiciary; and pronounced on him the eulogium, that he was the only man who, to please a master, was willing to brave the vengeance of the rest of mankind. One day, as Flambard was walking by the side ofthe Thames, Gerold, a mariner who had formerly been in his service, but now pretended to be a messenger from the bishop of London, requested him to step into a boat, and visit that prelate, whom he re- presented as lying at the point of death in a villa on the opposite bank. Unsuspicious of danger, Flambard complied ; but when the boat had conveyed him a little way down the river, he was forcibly put on board a ship, and carried out to sea. Fortunately, a storm arose: the men, who had engaged to murder him, quar relled ; Gerold was induced, by promises and entreaties, to put him on shore; and, on the third day, to the terror and amazement of his enemies, he appeared in his usual place at court \u2014 Lingard's Hist, of England^ vol. ii. ]>\u25a0 133."], [32, "XXIV GENERAL HISTORY. into Scotland. On the accession of Henry I., Flambard, loaded with popular odium, was commit ted to the Tower ; and the see of Durham was deprived of Carlisle, Hexham, and Tiviotdale. The prelate lived sumptuously in his confinement on the allowance which he received from the exche quer, and the presents which were sent him by his friends ; and by his wit, cheerfulness, and gene rosity, won the good will, while he lulled the vigilance, of his keepers. In the beginning of Fe bruary, 1101, he received a rope concealed in the bottom of a pitcher of wine. The knights who guarded him were as usual invited to dine: they drank copiously till it was late in the evening; and soon after they had lain down to rest, Flambard, with the aid of his rope, descended from tlie window, was conducted by his friends to the sea shore, and thence escaped to Duke Robert in Normandy. In consequence of the treaty which followed the duke's invasion of England, Flam bard was restored to his bishopric, though not to the royal favour. By successive charters, how ever, the palatine franchise was confirmed to the see ; Burdon, Carleton, and Aycliff'e, which had been claimed by the people of Northumberland, were restored ; and the bishop's right to the royal forests and chaces between Tyne and Tees was ratified. Excluded from political business, the bishop now employed himself in various public works: he erected the castle of Norham, founded Kepier Hospital, contributed to the building of the cathedral and other edifices of Durham, and by turns plundered, persecuted, and patronized the clergy of the priory. At length, feeling the ap proach of death, he was, by his own request, carried into the cathedral, where, in the presence of the prior and brethren, he made restitution, by the ceremony of offering his ring at the high altar, of the various possessions and privileges of the convent which he had detained or violated. Before his dissolution, he bequeathed his effects to the poor, and remitted all debts due to him : the crown, however, enforced the payment of the latter. Galfrid Rufus, 1133\u20141140. After the see had remained vacant five years, Galfrid Rufus, chancellor of England, was conse crated bishop of Durham, at York, August 6, 1133, by Archbishop Thurstan. He does not appear to have taken any active part in the troubles which happened during his episcopacy, though he preserved a strict adherence to the interests of King Stephen,* by whose authority he secured the liberties of his palatinate, and obtained a grant for the establishment of a mint. In his time, \u00c6lla fus, a priest, gave Coken to the see. Rufus died in 1140, and was buried in the Chapter-house at Durham. * David, king of Scotland, in 1136, penetrated as far as Newcastle; but Stephen having arrived at Dur ham, a precarious peace was concluded. In the next year, David reached Durham ; but the mutinous state of his army compelled him to retire, when he surprised and burnt the town and castle of Norham. The Scots soon after sustained a complete defeat in the memorable \" Battle of the Standard,\" which was fought on Cowton Moor, near Northallerton, on August 22, 1138. The English army was raised by Thurstan! arch bishop of York ; and they were animated to victory by the display of the consecrated host, contained in a silver casket, and elevated in the midst of the army on the mast of a ship fixed in the beam of a vast chariot, whilst around it waved the banners of St. AVilfrid, St. Johu, and St. Peter, the patrons of Ripon, Beverley, and York. AValter Espec, an experienced warrior, harangued the troops ; and, at the conclusion of his speech, giving his hand to AVilliam of Albemarle, he exclaimed in a loud voice, \"I pledge thee my troth either to conquer or die.\" His words kindled the enthusiasm of the troops ; they knelt on the ground ; the bishop ot the Orkneys, the representative of Thurstan, read the prayer of absolution from the carriage ; and, with a loud \" Amen !\" they rose to receive the shock of their enemies. Their wings were broken \u2022 but the centre was impenetrable ; and the Scottish army, after an arduous contest of two hours, wavered, broke, and fled. Of 2/000 men, nearly one half perished in the battle and flight. Leland says, \" The Scots threw away their baggage and the field of batle received the name of Baggamore.\" King David and his son escaped with difficulty to Carlisle."], [33, "GENERAL HISTORY. XXV The See usurped by AAllliam Cumin. William Cumin, a Scottish priest, and styled chancellor of that kingdom, had enjoyed the confi- dence of Bishop Rufus, and, on the prospect of his death, withdrew to Scotland, to solicit the as- sistance of the king in his projected attempt to seize on the vacant bishopric. The death of Rufus was concealed for some time ; and the two Bruses, Baliol, and Morevill, four powerful barons of the bishopric, in the interest of the Empress Maud, favoured the claims of Cumin. The prior and convent, however, as well as the papal legate, would not consent to his election, though promised by the empress and the king of Scotland that the convent of Durham would suffer no injury under his authority. In revenge, Cumin drove the archdeacon into exile ; and Roger Conyers of Bishop- ton, hereditary constable of the castle, was the only baron of the palatinate who refused to pay homage to the usurper. The latter caused several letters to be forged in the pope's name, ordering his election ; but a few of the monks went to Rome, and returned with an order enjoining the re- gular election of a superior. In spite of the precautions of Cumin, some of them escaped to York, and there made choice of William de St. Barbara, their dean, then absent in London. AVilliam de St. Barbara, 1143 \u2014 1152. The new prelate was with difficulty prevailed upon to accept the arduous office. On entering tlie palatinate, he received the support of Conyers; but on proceeding to Durham, in hope of the sub- mission of Cumin, the resistance offered by the forces of the latter compelled him to take refuge in the church of St. Giles, from whence he escaped to Bishopton. He afterwards took possession of the fortress of Thornlaw; and a succession of truces and hostilities for some time rapidly followed. It was at one time agreed, that, till a messenger could be sent to the holy see for instiuctions, Cumin should hold possession of Durham Castle, with one-third of the revenues of the lands between Tyne and Tees ; and every thing else within the bishopric was surrendered to the bishop elect. On a progress into Northumberland, however, the bishop was attacked by the nephew of the usurper, and escaped with difficulty into the church of Jarrow, from whence he fled for greater security to Lin- disfarn. In the meanwhile, Thornlaw was betrayed to Cumin ; and, though the Earl of Northum- berland retook it, ostensibly for the bishop, he garrisoned it with his own troops. An attempt was made to fortify the church of Merrington for Cumin ; and his forces, sallying out occasionally from Durham Castle, spread every where terror and devastation. (See Thornley, Bishopton, Sock- burn, Merrington, and City of Durham.) At length, at the request of Conyers, the bishop con- sented to an interview with Cumin, and, accompanied by the archbishop of York and the bishop of Carlisle, entered the city on the festival of St. Luke, 1144. But what was his surprise when he found his haughty adversary awaiting his arrival in the humble garb and attitude of a penitent ! Prostrate at the feet of the prelate, the sanguinary Cumin testified the deepest contrition for his offences, promised restitution to every one according to his power, and, influenced by whatever motives of penitence or necessity, surrendered without reserve or stipulation the whole of his power and possessions, committing himself and his followers to the entire discretion of the prelate.* The moderation of Bishop AVilliam imposed on his humbled opponent no other than ecclesiastical penance; and it is added that he even granted or confirmed to the younger Cumin the castle of Northallerton. The bishop was enthroned October 18, 1144; and his first cares were to restore the ruined churches and public buildings of his bishopric, and to alleviate the distresses his people * On this remarkable occurrence, Surtees says, \" It is still more strange that the monastic authors have permitted so interesting an event to remain unillustrated by the interposition of vision, prophecy, or miracle.\" VOL.

Plis person was venerable, his manners simple and dignified, his eloquence warm and impressive, and his disposition benevolent. He died November 14, 1152, and was buried in the Chapter-house. Hugh Pudsey, 1153\u20141194. The prior and archdeacon of Durham having each claimed the vacant see, the election of a third person was rendered necessary; and the choice of the convent fell on Hugh Pudsey, Puzas, or Puteaco, a secular priest, nephew of King Stephen, and bishop of Winchester, then only 25 years of ao-e. The archbishop of York objected to the election, excommunicated the convent of Durham, and refused to remit the sentence till the parties underwent the penance of the ivhip in the church of Beverley. After this ceremony, Pudsey with a splendid train departed for Rome, received con secration from the pontiff', and returned to Durham, where he was enthroned with universal assent. In the disputes between Henry II. and his rebellious sons, some suspicion of Pudsey's fidelity seems to have been justly entertained ; and he purchased his safety by the payment of a heavy fine, and the surrender of his castles of Durham, Norham, and Northallerton. In 1185, he was one of the persons employed in settling the affairs of Galloway. During the preparations of Richard I. for the crusade, Bishop Pudsey took the vow of the cross, extorted money in his diocese for the expe dition, and fitted up a beautiful galley for his passage; but he was dissuaded from his intention by the king, who, in consideration of a large sum, gratified the bishop's ambition by giving him the earldom of Northumberland for life, and annexing the shire or wapontake of Sadberge in perpe tuity to the bishopric (see Sadberge). An additional present of 1000 marks procured him the offices of justiciary of England and governor of AVindsor; and, on the division of the kingdom into two districts, the government north of Humber was committed to his charge. Richard had not long quitted England, however, before the bishop of Ely refused to admit Pudsey as his com peer in the government ; and the latter, being decoyed to London, was committed prisoner to the Tower, and obtained his enlargement only by the cession of his government of Windsor, of the town of Newcastle upon Tyne, and of his newly-acquired earldom of Northumberland. His son Henry, and Gilbert de la Leya, one of his chief barons, were given up as hostages for the due per formance of this compact ; and he was restricted to residence within the liberties of Howden. From this state of thraldom he was not released till the deposition of his rival by the En<dish barons. AArhen Richard I. was imprisoned by the emperor of Austria, Bishop Pudsey, under the plea of raising a supply to redeem him from captivity, extorted immense sums from his vassals, of which he remitted 2000 pounds of silver ; and he also redeemed, at the price of 100 marks, the plate and ornaments ofthe church, which had been put in requisition for the same purpose. On the kind's return, Pudsey offered him 2000 marks for the restitution of Sadberge and his former honours ; but whilst on his road to London with the money, he was seized with a fatal disease at Craike, under the pressure of which he pushed on to Doncaster, but was thence compelled to return to Howden. He ordered restitution, by his will, to all whom he had injured ; gave the vill of Newton, which he hail purchased, to the convent ; and desired that his contract with the king might be completed in favour of his successors. He died March 3, 1191, and was buried in the Chapter-house. Amongst the numerous undertakings and public works completed by this enterprising and opulent prelate may be enumerated the interesting record called the Boldon Book,* his additions to the cathedral * This curious survey affords much valuable information respecting the state of society in that a^e and has been frequently quoted as authority in courts of justice.

XXVII and castle of Durham, Elvet bridge, his foundation charter to the burgesses of the city, Finchale priory, the church at Darlington, and many other magnificent edifices. He left three natural sons, born before his elevation to the bishopric. After his death, the temporalties of the see were held for the crown, successively, by Hugh Bardolf, by the aichdcacon of Hereford, and by Richard Briwere and Gilbert Fitz-Reinfred. Philip de Pictavia, 1195 \u2014 1208. Philip of Poictou, a native of Aquitainc, one of the king's privy counsellors and chief favourites, was appointed to the bishopric January 11, 1195. Not being in priest's orders, he received them from the bishop of Llandaff', June 13, 1196 ; and was consecrated at Rome by Pope Celestine, April 20, 1197- He frequently exercised the regal privileges of his palatine jurisdiction ; and, in 1199, refused leave to Patric, governor of Scotland, to abut any part of Berwick bridge, which had been swept away by a flood, on the territories of the palatinate, but afterwards gave his consent, stipu lating for the rights of the see. But the most prominent part of his character was his violent perse cution of the monks of Durham. He placed the convent in a state of siege, forbade tlie importation of provisions, blocked up the passage to the abbey mill, demolished the common furnace or oven in Elvet, destroyed the fish-wears at Finchale, and killed the cattie at Beaurepaire. He even sur rounded the cathedral with soldiers, applied fire and smoke to the doors and windows, and dragged the prior and officiating minister from the altar during the celebration of the festival of St. Cuthbert. In some interval of reconciliation or remorse, however, he gave the church of Billingham to the con vent. Having supported King John in his resistance to the see of Rome, he was excommunicated, and, dying under the sentence, was buried in unconsecrated ground, and without ceremony. During the quarrels between the pope and King John, the ecclesiastics privately elected to the bishopric Richard, dean of Salisbury ; but the papal legate afterwards nominated John Grey, bishop of Norwich. He died before his confirmation ; and the convent elected Morgan, prior of Beverley, a natural son of Henry II., and whose consecration was impeded by the reigning king on account of his illegitimacy. Richard de Marisco, 1217\u20141226. After a vacancy of nine years from the death of Philip, Richard de Marisco, chancellor of Eng land, was nominated by the papal legate, and consecrated June 24, 1218. He was joined in com mission with the archbishop of York to absolve the king and realm of Scotland from the censures of the Roman church. In 1224, he had by some means incurred the royal displeasure; and the prior and monks of Durham having sustained serious injuries from his extravagance and exactions, they accused him before the pope \" of bloodshed, simony, adultery, sacrilege, rapine, and perjury.''1 Mutual bribery and artifice protracted the litigation ; until the bishop, hastening to London in 1226 for the prosecution of his suits, rested for the night at the abbey of Peterborough, and was found lifeless in his bed in the morning. His body was conveyed to Durham for interment in the Chapter-house. His prodigality left the see encumbered with a debt of _\u00a3?11,000. Richard Poor, 1228\u20141237- The king recommended his chaplain, Luke, as the successor of Marisco; but the convent made choice of William de Stichell, archdeacon of AVorcester. The pope pronounced the election void ; on which the monks chose Richard Poor, late dean, but now bishop of Salisbury, who had been once before elected to the see in 1213, and who, after some delay, procured a decree for his trans-"], [36, "GENERAL HISTORY. XXVIII lation, May 14, 1228; had restitution of the temporaries July 22, and was enthroned at Durham September 4. The king retained the castles of Durham and Norham. Bishop Poor discharged the debt which his predecessor had left on the see, and terminated the disputes with the convent by a solemn act of convention in 1231. He died in 1237, at Tarrent in Dorsetshire, his native place, and where he had founded a monastery. His body was removed for sepulture to Durham, and his heart was buried at Tarrent. King Henry III. sent letters recommending the election of the procurator of A^alentia to the bishopric ; but the convent chose Prior Melsonby. The king resisted the election, because Mel sonby had formerly taken the oath of allegiance to Scotland, with other frivolous pretences ; and, after a struggle of three years, the bishop elect relinquished his claims. Nicholas de Farnham, 1241 \u2014 1249-* The king now recommended his kinsman, Peter de Egroblanch ; but the ecclesiastics, to preserve their privileges, on January 2, 1241, chose Nicholas de Farnham, a person of unexceptionable character, and physician to the queen. The court acquiesced in the nomination, and the new pre late was consecrated at Gloucester, on Trinity Sunday, by the archbishop of York, in the presence of the king, and was enthroned at Durham on the ensuing festival of St. Cuthbert. He had al ready refused the see of Coventry, and accepted that of Durham with reluctance. After presidincr eight years, during which he was at one time ordered to remain in the county for its defence ao-ainst the Scots, he voluntarily resigned the bishopric in 1249; reserving, as an honourable provision for life, the manors of Howden, Easington, and Stockton, producing an annual revenue of 1000 marks. His successor in vain attempted to disturb this provision, and the evening of his life was spent in ease and retirement at his manor of Stockton, where he expired in 1257- Walter de Kirkham, 1249 \u2014 1260. Waving the recommendation of Adelmar de Aralencia, the king's uterine brother, on account of his youth and want of learning, the convent elected AValter de Kirkham, dean of York, on April 21, 1249; and he was consecrated on the Sth of December following. He founded the cell of Warkworth, and was employed in some commissions in Scotland. In 1255, he excommunicated some of the servants of John Baliol, who, in revenge, laid an ambush, which attacked and ill-treated the bishop, and took four of his attendants as hostages. The king declared this outrage a violation of the bishop's royal franchise, and commanded the release of the prisoners (see Long-Newton). In 1259, the burgesses of Newcastle obtained an exemption from attendance on the bishops, arch deacons, and officials, in places situated at an inconvenient distance from the borough. Bishop Kirkham died at Hoveden, August 9, 1260, and his body was conveyed to Durham for interment in the Chapter-house ; when his great seal was publicly broken by John Gileth, his temporal chan cellor, being the first recorded instance of such a ceremony. Robert de Stichell, 1260 \u2014 1274. Robert de Stichell, prior of Finchale, was elected by the convent, September 30, 1260, had res titution December 5, and was consecrated at Southwell, by the archbishop of York, February 13 * In this year died AVilliam Shirwood, otherwise AVilliam of Durham. He was educated at University College, Oxford, and at Paris ; and was afterwards made chancellor of Lincoln. In his time, the university of Oxford was interdicted for some affronts offered to the pope's legate; and it was principally through the influence ot (shirwood that the interdict was removed. \" In that age,\" says Fuller, \"the English clergy did drive a great trade of preferment in France (King Henry the Third having large dominions therein*)\" and amongst the rest this AViUiam was advanced Archbishop of Roan, where he died.\""], [37, "GENERAL HISTORY. XXIX 1261.* During his prelacy, the kingdom was shaken by the power and ambition of the Montforts ; and, from a list of knights inserted in the Boldon Book, the whole force of the palatinate seems to have been arrayed beneath the royal banners at the battle of Lewes. On the re-establishment of the throne, the manor of Greatham, part of the forfeited estates of Peter de Montfort, was seized by the crown ; but the bishop, on asserting his royal franchise, obtained restitution, and built and endowed the hospital of Greatham out of the forfeited possessions (see Greatham). He erected Howden into a collegiate church, with the concurrence of the convent, with whom he lived in cor diality. Having attended a general council at Lyons in 1274, he was seized on his road homeward with a mortal disease, and died on the 4th of August, at a castle in France called Arbipellis, where his body was interred; but his heart was brought to Durham, and buried in the Chapter-house. Robert de Insula, 1274 \u2014 1283. On the 24th of September succeeding the death of Stichell, the see was filled by the election of Robert de Insula, f prior of Finchale. The temporalties were restored November 11, and he was consecrated at York on the 9th of the following month. In 1276, he held a synod within his dio cese, and enacted several ecclesiastical constitutions relative to tithes and other dues. He received a royal mandate, 11th Edward I., to furnish a sum of money for the king's Welch expedition. Having quarrelled with the king of Scotland respecting the excesses committed by the Borderers, a royal commission was issued to settle the dispute ; but the ambitious plans of Edward with regard to Scotland prevented an adjustment. Bishop de Insula gave the church of Middleham to Fin chale priory, and exchanged with the convent of Durham that of Meldon for AValdenestow in Lincolnshire. He died at the castle of Middleham, June 9, 1283, and was interred in the Chapter house. During a month, in which the temporalties were collected for the crown, the sum amounted to i?1303, 6s. 8d. The archbishop of York having come to Durham to claim the supremacy, the inhabitants attacked and drove him out of the city. Anthony Beck, 1283\u20141310. The convent, July 19, 1283, chose Anthony Beck, archdeacon of Durham, and son of AValter Beck, baron of Eresby in Lincolnshire. He purchased the effects of his predecessor, which, with * He was the illegitimate son of a priest, which formed a canonical objection to his ecclesiastical prefer ment, but had formerly obtained a dispensation by unsolicited patronage on account of his merit. He was bred a monastic at Durham, and during his noviciate incurred, for some youthful levity, the shame of public penance. He had even determined to apostatize from a religious life, and was actually endeavouring to make his escape from the convent, when he was arrested by a miraculous voice or impression, which occasioned an entire change in his character, and laid the foundation of his future honours. \u2014 Graystanes, c. 7 + This name was probably assumed from the place of his birth. The Monk of AVaverley calls him in English Halieland, and the Monk of Lanercost, R. de Coquina. It is not improbable that he had been em- ployed in some menial office in the convent ; and it is certain that he was not afterwards ashamed to own the meanness of his birth, as is evinced by the following characteristic anecdote, quoted by Surtees from Graystanes : \u2014 \" The bishop was once at Norham, and the Lord of Scremerston (a little fortress then belong- ing to the Swinnows) sent him a present of some country ale. The bishop had been long disused to such humble beverage, yet, from respect to the donor, and to the good report of the liquor, he tasted a cup of it : ' et non suslinens statim a mensa surgens evomuit.' ' See,' said he, ' the force of custom ; you all know my origin, and that neither from my parents nor my country I can derive any taste for wine, and yet now my country liquor is rendered utterly distasteful to me.' To his mother he gave a train of male and female ser- vants, and an honourable establishment. Once, when he went to see her, ' And how fares my sweet mother ?' said he. ' Never worse,' quoth she. ' And what ails thee, or troubles thee ? hast thou not men and women, and attendants sufficient?' ' Yea,' quoth she, 'and more than enough ; I say to one, Go, and he runs; to another, Come hither, fellow, and the varlet falls down on his knee ; and in short all things go on so abomi nably smooth, that my heart is bursting for something to spite me, and pick a quarrel withal.' \" vol. i. h"], [38, "GENERAL HISTORY. XXX the temporalties, he received on September 4, and was consecrated at York by the archbishop on the 9th of January following.* He was enthroned at Durham on Christmas-eve, 1285 ; when a dispute having arisen between the official of the archbishop of York and the prior of Durham, as to who should perform the ceremony, the bishop elect decided the debate by receiving the mitre from his own brother, the bishop of St. David's. His ambitious spirit kept pace with the splen dour of his rank and the extent of his possessions; and, during his episcopacy, he was almost con tinually at variance with his convent. He was frequently employed in the negotiations of the period between the English and Scottish nations; and Fordun attributes to his advice the prefer ence which King Edward gave to the claims of Baliol over those of Bruce. When that monarch invaded Scotland, the bishop of Durham attended him in all the pomp and splendour of a palatine prince : 26 standard-bearers of his own household, and 140 knights, formed his train ; and 1000 foot and 500 horse marched in the van of the army under the consecrated banner of St. Cuthbert, which was borne bv Henry de Horncastre, a monk of the house of Durham. The bishop was present at several engagements, in one of which he is said to have been wounded ; and, at the de cisive victory of Falkirk, he led the second line of the English army, with 39 banners.-!- But it was not in the affairs of Scotland only that Beck was employed; for, in 1292, he was sent into Germany to conclude an alliance with the Emperor Adolph against France ; and in 1295, he dis tinguished himself by his eloquence and address, in a conference with two cardinals whom the pope had sent to England to treat of a reconciliation between Edward and the French monarch. The king, however, regarded with some jealousy the growing power and ambition of Beck ; and this feeling was inflamed by the prelate's acquirement of Hart, including Hartlepool, and of the fortress and domain of Barnard Castle ; the former forfeited by Bruce, and the latter by Baliol. The bishop had, it seems, required more than the accustomed military services from the tenants of St. Cuthbert, who pleaded their privilege of Haliwerfolc (holy-work-people) not to march beyond the Tees or the Tyne ; and they petitioned parliament on the subject. He had also forcibly ejected Prior Hotoun, who appealed to the pope, and the bishop was summoned to Rome. Far from bending to the storm, he appeared in his place in parliament ; and, on being asked by Edward I. whether he stood with him against the Earl Marshal, the Earl of Hereford, and other barons of tlie realm, he replied, \" That those personages were assiduous in the promotion of the honour and interest of the king and the realm, therefore he stood with them, and not with the king against them.\" Having gone to Rome in obedience to a second summons from the pope, the palatinate was seized by the crown, under the plea that the bishop had left the realm without licence. At Rome he appeared with his usual splendour, and triumphed over his adversaries, obtaining from the pontiff' a confirmation of his visitorial superiority over the convent. On his return, he o-ained by some concessions, a restitution of his temporalties. But the respite was of short duration : Beck's haughty spirit again involved him in disputes with the prior, who obtained a favourable audience at Rome; and the bishop, being accused in parliament of having infringed the privileges * In revenge for his treatment by the mob at Durham, the archbishop, on the next day. enjoined Beck to excommunicate the prior and heads ofthe convent; but he refused, saying, \"I was consecrated their bishop yesterday, and shall I excommunicate them to-day ? No profession of obedience shall induce me to commit so inconsistent an act.\" t \" Hasting forth to be the first that should give the onset, when his men approached near the enemy, the bishop commanded them to stay till the kirk battell, which the king led, might approach. But that valliant knight the lord Ralph Bassett of Draiton, said to him, ' Mv lord, you may goe and say masse, which better becometh you than to teach us what we have to do ; for we will do that which belongeth to the order and custom of war.' \" \u2014 Hollingsh. p. 307-"], [39, "GENERAL HISTORY. XXXI of the crown, was again deprived of his temporalties; Barnard Castle was severed from the palati nate, and bestowed on Beauchamp, Earl of AArarwick ; and Hartlepool was given to Robert de Clifford. After the death of Edward I., Bishop Beck joined with the flatterers who crowded round the throne of his successor; and, by ingratiating himself into the royal favour, he was repossessed of his bishopric: but, as Barnard Castle and Hartlepool were in the possession of powerful nobles, whom it might have been dangerous to offend, the loss was compensated to the ambitious prelate by the regal dignity of the Isle of Man. He had already obtained from Rome the titular pa triarchate of Jerusalem ; and he thus emerged from his former disgrace, with the accumulated dignities of bishop, count palatine, patriarch, and king. He is described as the richest prelate (except AVolsey) that ever held the see of Durham;* for, besides the ample revenues of his bish- opric, he possessed an estate worth 5000 marks a year, part of which, it is said, he gained by un justly selling the barony and castle of Alnwick, which he held in trust for the natural son of the Baron de Vescy. His last public act was joining the party of the Earl of Lancaster against Piers Gaveston, in the parliament of Westminster, 1310. On the 3d of March, in the same year, he ex pired at Eltham Hall, in Kent, which he had erected. He was the first prelate of Durham who was buried within the walls of the cathedral ; all his predecessors having been restrained by reve rence for the body of St. Cuthbert. On this occasion, from some motive of superstition, the corpse was not allowed to enter tlie doors ; but a passage was broken through the wall for its reception in the eastern transept. Under the splendid episcopacy of this bishop, the palatine power reached its highest elevation. The court of Durham exhibited all the appendages of royalty, the most powerful barons doing homage and filling the offices of state; and the appearance of the prelate in public was that of a military chief. He seized the king's palfrey as a deodand, it having killed its rider in the way to Scotland, within the liberties of the palatinate. The public works of Bishop Beck were numerous. He founded the colleges of Chester-le-Street and Lanchester, erected towers at Gainford and Conis- cliffe, and added to the buildings of Alnwick and Barnard Castles. He gave Even wood to the convent, and appropriated the vicarage of Morpeth to the chapel which he had sounded at Auck land. Notwithstanding his great expenses, he left immense treasures in the riches of the age ; gallant horses, costly robes, rich furniture, plate, and jewels. His character was ambitious, bold, proud, and liberal ; but temperate, chaste,-{- and active. Richard Kellow, 1311 \u2014 1316. Though pressed by the rival claims of the crown and the see of York, the convent, on March 31, 1311, elected Richard Kellow, a monk of Durham, who received the royal assent at Berwick on April 11, was presented to the archbishop at Newbrough on the 19th of the same month, examined at Hexham on the 4th of May, and confirmed at Ripon on the 11th ; on the 20th received restitu- * Once, upon a great dearth in London, he gave forty shillings (a very large sum in those days) for forty herrings.

This matter cost him a very large sum of money. \u2014 Ibid."], [40, "GENERAL HISTORY. XXXII tion of the temporalties, was consecrated at York ten days after, and solemnly enthroned at Dur ham on the festival of St. Cuthbert in September. During his episcopacy, the greatest harmony subsisted between him and the people of the palatinate. He observed the strictest impartiality in the exercise of his authority, and never spared an offender on account of his rank, as appeared by his compelling Ralph Neville to do penance for the heinous sin of incest with his daughter. The period of Kellow's prelacy, however, was unfortunate. In 1312, Bruce made an inroad into the palatinate, surprised Durham, and fired and plundered Hartlepool ; and a precarious truce was purchased for 1000 marks. In the mean while, a race of lawless banditti, called shevalds, assem bled in the forests and mountains of Northumberland, and levied plunder and contribution. Pa tric Kellow, the prelate's brother, who had been sent against them, defeated them in Holy Island ; and their captain, John de AVedale, perished in the action. The king, provoked because his fa vourite Gaveston had been denied a refuge in the palatinate, endeavoured, with strange ingratitude, to bring Patric Kellow to the block for the alleged murder of Wedale ; and the bishop only re gained the royal favour by a levy of 1500 men, a present of 1000 marks, and a charger splendidly caparisoned, when the monarch was on his march into Scotland. After the defeat at Bannockburn, this county was again exposed to repeated and destructive inroads by the Scots: Beaurepaire was destroyed, and Hartlepool again burnt. Famine followed in the track of war ; and the Marches of the two kingdoms were reduced to a state of desolation which had not been felt since the days of the Norman tyrant. The accounts of contemporary historians are almost too highly coloured to meet belief. Prisoners devoured each other in the gaols, and mothers hid their children lest they should furnish a repast equally horrid. In the midst of these calamities, Kellow expired on the eve of St. Denis, 1316, at his manor-house of Middleham ; and, at his own request, was inter red in the Chapter-house. He built the manor-houses of Stockton and the AVelhall, and he gave to the convent the lands and fishery of AArascrophead in AVeardale. The see of Durham now became an object of contention amongst various interests ; the king, the queen, and the Earls of Lancaster and Hereford each proposing a candidate for the episcopal throne. They were, however, all refused by the monks, who held themselves independent of every influence, and, in direct opposition to those distinguished individuals, elected Henry de Stamford, prior of Finchale, as their future bishop. The king would have confirmed the choice of the con vent, had it not been for his queen, who fell on her knees, saying, \" My liege, I never yet asked any thing for my kindred ; if you bear me affection, grant me that my cousin, Lewis de Bello monte, be bishop of Durham.\" Overcome by this petition, the king refused his confirmation, and sent letters to the see of Rome in favour of Lewis, for whom the king of France also used his in fluence with the pope.

At Darlington, they were warned by a messenger from the prior that tlie road was beset by marauders ; but the notice was treated with neglect or suspicion. When they reached Rushyford, they were intercepted by Gilbert de Middleton and Walter de Selby (two barons whom the necessities of the times had driven to adopt the lawless life of freebooters) at the head of a troop of light armed horsemen, who robbed the cardinals and their attendants of all their valuables, and conveyed the bishop and his noble brother to Mitford Castle in Northumberland, insisting on a heavy ransom for their liberty. The treasures of the church were cheerfully lavished on this occasion ; and after the convent of Durham had given security for the payment of a heavy ransom, the captives were liberated.* The bishop was consecrated at Westminster, March 26, 1318, and received possession of his temporalties on the 4th of May following. On account of his ignorance of the Latin tongue, he made a despicable appearance at his consecration, while attempting to read the papal bull, which he had been taught to spell for several preceding days, but could not, after all, utter it intelligibly. AVhen he came to the word metropolitice, he scratched his head over it for some time, and at last cried out, in his mother tongue, \" Soit pour diet\" (Let us suppose it read). Then, reading to the word \u0153nigmate, he could proceed no further, but, with a vacant grin, which was intended to express facetiousness, he exclaimed, \" Par Seynt Lowys il ne fu pas curteis qui ceste parole ici escrite\"\" (By St. Lewis, it is not courteous that this word is written here). His ingratitude to the convent, who had redeemed him from durance, was displayed by the most capricious exercise of power, and the most childish expressions of enmity. \" Do nothing for me,\" he said, \" as I do nothing for you ; pray for my death, for whilst I live you shall have no favour from me.\" He was only prevented by his council from seizing a large portion of their possessions. During the preparations of Edward II. for invading Scotland, tlie Scots made an irruption into the bishopric, and laid its eastern district in ashes. Edward's expedition was unsuccessful, and his enemies penetrated within 20 miles of York. He reproached Beaumont for his supineness ; but the latter was engaged in a dispute with the archbishop of York concerning the right of visita- tion in Allertonshire, and he opposed the metropolitan, whenever he came thither, with an armed force. On the accession of Edward III., Beaumont claimed in parliament the restitution of Bar- nard Castle and Hartlepool to the see ; but though he obtained a mandate for that purpose, these places were not surrendered to him. In 1327 occurred another irruption of the Scots into this county, in which they eluded the vengeance of Edward himself (see Stanhope) ; and a trifling claim of the bishop was the cause of a new war. He died suddenly at Brantingham, co. York, September 28, 1333, and was interred near the high altar of his cathedral. His person, being lame, was undignified ; and his folly was only equalled by his rapacity on one hand, and his prodigality on the other. His public works were confined to the building of a spacious hall and kitchen, and a chapel, at Middleham ; and he gave half the vill of Edmondbyers to the convent. Richard Bury, 1333\u20141345. The convent had elected the venerable Robert Graystanes, the historian of their church ; but the king having solicited the bishopric from the court of Rome for his chaplain, Richard Bury, Gray stanes found it prudent to resign.

In the following year, he was appointed high chancellor, and, in 1336, treasurer of England. Amidst the confusion of the war in Scotland, the palatinate does not appear to have been implicated ; though the bishop issued a commission of array in 1343, and levied a subsidy of dC160 for a truce. He had been employed in various negotiations in France ; and, in obedience to the king's mandate, he issued his precept to prevent the importation of bulls, or other papal instruments, prejudicial to the king and the state. He vindicated his right to royal fish ; two whales and two sturgeon having been cast on the coast within his manor of Howden. In the 12th year of his episcopacy, he placed all the shipping of the palatinate in requisition for the passage of troops to Scotland, and furnished 20 men at arms and 20 archers. He was most distinguished, however, for his learning and charity. Every week, he caused eight quarters of wheat to be made into bread,' and gave it to the poor ; and he also dis tributed large sums of money as he travelled in different parts of his diocese. But the noblest in stance of his generosity was the extensive public library which he founded at Oxford, for the use of the students of Durham, now Trinity College, f He is said to have possessed more books than all the other bishops in England ; and he constantly kept binders, illuminators, and writers, in his palaces. The famous Petrarch was his friend and correspondent. After a long sickness, he died at Auckland, April 14, 1345, and was interred with moderate pomp on the 21st of the same month, in the west angle of the cathedral. Thomas Hatfield, 1345\u20141381. On May 8, 1345, Thomas Hatfield, keeper of the privy seal, was elected to the vacant see : he was consecrated on the 9th of July, and enthroned at Durham, by Prior Fossour, on Christmas day. I He was descended from an honourable family in Holderness, and was educated amongst the secular clergy, but had carried arms in France; from whence, perhaps, are drawn some charges of clerical incapacity. In the year after his election occurred the celebrated battle of Neville's Cross (see City of Durham); and, in 1348, he received a grant of 400 marks from the nobles and com monalty of the province, on account of the great expenses which he had incurred in his military * He had been preceptor to Prince Edward (afterwards Edward III.), and, in 1325, was treasurer of Guienne, where he afforded an asylum to the queen and prince when driven into exile by the Despensers. His life was hazarded on this occasion ; he was pursued to Paris by emissaries of the favourites, and took sanctuary, during seven days, in the church of Friars Minors. On \"the accession of Edward, that monarch loaded him with honours and preferments. He first made him his cofferer, then treasurer ofthe wardrobe archdeacon of Northampton, prebendary of Lincoln, Sarum, and Lichfield, and afterwards keeper of the privy seal ; which latter office he held five years, and was during that period sent twice ambassador to the pope, who made him his head chaplain, and gave him a rochet, in the place of a hull, for the first vacant bishopric in England. He was allowed, whenever he approached the presence of the pope or cardinals to be attended by 20 clerks and 3(5 esquires, dressed in uniform vestments. He then possessed English be'ne fices to the value of 5000 marks a year, and was promoted to the deanery of AVells only a few months before he was enthroned at Durham. r He wrote a treatise, oalled [Phihbibhs, containing rules for the government of this library, &c. ; from whence he himself was called Philobiblos, a lover of books.

The remainder of his episcopacy was spent in peace, during which he exhibited those political excellencies so essentially necessary in the exercise of his palatine authority, and preserved both his personal dignity and mental faculties to a great age He rebuilt or repaired many edifices belonging to the see, and also erected a sumptuous palace in the Strand, London, (now the Adelphi buildings) for the residence of himself and successors whilst attending parliament, &c. He enlarged the endowment of Durham College, Oxford, and gave 4000 marks \"for making more fit and convenient buildings there.\" In 1354, during an embargo, the king issued his mandate to his admiral of the north seas, to grant Bishop Hatfield three ships from the ports of Tyne and Hartlepool, properly equipped and manned, to convey him to parlia ment; and, in 1377i the sovereign granted an inhibition against the archbishop of York's visitations and extortions within the see of Durham. After a tedious illness, Bishop Hatfield died at Alford, near London, on the 8th of May, 1381 ; having bequeathed to the convent of Durham all his stock in Weardale, 300 marks in silver, and all his jewels and ornaments, together with \"a thorn ofthe crown which Christ wore during his passion !\" H\u00e6 was interred in the magnificent tomb which he had erected in the cathedral. A very indecent controversy, which arose betwixt the sacrist and the bishop's executors, was composed by the interference of Lord Neville, and the chariot, horses, and other apparatus of the funeral, were redeemed by the executors at the price of 200 marks. John Fordham, 1381\u20141388 John Fordham, prebendary of York and Lincoln, secretary to the king, and soon after lord treasurer, was elected on the Thursday after the feast of St. Augustine, 1381, consecrated at Lambeth on the eve of the Epiphany, and enthroned at Durham September 22, 1382. He was one of those evil counsellors who inflamed the passions and precipitated the ruin of Richard II. His interest with that monarch procured a royal confirmation of the palatine rights, and in particular of the bishop's privileges on the south side of the water of Tyne. He voted against the opinions of AArickliff', and protested in parliament against the exclusion of the spiritual peers from sitting in judgment in cases of blood. In 1388, the king reluctantly submitted to Fordham's deprivation and banishment from court ; but he was permitted to retire to the see of Ely, where he survived to extreme old age, and died in 1425. AValter Skirlaw, 1388\u20141405. The barons by whose interest Fordham was removed, obtained a bull for the translation of AAral ter Skirlaw from the see of Bath and AA7ells, to which he had been removed from Lichfield and Coventry. He was a native of Skirlaugh, in the parish of Swire, in Holderness,* where he erected a handsome Gothic church. He repaired many public edifices in the diocese; and the bridges at Shincliffe, Yarm, and Auckland, owe their origin to his munificence. He began building the clois ters at Durham cathedral, and, leaving the work unfinished, gave by will =C400 for its completion. He also expended 330 marks on the dormitory. In University College, Oxford, he founded and endowed three scholarships. Bishop Skirlaw died in peace and honour, March 24, 1405, and was buried in Durham cathedral, between two pillars of the north aisle of the choir. The custody of the temporalties was committed for a few months to Prince John of Lancaster. * Surtees mentions a tradition that he was the son of a sieve-maker ; and his arms, six osier wands in terlaced, are thought to allude to the occupation of his parent. A similar origin has been ascribed to Bishop Sever."], [44, "GENERAL HISTORY. XXXVI Cardinal Thomas Langley, 1406 \u2014 1437- Thomas Langley, dean of York, and high chancellor of England, was elected to this see May 17> 1406, when it is said he resigned the great seal. He was consecrated by the primate of Canter bury in St. Paul's cathedral, August 8, and received restitution of the temporalties on the follow ing day. In 1411, he acted as a commissioner on the Scottish Border; and, in the same year, he received the cardinal's hat from Pope John XXIII. In 1414, he was sent ambassador to France; and, in 1417, he again accepted the office of lord high chancellor, in which he continued till the accession of Henry VI. in 1422, when he resigned it. At tlie request of parliament, he resumed the seals in 1423, and finally resigned them in 1425, when he withdrew himself from the business of the state, and directed his attention to the affairs of his palatinate. In 1407, ne 'la^ obtained from the crown a royal charter, which confirmed the liberties and privileges granted to the preced ing bishops since the establishment of the see. In 1415, he recovered, by suit in the king's court, the third part of Tyne bridge, with the tower on the south end, against the mayor and commonalty of Newcastle. He issued several commissions of array, and levied subsidies in support of the wars of the time. In 1424, he was one of the commissioners who met at Durham to discuss the terms of a marriage between James, king of Scotland, and Jane Beaufort, of the royal blood of Lancaster. His public works were munificent and numerous. He repaired the chapel of the Galilee,* assisted in completing the cloisters, built the old gaol with its gateway, founded two schools on the Palace Green (see City of Durham), and was a benefactor to the public libraries of Cambridge, Oxford, Leicester, and Manchester. He died November 20, 1437, an<l was buried within a chantry which he had founded in the Galilee. Robert Neville, 1437 \u2014 1457- By the interest of Richard Earl of Salisbury, his brother, Robert Neville, fourth son of Ralph Earl of Westmoreland, was translated from the see of Salisbury to Durham, January 27, 1437-8; received the temporalties April 8, 1438; and was enthroned at Durham on the 11th of the same month. By his mother, Joan of Lancaster, sister of Henry IV., he was nearly related to the reio-n ing sovereign ; aud his family claimed alliance with all the ancient nobility and gentry of the north. His life appears to have passed in dignified retirement and tranquillity ; the only public business in which he occurs being the negotiation of truces with Scotland; transactions which frequently took place at Durham. He built the Exchequer on the Palace Green. His death occurred July 8, 1457- By his will, he requested burial in the Galilee, near the reliques of the Venerable Bede ; but, by order of his executors, he was interred with his ancestors in the south aisle of the cathedral. Laurence Booth, 1457 \u2014 1476. King Henry VI. solicited the bishopric for his physician, John Arundel ; but the prevailing in terest of Queen Margaret was successfully employed with Pope Calistus in favour of her chaplain, Laurence Booth. He had been successively provost of Beverley, head of Pembroke Hall in Cam! bridge, canon of York and of Lichfield, archdeacon of Richmond, and dean of St. Paul's ; and, at the time of his elevation to the see of Durham, he held the privy seal and was chancellor to'the \u2022 With a degree of feeling not always found in unison with the observances of devotion, he procured per mission from the pope to place a font in the Galilee, where persons labouring under sentence of excommuni cation were allowed to bring their children to receive baptism, and to partake themselves of the sacramental offices."], [45, "GENERAL HISTORY. XXXVII queen. During the civil wars which followed, he was attached by gratitude and affection to the house of Lancaster; and, on the proscription of the Earl of Warwick in 1459, the bishop took possession of his large estates in the palatinate. In the battle of Towton, 1461, the Earl of North- umberland, Lords Clifford, Grey, and Dacres, Sir John Neville, and a long list of the northern gentry, were amongst the slain. In the following year, King Edward IV. seized the temporalties of the see, and retained them till the year 1464: he also dispensed with the bishop's attendance in parliament for three years. From this time, Booth's conduct was marked by submission to the ruling powers ; and the Earl of Warwick's estates were confirmed to him under the privy seal, 1471. In 1473, he was appointed chancellor of England; and, in 1476, was translated to the me- tropolitan see of York, being the first prelate of Durham who was removed to the archbishopric. The only public works attributed to him within this county were the erection of the gates at Auck land, and some additions to the college there. AVilliam Dudley, 1476\u20141483. AVilliam Dudley, dean of Windsor, was elected bishop of Durham on September 26, 1476; and did homage and had restitution of the temporalties on the 14th of October following. The king remitted to him all the profits of the vacancy. During his episcopacy, three commissions of array were issued for calling out the armed force ofthe palatinate: one of these is directed to the Duke of Gloucester, afterwards Richard III., as lieutenant of the north. Bishop Dudley died in Lon don, in November, 1483, and was buried in AVestminster Abbey. John Sherwood, 1484 \u2014 1494. John Sherwood, S. T. P., archdeacon of Richmond, was elected to the see in January, 1484, and assisted at the coronation of Richard III. He did not obtain restitution of the temporalties till August 6, 1485, fifteen days before the battle of Bosworth Field. King Richard (whatever may be the crimes imputed to him) appears to have been popular in the north ; and the galling subsi- dies of his successor at one time occasioned a serious rising in the counties of York and Durham, in which the Earl of Northumberland fell a sacrifice to the popular resentment. Bishop Sherwood, who seems to have been regarded by the king with jealousy, retired to Rome, where he died, Ja nuary 12, 1493-4. Henry ArII., with his usual avarice, seized not only on the temporalties of the see, but on the prelate's private possessions. Richard Fox, 1494\u20141501 On December 7, 1494, Richard Fox was translated to Durham from Bath and AVells; and he received the temporalties the next day.* The whole management of the north, and of the Scottish Border, was immediately committed to his charge. In 1495, AArarbeck was received at the court of Scotland ; and, notwithstanding the negotiations of Henry VII., King James crossed the Border, and laid siege to Norham. Bishop Fox, with a small but determined band of followers, threw himself into the fortress, which, after a gallant defence of sixteen days, was relieved by the Earl of Surrey. In 149-, the bishop fulminated a sentence of excommunication against the robbers of * He had been instrumental, when in France, in conjunction with Morton, bishop of Ely, in effecting the revolution which raised the Earl of Richmond to the throne of England ; and, after the battle of Bosworth Field, he was rewarded with the office of privy counsellor.

He was also apostolical legate in the realm of Scotland, and chancellor of the university of Cambridge. vol. i. k"], [46, "GENERAL HISTORY. xxxvm Tynedale and Redesdale, and particularly against the vagrant priests who associated with them, and minted the reliques of barbarism with the rites and sacraments of the Christian church. In 1498, he \"ranted an absolution to several of the freebooters by name who had accepted his mercy. In the preceding year, he had been one of the commissioners for effecting a peace with Scotland ; and, an accidental quarrel having taken place at Norham, he held a personal interview with King James at Melrose, in which he not only soothed the resentment of that monarch, but prevailed on him to ao-ree to an alliance with England. James requested the bishop's favourable intercession in obtaining for him the Princess Margaret in marriage ; and in June, 1502, the young bride, gal lantly attended, commenced her progress to the north (see Darlington and City of Durham). Bishop Fox had, however, been translated to the see of Winchester on October 6, 1501. The only public works which he executed in the palatinate were some repairs in Durham Castle, and the inclosure of the deer park at Auckland.* William Sever, 1502\u20141505. William Sever, Sinows, or Sinews, (for the name is thus variously written) is generally said to have been a native of Shincliffe, near Durham.f After being successively warden of Merton Col lege, provost of Eton, chancellor of the diocese of Oxford, abbot of St. Mary's at York, and bishop ofCarlisle, he was translated, in October, 1502, to Durham, the temporalties of which had been entrusted to his management after the translation of Bishop Fox. He died in 1505, and was bu ried in the abbey of St. Mary's at York. The king held the temporalties during two years which the see continued vacant. Cardinal Christopher Bainbrigg, 1507 \u2014 1508. On November 15, 1507, Christopher Bainbrigg, dean of York, received restitution ofthe tem poralties of the bishopric of Durham. In 1505, he had been made dean of Windsor, master of the rolls, and sworn a privy counsellor. Within a year after his consecration at Durham, he was translated to York ;} and the see remained vacant till the accession of Henry VIII. \u2022 Chambre says that he resigned this bishopric in consequence of some disputes with the Earl of Cumber land respecting Hartlepool ; but there was then no Earl of Cumberland. Henry Lord Clifford, the shepherd lord (see Hartlepool), is probably the person intended : his son was created Earl of Cumberland in 1525. Bishop Fox was one of the executors of Henry VII. ; but his influence greatly declined at court on the accession of his successor. In 1510, however, he, with the Earl of Surrey and Bishop Ruthall, concluded a short-lived peace with Lewis XII. of France; and in 1513, he attended the king in his French expedition, and was present at the taking of Terouenne. His last public employment was the negotiation of a treaty with the Emperor Maximilian. He had been instrumental in promoting the rise of AVolsey ; and the tower ing fortunes of that favourite are said by some to have been the cause of his resignation of the privy seal in 1515. He founded the college of Corpus Christi in Oxford, where scholarships are appropriated to natives of the county of Durham. Though afflicted with blindness for some years before his death, his spirit re mained unbroken ; and he replied to AVolsey, who wished him to resign the bishopric of AVinchester for a pension, \" that though he could no longer distinguish white from black, yet could he discriminate right from wrong, truth from falsehood, and could well discern the malice of an ungrateful man.\" He warned the car dinal to beware lest ambition should render him blind to his approaching ruin, bade him to attend closer to the king's business, and leave AVinchester to the care of her bishop. He died in 1528, and was interred in his own chapel in AVinchester cathedral. + See note, p- xxxv.

Thomas Ruthall, or Rowthale, canon of Lincoln and York, dean of Salisbury, was nominated to the see of Durham, April 23, 1509- He was consecrated at York, and received restitution of the temporalties on the 3d of July following. He was of the privy council to Henry ATI. and Henry VIIL, and held the privy seal and the office of secretary of state to the latter monarch. On ac- count of his singular wisdom, Chambre says, he was constantly retained at court, so that he had no time to attend to the interests of his bishopric. He, however, repaired the third part of Tyne bridge, and began to build the great dining hall at Auckland, for the completion of which he be- queathed a sum of money. During his episcopacy occurred the memorable battle of Flodden Field, in which the forces of the bishopric, led by Sir AVilliam Bulmer, were placed in the fore- ward of the English army ; and on this occasion, the banner of St. Cuthbert was (probably for the last time) displayed. The immense riches which Bishop Ruthall had accumulated were the ulti- mate cause of his ruin. By order of Henry VIU?, he compiled an account of the lands and reve- nues of the crown throughout England. At the same time, he drew up a statement of his own riches. The two volumes were, it is said, bound exactly alike, in fair white vellum ; and Ruthall, by mistake, delivered into the hands of AVolsey the inventory of his own private fortunes, instead of a survey of the royal revenues. The cardinal, with malicious satisfaction, placed the volume before the sovereign, observing, that though he would be disappointed in meeting with the infor- mation he expected, he need be under no difficulty where to apply for the assistance which his necessities required. Henry made no ungenerous use of the unintentional disclosure; but the chagrin which the bishop conceived on discovering his error is said to have been so excessive, that his death was the consequence. He died at Durham Place, near London, February 4, 1522, and was buried in St. John's chapel, adjoining Westminster Abbey. Cardinal Thomas AAroLSEY, 1522 \u2014 1528. Cardinal Wolsey, having resigned the bishopric of Bath and AVells, received restitution of the temporalties of Durham on April 30, 1523, and continued to hold this bishopric with the archiepis copal see of York. He never visited his northern diocese ; and, on the death of Bishop Fox in 1528, he resigned Durham, and was translated to Winchester, April 27, 1529.* England of the buU which conferred on Henry the title of \" Defender of the Faith.\" His death, which occurred in 1514, has been attributed to the ungoverned violence of his temper. In a fit of sudden passion he struck his house-steward, one Renald of Modena, and the insult was avenged by a dose of poison. The assassin, either from remorse or to avoid public justice, fell by his own hands. Fuller says, \" If something may be pleaded for this cardinal out of the Old, sure I am more must be pleaded against him out of the New, Testament, if the places be paraUeled :\u2014 Prov. xxix. 19. 1 Tim. iii. 3. 'A servant will not be corrected by words,' &c. ' A bishop must be no striker,' &c. \" But grant him greatly faulty, it were uncharitable in us to beat his memory with more stripes, who did then suffer so much for his own indiscretion.\" The cardinal lies buried in the EngUsh church of St. Thomas the Martyr at Rome. * This celebrated statesman and ecclesiastic is said by some to have been the son of a butcher at Ipswich, where he was born in 147L He was educated at Oxford, where he had three sons of the Marquis of Dorset under his care; a circumstance which induced that nobleman to present him with the living of Limmington in Somersetshire. Although his conduct was by no means regular, his manners and appearance recommended him to Dean, archbishop of Canterbury, who made him his domestic chaplain. On the death of that prelate, he served Sir John Nanfan, governor of Calais, in the same capacity, by which patron he was recommended to Henry VII., who made him one of his own chaplains ; and in consequence of his able and expeditious,"], [48, "XL GENERAL HISTORY. Cuthbert Tunstall, 1530\u20141559- The see of Durham was now promised to Cardinal Campeggio, as an inducement to proceed with greater rapidity in the proceedings connected with the divorce of Henry VIII. and Queen Cathe- conveyance of a despatch to the emperor at Bruges, he was rewarded with the deanery of Lincoln. Being introduced by Bishop Fox to Henry A'lIL, he shortly obtained the first place in the royal favour, and became uncontroled minister. His progress in advancement was very rapid. In 1510, he was introduced into the privy council, made reporter of the star chamber, registrar, and afterwards chancellor of the garter. Eccle siastical preferments were also profusely heaped upon him, ofwhich the principal were the bishoprics of Tour nay and Lincoln in 1513, and the archbishopric of York in 1514. The following year, the pope, to ingratiate himself with Henry, elevated him to the dignity of cardinal ; and his nomination to be the pope's legate com pleted his ecclesiastical dignities, by exalting him above the archbishop of Canterbury. Naturally proud and ostentatious, no English subject, either lay or ecclesiastic, ever took so much state upon himself, entertaining a train of 800 servants, many of whom were knights and gentlemen. In 1515, he was appointed chancellor ; and his administration in that capacity is said to have done him credit. His legantine power, on the contrary, was exercised with great severity and oppression, and his rapacity for acquirement was unbounded. The Emperor Charles V., Henry I. of France, and the pope, anxious to gratify Henry, granted pensions to Wol sey; and he made several attempts to gain the popedom. Having acquired the temporalties of the abbey of St. Albans, and the bishoprics of Bath and AVells, Durham, and AVinchester in succession, his revenues nearly equalled those of the crown, part of wliich he expended in pomp and ostentation, and part in laudable muni ficence for the advancement of learning. He founded several lectures at Oxford, where he also erected the celebrated college of Christchurch. He also founded a collegiate school at Ipswich, and built a palace at Hampton Court, which he presented to the king: but, it must be understood, much of this was done by the seizure of minor religious establishments, for which he obtained papal authority. The critical affair of the divorce of Queen Catherine was one of the first steps to his fall ; the king suspecting that he assisted in the artificial delays of the court of Rome. The attachment of Henry to Anne Boleyn still further involved him ; and at length, in 1529, the Dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk were sent to require the great seal from him, and he was ordered to quit York Place, his palace in London, and retire to Esher, all his rich plate and furniture being seized in the king's name. After a short suspense, owing to some remnant of attachment on the part of Henry, articles of impeachment were exhibited against him in parliament ; but he was defended so vigor ously by his retainer Cromwell, that they were withdrawn. His enemies then indicted him under the statute of provisoes for procuring bulls from Rome, which was made the ground of a sentence of forfeiture. After the intended effect was produced of making him resign York Place and its riches to the king, he was granted a full pardon, and part of his revenues. In 1530, he was ordered to remove to his diocese of York, \\vhere he passed part of the year at his mansion of Cawood, until once more, on the 1st of November in the same vear he was arrested for high treason, and set out under custody for London. Indisposition of body, however combining with mental distress, he was obliged to stop at Leicester, where he was honourably received at the abbey. His disorder increasing, a few days brought him to his end, on November 28, 1530, in the 00th year of his age. Shortly before his decease, he exclaimed to the officer appointed to conduct him, \" Had I but served God as diligently as I have served my king, he would not have given me over in my grey hairs.\" The ambition, arrogance, and rapacity of AA'olsey, have been dwelt upon by most historians. Dr. Lingard, however, observes, \" The best eulogy on his character is to be found in the \"contrast between the conduct of Henry before, and after the cardinal's fall. As long as AVolsey continued in favour, the royal passions were confined within certain bounds ; the moment his influence was extinguished, they burst through every restraint and by their caprice and violence alarmed his subjects, and astonished the other nations of Europe.\" Shak- speare, ever inclined to charity, makes Cromwell pronounce the following eloquent apology : \" illls cardinal, Those twins of learning which he rais'd in you, Though from an humble stock, undoubtedly Ipswich, and Oxford ! one of which fell with him, Was faslnon'd to much honour from his cradle.

XLI rine. After a delay of eight months, during which a yearly pension of _\u00a3'1000 out of the ecclesi- astical revenues of the bishopric was granted to Anne Boleyn, the see was bestowed on Cuthbert TunstaU,* bishop of London, who received restitution of the temporalties on March 25, 1530. In 1531, the English clergy acknowledged King Henry as head of the church, \"as far as the law of Christ will allow ;\" but Tunstall had the courage to protest against this ill-defined supremacy. In 1533, Bishop Tunstall, with Lee, archbishop of York, were employed in endeavouring to pre- vail on Queen Catherine to consent to the projected divorce. In the mean while, successive steps had been taken towards the diminution of the papal authority in England; and the parliament which met November 3, 1534,-f confirmed the king's title of \" Supreme Head of the Church,\" to which Tunstall reluctantly submitted. In 1535, he was one of the commissioners for valuing aU ecclesiastical benefices, and settling the first fruits and tenths on the crown. The commissioners who were sent to inquire into the errors and abuses in religious establishments displayed a black and exaggerated catalogue of offences which they alleged they had discovered ;\\ and 376 houses of all orders (all that were under the annual value of _P200) were consequently suppressed by a single act of parliament. The cathedral church of Durham and the palatine fran- chise as yet remained inviolate; but, in the northern counties, the people were powerfully attached to the religion of their ancestors; and \" when they saw the ruin of the establishments which they had revered from their childhood ; the monks driven from their homes, and in many instances compelled to beg their bread ; and the poor, who had formerly been fed at the doors of the con- vents, now abandoned without relief; they readily listened to the declamations of demagogues, unfurled the standard of revolt, and with arms in their hands demanded the redress of their grievances.\" In the autumn of 1536, a general insurrection broke out in Lancashire, Cumberland, Westmoreland, Durham, Richmondshire, and Craven, under the conduct of Robert Aske, a gen tleman of ancient family and large estates in Yorkshire. The rebels were joined by Lord Scroop of Bolton, Lord Latimer, Sir George Lumley, Sir Thomas Percy, and Sir John Bulmer. After reinstating the monks of Hexham and other dissolved houses, their chief power marched southward, preceded by some of the wandering priests with crosses, and displaying on their banners the cruci- * He is generally said to have been the illegitimate son of Sir Richard TunstaU, K. G., of Thurland Cas tle, in Lancashire ; but Surtees supposes him to have been the son of Thomas Tunstall, brother and heir of Sir Richard, and consequently brother of Sir Brian Tunstall, who fell at Flodden. He was rector of Stan hope (being yet only sub-deacon), but resigned in 1520. In 1514, he was ordained priest, and, amongst \u2022other preferments, was made master of the rolls, and accompanied Sir Thomas More in an embassy to the Emperor Charles V. at Brussels, where he gained the friendship of Erasmus. After further diplomatic ser vices, he was, in 1522, made bishop of London and keeper of the great seal. In 1525, he was sent with Sir Richard AVingfield into Spain, to solicit the release of Francis, king of France, who had been captured at Pavia; in 1527, he accompanied AVolsey on his magnificent embassy to France; and, in 1529, was one of the English ambassadors at the conclusion of the treaty of Cambray. t The clear yearly value of the bishopric of Durham, in 1534, was estimated at \u00a32821, Is. 5d.

They styled their enterprise The Pilgrimage of Grace, and bound themselves by oath to stand by each other, \"for the love which they bore to Almighty God, his faith, the holy church, and the maintenance thereof; to the preservation of the king's person and his issue ; to the purifying of the nobility ; and to expulse all villein blood and evil counsellors from his grace and privy council; not for any private profit, nor to do displeasure to any private person, nor to slay or murder through envy, but for the restitution of the church, and the suppression of heretics and their opinions.''' The inhabitants of the country through which they marched were compelled to take the oath, and to join the pilgrims. York, Hull, and Ponte fract admitted the insurgents ; but the strong castles of Skipton and Scarborough were preserved by the courage of the garrisons. The latter was defended for twenty days by Sir Ralph Eure, with only his own household servants. The pilgrims being on their march towards Doncaster, the Earl of Shrewsbury armed his tenantry, and threw himself into the town, where he was soon joined by the Duke of Norfolk, the king's lieutenant, with 5000 men. A battery of cannon protected the bridge, and the ford was rendered impassable by an accidental swell of the waters. An armistice was now agreed to, and deputies were sent to the king, to whom he returned a written answer, composed by himself.* Norfolk, having received full authority to treat, after some negotiation procured a free pardon for the insurgents, with an understanding that their grievances should be shortly and patiently discussed in the parliament to be assembled at York. But the king, freed from his apprehensions, neglected to redeem his promise; and, within two months, the pilgrims were again under arms. Now, however, the duke, who lay with a more numerous force in the heart of the country, was able to intercept all their communications, and to defeat all their mea sures. They sailed in two successive attempts to surprise Hull and Carlisle; and most of their leaders were taken. Robert Aske was executed at York. Sir George Lumley, son and heir of Lord Lumley, and Sir Thomas Percy, brother and heir to the Earl of Northumberland, suffered at Tyburn ; as did Sir John Bulmer soon after. The wife of the latter, who was a natural daugh ter to Stafford Duke of Buckingham, was bunied for rebellion in Smithfield. Their followers were hanged by scores at York, Hull, and Carlisle ; and at length, when resistance had ceased, and the royal resentment had been satisfied, tranquillity was restored by the proclamation of a general pardon. As the people of the bishopric had rendered themselves obnoxious to the king, an act was passed, 27th Henry VIIL, for abolishing the privileges of the palatinate. By the first clause, the bishop was deprived of the privilege of pardoning treason, murder, manslaughter, felony, or reversing out lawries within the palatinate. 2. The appointment of the justices of the peace and of assize was taken from the bishop and vested in the crown. 3 \u2014 4.

The bishop had the complimentary right reserved to him of attesting all processes within the franchise, and it was directed that the bishop and his temporal chancellor should be al ways, ipso facto, two of the justices of the peace. Tunstall submitted in silence to this act, which swept away the honours enjoyed by his prede cessors during six centuries. The dissolution of the greater abbeys followed ;* but that of Dur ham was one of fourteen which were rendered collegiate, and was provided with a dean and prebendaries (see City of Durham), to whom were restored nearly the whole of the ancient pos sessions of the convent, except those attached to the subordinate priory of Finchale, and the cells of AVearmouth, Jarrow, Lytham, and Stamford. In 1537, Bishop Tunstall undertook, by the king's order, to answer the divines who were sent from the Protestant princes of Germany to press a further reformation ; and, in the following year, he was one of the disputants who convicted Lambert of heresy. In 1541, he appears, in conjunction with Heath, bishop of Rochester, as the editor of a new English version of the Scriptures. In 1542, he was actively employed in the Bor der service, and repaired and garrisoned the castle of Norham. At an array of forces destined to act against Scotland, May 2, 1545, the bishop of Durham had of able men, archers 260, spearmen 4, billmen 494. On the death of Henry ArIIL, Bishop Tunstall was named as one of his executors ; but his col- leagues in the council, jealous of his attachment to the ancient faith, invented various pretexts to confine him almost entirely to his diocese. He was one of those who objected in parliament to Cranmer's Liturgy ; and he also, in 1549, opposed a coercive measure for the prevention of similar insurrections to those which had recently occurred. In 1550, Dudley, Earl of Northumberland, succeeded to the power of the protector, Somerset; and with a view, it is supposed, of enriching himself with the spoils of the bishopric, caused Tunstall to be seized, examined before the council, and committed to ward, on an alleged misprision of treason, in corresponding with Ninian Menvill, a gentleman of the bishopric, who was afterwards, under Queen Mary, outlawed and attainted for participating in Northumberland's own treasons. The informer, on account of the absence of a material document, failed to establish the charge. AVhen, however, the Duke of Somerset's house was searched, the paper was found in a casket, and was acknowledged by Tunstall to have been written by himself. Northumberland now introduced a bill into the House of Lords \" to deprive him of his bishopric for divers heinous offences ;\" but the Commons refused to pass it without see ing the accusers face to face with the accused. Unable, probably, to comply with this reasonable request, the earl procured a commission, directed to seven of his own creatures, before whom the bishop was summoned, tried, and deprived, and immediately sent to the Tower. The designs of his oppressor were further developed by an act for the suppression of the diocese of Durham, and the establishment of two others by the king's letters patent, of which one should comprehend the * The pretences for this measure were, that it would put an end to pauperism and taxation ; it would enable the king to create and support earls, barons, and knights ; to wage war in future without any addi tional burden to the people; and to free the nation from all apprehension of danger from foreign enmity or internal discontent. \u2014 Coke, Inst. iv. 44.

The following stanza, preserved in the \" Bishopric Garland\" as peculiar to this county, appears to have formed part of a satire on the facility with which many of the religious adapted their lives to their newly-acquired liberty : \u2014 \"I'll be no more a nun, nun, nun, I'll be no more a nun ; But I'll be a wife, and lead a merry life, And brew good ale in a tun, tun, tun.\""], [52, "GENERAL HISTORY. XLIV county of Durham, with a revenue of 2000 marks, and the other Northumberland, with a revenue of 1000 marks. A cathedral for the latter see, with a dean and chapter, was to be established at Newcastle,* to which town Gateshead was annexed. The earl took possession of Durham House in the Strand, where he celebrated the marriage of his son with Lady Jane Grey ; and he was ap pointed by patent steward of all the remaining revenues of the bishopric. His rapacity, however, was checked by the death of the king, and the failure of his projects with regard to his ill-fated daughter-in-law ; and, on the accession of Queen Mary, Tunstall was reinstated in his bishopric, and Gateshead was restored to the see. During the whole of this reign, the prelate remained almost constantly in his diocese; and, in 1555, the queen granted to him and his successors the patronage of the prebends of the cathedral, which was before vested in the crown. He was very charitable, and is said to have annually dis tributed, at Auckland, on Good Friday, a bushel of silver pennies among the poor ; probably of his own coining, for the see still retained the privilege of a mint. His influence was successfully exerted in screening the unhappy victims of persecution ;f and, on the accession of Elizabeth, it was expected that he would take the oath of supremacy. This, however, be declined ; and he was deprived on September 29, 1559- He was committed in free custody to Parker, archbishop elect of Canterbury, by whom he was kindly entertained till his death, which occurred on the 18th of November following, in the 85th year of his age. His remains were honourably interred, at the archbishop's charge, in the chancel of Lambeth church.

It is to be regretted that those of the Reformed Church did not, in the foUowing reign, follow so laudable an example. See City of Durham. X Surtees says, \" Descended from a line of warriors, Tunstall seems to have inherited little of the hot and haughty spirit of his ancestors. His disposition, naturally mild and ingenuous, had been still further softened by an early attachment to the pursuits of literature ; and he lived amidst the intrigues of a stormy court, a singular exception to the factious violence of the age, respected even by his adversaries, and without a private or personal enemy. Half disposed to admit the arguments of the Reformers, and not denying the abuses of the church of Rome, yet afraid of the consequences of innovation, and repressed by the weight of ancient and received authority, TunstaU seems to have long hovered in opinion betwixt the Reformers and their oppo nents; and it is not wonderful if, at a period when the minds of the best and wisest men were perplexed and divided, he sometimes betrayed a degree of weakness and irresolution, which forms almost the only shade in his character. A' et if Tunstall wanted the firmness and constancy of a martyr, he possessed qualities scarcely less rare or valuable. AVith mild and scholar-like scepticism, he refused to persecute others for opinions on which he had himself felt doubt and indecision ; and during the heat of the Marian persecution, not a single victim bled within the limits of the church of Durham.\" \u00a7 Third son of Richard Pilkington, of Rivington, in Lancashire.

He received the royal assent on the 20th of February, 1560-1, was consecrated on the 2d of March, received restitution of part of the temporalties* on the 25th, and was enthroned in the cathedral on the 10th of April. He entertained several Puritanical or Calvinistic scruples as to the ceremonies of the church of England, and the use of the cap and surplice; though he did not absolutely object to wear these habilaments. He, however, pressed the necessity of not quar relling for ordinances of mere form and circumstances, with men of real learning and piety, in a dark and superstitious province, almost destitute of Protestant preachers, where \" the priests went with swords and daggers, and such coarse apparel as they could get, not regarding colour or fashion.\" He visited the cathedral in 1561 and 1567; an<l i*3 probable that he willingly co operated with the queen's commissioners and Dean AVhittingham in removing the \" superstitious and idolatrous\" ornaments from the church. In 1569 occurred the rebellion of the Earls of West moreland and Northumberland (see Raby); when Bishop Pilkington fled with his wife and family into the south. -f- On the suppression of the revolt, the possessions of the Earl of AVestmoreland in this county, though claimed by the bishop, were retained by the crown, on pretence of defraying the great expenses incurred in defending the bishop's territory ; with an express saving, however, of his right on all future occasions. In 1573, he petitioned for liberty to pass the winter in the south ; and, in the following year, requested leave to pay in the tenths of his clergy to the treasurer of Berwick, from fear of robbery on the road, and refused to give up the fishery of Norham to the crown. He died at Auckland, January 25, 1575, and was first buried in the choir there, but was afterwards removed to Durham cathedral, and interred in the choir before the high altar. Bishop Pilkington left the palaces and other edifices of the see in such a ruinous state, that his successor proceeded at law against his executors for dilapidations ; a circumstance which had not happened before the Reformation. The see remained vacant fifteen months. Sandys, archbishop of York, attempted to revive the ancient claims of the metropolitan see, but was effectually re sisted by the dean and chapter. Richard Barnes, 1575 \u2014 1587- By the influence of Lord Burleigh, Richard Barnes, bishop of Carlisle, was translated to Dur ham, April 5, 1575, \"in order,\" as Strype says, \"to be a watch on the messengers from Scotland to the unfortunate Queen Mary.\" He had the royal assent on the 29th of the same month, was confirmed on the 9th of May, enthroned on the 19th, and received restitution of the temporalties * The parts detained were, the manors and demesnes of Norhamshire, valued at \u00a3120; AUertonshire, \u00a3218, 9s. lid.; Craike, \u00a339, 4s. 7U- ; Sadberge, \u00a323, Os. lid.; Middleham, \u00a319, tis. lid.; Coatham Mundeville, \u00a347, 16s.

Bishop Barnes entertained a very low opinion of the people of the palatinate,* and carried on an uninteresting dispute with Archbishop Grindal.

Fuller says that \" he was one commendable of himself, but much sufl'ering for the corruption and viciousness of John Barnes, his brother and chancellor ;\" and the misrule of this officer called forth the censures of the learned and pious Bernard Gilpin (see Houghton-le-Spring). Bishop Barnes died at Auckland, where he chiefly resided, on August 24, 1587, ancl was buried in the middle of the choir of Durham cathedral. The see continued vacant two years, during which Thomas Cal verley, the late bishop's temporal chancellor, and Sir AVilliam Hylton, were successively guardians of the temporalties. \u2022f- Matthew Hutton, 1589 \u2014 1594.

He was confirmed on the 26th of July, consecrated the next day, and had restitution of the temporalties on the 10th of September following. On the death of Archbishop Piers in 1594, Bishop Hutton was removed to the metropolitan see of York. j * In a letter to Lord Burleigh, after lauding the people of Northumberland for their civil obedience and excellent conformity, and himself for having driven out \"the reconciling priests and massers, whereof there was store, but now they be all gon into Lancashire and Yorkshire,\" he proceeds: \" I assure your good lord ship, those people are far more plyable to all good order, than those stubborn, churlish people, of the county of Durham, and their neighbours of Richmondshire, who shew but, as the proverb is, dack of Napes charity in their hearts.

He was an able controversialist and an elo- quent preacher, and much respected in private life. In the first year of his episcopacy, he caused a survey to be made of the lands of the see at AAreardale ; and he recovered from the crown the forfeited lands of Anthony Arrowsmith, who stood mute, and was pressed to death at Durham. Having succeeded in quashing a royal charter to the city of Durham, he granted one himself. In 1596, he was one of the commissioners appointed to settle disputes on the Scottish Borders. In 1603, he met James I. at Berwick, and attended him to Durham ; and, in the same year, he demised Norham Castle, Norhamshire, and Islandshire to the king, who immediately granted Norham to the Earl of Dunbar. The bishop obtained, in consideration, an abatement in the outrent paid by the see of Durham to the garrison of Berwick, and the restitution of Durham House in the Strand. On July 26, 1606, he was translated to York.* AAllliam James, 1606 \u2014 1617- On August 5, 1606, AVilliam James, D. D., a native of Staffordshire, and dean of Durham, suc ceeded Bishop Hutton. He was consecrated on the 7th of September, and had restitution and was enthroned by proxy on the 16th. He completed his predecessor's agreement with the crown, and repaired the chapel at Durham House at a considerable expense. He seems to have been involved to make a public submission before the High Commission at York, confessed, in effect, nothing more than some very violent and unguarded expressions. Indeed, the asperity of his temper was extreme; but even his enemies allow him the credit of strong talent, sound learning, and manly and persuasive eloquence. Le Neve seriously relates, that at the last sermon which Hutton ever preached in his cathedral at York, the Popish recusants, who were obliged to be present by Elizabeth's order, were so obstreperous that they were forced to be gagged. Thus secured from interruption, the archbishop preached \"most gravely and solemnly,\" taking for his text John viii. 47, \" He that is of God heareth God's words; ye therefore hear them not, be cause ye are not of God.\" He died October 18, 1605, in the 80th vear of his age, and was buried in the south aisle of York cathedral. * Bishop Jlatthew was the son of a merchant at Bristol.

'AVho is your council?' says the vice-chancellor. 'Mr. Leasteed,' an- swers the man. 'Alas!' replies the vice-chancellor, 'no man can stand vou in less stead.' ' No remedy !' adds the other ; ' Necessity has no law.' 'Indeed,' quotli he, 'no more I think has your chancellor.'\" \u2014 \"Another man was to be bound in a bond, very likely to be forfeited, and came in great haste to offer it, saying, he would be bound if he might be taken in. ' Yes,' says the judge, ' I think you will be taken in ; what is your name?' ' Cox,' says the party, and so pressed, as the manner is, to come into court. ' Make him room there,' said the chancellor; 'let that Cox come in.'\" On Bishop Matthew's translation from Dur- ham to York, he observed that it was for lack of grace ; for. according to a northern proverb, though \\rork has the higher rack, yet Durham has the deeper manger. Fuller says, \".After he arrived at his greatness, he made one journey into the west, to visit his two mothers; her that bare him at Bristol, and her that bred him in learning, the university of Oxford. Coming near to the latter, attended with a train suitable to his present condition, he was met almost with an equal number, who came out of Oxford to give him entertain- ment. Thus augmented with another troop, and remembering he had passed over a small water, a poor scholar, when first coming to the university, he kneeled down, and took up the expression of Jacob, ' AVith my staff came I over this Jordan, and now I am become two bands.'\" He died at Cawood in 1628, and was buried in the Lady Chapel in York cathedral.

In 1614, on petition, he restored a wreck which had been seized on Ryhope sands. In the following year, the king sent letters into the bishopric for the array of all men able to bear arms betwixt the ages of 16 and 60 : the whole number that appeared on Gilesgate Moor was 8320, viz. 1223 for Stockton Ward, 2946 for Darlington AVard, 1494 for Easington Ward, and 2657 for Chester Ward. Bishop James appointed, by patent, several officers in the port of Sunderland, incorporated the company of Clothworkers in Durham, and granted a weekly market and an annual fair to the town of Wol singham. He entertained the king at Durham in his last year, and died soon after, aged 7-5, May 11, 1617- His remains were interred near the entrance of the choir in Durham cathedral. He had accumulated a large fortune, but left the manor houses of the see very much out of repair, for which his son and executor paid considerable dilapidations to Bishop Neile. During a vacancy of five months after the death of Bishop James, the dean and chapter exercised the spiritual juris diction, and the crown appointed the officers of the see.

He, however, repaired all the houses * He was born at AVestminster in 1562, and educated in the school there on the foundation of Lady Mil dred Burleigh. His grandfather is said to have been ruined by flying from his employments at court on conscientious motives ; and his father was a tallow chandler. On leaving the university, he became chaplain to Lord Burleigh, and afterwards to his son, the Earl of Salisbury, to whose influence he owed his first pre ferments. He successively held the deanery of AVestminster, and the bishoprics of Rochester, Lichfield, and Lincoln. In 1612, he assisted at the removal ofthe remains of Mary Queen of Scots from Peterborough to Westminster ; and, in the following year, he sat on the inquisition relative to the Earl of Essex's divorce, and was one of the four prelates who signed the certificate. He was with King James in Scotland at the time the bishopric of Durham became vacant. + AValler the poet, calling to see King James on the day after parliament had been dissolved, and finding the bishops of Durham and AVinchester standing behind his majesty's chair, overheard a very remarkable conversation, in which the king said, \"My lords, cannot I take my subjects' money when I want it, without all this formality in parliament?\" The bishop of Durham, being a complete court sycophant, readily an swered, \" God forbid, sire, but you should ; you are the breath of our nostrils.\" The king then turned to AVinchester, saying, \" AVell, my lord, what say you?\" The bishop replied, \" Sire, I have no skill to judge of parliamentary cases.\" The king answered, \"No put-offs, my lord, answer me presently.\" \"Then, sir.\" said AVinchester, \"I think it lawful for you to take my brother Neile's money, for he offers it.\" The writer of the Life of James I. says of Neile, that \" when any man preached that had the renown of piety, (unwilling the king should hear him) he would in the ser-. on time entertain the king with a merry tale, (that I may give it no worse title) which the king would after laugh at, and tell those near him, he could not hear the preacher for the old b bishop.\" J The king's declaration, May 24, 1618 \u2014 \"That for his good people's lawfull recreations, his pleasure was, that after the end of divine service, they should not be disturbd, letted, or discouraged from any lawfull recreations; such as dancing either of men or women, archery for men, leaping, vaulting, or any such harm less recreations: Nor for having of May-games, AVhitsun-ales, or Morrice-dances, and setting up of Mayl poles, or other sports therewith used, so as the same be had in due and convenient time, without impediment or let of divine service : And that women should have leave to carry rushes to the church for the decoratino of it according to their old custom ; withal prohibiting all unlawful games to be used on the Sundays only* as bear-bating, bull-bating, and (at aU times in the meaner sort of people by law prohibited) bowlin\"- \""], [57, "GENERAL HISTORY.

On March 3, 1627-8, George Monteigne, or Mounteigne, S. T. P., bishop of London, was trans lated to Durham, from whence he was removed to the archbishopric of York on the 16th of June following.j John Howson, 1628\u20141631. John Howson, S. T. P., bishop of Oxford, was translated to Durham on September 28, 1628, enthroned on the 16th of December, and had restitution of the temporalties on the 25th of the same month. He frequently wrote against Calvinism and Popery, and declared \" that he'd loosen the Pope from his chair, though he were fastened thereto with a tenpenny nail.\" Bishop Howson died at London, on February 6, 1631, aged 75, and was buried in St. Paul's cathedral. On March 8, 1631-2, the king appointed receivers to collect the revenues of the see for the use of the crown. A Commission of Sewers was also issued during the vacancy, for the rivers Tyne, Tees, AA^ear, Skerne, and Gaunless. Thomas Morton, 1632\u20141659- The bishopric was filled in June, 1632, by the translation hither of Thomas Morton, S. T. P., bishop of Lichfield,^ who was enthroned on the 20th of July following. His prudence, generosity, * In 1629, he was implicated in the same parliamentary censure with Bishop Laud, as inclined to Armi nianism and Popery ; being accused of standing up at the Gloria Patri, and of placing a stone altar-table in the cathedral at Durham, which, however, he proved the dean had set up, and he did not care to take away. In his defence, he insists upon having moved the late king to receive, on his death-bed, the Communion of the Church of England. In 1631, he was promoted to the archbishopric of York, where he died, October 31, 1640. + He is said to have been born at Cawood, where his father was a farmer, and at which place he was in- terred on his decease, which occurred on the 6th of November after his translation to York. He has been accused of licensing, whilst bishop of London, several books in favour of the arbitrary doctrines and supersti- tious observances of the times, and of too great compliance with the wishes of the court. The following some- what apocryphal account of him appears in Gent's History of York, p. 82: \u2014 \"The inhabitants of Cawood, by tradition, shew the house where he was born, and tell us, that his mother was a beggar woman, who tra- velling with her son George to Lincoln, seemed to follow her occupation in that city and the adjacent villages ; but the lad carrying the bag, and one time eating more than what his mother was willing to allow, ran away from her, fearing a severe correction ; when, coming to a gentleman's house in the neighbourhood of Cawood, he took compassion on him, first ordered him to attend his kitchen, and perceiving his bright parts, gave him an equal education with his son, which put him in the road to ecclesiastical preferment. In process of time he became bishop of Lincoln, and made enquiry for his mother, who happening to open a gate through which his lordship was to pass to that city, recognised and tenderly embraced her, and ordered, that care should be taken of her during life. AVhen the see of York became vacant, many were the candidates that put up for it. The king being in suspence to whom to give it, sent to Monteigne to ask his advice, how to clear the difficulty. The bishop modestly answered, ' If his majesty had faith as a grain of mustard seed, he might say to this Mountain, be thou removed into the sea, and it would obey.' The king replied, ' Miracles were ceased, and what had faith to do in this point?' \u2014 'To convince your majesty to the contrary, (said the bishop) be only pleased to say to this Mountain, (pointing to himself) be thou removed into yonder see, (alluding to York) I am sure your majesty will forthwith be obeyed.' The king smiling, and taking the hint, ' Why then, Mountain, (saith he) I will remove thee ;' and accordingly sent him down lord archbishop.\" X He was the sixth of nineteen children of Richard Morton, mercer and alderman of York, by his only wife, Elizabeth Leedale. He was born March 20, 1564, and was educated at York, Halifax, and Cambridge- vol. i. n"], [58, "GENERAL HISTORY. L and moderation in exercising his palatine rights, have been highly applauded. In cases of wreck, deodand, and forfeiture, he claimed little more than an acknowledgment, to preserve the rights of his successors. He left the arbitration of fines on the renewals of leases to four indifferent and neighbouring gentlemen ; and, whenever he was absent from the diocese, he left a commission with the high sheriff' and some of the gentry to determine all differences which might arise between him self and his tenants. In the privilege of wardships, he conducted himself with the most exemplary kindness and forbearance. His temperance was such that, when not visited by strangers, he never took more than one meal a day, and his bed was a mattress or a single quilt ; but he exercised a noble hospitality towards others, and a perpetual charity \" to poor scholars, strangers, and travel lers,\" in which his great revenues were all expended. He punctiliously discharged the duties of his high office, by strict attention to the conduct of the clergy under him, the distribution of Cate chisms, and labouring forthe conversion of Catholics. In 1633 and 1639, he entertained King Charles I. at Durham. In 1634, the bishop granted a new charter to the borough of Sunderland ; and, in the following year, he exhibited a petition to the king in council for a redress of grievances concerning his palatine rights, which had been infringed by the officers of the crown. On the levy ing of Ship Money, the ports of Stockton, Sunderland, and Hartlepool, were charged with the pro vision and equipment of one vessel, at an expense of _fl850, levied by a rate on the whole county. In August, 1640, the Scots army under Lesley crossed the Tweed, and advanced without oppo sition to Newburn. The victory they gained at this place* gave them military possession both of In 1598, he obtained the rectory of Long Marston, near York ; and was soon after appointed chaplain to the Earl of Huntingdon, Lord President of the North, a preferment to which he was recommended by his acute ness in disputing with the Romish recusants, who were in the charge ofthe Council ofthe North. During the plague at York in 1602, he often visited the poor in the Pcsl House, to instruct, comfort, and pray with them, and to carry provisions to those who needed. On these occasions, not to risk the safety of any other person, he seldom suffered any of his servants to come near him, but saddled and unsaddled his own horse, and had a private door made into his own house and chamber. Being appointed chaplain to Ralph Lord Eure, ambassador to the emperor and the king of Denmark, he visited several of the cities and universities in the north of Germany. On his return, he became successively chaplain to the Earl of Rutland and the king, dean of Gloucester, one ofthe Council for the Marches, dean of AVinchester with the rectory of Aires ford, and bishop ofChester. In this see he displayed his zeal for the conversion of both recusants and Non conformists, and succeeded in repressing Sunday sports. In 1618, he was translated to the see of Lichfield. * Rushworth thus describes the engagement : \u2014 On the 27th of August, \"the Scots pitched their tents on Heddon Law, above Newborne, from whence there went a continued descent to the river of Tyne- In the night time, they made great fires in and round about their camp, on an open moorish ground (having coals plenty thereabouts), so that the camp seemed to be of large compass and extent. That night and the next morning they suffered any Englishman to come into their camp, and made them welcome, with expressions of great love, and protestations of doing harm to none but those who should oppose them in demanding jus tice of the king against incendiaries. \"The same night, part ofthe king's army, consisting of 3000 foot and 1500 horse, were drawn forth into a plain meadow ground, which was near a mile in length, close on the south side of Tyne, called Newborne haugh, or Stella-haugh, to hinder the Scots from passing the river in the night time, where were two several sconces or breast-works, raised by the English against the two fords, which the Scots might pass over at low water, for till then they could not pass the Tyne, and into each sconce were put 400 musqueteers and four pieces of ordnance. The horse were drawn into squadrons in the said haugh, at some distance from the foot : in this posture horse and foot guarded the river all that night and the next day, till the engagement. \" The Scots all the forenoon watered their horses at one side of the river, and the English on the other side, without affronting one another, or giving any reproachful language. The Scots, having the advantage of the rising ground above Newborne, easily discerned the posture and motion of the English army below in the valley, on the south side the river; but the posture of the Scots army the English could not discern, by reason of the houses, hedges, and inclosures, in and about Newborne. The Scots brought down cannon into Newborne town, and planted some in the church steeple, a small distance from the river Tyne : their mus-"], [59, "GENERAL HISTORY. LI Durham and Northumberland. On the following day, Bishop Morton fled to Stockton, and from thence to York and London ; and, at the same time, Dean Balcanquall and most of the clergy de serted the cathedral. In London the bishop was misused and insulted by the mob on his way to the House of Lords. Having joined in the protest against the exclusion of the bishops from par liament, he was accused of treason ; but was, with the bishop of Coventry, excepted from the order for committing their colleagues to the Tower, on account of their age and infirmity. After some further proceedings, he was allowed to retire to Durham House ; but, in 1645, on the pretence queteers were placed in the church, houses, lanes, and hedges, in and about Newborne. (^Burnett says that the cannon were made of bar iron, hooped, like a barrel, with cords and wet raw hides. They were carried on horseback, and bore several discharges.] \" The skirmish began thus (as the author of these collections was informed, being then upon the place) : a Scottish officer, well mounted, having a black feather in his hat, came out of one of the thatched houses in Newborne, and watered his horse in the river Tyne, as they had done all that day; an English soldier per- ceived he fixed his eye towards the English trenches on the south side ofthe river, fired at him (whether in earnest or to frighten him is not known), but wounded the Scotchman with the shot, who fell off his horse, whereupon the Scottish musqueteers immediately fired upon the English, and so the fight began with small shot, but was continued with great shot as well as small. \"The English played with their cannon, to beat the Scots out ofthe church steeple; thus they continued firing on both sides, till it grew to be near low water, and by that time the Scots, with their cannon, had made a breach in the greater sconce, which Colonel Lunsford commanded, wherein many of his men were killed, and began to retire, yet the colonel prevailed with them to stand to their arms; but presently after a captain, a lieutenant, and some other officers, were slain in that work : then the soldiers took occasion to complain, that they were put upon double duty, and had stood there all night and that day to that time, and that no soldiers were sent from the army at Newcastle to relieve them ; but Colonel Lunsford again prevailed with them not to desert their works ; but another cannon-shot hitting in the works amongst the soldiers, and killing some more of them, they threw down their arms, and would abide in the fort no longer. \" The enemy, on the rising ground above Newborne, plainly discerned the posture of the king's army, and how the soldiers had quit the great work, and being low water, the Scots commanded a forlorn party of 26 horse, being gentlemen of the College of Justice Troop, to pass the river, which they did with some swift- ness ; their orders were only to make discovery in what posture the souldiers were about the uppermost work, but not to come to a dose engagement, but fire at a distance and retreat. \"The Scots playing at this time very hard upon the furthermost trench, forced the English foot to retreat from that work also, which the Scots discerning on the rising ground at Newborne, more horse, commanded by Sir Thomas Hope, and two regiments of foot commanded by the Lord Crawford, Lindsey, and Lord Low- den, waded through the river; and General Lesley, at this instant of time, played hard with nine pieces of cannon, from a new sconce which they had raised on a hill to the east, and so galled the king's ho: se, drawn up in a plain meadow ground, that it much disordered them, and sending more forces over the river, a retreat was sounded, and Colonel Lunsford drew off the cannon. Immediately Commissary AVilmot, son to Lord AVilmot, Sir John Digby, a Romish recusant, and Daniel O'Neal, an Irishman, jointly engaged the enemy, and had a sharp encounter with their horse, they being commanded to bring up the rear, whilst the foot re- treated up Ryton and Stella banks ; but the Scots, with their fresh supply newly come over the river, envi- roned these three commanders, and took them and some others of their troops prisoners. General Lesley treated these commanders nobly in the Scots camp, aud afterwards gave them their liberty freely to return to the king's army.\" Lord Conway, the English commander, was accused of cowardice and treachery, and made a most misera- ble defence against the charge. \" At this time,\" adds Rushworth, \" Newcastle and the coal mines, that had wont to employ 10,000 people all the year long, some working under-ground, some above, and others upon the water in keels or lighters, now not a man to be seen, not a coal wrought, all absconding, being possessed with a fear that the Scots would give no quarter; 400 ships using to be there at a time in the river, not a ship durst come in ; an hundred and odd coming to the mouth of the haven the day after the fight, and hear- ing the Scots had possessed Newcastle, returned all empty, and tradesmen in the town for some days kept their shops shut ; many families gone, leaving their goods to the mercy of the Scots, who possessed themselves of such corn, cheese, beer, &c. as they found, giving the owners thereof, or some in their stead, some money in hand and security in writing for the rest, to be paid at four or six months' end, in money or corn ; and if they refuse, said the Scots, such is the necessity of their army that they must take it without a security lather than starve-\""], [60, "LII GENERAL HISTORY. either that he had baptized the Earl of Rutland's child according to the prohibited ritual of th<? Church of England, or for retaining in his possession the seal of the county palatine, he was again committed to the custody ofthe serjeant-at-arms, in which restraint he continued above six months. On the total abolition of episcopacy in 1646, and the consequent deprivation of his remaining reve nues, his character was so highly respected in parliament that he was allowed an annuity of _-?800 ; but as no fund was assigned from whence this sum should be derived, old Sir Henry Arane advised him to petition for some other means of settling it ; and, either at the importunity of Sir Henry or some other of the bishop's friends, the sum of _fl000 was ordered to be paid him out of Goldsmith's Hall, in part of the grant. \"With this sum the bishop paid all his debts, and purchased an annuity of _P200 a year, charged on Sir George Saville's estate, and which was regularly paid till his death. In 1648-9, he was turned out of Durham House by the soldiers, who were placed there in garrison ; and he was afterwards successively entertained in the houses of the Earl and Countess of Rutland ; Captain Thomas Saunders, at Flamstead, in Hertfordshire; Mr. Thomas Rotheram, at Luton, in Bedfordshire ; and Sir Henry Yelverton, at Easton-Manduit, in Northamptonshire. He died at the latter place, where he had been treated with great kindness, on September 22, 1659, in his 95th year, and was buried, according to his own desire, in the chancel of the parish church there. His obsequies were intended to be private; but most of the neighbouring gentry and clergy attended and bore his pall. He bequeathed _P40 to a servant who attended him during his last illness, dCIO to the poor of the parish of Easton, his sacramental chalice and paten to the chapel built by Sir Henry Yelverton, and the remainder of his property, not exceeding dPIOO, was sufficient to defray his funeral expenses, and to provide a small monument to his memory. To return to the transactions in the palatinate : On September 3, 1640, Sir AVilliam Belasyse, high sheriff of Durham, and Sir AVilliam Lambton, waited on General Lesley at Newcastle, to give security for supplying the Scots army, during their stay, with forage and provisions. The rents and profits of bishops, deans and chapters, and Popish recusants, were, at the same time, ordered to be seized for the use of the Scots; and the counties of Durham and Northumberland, and the town of Newcastle, were charged with the sum of _P850 per day, by weekly payments; or, if unable to support the burthen, Cumberland and AVestmoreland were to be called in to assist them. On the conclusion ofthe definitive treaty with Scotland, August 7, 1641, the government were indebted to the bishopric of Durham (the quota of which had been _P350 per day) in a balance of i?25,663, 13s. lOd. In November, 1642, the Earl of Newcastle formed the counties of Northum berland, Durham, Cumberland, Westmoreland, and the town of Newcastle, into an association for the king's service. In December, the earl, on his march from Newcastle into Yorkshire, encoun tered Captain Hotham, and a skirmish of several hours ensued (see Piercebridge). In January, 1644, the Scots army destined for the assistance of the parliament crossed the Tweed. They amounted to 18,000 foot and 3600 horse, and met with no serious opposition till they arrived before Newcastle, which was gallantly defended. Leaving six regiments of foot and some troops of horse to observe the garrison, they marched up the Tyne and the Derwent, and, on March 1, crossed the latter river at Ebchester, the foot passing in single file over a bridge of trees. They marched by way of Chester-le-Street, Lumley, and Herrington, to Sunderland, which town they entered on Monday the 4th of March. After several slight actions and partial successes over the troops of the Marquis of Newcastle, then stationed at Durham (see Sunderland and South Shields), the Scots moved by way of Easington to Quarrington Hill ; and the disasters of the royal party in Yorkshire having occasioned the recal of the marquis from the north, General Lesley ad vanced to Ferryhill, and next day to Darlington, where his horse came up with the rear of the"], [61, "GENERAL HISTORY. LIII marquis's army, and made some prisoners. The marquis entered York on the 19th of April ; and, on the 20th, Lesley joined the parliament forces under Fairfax at Tadcaster. The fatal battle of Marston Moor on the 2d of July, and the storming of Newcastle on the 19th of October, decided the contest ; and the bishopric of Durham fell entirely into the power of the parliament. It was in effect governed by Sir AViUiam Armine and the rest of the parliamentary commissioners, and by the noted family of Lilburn and Sir Arthur Hasilrigg, whose extensive purchases of lands belong ing to the see, sold by order of parliament, acquired him the name of the bishop of Durham. The See dissolved, 1646 \u2014 1660.

From 1646, a sheriff was appointed annually for the county of Durham by parliament, and accounted to the public treasury. Officers were chosen to act as seneschals in the room of the Halmot Court ; the ancient palatine courts of law and judicature were suspended ; and particular officers were appointed to sit on gaol-delivery. In 1651 and 1652, acts were passed for holding assizes, and also for the sale of the estates of several loyal gentlemen in Durham and Northumberland who had refused to compound. Fines on land were levied in the Court of Common Pleas at AVestminster. The lands of the dean and chapter were seized for the state's use; and, in 1656, a portion of them was appro priated to the foundation of a college (see City of Durham). Such of the clergy (including the greater portion of the parochial ministers) as refused to conform to the authorised Directory for Public AArorship, were ejected from their livings (one-fifth of the annual revenue being by order reserved for the maintenance of their wives and children), and their places filled by Presbyterian ministers. As usual, the \" powers that be\" had their flatterers ; for, in 1653, \"the humble and harty acknowledgments of many honest people in the county of Durham\" was presented to the Lord General Cromwell and his council of officers ; and, in 1658, the justices of the peace and grand jury presented a humble petition and address to the Protector, on the behalf of themselves and the county. In Cromwell's three parliaments, representatives were formally summoned from this county. \" In no place,\" says Surtees, \" was the return of royalty, with all its attendant circumstances of good and evil, hailed with a more pure and ardent spirit of loyalty than in the north. Throughout the whole kingdom, the long period of gloom and depression which the loyal party had suffered, prepared the way for that sudden burst of exulting joy which nearly deprived the nation of its senses, and made them, betwixt folly and generosity, incapable of availing themselves of the ad vantages which the moment presented for fixing proper limits to the power of the crown, and ob taining a just security for popular rights.\" The inhabitants of this county early petitioned for the restoration of the ancient county palatine, the bishop, and the clergy.* John Cosin, 1660 \u2014 I67I. John Cosin, S. T. P., dean of Peterborough ,-f- was nominated to the see of Durham on Novem ber 2, 1660, was consecrated on the 2d of December, enthroned by proxy on the 8th, and had. * Charles II. intended to establish a new order of knighthood in commemoration of his preservation, under the title of Knights of the Royal Oak, for which a return was made of fit persons with their qualifications. The following are the names, with the annual value of their estates, of those selected in the county of Dur ham : \u2014 Col. AVilliam Blakiston, Esq., \u00a3600; Anthony Byerly, Esq., \u00a3600; John Tempest, Esq., \u00a31000- Col- Robert Eden, Esq., \u00a31000; Mark Milbanke, Esq., \u00a32000; Ralph Millet, Esq., \u00a3600; Samuel Davi son, Esq., \u00a3600. The design was, however, laid aside, \"from fear of reviving the heats and jealousies of the late times.\" t Bishop Cosin was the eldest son of Giles Cosin, citizen of Norwich, where he was born November 30, 1595, and educated at the free school. When he was 13 years of age, his father died, and left him several freehold houses, all of which he gave up to his mother, reserving only an annuity of \u00a320 for his maintenance at Cambridge, where he was matriculated of Caius CoUege in 1610. He subsequently became chaplain and librarian to Overall, bishop of Lichfield, who died in 1619. Bishop Neile, however, now became the patron of Cosin, who successively received the 10th prebend in Durham cathedral, the archdeaconry of Cleveland and the rectory of Brancepeth. In 1626, he married Frances, daughter of Marmaduke Blakiston. of New ton Hall, prebendary of Durham. In 1628, he joined with the other members of the chapter in prosecuting Peter Smart, one of the prebendaries, before the High Commission Court (see City of Durham). In 1634, he was elected master of Peter House; and, in 1640, he served the office of vice-chancellor of the university, and was installed dean of Peterborough. For many years Dr. Cosin had held meetings with"], [63, "GENERAL HISTORY. LV restitution of the temporalties on the 14th of the same month. The inhabitants of the diocese re- ceived him with great demonstrations of joy. His first care was to reform the abuses which had crept into the churches; and, from his generous and sympathizing temper and courteous deport- ment, he was soon universally respected and esteemed. He published a new Book of Canons, and appointed all the usual officers within the palatinate. Munificence, charity, and public spirit, were the distinguishing traits in his character ; for, considering himself merely as the steward of the large revenues of his bishopric, he expended a great part of them in public works. Durham Castle was repaired ; the bishop's house at Darlington was restored ; and the castle at Auckland, which had been rebuilt by Sir Arthur Hasilrigge, was, from some superstitious motive, pulled down, and the present building, with its magnificent chapel, reared on its scite; which undertakings cost no less than ,\u00a326,000. The bishop also rebuilt and augmented the endowment of Cardinal Langley's hospital and schools, and founded the library on the Palace Green (see City of Durham), the building of which cost _f800, and the books =\u00a3?1000; and he was instrumental in promoting the repairs of the other public buildings of the city. When his children were named to him to deter him from the execution of these expensive works, he replied, \" The church is my first-born.'\" To the university of Cambridge he was a liberal benefactor; and, amongst other miscellaneous dona- tions during his life, he gave i?500 towards the redemption of Christian captives in Algiers, \u00a3J800 to the fund for the relief of distressed loyalists, \u00a3J50 towards the rebuilding of St. Paul's cathedral, and -P100 towards repairing the sea banks in Howdenshire. AVhen he was appointed to this see, most of the church leases were expired, so that he received not less than \u00a3'20,000 for fines on re newals ;* and, during the eleven years of his episcopacy, he spent \u00a3?2000 per annum for pious and Bishop Laud and other divines, who were distinguished for their zeal for the ceremonies of the Church of England, and which was magnified by the Puritans into an inclination to Popery. A book he published in 1627, entitled \"A Collection of Private Devotions,\" met with their particular censure. The top of the frontispiece, which was considered peculiarly obnoxious, had the three capital letters I. H. S., upon which there was a cross encircled with the sun, supported by two angels, with two devout women praying towards it. This book was severely animadverted upon by Henry Burton, in his \"Examination of Private Devo- tions, or The Hours of Prayer,\" &c. ; and by W. Prynne, in his \" Brief Survey and Censure of Mr. Cosin's cozening Devotions,\" &c. On November 7, 1640, Peter Smart presented a petition to the House of Com- mons, complaining in most aggravated terms of Cosin's superstitious and Popish innovations in the church of Durham, and of his own severe prosecution; and, on January 22, 1640-1, the house voted the sequestra- tion of all Cosin's ecclesiastical benefices. On March 13, twenty-one articles of impeachment were exhi- bited against him by the Commons at the bar of the House of Lords, such as removing the communion table and setting it altar-ways ; using a consecrated knife to cut the bread at the sacrament ; singing an anthem instead of a psalm after sermon ; setting up 300 wax tapers in the cathedral on Candlemas night ; wearing a white satin cope, which he left off when he married, and buying a cope with the picture of the Trinity from a convicted Jesuit; setting up the picture of the Saviour with a golden beard and blue cap, done in glass by a Popish glazier, &c. &c. It would be tedious to repeat here tbe answers to these frivolous charges. Cosin was dismissed on bail, and never again called on to attend. He was, however, committed to the serjeant-at- arms, on a charge \" of having seduced a young scholar to Popery,\" which he satisfactorily disproved. In 1642, he was an active instrument in sending the college plate from Cambridge to supply the royal mint at York, and was consequently ejected from his mastership of Peter House. He shortly after withdrew to Paris, where he officiated as chaplain to the Protestant part of Queen Henrietta-Maria's house hold, and received a small pension from the French government. During seventeen years of exile and po verty, he resisted all the arguments and promises which were employed to draw him into the communion of the church of Rome, and remained the firm defender of the ceremonials and doctrines of that of England. On the return of King Charles II. , Cosin was restored to his deanery of Peterborough, and was the first minister who read the Common Prayer in that cathedral after the Restoration. He was soon after desig nated for the deanery of Durham, but before his institution was nominated to the bishopric. * The lease of the manors of Gateshead and AVhickham for 99 years, granted by Bishop Barnes to Queen Elizabeth, being near expiring, Bishop Cosin granted a concurrent lease thereof to his son-in-law, Sir GU-"], [64, "LVI GENERAL HISTORY. charitable uses. Besides the numerous bequests to the church and the poor contained in Bishop Cosin's will,* he left property to his family worth =P20,000. He died in London, weighed down with age and acute disease, January 15, 1671 ; and his corpse was conveyed with great pomp to Auckland, and interred in the chapel there on the 29th of April following. His person was tall, his countenance open and dignified, and his demeanour manly, with even some mixtuie of coun try plainness and occasional asperity of manner. The bishops of Durham had continued to enjoy their own separate court of wards, which was left untouched by the act of 27 Henry VIII. In 1661, however, an act was passed for its aboli tion ; and the loss was compensated to Cosin and his successors by the remission of \u00a3 880 per an num, part of the fee-farm rent of \u00a3T000 imposed by Queen Elizabeth for the garrison of Berwick. By the Act of Uniformity, passed August 24, 1662, eighteen ministers in the county of Durham were ejected from their livings for Nonconformity. During Cosin's episcopacy, the right of the <\u25a0 ounty and city of Durham to send members to parliament was warmly agitated ; and the bishop lost much of his well-earned popularity by his opposition to the wishes of the people. Nathaniel Crewe, 1674 \u2014 1721. The Hon. Nathaniel Crewe, LL. D.,-f- was translated from the see of Oxford to Durham on Oc tober 22, 1674, nearly three years after the death of Bishop Cosin ; during which time, according to AA^illis, the revenues of the bishopric were received by the Duke of Monmouth. Bishop Crewe was enthroned on the 10th of November, and received restitution of the temporalties soon after. In June, 1675, he made a triumphant entry into Durham, and, in the following year, visited his whole diocese. His compliances with the policy of the Duke of York were so great, that his father, Lord Crewe, was ashamed to sit in the House of Peers with him. In 1677> he was a candidate for the archbishopric of York ; and, in the same year, evinced his zeal against the Scottish Cove- bert Gerrard, for 21 years; which the dean and chapter refusing to confirm, they were summoned to attend the king and council; and the king asking Dean Sudbury if it was against his conscience to confirm this lease, he answered, \"No, but \" and was going to give his reasons against it- The king replied, \"If it is not against your conscience, I will have no buts, so go home and confirm it;\" which was done accord ingly. \u2014 Gray's MSS. * In this will he laments his \"lost son,\" who twice forsook the Protestant religion, and at last took orders in the church of Rome. One of the bishop's daughters was guilty at least of levity ; and Surtees charitably argues that these troubles, together with a painful disease, may account for a little vein of sharpness and asperity which pervades Cosin's private correspondence. t Fifth son of John, first Lord Crewe, of Stene, in Northamptonshire, where he was born on January 31 1633. He was educated at Lincoln College. Oxford ; and, in 1668, was elected rector of Lincoln, and ap pointed Clerk of the Royal Closet. His birth and insinuating manners soon rendered him a favourite at court; and, in 1669, he was installed dean of Chichester. In 1671, he became bishop of Oxford, which see he held with the rectory of Whitney in commendam. In 16/3, he performed the marriage ceremony of the Duke of York with Mary of Este, with no other authority than an order under the kind's privy signet, and in opposition to the wishes of the House of Commons. The duke's interest soon afterprocured for Crewe the vacant see of Durham, for which Bishops Compton, AArard, and Dolben were suitors. In Gray's MSS. is the following relation, which, he remarks, was ex, relatione Rich. I. Earl of Scarborough, A. D. 1715:__ \" After Bishop Crewe had got a promise of the bishopric of Durham, it was long before he could o*et jnt0 possession, though he diligently solicited matters ; but still something hindered, which he could not find out, till he applied to Lord Lumley : Mylord discovered, that the king had promised a sum to be paid Mrs! Eleanor Gwyn out of this bishopric, and without agreeing with her, nothing could be done : AVhereupon the bishop, by his agent, applied to her, and agreed to pay 5 or \u00a36000.

LVII ranters by raising the militia of his diocese, and entertaining the Duke of Monmouth in his pro- gress to and return from Scotland. On the accession of King James II. , Bishop Crewe was made a privy counsellor and dean of the chapel royal. He was one of the ecclesiastical commissioners appointed by the king, and exercised his powers with such rigour that he obtained the name of grand inquisitor. In 1687, ne offered to attend the pope's nuncio, on his public entry into Lon- don ; but his coachman refused to drive him. The Revolution followed; and though the bishop endeavoured to ingratiate himself with the prevailing party by joining in the vote that James had abdicated the throne, he was excepted, by name, out of the general pardon granted by William and Mary, and, in 1689, fled to Holland. He returned, however, in July, and took the oaths to the new government ; when he is said to have made his peace by placing the patronage of all his cathedral clergy at the disposal of the crown. Notwithstanding his obsequiousness, he remained neglected till the accession of Queen Anne, when he acquired some popularity by voting in favour of Dr. Sacheverell, and regained the office of lord lieutenant of the county of Durham, of which he had been deprived. The accession of George I. again threw him into the shade. Bishop Crewe married, in 1691, Penelope, daughter of Sir William Frowde, and widow of Sir Hugh Tynte. She died in 1699, when he married Mrs. Dorothy Forster, daughter of Sir AVilliam Forster, of Bambrough, co. Northumberland, to whom he had paid his addresses previous to his first marriage. On the death of his last surviving brother in 1697, l>e succeeded to the barony and family estates at Stene, and was the first person in England summoned to attend parliament both as baron and bishop. In 1715 occurred Lord Derwentwater's insurrection in Northumber land, which, however, does not appear to have produced any corresponding movement in the county of Durham. The bishop's brother-in-law, John Forster, Esq., general of the rebel army, forfeited Bambrough and his other estates to the crown. They were purchased by Lord Crewe, and demised to charitable purposes (see General Charities). This splendid bequest has thrown a veil over the political tergiversations of the testator; and, as Hutchinson observes, \" Many men have been canonized for much inferior works of beneficence than those of this prelate.\" He died at Stene, September 18, 1721, in his 89th year, and was buried in the beautiful little chapel there.* William Talbot, 1721\u2014 1730. In October, 1721, AVilliam Talbot, S. T. P., who had been successively bishop of Oxford and of Salisbury, was translated to Durham. -f- He was soon after made Governor of the Charter-house ; and, on the death of the Earl of Scarborough, the king appointed him lord lieutenant and custos. rotulorum of the county palatine of Durham. He rendered himself extremely unpopular in 1722, * \"Bishop Crewe felt the ruling passion strong in death; as he lay dying on the marble slab before the fire, he cried out, in almost his last moments, to his chaplain Richard Gray, ' Dick ! Dick ! don't go over to them :' an attachment to his master's blood, easily accounted for from the early bias which his political opinions received, and which in age would press on his mind with all the powerful associations connected with his best days, and which it would be difficult to blame, had he not paid, in spite of indifference and insult, such servile homage to the princes of Nassau and Hanover, who filled the Stuart's throne. ' That my lord was an extraordinary landlord, and one of the best of masters,' was probably very true ; and one can only lament that the peculiar circumstances of the times were such as to throw cruel sunshine on weak- ness and servility of mind, which in happier days might have passed unnoticed ; whilst Lord Crewe's private virtues and warm and active benevolence might have found an equal sphere of action.\" \u2014 Surtees, vol. i. page cxix. t In the same year, he appeared on horseback, at a review, in the king's train, in a lay habit of purple, with jack boots and his hat cocked, and a black wig, tied behind, like a military officer \u2014 Sykes's Local Records.

Sir John Eden, one of the members for the county of Durham, strenuously opposed the bill, for which he was much applauded by his constituents* Bishop Talbot, aggravated by this defeat, raised the fines on his leases, and encouraged the dean and chapter to advance theirs. He was so extravagant that the ample revenues of his bishopric were not adequate to his expenditure ; and his debts are said to have been twice paid by his vir tuous and distinguished son, Lord Chancellor Talbot. Bishop Talbot died in London, October 10, 1730. Edward Chandler, 1730 \u2014 1750. Edward Chandler, S. T. P., bishop of Lichfield, was translated to Durham on November 5, 1730. He was a learned and ingenious divine ; and his \" Defence of Christianity,\" against Collins, has been particularly noticed. He never sold any of his patent offices, though he was offered large sums of money for them, but always conferred them on the most deserving; and he gave \u00a350 to wards augmenting Monkwearmouth curacy, \u00a3200 to purchase a house for the minister of Stock ton, and _f?2000 to be laid out in a purchase for the benefit of clergymen's widows in the diocese of Durham. He died of the stone in London, July 20, 1750. The king being absent on the con tinent, two months elapsed before the appointment of a successor. Joseph Butler, 1750 \u2014 17-52, Joseph Butlers- was translated from the bishopric of Bristol to that of Durham on September 7, 1750, and was enthroned by proxy on the 9th of November following. During the short time which he held this see, he conciliated all hearts by the modesty and sweetness of his disposition, his hospitality, and the fervent piety of his discourses. \" During the ministerial performance of the sacred office,\" says Surtees, \" a divine animation seemed to pervade his whole manner, and * Sir John was received, on his return to the county, by a cavalcade of 1500 horse. The bishop got up a counter-procession for himself, and came into Durham, January 23, 1723, with 30 coaches in his train. t He was the youngest of eight children of Thomas Butler, a reputable tradesman at Wantage-, in Berk shire, where he was born in 1692. His genius and taste for learning induced his father, who was a Pro testant Dissenter, to design him for the ministry, and to give him a suitable education. During his studies, however, he became a convert, after mature examination, to the doctrines of the Established Church ; and his father, after employing various Dissenting ministers to convince him of his supposed errors, at length permitted him to remove to Oxford. He soon after took orders ; and, through the interest of Dr. Clarke and Mr. Edward Talbot (son of Talbot, then bishop of Salisbury), was appointed Preacher at the Rolls Chapel. In 1721, Mr. Talbot, on his death-bedj recommended Mr. Butler to his father, who had become bishop of Durham, and who promoted him in succession to the rectories of Haughton-le-Skerne and Stan hope. He now lived entirely at his rectory-house, and devoted himself exclusively to the exercise of his parochial duties. In allusion to his retirement, the following anecdote has been related : \u2014 Some one hap pening to mention him at court, the queen remarked that she thought Mr. Butler was dead : \" No, madam,\" replied Archbishop Blackburn, \"but he is buried.\" In 1732, Lord Chancellor Talbot made Mr. Butler his chaplain, and gave him a prebendal stall at Rochester. Being thus brought back into public life, he soon attracted a degree of notice which his modesty had hitherto avoided ; and, in 1736, he was appointed clerk of the closet to Queen Caroline, in which office he presented her with his celebrated \" Analogy of Religion.\" Her death did not prevent his promotion; for in 1738 he was nominated to the see of Bristol, and in 1740 was installed dean of St. Paul's, when he resigned the rectory of Stanhope. In 1746, he succeeded Egerton, bishop of Hereford, as clerk of the royal closet."], [67, "GENERAL HISTORY.

Richard Trevor, 1752\u20141771. On September 9, 1752, Richard Trevor, S. T. P., fourth son of Thomas, first Lord Trevor of Bromham, was translated from the see of St. David's to that of Durham, and was enthroned on the 29th of December following. During his episcopacy, he resided all the summer months at Dur ham or Auckland, and made great improvements at the latter place. In 1759, he stood an unsuc cessful contest for the chancellorship of the university of Oxford, against the Earls of Lichfield and AArestmoreland, who joined their interests in favour of AVestmoreland. Bishop Trevor died in London, after a long and painful illness, which he bore with great fortitude, on June 9, 177L an<l was privately interred at Glynde in Sussex.* John Egerton, 177^ \u2014 17-87- John Egerton, B. C.

Though the county was at that time torn in pieces by the animosities remaining after two elec tions, he succeeded in conciliating both parties to himself, and became deservedly popular with all ranks. He granted a new charter to the city of Durham, but afterwards declined every solicita tion to bring any of his own family forward as candidates. He died in London on January 18, 17*87, and was privately interred in St. James's church. + Thomas Thurlow, 1787 \u2014 1791- In 1787-) Thomas Thurlow, D.

D.,\u00a7 was translated from the see of Salisbury to that of Durham on June 19, 1791 ; and, on August 4, he made a public entry into his diocese. Several of the * Mr. AUan, in 1775, issued from his private press a \"Sketch of the Life and Character\" of this worthy prelate, in which he speaks in raptures of his virtues, and says he answered in every thing to St. Paul's de scription of a Christian bishop. By his will, he bequeathed no less than \u00a33450 to the following charitable uses, viz. \u2014 To the Newcastle Infirmary, \u00a3500; to Durham and Auckland, forthe relief of the poor, \u00a3200; to the parishes of Glynd and Beddington, in Sussex, and St. George's, in London, each \u00a350 for the poor; to Christ Church College, Oxford, \u00a31000; to the corporation for relief of clergymen's widows, \u00a3500; to the AVestminster Infirmary and SmaU Pox Hospital, each \u00a3300; and to the Society for Propagating the Gospel, \u00a3500. t By his first wife, Lady Anne Sophia Grey, daughter of Henrv, Duke of Kent, Bishop Egerton left issue two sons, of whom the eldest became Earl of Bridgewater on the death of Francis, the third duke of that title, in 1803 ; and the youngest, Francis Henry, succeeded his brother in 1823 (see City op Durham).

Sir Francis Barrington married the aunt of OUver Cromwell ; and"], [68, "LX GENERAL HISTORY. bishop's charges to his clergy were published in succession; and one of them, \" The Grounds on which the Church of England separated from the Church of Rome,\" gave rise to a literary contro versy between a Catholic clergyman and some of the Established clergy of Durham, in the course of which the bishop himself published \" The Grounds on which the Church of England separated from the Church of Rome, reconsidered. In 1815, he closed his literary career with a \" Sketch of the Political Life of his much-beloved Brother, the second Account Barrington.\" Though warmly attached to that Establishment of which he himself was so distinguished a member, Bishop Barrington associated freely with men of every religious persuasion, from the Catholic to the Quaker. In his episcopal character, he was a strict observer of discipline amongst his successors became adherents of the popular party. On a failure of issue, their estate passed by will to John Shute, nephew to the wife of another Francis Barrington, and who assumed the name and arms of that family. Being a Presbyterian, he had published two anonymous tracts on dissent, in which he was assisted by Locke, who introduced him to Lord Somers. That statesman was so pleased with his young friend, that he intrusted to his management the project then designed by the Whigs for effecting a union between the kingdoms of England and Scotland, and which was accomplished chiefly through his exertions. In 1708, he was rewarded with a seat at the Board of Customs, which he held three years, but, on the change of administration, was displaced. The loss, however, was made up in another way by a Mr. AVildman, who, though no relative, left him his whole estate ; and, about the same time, the Barrington property, as above Stated, descended to him. On the accession of George I., Mr. Barrington was elected M. P. for Berwick; and in 1720, the king, without his knowledge, created him a peer of Ireland, by the titles of Baron and Vis count Barrington. In 1723, he incurred considerable odium, and was turned out of the House of Commons, on account of the failure of a project called the Harburgh Lottery, of which he had been induced to become deputy-governor. He subsequently retired to private life, and died on December 14, 1734, in consequence of a hurt which he received by being thrown out of a chaise. His lordship left a widow, who was the daugh ter and coheir of Sir AVilliam Daines. By her he had nine children, six sons and three daughters. AVilliam, the second lord, became secretary at war and chancellor of the exchequer, and died without issue in 1793. Francis died an infant. John became a major-general in the army, and died in 1764. Daines was bred to the law, and, after being recorder of Bristol, was made one of the judges for North AVales, which office he exchanged for the second justiceship of Chester: he was a distinguished naturalist and antiquary, and died unmarried in 1800. Samuel was brought up in the navy, and acquired high distinction as an admiral during the American war: he died at Bath within a few months of his brother the judge- See Sedgefikld. Shute, the sixth son of John, first Lord Barrington, was born at Becket, in Berkshire, May 26, 1734. After an education at Eton and Oxford, where he was for some years Fellow of Merton College, he entered into holy orders, was appointed chaplain to King George II. and afterwards to King George III. In 1761, he was made canon of Christ Church, and soon after married Lady Diana Beauclerk, only daughter of Charles, second Duke of St. Alban's; but her ladyship died in 1766, without issue. In 1768, Dr. Barring ton was promoted to a canonry of St. Paul's; and on October 4, in the following year, he was consecrated bishop of Llandaff. On June 20, 1770, he married his second wife, Jane, only daughter of Sir J. Guise, of Rendcombe, Gloucestershire, and heiress of her brother, Sir AVilliam, the last baronet. This lady died with out issue, on August 8, 1808, at her hereditary seat, Mongewell, in Oxfordshire, which continued to be the favourite residence of the bishop during the remainder of his life. In 1770, on account of his wife's delicate health, he exchanged his canonry of St. Paul's for one in the collegiate church at Windsor. In 1779, he introduced a bill into the House of Peers for the prevention of adultery, and which was passed and sent to the Commons, but was there thrown out on the second reading. In 1783, the king, against the wishes of the prime minister, and without the knowledge of Bishop Barrington, promoted the latter to the vacant see of Salisbury, where the bishop opened a subscription for repairing and beautifying the cathedral. It is re lated that while the work was going on, a gentleman plainly dressed visited the \"cathedral one day, and, after surveying the place, asked the person in attendance to let him see the subscription book, which was pro duced ; when he immediately presented a bank bill for \u00a31000 as his donation. The officer stared, and re spectfully desired to know what change he must return, and what name he should enter. \" Oh,\" said the stranger, \" take the whole and place it to the account of a country gentleman of Berkshire.\" This was done and the country gentleman was afterwards discovered in George \"III. On the death of Bishop Thurlow, his majesty, though great exertions were made in favour of Cornwallis bishop of Lichfield and others, bestowed the vacant bishopric of Durham on \" his bishop,\" as he always termed Dr. Barrington.

In 1809, he was involved in a law-suit respect ing the rents of some lead-mines belonging to the see, the leases of which had expired for several years, without being renewed. On a discovery of the fact, a bill was filed in Chancery to recover the arrears ; and the cause, on being sent down to the Court of King's Bench, was decided in fa vour of the bishop, who recovered thereby nearly _P60,000; but, instead of taking any part of this sum to his own use, he appropriated the whole to the establishment of schools in his diocese, and the formation of a fund for poor clergymen and their widows. He had made a similar application of the proceeds which accrued to him on the division of FramweUgate and Brasside Moors and Witton-Gilbert Common in 1801. See General Charities. When Bishop Barrington had held the episcopal office 50 years (including the time he was bishop of Llandaff and Salisbury), the clergy of the diocese of Durham erected, at the cost of \u00a3'2300, a large charity-school at Newcastle upon Tyne, and distinguished it by the name of \" The Clergy Jubilee School,\" in commemoration of the event. The bishop repaired Durham Castle, and subscribed liberally to most of the public works and institutions in his diocese. Though in the latter years of his life he secluded himself very much from company, he was in the habit of receiving a few chosen friends at his hospitable table, when his discourse was always pleasant, and of a religious cast. During his last year, he spent several months at Worthing, in Sussex, where he resided in the mansion which had been for a short time occupied by the Princess Charlotte of Wales. After about five weeks' illness at his town's house in Cavendish Square, London, he read the appointed Sunday lessons to his assembled household, and feelingly told them it was for the last time. A few mornings after, on March 25, 1826, he expired tranquilly, and almost impercep tibly to his attendants, at the great age of 92- He was buried, according to his own injunctions, in the most private manner ; his remains being deposited near those of his second lady, in the vault of Mongewell church. In his person he was tall and upright ; his features were very pre possessing, and his manner was equally engaging. As a preacher, he was in his day of no mean order ; and as a speaker in the House of Lords, he was always heard with attention and respect. Of his charities, a late writer observes, \" We may almost say that they were universal, and yet they were dispensed with that care which evinced a mind capable of thought and discrimination, and manifested at the same time those deep, intense feelings of delicacy and true Christian bene volence which, in the right-minded, invariably go hand in hand.\"-(- * Amongst these may be named his chaplains, Drs- Owen and Blayney ; Dr. Burgess, now bishop of Sa lisbury ; Dr. Paley ; the Rev. Joseph Dacre Carlyle, well known by his travels in the East, and his know ledge ofthe Oriental languages; Dr. Holmes, editor ofthe Greek Bible; Dr. Bell, inventor ofthe Madras System of Education ; the Rev. G. S. Faber, a learned writer on the Prophecies ; and Dr. Gray, now bishop of Bristol. Bishop Barrington frequently resisted the improper solicitations of his friends for church prefer ment. A relative of Mrs. Barrington, having experienced some difficulties in life, applied to the bishop for orders, thinking that thereby he should secure a handsome provision. His lordship, knowing the motive by which his kinsman was actuated, asked him what preferment would satisfy him. The applicant frankly answered, that five hundred a year would abundantly meet all his wants. \" You shall have it,\" said the bishop, \" but not out of the patrimony of the church. I will not take away the bread from those who have earned it by their labours, to bestow it upon a relation. You shall have the income you have mentioned, yearly, out of my own pocket.\" \u2014 Ann.

On July 21, he arrived at the city of Durham, and was installed in the cathedral. In July, 1827, he held visitations and confirmations for the first time in the towns of his diocese. The principal events connected with the church of Durham since the accession of this venerable prelate are, the passing of the Durham Church Estate Bill, in May, 1832, \" for separating the rectory of Easington, in the county of Durham, from the archdeaconry of Durham, and annexing in lieu thereof a prebend or canonry in the cathedral church of Durham;\" and the foundation of the University (see City of Durham). In September, 1832, part ofthe clergy of Northumber land memorialized the bishop and the king on a reform of the church. The memorial to their diocesan was signed by 37 clergymen, and that to the king by 43. This is understood to have been the first attempt of the Established clergy to reform their own church. to be applied towards the augmentation of small livings in the diocese of Durham, and directs his executors, as soon after his decease as conveniently may be, to purchase in the joint names of the bishop of Durham, the archdeacon of Durham, and the archdeacon of Northumberland, for the time being, the sum of \u00a33333, 6s. 8d. three per cent, consols, in trust, to accumulate the same; and when the dividend and the accumula tions, or any addition which mav be made by any persons, shall, in the opinion of the bishop and archdeacons, amount to a competent sum of money for the purposes after mentioned, they are to signify the same to the Governors of Queen Anne's Bounty, and request their concurrence in augmenting, from the accumulated fund, and by a competent sum from the funds under their disposition, one or more poor livings in the diocese of Durham, in the manner prescribed by the rules for the regulation of Queen Anne's Bounty ; and if the governors of that corporation shall concur in this good work, the bishop and archdeacons shall dispose of the dividends and the accumulated fund towards effecting the object in view ; but if the governors do not con cur, then the bishop is to dispose of the funds as he shall think proper for the benefit of such incumbents of poor livings. If by the augmentation of all the poor livings in the diocese, or by any other means, the ob jects of this benefaction shall, in the opinion of the bishop of Durham for the time being, fail, then the bishop is to apply the \u00a33333, 6s. 8d. as he shall think proper for the benefit of the objects of the charity for the relief of poor widows and children of the clergy, commonly called the Corporation of the Sons of the Clergy, and in extension of that branch of the charity called Special Cases.

URHAM is a maritime county palatine, deriving its name from its chief city. It arose gradually with the patrimony of the church out of Northumberland, a kingdom which at one time included all the country between the Humber and the Frith of Forth. The county of Durham is now ecclesiastically compre- hended in the diocese to which it gives name, and in the province of York ; and judicially situated in the northern circuit. Its geographical situation is between 54 deg. 30 min. and 55 deg. north latitude, and between 1 deg. 18 min. and 2 deg. 21 min. west longitude. It is bounded on the east by the German Ocean ; on the south and south-west by the river Tees, dividing it from Yorkshire and Westmoreland ; and on the west by a short imaginary line, divid- ing it from Cumberland. On the north-west and north it is divided from Northumberland by an imaginary line from between Kilhope Cross and Coal Clough to Blanchland, by the winding course of the Derwent nearly to Chopwell, by the Milk Burn, by a short imaginary line from its head to that of Stanley Burn, by the latter rivulet to the Tyne near Bradley, and by that river from thence to the sea. Within these limits the county forms a triangle, the point of which is to the west. Its greatest length from east to west is 45 miles, and its greatest breadth 36; its circumfe rence being nearly 180 miles. According to the view of Mr. Rickman, it extends over 1061 square miles, or 679,040 acres, 582,035 acres being under cultivation. Besides the city of Durham, the county includes seven ancient boroughs, by charter or prescrip tion, viz. Hartlepool, Barnard Castle, Auckland, Darlington, Sunderland, Stockton, and Gates head ; four other market towns, Staindrop, AVolsingham, Stanhope, and Sedgefield ; and 223 villages. It was formerly divided into four AA7ards;* Darlington, Stockton, Easington, and Ches ter : but, under the authority of an act of parliament passed in 1829, a new AVard, that of Durham, occupying the centre of the county, was formed.

Besides the main body of the county, above described, it includes several scattered members, viz. 1. Norhamshire and Islandshire, including Holy Island, and a portion of the main land ex tending from the North Tweed on the north-west to the sea on the east, and separated from Northumberland on the south partly by the course of the Till, and partly by an imaginary line. 2. Bedlingtonshire, lying in the heart of Northumberland, betwixt the rivers Blyth and AVansbeck. These are usually termed the North Bishopric, and are included in Chester Ward. 3. The insu lated territory of Craike, in the wapontake of Bulmer in Yorkshire, which is considered as parcel of Stockton AArard.

Climate, Soil and Aspect, Rivers, &c. \" The air of this county,\" says the Magna Britannia, \" is generally very good, but something sharp on the hills, and colder in the west parts than east ; which bordering all along upon the sea, the warm breezes coming from thence, dissolve both the snow and the ice.\" Though the weather is frequently inconstant, the spring cold and severe, the summer and autumn subject to chilling colds, and the winter often rapidly alternating between frost and thaw, yet the duration of human life is here nearly the same as in the southern districts of England; and numerous instances of longevity will be noticed in various parts of this work. Very terrible thunder-storms, or blights of a pernicious nature, seldom occur. The western angle of the county of Durham is hilly and mountainous, with black, naked, and barren regions, crossed by that ridge of high hills which has not unaptly been called the Appen nines of England, and from the sides of which issue numerous streams flowing to the sea. There are some beautiful and fertile valleys in the eastern and central parts, pleasantly varied with hill and dale, and alternately appropriated to corn and pasture. The waste lands occupy nearly 100,000 acres of the western parts of the county ; but in the southern districts many hundred acres have been inclosed and cultivated within the last 40 years. The common fields are now but few; forthe land belonging to the townships has been gradually inclosing for above a century^. There is a great portion of wet ground still remaining, although draining is carried on to a great extent. Near the river Tees, and on some spots bordering on the other rivers, the soil is loam or a rich clay. At a farther distance from these rivers, the soil is of an inferior quality, and marshy, with patches of gravel interspersed. The hills between the sea and an imaginary line from Barnard Castle on the Tees to Alansford on the Derwent, are covered with a dry loam, the fertility of which varies with its depth. From this bne westward, the summits as well as the sides of the hills are moorish wastes, in the midst of which numerous streams of water pursue a somewhat rapid course over rocky beds or blocks of various kinds of stone. The woodlands of Durham are not of very considerable extent, trees being chiefly confined to the parks and seats of the nobility and gentry ; but many plantations have been made of late years. The banks of the rivers and brooks, however, particularly in the vicinity of the city of Durham, are fringed with wood of long growth and much value."], [73, "STATISTICAL DESCRIPTION. LXV The county of Durham is well watered by large rivers and brooks. The principal livers are the Tees, AVear, and Tyne,* with their respective tributary streams, the Skerne, Gaunless, and Der- * Hollingshed gives the following circumstantial descriptions of the Tees and the AVear : \u2014 \" The THESE, a river that beareth and feedeth an excellent salmon, riseth in the Black Lowes, above two miles flat west of the southerlie head of Were called Burdop, and south of the head of AVest Alen, and thence runneth through Tildale forest, and taking in the Langdon-ivaler from northwest, it runneth to Durtpit chapel, to Newbiggin, and so to Middleton, receiving by west of each of these a rill comming from by north (of which the last is called HudeJ, and likewise the Lune afterward by southwest, that riseth at three several places, whereof the first is in the borders of AVestmerland and there called Arnegill-becke, the second more southerlie named Lune-becke, and the third by south at Bandor Skarth-hill, and meeting all above Arnegill-house, they run togither in one bottome to Lathekirke-bridge, and then into the These. Having therefore met with these, it runneth to Mickleton, and there taking in the Skiririth-waler, it goeth to Rombaldkirke, crossing there also one rill and the Bander-brooke by southwest, and then going to Morewood-hag and Morewood-parke, till it come to Bernard's castell. Here also it receiveth the Thurcsgi/l-iraler coming east of Rere-crosse in Yorkshire from the Spittle in Stanmore by Crag almost southwest, and being united with the These, it goeth by Stratford, Eglesdon, Rokesbie, Thorpe, Wickliffe, Ovington, AVinston, and betwene Barfurth and Gain- furth meeteth with another rill, that commeth from Langleie forest, betwene Rabie castell and Standorpe, of whose name I have no knowledge. But to proceed, the These being past Ramfurth, runneth betwene Per- sore and Cliffe, and in the waie to Croftsbridge taketh in the Skerne, a pretie water, which riseth above Trimdon, and goeth bv Fishburne, Bradburie, Preston, Braforton, Skirmingham, the Burdons, Haughton, and Darlington, and there finallie meeting with the Cocke-becke or Dare, it falleth in the These beneath Stapleton before it come at Croftsbridge, and (as it should seeme) is the same which Leland calleth Gretteie or Grettie. \u00a3The Greta, not mentioned by Hollingshed, falls into the Tees from the south, below Barnard Castle] From thence it runneth to Sockburne, nether Dunsleie, Middleton-row, Newsham, Yarne (cross- ing a brooke from Levenbridge) called Levin, or Lcuinus in Latin, whose crinkling course is notable, and the streame of some called Thorpe- After this the These hasteth on to Barwic, Preston, Thorn abbeie, and Arsham, which standeth nn the southeast side of the river almost betwene the falls of two waters, whereof one deseendeth from AVest Hartburne, by Long Newton, Elton, and Stockton ; the other from fStillington or Shillington, by AVhitton, Thorpe, Blackeston, Billingham, and Norton. From Arsham finallie it goeth to Bellasis, Middleburgh, and so into the sea. \" Ptolemie writing of the AVERE, calleth it VEDRA. It riseth of three heads in Kelloppeslaw-hill, whereof the most southerlie is called Burdop, the middlemost Wallop, and the northerliext Kellop, which uniting themselves about St Johns chappeU, or a little by west thereof, their confluence runneth through Stanhope-parke, by east Yate, and so to Frosterlie. But yer it come there, it receiveth three rilles from the north in AVeredale, whereof one cometh in by Stanhope, another west of AVoodcroft-hall, and the third at Frosterlie afore-mentioned ; and a little beneath these, a fourth on the southside, which deseendeth from southwest by Bolliop, Bishop-sleie, Millhouses, and Landew. Being therefore united all with the Were, this stream goeth on to AVolsingham, there taking in the Wascropburne, beside another at Bradleie, the third at Harpleie-hall (and these on the northside) and the fourth, betweene AVitton and AAritton castell, called Bedburne, comming by Hamsterleie, whereby this river doth now wax verie great. Going therefore from hence, it hasteth to Bishop's Akeland and beneath it receiveth the Garond/csse, which riseth six miles by west of Akeland castell, and running south thereof, passeth by AVest-Akeland, St Helens Akeland, St An- drewes Akeland, and Bishops Akeland, and then into the AVear, which goeth to Newfield and Willington. Neere unto this place also, and somewhat beneath Sunderland, the AVear crosseth one brooke from southwest by Het, Coxseie, Cornefurth, Tursdale, and Croxdale, and two other from by northwest in one botome, whereof the first commeth from above Ash, by Langleie. The other called Coue, from above Kinchleie, by Newbiggin, Lanchester, North Langley, and through Bearepearke, and so meeting beneath Kelleie or Hed- leie with the other, they fall both as one into the AVere, betwene South Sunderland and Burnall. From hence our river goeth on to Howghwell, Shirkeleie, Old Duresme, and there taking in the Pidding-brooke by north east, it goeth to Duresme, Finkeleie, Harbarhouse, Lumleie castell, (where it meeteth with the Pilis, whose heads are united betwene Pelton and WhitweU, and after called Hedleie) and from thence to Lampton, Harraton, the Beddickes, Ufferton, Hilton-parke, Bishops AVeremouth, and so into the sea betwene North Sunderland and North AVeremouth towne, which now is called Monke AVeremouth.\" The Tyne is formed by the junction of two rivers, called the North and South Tyne. The source of the latter is in Cumberland, within a mile north of the Tees, the water of which was on one occasion conveyed into it for mining purposes. The course of the Tyne from the junction of its streams near Hexham, below which it becomes the boundary of the county of Durham, is thus described in the View of Northumberland : vol. i. \u2014 50. r"], [74, "LXVI GEOGRAPHICAL AND went. The attempts already made, and those in contemplation, to improve the navigation at the mouths of these rivers, will be found under the heads South Shields, Sunderland, and Stockton. Mineralogy. \u2014 Coal. The sciences of Geology and Mineralogy have of late years been popularly illustrated in so many different forms, that it is not necessary here to enter into the detail of subjects which would, indeed, occupy volumes. The valuable substance called coal, without which all other minerals would be comparatively useless, and our manufactures circumscribed within the smallest possible bounds, forms the most striking feature in the mineralogy of this district. Its origin has excited much geo logical discussion. It is a compound substance, consisting of charcoal, bitumen, or mineral pitch, and earthy matter. On subjecting it to distillation in close vessels, it first yields a watery liquor, then an etherial or volatile oil, afterwards volatile alkali, and lastly a thin and greasy oil. But it is remarkable, that by rectifying this last oil, a transparent, thin, and light oil, of a straw colour, is produced, which being exposed to air, becomes black, like animal oils. From this and other ob servations, it has been inferred, that all coals, bitumens, and other oily substances, found in the mineral kingdom, derive their origin from vegetables buried in the earth, during the successive progress of stratification ; since it is well known, that only organized bodies have the power of producing oily and fat substances. The vegetable origin of coal has been recently further illus trated by the use of the microscope ; and in all the varieties of coal found in the Newcastle coal field, more or less ofthe fine, distinct, net-like structure of the original vegetable texture, is dis played by that instrument. The vast quantities of fossil plants found in the sandstones and shales which are interstratified with the beds of coal, form another striking confirmation of the above opinion. These are often in an extraordinary degree of preservation ; for the most delicate leaves are spread out on the stone like the dried plants on the paper in the herbarium of a botanist. About 300 different species have been discovered in the coal-measures of this and other countries, all of which are such as must have grown in marshy or humid ground. \"All the strata incumbent on coal,\" observes the judicious AVhitehurst, \" contain a great variety of vegetables, or the impressions of them ; and particularly the bamboo of India, striated and jointed at different distances; the Euphorbia of the East Indies the American ferns, corn, grass, and many other species of the vegetable kingdom, not known to exist in any other part of the world in a living state.* They are inclosed in the solid substance of \" It proceeds with great majesty towards Corbridge, and on its way is augmented by the Devil AVater. This noble river then passes by the village of Bywell, and, running through a remarkably pleasant vale, reaches Newburn, about five or six miles above Newcastle ; then flowing through several beautiful windings, and receiving the clear streams of the Derwent, its course is intercepted by a large island, consisting of many acres, called the King's Meadow. Its divided streams rejoin at the confluence of the Teams ; and, in all the solemnity of majestic silence, it rolls its mighty waters along the feet of the northern metropolis. After running southward about a mile, its course is obstructed by many windings and projections of its banks \u25a0 but it soon opens into a remarkably fine and broad channel, called the Long Reach, through which its deep wa ters run in an even and regular course. At the end of this fine pool it spreads over\" the extensive flats of Jarrow Slake, and then contracting, the channel forms into an excellent bason for the whole lenoth of Shields capable of holding above two thousand sail of large ships. Its waters then pass through a narrow entrance' and join the German Ocean.\" ' The striking fact that these fossils are generally of such a size as to indicate a luxuriance of growth now known to exist only in tropical regions, has given rise to many curious fancies and theories amongst philoso phers. One has imagined that the globe itself was originaUy hot, and that it is gradually cooling Another supposes that the axis of the earth had a different incUnation from its present one. The most plausibl\""], [75, "STATISTICAL DESCRIPTION. lxvii stone and clay.\" Indeed, it is now the general opinion of geologists, that our beds of coal have been produced by vast quantities of plants carried down from the land and accumulated at the bottom of the sea, during a long succession of ages ; the numerous alternations, amounting to many hundreds, sometimes of sandstones, shales, and beds of coal, proving along duration in the process of deposition. Coal has been discovered in various stages of its transmutation from the vegetable substance. A piece was found in a pit on Lanchester Common, half fir wood and half coal. The schistus beds in the Holly Hill pit, near Felling, afforded beautiful specimens of pine cones, ears of barley, and roots of turnips, the last of which were converted into iron-stone. Many perfect specimens of plants have been found in Jarrow colliery. A tree about 28 or 30 feet long, with all its branches, was discovered some years ago in a bed of coal-sandstone at High Heworth, of which the trunk and larger branches are siliceous, while the bark, small branches, and leaves, are converted into coal.* Mr. Winch remarks that the small veins of coal, called by the miners coal-pipes, owe their origin universally to small branches of trees. Bivalve shells are frequently met with in the Newcastle coal-field, but no marine shells have been detected in it. y The Newcastle Coal Field is by far the most important of all those at present worked in Eng- land, both as regards the quantity produced and their quality. It occupies a hollow, or trough, of which the extreme length, from the Acklington colliery, near the Coquet, Northumberland, to Cockfield, is 58 miles; and the breadth from Bywell on the Tyne to the sea shore is 24 miles. It is bounded by the sea from the Coquet to the mouth of the Tyne, where the magnesian limestone first appears, which rests upon the coal measures,*f and gradually intrudes upon them to the south- west. This limestone forms the coast of the county of Durham from South Shields to Hartlepool ; and on the west it describes an undulating line, by Boldon, Hilton, Coxhoe, and Ferryhill, to the Tees below Winston bridge.;}. The western boundary of the coal field may be marked by an ima ginary line, drawn from Acklington across the Tyne at Bywell, the Derwent near Alansford, and the AA7ear below AArolsingham, to Cockfield. Beyond this line appears a coarse sandstone called the Millstone Grit, upon which the coal measures repose. theory which has yet been adduced is, that the countries in northern latitudes, being less broken by the sea, and extending over a wider space, concentrated the heat of the atmosphere in a greater degree than at pre sent ; and the climates of Edinburgh and Moscow, both nearly in the same parallel of latitude, have been adduced in illustration. The former place, it is said, is not subject to great variations of temperature ; w hil.-t at the latter, though the winters are severe, the heat of summer is equal to that at Naples. The argument, however, is scarcely conclusive, as the extreme cold of winter under the supposed circumstances must, in a great degree, have counteracted the luxuriant vegetation of summer; and it is only in the continued heat of the torrid zone that the plants in question arrive at perfection. * On October 10, 1829, a petrified or fossil tree was found in a stone quarry at AVideopen, near Gosforth, about five miles from Newcastle, at a depth of 42 feet from the surface, and 6 feet from the bed of the stone. It was 72 feet in length, and 4 feet 9 inches in girth at the lower extremity. Its horizontal exceeded its vertical diameter in the proportion of 17 to 10- Its position was nearly horizontal. The knots, &c. retained their original appearance ; it was partially hollow and crystallized ; and its longitudinal separations were precisely those of wood rent by powerful external pressure. The fossil stem of a tree was found at the depth of 48 fathoms above the coal in the workings of Killingworth colliery, near Newcastle, in September, 1830. Other fine specimens of similar fossil remains have been found in the quarries on the sea coast at Cresswell, in Northumberland, one of which is preserved in the conservatory at Cresswell House. Its dimensions are, height 5 feet, girth at the top 4 feet 10 inches, at the middle 5 feet 10i inches, near the bottom 5 feet 7 inches, and at the bottom 7 feet 6 inches. \u2014 Sykes's Local Records. \\ By coal measures, or metals, are meant such strata as are commonly found accompanying coal, without reference to metallic fossils. X Continuing through Yorkshire, Derbyshire, and Nottinghamshire, it suddenly terminates near Nottingham."], [76, "lxviii GEOGRAPHICAL AND The average dip or inclination of the seams of coal is 1 inch in 20; but this is not uniform. In some places they are interrupted or cut off by the intervention of a valley, formed by what geolo gists have called denudation, or the action of vast floods carrying off' the surface to a great depth.* Owing to the rapid contraction and enlargement of the different strata and coal-beds, no regular order of their succession can be depended on. Dr. Thomson says that the beds which compose the coal formation are 82 in number, and that the coal seams may amount to 25; but many of these are inconsiderable in point of thickness. The thickest and most valuable seam of coal on the Tyne is called the High Main, and lies buried at Jarrow under 140 fathoms of beds of stone. It rises to the north-east, and bassets out in the cliffs between CuUercoats and Tynemouth ; and on the north-west it reaches Benwell hills. At Pontop it is met with at 38-A fathoms from the surface ; at 52 fathoms on Gateshead Fell; and above the Ouseburn bridge, near Newcastle, at 14 fathoms. The Low Main coal, which on the north side of the Tyne is fragile and dangerous to work, is much improved in quality at Felling, Tyne Main, and Gateshead Fell ; and, under the name of the Huston Main, it forms one of the most valuable seams on the Wear. The coal measures exhibit many proofs of having been exposed to great disturbances after they had been consolidated. A variety of perpendicular and diagonal fractures intersect them in all directions, varying from two feet to several fathoms in breadth. The miners particularize these fissures into Dikes, Backs, Hitches, and Troubles. In many instances, one part of the strata has been broken off, and heaved up or depressed below its original position. In Jarrow colliery there are five different dikes, all producing changes in the levels of the strata on each side of them. The coal measures are also disturbed by the passage of vast veins of trap, basalt, or whinstone, which appear to have been ejected from the interior of the earth like lava, and have converted the coal in contact with them into a substance resembling coke.-j- Mr. AVilliams enumerates six different species of coal, viz. Newcastle or Caking Coal, Rock Coal, Splent Coal, Cannel Coal, Culm, and Jet. The Newcastle, or Caking Coal, which, from its fat bituminous nature, burns to a cinder and emits a thick smoke, is composed of charcoal and bitu men, mixed with a small quantity of argil, and is commonly debased with pyrites and other foul admixtures. It abounds both in Durham and Northumberland. Rock Coal commonly burns to a cinder, and produces a few ashes, but does not melt and run together in the fire like the cakino coal. Splent Coal burns freely, is stratified with great regularity, and breaks with difficulty across the bed of the strata, but at the natural transverse cutters it easily splints into thin broad flao-s, like boards, which kindle almost as readily, and burn as freely as the bituminous pines. It is found at Cockfield and at some of the Lambton collieries. Cannel Coal is so called on account of its burning with a clear bright flame, like a candle. It takes a good polish, and when turned on * A remarkable instance of this is found in the valley through which the river Team runs to the Tyne. This valley extends from north to south, and is between one and two miles broad. The Hi\"b Main coal appears in the sides of the hills on the east and west, and appears to have been originally continuous ; but the whole strata have been excavated and carried bodily away, not only to the level of the bed of the Team but to the amount of sometimes more than 180 feet beneath it. Another denudation has taken place in the' valley of the Derwent ; and one of much greater extent is that of the whole breadth of the valley of the lyne, above Newcastle. t The largest basaltic dike, or vein, that traverses the coal field, enters the sea from the cliffs at CuUer coats. lhe beds on itsnorth side are thrown down 90 fathoms, from which circumstance it is called the Ninety tat horn Dike. From the sea it ranges through Killingworth, passes near Gosforth church and Den ton Half, crosses the Tyne in the direction of Ryton church, and thence proceeds through the lead mine dis trict, where it produces lateral and valuable metalliferous veins."], [77, "STATISTICAL DESCRIPTION LXIX tlie lathe into snuff-boxes and other trinkets, is similar to real jet. Culm, or Blind Coal, has the singular property of emitting neither flame nor smoke, but burns with a clear, strong, glowing heat, like charcoal; and when a fire of it is extinguished or suffered to go out of itself, the coal that remains unconsumed bears no marks of fire. Jet has a near resemblance of the finer varieties of Cannel coal, except that it has the apparent grain of wood, is not readily broken cross-ways, but cleaves easily length-ways, like the splent coals. In the Newcastle coal formation, beds of sandstone are very numerous, and are known by the name of jjost. The stone is usually fine-grained, but soft, and not very durable. The white flag stone plate at Heworth, and on Gateshead Fell, is about four yards thick. The grindstone sill crops out at Byker Hill, Whickham Banks, and Gateshead Fell, where it is about eleven feet thick. It is quarried for the well-known Newcastle grindstones, and for filtering stones. Sometimes the upper part of this bed is abundantly impregnated with yellow ochre, which is sold under the name of dye sand. Good fire-stone is quarried at Burradon, near Killingworth, and used for the con struction of glass-house and other furnaces. Potter's clay is found below the vegetable soil, and is used in the manufacture of coarse earthenware, bricks, and tiles. Shale, or slate clay, is common, and possesses various shades of colour and degrees of induration, which are distinguished by the appellations of black metal, blue metal, and hard blue metal. Clay-stone is called by miners black stone, or blue stone; but it is not common in this district. It was\u00bbsupposed, till of late years, that the magnesian limestone cut off' the coal measures on the east : but there are some ancient works under the limestone at Ferryhill ; and coal has been worked under it at Hetton, and more recently at Monkwearmouth.

John Buddie, Esq., in his evidence before the Coal Trade Committee, states the number of work ing collieries on the river Tyne, on December 31, 1828, at \" 41 ; 23 on the north side, and 18 on the south side; on the AVear, 6 on the north side, and 12 on the south side, making 18; the whole number on both rivers being 59.\" The depths of these pits vary from 180 to 890 feet. In Fe bruary 1833, there were 13 pits on the line of the railway from AAritton Park to the Tees; but, from their comparatively small depth, and consequent cheapness of sinking, the number of these is increasing. The winning of collieries varies exceedingly as to the amount of capital required, the difference being so great as from ,\u00a310,000 to \u00a3?150,000; and the general system, on account of the risk, is for the proprietor to grant a lease to a party of adventurers. Boring is the principal method used for the discovery of coal, which is effected by the use of a chisel, to which is attached by screws a vol. i. s"], [78, "LXX GEOGRAPHICAL AND succession of iron rods, proportioned to the depth required, and by which the hardest rocks are penetrated.* In sinking a pit, the greatest difficulties arise from quicksands and large feeders of water, which must be dammed back by cylinders of wood or cast iron within the shaft. It is fre quently necessary, for the purposes of ventilation, or to draw off the water, to sink more than one shaft. On arriving at a sufficiently thick seam of coal, the process of excavating it begins, by cut tino- out the coal laterally in what are called boards. In the annexed diagram, the letters A and B represent the shafts, or perpendicular entrances into the mine, and which are generally about 85 feet in diameter. A is the working shaft, by which the workmen descend and the coals are brought up: it is also calied the down cast shaft, because the air descends down it. Having descended, it passes through all the excavations that have been made through the mine in the direction of the dotted lines, and ascends through the up-cast shaft at B. To accelerate the motion of the air, a furnace is kept burning upon it, from which it is sometimes called the Air-furnace shaft. AA'hen the mine is wrought by one shaft, it is divided from top to bottom by a boarded par- tition, nicely joined, so as to prevent the communication of air from one side of the pit to the other. The air descends through one division and ascends by the other. The dark coloured parts ofthe above plan represent the unwrought part of the coal. The mine may be divided into any number of districts. In many cases, when the colliery has been wrought in this way, a part of the pillars of coal are gradually cut away, and props of timber substituted for the support of the roof. Some times the whole of the pillars may be taken away without the roof falling in so as to impede the workmen in other parts of the mine. AVhen the whole of the coal has been excavated, and the roof does not fall down, vast empty spaces or wastes are left, which generally become silled with: water, to the great danger of the adjoining collieries. The dangers to life and property in the working of coal-mines are great and numerous. Floods of water,-f falling stones, and the closing up of the mines by what are called thrusts and creeps, are of frequent occurrence. But the most terrible and destructive enemy with which the miner has to contend is Fire-damp, or hydrogen gas. AArhen this terrible element has been suffered to accu mulate, and is incautiously ignited by any person that visits the inflammable repository, effects of a volcanic nature are produced. \" The subterraneous lightning scorches and mangles the workmen exposed to its fury ; sweeps down its long galleries, in one common torrent of destruction, limbs of men and horses, doors, brattices, workmen's tools, ancl coal-dust, all which it ejects through the * In 1805, Mr. Ryan obtained a patent for an improved method of boring for coal, by means of a cylin drical cutter, by which a solid piece of each stratum is cut, and by other tools brought vertically to the surface. t The quantity of water which flows into the mines is sometimes enormous, and the expense of drawing it off by pumps worked by steam-engines is one of the heaviest charges of a colliery. Mr. Buddie states, that in one with which he is connected, they draw eighteen times the weight of water which they do of coal. The engine at the Tyne Main colliery is 200 horse power, works three sets of pumps, and lifts from the depth of 47 fathoms upwards of 2000 gallons of water per minute. It was calculated in 1815, that (takino the average of 33 engines) for every bushel of coals consumed, 21,500,000 lbs. of water was raised one foot high. The first steam-engine erected in these counties was at Oxclose, near AVashington; the second at; Norwood, near Ravensworth; and the third (in 1713 or 14) at Byker colliery; since which many hundreds. of these usefid machines have been constructed between the Tees and Tweed."], [79, "STATISTICAL DESCRIPTION. LXXI shafts, accompanied with thick volumes of smoke and fire. The noise of the explosion resembles that of a distant park of artillery, and the echo it produces is like the reverberations of thunder in the higher regions of the air. Workmen, who have escaped the fury of these blasts, describe them as instantaneously preceded with a strong sudden wind, and as if afflicting the head with pains as if it were pierced with arrows, and, even in cases where the person sustains little injury from the fire, as causing in the hands, face, and other bare parts of the body, a hot, scorching pain. They who have presence of mind to throw themselves flat on their faces, are seldom injured, especially where there is water; but if they be left in a vacuum, or where choak-damp prevails, they soon suffocate.\"* Choak-damp, or carbonic acid gas, is a kindred evil with fire-damp. It is heavier than atmospheric air, and, like water, forbids animal respiration, and extinguishes lights. Its gra- vity makes it difficult to be exhausted by ventilation ; but it may be easily discovered, and is less inflammable than hydrogen gas. Where it does not exclusively prevail, its suffocating quality is avoided by keeping the head above its level. Some imagine that choak-damp is generated in coal mines by the petrifaction of vegetable substances. In places where fire-damp was apprehended, and of course candles could not be used, the pitmen formerly worked by the light of what were called steel-mills. This machine consists of a small wheel of steel, of six or seven inches diameter, moved by a little toothed wheel with great velocity ; and by holding a piece of flint to the steel, a stream of sparks is given out. Although in the day this light appears very feeble, in the darkness of the mines it is strong enough to enable a person to write by it. In choak-damp, the sparks fall into the noxious fluid like drops of blood. The use of the mill, however, is not free from the danger of explosion in some cases ; and 600 men and boys having been destroyed in the pits on the Tyne and AVear, by the explosions of inflammable * Mr. Buddie, in the evidence above quoted, describes the production of fire-damp as follows : \u2014 \" The in- flammable air is evolved from the coal at the natural temperature of the earth ; hence it is that coals lying deep abound more in it than coals lying near the surface, because there are openings at the surface by which it escapes; but in the deep mines it cannot have such outlet, and therefore it accumulates in all the fissures of the stone above the coal, and it is constantly going on in this sort of natural distillation, if I may so call it ; and consequently, if the mine is ever so well ventilated and cleaned one day, like a well filling with wa- ter, it becomes charged with inflammable air the following day, and in a very short time indeed, unless that ventilation is regularly continued. This is what I would call the regular generation ofthe gas; but its ac- cumulations are the most dangerous to us- The fissures of the roof in some places are very extensive, and the communications are very distant and remote ; they may be considered as natural gasometers, out of which the gas, not having any outlet, is compressed by the process of distillation going on from the coal to an ex- tent that is almost incredible to those who have not seen it : in fact, its resistance is according to the quan- tity of rock above it, and the thickness ofthe surrounding stratification, whatever it may be, whether stone or coal. In the course of pursuing the workings of collieries into the whole coal, they frequently cut across those fissures, which are in the roof above, and full of inflammable air in the compressed state I have de- scribed ; they frequently, even before we come near them by a considerable distance, break away the coal or the stone, when it becomes too weak to resist the elastic force of the compressed gas ; and I have known within my own practice, in a very short time, in a few minutes, from a state of perfect safety a pit become completely charged to the point of explosion, from the quantity of gas rushing out of those fissures, which we technically call blowers, precisely the same as if we had made a communication with an old working; this discharges the gas into the working, and overpowers the ventilation. If the proportion is as 1 to 14, not ex- ceeding that, it does not become explosive; but, according to Sir Humphrey Davy's experiments, if there is more than 1 volume of inflammable air to 14 of atmospherical air, it then is an explosive mixture, and of course it explodes at the first naked light it falls in with. The magnitude of these discharges, or, in other words, the quantity of gas poured out in such cases, cannot be calculated ; but I can state that in a colliery of which I am viewer, the quantity of atmospherical air it requires to keep it in a safe working state, under just the regular discharge of inflammable air from the roof and coal, without falling in with any of its accu\u00ab mulations, requires 18,000 cubical feet of atmospherical air in a minute to keep it in a safe working state.\""], [80, "lxxii GEOGRAPHICAL AND air, in the years 1812 and 1813, a \" Society for preventing Accidents in Coalmines\" was formed in Sunderland, and premiums were offered for the discovery of new methods of lighting and ventilat ing them. Dr. AVilliam Reid Clanny, of Bishopwearmouth, presented to the society a lamp constructed on the principle of insulating the light so as to secure safety in an atmosphere of fire damp; and Dr. Gray, of the same place, (now bishop of Bristol) having solicited the attention of Sir Humphrey Davy to this important subject, that eminent chemist visited our coal-mines in Au gust, 1815, and on his return to London produced two lamps, in which the burners were insulated from the external air. He afterwards found the security of wire-gauze, which proves impervious to flame, and, though surrounded by inflammable air, prevents the communication of any inflam mation with the burners. Mr. Stephenson, an engineer in the Killingworth Main colliery, was at the same time employed in a series of experiments on carbureted hydrogen gas, which he discovered would not explode through small apertures. Having found (previously to the discovery of the wire-gauze safety lamp by Sir H. Davy) that a lamp constructed on this principle could be carried in safety where a strong blower of inflammable air was issuing, he claimed the honour of the in vention. Much angry, and some ingenious controversy ensued. The gentlemen of the coal-trade, at their meetings, refused to examine the claims of Mr. Stephenson, and having voted him 100 guineas, presented Sir Humphrey Davy with a service of plate valued at 1800 guineas. These circumstances induced many to draw a conclusion unfavourable to Sir H. Davy's pretensions; and those gentlemen who conceived that Mr. Stephenson had not been fairly treated, presented him with a valuable silver tankard, bearing an appropriate inscription, and a handsome sum of money. The wire-gauze safety lamp, though of great practical utility, does not give colliers that absolute and perfect security against the destructive power of inflammable air that was injudiciously attributed to it. It is certainly liable to accident, and of course insecure. Mr. Buddie admits that in an ave rage of 34 years, during nearly half of which the \" Davy lamp\" has been in use, the loss of life has been nearly the same. \" But,\" he adds, \" I attribute that to this cause, \u2014 that we are working mines, from having the advantage of the safety lamp, which we could not possibly have worked without it, and of course they are in a more dangerous situation, and the risk is increased in a very o-reat degree. If we had not had the Davy lamp, those mines could not now have been in existence at all.\" Perhaps no contrivance of this kind will ever prevent altogether the recurrence of the awful calamities above described, which can only be effected by a more perfect system of ventilation than that at present in use.* Mr. Justice Bayley, in his address to the grand jury at the Durham spring assizes, in 1824, said, in allusion to the explosion of a coal-mine, \" If those persons who had the care of such concerns did not use proper caution (whether that want of caution arose from the use * In 1816, Mr. James Ryan, of Netherton coUiery, near Dudley, obtained from the Society of Arts a cold medal and 100 guineas, for his \" Method of ventilating Coal-mines.\" From seven-eighths to nine-tenths and in some cases the whole of the coal is now raised from each mine ; whilst, on the old system, not more than one-half, and frequently less, was all that could be obtained. The old system of working and ventilat ing collieries consists in forming all the boards and headways, or, in other words, passages of a&mine into one immense labyrinth, connected at one end with the downcast shaft, and at the other end^with the upcast shaft so that the current of air has to travel about 27 miles before it can pass through all the avenues in a mine where the workings only extend over an area 600 yards square ; whilst, on Mr. Ryan's system, the draucht instead of sweeping through the whole mine, operates directly on the headway or passage, which is excavated round the exterior of the mine, for the purpose of drawing off the gas from the interior workings, and expel hngit at the upcast shaft without suffering it to spread through the works. Mr. Ryan visited Newcastle in 181o, but though supported by many scientific gentlemen, he could not obtain leave to trv his plan in anv of the coal-mines in Northumberland or Durham ; and, owing to some strange prejudice, the colliery viewers of these counties have not yet adopted the ventilating part of his system, though the seams are now wrought nearly in accordance with it \u2014 Parsons and White's Directory, vol. ii. p. 122. fc"], [81, "STATISTICAL DESCRIPTION Ixxiii of improper lamps, or from whatever other cause), in the event of death ensuing, they would be liable to the charge of manslaughter. Lead, Iron, SsC. The lead district is a bleak and rugged region of mountains, extending from Northumberland and Durham into Cumberland and Westmoreland, and thence to the extremity of Derbyshire, being about 160 miles in extent; but in a great part of this space the veins lie so low that they are not worth working, except in the five counties just mentioned, and in the north-western extre mity of Yorkshire. The uppermost strata of the lead measures are supposed to basset from below the lowest coal seams,* and first become of importance at Healeyfield and Blanchland on the Der went. They lie in an inclined position which varies considerably, but, on the line of the greatest acclivity, forms an angle of about 2 deg. 15 min. The average bearing of this rise is 30 deg. west of south from the true meridian. The veins in the county of Durham generally run nearly east and west, and are sometimes intersected by cross veins. In Forster's Section of the Strata, 36 mines are enumerated in AVeardale, belonging to the bishop of Durham, and then principally occu pied by Colonel and Mrs. Beaumont. In Teesdale, according to the same authority, there were 38 mines, the property of the Marquis of Cleveland, and generally occupied by the London Lead Company. Forster estimates the average produce of the AAreardale mines at 17,000 bings per an num (a bing of lead ore is 8 cwt.), and that of the Teesdale mines at 8000 bings. But this pro duce is extremely uncertain and variable; and the number of the mines is also continually varying. The veins in which lead ore is found appear to resemble in some measure the dikes or hitches of the coal field, being generally fissures in the strata. AVhen it is ascertained that ores exist in any particular place, and can be worked to advantage, a shaft is sunk in the ground ; or, if the situa- tion will admit, a level, or adit, is driven. A drift is worked towards the vein ; and, after exca- vating 15 or 20 fathoms, the space is filled up with rubbish, leaving only a rise, from which another drift is made, and so on to the top of the stratum, and above it if the vein continues pro- ductive. When the strata or veins are too hard for pick-work, recourse is had to blasting with gunpowder. Choak-damp was formerly very common in lead-mines ; but fire-damp has not been met with, except on two occasions in the Nent Force, Cumberland. Ventilation, however, is now so much attended to, that foul air is very seldom found in the mines. This is principally effected by forcing a stream of water through the workings. -f- Large caverns are frequently met with in the lead-mines, the insides of which exhibit all the variety, beauty, and splendour of the most cu rious grotto work, being formed by the variegated spar, shot into a diversity of figured crystals. * Mr. AV. Forster, in his Section of the Strata extending from Newcastle to Cross Fell, gives the local name and nature of each distinct stratum, of which he enumerates 116 in the coal measures, and which reach to tlie depth of 504 yards, when the lead measures commence. These he traces through 240 different strata, and to the depth of 1345 yards below the surface. In the lead formation, according to Dr. Thompson, there are 7 beds or sills of coal, 19 of limestone, 60 of plate or slate clay, and 50 of sandstone ; but Mr. AVinch, in his section, makes 21 limestone beds, of which the aggregate thickness is 96 fathoms. Some ofthe beds agree with those ofthe coal field, viz. coal, shale, and sandstone ; but other rocky masses also attend the lead measures. The sandstone and shale beds first rise from beneath the coal formation. The slate sill is of a grey colour, and is used as a roofing slate: the mil/stone grit is one of the uppermost strata on the Derwent, and is quarried for millstones ; the grindstone sill, a fine grained yellowish sandstone, is the uppermost bed at Coalcleugh and Allenheads; hazle, tuft, and a variety of other sandstones prevail, particularly in the lower part of the lead measures. T At Scears mine, in Teesdale, Mr. Stagg applied a hydraulic engine which ventilated a level a mile long, together with a rise of 65 fathoms, without any shafts being sunk from the surface. VOL. I. t"], [82, "lxxiv GEOGRAPHICAL AND The washing of lead ore, &c. has been greatly facilitated during the last 30 years by the intro duction of crushing machines, stamping mills, slime pits, dollying, &c. The ore of Weardale is smelted by the blast-hearth ; but in Teesdale air-furnaces have been introduced with much success. Forster enumerates 10 smelt-mills in the county of Durham. The specific gravity oi galena, from which is produced the well-known lead of commerce, is from 7 to 7'6; and the proportion of lead in it varies from 40 to 85 per. cent. It is scarcely ever found entirely unmixed with silver; and when more than 6 or 7 ounces of that metal can be produced from a fother of lead (21 cwt.), it is refinable for the market. The working of lead-mines, however, though conducted in this county with great spirit, is very uncertain as to profit. The following statement shews the price of lead per fother in the years specified: \u2014 In 1776) pig lead sold at ,\u00a312 per fother; 1782, at i?17. 5s.; 1788, at \u00a323, 10s. ; 1789, at \u00a316, 10s. ; 1805, at \u00a3J40; 1809, at =\u00a340; 1810, at \u00a331, 10s. ; 1813, at \u00a325; 1814, at \u00a3T8, 10s.; 1815, at .\u00a322; 1816, at \u00a318, 10s.; 1817, at \u00a3T7, 10s.; 1818, at \u00a3T9, 15s. ; 1819, at \u00a3'23; 1820, at \u00a3J24, 10s. ; 1821, at ,\u00a322, 10s. ; 1825, at =\u00a325 ; 1826, at \u00a3T9; 1827, at ,\u00a318; and in 1828, at \u00a3IJ. Since that time the price has declined; and, for the last three or four years, lead has not averaged more than \u00a3?12, 10s. per fother. Iron ore is found both in the coal and lead districts. Immense quantities of iron pyrites lie im bedded in the strata of indurated clay, through all the coal field. The iron works at Lemington are chiefly supplied with this metal from the neighbouring collieries. Ironstone is still more abun dant in the shale ofthe lead-mines; but owing to the high price of fuel, and the great distance from any water carriage, it cannot be manufactured to advantage. An excellent bed of ironstone has recently been discovered at Ouston, near Chester-le-Street. Some excellent quarries of slate for buildings have been opened in different parts of the county. A beautiful black-spotted marble is dug up near Wolsingham, and made into hearths, chimney-pieces, and other ornaments. This neighbourhood abounds also with fine millstones. A black marble, veined with opaque spar, is found in the Tees, near Barnard Castle. The discovery of the very singular salt spring at Birt ley has nearly annihilated the manufacture of salt at South Shields. It has for many years pro duced 20,000 gallons per day, four times more strongly impregnated with salt than any sea-water ; but it does not contain so much of the sulphate of magnesia, or Epsom salt, as the spring at But terby. For descriptions ofthe other mineral springs in the county, see Hartlepool, Dinsdale, &c. Botany. Mr. Winch, in May, 1819, read, at a meeting of the Literary and Philosophical Society in New castle, an ingenious and interesting essay on the geographical distribution of plants through the counties of Durham, Cumberland, and Northumberland. This tract of country possesses a Flora of Ph\u0153nogamous, and 1160 Chryptogamic (or ferns, mosses, flags, and mushrooms) plants. Among their Ph\u0153nogamous plants are comprised 27 species of trees, besides 20 willows, 11 roses, 174 grasses and grass-like plants, 20 Orchide\u00e6, 16 liliaceous plants, 14 rough-leaved plants (Aspe rifoU\u0153), 47 umbelliferous, 41 plants bearing cross-shaped flowers (Cruciform\u0153), 36 lipped flowers (Labiat\u0153J, 16 masked flowers (Personat\u0153), 94 bearing compound flowers (Composit\u0153), 56 spe cies whose habitats are on the sea coast, 84 alpine plants (of which 14 are natives of the Cumber land mountains, 65 fresh water aquatics, 104 marine aquatics, 85 British species brought amongst ballast, and 32 exotics introduced by the same means. The whole number of vegetables in Great Britain and Ireland amounts only to about 3000, of which two-thirds are to be found in these counties. Sir C.

LXXV The vine seldom flowers in this county ; and if by chance small grapes are produced, they soon drop to the ground; though several of the exotic shrubs from Asia, Portugal, Japan, and even from South America, resist the severity of winter in this northern region much better than many which are indigenous in Italy, the south of France, and Germany. Zoology. The cattle of Durham are at present in great repute ; as for form, weight, produce of milk, and quickness of fattening, there are none better. The sheep also, particularly the Teeswater breed, stand high in estimation. (See Darlington.) The Weardale sheep are small, but the meat is finely flavoured. When fat, the quarters seldom weigh more than 14 or 18 pounds each. Ararious sorts of useful horses are now bred here, amongst which is an excellent breed of hunters, generally of a bay colour, and very active, strong, and hardy. Many superior race-horses are also bred and trained in this county ; and Charles Attwood, Esq., of AVhickham, has devoted several years to an extensive series of experiments for the improvement of this breed. Coach and saddle horses are sold at the various fairs in the district. Dogs of all varieties are to be met with ; and those for the chace,* amongst which may be named the Raby and Lambton fox-hounds, are considered of peculiar excellence. Wild animals are not numerous, and consist principally of the deer in the parks of the gentry, foxes, hares, rabbits, weasels, &c. The birds which inhabit or visit this county are of almost every variety found in England. The singing birds are numerous, consisting of the various species of linnet, thrush, lark, &c. ; but the nightingale does not often come so far north. Rookeries may be seen in various places ; and the magpie and jackdaw are often met with. The starling, the swallow, and the woodcock, visit this district in their appropriate seasons. The most common birds of prey are the sparrowhawk and the owl. Of aquatic birds, the wild swan, the bernacle, the cormorant, the curlew, the grebe, the teal, the puffin, the little auk, the kingfisher, and various species of gulls and divers, may be mentioned. Amongst the fish caught on the coast are the cod fish, the ling, the haddock, the whiting, the 6ole, the holibut, the flounder, the plaice, the dab, the turbot, the mackerel, the herring, the pil chard, the skate, the thornback, the salmon, the conger eel, &c. The rapacious dog-fish sometimes makes great depredations in the fishermen's nets. The porpoise and grampus are frequent, and the seal sometimes makes its appearance. Ararious kinds of shell-fish are common on the coast. The rivers abound with trout of excellent quality. The skelly, dare, or dace, is plentiful in the Tyne; and the smelt is often caught in that and other rivers. Numerous different species of insects and reptiles are found in this county ; but few of these are loathsome or dangerous. Agriculture, Roads, Bridges, &c. Improvements in agriculture have been pursued with considerable spirit and success in the en virons of Darlington, chiefly through the patronage of a society of respectable gentlemen, who hold their meetings in that town, and bestow premiums upon merit. The usual rotation of crops * The late Robert Surtees, Esq., the elegant historian of the county, had two greyhounds; a black one named Nigel, and a white one- The former, when coursing, being the fleetest, was -usually caught by the tail by the latter, for the purpose of keeping up with it, until at length the end of Nigel's tail was bitten off.

On some spots of gravelly soil, turnips and barley are grown in almost perpetual succession, a crop of clover being sometimes interposed. The produce of wheat on good land is from 20 to 30 bushels per acre, the pro duce of barley is from 30 to 40, of oats from 20 to 40. The manures are chiefly lime and the produce of the fold-yard ; and though abundance of sea-weed might be collected on the coast, the farmers make but little use of it. The farms are of a middling size, few of them exceeding 200 acres. The largest portion of each farm is appropriated to tillage ; but towards the western part of the county, the whole is applied to pasture. The leases seldom exceed six years, and are too frequently rendered of little value by injudicious restrictions. The leases held of the see of Dur ham are generally for life, or for 21 years, renewable every seven years on payment of a fine. The farm-houses are well situated and commodious, and improvements in farming and farming machi nery become more and more common. The public roads in general are good; but those belonging to private districts and townships want improving. The great north road from London to Edinburgh enters this county at Croft bridge, and, passing through the city of Durham, proceeds to the Tyne bridge at Newcastle. A road from Stockton to Bishopwearmouth, by way of Easington, Castle Eden, &c, was formed some years ago, principally through the exertions of Rowland Burdon, Esq. Good roads diverge from the city of Durham to Bishopwearmouth, to Sedgefield and Stockton, to Bishop Auckland, Stain drop, and Barnard Castle, and to Brancepeth, Wolsingham, and Stanhope. Other lines connect the different towns of the county in various directions. No where, perhaps, has more advantage been taken of modern improvements in science and machinery, as applied to the facility of carriage, than in the county of Durham. The extensive railway between AVitton Park and the mouth of the Tees, the Clarence railway, the Hartlepool railway, and that between Stanhope and South Shields, are noticed in the respective parts of this work to which they belong. It is only necessary to add here, that it has recently been determined upon to form one between the city of Durham and Sunderland. The bridge across the Tyne at Newcastle was built, and is kept in repair, at the joint expense of the bishop of Durham and the corporation of Newcastle. The following is a list of the county bridges in the palatinate of Durham (those marked * are partly kept in repair by the county of Northumberland, and those -f- by the North Riding of Yorkshire) : \u2014 Aldin Grange Cockerton Framwellgate tMiddleton, Teesdale Stanhope \u2022Alansford Coundon Frosterley Neasham Stockley Auckland St. Helen Coxhoe Fulbeck New-houses tStockton Auckland AVest tCroft Gauiiless Newsham Stone-bridge Barnard Castle Crook Gerrard's Newton Cap Sunderland Blackiston Croxdale Grant Northgate Team Hio*h tBlackwell Dadryshield Hartburn Norton Team Low 'Blanchland Darlington *Hartford Oakley Cross Wallnook Blaydon Dentburn Harthope Ouseleap AVascrow Boldon AVest Derwent Haughton Oxen-le-Field AVearshead Bradbury Eastgate Hertford tPiercebridge Westgate Brafferton Eggleston Holdsworth Pontburn Whickham Brancepeth Elton Humberbeck Rushyford Whitton Browney Elvet Hylton Shakers AVillow Green Burdon Great Evenwood Jarrow Sheepwash tWinston Burdon Little Fenhall Ketton Shincliffe Witton-le-Wear Butterwick Fieldon Lamesley *Shotley Wolsingham Carlebury Fishburn Lanchester South Church Woodham Chester Four-Miles Langley Staindrop +Yarm"], [85, "STATISTICAL DESCRIPTION. lxx vii Population, Poor-rates, County-rates, &c. Much obscurity, and probably much misapprehension, prevails relative to the early population of this, as well as the other counties of England. In 1296, the tioops of the palatinate, employed in the wars of Scotland, amounted to 1000 foot and 500 horse, from whence it may be inferred that the whole number of inhabitants was considerable. In 1377? population of the city of Durham was considered so trivial that it was not specified. The numerous parochial divisions and spacious churches, however, particularly in the southern parts of the county and in the city, prove that in early times this district was thickly peopled. By accounts of doubtful authority, the inha bitants of this county amounted, in the year 1700, to 95,500. The Magna Britannia, published in 1730, states them at 96,980. In 1750, they are said to have amounted to 135,000. The following is the result of the four decennial returns made by authority of parliament, in which the old divi- sion of the AVards is preserved throughout : \u2014 In 1801. In 1811. In 1821.

In 1821, there were in the county 32,793 houses, inhabited by 45,940 families; 257 houses were building, and 966 were uninhabited. 9427 families were chiefly employed in agriculture; 20,212 in trade, manufactures, and handicraft ; and 16,301 included all other classes. The number of males was 99,100, and of females 108,573. In 1831, there were 40,750 inhabited houses, 345 building, and 1570 uninha bited. 8408 families were employed chiefly in agriculture; 18,511 in trade, manufactures, and handicraft ; and 27,817 not included under those heads ; making a total of 54,736 families.

The following sums were expended during each year, ending March 25, from 1814 to 1829: \u2014 * Under the feudal system, the proprietors of land provided for the poor; and when Christianity was in- troduced, one-fourth of the tithes was appropriated for the support of the indigent. An act, 11 Henry ATI. c. 2 (1496) directs every impotent beggar to repair to and remain at the hundred where he last dwelt, is best known, or was born, upon pain of being set in the stocks three days and three nights with only bread and water, and then be put out of the town. By the 22d Henry VIII. c. 12, justices of peace were empowered to grant licences to poor, aged, and impotent persons, to beg within a certain precinct, which if they ex- ceeded they were to be punished as above. After the suppression of monasteries by Henry VIIL, the exten- sion of enclosures and the new practice of letting lands at rack rents, during the reign of his successor, drove from their homes numerous families, whose fathers had occupied the same farms for several generations; and the increasing multitudes of the poor began to resort to the more populous towns, in search of that relief Vvhich had been formerly distributed at the gates of the monasteries. Thus Lever exclaims, \" O merciful Lord ! what a number of poor, feeble, halt, blind, lame, sickly, yea, with idle vagabonds and dissembling caitiffs mixed among them, lie and creep, begging in the miry streets of London and Westminster.\" Mean- while, mendicants wandered in crowds through the country, and by their numbers and importunities often extorted alms from the intimidated passenger. To abate this nuisance, a statute was enacted in 1547, which will call to the mind of the reader the barbarous manners of our pagan forefathers. AVhosoever \" lived idly and loiteringly for the space of three days\" came under the description of a vagabond, and was liable to the following punishment. Two justices of the peace might order the letter V to be burnt on his breast, and adjudge him to serve the informer two years as his slave. His master was bound to provide him with bread, water, and refuse meat ; might fix an iron ring round his neck, arm, or leg ; and was authorized to compel him to \" labour at any work, however vile it might be, by beating, chaining, or otherwise.\" If the slave ab- sented himself a fortnight, the letter S was burnt on his cheek or forehead, and he became a slave for life ; and if he offended a second time in the like manner, his flight subjected him to the penalties of felony. Two years later, this severe statute was repealed. In 1552, for the first time, a legal provision was made for the poor. For that purpose the churchwardens received authority to collect charitable contributions, and the bishop of the diocese was empowered to proceed against the defaulters. But the Mth Eliz. c. 5, (1572) which directed assessments to be levied in every parish, has generally been considered as the foundation of our existing poor-laws. Blackstone says, these laws are founded on the very principles of civil society ; and, when the lands became property, they carried with them the charge of providing for the destitute.\u2014 Strype, Hume, Lingard, \u00a7c. vol. 1. y \u00a3. 1814. ..84.826 1815. ..78,726 1816... 83,650 181 7... 90,670 s. 0 0 8 1 \u00a3. s. 1818. ..101.790 18 1819. ..101,066 5 1820. ..101.755 2 1321... 97,618 12 \u00a3\u25a0 s. 1S22.. 91,182 0 182?.. .80,073 1 182 1... 76,701 17 1825... 74,692 6 \u00a3. s. 1826. ..75,742 9 u 27. ..76,702 17 1828... 78,965 14 1829. ..80,769 13"], [94, "lxxxvi GEOGRAPHICAL AND In the year 1832, the poor-rates of the county amounted to \u00a3102,951, 9s., of whicb \u00a386,086, 16s.

He bequeathed to the trus tees a portion of his library, and the remainder was purchased out of the funds of the charity after his death.

The principal branches of expenditure are the augmentation of small benefices, contributions towards the building or enlarging churches and chapels, and towards the foundation and support of schools, exhibitions to young men going to either of the universities, the binding out apprentices, annuities and casual donations to distressed individuals, and subscriptions to different charitable institutions. One or more of the trustees now reside constantly at Bambrough, and receive an allowance of 10s. a day for the expenses of hos pitality, and \u00a34, 4s. for every journey between Bambrough and Durham. In Bambrough Castle two rooms are appropriated, the one for a boy's school, and the other for a school for girls. The master of the boy's school has apartments in the castle, and receives a salary of \u00a360 per annum for teaching the boys, and \u00a315 for attending the girl's school two hours every day, and teaching them writing and accounts ; he is allowed to take one of the boys, who has been at the school, as an assistant, who receives 6s. a week, except in the times of vacation. The mistress of the girl's school has also apartments in the castle, and receives a salary of \u00a330 per annum. To these schools all the children of poor persons in the parish of Bambrough are admitted, and taught on the National System without any charge, and are supplied with books and stationery. Thirty girls, who are selected by the trustees, are provided with board, lodging, and washing, and are completely clothed. They are taken between the ages of 7 and 9, and are allowed to remain till they are 16, or fit to go out to service, when they are supplied with clothes, and each of them receives the sum of \u00a32, 12s. ; and if at the end of one year they are found to have continued in service, and to have borne a good character, they receive one guinea each, and a present of books. Two schools are likewise supported in Blanchland ; a boy's school kept by a master, who receives a salary of \u00a350 per annum, and has the use of a house belonging to the charity-estate, rent-free ; and a school for girls, kept by a schoolmistress, who receives a salary of \u00a320, and has the use of a house and garden, for which the yearly rent of \u00a32, 10s. is nominally reserved, and entered in the rental, but which is returned to her. In these schools all the poor children of Blanchland are admitted and instructed without any charge. The scho lars are also supplied with books and stationery, and coals are provided for the master and mistress. In 1797> a shop was established at Bambrough for the sale of meal and flour, for which purpose a quantity of barley, oats, and peas, are purchased of the tenants of the charity-estates at the market-price, each tenant being obliged to furnish a proportional quantity. The grain is ground at a wind-mill, erected close to the castle-walls, and the meal is sold to such of the poor as are recommended by any respectable neighbour, at little more than the prime cost ofthe grain before it was ground. Proper regulations are made for prevent ing persons from purchasing for sale, by limiting them to the quantity required for their respective families. The trustees have also established a shop for cheese, grocery, and articles of that nature, from which the poor are supplied in the same manner as at the meal-shop, and subject to the like regulations. There is also a dispensary and surgery in the castle ; and a salary of \u00a385. 10s. per annum is paid to a surgeon for attending twice a week and giving advice and surgical assistance, and dispensing medicine to such poor persons as apply under a recommendation from any respectable inhabitant of the neighbourhood. A midwife is engaged, with a salary of \u00a320 a year, to attend poor lying-in women ; and there is a supply of childbed-linen at the castle, which is lent out to sucli persons as are considered fit object.*, of the charity, each of whom receives at the same time the sum of 2s. 6d. Theie is also distributed, to the poor of Bambrough, milk from the trus tees' farm nearly throughout the year, and every Christmas beef to the amount of about \u00a320. Coal is deli vered annually to 17 poor families of Bambrough, the like number of North Sunderland, and the like number of Blanchland; and meat to the amount of \u00a310 is likewise distributed yearly at Christmas to the poor of Blanchland, and there is a supply of childbed-linen for their use. There is also applied, in weekly or quar- terly payments to the poor of Bambrough, Blanchland, and other places in which the estates are situate, about \u00a3160 per annum. The manor of Bambrough, and a considerable part of the trust-estate, is situated on the coast of a bay formed by Holy Island and North Sunderland point, which are distant from each other about 8 miles. This hay is fully exposed to the north-east wind, which is frequently very tempestuous ; and the danger to the navigation is much increased by the numerous islands which extend several miles, the nearest being about 2 miles from the shore. The accidents which often occurred on this inclement coast attracted the attention of the trustees, and principally induced them to make Bambrough Castle a place of occasional residence. They have ready in the castle such implements as are required to give assistance to stranded vessels, rooms to re-"], [97, "STATISTICAL DESCRIPTION. Ixxxix ceive any property which may be saved, and clothing for the shipwrecked sailors, who are also supplied with the means of returning to their homes. They have also procured a life-boat for the fishermen of Holy Island, and give them rewards for thp use of it in cases of distress. During the continuance of fogsv which are fre- quent and sudden, a gun is fired at short intervals; and a patrol is stationed on the shore on tempestuous nights, to give alarm in case of ships requiring assistance, and to act as a guide to any persons cast on shore. The trustees covenant also with the tenants ofthe estate, that they shall furnish carts, horses, and men, in proportion to their respective farms, to protect and bring away whatever can be saved from the wrecks. The harbour at North Sunderland has been gradually improved at a considerable expense, by the lengthening of the pier, and the erection of a breakwater, as a shelter from the south-east. The trustees have been soli- cited, by a large portion ofthe masters of vessels navigating this coast, to proceed with these improvements. They have accordingly had a plan and estimate made for a still further enlargement of the harbour, the ex- pense of which will probably not fall short of \u00a35000.

The trustees meet at least four times a year for the purpose of transacting such business as may be required, and they examine and audit the accounts half-yearlv in January and July, copies thereof having been previously sent to each of them. They present to the liv ings of Bambrough, Blanchland, and Shotley, as they become vacant. Piggs Charity.\u2014 John Pigg,t by will, October 27, 1088, bequeathed to Robert Bewicke, William Hut chinson, Phineas Allen, Mathias Partis, Lancelot Cramhngton, John Rouchester, and Matthew Ladler, and \u2022 The following annual payments are made to schools in the county of Durham :\u2014 Monkwearmouth and Sunderland, .\u00a320 ; Thorn ton (Norhamshire), Z.20 ; Aycliffe, Easington, Washington, and Whitburn, \u00a310 each; Sherburn, \u00a38; Brafferton, \u00a36; Bishopton, Brancepeth, Cockerton, Cornsay, Darlington, Fishburn, Harewood, Holy Island, Hunstanworth, Hurworth, Lanchester, Muggles wick, Norton, Ryton, Seaton Carew, Sunderland Bridge, Trimdon, and Thorpe, \u00a35 each ; and Eastgate, Li. \u25a0f Town's surveyor for Newcastle. He \"was well known both to King Charles II. and the Duke of York; and, for his giddy sin gularities, noted not only through the country, but almost through the kingdom. He usually wore a high-crowned hat, a strait coat, and would never ride, but walked the pace of any horse hundreds of miles on foot, with a quarter-staff, fenced with an iron fork at one end. The king and Duke of York, to whom he was often trotting, made themselves sport with hihi, as looking upon him to be a brainsick enthusiast. He was of so peculiar and odd a humour, that he would not only go to prison when he needed not', but conceit edly chose the vilest part of the prison for his apartment, where he continued a long while, when he might have had his liberty when ever he pleased. This Pigg died in a stye, in circumstances not unlike those who lay hands on themselves, or die crazy or distracted. He took down a stately cross, which he called Idolatry, that stood at the north end of the Banas Bridge, before the chapel of St. James, and built a curious stone pillar, inscribed with texts of scripture, still standing at the Three-mile Bridge, by the side of the Morpeth road, as a monument of his whimsical head, and which very deservedly to this day bears the name of ' Pigg's Folly.' \" This account of honest Pigg is evidently exaggerated. Being a Puritan was sufficient to entitle him to the scoffs of the profane, and the hatred of bigots ofa different class. The provisions of his will shew that he was not deficient in discernment and good sense; and his choice of VOL. 1. \u2014 51. z"], [98, "GEOGRAPHICAL AND xc their heirs, three messuages or dwelling-houses, with their appurtenances, in Pilgrim Street, Newcastle ; two third parts of two copyhold tenements or farmholds, with the appurtenances, in Earsdon, Northumber land ; a moiety of another copyhold tenement or farmhold in Earsdon aforesaid ; and all his other property in Newcastle, Durham, and Northumberland, in trust, to pay in the first place all his debts and funeral ex penses ; and afterwards to pay to his niece, Ann Rea, for her great care and kindness to him, such sums of money as they should think fit and convenient for her. He also directed that \u00a35 per annum should be paid to the minister of Earsdon for the time being, or else to the poor of that parish ; \u00a35 to the overseers of the highways in Northumberland, for amending such highways as the trustees should think proper; and all the residue of the yearly rents and profits of the said estate to such poor people within the counties of Durham, Northumberland, and Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and in such proportions as they should think fit, so as the said poor people should be of the Protestant religion, and had not cast themselves into poverty by their idleness, or reduced themselves to beggary by their own riotous prodigality, but should be by age, sickness, or decre pidness, disabled from work, or where men should have children too numerous for their work to maintain. Whenever two of the trustees should die, the remaining five were to elect successors. By a decree of Chancery, the two third parts of the farmholds in Earsdon were surrendered, July 3, 1696, to the use of John Simpson and Ann his wife, formerly Ann Reay, on account ofthe allowance to her in the will. The remainder ofthe property was surrendered from time to time to successive trustees, and became at length vested in Lancelot Cramlington, who survived all his co-trustees, and in whose family it has conti nued. Henry Cramlington, Esq., of Newcastle, is the present possessor. The yearly payment of \u00a35 to the minister of Earsdon is all that has been paid to any charitable use. \" The three houses in Pilgrim Street, Newcastle,\" according to the Commissioners' Report, \"are let to different tenants, and the clear yearly rents amount to about \u00a3100 per annum ; and the clear yearly rent of the copyhold estate may be stated as of the same amount, but it is let at \u00a3120 per annum. It is undisputed that the whole of the above-mentioned property now in the possession of Mr. Cramlington was devised for charitable uses, by John Pigg, and has passed to the present possessor through the survivor of the trustees named in his will. Mr. Cramlington has given us all the assistance in his power in the investigation of this charity, and has expressed his readiness that the property should be settled in conformity with the intentions of the donor. He has, however, sug gested that credit ought to be given to him for a sum of upwards of \u00a3600 which he has laid out in the repairs. of the houses in Newcastle since he came into possession ; and he is anxious that particular regulations should be established for the future application of the rents, so that the charity should be of substantial benefit to the poor of the counties named in the testator's will. These points seem to be fit subjects for the considera tion of a court of equity on the establishment of this charity.\" Bishop Barrington' s Charity for Schools in the County of Durham. \u2014 By two acts of parliament, 41 Geo. III., for inclosing certain moors in the townships of Framwellgate and Witton-Gilbert, and in the manors of Chester and Lanchester, l-48th part ofthe lands were allotted to the Hon. and Right Rev. Shute, lord bishop of Durham, and his successors, as lord of the said manors, and also l-24th part in value ofthe said lands. An allotment of the latter amount was vested in the said bishop and his successors for ever, in trust, for the establishment and maintenance of schools for the religious and virtuous education of poor children of the county of Durham. By another act, 3 Geo. IA\"., it was stated that the said l-24th part of the moors consisted of three parcels of land, containing together 63 a. 3 r. 32 p., and let at yearly rents amounting to \u00a3105; and that, after paying the necessary expenses of the previous act, &c, there remained \u00a3575 in^the hands of the bishop. This sum being inadequate to the establishment of schools, it was enacted that the bishop for the time being might apply the said sum and the future proceeds of the land in support of such schools as were then or might afterwards be established. The rents of the above parcels of land are now reduced to \u00a383, 6s. 8d., and are applied in building, enlarging, and repairing schools and school-houses in different parts ofthe diocese, under the directions of the bishop of Durham, according to recommendations received from a committee for the encouragement of parochial schools in the diocese. See City of Durham. Bishop Barrington's Charity for a School in Bishop Auckland, aud other Purposes. \u2014 In 1809, Bishop Barrington received \u00a360,000 on a compromise of a suit in Chancery, in which he was complainant, and Thomas Richard Beaumont and Diana his wife, defendants. Of this sum he laid out \u00a320,331, 7s. 6d. in the purchase of \u00a330,000 three per cent, reduced annuities, and transferred the same into the names of George Barrington, Robert Price, AVilliam Price, and Barrington Price, to hold in trust, and to pay out of the diiTi- executors implies that his connexions were respectable. Bourne says that tbe cross which he took down at the Barras Bridge \" was broke by some who hated it should be profaned;\" but it is probably the very same cross which he set up at the Three-mile''Brid.-'e after cutting upon it some instructive scraps of holy writ. It was taken down a few years ago, and the stones were used in repairing a' smith's shop.

The trustees were likewise to pay the yearly sum of \u00a370 to the lord ofthe manor and the rector of Mongewell, Oxfordshire, towards the maintenance of the free school there, and other charities established by the donor ; \u00a320 to the four beads-people at Bishop Auckland ; \u00a324 to the eight beads-people at Durham ; and the residue of the dividends towards the education of the poor in the diocese of Durham, giving a preference to the support of the schools at Bishop Auckland.

Bishop Barrington s Charity for Schools on the Madras System, in the Diocese of Durham.- \u2014 Shute Bar- rington, bishop of Durham, by will, December 10, 1825, bequeathed \u00a33000, to be applied by his executors, George A^iscount Barrington, AVilliam Keppel Barrington, and Augustus Barrington, as they should think most advisable, for the purpose of erecting a school or schools for the instruction of poor children of the dio- cese of Durham, according to the Madras system, or for otherwise promoting the purposes of education. \u00a3300 was paid for legacy duty; and, of the remaining sum, \u00a31200 has been disposed of in sums varying from \u00a350 to \u00a3100, for the purposes mentioned in the will. Bishop Barrington's Society for promoting Religions Education, S,-c, in the Diocese of Durham. \u2014 By a codicil to the will above quoted, of the same date, the bishop bequeathed \u00a340,000 three per cent, consols, the dividends to be applied in life-annuities of \u00a3100 each to Ann Ranicott and Ann Franklin, and \u00a31000 to Ann Elizabeth Colberg. After the decease of these annuitants, one moiety of the said dividends was to be applied to the formation of a society, to be named \" The Barrington Society for promoting religious Edu- cation and Christian Piety in the Diocese of Durham,\" and to consist of official life and annual governors. The bishop of Durham and archdeacons of Durham and Northumberland for the time being were appointed official governors ; all donors of 50 guineas, or who, as executors or administrators of any deceased person, should have paid any legacy of 100 guineas, were to be life governors ; and all annual subscribers of live gui- neas or upwards were to be annual governors during the current year : the bishop of Durham to be president. One moiety of the income of the society was ordered to be applied towards the religious education of not less than five sons of poor clergymen of the diocese; each boy to be at least 14 years of age, and to have a pre- vious competent knowledge of the rudiments of Greek and Latin. After receiving the benefits of the insti- tution for three years, those boys intended for holy orders might be allowed an indulgence in the nature of an exhibition for four years longer, provided they should be members of either of the universities of Oxford or Cambridge. The remainder of the society's income was directed to be applied in promoting and encou- raging the erection, enlarging, or fitting up of churches and chapels in the diocese, in such manner as should best tend to the interest of pure religion and of the Established Church ; or, in case there should not be proper objects of this nature in any year, then the unapplied sum should go in aid of the before-mentioned intention ofthe society. This society is now formed, and the first meeting was held January 4, 1834, when four scholarships were established in the university of Durham (see City of Durham) ; and \u00a3100 each was voted to four projected new churches at North Shields, South Shields, Darlington, and Stockton, and \u00a3J0 to one at Seaham. R. A. D. Gresley, Esq., of Bishop Auckland, was appointed treasurer and secretary. Two-thirds of the dividends of the other moiety of \u00a340,000 three per cent, consols, above mentioned, were directed to be paid to the perpetual curate for the time being of Bishop Auckland or Auckland St. Andrew, and the remaining third to the corporation of the Sons of the Clergy. The Diocese. The diocese of Durham is the second in rank, and the richest in England. It includes the coun ties of Durham and Northumberland, with the exception of the peculiar of Hexham, belonging to the archbishopric of York. The diocese is divided into the archdeaconries of Durham and North umberland : the former is subdivided into the deaneries of Chester in the Street, Darlington. Easington, and Stockton ; the latter into those of Alnwick, Bambrough, Corbridge, Morpeth, and Newcastle. The powers anciently exercised by the bishop were so extensive, that he is said to have had all the authority in the bishopric which the king exercised elsewhere. He had power to levy taxes, make truces with the Scots, and to raise defensible men within the county between the ages of 16"], [100, "XCII GEOGRAPHICAL AND and 60.* He had a council or parliament, amongst the most distinguished members of which were the prior of Durham for the time being, and the representatives of the families of Hilton, Conyers, Bulmer, Surtees, Hansard, &c. Most of the lands of the palatinate belonged to the bishop, and were held of him as lord paramount, in capite, or otherwise, as the lands in other parts were of the king. All the moors and wastes in the county, to which no other person could make a title, be longed to him, and could not be inclosed without his special permission. Neither could freehold lands be alienated without his leave ; or, if they were, the parties were obliged, upon discovery, to sue to him for his patent of pardon, which he could also grant for all intrusions, trespasses, &c.

Stow writes that, in 1196, Richard I. \"granted licence unto Philip his chaplain, late made bishop of Durham, to coyne money in the city of Durham, which liberty none of his predecessors had enjoyed for long time before ;\" and King Henry III. granted a seisin to Bishop Kirkham to the same effect. The coins, however, are generally supposed to have been similar to those from the royal mint. The ostentatious Bishop Beck first placed on his money a cross moline, his family arms; but Bishop Kellow, having no pretensions to armorial bearings, distinguished his coins from the regal by having the upright bar ofthe cross upon the reverse turned to represent a pastoral staff. Lewis Beaumont imitated Beck, by placing his family arms, a lion rampant, upon his coins ; but Bishop Hatfield followed the modest device of Kellow. Hitherto, pennies were the only coins which had issued from the episcopal mint ; but Bishop Booth obtained a charter, dated July 21, 1473, by which he and his successors were allowed to coin halfpennies also, and to make trussels and standards (upper and lower dies) for the same during the king's pleasure. Bishop Sherwood petitioned the king to command the treasurer and barons of the exchequer to give him three new standards and nine trussels for an equal quantity of broken ones of both sorts which they had received ; and he appointed George Stryall, of Durham, goldsmith, to work his mint in that city, from the feast of St. Michael then next for three"], [101, "STATISTICAL DESCRIPTION. XCIII The privileges of the palatinate are still very considerable; the bishop, as count palatine, acting as Custos Rotulorum of the county, and having the appointment of the high sheriff, and all the officers of justices. His sheriff is not obliged, like other sheriff's, to account to the exchequer, but makes up his audit to the bishop only. All the forfeitures upon outlawries, &c, belong to the bishop; and he and his temporal chancellor act as justices of the peace for the county palatine. The judges of assize, and all the officers of the court, have still their ancient salaries from the bishop; and he has the power of presiding in person in any of the courts of judicature. Even when judgment of blood is given, he may sit, attired in his purple robes, though the canons forbid any clergyman to be present on such occasions; hence the old saying, \" Solum Dunelmense stola jus dices et ense.\"\" The bishop is also a temporal prince, being Earl of Sadberge, which he holds by barony. He has power in civil government for the preservation of peace and the coercion of malefactors, for creating corporations, and appointing magistrates* and officers; he has also the forfeitures for treason, felonies, and all other crimes, capital and not capital. The bishop has com- position money upon fines levied, and recoveries suffered, in the Court of Pleas at Durham, and upon all original writs issued out of the courts of the county palatine, where the debt or damages exceed i?40 ; and has all forfeited recognizances, fines, ancl amerciaments awarded in the several other courts. \"The revenues of the see,\" says Hutchinson, \"cannot be critically shewn to the reader, as the officers in the several departments are not at liberty to exhibit to the public the amount of their respective receipts ; and, indeed, it would be extending the eye of curiosity too far to search into secrets which could give so little gratification.'''' The same cautious policy is still continued; and, consequently, the different estimates of the value of the see, which have appeared from time to time, vary according to the political parties and intentions of their respective writers. The most generally received opinion, however, is that the average annual revenue of the bishop is about -PSO^OO. The following are the manors belonging to the bishopric : \u2014 Chester AVard. \u2014 Chester, which comprises the townships of Ryton, AVhitburn and Cleadon, and Boldon. \u2014 Lanchester, which comprehends the townships of Roughside and Rowley, Benfieldside, Butsfield, Broom- years, paying four marks yearly to the warden of the Tower of London ; and he, with others, became bound to the bishop in \u00a3300 to coin the money of the same alloy, assay, and weight, as that of the Tower. AViUiam Richerdson was master of the mint to Bishop Fox. The succeeding prelates continued to exercise this privi lege till the time of Bishop TunstaU, when it was at least virtually abolished by the celebrated act of 27 Hen. VIII. Several of the early English monarchs had money coined at Durham. \u2014 Bartlet on the Episcopal Coins of Durham ; Pegge' s Assemblage of Prelatical Coins ; Hutchinson, _j-c. * Spearman gives the following curious, and perhaps exaggerated description of the magistrates of the county, at the time he wrote (1729): \u2014 \"The bishops of Durham anciently appointed men of law to be jus- tices, to hold their courts of Common Pleas, but now clergymen and tradesmen are made justices of the pleas to try the property of the subject, and to hear and determine upon the debates of lawyers in law proceedino-s. And sometimes they have the assistance of a prebendary or two, to sit upon the bench ; altho' of little expe- rience in matters of law, and ill qualified for that station: And we remember one of them, tho' otherwise a pious good man, but so little skilled in law affairs, that sitting on the bench, and hearing John Doe and Richard Roe frequently named, said they were very litigious men, and desired to see them, to reprimand them. The late Bishop Crew is said to be guilty of the like mistake, for hearing dohn Doe called, desired he might not be condemned in that matter depending, till he could be heard ; but being told that John Doe was only a man of straw, he blushed at his mistake, and seldom or never appeared on the bench after it. Nay it may be proved, that one of the justices of the pleas (viz.) Mr. Ralph Bambridge (then mayor) travel- led five miles to Ferry HiU, for five shillings, to take the conusance of a fine, from one Dorothy Shaw to Robert Dunn; and abated six shillings and eight pence, the remainder of his fee of eleven shillings and eight pence, to the attorney for his custom. And another of these mettled justices of the pleas, Dr. J n affirmed, that furse or whinns were timber, and cutting them by tenants was waste.\" \u2014 Enquiry, p. 103. vol. i. 2 a"], [102, "GEOGRAPHICAL AND XCIV shields, Coldpighill and Satley, Broom and Flass, Burnop and Hamsteels, Kyo, BiUingside, and Peth.

A cer tain small fine, called demise money, as marked on the margin of every surrender and admittance, is paid upon purchase, admittance of the heir, mortgagee, or other person, and cannot be enhanced at the will of the lord. If any person purchases a copyhold, and takes the surrender absolute to himself, and his sequels in right, in such case he cannot devise the same by will, unless he pre viously pass a surrender to a trustee, to the use thereof; nor can the widow be entitled to her frank-bank (durante viduitate et castitate) unless her husband dies seised, and the legal estate not vested in a trustee. The bishop is entitled to work, or demise by lease, all the mines: he is also entitled to all wood, which the copyholder cannot cut (unless for necessary repairs) without licence and composition first made with the bishop. In Gateshead and AVhickham manors the surrenders must be presented to the homage, or they are not ; but in all the other manors they are passed before the steward or his deputies.

The ecclesiastical patronage of the bishop of Durham is extensive. He presents fo the arch deaconries of Durham and Northumberland ; to all the twelve prebends in the cathedral church ; to twenty-one rectories, four vicarages, and five curacies, in the archdeaconry of Durham ; to nine vicarages and three curacies in that of Northumberland; and to one rectory, three vicarages, and one curacy, in Yorkshire.* * In the Church of England, the clerical dignity next to the bishop is the archdeacon, whose duty, though very different in different dioceses, may be termed that of a representative of the bishop in several of his less important functions- The name of dean (decanus) was probably derived from his originaUy superintending ten canons or prebendaries. The chapter or council, with the dean at its head, are appointed to assist the bishop. A prebend is a provision in land or money given to a church in prwbendum, that is, for the support of a clergyman whose title may be either prebendary or canon. Spearman, after citing the example of the House of Commons as a constitutional check upon the encroachments of the crown, adds, \" Deans and chap ters, in like manner, are guardians of the church, and trustees to preserve the rights of the church in succes sion : And the donations of the prebends of the church of Durham, by the wisdom of King Henry 8. foundation were reserved in the crown, that thev should be his counsel and trustees for the church, and a check upon any arbitrary designs of the bishop, on whom they ought not to have any dependence: But Bishop TunstaU being a favourite of King Philip and Queen Mary, prevailed upon these princes to part with that flower of the crown, and grant the donation of those prebends to the bishop and his successors.\" Rector is, in general, the title of a clergyman holding a living, of which the tithes are entire ; vicar is understood of a living where the great tithes have passed into secular hands.

Parliamentary Representation. \" The county of Durham,\" says Surtees, \"was formerly exempt from the burthen oi sending representatives to parliament, in consequence of the bishop's palatine jurisdiction, by virtue of which, he, with the consent of his council, levied taxes, and raised men within the bishopric, with out reference to the authority of parliament.\" Efforts were made, however, soon after the Refor mation, to obtain a privilege now considered as essential ; for, on January 18, 1562-3, a bill was read in the House of Commons for levying fines in the county palatine of Durham, and \" to have two knights from thence into the parliament.\" On May 21, 1614, a bill was read \"for knights and burgesses to have place in parliament for the county palatyne and city of Durham, and bo- curate signifies sometimes (as cure' in France) a clergyman in possession of a living, but more frequently one exercising the spiritual office in a parish under the rector or vicar. The latter are temporary curates, their appointment being a matter of arrangement with the rector or vicar ; the former, being more \"permanent, are called perpetual curates, and are appointed by the impropriator of the tithe in a parish which has neither rector nor vicar. A clerk in orders corresponds to the name of priest in the church of Rome. A parson (persona ecclesi\u00e6) denotes a clergyman in possession of a parochial church. A deacon, in the Church of England, is a clergyman of limited qualifications, entitled to preach, baptize, marry, and bury, but not to give the sacrament. Readers are not regular clergymen, but laymen of good character, licensed by the bishop to read prayers in churches or chapels where there is no clergyman. A clerical education in England is of much less length than in Calvinist countries. The degree of Bachelor of Arts requires an examination and a university residence of three or four years; but to qualify for the acceptance of a curacy, a certificate of attending a single course of lectures in divinity is all that is necessary. Advowson (advocatio) is the right of presentation to a living, and was first vested in those laymen who were founders of, or benefactors to livings. A living is held in commendam when, to prevent its becoming void, it is committed (commendatur) until it can be conveniently provided with a pastor. The modus (modus decimandi) is a composition for tithes ; it may be either perpetual or during the lives of the con tracting parties. The lay impropriators of tithe, so frequent in England, date from the dissolution of the monasteries in the reign of Henry VIII. ; patrons were then allowed to retain the tithes and glebe in their own hands, without appointing a clergyman ; in cases of such appointment, the clergyman was called vica rius, or representative ofthe patron. \u2014 Spearman's Enquiry, p. 79.

On March 6, 1620, another bill was read, when fourteen mem bers were claimed. On the report, March 14, it was agreed that there should be \" knights for the county and citizens for Durham : Hartlepool to have burgesses, because it is a port town,\" and Barnard Castle, \" because it is the prince's town, and he desireth it :\" the rest were rejected, be cause of pestering the House. Hartlepool was afterwards \" stricken out,\" and the bill engrossed and passed to the Upper House. Successive bills and discussions on the subject appear in the journals of the Commons in 1623, 1624, 1640, and 1642. Petitions were sent from the inhabitants of the county to parliament in 1645, 1646, and 1650; and, on the latter occasion, they were in formed \" that an equal care should be had of them therein with the rest of the nation.\" It was not till the parliaments of 1654 and 1656, however, that the county and city of Durham were per mitted to return members ; and in the last parliament of the Commonwealth, no representatives were admitted for either of them. On a petition of the knights, justices of peace, grand jury, gen tlemen, ministers, and freeholders, a bill was brought into the House of Commons, March 31, 1659, for restoring members for Durham, and which was referred to a committee.* The efforts of the freeholders were revived on the Restoration ; and a bill was read for the first time in the Commons, on July 28, 1660, for enabling the county and city to send knights and bur gesses to parliament. Though this bill passed the Lower House, nothing further is recorded on the subject till 1666; when the grand juiy, at the quarter sessions held at Durham on April 23, presented \" a paper\" to the magistrates for procuring knights and burgesses, which they desired might be sent to the bishop (Cosin) ; and at the sessions on the 3d of October following, a petition was read from the grand jury, in the name of the freeholders, to the justices of the peace. They plead the privilege of sending men to represent them in the great council of the nation, and to assist in making and repealing the laws whereby they are governed, as \" the undoubted birth-right of all the free-borne subjects of England.\" Like the parliamentary reformers of the present day, they describe the sadness of their own \"deplorable condicon, who (without any crime objected, or other cause pretended against us) are debarred of this priviledge to our no small dishonour and disadvantage ;\" and, after mentioning their payment of taxes, and their sufferings in point of trade from the want of representation, they adduce \" two very sad instances, the first the _P26,000 lent the Scots army about 7 & 20 years agoe ; the other this great additionall charge now laid upon us in the present monthly assessment. The former (in all likelihood) might have been procured, and the latter prevented, or (at least) much mitigated, if wee had members of our owne to have acted these businesses for us in the house.\" The petition concludes with a desire that the magistrates would send proper persons to solicit parliament. This petition being read in open court, \" the Right Rev. John Lord Bishop of Durham did enter his protestation against the same ; and John Sudbury, doctor in divinity, dean of Durham ; Isaac Basire, doctor in divinity ; Thomas Cradock, Esq. ; Samuel Davison, Esq. ; and AVilliam Blakis ton, Esq., five of the justices then present in court, did declare and enter their dissent or dislike thereunto : But Sir Nicholas Cole, Knight and Baronet ; Henry Lambton, Esq. ; John Tempest, Anthony Byerley, Ralph Davison, Cuthbert Carr, Lodowick Hall, Robert Clavering, Ralph Carr, John Morland, and Christopher Sanderson, Esquires, eleven justices then also present in court, did approve of the said petition, and gave their assent to the same.\" John Tempest and AVilliam Da- * The sentiments of the speakers are related with commendable brevity in Burton's Diary, vol iv. p. 310.

XCVII vison, Esqrs., were sent to London by the magistrates; and although their mission was unsuccess ful, yet their zeal was duly appreciated, and they were received on their return to the county with great rejoicings (see Bradbury and the Isle). The freeholders then published their reasons for desiring representatives in parliament ; of which Surtees gives the following brief summary : \u2014 That all counties, and even the county palatine of Chester, have knights and burgesses; that they are subject to all imposts by parliament, and that they are liable to prejudice in their trade and in the proportioning of aids, &c, from the want of representatives; and that the jurisdiction of the county palatine would not be impaired thereby. The bishop replies at some length, stating, that by ancient privilege the county is exempt from sending knights and burgesses ; that he is bound by oath to maintain such privilege ; that it would alter the palatine constitution ; that Breve Regis non currit in Comitatu Palatino Dunelmensis is the return he makes to writs infringing his immunities ; that the city of Durham and all other cor porations in the county have their charters from the bishop ; that this attempt was first made about 53 years since by a few discontented gentlemen, who sought to lessen the bishop's power; that the whole county withstood the innovation then, and many do so now, though others, to obtain their purpose, offer the bishop the nomination of owe knight and one burgess for his consent ; that there was no such precedent but in Cromwell's time; that their complaint of taxes laid on them without their consent, is nothing new; that they do not suffer on that account, the bishop always taking special care in proportioning the taxes; and that taxes are laid on the clergy in the bishopric, who have no representative to vote for them, \" but only their own bishop of Durham.\" The bishop shortly afterwards published further reasons, \" calculated chiefly to resist the adduced precedent of the county palatyne of Chester.\" But the ground-work of his continued opposition to the wishes of the county is probably developed in the postscript of a letter from him to John Tempest and Ralph Davison, Esqrs., December 14, 1667, wherein he says, \" I do not find in your bill the saving of any rights or privileges, proper to the bishop himself, but only such as are com mon to the inhabitants of the county palatine, who derive all their liberties and immunities from and under him ; nor do you keep your first offer and promise in assuring him, that the bishop, for the time being, shall have the chusing of one knight and burgess ,- and divers other clauses you have omitted in that your bill whereunto you said you would agree.\" On March 26, 1668, the bill, introduced into parliament amidst such conflicting interests, was lost by a majority of 65 to 50.* Opposition to the measure, however, seems to have died with Bishop Cosin ; for, two years after his decease, and during the vacancy of the see, an act was quietly passed to enable the freeholders to elect two knights for the county, and the mayor, alder men, and freemen of the city of Durham, to elect two burgesses, to represent them in parliament. (See City of Durham.) The following is the succession of members for the county, chiefly com piled from Sir C. Sharp's \" List of Knights and Burgesses :\" \u2014 * Mr. Crouch \u2014 The west and the north have already so many knights and burgesses, that the midland in all taxes smart for it, in their being over-rated. Mr. Steward \u2014 It is a hard case that that county should be taxed in all parliaments, and yet have no representatives. Mr. A'aughan \u2014 Thinks the inconvenience of Durham is now no more than formerly. If we have all our members here, we have no room for them ; if we brin**\"* in more members, we may, by the same rule, multiply them to as many more. The county of York has many, but they may as well put in for knights for every riding ; and the northern parts are sufficiently provided for already.

A public meeting, however, was held at Souih Shields, at which an address to Mr. Burdon was voted, and signed by 174 freeholders, requesting that gentleman to alter his resolution ; and a similar address was sent from Sunderland. Requests to Mr. Burdon were also forwarded from a body of Durham freeholders in Lon don, and from the borough of Gateshead ; but that gentleman, both in his replies to these documents and in private, persevered in his intention to withdraw from public life. The spirit of the county, however, was aroused ; committees were formed ; a county meet-n*** was convened; and Mr. Burdon was proposed and seconded as a fit and proper person to represent the county of Durham. Sir H. V. Tempest, Bart., who professed to have offered himself solely on the ground of a vacancy in the representation, and who now per ceived the intensity of the public feeling in favour of Mr. Burdon, honourably withdrew from the contest. Unable longer to resist the united voice of his constituents, Mr. Burdon suffered himself to be put in nomination, and, with Sir Ralph Milbanke, Bart., was elected without opposition. Various meetings were again held, for the purpose of expressing the satisfaction of the public at the result, and at which addresses of thanks to Mr. Burdon were voted and numerously signed In this election, the ordinary course of proceedings was completely reversed ; the solicitations and the exertions being all made by the electors, the object of their choice alone remaining at home, quiet in the bosom of his family, until recalled to public life in the honourable manner above recounted.

Durham, taking its dimensions into consideration, is inferior to no county in Great Britain for the number of its manufactures; though few of these are carried on to any considerable extent. The fabrication of stuffs and carpeting, according to a note appended to the Population Returns of 1831, employs about 550 persons, upwards of 20 years of age, at Barnard Castle and in the city of Durham : the number at Darlington is not mentioned. AVeaving woollens employs 70 at Shil don and AVolsingham. The wool produced in the county has been estimated at two periods as follows: \u2014 In 1800, 159,385 short wool sheep, averaging 5 ft. per fleece, and producing 3320 packs; and 67.200 long wool sheep, averaging 9 ft- per fleece, and producing 2520 packs.

The leather trade is carried on with spirit at Darlington and other places. The salt works at South Shields and Birtley are noticed at page lxxiv. and under their respective heads ; it may, however, be necessary to state here, that tbe salt produced at the latter place cannot be advan tageously used in the curing of beef, so essential to tlie shipping trade of this district.

The smelting of lead-ore has already been noticed, in which 30 persons, above 20 years of age, are engaged at Eggleston. The manufactures usual at shipping places, viz. ropery, paint, anchors, &c, employ about 350 persons. Many wind and water mills* for grinding corn are scattered over the face of the county of Dur ham. These picturesque objects, however, in consequence of the cheapness of fuel, begin to be superseded by steam-mills. Paper-mills have long been worked on the streams in various parts of the county ; and saw-mills have recently been established in several placcs.-f In the year ending Janua'ry 5, 1829, there were in the county of Durham 48 brewers, 3 retail brewers, 1334 victuallers (of whom 211 brewed their own beer), and 1 intermediate brewer.

CIII Shipping. \u2014 During the 14th century, three separate calls were made by government upon the ports of England for ships and men. In 1341, the port of Tyne contributed three ships ; in 1344, two ships; and, in 1347, i* sent 17 ships and 314 mariners to the siege of Calais. Hartlepool fur nished, on the same occasion, 5 ships and 145 mariners.* In 1615, there were employed in the coal trade of Newcastle, 400 sail of ships, one half of which supplied London, and the remainder the other parts of the kingdom. The shipping of the T\\ _ie, in 1676, was estimated at 80,000 tons. In 1703, the master of the Trinity House of Newcastle reported, by request, to the House of Commons, that 600 ships, of the average burthen of 80 Newcastle chaldrons, with 4500 seamen, were necessary for carrying on the coal trade.

On September 30, 1821, there belonged to the port of Sunderland 557 ships, carrying 81,808 tons, and employing 3717 seamen. By the returns of 1829, this port was the fourth in the king dom, having 624 ships, containing 107,628 tons, being an increase of more than 100 per cent, in about half a century.

One of their celts was found in a coal vein exposed to the day, in Craig y Pare, Monmouthshire. C\u00e6sar, indeed, takes no notice of coal in his description of this island; but the Romans subsequently discovered its use. The calcareous flooring used in * \" The summe of the North Fleete\" was 217 ships and 4521 mariners ; and the South Fleet consisted of 493 ships and 9630 mariners, in which number are included the king's ships, which were 25, with 419 ma riners.

About 40 years ago, abundance of copper nails, an iron hammer, and other implements of a smith's shop, were found buried in small ashes of coal, within the founda tions of a small circular building, on the side of Watling Street, near Low AAroodside, about three miles south of Ebchester. Whitaker quotes a grant made by the abbey of Peterborough, dated 852, from which it is evident that coals were used as fuel in this country by the Saxons, under the name of Gr\u0153fan. No mention is made of this fossil during the turbulent period of the Danish invasions, nor for many years after the Norman Conquest. It first occurs in a charter of Henry III., 1239, which grants licence to the burgesses of Newcastle to dig for coal. In 1281, Newcastle is said to have had a considerable trade in that article. About the end of that century, or the beginning of the 14th, coals began to be imported into London, being at first used only by smiths, brewers, dyers, soap-boilers, &c. This innovation was, however, loudly complained of. A notion got abroad, that the smoke was highly injurious to the public health ; and, in 1316, parliament petitioned the king, Edward I., to prohibit the burning of coal, on the ground of its being an intolerable nuisance. His majesty issued a proclamation conformably to the prayer of the petition; but it being little attended to, recourse was had to more vigorous measures ; a commission of oyer and terminer being issued out, with instructions to inquire as to all who burned sea-coal within the city, or parts ad joining, to punish them for the first offence by \" pecuniary mulcts,\" and upon a second offence to demolish their furnaces; and to provide for the strict observance of the proclamation in all time to come.* But notwithstanding the efforts that were thus made to prohibit the use of coal, and the prejudice that was long entertained against it, it continued progressively to gain ground. This was partly, no doubt, owing to experience having shewn that coal smoke has not the noxious in fluence ascribed to it, but far more to the superior excellence of coal as an article of fuel, and the increasing scarcity and consequent high price of timber. Edward III. issued orders concerning coal measures, and allowed coals got in the fields of Gates head to be taken across the Tyne to Newcastle, on condition of their paying the usual customs of tbat port ; ancl, after such payment, to be sent to any part of the kingdom, either by land or water, but to no place out of it, except to Calais. The inhabitants of the county of Durham had no privilege to load or unload coals on the south side of the Tyne till 1384, when Richard II. , on account of his devotion to St. Cuthbert, granted them licence to export the produce of their mines, without paying any duties to the corporation of Newcastle; and the bishop, consequently, ap pointed a supervisor of his mines of coal and iron, within his royalty, and in the districts of Nor hamshire and Islandshire. In 1582,-j- Queen Elizabeth obtained a 99 years lease of the manors and * Stowe observes, \"AVithin thirty years last, the nice dams (dames) of London would not come into any house where sea coales were burned : nor willingly eat of the meat that was either sod or roasted with sea coal fire.\" AValter Blithe, in his Improver Improved, published in 1649, says that \"it was not many years since the famous city of London petitioned the parliament of England against two nuisances ; and these were Newcastle coals, in regard of their stench, &c., and hops, in regard they would spoyl the taste of drink, and endanger the people : and had the parliament been no wiser than they, we had been in a measure pined, and in a great measure starved ; which is just answerable to the principles of those men who cry down all devices, or ingenious discoveries, as projects, and thereby stifle and choak improvements.\" t Harrison's Description of England, prefixed to Hollingshead's Chronicle, edited in the year 1577, contains some curious and interesting notices concerning the coal trade. \"Of cole-mines,\" says this quaint writer, \"we have such plenty in the north and western parts of our island, as may suffice for all the realme of Englande."], [113, "STATISTICAL DESCRIPTION. CV royalties of Gateshead and AVhickham, at the yearly rent of ._f 90. This was called the Grand Lease, and caused an immediate advance in the price of coals. It was afterwards transferred to the Earl of Leicester, who assigned it to his secretary, Thomas Sutton, the founder of the Charter house; and he, in consideration of _P12,000, transferred it to Sir William Riddell and others, for the use of the mayor and burgesses of Newcastle; and the price of coals, which in the beginning of the 16th century had been 4s. ld. per chaldron in London, and about 2s. 6d. at Newcastle, im- mediately advanced to 7&. and 8s. a chaldron. In 1590, the current price in London was 9s. ; on which the Lord Mayor complained to the Lord Treasurer, Burleigh, of the monopoly. In the lat- ter end of the reign of Elizabeth, the duty of 4d. a chaldron on coal exported from Newcastle pro- duced annually the sum of i?10,000. King Charles I. successively granted to different companies the sole power of selling coals exported from the Tyne. In 1643, when the Scots besieged New castle, all the coal-mines were, it is said, ordered to be set on fire, which was prevented by General Leslie. In the following year, in consequence of the Marquis of Newcastle having prohibited the exportation of coals to London, they rose to the enormous price of \u00a3] per chaldron ; and, in 1648, coals were so excessively dear in London, that many ofthe poor are said to have died for want of fuel. During the last century the export of coals gradually increased. From 1704 to 1710, the ave- rage annual export from Newcastle was 178,143 chaldrons. In 1764, the trade from the Tyne increased 32,000 chaldrons. On an average for six years, ending at Christmas, l/^/'G, there were annually cleared from the custom house of Newcastle, 380,000 chaldrons, of which 260,000 were sent to London, 90,000 to other British ports, 2000 to British colonies, and 27,000 to other foreign ports. From 1791 to 1799, inclusive, 4,289,7-27 chaldrons were exported from the port of New- castle. Of this quantity 2,995,629 were sent to London, 921,480 coastwise, and 372,618 to foreio*n countries. The average export during these nine years was 476,634 chaldrons ; from whence it ap- pears that the trade was nearly trebled in extent during the century. The following is an account of the number of chaldrons (Newcastle measure, or 53 cwt.) vended from the Tyne from 1800 to 1828, distinguishing the coast from the foreign vend: \u2014 Years. Coastwise.

After this period, the coal trade of Sunderland continued to be an object of jealousy to the host men of Newcastle; and, during the last century, it increased rapidly. From 1704 to 1710, the average export of coals from that port was 65,760 chaldrons. In 1750, the quantity exported had increased to 162,277 chaldrons. In 1770, the export was 213,645 chaldrons ; and, in 1790, it reached 298,077 chaldrons.

At the Restoration, the quantity of coals imported into London was supposed to amount to about 200,000 chaldrons. In 1670, the imports had increased to 270,000 chaldrons. At the Revolution, they amounted to about 300,000 chaldrons, and have since gone on increasing with the growino magnitude and population of the city; being, in 1750, about 500,000 chaldrons; and, in 1800, about 900,000 chaldrons.

CVII From an account published by authority of the Coal and Corn Committee of London, it appears that during the year 1833, 2,010,409 tons of coal were imported into that city; of which quantity Newcastle sent 1,060,147, Sunderland 664,383, Stockton 170,187, Blyth 48,689, Scotland 15,138, AVales 28,416, Yorkshire 16,050, small coals, &c. 7399 tons.

Of these quantities, Holland took 114,238 tons; Den mark, 74,445; Germany, 69,896; France, 45,218; Russia, 42,736; United States of America, 28,512; Prussia, 24,068; other foreign countries, 43,253; and our own colonies in the East and West Indies, North America, the Channel Islands, &c, 192,082. In 1785, a combination of ship-owners and others concerned in the coal trade, to enhance the price of that necessary article, was defeated by the attention of the lord mayor of London ; and in 1788, a similar scheme by the coal-buyers of that city was suppressed by parliament. In April, 1799, the price of coals in London rose to \u00a36 per chaldron ; and a committee of the House of Commons attributed this enormous price to the \" limitation of vends, by which each colliery on the Tyne is limited so as not to exceed a certain quantity in each year, as stipulated by the owners of the collieries.11 This limitation has existed, with some short intermissions, ever since 1771- The proportion between the Tyne and Wear has generally been three-fifths for the former river, and two-fifths for the latter ; and the proprietors and owners on each river distribute the respective basis of their own river amongst themselves. This subject has excited much discussion ; and Mr. Alderman Waithman asserted, in 1829, that the tax thus levied by the coal-owners upon the city of London amounted to _C800,000. Many writers, however, have maintained that the limitation is as much for the public benefit as for that of the coal-owners, by providing a regular supply, and preventing the inferior collieries from being laid in or lost.* * Mr. M'Culloch observes, \" Much has frequently been said of the monopoly of the coal-owners on the Tyne and the AVear; but we are satisfied, after a pretty careful investigation ofthe circumstances, that no Such monopoly has ever existed ; and that the high price of coal in the metropolis is to be ascribed wholly to the various duties and charges that have been laid upon it, from the time that it has passed from the hands of the owner, to the time that it is lodged in the cellar of the consumer. What means have the coal-owners \u2713"], [116, "GEOGRAPHICAL AND CVIII Mr. Buddie thinks that the aggregate capital employed by the coal-owners on the Tyne amounts to about _P1, 500,000, exclusive of the craft in the river; and it may be presumed that the capital employed on the AVear amounts to above \u00a31, 000,000. The hazard attending this sort of property is so great, that it has never been possible to effect an insurance on a coal-work, against fire, water, or any other accident. The gentleman just quoted informed the committee of the House of Lords, that, \" although many collieries, in the hands of fortunate individuals and companions, have been perhaps making more than might be deemed a fair and reasonable profit according to their risk, like a prize in the lottery ; yet, as a trade, taking the whole capital employed on both rivers, he should say that certainly it has not been so.\" Again, being asked, \" What have the coal-owners on the Tyne and AVear, in your opinion, generally made on their capital employed P\" he replied, \" According to the best of my knowledge, I should think that by no means ten per cent, has been made at simple interest, without allowing any extra interest for the redemption of capita/.'''' The same gentleman gives the following estimate ofthe number of persons engaged in the different departments of the coal trade on the Tyne and AVear : \u2014 \" I would beg to observe, the returns from the Tyne are official documents ; from the Wear I have no returns, but it is by an approximate cal culation. The number of persons employed under ground on the Tyne are, men 4937, boys 3554, together 84<91 ; above ground, men 2745, boys 718, making 3463 ; making the total employed in the mines, above ancl below ground, 11,954, which in round numbers I call 12,000, because I am pretty sure there were some omissions in the returns. On the river Wear, I conceive there are 9000 em ployed ; making 21,000 employed in digging the coal and delivering it to the ships on the two rivers. From the best calculations I have been able to make, it would appear, that averaging the coasting vessels that carry coals to the size of 220 London chaldrons each vessel, there would be 1400 vessels of obtaining a monopoly price for their coal ? They enjoy no exclusive privileges of any sort ; they are a numerous body ; and their trade is as open as any other to all capitalists to engage in. The number of places on the east and west coasts, both of England and Scotland, and the southern parts of Wales, from which coals are exported, render it quite visionary to suppose that any general agreement to keep up prices can take place amongst the various coal proprietors. And though such an agreement were entered into, it is impossible it couid be maintained. The power of producing coal greatly exceeds the present demand ; many new mines have been recently opened, and many others would be brought into activity were the price arti ficially enhanced. It is true that the coal-owners referred to, having experienced the ruinous effects of throwing a superabundant quantity of coal upon restricted and already glutted markets, have occasionally \u00a3the writer should have said periodically] met together, and each having named the price he thinks his coal will command, and at which he intends lo sell it, they have proceeded Jointly to regulate, according to the pro bable demand, the quantity that each shall raise during any particular period. By means of this arrange ment, the supply and price of coal has been kept, during the time it has existed, comparatively steady. Common prudence prompts and justifies such an arrangement ; but it also suggests the necessity of reducing the price of coal to the lowest level that will afford the customary rate of profit. For were the price de manded by the northern coal-owners raised above this level, new mines would be opened in Durham and Northumberland ; the imports from the Tees, whence a large supply of excellent coal is at present brought to the London market, would be augmented; and fresh competitors, from Swansea and other places, would come into the field and undersell them.\" The results enumerated in the latter part of the above extract have already partially taken place. If, therefore, this writer's deduction be correct, the cause he has specified, viz. an enhanced price, must have previously occurred. He continues, \" Government should encourage and promote this fair competition ; but it ought, at the same time, to do equal justice to all the competitors. It is not to lend assistance to, or re move burdens from, one set of adventurers, which it does not lend to or remove from others. It is no part of its duty to say how coals, or any species of produce, shall be carried to market. It is bound to give every reasonable facility for the opening of new channels or modes of conveyance between all parts of the country ; but it would be glaringly unjust to lay a tax on the coals conveyed by a particular channel, from which those conveyed by other channels were exempted.\""], [117, "STATISTICAL DESCRIPTION. CIX employed, which would require 15,000 seamen and boys. I have made a summary. There are, seamen, 15,000; pitmen and above ground people employed in the collieries, 21,000; keelmen, coal-boatmen, casters, and trimmers, 2000; making the total number employed in what I call the northern coal trade 38,000. In London, whippers, lightermen, and so forth, 5000 ; factors, agents, &c, on the Coal Exchange, 2500; 7-500 in all in London: making the grand total, in the north country and London departments of the trade, 45,500. This does not, of course, include tlie per sons employed at the outports in discharging the ships there.11 If the latter persons be estimated at 4500, and those engaged in the collieries on the Tees and at Blyth at 5000, the total number employed by the coal trade of the district will be 55,000. In another place, Mr. Buddie states that \"colliers are always paid by the piece.11 Consequently their wages vary according to the work they have to do; and it is difficult to form an average. They have varied from 14s. a week to, in some instances, 40s. The colliers can earn up to 5s. or even more per day ; but there is not full employment for them : 2s. 6d. per clay is the certain wages that they are hired to receive from their employers, whether they are employed or not. Their dwelling-houses, for which they pay a small acknowledgment, belong to the colliery owners.* * The pitmen of the Tyne and A\\7ear have frequent disputes with their employers, which they sometimes endeavour to decide by a stick, or general suspension of work ; and, from the numbers of the men, and the staple article on which they are employed, these sticks have a very powerful effect on the commerce and pros- perity of the district. The general system pursued at the collieries is to bind, or contract to work, for a year ; and formerly, when there was a scarcity of pitmen, a bounty called binding money was given, which varied from 5 to 20 guineas a man; but this custom is now discontinued. At the binding in October, 1809, the owners proposed that the men should be engaged for a quarter, or a year and a quarter, so as to bring the binding time to the latter end of December, or the beginning of January, to which the men agreed. They soon, however, repented their bargain; and on October 16, 1810, a meeting of delegates was held at Long Benton, in Northumberland, when it was resolved by the majority that a stick should take place, unless the owners would continue to bind the men from the 18th of October. This not being complied with, the men accordingly struck, and their delegates were hunted out and imprisoned. The numbers in Durham gaol and house of correction were so great, that, to prevent infection, about 300 were confined in the stables and sta- ble-yard of the bishop, under a military guard. It was at length decided that the binding time should be removed to the Sth of April. This strike continued seven weeks. On March 31, 1831, the under-ground workmen of 47 collieries on the Tyne and AVear held a meeting on the Town Moor, Newcastle, to take measures for obtaining some improvement in their condition. Their grievances did not appear to be connected with the prices of their work, but with some objectionable parts of their bond of service, by which they were often laid idle on trifling accidents to the pits, &c. ; the undue au- thority held by viewers and agents, several of whom kept shops, at which they compelled the men to purchase their goods ; the compulsory suspension of work at Christmas ; and the length of time boys were immured in the collieries, to the destruction of their health and the prevention of their education. It was resolved to petition parliament ; to continue to work unbound, if the owners would allow them ; and, if not, to cease work, and claim parish relief or magisterial interference, till their grievances were redressed. At the expi- ration ofthe bonds on April 5, the owners were said to have agreed that the boys should work no more than 12 hours a day, and that the men should have their wages in money, and be allowed to buy goods where they pleased ; but the men continued to insist on other conditions. Not being met by the owners, they resolved not to return to work ; and parties of military were placed in readiness to assist in keeping the peace. In the course of the month, large bodies of pitmen visited several collieries at Bedlington, Blyth, Jesmond, and on the AVear, where they injured the machinery, and compelled the men at work to desist. On May 5, a meeting of pitmen was met at the Black Fell, near Chester-le-Street, by the Marquis of Londonderry, ac- companied by a military escort. He promised to meet their delegates at Newcastle, and they dispersed ; but no agreement ensued. The want of coals now began to be seriously felt, and many of the pitmen wandered about Durham and Northumberland begging. On May 16 and 17, outrages were committed at the collieries of South Shields and Hebburn. About the middle of June, the pitmen generally returned to their labours. On August 13, 1831, a meeting of about 10,000 or 12,000 pitmen assembled at Boldon FeU, for the pur- pose of getting up an address of thanks to his majesty for his support of the Reform Bill, and which was sent off on the 25th, after having received 11,561 signatures from the workmen employed at 57 collieries. The vol. i. 2 e"], [118, "GEOGRAPHICAL AND After the coals are raised from the mines to the surface by means of steam-engines, they are put into waggons, the shape of which is that of an inverted prismoid, each holding by statute a chal dron of coals of 53 cwt. ; the waggon itself generally weighing 21 cwt. They are mostly made of wood, though some are now made of sheet iron. Many of the collieries are situated at a consider able distance from the rivers, with which they communicate by railways. The way-leave rents amount, in some cases, to oP500 a year. The waggons were all formerly drawn by horses ; but various mechanical contrivances, such as inclined planes and fixed and locomotive engines, have lately been introduced for facilitating their transit along the railways. AVhen a waggon has ar rived at the staith, or loading place, a hasp which fastens the bottom of the waggon is withdrawn, and the coals are thus dropped into a spout which conducts them into the hold of the ship or keel. In some places, the waggon itself is lowered, by means of machinery, to a level with the deck of owners of Waldridge coUiery having employed lead-miners to work it, upwards of 1000 pitmen riotously as sembled on December 24; and, though from 20 to 30 men were down the pit, they stopped the engine for pumping out the water, and threw tubs, corves, &c. down the shaft, until dispersed by a body of military. Six of the rioters were tried, and sentenced to various terms of imprisonment. A general meeting of pitmen was held on Boldon Fell, on March 3, 1832, for the purpose of consolidating their \" Union ;\" and a similar meeting was held at the Black Fell on April 14. Their principal complaints were against the illegal size of the corves, by which their work was measured. As they refused to be rebound, those at Hetton, with their families, were ejected from their houses ; on which occasion, one of them, who had consented to go to work, was murdered. A riot also occurred on May 1, at Tyne Main and Friars Goose collieries, in consequence of a similar ejectment ;. when fire-arms were used both by the police and the colliers, and several were severely wounded. At other places the pitmen allowed themselves to be peaceably turned out of their dwellings ; and numerous families, with their furniture, were for weeks encamped by the road sides and in fields. They held a meeting on May 26, at Boldon FeU ; but no signs of reconciUation with their employers were evinced. In the afternoon of June 11, Nicholas Fairies, Esq., a magistrate of South Shields, who was considered ta have been peculiarly active during the strike, was met near Jarrow colliery by two pitman, who, under pre tence of asking charity, pulled him off his horse, and kicked and beat him to death. An affray took place at Chirton, near North Shields, on the evening of July 8, between some pitmen and special constables; when Cuthbert Skipsey, a pitman, was shot. The policeman who fired the gun was afterwards tried for man slaughter, and sentenced to six months imprisonment and hard labour. At the assizes, August 1, AVilliam Jobling was tried at Durham for the murder of Nicholas Fairies, Esq., and found guilty. He was executed on the 3d, and was afterwards hung in chains at Jarrow Slake, being the first person gibbeted under the new act of parliament, by which the bodies of murderers are ordered to be thus exposed. This disgusting exhi bition, however, did not long continue ; for, during the dark night between the 31st of August and the 1st of September, Jobling's body was stolen from the gibbet and secretly disposed of by some persons unknown. Another meeting had been held on Boldon Fell on June 16; but mutual concessions at length produced a reconciliation ; ancl, in the latter end of September, the greater part of the pitmen returned to their em ployment, and the Union was dissolved. The long continuance of this strike proved highly detrimental to the trade of the two rivers ; and the tradesmen of Newcastle, Sunderland, &c. suffered materially from the want of the money kept in circulation by the pitmen whilst in employment. A recent writer observes, \" Not only did the coal-owners lose as many thousand pounds as would have supported their men in comfort through many a month that they spent in want, but every week that the quarrel was spun out gave more occasion and more opportunity to brino- miners from a distance to do the pitmen's work. Such new people were brought from the lead-mines ; and they are now sharing the wages that the pitmen might have had to themselves.\" It is but justice to the colliers to observe, that their public meetings were conducted with the greatest decorum, and that they generally dis approved of the outrages which some of their body committed. The writer just quoted, however, o*ives the following account of law expenses, purporting to be extracted from a secret book belonging to the Union, and from which it appears that the guilty were defended at the expense of their innocent neighbours : \u2014 Mount Moor prisoners, \u00a32, 8s.; Gosforth prisoners, \u00a33, 12s-; Tanfield prisoners' trials, \u00a39, 16s.; Waldridge men prisoners, \u00a326, 15s. ; Hetton trial, \u00a366, Ils ; for the spring trial, \u00a34, 13s. ; total, \u00a31 13, 15s. The pitmen defend their Union by the example of that of their employers, and argue that they have as much right to refrain from working, as the latter have to restrict the sale of their coals. An attempt to revive the Union during the present year (1834) does not appear likely to succeed."], [119, "STATISTICAL DESCRIPTION. CXI the ship, and the coals are dropped directly into the hold. Keels are strong vessels, of eight chal drons of lading, used for conveying coals from such staiths as are at a distance from the sea to the ships. The usual method is to cast, or shovel, the coals from the keels into the port-holes of the ships ; but several of the keels on the AVear have of late years been loaded with tubs, or boxes, containing the coals, and which are raised by machinery, and emptied into the holds of the vessels. The shipment of coals coastwise is not subject to the general regulations which affect other goods : it is free from restraint, and there is no especial check or revision on the part of the Customs ; and the shipment (more from custom than by any express authority to that effect) is permitted to pro ceed either by day or night. The coal-fitter's certificate is the only document required as a speci fication of the cargo. The shipment of coal in the Tyne is at present regulated by the act 5 Geo. IV. c. 72, commonly called the Turn Act, by which all ships engaged in the trade of the port are loaded in the order which they arrive ; but this regulation is not observed in the AVear. The price of coal has always been extremely variable, depending on the state of the seasons, the wind, peace and war, combinations, and acts of fhe legislature. In 1395, the price per chaldron at Whitby Abbey was 3s. 4d. In 1512, at Alnwick Castle, it was 5s. The following table shews the price at London at various periods : \u2014 \u00a3. s. d. \u00a3. s. d. 1536 - 0 4 0 per chaldron. 1772 (Apr. 8) 4 4 0 per chaldron. 1550 - 0 12 0 per load.

All coals imported into the Thames were formerly sold by measure. On this subject Dr. Hut ton states, that, \" If one coal, measuring exactly a cubic yard (nearly equal to five bolls), be broken into pieces of a moderate size, it will measure seven bolls and a half; if broken very small, it will measure nine bolls ,- which shows that the proportion of the weight to the measure depends upon the size of the coals ; therefore, accounting by weight is the most rational method.''' The shippers were well aware of this, and insisted upon the coal owners supplying them with large coal only ; ancl to such an extent was this principle carried, that all coal for the London market was screened, as it is technically termed, or passed over gratings, to separate the smaller pieces. The larger coals were afterwards broken in the hands of every intermediate dealer ; until at length, according to the evidence of Mr. Brandling, they were reduced, before they were purchased by the consumer, to a size inferior to that which they would have had unscreened. The loss occasioned by the pro cess of screening has been very great. The quantity of coal separated by it amounted in some cases from 20 to 25 per cent, of the whole; and the greater part of this residue, containing a por tion of the very best coals, is burned on the spot. The heaps destroy the crops around them; and large sums are paid for the damage they occasion to the ground. The sale of coal by weight, which has been recently adopted in London, will probably eradicate some of these evils. From the earliest times, coals have been subjected to heavy duties.* The numberless regula- * In 1421, there was a custom payable to the king of 2d. per chaldron on all coals sold to persons not franchised in the port of Newcastle; and about the year 1599, Queen Elizabeth demanded so large a sum"], [120, "GEOGRAPHICAL AND CXII tions which have from time to time been enacted respecting the trade in this prime necessary of life would require volumes to detail them. The recent reductions, and the final abolition of the duty on coals exported to foreign countries in British vessels, will probably be a substantial benefit to the country. The question as to the period when the exhaustion of the coal mines may be anticipated, has naturally attracted considerable attention ; and though all the calculations hitherto made on the subject are necessarily extremely vague, yet they are sufficient to shew that many centuries must elapse before posterity can feel any serious difficulties from a diminished supply of coal. Hugh Tavlor, Esq., colliery agent to the Duke of Northumberland, and a coal-owner, delivered the fol lowing calculations to the committee of the House of Lords in 1829 : \u2014 An Estimate of the Extent and Produce ofthe Durham and Northumberland Coal Fields.

This impost, which was laid exclusively on coals from the Tyne, continued in the Richmond family till the year 1799, when they sold it to government, for the sum of \u00a3400,000. In the following year, \"it produced \u00a326,889, 13s.; in 1810 \u00a342,153, 5s. 4d. ; in 1820, \u00a337,825, 13s- ; and in 1828, \u00a336,974, 12s. 3d. It has recently been abolished."], [121, "STATISTICAL DESCRIPTION. CXIII Mr. Buddie says, \" The calculation which I have made of the consumption of England and AVales is as follows: Manufactories, 3,500,000 London chaldrons; household consumption, 5,500,000; making 9,000,000 in all, consumed from inland collieries: the quantity sent coastwise, on both sides of the island, is 3,000,000 ; together 12,000,000 chaldrons.\" As a London chaldron is near 27 cwt., that quantity is equal to about 16,200,000 tons weight, which is a larger amount for the consumption of England and Wales alone than Mr. Taylor has given for the whole of Great Britain and a part of the consumption of Ireland. Dr. Buckland and Mr. Sedgwick, professors of geology at Oxford and Cambridge, both consider Mr. Taylor's statement exaggerated, as to the average thickness of workable coal in this district ; and Mr. Bakewell, in his \" Introduction to Geology,11 discusses the question, and calculates that this coal-field will not last above 360 years. These calculations, however, have reference only to the best qualities of coal, or such as can be raised at an expense sufficiently low to enable them to be sold at a remunerating price, in competition with other coals; and it appears to be clearly made out, that all those parts of the country which are now supplied with fuel from the Durham and Northumberland mines will continue to enjoy that advantage for the next 400 years. Mr. Bake well calculates that the coal-beds in South AArales are sufficient to supply the present demand of England for coal for 2000 years ; but Mr. Conybeare's calculation extends only to 760 years. The latter gentleman, however, considers the whole of the workable or good coal in England adequate to a supply for 3000 years to come. It is, therefore, quite idle either to prohibit, or impose heavy duties on, the exportation of coal, on the ground of its accelerating the exhaustion of the mines. The abolition of the expensive and destructive process of screening will more than balance any ex port that is ever likely to take place to foreign countries.* The other articles of commerce, besides coal, which are imported to or exported from the county of Durham, are noticed under the heads of South Shields, Sunderland, Stockton, &c.

The increased and increasing facilities of communication between distant places, and the conse quent amalgamation of various classes and characters of people, have obliterated, especially in large towns, many of the local peculiarities formerly visible in this, as well as in most other dis tricts of the British empire. The general taste for reading has also induced a similarity of thought and sentiment, and an abandonment of local superstitions and prejudices, amongst all classes; and the inhabitants of the metropolis and of the most distant counties now reason on general subjects with the same views and with the like results. The gentry ofthe county of Durham are generally liberal, frank, hospitable, and polite. The most striking characteristic of many of this class is a laudable zeal for the investigation and eluci dation of the history and antiquities of their own district. The talents and the labours of the late Robert Surtees, Esq., in particular, have given an impetus to this predilection which will probably lead to highly interesting consequences. (See The Surtees Society.) The merchants, manufac turers, and principal traders, as well as the owners and directors of the extensive and numerous coal and lead-mines, have been characterized as men of great circumspection, but of comprehensive minds and ardent enterprize. The mechanics and workmen in large towns are generally well in formed, honest, and industrious. The farmers are rapidly imbibing the liberal views and opinions prevalent in other classes of society ; and many of them are distinguished by their professional skill. The agricultural and other viUage labourers are a hardy ancl industrious race, retaining much of the simplicity and independence of the class to which they belong. Pitmen. \u2014 The pitmen or colliers are a race entirely distinct from the other labouring classes by whom they are surrounded. The following vivid description of this numerous caste of industrious men appeared in a late respectable periodical : \u2014 \" They reside in long rows of one-storied houses, called by themselves ' pit-rows,1 built near the chief entrance to the mine. To each house is at tached a small garden, ' for ornament or use,1 and wherein they pay so much attention to the cul tivation of flowers, that they frequently bear away prizes at floral exhibitions. Within the memory of the writer, (and his locks are not yet ' silver'd o'er with age,1) the pitmen were a rude, bold, savage set of beings, apparently cut oft' from their fellow men in their interests and feelings ; often o-uilty of outrage in their moments of ebrious mirth ; not from dishonest motives, or hopes of plunder, but from recklessness, and lack of that civilization which binds the wide and ramified so ciety of a great city. From the age of five or six years, their children are immersed in the dark abyss of their lower worlds; and when even they enjoy the 'light ofthe blessed sun,1 it is only in the company of their immediate relations : all have the same vocation, and all stand out, a sturdy band, separate and apart from the motley mixture of general humanity. \u2022\u2022'The pitmen have the air of a primitive race. They marry almost constantly with their own people ; their boys follow the occupations of their sires \u2014 their daughters, at the age of blooming and modest maidenhood, linking their fate to some honest ' neebors bairn .-1 thus, from generation to generation, family has united with family, till their population has become a dense mass of rela tionship, like the clans of our northern friends, ' ayont the Cheviot's range.1 The dress of one of them is that of the whole people. Imagine a man, of only middling stature, (few are tall or robust,) with several large blue marks, occasioned by cuts, impregnated with coal-dust, on a pale ancl swarthy countenance, a coloured handkerchief around his neck, a ' posied waistcoat1 opened at the breast, to display a striped shirt beneath, a short blue jacket, somewhat like, but rather shorter than the jackets of our seamen, velvet breeches, invariably unbuttoned and untied at the knee, on"], [123, "STATISTICAL DESCRIPTION. CXV the 'tapering calf1 a blue worsted stocking, with white clocks, and finished downwards by a long, low-quartered shoe, and you have a pitman before you, equipped for his Saturday's cruize to ' canny Newcastle,1 or for his sabbath's gayest holiday. \"On a Saturday evening you will see a long line of road, leading to the nearest large market town, grouped every where with pitmen ancl their wives or ' lasses,1 laden with large baskets of the ' stomach's comforts,1 sufficient for a fortnight's consumption. They only are paid for their labour at such intervals; ancl their weeks are divided into what they term 'pay week,1 and 'bauf week,1 (the etymology of ' bauf,1 I leave thee, my kind reader, to find out). All merry and happy \u2014 trudging home with their spoils \u2014 not unfrequently the thrifty husband is seen 'half seas over,1 wrestling his onward way with an obstinate little pig, to whose hind leg is attached a string, as se- curity for allegiance, while ever and anon this third in the number of ' obstinate graces,1 seeks a sly opportunity of evading its unsteady guide and effecting a retreat over the road, ancl ' Geordie1 (a common name among them) attempts a masterly retrogade reel to regain his fugitive. A long cart, lent by the owners of the colliery for the purpose, is sometimes filled with the women and their marketings, jogging homeward at a smart pace ; ancl from these every wayfarer receives a shower of taunting coarse jokes, ancl the air is filled with loud, rude merriment. Pitmen do not consider it any deviation from propriety for their wives to accompany them to the alehouses of the market town, and join their husbands in their glass and pint. I have been amused by peeping through the open window of a pothouse, to see parties of them, men and women, sitting round a large sa- lable, talking, laughing, smoking, and drinking con amove; ancl yet these poor women are never addicted to excessive drinking. The men, however, are not particularly abstemious when their hearts are exhilirated with the bustle of a town. \" When the pitman is about to descend to the cavern of his labour, he is dressed in a checked flannel jacket, waistcoat, and trowsers, with a bottle or canteen slung across his shoulders, and a satchell or haversack at his side, to hold provendei for his support during his subterrene sojourn. At all hours, night and day, groups of men and boys are seen dressed in this fashion wending their way to their colliery, some carrying Sir Humphrey Davy's (called by them ' Davy's\") safety-lamp, ready trimmed, ancl brightened for use. They descend the pit by means of a basket or 'corse,1 or merely by swinging themselves on to a chain, suspended at the extreme end of the cordage, ancl are let down, with inconceivable rapidity, by a steam-engine. Clean ancl orderly, they coolly precipi- tate themselves into a black, smoking, and bottomless-looking crater, where you would think it almost impossible human lungs could play, or blood dance through the heart. At nearly the same moment you see others coming up, as jetty as the object of their search, drenched and tired. I have stood in a dark night, near the mouth of a pit, lighted by a suspended grate, filled with flar- ing coals, casting an unsteady but fierce reflection on the surrounding swarthy countenances ; the pit emitting a smoke as dense as the chimney of a steam-engine ; the men, with their sooty and grimed faces, glancing about their sparkling eyes, while the talking motion of their red lips dis- closed rows of ivory; the steam-engines clanking and crashing, and the hissing from the huge boilers, making a din, only broken by the loud, mournful, and musical cry of the man stationed at the top of the pit ' shaft,1 calling down to his companions in labour at the bottom. This, altoge ther, is a scene as wild and fearful as a painter or a poet could wish to see. \" All have heard of the dreadful accidents in coal-mines from explosions of fire-damp, inunda tions, &c, yet few have witnessed the heart-rending scenes of domestic calamity* which are the * Mr. Buddie being asked, in the course of his evidence before the committee of the House of Lords, \" AVhen these accidents occur, and great loss of lives is experienced, what becomes of the relations aud chil-"], [124, "GEOGRAPHICAL AND CXVI consequence. Aged fathers, sons, and sons1 sons, a wide branching family, all are sometimes swept away by a fell blast, more sudden, and, if possible, more terrible, than the deadly sirocco of the desert. \" Amidst all their dangers, the pitmen are a cheerful, industrious race of men. They were a few years ago much addicted to gambling, cock-fighting, horse-racing, &c. Their spare hours are di verted now to a widely different channel : they are for the most part members of the AVesleyan sects; and, not unfrequently in passing their humble but neat dwellings, instead of brawls and fights you hear a peaceful congregation of worshippers uttering their simple prayers, or the loud hymn of praise breaking the silence of the eventide.11 The influence of those men who had assumed the office of local preachers was strikingly exem plified during the late contests between tlie pitmen and their employers. Under the guidance of these leaders, thousands of the colliers were marched to and from their places of meeting, and mar shalled with the most perfect discipline. Their speeches, exciting the men to union, perseverance, and order, produced a powerful effect on the minds of their hearers ; their arguments being fre quently backed with devotional sentiments and appropriate texts of holy writ. Their chapels were generally used as asylums for the families of those ejected from their cottages. It is still the practice, though less in repute than formerly, during the Christmas holidays, for companies of pitmen and other workmen from the neighbouring collieries to visit Sunderland, Dur ham, &c, to perform a sort of play or dance, accompanied by song and music. Their appearance is hailed by the children with great satisfaction, and they receive liberal contributions from the spectators. The dancers carry swords in their hands, which they wield in various ways during the performance, and are hence called sword-dancers. They are clad in white shirts or tunics, deco rated with a profusion of ribbands, of various colours, gathered from the wardrobes of their mis tresses and well-wishers. The captain generally wears a kind of faded uniform, with a large cocked hat ancl feather, for pre-eminent distinction ; and the buffoon, or \" Bessy,11 who acts as treasurer, ancl collects the cash in a tobacco-box, wears a hairy cap, with a fox^ brush dependent. There is an ancient song, or dialogue in rhyme, peculiar to this diversion, in which the performers assume different characters, a quarrel ensues, one of the company is killed, and a doctor revives him. The music is simple, ancl not devoid of harmony ; but its peculiar beauty depends, perhaps greatly, on the force of early associations.* dren of the persons that have so suffered in your different collieries?\" replied, \" There is no provision what ever for them, excepting parochial relief, and what arises out of the humanity of their employers, and which is carried to a great extent in a way which is not generally known. AVhen there is a catastrophe of this kind, there are not only a great many killed, but a great number wounded and disabled for life ; it always produces an immense number of cripples; they must be provided with some employment which they can manage ; many of them go to boys' work, what is called trapping, furnace-keeping, and a great many jobs that might be done by boys, if it was not for the sake of employing these cripples and disabled persons. Again, there are a great number of widows produced : it is not within my knowledge that any coal-owner ever disturbed a widow, after an accident of that sort, or put her out of her house ; they have their houses and fuel continued to them probably as long as they live; and it frequently happens that a widow is left (having lost not only her husband but three or four sons) with a single boy quite an infant almost, probably six, seven, or eight years of age, and that boy is generally indulged with some employment that he is put to, at advanced wages, in consideration of the loss of his family : so that the coal-owners, though their charity does not appear publicly, yet to a very great extent in the way of giving extra wages, or certain work to cripples, finding houses for widows, and so on, do charity to a much greater extent than they are even them selves aware of. Sometimes they (the sufferers) have been relieved by public subscriptions ; but there are individuals, such as the Marquis of Londonderry and Lord Durham, who do private charity besides; I mean in direct payments to widows and orphans.\" * Bishoprick Garland, p. 58.

CXVII The Keelmen employed on the rivers Tyne and AVear are a remarkably hardy, robust, ancl labo- rious class of men, and are distinguished for their great muscular strength. Their employment requires uncommon exertion, for they have to contend in their strong clumsy vessels with dangerous gales, dark nights, freshes in the rivers, and crowded harbours. Three men ancl a boy (called a Pee-dee) navigate each keel on the Tyne, and one man and a boy each of those on the AVear. On the former river, the keelmen cast or shovel the coals from the keels into the shipping; but on the latter, that operation is performed by casters or by machinery. The keelmen have been charac terised as prone to intemperance. Some of the young men on the Tyne delight in the salubrious exercise of boat-racing; while, on the AVear, keel-courses are not uncommon. The bodily exertion on these occasions is excessive, the bulky vessels being generally propelled during a course of three or four miles by one man in each. The seamen in the coal trade, and the pilots employed in con ducting ships in and out of the harbours, are noticed in the account of South Shields. Lead-miners. \u2014 The extremely hazardous and uncertain nature of the lead-miners1 employment has a powerful effect in forming their character. They work by what is often in other trades called piece-work, and their income depends entirely on the produce of the mines. This circumstance of the uncertainty of their gains, and the activity which hope inspires, keep their spirits in an agree- able agitation, render their minds lively and acute, and prevent that dulness which generally cha- racterizes other labourers. The miners are as much distinguished for an unbending spirit of independence as for intellectual activity and acquirements. They work in partnerships of four, six, or eight, ancl divide their wages equally amongst them. Uncontrolled by the mandates of a master or overseer, they rely solely upon their own judgment and experience, ancl often lighten their labour by amusing or instructive conversation.* Nor is it uncommon to hear them dispute on metaphysical and philological subjects, or on the various doctrines of political economy. The lead miners are in general a strong, healthy, and active body of men. Their food is plain and simple; but, though drunkenness is by no means a practice with them, they are ever ready to join in a fray. The Teesdale miners formerly used to consider it a good joke, on a market-day, to encounter and beat \" the poor silly weavers o1 Barney Castle.11 Their moral habits in private life, however, are now respectable, and they are particularly distinguished for the virtues of charity and hospitality. During the strikes of the colliers in 1831 and 1832, the London Lead Company and and probably the Gauls and Britons, danced with swords or spears at their entertainments. Brand supposes the dance at present used is made up of the gleaning of several obsolete customs followed on festive occasions. Our dancers observe one peculiarity: when the swords are formed into a figure, they lay them down upon the ground and dance round them. In some parts of Northumberland, this pageant is called the Fund or Fool Plough, and is commonly thought to celebrate the termination of the labours of the plough. Hutchin- son says, \" Others, in the same kind of gay attire, draw about a plough, called the Stot (i. e. the Steer) Plough, and when they receive the gift, make the exclamation Largess! but if not requited at any house for their appearance, they draw the plough through the pavement, and raise the ground of the front in furrows. I have seen twenty men in the yoke of one plough.\" In some ofthe central and southern counties of Eng- land, this procession is practised on Twelfth Day, being the first day after Christmas that husbandmen re- sumed the plough. Bloomfield's Historv of Norfolk tends to clear the origin of the custom : \u2014 Anciently, a light called the Plough-light was maintained by old and young persons who were husbandmen, before images in some churches, and on Plough Monday they had a feast, and went about with a plough and dancers to get money to support the Plough-light. The Reformation put out these lights ; but the practice of going about with the plough begging for money remains, and the \" money for light\" increases the income of the village alehouse. * Mr. Sopwith gives the following example, spoken bv a miner, as a specimen of dialect and humour : \u2014 \" An folk wad nobbit let folk like folk as weel as folk wad like to like folk, folk wad like folk as weel as folk ever liked folk sin' folk was folk.\" vol. I. 2 g"], [126, "GEOGRAPHICAL AND CXVIII other mine proprietors were applied to by the coal-owners, to permit such of their workmen as could be spared to work in the coal-pits. Though the lead trade at that time was very dull, and employment in the mines consequently scarce, yet most of the miners expressed a strong dislike to beino- removed from their homes, even though tempted by the prospect of a better reward for their labour; and many of them seized the first opportunity of returning to their native fells* Hunting and shooting are their favourite diversions. Accompanied by their well-trained dogs, they frequently sport with undiminished eagerness upon their rugged mountains and dreary moors for three or four days together. As they generally undertake these desperate expeditions in large parties, they defy the power and contemn the threats of the legal conservators of the game. Miners are often to be met with, deeply embued with moral and religious sentiment, who yet cannot be convinced that the birds which fly over their heads can be the property of any one except of the man who shoots or catches them. He would indeed be a wonderful reasoner who could convince this people of the sin of poaching, ancl the justice, wisdom, and policy of our game laws. The miners adhere strictly to the ancient mode of keeping the Christmas, Easter, AVhitsuntide, and other holidays. At funerals it is usual to carry out the dead with singing of psalms ancl hymns of triumph. The company consists of both sexes ; ancl if the chief mourner be a daughter or mo ther, she is supported by two female friends, and followed by a mournful group of weeping females. Before the funeral service is read, the relations of the deceased let down the corpse into the grave ; the chief mourner standing at the head, and the rest of the relations arranged according to their propinquity.-f\" Many of tlie customs and superstitions observed in the county of Durham are sinking into dis use ; though there are some which still retain their ground. It is the practice for friends to visit each other's houses on the morning of New-year's day, to be the first foot, and to wish \" a happy new year;'1 and the lucky or unlucky events of the succeeding twelve months are frequently attri buted to the influence of this primary visitor. It is considered as extremely unlucky for a female to be a. first foot, or for any person to enter a house on such occasions without bringing bread or spirits with them. At Hartlepool, an anchor is dragged through the streets on Twelfth Day, in imitation of the Fool Plough of husbandmen. It is still customary in many places to observe Col lop Monday ; a practice retained since Catholic times, when this was the last day of flesh-eating before Lent. The following day, Shrove Tuesday, is here called Pancake Tuesday, from the cus tom of dining on pancakes on that day, which is also celebrated at Sedgefield and other places with games of foot-ball. The first Sunday in Lent has no name; but the other six are designated by the following couplet : \u2014 * \"The farms in High Teesdale,\" says stir. Sopwith, \"are chiefly occupied by miners; and however rustic the outside of their dwellings, the interior not unfrequently presents an admirable specimen of neatness, cleanliness, and order. The strength and activity of the hardy race of men who inhabit them are often equalled by kindness of disposition ; and no one who has experienced their civilities can readily forget them, or attribute them to any other source than a well-meaning mind. As to women, as Ledyard says, they every where are kind and attentive. In this district they are remarkably so- If it be pleasing to contemplate ex cellence in works of fiction, it is still more refreshing and instructive to witness it in real life. A comely matron presiding in a humble but clean and neat abode, \u2014 the mother of blooming and athletic children, a form and countenance retaining much ofthe grace and vivacity of youth,\u2014 a ready smile at once bespeaking a hospitable welcome and a cheerful mind, \u2014 manners free from awkwardness on the one hand, and from for\" wardness on the other, and apparently regulated by the influence of real kindness and genuine good sense.

CXIX \"Tid, Mid, Misera, Carling, Palm, Paste Egg day.\" The first line is supposed to have been formed from the beginning of psalms, &c, viz. 7'ec.eum, Mi deus, Miserere mei. On Carling Sunday (in some parts of England called Care Sunday) it is almost an universal custom in this county to eat pease, then called curlings, which have been steeped a night in water, and afterwards fried.* Palm Sunday derives its name from the well known custom of the Catholic church. Paste (or paschal) eggs, boiled hard ancl dyed of various colours, are given as presents on Easter Sunday, -j- On this day, it is usual in some parts of the county for men or boys to -take off' the shoes of every woman they meet, and to keep them till re deemed by some small donation ; ancl on Easter Monday the women are allowed to make similar reprisals on the men. The custom, formerly very common, of dancing round ancl jumping over bonfires on Midsummer eve, is now nearly laid aside ; as is the more important one of humble families clubbing at Martin mas to buy a cow or other animal, and which was hence called a mart. \" Harvest home11 is cele brated in this county by mell suppers,^ at which a kind of humble masquerade is practised, the company being dressed in various characters, ancl called guisers. Hoppings, or parish feasts, are observed at many places.\u00a7 Most families provide a yule cake at Christmas, and the children are treated with yule doughs, or little images of paste with currants, supposed by Brand to be intended for a representation of the child Jesus with the ATirgin Mary. The practice of singing Christmas carols is nearly obsolete ; as is the custom of laying on the fire a large coal, or lump of wood, called a yule clog, on Christmas eve. It was usual, till of late years, for school-boys to bar out the mas ter at Christmas, when they barricaded the door of the school within, and refused admission to their enraged teacher till he had consented to allow them a specified term of holiday. The first time an infant is taken to visit a neighbour or relation, it is regularly presented with three things ; salt, bread, and an egg. The belief in \" bad prayers,11 ghosts, witches, fairies, and * It is noted in an old calendar, that on this day \" a dole is made of soft beans,\" which was also \" a rite in the funeral ceremonies of heathen Rome.\" The present practice, however, is derived by some from the dis ciples plucking the ears of corn and rubbing them in their hands ; and by others it is supposed to commemo rate the manna which the Israelites ate in the wilderness. t The ancient Christians are supposed to have used eggs as an emblem of the resurrection. + Brand derived mell supper from the French word meslcr, to mingle or mix together; but Pegge de duced it from the Teutonic word mehl, farina or meal. Hutchinson says it is so called from the ancient sa crifice of mingling the new meal. Eugene Aram adopted the same interpretation, though he imagined it might be derived from a mell wherewith corn was anciently reduced to meal in a mortar. Aram also asserts that kern supper does not mean corn supper, but churn supper, because from time immemorial, it was cus tomary to produce in a churn a great quantity of cream, and to circulate it in cups. Cream has now been commuted for ale- This extraordinary but unhappy man says, that the mell supper was provided when all was shorn, and the churn supper after all was got in. \u2014 View of Northumberland, vol. i. page 219- \u00a7 The origin of country feasts or wakes, which are usually observed on the Sunday next after the saint day to whom the parish church is dedicated, is ascribed to a letter written by St. Gregory the Great to Me litus Abbot (who was sent into England with St Augustin) in these words: \u2014 \"It may therefore be per mitted them (viz. the English), that on the dedication day, or other solemn days of martyrs, they make themselves bowers about their churches, and refreshing themselves and feasting together after a good religious sort, kill their oxen now to the praise of God and increase of charity, which before they were wont to .sacri fice to the devil,\" &c. \u2014 Bede's Eccl. Hist. cap. 30. They were called wakes, because on the vigils of those feasts the people were wont to awake from sleep at the several vigils of the night and go to prayers. Sub sequently, fairs were held in the church-yards on such occasions, accompanied by feasting and all sorts of rural sports and exercises, which sometimes continued two or three days-"], [128, "GEOGRAPHICAL AND CXX their whole train of frightful and pleasing associations, is gradually dying away. Sir C. Sharp says that, at Hartlepool '\u2022 Waffs are still common, and few people die before their neighbours have seen their waff ' glide softly by.1 Indeed, some persons have seen their own ' waffs,1 and under the conviction that their own death is thereby predicted, have seldom recovered from the impression of the apparition.11 The cracking of furniture is thought by many to be ominous of death ; and a belief in dreams is still prevalent. It is considered very unlucky for a pig to cross the path before a person walking; and the nocturnal howling of a dog would, a few years ago, have struck terror into the hearts of a whole neighbourhood. Some of the most popular legends and superstitions peculiar to the countv of Durham are detailed in the accounts of Lambton Castle, Hilton Cas tle, Eppleton, Sockburn, Thickley-Punchardox, Cornforth, &c* * The Picktree Brag was a mischievous goblin, the existence of which was recently firmly believed in by many ofthe inhabitants ofthe parish of Chester-le-Street. The erudite editor ofthe Bishoprick Garland (who has inadvertently styled it the Pelton Brag) gives the following account of this singular being verbatim from the deposition of an old woman of respectable appearance, of about 90 years of age, living near the spot : \u2014 \" She said, I never saw the Brag very distinctly, but I frequently heard it. It sometimes appeared like a calf, with a white handkerchief about its neck, and a bushy tail. It came also like a galloway, but more often like a coach horse, and went trotting along the 'lonin, afore folks, settin up a great nicker and a whin ney every now and then ;' and it came frequently like a ' dickass,' and it always stopped at the pond at the four ' lonin ends, and nickered and whinnied.' My brother once saw it like four men holding up a white sheet. I was then sure that some near relation was going to die; which was true- My husband once saw it in the image of a naked man without a head. I knew a man of the name of Bewick that was so fright ened that he hanged himself ' for fear on't.' AVhenever the midwife was sent for, it always came up with her in the shape of a 'galloway.' Dr. Harrison wouldn't believe in it; but he met it one night as he was going home, and it 'maist' killed him; but he never would tell what happened, and didn't like to talk about it; and whenever the Brag was mentioned, he sat ' trimilin and shakin' by the fireside. My uncle had a white suit of clothes, and the first time he ever put them on he met the Brag, and he never had them on afterwards but he met with some misfortune ; and once when he met the Brag, and had his white suit on, (being a bold man) and having been at a christening, he was determined to get on the Brag's back ; but when he com to the four 'lonin ends,' the Brag 'joggled him so sore,' that he could hardly keep his seat, and at last it threw him off into the middle ofthe pond, and then ran away, setting up a great nicker and laugh, just ' for all the world like a christian.' But this I know to be true of my own knowledge, that when my father was dying, the Brag was heard coming up the lonin like a coach and six, and it stood before the house, and the room ' shaked,' and it gave a terrible yell when my father died, and then it went clattering and gallopin down the lonin, as if ' yeben and yerth was coming together.'\" The Bedlington Tragedy was occasioned by a fair lady of that place, with great store of wealth, having fallen in love with a \" famous youth,\" whose personal worth was all his riches, and in consequence of which her parents send her to an uncle at Stokesley A few days after her departure, this young man \"sickened sore, ancl heart-broke died.\" After his death, the parents make every preparation to bring her home to a rich lover of their own choice ; but the ghost of \" young James\" anticipates their intentions by taking the horse (which was saddled for the use of the father) from the stable, and, assuming his earthly appearance, arrives at the uncle's with an order to convey her home, who assists her to mount behind. Having \" travel led faster than the wind,\" in two hours \" he sets her at her father's door,\" and then leaves her for the pur pose of putting the horse into the stable, but is never more seen. On hearing of the death of her lover she sickens, takes to her bed, dies, and is buried in the same grave. \u2014 Sykes's Local Records.

CXXI The Surtees Society. It was originally in contemplation, by the friends of the late Robert Surtees, Esq., the historian of the county, to erect a monument to his memory ; but they subsequently determined to combine \"a permanency more durable than brass or marble with a purpose of great public utility,11 by es- tablishing a literary institution, to be called \"The Surtees Society,11 in honour of that distin- guished and enlightened antiquary, and in accordance with his pursuits and plans, \" to have for its object the publication of inedited manuscripts, illustrative of the intellectual, the moral, the religious, ancl the social condition of those parts of England and Scotland, included on the east between the Humber and the Frith of Forth, and on the west between the Mersey and the Clyde, a region which constituted the ancient kingdom of Northumberland.11 At a meeting held at the Queen's Head Inn, Durham, on May 27, 1834, John Ralph Fenwick, Esq., M.

HIS interesting district is divided from Northumberland on the north and west by the Tyne, Darwent, Milkwell-burn, and a short imaginary line. Another imaginary line and the Derness divide it from Darlington Ward on the south-west. The Wear forms the south and south- eastern boundary, and the German Ocean its eastern. Its greatest length from east to west is 35 mUes, and its breadth from north to south is 16 miles; but it runs up to a narrow point at its western extremity, and is not more than six miles across on the sea coast. It contains 89,600 acres, of which, according to Bailey, 27,520 acres were, in 1810, uninclosed heathy moors, mostly situated in the western and mountainous parts of the district. But the quantity of uncultivated land has been much lessened since that time, and is now of trifling extent. This ward is well watered by the rivers Tyne, Wear, Darwent, Team, Derness, Browney, and their tributary streams. The aspect of the country is various ; but the greater part is highly cultivated, productive, and populous. It abounds in lead, coal, lime, and excellent stone ; and the banks of the rivers are crowded with extensive and important manufacto, ries.

HIS parish, including the chapelry of Heworth, is bounded by the Tyne oil the north, by the chapelry of St. Hilda on the east, by Whitburn on the south- east, by Boldon and Washington on the south, and by Washington and Gateshead on the west.* The townships of Jarrow, Monkton, and Hedworth with Hebburn, now form one joint township, under the parish church. The townships of Upper and Nether Heworth are also united under the chapel of ease at Heworth. In 1821, Jarrow contained 607 houses and 3530 persons; and in 1829, the estimated value of the lands and buildings assessed to the county-rate was _P12,699- At the same time, Heworth chapelry contained 729 houses and 3921 persons, and its estimated value in 1829 was _\u00a3T0,208. Jarrow is derived from the Saxon Gyrwy, or Gyrvy, meaning a fen or marsh,-f- and refers to the extensive pool now called Jarrow Slake. This ruined haven is about half a mile in breadth, nearly a mile in length, and covers about 460 acres of ground. Though half filled by deposits of sand ancl soil, it still receives the water of Tyne at flood, and is left so dry at ebb as to admit the passage of carriages round its whole extremity. The Hedworth brook, called by Leland the Done, which rises in the Boldon hills, runs through the Slake towards the Tyne in a serpentine direction. It is thought to have been a considerable water formerly, before its feeders were drained off by the adjoining collieries. The royal navy of the Saxon King Egfrid is said to have rode at anchor in Jarrow harbour. The passage from Jarrow to the opposite shore is formed by a raised causeway, and a narrow bridge over the Done rivulet. Hutchinson says that this road is still \"a formidable work.\" In 1389, Bishop Skirlaw built or repaired the bridge; and Grose mentions a column at the south end, which has probably been a cross. The Slake might easily be embanked against the encroachments of the tide ; but this has always been opposed, on the ground that it forms an useful scouring bason to the harbour of Shields. Mr. Rennie pro posed to make, across the entrance of the Slake, a kind of flat facing of rubble stone, to admit the tide passing over, and to prevent the sand from being carried out upon the ebbing of the tide. The royalties on the north-west of the Slake belong to the improprietors of Jarrow, and on the south east side to the dean and chapter of Durham. Jarrow claims the honour of having been a Roman station, fort, or village. This was ascer tained from two Roman inscriptions found during the rebuilding of the church in 1 783. The one * AArallsend parish, in Northumberland, was anciently part of the rectory of Jarrow ; but the connexion has long been entirely dissolves!, and it pays no acknowledgment to the mother church. t Camden says the inhabitants of the Lincolnshire fens are called Gyrvii, that is, Fen-men ; and Ben tham (Hist, of Ely) informs us, that what is now the isle of Ely was 'anciently called Suth-Girwa. \"In the old English or British language, the Y, W, and G, are used interchangeably for each other, as in Yule, Wyl, and Gwyl, all three being but one and the same word, signifying the same thing, though -differently written.\" \u2014 Archaeolog. vol. ii. p. 63."], [133, "JARROAV. 3 \u2022 MPCvsls annexed is a military trophy, such as \\vere usually placed on the front of tem- fcHOvmc pies or other public buildings, ancl which Brand reads thus: \u2014 Diffttsis Provin- britanna...ad... ciis in Britannia ad utrumque ostium e.vereitus posuit f i. e.

Chirton, a short distance west from Tynemouth, is sup posed to have been a Roman station ; ancl certainly a post at Jarrow was much more necessary to the defence of the sea-flank ; particularly if, as some persons imagine, the Tyne had an outlet which branched off\" from the Dean Bridge, close by Jarrow, and ran past Biddic Barns, ancl from thence east of Lay Gate until it joined the sea on the south side of the Law, at the eastern extremity of South Shields, where the ground is still low and marshy, and not unlike the old estuary of a small river. If this was really the case, a station at Jarrow would appear to have been indispensible. However this may be, it is judiciously remarked by Surtees, that the Romans exported vast quan tities of grain from Britain, and that an establishment at the western head of the Slake might be requisite to secure the lading and navigation. But the proof of Jarrow having been a Roman post does not rest entirely upon these ancient monuments ; for, when the road was altered north of Jarrow row, two square pavements of Roman brick were discovered ; and the whole scite of the church ancl monastry abounds in foundations of Roman masonry. A silver coin of Aulus Vitellius was also found near the south-west angle of the cemetery ; and much of the structure both of the church ancl monastry consist of Roman ashlar stones. Some antiquarians have suspected that the very ancient fragment of a wall, a little beyond the north-east angle of the church-yard, is a portion of the defences of the Roman station or fort that stood here. Brand has given the drawing of a mutilated sculptured stone that was found here, and which he suspected to be Roman workmanship. It represents an archer shooting at a stag. The Saxon history of Jarrow commences in the year 681 (235 years after the Romans had finally quitted Britain), when Benedict began to erect a monastry upon the scite of the Roman fort. The founder (whose original name was Biscopius) was a noble Saxon officer in the court of Oswy, king of Northumberland. Having been munificently rewarded for his military services, he relinquished the world at the age of twenty-five years ; and agreeably to tlie prevailing practice of zealous con- Verts to Christianity, he visited the holy see. Soon after his return to Britain, he again went to Rome, the king's son having been only prevented from accompanying him by his father's express injunctions to the contrary. Having resided two years in the convent of Lirina, at the isle of St. Honorat in France, he there received the clerical tonsure and the name of Benedict. In 669, he returned from his third pilgrimage, in the train of Theodore, archbishop elect of Canterbury, and was himself appointed abbot of St. Peter's, which he governed two years, ancl then, resigning his charge to Abbot Adrian, travelled to Rome a fourth time. Here he made large acquisitions, both by gift and purchase, of books ancl reliques ; and, on his return through A'ienna, was delighted to find all his treasures, which had been forwarded thither, safe in the custody of his friends. Re-"], [134, "CHESTER WARD\u2014 E. D. 4 turning to England with this valuable lading in 672, he first purposed to put himself under the protection of Koynwalk, king of the West Saxons ; but being prevented by the death of that pious prince, he returned to his native Northumberland ; and relating to Egfrid, who then held the sceptre, the whole eventful series of his pilgrimages, and displaying his abundant and invalua ble collection of books and reliques, he easily obtained a grant of land, with which he founded the monastry of St. Peter's, Wearmouth, on the north side of the river Wear, in 674. Seven years after the foundation of this house, King Egfrid gave to the Abbot Benedict a further grant of the scite ->f Jarrow monastry, with an endowment of 40 hides of land. This new edifice, which was consigned to the care of Ceolfrid as vice-abbot, was finished, and the church dedicated to St. Paul, the teacher of the Gentiles, on the ninth of the kalends of May, 685. It was consolidated with the monastry of Wearmouth, and the joint institutions were called the monastry of St. Peter ancl St. Paul. In 683, Benedict, after settling the monastic rule of his foundation, and committing the charge of its government to his vice-abbot, Easterwin, he, accompanied by Ceolfrid, undertook a fifth and final journey to Rome. In 684, Bede, the glory of his age and country, was admitted a scholar in Jarrow monastry,* On the 6th of March, 687, t^e Abbot Easterwin died of the plague in his * Bede, according to an ancient and probable tradition, was born of obscure parents in the small hamlet of Alonkton, nearly adjoining Jarrow. He himself states generally, that his birth-place was within the jurisdiction of St. Peter and St. Paul, that he entered the monastry at seven years of age (684), was or dained deacon at nineteen by John bishop of Hexham (696), and received the full order of priesthood from that prelate in his thirtieth year (707)- His whole life, from chddhood to age, was spent within his own monastry ; and all his time was devoted to study and devotion. In consequence of his unparalleled dili gence, comprehensive genius, and extensive learning, he was admired, consulted, and esteemed hy all his distinguished contemporaries. His fame even reached Rome, to which city, it is said, he was invited by Pope Sergius ; but Bede was not to be allured from his cell by the smiles of potentates and the courtesy of princes. He never accepted any preferment above the humble rank of a beneticed priest. His letter ad dressed to his intimate friend, the learned Egbert of York, is pregnant with excellent advice, the result of long experience, and at once evinces the purity of his morals and the liberality of his sentiments. Tie ap pears, indeed, to have possessed the rare association of learning with moderation, of devotion with liberality, and of high reputation in the church with voluntary and honourable poverty. The largest and most popular of Bede's works is his \" Ecclesiastical History of the Nation of the Angles,\" which, while it treats professedly of the establishment of Christianity in the different Saxon kingdoms, inci dentally contains all we know of the history of the more early princes. This work is the result of many years' labour \u2014 a labour scarcely conceivable by modern writers, in the amplitude and facilities they possess in acquiring information. Considering the knowledge of the age, it displays much penetration and good sense ; and though the Latin, in which language it is written, be frequently deficient in purity and ele gance, it is remarkable for ease and perspicuity. The last literary labour of Bede was \" a translation of the Gospel of St. John into the Saxon language,\" which he completed with difficulty on the day and hour of his*) death, which happened on the 26th of May, A. D. 735. The disorder of which he died was the asthma. He was an excellent musician ; and, during many sleepless nights, he sung praises to God. WiUiam of Alahnsbury, after giving Bede an extraordinary character, tells us tbat \" it was much more easy to admire him in thought than to do him justice in expression.\" Bale assures us that he had scarcely an equal in his age, and that he learned Natural Philosophy and the Alathematics from the purest sources, the Greek and Roman authors themselves. Pits says that Bede's writings were held in such respect and authority, that it was ordained by a council held in England, and approved afterwards by the Catholio Church, that they should be publicly read in the churches; and that his intense application furnished him with a complete knowledge of Poetry, Rhetoric, Natural PhUosophy, Aletaphysics, Astronomy, Arithmetic, Alusic, Geometry, Cosmography, Chronology, History, and the whole circle of the liberal arts. Lingard gays that he appears to have possessed whatever knowledge had survived the ruin of the Roman empire, Camden represents him as the singular light of our England. The learned Wharton also admires his ex-\u00bb tensive and profound knowledge ; and other writers acknowledge him to be the most laborious and ingenioua"], [135, "JARROAV. 5 thirty-first year. He had been a courtier, and was related to his superior Benedict, and so humble that he thought it not beneath his dignity to accompany his brethren at the plough, work at the anvil, winnow corn, milk the cows and sheep, and partake of other labours with them in the gar den, bakehouse, ancl kitchen. Such was the ancient simplicity of manners in the monastic life, and so far were the dignitaries of the infant church here from affecting pomp or state. Bede, however, hints that there were noble proselytes who did not always imitate, in their monastic recess, the virtues of the frank and good-tempered Easterwin. Benedict, on returning from his fifth Italian pilgrimage, found his shepherd dead, and his flock thinned by the ravages of pestilence. The surviving brethren had elected Sigfrid, a man of worth and learning. Jarrow now shared in the ornaments which had been collected by Benedict and Ceolfrid, and which had been so liberally bestowed on the elder monastry of AVearmouth. The church was decorated with paintings on religious subjects : Isaac carrying the wood for his own sacrifice, and next the Saviour bearing his cross ; the typical elevation of the brazen serpent in the wilderness, and the last solemn scene of the crucifixion. The church which received these valuable decorations had been built by French masons, after the Italian model; and the windows were glazed, which was a great novelty in this island,* person that this country ever produced. Surtees, in speaking of Bede, concludes thus : \u2014 \" The lamp of learning, trimmed by the hand of a single monastic, who never passed the limits of his Northumbrian pro- vince, irradiated from the cell of Jarrow the Saxon realm of England with a clear and steady light ; and when Bede died, History reversed her torch, and quenched it in deep night.\" Alany testimonies in his fa- vour may he found in the works of our historians and annaUsts, such as HoUingshed, Stowe, Speed, Selden, Sir Henry Spelman, Stillingfleet, and Alabillon. Bede was interred in a porch, or, more probably, a chantry, which was built to his honour on the north side of the church ; and in the eleventh century, a little stone mansion, in which he was wont to sit and meditate, and read and write, was shewn to those who came to visit the ruins. The three monks who then tenanted the place also exhibited his little arula, in the midst of which a piece of green serpentine was placed instead of a gem. Jarrow, the place of his burial, being much reverenced, was resorted to by reli- gious persons on the anniversary of his death. About the year 1020, Elfrid, a priest and a famous collector of the remains of saints, stole the body of Bede, and carried it to Durham, where it was honourably interred. Bede was called by contemporaries \" the learned Saxon ;\" and by posterity he is justly entitled the Venera- ble. Besides his five books of Ecclesiastical History, Bede wrote a very miscellaneous collection of versions and commentaries upon several books in the Old and New Testament ; also Legends and Theological Dis- sertations, and elementary compilations in various sciences, for the use of his scholars. The first general coUection of his works appeared at Paris in 1544, in 3 vols. sol. and again in 1544, at the same place, in 8 vols.; at Basil, in the same size and number of volumes, in 1563; reprinted at Cologne in 1612, and at the same place in 1688. Several parts of his works have been separately printed ; and those treatises which are mentioned in his own catalogue of his works were published by the learned and industrious AVharton in 1693, 4to. A complete edition was afterwards published at Cambridge in 1722, with notes and a large appendix, by Dr. John Smith, then a prebendary of Durham. The picture of Bede in a fine blue habit, in coloured glass, is preserved in the church of Durham Antiq. of Durham Abbey, p. 109. Cuthbert, a monk of Jarrow and the friend of Bede, wrote, and dedicated to his contemporary Cutherinus_ a book on the life and death of Bede, and another volume of familiar epistles. He flourished A. D. 740 Bale. * In the year 710, Naiton, king of the Picts, sent ambassadors to Ceolfrid, abbot of this house, desirinf his advice concerning the observation of Easter, and the mode of the tonsure ; requesting of him also to send architects into Scotland, to build a church of stone there, after the manner of the Romans, which he pro-> mised to dedicate to the Prince of the Apostles. Ceolfrid sent him in return a very lon\"' ietter of advice v and also architects for the above purpose, according to his desire. \u2014 Bede. VOL. I. C"], [136, "CHESTER AVARD.\u2014 E. D. 6 The last three years of Benedict's life were passed under the severe pressure of illness ; his lower limbs were paralyzed, and he lived only above. Anxious to have a worthy and efficient successor, when dying, he sent for Sigfrid, who was sinking under an incurable disorder of the lungs. The latter was brought in his truckle bed, and laid by the side of the paralytic abbot, the heads of both resting on one pillow. Sigfrid, who survived this colloquy only two months, was easily per suaded to resign an office which he could no longer execute ; and Ceolfrid, abbot of St. Paul's of Jarrow, was appointed to the government of the two united houses. The holy Benedict died on January 12th, 690. Ceolfrid remained abbot of AVearmouth and Jarrow during one and twenty years, and proved a most munificent benefactor to his house. On June 4, and when 74 years of age, he left AVearmouth, being determined on devoting the remaining portion of his life and strength to the exercises of religion in the sacred city of Rome. But age and infirmities oppressed him on the road ; and he expired in the monastry of the Trine Martyrs, near Langres, in France. Before Ceolfrid had left England, the monks in St. Peter's, Monkwearmouth, who, notwith standing the late ravages of pestilence, mustered 600 brethren, elected, with the consent of a few elders of the house of Jarrow, Hu\u00e6tbert to the government of both monastries. His appointment was confirmed by Acca, bishop of Hexham, to whose see these monastries belonged. Hu\u00e6tbert had been placed here at a very early period of his life, ancl, in the time of Pope Sergius, had visited Rome. He was very expert at writing, singing, reading, and teaching. He probably sur vived the Arenerable Bede, who addressed him in an epistle prefixed to his work De Temporibus. A long chasm follows the death of the Venerable Bede of Jarrow in 735, supplied only by some meagre annalists ; and the Saxon history of this place lies buried in darkness. The names of the abbots that succeeded Hu\u00e6tbert are unknown. In 7-38, the general of a party of Danes, who had entered King Egfrid's haven, was killed, whilst the barbarians were plundering Jarrow monastry. In 867, Jarrow was plundered and burnt by a fleet of Baltic pirates. After this destructive in road, it remained abandoned ancl desolate as a desert for upwards of two centuries ; nothing being left but the naked walls, amongst which, perhaps, some poor peasants might raise their humble huts. At length, Aldwin, a Mercian monk, with two associates, determined to visit the ruined kingdom of Northumberland, the early seat of monastic piety ancl learning. The wanderers first sat down at Monkchester (afterwards Newcastle) ; but Walcher, bishop of Durham, persuaded the distinguished strangers to remove under his jurisdiction, and assigned them the sacred spot of Jarrow for a residence. The whole is represented at this time (1074) as being in ruins; but the new possessors contrived to place a rude roof of logs and straw thatch upon the naked walls, and raised for themselves a few poor huts under shelter of the building.* Here their exemplary aus terity, abstinence, patience, ancl self-denial, attracted a vast influx of persons of all ranks ; and the delighted bishop gave them in frank possession Gyrwy, which it seems they at first held but as tenants at will, Preston, Monkton, Hedworth, Hebburn, Westoe, and Horton. Waltheof, Earl of Northumberland, gave them also the church of Tinmouth, with all its lands and possessions, toge ther with the body of St. Oswin. The house of Jarrow being thus so amply endowed, Aldwin * Jarrow monastry is said to have been re-edified, and again destroyed in the merciless raid of the Nor man Conqueror in 1070 ; but if it had been so recently demolished, Simeon could scarcely have stated so positively that it had lain in ruins for 208 years.

Recalled by AValcher, Aldwin revived the fire-scathed monastry of Wearmouth. In 1079, the monks of Jarrow sailed up the Tyne, and received on board their vessel the naked body of their patron, Bishop AATalcher, who had been murdered at Gateshead, and deposited his remains in their monastry, from whence they were afterwards removed and interred at Durham. But the independence of Jarrow monastry did not continue long; for, in 1083, William de Ka rilepli, bishop of Durham, removed the monks both from Jarrow and Wearmouth to Durham, and reduced both houses into cells dependant on the monastry of St. Cuthbert. This act was confirmed by charter from King William and King John. After this period, Jarrow was inhabited by only a few monks, governed by a superior, who bore the title of Master. In 1313, AVilliam, prior of Durham, retired to the cell of Jarrow. About 1323, Robert de Durham occurs as Master of Jarrow \u2014 Alexander de Lumley in 1333 \u2014 Joh. de Norton in 1353 \u2014 John Durham in 1437- In 1318, Jarrow church was valued at \u00a326, 13s. 4d. per annum.

The remains of the ancient monastry stand on the north-west edge of the Slake, upon an eleva tion which rises gently from the haven. Grose abuses the situation ; while Hutchinson thinks it tolerably comfortable. \"The spot,\" observes Surtees, \"has no claim to peculiar beauty; yet it is well calculated to produce a general impression of solemn quiet. The church ancl mouldering monastic walls on the green hill sloping to the bay, the long silvery expanse of water, the gentle ripple of the advancing tide, the sea-birds perpetually hoverh.g on the wing or dipping in the wave, and the distant view of Shields harbour, with its clouds of smoke and forests of masts, which alone break the total exclusion of ulterior objects, form no common combination. Even with a proper deduction for the pit-row which intervenes betwixt the ruin and the Slake, and still more for the brick house which bullies the falling cell on the north, Jarrow is a ' romancy spot,' where, as Anthony a Wood hath it, a man may admirably ' refresh' himself with a melancholy walk.\" The ruins of the monastry are so scattered and confused, that it is extremely difficult to form any conjecture as to their original appearance or destination. This difficulty is increased from the circumstance of a gentleman's mansion having risen on the scite of the monastry, as is mentioned by old Harrison, in his description of England, prefixed to Hollingshed, and published in 1587- From the style of Saxon architecture which may be traced in some parts of the ruins, it may be inferred that the building was not totally demolished during the irruption of the Danes, and also that its naked walls escaped the fury of the Conqueror. This conjecture is corroborated by the circumstance of the Mercian monks having found the buildings at Jarrow more perfect than at Monkchester, only three years after the enraged Normans had destroyed all the adjoining country. Hutchinson says, \" At the west end is a gable, in which there is a round arched window, composed of that species of architecture which prevailed in the Saxon time, and, we venture to allege, was antecedent to the devastation made by the Norman soldiers. The uppermost ornament is of the dental figure, succeeded below by zig-zags ; ancl the lowest member of the arch plain circular rolls,"], [140, "8 CHESTER WARD\u2014 E.

It was rebuilt in 1783, with the exception of the tower and part of the chancel, at the expense of \u00a3624, part of which was de frayed by the sale of the lead and old materials, and the rest by a subscription of \u00a3427, 13s. 6d. and a legacy of \u00a350 from the Rev. C. Ellison. Amongst the subscribers were, \u2014 Impropriators, \u00a360 ; dean and chapter, \u00a350 ; Henry Ellison, Esq. \u00a320 ; Lord Crewe's trustees, \u00a320 ; bishop of Durham, \u00a321 ; and the mayor ancl corporation of Newcastle, \u00a321. The tower rises from the cen tre, betwixt the nave and chancel, from two low round arches, with groined ribs intersecting each other. From its situation, it has been inferred that tlie church had once a transept. Several win dows in the chancel are closed up. The south side has two pointed lights, and the north side one square-headed window, divided into three lights. The most ancient part of the edifice is the tower, which has round-headed double lights on every side, resembling those of Monkwearmouth. On the north of the tower is a door and a small light, having the characteristics of Saxon architecture. The fragments of several Saxon pilasters, capitals, and bases, are preserved in the church ; ancl, no doubt, many fragments of ancient times perished in 1782. One venerable and interesting monument has, however, been preserved, and is now in the arch of the tower, between the chancel and the nave. It is mentioned by a Whitby Chronicler quoted by Leland, and, before p dedicatio basilicae the repairing of the church, was on a square through-stone, in the sci pavli viii kl mai north wall of the chancel.

The diameter of the bell is 29 inches, and its * Some cottages at Jarrow have been repaired with materials carried from the remains of the monastry.

An inscription, now said to be built up, with the legend inwards, in the east jamb of the south window next the west door, \"In hoc singularis anno vita reditur mundo,\" is supposed to aUude to the re foundation of the monastry by the Normans. Hutchinson also mentions a sepulchral monument, \"which had the figure of a burning taper with expanded wings ;\"-and, in the north jamb of a low porch, \" the figure of a crosier staff, stripped from some of the ancient tombs.\" Grose mentions an ancient cross in the same place, \" ornamented in the Saxon style,\" and which Brand, who carried off the stone, supposes to represent the arms of Jarrow monastry."], [141, "JARROW. 9 greatest circumference 78. Brand supposes this bell to have been placed in the monastry at its first foundation, \" to have survived all change of times, and to have escaped all transmutation of metals.\" The lilies, lie presumes, mark its being cast in France, from whence it might have been imported by Benedict. But it is rather too much to suppose that such a valuable article should have escaped the rapacity of the Danish plunderers. A respectable antiquary has remarked that the fleur-de-lis is a common bell-founder's mark. In the vestry is exhibited, as a great curiosity, an old, rude, oaken seat, said to have been the common chair of the Arenerable Bede. It appears as if hewn out with an axe, with the exception of the top of the back, where the cross-piece is mortised to the standards, or upright posts, which serve both for legs ancl its support. These, with the seat and sides, are very ancient ; but the back is acknowledged to be modern. Numerous virtues are attributed to this chair, \"particularly that of assisting fecundity, on which account brides are often installed in it immediately after marriage. Many a fair pilgrim, too, has borne away pieces of this wonder-working relic, to place them under her pillow, confident that the man she dreams of, under so powerful a charm, is des tined to be her husband.\" The pious thefts of such believing visitors have rendered the chair very rough and uneven.

In 1594, his grandson, William Lord Eure, died seized of the whole scite and circuit of the house or cell of Jarrow : 20 messuages, 300 acres of arable, 1000 of pasture, 500 of meadow, 2000 of moor, two salt-pans, and the rectory and tithes in Jarrow, Shields, and Monkton. By his will, he left a large sum to his son, Ralph Lord Eure, to build with at Jarrow. In 1627, the manor was conveyed to Henry Gibb, Esq. In 1653, it was sold to Thomas Bonner and Robert Ellison, who, in 1664, divided the estate. At present, one fourth of the lands, tithes, advowsons, and royalty, is vested in Cuthbert Ellison, Esq. ; one eighth in Sir Thomas Clavering, Bart. ; another eightli in Mrs. Basely ; one half of the land and advowsons (but no tithes) in Messrs.

D. favour of the king, yet the town used such means and gave such reasons to his majesty and the council, that they found it detrimental to the town, and especially to the river, so that he was ut terly hindered and disappointed.\" Sir Henry Vane had a lease of those royalties \" in the broken rebell times ;\" but the men of Newcastle pulled down the wall of his ballast-shore, for which they were brought to trial, and had to pay \u00a3500 damages. The witnesses deposed that Jarrow Slake was part of the lordship of Westoe. However, in 1669, when Sir Charles Adderby and John Cooke, Esq. attempted to build a ballast-quay upon Jarrow Slake, they were obstructed by the corpora tion of Newcastle. The right of that body was admitted, on trying the case in the Exchequer court, and subsequently confirmed by king's council. But the dispute did not terminate here ; for, in 1694, a similar cause began in the Exchequer, the mayor and burgesses of Newcastle, plaintiffs, against the dean and chapter of Durham, and Samuel Shepherd, defendants. A trial was directed on the two following issues : 1. The defendants could not lawfully erect and use a ballast-quay or wharf at Westoe, or Jarrow Slake, without the licence of the mayor and burgesses of Newcastle ; 2. The erecting of such ballast-quay at Westoe or Jarrow Slake would be a detri ment to the river : and in June, 1697, a verdict was found on both issues for the plaintiff's, and the court granted a perpetual injunction to stop the defendants, and every of them, from erecting any ballast-quay or wharf in the above places. March 17, 1697-8, the dean and chapter appealed to the House of Lords, which appeal was dismissed on the 7th May, 1698, and the order in favour of the corporation confirmed.* So early as the year 1653, the corporation of Newcastle granted to Benjamin Ellison, merchant, a lease for 31 years, rent Is. of \" their key or wharf then built and called J arrow-key, in length 1000 yards, from the said key to the Black Point westward up the river, for a ballast-key.\" Colliery. \u2014 In an account of the rents, &c. of Durham cathedral, dated A. D. 1618, mention oc curs of a colliery at Jarrow. At the time that Ralph Gardiner wrote \"England's Grievance,\" (about 1655), the Black Staith at Jarrow is the only one marked in the whole parish. The pre sent colliery was won by Simon Temple, Esq. a very spirited and enterprizing gentleman, who, during the late war, built several stout frigates and other vessels for government. The opening of the colliery took place on September 26, 1803, and is thus described in the local journals : \u2014 \" The fineness of the day, and the general invitation, drew many thousands of people to witness the passage of the coals to the ship Fox, which lay, highly decorated with colours, to receive them,; Early in the morning, the South Shields bells announced the intended feast ; and all the ships in Shields harbour immediately hoisted their colours. About ten, Mr. Temple arrived at Shields, to. proceed with the shipwrights, attended by the Northumberland and Anglesea bands, to the place of festivity, celebrated in early times as the birth-place of Becle. Immediately on his arrival in the Market-place, the shipwrights took the horses out of the carriage, and drew him, attended by his father and three sons, to Jarrow, with flags living and music playing. On Jarrow bridge, he was met by a large assemblage of gentlemen, headed by Sir Cuthbert Heron, Bart, who greeted him on his arrival. Their first step was to lay the foundation-stone of a school, for the education of the poor children of the various workmen employed by Mr. Temple. This was done by hia eldest son, Mr. William Temple, amidst the plaudits of the whole company. They next pro.. ceeded to lay the foundation-stone of a building, intended as a seminary for the instruction of poor females in offices more suitable to their sex than several of their employments in the north of * Bourne, p. 164. Hutchinson, vol. ii. p. 477, Brand, vol. ii. p- 25,"], [145, "JARROW. 13 England. These commendable acts being finished, the procession moved to another part of the estate, to lay the foundation-stone of a fever-house and hospital, for such of the families employed in Mr. Temple's various works as might require these comforts. By this time, several of tlie clergy of the cathedral of Durham, tlie corporation barge of Newcastle, with several members of that body, and a great number of the most respectable gentlemen from all parts of the country, had arrived. They now proceeded to the more immediate cause of their meeting; and the wag gons, being loaded with coals, were taken to the ship, under the banners of the South Shields Loyal Volunteers, which were then unfurled, and a general discharge of artillery, the music play ing, \" Weel may the keel row,'\" and other appropriate tunes. It was supposed that not less than 10,000 people were assembled on this occasion. In a tent prepared for their entertainment, about 300 gentlemen sat down to dinner. The workmen, in number 500, dined at a long table without.\" This pit was sunk to the depth of 840 feet, and the main seam was 6 feet 3 inches in thickness. Unfortunately, this colliery has been subjected to repeated and tremendous explosions from the accumulation of hydrogen gas. In 1826, an awful and sudden blast hurried thirty-four persons into eternity ; and, in 1828, eight more were killed by a similar accident. But the most calami tous explosion occurred on August 3, 1830, at six o'clock in the morning, when forty-two men and boys were killed, twenty-one of whom left widows, with sixty-six children. Ten more men were much injured, and two horses killed. At the time, 120 men were in the mine, of whom 70 were in the Bensham seam. Mr. Buddie has read, to the Natural History Society of Newcastle, an interesting paper con- cerning this melancholy occurrence, which he illustrated by a plan of the workings. It appears that the explosion was totally unexpected, the mine being considered perfectly safe at the time. But, in deep mines, the accumulation of inflammable air in the fissures of the roof is occasionally so rapid and extensive, as that in a few minutes a pit, from a state of perfect safety, mav become completely charged to the point of explosion. Just before the elastic force of the compressed gas burst forth, and produced this dreadful catastrophe, the man who was hewing near the secret and dangerous gasometer, found the coal on a sudden become soft and brittle, which circumstance, if timely re- ported, might have led to measures for the prevention of the accident. However, this poor man perished with the other sufferers. The remaining workmen and overseers in the mine displayed, as is usually the case in such circumstances, the most laudable and devoted courage and humanity. A public subscription was immediately started, for the relief of the relations and children of the sufferers, and which now (December, 1830) amounts to \u00a3910. In speaking of Jarrow, Hutchinson says, \" Little more remained of this once famous town, when we visited it in 1782, than two or three mean cottages.\" But, since the colliery commenced, it has resumed some degree of consequence. The pitmen's cottages, including many tradesmen's houses, extend about a mile along the South Shields turnpike road ; while other branches, forming streets to the colliery, accommodate a part of the industrious population of the place. Here are a Methodist meeting-house, a ladies' boarding-school, three public houses, and the houses of the colliery-viewer and the agent. On the hill north from the church, and overlooking the river and the Slake, stands Jarrow House, the property of Thomas Brown, Esq. late proprietor of the barony of Oo-le in Northumberland. Mr. William Brown, ship-owner, resides in the Slake House, on the opposite side of the church.

West from Dunkirk are two new staiths, for the colliery on the Black Fell, belonging to the Right Honourable Lord Ravensworth and partners. The coals are termed in the market Peareth's Wallsend. Monkton. \u2014 This ancient possession of the monastry of Jarrow is the reputed birth-place of the Venerable Bede. Bede's well still retains his name, and was, till very lately, in repute as a bath for the recovery of infirm and diseased children. Formerly, a large concourse of people used to resort to this sacred spot on Midsummer-eve, which was celebrated with bonfires, music, dancing, and other rural sports ; but this and other merry customs have been long discontinued. The chief part of Monkton is leasehold, under the dean and chapter; but Cuthbert Ellison, Esq. purchased a small freehold (part of the impropriation) from Mr. Bonner, a parcel of which he sold to Mr.. Edward Aubone Major, who resides here. Hebburn. \u2014 This place stands two miles to the west of Jarrow, and one mile south of the Tyne, The lands in Hebburn belonged to the cell of Jarrow, or the convent of Durham, from an early"], [147, "JARROW. 15 period. Hebburn was in the possession of the Willy family previous to 1366; but, in 1503, the property was vested in the family of Grey. In 1532, it passed to the Baxters of Newcastle ; but, in 1562, the latter conveyed North Hebburn to Richard Hodgson, alderman of Newcastle. This family,* in its chief branch, terminated in an heiress, married to Francis Carr of Cocken ; and the estate passed by purchase, about the year 1650, to the family of Ellison, in whose possession it remains. The old mansion-house at Hebburn was strongly built, as if for defence, like the Border towers. It was nearly rebuilt about 1790, and is now a spacious and handsome edifice of modern architec ture. The situation is fine, and has been much improved by extensive plantations, and by throw ing the Newcastle road to the north of the house. Cuthbert Ellison, Esq. the proprietor, eldest son of Henry Ellison (ob. at Bath, 1795), was born July 12, 1783.

Surtees observes, \"What is most surprising is that Hebborne continued to throw out plots and conspiracies, after it had become the property of a sober Protestant family, intimately connected with the corporation of Newcastle. In 1656, a mad design was entertained by \u2014 Clavering and Adam Sheppardson, to contrive a way from the cole-pitts, about two miles from the castle, underground to the castle of Tynemouth, for to relieve the enemy with provisions if need required, and for that purpose there was a great store of provisions laid in, and to be laid in Hcbburne-housc, and eighty firelocks and a great number of stilettoes laid in FcHen-housc.\" \u2014 Thurlow' s State Papers."], [148, "CHESTER WARD.\u2014 E.

The present colliery at Hebburn commenced in 1792. On August 12, 1814, Mr. Elias Mould, under viewer, descended one of the pits, accompanied with the deputies and overmen, in order to improve the ventilation ; when the pit suddenly fired, and himself and ten others were instantly killed. The pit village forms a very large square, and contains a great number of families. The north side is open towards the river, except where a public house stands. Hebburn Quay lies on the river, northwards from Hebburn village. Here is the old Black Staith belonging to Hebburn colliery. Sometimes upwards of sixty sail are lying at this quay at one time, delivering their ballast. The machine, which is ingeniously constructed, is worked by a steam-engine, and is the property of C. Ellison, Esq. Here are two public houses, a farmstead, a few cottages, and a ferry-boat. The ballast hills near this place have been accumulating since about the middle of the seventeenth century. Hedworth is a village on irregular ground in the plain to the south-east of Hebburn. It con tains two public houses, a wind-mill and a water-mill, a bleach-field, with a blacksmith and cart wrin-ht's shop. Here is a bridge of two arches over the brook to which the village gives name. Several farm-houses are scattered about in the neighbourhood, which is well inclosed and cultivated. The vill of Hedworth gave name to a family at a remote period ; but the chief property in Hedworth, in process of time, became vested in the prior and convent of Durham, who had a deer-park here as early as tlie pontificate of Bishop Farnham. Within the last two centuries, the family of Patterson had considerable property, both free and leasehold, in Hedworth. The Stote family long held many leasehold possessions here. Stote^s House is mentioned in 1538, and it still exhibits traces of walls and enclosures suitable to a family \"of yeomanly gentry\" There is in Hedworth one freehold of about 42 acres, belonging to the living of Monkwearmouth ; about 33 acres, the property of the late Mrs. Carrighan of Whickham, now in the possession of G. T. L. Blenkinsop, Esq. ; a windmill and about 4 acres of ground, recently purchased by C. Ellison, Esq. ; and a garth and cottage, belonging to Mr. William Lister, who holds the old leasehold estate of the Stotes. Wardley stands a short distance south of Hebburn Hall, and is supposed to be a place of great antiquity. From its contiguity to the Roman road, some antiquarians have inferred that it was a Roman summer-camp. However, it is an ancient possession of Jarrow monastry ; and when William de Tanfield, prior of Durham, resigned in 1313 on account of age and infirmity, the Manor House of Wardeley was assigned for his residence.

A deep fosse, with an earthen mound cast to its outer side, surrounds an irregular, oblong plot, con taining 6 acres and 35 perches. The sides of the entrenchment measure on the north 145 feet, on the east 211 feet, on the south 143, and on the west 197- The ditch varies in breadth from thir teen feet to nine ; its depth exceeds six feet ; a bridge crosses it near the centre of its eastern side ; and it has been filled up to admit a corresponding road on the west. The area is now occupied by a farm-house and its appendages. Traces of fish-ponds are visible within the area on the south ; and the garden is supposed to have occupied the north-east corner of the area. This spot is supposed to be the Wredelaw or Weredelaw of Simeon, where the corpse of St. Cuthbert, in 995, became immoveable, and the wandering monastics received the revelation which directed them to Durham. Hodgson, who supports this opinion (Arch\u00e6ol. \u00c6liana, vol. i. p. 112), observes that Wardley may in some sense be termed east of Durham, and it may be near in com parison with the distance from Rippon. Law signifies an entrenchment, as well as a hill ; and it is a place properly inhabit abiles, being situate in the midst of a very extensive plain, having the adjoining ground covered with water. Besides, Wardley is in the direct road to Lindisfarn by way of Jarrow, which route the monks chose in their flight in 1069; and, further, here were cer tainly \" cedes reercandi,\" a place of summer residence for the monks, a circumstance which War den Law has not. This reasoning is undoubtedly extremely plausible. It does not appear that any antiquities have been found in this place. Follonsby is bounded by Wreken Dyke on the north, on the south and east by the parish of Washington, and on the east by Boldon. Thorald of London, the grantee of Bishop William, gave his vill of Folettibi to his younger son Nicholas, who released his right in it to Robert Fitz- Roger, for twenty marks, a gown, and a palfrey. The estate was held by John de Farneacres in the fourteenth century, and afterwards by the Gategangs of Gateshead. In 1429, Roger Thorn ton, the wealthy merchant of Newcastle, died seized of it ; but Lord Lumley, who married the heiress of Thornton, probably alienated the manor, for it was soon after the property of the Hil tons, in which family it continued until 1750.

In the south-west corner stands the monument erected to the memory of the * The celebrated Greek critic, Richard Dawes, was born in 1708. The hamlet of Stapleton, in the parish of Market-Bosworth, in Leicestershire, is supposed to have been the place of his birth, because a Dr. Dawes, a great scholar and a searcher after the philosopher's stone, resided there about the beginning of the last century ; but Mr. Hodgson conjectures that he descended from a family who were long seated in the parishes of Barton and Bampton, in Westmoreland. However, it is known that he en joyed the instructions of Mr. Blackwell, who was master of Bosworth Grammar School. That his parents were not wealthy, may be inferred from his entering Cambridge as a scholar of the lowest rank ; for in 1725, when he was only about seventeen years old, he was admitted a sizar of Emanuel College in that university. Two years after his matriculation he published a \" Therno-Thriambic Idyl\" on the death of George the First. In 1729 he took the degree of Bachelor of Arts, and in 1731 was chosen fellow of his own college in the nomination of Sir Wolstan Dixie, Bart, who was a Market-Bosworth man. In 1733 he obtained the degree of Master of Arts, and the following year he was an unsuccessful candidate for the office of Esquire Beadle in Cambridge. The indolent and sedentary way in which it appears he lived at college, probably originated in a melancholy turn of mind, which loved to indulge itself in solitary contemplations of its own powers, and to look down upon the trifling labours and intriguing schemes of society that was about him, with a sort of misanthropic scorn, and to vent its embittered feelings in such harsh and sarcastic expressions as created him more enemies among the busy and self-interested many, than the splendour of his talents could procure him friends among the generous and learned few. When the state of his health rendered it necessary to have recourse to some kind of exercise, being of a strong athletic frame of body,"], [151, "HEWORTH. 19 Unfortunate sufferers, who perished in the dreadful explosion of Felling colliery, May the 25th, 1812. It is a neat plain obelisk nine feet high, fixed in a solid stone base, having four brass plates let into the pillar on the four sides, on which are inscribed the name and age of each of the and not over delicate in the choice of his company, he took to the practice of bell-ringing ; and as such a genius could not stoop to mediocrity, he quickly became the leader of the band, and carried the art to the highest perfection. While quaffing with the ringers \" the nut-brown draughts,\" he seasoned it with the lich spicery of wit and humour, though such conversations and company were unsuitable to a gownsman. In 1736 he wrote an epithalamium, consisting of fifty Greek hexameter lines, on the marriage of Frede rick Prince of Wales, and Augusta Princess of Saxe-Gotha ; and in the same year he issued proposals for printing by subscription, \" The First Book of Milton's Paradise Lost, rendered in Greek Verse, with Notes.\" This was accompanied by a specimen. But his researches into the minutiae and niceties of the Greek language soon rendered him dissatisfied with this effort, and he very ingeniously pointed out the errors in his own performance. It was customary with him in conversation humourously to expose his ver sion to ridicule; and therefore, though he had actually completed his design, by translating the whole first book of the Paradise Lost, it is no wonder that he did not commit it to the press. In July, 1738, he was appointed head master of the Royal Grammar School in Newcastle upon Tyne, and in the October following was admitted Master of the Hospital of St. Mary the Virgin, in that town. While occupying these offices, he was indefatigable in prosecuting his enquiries into the nature, peculiari ties, and elegancies of the Greek tongue ; and accordingly he published his \" Miscellanea Critica.\" Mr. Hubbard, of Emanuel College, Cambridge, and Mr. Mason, of Trinity, assisted in the publication. It was Mr. Dawes' design, in this work, to afford such a specimen of his critical abilities, as should enable the learned world to judge of what might be expected from him, in an edition which he had projected of all the Attic poets, as well as of Homer and Pindar. Though his scheme was never carried into execution, he has obtained, by his \" Miscellanea Critica,\" avery high place among those who have contributed to the promo tion of Greek learning in England, and, as such, his name will be transmitted with honour to posterity. This learned work has been spoken of in terms of distinguished applause by some of the first literary characters in Europe, particularly Valkner, Pierson, Koen, Reiske, Brunck, Musgrave, Tyrwhitt, and Phorson. A second edition of it in 8vo. was given in 1781, from the Clarendon press, by the Rev. Mr. Burgess, of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, now bishop of Salisbury, who has enriched the work with a learned preface, and a number of notes of great value and importance, and some assistance from Bawes' MS. procured by Dr. Farmer and Mr. Salter. A fourth edition of this valuable work was published by the learned Mr. Kidd in 1817. and a fifth edition in 1827, with considerable additions and many curious notes. Dawes' very masterly style of writing in English is displayed in his letter to Dr. Taylor, which also affords an excellent specimen of his talents in controversial criticism. This highly-gifted man, according to Dr. Keppis, had a dash of insanity in his constitution, and fancied that all his friends had slighted him, or used him ill. At length he became involved in altercations with the Corporation, when he adopted a singular method of displaying his resentment, or rather his contempt ; for in teaching the boys at school, he made them translate the Greek word for an ass into alderman \u2014 a practice which habit rendered so inveterate, that some of his pupils inadvertently used the same expression, with very ludicrous effect, in the public college exercise. In 1 7*47 he published his complaints against his towns men under the title of \" Extracts from a Manuscript Pamphlet, entitled Tittle Tattle Mongers, No. 1.\" Mr. Hodgson amiably remarks : \u2014 \" After reading this curious performance over more than once, I have no eyes nor judgment to find any symptoms of its being the produce of a disordered intellect. It certainly was not prudent to publish it at all: but one of his mottoes \u2014 \" ISlulta dinque tuli ; tandem patientia victa est,\" shows that he had suffered indignities till his patience was conquered.\" The impression of the pamphlet \"was anxiously bought up and destroyed, and is now extremely scarce. Dawes was certainly unsteady in his attentions to his school, resentful of all interference with his ma nagement, and cuttingly satirical; but he was also firmly seated in his office, and a giant and a king where he was. At last, in 1749, the Corporation executed a bond, granting him an annuity of \u00a380 for his life, and allowing him to receive a stipulated fine on all renewals of leases of property belonging to the Hospital, in which one life had fallen in ; he, on his part, resigning both of the offices he held. After this he retired to a house on the banks of the Tyne, at Heworth Shore, where at that time only three or four families re sided. The banks of the river, on both sides, being in that neighbourhood covered with oak wood, the situation he selected was sweet and retired. His chief amusement was rowing a boat on the Tyne. He brewed \u2022rood ale, and a humorous and excentric blacksmith of Bill Quay frequently partook of it. During one year he resided at Monkton, and then returned to his former habitation."], [152, "20 CHESTER WARD.\u2014 E. D. ninety-one sufferers, alphabetically arranged. The following inscription runs along the head of the plates : \u2014 \" In Memory ofthe 91 persons killed in Felling Colliery May 24th, 1812.

On the left side of the north entrance into the Chapel-yard is a square tomb, the top of which is in a dilapidated state. At the east end of this tomb is the following inscription : \u2014 \" The Tomb of Wm. Eichardson, of Greenside, late Corn-merchant, Newcastle, ivho died June I'Jt/t, 1817, in- his 54th Year.'''' Below this are sixteen doggerel lines, accusing his creditors and their law-agent of cruelty and oppression ; but the words will soon be obliterated.* The bell of this chapel has excited much curiosity, as the characters or letters upon it have puzzled many of the best antiquaries ; but William Hamper, Esq. of Birmingham, assumes that He is described to have been strong, tall, and corpulent, and his hair, which was thick and flowing, was snowy white. His nose had \" some degree of the Socratic Simolcs,\" or flatness, and when the children teazed him on account of these peculiarities, he would shake his stick at them, and then perhaps throw some copper amongst them, enjoying the scramble it occasioned. He died at Heworth Shore on the 21st of March, 1766, in the house where he had lived about sixteen years, and was buried in Heworth Chapel yard. The report that he ended his days by an act of suicide is untrue. Some have suspected his belief of the truth of Christianity. Mr. Hodgson justly infers from the Extracts, \" That while they are the spark ling and effervescence of a scholar that treated insult with derision and scorn, their lofty and disdainful tone was breathed from a mind, which, though it was rough, was proud and virtuous; which set all impu tations of moral blame at defiance; and honestly and obstinately adhered to the conduct and opinions it considered right.\" His grave in Heworth Chapel-yard is still marked with a head-stone of rude workmanship, said to be the gratuitous offering of a country mason to the memory of a great scholar. The stone bears the following inscription : \" In Memory of Richard Dawes, late Head Master of the Grammer School of Newcastle, who died the 21st. of March, 1766, aged 57-\" Above the inscription is carved a trumpet, sword, and scythe. Before the Chapel was rebuilt, Mr. Hodgson, the incumbent, carefully removed the stone, marked the grave, and when the building was finished, moved the frail \"memorial\" back to its former place. A large block of bazalt lies lengthways on the grave, and the following inscription on a plate of bronze is sunk into it : \u2014 \" THE BURIAL PLACE OF RICHARD DAWES, M. A. AUTHOR OF THE CELEBRATED WORK INTITULED MISCELLANEA CRITICA.

The vessel, having been imperfectly baked, had imbibed much nitrate of pot-ash, which effloresced upon its sides. The coins are executed with sufficient neatness, exactly in the usual character of the Saxo-Northumbrian mintage. The obverse exhibits a plain short cross, Ecfrid Rex x ; the reverse has a similar cross, surrounded by something like the appearance of rays, and by a legend supposed to read L V X, a symbol and inscription which have been deemed allusive to the diffusion of the Christian religion in the kingdom of Northumberland. These coins precede any other known issue of the Northumbrian mint nearly 150 years ; and it is a very pro bable conjecture, that they were struck and deposited on the area of the foundation of Jarrow and its dependant churches during the reign of Egfrid. The vessel which contained these curious Saxon coins was presented to the Antiquarian Society of Newcastle by the Rev. John Hodgson, who distributed about a dozen of the coins amongst various societies, and to individuals devoted to antiquarian researches. When the chapel was rebuilt, half an acre was added to the cbapel yard, and consecrated by the bishop of Durham, September 27, 1828.

In 1400, some of the lands were held by John de Hetheworth, who rendered to the prior various rents and services.

It contains a few neat houses, and many cottages for the collieries, which, with the small gardens attached, give an aspect of comfort and industry to the place. Here are two surgeons, one victualler, several mechanics, and a poor-house, which was erected for Heworth chapelry in 1821. Felling HaU, the residence of John Grace, Esq. is the old seat of the Brandlings; but it is now shaken by colliery creeps. The fine old trees in the neighbourhood are the pleasino- traces left of an old and opulent family. Crow Hall is occupied by Thomas Wylam, Esq. The prior of Durham, in the time of Henry III. enfeoffed Walter de Selby of the manor of Fellino-, \"to hold by homage, fealty, knights' service, two marks rent, and suit at the prior's every fortnio-ht.\" In 1331, the manor was in the possession of the Surtees family ; and, in 1509, the last Surtees died seized of Felling and North Gosforth. After long litigation amongst the co-heirs of the blood of Surtees, Sir Robert Brandling and his wife Ann obtained dominion over the Felling estates. Sir Francis Brandling, son and heir of Robert (the great nephew of Sir Robert), was representative for Northumberland in 1625, and deserted Felling for Alnwick Abbey. His de scendants, who were enriched by marriage with the heiress of Lee of Middleton, near Rothwell, Yorkshire, occasionally f-esided at Felling, till Charles Brandling, Esq. in 1760, built the present elegant mansion at Gosforth. The manor of Felling contains several strata of coal, the uppermost of which was wrought in the beginning of the last century. The stratum called the High Main was won, at the depth of 125 fathoms, in 1779) anci continued to be worked till 1811, when it was totally excavated. The colliery of the Low Main was commenced in October, 1810, and continues to be worked. About half past eleven o'clock in the morning of May the 25th, 1812, one of the most tremendous explosions recorded in the history of coal-mining took place at this colliery. The mine was at the time considered in a state of perfect safety, and all the arrangements were in the highest order and regularity. Nearly the whole establishment, consisting of about 128 persons, were below; the second set, or shift of men, having gone down before the first had come up. The subterraneous fire broke out with two heavy blasts from the John pit, followed almost instan taneously by one from the William pit. A slight shock, as from an earthquake, was felt for half a mile around the workings ; and the noise of the explosion, though dull, was heard to three or four miles distance. Immense quantities of dust and small coal were by these blasts thrown into the air, in the form of an inverted cone ; the heaviest part of the matter fell near the pit, but the dust borne away by a strong west wind, fell in a continued shower, from the pit to the distance of a mile and a half. In the village of Heworth it caused a darkness like early twilight, and covered the roads so thickly, that footsteps were strongly imprinted in it ; pieces of burning coal, driven off the solid stratum of the mine, were also blown up one of the shafts. By twelve o'clock those who had escaped with life had ascended by the gin rope : but only twenty-nine persons were saved out of one hundred and twenty-one who were in the mine at the time of the explosion. At a quarter after twelve Mr. Straker the viewer, Mr. Anderson, and others, descended with steel mills ; but their attempt to reach the crane was interrupted by choak damp, and the sparks from the steel fell like dark drops of blood. In retracing their steps they were stopped by a thick smoke. Convinced that the mine was on fire, and apprehensive of another explosion, they hurried to the shaft, and the viewer had but just ascended when an explosion did actually take place ; those in the mine escaped by falling upon their faces. After some other bold but unsuccessful"], [155, "HEWORTH. 23 attempts to penetrate into the workings, the mine was made air-tight. On being re-opened, a cur rent of water was, for ten hours, directed down the shaft, and the air being thus rendered cool and wholesome, the workings were entered on the 8th of July, when the first dead body was found. Ninety-two coffins had been prepared, and as soon as a cart-load of them passed through the vil lage of Low Heworth, the women rushed out of their houses, and their howlings were truly heart rending : but by friendly remonstrances the public manifestations of their feelings were restrained, and they consented that the bodies should be interred as soon as discovered. On the 19th of Sep tember all the corpses were found except one. \" The effects of the blast were most various : round the crane twenty-one bodies lay in ghastly confusion, some shattered to pieces, others lying as if overpowered with sleep, and others scorched as if by the fiery wind of the desert ; others lay prostrate with their hands extended, as if attempting to escape the blast.\"* A horse and four wag gons had been driven with such violence down the inclined plane board, that it appeared as if they had been shot by a mortar against a rock. This fatal accident excited a general feeling of commiseration for tlie families of the sufferers. A liberal subscription was immediately entered into for their relief. Collections were made by benevolent individuals, by the coal-owners on the Wear and Tyne, by the coal-factors in London, in churches and in meeting-houses, and by various societies and corporate bodies. At the close of December following, the sum of \u00a32806, 15s. 6jd. had been subscribed, of which \u00a364 remained in hand, but has been since expended. Of the ninety-two sufferers, thirty were married men ; and ten widows were left pregnant, fourteen other families had claims on the committee for the loss of children, and one young woman for the loss of a brother who supported her. It appears also that the hu mane proprietors of the colliery, during the six months succeeding the accident, expended \u00a320 a week in procuring provisions for the destitute relatives of the deceased. This colliery, after being re-opened, has been worked without any particular accident up to November, 1830, when the John pit was discovered to be on fire, near to a steam-engine placed down the pit.-f- The most vigorous exertions were made for some time to extinguish the fire by means of fire-engines ; but although it was thought this might be thus effected in about three weeks, yet, from the great expense incurred by proceeding in this way, it was deemed better to extinguish the fire by excluding the atmospheric air. To effect this, strong beams of wood were let into a bed of sandstone, forming part of the sides of the two shafts communicating with the \u2022workings in which the fire was. Upon them were laid a scaffolding of deals, which was covered * See a pamphlet entitled \" An Account of the Explosion in Brandling Main Colliery, at Felling, near Newcastle upon Tyne, on May 25, 1812 ; with a Plan and Description of the Colliery, a brief Statement of the Fund raised for the Widows of the Sufferers, Suggestions for founding a Collier's Hospital, and a Fu neral Sermon on the Occasion.\" The profits arising from this well-written and interesting publication were applied in erecting the monument in memory of the sufferers in Heworth chapel-yard, before described. The bodies were interred in a trench, side by side, two coffins deep, a partition of brick-work being built between every four coffins. t Very deep pits could not be worked without the aid of a steam-engine below. It is usually placed on a high part of the workings, and draws the water and coals from the deepest and most remote parts. Jarrow colliery, at the dip south of the shaft, is worked at the depth of 220 fathoms beneath the surface. But to facilitate the workings at such an immense depth, four steam-engines are employed under-ground, though the pumping engine at the main shaft is operating for eight hours daily, with 150 horse-power.

The pits have since been re-opened, and preparations are now making to renew the regular work of the colliery. > j East Town is a small village, on the east side of a rivulet which divides Gateshead parish from the chapelry of Heworth. It consists of two rows of cottages and one public house, and is occu pied by workmen employed in the Friar's Goose colliery.

Felling Shore is one of those populous, manufacturing, and trading villages, which will proba bly soon form almost one continuous line along the banks of the Tyne from Gateshead to Bill Quay, a distance of more than three miles.* Here is a Methodist chapel, built in 1805, and a small Inde pendent chapel, erected in 1808. Several shop-keepers supply the inhabitants with necessary articles ; and four public houses are supported by workmen and seamen. Here are several grindstone wharfs, Messrs. Grace and Co.'s staith for Felling colliery, and an extensive establishment for preparing fish-oi! from tho blubber brought by the Greenland ships. The large copperas works here, belong ing to George Dunn, Esq. is the oldest establishment of the kind upon the river Tyne. This useful artic'e is obtained by exposing the pyrites from coal-mines, on a clayey surface, to the action of the sun and air, while the rain washes away the salt, which is collected in immense reservoirs, and then, after being boiled to a certain specific gravity, is crystalized. Mr. William Salter's ma chinery, for making brown and other wrapping papers, is wrought by a steam-engine. The large building, erected for brewing porter, is now used as soda works by Messrs. Losh, Hutchinson, and Co. ; by Mr. William Rowntree, for preparing grain for the use of brewers ; and by Messrs. Wilkinson and Co. maltsters. Common brown ware is made here by Mr. Joseph Wood; and a forg\u00b0 has been lately commenced by Mr. Joseph Galley. Many excellent vessels have been built at this place. Heworth Shore is another busy village, with four public houses. Here is an extensive manu factory belonging to Messrs. Bramwell and Co. in which several useful articles are produced, particularly Prussiate of iron, or Prussian blue; also Prussiate of potass, used as a blue dye in the manufactories at Manchester and Glasgow, in which it supersedes the use of indigo. A German Jew, in Oakwellgate in Gateshead, first attempted to make this article about the beginning of the last century. He afterwards removed his manufactory to Corbridge : but not succeeding, he relinquished the speculation ; when the late Thomas Simpson, Esq. a gentleman of extensive knowledge in chemistry, and of an unwearied and persevering industry, under the superintendence of Mr. Atkinson's grandfather, who had been employed in the work at Corbridge, took it up, and brought the art to perfection at 'Elswick near Newcastle, where it continued till the death of Mr. Simpson, soon after which it was removed to Heworth Shore. Mr. Simpson was also the inventor * Bourne says, \" When the hoastmen renewed their charter, they had licence to send coals above the Bill, and Mr. Cole procured a shore at Friar Goose, Mr. Henry Chapman procured a shore upon Heworth grounds, and Mr. Rob.

Sal-ammoniac, or muriate of ammonia, is also manufac tured here, which the proprietors, before this laboratory was established, made in Pipewellgate in Gateshead. Colours, too, of various kinds, are prepared here, as mineral greens and tlie oxides of iron ; also, all the preparations produced by the distillation of coal, such as coal tar, bright black and bright red varnishes, &c. This manufactory has continued in branches of the same family for above a century ; and, as an indication of the advance of the arts, we are informed that Prus sian blue, made by the original Mr. Simpson, was sold at two guineas per pound, the same which is now but 3s. 6d. Here is a coal-staith belonging to Messrs. John Hutchinson and Co. owners of Sheriff Hill col liery ; and a coke manufactory, the property of the same gentlemen. Mr Joseph Hair and Co. Humble, Taylor, and Co. and Mr. Joseph Robson, have all similar establishments in this place. They also make coal-tar and lamp-black.* The latter article is procured by collecting the smoke passing off' during the process of making coal-tar. Mr. Allen has here a soda manufactory, and Mr. John Atkinson works for making sal-ammoniac. At the Tyne Pottery, belonging to Messrs. Thomas Patterson and Co. white and coloured flint-ware are manufactured ; and common brown earthen ware is made here by Mr. Joseph Dawson, and also by Mr. John Codling. Bricks and tiles are made here by Mr. William Armstrong, and fire-bricks by Messrs. Cuthbert Alder and Co. Here is a grindstone, flag, and fire-stone wharf, belonging to Mr. W. Whitehead ; and a steam-engine and machinists' work-shops, belonging to Mr. Joseph Dodd. Ships were formerly built here; and large quantities of wheat were ground at the mills, worked by water and steam, which stand on the scite of the ancient manor-mill of Heworth. They are the property of Mr. Cuthbert Pigg of Newcastle, but are at present unoccupied. Mr. Pigg has recently built some good cottages, ad joining Heworth Lane, a short distance south of this place. Bill Quay is a populous village, containing several shops and five public houses.-f Here is a large and old-established green-glass bottle-house, carried on by Messrs. John Cookson and Coul thard, and which was first established by Sir William Rawlinson. The Arkindale Lead Mining Company has a very extensive establishment for extracting silver from lead, and making sheet-lead. These works, under Messrs. Alfred Hall and Co. are very ingeniously constructed, and consist of two refining furnaces, one for reducing and one clay hearth. Oil of vitriol, or sulphuric acid, is manufactured here, on an extensive scale, by Messrs. Dou bleday and Easterby. The acid is formed by burning sulphur in immense leaden chambers, or houses, and which is afterwards concentrated in platina retorts. Until the erection of these works in 1818, there was no other manufactory of the kind within one hundred miles; and as sulphuric acid is an indispensible article in many manufacturing processes, particularly in the decomposition of sea or common salt (muriate of soda), this branch of manufacture has lately been extended upon the Tyne with a rapidity which the most sanguine could scarcely have anticipated, This improve. * An ingenious workman named Liddle, employed in a lamp-black manufactory at this place, being de sirous to procure a cheap light for the packing-room, inflated and dried a sheep's gut, and, by inserting a small copper tube at each end, conveyed part of the hydrogen gas, which is constantly thrown off in the process of making lamp-black, to where it was wanted. In a short time, this flexible pipe was destroyed by a cat. Perhaps a coat of pitch would have prevented this. t The number of public houses in a place is generally proportioned to the extent of its trade.

D. ment has been facilitated by the judicious measures of government, in reducing the tax on sulphur to a nominal amount, and the total repeal of that upon common salt.* Aquafortis, or nitrous acid, and spirit of salt, or muriatic acid, are also made in these works ; and soapers' waste ashes are reduced into an alkaline, for the purpose of being re-employed in the Close soap-works, where a yearly duty of from 45 to \u00a350,000 is paid to government for that useful article. Here is a colour manufactory, belonging to Messrs. C. and J. Myers and Co. and a ship-builder's yard, occupied by Mr. William Boutland ; also the coal-staith of Messrs. RusseU and Co. Near this place is a deep dene, called Cat Dene, which, tradition says, was formed by ancient quarries, from whence stone was taken to build the walls of Newcastle. The ravine is now a thick jungle of thorns and forest trees. About half a mile below Bill Quay are the well-known creek and cottage called Lizzie Mood-le's ; near to which stands Pelaw Main staith, belonging to Messrs. Perkins and Co. of Oustin colliery, and Coronation staith, the property of Messrs. Brandling and Co. of Heworth colliery. Holly Hill, a hamlet, stands near to the Newcastle and Sunderland road, a short distance east-south-east of Nether Heworth, and contains a ladies' school, under Miss Robinson, and a few mechanics' shops. Upper Heworth consists of a few scattered houses, which, from their elevated situation, com mand an interesting view of the vale of Tyne. Here are many quarries of freestone, called the Heworth Fire-stone, on account of its property of withstanding the strong heats of glass-houses, and of iron and steel furnaces, better than any other stone or brick hitherto discovered in this neighbourhood. It is also of an open and porous nature, and makes excellent filtering troughs. The colliery here is wrought by Messrs. Brandling and Co. Here is a boys' boarding-academy, kept by Mr. C. G. Rapier, a good house occupied by Mr. John Wylam, and another by the col liery viewer. High Felling has recently been so extended as almost to join Low Felling. Here is a small Methodist chapel, two public houses, with butchers' and grocers' shops. Windy Nook is a populous hamlet in Upper Heworth township, about 2f miles south-east of Gateshead. It is chiefly inhabited by workmen employed in the adjoining quarries. Here are three public houses, one farmstead, a corn-mill, and several mechanics. The name of this place indicates the lofty and exposed nature of the situation it occupies. * Note from Mr. James Wright, who superintends the extensive manufacturing processes of Messrs. Doubleday and Easterby, both here and at the soapery in Newcastle : \u2014 \" Twelve years ago, kelp, from Scotland, Ireland, and Norway ; barilla, from the Mediterranean and Teneriffe ; pot and pearl ash, from America, Russia, and Germany ; and natron, from Egypt and the East Indies, were imported for the use of the glass and soap manufacturers on the Tyne, to the amount of several thousand tons annually. Now, the large establishments for the production of soda from British salt, by means of oil of vitriol (sulphuric acid), carried on by the Tyne Glass Company at Salt Meadows, the St. Peter's Glass and Bottle Company at St. Peter's Quay.

It was successively the seat of the Jennisons and Colvilles, and is now the residence of Mr. John Dobson, of Gateshead, solicitor. It occupies the highest ground betwixt the vales of the Wear and Tyne, and commands a varied and extensive prospect over the estuaries of both rivers. THE CHAPELRY OF SOUTH SHIELDS This chapelry is bounded by the Tyne on the north, by the sea on the east, by the parish of Whitburn on the south, and by Jarrow on the west and south-west. It includes three townships : South Shields, Westoe, and Harton : but South Shields is subdivided into four constableries, called Low Ward, East Pan Ward, Middle Ward, and West Pan Ward. The chapelry, in 1821, contained 1548 houses, and 16,503 inhabitants, exclusive of seamen. The rental assessed to the county rate, in 1829, amounted to \u00a324,366. South Shields. \u2014 This important sea-port and market-town is situated opposite to North Shields, on the south side of the river Tyne, at its confluence with the German Ocean. It is distant 8 miles east of Newcastle upon Tyne, 21 miles north-north-east of Durham, and 276 north-north west of London. South Shields is undoubtedly a place of very high antiquity. From the testimony of C\u00e6sar, it appears that the Celts, or ancient Britons, had acquired considerable proficiency in the art of war, both upon tlie land and the sea; and it is not probable that so acute and warlike a people would leave the entrance of such an important river as the Tyne unguarded. That the Romans had a military station upon tlie Law Hill is undeniably proved ; and that people so generally fixed their camps or stations on the scite of the native fortified towns, that antiquarians generally consider a Roman station as indicative of some prior settlement of the Britons. Mr. Horsley mentions a Roman altar which he saw lying at the north-west corner of the station. It was removed by Dr. Hunter, and is now in the library of the dean and chapter of Durham. It is of a coarse brown stone, much of the same nature with what we frequently meet with in other Roman altars. The inscription is effaced ; but the sides exhibit the usual sacrificial vessels, and the knife is sculptured on the back. Horsley mentions two other altars found on the Law ; one built up in a quay wall, and another which was sent to Dr. Martin Lister, who published his reading of the inscription in the Philosophical Transactions (No. 146). Horsley gives the follow ing reading, which differs in some degree from Dr. Lister's . \u2014 \" Diis matribus pro salute impera toris Marci Aurelii Antonini \u2014 Augusti PU felicis lubens merito ob reditum!\" The original is carved on the back with representations of instruments used in sacrifice, and was probably erected on account of the safe arrival here of one of the emperors. This last altar was sent to Norwich, and is supposed to be lost. A sepulchral fragment, inscribed Dis Ma/iibtts, was also discovered here. But the most decisive evidence of the existence of a station here was discovered in 1798, by some workmen employed on the grounds of Nicholas Fairies, Esq. on the Law Hill. They struck on the evident remains of a Roman Hypocaust, or Sudatory. The masonry consisted of brick and \u2022dressed freestone intermingled : the lowest course was of coarse whinstone, evidently brought from tlie Shore, as the barnacles were still adhering to them. Mr. Fairies has a sketch of this interesting"], [160, "28 CHESTER WARD\u2014 E. D. remain, taken at the time. He also possesses a beautiful gold coin of Marcus Aurelius, and seve ral small brass coins from Claudius Gothicus to Valentinian, which seem to prove that this station was not deserted until the period when the Roman eagle took his final flight from Britain. The station seems to have included several acres; and fragments of Roman bricks and pottery are turned up abundantly in a field adjoining the Law Hill, when in tillage.* The Roman name of this station, at the southern mouth of the Tyne, is uncertain. \" Vedra,'\"' says Horsley, \"must be the river Tyne, on which stands the town of Newcastle; and I know no other name for the Roman station and town at the mouth of this river, near South Shields, but Ostia Vedra.\" This appellation occurs in the map prefixed to the Itinerary of Antonine, which was probably compiled subsequently to the year 210, in which or the succeeding year Severus died at York. Ptolemy, who wrote previously under Trajan, Hadrian, and Antoninus Pius, does not, in either of his maps, apply the term Ostia either to the Vedra or any other river in Britain ; but Antonini Itinerarium is to be preferred to the Geography of Ptolemy, as Servius' son, Cara calla, was some years in Britain himself, and seems to have had the best opportunity of any of the Roman emperors of knowing this island. It is probable that in the time of the Romans the Tyne had more mouths and outlets than one ; or perhaps Vedra has been the name both of the river Tyne and the Wear. The part that lies between the two rivers, and is bounded on each side by them, is, according to Horsley, called Werewickshire. Dr. Hunter says that this station \"cannot but have flourished till the Danish invasions, as Mr. Leland has it in its Collectanea, vol. iv. p. 43. E regione Tinemuth\u0153 suit urbs vastata a Danis, Ursa nomine, ubi natus erat Ostoinus re.v. The communication there was with Bincliester is visible in several places, as is the angle where the paved way goes off' from the military way lead ing to Lanchester, about three miles to the north of Binchester, and passes to the north-east through Brancepeth Park, thence a little to the south of Brandon, and is lost in the cultivated grounds, but appearing upon Durham moor in the same direction again, passing by Hag House, and below upon Harbrass moor is very visible, tending past Lumley Castle in a direct line towards South Shields, passing about a mile east of that of Chester-in-the-Street, without any signs of communication therewith. -f- Two elevated pavements in the river Tyne, the one at the west end of South Shields, the other on the north side of the river, near the end of the Roman wall, proper for their safe landing at different times of the ebbing and flowing tide, fully shew its necessary correspondence with Segedunum, the first station upon the Wall \" '* In 1?83, an altar was discovered amongst the foundations of part of Tynemouth Castle: \u2014 \" Jovi optimo maxima \u00c6lius Rufus pr\u00e6fectus cohortis quart\u0153 Lingonum :\" and a tablet inscribed, \" Gyrum, cumbas, et templum fecit Caius Julius Maximinus Legionis sext\u00e6 victriccs ex voto.\" These are now in the possession of the Society of Antiquaries, London; and Mr. Gough, in his edition of Camden's Britannia, supposes that they were carried to Tynemouth from the station at South Shields. But it is highly probable that the Romans maintained a fort at Tynemouth, the occupation of which being necessary to complete their military works on the sea flank. t This is probably the road described in Drayton's PolyOlbion : \u2014 \"And Rickneld, forth, that wight of Cambria's shore, Where S. Wales now shoots forth St. David's promontore^ And on his midway near did me in England meet, Then in his oblique course the lusty straggling street Soon overtook the Fosse, and towards the fall of Tin^ Into the German sea disso/u'd at his decline\""], [161, "SOUTH SHIELDS. 29 Another military way, called the Wreken Dyke, no doubt terminated at South Shields. \" It seems,\" says Horsley, \" to have come from the station, and to have crossed the marsh, then possi bly a branch of the river, not far from the station. Thence it has passed most probably through, or a little to the east of a house called Lay-gate ; from thence it seems to have gone near a house called the Barns, the garden wall probably standing on it, and so on to the Dean bridge, close by Jarrow Slake. For this space, the traces of the way are very obscure and uncertain. In the field beyond this bridge the track of it is plain, and, for near the full breadth of the inclosure, sensibly raised above the level of the rest of the ground, though it runs cross the ridges. On the west side of this field or inclosure there is a small descent, and in the bottom a lane, which is tlie high road from Bowden to Shields, and a small ascent on the other side in the field joining this lane. As the military way ascends on the one side and descends on the other, it is bent into a curve, and then falls into the right line, in which it seems to be continued all the way to Gateshead Fell, for the space of five or six miles ; from thence it goes towards Lamesley and Kibblesworth, which it leaves a little to the south. It was very visible all the way not many years ago, before Sir Henry Liddell inclosed and improved these grounds. And the gardener at Cousin's house, who formerly wrought on Gateshead Fell, assured me he had seen and helped to dig up some stones out of Wreken Dyke, which he called Bracken Dyke, so that he vyas altogether of opinion that this part of it had been paved. This way passes on towards Beamish, and I make no doubt has gone for ward to Lanchester. It is indeed lost, on the moor beyond Beamish, nor is it any great wonder it should be so, considering how mossy and soft it is.\" The Wreken Dyke formed the boundary between Gateshead Fell and Eighton Common, and passed \" the north end of the village of Eighton.\" The etymology of Wreken Dyke has been much disputed. Horsley supposes that it is derived from Warken Dyke, or Wrought Dyke, \" that is, a dyke of great labour and work, according to our northern pronunciation. It consists of firm gravel and sand, very hard and compact, so as to make a very good way at this time (1731) at all seasons of the year. I also believe it has a mixture of stone, or somewhat of pave ment.\" Hutchinson conjectures that Raken is a corruption of Raffen, the name of the Danish Standard, by which people the dyke or road might have been restored, and defended at stationary intervals by their troops, under their own national standard. Others again, with great shew of probability, suppose that the proper name is Raking Dyke ,- that is, the road in a straight line. The word is still well understood in this sense in the north, The Lawe* seems to have been always considered an important military station. Whitlock alludes to it in his Memorials, when he says the Scotch general, Lesley, \" took a great fort over against Tinmouth, which commands all ships coining in or going out of Newcastle, and five pieces pf ordinance, arms, powder, and some prisoners, and lost but nine men \" The Scots were then encamped near South Shields ; and the fort was defended by Captain Chapman, who served under the Marquis of Newcastle. The first assault, made on March 15, 1644, was gallantly repulsed. On the 19th, the Scots observed a solemn fast, and, on the following day, carried the fort by storm. There was lately a guard-house and battery of four guns on the bank facing the sea; but, soon after the peace of 1815, the guns vere removed to Tynemouth, The present large and flourishing town of South Shields, in consequence of the mischievous restrictions of a barbarous system, continued during many ages in a state of poverty and obscurity. * Lawe is a Saxon word, which generally signifies a fortified eminence- I YOL. 1."], [162, "CHESTER WARD\u2014 E. D. 30 Notwithstanding all the important natural advantages it possesses, in early times it consisted merely of a few sheds, or sheetings,* for fishermen. But the town rose gradually under the pa tronao-e of the prior of Durham ; for, in 1279, a jury sworn before John Delavale, the king's Jus tice Itinerant, found that \" the prior of Tynemouth had built a town upon the bank of the water of Tyne on one side, and that the prior of Durham had built another on the other side, where no town should stand, but only huts for fishermen.\" Previous to this trial, the prior of Durham had obtained leave of the town of Newcastle for his tenants at South Shields to brew and bake for their own use; but now, by the judgment of the court, the restrictions were rendered strict and severe. The inhabitants were prohibited from selling either bread or beer ; no ships were to be laden or unladen in the port ; nor were any shoars or quays allowed to be built. The first source of emolument to South Shields seems to have been the manufacture of salt ; but its prosperity is mainly to be attributed to the increased size of colliers, which rendered it neces sary that they should be loaded, victualled, and repaired near to the sea. In the sixteenth cen tury, a ship of one hundred tons burthen was thought a very large vessel ; and such were generally built and brought from beyond the seas. The convenience of the trade of the port, and the in creased knowledge of commerce, combined, therefore, to induce the corporation of Newcastle to relax their prohibitory laws ; and, during the last 150 years, South Shields has been steadily and progressively advancing in prosperity. The ancient part of South Shields consists of several crowded and irregular lines of buildings, running for more than a mile close to the river, and which are confined on the south and east by large hills of ballast. Many of these hills are built upon, and give the place a most singular ap pearance. The more modern part extends towards the west, and has been rapidly increased of late years. The Market-place is a good modern square, having the church on the south, with streets branching from the centres of each side of the square. In the centre stands a handsome town-hall, with a colonnade underneath. It was built by the dean and chapter of Durham about 1768. There are many commodious and well-built ranges of houses, both at the west and the east extremities of the town. The extension of improvements, and the erection of elegant houses in this town, wrould probably have been much greater, had the leases on which the land is let for building purposes been more liberal, as it is situated on a higher shore than that on which North Shields is built, on the oppo site side of the river, and is seated more commodiously for the construction of quays, ship- yards, &c. Nearly the whole of the land in both South Shields and Westoe is the property of the dean and chapter of Durham, by whom the ground is let on building leases, for a term of 21 years, renewable every seven years, by paying a sum equal to a year's rent of the buildings erected upon the respective plots; besides which, the lessees pay a yearly rent for the land, at the rate of Is. to Is. 6d. per square yard. A portion of the land in the township of Shields is glebe, and is let on leases of 999 years, for which the lessees pay the sum of 5s. for every square yard, and a yearly rent of \u00a32, 8s. for every scite containing 160 yards. * This is, no doubt, the proper derivation of its name, which is generally, at an early date, written le Sheels. Thus, we have in the north Halton-sheels, Broom-sheels, Witton-sheels, &c. which take their name from the summer residence of their herdsmen. \" Far in his lonely shiel her shepherd died.\" \u2014 Erskine."], [163, "\u25a0 M ,\\ R K K I' (' LAC K Si i IT ll Sill K |,|>.s \u25a0Is, /I, \u25a0 ,S I ,"], [164, ""], [165, "SOUTH SHIELDS. 31 The Chapel. No records exist from which the antiquity of this chapel can be deduced. It is extremely pro- bable that it is of high antiquity, perhaps nearly contemporary with the mother church of Jarrow. Some have considered it as the \" humble church dedicated to St. Hilda, which standeth nearer to the Tyne than to the Wear.\"* The earliest record of the separate rights of St. Hilda's chapelry is contained in the instrument of presentation of John de Gyseburne, by John prior of Durham, in 1402. In this evidence, the chapelry is mentioned as including Les Sheels, Harton, and Wives- ton (Westoe) ; the chaplain is to have a manse, and the lands belonging to it, like his predeces- sors, half the oblations to Holy Cross, half the offerings of wax, all the petty offerings (or surplice fees) of churchings, baptisms, and burials; the pence paid for holy bread (wafers), the St. Hilde Jish offered by the devout parishioners, and one mark pension from the master of Jarrow. -f- The chapel has received so many alterations and additions to accommodate the increasing popu lation, that very little idea can be formed of its original state. Hutchinson describes it thus : \u2014 \" The nave is twenty-eight paces in length, having to the south an aisle, formed by five short round pillars with plain capitals, supporting pointed arches, apparently of a more modern date than the columns ; the four arches eastward are uniform, but the two to the west much loftier, and of a different model : The width of the nave and south aisle is eleven paces : The aisle on the north side is new, erected in 1753, and six paces wide; the pillars are square, and arches circular, neatly stuccoed : It is galleried above the whole length, and regularly stalled below : There is also a gallery at the west end, and three small ones in the south aisle.\" In 1810 and 1311, the chapel was almost entirely rebuilt, except the steeple, the south and west walls, and part of the east wall ; the pillars forming the north and south aisle were removed, and a single roof thrown over the whole structure; the ground floor was new paved, and a handsome uniform gallery ex tended round the north, south, and west. The ceiling of the whole is handsomely stuccoed; the * Lei. Coll. iii. 30, ex vita S. Bega. t Terrier, 10 July, 180(i. \u2014 Imprimis.

It is situated on the north side ofthe chapel, fronting the east, with a small court before it, enclosed by brick pillars and pallisadoes. It consists of two parlours, two lodging-rooms, a small room, two garrets, all boarded, papered, and ceiled, together with a small kitchen and coal-house, now converted into a kitchen on the back part of tlie said house. Item, three acres of land, or thereabouts, lately demised, under an act of parliament, for nine hundred and ninety-nine years, to Ni- cholas Fairies and Henry Robson, Esquires, at the rent of one hundred and fifteen pounds, payable yearly to the incumbent for the time being (and on which there is yet only one house erected), boundering on the west by the church-yard, on the south by a road adjoining the mill-dam, on the east by a horse-road, and on the north by a street called Chapter Row. Item, the sum of ten pounds annually for a small portion of glebe annexed to the burying-ground, paid by the chapel-wardens to the incumbent on the 12th of May.

The principal subscribers were, the dean and chapter, \u00a31000; Lord Crewe's trustees, \u00a3500 ; the National School Society, \u00a3200 ; and Queen Anne's Bounty to its fullest extent. It contains a large gallery, and a great number of free sittings. It is calculated to hold about 1400 persons. The Rev. William Maughan was appointed by the dean and chapter of Durham incumbent of this chapel. Dissenting Chapels. The Dissenters in South Shields are very numerous, and possess many neat and comfortable places of worship. There has always been here, during the last 150 years, a considerable number of persons attached to the discipline of the Church of Scotland. The many vexatious restrictions imposed on strangers by the free burgesses of Newcastle, induced most of the poor, industrious adventurers from Scotland to settle in this port or at Sunderland. Hence there is a tradition of a Presbyterian meeting-house being opened in South Shields so early as the days of the Common wealth. The old Presbyterian chapel was built by a Mr. John Ware, in the year 1718, on a portion of the Military Road, or King's High-way, which was abandoned when the present passage down the Long Bank to the river was formed. From this circumstance, it became a freehold in the midst of dean and chapter property. About the year 1772, there were two candidates for the ministry in this con gregation : the one Mr. Gilhespie, and the other Mr. Hart. The friends of the latter, though formino a minority, took possession of the chapel ; but the majority, after four years of expensive litigation, recovered possession of it, on paying the ousted party \u00a350. About \u00a31000 was spent in this foolish and indecent law-suit. After this, Mr. Laidlaw and Mr. Mitchel were successively ministers. In 1786, the present minister, the Rev. Charles Toshach, was unanimously chosen, and wdio has laboured assiduously and successfully, during 44 years, in maintaining the bond of peace and unity amono-st his flock. In 1790, the old chapel was pulled down, and rebuilt on a more commodious plan, at a cost of \u00a3350, exclusive of the old materials. In consequence of the dispute mentioned above, another, the Dairy Lane Presbyterian chapel, was built in 1 779, and enlarged in 1817- It contains"], [169, "SOUTH SHIELDS. 35 200 sittings. The Rev. Joseph Matthews has discharged the pastoral functions here upwards of 42 years. The United Secession Church, East Street, is freehold, and was purchased of the Wesleyan Methodists, in 1808, for \u00a3535. Since that time, nearly \u00a3400 have been expended in improving the interior, which is now very chaste, and even tasteful. It affords accommodation for about 500 persons. The Rev. Henry Lawson is the present minister. \u2014 The Congregational or Independent Chapel, in Wallis Street, was built on glebe land, near the Market-place, in 1824, and cost above \u00a31100. It is subject to an annual ground-rent of \u00a34, 16s. payable to the incumbent of St. Hilda. The chapel, which is very neat, will contain almost 800 persons, and has attached to it a school room, in which also a Sabbath-school is ably conducted by some members of the congregation. \u2014 The Baptist Chapel, in Barrington Street, belongs to the General Baptists, and was built in 1821. It contains nearly 500 sittings, and cost about \u00a31400. Being erected on glebe land, it is subject to an annual ground-rent of \u00a37, 4s. payable to the minister of St. Hilda's church. The Rev. Robert Crook at present officiates in this chapel. \u2014 Salem Chapel, in Queen Street, was built by the Particular Baptists in 1824, and cost \u00a3821. It contains upwards of 400 sittings, and is under the ministry of the Rev. George Brown. The Wesleyan Methodist chapel, in Chapter Row, is a freehold, and was built in 1808, and cost \u00a33800. It is a handsome, substantial, and well-finished brick building, and contains sittings for 1500 persons, though there have been upwards of 2000 in it. There are 200 free seats. The society consists of about 600 members. Another Wesleyan chapel, in Shadwell Street, was opened in 1814, and contains seats for about 300 persons. There is also a small Wesleyan chapel in Temple Town, chiefly for the use of the colliers. The Methodist chapel in Johnson Street, West Holborn, belonging to the New Connexion, was originally built in 1785, and rebuilt in 1814. The interior of this chapel is very neat and commo dious, and contains 650 sittings, but will hold about 1000 persons. The Primitive Methodist chapel, in Cornwallis Street, was built in 1823, and cost \u00a31600. It is subject to the payment of \u00a37, 4s. annual ground-rent, received by the incumbent of St. Hilda. This chapel contains 600 sittings. There is a small chapel in connexion with this one, at Temple Town, near the collieryr. Charities. Christopher Maughan, by his will, bearing date 13th March, 1740, directed that after the decease of his nephew, William Maughan, \u00a3100 and the interest thereof might be applied towards the propagating of a free school in South Shields, for the education of such poor children as his trustees should think proper to send thereto. He also gave to his sister, Elizabeth Davidson, the rents and profits of his houses during her life ; and after her decease, he desired that the same might be sold, and the money arising from the sale thereof applied for the same purpose. Ann Aubone, who died about 1760, by her will directed her executors to pay the sum of \u00a3100 towards founding and supporting a charity-school in South Shields, for the education of poor children ; provided that such school should at any time within seven years after her death be set on foot and established, either by public subscription or otherwise. A school was established in South Shields about the year 1760 ; and the trustees received \u00a3100 in respect of the pecuniary legacy of Christopher .Maughan, and the further sum of \u00a3100 in lieu of the proceeds of the sale of his houses, such bequest having been void. They also received from the executor of Mrs. Aubone \u00a3100, and various other donations and benefactions, including \u00a3100 from Lord Crewe's trustees, \u00a3100 from Henry AVilkinson, Esq. and \u00a3100 subsequently bequeathed by Lockwood Broderick. In 1707. the trustees became possessed of upwards of \u00a31000, which they invested in the purchase of \u00a32004, 15s. 5d. three per cent, consols, in the names of the Rev. Richard Wallis, since deceased, Nicholas Fairies, Henry Major, and Isaac Cookson, in whose names it still stands."], [170, "36 CHESTER WARD.\u2014 E. D. About the year 1702, Ralph Redhead bequeathed, for the use of the school, \u00a3400 stock three per cent consols. The trustees were obliged to institute proceedings against the executors of Mr. Redhead for the payment of this legacy ; and, in the year 1800, a decree was obtained, ordering the executors to assign to the trustees of the school \u00a3400 stock, and to pay them the amount of the dividends which had accrued from the expiration of the first year after the death of the testator. These arrears, or the greater part of them, appear to have been paid for the expenses incurred in the recovery of the legacy. The sum of \u00a3400 stock three per cent, consols now stands in the names of the above-named Richard Wallis deceased, Nicholas Fairies, James Craster since deceased, and Henry Major. The annual dividends on the above-mentioned sums of \u00a32004, 15s. 5d. and \u00a3400 stock, amounting to \u00a372, 2s. lOd. are transmit ted to Mr. G. I. Fox, who acts as treasurer, and, when he receives them, places the amount in the savings bank at South Shields. A portion of the amount of Mrs. Glazonby's charity is also paid to the school account. The school is held in a building in Soutli Shields, erected on land held on lease under the dean and chapter of Durham. This building contains three stories; the third story having been added about thirty years ago, at an expense of upwards of \u00a3300, which was paid out of the funds of the charity. The ground floor is used for a girls' school, the second for a boys' school, and the third, except two small rooms at one end, occupied by the school-mistress, is let to a society in South Shields as a public library at \u00a310, 10s. a, year, upon condition that if at any time the society should break up, the books should become the property of the school. The management of the school is vested in the incumbent of the chapelry for the time being, and four other persons, who derive their appointment from the subscribers to the school or their representatives. An annual meeting is held on the 1st of May, notice whereof is previously given in the chapel, at which the form of electing trustees is gone through ; but as, in fact, the meeting is seldom attended except by those who acted in the preceding year, the same persons are generally re-elected. The present trustees are, the Rev. William Maughan the incumbent, Nicholas Fairies, George Potts, Henry Major, and Dr. Winter bottom. Out ofthe income above mentioned, amounting to \u00a382, 12s. lOd. exclusive of what is received from Mrs. Glazonby's charity, and money collected after sermons which are occasionally preached for the benefit of thg school, the following payments are made ; \u2014 \u00a3. _\u2022. d.

The last fine (in 1820) was \u00a325, Is. including \u00a36 for fees; but the \"dean and chapter afterwards remitted the sum of \u00a310, which was carried to the account ofthe charity. The children educated in this establishment are appointed by the trustees, to whom recommendations are sent by the original subscribers or their representatives, orphans being always preferred. None are admit ted under seven years of age, or are allowed to remain beyond the age of fourteen. The boys are taught reading, writing, and accounts, and the girls reading, writing, and needle-work; and the schoolmistress is allowed the profits arising from the work for her own use. The accounts of the different treasurers have been entered in a book kept for the purpose, but in a very confused manner; and for the five years preceding 1829, they have not been audited or signed by the trus tees at their annual meeting, as was formerly done: but in May, 1829, the trustees examined into the ac counts of the present treasurer, and they were afterwards entered in the book. From these accounts it appears that there was then a balance in favour of the charity amounting to \u00a357, 2s. 3d. of which \u00a324, 4s. 2d. was in a savings bank, and the residue in ,the hands of the treasurer. In 1812, there was a balance of \u00a3216, 14s. 5d. in the hands of Mr. Nicholas Fairies, who had acted as treasurer for several years previous. He became bankrupt about that period, but immediately signed a memorandum in the books, declaring that he would be personally liable for the debt. The whole has sub-."], [171, "SOUTH SHIELDS. 37 sequently been discharged by occasional payments in respect of the school, and small sums of money placed at different periods in the savings bank, principally between the years 1318 and 1824; and upon the ulti mate settlement of Mr. Fairles's accounts in May, 1820, it appeared that his payments had exceeded the money for which he was originally accountable, and his subsequent receipts, by the sum of \u00a314, 13s. 7_d. ; and this sum was then added as interest to the amount of his debt, so as to balance the account. Glazonby's Charity. Margaret Glazonby, widow, by her will, bearing date 21st of March, 1810, bequeathed \u00a3200 to be paid to five or more inhabitants of the chapelry of St. Hilda in South Shields, who should be nominated at a vestry meeting for that purpose, in trust ; that such persons, their executors, &c. should place the same out at interest, or in the public funds, and dispose ofthe yearly produce towards the educating and cloathing of poor children belonging to the charity-school in South Shields, in such manner as the trustees should think proper ; and it was provided that whenever two or more of the trustees should be dead, proper persons to succeed them should be elected at a vestry meeting, to be held as aforesaid. At a vestry meeting held 5th May, 1813, G. T. Fox, Joseph Bulmer (since deceased), James Kirkley, Jeremiah Archer, and Christopher Bainbridge, were elected trustees ; and it was resolved that no trustees of the charity-school should be appointed trustees for this charity. The sum of \u00a3200 was laid out in the purchase of j\u00a3375 three per cent, consols. The dividends are re ceived by Mr. Fox, who has also acted of late years as treasurer ofthe charity-school. A separate account is kept of this charity, from which it appears that the following payments have been made since 1819 :\u2014 \u00a3. s. d. June, 1820, To the trustees of tlie school towards the education of poor children 17 10 0 March, 1822, Do. do. ... ... ... ... 30 6 1 March, 1823, For cloathing theretofore furnished poor children in the school ... 20 0 0 October, same year, Do. do. ... ... ... 52 0 0 In September, 1829, a balance of \u00a321, 17s- Ud. was due from the treasurer to the charity. The trustees seem hitherto to have conceived that they were not at liberty to select any number of chil dren to be cloathed ; but that they were bound, whenever they applied any portion of the income in cloath ing, to supply the whole school. There seems, however, to be no restriction of the sort, nor any sufficient reason to suffer the income of the charity to accumulate in order to provide for so large an expenditure. Westoe Chapel and School. By indenture, bearing date August 11, 1817, aud inrolled in the High Court of Chancery, the Rev. Wil- liam Maughan, in consideration of \u00a3200, bargained and sold to the Honourable and Right Reverend James Bishop of Litchfield and Coventry, Dean of Durham, the Rev. R. G.

D. ai-d Thomas Baker, trustees nominated by the Bishop of Durham, and the Rev. Richard Wallis and three others, trustees nominated by the inhabitants of South Shields and Westoe, and their heirs, a parcel of ground (part of certain lands called Fowler's Close) situated in the township of Westoe near South shields, and containing about 39 yards square, with the building thereon erected., upon tryst, to permit the said building to he used as a school-house for the religious and virtuous education of poor children within the chapelry of St. Hilda, according to the doctrines of the Church of England, aud in reading, writing, and arithmetic, and for training them up in habits of industry, and qua- lifying them for useful occupations in life; and also to permit the same, when it should be duly consecrated, to be used as a chapel for divine service, according to the liturgy of the Church of England: and it was declared that the said trustees, or a major part of them, should have the power of appointing such persons (members of the Established Church) to be the master and mistress of the said school, and of removing them as they should see fit ; and also of appointing a fit clergyman to perform divine service in the said chapel, subject to the approbation and licence of the Bishop of Durham, and the consent ofthe incumbent of St. Hilda for the time being ; and also that they should have the power of making such rules and ordi dinances from time to time, for the government of the said school aud chapel, as they should think fit, and of appointing a local committee from amongst the subscribers to the institution; and particular directions were given for the appointment, of oe\\y trustees to represent the parties above mentioned. The chapel and .chool are still used for the purposes for which they were erected, and a national school is kept on the premises, which is supported by voluntary contributions and -the payment of weekly pence by the children.

Hood's Charity. William Hood, mariner, by his wiU, bearing date 30th of August, 1 788, gave to the curate and church wardens, and their successors for the time being, for the chapelry of St. Hilda, j\u00a320 upon trust, to place the same out at interest, and at their discretion to distribute the same, on the first day of every new year, amongst the poor people belonging to the said chapelry. The amount of this legacy is now placed in the savings bank in South Shields ; and the interest is distributed every new year's day, by the incumbent and chapel-wardens, amongst the poor, in smaU sums, varying from 3d. to ls. The South Shields and Westoe Dispensary, in East King Street, for the relief of the sick poor, was instituted in 1821, under the patronage of the dean and chapter of Durham. Since the com mencement of this institution, 4545 patients have received medical or surgical relief, and 1794 have been vaccinated. The sphere of its utility is gradually extending ; for, from February 4, 1830, to February 2, 1831, six hundred and five patients were admitted, besides three hundred and eighty casualties, and eigbtv-six children who were vaccinated.

It is supported by volun tary subscription. About 1000 afflicted claimants have been relieved since this philanthropic in stitution commenced. Amongst the charitable institutions of this town should be noticed The South Shields and Westoe Auxiliary Bible Society, established in 1820, of which Mr. Joseph Hargrave is the secre tary and keeper of the depository,"], [173, "SOUTH SHIELDS. 39 Institutions for Education and Literature. The trade and navigation of this important town require that a considerable portion of its inha bitants should be well educated. Accordingly, including Westoe, it supports twenty-two public schools, exclusive of the National and the Charity School, and of the teachers of the Fine Arts. Some of the schools are ably conducted. In South Shields there is one ladies' boarding-school, and in Westoe another. The Charity School contains 52 boys and girls ; and in the Westoe National School, conducted on Dr. Bell's system, there are at present 230 boys and 180 girls, who pay one penny a week each. The committees alluded to above, and which manage the school, consist of twelve ladies and twelve gentlemen. A Sunday-school is held in the Chapter Row Methodist chapel, in which from 3 to 400 poor children are gratuitously taught. This was the first Sunday-school established in this town, and in which upwards of 2000 children have been taught since its commencement. There is also a library attached to this chapel, consisting of 300 volumes of standard works ; likewise a juvenile library, of about 300 volumes, for the use of Sunday-scholars. There have been 1000 Bibles, 600 Testaments, and about 600 Hymn-books subscribed for by the children's weekly pence. There is, further, in this establishment, \" A Juvenile Auxiliary Bible Society,\" and \" A Lending Tract Society.\"* There is a Sunday-school in Shadwell Street chapel, in which upwards of 150 children are taught; one in Temple Town chapel, containing about 150 children; one in Reken Dyke Lane, containing 200 children, and which belongs to the Methodist New Connexion in West Holborn ; and another belonging to the Primitive Methodists, containing 70 children. To sum the whole up, not less than 1200 children are now educated in different chapels in this town. Tbe Subscription Library, in Tyne Street, commenced in the year 1803, since which time it has been progressively but slowly increasing, and now contains nearly 1400 volumes. It is supported by an annual subscription of one guinea from each member. By the 26th rule, it is enacted, that \" in case the society shall be reduced so as not to be supported by the annual income, then the books shall devolve upon the incumbents of St. Hilda's chapel, South Shields, and of Westoe Pa rochial School chapel, and the trustees of the South Shields Charity School ; and remain with them, in trust, for the benefit and use of any future re-establishment of the Library .\"-(- The Literary, Scientific, and Mechanical Institution was formed in 1825, and is held in a room in Cornwallis Street, glebe. Its object is to diffuse useful knowledge generally, but more espe cially to advance the arts, by instructing artisans in such branches as admit of practical applica tion. To bring knowledge within the reach of all classes, the subscription is fixed as low as 8s. a year. The number of members lias varied from about 150 to 200.

D. other gentlemen, a library has been collected, which at present contains about 850 volumes of very valuable works, great attention having been given in making the selection. It has also seve ral chemical and mathematical instruments. The members meet in classes, for their mutual in struction. Lectures are occasionally delivered, and papers on literary or scientific subjects are often read at the monthly meetings. For this species of instruction the society is chiefly indebted to Dr. Winterbottom, the late Dr. Thorborn, Robert Ingham, Esq. Mr. Mason, and Mr. R. Pringle, the secretary. The latter gentleman delivered a course of twenty-four lectures on the science of Chemistry, and has always been indefatigable in his exertions to advance the interests of this highly useful institution. The library is open every Monday and Friday evening, when from 70 to 80 volumes are usually exchanged by the reading members. The Exchange News-room, Town Hall, is supported by about one hundred subscribers of one guinea each per annum. Eight daily papers, and the same number of weekly papers are taken in.. Trade, Manufactures, \u00a3$c. The manufacture of salt was one of tlie most important pursuits ofthe inhabitants of this place. Lionel Bell is mentioned as having, in 1489, leased a parcel of land and two salt-pans near St., Hilda's chapel. The number of salt-pans seems to have progressively increased in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and betwixt that period and the reign of Charles. In 1667, OBe hundred and twenty-one salt-pans were assessed in the chapel-wardens' books ; and, in 1696, the number had. increased to -one hundred and forty-three.* A paper amongst Dr. Hunter's MSS. quoted by Sur tees, contains many arguments why this branch of trade ought to be cherished. This document states, that during the war with Spain and France in 1627 and subsequent years, salt sold as high as 10s. per bushel ; and when peace took place, between 2 and 300 sail of ships went to Spain for salt,. and had to pay a heavy export duty; whereas the home manufacture, if duly protected, would render England i-ndependent, for that necessary article, of either Scotland or any foreign nation. It further represents the advantages derived by the coal-owners, from the large consumption of waste coals in making salt ; and urges the great charge, cost, and pains required to bring the manufacture to perfection ; the expense of setting up salt-pans on waste and rocky parts of the river ; the da mage sustained from the hostile armies during the civil war ; and the heavy imposts of the dean and chapter, as reasons why the trade shoidd be protected. There were then 100 owners of salt-works in South and North Shields, Sunderland, and Blyth, who employed many thousand labourers. At present, there are only two salt-paras in South Shields, which pruduce about 200 tons annually. Formerly, the duty on salt-boilinp; here amounted to \u00a380,000 annually. The commerce of South Shields depends entirely upon the shipping. Not less than 264 vessels belong to the ]K>rt, averaging 240 tons each, making a total of 63,360 tons. The increase of ship ping during the last century was uncommonly rapid ; -for, about tbe year 1740, according to Hut chinson, only four vessels belonged to the port. This shipping is mostly employed in the coal trade. In times of peace, many vessels are engaged in tlie Baltic and American trades ; and, in war, several of the largest vessels are taken up for the transport service. A few good ships are employed from other ports in the private trade to India. * A tradition prevails at Shields, that when the plague r*;ged there with great violence, the persons em . ployed :bout tlie silt-works entirely escaped the infection. The same exemption from the contagion of the plague is also said to he enjoyi *d by the water-carriers and oil-men in Egypt and Turkey.

The erection of this slip has been greatly retarded in consequence of obstacles raised by the corporation of Newcastle, as conservators of the river, but which it appears are now removed. These slips combine so many advantages, that it is probable they will gradually super sede the use of dry docks. The following statement of vessels, built at South Shields from the years 1821 to 1830 inclusive, is from the Tide Surveyor's Register-books: \u2014 In the year 1821. ..10 ships. In the year 1825. ..18 ships.

A few years ago, upwards of 700 ship-carpenters were employed ; but, at present, the number that work ashore does not exceed 100. Not only are the funds of their benefit-society dissipated * On Tuesday, September 15, 1829, was launched from the buftding-yard of Messrs. Straker and Co. a very beautiful new ship, called the Isabella, of nearly 300 tons. To witness the spectacle there was one of the most numerous and respectable assemblages of persons from Newcastle, North and South Shields, and the neighbourhood, that has ever been witnessed on any similar occasion ; not only for the purpose of seeing the launch, but to witness the operation and power of Mr. George Straker's newly-invented patent wind lass, which not only equalled but surpassed the most sanguine expectations that had been formed of it. Its, relative power was tried by putting six men at the windlass to heave an anchor of 13 cwt. in the ordinary way, which they performed with some difficulty : it was then lowered down, and again hove up with the improved windlass by the power of one man, and with the addition of a boy, with comparative ease. The anchor was again lowered down, and an additional weight suspended, which was equal to 25 or 26 cwt. when eight men and boys were again put to the windlass in the ordinary way, who were not able to get a single square ; two of the men were then put to the improved purchase, and immediately hove up the weight of two anchors without difficulty. What adds most materially to the utility of this invention is, that by the ingenious though simple method employed by the patentee in working the handspike without the necessity of unshipping, all this additional power is gained without a corresponding loss of speed, which must be ad mitted to be one of the greatest improvements which has hitherto been applied to that important part of our naval machinery. Mr. B. Brown, of this place, has effected an improvement in the construction of ship-rudders, by which it is rendered impossible that they should be unshipped whde the stern holds together. vol. i.

Here are many extensive glass-works.* Near to the Market Place are three houses for the ma* nufacture of crown-glass, belonging to Messrs. Isaac Cookson and Co. ; and the cast plate-glass ma nufactory, belonging to this company, gives employment to a great number of men, and rivals every similar establishment in Europe.f The operations of grinding and polishing are performed in Newcastle. The flint-glass-works of Messrs. Shortridge, Sawyer, and Co. in West Holborn, o-ive employment to above 90 persons. There are also two houses at the Mill Dam, for the manufacture of crown-glass, belonging to Messrs. Shortridge and Co. Messrs. Cookson, Cuthbert, and Co.'s bottle-works in East Holborn, near the Mill Dam, afford employment, on an average, to from 80 to 100 men. The Jarrow Alkali Works, situated at the east end of the Slake, are carried on with peculiar spirit by the proprietors, Messrs. Isaac Cookson and Co. Nearly 200 men are employed in this manufactory. J The numerous vessels belonging to this port give employment to a great number of boat builders, block-makers, sail-makers, rope-makers, painters, coopers, braziers and tin-plate workers, anchor-makers, and ship-smiths. Not only common, but also patent rope, is extensively manufac tured here. Messrs. White and Hodgson, chain and anchor-smiths, and brass and iron-founders, Wapping Street, employ 50 men and boys here, and 20 at SwalweU. Mr. John Clark has an ex- * The Sidonians manufactured glass upwards of 2000 years before the Christian era. Some kind of glass appears to have been made by the ancient Britons ; but the art was unknown to the Saxons, until Benedict brought workmen from the Continent to make window-glass for his monastries at Monkwearmouth and Jarrow. The ancient saying, that the windows of Jarrow church are never dark, probably arose from the circumstance of their being glazed, which must have excited the astonishment of a rude people. But the elegant and useful art of glass-making seems to have been lost in the convulsions of the Danish invasion ; for the churches in King Alfred's dominions were destitute of glass windows. The first glass-works on the river Tyne were established by Sir Robert Mansel, Knt. Vice-admiral of England, about the year 1619. The workmen consisted of the refugee families of \" Hensey, Teswick, and Tyttore,\" who fled from Lorraine. Now, there is more glass manufactured on the Tyne than in all the extensive and refined kingdom of France. A few years ago, the quantity annually sold was estimated worth \u00a3500,000, and the duty paid exceeded \u00a3180,000. At present, it appears that the Tyne possesses about two-fifths of the whole glass manufacture of the kingdom. + About the year 1670, the Duke of Buckingham procured makers, grinders, and polishers of plate-glass from Venice. But this attempt seems to have failed, as all plate-glass was imported until 1773, when a joint stock company of 999 shares, of \u00a3100 each, was incorporated for 21 years, by the name of \" The Go vernor and Company of British Cast Plate Glass Manufacturers.\" Their works were established at St. Helen's, near Warrington, in Lancashire. After the expiration of their first grant, which has been twice renewed, Messrs. Quinton and Co. established a similar concern at London, which is not now in operation. Messrs. Cookson and Co. have prosecuted this business with singular spirit, and have cast plates 164 inches long and 100 broad, \" which, for fineness and brilliancy, rival, and even surpass, the most celebrated speci mens of either foreign or British manufacture.\" X Above half a century ago, Mr. Fordyce erected a large barilla-work at South Shields ; but it did not answer. Part of the buildings were afterwards converted into a soap-boilery, and are now glass-houses. In April, 1804, the extensive glass-works belonging to Messrs. Blackett and Co. at this place, were burnt down. The damage was estimated at \u00a33000 ; and on August 7, in the same year, the new and beautiful brewery at the Dean was destroyed by fire.

No seamen in the world are better fed than those employed in the coal-trade; and an astonish ing number of the very best cattle are annually killed for their use. Mr. White, a respectable butcher in Shadwell Street, has, on an average for the last five years, killed 550 oxen annually, the heaviest of which weighed 138 st. 10 lb. ; and Mr. Reed, in the Market Place, on an average of 10 years, kills 480 annually. The South Shields or Chapter Main Colliery was won by the enterprizing Simon Temple, Esq. on the ground of the dean and chapter of Durham. It was sunk to the depth of 140 fathoms; thickness of the upper seam, 3 feet 6 inches ; and the second ditto, 6 feet 3 inches. At the com mencement, 400 workmen were employed at this colliery ;-f- but the enormous sums expended on this speculation compelled Mr. Temple to stop payment, when the concern fell into the hands of Messrs. Brown of London, the present proprietors of Jarrow colliery, to whom Mr. Temple was very deeply indebted. These gentlemen sold the lease to Messrs. Devey ; but the colliery is now worked by Messrs. John and William Brandling. The coal is here called Manor Wallsend, but is known at market as Hilda Wallsend. The coal is shipped by a drop at Malting Quay. The neighbourhood abounds with excellent clay, and great quantities of bricks and tiles are made of it. There are some quarries of freestone ; but the most important geological advantages of this district consist in its extensive quarries of magnesian limestone. The Markets and Fairs of South Shields are not well attended. This is owing to the local situation of the place, and the cheapness and facility of conveying articles from the old and more central market of Newcastle. The large square in the centre of the town contains ample accom modation ; and under the Town Hall is a colonnade, where butter, eggs, &c. are exposed for sale. A weekly market is held on the Wednesday, and two fairs annually, on the 21th of June and 1st of September, pursuant to a charter granted by Bishop Trevor on the 17th of October, ITJ0, when the ancient markets and fairs were removed from the old part of the town to the present Market * By an agreement, made A.

Petty Sessions are held in the Town Hall, on the second and fourth Wednesday in every month, when two or three magistrates usually preside on the bench. But vagrants and petty offenders sometimes escape ; for, as there is no house of correction in South Shields, the sending of prisoners to Durham, to undergo a slight punishment, is attended with great expense. It would be a great public benefit to enable the magistrates to meet with instant punishment the lightest offences in the criminal law. On May 14, 1829, the royal assent was given to \"An Act for bghting, watching, cleansing, regulating, and improving the Town of South Shields, in the County Palatine of Durham.\" The commissioners appointed under this act have caused the houses to be numbered, and the streets to be repaired and kept cleaner than formerly. The town is also lighted, and a police establish ment kept up. A gas company was formed in 1825. The original capital was \u00a34000, in \u00a325 shares. The gasometer is at the Mill Dam. The town was first illuminated with gas on the 1st of October,, 1826. The two gasometers at these works are each capable of containing 8000 cubic feet of gas. Messrs. Shortridge and Co. manufacture gas for the use of their own works. The town is supplied with water by a company (incorporated by act of parliament, passed in the 28th of George III.), chiefly from Cadwell, about two miles from the town, and from a reser-. voir in Westoe Lane. Above one hundred of the inhabitants are supplied in their houses with water, for \u00a31, 6s. each per annum. The springs in this town are generally impregnated with muriate of lime in various proportions. The rate collected in the township of South Shields, for the relief and maintenance of the poor,. in 1829 amounted to \u00a33977? 17s--> which was \u00a3462, 6s. less than the amount of the preceding year. In 1829, the poor-rate levied upon the township of Westoe was \u00a31999, 17s--> making a total sum of \u00a35977? 14s. for the chapelry. South Shields poor-house is in West Holborn.

The township of South Shields is confined to a narrow slip of ground adjoining the river, covered with houses and yards, which tradesmen and mechanics find it convenient to occupy. Hence the poorer part of the population are compelled to sustain the largest portion of the bur then of the rates, while their more opulent neighbours enjoy pleasanter dwellings and easier rates in Westoe township. Ships belonging to South Shields are charged with poor-rates; but if the owners live in Westoe, they are exempted.

During the late war, when the rumour of an invasion became prevalent, an experiment Was tried to form a temporary bridge of coal-keels, which exceeded the most sanguine expecta tions.-f- After this, it was proposed to form a tunnel below the river, for the passage of people, carriages, and cattle. But chain bridges having been successfully erected over several difficult passes and ferries, Captain S. Brown, R. N. was consulted on the practicability of throwing one across the Tyne. This able engineer was sanguine of success, and proposed to commence this aerial erection at St. David's Mount, near the Library of North Shields, and to carry it over to near Westoe road, at a sufficient height above the water to admit ships to sail underneath without striking their masts ! The cost of this proposed suspension bridge was estimated at \u00a3150,000. But this bold scheme, not being sufficiently patronized, was at last totally abandoned. Still the necessity of obtaining a safe, commodious, and expeditious conveyance for carriages and persons across the river was generally admitted; and it was finally resolved to employ steam for effecting this desirable purpose. Accordingly, on March 1, 1829, the royal assent was given to an act for incorporating a company \" for making, establishing, and maintaining a ferry across the river Tyne, between North and South Shields, by the name and style of The North and South Shields Ferky Company.\":). The joint- stock of this company was limited to \u00a39950, to consist of \u00a350 shares; but they were empowered to borrow \u00a35000 by mortgage upon the credit of the undertaking. They were also empowered to erect ferry-houses and proper offices on each side of the river, and to make a commodious road-way on the north side of the river into tlie main street, and on the south side into Dean Street, communicating with the Market Place in South Shields. No person, in future, without leave from this company, can use any boat, barge, float, raft, or other vessel, of the burthen of four tons or upwards, for ferrying any carriage, horse, \u2022Cattle, or foot-passengers, for hire, across the Tyne, between the parish of Tynemouth and the Vere generally covered by loungers, who lay among the wormwood that grew there, observing every move ment in the harbour. A pit engine stood close to the present theatre ; and one of the houses a little above the wooden bridge is built over the mouth of a pit. The owners of this colliery, not being permitted to load their coals at Shields, sent them in carts to CuUercoats, where they were shipped. A small theatre stood near the Northumberland Arms, and was built of scars from the adjoining salt-pans. The extension and improvement of Shields proceeded very slowly until after the commencement of the late war ; though it is now the first town in the county for extent, elegance, riches, and population.\" \u2014 Mackenzie's Hist, of\" North umberland, vol. ii. p. 443. * January 13, 1760, in the evening, a small ferry-boat, with 12 persons in it, put off from the shore at North Shields, in order to cross the river, but, being overloaded, unfortunately sunk, and only two persons Mere saved. t On October 2, 1801, a line of keels was moored across the river near Clifford's Fort, and deals laid across them from shore to shore. Lord Mulgrave, accompanied by General Murray and other officers, first rode over from Durham to Northumberland. Soon after, his lordship returned to the Herd Sands, at the head of the 1st regiment of Royal Lancashire Militia, with their field-pieces and ammunition waggons; when a sham action took place. The troops having retired across the bridge, Major Heron (afterwards Sir Cuthbert Heron) marched the South Shields Volunteers into Northumberland. J On April 24, 1829, a public meeting was held in South Shields; when, after considerable discussion, Messrs. Fairies, Straker, Bell, Mather, Anderson, Forsyth, Wawn, and Magnay, were appointed a com mittee, to watch the progress of this bill, and to oppose any objectionable clauses."], [182, "CHESTER WARD.\u2014 E.

They are constructed like some of the American boats, having the paddle-wheels in the centre. One of the boats was, after trial, laid aside ; and it is now in contemplation to employ only one large boat and two smaller ones, which will be a decided improvement. The boat starts every half hour. This spe culation has not disappointed the hopes of the subscribers. Seamen. \u2014 Nearly 8000 seamen belong to the port of Tyne, and who are inferior to none in the world for skill, hardiness, and intrepidity. The intricate and dangerous navigation on the east coast of England requires all the attention and dexterity which a seaman can possess; and there fore the coal-trade has always been considered an excellent school for seamanship. About one-half of all the able seamen on board his majesty's fleet are North-country seamen. There are scarcely any ordinary seamen belonging to our ports. Almost every man that treads the deck of a collier is a complete seaman ,- and it is this class that constitute the very sinews and pride of our navy. But it is well known that the best seamen entertain the strongest abhorrence of the impress ser vice, and which occasionally hurries them into acts of violence. In 1777-> she impressed men on board the Union tender overpowered the crew, and, in defiance of a heavy fire from Clifford's Fort and other tenders, carried her out to sea, and 17 men left her at Scarborough. In 1793, and again in the following year, the impressed men had severe conflicts with the crew of the Eleanor tender, when many of them effected their escape. The seamen of the Tyne have also frequent disputes with their employers on account of wages. In 1768, 177-5-s 1777> an(l 1796, the trade of the port was interrupted by combinations and disturb ances amongst the seamen. In 1815, when the return of peace occasioned a great discharge of hands from the king's service, and a consequent diminution of wages, the seamen put an entire stop to the trade of the port for several weeks.-*)- Their combination was so determined and so well organized as to occasion much alarm. On the 20th of September, 7000 seamen, belonging to this port, Sunderland, and Blyth, held a consultation on CuUercoats sands. The civil power found some difficulty in acting, as the river is under the jurisdiction of the corporation of New . * The company is empowered to take the following tolls : \u2014 For every coach, chariot, chaise, hearse, or other such like carriage, with four wheels, two shillings ; and for every horse or other beast drawing the same, eight-pence.

At last, on October 24, these three commissions joined ; and the peace-officers were assisted by a party of Marines, stationed on the sand next the river and at the coble-landing : a troop of dragoons were also posted on the Bank-top, a picquet of Col. Sir Thomas Burdon's volunteer cavalry at Harton, and two sloops-of-war lay in the roads. These arrangements enabled the magistrates to break up the combination, when nearly 200 vessels pro ceeded to sea. On this occasion, Nicholas Fairies and Robert Green, Esqrs. the acting magistrates for South Shields, received the thanks of the Prince Regent; and an elegant piece of plate was presented to each of these gentlemen from the \" Maritime and Mercantile Insurances.\" Pilots. \u2014 The sea-pilots of this port reside mostly near the Lawe, at the eastern extremity of the town. From intermarrying almost exclusively in each other's families, they form quite an iso lated clan. \" Their ability, as well as steady courage in tlie management of vessels leaving or entering the port, is admirable, and has excited the attention of every officer of the royal navy who has witnessed their exertions.\" In fact, their skilful daring cannot be surpassed. The pilots have always been under the peculiar jurisdiction of the Trinity House of Newcastle.* This corporation, in March, 1803, elected a new officer for superintending the pilots in this place. -f His salary was fixed at \u00a3200 per annum, to be paid out of a toll of 6d. on each ship in and out. The surplus is applied for a fund for relieving maimed, disabled, or distressed pilots, or their widows. The Pilot-office is at the low end of Shadwell Street. Mr. Thompson, of King Street, is the present master of the pilots. There are, at this time, 115 sea-pilots. Insurances.\u2014 Some ship-owners of this port, in 177*8, established a Mutual Ship Insurance Company, which plan was found so useful, that almost all the vessels in the coal-trade are now insured in that manner. A certain number of ship-owners agree to insure a given sum on each other's ships ; and when a lass happens, the sufferer receives the amount insured on his ship from the other members, who pay in the same proportion as their own ship was insured. No premium * The Trinity House, in 1756, ordered the pilots to assist Captain Taylor to impress seamen. In 1794, the House resolved to prosecute any officer in his majesty's service who should impress any pilots of their branches. In 1 798, the House built a gun-boat, that carried one eighteen-pounder, for the defence of the harbour ; and in July, 1803, the pilots were enrolled as a corps of Sea Fencibles, in obedience to the request of the House. T The office of Ruler of Pilots upon the river was instituted in 1720. In 1657, it was ordered, that \"if any brother take upon himself to pilot anv ship whatever on tlie Lord's Day, he shall pay, every time so offending, the sum of 20s. !\" On a representation being made to parliament, in 1800, that the pilotage fixed by the charter of James II. had become an insufhcieut compensation for the labour, peril, and industry of the pilots, a bill passed, in the session of 1801, authorising the Trinity House to augment their lightage, buoyage, and pilotage, and to make various regulations. The average annual income of the Trinity House of Newcastle, for the six years ending with 1817, was \u00a33233, 18s. id., and is gradually increasing. After giving a summary of the proceedings and accounts of this society for many years, in the History of Newcastle, published in 1827, the following note is ap pended : \u2014 \" The Board, on being applied to for a continuance of the accounts for the last few years, refused to give such information, alleging that the publication of their accounts was unprecedented, and contrary to the oath of secresy taken by the members of the Board- But as the act of parliament, obtained by this house in 1801, was granted in consequence of representations founded upon a public statement of their ac counts, it is evident that the oath of secresy does not extend to their pecuniary concerns, but must be con fined to the Free Masonry of navigation. Indeed, no corporate body, who levy duties upon the public, can be justified in concealing the particulars of their receipts and disbursements. However, the progress of liberal ideas must soon destroy the old, suspicious, and useless affectation of concealment.\" VOL. I. O"], [184, "50 CHESTER WARD.\u2014 E. D. is given, the consideration being the risk each takes upon the other. A similar mode of insurance is adopted with resp.ct to freights and cargoes. Nine of these associations for mutual insurance* in this port, during the late war, insured the vessels of their members against risk by sea, capture, &c. to the amount of \u00a3747,000 : the value of the vessels insured would exceed this sum 10 per cent. There are the following Ship Assurance Associations in South Shields : \u2014 The Unanimous, Nautical, Cargo 3, and Caroo 4, of which Mr. George Potts is the secretary ; the Maritime and the Mercantile, Mr. William Teller, secretary; the Coal Trade, of which Mr. Thomas Adams is secretary ; and the South Shields Premium, Mr. Joseph Wilson secretary. The ship owners of this place are distinguished for their knowledge in all those affairs that concern the shipping interest ; yet there are some who imagine that the insuring system is carried to too great an extent, so as to occasion some degree of negligence and indifference respecting the safety ot vessels at sea.* The inhabitants of both North and South Shields have long complained of the serious inconve niences and losses they suffer, arising from the want of an independent custom-house at the mouth of the Tyne.-f- A vigorous effort was made to establish a branch custom-house at North Shields in 1816 ; and deputations were sent from that place and Newcastle, for the purpose of conferring with his majesty's ministers on the subject. After much discussion, the Lords of the Treasury finally refused to erect a branch custom-house at Shields, but ordered that such masters of colliers as wished should be permitted to sign the coast bond at that place. Circumstances appearing more favourable under the Wellington administration, another attempt was made by the ship owners of Shields to obtain the privilege of a distinct custom-house ; but the Lords of the Trea sury again decided against making any alteration in the mode of conducting the customary business of the port. The dangers attending the navigation at the entrance of the Tyne were formerly unnecessarily increased, in consequence of the injudicious situation of the leading lights. This was so convinc ingly stated by the venerable Henry Taylor,j of North Shields, at a meeting of shipowners held * The loss of shipping on the east coast of England is frequently very afflicting. On January 18, 1673, 39 ships were wrecked on the coast of Northumberland alone. About the close of 1789, 23 ships and about 300 seamen were lost on the Norfolk coast ; and, at the beginning of 1800, no less than 69 out of 71 ves sels, coal-laden from Shields and Sunderland, were wrecked on their passage to London. On November 9, 1810, 26 vessels were wrecked on Sand Hole, on the Lincolnshire coast; and in February, 1831, above 24 ships were wrecked between Shields and Blyth, a distance of 9 miles. But it would be endless to re count all the disasters suffered by the shipping of the port. + The \" Cockettum,\" or custom-house of Newcastle, is first mentioned in 1281. The customs of the port of Tyne at present exceeds four hundred thousand pounds per annum ! % This worthy gentleman was bred a seaman, and was one of the early friends of the celebrated Captain Cook, but afterwards became a ship-broker in North Shields, where he joined the Society of Friends. He published a plan for making Hasbro' Gatt a safe night passage, by placing two leading lights near Hasbro' church and a floating light at the north end of the Newarp Sand. This being adopted, he suggested the floating light at the north end of the Goodwin Sands ; also the light at the east end of the Sunk Sand, to facilitate the passage up and down the Swin. In 1792, he published instructions for managing ships at single anchor, which was officially recommended by the Trinity Houses of London and Hull. This was followed by a few general rules for sailing, and a short address to seamen. The only reward he received for these invaluable services was \u00a3500 from the Trinity Board, and afterwards \u00a3100 per annum. The cor poration and Trinity House of Newcastle also presented him with \u00a3100. After struggling with many pecuniary difficulties, he died on February 20, 1823, aged 85 years. In 1811, Mr. Taylor published Me moirs of his own life. -"], [185, "SOUTH SHIELDS. 51 March 2, 1805, that it was resolved to obtain an act of parliament for the building of two light houses. This, after many difficulties, was effected by the Trinity House; and the new light houses were first illuminated in May, 1810. The cost of this improvement was estimated at \u00a312,000; and the income arises from one halfpenny per ton on the ships in the port of New castle. There are directing marks for vessels entering from the northward, erected upon the Lawe at South Shields. Life-boat. \u2014 The honour of inventing and establishing a Life-boat belongs to this place. Many melancholy and heart-rending scenes were witnessed at the entrance of the harbour. In Septem ber, 1789, the Adventure of Newcastle was stranded on tlie Herd Sands, in the midst of tremen dous breakers ; and the crew dropped, one by one, from her rigging, exhausted by cold and fatigue ; while thousands of spectators stood looking on, without daring to venture to their assistance. In consequence of this distressing spectacle, the gentlemen subscribing to the Lawe House News-room formed a committee, consisting of Messrs. N. Fairies (the chairman), Michael Rockwood, Cuthbert Marshall, H. Heath, W. Masterman, and Joseph Roxbv, for the purpose of constructing a boat calculated to brave the dangers of the sea, particularly broken water. Various models and drawings were submitted to the consideration of the committee ; but none of them met their ideas. One was presented by Mr. Flenry Greathead, a boat-builder, and another by Mr. William Wouldhave. The latter was of tin (copper was recommended for the boat), rendered buoyant by cork, and incapable of being overset. He received a guinea for this ingenious model ; and it was resolved to compensate Mr. Greathead for his trouble, by employing him to build such a boat as they should determine upon. The committee was unanimous that a boat resembling a Norway yawl, with both ends alike, having great spring or elevation at the bow and stern, and with the bottom flatter, might answer the purpose. Mr. Rockwood made a model in clay of a boat by which he had been saved at Memel, which, after having been handed about and altered, was the form finally adopted,' When the keel was about to be laid, Mr. Greathead proposed a curved keel ; an idea suggested by the properties of the spheroid. Its dimensions were, length 28 feet, breadth (inside measure) 9 feet, height 2 feet 6 inches or upwards. The utility of the Life-boat was first proved on the 30th of January, 1790, when it put to sea for the purpose of rescuing some mariners who were the sport of the tempest in tlie offing. A number of cork jackets were provided for the crew, in the event of the boat disappointing the ex pectations of the committee, and failing in its object ; but the precaution was unnecessary. \u25a0\" Floating like a feather upon the water, it rode triumphantly over every raging surge.\" The vessel was approached in defiance of the elements; and the wretched crew, equally affected with astonishment and gratitude, obtained a safe refuge from the tremendous abyss that was opening to receive them in the Life-boat. Never was name more happily imagined, or more appropriately bestowed. Since that time, many hundreds of \" brave fellows\" have been rescued from destruc tion by this benevolent and successful invention, \" which has risen like a new Iris, an ark of faitli and hope, to the gallant seaman struggling with the horrors of a lee shore.\"\"* _ * In 1798, the Duke of Northumberland presented to the town of North Shields a Life-boat House, near the Watch House adjoining Clifford's Fort, with an annual subscription of \u00a320 for the support of a Life boat. Boats of this description, with various alterations and improvements, were soon after adopted in almost every port of Great Britain, and in many of the most considerable ports on the Continent. Mr. Greathead, in consequence, obtained considerable employment in the building of Life-boats, and received many flattering compliments from persons ofthe highest rank; in particular, a gold ring from the Emperor"], [186, "CHESTER WARD\u2014 E. D. 52 The Life-boat House is situated on the sands, a little beyond the end of Pilot Street, and near to the Lawe House. This building was commenced in September, 1789 ; and in the following October, Wright's John and a sloop from Kinghorn came upon the Herd Sands, and their crews were the first that found a comfortable refuge in the Boat House.* Many important improvements have been recently made in the construction of the Life-boat. In some instances, the South Shields boat has, in one trip, been thrice filled with water. This is now obviated by a copper pipe being placed in the false deck, which communicates with the sea, and by which water is instantly carried off' without either trouble or danger. Mr. George Farrow has just built a new boat to replace the old one; and Mr. Edward Robson has finished an admi rable boat intended for Cromer. They are both boat-builders iu South Shields. . of Russia. In 1802, parliament voted him a grant of \u00a31200, the Humane Society a medal, and the Trinity House expressed their approbation by presenting him with 100 guineas. Yet, strange to say, Mr. Great head, notwithstanding these grants and the extension of his business, actually became a bankrupt. Mr. Greathead's claim to the honours and rewards lavished upon him was disputed in many newspapers and periodical magazines; and Mr. Hailes, a mathematician in Newcastle, who is practically acquainted with the principles of marine architecture, published a pamphlet in vindication of the claims of Mr. Would have to priority of invention. It was affirmed that Greathead's model \" had no resemblance to the Life boat,\" and that, on being submitted to the ordeal of water, it floated bottom up. Mr. Wouldhave himself compared it to \" a butcher's tray or a tailor's lapboard.\" Mr. Hailes contended that Wouldhave's model embraced the two essential properties of the Life-boat, viz. buoyancy, and capacity of always floating with the convex surface below; and that the addition of a curved keel (which Mr. Fairies approved of) is an error in the construction, and the only deviation which Mr. Greathead ventured to make from it. Would have himself made some feeble efforts to enforce his claim to the merit of the invention ; but, in consequence of his poverty, his versatility, and, above all, the violence of his language, he was not attended to. Hia model is suspended to the chain ofthe chandelier in St. Hilda's chapel. William Wouldhave was a native of North Shields, where he served his apprenticeship to a painter. He was distinguished for his fertility of invention and eccentricity of manners ; but the versatility of his mind prevented him from rising in the world. Gay and careless, he cared not for to-morrow. When some of his friends blamed him for leaving his model of the Life-boat at the Law House, when the committee seemed resolved not to adjudge him the reward, he replied, \" Never mind, never mind ; I know they have sense enough to adopt the good properties of my model ; and though I am poor, if they refuse to give me the re- ward, I shall still have the satisfaction of being instrumental in saving the lives of some of my fellow- creatures.\" Indeed, he never thought of claiming any other reward. \" Always employed,\" says Mr. Hailes, \"yet always changing the employment. Sometimes arguing on music with the organist, and philosophizing at other times with a keelman. As honest as he is poor, and almost as communicative as he is ino-enious, he contented himself with the idea of being allowed to be the inventor by all the unprejudiced inhabitants of Shields.\" His mechanical genius was often usefully employed. He suggested an important improvement in the building of docks; and he weighed up a ship that had been sunk, and was abandoned, at the mouth of the harbour. He amused himself by constructing various curious instruments, amongst which were an organ, a clock, and an electrical machine. He was many years clerk of St. Hilda's chapel, at South Shields \u25a0 and died, poor and neglected, on September 28, 1821, in the 70th year of his age. The figure of his pro- posed Life-boat is cut upon his tomb-stone- * In December, 1824, a branch society was formed, called \"The Port of Newcastle Association for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck,\" but which has not received all the support it merits. The commit tee attended a trial of Captain Manby's apparatus at South Shields, on November 24, 1829. They have very recently attached a Life-boat truck or carriage to the Life-boat at Boulmer. The construction is ex cellent, and resembles one that has been for some time in use at Sunderland. The Royal National Asso ciation for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck has, according to their official report, saved the lives of upwards of 1446 persons from 1824 to 1829 inclusive. The Blyth Life-boat, being constructed of improper materials, was stove to pieces by a heavy sea on April 3, 1810, when 26 men perished."], [187, "SOUTH SHIELDS. 53 Ship Life-boats. \u2014 This place has also the honour of originating an invention by which the means of safety, in cases of shipwreck, is put into the hands of mariners themselves. Mr. James Mather, in 1826, gave directions to a builder in South Shields to construct a boat uniting the qualities of a life and a ship-boat. Its length was 20 feet, and extreme breadth 8 feet 2 inches, including projecting gunwales on each side 7 inches broad. These gunwales formed the upper side of air boxes which ran down the side 1 foot 4 inches, when another projecting plank formed the under side of the upper tier of boxes, strengthened it, and afforded protection to a tier of boxes below, which gradually joined the boat's side underneath. The whole space for air was divided by light wood into sixteen compartments, which not only strengthened the boat, but, in case of being stove in this part, would prevent the injury from extending beyond the actual point of contact. Though this boat was built with extraordinary care, and of choice materials, the expense was only \u00a310 beyond the cost of an ordinary boat of the same size. This boat was tried on May 26. It was first filled with water, and then weights to the amount of 18 cwt. were placed in it, which it bore without sinking. Half a ton was placed on one gun wale, yet the water did not find its way over the side ; and it weighed an ordinary-sized collier's anchor with ease. What is called a six-feet sea was breaking across the bar with tremendous violence; but it rose \"like a sea-gull,\" as the pilot emphatically expressed it, over the broken water. After resting at Tynemouth Haven, the crew returned, and, in the triumph of confidence, occasionally laid the boat's broadside parallel to the billows. On reaching the Herd Sand, the pilot, observing a prodigious wave bearing down, threw the boat beneath it ; but, instead of being buried in its vortex, only a thin sheet of water came down, which it was not necessary to bale out. The boat was next put before the sea, rather a dangerous situation ; when the crew returned to port after this complete and successful trial. In order to avoid the present awkward and ill-devised mode of lowering the boat over the ves sel's side, which in a rough sea exposes it to the danger of being stove, Mr. Mather invented a launching frame of the most simple construction, and with which he himself in one minute launched a boat, with four men on board, from a vessel called the Mary, belonging to his father.* The objections that have been urged against these inventions are extremely absurd. Seamen will never hasten to abandon their vessel, merely because the means of safety are at any time within their reach. Harbour. \u2014 The difficult entrance into the harbour has been adverted to. On the north side, the fatal rocks called the Black Middens, and on the south side the Herd Sands, confine the chan nel of the river, which is here called the Narrows. Within this, the river expands into a capacious bason, capable of containing upwards of 2000 sail of large ships ; and, during spring tides, ships of 500 tons burthen can enter. The water is deepest at the west end of South Shields, where most of the largest vessels are loaded. The average rise of springs at Shields is about 14 feet 3 inches, and the average rise of neap tides 8 feet 10^ inches. The velocity of the current of the flowing tide above Shields Narrows is about 3 knots per hour at half-flood ; but at half-ebb the current is about 3J knots per hour, The tides rise to a little above Newburn, about 18 miles * Mr. Mather's boat was tried at Copenhagen, and he received the thanks of the Danish Admiralty for his invention. Mr. Thompson Pearson, of this place, has invented a new patent rudder; and Mr. J. Rennoldson, an ingenious millwright, has obtained a patent for a new Rotatory Steam-engine. He has also proposed some material improvements in the paddles of steam-boats. VOL. X. P"], [188, "54 CHESTER WARD.\u2014 E. D. distant from the Ijay. According to Dr. Rotherham, they commonly flow about four hours and & half, and ebb about seven hours and a half, at Newcastle bridge. Tlie ignorance, inattention, and avarice of the corporation of Newcastle, in their character of conservators of the river, has frequently been the subject of earnest and bitter complaint. In 1816, the corporation were so far roused to a sense of their duty as to employ the late Mr. Rennie to make a survey of the river. That able engineer, in his report, says, \" There is, perhaps, no river in Great Britain on which it is more difficult to give a satisfactory opinion, as to the best mode of improving its navigation, than the river Tyne. In this river, not only is great depth wanted, but likewise great width to accommodate the immense numbers of ships which resort to it. These two qualities, however, are incompatible with each other. If the width of the river were to be contracted by a solid embankment, its depth would be increased ; but then the space for the accommodation of shipping would be lessened ; and as a less quantity of tide water would thereby be admitted, it would have less effect in keeping down the bar. But this is not all ; for when ships are working into the harbour with an adverse wind and flowing tide, there would be less current to carry them across the bar ; so that in gaining depth of water in the channel of the river, care must be taken that the depth on the bar be not diminished. A solid embankment on the side of the river must therefore be avoided, or at least limited to a certain extent, and other means devised to effect the object. But to both there is a limitation ; and therefore it becomes a nice point to settle with precision what depth can be obtained and maintained in the river Tyne, between its mouth and Newcastle bridge, without contracting it to a degree that may prove mate rially injurious to the navigation.\" In considering the best means of improving the harbour, and increasing the depth of water over the bar, Mr. Rennie recommends only a partial removal of \" the Middle Ground\" and \" In-sand,\" so as to render access easy, without admitting too much swell into the harbour. A pier on the Herd Sand he considers of the greatest importance. The expense of improvements, as far as con cerns the harbour, he estimates as follows : \u2014 To a pier on the Herd Sand ... ... ... ... .... ... \u00a3218,011 To a new wall from Moon Stairs to Bottle House Landing, including filling the space within... 115,762 To a new wall from Walton's salt-works to the south end of the High Docks, including the filling of the space within ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 12 430 To a new quay wall from the Low Lights Shore in North Shields to the steam-mill, including the filling the space within ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 34,110 o \u2014 * \u2014 1 \u2022\u25a0 \u2022\u25a0\u2022 \u25a0\u2022\u25a0 \u2022\u2022\u25a0 \u2022\u2022\u2022 \u2022\u2022\u2022 \u2022\u25a0\u2022 i\u00ab,ilV To building 4 substantial jetties along the Droitwich Sand to near Whitehill Point ... ... 2,316 To cutting away Whitehiil Point and sands at do. .. ... ... ... ... 6,702 \u00a3389,331 Mr. Rennie calculated that a saving of \u00a380,000 would accrue from the wharfs and sands gained at North and South Shields.* This would reduce the expense to \u00a3309,331 ; and as mason-work * \" Mr. Rennie seemed to think that a fund sufficient for executing the works he recommended might be raised by an act of parliament. At Sunderland, by a very small tax on shipping, astonishing things have been done- The course of the river has been turned, rocks have been torn up from the bottom of it, expen sive and extensive piers have been erected, and where there was only 5 or 6 feet water, there are now 14 or 15. The Clyde has also been wonderfully improved, where there is a dredging machine that raises 1200 tons of gravel a day. A similar machine on the Humber raises 50 tons of mud per hour. Nothing has lately been done by the corporation of Newcastle for the river ; although that body has, during the last"], [189, "SOUTH SHIELDS. 55 is executed so cheaply, and as ballast for the filling up could be procured with such facility,* perhaps the whole expense at the present time would not exceed \u00a3250,000. There are no wet-docks at Shields, and sometimes the harbour is crowded to excess ; and, during floods, much damage is often sustained by the shipping. f At the western extremity of South Shields there was a fine bay or inlet, called the Mill Dam, >vhich Smeaton, the architect of Eddy stone Light-house, observed was well adapted for a wet-dock \u00ab that would hold a great number of ships.; But this once invaluable opportunity is now lost for ever to the port of Tyne ; for the corporation of Newcastle, as Conservators of the river, in spite of all remonstrances to the con trary, ordered the Dam to be filled up with ballast. Jarrow Slake.\u2014 -This vast watery expanse still remains, and offers the most admirable facilities for the formation of wet-docks. Some, however, doubt the utility of embanking the Slake, be cause the tide-water it now receives increases the velocity of the current, while it is being covered nearly one quarter of a mile per hour, which is of great advantage to the shipping, us it helps them over the bar, particularly in an adverse wind.\u00a7 A gentleman, who has long and deliberately considered the subject, expresses himself thus in a communication to the editor :\u2014 three years, derived a revenue of \u00a371 ,764, Ils. 2]d. from it, out of which \u00a322,472, 14s. 6d. have been paid for conveying 574,128 tons of ballast.\" - . \" \" The corporation, as conservators of the Tyne, appoint a River Jury, to whom the following oath is admi- nistered :\u2014 ' You swear that you shall from time to time, as often as there shall be just cause, true present- ment make of all nuisances done in this port of Newcastle upon Tyne, between Sparrow Hawk and Hedwin Streams, in the river of Tyne; and you shall do this at the admiralty, before the mayor recorder and aldermen of the said town, for the time being, and that without all respect of love or hatred to the pe'rsons so offending. So help you God.' This jury, which is mostly composed of persons under corporate influence or of such as are totally incompetent for the office, has become a standing jest to the public. If they do make any representations, they are not attended to by the conservatory court.\" \u2014 Mackenzie's Hist, of New castle, p. 742 et seq. ' J * At least 200,000 tons of ballast is every year brought into the port of Tyne. The Jarrow Ballast Hills cover 34 acres, 0 r. 22 p., and rise 102 feet at the highest elevation. By a\" curious calculation, now before the writer, they contain 3,267,000 tons. t Formerly, 2 or 300 sail of loaded colliers were often wind-bound during several weeks ; but since steam-boats were employed in towing vessels to sea, such delays seldom occur now, and never but for a very short time. Vessels always sail when there exists the least' chance of making progress at sea. The first steam-packet on this river was named the Tyne, and vommenced its course May 19, 1814. Nearly forty steam-boats are now employed on the river, or in towing vessels over the bar. On December 30, 1815, upwards of 30 vessels were drifted from their moorings by the violence of a flood, and driven on the Herd Sand. Several keels were also blown to sea. Great damage was sustained frofn a similar cause on February 9, 1831, when about 50 sail broke from their moorings; and had the ice not been carried away before the flood, the consequences would have been still more serious. % It was afterwards suggested' that a sea-canal, from this place to the south side of the Lawe, might be cheaply and advantageously formed, through which vessels might safely enter or sail in almost any wind. \u00a7 Mr. Giles, from soundings, calculated that the whole quantity of water in the Tyne, between Shields Narrows and the Tyne bridge, at the low-water of the 31st of May, 1813, was about 214. 262.000 cubi- feet, and th;.t, at high-water on the same day, it was about 940,883,000; thus leaving 726,621,000 cubic feet for the quantity of tide-water thrown into the above district. Mr. Rennie estimated that the tide-water covered 1344 acres, and that the jetties and embankments which lie proposed would reduce it to 896 acres To supply, in some measure, this deficiency, lie proposed to deepen the several sand-banks, and 21 acres of sand in Jarrow Slake, which is nov>- dry at three-quarters ebb."], [190, "56 CHESTER WARD\u2014 E. D. \" This extensive waste lays between South Shields and Jarrow, and is estimated to contain a space of nearly 1000 acres, covered at spring tides with water. It is said that formerly the tide always flowed over it ; but the continual deposit of sand and mud from the river has caused it, even within the recollection of persons now living, to rise considerably, and to be now much above the level of high-water at neap tides. The right which the corporation of Newcastle claims to the conservatorship of the river Tyne, wherever the tide is found to flow, leaves to their judgment the propriety of filling up the Slake, or converting it to any useful or profitable purpose ; and the mistaken idea that its embankment would prove injurious to the river, combined with the circumstance of the corporation's right in it passing away to the proprietors of the soil upon its being filled up, have conduced to prevent this present barren and useless morass from being ren dered a source of great benefit to the port, and of employment to thousands of individuals. It is now almost the unanimous opinion of nautical and scientific men, that the flow of the tide up the river would be increased by obstructing its influx into Jarrow Slake; and the formidable sands and mud-banks, which now render the navigation up to the town of Newcastle so dangerous for ships of very moderate burthen, would, in consequence, be materially diminished, and the trade of the town greatly benefited, by allowing vessels of a larger tonnage to discharge there. \" The good citizens of Glasgow have evinced greater penetration on this point, and, proceeding upon the system of banking up the shores ofthe Clyde, can now boast of ships of increasing bur then delivering at their wharfs, and thereby bringing the enlarged trade of the river to their own town, which otherwise would have been confined to those towns possessing superiority of situation, from being nearer the mouth of the Clyde. It has been a matter of general observation, that Jarrow Slake, from its situation as contiguous to Shields and the entrance of the river, is admira bly adapted forthe formation of wet-docks; the want of which, with adequate warehouse esta blishments to meet the extending trade of the port, is now beginning to be seriously felt. It would be difficult to find a situation in any river where wet-docks could be constructed with greater facility, or at an easier expence ; and wben we see new manufactories rising in the neighbour hood in every direction, new collieries sinking, the yearly shipment of coals invariably increas ing, rail-roads forming to connect the west of England with the river Tyne, and the shipping so augmented as to cause the port to be second only to London in point of tonnage, the necessity of adopting a plan of this kind becomes a matter of most serious consideration, particularly as the very limited conveniences afforded by the quays and warehouses at Shields and Newcastle, now so great a subject of complaint with the merchants, are totally inadequate to the probable extent of the trade and commerce which it is presumed will be carried on in the port of Newcastle, which ought, from its local situation and general advantages, to become the great emporium of the Baltic trade. \" Should the corporation of Newcastle be induced to act upon a more liberal principle than they have hitherto adopted with regard to their general arrangements in the conservatorship of the river, which has prevented much improvement, and also reduce the rates and charges which bear so heavily upon the shipping and coal-trade of the port, there is little doubt but several extensive collieries would bring their coals down to the Tyne, instead of shipping them on the river Wear, which is too small for the extent of business now carried on there. This would be an additional benefit to the port and trade of Newcastle ; and when the spirit of the age is so decidedly unfa vourable to the continuation of the monopolies of corporate bodies, \u2014 as it is found that the neces sity for their institution, which might be adapted for more barbarous ages, does not exist at the"], [191, "SOUTH SHIELDS. 57 present time, \u2014 it is sincerely to be hoped that the corporation of Newcastle will consider these circumstances, aid all in their power the progress of improvement in their own particular district, and be guided in their measures by the general good resulting to the community at large, without regard to the interest of a few individuals only, who benefit by the present system.\" Rail-road. \u2014 The proposed rail-way from Bladon to South Shields is certainly a measure emi nently calculated to increase the commerce, riches, and population of the port, and will, it is hoped, receive that support which its paramount importance to this district so peculiarly deserves. \" It is intended that the line should commence at or near to the village of Bladon, at such a point as will be most conveniently adapted to form a communication with the Newcastle and Car lisle railway, and from thence proceed, on the south side of the Tyne, to Gateshead, and pass through that place, and then proceed to South Shields in the most eligible direction that local circumstances will admit of. The distance of the proposed line, from the point of commencement to that of its termination, will not exceed thirteen miles and a half ; and the estimated expense of the whole, exclusive of engines and carriages, is \u00a370,000 ; the estimate for the engines, carriages, and other unforeseen contingencies, is \u00a310,000, making together \u00a380,000, \u2014 which sum it is pro posed to raise in 1600 shares of \u00a350 each ; and calculations have been made as to the traffic that may reasonably be expected, which seem fully to warrant its being stated, that an ample return will accrue to the shareholders for the capital required. \" In the construction of the road, it is almost needless to state that the most approved principles will be adopted, and the most efficient locomotive engines and best adapted carriages provided} and the passage, from the commencement of the line to Shields, will be made with great ease in three quarters of an hour, and from Gateshead to Shields in half an hour. \" It is difficult to make a very accurate estimate of all the sources of income to be expected from such a road ; though it is easy to foresee that many unexpected sources would manifest themselves, as the facilities for extending internal communication and intercourse become developed. \" The income from the conveyance of coals is at present considered to be the most important ; as the advantage of shipping, below bridge, the coals in a district comprising 126 square miles, lying to the west of Gateshead, would, by means of this railway, be of easy attainment by the proprietors of such coal, a great many of whom have hitherto looked in vain for the means of ob taining such advantage ; and it is presumed that it is not too much to say, that the probable in come to be derived from the conveyance of coals alone, would be much more than sufficient to pay the interest of the required capital. Another important source of income may be stated to be the conveyance of home-grown or ship timber, large quantities of which are virtually excluded from any profitable use to the owners, for want of the means of conveyance, at any reasonable expense, from the places of growth to those of consumption, a great many of the latter of which places are contiguous to the line of the proposed railway ; and the back carriage of foreign timber and deals, for building and manufacturing purposes, is of an importance which may be appreciated, from the large quantities carried into the interior of the country by the present tardy and expensive mode of conveyance.\" The conveyance of lead, iron-stone, and manufactured iron, would doubtless form an important source of revenue; and a share of the profit which the Newcastle and Carlisle radway will obtain by the conveyance of agricultural produce, and of Welch and Westmoreland slates, would be en joyed by tlie promoters of this branch. Indeed, this railway would offer the cheapest and most expeditious transmission of merchandise to the towns on the eastern coast. The conveyance from V0L< I. Q"], [192, "58 CHESTER WARD.\u2014 E. D. Shields to the western districts of ship-manure, and of the excellent lime and limestone that abound iu the neighbourhood, with the conveyance of passengers from and to Newcastle and its vicinity, and from South Shields and Sunderland of those persons induced by pleasure or business to visit Liverpool, Manchester, or any place in that direction, would constitute a certain and very consi derable source of income. This projected railway embraces so many desirable advantages, that it must be ultimately adopted, though the measure is not to be brought before parliament this session. However, the survey of the line has been completed, the plans prepared, and other requisite preliminaries adopted. Before the measure is regularly brought before the House of Commons, it is to be hoped that a branch of the proposed line will be extended to the populous and commercial town of Sunderland. The country is level, and presents no serious obstacles to the formation of a rail way ; and, with this addition, its utility and productiveness would be almost doubled, while the co-operation and support of gentlemen connected with the port of Sunderland would soon carry the plan into effect.* Westoe. \u2014 This township, anciently called Wyvestotv, contains 1539i acres of leasehold, and 63^ acres of freehold land. The leasehold property, which includes a valuable portion of South Shields, was part of the ancient possessions of the cell of Jarrow. On part of the freehold grounds belonging to Robert Green, Esq. and near to Westoe chapel, several good houses have been re cently built. The greater part of the freehold property belongs to the Ogles of Kirkley, co. of Northumberland. Ogle Terrace presents an uniform row of excellent houses, ornamented with gardens, &c. ; and being situated on a rising ground, at a distance from the smoke and smell of the numerous works which crowd the west suburbs of Shields, it has become a genteel place of residence. Westoe village stands pleasantly upon the heights above Shields, and contains a number of ele gant houses. Formerly, it was one mile distant south-east from the Ferry-boat Landing ; but the new buildings, which are rising rapidly upon the freehold lands mentioned above, will soon con nect it with the town of Shields. Jarrow Lodge, the property and residence of John Straker, Esq.-f- stands on the southern extre mity of Jarrow Slake. Opposite to the house a quay has been built, and a good road formed by ballast, 30 feet broad, which now, after some dispute, has been admitted to belong to the town ship. On the side next the Slake it is protected by a railing, erected at Mr. Straker's expense. The turnpike road from South Shields to the White Mere Pool has also been recently much im proved ;+ and the bridge over the Done, formerly so narrow and inconvenient, is now so broad and well paved as to be considered one of the best in the county. * A petition has just been forwarded to the Commons House of Parliament, stating the claims of this town to be represented in the Honourable House. + Mr. Straker has in his museum a specimen of nearly all the birds that frequent Jarrow Slake. He is much devoted to antiquarian studies, and, some years ago, published a Memoir of Sir Walter Blackett, Bart, of Wallington, co. of Northumberland. % The royal assent was given on the 22d March, 1826, to an act for the making and maintaining of a turnpike road from the termination of the pavement near the south-west corner of the Market Place, in South Shields, along the road over Jarrow Slake in the township of Westoe, to White Mere Pool in the"], [193, "SOUTH SHIELDS. 59 Before closing the description of South Shields,* it may be proper to observe that the Lawe is Very justly a favourite promenade. Hutchinson says, \" The prospect from the church-yard south ward is worth the traveller's attention, where Jarrow and its ruined monastry, on a fine point of land, are particularly beautiful : but that from the ropery-walk excels every thing of the kind in the north of England. The river thronged with vessels, and animated with an incessant passage of small craft, is close on your left hand: The batteries and barracks on the northern shore dis play a striking military scene; whilst on the more distant ground, from the brow of lofty rocks, rise the venerable remains of Tynemouth priory. At the time we Saw this prospect, the cliffs were gilded with the evening sun ; the dashing billows which broke over the bar of the river drove their foam against the precipices, over which the solemn abbey, in the weeds of ruin, with distracted aspect sinking under the destroying hand of Time, completed such an assemblage of picturesque objects as seldom are found in a space so confined.\" Simonside. \u2014 This district, which is in the chapelry of South Shields, lies to the west of East Boldon Lane, and pays Easter-dues to the church of Jarrow. Above a century ago, it contained certain common fields, which were divided ; and part of Simonside, according to the division, lies in Harton, part in Westoe. There are also, in the same Simonside, three farms in the parish of Monk-Wearmouth, partly considered as belonging to Southwick, and partly to FulweU. This complex division is accounted for by a tradition, which is generally believed, that the village was entirely depopulated by the plague about two centuries ago, and that the nearest townships divided the deserted lands. Simonside, which seems to be included in Aldwin's donation to the cell of Jarrow, was anciently \u2022called South Preston, to distinguish it from that across the Tyne, but gradual!}' acquired the parish of Boldon ; and also a branch road to the town or vill of East Boldon, to lead from out of the said intended turnpike road at or near to Jarrow Slake, through the townships of Westoe, Harton, Whitburn, and East Boldon, along the present road leading from Jarrow Slake to East Boldon ; and also the extend ing of the said first-mentioned line of road, by making and maintaining a turnpike road from White Mere Pool aforesaid to the present turnpike road leading from the city of Durham to Tyne Bridge, and to join the last-mentioned turnpike road at or near to a certain lane or road called Vigo Lane in the parish of Chester-le-Street, which roads are called the \" Shields Turnpike Roads.\" * Amongst the charitable institutions, the Benevolent Society ought to be mentioned. This society is maintained by the Wesleyan Methodists. Its principles and objects are precisely the same as the Indigent Sick Society, already named ; and it is conducted in the most catholic manner, causing its sun to rise with out discrimination on the evil and on the good, and its rain to descend on the just and on the unjust. This society was established in 1806. Mr. John Hindmarsh bequeathed \u00a320, to be vested in the hands of the trustees of Chapter Row chapel, and the interest to be paid to the Benevolent Society. Mickleton's MSS. quoted by Surtees, contains an \" Account of public and private Armour belonging to Jarrow Parish with Sheeles, 8 Oct. 1619,\" by which it appears that the means of defence possessed by the inhabitants were not of a Very formidable description: \u2014 \"Common Armor,\" 4 corslets and 5 muskets. \"Private Armor,\" 2 corslets (1 defective), and 7 muskets, 2 of which were defective.

Sibil, co-heir of Hugh de Morwick, became the wife of Roger de Lumley, whose descendants held Preston and Symond set until the attainder of Ralph first Lord Lumley, when Preston and its appendages reverted to the church, and were almost immediately granted to Sir Ralph Bulmer. In 1522, Sir William Bulmer exchanged his lands in Monk- Wearmouth, Symonside, and Durham, for certain lands of the convent in Thorp, Hewles, Claxton, and Fishburne. At the dissolution, Simonside was. granted to the new cathedral. Simonside HaU, the residence and property of Henry Major, Esq. commands a fine view of Jar-. row Slake, the Tyne, and the adjacent country. Harton village stands near the sea-coast, about two miles south of the town of South Shields.. Its ancient name was Heortedun, which name, some imagine, refers to a connexion with Heorte nesse, as St. Hilda migrated from this district ; but Surtees, with great probability, supposes it means \" the hill of stags ;\" for the whole coast here, notwithstanding its present naked appearance,. was once a forest, indications of which still remain. Harton was included in Aldwin's donation to the reviving monastry of Jarrow, and is now held under the dean and chapter of Durham. The poor-rates in this township, in 1829, amounted to \u00a3135, 10s. It contains seven farms, two public houses, and a few genteel houses.* WHITBURN PARISH. This parish, which is about three miles square, is bounded on the north by Jarrow, on the west by Boldon, on the south by Monk- Wearmouth, and on the east by the sea. It is divided into two townships, \"Whitburn and Cleadon. They maintain their poor jointly, but repair their high ways separately, and each has a constable. The parish, in 1821, contained 150 houses and 856 inhabitants. The poor-rates, in 1829, amounted to \u00a3393, 13s., and the rental assessed to the county-rate that year was \u00a36309, 10s. Whitburn. \u2014 This small village, distant 3k miles north from Sunderland, is pleasantly situated on the southern acclivity of an eminence rising above 400 yards from a fine sandy bay, and com mands a cheerful prospect to the south, extending beyond Hartlepool to the hio-h cliffs on the Yorkshire coast. To the north of the village, the Lizard, a high, dry sheep-walk, \"commands a landscape not less varied than extensive : immediately to the south-east, Souter's Point, the most projecting point of land between the Wear and Tyne ; the grotesque rocks of Marsden ; and be yond a fine curve of the shore, and bold, jutting headland, crowned with the shattered monastry of Tynemouth ; and, further still, Hartley, and the semi-isles at the mouth of its rivulet.\" This village has a more sheltered and comfortable appearance than most places on the bare eastern coast. The dry limestone underneath the soil is peculiarly favourable to vegetation, and * The Editor returns thanks for the kind attentions of every gentleman applied to for assistance in draw ing up the account of South Shields, and acknowledges his peculiar obligations to Thomas Brown, Sen Esq. of Jarrow, and to Mr. C.

The gardens also produce very early and excellent vegetables.* Here are two day-schools and a ladies' boarding-school, six farmsteads, two corn-mills, three public houses, a small Methodist chapel, and several good houses, occupied by private families, or let to lodgers in the summer season. -f- A benefit society was established here in 1795, which is under the patronage and direction of the Rev. Thomas Baker, who acts as president of the club, which includes a numerous body of members. The rectory-house stands delightfully embosomed in a cluster of lofty sycamores. It is a handsome and convenient edifice, erected in 1816 from a plan furnished by the present incumbent, and executed by Mr. Stokoe, architect of Newcastle. The front is of freestone, and all the walls are stoothed, and contain a thorough ventilation. The church is an old Gothic structure, with a tower surmounted by a short spire. It was lately repaired and altered, and is now a neat and comfortable place of worship. The old raftered roof of the nave is covered by a modern ceiling, the dim mullioned windows are modernized under square labels, the floor raised with lime rubbish, and the church warmed by a stove. The whole is very handsomely pewed. The most singular monument in this church is mentioned by both Hutchinson and Surtees. Upon an altar tomb lies a recumbent effigy of a plump, stout, elderly gentleman, in the full, stiff' dress of 1689 ; a full periwig, neckcloth with square ends, coat with large buckramed skirts, wide sleeves, rolled breeches, and square laced shoes, with, huge bows of ribands ; the head rests on a pillow, and the right hand holds the book open at the text, \" I shall not lye here, but rise ;\" there is a skull between the feet. On the uprights of the tomb are represented, in bas-relief, the same figure kneeling, with a lady in a corresponding dress on each side of him ; on the east and west uprights, texts of scripture. A tablet, placed against the wall, informs us that this is \" The burial-place of Mr. Michael Mathew of Cleadon, and his wife, who had issue three sons and two daughters, of which only Hannah survives.\" In the chancel, on a flat slab, \" Johann.

The copyhold farm consists of a house and out-buildings, and nearly 42 acres of inclosed land, in the township of Stockton, and was let to John Grant, under an agreement for a lease for seven years from April, 1823, at the yearly rent of \u00a350, with an allowance of \u00a310 for lime and manure. A much higher rent was expected at the expiration of the lease. The trustees are also possessed of \u00a3280, 0s. 4d. stock, new four per cents, producing \u00a311, 4s. annually. This stock was purchased by the surplus of undisposed of income. The present income, arising from the sources above mentioned, now amount to \u00a361, 4s. per annum, ex- clusive of interest allowed by a banker in Stockton on the balances allowed to remain in his hands. The accounts are kept by Thomas Henry Faber, a solicitor at Stockton, who was appointed treasurer in 1826; and the trustees meet twice a year at Stockton, when the accounts are audited. The receipts are divided into eighteen parts, of which eight are carried to the account of the parish of Whitburn, and five to the account of each of the parishes of Washington and Woodhorn ; and the sums paid for any incidental ex- penses are divided, and charged to the account of each parish, in the same proportions. The sums now allowed with each apprentice are, in Whitburn \u00a38, and in each of the other parishes \u00a35. As none ofthe trustees reside near Whitburn, the rector and churchwardens recommend the children to be placed out apprentices from this parish. The parents or friends of each apprentice are paid \u00a34 for provid- ing him with cloathing; and the remaining \u00a34 is placed in the savings bank, in the name of the apprentice, until the term is expired. Sometimes girls placed out with milliners have received this benefit ; a practice condemned by the Commissioners for enquiring concerning Charities, as \" a fraud upon the charity.\" They also think that \" the trustees have been greatly deficient in their attention to the application of the charity,\" which they refer to the circumstance of their being \" for the most part resident at a considerable distance from either of the three parishes interested in the charity,\" and to their place of meeting being Stockton, where the attendance of either parents or children, to answer necessary enquiries, cannot be reasonably requested. Since June, 1821, there has been paid to the parish of Whitburn \u00a3152; and there was, in June, 1829, a balance due to the parish amounting to \u00a355, 8s. 7;_d- Since June, 1821, there has been paid to the parish of Washington \u00a3125 ; and there was, in June, 1829, a balance of \u00a39, 5s. 4d. due to this parish. Here the recommendations are signed by one of the trustees ; and the benefit is in some cases given to the master, and in others to the parents. But, what is most irre gular, the allowance has been paid to persons bound out many years before and after they had completed the term of their apprenticeship. * In January, 1760, Mrs. Mary Bainbridge died at Whitburn, aged 101. She was out on a visit the day before her death."], [198, "64 CHESTER WARD\u2014 E. D. Nothing has been paid to the parish of Woodhorn since December, 1826; and in June, 1829, the balance due thereto amounted to \u00a3111, 19s. 4id. The incumbent of this parish considered that as the trustees, in. 1826, \"required that after paying the expenses of the indenture, the remainder of the money should be paid as a premium to the master, the charity was no longer of any benefit to the children, as in this neigh bourhood tradesmen did not require any premium with an apprentice ;\" and he consequently declined inter fering in the charity. ' Whitburn and Cleadon, having been always members of the bishop's great manor of Chester-le- Street, few freehold estates of any consequence occur in either vill. About the reign of Queen Elizabeth, Leonard Pilkington, rector of Whitburn, collected together a considerable copyhold estate in Whitburn, in various parcels, which is now the property of Sir Hedworth Williamson. Whitburn Hall is an old spacious mansion-house, which fronts to the south, and adjoins the rectory grounds on the west. It has been the seat of the Williamsons since the desertion of Monk- Wearmouth, and part of it is said to have been built by the Pilkingtons before 1600. Bents is a small hamlet on the sea shore near to Whitburn, where the fishing-boats are moored, and where the bathing machines are stationed. It contains one farmhold, one public house, and a number of fishermen's cottages. There are usually ten fishing-boats, carrying three men each, employed here ; and the fish is generally sent to South Shields and Sunderland : but contracts are occasionally taken by the owners for supplying turbot for the London market. Whitburn West House is a large single tenement, with a handsome avenue of elms, about half way betwixt Whitburn and Cleadon. Cleadon, anciently Clivedon, is a scattered village, about a mile and a half west-north-west of Whitburn. It contains a small Methodist chapel, four farmholds, two public houses, and a ladies' boarding-school. The principal mansion and a small estate belong to Bryan Abbs, Esq. and which was purchased in 1813 for \u00a34350. About the middle of the last century, this was the seat and property of the ingenious Mr. Dagnia. The estate of the Chamber's family of Cleadon, after various transfers, was, in 1795, sold to Richard Pemberton of Barnes, Esq. for \u00a32450. Cleadon Tower stood at the east end of the old mansion, and commanded an extensive prospect. It is mentioned as early as 1587, and, as Surtees remarks, is rather a rare instance of a tower standing on a copyhold' estate ; but some think it was merely a fanciful building for pleasure, to enjoy the view. It was taken down above thirty-five years ago. In Boldon Book, the bishop's manor of Cleadon and Whitburn was occupied by twenty-eight villains, whose tenures, rents, and services are the same as those of Boldon. There were twelve cottagers, in tlie same servitude as those of Boldon. The Punder as he of Boldon. The two vills. pay xxs, cornage, and provide two milch cows. The demesne is on lease, with a stock of five draughts and a half, five harrows and a half, and pays, for interest of the two draughts and a half, twenty chalders of wheat, twenty of oats, and ten of barley ; and in money for the other three draughts, sixteen marks. In Hatfield's Survey, the rents and services were altered. William Swalwells pays for all the wastes, till a farmer be found, 26s. 8d. These wastes con sisted of considerable numbers of untenanted cottages and deserted plots of ground, abandoned from the distress of the times, and the devastating inroads of the Scots in the reign of Edward II. not yet effaced after the lapse of half a century. It was, perhaps, during this calamitous period,. that tlie name of the titular saint of the parish was forgotten and lost."], [199, "WHITBURN. 65 Biddick. \u2014 This estate lies north-west of Cleadon, adjoining Jarrow on the south, and is partly in this parish and partly in Boldon. The Wreken Dyke is supposed to pass close by the house of Biddick Barns. Marston Rock. \u2014 From the Lizard Point near Whitburn northward to Marston, the whole coast is wild, broken, and singularly picturesque. Immense insulated masses of freestone are thrown together in confusion, intersected by deep gullies, or scooped out into vast caverns.* The huge rock, called by way of eminence Marston Rock, now stands entirely detached from the coast by the violence of the sea, and at high-water is about ninety yards distant from the land ; though, within the memory of persons living, it could once be reached by a plank. A large aperture bas been formed in the body of this rock, through which boats frequently pass at convenient stages of the tide. Vast numbers of sea-fowl used to build their nests on its crest ; and, in order to facilitate the removal of the manure they left, a circular hole was made in the roof of an adjoining cavern, through which it was drawn in buckets to the summit of the cliffs. Adjacent to the shore near this rock is the Velvet Bed, a small island covered with smooth grass, and which is often the scene of festivity and amusement during the bathing season, wben Gipsy parties from Tynemouth and other neighbouring towns visit this spot. A cottage has just been erected on the beach, where visitors may be accommodated with refreshments; and steps have been cut in the rock, which render the ascent and descent safe and easy. Near this place is found what has been termed flexible limestone, which Dr. Thompson's- describes as consisting of flexible, thin lamin\u00e6, lying upon each other, but admitting of an easy separation. Though not elastic, when held bv the two extremities, the middle bends several inches. Mr. Surtees has seen this limestone exhibited in the pliant shape of a razor-strop. About a mile north of Souter Point, a fine spring of medicinal water issues from the rock ; but so far below the tide-mark as to be only accessible at the lowest spring-tides. The water has proved of considerable service in severe scorbutic complaints. Under the shelter of Souter Point is a place called Man Haven, above which is a crane hy * In October, 1829, the Prussian galliot Wilhelmina was wrecked on these rocks, and all the crew pe-. rished. Many people witnessed this distressing occurrence, but possessed no means of opening a communi- cation between the top of the cliff and the rocks or beach below. On May 7, 1830, the committee ofthe Port of Newcastle Association for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck assembled here, to witness a trial of the humane invention of Mr. John Motfit, of the customs, North Shields, to save the crews of ves- sels wrecked on such a coast. It consists of a double rope-ladder, connected by spring hooks and thimbles, kept steady by weights, and suspended by grapnels made fast in the ground. On this occasion, the ladder was tried over a cliff 70 feet in height, and totally inaccessible; and its suiliciency was proved by se\\'eral of the spectators descending and ascending, and being lowered down and hoisted up by it, as weU as the men appointed to try it. The calico jackets invented by Lieutenant Kennedy, R. N. were also tried, but, beiug badly manufactured, failed. Mr. Ralph Rewcastle, an ingenious millwright in Newcastle, has since con- structed a portable crane, by which persons may be lowered or hoisted from high cliffs with great facility. Mr. Davison has also invented a cliff-waggon, on which such a crane is securely fixed, and which may be rapidly conveyed to any part where wanted. A subscription is now being raised for procuring such a wan- gon to be stationed at Whitburn. There is a complete safety-coble at this place; but no funds are yet provided for its support. The above Mr. Rewcastle has a patent for ballasting ships with water, which he proposes to inclose in tight compartments in the lower part of the vessel, so as to be little liable to fluctuation, with pipes by which the water might either be pumped in, or allowed to run out. But the expense of the chambers, the multiplicity of bulk-heads, and the rise given by water ballast to the centre of gravity of the vessel are objections that have prevented the adoption of the plan. t Annals of Philosophy, vol. iv. p. 417- vol. i. \u2014 4.

This parish is bounded on the north and north-west by Jarrow, on the west and south-west by Washington, on the south and south-east by Monk-Wearmouth, and on the east by Whitburn. It includes two constableries: 1, West Boldon ; 2, East Boldon and Newton Garths. In 1821, it contained 145 houses and 733 inhabitants. The poor-rates, in 1829, amounted to _\u00a3>134, 10s. ; and, in the same year, the annual value of the lands and buildings assessed to the county-rate was <_?5031. The Manor. \u2014 The whole manor of Boldon, including both villages, has belonged from time immemorial to the see of Durham. The services of the manor, being the first that occur in the compilation, have given name to the Great Rental of Hugh Pudsey, or Boldon Bukje. The ser vices required on all the demesne lands and possessions of the bishopric, are made in the form and manner of Doomsday Book. This curious record is in a small folio, consisting of 24 pages wrote in a bad hand, and is kept in the office of the bishop's auditor in Durham. There is a neat trans cript of it in the Chapter Library at Durham, made by Dr. Hunter ; and another is preserved in the Bodleian Library at Oxford. The following was the state of Boldon at the period of this survey, or about 1180: \u2014 \" Twenty and two tenants in villenage, each of whom occupies two oxgangs containing together thirty acres, and pays 2s. rent, sixpence for scatpennies, half a chalder of oats, sixteen pence for averpenys, leads five woodlades, provides two hens and ten eggs, and performs three days works for the Lord in every week, excepting one week at Easter and at Pentecost, and thirteen days at Christmas. And in the course of this work (in operatione sue) each villain performs four portions of mowing in harvest, with all his family except the huswife ; mows three roods of averipe, and ploughs and harrows three roods of avereve ,- and for each caracute of land in their tenure, the tenants in villenage plough and harrow two acres, and then they have one corrody from the Lord, and are quit of all further work for that week ; but when they work at the great autumnal porca tion, they also receive a corrody. And in the course of their work, they harrow if need be, and make loads ; and during this latter service, they receive each a loaf of bread : they reap one day at Hocton (Houghton), and work till evening, and then they receive a corrody. At St. Cuthbert's fair, two villains build one booth ; and when they make withies and lead woodlades, they are quit of all other service. \"Twelve cottagers; each holds twelve acres, works two days in the week for the Lord the year round, except the holydays above named, and provide altogether twelve hens and sixty eggs. \" Robert holds two oxgangs containing thirty-six acres, and pays half a mark [this was proba bly an emancipated villain, who had commuted his services for a fixed monied payment]. The * It would be unjust to close this account of Whitburn without noticing the high esteem in which the Rev. Thomas Baker and Mrs. Baker are held by the parishioners, for the exercise of their truly Christian virtues-"], [201, "BOLDON. 67 Punder has twelve acres (attached to his office), and a thrave of corn from every cart or draught, and pays eighty hens and five hundred eggs. The mill pays five marks and a half rent. The whole tenantry in villenage are bound to construct, in the course of their work, if need be, a house forty foot long and fifteen wide; and when this service is ordered, fourpence averpenys is remitted to each tenant. The whole vill pays 17s. for cornage, and furnishes one milch cow. \" The demesne is on lease, with a stock of four draughts and four harrows, and pays for two of the draughts sixteen chalder of oats, and eight of barley, and for the other two draughts ten marks in money.\" This arrangement of the manor marks the extreme scarcity of specie, and proves that the nu merous wants and vast expenses of the lord's household were chiefly provided for and defrayed by the personal services and payments in kind of the tenants in villenage. But this species of payment became gradually commuted for a fixed money payment. In process of time, custom defined and restricted the demands of the lord, and the villa tenure slid into the certain and easy estate of tenant by copy of court roll ; whilst the demesne, leased more immediately under the lord, frequently became the origin of our modern leaseholds for lives or years. At the same time, the persons of villains by degrees became enfranchised, either by manumission or long asquies cence, so that when the tenure in villenage was virtually abolished (though copyholds were re served) by the statute of Charles II. , there was hardly a pure villain left in the nation.* Under Hatfield's Survey, the twenty-four tenants in villenage (of whom Thomas Wake only is named) owed exactly the same services as are enumerated under Boldon Buke : to which is added the carriage of a ton of wine, the accustomed works relative to the mill (not specified), and the transportation of goods belonging to the bishop or his seneschal ; but, instead of all these services, it should seem that each villain paid in money 14s. 2d., and for cornage altogether 17s. ; the milch cow, too, was commuted for 6s., and the punder had 8s. in lieu of his land and his thraves of corn ; the tenants also paid 26s. 5d. for maltpenys, and for Bathesilver at the festival of St. Cuthbert in September, 2s. 4d. For the water-mill and wind-mill, they paid \u00a3V] ; \u00a31, Ils. for a pasture called Esthopper lysour ; for 72 acres called the Shoefald, \u00a31, 5s. ; for the Crok Moor, 26 acres, 34s. 8d. ; for three tofts and 30 acres, 30s. ; for 60 acres at Copthorme, 20s. ; for 72 acres in the South more, 72s. ; and for every two oxgangs, the only service reserved in kind, two hens and ten eggs, in all 48 hens and twelve score eggs, at Christmas. Next are enumerated a long train of cottagers: the six first tenures average about 32 acres of old cottage land, that is, land anciently considered as attached to these cottages, with some ten or twelve acres of addition on the moor, under a new lease ; of these six also held each ten acres of the demesne ; the services of all (stated as before at two days works in every week) are all commuted for annual rents of 32s. each. Next follow the smaller cottagers, occupying various parcels from twelve to six acres, under rents from 10s. to 4d., each continuing to provide in kind a hen and five eggs; four ofthe cottagers, Elias Amfray, Thomas Diotson, John Couper, and Thomas Jonson, held a certain plot at the west end of the vill, formerly Robert Post's, and since Richard Robinson's, and pay 2s. 6d. * Surtees' Hist, and Antiq. of Durham, vol. ii. p. 58- \u2014 Under the Saxon government, there was a sort of people held in a state of absolute slavery, and belonged to the lords of the soil, like the rest of the cattle or stock upon it. They occupied at pleasure what was called Folk-land. On the arrival ofthe Normans, the tenants were raised a degree from the vilest slavery, and were called villains, either from the word vilis, or else, according to Sir Edward Coke, from d villa, because they lived in villages. These villains were either annexed to the manor or to the person of the lord. \u2014 Blackst. Comm. book ii."], [202, "68 CHESTER WARD\u2014 E. D. The whole amount of rent from 32 tenants of the demesne (viz. the villains and cottagers before named), for eleven score acres of the demesne, 22 messuages, and 44 oxgangs of bond land, with the mill, moor, and pasture, amounts to .\u00a344 per annum, and scatoats, eggs, and hens, in kind, the carriage of a ton of wine, the repairs of the mill, and carriage of the bishop and seneschal's goods. And the bond tenants, who hold nothing of the demesne, pay in all for two messuages and four oxgangs, with their proportion of the mill and pasture, 30s. each, and for lands on new leases granted by John Heron, seneschal, and others of the counsel of the late Bishop Thomas (Hatfield) deceased. Thomas de Refhop holds three acres once of William de Lomelev, 3s. 6d. rent ; John Robinson a toft and garden, formerly 5s. now onlv 4s. ; holds one plot formerly of John de Thorp, 16d. The headborough pays 22s. for the wastes. Besides these tenants under commutation rents, the Survey notices two free tenants: \"John de Hedv.orth holds a messuage and 36 acres, once of Richard de Hedworth ; serves on embassies, and brings up to Durham the rents of Werehall, col lected by Boldon Buke, and pavs at the four terms 6s. 8d. ; the same John holds a tenement and 80 acres on Boldon Moor called Scotshouse, and pays 40s. ; a plot of 40 acres called Gilbert leys, 26s. 8d. ; the lands sometime of Galfrid Scot, 3s. 4d. ; and a toft in Newton, once William Prest man's, 2s.\" Peter del Hay holds Faderlesfield, containing 46 acres, and pays 20s. Twenty-seven tenants hold 230 acres of the demesne, and pay for every ten acres 32s. 8d. W^est Boldon. \u2014 This is a dry and clean village, situated on a rocky eminence on tbe high road to Newcastle, about 4} miles north-west of Sunderland. It contains several good houses, some of which are partly occupied in the summer season by visitants from Newcastle and Sunderland, who come to enjoy the salubrious air of the neighbourhood. From a station a little above the village, there is a varied and extensive prospect, commanding a view of the whole valley northward, with Offerton, Biddick, Washington, Usworth, Jarrow, Shields, Tynemouth, and the rising grounds on the north shore of the Tyne, In this village, J. T. Wawn, Esq. Mrs. Pemberton, and Mr. J. R. Atkinson have commodious dwell ing houses. Here are a boys' boarding school conducted by Mr. Pybus, a boarding and day-school by Mr. Hutchinson, a tannery, two skinneries, three public houses, five farmsteads, and several cottages inhabited bv mechanics and labourers. The Black Horse Inn here has been kept by three successive John Merrimans for the last 134 years, and all of them were blacksmiths. Behind the house, a comfortable and spacious room, for public occasions, has recently been erected. The parish school will be noticed under the head Charities. Mr. John Walker, the present master, has been a contributor to the mathematical periodicals of the day. In 1830, a commo dious girls' day-school, attached to this, was erected by voluntary contributions, the deficiency being supplied by the rector. The school is well attended ; and the mistress's salary is paid partly by Miss Hollingsworth, and partly by the work of the scholars. The Church occupies a lofty scite upon the brow of the hill. It is a neat fabric, of ancient date and architecture, but almost entirely modernized. The nave is regular, having side aisles, formed by two octagonal pillars on each side, supporting pointed arches. The whole of tlie lights are modern ; and the old roof of the chancel is covered by a ceiling of stucco ; but, in the nave, the old, oak-ribbed roof is still displayed.

The Parsonage House of Boldon is a handsome and respectable building. The late rector built an additional wing behind the original mansion ; and the present incumbent has erected a beauti ful stone front, having two hexagonal projections, from a plan furnished by Mr. Dobson of New castle. He has also built new stables, coach-houses, and other out-offices, and much improved the garden and adjoining grounds, at an expense, it is said, of about =\u00a35000.* The glebe, in cluding the church-yard, contains about 147 acres. The rector is entitied to tithe throughout the parish, excepting a moiety of the Gilly tithes, which extend over 700 acres and two houses belonging to them in West Boldon, and a modus of 10s. in lieu of all tithe, and one shilling for Easter-dues paid to the rector by Harden farm. The Gilly tithes have successively belonged to the family of Monckton, Wycliffe, Martin, Blackett, and now to the Claytons of Newcastle. CHARITIES.\u2014 School.\u2014 The Rev. Henry Blackett, rector of Boldon, who died about the year 1808,. left \u00a3200, the interest to be applied for the education of eight poor children of the parish of Boldon. From this legacy \u00a320 was deducted for the duty, which was afterwards made up by the succeeding rector, and the amount laid out in the purchase of five per cent, stock. There is now \u00a3200 new four per cents., and the dividends are paid to the master of a school, built by subscription in 1810, who, on this account, instructs eight children nominated bv the rector. The remainder of his scholars pay. Harrison's Charity. \u2014 Ralph Harrison, by his will, bearing date 26th March, 1687, gave to the poor of the parish of Boldon \u00a3100, to be put out for their use bv the head men of the parish. He also left the like sums to the poor of the parishes of Whickham, Ryton, Gateshead, and Chester, and the chapelry of Tan field, and \u00a350 to the chapelry of Lamesley ; and he directed that no minister or preacher should have any hand in the ordering or distributing of the said monies, but only the head men in the several parishes and chapelries. The money was lent, in 1731, by the rector and overseers, as appointed by deed, to certain pro prietors of land and two mills in the parish, which deed was signed by the rector, overseers, and eleven proprietors ofthe said lands and mills. Out of the rents of two mills and about fifteen acres of land in the parish, which are collected for the use of certain copyholders by an officer called the Grieve, the sum of \u00a35, 17s- is paid yearly to the church wardens as the interest of \u00a3117- \u00a33 thereof is paid at Christmas, and \u00a32, 17s. at Easter; and the amount is distributed to the poor at those respective periods, in sums varying from Is- to 7s- Stephenson s Charily. \u2014 John Stephenson, by his will, bearing date 29th May, 1759, directed his executor, Matthew Stephenson, to make divers payments as therein mentioned, and also to distribute yearly, on the 25th December, to eight poor persons, having legal settlements in the parish of Boldon, 5s. a piece; and he expressed his desire that, to the end of all the charities thereinbefore mentioned might be continued for ever, the said Matthew Stephenson would charge a house in Westgate Street, in Newcastle, with the annual sum of \u00a310. By indenture, bearing date 18th July, 1761, and enrolled in the High Court of Chancery, between the said Matthew Stephenson of the one part, and Ogle Wallis and William Peters of the other part, reciting the will ofthe said John Stephenson, the said Matthew Stephenson granted to the said Ogle Wallis and William Peters, their heirs and assigns, a rent-charge of \u00a310, issuing out of a brick messuage, burgage, or tenement, in Westgate Street, Newcastle, in trust for the purposes mentioned in the said will. The yearly sum of \u00a32 is paid by Mr. Annandale, paper manufacturer, the owner of the house above mentioned ; and which is divided by the church-wardens, every Christmas, amongst eight poor persons, appointed by them with the approbation of the rector. East Boldon. \u2014 This village stands on the great road from Wearmouth to Gateshead, distant about half a mile from West Boldon. It consists chiefly of one long street, and contains several farmsteads and two public houses. There is a brick manufactory, belonging to Mr. Anderson. The chief portion of both vills is held by lease, or copy of court roll, under the see of Durham. * The Rev. N. J. Hollingsworth is not more distinguished by his able and acute polemical writings, than by his generous and charitable spirit, which renders him deservedly popular in his parish, and one of the brightest ornaments of his profession."], [207, "BOLDON. 73 Jasper Browell, Esq. has a pleasant residence and an estate at East Boldon. This township com prises property at the western extremity of the parish. Scots House is a good modern house, sheltered by a grove of trees, near the turnpike road, above one mile west of Boldon. In 1381, Rich aid Hedworth died seized of Scottes House on Boldon Moor, the messuage and tenure once of William son of Gilbert de Boldon (called, in the Survey, Gilbert Leeze), with other lands.* In 161 7, Scots House belonged to the Coles of Gates head, from whom it passed to the Milbankcs. It was next in possession of the Maddisons and Hudsons, and lastly of the Wades ; but was recently sold, by the neice of the late Robert Wade, to the present proprietor, Thomas Wilkinson, Esq. of Sunderland. Miss Wade, when a ward in Chancery, married Mr. Bazely, for which he was committed by Lord Chancellor Eldon, in De cember, 1815, to the Fleet Prison ; and Mrs. Bazely's property, averaging =C4000 per annum, was settled upon herself before the liberation of her husband. White Mere Pool, on the road side north of Scots House, is mentioned in records of the 13th century. Before draining and enclosure, the whole of the level country below Boldon, and ex tending to Cleadon, was covered with stagnant water, which was coloured white by the wash from the limestone hills adjoining. This explains the origin of the name, White Mere. One of the family of Maude was drowned in riding Boldon flats. Mount Pleasant, a farm near Boldon bridge, is the property of Nicholas Crofton, Esq. ; and Doivn Hill House is the property and residence of Mr. Wiljiam Crass. The farm called North Pastures belongs to Mrs. Pemberton, who now resides at Cheltenham. It was sold by Christopher Fawcett to Robert Pemberton in 1751. Hilton Grove stands near Hilton bridge, nearly at equal distances from Newcastle, Sunder land, and South Shields. The situation is sheltered, retired, and pleasant ; and the building is ornamented in a fanciful and picturesque style. The garden and pleasure-grounds, compris ing several acres, are tastefully laid out ; and the whole is pleasingly relieved by the Done, which runs for two miles through the estate. This compact estate consists of four farms in a ring fence, and is all in the occupation of the proprietor, Captain Dutton. In 1812, it was valued at \u00a3>17,000, but, in 1828, was purchased by the present owner for a much less sum. It is chiefly copyhold, with a part freehold and tithe-free. The West Pastures, at present held by Captain Dutton, belongs to the chapelries of Rock and Rennington, co. of Northumberland. The estate of Brockley Whins, in this parish, belongs to Nicholas Blenkinsop, of Simonside, Esq. ; the North Pastures, between Boldon and South Shields, to WUliam Hardy, Esq. Two farms are the property of William Peters, of Newcastle, Esq. Boldon Moor was divided into thirty-six shares. Half of these fell, chiefly by purchase, into the Wade family. Eighteen shares remain amongst different proprietors. Newton Garths, & freehold estate, was, by Boldon Book, a separate manor, and held by Jolm Pannetarius by xxs. rent. Twelve male-men hold twenty-four oxgangs of fifteen acres each, and pay for every two oxgangs 5s. rent, two hens, and twenty eggs ; and every male-man ploughs and * The Claxton family held lands in West Boldon, called Strothersfield, to about 1570. It appears that the coroner's fee or stipend arose by produce of lands assigned in ancient times ; for we find on the 13th of October, 2d King Edward VI., it was ordered and decreed bv Robert Hyndmer, chancellor of this county palatine, that the tenants and inhabitants of 'Whitburn, Cledon, Holdon, and Boldon, should yearly from thenceforth pay the coroner for the time being his corn in sheaf, as it had been accustomed in times past^ linless they could otherwise agree with the coroner. VOL, I, U"], [208, "74 CHESTER WARD.\u2014 E. D. harrows one acre of the lord's land at Boldon, and, for his two oxgangs, tills four portions of arable in autumn, with two men. The wife of Henry Montanis held forty acres for 40d. Newton, in Bishop Bury's time, gave a local name to a resident family ; and Rob. de Newton, in the fifth year of that prelate, died seized of considerable property there. It afterwards passed through the Nevils and Hiltons, the Mylots, Wycliffs, and Fenwicks. About 1711, Michael Fenwick alienated the estate to Henry Ellison, of Hebburn, Esq. ; and it is now the property of Cuthbert Ellison, Esq. On March 24, 1644, the Scots, whose head-quarters were at Sunderland, marched to Bol-Jlon Hills, where a very smart skirmish took place between them and the advanced portions of the army under the Marquis of Newcastle. The Scots were driven back with loss ; but, the next morning, they surprised and disordered the rear of the royal army, but were checked and repulsed by the promptitude and gallantry of Sir Charles Lucas. Cannon-balls are still occasionally found near the scene of this conflict. WASHINGTON PARISH. The parish of Washington is bounded by Jarrow on the north, by Monk- Wearmouth on the east, the Wear dividing it from Bishop- Wearmouth and Hough ton-le- Spring on the south-east and south, and by Chester-le-Street and the chapelry of Lamesley on the west. It includes three townships: 1. Washington; 2. Usworth; 3. Barmston. In 1821, it contained 532 houses and 2687 inhabitants. The poor-rates, in 1829, amounted to =\u00a3?645, 4s., and the annual value of pro perty assessed for the county rates to _P9H2, 9s. The poor-rates are more than quadrupled within the last 35 years. Washington is a small village, scattered on the broken, irregular skirts of the brook. It con tains three or four farmholds, two public houses, a paper manufactory, and a corn wind-mill. It stands about 6} miles south-south-east of Newcastle, and about the same distance west of Sunderland. The Parish Church, which is built on elevated ground, still retains some traces of high anti quity. It has two side aisles, each divided from the nave by three columns. Those of the north aisle are octagonal ; on the south, two are octagonal and the central pillar round : but they are all light and well proportioned, and support pointed arches. The aisles are thirteen paces wide. The chancel is divided' from the nave by a blunt-pointed arch, springing from corbells of human heads. The stalls and rails are removed ; and the whole of the old lights are replaced by uniform modern sashes, under pointed arches. A south porch, about twenty feet long and fifteen broad, opens into the nave under a pointed arch, and into the south aisle through the remains of a mul lioned window. It is the burial-place of the old lords of Washington; but the gaudy painted ceiling, sprinkled over with golden stars, mentioned by Hutchinson, has disappeared. The stone ribbed or groined roof of the vestry, or north porch, is now covered by a plain ceiling.

Charities. \u2014 The sum of \u00a3100, the origin of which is unknown, but which, by the Parliamentary Returns in 1786, appears to have comprised a legacy of \u00a35 left by Thomas Robinson in 1722, and the like sum by John Hopper in 1 732, was laid out in 1798 by William Peareth, in whose hands the money had been placed, in the purchase cf \u00a3210 three per cent, consols, in the names of John Fatherby, jun. (deceased), and George Usher, the then churchwardens. The amount of the dividends, \u00a36, 6s. per annum, is divided as follows : Township of Washington, \u00a32, 13s. ; ditto of Usworth and Biddick, \u00a32, 13s. ; ditto of Barmston, \u00a31. These sums are given to the overseers of each township, and by them distributed to the poor, chiefly to those not receiving parochial relief, in sums of Is. or 2s. each. Dr. Triplet's Charity. \u2014 The particulars of this charity will be found in the account of Whitburn. Great Usworth School. \u2014 By indenture bearing date 5th November, 1814, inrolled in tbe Court of Chan cery, Susan Peareth founded and endowed this school, and declared the bishop of Durham for the time being visitor of the school. The Manor. \u2014 Either William de Hertburn, who held the vill about 1180, or his immediate descendants, assumed the local name of Wessington (or Washington).* Under Bolden Buke, the vill was held by a free rent of four pounds, and by the service of attending the bishop's great hunt with two greyhounds. When a common aid was imposed, bis taxation was not to exceed one mark. In 1350, William de Wissington, Chevalier, had licence to settle the manor of him self, his wife Katherine, and his own right heirs. The direct male line expired before 1400. Dionisia, tlie only surviving daughter of the last William, married Sir William Tempest, of Stud ley, Knight. Dionisia, the elder daughter and co-heir of Sir William Tempest, intermarried with Sir James Mallory, in her right of Studley ; and Elizabeth, the younger, became the wife of Sir Richard Norton, of Norton Conyers. The Mallorys afterwards acquired the whole manor. In 1613, it was sold for _f?4000 to William James, bishop of Durham, who settled the estate on his youngest child, Francis Jaines, the issue of his third marriage, by Isabel, widow of Robert Atkin son, alderman of Newcastle, because the estate was purchased by her fortune. William James, Esq. son of Francis, died in 1662; and the estate descended to his four daughters, co-heiresses: 1. Sarah, wife to Wilfrid Lawson, Esq.; 2. Dorothy, to Sir Richard Musgrave, Baronet; 3. Eli zabeth, who married Sir Robert Millot, of Whitehill, Esq. ; and, 4. Anne, wife to John Hed worth, of Harraton, Esq. In 1704, Sir Richard Musgrave and Dorothy his wife (then entitled to two-fourths of the manor), AVilfrid Lawson and Sarah his wife (entitled to one-fourth), and John Spearman (entitled to the remaining fourth), made a division of the estate by lot. The north quarter was drawn by Sir R. Musgrave ; the south quarter by Sarah Lawson ; the west quarter by John Spearman ; the east quarter by Dame Dorothy Musgrave. The moors and mines were not divided ; but, in 1763, a further division of Washington Moor took place. Sir Wilfrid Lawson is proprietor of the south quarter ; R. E. Duncomb Shafto, Esq. of the west quarter. The other moiety belongs to Sir James Musgrave, Bart, of Barnsley Park, Gloucestershire ; except the third of a fourth, which was pur chased in 1823 by John Spearman, Esq. New Washington is a hamlet inhabited by persons employed in the adjoining coal-works. Washington Wood Staith lies on the river Wear, and contains two public houses, with cottages for workmen. \u2022 It is probable that from cadets of this ancient house descended the Washingtons of Yorkshire, and aha those of Leicestershire, ancestors ofthe American patriot, George Washington."], [211, "WASHINGTON. 77 Great Usworth is a straggling village on the declivity of a rocky hill, about two miles north of Washington, and contains two farmholds, two public houses, several mechanics and shopkeepers, and a meeting-house belonging to the Wesleyan Methodists, capable of seating 500 persons. The school, endowed by the late Mrs. Peareth, was built in 1814, and is very commodious. It is well attended by the children of the township. Usivorth House is an elegant stone building, of regular architecture, on an eminence command ing an extensive and interesting view of Biddick, Lambton Castle, Hilton Castle, Sunderland, Wearmouth, and the sea. It is sheltered by a fine grove on the north and west ; and the grounds are scattered over with lofty, flourishing evergreens. This mansion is now the seat of the Misses Ann, Mary, and Henrietta Peareth. William Peareth, who died in 1775, was nearly 50 years clerk of the chamber, and alderman of Newcastle. His son Wilbam, who died August 11, 1810, aged 76, had a son, William Jennens Peareth, died 1804, at the early age of 20 years, and who displayed all the promise of an accomplished scholar and gentleman. During the late war, the Usworth Volunteer Cavalry, raised by Mr. Peareth, were amongst the first embodied in the north. They afterwards merged into the Tyne Legion, and next into the Tvne Hussars. This manor performed heavy services, according to Boldon Book. Great Usworth pays 30s. for cornage, provides one milch cow, and one man for castle- ward, eight chalders of malt, as many of meal, and as many of oats ; each caracute (the demesne excepted) ploughs and harrows two acres. The villains were to prepare in tillage for seed four portions of land, with twenty-six men to each portion ; and the services they used to perform at Washington, they now render at Gates head : further, they carry annually one pipe of wine and one millstone to Durham. The Drenge feeds a horse a day, bears his part in the great hunt with two greyhounds and five cords of provi sions, follows the Court of Pleas, and serves on messages. The mill pays ten shillings rent. In Hatfield's time, the whole of the services had been commuted into money payments. Sir William Hilton held two parts of the vill, and Alice de Moderby a third; and these tenants paid jointly for serving on embassies 10s., for castle-ward 20s., for labour at St. Martin's 10s., for cornage 30s., for a milch cow 6s. ; only they still rendered in kind six quarters and two bushels of malt, five quarters and two bushels of oatmeal, and ten quarters and a half of oats, and they car ried one pipe of wine. The family of Hilton retained the manor till the general dispersion of the property in 1750, when the estate was sold in eight lots or farms. Of these two were bought by William Peareth, of Newcastle, Esq. ; one by William Scott, of Newcastle, and is now the property of his eldest son, Lord Stowell; one was sold to Lord Ravensworth and his partners (the Grand Allies); one to Mr. Bowlby, of North Shields, now the property of Matthew Russell, Esq. ; and two farma were sold to Samuel Shields, Esq. who left tbe Usworth property between two daughters : Bar bara, married to Bernard Shaw, Esq. ; and Sarah, to Lieutenant-colonel Blakeney, whose share is also now the property of Matthew Russell, Esq. Little Usworth. \u2014 By Boldon Book, William holds this manor, pays 10s., carries wine with a draught of eight oxen, and attends the great chase with two greyhounds. In Hatfield's Survey, it appears in the possession of Alicia Moderby, who held the manor by foreign service and 10s. rent. Alicia afterwards married Richard Stanhop, burgess of Newcastle upon Tyne, and the manor was settled on their issue. Some confusion and obscurity follow ; but the manor was held by three successive Swymiows of Scremerston, after which the estate of Usworth became vested in, vol. i.

In 1632, Wilfrid Lawson, Knight, died seized of the manor of Little Usworth, of lands called Over Shelemore and Nether Shelemore, and of other lands near Usworth, called Strother House or Strother Medows.* Usworth Place is a handsome modern mansion, built by Captain Bernard Shaw of the 2d Foot, a younger son of a respectable Irish family, and author of \" A Plan of the Bay, Rock, and Town of Gibraltar,\" published in 1781. He acquired this estate by marriage with Barbara, daughter and co-heir of Samuel Shield, Esq. who had purchased it on the sale of the Hilton estates. Us worth Place is now the seat of his son, Robert Shaw, Esq. . North Biddick lies in a low situation, close on the Wear, a mile to the south of Washington. By Boldon Book, it was held by Ulkill by the sixth part of a knight's fee. Before Hatfield's Survey, it gave local name to a family, who, about the time of Edward III., exchanged the sur name for the patronymic Sanderson, from which the Sandersons of Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, and Lincolnshire, the ancestors of the Earls of Castleton and Scarborough, and of the learned Bishop Sanderson of Lincoln, deduce their origin.f At the time of Hatfield's Survey, Biddick was held by Sir William Hilton, and continued to be the property and occasional residence of that family during many generations, but was alienated on the first dispersion of the Hilton pro perty, and passed to the Carrs of Cocken, from whom it passed by marriage to the Davisons and Erringtons. Biddick Hall is at present the residence of Nicholas Crofton, Esq. On this estate stands the famous Worm Hill, round which the fabulous dragon lapped itself nine times, \" leaving vermicular traces, of which grave living witnesses depose that they have seen the vestiges.\" It is a small artificial cone, formed of common earth and river-gravel. The Worm Well lies betwixt the Hill and the Wear. It was long in repute as a Wishing-well, and had for merly a cover and an iron dish or ladle. Barmston is a small township upon the Wear, nearly opposite to Offerton. It contains three farmholds, a few scattered cottages, and an iron forge. It is an ancient manor of the Hiltons. In 1669, it was sold by John Hilton, for _P2750, to George Lilburn, of Sunderland, Esq. in whose family it rested till after 1700, when it passed by marriage into the Tempest family. * In Thoresby 's Leeds, the pedigree of John Lawson, Lord of Fawkesgrove, co. of York, temp. Henry III. is deduced through eight descents to Thomas of Usworth. The following are extracts from the will of George Lawson, Esq. of Little Usworth, dated 29th December, 1587: \u2014 Desires burial \" in the Quier 0f AVashington, over against my grandfather's tombe, where I will that my sonne Thomas Lawson shall cause a window and tombe to be built, and he to bestow yc some of xxi. or xl/. at his discretion\" \" Item, I give to ye maintenance of a gram'er schole in Hexam xxi. in money.\" \" If Mr. Robert Claxton, of whom I purchased the lordship of Burnehall, do paie unto my sonne Thomas \u00a32000 within ye next yeare, he shall have the lordship againe ; and I will yat my sonne give him \u00a330 back.\" \" Item, I give unto two of the poorest scollers in Houghton scole, so long as the said scole is maynteyned, xl.f. per ann. out of my lands in that parish, at the discretion of the Scole-master and Church- Wardens, to by the said scollers bokes and apperill.

GATESHEAD PARISH. The parish of Gateshead is bounded by the Tyne on the north, by the parish of Jarrow on the east, by Washington on the south-east, by the chapelry of Lamesley on the south and south-west, and by the parish of Whickham on the west. By an act passed in 1809, the Fell was constituted a separate rectory; but the whole original parish continues to form but one constablery as to the joint maintenance of the poor.* The Borough <>f Gateshead was probably co-existent with Newcastle ; and there is no doubt that Dr. Stukely is correct in supposing that it was a fortified place of the Romans ; for, as they erected a bridge here, it is probable they had a tower and Gate for its defence. This opinion is strengthened by some Roman remains having been found here. When the Saxons were possessors of this important pass, it would be equally necessary to have it strongly fortified. Camden, Gale, and other antiquaries, supposed that Gateshead was the Gabrocentum of the Notitia, an opinion sufficiently exploded by Horsley ; though Dr. Stukely, after finding the place called Ad Caprce Caput by Bede, and seeing a goat's head used at it as a sign, found that Gabrocentum, in British, signified goofs head, and therefore continued in Camden's opinion. But it is doubtful where Ad Capr\u0153 Caput was situated. Simon of Durham says that Bishop Walcher was murdered at Ad Caput Capr\u0153, which, in another place, he calls Gotesheved. In Brompton it is Cattesse hevede. * The boundary of Gateshead (separating it from Gateshead Fell) Commences at the river Tyne, at the north-east corner of a parcel of ground called \" The Friar's Goose,\" and, following the little burn dividing this property from Felling estate, passes on the east side of Kirton's gate, where it crosses the Sunderland turnpike; and continuing by the fence which divides Gateshead Park from Felling estate, crosses the Sun- derland old road; and taking the east and south fences of Mitford's Fields (now part of Deckham Hall estate), runs westwards and north-westwards, passing through Deckham Hall and Miller's Cottage (which are both partly in Heworth and partly in Gateshead parishes), again crosses the Sunderland old road, and takes the western fence of \"the Tenement Closes\" to \"the Tenement Houses,\" where it takes the western boundary of the Claxtons' estate ; and passing over the north-east corner of St. Edmund's burial-ground and the south-west corner of the chapel (which is partly in Gateshead and partly in Gateshead Fell parishes), continues along the western boundary of Claxton's estate, and the ancient boundary of Peareth's Closes, to the east end of Sunderland turnpike, where it crosses the Durham turnpike road ; and taking the eastern boundary of Sorsbie's, Charleton's. and Barras' ancient properties, crosses Potticar Lane (now the Durham branch road), and takes the eastern boundary of Shipcote and Cramer Dykes ancient inclosures to Whitefield House, where it crosses KelPs Lane; and taking the eastern, southern, and western boundaries of Kell's Field, otherwise Beacon House estate, again crosses Kell's Lane, and takes the southern boundary of Whin- ney House ancient inclosures ; and running westwards by the little burn dividing these inclosures from Gateshead Fell, crosses Saltwell Lane ; and taking the eastern boundary of Darwent Crook ancient inclo- sures, runs southward to Chow Dean, whence, proceeding by the southern boundary of Darwent Crook estate, it falls into the Team, and continues northwards along this rivulet until it falls into the river Tyne, at the north-west corner of the parcel of ground called St. Omer's (belonging to St. Mary's Hospital, New castle) ; and from thence continuing by the river Tyne to the point from whence we set out. The bounda ries of Gateshead parish were perambulated May 27, 1824, on which occasion a number of medals were distributed."], [214, "80 CHESTER WARD.\u2014 E. D. As gate signifies a street in ancient and tlie present vulgar language, Brand, with great probability, thinks that Gateshead means the head or end of the road, because a branch of Watling Street ended here. The first certain notice of Gateshead, which proves tbat the place had a church, and was in all probability even then an ancient and considerable vill, is the outrageous murder of Bishop Wal cher in the year 1080. In 1164, Bishop Hugh Pudsey granted a charter to the burgesses of Gateshead, of which the chief privileges were, liberty of forest, freedom from toll within the pala tine, and in general wards all such advantages as were enjoyed by the burgesses of Newcastle. This charter presupposes the existence of the borough, the original foundation of which is totally unknown. The survey of Boldon Book, under the same prelate, states, that Gateshead, with the profits of the borough, the mills, fisheries, and bake-houses, with three parts of the arable land* were farmed under 60 marks rent. The remaining parts were in the hands of the bishop. The most important portion of the history of this borough, is that of the perpetual disputes betwixt the see of Durham and the powerful and wealthy corporation of Newcastle, for the free navigation of the river Tyne, and the right of building quays and ballast-shores on its banks. But notwithstanding successive royal confirmations to the see of Durham, of the right of mooring and unlading ships on the south of Tyne, and the free navigation of the river by the mid-stream, yet, says Surtees, \" it may be doubted how far the active and wealthy corporation of Newcastle ever totally removed the hook from the nostrils of the river dragon ; for, in 1414, the recovery of a third of Tyne Bridge, and of the tower of offence which the adversary had erected on it, seems to have been matter of no moderate triumph to Cardinal Langley, one of the wisest and most powerful prelates who ever filled the palatine throne, and who took possession of the disputed bub. wark on the 3d of August, 1414, with all his chivalry.\" The confirmation of the right of the mayor and burgesses of Newcastle to hold the conservatorship of the Tyne, ended all disputes relative to the river in favour of Newcastle. In 1552, during the temporary dissolution of the see of Durham, an act was obtained, which severed Gateshead from the bishopric, and annexed it to Newcastle; but one of the first acts of Queen Mary's reign was the restoration of the borough of Gateshead to its pristine state,* Yet * In the preamble to the act which severed Gateshead from the county palatine of Dnrham, it is set forth that \"on the South syde of the said ryver of Tyne, doo inhabyte and'bene from tyme to tyme a greate numbre of carpenters, collyers, fishers, maryners, and other liandyeraftes menne, which by their handy workes gayne and have their cheif and in manner hole lyving in the said towne of Newcastle, where they daly comit manyfolde enormityes and disorders which escape unponished, to a very evil example in the hin derance of justice, by reasone that soche offenders, by repairing untto the saide towne of Gatesyde, beino* withowte the jurisdicon of the said haven towne of Newcastle, fynde evasone and meanes to escape the con* dign correcon and punishment of their sayde mysbehavors ; as also that for no smal nombre of the inhabitants of Gatesyde, withoute any respect to the conservacon of the havon of the saide porte towne of Newcastle being the chief maintenance and upholde of the same, do cast into the saide havon rubishe, wth all the re' fuse of their building, besydes the other clensing of their howses and streetes, without any correccon or pu\" mshment extended unto them for the same, by reasone that the saide towne of Gatesyde is parcel of the saide Counte Palentyn of Duresme, and withoute the libertyes of the saide havon towne as is aforesaide \u25a0 without remedye wherof the saide havon shulde perish, and therby the towne sholde be in great ieoperdve ot ruynge and decaye.\" r * The community of Gateshead answered by setting forth, that \"the Towne of Gateshed is ruled bv the iJayhft and Burgesses, and hath good and holsome constitucons and ordinances within themselves, and is as welgovned for justice as they are in Newcastell, punishing all offenders wh cast rubbishe and clensinsre ot their howses into the river of Tyne, and therefore the suggestion wh they alleage in the statute of uniting\u00a9"], [215, "GATESHEAD. 81 Bishop Tunstall, probably as a peace-offering to the grasping corporation of Newcastle, granted to the mayor and burgesses a lease of tbe Salt Meadows, for 450 years, under \u00a32, 4s. rent ; and of the borough tolls, during the same period, under \u00a34t, 6s. rent. In 1578, Bishop Barnes granted a lease of the manors of Gateshead and Whickham to Queen Elizabeth, for 79 years ; but, in 1582, a new lease was granted, for 99 years, including all the pits, mines, wastes, and royalties, under \u00a3\\VJ, 15s. 8d. reserved rent. Next year, the queen consigned this lease to the corporation of Newcastle; and, after many changes, it expired in 1682. In 1716, Bishop Crewe demised the manor of Gateshead, for 21 years, to William Coatsworth, Esq. (excepting the third part of Tyne Bridge, and the advowson of the two rectories), under the yearly rent of =\u00a3235, Ils. 4d. Tbe lease has since been renewed to the Coatsworths, and is now vested in their descendant, Cuthbert Ellison, Esq. The origin of the freehold property vested in the burgesses of Gateshead cannot be traced to its original source. In 1551, the burgesses were in possession of Wynde Mylne Hill, Langflatt, and Stoneflatt. In 1563, they litigated their common right in Redheugh and Herelaw with the W'hites of Redheugh. A decree, 30 Elizabeth, recognizes the usage of pasturing the town fields. In 1607, cows were stinted in these pastures, at fourteen-pence a head. In 1814, an act was obtained for enclosing the borough lands, or town fields, consisting of the Windmill Hills, Bensham, the High and Low Swards, Threstley Close, the Low Flatt, Middle Flatt, and Bull Close. These lands, amounting to 158 acres, 1 rood, were divided according to the proportions of borough-tenure and common right. They are now well fenced and highly improved. A certain part, called the Windmill Hills, containing by estimation ten acres or thereabouts, was reserved, with the erections thereupon. This portion, with buildings on Stoney Flats, Bensham, &c. including way-leaves and overleadings on the Fell, constitute the present borough- property of Gateshead, and, by the accounts dated May, 1830, produced the annual rent of =P574, 3s. The rent, after paying neces, sary expenses, is divided every half-year amongst the borough-holders and freemen. About 135 burgage or ancient tenements in Gateshead confer the right of borough-holders (and are hence called borough-holds) upon the proprietors ; but as several of them are possessed of more than one borough-right, the number of persons having an interest in this property does not much exceed 100. The borough-holders and freemen have built two houses on the Windmill Hills. By a resolution passed at the half-yearly meeting of the borough-holders in November, 1830, it was agreed to sell or divide the borough-property, if it can be legally effected ; and a committee was appointed to investigate the matter. The Fell* (a name derived from the Danes), formerly \" a wide, spongy, dark moor,\" was bounded on the east by the Roman Causeway, on the south by AVrecken Dyke, 011 the west by the townes is manifestly untrew, as it is evidently knowen for that the South sid of the river, wh is towards Gateshead, is deep and more cleane than that sid towards Newe Castell. \u2014 And yf it should be united in Newcastell, and we are not wth in the County of Durham, it would be replenyshed w'h evell disposed per sons and theues, because it is wth out their walls, as is the North pte of Newcastell ; whereas nowe in Gates hed their are a great nomber of substancal honest men faithful and trewe subjects, ns did appere in the late rebellyon, some merchaunts, some drapers, and other honest artificers, whom the towne of Newcastell doth envie because they dwell so me unto them.\" * William the Conqueror gained a decisive victory over the army of Edjar Etheling, Malcolm king of Scotland, and certain Danish pirates, on Gateshead Fell, in 1008, and after that recovered Newcastle, and laid it in ashes. About the year 1273, it was customary for the kin- of Scotland, the archbishop of York, VOJ., I. A"], [216, "CHESTER WARD.^E. D. 82 Eigliton, Chow-dene, and Darwin Crooke, and on the north by Saltwellside, Whinney House, and Beacon House grounds. By a survey taken in 1647, it contained 1300 acres ; but about 1703, Sir Henry Liddell claimed a considerable part of it, which was settled in 1715, in a cause between him and the bishop of Durham ; and as the borough-holders did not object to the decision, Sir Henry proceeded to inclose the part he had claimed. The bishop of Durham, as lord of the manor, is seized of the soil and royalties ;* and the borough-holders and freemen of the borough not only claimed right of common, but also the privilege of letting stints, and allowing cottages to be built and inclosures to be made upon the Fell. In 1734, Mr. Ellison and Mr. Carr, the bishop's lessees, were permitted to enjoy a moiety of the small annual rents received for the cottages. The borough-holders of Gateshead long neglected the herbage of the Fell ; but, in 1809, an act was obtained for dividing it. The commissioners were empowered to set out such parts as they pleased for roads, drains, quarries, watering places, &c. and one acre as a church-yard : of the residue, one-sixteenth part was appropriated to the bishop of Durham as lord of the manor, and another sixteenth part to the borough-holders and freemen of Gateshead, in compensation for their exclusive right of letting stints : the rest of the Fell (except a part for making two waggon-ways) was divided amongst persons having right of common. The whole Fell contained 631 acres, 0 roods, 21 poles, exclusive of roads, quarries, wells, &c. The allotments contained 595 acres, 1 rood, 19 poles ; and the cottages and garths sold by the commissioners, 35 acres, 3 roods, 2 poles.-f The claims of 17 freemen, 129 owners of ancient burgages, and 9 owners of various freehold estates, were allowed ; and 45 claims were withdrawn or awarded against. At the time of the division, there were 430 cottages upon the Fell ; 90 of which were pulled down as prejudicial to the division, and 340 were enfranchised, amongst which were 8 public houses. From the earliest period on record, this town was governed by a Bailiff, appointed by the bishops of Durham. The names of several persons who filled this office occur as witnesses to ehar- the prior of Tynemouth, the bishop of Durham, and Gilbert de Umfranville, by their bailiffs, to meet the justices coming to Newcastle to hold pleas, and to ask their liberties of them, at the head of Gateshead, at a certain well there, called the Chille-well. The sheriff of Northumberland still goes in procession to the New Cannon, on the Low Fell, to receive the judges of assize on their northern circuit. Formerly, the procession halted at Sheriff Hill, or the sign of the Cannon, on the old road. In 1770, Robert Hazlett was hanged, and afterwards hung in chains by the edge of a pond on the Fell, from thence called Hazlett's Pond, for rob bing a Miss Benson and the Durham postman. The pond is now drained and enclosed. In the years 1781 and 1782, military encampments were formed on this Fell; and, during the late war, a beacon was erected, on a place since called Beacon Hill. A quantity of very ancient gold, -silver, and copper coins, were found on February 10, 1809, by some workmen who were forming a waggon-way on the Fell. * Roger de Fnlthorpe and others, in 1368, worked the coal-mines in \" Gateside Moore.\" At one time, there were \" eight pittes on Gateside Low Fell,\" which accounts for the immense extent of pit-waste on this part of the Fell previous to the division. The Low Fell was once separated from the High Fell by an earthen mound or fence, which was observable in 17*47- t Including roads, &c. the whole would not contain much more than half of the quantity stated as its area in 1647- The first allotment sold fetched \u00a320, and the highest \u00a360; but \u00a340 was thought a good price for a borough claim. The allotments set out being equal to 222| borough claims, the whole would be worth, at that time and price, \u00a38900, but is now estimated as worth \u00a346,725. Thirty years ago, the Fell was studded with miserable mud cottages, inhabited by tinkers, doggers, travelling potters, besom-makers, egglers, and others of that worthy race called Faws. A sod cottage is now a rarity even on Gateshead Fell ; and, in 1827, the gentry of the place had a concert of vocal and instrumental music, for the benefit of Mr. G. Bagnall, organist of St. John's on the Fell, which was fashionably attended, and which amusement has since been annually repeated."], [217, "GATESHEAD. 83 ters ist the vestry, from 1316 to 1620, when it was held by Sir Thomas Riddell, Knight. The borough petitioned the bishop to appoint them a new one in 177-2-> setting forth that since the death of Robert Delaval, whose patent was dated in 1681, that officer had been discontinued, and that they had still in their possession a seal, inscribed, \" Sigillvji Bvrgi de Gateshead.\" At present, the Stewards of the borough are the substitutes of this ancient officer. They are annually elected by the borough-holders and freemen. Stewards, assisted by four grassmen, were first appointed in 1695 ; but the appointing of grassmen was discontinued on the division of the town fields in 1815.

The rector, and four and twenty of the parish of Gateshead, elected the stewards of the borough, until about thirteen years ago, when, in consequence of several of the four and twenty being nei ther borough-holders nor freemen, it was deemed inexpedient for them to take any part in the election ; and they are now elected by those only who are interested in the affairs of the borough.* The bailiff of Gateshead occurs as holding a court in this town in 1415; and, in 1614, a head court of the corporation of Newcastle was held here, before Thomas Riddell, Esq. bailiff, and George Nicholson, steward. Lord Crewe's lease to Mr. Coatsworth comprises the right of holding a Halmote-court, &c. in the manor of Gateshead, which of late years has been annually kept, by direction of Cuthbert Ellison, Esq. the lord of the manor, under the presidency of his steward, Nathaniel Clayton, Esq. The neighbouring magistrates also hold a petty sessions every Saturday, in their room, in the Goat Inn. Bishop Tunstall, in 1557, incorporated the barkers and tanners of Gateshead ; and in 1594, Bishop Toby Matthew, by charter, confirmed the dyers, fullers, black smiths, locksmiths, cutlers, joiners, and carpenters ; and the cordwainers in 1602. In 1661, Bishop Cosin incorporated in one company, at their own request, the drapers, tailors, mercers, hardware- * Wainmen. \u2014 Four wainmen were annually appointed in the borough of Gateshead, from the commencement of the oldest parish-book in 1626 to 1740. Their duty was to collect a toll of six-pence for every loaded wain, and three-pence for every loaded cart, from all inhabitants that were neither freemen nor borough men ; and the like sums from all other persons passing through the said borough. All borough-men and freemen, exercising any trade in the borough, where they made use of wains or carts, paid the same tolls, except they were loaded with goods for their own particular use, and not exposed to sale. This toll, which never seems to have produced much above \u00a34 per annum, was frequently resisted and finally abandoned."], [218, "CHESTER WARD.\u2014 E.

Several of these com panies are extinct. In 1726, the churchwardens of Gateshead granted a lease of 21 years, of a house on the west side of the church-yard, as a meeting-house for the companies of dyers, fullers, blacksmiths, locksmiths, cutlers, joiners, and carpenters. In 1814, nine fullers and dyers claimed on borouo-h-lands. The names of seven freemen are annexed to the list of borough-holders pub lished in 1831. Foresters appear to have been appointed by the bishop in regular succession. Roger de Tick hill, who held that office in 1343, had an allowance of three-halfpence a day ; and the same wages were continued from that time to 1438, when the \" Park-keeper\" had a halfpenny a day added to his salary for the \"custody of the tower\" of Gateshead, with other profits, and a robe, or 8s. in lieu of it, every Christmas-day.

The origin of the present edifice is uncertain. It is mentioned in 1291 as being at that time worth -C13, 6s. 8d. a year. Hodgson says, \" The shape and hewing of its stones prove that it has been built out ofthe ruins of some Roman edifice.\" The aisles are formed by light octagonal pillars, supporting on each side five arches. The transept opens into the aisles under similar arches. The body of the church is old; but the tower or steeple, and a portion of the west end of the nave, were rebuilt in 1740,-f- when a new west door was opened : the old entrance is by the south porch. The chancel opens into the nave, under a wide pointed arch. There were formerly three recesses in the wall within the altar-rails, for officiating ministers ; but when the chancel was repaired by Dr. Prosser, the recesses were removed. The windows are modern and uniform. The soutb transept has an elegant window of stained glass, presented to the parish, in 1819, by Mr. Joseph Price, glass manufacturer. It represents the Annunciation of the Virgin, and the arms of the borough, the goat's head, with a crest, taken from an old chair in the vestry. In other compart ments are twelve coats of arms of eminent families connected with the parish. The church is re- * The following letter, preserved in Gateshead vestry, shews that the men of this borough were not purer than the burgesses of other places : \u2014 \" Sir, after my humble service, I am sory I did not waite of you acording to your letter.

The font is a large bason of black marble. Six bells were purchased by contribution in 1730. The corporation of Newcastle, the Trinity House, and the Ellison family, were principal benefactors. In Bourne's time, there were eight bells. The whole were new hung in 1773- The four spires were taken down in 1764, and the roof altered. The parishioners, on January 16, 1820, agreed to purchase a new organ by sub scription. Tbe present one was built by Messrs. Wood, Small, and Co. of Edinburgh, and cost 500 guineas. It is an excellent instrument ; and its powers were beautifully unfolded by Mr. Ingham, the organist, at the first Sacred Oratorio held in this church by the Amateur Choral Society on October 31, 1827-* In the vestry there is a remarkable old chair, with a goat's head carved upon it in the field erazed, and the crest a goat's head. The initials L. A. J. W. P. B. P. I, are supposed to be those of the then church-wardens.-f- In consequence of the want of a waiting-room for the poor during * There were four Chantries in this church. Several deeds remain in the vestry, which mention the chantry of St. Mary in the north porch of the church. By one of these it appears that this institution existed some years before the foundation charter was granted in 1330, by Alan, son of Roger Prestre. and \"Allan, called Prestre of Gateshead ;\" for one of these Alan Prestres was chaplain and guardian of its altar in 1323, and in 1311 he is called \" Alaunus dictus Prestre capellanus de Gatesheued.\" The commu nity of Gateshead were patrons. At the suppression, it was worth 75s. 4d. a year. \" The chauntrie of the Trinilie in Gatished was founded by one Alone Prestore by reporte, but no dede of foundacion is shewed \u2014 yerelie value \u00a34, 4s. 2d.\" By a deed in the vestry, dated in 1330, Alan Prestre, \" capellanus de Gatesheued,\" granted to Isabella Strinolyne a tenement in Gateshead, to be held by the an nual payment of 2s. to the altar of St. Mary, in the north porch of St. Mary's in Gateshead, and of 18d. to the altar of -S7. Trinity, in the body of the said church. St. John's chantry appears to have been founded by John Dolphamby of Gateshead, about the year 1421, in which year he granted 14 tenements in Gateshead to it. Conan Barton, of Sadbury, Esq. was its patron in 1496. There was no deed of foundation to be shewed in 1545, when its yearly value was \u00a36, 12s. 8d. St. Loy's chantry was also founded by John Dolphamby, about 1442, and had Conan Barton, of Sadbury, Esq. for its patron. Both these persons' names occur in grants in the vestry ; but neither the chantry of St. John, nor of St. Lov, are mentioned. Richard Jackson appears to have been its last incumbent, and to have had, in 1553, a pension of \u00a33 a year. It is not mentioned in the Augmentation-office certificate of colleges and chantries for this county and Northumberland, in 1545. t In 1719, an old brass seal was dug up from under a third pavement, in sinking a well at Carlisle, with the following legend : \u2014 \" S.' Beate Marie de Gathesevid.\" Bishop Nicholson sent the seal to Doctor Elli- son, with his opinion, that it belonged to the church of St. Mary in Gateshead, and an observation, that if the rector and church-wardens had a common seal, tlie case was extraordinary. Yet, say Dr. Ellison's MSS. \"I find an account that St. John's church in Newcastle had a common-seal.\" \u2014 There is affixed to a will remaining in the Augmentation Office, dated at Gateshead, on Monday before Martinmas-day, 1427, a beautiful fragment of a seal of this church, representing the salutation of the Virgin Mary. \u2014 Brand, vo/.i. p. 488.

The Parsonage, which nearly adjoins the church on the east, is a commodious house, with gar dens, and commands a fine view towards the river. In 1783, Egerton, bishop of Durham, granted .PlOO dilapidations, paid by Dr. Lambe's executrix on account of the Master's house in St. James.'s Hospital, to the rector, to be expended on the rectory-house, of which sum upwards of \u00a3J65 was employed in rebuilding the east end of the rectory, and the remainder in enlarging the drawing room. This room was taken down in 1814, and the east end enlarged at the rector's expense. The Glebe, besides the house and gardens, consists of a field at High Team, of 5 acres, 2 roods, and 20 perches ; a field of 3 acres, 2 roods, and 30 perches, between the Middle and Stony Flats; also a field of 3 acres and 12 perches, bounded on the north by the Hexham road ; a field of 3 roods and 32 perches, at Bensham ; and a field of 1 acre, 3 roods, and 25 perches, adjoining the rectory-house and gardens, and now called the Rectory Field. These three fields last mentioned were obtained in January, 1815, in exchange for two fields at Low Team, of 2 acres, 2 roods, and 35 perches, a way-leave between them, for which Sir Thomas Liddell paid \u00a38 per annum, a ruined cinder-oven and ale-house, and a close of 2 acres, 2 roods, and 37 perches, all in the parish of Whickham. The exchange was made under an act of parliament for enclosing part of Whickham parish, between the late John Carr, of Dunston Hill, Esq. and the rector of Gateshead, with con sent of the bishop of Durham, who also enfranchised the Rectory Field. The Register of the parish commences in 1559, and has been well kept. There is an hiatus in the latter end of Queen Elizabeth's leign, and the beginning of that of King James I. In 1658, seventeen of the four-and-twenty of the parish of Gateshead were displaced, as being \"persons who, by the humble peticon and advice, were disabled from exercising any place or office on pub lique trust, and guilty of profaneness and other crimes, soe as they are not fitt to be entrusted in that employment ;\" and their places filled by other godly and sober inhabitants of the borough, by order in council, dated at Whitehall, Tuesday 22d June, grounded on certificate from Robert Fenwick and Henry Ogle, Esqrs. and John Topping, governor of Tynemouth. The ancient four and-twenty still nominate the church- wardens, the overseers of the poor, constables, &c. and gene rally make orders for such things as are paid out of the church-rate. In 1657, the parishioners of Gateshead complained bitterly that their rector, Mr. Weld, had for eight years refused \" the favour of administering the sacraments to any of his parish, but to eight women and two men, weak and unstable persons that (were) sublimed his converts ;\" nor would he permit his excommunicated flock, consisting of 1000 persons, to engage a lecturer to administer the means of salvation.* The following are extracted from the parish-books : \u2014 1626.

In consequence of this, a person famously skilled in the science of distinguishing a true witch by proper trials and symptoms, was brought from Scotland by Thomas Shevil and Cuthbert Nicholson, two of the serjeants. On the arrival of this cunning professor, who was to be paid twenty shillings a head for alike could condemn, the magistrates sent their bellman through the town, proclaiming that \" all people that would bring in any complaint against any woman for a witch, they should be sent for, and tried by the person appointed.\" Thirty women were accused and brought into the Town Hall, where they were publicly examined in a manner the most shockingly indecent. \" The said reputed witch-finder acquainted Lieutenant-colonel Hobson, that he knew women whether they were witches or no by their looks: and when the said person was searching of a personable and good-like woman, the said colonel replied, and said, surely this woman is none, and need not be tried, but the Scotchman said she was, for the town said she was, and therefore he would try her: and presently, in sight of all the people, laid her body naked to the waist, with her cloaths over her head, by which fright and shame all her blood contracted into one part of her body, and then he ran a pin into her thi\"h, and then suddenly let her coats fall, and then demanded whether she had nothing of his in her body, but did not bleed ? but slu-T, bem*** amazed, replied little; then he put his hand up her coats and pulled out the pin, and set her aside as a guilty person, and child ofthe devil, and fell to try others, whom he made guilty. Lieutenant-colonel Hobson, perceiving the alteration ofthe aforesaid woman, by her blood settling in her right parts, caused that woman to be brought again, and her clothes pulled up to her thigh, and required the Scot to run the pin into the same place, and then it gushed out of blood, and the said Scot cleared her, and said she was not a child of the devil.\" One wizard and fourteen reputed witches belonging to Newcastle, in company with nine thieves and a witch of the county of Northumberland, were executed upon the Town Moor on the 21st of August this year. The witch-finder was afterwards appre hended in Scotland, and cast into prison, indicted, arraigned, and condemned for such like villany exercised there; and upon the gal lows he confessed he had been the death of above two hundred and twenty women in England and Scotland, for the gain of twenty shillings a-piece. \u2014 Gardiner, p. 116, Newcastle Ed. of 1796."], [227, "GATESHEAD. 91 skin for the rammers, 8d. ; bringing up and carrying downe 9 great gunns, \u00a31, Os. 4d. ; 9 tar- barrells and labourers, Ils.; labourers bringing the ale and powder barrlls, 2s.; for mending the church-yard wall, wch was pulld down for the gunns, 2s. 6d. 1702-3. 13 Jan.

No rent has been paid for these premises for many years; but we (the Parliamentary Commisr sioners) conceive that so long as the parishioners have the use of them, a fair rent ought to be set upon them, and the amount should be paid by the parish tothe church-wardens to be distributed to the poor. Having expressed this opinion to the rector and parish officers, a vestry meeting was held pursuant to notice on 28th September, 1829, when it was determined that the overseers of the poor should put the house into repair, in consideration of the use the parish had had of it for several years past ; that so long as the same should be occupied by the paupers of the parish, the overseers should pay to the church-wardens \u00a34 a year rent for the same; and that the church-wardens should be desired to apply to the next quarter sessions for the payment of \u00a31 a year as ground-rent for the lock-up-house; and that the rents above mentioned, with others, should be distributed annually to the industrious and de- serving poor in charity.\" July 16, 1728. \u2014 Thomas Powell gave all his property towards building an alms-house for the poor of the parish.

The reason of that parish being precluded seems to be as follows : that he was whipped in that lown as a vagrant, by which it appears that his parents were but of low and mean condition. It has been thought, as he lived in Silver Street, London, among the working silver smiths, that he belonged to that profession; but an inscription in Great Bookeham church, Surrey, calls him citizen and salter, of London. He was once married; but his wife died many years before him, without issue. He appears to have been extremely covet ous, and obtained the nick-name of Dog Smith because he kept no house, but dined at friends' tables, and then desired a bit for his dog.

In 1755, this turnpike security was disposed of, and \u00a3200 was applied towards building the alms-house mentioned above. The other \u00a3100 was lent on interest to the then rector; but, in 1702, it was agreed, at a meeting of the inhabitants, that this sum of \u00a3100 should be called in, and appropriated to the erecting of a gallery at the west end of the church, and that the profits arising from the seats should be given to poor housekeepers as other legacy money. The sum of \u00a3100 having been thus appropriated, the interest was paid to the poor out of the rents of the seats, and the surplus of these rents was vested in the three per cent, consols. In 1788, the stock so purchased was sold for \u00a3128, 13s. 3d.; and \u00a3105, part thereof, was laid out on a mortgage, and the residue, after paying certain expenses, was distributed to the poor. In 1824, the sum of \u00a3105 was called in and deposited in a savings bank at Newcastle, and it still remains there in the names of the rector and church-wardens. The interest, which is now paid at the rate of \u00a33, 0s. 8d. per cent, and amounts to \u00a33, 10s. per annum, is carried to the general charity account. Since 1755, the whole ofthe premises, purchased with the benefaction of Thomas Powell, viz. the building originally intended for an alms-house and those subsequently erected, have been used as a parish work- house, and no interest has been paid in respect of the sum of \u00a3200, laid out as above mentioned. This being complained of by the Commissioners for inquiring concerning Charities, it was resolved, at a vestry meeting held 28th September, 1829, that the sum of \u00a310 a year should be paid out of the poors rates to the church-wardens as a rent for the additional part of the poor-house erected in 1755, that being the amount of interest at the rate of five per cent, on the sum of \u00a3200 advanced from these cha- rities, such rent to be considered as due at Christmas yearly ; and that the rents thereinbefore ordered to be paid should be distributed to the industrious and deserving poor in charity, according to the in- tentions of the respective donors.

Since June 21, 1821, the parochial affairs of Gateshead, as far as regards the maintenance of the poor, have been regulated by a select vestry, consisting of the rector, the four church-wardens, the four overseers, and twenty of the principal rate-payers. The thirteenth report of the select vestry contains the following table, shewing the rental collected upon, the rate per pound, the amount of rate collected and disbursed, the sum paid for county-rate, the number of poor and illegitimate children, and the average expense of maintaining each person in the poor-house, per week, including clothing, for the last ten years : \u2014 In former years, the maintenance of the regular poor was often farmed.

Tanner informs us that one Uttan was abbot of a monastry here before the year 653 ; and Le- land imagines this hospital to \" be lykelehod the same that Bede spekythe of.\" However this may be, the monastry must have perished in the storm of Danish invasion. A certain chapel or hospi- tal, dedicated to the Holy Trinity, was certainly in existence previous to the year 1200, as appears by a grant of lands to this establishment by Osmund son of Hama, consisting of four acres in Harlei, nearest to the grove of Benchelm. The house then consisted of one chaplain and three poor brethren. Henry de Ferlington, constable of Durham, also contributed his lands in Kyoe, near Lanchester ; and, by charter, Baldwin wi' the Head gave to Gerard, son of Geve, steward of this hospital, seventeen acres in the sovith part of his field called Alrisburne, reserving from the hospital 8d. rent towards the reparation of Tyne Bridge. In 1248, Bishop Farnham, because its brethren from their poverty neither led a secular nor a religious life, united this house with his new foundation of \" The Chapel and Hospital of St. Ed- mund, King and Confessor, and of the glorious Bishop Cuthbert, in Gateshead.\" This consoli- dated foundation was endowed with the whole village of Ulkistan (Ouston) ; the old lordship of Gateshead ; the wood of Benchelm, containing 43 acres, and lying between the arable land of St. Trinity and the road leading to Farnacres ; and with 29 acres of escheated land in Alures-acyres. By the confirmation charter, it was to consist of four chaplains or priests ; one of them to be mas- ter, and eat at the same table, and sleep in the same chamber with his three brethren, and pay each of 20s. a year. It had a clear revenue of .\u00a318 a year in 1292. Some subsequent benefac- tions occur of very trifling amount. In Bishop Skirlaw's time, it is called \" The Hospital of St. Edmund the King,\" and is said to have consisted of \"brethren, sisters, and paupers;\" and, in 1448, Bishop Neville appropriated it, with its revenues, to the convent of St. Bartholomew, in Newcastle, by the name of \" The Hospital of St. Edmund the Bishop.\" This grant was made on account of a fire that had happened in the nunnery, and misfortunes which had reduced them to great distress, and in consideration of their finding two priests to officiate in the chapel here. From this time, the hospital became, as it should seem, a mere stipendiary charity, dependant on the White Ladies; and the prioress held her courts, by her steward, in the chapel of St. Ed- mund's, for the lands of the nunnery in Gateshead. It was surrendered in 1540. In 1544, it had a clear yearly revenue of \" \u00a3\"J, 7s. 9d. which Doctor Bellasses now master of the same hath towards hys lyvyng, and giveth out of the same four marks by the year to a prieste to say masse there twyse in the weke for the commoditie and easement of the parishioners that do dwelle farr from the parish churche.\" After the dissolution, masters were regularly appointed to it. Robert Claxton succeeded Dr. Bellasses, and from him the principal farm of the hospital derives its present appellation. The original chapel of St. Trinity seems to have fallen into disuse after the union of the hospi tals of St. Trinity and St. Edmund. The ruined chapel of St. Edmund's stands opposite to the Hexham road end. It is in that style of architecture that prevailed in the reign of Henry III., from 1216 to 1272. It is well described by Grose. The west front has a door-way, under a deep pointed arch, ornamented with a profusion of mouldings and niches. The south side has five lancet windows betwixt alternate buttresses. The north side has four similar lights, and two small doors; one under a narrow pointed arch, and another under a trefoil head. The east front has three lancet lights. The building seems to have consisted of one aisle, 25 yards long, and 6A broad. Several steps to the altar still remain, near to which is an antique graye-stone. The re-"], [232, "96 CHESTER WARD\u2014 E.

A heavy stone gateway faces the street. This house, after the dissolution, became the seat of the Riddells, a branch of the ancient baronial family of Northumberland. Sir Thomas Riddell's house and gardens suffered severely by the Scots under Lesley ; and on January 28, l7l-6, being the seat of a Catholic family, it was gutted, plundered, and set on fire by a Protestant mob.

Hutchinson supposes that there existed two contemporary hospitals in Gateshead ; the one de dicated to St. Edmund the King, the other to St. Edmund the Bishop.

For though the beautiful chapel of St.' Edmund became the seat of the Ridells, and though the principal possessions of the hospital passed into lay hands, yet, in 1543, an appointment occurs of a chaplain in the chapel of this hospital ; and, in the following year, a master also occurs. In 1545, this house was placed at the disposition of the crown. \" The Hospitalle of St. Edmund, in the parish of Gatishedde, was founded by the predecessors of the Buchoppes of Durham by reporte, but for what intent or pur pos we know not, for we have not sene the foundacon therof.\" The chapel of King James' Hospital stood on the east side of the Durham road, about a mile from Tyne Bridge. It was disused, as to public service, when Dr. Lambe was master. The same r took down the lodgings of the brethren, which adjoined the chapel, giving them some pecu- allowance in lieu of them. His executrix paid, for dilapidations, \u00a350 for the house of each of the brethren, and _P50 for the chapel (see page 89). In this situation the institution remained until 1810, when an act passed, enabling the master and brethren to grant leases of their property, in parcels not exceeding one acre, for the term of ninety-nine years, and to enable the bishop of Durham to make statutes and ordinances for the government of the hospital,* and to augment the * Shute, late bishop of Durham, in virtue of this act, made and signed the following Statutes and Or dinances, for the government of this hospital, at his \"castle of Auckland,\" the 7th day of October, in the 43d year of his consecration, the 21st of his translation, and in the year of our Lord 1811 : \u2014 \" Concerning the Master. \" 1.

In 1808, and previous to the passing of this act, a subscription was raised for the erection of a new chapel, to serve also as a National School. The building was completed in 1810, at the cost of _\u00a3?1331, 12s., and was con secrated by the bishop of Durham on the 7th of August in that year. It stands a little to the south of the old chapel, and is 80 feet in length by 40 in breadth. Adjoining the south side, 2 roods and 23 perches of ground was purchased, inclosed, and appropriated for a cemetery. Divine service is performed on Sundays by the chaplain of the hospital. General Description of ihe Borough or Town. The Tyne Bridge is undoubtedly of Roman origin.* In the reign of Henry II. it was composed of wood, and was burnt with a great part of Newcastle. Many benefactions and indulgences were, at different times, granted for its repair. In 1339, part of it was washed away by a flood. In 1414, Bishop Langley recovered the third part of the bridge belonging to the see of Durham, which third part Bishop Tunstal repaired in 1530. In 1582, a decree passed in the Exchequer, that the bishop of Durham, and not the inhabitants of the county at large, should be charged with the repairs of the third part of the bridge. In 1649, Charles I., it seems, had given timber out of the crown woods at ChopweU towards its repair. In 1770, the bishop of Durham repaired with stone-work that portion of Tyne Bridge where there had anciently been a draw-bridge. -f- On the night betwixt the 16th and l7th of November, 1771, the Tyne rose in flood from incessant rain, and the middle arch of the bridge and another arch to the south gave way with a tremendous \" 2.

These statutes and regulations shall be read over to the brethren after divine service on the first Sunday in January, April, July, and October, in every year. \" Shute Dunelm. \" Witnesses to the signing hereof, \u2014 Thomas Coulson, George Walters.\" * Tyne Bridge is supposed to have been built by the Emperor \u00c6lius Hadrian, A. D. 120, from which circumstance the Roman station by which it was protected was called \" Pons \u00c6lii.\" Many Roman coins were discovered in the ruins of the piers of this bridge, after its fall in 1771- Brand has given the engrav ing of one ofthe Emperor Hadrian, found here, and communicated by John Erasmus Blackett, Esq. He also mentions one of Trajan, and one of Antoninus, of the larger size, which were discovered amongst the ruins. Pennant likewise describes several coins posterior to the time of Adrian, probably deposited there in some later repairs. t There were anciently three towers upon the bridge. The \" stronge warde and towre on it,\" mentioned by Leland, stood near the middle, and was used as a place of temporary confinement for \" lewd and disor derly persons.\" There appears to have been a chapel in this tower. The Magazine gate stood at the north end of the bridge ; and the third tower, having \" a stronge wardyd gate,\" was at the south end, near a draw-bridge. In 1429, there was a hermitage upon this bridge, to which Roger Thornton bequeathed six marks annually. When the bridge fell in 1771, there were twenty-one houses and shops upon it, the rents of which amounted to \u00a3286 annually \u2014 For a detailed account of this ancient structure, see Mackenzie's History of Newcastle, page 204 et seq."], [235, "GATESHEAD. 99 crash, with eight of tlie houses which crowded the old bridge, and overhung its western parapet. On Monday the 18th, another south arch fell, with four other houses ; and, soon after, the whole range of buildings from the Blue Stone to Gateshead. It was found necessary to take down the remaining part of the Tyne Bridge ; and, in 1772, an act passed, \" to enable the Lord Bishop of Durham, and his successors, to raise a competent sum of money, to be applied for the repairing, improving, or rebuilding such part of Tyne Bridge as belongs to the see of Durham.\" This was done by raising \u00a312,000, secured by granting annuities Upon lives, at a rate not exceeding ten per cent. The trustees for putting this act into execution Were, \" the chancellor of the bishopric and county palatine of Durham, and Sadberge, the sheriff of the county palatine of Durham, and Sadberge, the vicar-general and principal official of the diocese of Durham,\" and several other officers in the said county, who are appointed by the bishop. In 1801, an act passed for enabling the trustees to widen and enlarge the bridge, which was effected in a masterly manner. By this act, the trustees were authorised to raise i?1000, which is to form a fund for the maintenance of the bridge. The purposes of this act were effected in 1818. Gateshead consists chiefly of the High Street. It is wide and airy, and exhibits two continued lines of buildings of various and irregular appearance; but the whole is gradually improving. It extends from the head of the Sunderland road to the head of the Bottle Bank* ' The latter, which is a continuation of the High Street, evidently derives its name from the Saxon word botle, signi fying the bank of the village. It is one of the steepest streets in England. Its lower part, ex tending from the west end of Hillgate to the Tyne Bridge, is now called Bridge Street. In 1790, Church Street, which turns eastward to the church, and avoids the steep and narrow descent of Bottle Bank, was formed, Pipewellgate runs westward from the Tyne Bridge, and parallel with the river. It is 330 yards in length. It is an inconveniently narrow and dirty street, confined on the south by a lofty and abrupt bank. The scite which it occupies was granted by Bishop Hugh to Thorold of London, under the description of \"his waste lying westward from Tyne Bridge to Redheugh.\" In 1348, a court was held before the bailiff and good men and true of Pipewellgate, and the Gategano-s as sumed the lofty title of Lords of Pipewellgate. The pipes or conduits, from which this street derives its name, terminated in an adjoining field, still called the Pant-head Close. Bailey Chare, or lane, runs westward from the High Street above 708 yards. Formerly, it crossed the High Street eastward into Oakwellgate, but is now nearly obstructed by a house built across the old passage. It has been called Half Moon Street, Marble Street, Mirk Chare, Thom- * In the house which adjoins Mr. Price's residence on the south lived Robert Clover, of whom Mr. Hilton has given a brief memoir. He was born at Gateshead December 5, 1738, and was buried there on June 15, 1757; yet, in that narrow circle of time, he gave proofs of extraordinary genius. He acquired such nice skill in music as excited the admiration of Mr. Charles Avison, one of the first masters in the profession. Unassisted by masters, he made great advances in drawing, and portrait, landscape, aud miniature paintin\". He also made considerable progress in modern languages, in astronomy, and the mathematics. When only fifteen years of age, he wrote two poetic pieces, in imitation of Milton's L' Allegro, which Mr. Hilton pub lished with his own poems. But such indefatigable labour was too much for a delicate constitution ; and he died when approaching to manhood, beloved and esteemed by all who knew him. William Hilton, mentioned above, brother of a Captain Robert Hilton, seems to have lived in Gateshead. He wrote two tragedies ; the one called \" The Siege of Palmyra,\" and the other \" Arthur.\" His numerous poems, some of which display considerable poetic genius, were published by subscription, in two volumes, in 1755. They are mostly on local scenes and circumstances. He also wrote \"Titus in Sandgate,\" and this \"Ship-owner's Manual.\""], [236, "100 CHESTER WARD.\u2014 E. D. linson's Chare, and Miller's Lane. The ancient and present name of Bailey Chare* probably arose from Thomlinson being the bailiff of the manor, and the great man of the day in the parish. Ellison Street, which also runs westward, has been only recently formed. Further south is Jack- son\"s Chare, which formerly led to the coal-pits worked in the town- fields. West Street extends from the west end of Jackson's Chare to the west end of Bailey Chare. It is called Angiport in some ancient charters, and in modern times the Back Lane or Mirk Lane. Prior to 1745, the great post-road came down this lane, and entered the High Street by Bailey Chare. In that year, six feet of earth was taken off' the Bottle Bank, a passage was opened through the rock above the west end of Oakwellgate Chare, and the Pinfold, which stood in the middle of the street opposite the Five-wand Mill, was removed to the Windmill Hill. West Street contains several good houses, which command a fine prospect of the vale of the Tyne. On leaving the Tyne Bridge, the first street leading eastwards is Hillgatef (anciently Hellegate), or St. Mary's Gate, which runs parallel to the river 254 yards. The Church Stairs and Church Walk run along the north side of the church-yard ; and Canon Street, which leads to Oakwellgate, bounds the south side. Oakwellgate lies nearly parallel to the High Street, and, at the south end, is airy and spacious. It is supposed to have taken its name from an ancient well, once over-. shadowed by a broad branching oak.| Brand was informed that three strata of pavement wero * On September 19, 1820, a committee was appointed to ascertain and fix the names of the several streets, chares, and lanes or gates, in this town. t April 13, 1767, a fine brig was launched off a boat-builder's quay in Hillgate, Gateshead, being the first ever built in that street. \u2014 Newspaper. Daniel de Foe, when \" sorely prest by persecuting foes,\" sought refuge in Gateshead, and, at his residence in Hillgate, produced the universally admired \" Adventures of Robinson Crusoe.\" This ingenious and vo luminous writer was a native of London, originally a hosier. With the usual imprudence of superior genius, he neglected business for the enjoyment of study and company. Before he was twenty-one, he appeared as an author ; and, during the succeeding twenty years of his life, he was unconsciously charging a mine which afterwards blew himself and his family into the air. He had fought for Monmouth ; he had opposed King James ; he had vindicated the revolution ; he had panegyrized King William ; he had defended the rights ofthe collective body of tho people ; he had displeased Lord Godolphin and the Duke of Marlborough, hy, objecting to the Flanders war ; he had bantered Sir Edward Seymour and Sir Christopher Musgrave, the Tory leaders of the Commons ; he had just ridiculed all the high-flyers in the kingdom ; and he was at last obliged to seek for shelter from the indignation of persons and parties, thus overpowering and resistless. A proclamation was issued January, 1703, offering a reward of \u00a350 for discovering his retreat. He was de scribed in the Gazette as \" a middle-sized spare man, about forty years old, of a brown complexion, and dark brown hair, though he wears a wig, having a hook nose, a sharp chin, grey eyes, and a large mole near his mouth.\" He immediately published an explanation of the reputed libel ; but being apprehended, he was tried, found guilty, and sentenced to the pillory, fine, and imprisonment. Queen Anne had always befriended him ; but, after her death, he was stunned by factious clamour, and overborne by unmerited obloquy ; and, while suffering from sickness and persecution, he quitted the banks of the Thames, and wrote his most popular performance. Yet every bookseller refused to purchase the manuscript, until Taylor, in 1719, published it, and soon cleared \u00a31000, As to the story that De Foe had surreptitiously obtained the papers of Alexander Selkirk, a Scotch mariner, who., having suffered shipwreck, lived on the island of Juan Fernandez four or five years, it is scarcely worthy of serious refutation. Yet what is needful to repel this charge has been amply afforded by his late biographer, George Chalmers, Esq. Selkirk, in truth, had no papers to lose ; and internal evidence is decidedly in favour of the pure and entire originality of De Foe's inimitable fiction. De Foe died in April, 1731, and is unquestionably one of the most ingenious, honest, and elegant writers in the English language. X The scite of Ake or Oak Well is now totally unknown. The Chille Well, St. Elyn's Well, and other ancient pants or wells mentioned in old charters and inquests, have also been lost. Gateshead is still but ycantily supplied with water. In 1615, Robert Ellison, of Newcastle, let certain springs on Gateshead Fell,."], [237, "GATESHEAD. 101 discovered at the scite of the well ; but the place is now unknown. Some buildings in Oakwell gate have acquired the appellation of King John's Palace. Between the High Street and Oak wellgate, the wealthy and loyal Sir John Cole had his gardens and residence. His mansion was afterwards tenanted by Henry Jenkins, Esq. of Barnes, in the county of Durham. In 1762, it was converted into a manufactory of broad-eloths, and afterwards occupied by Messrs. Macleod as a brewery. It is now occupied by Mr. John Abbott as a brass-foundry, &c. It had been splen didly furnished, as appeared by a chimney-piece in an upper room, which was finely ornamented with scripture histories, &c. carved in oak, and supported by turns with a profusion of flowers and foliao-e. A long range of houses, called East Street, has been lately built between the north side of the Quarry Field and Nun's Lane, from which Bolivar Place (built by a society of working men) and some other streets diverge westward. There are a few lesser passes and avenues, called Oakwellgate Chare, Oakwellgate Lane, East Bailey Chare, Gordon's Entry, and Cooper's Entry. Gateshead, in ancient days, had a borough market ; and as late as 1577, in a suit at York, be tween Richard Natrass and the town of Newcastle, respecting a free Market and Fair in Gates head, witnesses deposed that they had seen a market or fair held twice a week, on Tuesdays and Fridays, when wheat, bigg, and cattle used to be exposed to sale, about a cross, between the toll booth and the pant or conduit ; and beans, pease, oatmeal, and other goods and merchandise, sold at the \" Brige-yate.\" The Toll-booth stood in the main street, a little below the west end of Oak wellgate Chare. In 1700, it was used as a school-room, but afterwards converted into a Bridewell, and taken down when the miserable and scandalous Lock-up-house was built at the head of the Church Stairs. In 1814, an act was passed for \" cleansing, lighting, watching, and improving certain streets\" in Gateshead, and by which the commissioners are endowed with considerable powers. Since that time, the foot-paths, particularly in the High Street, have been much improved. The rate levied under the street act amounts to about \u00a3500 per annum. By the Durham and Tyne Bridge Road Act, passed in 1824, the trustees are authorized to make a branch 138 yards in length, to com mence at the east side of the High Street, opposite to Bailey Chare, and to proceed in a semicir cular direction to near the south gate of the church-yard. On the afternoon preceding the commencement of the two great Newcastle fairs in August and October, a shoe-fair has been held in the High Street, Gateshead, from time immemorial. Though there are no public weekly market in this town, yet its internal trade is very considerable, and its numerous and various manufactures would impart consequence to any place. The depressing in fluence of the corporation of Newcastle has ceased to be felt, and an union of interests has con verted the inhabitants of both sides of the river into one community. About the beginning of the last century, an inhabitant of Gateshead was prosecuted by the mayor and burgesses of Newcastle for daring to brew ale on his premises. Now there are six maltsters and above 60 inns and public houses in Gateshead parish.* Mr. John Abbott's extensive iron, brass, copper, and plumbery which had formerly run to the Heworth mills, in trust for the people of Gateshead, for 41 years, at 6s. 8d. per annum ; but since these springs were, by act of parliament, granted to the town of Newcastle, no reser vation being made for public fountains in Gateshead, the inhabitants have suffered great inconvenience. The principal supplies of water are now obtained from the Newcastle Water Company, brought from a pond adjoining to Gateshead Fell, and several springs in the parish, particularly in Pipewellgate, from each of which it is conveyed by water carls into the different streets, and sold to the inhabitants. * Mr. William Errington, who opened the first beer-house in Gateshead under the new act, has established a <' Savings Society,\" the members to pay 6d. each every fortnight, and \" the price of a pint of ale {\" vol. i, 2 D"], [238, "102 CHESTER WARD\u2014 E. D. Works, give employment to a number of men. The iron foundery of Mr. William Hymers and Co. also merits notice ; and likewise the brass and iron works of Mr. E. Waters, in Pipewellgate. But this street is chiefly distinguished by the glass manufactories of Mr. Joseph Price,* called the \" Durham Flint Glass Works,\" and the \" Patent Plate Glass Works.\" In this street there are also three whiting manufactories, a glue manufactory, and the spade and shovel manufactory lately carried on by Mr. John Nailor. In Hillgate there is a steam flour-mill ; an oil-mill belonging to Mr. Straker of Jarrow ; the works of Mr. Bulcraig, millwright and steam-engine builder ; and a large vinegar manufactory and whiskey distillery belonging to Mr. Hew Singers. Mr. Oswald has a worsted and yarn manufactory in Canon Street ; and in Roddam's Entry, Bottle Bank, is a mustard-mill. There are five rope and twine makers, including a manufactory for patent rope, and eight tobacco-pipe makers, in this town ; and many other branches of industry, of which the plan and limits of this work forbid an enumeration. -j- At the eastern extremity of Hillgate, called the South Shore, is the yard of Mr. M'Leod, block and mast maker ; the yard of Mr. Bowlt, boat-builder ; and, on the bank above, Mr. Richardson's chain-cable manufactory, and kilns for burning lime. Further down is the timber-yard of Messrs. Shadforth and Todd ; and the extensive iron warehouses of Messrs. Cargill, Johnson, and Co. The coke manufactory of Mr. Thomas Robson at Blackwall, a paint manufactory belonging to Mr. T. C. Gibson, the timber-yard of Mr. Robert Scott, and a paper manufactory carried on by Messrs. Cox and Co., are all seated on the banks of the river. But the extensive iron works of Messrs. William Hawkes and Co. deserve peculiar notice. These works were commenced about seventy years ago, by the late ingenious and industrious William Hawkes, Esq.| and, during the late war, were employed in executing large contracts for anchors, chains, and various articles of naval ironmongery, for the royal dock-yards and the East India Company. Messrs. Hawkes also manufacture, for the general trade, all kinds of articles in iron and steel. Here is a mill for boring cannon and other cast-metal cylinders, three forges wrought by steam-engines, an engine for grinding edge-tools, a slitting and rolling mill, and one of the largest founderies in England. At present, there is here a cast-iron cylinder, 82 inches in * This enterprising gentleman, who has had the merit of creating his own fortune, is also a glass stainer and painter. In 1814, he obtained a patent for making glass with that soft and agreeable light which before could only be produced by grinding the glass ; and, in 1818, he was presented with a large silver tankard, on which was the following inscription : \" Presented to Mr. Joseph Price, by the shippers and manufacturers of lead, and the wharfingers of the goods trade between Newcastle and London, as a mark of their appro bation for his zeal and spirited exertions in the towing of vessels upon the river Tyne.\" + By the regulations of the Reform Bill now pending, Gateshead, which is only a borough by prescription, will be privileged to send a representative to parliament. X William Hawkes affords a striking example of what may be effected by skill and persevering industry. He was originally a working blacksmith, and first commenced business with Michael Longridge, Esq. a gentleman of great spirit and knowledge in business. After this firm was dissolved, Mr. Hawkes proceeded on his own account, and, during some years, was ably assisted by his son, the late ingenious William Hawkes. Sir Robert Shafto Hawkes was knighted on April 21, 1817, by George Prince Regent, at Carlton House, on the occasion of presenting an address from the borough of Gateshead. Sir Robert's son, David, who lost his sight early in infancy, possesses considerable musical genius. Such was his early proficiency under Mr. Thompson, that he performed the service on the organ of Gateshead church when only seven years of age. On January 25, 1824, he opened the new organ in the same church in a very masterly style. His principal compositions are, an overture, not published, containing some very brilliant points, and variations to the \" Keel-row.\""], [239, "GATESHEAD. 103 \u25a0diameter, and which, it is computed, will, when finished, weigh 17 tons. Beams for steam engines are sometimes made here, weighing upwards of 14 tons. The impetus of the chief forge-hammer is equal to five tons, and it gives 90 strokes in a minute. Anchor shafts, weighing two tons, are, by the machinery used in the forge, manufactured with surprising facility ; and a very great saving is made in manual labour. The first machine in England for testing iron chains was erected here. Every chain is tested by a power which may be augmented to 90 tons ; and every link is proved by being struck, while stretched out, with a sledge hammer. The weight of 100 fathoms of chain cable in the navy is limited to 217 cwt. 3 qrs. 18 lb. ; but chains are some times made above this weight for other purposes. Mr. Brunton, in 1813, obtained a patent for certain improvements in the construction of chain-cables and moorings, the peculiar merit of which consisted in placing a broad-ended or over-lapping stay across each link, to keep the sides from collapsing, and also to make the link parallel edged ; but these improvements were considered such slight variations from those formerly adopted, that many manufacturers conceived they had a right to copy them. This assumption was contested by the patentee, who instituted a suit in the Court of Chancery against Messrs. Hawkes, which was finally decided in the Court of King's Bench, May 25, 1820; since which time, Messrs. Hawkes have continued to manufacture iron cables and moorings with struts, under an agreement with the patentee. Below Hawkes' works is the manufactory of the Tyne Crown Glass Company.* This firm has also commenced the making of soda ; and, at Friars Goose, Messrs. Clapham and Co. have erected buildings for the manufacture of the same article. The colliery at this place gives employment to about 100 men. Its extraordinary steam-engine will be noticed hereafter. Ship-building was, until lately, carried on with spirit at New Greenwich and the Salt Meadows.f A coal-staith has lately been erected at the South Shore. The coals are conveyed in carts from Kibblesworth. A short distance from the lime-kiln at the west end of Pipewellgate stands New Stourbridge, where there is a flint-glass-house, belonging to Mr. George Sowerby, and Mr. Homer's cable-chain and nail manufactory. A little further up is the new and extensive paper manufactory of Messrs. J. J. Harrison and Co. The iron works on the Teams are at present suspended, except one forge worked bv Messrs. Hawkes and Co. In 1818, a joint share company was formed for lighting the town with gas, which establishment is still continued. A Subscription News-room was instituted January 3, 1820, and is now in the premises of Mr. George Watson, bookseller, Bottle Bank. It is remarkable that the Gateshrad Society for the Prosecution of Felons was the first society for that purpose established in Great Britain.

D. rector of Gateshead, by deed, dated January 9, 1701, gave to certain trustees the sum of _P300, to be by them laid out in the purchase of some rent-charge, or land, for the perpetual maintenance of a free school in Gateshead ; and directed that in case the toll-booth, which was then used as a school, could not be had for that purpose, this his gift should be settled upon the Anchorage, adjoining the parish church of Gates head ; the master to be chosen by the rector of Gateshead for the time being, and to be a poor clergyman, if such a one should be found in all respects qualified. And he directed that the said master, in consideration of the salary derived from the above source, should teach, or be ready to teach, all the children of the parish of Gateshead the Latin and Greek tongues, as also to write and cast accounts, and the art of navigation and plain sailing ; that the rector of Gateshead should at least once a year inspect the said school, and that the master should every morning read prayers to the scholars, and should every Sunday require his scholars to attend him to church, morning and evening, and should afterwards hear them say the church catechism. During the time of the present master, and at least five of his predecessors, the number of free scholars has been limited to 15 ; and, in addition to the branches of learning mentioned above, reading, English grammar, geography, and mathematics, are now included in the departments taught. Mr. James Charlton is the present master, and, with two assistants, instructs about 100 scholars, including the 15 free scholars (who are appointed by the rector of Gateshead), in the above branches of education.* Chapel School. \u2014 This school was established in 1808, in Mr. Methuen's Long Room, and is conducted according to Dr. Bell's plan. It was removed to St. Edmund's chapel in 1810, and hence called the Chapel School. It is attended by about 350 children, viz. 220 boys and 130 girls. All the children in the parish of Gateshead are admissible into this school on arriving at the age of six years, and paying a penny a week. Several donations, increased by interest, and the surplus of annual subscriptions, amounting to _P300, form, it is hoped, \" a permanent esta blishment for the institution.\" The interest of this sum, amounting to \u00a3*12 a year, is applied towards the payment of the master's salary ; the deficiency being made up by an annual subscrip tion, and the weekly contributions of the boys. The salary of the mistress is paid by the weekly contributions of the girls, and a subscription by several ladies of the parish. Mr. William Arm. strong and Ids wife are the present teachers. Several of the original benefactors to this useful establishment have died or removed; but, happily, this deficiency has been supplied by new con tributors, and the funds at present are in a flourishing state.

The present minister, the Rev. Hamilton Murray, succeeded Mr. Seivewright, who resigned for a living in Scotland. The Rev. W. M'Connel was the predecessor of the latter. He was an amiable, unassuming man, an excellent mathematician, and an adept in various branches of natural philosophy. The Wesleyans have a neat, commodious meeting-house in High Street. It was built in 1815, and has accommodations for a great number of persons. In 1819, \" the Church of England Religious Tract Society\" was formed in Gateshead ; and, in 1821, \" the District Committee,\" for the deanery of Chester Ward, in aid of the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge. \"The Gateshead Friendly Society,\" formed January 1, 1813, on the model of the Castle Eden Society, deserves particular notice. It was for several years partly supported by the annual subscriptions of honorary members, who, in case of necessity, are ready to renew their donations. At present, it consists of 65 members ; and, notwith standing the large sums paid, its capital is nearly _(?1100. \" The Amicable Society of Trades men,\" after existing 16 years, seems to have been improperly dissolved ; for the widows entitled to annuities were paid \u00a3?80 each ; and each member got nearly what he had contributed, and four per cent, at compound interest during the time the society had had the money. If there had been about _P100 more capital, each member would have received the full of what he had contributed, with the above interest. There are many benefit societies of lesser note in Gateshead ; and the inhabitants participate largely in the expenses and benefits of the various religious, charitable, and provident institutions that exist in Newcastle. The Windmill Hill is studded with corn-mills, which, seen at a distance, impart a lively and picturesque effect to the landscape. Bensham is pleasingly diversified with neat villas, numerous gardens, and well cultivated fields. Ravensworth Terrace, on the slope of the bank, consists at present of thirteen good houses, erected by the subscriptions of a building society, and commands a fine view of the castle and grounds from which it is named. Union Place, and other contigu ous rows of buildings, are inhabited by genteel families. Small but convenient houses are also erecting at Bensham Bank-foot. The vicinity of Gateshead is greatly improved and beautified by the extensive nursery-grounds of Messrs. W. Falla and Co. Nearly 30 acres of land has been laid out for a nursery on the east side of Gateshead, and a considerable part lies between the toll-gate on the old Durham road and the south end of Gateshead ; but the most extensive part of this interesting nursery is at Carr's Hill. Altogether, these nurseries occupy above 130 acres, and are considered the most ex tensive concern of the kind in England. Cramer-Dyke House, the intended residence of Mr. Falla, stands pleasantly in the beautiful nursery^ground almost opposite to St, Edmund's chapel. It has been lately enlarged and improved ; and though it fronts northwards, yet the view is exten sive, varied, and lively. The late Mr. William Falla, who died August 4, 1830, in the 70th year of his age, was no less distinguished for knowledge and enterprise than for liberality of sentiment and benevolence of mind. His well-directed attempts to introduce the system of spade husbandry atlracted much notice, and still occupy the attention of some of our most enlio-htened statesmen. There is another nursery and seedsman in Gateshead, on a smaller scale, and there are several market gardeners in Bensham and on the Low Fell. vol. i. 2 E"], [242, "CHESTER WARD\u2014 E.

It stands north of the Sunderland road, about one mile east of Gateshead, and was built about the year 1723. The old Gategangs, about the middle of the fourteenth century, were proprietors of various parcels in the Park. The fee paid to the Park-keepers or Foresters has been mentioned before. The modern estate of Gateshead Park is held under the see of Dur ham by lease for 21 years, and is vested in Cuthbert Ellison, Esq. to whose ancestor, William Coatsworth, Esq.

Thomas Deckham, in 1614, bequeathed this estate to his daughter, Elizabeth, wife of Henry Mitford ; also to the poor of Gateshead, \" three pounds towards the bringing home of the water.\" It was sold some years ago, by George Wooler of Fawnless, to the late William James, Esq. and is now occupied by Charles Bulman, Esq. who married his widow ; but is the property of Thomas James, Esq. of Beaufront, the son and heir of the late proprietor, and who possesses lands both at Rutchester and Benwell in Northumberland. Redheugh is a neat mansion, well sheltered on the south side of the Tyne, about one mile west of Gateshead. In 1280, Alexander del Redhvgh occurs, who held the manor under the see of Durham, by homage, fealty, and suit of court. Hugh, the last male heir, died in 1420; after which, partly by descent, and partly by conveyance, Redheugh became vested in the family of White, who continued in possession, till Robert White, in 1619, sold the estate to Sir Francis Lid dell, Knt. It was mortgaged by the descendants of Sir Francis ; and the mortgagees conveyed to Francis Earl of Derwentwater, who devised to the Hon. Thomas Radcliffe and Lady Mary Rad cliffe. In 1748, Lady Mary conveyed to Adam Askew, of Newcastle, M. D. grandfather of the present proprietor.* It is now the residence of William Cuthbert, Esq. Field House stands half a mile to the south of Gateshead, and was the property and residence of Ralph Wilson, who died in 1639- This family were, for two or three descents, stewards to the Lords Lumley, and partook in the feelings and sufferings of their patrons. In 1684, Field House was the estate of Sir Ralph Carr, Knt. It was afterwards the property of the Liddells, and was sold by Joseph Liddell, Esq. to the Barras family. It is now the property and residence of Mr. Joseph Shield, merchant in Newcastle. * Dr. Askew was descended from Sir Hugh Askew, who was a courtier, soldier, and sheriff of Cumber land in the reign of Henry VIII. He practised in his profession near 50 years in Newcastle with the greatest success and approbation, and accumulated immense wealth.

When the act of parliament was passed, in the year 1809, for the division of the common called Gateshead Fell, the royalties of which belong to the bishop of Durham, another act was passed in the same year for making this district a distinct and separate parish or rectory. But it was provided \" that nothing in this act contained shall alter or affect the manor of Gateshead, or the division of the said parish into townships or separate districts, for the maintenance of the poor, or for any other civil purpose whatsoever ; but that the said manor and parish of Gateshead shall, as to those purposes, remain in all respects the same as if this act had not passed.\" One acre of land was allotted for the scite of the church and church-yard ; and trustees were authorised to raise a sum not exceeding __?1000, by rates upon the occupieis of lands, houses, and mines within the district, at the expiration of seven years from the passing of the act. The right of presentation was reserved to the bishop of Durham ; and all tithes and ecclesiastical fees within the new district or parish were rendered payable to the rector of Gateshead Fell. After various delays, the foundation-stone of the new church was laid by the Rev. John Collin son, A. M. rector of Gateshead, upon a lofty eminence called Sour-Milk Hill, on May 13, 1824; and the building was finished* and consecrated on August 30, 1825.

As the adjoining plantations approach to maturity, the situation will increase in beauty and warmth. It appears to have been customary, at a very early period, for the sheriff of Northumberland ta meet the justices itinerant coming to Newcastle at a certain well at the head of Gateshead, called the \" Chille-welle,\" the scite of which is at present unknown. The sheriff', in after years, went in procession as far on the turnpike road as Sheriff Hill, which evidently derived its name from that circumstance. In later times, the sheriff and his retinue halted at a public house known by the sign of the Cannon ; and since the formation of the new Durham road, they go no further than the New Cannon on the Low Fell.

Sheriff Hill Colliery is but too remarkable in the history of mining calamities. On June 27, 1815, Mr. William Foggett and his two brothers went below to examine the state of the workings, when they were all three killed by the blast, and eight workmen were suffocated by the after-styth. On December 11, in the same year, the furnace at the bottom of the air-shaft set fire to the brat tice which formed the air-course into the pit, in consequence of which five wastemen perished ; and on July 19, 1819, another terrible explosion took place, by which two men and thirty-three boys lost their lives. Upwards of twenty men and boys were in other parts of the mine when the accident happened, but fortunately escaped, a few only being slightly injured by the concussion and after-styth. The Blue Quarries, as its name imports, is a place where large quantities of stone are wrought. Here are a number of cottages for workmen, and a Wesleyan Methodist chapel. Wrcckington is the most noted village on the High Fell, and bounds the parish of Gateshead on the south. It runs for some distance along the east side of the old Durham road, about 3j miles south of Gateshead. The increase of buildings and population has been rapid during the last ten years ; and it has acquired additional consequence by the establishment of a hiring for servants, which takes place on the second Monday in April and the first Monday in August each year. The first hiring was held by leave of the lord of the manor, Cuthbert Ellison, Esq. on the 15th of April, 1822. Several houses branch off towards the pit, on the Washington road, near which stands the commodious villa of Mr. Davis, surgeon. This village derives its name from the Wre ken-Dyke, which divides this place from Eighton Banks,* Sheriff Hill House, which stands at a short distance west ofthe church, is the property and re sidence of Matthew Plummer, Esq. It was built about six years ago, on the edge of the hill, and is an excellent and commodious mansion. From its lofty situation, it commands one of the finest and most extensive views in the north of England. It embraces the whole line of the Tyne, the beautiful vale of Ravensworth, the city of Durham, and the German Ocean both to the north and the east. Sheriff Hill Cottage is the neat residence of James Hutchinson, Esq. an owner in the neighbour ing coal-works. The Low Fell is a well-peopled district, situated to the west of the church. The new branch of the Durham road, which commences at Potticar Lane, a little above the Sunderland road end at Gateshead, runs through the Low Fell to Leyburn Hole, and affords the traveller both a level road and a most charming prospect.

He made several experiments on the subject, and treated Dr. Rotherham with great, though apparently just, severity. Mrs. Frances Elizabeth King, mother-in-law of the Rev. John Collinson, was, during her residence in Gateshead rectory-house, most actively employed in visiting and relieving the sick and necessitous poor, having established two societies for that purpose. She also founded and supported, at her own expense, a Sunday-school at St. Edmund's chapel, for educating poor children in Christian principles. She died De cember 23, 1821, aged 64. This lady was the authoress of several useful and popular works; in particular, \" The Beneficial Effects of the Christian Temper on Domestic Happiness,\" \" Female Scripture Characters,\" and \" The Rector's Memorandum Book.\" Mr. Isaac Jopling, marble mason, was, on May 29, 1810, presented by the Society of Arts with a gold medal, for penetrating into the remotest corners of the Highlands of Scotland, discovering variety of fine marbles, working the quarries, and bringing, at great labour and expense, the produce of these almost in accessible regions into use. In 1811, his son, the late Isaac Jopling, received the silver medal of the So ciety of Arts for a plaster cast of the Gladiator. Another son, the late Joseph Jopling of Newcastle, and predecessor of Mr. Davis (the successful maker of imitation permanent black marble), was also a good sculp tor, and had a fine taste for miniature painting. Hewson Clarke served his apprenticeship to the late Mr. Huntley, chemist and druggist, Gateshead, du ring which he displayed considerable reading and acumen in a periodical paper called \" The Saunterer,\" which first appeared in the Tyne Mercury newspaper about 28 years ago. This procured him several friends and patrons ; and he was sent to the college of Cambridge by the late William Burdon, Esq. of Hartford. But he had acquired such dissipated and extravagant habits, and indulged in such ungrateful and unwarrantable attacks on his best benefactors, that he soon found himself abandoned by all his re spectable acquaintances. In the metropolis, he subsisted by writing \" The Scourge,\" and other satirical pubbeations, for which he is noticed in Lord Byron's \" English Bards and Scotch Reviewers.\" But his irregular and feverish life was short ; and he, who might have reflected honour on his age and country, died unnoticed and unlamented.

This ancient town is pleasantly situated in a valley to the west of the river Wear, and occupies* it is supposed, the scite of a Roman station, on the military way called Herman Street, leading to Newcastle, from which place it is distant 8 miles south. It is 6 miles north of Durham, 30 north east of Barnard Castle, 25 north of Darlington, 9 west-south-west of Sunderland, and 262 miles north-north-west of London. The very name of this town affords a strong evidence of its claims to the honours of a Roman station ; though no antiquary has succeeded in ascertaining the exact scite or ancient name of the station. Camden imagined that Chester was the Condercum of the Romans; and Stukeley be lieved that the first wing of the Assures lay there. Horsley merely speaks of the military road which ran from Newcastle to Chester, and from thence to Watling Street near Binchester ; and Dr. Hunter adds his testimony respecting the Roman road. Some have supposed that Walridge, a mile to the west of Chester, was the seite of the station ; but on October 9, 1816, a gold coin of the Emperor Galba was found a very short distance west of Chester ; and other scattered coins have occasionally occurred here, so as to leave little doubt of its occupation by the Romans. The Saxons, from the name of the rivulet, and the usual addition of Cestre (Castra), formed the name of Coneceastre, or Cuneceastre ; and, under that name, it became the episcopal see of Ear dulph, bishop of Lindisfarn, in 883. Here sat five of his successors, during a space of one hun dred and thirteen years, till the flight of Aldune in 995. Chester, stripped of its mitre, became first a rectorial, and afterwards, under the munificent Bishop Bek, a collegiate church (as will be particularly noticed in the General History of this County). Thus it continued until the dissolu tion. The manor has remained constantly vested in the see of Durham, and includes Boldon,. Whitburn, the Cleadons, and the copyholds in the parish of Chester. By Boldon Book, Cestre, with the villain-service and the demesne, the mill, and fisheries, is on lease for 24 marks. In Hatfield's Survey, the lands were divided in the usual manner ; free tenants, demesne lands, bond tenants, cottagers, and exchequer lands. The manor-mill and fishery in the Wear seem to have been objects of considerable consequence, and, in 1528, were leased by Cardinal Wolsey under _P4 rent, with licence to cut sufficient wood for repairs. A general enclosure of commons within the parish of Chester-le-Street took place under an act of parliament, 34 Geo. III. 1794. The several wastes divided were Chester South Moor, Chester West Moor, Plawsworth Moor, Edmondsley Moor, Whitehall Moor, and Pelton Moor, estimated to contain about 1500 acres. The allotments follow the nature of the ancient estate, and sixpence an acre was reserved to the see of Durham for ever. Chester-le-Street extends nearly a mile along the great north road, and contains many good houses. Another more irregular line of buildings runs east and west, at right angles with the former, along the banks of the Cone and Chester brook. Leland, who travelled in the reign of Henry VIIL, says, \" From Duresme, over Framegate bridge to Chester in the Street, partly by a little corne ground but most by mountainouse pasture and some mores and firres. Or I came in Chester I saw scant half a mile of it Lomeley Castel upon a hill, having praty wood about it ; and about Chester self is likewise sum woode. The toune of Chester is chiefly one streate of very meane building in height. There is beside a smaul streate or two about the church coHegiate, that hath a dean and prebendiaries, but it is a very meane building ; and in the body of the chirch"], [249, "CHESTER-LE-STREET. 113 is a tumbe, with the image of a byshop, in token that St. Cuthbert ons was buried or remained in his feretre there. At the very end of the toune I passed over Conebrooke, and there is a fair stone bridge of three arches over it. Thens to Gateshed vii miles, by mountaineous ground, with pasture, heth more, and firres, and a litle on this side Gateshead is a great cole-pit.\" There are still '*** a smaul streate or two,\" called chares, which diverge eastward from the main street towards the church ; but even these passages exhibit the improved taste of the age.* In fact, the whole place has a clean, lively, and comfortable appearance ; and though it has no weekly market, yet a considerable traffic in the necessaries of life is maintained with the industrious popu lation of the neighbourhood. Messrs. William and Thomas Murray, machinists and engine-builders, employ a number of men. They have two founderies, and a steam-engine is attached to each. In Messrs. Downing's iron and brass foundery, a steam-engine is also employed to facilitate the operations of their ma nufactory. Here are three tan-yards, a brick and tile manufactory, one malting and a brewery, a corn steam-mill west of the bridge, and Chester corn mill, recently rebuilt, and which is now also worked by steam. The Lambton Arms and the Queen's Head are both good, spacious inns, and posting houses; besides which there are fourteen other inns and taverns. Five surgeons reside here ; and there are a proportionate number of shopkeepers, blacksmiths, grocers, drapers, shoe makers, saddlers, wheelwrights, &c. Mr. George Watson, an able mathematician, keeps a classical and commercial academy ; and there is a ladies' boarding-school, with eight or nine day-schools for boys or girls. A Mechanics'' Institute was established here about six years ago ; and a neat stone edifice was shortly after erected for its use : but the books purchased are mostly on scientific subjects, and unsuited to the general reader. There are now only about 30 members on the list ; but, happily, the debt upon the building does not exceed _P50. A Wesleyan Methodist chapel was built in 1807, which contains 400 persons, and is well at tended. In 1814, the Independents erected Bethel chapel. They are both in Low Chare. There is also a licensed room belonging to the Primitive Methodists. Above 120 children attend the different Sunday-schools of the place. The old, narrow, awkward bridge across the Cone, was removed in 1821, and the present one erected. This town and neighbourhood suffered considerably by the floods on the l7th of No vember, 1771, when nearly 200 yards of the main street was covered with water, and much damage done to the shops and houses. All the low grounds from this town to Cocken were covered with the dead carcases of horses, cows, oxen, and sheep, and also with corn and hay stacks, furniture, &c. The collieries at North Biddick, Chaters-haugh, and Low Lambton, were filled with water, the engines of the two former destroyed, and upwards of thirty horses drowned in the workings. Houses, waggons, coals, and wood of all kinds, were swept oft' by the irresistible torrent. The Church. The church of Chester is a handsome, regular, stone edifice, presenting many marks of antiquity. The lower part of the tower is old, and of a square form ; but, above the roof, it is octagonal, and belongs to a subsequent period. The spire is a light, elegant, modern structure, and, with the * In the foregoing page, the writer has inadvertently copied preceding authorities, all of whom concur in stating that Chester is about one mile in length, which is more than twice its actual extent. vol. i. \u2014 6. 2 G"], [250, "CHESTER WARD.\u2014 M. D. 114 tower, is one hundred and fifty-six feet in height. There are three bells and a good clock in th<_ tower. The whole length of the church is fifty-four paces. Within are two side aisles, separated from the nave by five pointed arches, supported on pillars of different forms. The nave is thirty paces in length, and fifteen in extreme breadth. At the west end there is a gallery ; and the pul pit is placed against the centre pillar in the south row, surmounted by a heavy sounding-board, with rude carving. The south aisle is lighted with three windows, of three lights each, under pointed arches. The north aisle is almost solely appropriated to the effigies of the illustrious line of the Lumleys. \" This aisle of death\" is divided about the middle by Lord Durham's pew. It resembles a small gallery in a north transept, and was erected about two years ago, under the direction of Mr. Bonomi, architect. The entrance is by stairs and a private door on the outside. Below is the vault of the Lambton family, secured by an iron door covered with oak. The scite of this erection is supposed to have been a porch or chantry belonging to the Lumley family, for the whole north aisle appears to have been altered and curtailed, as three arches and columns sup porting them are closed up in the outer wall. Within the closed arches the windows have trefoil heads under square labels. Some of the windows have remains of curious painted glass. The tower has a handsome west window of three lights, with tracery under a pointed arch, above which is an old, double, round-headed window, closed with masonry. The chancel is only eleven paces long, and six broad. The arch which separates it is supported on light brackets. There are four small windows to the south, and a large modern sash to the east. The church is clean and well pewed, and is about being rendered more comfortable by the mo dern and excellent method of diffusing the steam of warm water. There were two chantries in Chester church, but the founders are not known ; the one dedicated to St. Mary, of the yearly value of \u00a35, 8s. 10d., to which belonged a tenement in Seaton Carowe, Thomas Holyman, incumbent at the time of the dissolution, had a pension granted him of \u00a3>4, which he received in 1553. The other chantry was dedicated to St. George, of the yearly value of \u00a35, 3s., of which Jeffrey Glenton was priest at the dissolution, and had a pension of _\u00a3?4, which was also paid him in 1553. In 1600, William Ayton died seized of a tenement cottage, six acres of meadow, fifteen of pasture, and forty of arable land, in Middle Herrington, parcel of the dis solved chantry of St. George in the church of Chester. Monuments. The Lumley monuments, consisting of fourteen effigies carved in stone, resting on as many altar-tombs, are solemnly arranged along the north aisle from west to east. A tablet records some particulars of each individual, with appropriate armorial bearings. The whole line is protected by iron rails. 1. The first effigy, evidently imaginary, represents Leulph, in a coat of mail, the right hand grasping the sword hilt, a shield on the left. The figure is much mutilated, having lost the feet : the legs are straight.* A long inscription above this venerable personage (the minister of Bishop Walcher) commemorates the whole family descent. * The following are the reasons why different attitudes had acceptance in monumental effigies : \u2014 Persons who died in battle on the victorious side were represented with the helmet on the head, the shield on the left, and the sword on the dexter side, naked, and with the point upwards. Those who died in battle on the vanquished side were represented on their tombs without their coat over their armour, with their feet resting on a dead lion, having their hands joined on their breast, the visor lifted up, and the sword in the"], [251, "CHESTER-LE-STREET. 115 2.

Sir John Lumley, almost minutely resembling the last. He was a brave knight, and highly esteemed by King Henry, who restored all the castles, manors, and lands of which his father was seized at the time of his death.

One who had served a great part of his life in the army, and afterwards became a religious person, was represented upwards in the habit of the order he professed, and below in complete armour. A gentleman or knight, who had been killed or vanquished in single combat, was represented in complete armour, his battle-axe out of his arms, lying by him, and his left arm across his right. If he had been victorious, he was represented armed on all points, with his right arm across over the left, and his battle-axe in his arms. The son of a general, or go vernor of a castle or fortified city, if he died when the place was besieged, was pourtrayed in complete armour, with his head resting on a helmet instead of a pillow. \u2014 Bailey's Diet, quoted by Hutchinson."], [252, "CHESTER WARD\u2014 M.

It was, in 1594, \"broken and wasted nere the ruynes of the chappell in the first ward within the castle called Barnard's Castle.\" Hutchinson conjectures this is the effigy that should follow the tenth monument in the arrangement in Chester church. No effigy appears of George Lumley, who perished in the insurrection that followed the Pil grimage of Grace; but a mural tablet only at the east end of the aisle betwixt 12 and 13. The mutilated effigy of a bishop, which long lay in the church-yard, was lately set up against the wall at the west end of the south aisle. Above it are placed the words, Sanctus Cuthbertus.

Chester church, dedicated to St. Mary and St. Cuthbert, a perpetual curacy. The church of Chester, one of the earliest parochial foundations in the diocese, has passed through four very different stages of existence. First, the episcopal seat of the northern bishopric was established here. Next, the church became rectorial, and so continued till Anthony Beke terminated a litigation betwixt Sir Walter Clifford and Master Alan of Esingwolde (who both claimed the rectory) by turning them both out, and erecting the church of Chestei-le-Street, which, though excellently endowed, was, it seems, scandalously ill served, into a collegiate esta blishment, consisting of a dean and seven prebendaries. The dean was invested with the altarage of the mother church and chapels, the fishery on the Wear, the rents and services of the tenants holding of the church within Chester and Walrido-e, and the whole demesne land of Harraton, with the messuages and buildings attached to the cha- pelries of Tanfield and Lamesley ; but he was bound to provide sufficient ministers for these cha- pels, and to repair the chancel of Chester. To the first prebend belonged the predial tithes of Great Lumley, Little Lumley, Lambton, Woodsend, as also the tithes of the coal-mines ; to the second prebend, of Lamesley, Kibblesworth, Ravensworth, Darncrook, Hedley, Ladesend, Tugers- land, Ravensholme, and Newhouses ; to the third, of Pelton, Pokerley, Pelaw, Pictree, Tribley, Edmundsley, Stevesley, and Nettlesworth ; to the fourth, of Chester and Whithall ; to the fifth, of Tanfield, Lynce, Crook, Tanfield-leigh, Stanley, Stanley-hall, Caldsit, and Steels; to the sixth, of Birtley, Harverton-moor, and Harden ; to the seventh, of Ulston, Urpeth, and Twisle ; and all the residue of the parish of Chester, viz. the predial tithes of Plawsworth and of Walridge, and of all the wastes within the same parish that should afterwards be reduced into tillage, was assigned and allotted unto the common residence within the parish of Chester, amongst them only equally to be divided who for three months space at least in the year continually, or for the most part, should make their personal residence in the same church, &c. Under this establishment the church of Chester continued till the dissolution of collegiate churches and chantries, in the first year of Edward VI., when, by virtue of the statute, the deanery, prebends, rectory, and the several rights of that church, became vested in the crown. The pre- bends of the seven portionists, with the vicarage or deanery of this church, were taxed in the Lin- coln valuation, 20th King Edward I. 1291, at _\u00a3146, 13s. 4d. ; but 20th King Henry VIII. 1534, the deanery and seven prebends were valued at no more than \u00a3?], 12s. 8d. in the whole, viz. the deanery, \u00a3\"41 ; prebend of Lamesley, \u00a35, 16s. 8d. ; Pelton, \u00a35, 16s. 8d. ; Chester, \u00a36 ; second prebend of Lamesley, __?10 ; Tanfield, \u00a33, 6s. 8d. ; Birtley, .\u00a33, 6s. 8d. ; and Urpath, \u00a3>2, 6s.

The following brief narrative of an apparition is inserted in Dr. Henry More's letter to Mr. Joseph Glanvil, who published it in his work intituled Sadducismus triumphatus, and is appended. to a sermon preached on the murder of Richard Dobell, by the Rev. M. Woodford, M. A. sub- dean of Chichester. Mr. John Webster, practitioner of physic, also inserted this story in his work for \" displaying and detecting supposed witchcraft,\" with the additional testimony of Mr. William Lum ley of Great Lumley, and of a Mr. Shepherdson. Of course, the testimonies of those who vouch for the truth of the story do not agree. \"About the year of our Lord 1632, near unto Chester in the Street, there lived one Walker, a yeoman of good estate, and a widower ; who had a young woman to his kinswoman, that kept his house ; who was by the neighbours suspected to be with child ; and was towards the dark of the evening one night sent away with one Mark Sharp, who was a collier, or one that digg'd coals under ground ; and one that had been born in Blackburn hundred in Lancashire. And so she was not heard of a long time ; and no noise, or bttle, was made about it. In the winter time after, one James Grime, being a miller, and living about two miles from the place where Walker lived, was one night alone very late in the mill, grinding corn. And as about twelve or one a clock at night, he came down the stairs, from having been putting corn in the hopper, the mill doors being shut, there stood a woman upon the midst of the floor, with the hair of her head hanging down, and all bloody, with five large wounds on her head. He being much frighted, and amazed, began to bless him ; and at last ask'd her who she was ; and what she wanted. To which she said, I am the spirit of such a woman, who liv'd with Walker : and being got with child by him, he promised to send me to a private place, where I should be well look'd to, until I was brought in bed, and well again ; and then I should come again, and keep his house. And accordingly, said the apparition, I was one night late sent away with one Mark Sharp ; who, upon a moor (naming a place that the miller knew) slew me with a pick, (such as men dig coals with) and gave me these five wounds ; and after threw my body into a coal-pit hard by ; and laid the pick under a bank ; and his shoes and stockings being bloody, he endeavour'd to wash them ; but seeing the blood would not wash"], [255, "CHESTER-LE-STREET. 119 forth, he hid them there. And the apparition farther told the miller, that he must be the man to reveal it, or else that she must still appear, and haunt him. The miller return'd home very sad and heavy, but spoke not one word of what he had seen : but eschew'd, as much as he could, to stay in the mill within night without company, thinking thereby to escape the seeing again of that frightful apparition. \" But notwithstanding, one night when it began to be dark, the apparition met him again, and seem'd very fierce, and cruel ; and threaten'd him, that if he did not reveal tlie murder, she would continually pursue and haunt him. Yet for all this, he still conceal'd it till St. Thomas's eve be fore Christmas, when being soon after sun-set walking in his garden, she appeared again, and then so threatened, and affrighted him, that he faithfully promised to reveal it next morning. \" In the morning he went to a magistrate, and made the whole matter known, with all the cir cumstances. And diligent search being made, the body was found in a coal-pit with five wounds in the head ; and the pick, and shoes, and stockings yet bloody, in every circumstance as the ap parition had related to the miller. Whereupon Walker and Sharp were both apprehended ; and at the assizes following were arraign'd, found guilty, condemned, and executed. \" One Mr. Fairhair (who is thought to have been the foreman of the jury) gave it in evidence upon oath, that he saw the likeness of a child stand upon Walker's shoulders during the time of the trial. At which time the judge (Davenport) was very much troubled (being supposed likewise to have seen the same apparition) and gave sentence that night the trial was ; which was a thing never used before, nor after, in Durham, where this murder was tried.\" Charities. Lumley Hospital. \u2014 John Duck, of Durham, Esq. by indenture, dated September 29, 1686, founded an hospital for the sustentation and relief of twelve poor aged and impotent people. John Pots and eleven widows were incorporated by the name of \" The Brethren and Sisters of the Hospital of John Duck, Esq. at Great Lumley, in the County of Durham,\" with power to take lands, &c. The said John Duck ap pointed that they and their successors should have a common seal, with a cross graven thereon, and in the circumference thereof also engraven, \" Sigillu Hospitalis John Duck Ar. apud Magna Lumley in Com. Du nelm ;\" and he further directed, that after the death of himself and Anne his wife, it should be lawful for the mayor of the city of Durham for the time being, and his successors, and for Nicholas Salvin and eleven others therein named (trustees designed by the said John Duck of and for the said hospital, and for a minis ter to be chosen to read prayers to the poor people therein), and such persons as should from time to time be duly elected trustees in their room, as in an indenture of release to be thereafter executed should be ex pressed, or for such other person and persons as by the said John Duck in his lifetime should be appointed, within twenty days after the death or removal of any of the brethren and sisters of the said hospital, to elect and place other persons of the religion of the Church of England as then established, and not under the age of sixty years, those poor decayed people of the town of Great Lumley and thereabouts (if any such there should be) being in the first place made choice of and preferred to the said hospital, the above-named poor per sons well and truly observing such rules and orders as by the said John Duck in his lifetime, and as after his death by the said trustees, or by the visitors thereinafter mentioned, should be appointed ; and the said John Duck further appointed, that the three senior persons of the trustees for the time being, duly elected as aforesaid (the mayor of the said city of Durham being one), should from time to time after his death be the visitors of the said hospital, and of the poor people therein, and of the minister for the time being to attend and do service there ; and should as often as they should think meet, once in three years at least, visit the said hospital. By indenture of lease and release, dated 8th and 9th October, 1686, the said John Duck conveyed to the mayor of Durham, and the other trustees mentioned in the preceding indenture, a parcel of ground, formerly a messuage, tenement, and garth, with the appurtenances, in Great Lumley, and the hospital thereon lately erected by the said John Duck, and also the closes called Robert Sides, with their appurtenances, at Great Lumley, the several closes in the townfields of Great Lumley called the Loefield North Crooks, the town end pasture, Kellee Hagg, and the moors, and a corn-mill on the river Wear, at Great Lumley, with rights"], [256, "120 CHESTER WARD\u2014 M. D. of fishery in the said river, with all the appurtenances, rights of common, and collieries thereto belonging,. upon trust, out of the clear rents and profits of the said premises, other than the said hospital, and the \"round on which the same was built, to pay to the said John Pots and others, the twelve poor aged persons., men and women, who should at any time thereafter be placed in the said hospital, the clear annual sum of 52s. per annum each, by quarterly payments ; and also to pay to a minister of the Church of England, dea con or priest, to attend and read prayers in the said hospital to the said poor aged persons, twice every day throuohout the year, the clear annual sum of \u00a310, by quarterly payments, towards his support and maintenance. The Commissioners for inquiring concerning Charities say, in their Report, \" There are no trustees now in existence for this hospital, and it does not appear that any new trustees have ever been appointed since the execution of the instruments above abstracted ; so that there are no persons capable of exercising the visitatorial power conferred by the donor on the three senior trustees. The hospital comprises twelve apart ments, with a small chapel ; and upon a tablet on the building, there is the following inscription : \u2014 \" Hos~ pitale pro xii Pauperibus Fundat : per Johann : Duck Ar : un : Aldermannor : Dunelm : Civil : Anno Domini MDCLXXXV.\" Twelve poor widows, elected from the parish of Chester or the neighbourhood, reside ia the hospital, and receive 50s. a year each, instead of 52s-, by quarterly payments; and a person, not in holy orders, who reads prayers, with a sermon every Sunday, in the chapel, receives the yearly sum of \u00a310. These payments, amounting to <\u00a340 a year, are made by the agent of Lord Durham as a charge upon pro perty in Great Lumley, which, we are informed, was purchased by one of his lordship's ancestors of the Lyon family. The hospital is kept in repair by Lord Durham, and he appoints the alms-people and the person who reads prayers. The right of appointment has been exercised by this family for many years; but we have not been able to obtain any account how they became possessed of this right ; unless, in consequence of there being no trustees, it was considered as having devolved upon the owners of the property charged with the payment of the endowment.\" Henry Smyth's Charity. \u2014 The parish of Chester-le-Street is one of those which is entitled to a share of the rents ofthe Longstock estate, belonging to Henry Smyth's charities, as stated in page 92. In the year 1829, \u00a316, 16s. was received by the church-wardens of this parish, and in former years the amount was, nearly the same. The sums thus received, together with the yearly sum of \u00a312 derived from Harrison's charity and other money, are divided amongst the different townships of the parish, except those which form part of any distinct chapelry, and except the townships of Great Lumley and Little Lumley, the for mer being entitled to a distinct share of Henry Smyth's charity, and the latter receiving a considerable sum from the voluntary gift of Lord Scarborough. The share appropriated to each township varies in proportion to its population ; and the amount, when determined, is paid to the overseer or one of the principal inha bitants. To the share reserved for the township of Chester, being about two-sevenths of the whole sum divided, there is added a donation from Lord Durham of \u00a38, and the sum of \u00a35, 4s. paid in respect of Tewart's charity, hereafter mentioned, for bread. From this fund, amounting to about \u00a322 per annum, bread is given away to the amount of about \u00a313, and the residue is distributed in the vestry on the 1st Ja nuary, in tlie presence of some of the principal inhabitants, to the poor of the township, in sums varying from Is. to 5s. The shares of the charity money appropriated to the other townships are paid over to the overseer, and distributed almost entirely in small sums of money to the poor of the respective places. This mode of distribution is contrary to the express directions of the trustees of Henry Smyth's charities, from whom the principal part of the money is derived. Harrison's Charity. \u2014 Ralph Harrison, by his will, bearing date 26th March, 1687, amongst other legacies to the poor of Boldon and other places, left \u00a3100 to the poor of Chester-le-Street. It appears from the parish accounts, that the amount of this legacy, with a considerable accumulation of interest, and probably the produce of some other benefactions, was placed iu the hands of General Lambton, grandfather of the present Lord Durham, whose agent pays annually \u00a312 a year in respect thereof. The sum thus placed is supposed to have been \u00a3200 only, and the payment of \u00a312 a year as the interest thereof, is accounted for by supposing that it was invested in the purchase of stock ; but the Commissioners were informed that there is no stock now appropriated to the payment of this money. In the parish books, the receipt of the sum of \u00a312 is distinguished from another sum of \u00a38, which has been paid by the agent of this family for many years, and which is entered as a voluntary donation. Tewart's Charities- \u2014 Elizabeth Tewart, by will, dated May 10, 1718, bequeathed her house to the minis ter of the parish church of Chester-le-Street, he paying to the parish clerk 20s. yearly. She also left certain copyhold lands in the parish, called Kellsheets, out of which she directed that \u00a36 should be paid yearly to a schoolmaster for instructing gratis twelve poor children; and that, out of the rents, twenty-four penny loaves should be distributed weekly amongst twelve poor widows and twelve other necessitous and indigent"], [257, "CHESTER-LE-STREET. 121 persons, and \u00a33 yearly for placing out one boy, born and inhabiting in the town of Chester, apprentice to some trade or employment. She further directed that two houses in Chester, called Elling's House and Chambers House, should be used for the habitation of two poor widows. On these charities the Commis- sioners report as follows : \u2014 \" The house in which the testatrix lived is now in the possession of the Rev. Thomas Hyde Ripley, the incumbent, who pays 20s. yearly to the parish clerk in respect thereof. The estate called Kellsheets, con- taining about 20 acres of copyhold land, held of the manor of Chester, is in the possession of William Mat- thews, as the owner thereof, and he makes the several payments directed by the will of the testatrix, amounting to \u00a314, 4s. per annum. The yearly sum of \u00a36 is paid by him a few days after Christmas to a schoolmaster, who rents a room in the town of Chester-le-Street for the purpose of a school. There is no other endowment than is derived from this charity ; but a subscription of about \u00a37, 7s, a year is collected and paid to him. In respect of the yearly sum of \u00a36, he instructs twelve children, as directed by the testatrix, and he takes three more on account of the money raised by subscription. The selection of the children is left chiefly to the church-warden appointed by the minister, who nominates such of the applicants as are the oldest ; no child being allowed to enjoy the freedom of the school beyond the term of two years. They are taught reading and writing gratis ; but, if they learn accounts, they pay Is. a quarter. \" The sum of \u00a35, 4s. for bread is added to the sum of \u00a37, 16s., part of Henry Smyth's charity, and the amount is laid out weekly in twopenny loaves, which are given to thirty poor persons, principally widows, of the township of Chester-in-the-Street, after evening service at the church. The persons are appointed by the minister's church-warden ; and if any of the objects absent themselves from church without reason- able excuse, they are displaced, and others appointed in their stead. The yearly sum of \u00a33, given for plac- ing out apprentices, is paid to a boy in the township of Chester-in-the-Street, sent to Mr. Matthews with a certificate from the agent of Hylton Joliffe, Esq. the owner of the house formerly belonging to John Hed- worth, upon his producing the indenture of apprenticeship. \" The premises left for the habitation of two poor widows are now converted into four cottages, and there is a garden containing about 15 perches of land adjoining thereto, and an allotment, set out upon the inclo- sure of Chester commons in 1798, containing nearly half an acre. We are informed that, 45 years ago, these premises, consisting then of two cottages with the garden, were occupied by George Liddle and \u2014 TurnbuU, they having married two sisters of the name of Forster, who claimed to be related to the testatrix. The houses have since been divided into four, and three of them are occupied by three families, the descendants of George Liddle, and the other by a person who married a daughter of \u2014 Turnbull. The parties in pos session treat them as their own property. The allotment set out on the inclosure is in the possession of Matthew Liddle, the youngest son of George Liddle, who took possession of it upon the death of his mother, with whom he resided in one of the houses at the time she died. The parishioners have contemplated tak ing steps for recovering possession of this property, so as to place poor widows therein, according to the in tent of the testatrix ; but it appears to us, that without the intervention of a court of equity this object cannot be effected, and that the proceedings would be of greater expense than the value of the property would justify.\" *** Donor unknown. \u2014 By indentures, dated December 20 and 21, 1715, John Hedworth, Esq. for securing \u00a3100 he had then in his hands for the relief of the poor of the township of Chester-le-Street, and for other purposes therein specified, gave up certain tithes for raising a sum out of which \u00a35 per annum should be paid to the poor ; after which he directed that the minister of Chester church for the time being should re ceive and take all the residue of the rents and profits of the premises thereby conveyed, as an endowment and provision for the said minister and his successors. Nothing has been received in respect of this charity for many years. Applications have lately been made to Mr. Ripley, who was presented to the living ist 1828, and he has agreed to resume the payment. Chester Deanery. The Deanery rested in the crown till the 26th July, 1608, when King James, by letters patent of that date, granted to Sir James Ouchterlony, Knt. and Richard Gurnard, or Green, citizen of London, all the Deanery, Prebends, Rectory, and Vicarage of the Collegiate and Parish Church of Chester. The grant was either in trust for the family of Hedworth, or was immediately trans ferred to them ; for, in 1614, John Hedworth, Esq. died seized of \"all the Decanal House of the Collegiate Church of Chester-le-Street, with the barns, buildings, and girnales (graneries), now waste and ruinous, and of a garden adjoining the same premises, of the annual value of ten shil- xov. i. 2 I"], [258, "CHESTER WARD.\u2014 M. D. 122 lings ; and of all those tithes of lamb and wool within the parishes of Chester, Tanfield, and Lames ley, called the Thrussel-tithes, or Thrush-tithes.\" The impropriation descended first to Richard son of John ; to Ralph, in 1680; to Ralph, his son, in 1683; to John, his son, in 1704. He was long a popular representative of the county, and died May 31, 1747. His two daughters and co heiresses (by different wives) intermarried, the younger with Sir Ralph Milbank, Bart. ; the elder with Sir Richard Hilton, of Hilton, Bart, whose only surviving daughter, Eleanor, was mother of Hylton Joliff'e, Esq. Lady Byron and H. Joliff'e, Esq. are joint owners of the Deanery, and of several other estates and collieries derived from the Hedworths. The large mass of the impro priation has gradually fallen off in detached fragments; but the largest portion ofthe corn tithes is still vested in Lord Durham, and in R. Trevelyan and Henry Witham, Esqrs. The Deanery is a handsome brick house, in a pleasant situation near the east side of the town, and commands a fine prospect of rich, cultivated grounds, and a pleasing view of Lumley Park and Castle. The enclosures of tlie Deanery adjoin the east wall of the church-yard, and probably occupy the exact scite of the old Decanal buildings. The house, gardens, and grounds were much improved by the late tenant, John Morton Davison, Esq. who has removed to his new seat, Ridley Hall, in the co. of Northumberland. The Deanery is at present occupied by Edward Johnson, Esq. of Newcastle. White Hill, or Whithill, stands one mile west of the town, near the brink of the Chester burn, overlooking a shivery cliff covered with copsewood. The east view embraces Chester spire, Lumley Castle, and a beautiful and highly cultivated country. It is the property and residence of Isaac Cookson, Esq. The manor of Whithill was, in 1310, granted to Roger de Aula de Cestria by Bishop Anthony, Patriarch of Jerusalem, to hold of the see of Durham by 48s. annual rent, and service to the manor mill of Chester. In 1438, William Melote (under sheriff of Durham) died seized of the manor of Whithill, consisting of a mansion-house and 117 acres of land, by 40s. rent and service, and the twenty-fourth part multure at the manor mill of Chester. It continued in the family of Millot till the death of John Millot, Esq.* the last male heir, who died in 1747, and, by will, devised all his estates to Henry Wastell, rector of Simonburn, who soon after sold the manor of Whithill to John Cookson, Esq. the father of the present proprietor. In the ravine of the burn between Chester and Whithill was worked the well-known Whithill forge. The iron was obtained from stone dug out of the neighbouring fells. This iron ore is supposed to have been worked both by the Romans and the Danes. Great quantities of scoria, or slag, are found on the fells, extending many miles westward. The. ancient method was, to melt the iron-stone with charcoal in a large smithy hearth or bloomery, and then reduce the metal to bar-iron in another hearth ; consequently, when the wood failed, they removed their furnace. They must have known the use of air-furnaces, or else have blown their bloomery bellows by hand * John Millot, Esq. was a man of very singular habits and conversation, as appears from a curious old screen still preserved at Whitehall, on which several of his exploits are depicted. In one compartment he is hunting, in another drinking and smoking, in the third he appears as a successful gambler, and seems to be enforcing payment of his winnings by an appeal to a brace of pistols ; and, to omit some other adventures, in the second compartment his game cock is clapping and crowing, having \" won the 100 guineas at New castle, March 31st, 1746,\" whilst three rivals, Dunn, Brandling, and Bates, lie dead at his feet, and a craven cock, inscribed Farrer Wren, Esq. is running away."], [259, "CHESTER-LE-STREET. 123 or by horses ; as the greatest quantity of slag is found in high ground, where no water could be obtained. \"About three miles west of Chester is a place called the Old Furnace, where very lately (about 1786) was to be seen the bottom of a furnace hearth, according to the usual method of building them now, but of much smaller dimensions. They had blown the bellows with a water-wheel, as appears by the cut of a water-race to convey it to the wheel from an upper part of the burn. On the opposite side of the burn is a place called the Alum Well, from the water having a strong aluminous smell and taste. The method of making metal is by putting into a large furnace, about 34 feet in height, and 12 or 13 feet wide in the broadest part, but contracted at top and bottom, a certain number of baskets of coals or cinders, to a certain number of boxes of iron stone, calcined for the purpose, and a quantity of limestone sufficient to flux it ; when a sufficient quantity is melted into the hearth or bason at the bottom of the furnace, it then is tapped with an iron bar, and run oft' into metal pigs, or large vessels prepared in loam (a composition of sand, clay, Sec), for different uses, such as brewing vessels, soap-pans, engine-pumps, cylinders, and cannon of all sizes ; and the iron-stone and coal used here are allowed, by the best judges of his majesty's warren at Wool wich, to make the strongest and soundest cannons that are proved there.\"* At Whithill is a brown paper manufactory, belonging to Messrs. Gallon and Co. ; and at Fur nace Mr. Robinson has a flint powder manufactory. The Hermitage, about one mile south-by-wist of Chester-le-Street, is the pleasant seat of Thomas Cookson, Esq. South Hill, nearly two miles soutli-by-east of the town, is the residence of Thomas Fenwick, Esq. banker in Newcastle. The grounds and gardens are tastefully laid out ; and when the young plantations arrive at maturity, this place will be very beautiful. Humble Cottage, the residence of George Liddell, Esq. stands about two miles west of Chester. The Flatts, a hamlet in this township, is situated one mile north-west of Chester. The old mansion-house is a large brick building, with enclosures. It was the seat of a branch of the Allans of Grange, who had raised a large foi tune by the collieries. Thomas Allan, Esq. (grandson of George Allan of Yarm) died l741,-f leaving a son, Thomas, who died unmarried, and four daugh ters, who became coheirs to their brother, viz. Susannah, married Ralph Jenison, Esq. of Wal worth, and died without issue; Margaret, married Jenison Shafto, Esq. and died without issue ; Dorothy, married James Garland, Esq. of Michael-Stowhall, in Essex (living in 1786) ; Camilla, married Robert Shafto, Esq. of Benwell, died the 14th of July, 1782, leaving an only child, a daughter, married to William Adair, Esq. This estate is now, by purchase, the property of Lord Durham. * Communicated by Mr. Smith, agent to Whithill works. Hutch, vol. ii. p. 504. t \" The following tablet is at this day to be seen in many of the houses of Chester : \u2014 ' On Sunday the 21st day of December, 1741, died at his house at Flatts, Thomas Allan, Esq. one ofthe principal coal-owners on the river Wear. He was a gentleman whose integrity and worth placed him in the highest estimation, and whose good nature and generosity endeared him to all his acquaintance. He was earnest in promoting the good of his country, and particularly that great support of it, its trade ; in the cause of which he embarked his fortune, and applied a most laudable industry ; manifesting in his affairs an uncommon elegance and propriety : and as his life was adorned with every virtue that dignifies human nature, so his death is uni versally a most melancholy occasion of sorrow.' \" \u2014 Hutchinson, vol. ii. p. 508."], [260, "124 CHESTER WARD.\u2014 M. D. Little Lusiley. This township is situated on the east side of the Wear, and in the north division of Easington Ward, 1| mile east-south-east of Chester. It contains Lumley Castle and Park ; also three farm steads, a corn mill at Flotters, a public house, and Lumley Forge Manufactory, where, besides aa iron and brass foundery, bar-iron, anvils, shovels, nails, and chains, are made. The acting part ner, Mr. Wright, and most of the workmen, reside in an adjoining hamlet called Breckon Hill. Lumley Castle. This castle stands majestically, glittering with a bright open aspect, on a fine elevation above the Wear, distant about one mile east from Chester. It is bounded on the north by Lumley Beck, and the ground rises gradually on the south and west from the river Wear. The east front is near the brow of a very deep, well-wooded valley, through which the Beck winds towards the river. This stately mansion forms a quadrangle, with an area in the centre. At each angle are projecting turrets, or observatories, of an octangular form, which overhang the face of each square of the base, and are machiolated, for the purpose of annoying assailants : they, however, give to the general building a singular appearance. The whole is composed of a yellow freestone, which gives a bright and beautiful tint at a distance. The chief entrance to the castle is at the west front, by a noble double flight of steps, and a platform, 94 feet long, filling the whole space be tween tlie towers. The front to the south is modern, and brought almost parallel with the tower,. being 196 feet in length. The front to the north is obscured by offices; but towards the east, the castle retains its ancient form, and has a most august appearance. Its projecting gateway, com manded by turrets, and machiolated gallery, are bold and stately. Above this gate are six shields, with armorial bearings, deeply carved in stone, with their crests, contemporary with the building ;, and which ascertain the date of its alteration by Sir Ralph Lumley, in the reign of Richard II.,. when he obtained licence from the king, in 1329, as well as from Bishop Skirlaw, to repair his Castle of Lumley, and to build a wall with mortar and stone, and to embattle the structure. It appears that the original fabric had been constructed by Sir Robert Lumley, in the reign of Ed ward I., and enlarged by his son, Sir Marmaduke. There are three stories of apartments in this front, having mullioned windows, guarded with iron. A narrow space, for a terrace, between the walls and the brink of the precipice, is guarded by a curtain. The uniformity of this front, the arrangement of the arms, and the whole appearance of its masonry, testify this to be a part of the original structure, and a grand model of the taste of the age. *__.,*_> o A beautiful prospect is exhibited from the platform, at the entrance into the hall. At the bot tom of the avenue which leads to the house, is a fine bason of water, a salmon lock, and fisherman's cottage ; and on the opposite elevated land, the view of the town of Chester, the Deanery House, and the church, compose a pleasing distance. But the more extended landscape comprehends the house of Flatts, Pelton village, and the great northern road ; whilst the back scene displays broken and irregular grounds, interspersed with cottages. To the left, cultivation brightens the prospect, and the winding stream of the Wear adds beauty to the picture, which, on one hand, presents the view of the town of Great Lumley, and, on the other, Walridge, with the Hermitage, and several hamlets in the vale. The distant landscape is terminated by Plawsworth, and the plantations above Newton Hall."], [261, "CHESTER-LE-STREET. 125 The inner court or area, 7*5 feet by 84, has received repairs and alterations at very different dates. On the gateway in the west centre are two small escutcheons, with two long lines of armo rial shields; and, on the flanking towers, two marble fountains, above which are tablets of black marble, on one of which is the family motto. There has been a private chapel somewhere in the castle, and which was licensed by Bishop Langley in 1432; but its scite is now unknown. There is a place in the park called Chapel Hill. The great hall measures 90 feet in length. It is ornamented with a gallery for minstrelsy, and exhibits a striking feature of ancient times, feudal performances, and old English manners.

King Richard II. giving Sir Ralph Lumley a patent of nobility, is also supposed to be an old, genuine picture. Four niches in the west wall contain marble busts of Henry VIII., Edward VI., Mary, and Elizabeth. Under Liulph's statue are fifteen couplets of Latin verses. In the Music-room are a full-length portrait of John Lord Lumley, in gilt armour, the right hand resting on a helmet, the left on a sword-hilt ; another full-length of the same, in baron's robes; Frederick Prince of Wales, in robes; and Sir Thomas Sanderson, in the robes ami collar of the Bath.

D. 126 The family of Lumley has well-authenticated claims to the highest and most splendid antiquity; Liulph, a noble Saxon, fled from the fierce Normans in the south of England, and found shelter in the more tranquil dominions of St. Cuthbert. Here he was dearly beloved by the people, not only in respect of his high parentage, but of his many eminent qualities ; whereby he grew into such familiarity and credit with Walcher, bishop of Durham, and Earl of Northumberland, that he would do nothing in temporal affairs without his advice. But he expiated with his life the dan o-erous popularity which his rank and virtues had acquired. Liulph married Algitha, daughter to Aldred, Earl of Northumberland, son of Uctred, Earl of Northumberland, by Elgyne, youngest daughter of King Etheldred. When Waltheof, Earl of Northumberland, granted to St. Cuthbert and his Prior Aldwin the church of Tynemouth, Liulph also led to the shrine of St. Oswin, and dedicated to the service of the church, his son Morkar. His eldest son, Uthred, obtained the rank of a Baron of the Palatine, under Bishop Hugh ; and his son William was the first who as sumed the local name of Lumley. Sir William, by Judith his wife, daughter to Hesilden of Hesilden, had issue another Sir Wil liam, who had two sons, William and Marmaduke. The latter was father of John Fitz-Marma* duke, Baron of Horden, in the bishopric of Durham, who, on February 12, 1300-1, 29 Edward l.j was among those barons that subscribed a memorable letter to Pope Boniface VIII.

William married the daughter and coheir of Walter de Audre, and by her was the father of Sir Roger de Lumley, Knight, who wedded Sybil, daughter and coheir of Hugh de Morwick, an an- cient baron in Northumberland. Robert, the fourth in descent from William Fitz-Uthred, added greatly to his paternal inheritance by marriage with the heiress of Thweng. Ralph, the grand- son, was created a parliamentary peer by summons in 1385, and continued to sit until he was at- tainted, and had his lands seized, for being concerned with Thomas de Holland, Earl of Kent, and other lords, who not assenting to the deposal of Richard II., joined in a confederacy against Henry IV., binding themselves by indenture sextipartite, to be diligent and faithful to each other in their undertaking, and were sworn to keep their design secret, and to attend carefully upon the execution of it. But appearing in arms, and the lords taking their lodgings in the town of Ciren- cester, whilst their forces encamped without tlie town, were overpowered by the inhabitants, and carried prisoners to the abbey, notwithstanding all means were used, by their servants and re- tainers, to further their escape. And our historians relate, that twenty-eight lords, knights, and gentlemen, the chief leaders of the rebellion, were brought from thence to Oxford, to the king, who immediately caused them to be executed there. But this Lord Lumley, who was standard bearer in that expedition, and styled a Banneret, died in the field of battle ; which is evident from the record, whereby all his lands and tenements, which he held in fee-simple from January 5th, 1 Henry IV., together with all his goods and chattels, were adjudged in parliament to be forfeited Lord Lumley married Eleanor, daughter of John Lord Nevil, who had an assignment in her widowhood of -P20 per annum. John, their second surviving son, 6 Henry IV., had livery of all the castles, manors, and lands, whereof Sir Ralph Lumley, his father, was seized at the time of his attainder ; and the honour of knighthood was conferred on him for his services in Scotland. He also served that monarch in his wars with the French, who, having experience of his fidelity, he was fully restored in blood (tainted by the conviction of Ralph, his father) by act of parliament in the 13th year of Henry IV. He also signabzed himself with Henry V. in his wars; and in the 10th year of the reign of that victorious monarch, lost his life in the field of battle, with Thomas, Duke of Clarence, the king's brother ; who being betrayed by Andrew Forgusa, a Lombard, his scout-master, that represented the numbers of the enemy to be inferior to what they were, preci- pitated himself into a battle at Baugy, in the province of Anjou, on Easter eve, April 13, 1421, and was there slain, together with this Sir John Lumley, Lord Lumley, the Earls of Tanquervile and Angus, and the Lord Ross, who disapproved of this rash design, yet made proof of their duty and their valour, not only in obeying their general in his Use time, but accompanying him in his death. Sir John Lumley appointed, by will, his brother Marmaduke his executor, and who was bishop of Carlisle and Treasurer of England. Sir Thomas Lumley, the next inheritor, was knighted for his services in the wars, and concerned in divers negociations. The king having experienced his fidelity, prudence, and conduct, he was constituted governor of Scarborough Castle for life, in the 33d year of his reign. It is likely that the sufferings of his family under the Lancastrians induced"], [264, "128 CHESTER WARD.\u2014 M. D him to take part with the house of York ; for when Edward IV. attained the crown, he petitioned the parliament for the reversion of the attainder of Ralph Lord Lumley, his grandfather ; which was accordingly repealed in the first year of the reign of that king, and he had summons to par liament among the barons of the realm till his death. He was at the siege of Bambrough Castle in the county of Northumberland, then held out (with some other garrisons in the north) by the Lancastrians; and on October 10, 1466, in 6 Edward IV., the king, in regard of his fidelity, cir cumspection, and industry, appointed him one of the commissioners to treat at Newcastle upon Tyne, with the deputies of the king of Scots, concerning certain grievances between the two na tions. Having married Margaret, daughter of Sir James Harrington (brother of Sir William Harrington, Lord Harrington, and Knight of the Garter in the reign of Henry V.), he had issue, by her, Sir George Lumley, his successor. George Lord Lumley was knighted before the 2d year of Edward IV., when he was sheriff of the county of Northumberland for that and the succeeding year; an office, in that age, of great power and trust. In the 6th year of Edward IV., this Sir George Lumley and Sir Robert Foi. bery were elected knights for the county of Northumberland, to the parliament summoned to meet at Westminster, and, in the return of the writ, are styled Milites gladiis ci?icti. In the 8th year of Edward IV., he was constituted sheriff of Northumberland, and was continued in that office four years successively. In 20 Edward IV., when bearing the title of Lord Lumley, he was a principal commander of those forces under the leading of Richard, Duke of Gloucester, the king's brother, which retook the town of Berwick (that had been surrendered to the Scots by Queen Margaret, to gain a sanctuary for her husband, Henry VI., when he was expelled England), and afterwards entering into Edinburgh, he was, for his valour and conduct in that expedition, made a knight banneret in Hooton Field, on August 22, the same year, with the Lord Fitzhugh, the Lord Scroop of Masham, and others. On the accession of Henry VII., he waited on his ma jesty in his progress, in the northern parts of the kingdom, in the first year of his reign. In the 13th year of Henry VII., he was in that expedition with the Earl of Surrey, against the Scots, who, with their king, were besieging Norham Castle, situated on the river Tweed, dividing Eng land from Scotland ; which siege they raised, and marching into Scotland, levelled several strong places, particularly Hayton Castle, one of the strongest fortresses between Berwick and Edinburgh, in sight of the Scots army. And on the espousals of the Princess Margaret, eldest daughter of Henry VII., with James IV., king of Scotland, which was solemnized at Richmond by Earl Both well, on St. Paul's day, 1502-3, 18 Henry VII., his lordship and his son met the queen at Darne ton (Darington) in Yorkshire, with several gentlemen in his retinue, and 80 horsemen in his livery, and waited on her majesty as far as Berwick, where she was received by Sir Thomas Darcy, the governor. His lordship married Elizabeth, daughter and heir of Roger Thornton, the wealthy merchant of Newcastle upon Tyne, by which the tower and manor of Ludworth, Bradbury with the Isle, Bolam, AxweU, SwalweU, and lands scattered broad and wide over Durham and North. umberland, were added to his ample inheritance. In a quarrel which arose concerning this succes sion, Lord Lumley slew Giles Thornton, his wife's bastard brother, in a duel in Windsor Castle ditch,* * It was, after all, the grand-daughter of the opulent Roger Thornton who carried her immense wealth into the family of Lumley ; for old Roger Thornton, who died in 1429, left a son and heir, Roger (who had married, in his father's life time, Elizabeth, daughter of Lord Greystock) ; and Elizabeth, the daughter of this younger Roger, was the heiress who married George Lord Lumley. From entries in the College cvf"], [265, "CHESTER-LE-STREET. 129 Thomas, son and heir of George Lord Lumley, married Elizabeth Plantagenet, base daughter of King Edward IV., and died in his father's life time. His eldest son, Richard, the next baron, left issue John Lord Lumlev, who, in 1513, on the invasion of this realm by James IV., king of Scotland, brought a considerable strength to the Earl of Surrey, who came to York with 500 men only (his sovereign lying before Tournay, with most of his nobles), and was one of the principal commanders of the van-guard of the army, which, on September 9, engaged in the battle of Flod den, where the king of Scotland was slain. Our historians relate, that the van-guard, wherein this Lord Lumley engaged, acquitted themselves with the greatest bravery ; encountering with the Earls of Crawford and Montrose, who had with them a great number of lords, knights, and gen tlemen, and were both slain. In the succeeding year, he was summoned to parliament as Lord Lumley, and, the year after, had livery of all the lands of his inheritance. In the year 1520, he was at the meeting between his sovereign and the Emperor Charles V. at Canterbury ; and crossing the seas, was, in June the same year, at that great interview ofthe kings of England and France, between Ardres and Guisnes. He was one of the chief of those northern lords who appeared in the insurrection called the Pil grimage of Grace ; but a pardon being offered by the Duke of Norfolk, at that time general of the king's forces sent to suppress them, he was chosen to treat with the duke at Doncaster, and so well did he accommodate matters, that the leaders, and all who had been either authors or partakers in the tumult, were permitted to repair to their own homes, without being questioned for their offence ; which, out of clemency, the king confirmed. Yet, soon after, he had the mortification of losing his only son, George Lumley, who being concerned in another insurrection with the Lord Darcy, Sir Thomas Percy (brother to the Earl of Northumberland), and others, was thereupon apprehended with them, committed to the Tower, and in June, 29 Henry VIII., was arraigned at Westminster before the Marquis of Exeter, high steward of England, and being found guilty of high treason, suffered death. John Lumley, on the death of his grandfather in 1544, succeeded by entail to tlie family estates. He was then an infant; and on a petition, 1 Edward VI., setting forth, \"That he was a person in lineage and blood corrupted, and deprived of all degree, estate, name, fame, &c. by reason of the attainder of George Lumley, his father,\" it was enacted, \" that the said John Lumley, and the heirs male of his body, should have, hold, enjoy, and bear the name, dignity, state, and pre-emi nence of a baron of this realm,\" &c. On September 29, 1553, two days before the coronation of Queen Mary, he was made one of the Knights of the Bath, in company with the Earl of Devon shire, the Earl of Surrey, the Lord Abergavenny, the Lord Berkeley, and ten others, being first knighted by the Earl of Arundel (his father-in-law), lord steward of the household, who had com mission from the queen to confer that honour. His lordship and his lady were at the coronation, he attending among the barons, and she being one of the six principal ladies, dressed in crimson velvet, that sat in the third chariot of state ; next to whom rode ten ladies in crimson velvet, their horses trapped with the same. On April 24, 1556, he and the Lord Talbot introduced Osep Napea, ambassador from the Emperor of Russia, to his audience of leave of the queen, who brought several rich presents from his master, and concluded a treaty of amity and commerce ; Arms, there seems some doubts of the asserted bastardy of Giles Thornton. The pedigree gives the younger Roger a second wife, and states their issue Sir Roger, -Giles, and John Thornton, the lineal ancestor of Thornton of Netherwitton. \u2014 Bourne, 95, note.

In the first year of Queen Elizabeth, his lordship was constituted one of the commissioners to receive the claims of all such as held of the queen in grand serjeanty, and were required to perform their respective services. He was employed to treat with Cosmo Medicis, Duke of Florence, about _f?ll,250, owing to her father, Henry VIII. ; and having received it with interest, the queen gave the said duke a discharge for it. After this, he suffered a short imprisonment for being privy, with his father-in-law, the Earl of Arundel, to the Duke of Norfolk's matrimonial intrigues with the Queen of Scots. In 1586, he was commissioned, with other lords, for the trial of the Queen of Scots; and, the next ensuing year, was in commission for the trial ofthe scape-goat, Secretary Davison, \"for con tempt towards the queen's majesty, breach of his allegiance, and neglect of his duty, in sending the warrant for putting the Queen of Scots to death, without her knowledge.\" He was also one of the peers that sat on the trial of Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex. And on the accession of James I., he was constituted one of the commissioners for settling the claims at his coronation ; as also a commissioner, with other lords, who were authorised to make Knights of the Bath. Camden gives this character of him, \" That he was a person of entire virtue, integrity, and innocence ; and in his old age, a complete pattern of true nobility. Had so great a veneration for the memory of his ancestors, that he caused monuments to be erected for them in the collegiate church of Chester-on the-Street (opposite to Lumley Castle), in order as they succeeded one another, from Liulphus down to his own time ; which he had either picked out of the demolished monasteries, or made new.\" He died April 11, 1609- \" Feeling as he did on the subject of ancestral honours, he must have foreseen with no small mortification the approaching extinction of the direct line of the family on his own decease.* Three children by his first princely consort, Jane Fitz-Allan, had died in infancy ; and his second wife, Elizabeth Darcy of Chiche, was childless. Under these circum stances, Lord Lumley seems to have three times changed the disposition of his estates.\" At last, he called to the succession his kinsman, Richard Lumley, ancestor of the Earl of Scarborough. This Richard Lumley was first knighted by King James at Theobald's, July 19, 1616, and was created Lord Viscount Lumley of Waterford, in Ireland, by letters patent, bearing date July 12, (1628) 4 Car. I. In the time of the rebellion, adhering to the king, he made his house of Lumley Castle a garrison, and being a principal commander of the forces under Prince Rupert, marched with him into the west of England, was at the siege of Bristol, and remained there at the time it was surrendered to the parliament's forces, September 10, 1645. He afterwards compounded for his estate for _P1955, 10s. He was also among those loyal peers who subscribed a memorable de claration, just before the meeting of the parliament that restored Charles II. He was buried in the vault at Cheam, with his kinsman, Lord Lumley, leaving Richard, his grandson, heir to his honour and his estate. Richard, first Earl of Scarborough, was well educated. In 1680, when an expedition was in tended against the Moors, and to raise the siege of Tangier, his lordship readily engaged in the dreaded and dangerous enterprise ; and on June 12, was actually embarked at Portsmouth to go on that service, under the Earl of Mulgrave (after Duke of Buckinghamshire), who was ap- * Mr. Pennant gives the following royal bon ton : \u2014 \" When King James I., in one of his progresses, was entertained in Lumley Castle, William James, bishop of Durham, a relation of the house, in order to give his majesty an idea of the importance of the family, wearied him with a long detail of their ancestry, to a period even beyond belief.

But the expedition being laid aside, his lordship returned to court, and soon after was constituted master of the horse to Queen Catherine, consort to Charles II. In that station he so far recommended himself, that his majesty, in consideration of his great merit and approved fidelity, and his descent from noble ancestors, ancient barons of this kingdom, ad- vanced him to the state and degree of Baron of Lumley Castle, in the county palatine of Durham, and to the heirs male of his body, and, for lack of such issue, to Henry Lumley,* his brother, and the heirs male of his body. On the insurrection raised by the Duke of Monmouth in the west, his lordship had a command of a regiment of horse, and had a principal share in gaining the victory at Sedgemore, July 6, 1685; and the Duke of Monmouth, with the German count who accompa- nied him, and the Lord Grey, were by his vigilancy discovered, and surrendered themselves pri- soners to his lordship. Nevertheless, when he observed King James's design was to assume arbi- trary power, he forsook the court, appeared on the behalf of the seven bishops at their trial, June 29, 1688, and was among those of the chief nobility who had the courage to consult with Mons. Dykvelt (whom the Prince of Orange intrusted to manage his affairs in England), and often met him at the Earl of Shrewsbury's, where they consulted how to proceed, and drew the declaration on which they advised his highness to engage. It also appears that he was principally intrusted by Admiral Russel, afterwards Earl of Orford, who went over to Holland, and had the prince's direction for the management of the grand affair of the revolution. When matters were concluded on, his lordship, with the Duke of Devonshire and the Earl of Danby, undertook for the north ; and retiring into their several counties, the Lord Lumley, by his interest and friends, secured Newcastle, which declared for the prince soon after his landing. He was afterwards no less instrumental, by his interest and arguments in the house of peers, in gaining the vote, that the throne was vacant, as also that the Prince and Princess of Orange should be declared king and queen of England ; for which services, on February 14, 1688-9, the day after their majesties were proclaimed, he was sworn of the privy-council, and declared one of the gentlemen of the king's bed-chamber ; also on April 10, 1690, before their coronation, he was advanced to the dignity of Viscount Lumley, of Lumley Castle ; and finally, on April 15, to the title of Earl of Scar borough ,- and was likewise constituted captain and colonel of the first troop of horse-guards. In 1690, he attended King William into Ireland, was at the battle of the Boyne, and afterwards waited on his majesty at the great congress of princes at the Hague, and came back with him to England. * Henry lies buried in a vault under the parish church at Sabridgeworth, in the county of Hertford, where there is a neat marble monument, with the following inscriptions : \u2014 \" Here lieth the Honourable Henry Lumley, Esq. only brother to Richard, Earl of Scarborough, who was in every battle, and at eveTy siege, as colonel, lieutenant-colonel, or general of the horse, with King William, or the Duke of Marlborough, in twenty campaigns in Ireland, Flanders, and Germany, where he was ho noured esteemed, and beloved by our own armies, by our allies, and even by the enemies, for his singular politeness and humanity, as well as for all his military virtues and capacity. \" He sat long in parliament, always zealous for the honour of the crown, and for the good of his country ; and knew no party but that of truth, justice, and honour. \" He died governor of the isle of Jersey, the 18th of October, 1722, in the sixty-third year of his age. \" Here also lieth Mrs. Frances Lumley, his only dear and beloved child, of great beauty, and greater hopes ; who died October 13th, 1719, the sixth of her age : sometime the joy, then the anguish of her fond parents. \" Here lieth also Dame Anne Lumley, daughter of Sir William Wiseman, of Canfield, Essex, who set up this monument 1723, in memory of the best of husbands, and her dear child, near whom she was deposited anno 1 736-7-\""], [268, "132 CHESTER WARD.\u2014 M. D. He waited on the king in his several campaigns in Flanders, till the conclusion of the peace of Ryswick, September 11, 1697, and was declared lieutenant-general of his forces. His lordship, in that reign, was likewise lord-lieutenant of the county palatine of Durham, county of Northumber land, and custos rotulorum of the same, as also lord-lieutenant and custos rotulorum of the town and county of Newcastle upon Tyne, and vice-admiral of the sea coasts of Durham and Northum berland, in which posts he was continued by Queen Anne, who, on June 24, 1702, appointed him lord-lieutenant of the counties of Durham and Northumberland. He was also sworn of her privy council, and constituted one of the commissioners to treat of an union between the two kingdoms. of England and Scotland ; and. pursuant to that act, was sworn of the privy council at Kensing ton, August 18, 1708. On the accession of King George I., his lordship was among those peers intrusted by his majesty with the government of these kingdoms till his arrival. On March 9, 1715-16, he was appointed chancellor of the duchy and county palatine of Lancaster, which he resigned in May, 1717 -5 an<l thereupon had the office of vice-treasurer, receiver-general, and paymaster-general of all his ma jesty's revenues in the kingdom of Ireland, with the power to act by sufficient deputies. And his lordship, having no intention to go over, procured an act of parliament, which passed the royal assent July 6, 1717, to enable him to take in Great Britain the usual oath to qualify himself for the said office. He departed this life on December 17, 1721, and was buried with his ancestors in the church of Chester-le-Street. By his wife, Frances, only daughter and heir of Sir Henry Jones of Aston, he had issue seven sons and four daughters. Richard, his second son,* and second Earl of Scarborough, was elected one of the members for East Grinsted to the parliament called in the 7th year of Queen Anne, and for the borough of Arundel in two other parliaments, whereof the last was sitting on the demise of the queen. On the accession of her successor to the throne, he was appointed (September 21, 1714) one of the gentlemen of the bed-chamber to his royal highness the Prince of Wales, and presently after was constituted master of the horse, and was also captain and colonel of the first troop of grenadier guards. On March 10, 1714-15, he was called by writ to the house of peers, and took his place according to his father's patent of creation, whom he succeeded in the year 17-21, as well in his honours, as lord-lieutenant and custos rotulorum of the county of Northumberland, and lord lieutenant and custos rotulorum of the town and county of Newcastle upon Tyne. On May 2, 1721, he stood proxy for Ernest Augustus, Duke of York, at the baptism of the Duke of Cum berland ; and, shortly after, his lordship was constituted colonel of the second regiment of foot guards, and was elected one of the knights companions of the most noble order of the Garter. On the accession of George II. to the throne, he was, on June 15, 1727, constituted master of the horse to his majesty, and sworn one of the privy council ; also lord-lieutenant and custos rotulorum for the county of Northumberland, and vice-admiral of the county of Durham. In l733-4, he re signed his post of master of the horse ; and departing this life January 29, at his house in Grosve-. nor Square, was interred in St. George's chapel, in Audley Street, February 4, 1739-40. He was the friend pf Lord Chesterfield, who has drawn his amiable character, con amove, and his unhappy exit with pathos : * Henry Lord Viscount Lumley, the eldest son, died in 1710. He was a very little man. Pope, in a letter of 1710, says, \"Since the \"deaths of Lord Lumley and Mr. Lytton, I am one of the least men ia England.\""], [269, "CHESTER-LE-STREET. 133 \" When I confess there is, who feels for fame, And melts to goodness, Scarborough need I name ?\" \" He had not,\" says Lord Chesterfield, \" the least pride of birth and rank ; that common narrow notion of little minds, that wretched mistaken succadaneum of merit ; but he was jealous to anxiety of his character, as all men are who deserve a good one.\" Dying unmarried, his titles and estate descended to his next brother and heir, Thomas Lumley Saunderson, third Earl of Scarborough, who was appointed, November 28, 1721, his majesty's envoy-extraordinary and plenipotentiary to the king of Portugal; where he demeaned himself with such honour and integrity, as won him the regard of that monarch, and the love and esteem of all classes. On returning from his embassy, he was made a knight of the Bath ; and, in 1722, was elected to parliament for the borough of Arundel in Sussex, and returned one of the knights for Lincolnshire in the parliament summoned to meet at Westminster, November 28, 1728, also for the said county in the next parliament, summoned to meet June 13, 1731. Enjoy ing the estate of James Saunderson, Earl of Castleton (who died without issue May 24, 1723), he, by act of parliament, took the surname of Saunderson, in pursuance of the will of the said earl. His lordship died March 15, 1752. He married Lady Frances, second daughter of the Earl of Orkney, and left an only son, Richard, fourth Earl of Scarborough, who was appointed cofferer of his majesty's household; and on July 12, 1765, was sworn of his majesty's most honourable privy council. His lordship was also deputy earl-marshal of England to his grace Edward, late Duke of Norfolk, and colonel of the northern battalion of the Lincolnshire militia. He married, December 12, 1752, Barbara, sister and heir to Sir George Savile, of Rufford in Nottinghamshire, Bart., and by her had issue five sons. His lordship died May 12, 1782, and was succeeded by his eldest son, George Augustus, fifth earl, who was born September 22, 1753. In 1774, he was chosen mem ber of parliament for Lincolnshire; and dying unmarried, September 5, I8O7, was succeeded by his next brother, Richard, present and sixth earl, who was born April 16, 1757, and previous to his accession to the title, bore the name of Savile, in right of his uncle, whose estates he enjoyed while a younger brother. He had for some time a commission in a regiment of dragoons in early life. His lord ship married, May 25, 1787, Harriet Willoughby, sister to Henry Lord Middleton, but has no issue. The gallant Fitzalan, Earl of Arundel, acknowledged that his son-in-law, Lord Lumley, had \" sold and mortgaged most part of his own lands, tenements, hereditaments, and patrimony, for the discharge and payment of his (the earl's) debts and causes,\" These great sacrifices were not replaced by the Sussex estates and a share of Arundel borough, derived from that connection ; and \" the wreck of the family possessions in the north have not been sufficient to induce the latter Earls of Scarborough to quit the Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire estates, derived from the heiresses of Saunderson and Savile.\" The first Earl of Scarborough was the last that had much immediate connection with the north.

This township lies nearly a mile and a half to the south of Lumley Castle. At an early period* the vill of Great Lumley became the estate of a younger branch of the Lumley family ; but while the parent stock, by marriages, rose rapidly into wealth and power, the estate of their cadets seems to have become divided amongst females. In the reign of Queen Elizabeth, Thomas Knevitt, Esq. alienated his moiety of Great Lumley in parcels to his tenants ; and the Musgraves after- wards alienated their share, so that a variety of freehold estates have arisen in Great Lumley. The East Hall, said to be the ancient seat of the Lumleys before the castle was built, is now in ruins. The West Hall belonged to the Aytons of West Harrington, and is now, by purchase, the property of Lord Durham. Lumley Thicks is an old house, repaired and enlarged a few years ago, and which commands a view of Lamesley vale. This house is formerly said to have been a chapel. Surtees thinks that either this, or an adjoining farm-house, named Woodstone House, is the ancient Wodesend, men tioned in charters at the commencement of the fourteenth century, relating to the younger branch of the Lumleys. This township contains several farms, eight public houses, two schools, and two chapels, one belonging to the Old Methodist Connexion, and the other to the New. In the George-pit, near Lumley village, an explosion of inflammable gas took place on October 9, 1819, by which thirteen men and boys were killed, and many others were severely hurt. Duck's Hospital, at Lumley, has been already described. This township is entitled to a share ofthe rents of the Longstock estate, from which was received, in 1827, \u00a352, 10s. ; in 1828, \u00a350, 12s. ; and in 1829, \u00a350, 16s. These payments are generally received in March, and are not distributed till the Christmas following. The amount is then given away at a public meeting, amongst poor persons resident in the township, and chiefly those not receiving parochial relief.

After some time, Harraton was in possession of the family of Darcy, and then, by marriage and exchange or purchase, was vested in the Hedworths, who held, at their highest pitch of elevation, besides Harraton, the manor of Southwick, the grange of Saltwellside, Urpeth, Ricleden ; lands in Cleadon, Whitburn, Scots House, Jarrow, Hedworth, and Sunderland, and, in Moorhouse and Picktree, part of West Her rington, Burnigall, and lands in Woodham, Brafferton, and Bursblades. Sir John Hedworth lived on the eve of the civil wars, and, being a man of indolent temper and weak intellect, sold his estates and leased his mines for very trifling considerations ; and, in a time \"of deep speculation, intrigue, and adventure, the broad lands and deep mines of Harraton be came an obvious prize.\" At length, the old knight was driven from the house of his ancestors, and subsisted on the charity of his neighbours.

The collieries of Harraton had been leased, for a mere acknowledgment, to Sir William Wray of Beamish, who being a Papist and recusant convict, the colliery was sequestered in 1644, when it was valued at i?3000 per annum, perhaps owing to the Tyne being shut against the rebel city of London. In 1647, it was leased, under the state, to George Grey of Southwick, and George Lilburn, \" who also made title under a lease of Sir John Hedworth's to Robert Conyers, transferred by Conyers to Josiah Primate,* and by him to Grey and Lilburne.\" Young Hed- worth, who had married the daughter of George Grey, seemed likely by this connection to regain the possession of some of his own property ; but, in 1649, the thieves quarrelled about the division of the plunder, and Sir Arthur Haslerigg, who was then governor of Newcastle and lord of the ascendant, swooped upon Harraton (under the state's title, on Wray's delinquency), turned out the Lilburns, and let both land and colliery to Colonel Hacker, Colonel Mayers, and Major Tol- hurst ; and Colonel John Jackson, a very rising character of the day, who first served in the royal army, afterwards acquired the confidence of Sir Arthur Haslerigg, some time after married the widow of Mr. Hedworth, became lessee of Harraton under the Protector, was knighted on the Restoration for his loyalty, secured Ladv Hedworth's gowns and petticoats for his own daughters, secured also his own sisters' fortunes for his own use, and transmitted a large slice of the Harraton estate, Chatersheugh, to his descendants. Mr. Hedworth, who was all this time excluded from his estate, \"forced to hire his own ground of those who occupied it, to put in some cowes to give a little milke to feed his poor young babes,\" vented his feelings in \" The oppressed Man's Outcry, an Epistle writ by John Headworth, of Harraton, in the County of Durham, Esquire, the 11th of September, 1651, unto the Honourable Sir Henry Vane the elder, a Member of the Honourable Parliament of the Commonwealth of England, William Vane his Sonne, Lieutenant Colonell Paul Hobson, John Middleton, Esquires, and Members of the Committee of the Militia, in the County of Durham, by Authority of Parliament.\" In this epistle, he states at some length that \" he is the son and heire of a deceased knight, Sir John Hedworth, who was lord, owner, or proprietor of the lands of Harraton, in the county of Durham, and all the cole mynes thereof, and left them unto me by an unblemished ancient entayle, as strong as the law of England (his undoubted birth- right) could make any, as his eldest sonne and heire ; and being by his decease left young, and destitute of the support of powerful friends and allies, and thereby fit to become a prey to every devouring wolfe \u2014 and it was my unhappy fate to live in thelige when Sir Arthur Haslerigge be- came governor of Newcastle, a man of high and covetous spirit, the whole county of Durham being too little in revenue to content his greedy appetite, a man that will admit of no rule to walk by but his own crooked and perverse will of the sword.\" Mr. Hedworth died in 1655 ; and Colonel Jackson married his widow, and got possession of two parts of Harraton, by lease under Cromwell ; while the remaining third was the dower of Dame * Josiah Primate was heard by council in support of his claims, by six of the commissioners for compound ing for delinquent's estates, but who decided against him.

However, the last John Hedworth (left a minor in 1655, and died in 1688) in some measure re paired his shattered fortunes by marriage with the coheir of James, of Washington. By this lady he left two daughters and coheirs, of whom the elder, Dorothy, intermarried with Ralph Lambton, of Lambton, Esq., and the younger was wife to Sir William Williamson, Bart. The whole estate of Harraton, in 1714, was re-united in Lambton by purchase of Williamson's moiety. The tenure of the manor is uniformly stated at the service of one knight's fee. This populous township contains the hamlets of Chater's Haugh, Fatfield, Nova Scotia, High. Haugh, Picktree, and Houghton Gate. Clementson's Row at the Black Fell, and Vigo, are also places inhabited by persons engaged in the coal works. Twelve public houses, and a proportionate number of grocers, drapers, butchers, joiners, and blacksmiths, are scattered over this township. Pelaw is one mile to the north of Chester. Its earliest owners on record assumed the local. name. John de Pelawe sold this manor, in 1381, to the Elmeden family, and by whom it was possessed until 1557, after which it passed by marriage to Sir Bertram Bulmer. Sir Bertram, in 1602, sold Pelaw, in four equal portions, to Robert Puncheon and Richard Maddison of Pelaw, Richard Sampson of Urpeth, and John Cook of Pelton. In 1727, the estate was vested in Francis Carr, Esq., and passed under his device to the Carrs and Milbankes. It is now, by purchase, the property of Lord Durham. St. Stephen's Chapel and Hospital, in Pelaw, was re-absorbed long ago in the landed estate. The house and gardens of Henry Stobbart, Esq., a colliery viewer, and those of John Cookson, Esq., still impart an air of respectability to this place. Ricleden Grange,. in 1421, was in possession of the Lumley family, from whom it passed to the Hedworths; but, about 1629, the estate become, by purchase, the property of the Marleys of Picktree. Picktree* is a hamlet, one mile and a half north-by-west from Chester. The Lambtons and Hed worths long held property in Picktree; but, in 1679, Joseph Carr, Esq., and Ralph Marley of Picktree, Gent., were jointly seized of the whole township and manor. Carr's moiety, under an entail, passed to the late Sir Ralph Milbank, Bart., who sold it to Lord Durham. The other portion also reverted to the family of Lambton, by purchase from different heirs of Marley. Aroi'\u00ab Scotia, a short distance from this place, is entirely inhabited by colliers. * The Barley Mow public house here was once kept by the noted Ailcie Marley, a witty and pretty cour tezan, and the subject of a favourite popular song. Ailcie being one day, it is said, out on some little busi ness about the premises, perceived that her pocket was lost, on which she hurried into the house, where some company was drinking, exclaiming that she had lost her pocket and money ; when her husband, as if inspired, roared forth \u2014 \" O d'ye ken Ailcie Marlev, honey ; The wife that sells the barley, honey ?

On August 5, 1768, under the paroxysm of a fever, she wandered into the fields, and, falling into an old coal-pit, was drowned. A writer in Mitchell's Newcastle Magazine, who is mistaken in relating the time of her death, saw her about this time, and describes her as a tall, slender, genteel-looking woman, of about 50 years of age. Sir Walter Scott has, by a singular anachronism, introduced this character in \" The For tunes of Nigel,\" the scene of which is laid in the reign of King James I."], [273, "CHESTER-LE-STREET. 137 Fatfield, a bustling village on the north bank of the Wear, three miles north-east of Chester, where the Sunderland keels take in their lading at the staiths. Here are also a corn-mill, an iron foundery, and a manufactory of coal-tar, lamp-black, and coke. On September 28, 1813, an ex plosion took place in the Hall-pit near this place, when upwards of thirty men and boys were killed. Chafer's Haugh is a village adjoining Fatfield, where coal-keels are also loaded. There is a small Methodist chapel at this place. It formerly belonged to the Hedworth family, but is now the property of the Peareths, from an intermarriage with the Jacksons of Harraton. The foul air in the pit here exploded on the 11th of August, 1756, and four men were killed. Also, at Harra ton colliery, on June 30, 1817, the carburetted hydrogen gas ignited, when thirty-eight men and boys lost their lives, The explosion was dreadfully violent : corves, trams, and two bodies of the workmen, were blown into the air from the bottom of the pit, which is 492 feet in depth ! The accident originated in the perverse obstinacy of a hewer, who persisted in working with a lighted candle instead of a safety lamp. Shortly after, eight men, who went down the Nova Scotia pit to repair some injuries sustained by the explosion in the Row-pit, were also killed by the choak-damp, which had found its way into the workings of this pit Lambton Castle. This splendid building occupies the scite of Harraton Hall (anciently the seat of the D'Arcys). It is delightfully seated upon a gentle elevation on the north bank of the Wear, about two miles east-north-east of Chester. The river here divides the Park into nearly two equal portions, and sweeps swiftly round tlie castle, forming several fine reaches, and flowing through deep, overhang ing banks, thickly tufted with wood. The river-valley is extremely beautiful, and the ride through the picturesque wood on the southern bank is most delightful. The bridge over the Wear, near the castle, was erected in 1819, from an elegant design by Bonomi, and consists of a single arch, of which the span is 82 feet 6 inches. The park, which contains nearly 1200 acres, has three handsome lodges at the respective entrances. From 1821 to 1825, excellent horse-races were held in these beautiful grounds annually in October, and which interested all the sportsmen of England. The gardens display the triumph of art over the uncongenial accidents of nature. The ground selected for this purpose lies on the margin of the Wear, and was recently a complete bog. It is now in a high state of cultivation, under the able management of Mr. Rule. The whole comprises nine acres, besides five acres more on the opposite side of the river, which is used as a nursery. The vinery is 323 feet in length; and the forcing pit is 112 feet lono-, 12 feet deep, and 4 feet in breadth. The castle itself is a modern building, erected by the elder Bonomi. \" It displays,\" says Hodg son, \"considerable incongruities, both in design and execution ;\" but, during the last ten years, it has been greatly enlarged, improved, and castellated ; in consequence of which, the appellation Hall has been converted into that of Castle. The antique style has been carefully preserved, and the turrets are highly ornamental. Some idea of the internal extent of this structure may be formed from the circumstance of its having one hundred and fourteen chimneys, which, however, are ju diciously masked. A gasometer and other apparatus for producing pure gas are placed in a plan tation near the castle, from which its numerous passages, galleries, halls, and apartments, are occasionally most brilliantly illuminated. The purest taste is displayed in every room, from the most appropriate simplicity to the most unrivalled magnificence. vol. i. 2 N"], [274, "CHESTER WARD.\u2014 M.

The Lambtons, with the exception of Lumley, Earl of Scarborough, are the only family in the county who still retain the seat from whence they derive their local name. The tenure of the estate is uniformly stated at half a knight's fee. The popular romance of the Worm of Lambton belongs to that class of household tales, attached to ancient families long occupying the same ground and station. This legend is well related by Surtees. \" The heir of Lambton, fishing, as was his profane custom, in the Wear on a Sunday, hooked a small worm or eft, which he carelessly threw into a well, and thought no more of the adventure. The worm (at first neglected) grew till it was too large for its first habitation, and issuing forth from the Worm WeU, betook itself to the Wear, where it usually lay a part of the day coiled round a crac in the middle of the water; it also frequented a green mound near the well (the Worm Hill), where it lapped itself nine times round, leaving vermicular traces, of which, grave living witnesses depose that they have seen the vestiges. It now became the terror of the country, and, amongst other enormities, levied a daily contribution of nine cows1 milk, which was always placed for it at the green hill, and in default of which it devoured man and beast. Young Lamb ton had, it seems, meanwhile, totally repented him of his former life and conversation, had bathed himself in a bath of holy water, taken the sign of the cross, and joined the Crusaders. On his return home, he was extremely shocked at witnessing the effects of his youthful imprudences, and immediately undertook the adventure. After several fierce combats, in which the Crusader was foiled by his enemy's power of self-union, he found it expedient to add policy to courage, and not perhaps possessing much of the former quality, he went to consult a witch or wise woman. By her judicious advice, he armed himself in a coat of mail studded with razor blades, and, thus pre pared, placed himself on the crag in the river, and awaited the monster's arrival. At the usual time, the Worm came to the rock, and wound himself with great fury round the armed knight, who had the satisfaction to see his enemy cut in pieces by his own efforts, whilst the stream wash ing away the several parts prevented the possibility of re-union. There is still a sequel to the story : the witch had promised Lambton success only on one condition, that he should slay the * Lord Durham, who is a munificent patron of the arts, has many other valuable paintings in his house in London, and at Wimbleton, amongst which is the portrait of his son, by the late Sir Thomas Lawrence, and which has been so generally and justly admired."], [275, "CHESTER-LE-STREET. 139 first living thing which met his sight after the victory. To avoid the possibility of human slaugh ter, Lambton had directed his father that, as soon as he heard him sound three blasts on his bugle in token of the achievement performed, he should release his favourite greyhound, which would immediately fly to the sound of the horn, and was destined to be the sacrifice. On hearing his son's bugle, however, the old chief was so overjoyed, that he forgot the injunctions, and ran him self with open arms to meet his son. Instead of committing a parricide, the conqueror again re paired to his adviser, who pronounced, as the alternative of disobeying the original instructions, that no chief of the Lambtons should die in his bed for seven (or, as some accounts say, for nine) generations; a commutation which to a martial spirit had nothing probably very terrible, and which was willingly complied with. \" The story, such as it is, full of plot and incident, certainly ranks amongst the most popular traditions of this country, and has been transmitted with very little variation for centuries from father to son ; and various facts have been pressed into the service to establish the commination of sudden death that has been supposed to hang over the family. The date of the story is, of course, uncertain ; but nine ascending generations from tlie late General Lambton (in whom popular tra dition affirmed the curse to expire) would exactly reach to Sir John Lambton, Knight of Rhodes, of whom this curious entry stands in an old MS. pedigree, lately in possession of the family of Middleton, of Offerton : \u2014 ' Johan Lambeton that slewe ye Worme was Knight of Rhoodes and Lord of Lambeton and Wod Apilton ester the dethe of sower brothers sans esshewe masle. His son Robert Lampton was drowned at Newebrigg.' That the knight ever succeeded to the family estates, however, contradicts the proven pedigree.\" Sometimes such tales relate \" to the founder of the family, the true story of whose establishment being long forgotten, tradition has thrown a misty halo round his brows. Like the preux cheva lier of romance, the homo propositus of the name goes forth to slay wolf, bear, or wivern ; and if, on his return, he does not marry the king's daughter, he at least receives broad lands and livings as his guerdon. To this class belong the Worm of Sockburn, the Brawn of Pollard's Dene, (both which have faulchion evidence,) the Boar of Kentmere, and that other Brawn of Brancepath, whom Roger de Fery slew treacherously in a pit-fall at Cleves Cross. But the Lambtons were a family of good and valorous repute long before the date of their family legend (which only ascends to the fourteenth century) ; and it does not appear that the hero of the tale reaped any thing from his adventure, except the honour of the achievement, and a very singular curse on his descendants to the ninth generation. \"As to the matter of fact contained in these legends, it is impossible to deny that when a great part of England lay in moor, morass, and forest, wolves and boars may have been much more troublesome neighbours than any thing of which we have a conception. As to wolves, they were by no means exterminated by King Edgar. The monks of Fors, in Wensleydale, about 1180, had a dangerous grant from Alan Earl of Richmond, of the flesh -of all wild animals torn by wolves within their own dale. King James the First and Sixth, sometimes took the diversion of wolf-hunting in Scotland, in which kingdom the last wild wolf was killed as late as 1682; and in Ireland, proclamations were issued against wolves in Antrim, in the reign of Anne. It is confessed that it is much more difficult to account for serpents of a magnitude to require the intervention of a hero; and flying dragons are still worse: the possible allegorical meaning is too obvious to be detailed. The subject matter of the exploit may be equally a Danish Rover, a domestic Tyrant, or, as in the well-known case of the Dragon of Wantley, a villanous, overgrown Lawyer, endowed"], [276, "CHESTER WARD.\u2014 M. D. 140 with all the venom, maw, and speed of a flying eft, whom the gallant Moor of Moor Hall ' slew with nothing at all' but the aid of a good conscience, and a fair young maid of sixteen, to ' 'noint him o'er night when he went to fight, and to dress him in the morning.' \" Popular tradition assigns the chapel of Brigford as the spot where Lambton offered up his vows before and after the adventure (this foundation, however, it has been shewn, existed at a period antecedent to the er.riicst date assigned to the legend). In the garden-house at Lambton are two figures of no great antiquity. A knight in good style armed cap-a-pee, the back studded with raxor blades, who holds the Worm by one ear with his left hand, and with his right crams his sword to the hilt down his throat ; and a lady, who wears a coronet, with bare breasts, &c. in the style of Charles II.'s Beauties, a wound on whose bosom, and an accidental mutilation of the hand, are said to have been the work of the Worm. A real good Andrea Ferrara, inscribed on the blade 1521, notwithstanding the date, has been also pressed into the service, and is said to be the identical weapon by which the Worm perished.\"* John de Lamtun was witness to the charter of Uchtred de Wodeshend, between 1180 and 1200..

From a state of confusion,\" he observes, in a letter in the Newcastle Chronicle, \" I have every thing to lose, and nothing to gain ; and I must hope that neither my head is so weak, nor my heart so wicked, as to seek the misery of others at so great a personal risk. All I wish is, to see this happy constitution reformed upon its own principles, and that every reparation may be made in the style of the building.\" On these principles, he opposed the war against France, the Treason and Sedition Bills in 1795, and the continuance of the Slave Trade. In the autumn of that year, he betrayed symptoms of con sumption ; and, early in the following year, he and his family embarked for Naples in a neutral vessel. From this city he travelled northwards, and reached Pisa on the 30th of November. Four days after, this great and good man expired, in the thirty-third year of his age. He left issue, 1. John-George Lambton, of Lambton, Esq. 2. William-Henry Lambton, born 27th March, 1793; married, 28th January, 1824, Henrietta, second daughter of Cuthbert Ellison, of Hebburn, Esq. 3. Henry- William Lambton, born 3d August, 1795 ; died at Geneva 23d November, 1825. 4. Hedworth Lambton, born near Naples 26th March, 1797 ! an officer in the Guards. Also a daughter, Frances-Susan, born 6th September, 1794; married to the Hon. Frederick Howard, third son of Frederick Earl of Carlisle, a major in the army, killed at Waterloo 18th June, 1815; remarried, 16th June, 1819, to Henry-Frederick Compton Cavendish, Esq., major in the 9th Dragoons (lancers). John-George Lambton was born 12th April, 1792, and became representative in parliament for the county of Durham in 1818, for which county he continued to sit until 17th January, 1828, when he was called to the Upper House, by the title of Baron Durham, of the City of Durham, and of Lambton Castle in the County of Durham. As the title had never before been appropriated to any private family, it excited much remark in certain quarters. \" The bishop of Durham,\" it was said, \"has always been the Count Palatine, and, sharing more of the character of a temporal peer than any other bishop, has never been jostled by a secular earl.\" On the 22d November, 1830, his lordship was made Lord Privy Seal. Lord Durham married, first, Henrietta Cholmondely, in January, 1812, by whom (who died in 1815, and was buried at Beckenham, Kent) he had issue, 1. Frances-Charlotte, born 14th October, 1812; 2. Georgiana-Sarah-EUzabeth, born 2d March, 1814; 3. Harriet-Caroline, born 30th May,"], [279, "CHESTER-LE-STREET. 143 1815. His lordship, on December 9, 1816, married, secondly, at Howick Hall, Louisa-Elizabeth, daughter of Charles Earl Grey, born 7th April, 1797, and by whom he has issue, 1 . The Hon. Charles- William, born at Lambton Hall, 16th January, 1818; 2. Mary-Louisa, born 8th May, 1819; 3. Emily-Augusta, born 17th May, 1823; and another daughter, recently born. This is not the proper time for expatiating on the character and conduct of Lord Durham ; but this much may be said, that in spirit and boldness, liberality of sentiment, masculine eloquence, and princely mu nificence, he is the worthy son of an excellent and an admired father. Bridgeford Chapel, mentioned in the traditionary tale of tlie Lambton Worm, stood near the New Bridge on the left of the road immediately within the entrance of Lambton Park. The east window has some slight remains of tracery ; and Hutchinson noticed the figure \" of a man to the waist, in relief, with elevated hands,\" closed up in the wall of the house. The endowment of this chapel is totally lost. Thomalin, the priest of Lambton, presented two pounds of wax to St. Cuthbert, probably before 1200 ; and a regular presentation of John de Pamplesworth, by Robert Lord of Lambton, to the chapel of Brugeford, appears in the Register of Bishop Kellaw, 19th August, 1314. This chapel, it is supposed, was, like other chantries, disused in the reign of Henry VIII. High Haugh is a small hamlet in Harraton township, situated on the banks of the Wear below Lambton Castle. On the 23d November, 177^-> the ferry-boat at this place upset, and eight pas sengers were drowned. Lambton, which lies on the banks of the river opposite to the castle, and includes a considerable part of the extensive park belonging to the castle, is sometimes called Old Lambton, to distinguish it from New Lambton, in the parish of Houghton. Lambton House, a short distance from the castle, was, during many centuries, the family seat.* According to an old view, it was a double house, with flanking gavel-ended wings, and the grounds laid out in parterres and terraces. It was dismantled in 1797, but is now converted into a respectable and substantial house, and is occupied by Henry Morton, Esq., his lordship's land-steward. Houghton-Gate is a small hamlet in this township. A large and powerful pumping steam-engine stands nearly opposite to the gar dens ; but the engine-house is castellated, and made as ornamental as possible. On August 22, 1706, a melancholy accident happened at Lambton colliery, some distance from this place. Six masons and labourers, being employed below, desired the lamp to be lowered down to rarify the air, when the latter in an instant took fire with a terrible explosion, destroying men, horses, and machinery, and sweeping away in its fury every thing moveable. The explosion was heard at a great dis tance, and was followed by a flash like lightning. The men below were forced up the shaft like balls out of the mouth of a cannon ; and many acres were covered with mutilated limbs, timber, coals, &c. Birtley is an ancient manor and village three miles north of Chester-le-Street. Previous to Hatfield's Survey, a family had assumed the local name ; but, in 1366, the estate came to two co heiresses. The eldest sold her share to Ralph Lord Nevil ; and this moiety was included in the * The Lambton family seem to have possessed some property in Northumberland, as Robert Lambton of Lambton was sheriff of that county in 1427- About this time, the Lambtons also held the manors of South Salcock and Wood Appleton in Yorkshire."], [280, "144 CHESTER WARD.\u2014 M. D. forfeiture ofthe Earl of Westmoreland in 1570, and was granted to Robert Catcheside and Wil liam Carr. The younger coheir married Gilbert Eglyn ; and, in the third descent, part of the ma nor became vested in the Blenkinsops. Other parts were settled on the Maddisons and the Halls. The village is chiefly inhabited by colliers, and contains five public houses and a Catholic cha pel. The Methodists have also a meeting-room. White-Cake Row and Brown's Buildings, ad joining the turnpike road, afford accommodation to the numerous workmen employed in the iron works. These works, which are carried on within an inclosure of about two acres, are the pro perty of Messrs. Perkins, Thompson, and Co. The iron-stone is mostly procured from the neigh bouring collieries, and is usually brought here by the waggons which convey coals to Pelaw Main staith, or by those which are sent to various collieries with iron castings. The coals used are brought from the King-pit, near Wreckington ; and the coke used is made on the premises. About forty tons of iron are produced here every week. The sides of both the blast furnaces, and the lining of the cones, consist of fire-bricks, which are found more lasting and less expensive than fire-stone. The Birtley Salt Works belonged to Sir William Lambton, and, as appears by a petition to parliament, were totally destroyed by the Scots army during the civil wars. The present salt spring was discovered about forty years ago, in making a colliery drift at the depth of 140 yards. From the place where it issues it is conveyed about 250 yards to the bottom of the pit, from whence it is pumped by a steam-engine. The quantity of water never varies ; and when the salt trade was brisk, about 1000 tons of salt was made yearly, on which a duty of _C30,000 was paid. This manufactory is at present carried on by Mr. John Walton. Birtley Hall, which stands pleasantly on a rising ground, is occupied by Benjamin Thompson, Esq. ; and Birtley White-House is the property and residence of Mr. Thomas Humble. Porto Bello is a hamlet in this township. Leyburn Hold, north of Birtley, where the new and old Dur ham roads meet, was in former days covered with wood, under shelter of which robbers, it is said, lay in wait for the defenceless traveller. Pelton is a straggling village on a high ground about two miles to the north-west of Chester-le- Street, and contains three public houses and a few mechanics. There are five or six farms in the township. In 1320, Hugh Burden held land in Pelton of John de Haddam, the superior lord. It afterwards passed to the Redhughs, and then to Robert de Whelpington, who conveyed Pelton to the Nevil family, and it was forfeited with their other possessions. In 1684, it was divided into twelve freeholds. Ouston, a hamlet and township three miles north-north-west of Chester, contains several exten sive collieries, belonging to Messrs. Perkins, Thompson, and Co. On February 21, 1823, four men were killed and two severely burnt by an explosion of inflammable air in a pit at this place. In 1284, Bishop Farnham gave Ouston (Ulkiston) to St. Edmund's Hospital in Gateshead. After the dissolution, Ouston became the property of the Andersons, and subsequently of the Hed worths, from whom it passed to their coheirs, Joliff'e and Milbank. Urpeth, a small village on the south of the Team, three miles to the north-west of Chester. By the Boldon Book, it appears to have had dringage tenure, wherein, among other duties, we find that of feeding dog and horse, and finding fifteen cords of provender, and two greyhounds for"], [281, "CHESTER-LE-STREET. 145 the great chase, carrying a tun of wine, the millstones for Durham mill, attending the court, going on embassies, and making repairs at Chester mill. The first person noted in the records as pos sessing this manor is Thomas de Urpeth, who held the same of tlie lord bishop in capite, except five lands of husbandry, and an assart there called the Rydding, which Alexander de Kibbles worth, who married his daughter Idoma, then had ; Thomas doing homage and fealty, rendering sixty shillings yearly at the bishop's exchequer, ploughing and harrowing eight acres of the lord's land at Chester, having provisions found by the bishop during such work, preparing three balks of land for seed corn in autumn, with twenty-four men each, and one with twelve, the bishop pro viding them, for every tjiree men a loaf of bread, of the assize of eight to the bushel, a flagon of beer, and a portion of cheese of half a stone weight ; besides the dringage service as stipulated in the Boldon Book. In Bishop Hatfield's Survey, it appears that Sir Thomas Grey, of Heton, then held the manor. It was part of the forfeiture on the attainder of Sir Thomas Grey, Knt., of Northumberland, who was attainted and executed at Southampton in 1415; but it was restored by Bishop Nevil to Sir Ralph Grey, Knt., in 1454. It soon after became the property of the Hedworths, who alienated it to the Lambtons; and, in 1640, the manor became the property of Robert Bewick, Esq., mayor of Newcastle, whose descendants still hold the estate. Urpeth Lodge is the residence of Mrs. Margaret Bewick, widow of Calverly Bewick, Esq., M. P. Urpeth Moor, containing 136 acres, was divided by agreement in 1796. The bishop of Dur ham had 6d. per acre reserved rent on the allotments, and the mines were reserved. At Ui-peth is a mill for manufacturing paper, and a corn mill ; also an iron forge, which belongs to tlie Lum ley Forge Company. Pit-Hill is a hamlet that contains two farmsteads and two public houses, but is chiefly occupied by the viewer, agent, overmen, and mechanics attached to the adjoining pits. Pokerley anciently gave name to a resident family. Walter, Lord of Urpeth, granted, by charter, a third part of the vill to Daniel de Pokerely. The Monbouchers, Lords of Beamish, held considera ble interest in Pokerley. In 1380, Bartram Monboucher held the manor, lands, and services of the free tenants, by one clove gilliflower, due on St. Cuthbert's day in September, of the heirs of the old Lords of Urpeth. The local name was, however, not extinguished till a later date. The chief property, sometimes called a lordship, at last became vested in the family of Newton, from whom it passed by marriage to the Hedworths of Whickham. It is mostly copyhold, under the bishop's manor ofChester. Edjiondsley, a township about three miles to the south-west of Chester, and which contains about fortv houses, chiefly occupied by farmers and their labourers. In 1362, William de Ed mansley died seized of the manor held in chief of the bishops, by homage, fealty, and ten shillings. This manor passed into the possession of various persons, until, being forfeited by Robert Claxton, attainted of high treason, it became, in 1573, the property of John Heath, of Kepyer, Esq. In 1632, it was granted to the Wardells. West Edmondsley is the estate and residence of their de scendant, Mr. George Wardell. Broomyholme. \u2014 This estate, in 1328, was held by Ranulph de Merley, of the hospital of Alver ton, by 18s. rent, and 14d. to Robert de Lambton. After passing into various families, it was, in 1720, conveyed by George Greenwell to William and Henry Lambton, Esqrs. Trib/ey manor was anciently held cojointly with Birtley. In 1427, it was granted by charter to William Lambton the younger, Robert Lambton the younger, and Roger Bothe. Since tha^ period, Tribley has formed part of the ancient family estate of Lambton. VOL. I. 2 P"], [282, "CHESTER WARD.\u2014 M. D. 146 Twizel (signifying a boundary) is a manor on Stanley Burn, at the extreme north-western verge of Chester parish. It was successively in possession of the families of Birtley, Lumley, and Tempest ; and was purchased from the crown, in 1587, by George Johnson. In 1714, the John sons sold it for \u00a3'2041 to Emanuel Bradley, whose sons resold the estate for _P3500 to the New tons of Burnopfield. A moiety, under a commission of bankruptcy, was conveyed to Andrew Stoney, Esq., in 177-5- It was conveyed to Thomas Bowes, who, in 1800, under orders in chan cery, granted to Richard Scruton and John Humble, in trust for Thomas Wade, Esq. The Hagg estate, long in possession of the Pearsons, was sold to William and Samuel Newton, of Burnop field, and has since remained united to Twizel. Walridge stands on the north of the Conebeck, one mile and a half to the south-west of Ches ter. It was long the estate of the Lumleys, and, in 1633, was left to the two daughters and coheirs of Thomas Smith. In 17^0, it was the property of George Black, Gent., and was pur chased some years ago by the late Mr. David Stephenson, of Newcastle, architect, whose widow occupies the house at New Walridge. On establishing Lambton Park races, Lord Durham formed a training ground, and erected ex cellent stables on Walridge Fell. They are now occupied by Charles Attwood, Esq., who is en gaged in a series of experiments for improving the breed of the English racer. There is an earthen-ware, and also a fire-brick manufactory at Walridge ; and, near JoHiffe's New Houses, Messrs. Thompson, Sorsbie, and Co. are winning an extensive colliery. Plavtsworth, a small village three miles north of Durham. This township contains six farm houses, two public houses, a corn-mill, and a gentleman's mansion-house, called Plawsworth Cot tage, the residence of Thomas Purvis, of Newcastle, Esq. This estate anciently belonged to a family of its own name, but was subsequently possessed by various families, amongst whom were the Kelawes, Forcers, Wylughbys, Boyntons, Hotons, Claxtons, Conyers, Daldons, Kilbngwycks, Brounfields, and Boweses. The manor of Nettleworth, in this township, anciently belonged to the Gategangs, afterwards to the Hagthorps, and then to the Wessingtons.

Lady Ravensworth also allows a yearly stipend to a schoolmistress for the instruction of poor girls. Lamesley Chapel is entirely modern, being rebuilt in 17-59; and the tower, which is a plain, square structure, was built in 1821. The interior is neat and commodious, and there is a gallery all around. The whole is capable of seating upwards of 650 persons. The chancel is small, and uncom monly plain and unornamented.

Ayton Cottage, the former residence of B. Thompson, Esq., is being put into a state of repair. Ayton Banks (formerly written Eighton) is mentioned as an appendage of Ravensworth, and is included in the general conveyance of the Ravensworth estates from Gascoigne to Liddell. Yet a small freehold in Eighton was held by a family who early bore the local name, but which was carried by marriage into the family of the Ravensworths of Gateshead before 1380.

Mr. Balguy bore a distinguished part in the Bangoriau controversy ; and he was the able, but polite adversary of some ofthe principles of Lord Shaftesbury. He also answered Hutchinson's \" Inquiry into the Original of our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue ;\" which was first delivered in 1728, in an assize sermon at Newcastle, and printed by order of the judges. About this time, he was collated by Bishop Hoadley to a prebend in the church of Salisbury; and, in the following year, he obtained, through Dr. Talbot, bishop of Durham, the vicarage of Northallerton. He died 21st September, 1748, and left a high character as a candid and able philosophical writer. All his treatises were collected and published in one volume, and also a volume of his sermons. His only son was the famous. Dr. Thomas Balguy, archdeacon of Winchester. During the first four years that he held the humble livinp of Lamesley, \"he did not intermit one week without composing a new sermon ; and, desirous that so excel lent an example should be followed by his son, he destroyed almost his whole stock, and committed at one time two hundred and fifty to the flames.\" \u2014 Biog.

A century later, Bishop Ranulph granted Ravensworth and Eighton to his nephew, Richard, the stock of the Barons Fitz-Marmaduke. The last Richard was murdered, on the old bridge at Durham, by Robert Nevil ; when his sister, Eleanor, carried the manor of Ravensworth in marriage to a younger branch of the Lumleys. Her son, Robert de Lumley, in 1383 died seized of the manors of Ravensworth and Lamesley. In 1489, Isabel, only daughter of Bartram Lumley, was contracted to Sir Henry Boynton; and Isabel, their daughter and sole heir, became the wife of Sir Henry Gascoigne. Their grandson, Sir AVilliam Gascoigne, of Sedbury, in 1607 alienated the castle of Ravenshelm,* the manors of Ravenshelm and Lameslev, and lands and services in Eighton, Hedley, Over Eighton, Nether Eighton, Longacres, Northendes, Ravensworth, and Pokerley, to Thomas Liddell, of Newcastle, merchant. The manor of Ravensworth includes a very extended and valuable field of coal. A grant of way-leave from a colliery here occurs from Bishop Ruthall in 1-530. The first waggon-ways, and the second steam-engine used in the north, belonged to the Liddells ;-(- and Colonel Liddell * The boundaries of the manors of Ravensworth, or Lamesley, and Eighton, were established (in a cause betwixt the bishop of Durham, and Sir Henry Liddell, Bart., 1715) very much in the words ofthe original grant of Bishop Ranulph. \" Beginning at Chowdene where it falls into Tame, and from thence directly up the Dene to Popplewell, thence directly to Seamorewell, thence to a well in Scadenslawe, and so down by the runner of water from that well as it descends into Tame, thence to Mereburn as the water runs, and from the head of Mereburn to Aldrige Dene, and by Aldrige Dene as the water runs and descends into Tame, and so up Tame to Beckley Burn as it falls into Tame, and from Beckley Burn to a small runner of water which descends from Felford's Fenn, and up that rivulet or runner to Felford's Fenn, and from Felford's Fenn to Avish burn, and down Avishburn as it runs and falls into Blackburn, and so down Blackburn as it runs and falls into Tame, eastward, and up Tame till Chowdene falls into Tame, where the boundary began.\" Besides the integral manor of Ravensworth, there existed several freeholds or tenements, held by subin feudation under the chief lords of the fee. Thus, John Scrutevill held twenty-four acres in Ravensworth of Alexander de Kibblesworth, and twenty acres in Lamesley of the Lady of Ravenshelm, then styled Countess of Ravenshelm. Such titles were, in ancient times, bestowed by common habit on persons not legally entitled to any dignity. Thus, we have, in an old pedigree, Erles of Socburn \u2014 also a Countess of Clargill ; and in Northumberland the famous Countess ot Hep-pie Castle. Of the aforesaid Countess of Ravenshelm, Alexander de Kibblesworth held half the vill of Ravensworth, by three-pence rent and suit at court ; and the same moiety, John, his brother, held of Robert de Lumley in 1370- A portion of land, in 1451, was held by a family who bore the local name, but who seem to have belonged to Gateshead. The estate became the property of the Liddell family in 1730. \u2014 See the Charters on property here in Surtees, vol. ii. p. 210. t See Mackenzie's Hist, of Northumb. vol. i. p. 146. 2 Q VOL, I."], [286, "CHESTER WARD.\u2014 M. D. 150 and the Hon. Charles Montague were the founders of the partnership vulgarly called the Grand Allies. Ravensworth Castle stands beautifully on the side of a hill, sloping gradually towards the river Team. In the time of the Boyntons and Gascoigns, it seems to have consisted of four oblong square towers, connected by a regular curtain, and probably including a keep or central tower. Buck's View, in 1728, exhibits the towers, with a perfectly modern building betwixt them. Hut chinson says the apartments were small, but neat, without much ornament : the saloon and stair case were spacious, with a good dining-room. In 1808, nearly the whole of the old house was taken down, except two of the old towers, which are incorporated in the offices. One of them is covered with ivy, and has a fine effect as seen through the plantation that is rising around the scite of this part of the castle. The erection of the present magnificent edifice was commenced, when the old building was partly removed, on a plan of the light Gothic, furnished by Nash ; and which consists of a selection from the castle architecture of various periods, skilfully brought into contact. The most incongruous part of the combinations seems to be the introduction of the square-headed windows belonging to the time of James and Elizabeth. But the principle of utility perhaps justifies this obvious deviation from purity of style. The castle has three fronts : the south one is finished, and the various towers and facades produce a pleasing effect. A handsome conservatory, built from a plan furnished by a gentleman of the family, terminates the west front. Opposite to this, a handsome fountain is about to be built. The water will fall into the bason from eight leopards' heads, while a powerful jet is to play from the centre. Most part of the north front remains to be built ; but, when finished, the structure will include every requisite to the beauty and convenience of a splendid mansion. The eastern side is closed in by offices, and by plantations, which will effectually ex clude the view of Gateshead Fell. The freestone used in the building, taken from an adjoining quarry, is small ; but the walls are thick and solid. On one of the towers is a reservoir, which contains 3000 gallons of water. The grand suite of apartments on the ground-floor are lighted from the south, and are uniformly 18 feet in height, witli coved and ribbed roofs, tastefully plastered. The saloon is a neat apart ment, 24 feet square ; and the drawing-room is 36 feet 4 inches long by 24 feet broad. The dining-room, which is about the same size, contains a curious sideboard, of old carved oak. But, indeed, all the furniture of the various apartments combine the solid, substantial forms, fashionable in old times, with the conveniences and elegancies of modern improvements ; and the whole har monizes with the general style of the castle. Large folding-doors of thick oak divide the apart ments ; and which, when thrown open, present a clear view from the billiard-room at the east end of the building, to the conservatory at the western extremity. There will also be a clear passage from the saloon at the south front, to the grand entrance under the north gateway. The museum, which is to be formed above this gateway, will be 36 feet square ; and the picture-gallery will be 101 feet in length, and 22 feet in breadth, and lighted by domes.* The billiard-room is, at present, hung with some very curious Flemish tapestry ; and a number of valuable pictures are distributed amongst the chief apartments. A battle-piece, by Salvator * The accuracy, firmness, and taste of the plastering, reflects credit on Mr. Ralph Dodds, of Newcastle, by whom it has been mostly executed. Mr. W. Brown, the mason, has, in many instances, evinced skill in executing works of Gothic architecture ; and the whole is ably superintended by Mr. John Liddell, clerk of the works, to whose talents all the tradesmen employed bear testimony."], [287, "LAMESLEY. 151 Rosa, exhibits all the taste, spirit, and expression of that inimitable master. A Magdalen, by the daughter of Carlo Dolci, and the portrait of a lady, by Sir Peter Lely, are characteristically beau tiful and delicate. Netscher's portrait of Mareschal Le Due d'Harcourt is excellent. Dead Game, by Casteels; Moses at the burning Bush, by G. Poussin ; and a landscape, by N. Poussin, are all good old pictures. The Musical Party, by Michael Angelo de Carravagio, is curious ; but the Boar Hunt is an extremely valuable, ingenious, and bold performance, the view of which must be gratifying to every visitor of taste. There are several other excellent paintings, which it is necessary to pass over. The last portrait painted by the late Sir Thomas Lawrence of His Majesty George IV. is a pleasing specimen of the style of that justly celebrated artist. A small landscape, by the Rev. J. Thompson, is a real gem of art. Many of the landscapes which adorn the walls of the castle are painted by Lady Ravensworth, and shew good perspective, and great power of light and shadow. These pieces mostly represent Italian scenery, and are much in the style of N. Poussin. Amongst the other curiosities of art which abound here are, a model of the castle itself, by Dodds, a model of St. Peter's church at Rome, and another of St. Paul's ca thedral, London : also, several good specimens of sculpture, that appear to have been executed in Italy ; but, as far as the likenesses are concerned, they are certainly not superior to the works of some of our native artists. The bronze figures are peculiarly excellent, and constitute the most valuable part of the collection. The preserved birds, with other articles connected with the study of Natural History, belong to the Hon. Thomas Liddell, who is likewise a collector of rare and valuable pictures by ancient masters. The castle is sheltered on the north by a fine forest of oaks and evergreens, which cover the rising grounds, and impart to the whole a rich and warm appearance. The south aspect consists of at least three hundred acres of rich meadow lands, scattered over with large trees at irregular distances. The vale of Lamesley lies below, extending about a mile and a half, and beautifully cloathed with wood. At the south entrance into the park stands a handsome new lodge, erected in a style corresponding with the castle. This spacious park includes the ancient baronial ap pendage of a heronry. The gardens lie a short distance north of the castle ; and though the situation be unfavourable, they are neat and productive. The vinery is, perhaps, the largest in this part of England. The glass, it is estimated, would cover more than an acre of ground. The head gardener's cottage, at the chief entrance, exhibits a striking specimen of good taste. But all the cottages, scattered over the ample grounds at Ravensworth, are distinguished by such marks of industry and comfort as reflect the highest credit on the noble and benevolent proprietor. The ancient pedigree of the Liddell family is very imperfect. They are first mentioned as Lords of Liddel Castle and Barony of Bust. From the time of their settling in this country, they have been considerable proprietors of coal works. Thomas Liddell, of Newcastle, merchant adventurer, was sheriff of that town in 1363, and mayor in 1572. He was buried 9th May, 1577- Thomas Liddell, his son and heir, was also sheriff' of New-castle in 1592, and mayor both in 1597 an<l 1609- He purchased the manors of Ravensworth, Eighton, and Lamesley, and died in August, 1619- By his first wife, Margaret, daughter of John Watson, alderman of Newcastle, he had Thomas, his heir, and three daughters, married ; and bv his second wife, Jane, daughter of Henry Mitford, alderman of Newcastle, he had Henry Liddell, who married Elizabeth, daughter and coheir of William Jennison, of Newcastle, Esq., from whom"], [288, "152 CHESTER WARD.\u2014 M.

He was created a baronet 2d November, 1642; and, two years after wards, was one of the gallant defenders of Newcastle, which was stormed by the Scots after a leag-uer of eighteen months, and a close siege of eight weeks. Sir Thomas was carried prisoner to London, committed to the charge of General Lambert, and at last compounded for his estates as a delinquent for =\u00a34000. He married, 23d February, 1595, Isabel, daughter of Henry Anderson, of Newcastle and of Haswell-Grange, co. pal., Esq., by whom he had issue seven sons and seven daughters.

He married Catherine, daughter and heir of Sir John Bright, of Bodsworth, co. York, Bart., by whom he had issue. John, their second son, was adopted heir to his grandfather, Sir John Bright, and assumed that name ; Henry, their third son, died without issue ; George, their fourth son, M.

He died in his father's life-time, and was buried 3d June, 1715. Sir Henry Liddell, 4th Bart, (eldest son of Thomas Liddell, Esq., and his wife Jane), was baptized 1st August, 1708. He was member of parliament for Morpeth 1734 and 1741, and was created Baron Ravensworth, of Ravensworth Castle, co. pal., by patent, 29th June, 1747- He died 30th January, 1784, and was buried at Lamesley. By his wife, Ann, daughter and heir of Sir Peter Delme, Knt., alderman of London, his only issue was Ann, who married, first, Augustus- Henry, Duke of Grafton ; and, second, John, Earl of Upper Ossory. Leaving no male issue, Lord Ravensworth's barony expired ; while the baronetcy devolved upon his nephew, Henry- George, son of Thomas Liddell, of Newton Hall, Esq., by Margaret, daughter of Sir William Bowes, of Streatlam Castle.

Sir Henry died at Sidmouth, co. Devon, 26th November, 1791, buried at Lamesley the 18th December. He enjoyed a high reputation for a warm, generous, but somewhat romantic disposition. His rapid excursion to Lapland, in consequence of a wager, and his return with two native girls and some rein-deer, are particularly described in Consett's Tour through Sweden, &c.

On the private road near the castle is a cross, a plain shaft on an octagon pedestal. The com mon tradition is, that when Newcastle, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, was infected with the plague, the country people left their provisions at this place. This may be true: yet, in ancient times, almost every considerable village had its cross ; and crosses were erected in many different places, for the purpose of reminding travellers of their religious duties. Ravetisworth Hamlet is reduced to a very few detached houses, most of the cottages having been pulled down. Blackburn FeU. \u2014 This common, containing by estimation 2000 acres, with the stinted pasture called the South Pasture, containing 600 acres, were divided by an act passed in 1801.

The town fields of Ravensworth to be divided amongst persons having common right, reserving to Sir Thomas-Henry Liddell, Bart., the coal mines and quarries. Sir John Eden surrendered his claim on Beamish East Moor (otherwise part of Blackburn Fell) for some consideration, and the right of the soil was awarded to Sir Thomas Liddell. The Earl of Strathmore brought no action within six months (the time limited), and the lordship of the soil of Hedley Fell was also therefore awarded to Sir Thomas-Henry Liddell, Bart.* * The following depositions, printed by Surtees, in the cause of 1715 (in which the Bishop's right to the mines, and the plaintiff Sir Henry Liddell's right to the soil and royalties of Blackburn Fell, were esta blished) are curious : \u2014 vol. i,\u2014 8. 2 R"], [290, "CHESTER WARD.\u2014 M.

Kibblesworth, a township and straggling village, one mile west of Lamesley. In ancient times, it gave name to its possessors ; and Roger de Kibblesworth occurs as early as 1180. This family afterwards alienated half of their ancient manor ; and, in 1368, Alexander de Kibblesworth died seized of the Upper HaU, with half the vill. Meanwhile, the Scrutevills held the other moiety of the manor. Kibblesworth was subsequently divided, in very various proportions, amongst the Harbottles, Wilds, Hedworths, Lawsons, Bonners, Hargraves, and Lewens. The part held at a late period by the Johnstons is now vested by purchase in Lord Ravensworth. The Greenwells long held property here, and their family mansion is supposed to have been the Nether Hall. The Broad Moor, adjoining, was divided in 1672, before which the open fields abutted on the great waste of Blackburn Fell on the west. Hedley, or Hedley Hall, lies to the west, across Blackburn Fell. It was anciently the estate of the Mundevills, of which family Gilbert de Merley and Agnes his wife held the manor of Hed ley, with a moiety of the vill, making suit at the court of Ravenshelm, and paying to William Bultflour and his heirs 13s. 4d. rent. It soon after became parcel of the Gibside estates, of which the Blaxtons were vested in the reign of King James I., as appears by a pardon of alienation in the 14th of that king. It is now, by regular descent, the property of the Strathmore family. \" Blackburne Fell, about 3000 acres on the west of Ravensworth, joins the defendant's (the bishop's) manors of Chester-le-Street and Whickham ; Chowdene Fell, about 2000 acres east of Ravensworth and Eighton, joins the defendant's manor of Gateshead ; Blackburne Fell lies between the waters of Blackburne and Tame, on the west of Tame ; Chowden, east of Tame. \" Sir T.

This chapelry is bounded by the Derwent, dividing it from the parish of Ryton, on the north, by the parish of Whickham on the north and north-east, by the chapelry of Lamesley on the east, by Chester-le-Street on the south-east, by Chester and Lanchester on the south, and by Lanchester and the chapelry of Medomsley on the west. The chapelry is divided into two constableries: 1. Beamish, which includes Tanfield, Tanfield Easter-Leigh, North, South, and Middle Cnwsey, Kiphills, Crook, Deansclose, and Burnopfield ; 2. Lintz Green, which includes Tanfield Wester- Leigh, Stanley, Shieldrow, Beckley, Andrewfield, Bryan's Leap, Yewyhurst, Northorn, Lintz Hall, Lintz Green, Coves House, Loft House, Steleclose, Priestfield, and High and Low Friarside. Tanfield. Tanfield village is scattered over the declivity of a hill, sloping southwards, eight miles south west of Newcastle. The name, it is supposed, by a very probable conjecture, is a corruption of Teamfield. It contains five farmholds, three public houses, and a boarding academy for young gentlemen, kept by the Rev. William Simpson, curate of Tanfield. The manor of Tanfield was uniformly held by the old Lords of Beamish. In 1388, Bartram Monboucher held the manor and hamlet of Tanfield of Robert Conyers and Aline his wife (who was the heir of the old De la Leighs, Lords of Beamish and Witton-Gilbert), by one penny at the Nativity, in lieu of all service. Eleven years later, the younger Bartram Monboucher held the manors of Taumfield and Cawce of Aline Conyers; and of the heirs of the said Aline, in 1462, Bartram Harbotel held the manor of Taumfield, including Cawset, le Croke, and le Legh. Tan- field was included in the forfeiture of Thomas Earl of Northumberland, 1569, and was granted by the crown (inter alia) to Henry Jackman, who alienated the estate in parcels. Tanfield West Demesnes was granted by Jackman, in 1598, to Thomas Harbotel, Gent., who died in 1612 seized of the same estate, held of the crown by knight's service, leaving Robert Harbotel his son and heir. Rowland Shafto held the East maynes as tenant to the crown, 12 Eliz. 1570; John Shafto died seized of the same messuage, Tanfield East Demesnes, in 1600; and 3d Aug. 10 Jac. this same estate was conveyed by Anthony and William Shafto, and William Porter, Gents., to Richard Hickson, who granted two years later to William Kennet, Esq. In 1629, Sir William Kennet, Knt., died seized of the capital messuage called the East Demesnes in Tanfield, held of the crown by knight's service, leaving William Kennet, Esq., his son and heir. The Dawsons had also, about a century ago, a considerable property in Tanfield, with a seat house at the east of the vil lage, now annexed by purchase to the Beamish estate. Thomas Wray, of Beamish, Esq., sold the coal under Tanfield Moor to the Pitt family of Dorsetshire, in whom it is still vested.

Tan-field- Leigh, observes Hutchinson, \"is mentioned in Bishop Hatfield's Survey in such large descriptions, that we are induced to believe by that name the whole of Tanfield was anciently comprehended.\" At that time, William Jonson held four messuages, and six parts of Tanfield- Leigh, containing eight score acres, once John de Birtley 's, of Twisell. Bartram Monboucher held seven parts of Tanfield-Leigh out of fifteen, with the vill of Tan field-Leigh, and one hundred and twenty-six acres. This property seems to have been held by the Monbouchers and Percys till they parted company after the crown grant to Henry Jackman. In 1598, James and Thomas Shafto purchased the Leigh of Jackman, from whom it descended to the Spearmans, who sold it, in 1729, to the Simpsons of Bradley Tanfield Moor, containing 1040 acres, was divided by act of parliament in 1800.

Contrasted with the pit country on the south and east, or with the dreary heights of Blackburn Fell, its aspect conveys impressions of repose and sweetness. Beamish House, the residence of Morton John Davison, Esq., is a respectable-looking and pleasant family mansion The vale here expands itself \"into a fine level flat or strath, bordered on every side by rising grounds of irregular form, richly cloathed with luxuriant forest trees. A profusion of lofty, thriv ing evergreens are interspersed amongst the nearer plantations.\" The old park lies southward, on upland ground. Beamish Lodge is the residence of Mr. John Smith, agent for the estate. Guiscard de Charron, Lord of Beamish, in 1268 left a son, whose only daughter, Joan, married Bartram Monboucher, Knight, of Northumberland. Five Bartram Monbouchers successively held the manors of Beamish and Tanfield; when the inheritance, by maternal descent, devolved on Bartram Harbotel. His grandson left two daughters and coheirs, one of whom became wife of Thomas Percy, executed at Tyburn for rebellion in 1537. Her son, Thomas, Earl of Northum berland, was beheaded at York in 1572, when Beamish and Tanfield were forfeited to the crown.* In 1572, the queen granted Sir Henry Gate, Knt., both these manors, which were, in 1593, con veyed to Henry Jackman, of London, Esq. In 1651, Beamish was the property of Colonel Wray, a royalist, who suffered severely during the Commonwealth. George Wray, Esq., in I67I sold Beamish to Major Christian, by whom it was conveyed to the Davisons, and is now the property of Morton John Eden, Esq. (second son of Sir John), who has taken the name of Davison. Cawsey lies to the north-west of Beamish. North Cawsey is the property of Sir Thomas Cla vering, Bart., with part of Middle Cawsey : the other part, with South Cawsey, belongs to Morton John Davison, Esq. Cawsey Burn runs through a deep and romantic dell, over which is that remarkable structure called Tanfield Arch. It was built, in 1729, by the Grand Allies, at the cost of \u00a312,000, to obtain a level for the passage of coal-waggons. The span of the arch is 103 feet ; it springs from abutments about 9 feet high ; and, being semicircular, the entire elevation is about 60 feet. From this height the level is kept up by artificial embankments of earth, in * The earl's third daughter, Lucy, wife of Sir Edward Stanley, had a daughter, Venetia, whose extreme beauty has been celebrated by contemporary poets and painters.

Lintz Green lies on the western verge of Tanfield chapelry, divided from the chapelry of Me domsley by the Pontop Burn. This place gave name to an ancient family, who were early bene factors to the church of Durham. Lintz Green, Lintz Hall, and Lintzford, seem to have been comprehended in the estates of the Lintz family. In 1352, Bishop Hatfield escheated the lands of Thomas de Lynz, who fled for felony. Either by descent or inheritance, the estate was after wards vested in the family of Redheugh, from whom it passed by marriage to the Hedleys.

HE parish of Whickham is bounded by the Tyne on the north; by the Team, dividing it from the parish of Gateshead, on the east ; by the chapelries of Lamesley and Tanfield on the south and south-west; and by the Darwent, di- viding it from the parish of Ryton, on the west. It is divided into four con- stableries : 1. Whickham-Town ; 2. SwalweU; 3. Whickham-Low-Hand ; 4. Whickham-Fellside. These divisions or quarters support their poor jointly from one fund, under the superintendence of two overseers. In 1821, the whole parish contained 3713 inhabitants ; and the estimated value of the lands and buildings assessed to the county-rate, in 1829, was \u00a39952. The earliest account of the manor of Whickham is in the Boldon Book, where the bishop had xxxv villain tenants, each of whom held an oxgang of land, consisting of 15 acres, at 16d. rent, exclusive of services, which were severe. Every villain wrought for the lord three days each week in the year, besides the labour of harvest and ploughing; they were bound to erect a cottage 40 feet long, and 15 wide, every year, for the maintenance of the town ; and carry and fetch from Durham and Bedlington the bishop's baggage, &c. when required, with the allowance of the corody whilst they wrought. They also paid 9s. cornage rent, and provided a milch cow for the lord, and for every oxgang of land they found a hen and ten eggs, and served in the lord's fishery in Tyne. The head-borough man, who is styled pr\u0153positus, now called the grieve, had 24 acres of land allotted to him in recompense for the duties of his office. Tlie manor was then under firm with the villain service, mills, carts, harrows, fisheries, and '20 chalder of oats of the bishop's mea sure, rendering \u00a327, and performing certain services in carriage, for which there was an allowance of 2d. for every horse. The punder had land assigned him, besides an acknowledgment from every tillage farm by the threave; and he provided the bishop with 40 hens and 300 eggs.

Some portions, considered originally as parcel of the manor, as SwalweU, Axwell, Hollinside, and Fugerhouse, became free estates, held by reserved rents under the see of Durham, even previous to Hatfield's Survey. The north common fields of Whickham were divided, by agreement of the various parties inte rested (about thirty in number), April 16, 1672. This division was confirmed by decree in the bishop's court of chancery. An injunction was also issued, under which the highways were set out, and ordered to be repaired by the parishioners. Mines. \u2014 Bishop Bury granted a lease of the mines under the manors of Whickham and Gates head to Sir Thomas Gray, Knt., and John Pulhore, rector of Whickham, for twelve years, under 500 marks rent.

The manors of Whickham and Gateshead were amongst the possessions of the see extorted from Bishop Barnes in 1582 by Queen Elizabeth. The lease of 99 years was transferred by the crown, November 12, 1583, to Henry Anderson and William Selby, aldermen of Newcastle, who granted, in 1591, to thirteen principal burgesses, on trust for the corporation, who held the grand lease till its expiration in 1681. The reversion had been granted by Bishop Cosin to his son-in-law, Sir Gilbert Gerard, and others.

The north and south aisles are uniform, each separated from the nave by three short round pillars, with square capitals, supporting circular arches without ornament or moulding. The roof of the chancel is covered with plain ceiling ; and the body of the church is crowded with galleries, which fill the west end of the nave and part of the aisles. The nave is badly lighted, and the pews are very close to each other. The pulpit stands in the centre. The chief entrance is through a south porch : there is a small north door, under a pointed arch. The font is an old bason of Stanhope marble. The lights are mostly small and modern ; and on the north side are indications of old arrangements, now altered and modernized.

It was considerably enlarged and improved by the late incumbent ; and the present occupant has also added much to its convenience. The Glebe consists of the garden, orchard, and about 45 acres of land. Nearly ten acres were added to the glebe at the time of Whickham enclosure.

Charities of Blackiston and Thomlinson. \u2014 The school, in the parish of Whickham, was originally founded by Robert Thomlinson, D. D., about the year 1714, who applied to this purpose a legacy of \u00a3100, left by Jane Blackiston, for teaching poor children of the parish in the Church Catechism, and reading and writing, and for putting them out to trade; and who also himself, by his will, bearing date 18th November, 1745, left the school and dwelling-house for the master, with certain galleries and pews in the parish church of Whickham, and also the sum of \u00a3100 in addition to the like sum given by Mrs. Blackiston, to the arch deacon of Northumberland, the vicar of Newcastle, and the librarian of the testator's library in Newcastle, and their respective successors, for the support of such school, in such manner as in his will was particularly expressed. The pews and galleries are now let at \u00a311 or \u00a312 per annum. The two sums of \u00a3100 each were laid out in 1751, in the purchase of \u00a3200 South Sea Annuities, now producing \u00a36; and an allotment of three quarters of an acre set out to the school, is let for \u00a31 per annum. From these sources the whole of the permanent income of the school is now derived, amounting to about \u00a319 per annum. In the year 1825, the national system was adopted in the school, and a house for a mistress was built by private subscription. The establishment is now supported partly by the income above mentioned, but principally by voluntary contributions ; and it is under the management of a committee of subscribers, who act with the trustees under Dr. Thomlinson 's will. Hewelt's Charity. \u2014 John Hewett, who died 3d December, 1738, bequeathed \u00a3100, the interest thereof to be distributed yearly on Easter Tuesday, or as soon after as convenient, in manner following, viz. \u00a330 to be laid out in Bibles, Common Prayer Books, or other books of instruction in the Christian religion, to be given to such of the charity-scholars in Whickham as should best deserve the same as a reward for their diligence, and the remainder towards binding out yearly one or more boys apprentices out of the charity school at Whickham, to some lawful trade or employment. The sum of \u00a3100 is in the hands of Lord Ravensworth, by whom interest is paid at the rate of 4^ per cent. An account of the application of the"], [304, "168 CHESTER WARD\u2014 W. D. income of this charity is entered in one of the parish books from the year 1793 ; and it appears to have been disposed of in books, in apprentice fees, and in clothing for children. Of late years, \u00a31 per annum has been brought to the same account from Marshall's charity, hereafter mentioned. At the end of the year 1823, the whole of the receipts had been disposed of as above mentioned. Since that time, \u00a31, 10s. only has been laid out in the purchase of books, and \u00a31 in clothing ; and in November, 1828, there was an accumu lation of interest in the Newcastle savings bank, amounting to \u00a320, Ils. 7d., out of which two or three sums of 30s. each have been since ordered to be paid for providing apprentices, who have been bound out, with clothing. Marshall's Charity \u2014 By the will of Robert Marshall, the sum of \u00a320 was bequeathed to the church wardens and overseers of the poor of Whickham, to be placed out at interest, and the produce applied to wards the clothing of one of the poorest boys of the charity-school in the township of Whickham ; and the sum was received and paid into the hands of Thomas-Henry Liddell, who engaged to pay annually \u00a31 inte rest. The sum of \u00a320 is now in the hands of Lord Ravensv/orth, and \u00a31 as the interest thereof is added to the produce of Hewett's charity, as above mentioned. Ralph Harrison, by his will, bearing date 26th March, 1687, besides other benefactions to the poor of Boldon and other places, left \u00a3100 to the use of the poor of Whickham. Lady Clavering, 18th May, 1726, gave \u00a3100 to the poor of this parish, to which Thomas Bowes, Esq., added \u00a320 more. Her ladyship's be quest of \u00a3100, and Ralph Harrison's legacy of \u00a3100, are in the hands of Lord Ravensworth; but the gift of \u00a320 is lost. The interest of the two sums, being \u00a310 per annum, is added to the produce of Bishop Wood's charity, hereafter mentioned; and the whole amount, \u00a318, Ils. 3d., is divided amongst the four quarters ofthe parish, according to the number of applicants in each, and is distributed in the vestry by the respective church-wardens on New Year's day, in sums of 2s. or 3s. to each person. Thomas Wood, bishop of Litchfield and Coventry, by his will, bearing date 11th November, 1690, be queathed to the town of Whickham \u00a3300, besides the \u00a3100 formerly given by him to the said town. In an old parish book there is an entry, stating that \u00a3100 of Bishop Wood's money was secured on Jackson's land,. then Lady Clavering's, and paid \u00a36 per annum; and that the other \u00a3100 was in the hands of Alderman Fenwick, of Newcastle. It further appears, from the parish books, that in 1737 a considerable sum was due from Alderman Fenwick for the arrears of interest, and that he afterwards paid these arrears, and \u00a356, 10s., part of the principal. The sum of \u00a357 appears to have been placed out at interest, and to have come into the hands of Lord Ravensworth, who now pays interest for the amount at 4^ per cent-, being \u00a32, Ils. 3d.. per annum. In respect of the other sum of \u00a3100, there is now paid \u00a36 yearly by the agent of the Marquis of Bute, who is the owner of a farm in Whickham, of which a close called Jackson's land forms a part. The yearly sums of \u00a32, Us. 3d. and \u00a30 are received by the church- wardens, and distributed with the produce of other charities above mentioned. Sir James Clavering, by his will, bearing date 6th December, 1697, left a rent-charge out of his messuage and lands at Crook Bank ; out of which \u00a3l2 he appointed there should be distributed every Sunday morn-. ing, after divine service in Whickham church, by the overseers, 24 penny loaves of wheaten bread to 24 poor people of the said parish, who should be present at divine service or sermon, if not hindered by age or sickness ; and that 24 coats, petticoats, and waistcoats, of grey russet, should be yearly provided and given. to 24 poor men, women, or children, born and living within the parish of Whickham, on St. Andrew's day, such poor women and children to be appointed by his heirs. Up to the time of the Commissioners' inquiry, the bread was sent to the church every week, and the church-wardens of each quarter distributed it after divine service amongst the poor who attended at the distribution, without discrimination. In consequence of their recommendation, the church-wardens have since agreed upon a list of the most deserving poor ; and it is intended to confine the benefit of the charity to such persons, provided they should attend divine ser vice, if not prevented by illness. The persons who receive the coats and petticoats are selected by the rector. On a table of benefactions in the church it is stated, that Sir John Clavering, Bart., left to the poor of this parish, by will, in 1713, \u00a350. Nothing is now known of this bequest. In the Parliamentary Returns in 1786 it is stated, that George Bowes in 1739 left land producing \u00a310 a year, that Thomas Bowes in 1721 left land producing \u00a33 a year, and \u00a3100 in money, producing \u00a320 a year, which lands and money were then vested in A. R. Bowes; the objects of the charities being the cloth ing and teaching poor children of this parish. No information can be obtained respecting these charities. Samuel Hancock, who died May, 1725, devised certain lands in Lawfield Bank, in the parish of Barnard Castle, to trustees, to the use of the poor of the parish of Whickham, in full recompense and satisfaction for all poor-monies to be charged on his lands in the parish of Whickham ; upon condition, that if at any time the poor-money should be charged upon any of his lands in the parish of Whickham, then the said devise should be void and of no effect. There is also a memorandum in the parish book, stating that this benefac-."], [305, "WHICKHAM. 169 tion was given up, the overseers preferring to assess the lands. It appears also that the testator devised some lands to the chapelry of Tanfield on the same conditions, which did not take effect for the like reason. John Bowes, Earl of Strathmore, by his will, bearing date 3d July, 1817, devised all his real estates to trustees for the term of 1000 years, to be computed from the day of his death, on the trusts in his will men tioned ; and he directed that the clear yearly sum of \u00a325 should for ever after be a charge upon his Gibside estate, and paid to or amongst the poor of Gibside, and be applied and distributed from time to time amongst such objects in such manner and in such proportions as the occupier for the time being of the mansion-house called Gibside, or when there should be no occupier of the same, then in such manner as the trustees or trustee for the time being of the said term of 1000 years, so long as such term should continue, should order and direct. No distribution has been made in respect of this legacy. Church Lands. \u2014 The following premises are held by lhe church-wardens of this parish, the rents of which are considered as applicable to the repairs of the church : \u2014 \u00a3. _\u2022_ d. A house, and three-quarters of an acre of land in Swallwell quarter, let to Launcelot Pescod, at the yearly rent of ... ... ... ... ...5 0 0 A close of land, containing about four acres, let to Charles Attwood, for a term of three years from Lady -day, 1829, at the yearly rent of ... ... ... 25 0 0 An allotment of about one acre, set out in respect of the church lands, on the in- closure of Whickham Fell, let at the yearly rent of ... ... ...10 0 \u00a331 0 0 The several rents above mentioned are carried to the general account of the church-wardens ; and it is stated that the annual expenses of repairing the church, amount, upon an average, to considerably more than the whole of these rents. There is also another close of about five acres, the rents of which are received by an officer called the grieve, but which does not appear to be affected by any charitable use. Near Whickham is a stratum of burnt earth, consisting chiefly of clay and stone, which tradi tion says was caused by the English army setting fire to their tents previous to their hasty retreat, when the Scottish forces crossed the Tyne from Newburn in 1640. The burning camp communi cated with a seam of coal, which is said to have burnt for many years with great fury ; and the calcined stones and earth are now made useful and ornamental in forming garden walks and paths to gentlemen's houses.* * William Shield, the very eminent English composer, and master of his majesty's musicians in ordinary, was born in this village about the year 1750. He was first taught to modulate his voice and practise the violin, when he was only six years old, by his father, who was a singing master ; and subsequently received a few lessons of thorough-bass, in his infancy, from the celebrated Avison, of Newcastle. At the death of his father, he was bound by indenture to Edward Davison, a boat-builder in South Shields; and during his apprenticeship, led the Newcastle Subscription Concerts, where he repeatedly played the solo parts of Ge- minani's and Giardini's concertos. His first attempt at composition was setting the music to an ode for the opening ofthe Free Masons' Lodge at Sunderland, written by a gentleman of Hull. Having produced an admired specimen of sacred music, when the new church was to be consecrated at Sunderland, he was re . quested to compose the anthem, which was performed by the then excellent Durham choir to an immense congregation. At Scarborough, in the fashionable Spa season, he was the occasional leader of the Concerts, and the constant one in the orchestra of the theatre, for which he composed many songs, written by the late ingenious pastoral poet Cunningham, who was an actor in Bates's company at that period. At one of the concerts, he was importuned by the eminent professors, Fischer and Borghi, to fill a vacant seat in tlie orchestra of the Italian Opera-house, which gratifying offer was most readily accepted ; and that great mu- sical general, Giardini, placed him in the rank of the second violins. But the following season, the late excellent leader, Mr. Cramer, removed him to the principal viola, at which post he remained eighteen years, in the course of which time he produced upwards of twenty operas for Colman's and for Covent-garden Thea- tre. Of the latter he became the musical director, and was also appointed one of the musicians in ordinary to his majesty. His engagements comprised Bach and Abel's Concerts, the Professional Concerts, the Lady's Friday Concert, the grand Sunday Concerts, and the Wednesday Concert of Ancient Music; from vol. i. 2 X"], [306, "CHESTER WARD\u2014 W. D. 170 Low-Hand Quarter includes that pleasant country on the west of the Team to the borders of Lamesley chapelry, and also Dunston Hill, with that fine level carse north of Whickham, and which forms part of the fertile vale of Tyne. the latter of which he withdrew, as the necessary attendance at the Monday's rehearsal interfered with his theatrical duty : but Lord Sandwich, who was the influential friend of Mr. Harris and Joah Bates, com manded his return to a duty which he always performed with profitable pleasure, and at last relinquished with great regret. In the year 1790, while on a visit at Tarlow, Shield had the good fortune to make the acquaintance of the greatest of instrumental composers, Haydn ; and he afterwards declared that he gained more important information by four days' communion with that founder of a style which has given fame to so many imitators, than ever he did by the best-directed studies in any four years of any part of his life. In the summer of 1791, Mr. Shield paid a visit to his native village, where his aged parent was still living, and over whom he watched with a solicitude which furnishes one delightful proof, among many that might be adduced, of the excellence of his heart. He took advantage of this occasion to collect several of the airs that are still traditionally sung in the counties of Durham, Northumberland, and Cumberland, which, he said, in his infancy he was taught to play and sing, and were then known by the appellation of Border tunes. Several of them he has introduced in his \" Rudiments of Thorough Bass,\" (pp. 35 \u2014 38.) \" These hitherto neglected flights of fancy,\" says he, \"may serve to augment the collector's stock of printed rarities, and may, perhaps, prove conspicuous figures in the group of national melodies.\" He had long been upon terms of intimacy with the eccentric critic and editor, Joseph Ritson, who was a native of the same county. In the autumn of 1791, Mr. Ritson invited our composer to accompany him to Paris; a proposi tion which was accepted. In that city he formed acquaintance with several foreign composers, as well as countrymen of his own. Many of these being anxious, like himself, to improve their musical taste in the native land of song, a party was made to Italy ; and Turin, Milan, Bologna, Piacenza, Parma, Lodi, Mo dena, Florence, Sienna, and Rome, were visited in turn. At the latter place, he was induced to take up his residence for a time, in order to profit by the friendship and example of some of the great masters of that capital, and to obtain a more perfect insight into Italian music. He returned to England in 1792, and renewed his engagement at Covent Garden ; but a difference arising between him and Mr. Harris, he relin quished his situation, and devoted himself to other musical pursuits. Soon after this period, he published his well known \" Introduction to Harmony.\" At the death of Sir William Parsons, in 1817, his Majesty George IV. most graciously appointed him master of his musicians in ordinary. Of the merits of Shield as a composer, we cannot more justly speak than in the words of the Quarterly Musical Review : \u2014 \"Late as he appeared, he struck out for himself a style of writing, pure, chaste, and original. His great prominent characteristic, however, is simplicity. No composer has ever woven so few notes into such sweet and im pressive melodies, while the construction of the bass and harmony is alike natural, easy, and unaffected. We cannot open one of his operas without being instantly captivated with this quality of his music. In such delightful entertainments as Marian and Rosina, his airs breathe all the freshness and purity and beauty of rural life, though the more ornamented and difficult parts are carried far beyond the common style of bravura. Shield appears to have been singularly fortunate in the great compass and agility of the female singers for whom he wrote his airs of execution. Perhaps no writer is so remarkable for songs con taining so much that is strictly national. After Purcell, we consider Shield to be the finest and most per fect example of really English writers. Ballads, in all the different modes of sentiment and description, abound in his operas. Sea and hunting songs, the rural ditty, the convivial song and glee, the sweet senti mental ballad, are so frequent, that indeed, with the occasional interposition of songs of execution, they may be said to make up the customary and continual alternations from air to air. As much of Mr. Shield's music will descend to posterity, carrying with it the intrinsic marks of English genius, as of any other writer since the days of Arne. As a whole, we have found nothing superior to Rosina. His works are very nu merous, though in many of his pieces he has availed himself, with felicity, of popular airs, and of selections from Handel and foreign composers.\" The titles of Shield's published works are as follows: \u2014 \"An Introduction to Harmony,\" \"A Cento,\" \" Six Canzonets,\" \" Two Sets of Trios for a Violin, Tenor, and Violoncello.\" Dramatic pieces: \u2014 \"Flitch of Bacon ;\" the words were written by the late Sir Henry Bate Dudley, being his first dramatic attempt. \"Rosina,\" \"Poor Soldier,\" \"Marian,\" \"Farmer,\" \"Hartford Bridge,\" \"Woodman,\" \"Robin Hood,\" \" Abroad and at Home,\" \" Fontainbleau,\" \" Noble Peasant,\" \" Crusade,\" \" The Travellers in Switzerland,\" \"Omai,\" \"Lord Mayor's Day,\" \" Picture of Paris,\" the major part of \" Oscar and Malvina,\" \"Lock and Key,\" \" Patrick in Prussia,\" \" Choleric Fathers,\" \" Netley Abbey,\" \" Two Faces under a Hood,\" &c. &c"], [307, "WHICKHAM. 171 Farnacres is a neat modern mansion, with pleasure grounds tastefully laid out, and stands about half a mile north-east from Ravensworth.* The manor of Farnacres, by Boldon Book, was held by Eudo de Lucels, by the tenth part of a knight's service ; and, in 1338, was in the posses sion of a family who assumed the local name. By Hatfield's Survey, it was held by Robert de Umfravill, by knight's service and 2s. rent. William Bultflour also held a messuage and 28 acres by charter, under 16s. rent. In 1429, Sir Robert Umfrevill, Knight of the Garter, founded the chantry of Farnacres, \" which he endowed with the whole vill and manor of Farnacres, with a set of statutes, of which the principal injunctions are, that the chaplains shall sing according to the use of Sarum, and shall celebrate regularly vespers, matins, and all canonical hours ; and on the day of the founder's obit, Placebo, Dirige, and Mass, ' cum nota sicut corpora nostra ibidem pre- Single pieces which remain popular : \u2014 \" Shakspeare's Loadstars,\" \" The Thorn,\" \" The Bud of the Rose,\" \" O bring me Wine,\" \" The Wolf,\" \" The Heaving of the Lead,\" \" The Post Captain,\" \" Old Towler,\" \"The Streamlet,\" \"The Ploughboy,\" \"Let Fame sound her Trumpet,\" \"The pretty little Heart,\" \"How shall we Mortals,\" \" Village Maids,\" \" Ah, well-a-day, my poor Heart,\" \" The Battle Song,\" \" I've tra versed Judah's barren Sands,\" \" 'Tis no Harm to know it, ye know,\" \"Heigho!'' \"Tom Moody,\" \"Poor Barbara,\" \" The Literary Fund Glee,\" \" Johnny and Mary,\" better known by its beginning, \" Down the Burn and through the Mead,\" the words of which were furnished by the late Mr. Holcroft ; although this ballad has been frequently inserted in the collections of inaccurate editors, in the class of original Scottish songs. \"The Prince and Old England for ever,\" \"Our Laws, Constitution, and King,\" \"Oxfordshire Nancy bewitched !\" composed at the request of Mr. Garrick, after that monarch of the histrionic art had ceased to be the greatest ornament of the British stage. Mr. Shield died at his house in Berners Street, London, on the 25th of January, 1829, aged upwards of 80. He has left a widow, whose character is thus given in one of his letters : \u2014 \" I ought to be the happiest of mortals at home, as Mrs. Shield is one of the best women in the world, and it is by her good management that I have been able to assist my mother, who laboured hard, after the death of my father, to give her four children a decent education. This power of contributing to her support I consider as one of the greatest blessings that heaven has bestowed upon me.\" There is in Mr. Shield's will a legacy deserving of notice. In terms highly respectful and proper, he bequeaths his fine viola, or tenor violin, to the late king, humbly entreating his majesty to accept it as a testimony of his gratitude. This being communicated through Sir Frederick Watson, by the testator's executor, Thomas Broadwood, Esq., the king was pleased to signify, in the kindest and most condescending terms, his acceptance of the legacy ; but at the same time directed that the utmost value should be set upon the instrument by competent judges, it being his majesty's determination that Mr. Shield's widow should be no sufferer by a bequest which so strongly proved the attachment and gratitude of his late faithful servant. Mr. Shield was endowed by nature with a lively imagination, and a strong inquiring mind. Though his early education had been rather neglected, his thirst for knowledge led to exertions which enabled him to teach himself much more than, in all probability, he would have learned in the time-wasting routine of a grammar-school. He devoted all his spare hours to reading, and well digested what he read: added to which, he lived during the greater part of his life much with men of letters, whose society was his delight, and to whose conversation he was indebted for a large portion of that cultivation which all who knew him, and could appreciate his acquirements, readily acknowledged. His moral character stood unimpeached \u2014 Detraction herself never ventured to assail it. He had, in fact, no enemy ; for such were the uprightness of his conduct and the sweetness of his temper, that he won the confidence of honest men, awed without offending less scrupulous persons, and appeased the most irascible and vehement. Among other proofs of his honourable feeling, it is stated by Mr. Reynolds, in his \" Life and Times,\" that when he presented him, by Mr. Harris's desire, with one hundred guineas, as part payment for composing an opera which had proved unsuccessful, Shield rejected the offer, saying, \" I thank Mr. Harris, but I cannot receive money which I feel I have not earned.\" * The old, large, spreading trees, in the adjoining park of Ravensworth, have been already noticed.

Dat. at Farneacres, 26 Aug. 1429.\" In order to secure this pious foundation, its aged founder afterwards executed a charter, by which he gave the perpetual advowson to Cardinal Langley and his successors in the see of Dur ham. In 1439, Bishop Nevill united the hospital of Frereside to the chantry of Farnacres. The last appointment of a chaplain to the united foundation occurs in 1538, In 1553, Robert Claxton, the chaplain, received a pension of \u00a35 ; and, soon after, the general dissolution of chantries took place. Farnacres was first granted by the crown to Alexander Pringle, after whose death it was conveyed to Urias Babington. On his death in 1605, an inquest was held, when it appeared that the deceased had held Farnacres and other lands merely on trust for Thomas Liddell, Esq. When the line of Liddell of Farnacres was extinguished, the estate was purchased by the elder branch of Liddell of Ravensworth, in whose possession it has since rested. In 1679, the rental of Farnacres amounted to \u00a3'354, 4s. 6d. ; and the colliery, at 12s. per tenn of coals, to _\u00a3?80. The land is tithe-free. The house was occupied by the Hon. H. T. Liddell until 1826, when he re moved to his mansion at Eslington, co, Northumberland. It is at present the residence of John Barras, Esq. Fuger House, according to Hatfield's Survey, was one of the free tenancies of the manor of Wrhickham, and gave name to a family. Roger Thornton died in 1451, seized of the waste called Fugerfield, containing 80 acres, each acre worth 2d. per annum, and held of the bishop by 10s. rent. Elizabeth, the daughter of Roger Thornton the younger, carried the estate into the Lumley family. It is now united to Ravensworth estate, which it adjoins on the north-west. Dunston Hall is a spacious, modern house, beautifully seated on the declivity of the hill to the east of Whickham. Dunston was formerly the property of the Shaftoes, but was purchased, up wards of a century ago, by Ralph Carr, Esq., grandfather of John Carr, Esq., chairman of the"], [309, "WHICKHAM. 173 quarter sessions for the county of Northumberland. He married Hannah, daughter of Henry- Ellison, of Hebburn, Esq., and is succeeded by his son, Ralph Carr, Esq. Cowheel is a hamlet at the foot of Dunston Hill, containing a farmhold, two public houses, and a blacksmith's shop. On the edge of the hill are two very neat cottages. Dunston is a populous village in Low-Hand township. It stretches from the river Team west ward along the margin of the Tyne for upwards of half a mile. The scite seems to have been mostly gained from the river Tyne, and is therefore called \" the Bishop's Waste.\" The houses, which are built with surprising irregularity, have mostly gardens attached to them. There are two or three neat and convenient houses, occupied by agents concerned in the coal works ; but most of the cottages are inhabited by keelmen. Here are staiths from which coals are put into keels from Pontop, Tanfield Moor, Norwood, and other collieries ; also two large timber-yards and store houses belonging to these works. Mr. Henry Winlo's large saw-mill, worked by steam ; a candle manufactory, belonging to Harrison, Cuthbert, and Co. ; a coal-waggon wright ; and a keel builder, are amongst the useful concerns in this place, which contains also four public houses. On the gable-end of a large and commodious school-room is a stone with the following inscrip tion: \u2014 \"Erected by Subscription Anno Domini 1818. The Hon. and Rev. Edward Grey, Rec tor.\" The rector subscribed \u00a35; the principal subscribers being the bishop of Durham, the trustees of Lord Crewe's charity, and some of the gentlemen connected with the village. The master, Joseph Ferguson, was bound to contribute towards the building all that each scholar paid above 3d. a week ; and the poor man, under this strange agreement, has actually paid up wards of _P39 ! The school is at present in a very unprosperous state. Dunston Lodge stands a short distance from the village. It is the property of General Marley, and is at present occupied by Mr. John E.

The buildings are black and unseemly, and very irregularly disposed of; but the numerous work-shops are extremely convenient. The river Darwent is na vigable as far as the works of Messrs.

John Barnet, curate of Whickham, husband of his niece. On Mr. Barnet 's death in 1828, the property devolved to his son, the Rev. John Barnet, curate of St. Nicholas', in Newcastle ; on whose death, which happened soon after, it was supposed that the estate would return to the Marley family, of which General Marley was the heir. But John Barnet, a clerk in his majesty's customs, and a relation of the Barnets, produced a codicil to old Barnet's will, in virtue of which he took possession of the property. Being charged with forging this document, he was tried for the offence at the spring assizes at Durham, February 26, 1830, and acquitted ; but the codicil being admitted to be a forgery, the property of course devolved to General Marley, who is serving in India. vol. 1\u2014 9. 2 Y"], [310, "CHESTER WARD\u2014 W.

There are other manufacturers on a less scale: William Spencer is a nail, chain, spade, and shovel maker; White and Hodo-son, nail and chain manufacturers ; and Thomas Summerside, a nail maker. Here are two water corn-mills, and a new corn steam-mill ; a large brewery and malting, belonging to Messrs. William Taylor and Co. ; and fourteen public houses. The Ebenezer Chapel, built in 1750, belongs to the Presbyterians. Another neat modern chapel was built by the Wesleyan Methodists. There is a day-school here for boys, and another for girls. A Masonic Lodge has long been established here. A Hopping is held in the village annually on Whit-Monday. The following notice, dated May 22, 1758, shews the nature of the village sports at that period : \u2014 \" On this day, the annual diversions at SwalweU will take place, which will consist of dancing for ribands, grin ning for tobacco, women running for smocks, ass races, foot courses by men, with an odd whim of a man eating a cock alive, feathers, entrails, and all,\" &c. &c.

It is difficult to convey any adequate idea of the beautiful and magnificent scenery of this place. The visitor enters these enchanting grounds by a serpentine road, which, for upwards of a mile, winds through the bosom of a thick forest ; sometimes on the brink of a deep ravine, and at intervals descending on the easy inclination of the hill, but still embowered with venerable oaks. On issuing from this forest road, the Banquetting House appears, seated upon a noble elevation, at the termination of a spacious ave nue. This erection is in the florid Gothic style, garnished with pinnacles. After passing a beau tiful piece of water, a delightful landscape bursts upon the view. To the right rises a noble sylvan scene of great extent, hanging on inclining grounds from a lofty summit to the very skirts of the vale. Rising over the woods, as a terminating object to the grand vista, appears a fine Doric stone pillar, one hundred and forty feet in height, surmounted by a colossal figure (the height twelve feet) of British Liberty. Turning to the left, and looking westward, you behold a broad walk or terrace, which, at the distance of a mile, leads to a handsome chapel, with a rich portico and dome, highly embellished, intended by George Bowes, Esq., for a chapel and mausoleum.* The hall is delightfully seated on the Darwent, in a retired situation. On the north is a terrace, which only intervenes betwixt the back part of the house and the steep descent into the Lady * The late earl completed this structure as a place of worship, and endowed the donative of Gibside with a farm of land, worth nearly \u00a3100, at Laydonfield in Ravensworth, and \u00a31500 three per cent, stock, vested in trustees, partly for building a residence for the minister. A plot of ground is enclosed for a burial-place. The chapel was consecrated by the bishop of Durham 30th July, 1812. The Rev. James Blackburn, A. M. vicar of Gainford, was the first chaplain.

Across the river, cultivated lands, sloping gently to the water, and variegated with a lofty cliff, irregular swells, enclosures, and scattered woodland, forms a fine, bright contrast to the deep forest masses that almost darken the southern bank. The few artificial objects which are interspersed through the sylvan beauties of this magnificent landscape, are yet sufficiently grand and distinct not to disgrace the noble scenery that surrounds them. The green-house, bath, and other buildings, are executed in good taste, and some of them in a superb style. The gardens are spacious and well situated ; and the vinery and hot-beds are now undergoing a thorough repair. The park is four miles in circumference. The whole scene is rendered more striking from the bleak country that surrounds this chosen spot. Bryan's Leap is admitted to be the best situation for obtaining a bird-eye view of the whole. The mansion-house displays that style of architecture that prevailed about the commencement of the seventeenth century. Nearly the whole of the south front was rebuilt by its late noble proprietor, with a strict regard to its original form, being embattled, with deep bay windows divided by stone mullions and transoms. Over the entrance-porch are the royal arms of James I. within the garter, and beneath those of Blakiston quartering Marley; W[illiam] and I[ane] B[lakiston], April 12, 1620.

Terms of Samson and Hercules support a huge mantle-piece, above which are the arms of the founder of the mansion, Sir William Blakiston, in the reign of James. The house contains some excellent paintings. In the drawing-room is a large piece of Rubens' wife, whilst pregnant, in a fruit-shop : the expression, which is inimitable, is rivalled by the cu riosity of an old woman she is addressing. The collection of fruit is infinite. A monkey is climb ing up and oversetting a basket of peaches. This piece cost George Bowes, Esq., 1500 guineas. A Poulterer's Shop, with dead Game, is also an invaluable painting. The game and a fine rough greyhound are by Synders, the two human figures by Rubens. Amongst the other pieces merit ing notice are, Rachel at the Well, by Sebastian Ricca ; the Rape of the Sabines, said to be by Poussin ; and an interesting group by Watteau, a pretty girl in a hoop dancing, Cupid crowning her with a chaplet of flowers, and boys and girls looking on. There are several highly finished family portraits. Sir Martin Bowes, a descendant of Bowes of Yoik, Speaker of the House of Commons, and Lord Mayor of London, 1545, is represented in a black furred gown, a glove in the left hand, a staff in the right. On the frame is inscribed, \" The Gift of the Right Honourable Arthur Onslow, Esq., Speaker of the House of Commons.\" A portrait, with a stern countenance, pale, dark complexion, and brown bushy beard, black velvet cap, ruff, and dark dress, the hand on the pommel of the sword, arms of Bowes, anno 1572, \u00e6tat 45.

Gibside and Marley Hill were the ancient estates of the Marleys, held of the see of Durham, in the time of Bishop Bury, by homage, fealty, suit of court, and one mark exchequer rent.

At this time, he married Hannah, daughter and heiress of William Newton, Esq., of Burnopfield; and his regiment being shortly after disbanded, he took up his residence at Cold-Pig Hill, the seat of his wife's ancestors. Mrs. Stoney was an amiable woman, and is said to have been cruelly used by her husband ; but she soon died without issue. When the Earl of Strathmore died at Lisbon, the countess was left exposed to all the arts of designing men, She was then less than 30 years osage, with an uncommonly fine person, an exquisite complexion, and the most graceful manners. She was kind, generous, and affectionate, and possessed talents of the highest order. En dowed with a fine taste for poetic composition, she wrote a dramatic performance, of five acts, called \"The Siege of Jerusalem.\" Being a patroness of the arts, an accomplished botanist, and a successful student in various languages, her splendid house in Grosvenor Square was the resort of men of distinguished talents. She built extensive conservatories at Upper Chelsea, and brought exotics from the Cape and various other countries, so as to form an invaluable collection. While engaged in these laudable pursuits, she was fre cjuently visited by Mr, Grey, a gentleman from India; but Mr. Stoijey was determined to bear off th\u00a9"], [313, "WHICKHAM. 177 John, tenth Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorn, was enrolled among the peers of the Cnited Kingdom by the title of Baron Bowes, of Streatlam Castle, on the 18th July, 1815. His lordship, on Sunday, July 30, 1820, married Miss Mary Milner, of Staindrop, in the co. of Durham, and prize, and commenced his attack with the most consummate art. The countess was constantly abused and vilified, attacked and defended, in the Morning Post ; and Mr. Stoney, as the lady's champion, challenged and fought the editor, the Rev. Henry Bate, afterwards Sir Henry Bate Dudley. On the 17th January, 1777, only four days after this duel, the grateful countess married Mr. Stoney, who soon after assumed the name of Bowes, by his majesty's pleasure. The month following his marriage, Mr. Bowes offered himself a candidate to succeed Sir Walter Blackett as one of the representatives for Newcastle. His oppo nent, Sir John Trevelyan, Bart., polled 1163, and Mr. Bowes 1068 votes. Mr. Bowes lodged a petition, which accused Sir J. Trevelyan of bribery ; but no proof that was thought sufficient having been produced, the election of the latter was declared valid by a committee of the House of Commons. Mr. Bowes took the house at Hammersmith which the Margravine of Anspach had just left, and which has since been distinguished as the residence of the late Queen Caroline. Soon after, he and the countess arrived at Gibside. He now purchased Benwell estate from the Shaftoe family, and, in 1780, served the office of high sheriff of the county of Northumberland. This year, he was more successful in his electioneer ing attempts, being, on September 21, returned member for Newcastle by 1135 votes. Mr. Delaval peti tioned against him ; but nothing was done in the business. At this time, Gibside was the scene of feasting and extravagance ; but the expenses of Bowes's shrievalty, his election contests, his horse-racing, his insur ances, and his purchase of Benwell, compelled him to retreat, in 1793, to Paul's Warden, the seat of Mrs. Bowes, his mother-in-law. The countess, about this time, was delivered of a son; and Air. Bowes affected much solicitude for her health. Having taken a furnished house in Grosvenor Square, they removed to London. Mr. Bowes now commenced a series of stratagems to obtain possession of the countess's two daughters, who were wards in Chancery ; and he did actually fly to Paris with Lady Anna-Maria, under the specious plea of adding to the comforts of a delicate and tender mother. In November, 1784, the Court of Chancery proceeded in this business; and on the 7th February, 1785, the countess, by an effort, escaped from her artful and cruel husband, and exhibited articles of the peace against him in the Court of King's Bench. Previous to the trial, which terminated most decisively in favour of her ladyship, she was in a very discon- solate state ; and she continued to live under the protection of a civil officer of high respectability. But Bowes still did not despair ; and, by a deep-laid conspiracy, he obtained possession of her ladyship's person, and carried her down to Streatlam Castle. Here he endeavoured to persuade her to sign a paper, to stop proceedings in the ecclesiastical court, and to consent to live under the name and character of his wife ; but though subjected to the most cruel, brutal, and shocking usage, the countess firmly refused compliance. Being pursued, Bowes escaped from Streatlam, carrying her ladyship along with him, to Darlington. From this place he was traced and taken ; when the countess, with a constable, proceeded to London, after twelve days absence. On the 27th May, 1787, Mr. Bowes and eight of his accomplices were tried in the Court of King's Bench, found guilty of a conspiracy, and received sentence of various degrees of punishment. Mr. Bowes was adjudged to pay a fine of \u00a3300 to his majesty, to be imprisoned in his majesty's prison of the King's Bench for three years, and, at the expiration of the said term, to find security for fourteen years, himself in \u00a310,000 and two sureties of \u00a35000 each. Soon after Bowes was married to the countess, he discovered that she had contrived and signed a deed, which was dated one week before the ceremony took place, whereby she made a settlement of the estates which had been willed to her by her father, so as to place the rents and produce of those estates at her own disposal, whether she should be single or married, reserving to herself a power to revoke and annul this deed. Bowes, it seems, was not very gentle in the mode which he adopted to get rid of this settlement. Be that as it may, the Countess of Strathmore, by an instrument under her hand and seal, bearing date the 1st of May, 1777, rather less than four months after the marriage, revoked the obnoxious settlement. At the time of her marriage, she was considerably in debt, and joined Bowes in a deed, granting annuities to the yearly amount of \u00a33000 for the countess's life. Bv this measure was raised a sum of \u00a324,000. In order to secure the payment of those annuities, certain parts of the estates, in which the countess had a life inte rest, were vested in trustees, in trust to receive the rents, and out of the rents to pay the annuities, and to pay the overplus and residue, if any, to Bowes and the countess. In the year 1785, the countess instituted a suit in the Court of Chancery against Bowes, charging him with various acts of cruelty and outrage, setting forth that the instrument of revocation was extorted from vol. i. 2 Z"], [314, "178 CHESTER WARD\u2014 W. D. died on the day after the nuptial ceremony, in the 52d year of his age. His estates were not en. tailed, and he made a full settlement of his property previous to his decease. The English barony expired at his death ; and a doubt arose whether a marriage in England, subsequent to the birth of a child, would legitimatize that child in Scotland. The question was determined in the nega tive; and the Scottish peerage devolved upon his lordship's brother, the Hon. Thomas-Lyon Bowes, who became Earl of Strathmore, Viscount Lyon, and Baron Glamis, Tannadyer, Scidlaw, and Stradichtie. The dowager Countess of Strathmore, who has always conducted herself with good sense and strict propriety, was married, at St. George's, Hanover Square, London, on 16th March, 1831, to her by violence and compulsion, and praying the court to restrain Bowes from receiving the rents of her estates. The cause was tried in the Court of Common Pleas, before Lord Rosslyn ; and the consequence of the verdict was, that the instrument of revocation was deemed a nullity, and it was referred to a Master in Chancery to take an account of rents received by Bowes since the commencement of the suit, upon which account a large sum was reported due by the Master, and he appointed a person to be the receiver of the rents and profits of the estates of tlie countess. \"As soon as the event of this trial found its way to Bowes, for the first time, perhaps, in his whole life, he began to sink into the most complete state of despondency. Every faculty seemed to have deserted him, but his deception. He pretended lameness, and took to his bed, saw scarcely any body, and kept himself in a constant state of intoxication. Another deadly blow followed also. The sentence of separation and di vorce now issued from Doctors Commons, and he was stunned with the thunder of excommunication. He was charged with the sums he had unjustly received from these estates, and they were entered on the mar shal's books. Thus mauled, stripped, disgraced, and blasted, the prison bolts flew open ; all of a sudden he bade adieu to the outer state-rooms, and entered within the walls, in a pickle not unmerited, and in a state which, to some, death would have been comparatively an Elysium.\" About the year 1797, Bowes commenced a suit in the Court of Chancery, claiming the surplus rents of the estates set apart to pay the annuities, to which the countess put in no answer. He then applied to the House of Lords, whose decision was in his favour. Elated by this, he recurred again to the Court of Chan cery, under the expectation that he was certain of success, to the amount of, at least, \u00a360.000. The coun tess died 20th April, 1800; when Bowes moved out of prison, and took a house in the London Road, in St. George's Fields. The law-suits continued to proceed; but in June, 1807, 'he deed of revocation was brought before Sir James Mansfield, and a verdict was found in favour of the Earl of Strathmore. Here Bowes' contentions terminated; and on 16th January, 1810, his toils, his schemes, and his anxieties, were closed by death. He left legacies to his five children by a young lady v-ihom he had seduced in pri son, and who had suffered patiently the most incredible privations for upwards of 20 years, from the jea lousy, meanness, and violence of her children's father. His son by the countess had a place in the navy, and died in his father's life-time. The life of this singular man was written by his surgeon, Mr. Jesse Foote, whose narrative a writer in the Gentleman's Magazine contends is greatly exaggerated, but he produces no proof in contradiction of the facts stated, stir. Foote describes Bowes thus : \u2014 \" His person was rather in his favour, and his address was probably, when young, captivating. His speech was soft, his height more than five feet ten, his eyes were bright and small, he had a perfect command over them, his eyebrows were low, large, and sandy, his hair light, and his complexion muddy ; his smile was agreeable, his wit ready, but he was always the first to laugh at what he said, which forced others to laugh also. His conversation was shallow, his education was bare, and his utterance was in a low tone and lisping. There was something uncommon in the connexion of his nose with his upper lip ; he never could talk without the nose, which was long and curved downwards being also moved ridiculously with the upper lip.\" Another writer describes Bowes as possessing the most fascinating manners, and as being witty, hospitable, and convivial, and a most pleasant table companion. He lived on terms of great intimacy and friendship with the late Duke of Norfolk, and Mr. Lee, the famous lawyer, for some time attorney-general ; and, in early life, he was respected by both the Scotts, one of whom is now the Ex-lord Chancellor, and the other Lord Stowell. That Bowes, even in latter times, retained some opulent friends is certain, or he never could have obtained security to the amount of \u00a314,000 for the privilege of the Rules of the King's Bench prison. He had a sister, who married the Honourable Arthur Moore, judge of the Common Pleas in Ireland."], [315, "WHICKHAM. 179 William Hutt, Esq.

This transaction is stated to have taken place in 1312. In 1374, the Hardings appear seated at Beadnel in Northumberland. 48 Edward III., Alan de Strother appoints Adam Harding of Beadnel his attorney, to deliver possession to Samson Harding of his free tenement at Beadnel. 16 June, 8 Henry VII., 1493, Richard Harding, of Holyngside, Esq., granted an annuity of 40s. 4d. to William Baxter, out of his lands in Beadnel and Boroden, and out of the tenement in Burton chare, belonging to St. Eloy's chantry, in All Saints' church, in Newcastle. John Harding, who belonged to the Beadnel family, was born in 1378. At the age of 12, he was admit- ted into the family of Sir Henry Percy, eldest son to the Earl of Northumberland, familiarly known by the name of Harry Hotspur, on account of his impatient spirit. He was one of the most esteemed warriors of his time, active and enterprising, had a large vassalry, numerous partizans, and unlimited authority. His household, as Lord of the East March of England, was constantly held at Berwick upon Tweed. Harding, it appears, was with his patron, as a volunteer, in the battles of Homilden and Cokelaw. After the death of Percy, he enlisted under the banners of Sir Robert Umfraville, with whom he had fought at Homilden, and who was connected with the Percys by the ties of affinity as well as those of arms. In 1405, when King Henry IV. reduced the fortresses of Lord Bardolph and the Earl of Northumberland, Sir Robert Umfraville's services in the expedition were rewarded with the castle of Warkworth, under whom Harding became the constable. How long he remained at Warkworth does not appear ; but his knowledge of Scot- tish geography seems soon to have engaged him in the secret service of his country. In 1415, we find him attendant on the king at Harfleur ; and his journal of the march which preceded the memorable battle of Agincourt forms one of the most curious passages among the additions to the late reprint of his Chronicle. In 1416, he appears to have accompanied the Duke of Bedford to the sea-fight at the mouth of the Seine. In 1424, he was at Rome, and employed partly in inspecting \"the great Chronicle of Trogus Pompeius ;\" but, soon after, he was again employed in collecting documents for ascertaining the fealty due from the Scottish kings, which seems to have been attended with some personal danger. He has even been accused of forging deeds to answer his royal master's purpose ; but the truth of this charge cannot now be ascertained. Actively as Harding was engaged in public life, he found time to gather materials for his \" Chronicle,\" and appears to have finished the first composition of it toward the latter end ofthe minority of King Henry VI. The Lansdowne manuscript closes with the life of Sir Robert Umfraville, who died, according to Dug- dale, January 27, 1436, and under whom Harding appears to have lived in his latter years as constable of Kyme Castle in Lincolnshire. Of the rewards which he received for his services, we find only a grant for life of \u00a310 per annum out of the manor or alien preceptory of Wyloughten, in the county of Lincoln, in the 18th year of Henry VI ; and, in 1457, he had a pension of \u00a320 a year for life by letters patent, charged upon the revenues of the county of Lincoln. During his latter days, he appears to have recomposed his \" Chronicle\" for Richard Duke of York, father to King Edward IV., who was slain in the battle of Wake- field, December 31, 1460. It was afterwards presented to King Edward IV. himself. The history comes no lower than the flight of Henry VI. to Scotland ; but from \" the excusacion\" touching his \" defauhes,\" in which the queen is mentioned, it is evident that Harding could not have finished his work before 1465. How long he survived its completion is unknown ; but he must then have been at least 87 years of age. His \" Chronicle of England unto the Reign of King Edward IV.\" is in verse, and as a metrical composition is beneath criticism, but, as a record of facts, is highly interesting to the English historian and antiquary. It was first printed by Grafton in 1543, with a continuation by the same, to the 34th year of Henry VIII. A valuable edition was published .by the booksellers of London in 1812, with a biographical and literary preface by Henry Ellis, Esq."], [316, "CHESTER WARD\u2014 W. D. 180 beginning of the 17th century, his descendants were falling into poverty and mortgage. In 1621, Ralph Harding, Gent, (on whose estate Katherine Radclyffe, a rich spinster, of Mulgrave Castle, held a mortal grasp) settled his lands, Hollingside, Ridinghouse, and Riding field, on his kinsman and male heir, Robert Harding, of Whickham, who undertook to satisfy the debts, and provide for the maintenance of two aged sisters of the settler ; but whether it were owing to the heavy incumbrance of the spinster, or to that general species of mismanagement which almost invariably ur_j_s on the fate of a loaded and embarrassed property in the hands of ancient gentry, from this time the ' after voyage' of the Hardings ' was full of shallows and of miseries ; the family was scattered, not extinguished ; and the estate fell, about 1730, to the family of Bowes, by foreclosure of mortgage and subsequent conveyance, and is now united to the Gibside estate.\" Clockhum Mill is turned by a little rivulet called Dene Burn. Clockburn Lane is a deep, narrow road, leading through the ravine on the east of Hollinside. It is pointed out as the track by which Cromwell marched with his artillery to cross the Darwent at Winlaton ford, on his northern route in 1650. Fellside, a hamlet, stands a short distance east of Gibside Park. It contains one public house, one farmhold, and a few cottages occupied by mechanics and labourers. The late Earl of Strath more bequeathed an endowment of .PIO to the school, and a school-room with a dwelling-house for the master.* Sunnyside is another hamlet in Fellside constablery, a little further eastward, and near the Shotley Bridge road. Marley Hill, which lies to the south of Gibside, gave name to a resident family so early as the year 1200, and continued in the family until about 1539, when it became by marriage the pro perty of the Blakistons of Coxhow. Here is the residence of Ralph Fenwick, land-agent to the executors of the late Earl of Strathmore. Bird-Hill, which lies west of Fellside, is the residence of Lady Anna-Maria Jessop, and is a very neat and convenient house. PARISH OF RYTON. Ryton parish is bounded on the north and north-east by the river Tyne till its junction with the Darwent, which divides Ryton from Whickham, and from the chapelries of Tanfield and Me domsley on the south-east and east, till the junction of the Milkwell Burn and Darwent on the south-west. The Milkwell Burn, a short imaginary line, and the Stanley Burn, flowing north wards and falling into the Tyne near Bradley Mill, complete the western boundary. The parish, which forms almost a triangle, is subdivided into six constableries: 1. Ryton; 2. Ryton Wood side ; 3. Crawcrook (including Bradley) ; 4. Stella ; 5. Winlaton (including Bladon, Thornley, the Spen, Whitehouse, and other tenements, parcels of the lordship of Winlaton) ; 6, Chopwell (which includes Black Hall, Milkwell Burn, Ravenside, Armondside, Hukergate, and other tene ments). Coal and iron stone are found in the parish, and there is a sulphur-spring at Axwell Park. In 1821, the whole parish contained 1022 houses and 5763 inhabitants. The amount of * His lordship distributed annually, on New-year's Day, an ox and a proportionate quantity of bread to the poor."], [317, "RYTON 181 poor-rates in 1829 was, in Ryton township, \u00a3'208, 14s. ; in Ryton Woodside, \u00a3?409, 3s. ; in Stella, \u00a3'218, 18s. ; and in Winlaton township, _\u00a3?2761, 19s. : and the value of property assessed to the county-rate in that year was \u00a3?11,880. Ryton. The name Ryton is derived from the British word Ry, meaning water, and seems to be applied to places seated in a \" wide watered vale.\" The manor of Ryton belongs to the see of Durham, under which the greater part of the lands there are held by lease or copy of court roll. Under Boldon Book, \"The men of Ryton hold the vill on lease, with the demesne, the assize rent, the mill and the service due (from the villains), with a stock of one draught and two harrows, and twenty chalder of oats of the bishop's measure, and the fisheries; they pay fourteen pounds rent, make ladings like the men of Whickham, and, jointly with Crawcrok, provide the carriage of one tun of wine. The Punder has five acres and the thraves like other Punders, and renders thirty hens and two hundred eggs. The villains pay twenty-four hens and two hundred eggs.\" Hatfield's Survey mentions three free tenements, held by the rector of Ryton, Thomas Gate gang, and John Stepyng. An inquisition was taken at Gateshead in 1344, stating, that from time beyond the memory of man there existed a fishery near Ryton called the Blaklough, to the west ward of Tyne Bridge, belonging to the bishop of Durham ; and another fishery called Cromwell, of which the third part belongs to the see ; and another fishery called Quikham Drawwater, be longing to the bishop ; and a yare called the Rutyare, with three heads, which also belonged to she see, and used to extend to the mid-water of Tyne ; another yare, of like extent, called Male yare, near the Redheugh, all west of Tyne Bridge; and on the east of the bridge was the Kirk yare, beneath the bishop's manor of Gateshead, extending to one third part of the water of Tyne ; a fishery called Toulershell, and a yare under Gateshead Park called Helperyare, to a third of Tyne water; and, lastly, a fishery called Turnwater under Freregose, belonging to the bishop. The common belonging to the manor of Ryton was extremely extensive, and its boundaries to_ wards ChopweU were the subject of litigation as early as 1562. A division of Ryton Moor bears date 16 Sept. 1638; the whole of the allotments are stated to be held of the see by copy of court roll, under 4d. an acre rent ; the mines are, of course, reserved to the see, with the usual clauses of compensation for damages to the tenant of the soil in working ; and 20 acres were allotted ta the manor mill, to provide horses for fetching in corn. Ryton, Broomfield, and High Hedgefield, were divided in 1669. The lands in Ryton called Greenside were included in the forfeiture of John Swinburn, of ChopweU, Esq., in 1570; and were granted by Bishop Barnes to Cuthbert Carnaby, Esq., by copy of court roll. The bishop granted other lands, betwixt Rickley-forde and Abbotford near Rickley Hill, to Robert Dodd. Ryton has frequently suffered from the visitations of the Scottish armies. In 1297, the village was burned by the Scots under Wallace, their famous champion ; while the English forces were dishonourably conducted. Here, in 1346, St. Cuthbert admonished King David in a vision, and thus \" meeting him as it were at his boundary fence, warned off the trespasser from his sacred pa trimony.\"* Ryton, in 1640, was the scene of panic and confusion when the Scottish troops forced the passage of the Tyne, * The details of this adventure are given in the General History of Durham 3 A T0X-. ?,"], [318, "182 CHESTER WARD\u2014 W. D. Ryton is a handsome village, pleasantly seated on the south bank of the Tyne, seven miles west of Newcastle. The prospect to the east and north is beautiful and interesting. Below is a wide and fertile vale, through which the Tyne flows broad and clear ; and in the distance, west and north, the scattered villages of Horsley, Heddon-on-the-Wall, Throckley, and Walbottle ; whilst in the view down this highly cultivated dale may be seen Benwell, the plantations above Fenham, and the heights of Newcastle Town Moor. The village is remarkably well built, and contains some excellent villas. Ryton House is the property and residence of Humble Lamb, Esq., whose father intermarried with the heiress of the Humble family. A very neat and commodious house, called Ryton Grove, on the sloping north side of the village, is occupied by William Boyd, Esq., of Newcastle ; and, on the opposite side, the Rev. Henry Wardell, M. A., who keeps a gentlemen's boarding school, has a good house, well adapted for a seminary. Mr. Barnabas Fenwick and Mr. John Burdis have each a neat villa. The latter was the property of the late Mrs. Hannah Hetherington. The village also contains four public houses, a ladies' boarding school conducted by Misses Chambers, a surgeon, several mechanics, and a Subscription School, built in 1791, and endowed with \u00a35 per annum by Lord Crewe's trustees. The Ryton Savings Bank is the oldest institution of the kind in England, and is a great benefit to the numerous bodies of forgemen, colliers, keelmen, and other industrious workmen, in this and the neighbouring villages. A Society for promoting Christian Knowledge was instituted some years ago. The Methodists have a licensed meeting-room here. A cross was erected in 1795, at which two hirings for servants are held annually on the Fridays before May 12 and November 22. Petty sessions are held here on the first Monday in every month, before one or more of the resident and neighbouring magistrates. The Church stands at the western extremity of the village, in a spacious cemetery, shaded by lofty elms. It is a handsome, regular edifice, consisting of a nave, chancel, and a west tower. The aisles, which are uniform, are formed by two pillars, supporting pointed arches, the groins of which are ornamented with sculptures of human heads. The western pillars are plain cylinders : those to the east are octagonal. The organ-gallery crosses the west end of the nave : formerly, it was much larger, and on the front was inscribed, \" This Gallery was erected at the Cost of Mr. Ambrose Crowley and the Company of Smiths at Winlaton.\" The north gallery extends to the east end of the nave ; but the gallery on the south is shorter. The pulpit is placed to the east end of the south row. The whole nave is well pewed, very clean, and warmed by a large stove. The west tower is square, springing from arches supported by heavy clustered pillars. In the space below the tower, and level with the nave, stands the font, a large, ancient, stone bason ; and, at the north side, a pulpit, where the funeral service is usually read. The tower, which contains three good bells, is surmounted by an octangular spire, covered with lead, and which rises to the height of one hundred and eight feet. The chancel is divided from the nave by a blunt-pointed arch, springing from corbels, and closed by a screen of old oak, carved in open tracery, roses, quatrefoils, and foliage ; and, as the chancel is raised by steps, the appearance of the altar from the extremity is striking and impres sive. The chancel is stalled on both sides with oak, on which a dolphin embowed inter three crosses are repeated, supposed to be the arms of Rector James. The east window, under a square label, has six lights, divided by a stone transom. There are five narrow lights, and one of two bghts, on the south side of the chancel. The lights in the aisles, and three which open westward"], [319, "RYTON 183 under the tower, are all modernized, single or double, under pointed arches of uniform architec ture. The chief entrance is by a south porch. The vestry, which consists of two apartments, projects from the north side 6f the chancel A small pointed door is closed up in the north aisle. The front of the south aisle was rebuilt in 1627- There are traces of a door on the south side of the chancel, with some mutilated ornaments. The highest ledge of the tower has also been adorned with grotesque heads, roses, lilies, and quatrefoils. On the east side of the tower, St. George appears in bas relief, trampling on a dragon. Monumental Inscriptions. \u2014 On the floor of the chancel, lies the recumbent effigy of a Benedic tine monk, carved in Stanhope marble. The hands elevated on the breast, and clasping a book, on the cover of which is the dove ; the feet rest on a lion.

His other successive preferments are recorded on his epitaph (of which Wood seems to have had good information). He was chaplain to the Earl of Bedford, then \" antesignanus\" amongst the noble favourers of Puritanism; and, as Wood adds, Francis Bunney himself was \"very zealous in the way he professed, a great admirer of Jo. Calvin, a constant preacher, charitable, and a stiff enemy to Popery.\" His works are, three tracts against Cardinal Bellarmin and Popery ; \" An Exposition of Romans iii. 28, on Justification by Faith,\" London, 1616, 4to. ; and \"Plain and familiar Exposition ofthe Ten Command ments,\" ibid. 1617, 8vo. He also wrote a commentary on the prophet Joel, being the substance of some sermons ; but, according to Wood, this was left in manuscript. \" He departed this mortal life at Ryton, 16 April, 161 7, and was buried in the chancel, near to the graves of 4 of his sons : over his grave was soon after set up, in a wall adjoyning, a table or plate of brass, whereon are engraven certain trite verses.\" Mr. Bunney left \u00a3100 to the university of Oxford, towards building the new schools; \u00a333 to Magdalen Col lege; and \u00a350 towards the repairs of Ryton church; which last sum his nephew, George Bunney of Newsham, seems to have disputed for in Ryton parish-books. \" For writing a letter to Mr. George Bunny, vid. 1619; 8 Feb. 1624, a suite ord'1 against George Bunny of Newsam, Gent, for \u00a350 given by Mr. Bunny the parson towards the repairing the church.\""], [320, "184 CHESTER WARD.\u2014 W.

Both the house and the grounds have been much improved by the present rector. At the Parsonage, several Roman antiquities, brought from the Wall, and described by Brand, are carefully preserved. The house was chiefly built by Dr. Finney. In 1314, Bishop Kellaw pronounced a decree betwixt the hospital of Kepyer and the rector of Ryton, viz. that Hugh de Montalt, master of Kepyer, and his successors, should continue to enjoy an annual composition of two marks, payable by the rector, in lieu of the one moiety of tithe of corn of the bishop's demesne lands within the whole parish of Ryton, and should, in consideration of such annual payment and perception, celebrate solemn mass with Placebo and Dirige for the soul of Bishop Anthony. Bishop Fordham granted licence to Thomas de Gretham, rector of Ryton, to carry an aqueduct from Southwell through the bishop's ground to the rectory. Bishop Skirlaw confirmed the grant to John Burgh, Gretham's successor, in 1405. At the general array of the clergy on Gilesgate Moor in 1400, the rector of Ryton was charged with one lance and three archers, being rated at the same proportion with his neighbours of Whickham and Gateshead.

The following benefactions are also enumerated"], [324, "188 CHESTER WARD.\u2014 W. D. in a book kept by the rector: \u2014 Robert Surtees, by his will, 14th Sept. 1705, gave all his lands in the parish of Whickham and Ryton to certain persons therein named, they paying thereout \u00a320 for the use of the poor of Ryton quarter, the interest to be distributed amongst such poor as aforesaid by the minister and church-wardens. Thomas Humble, by his will, 31st Dec 1718, gave to the poor of the constablery of Ryton Woodside \u00a320, the interest to be distributed at Christmas by the four-and-twenty of the parish. Anthony Surtees, who died about 1720, bequeathed to the use of the poor of ChopweU quarter \u00a350, to be placed out by the minister and four-and-twenty, and the interest to be disposed of by them amongst the most necessi- tous and fittest objects of charity. In the Parliamentary Returns of 1786, there are also mentioned a legacy of \u00a350 left by Sir John Clavering, and \u00a320 by Jane Grey, in 1708. The amount of the several benefac- tions above mentioned, being \u00a3260, has been for several years in the hands of the rector for the time being, the Rev. Charles Thorp, who pays interest at the rate of five per cent. \" He has,\" say the Commissioners for inquiring concerning Charities, \" expressed to us his intention of investing this money in the public funds ; and it appears to us desirable that this should be done, although the annual produce of the charities will thereby be considerably diminished.\" The interest is distributed annually on the 23d Dec. with the produce of other charities hereafter noticed, in sums of 3s. or 4s- each, amongst the poor of the several town- ships of the parish, according to the number of persons considered as proper objects in each ; regard being particularly had to those places for which some of the bequests were specifically made. It is also recorded in the rectors book above mentioned, that John Simpson, who died in 1732, bequeathed to the rector of Ryton and his successors \u00a350 for the use ofthe poor parishioners, the interest to be distri- buted by the rector yearly on 23d Dec. to such of the poor as he should think fit. The rector receives \u00a32, 10s. yearly, as the interest of this legacy, from the agent of Miss Simpson, of Bradley, and distributes the amount equally amongst 20 poor persons, every 23d Dec. In the Parliamentary Returns of 1786 it is stated, that John Simpson, jun , by deed in 1786, gave to the poor of this parish a sum of money, producing \u00a35 per annum. This yearly sum is also paid to the rector of Ryton by the agent of Miss Simpson, of Bradley; and he distributes the amount at Candlemas amongst about 20 widows or aged persons. Jane Forster, in her lifetime, about 30 years ago, gave to the then rector of Ryton \u00a3100, the interest to be distributed to the poor of the township of Ryton Woodside. This sum is in the hands of the present rector, who received it from his predecessor ; and the interest at five per cent, is added to the Christmas distribution, before mentioned. The rector intends to invest this money also, and the sum of \u00a330 men- tioned in the following paragraph, in the public funds. There is an entry in one of the parish books, stating that Mrs. Simpson, of Purser's Cross, Middlesex, who died in 1824, left \u00a330 to the poor of Ryton, the interest to be paid annually at Easter-eve, by the rector, to six poor widows, chosen by him from the neighbourhood of the Bradley estate in Ryton. The amount of this legacy is also in the hands of the rector, and the interest at five per cent, is divided by him every Easter, equally amongst six poor widows. There is also an entry in one of the parish books, stating, that in the year 1826, Mrs. \u2014 Cox invested the sum of \u00a350 in the new four per cents, in the name of John Copeland Weatherby, Esq., of Crawcrook, and directed him to dispose of the interest on the 23d Dec., when the other charities were distributed, to 40 poor widows of the townships of Ryton, Ryton Woodside, and Crawcrook. The amount of the dividends has been distributed from Christmas, 1827, according to the directions of the donor. Walker Lawson, Esq., who died about 1804, left \u00a3100 three per cent, stock to the poor of Ryton and Ryton Woodside, the annual produce thereof to be distributed at Christmas, and \u00a360 like stock for the better support of Ryton school. The Rev. Dr. Thorp, the then rector of Ryton, John Cox, and Barnabas Fen- wick, Esq., were appointed trustees for this charity, at a vestry meeting held in 1804, and the stock was transferred into their names. This stock was sold out by the surviving trustee in 1817; and the produce, \u00a397, 16s., was lent to the parish, under an engagement agreed to at a vestry meeting, to purchase, vrithin three years from 8th April, 1817, in the names of trustees duly appointed, \u00a3160 three per cent. consols, for the use of the poor and schoolmaster. In October, 1829, the Commissioners found that the stock had not been replaced ; but the rector forthwith purchased \u00a3160 three per cent, consols, in the names of himself and Humble Lamb and Robert Thorpe, Esqrs., both land-owners in the parish of Ryton, as a security for this charity, relying upon the promise of the parishioners to repay him the cost thereof at Eas ter, 1830. Ryton Woodside, a separate constablery, lies south of the village of Ryton. In 1592, Robert Hedworth died seized of his messuage of Ryton Woodside ; but, in 1691, it passed to. Henry"], [325, "RYTON 189 Jenison, of Newcastle, Esq., and, in 1697, became the property of Robert Surtees, of Ryton, Gent. The township at present is divided into several distinct tenements and portions of free land. It contains twelve farms, three of which are at Greenside. Greenside is a village south of Ryton. A number of cottages, chiefly inhabited by colliers, are scattered along the road for nearly a mile in length. There are also here four public houses, with such mechanics and shops as are usual in country villages. In 1781, a large house was converted into a place of worship for the Methodists, who still occupy it. A school-house was built by sub scription in 1813. Some of the scholars are educated gratuitously, and many attend on Sundays. A Sunday-school is also maintained by the Methodists. At the Staw-gate coal-pit, in this town ship, an explosion took place on May 30, 1830, when thirty-seven men and boys were killed. Stella Lies one mile east of Ryton, on the side of a brook, which divides it from Bladon township. By Boldon Book, Stelling-leye was held by the son of William the Moneyer, or master of the bishop's mint, as the landed pension of his services. Probably the bishop had merely taken, by virtue of his power and dignity, a life-interest of the master of his mint out of a portion of an estate which did not strictly belong to him; for, between 1143 and 1149, Stella was granted entire to St. Bar tholomew and the nuns of Newcastle, by the charter of Bishop William de St. Barbara; and the nuns seem to have kept full possession of Stella till the dissolution. At this time, amongst the estates of the nunnery within the bishopric of Duresme occurs \" Stellingley by yer \u00a3*3, 13s. 4d.\"* Very soon after this, Stella became the property and residence of the Tempests of Newcastle, a mercantile branch of the ancient house of Holmeside. Nicholas Tempest of Stella, born 1553, was created a baronet the 23d December, 1622. He married Isabel, daughter of Robert Lamb ton, of Lambton, Esq.-f- He died in 1626, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Sir Thomas Tempest, of Stella, Bart., who married Troth, daughter of Sir Richard Tempest, of Bracewell, co.

He died in 1692, leaving Jane, an only surviving daughter, and heir to her brother, Sir Francis Tempest, who married, in 1700, William, the fourth Lord Widdrington. This lady died in 1714, up to which period, and during the reigns of the four Stuart kings, the Tempest family had resided at Stella, \"in Catholic splendour and loyalty.\" Lord Widdrington and his brothers, Charles and Peregrine,* joined the insurrection which hoisted the standard of revolt against the house of Hanover in favour of Prince Charles, the son of James II., and by this rash adventure, as by a stroke of lightning, blasted and withered a family that had for seven centuries flourished in affluence and honour, and dissipated a fortune that had taken the labours and the prudence of the same period to accumulate and keep together. They were all three taken in arms at Preston, tried, and found guilty of high treason. The arti cles of impeachment of high treason exhibited against James Earl of Derwentwater, William Lord Widdrington, William Earl of Nithsdale, George Earl of Wintoun, Robert Earl of Carn wath, William Viscount Kenmure, and William Lord Nairn, accused them, among other things, of \"levying within the counties of Tiviotdale, Northumberland, Cumberland, and the county pa latine of Lancaster, and elsewhere, within the kingdom, a most cruel, bloody, and destructive war.\" Lord Widdrington, at his trial, being asked by the lord high steward what he had to say for himself why judgment should not pass upon him according to law, replied, \" My lords, I have abandoned all manner of defence ever since I first surrendered myself to his majesty's royal cle mency, and only now beg leave to repeat to your lordships some circumstances of my unhappy case, which I have already set forth in my answer. Your lordships see before you an unfortunate man, who, after leading a private and retired life for many years, has, by one rash and inconside rate action, exposed himself and his family to the greatest calamities and misery, and is now upon the point of receiving the severest sentence directed by any of our English laws. I do protest to your lordships that I was never privy to any concerted measures against his majesty's royal person or the established government. As to the insurrection in Northumberland, I only heard of it accidentally the night before it happened, and being soon after informed that all my neighbours and acquaintances had met in arms, a crowd of confused and mistaken notions hurried me at once into a precipitate resolution of joining them : a resolution which I must own I could never since calmly reflect upon without part of that confusion I find myself under in the public acknowledg ment of so much rashness and folly. After thus plunging out of my depth, as unprepared for such an enterprise as the action was unpremeditated, I cannot for my own particular, upon the strictest recollection, charge myself with any violation of the properties of my fellow-subjects ; but, on the contrary, I always endeavoured to encourage humanity and moderation during the whole course of our miserable expedition ; and, in order to make the best atonement in my power * Charles and Peregrine were apprehended at Preston. On May 7, 1716, they pleaded not guilty ; but bills of high treason being found against them, Philip Hodgson, of Tone, their uncle by marriage, and others, on the 31st of the same month, they withdrew their former pleas, and pleaded guilty. They were all finally pardoned, and Charles Widdrington is said to have died at St. Omers in 1756. Peregrine Widdrington was aid-de-camp to General Foster, who, in 1715, commanded the rebel army south of the Tweed. While in prison, he had the dangerous disease called the spotted fever, but recovered of it. He married Mary, Duchess of Norfolk, widow of Thomas eighth Duke of Norfolk, daughter and heir of Sir Nicholas Shireburn, of Stonyhurst, in Lancashire. By his will, which is dated in 1747, he gave his estates to his nephew, William Tempest Widdrington, in tail male, with remainder to his nephew, John Townley."], [327, "RYTON. 191 for the great fault I had been guilty of, I can justly say that I was in no small degree instrumental in procuring a general submission to his majesty. But, my lords, however willing or desirous either I or any others might be to put a speedy end to these unfortunate troubles \u2014 self-preservation, the first and most powerful law of nature, would have rendered the proposal vain and fruitless, had not the officers who commanded the royal forces given us hopes of mercy, and assured us we sub- mitted to a prince of the greatest clemency in the world. These hopes, and this assurance, an- swered the strongest objections, overcame all remaining difficulties, and gave the finishing stroke to a general surrender, whereby the further effusion of British blood was prevented, and a perfect tranquilbty restored to these parts of his majesty's dominions. My lords, as this my first attempt was rash and unpremeditated, as I always used and promoted moderation and humanity towards my fellow-subjects, and as I did not obstinately persist in my fault, but was the first who proposed an early submission to his majesty, I humbly hope my unhappy case, and the deplorable condition of my unfortunate children, already deprived of their tender mother, will raise a generous compas- sion in your lordships and the honourable house of commons: and I must earnestly entreat both your lordships and that honourable house, to become intercessors with his majesty in my behalf, for that mercy which I was encouraged to hope for when I first surrendered, and which I have ever since with the utmost confidence relied on. I have only to add my most solemn assurance, before this august assembly, that no future time shall ever find me wanting in the most inviolable duty and gratitude to that merciful prince who gives me my life, and restores a father to five miserable and distressed orphans ; and I shall always retain the highest esteem and veneration for your lordships and the honourable house of commons.\" The lord high steward then said, \" Lord Widdrington, for greater certainty, I ask your lordship whether you have pleaded any thing in arrest of judgment ?\" to which his lordship replied, \" No, my lords, I have not.\"* Derwentwater-f- and Kenmure were beheaded. Nithsdale, by the cleverness of his amiable countess, escaped out of the Tower a few hours before the time appointed for his execution. Win- * State Trials, vol. vi. p. 6. t The estate which Lord Widdrington acquired by marriage was worth \u00a312,000 per annum. His lord- ship's real and personal estate was valued at \u00a3100,000, as set forth in a petition to the parHament, 4th December, 1715. The second troop of the Northumbrian cavalry belonged to Lord Widdrington : the first troop was raised by the Earl of Derwentwater. The latter nobleman, who was nearly related to the house of Stuart, was executed on Tower Hill 24th February, 1716. As the fate of this martyr to the principles of legitimacy excited general commiseration, the following particulars relative to his tragical end must be interesting. It was reported that, the night before his execution, the earl sent for Mr. Stephen Roome, an undertaker for funerals ; and discoursing with him about his own, he told him he would have a silver plate on his coffin, with an inscription importing that he died a sacrifice to his lanful sovereign : but, Mr. Roome scrupling to comply with it, he was dismissed. This was the reason no hearse was provided for him at his execution ; so that his head was only taken up by one of his servants, and put into a clean handkerchief; and, the body being wrapped up in black cloth, they were both together carried to the Tower. \" It appears that Lady Derwentwater, during her lord's imprisonment, rented, and after his death conti- nued to rent, Dagnam Park near Romford, and not far from Thorndon, Lord Petre's. This was bought by Sir Richard Neaver, Mrs. Howard's father. The chapel, which had been fitted up in the Catholic manner, and was taken down only about the year 1784, was wainscotted in oak, with an oaken Catholic altar and pulpit. Lord Derwentwater's body was brought from London, and laid there till sent to Dilston. There was a foolish story current, that his ghost walked in the gallery adjoining. There is now in Ingalestone Alms-house, founded by Lord Petre's family, an old woman, who has frequently heard from her\" mother, what was otherwise also known, that she assisted in sewing on the head.

Widdrington, Carnwath, and Nairn, were pardoned; but the attainder on their blood and property was preserved. On February 27, 1719* Lord Widdrington set forth, in. a petition to parliament, that he was seized as tenant in tail of his paternal estate of about ,\u00a33000 a year, part of which had then been sold for .\u00a332,400, for the use of the public, and the whole forfeited from him and his family for ever; but that he was also seized, as tenant by courtesy, of the estate of Stella, worth about \u00a3800 a year, which he had obtained in marriage, and it had been decreed by the commissioners and trustees for the public, to descend, after his death, to his chil dren ; he, therefore, prayed that leave might be given to bring in a clause to be added to the bill then depending in relation to forfeited estates, to enable his majesty to apply out of Stella a sum not exceeding \u00a3\"700 a year, towards the support and maintenance of himself and his distressed family. The king said, he had no objection to what the house should do therein : but the question passed in the negative by a majority of 159 noes, against 126 yeas.* In another petition, 27th February, 1733, after stating that a clause in an act in 1723 recited that by the sale of his real and personal estate, and the rents and profits of it received before the sale, the sum of \u00a3.100,000, and upwards, had been raised, and the greater part of that sum paid into the exchequer, and also, directed the sum of \u00a3\"12,000 to be applied to the maintenance of himself and family ; but he him self, being incapacitated to sue, and disabled to inherit any estate that might fall to him, therefore prayed that leave might be given to introduce a bill into parliament for removing the incapacities occasioned by his attainder, and for granting him such other relief as the house should think fit, which bill passed into a law by receiving the royal assent on the 17th of May following. The attainted Lord Widdrington died at Bath in 1745; when his son, Henry Francis Wid drington, succeeded to the estates of Stella and Stanley, which were his mother's inheritance. Deprived of his paternal estate and of his parliamentary honours, he led a long life of peace and obscurity, and, dying at Turnham Green, was buried at St. Pancras in London, 7th September, 1774- He left his property and claims to his nephew and heir, Thomas Eyre, with remainder to his cousin, Edward Standish, Esq.

The north front overlooks Stella Haugh, intersected by arms of wentwater's orders, and containing Lord Derwentwater's dress which he wore on the scaffold : \u2014 coat, waist coat, and breeches, of black velvet ; stockings that rolled over the knee ; his shoes ; a wig of very fair hair, that fell down on each side of the breast ; a part of his shirt, part having been cut away \u2014 this bloody ; the black serge that covered the scaffold, and also the piece of black serge that covered the block, stiff with his blood, and with the marks of the cut of the axe in it. The family of Lord Petre have found at Thornden many most interesting letters from the earl from the Tower, and an account of his death by his confessor \u2014 most striking and affecting. They have, besides, many trinkets, which belonged to him. The son lived to 19 : had he lived till 21, preparations were making to cut off the entail, in which case the estate would now belong to Lord Petre. The old entail being at an end by the last Lord Newburgh's death, the estate would have come to James Lord Derwentwater's only daughter, Anna-Maria Lady Petre.

The south front faces a beautiful small park, which is pleasingly diversified with rising grounds and clumps of trees. The interior of the house exhibits various proofs of the state and hospitality of its ancient proprietors, including some curious pic tures and relics of former times.* It is at present occupied by Mrs. Bridget Dunn. The domestic Catholic chapel belonging to the hall having become too small for the accommo dation of an increasing auditory, a new chapel is being erected in the village. -f- It is a neat Gothic structure, with buttresses and narrow lights, after a plan furnished by Mr. Green, architect. It is 68 feet long, and 33j ,feet broad, and will contain above 300 persons. The interior will be ex tremely plain ; but, perhaps, the size of the spandrels in the roof will give it a heavy appearance. The tower, which is 50 feet in height to the top of the cross, and ornamented with turrets, will form a pleasant and convenient dwelling-house for the chaplain. The chimneys are not judiciously managed, being formed so as to convey the idea that the tower and the chapel are distinct build ings. But economy, in more instances than one, seems to have been carried too far in this erec tion, which, after all, will be one of the handsomest chapels in the county. Near the chapel, a coach-house and stabling are erecting, for the use of such persons as reside at a distance. The estimated expense of these buildings is \u00a31500. The Rev. Thomas Eyre, D. D., the first president of Ushaw College, when chaplain at Stella, began to make arrangements for buildino- a chapel, for which purpose he obtained a grant of ,\u00a3500 from the Right Honourable Lady Mary Eyre, fifth daughter of Charlotte, Countess of Newbrough, peeress in hepov/n right, and who died at 'Warkworth Castle, co. of Northamptonshire, 27th August, 1798. The interest of this sum has now swelled the amount to \u00a3950. George Silvertop, of Minsteracres, Esq., has also subscribed \u00a3100 towards the building of this chapel; George Dunn, of Newcastle, Esq., and his family, \u00a3230; Mrs. Dunn, of Stella Hall, \u00a3100; Mr. W. Dunn, of Hedgefield House, Esq,, \u00a350, and Mrs. Dunn, \u00a3^10; the Rev. William Hull, \u00a3\"50; besides a number of small sums from liberal Protestant gentlemen in the immediate neighbourhood. The village of Stella remains very stationary, as no encouragement is given to the erection of cottages. It is well situated for manufactures, and contains a wharf, belonging to the London Lead Company, of which Mr. Edward Latimer is agent here ; and a coal-staith, for the use of Messrs. G. Dunn and Co. Here are three public houses, an ale and porter brewerv belono-ing to Messrs. Thompson and Co., two maltsters, and Messrs. Emmerson and Co.'s iron foundery.

The marsh, the meadow, and the wood (nemus), are reserved to the lord. The mill pays five marks and a half. In 1368, Ralph Nevill, Chivaler, died seized of the manor, held by twenty marks exchequer rent. Hatfield's Survey states only, \"that Lord Nevill holds the vill of Wynlacton by knight's service and ,\u00a320 rent ;\" and in Lord Nevill's family the manor continued till the reign of Eliza- beth, when, just before the forfeiture, Charles Earl of Westmoreland, 19th July, 1569, conveyed his manor of East and AVest Winlaton, for \u00a32000, to Richard Hodgson and William Selby, who held it in equal moieties. In 1613, William Selby died seized of half the manor, leaving George Selby his son and heir; which Sir George Selby died in 1625, and left six daughters his coheirs, married to Belasyse, Delaval, Curwen, Conyers, Fenwick, and Delaval. Yet the estate of Winla- ton seems to have descended to Sir William Selby (brother and heir male of Sir George), some time styled of Shortflatt, co. Northumberland ; and, in 1633, John Hodshon, Esq., and William Fenwick, Gent., had pardon for purchasing without licence the same moiety from Sir William Selbie, Knt., and William Selbie, Esq. The alienation was probably on trust ; for Sir George Selby, of Whiteliouse (created a baronet 1664), is sometimes styled of Winlaton, As to Hodgson's share, 8th August, 7 Gar. 1631, George Hodgson, Gent., acquired three-eighths of the manor of Sir Robert Hodgson, Knt. William Hodgson, Esq. (brother and heir male of Sir Robert), is de scribed of Winlaton 1661 : his daughter and coheir, Alice, became the wife of Sir Thomas Tem pest, of Stella, whose representatives held a portion of the manor. Yet the Andersons also retained some share ofthe purchase; for 14th April, 41 Eliz. 1600, Robert Anderson, merchant, acquired one-fourth of the manor from his father, Robert Anderson, alderman, of Newcastle.* A plan of the lordship of Winlaton, A. D. 1632, states \u2014 Sir William Hodgson's share, 1601 acres, 2 roods, and 36 perches; Sir William Selby, 2121 acres, 3 roods, and 28 perches ; and Robert Anderson, Esq., 509 acres and 36 perches. The present proprietors of the manor and royalties are, Peregrine Edward Townley, Esq. (as representative of Widdrington and Tempest), ggths; Miss Anne Simpson, g^ths; Thomas Went worth Beaumont, Esq. M. P., ijjths; the representatives of the Earl of Strathmore, g7Bths; the Marquises of Bute and Hertford, g^th ; and William Morton Pitt, Esq., g'j-th. The proprietors of houses in Winlaton pay a small ground-rent ; but no lease or security of any kind is granted them. Yet the fullest confidence is placed in the holders of the manor honourably adhering to ancient custom, and which dependance has never, in any instance, been disappointed. Above two years ago, Thomas Wentworth Beaumont, Esq., offered his part of the manor for sale, on certain equitable conditions, which were readily accepted by every one who occupied any part of his property. By this sale, about fifty freeholders have been created. Winlaton has been rendered famous as the chief scite of Sir Ambrose Crowley's manufactory. This worthy, honest, and enterprising man first fixed upon Sunderland near the Sea, as an eligible situation for his projected manufactory ; but, after an experience of five or six years, he trans planted his Cyclopean colony to the district between the Tyne and Darwent, a cheaper country, * In 1644, an entry occurs in the Sequestrators' Books, \" Letten to George Beadnell, all that eighth part of Winlaton lordshipp, late belonging to Sir John Minis, \u00a375 per ann. 13 Mart.\" This Sir John Mints (Mennes or Menzies) was a Scottish knight, and had obtained some interest in the collieries. In 1651, he is included in the list of loyalists who refused to compound, and whose estates were ordered to be sold for the use of the state."], [331, "RYTON 195 and abounding with coal. This was about the year 1690, when the village is described as consist ing of a \" few deserted cottages.\" In the following year, Winlaton corn-mill was converted into an iron-forge and grinding wheel ; and the works for manufacturing the heaviest articles were soon after extended to SwalweU, where still anchors of the largest size, anvils, chain-cables, pumps, and cylinders for steam-engines, spades, shovels, saws, all kinds of cast metal utensils, and, in short, almost every form of which iron and steel are susceptible is produced in these works, where \" Incessant, day and night each crater roars Like the volcano on Sicilian shores. Their fiery wombs each molten mass combine ; Thence, lava like, the boiling torrents shine ; Down the trenched sand the liquid metal holds, Shoots showers of stars and fills the hollow moulds. The benefactor of Winlaton is said to be designated by Addison in the Spectator as Sir John Anvil, who \"began the world with a small parcel of rusty iron; and being gifted in the acquisi tion of wealth, was knighted in his 35th year, and being intent on making a family (with a dash of good blood in their veins), married a woman of fashion, who changed his name to Enville, and confined her husband to the cockloft when she had visitors of quality.\" Whatever degree of truth there may be in these private anecdotes, Sir Ambrose was undoubtedly a man of uncommon saga city and energy, and the creator of his own fortune. The sign of The Doublet, both at the com pany's wharfs at Greenwich, and the warehouses in Lower Thames Street, is said to have been a picture of the identical leather jerkin in which he worked when a common smith. Sir Ambrose was knighted at St. James's 1st January, 1706, was sheriff' of London in 1707, and died in 1713, being then one of the alderman for that city, and member of parliament for Andover. Surtees says, \" By Mary, daughter and coheir of Charles Owen, of London, Gent. (5th son of Sir William Owen, of Cundover, co. Salop), he had one son and five daughters. Mary, the eldest, was married before 1707 to James Hallett, citizen and goldsmith, of London ; and Lettice, Sarah, Anne, and Elizabeth, were under age at the time of his decease. Lettice married afterwards Sir John Hinde Cotton, Bart. ; Sarah became the wife of Humphry Parsons, Esq. (lord mayor of London 1707) ; and Elizabeth married to John, 10th Lord St. John. John Crowley, Esq., only son of Sir Am brose, bora in 1689, married Theodosia, daughter of the Rev. Joseph Gascoigne, S. T. P., vicar of Enfield, co. Middlesex, and by her had John and Ambrose, who died without issue, and four daughters : Mary, second wife to Sir William Stanhope, K. B. ; Elizabeth, married to John, 2d Earl of Ashburnham ; Theodosia, to Charles Boone, Esq., M. P. for Castle Rising ; and a post humous daughter, that died under age. Theodosia, the widow of John Crowley, Esq., died in 1782, and devised the bulk of her property to the Earl of Ashburnham, her son-in-law, and to George Viscount St. Asaph, his only son, and the Ladies Henrietta, Jemima, Elizabeth, and Theodosia, his daughters, then her only surviving grandchildren.\" After Sir Ambrose had fully established his useful and extensive manufactory, he, with great o-ood sense and benevolence, instituted a code of laws for the government of his colony, and which was afterwards altered and improved as cases and exigencies dictated. To put these laws into execution, a court of arbitrators was appointed to meet every ten weeks at Winlaton, for hearing and determining disputes among the workmen. The fees were fixed at a moderate rate. This institution had the happiest effect in reconciling differences, administering justice expeditiously, and rendering unnecessary the oppressive, absurd, and ruinous processes of the common law."], [332, "> CHESTER WARD\u2014 W. D. 196 Schools were also established for the instruction of the workmen's children. A surgeon was ap pointed to attend the whole body. AVhen any workman was ill, he had money advanced ; when superannuated or disabled, he had a weekly maintenance; and, at his death, his family were pro vided for. Under these excellent regulations, Crowley's workmen lived happily and contentedly for upwards of a century. The name of Crowley or Crawley became extinct on the death of Mrs. Theodosia Crawley, relict of John Crawley, Esq. She died on the 7th of May, 1782, aged 88 years. Mr. Millington pur chased of Sir Ambrose's descendants their interest in the works; and his son, Crawley Millington, became head of the firm. The grandson of the original purchaser has now succeeded; and the works at AVinlaton Mill and SwalweU are carried on under the firm of Crawley, Millington, and Co. The company employ two vessels of 300 tons burthen, which are constantly engaged in carrying their manufactured articles to their warehouses at Greenwich and London. In 1816, the company abandoned the village of AVinlaton, when all the charities ceased, and the workmen were left to their own resources. Much and long-continued suffering was the necessary consequence ; but the place has now recovered the shock, and, during the last ten years, there has been an in crease in the township of 656 persons. The hall belonging to Sir William Blackett, in Winlaton, was licensed as a place of worship in June, 1704-5, when the workmen chose a minister of their own, and contributed for his support one half farthing in the shilling from their wages, which was augmented by -PIO per annum from the proprietors. Afterwards, a certain stipend was fixed for the minister of ,\u00a350 per annum, and the collection above named became sufficient to yield above \u00a3?20 per annum for a school. On April 17, in the same year (1705), a subscription was commenced for building a chapel, and which, in January following, was fully finished and beautified, and regularly pewed. It had a gallery at the west end, with a turret and a clock, and afforded accommodation for 300 persons.* For some time, the chapel was served by its own separate minister,-f- and daily service was per formed there. It is said to have been erected on the scite of an old chapel dedicated to St. Ann, and which was destroyed in the rebellion of the earls in 1569 ; and Hutchinson says that \" human bones have been frequently dug up, when there was occasion to break up the soil to any depth.\" This chapel, having been abandoned by the company, fell into decay in 1816 ; when a laro-e school-room was immediately erected, upon the same scite, by subscription, aided by gifts from the National and Diocesan School Societies, and from Lord Crewe's trustees.:}. Church-service was voluntarily performed in this school-room (under the bishop's sanction) by the rector of Ry ton, or his curate, whenever other duties left them disengaged ; but there was no settled stipend for the performance of service at Winlaton. The town of AVinlaton stands on a high, bleak ridge, sloping on the east, north, and south, to wards the rivers Tyne and Darwent. The buildings are tolerably regular, and the streets partially paved ; but convenience, not shew, is the object always aimed at.

There are now many masters employed in the manufacturing of nails, hinges, chains, patten-rings, S_c. About 7000 patten-rings are, on an average, made here weekly, which quantity at present is calculated to ex ceed half the consumption of that article in England. The first stone of a new Chapel of Ease was laid on the 9th July, 1827, and the building was finished early in 1829, and cost \u00a32500.* It is from a beautiful Gothic design by Mr. Ignatius Bonomi. The side aisles, which are neatly pewed, are divided from tlie body of the church on each side by three pillars, supporting circular arches. The centre is occupied by free seats. The altar is ornamented by a fine painting of Christ taken down from the Cross, presented by Charles J. Clavering, Esq. The organ, purchased by subscription, and erected by Messrs. Small, AArood, and Bruce, Edinburgh, has a peculiarly fine tone. Besides being a finger organ, it contains four barrels, each of which plays ten tunes, so that when the organist, Mr. Laws of Newcastle, is un able to attend, the singing can still be accompanied by the organ. The tower contains five bells, presented by Mr. Robert Belt. The Rev. J. Reid, B. A., is the present curate. The church-yard, which is well inclosed, is spacious; and when the shrubs and trees that are planted come to maturity, it will be very beautiful. Since its consecration, upwards of a hun dred persons have been buried here. At the right of the entrance, on an upright stone : \u2014 \" Sacred to the memory of Cuthbert Thompson, who died 13th of May, 1829, in the 78th year of his age.\" At the east end of the chapel are two other upright stones.

Thompson, iron manufacturers. The former congregation is at present collecting funds for building a chapel, and have for their minister the Rev. Ralph Davison, late of Newcastle. The old chapel is now used as a National School, and is conducted by the master, William Fleck, on the Bell or Madras System. About 100 children, on an average, attend, and are sup. plied with books, slates, pens, and ink, gratis. The expense of the establishment is defrayed partly by voluntary subscription, and partly by the weekly pence of the children, each of whom pays 2d., 2id., or 3d., according to their progress in education. There are three other day schools and three or four dame-schools in the village ; besides the Church, Methodist, and Inde pendent Sunday-schools. * In the porch of the chapel is a board containing the following inscription : \u2014 \" This chapel was erected in 1829.

A subscription library was established here on July 19, 1819- It is supported by about fifty members, each of whom contributes 4s. annually. The library now consists of between 4 and 500 volumes. Books are received and delivered every Sunday morning, between nine and ten o'clock. The beneficial effects of the wise regulations which subsisted so long in this place are still appa rent; for the people of AVinlaton continue to exhibit the characteristics of an attached, reflecting, and orderly community. The absence of crime, even during periods of great suffering, and the circumstance of the constable's office being a mere sinecure in the midst of such a populous place, in times when occasional excesses are practicable, are decisive proofs of the truth of this remark. Winlaton Cottage is a commodious house near the village, the property of Miss Belt. Lady well bleach-field is adjoining to this place. Mr. George Hepple Ramsay has recently purchased a small, but pleasant estate near the village, upon which he has erected an excellent house, laid out the pleasure-grounds tastefully, transplanted trees, and adopted every contrivance to impart beauty to his residence. Winlaton Mill, before mentioned, isS a small village, inhabited chiefly by workmen employed in the iron manufactory of Crawley, Millington, and Co. Darwent Haugh, a hamlet in Winlaton township, about 5 miles west of Gateshead, is seated on the banks of the Tyrne, near its junction with the Darwent. Here is a coal-staith and cinder-ovens, belonging to the Marquis of Bute; also various works most spiritedly carried on by Mr. G. H. Ramsay, consisting of manufactures of sal-ammoniac, flint, and colours for potteries, bone-ashes, bone-manure, and fire-bricks. The clay for the latter is mostly procured from a coal-pit near AVinlaton, belonging to Mr. Ramsay. This gentleman is also a dealer in pantiles and bricks, and has likewise a malting and a steel forge at this place. A little further up the Darwent, Mr. R. Hoyle has a lamp-black manufactory, near to which the Darwent intersects part of SwalweU,* and the part on the west side is included in AVinlaton township. * Charles Nesbit, an able artist, was born in 1775, on the banks ofthe Darwent, near to this place. His father was a keelman, who, perceiving the bent of his son's genius, apprenticed him to the celebrated Tho mas Bewick. During most part of his apprenticeship, his indications of genius were neither numerous nor striking ; but when at liberty to devote his energies to a favourite object, he showed powers of a superior order. His first large work was engraving Johnson's drawing of St. Nicholas' church, on twelve distinct blocks of wood, which were joined and cramped together. For this beautiful specimen of wood engraving lie received the gold pallet from the Society of Arts. He also received a silver medal from the same society in 1802, for his engravings on wood. On his arrival in London, he found the art of engraving on wood in a miserably low state. His admirable illustrations of Hudibras and Shakspeare, and the Religious Emblems printed by Johnson and Warwick, excited the attention and revived the hopes of the lovers of the fine arts. The works printed by Sir Egerton Brydges, at the Lee Priory Press, contain some exquisite specimens of his superior skill ; and a scene in Tasso's Jerusalem Delivered, drawn by Thurston, in Savage's Decorative Printing, presents an effort in wood engraving that has perhaps never been surpassed. The variety, the richness, and the depth of the foliage, is wonderful. Mr. Nesbit occasionally introduces in his figures spe cimens of cross-hatching, which it was once imagined could not be done on wood. In London Mr. Nesbit was exposed to those temptations which in that place encircle men of extraordinary genius ; but he with drew from the whirl of dissipation, and returned to SwalweU, where he lived in close retirement durin-***' twenty years. Most of his time was devoted to gardening, being only engaged partially in his profession. On the death of his mother, to whom he was much attached, he again removed to London, where his talents will, no doubt, be again justly appreciated."], [335, "RYTON 199 Axwell. The manor of Axwell, in 1362, was held of the see of Durham by William de Birtley, at 13s. 4d. rent. Under Hatfield's Survey, it was held by the heirs of Hugh del Redheugh by knight ser vice and 15s. 4d. About 1411, Thomas del Redheugh alienated the manor to Roger Thornton. Elizabeth, daughter of the younger Roger, by marriage carried the estate into the Lumley family. In 1574, Matthew Ogle purchased the manor of Axwell and a tenement in SwalweU from John Lord Lumley ; but, in 1604, John Ogle, of Cawsey, Esq., conveyed his property in Axwell and SwalweU, with the mines, to Roger Lumley, Gent., a branch of the family of Lord Lumley. In 1629, Axwell was sold to John Clavering, alderman of Newcastle. The Claverings re-united some other parcels of the estate by purchase. In 1586, AVilliam Ogle granted to William Shafto, of Tanfield, Gent., a fourth part of the manor of Axwell-houses, and another fourth pait of the manor of \" Axsheles\" to Rowland Shafto, Gent. Arthur, the son of AArilliam Shafto, in 1629 granted his part to the Claverings. The family of the Claverings derive their descent in the male line from Charlemagne. The original family name is De Burgh, which was resumed by the Marquis of Clanricarde in 1752. Eustace de Burgh, a noble Norman, had two sons, who came over with William the Conqueror. Serlo, who built Knaresbrough Castle, died without issue; but his brother, Joannes, had three sons, whose descendants became connected with the noblest houses in England. One branch of the family became barons of AVarkwortli ; and Eustace de A^escy was one of the competitors for the crown of Scotland. The surname of Clavering was given by King Edward I., from Clavering in Essex, which was the chief estate of Robert Fitz-Roger, Lord Clavering, Baron of Warkworth and Clavering.* Robert Clavering, son and heir of John Clavering and Elizabeth Fenwick, mar ried Ann, daughter of Sir Thomas Grey, of Horton Castle, co.

James, the son of Robert Clavering and Ann Grey, was sheriff of Newcastle in 1599, and mayor 1607 and 1618. His son, John Clavering, of AxweU, Esq., also served the offices of sheriff' and mayor of Newcastle. He married Ann, daughter of Robert Shafto, alderman of Newcastle, widow of Robert Tempest, and died in 1648. His eldest son, James Clavering, married Jane, * It is remarkable, that in the short space of six generations, there were amongst the descendants of Eva, Baroness Clavering, the following illustrious personages: \u2014 A king of England, a queen of England, a Duchess of York, a Duchess of Clarence, a Duke of Bedford, a Marquis of Montacute, an Earl of AVest moreland, an Earl of Northumberland, an Earl of Salisbury, an Earl of Kent, the celebrated Earl of AVar wick, a Lord Latimer, a Lord Abergavenny, an Archbishop of York, and an Earl Marshal of England. The three principal male branches, that of John Fitz-Robert, lineal ancestor of the Claverings of CaUaly, and those of Lacy and Vescy, who had respectively assumed those names, were amongst the twenty-five principal Engbsh barons (many of whom were also their near relations, as appears from the pedigree of the Clavering family) who headed and led on almost all the nobility of this kingdom, to obtain the celebrated Magna Charta, the bulwark of British liberty, from King John, in obtaining and securing which they had a most eminent and distinguished share : they all three signed it, with the barons above-mentioned, on behalf of the whole kingdom, at Runnimede, after having previously marched to London, and taken King John prisoner in the Tower. John Fitz-Robert and his cousin Vescy were, together with Lord Robert Fitz- Walter, the general in chief, the most obnoxious to King John of all the barons, and incurred the severest threats from his displeasure \u2014 Mackenzie's Hist, of Northumb. vol. ii. p. 30."], [336, "200 CHESTER WARD\u2014 AV.

A\u00e6well Park, the beautiful modern seat of the Claverings, bes in AVinlaton township, and north of the Darwent. The house was built by the late Sir Thomas Clavering, from a chaste and ele gant design of Payne's, and is, by professional men, considered one of that eminent architect's happiest efforts. It stands open, but not unsheltered, in the midst of a soft wooded park, which slopes gently to the Darwent, and is diversified by beautiful swells and undulations of ground. A number of deer add to the simple and rural beauties of the scene. The southern view overlooks the rich enclosures and hanging woods of Gibside. The east front commands a prospect of Darwent bridge, and extends over part of the vale of Tyne, the shipping at Newcastle Quay, and the heights of Gateshead. Mr. Clavering is possessed of some very valuable pictures by old masters ; amongst which may be enumerated two very large and splendid paintings, which shew the style of Paul ATeronese : the one represents the Raising of Lazarus, and the other the Inauguration of a Bishop. Here are also, The Holy Family, by Caracci ; The Passover, Le Seur ; Bentivoglio, Titian ; Interior of a Cathedral, Neefs and Tenier ; Sacking a Arillage, Varjder Malin ; Skaiting, Bout ; and several portraits. Old Axwell lies to the south of the Darwent. Part of the old manor house and offices are standing, a little to the west of Clockburn Lane. After the desertion of Old Axwell, the Selbys removed to their seat called Whitehouse, and which was afterwards occupied by the Claverings. This mes suage stands about half a mile west of the present residence. Blaydon is situated on the Tyne, at the foot of the hill on which AVinlaton stands, and is divided from Stella by a small rivulet. It is a busy viUage, and contains a large lead refinery, belonging to Mrs. Diana Beaumont, and under the direction of Mr. John Mulcaster, who inhabits Qlaydon House, a very neat dwelling. Here are also an iron foundery, a steel forge and bric(i"], [337, "RYTON 201 manufactory carried on by Messrs. Emerson and Milner, another iron foundery belonging to Mr. G. W.

Joseph Cowen and Co. have a fire brick manufactory at Blaydon Burn; and there are two fell mongers and two corn mills near the same place. This village has recently increased in popula tion, and some good houses have been erected. Here are eight public houses, a Methodist chapel, and a well-attended day-school, conducted by Mr. Edward Martinson. A plot of waste ground near the bridge is set aside for building a more commodious school-room ; and \u00a3180 is already subscribed for the purpose. In 1828, a joint stock company was formed for building a chain-bridge over the Tyne, from the township of AArinlaton to Scotswood in the county of Northumberland, and for making convenient roads and approaches thereto. On February 19, 1829, Mr. Ord presented a petition to the House of Commons for a bill to carry the scheme into effect, and which received the royal assent on the 13th of April following. By this bill, the company became incorporated under the name of \" The Scotswood Bridge Company.\" Their capital was limited to \u00a320,000, divided into shares of \u00a350 ; besides which, they were empowered to raise a further sum of \u00a38000 by mortgage of the tolls, in case \u00a3'20,000 was found inadequate to complete the undertaking. The spot chosen for erecting this bridge is about 300 yards west of the hamlet of Darwent- Hauffh. The first stone of the land abutment on the south side was laid under the direction of Mr. Green, the architect, and in presence of Messrs. Grace and Ramsay, two of the committee, on July 21, 1829. The coffer dam of the north pier was commenced in September following, and the first stone laid 9th February, 1830. During the high flood that occurred 14th October, 1829, the works were endangered, and a large quantity of timber was carried away ; but the damage was promptly repaired, and many keel loads of chalk ballast were deposited, so as to protect and strengthen the abutments. On Tuesday, April 16, 1831, the bridge was opened by a grand procession, consisting of a number of gentlemen on horseback, and about ninety carriages of various kinds. The cavalcade was met at the bridge by Charles Clavering, Esq., the high sheriff of the county of Durham, and the Rev. C.

The company, preceded by music and banners, then advanced to Blaydon, and, following the old turnpike road to SwalweU bridge, returned by the new road to the chain bridge. As soon as the procession had passed, the crowd rushed upon the bridge ; and it was calculated that above 3000 persons were collected, on the space between the points of suspension, making, with those which crowded both ends, a dense mass of at least 5000 persons. Thus it was demonstrated that the erection was fully equal to the sustenance of any moving weight which, under any combination of circumstances, it is possible to place upon it.* This bridge is 630 feet in length. The distance between the points of suspension is 370 feet, with two half arcs of 130 feet each.

The piers are of Norman architecture, light in their construction, and graceful in their proportions. Indeed, the whole, like other similar structures, is pleasingly airy, elegant, and beautiful. The act of parliament, authorizing the building of this bridge, directs that \" the lowest part of the road-way shall be twenty-one feet at least above the surface of the water, at the height of the flood of ordinary spring-tides.\" But even if this enactment has been complied with, the keelmen who have to pass underneath experience much inconvenience, by being obliged to lower the masts of their keels. The act provides that \" it shall not be lawful to erect any other bridge for the passage of horses, cattle, or foot passengers, nor for the passage of carriages, save railway car riages, properly constructed, within 1000 yards of the said (meaning Scotswood) bridge.\" The directors of the Newcastle and Carlisle Rail road Company have it in contemplation to erect a bridge for their own use, about 100 yards above the chain-bridge, where (at least on one side) an excellent foundation may be procured. The engineer of the Rail-way recommends that it be built upon wooden gears, which would retain their soundness and strength for at least twenty years.* There are three new roads or avenues connected with this suspension bridge. One commences at the north end of the bridge, and terminates near the Forth, within the liberties of Newcastle; a second road leads from the south end of the bridge to nearly the west end of Darwent bridge ; and the third road leads from the bridge to the Hexham road, at the village of Blaydon. This last road has been formed at a great expense ; for the country being low and level, it has been raised with earth dug from the south side of the road, by which means a very wide and deep ditch has been formed. \u25a0f- Yet the road is still too low, for several breaches were made in it by the flood in October, 1829. But as the Newcastle and Carlisle Rail-way will run parallel with the north side of the road, and will be raised some feet above it, an effectual barrier against the acci dents of flood will thus be obtained. Scotswood bridge will certainly prove a great convenience to many of the neighbouring gentry ; and it is to be hoped that those persons calculate inaccurately^ who predict that the speculation will prove an unprofitable one.

Barlow FeU, Beda Hills, Blaydon Green, and the other waste lands in the manor and township of Winlaton, were divided and inclosed in pursuance of an act of parliament passed in 1823; Thomas BeU, of Newcastle, being the sole commissioner employed, who made his award of this division June 29, 1829. The lands divided, exclusive of that portion allotted for roads, quarries, wells, watering places, &c, are declared by this award to contain 394 acres, 1 rood, 13 perches ; of which 3 roods, 26 perches, was allotted to the rector of Ryton, for a church-yard or cemetery, for the use of the township of Winlaton, and on which AVinlaton chapel has since been erected.

Thornley lies south of Barlow, and nearly opposite to Gibside. It anciently belonged to the NeviU family, and, from 1565 to 1709, was the seat of a branch of the Tempests. The estate now belongs to the Marquises of Bute and Hertford. The Upper and Nether Spen are two ad joining farms, the last of which belongs to the Strathmore family. Chopwell anciently comprised the south-western angle of the parish of Ryton ; but the estate has now been divided into several distinct portions. Bishop Hugh gave Chopwell to Newminster Abbey, in exchange for Wolsingham. Surtees conjectures that the Swinburns, who were already tenants of Chopwell under the abbey, obtained at the dissolution the fee-simple of the crown or its grantees. In 1562, John Swinburne, Esq., was litigating his boundaries betwixt the manors of Ryton and Chopwell, with Pilkington, bishop of Durham.* In 1569, he was deeply engaged in tory to their tenants, that the other lords of the manor will, no doubt, soon follow their example. The rent of houses and cottages in this township is usually paid weekly \u2014 an innovation on ancient practice which affords a strange sign of the times. Thomas Richard Beaumont, Esq., was born about the year 1758. Early in life he entered the army as a cornet, and ultimately attained to the rank of lieutenant-colonel of the 21st Light Dragoons, which he had raised as a fencible corps amongst his northern tenantry, but which was transferred to the line about the year 1795. The circumstances attending this transfer caused a great sensation in the north, and for a con siderable time rendered Mr. Beaumont very unpopular. He married Diana, daughter of Sir Thomas Went worth Blackett, Bart., of Bretton Hall, Yorkshire, who, upon the death of her father in 1792, succeeded, by will, to the magnificent manor of Bretton Park, the Abbey of Hexham, and extensive property in entails, and lead-mines in the counties of Northumberland and Durham. Colonel Beaumont represented the county of Northumberland in five successive parliaments. He was first elected on the death of Sir William Mid dleton in 1795, in 1796, 1802, 1806, 1807, and 1812; and retired in 1818, in favour of his son, Thomas AVentworth Beaumont, Esq. He died at Bretton Hall after a protracted iUness, on the 31st July, 1829, and was interred in the family vault there on the 11th of August. * An exemplification of an information in the chancery at Durham, by the attorney-general against John Swinburne, for working coals in Ryton common, with inter, and depos. thereon. \u2014 Also an award of arbitra tors, touching the bounds of Chopwell and Ryton, on the above information, 5th of q.

A great part of it has been planted. The hamlet of Chopwell is distant 11 miles west-south-west from Newcastle. Chopwell Hall is merely a farm-house. Almonside, commonly called the Guards, is the property of Anthony Surtees, of Hamsterley Hall, Esq. There is a brick and tile manufactory on this estate. Hukergate is the estate and residence of James Hutchinson, Esq. The house was recently built by the present proprietor. Blackhall, on the Darwent, was held under the crown grantees by the Rutherford family, when the Dudleys of Newcastle purchased Chopwell. A feud took place between these two families in 1615, and which probably arose from some contention respecting rents and boundaries. The con sequences were, \"John Rotherforth, otherwise Rudderford, Gent., of Wrensnest, Charles Rother forth, of the Black Hall, Hugh and Gawen Rotherforth, and William Shafto, were outlawed for forcibly entering into the manor of Chopwell, with intention to kill and slay Ambrose Dudley, Esq., George Gifford, and others, at a place called AVestwood ; in which affray William Shafto struck the said George Gifford a mortal wound in the thigh (of which he soon died) with an iron lance.\" The Rutherfords fled from tlie face of the law. The bishop, to whom the forfeiture ac crued, granted their interest in the Black Hall to Sir Philip Constable, of Everingham, Knt. (15 Apr. 1615), who in the same year conveyed to AVilliam Carr, of Cocken. Charles Ruther ford, named above, married Margaret, daughter of Thomas Swinburn, of Capheaton ; and, from an entry in Ryton register, it would seem that he had returned when the storm was over, and died unmolested in his old habitation. Blackhall afterwards passed into the possession of the family of Surtees. At Blackhall, several workmen are employed by Isaac Cookson, Sen., Esq., in manufacturing German steel, which was first made here by emigrants from Germany. The paper-mill lately car ried on by Mr. John Jefferson Harrison is now unoccupied. Crawcrook, a viUage about one mile west of Ryton, containing four farm-houses, two public houses, and two schools, one of which is generously endowed by Miss Simpson, and the other is patronized by Lady Ravensworth. There is also a Church Sunday-school here. Crawcrook, by Boldon Book, was on lease with the villain service; but, before Hatfield's Sur vey, it had become a free manor, and it is stated, \" Robert Horsley holds half the vill of Craw crok, by knight's service and ten shillings (and a toft and forty acres, caUed Bradley, by one penny rent, on St. Cuthbert's day, in September).\" In 1544, Margery, sister and heir of Roger Horsley, married Cuthbert Carnaby, of Haydon Bridge, co. of Northumberland. After the lapse of a few generations, the Carnabys sold this estate in small parcels. The other moiety of Crawcrook was the property of the hospital of St. Giles of Kepyer, and, after the dissolution, was distinguished by the name of Little Kepyer, which John AVatson, of Newcastle, acquired in 1587, by purchase of John Heath, Esq. It consisted of \" four messuages, a water-mill, four gardens, two hundred acres of arable, as many of pasture, a hundred and forty of meadow, forty acres of woodland, two hundred of furze, and heath, three hundred of moor, thirty of marsh, a free fishery in the Tyne, and 27s. rent in Little Kepyeare near Crawcroke.\"\" vol. i. 3 G"], [342, "206 CHESTER WARD.\u2014 W.

In 1794, Crawcrook Tounfields, consisting of 700 acres, were divided by act of parliament. The coal-mines were reserved to such persons as were entitled before the division, and the other royal ties to John AVharton, Esq., and Crosier Surtees, Esq. Bradley HaU stands nearly a mile to the west of Crawcrook, and is a neat modern house, shel tered by fine woods, which extend to the Tyne, and impart a rich and warm aspect to the place. It is at present occupied by Robert Hedley, Esq., son of the late highly respected Alderman Hedley, of Newcastle. The Horsleys held Bradley with Crawcrook. Before 1610, it was held by John Lyon, who was ruined by a crown extent. However, Bradley Hall and lands in Craw crook seem to have been in possession of his son in 1626. Shortly after, the Andersons of New castle acquired the whole of Bradley,* and it still remains in possession of their descendants. PARISH OF LANCHESTER.

He married, in that year, Anne, daughter of William Jackson, of Newcastle. His only son, Sir Francis Anderson, of Jesmond and Bradley, Knight, married Jane, daughter and heir of John Dent. He \" was a devoted loyalist, and, on the ruin of the royal cause, became an object of peculiar persecution to the successful party.

The celebrated Roman station at Lanchester occupies \" a lofty brow to the west of the village, on a tongue of land formed by the junction of the Browney and the Smallhope beck. On three sides the ground falls from the camp ; on the west only it is commanded by a high moorland hill, whose prospect ranges from the Cheviots, north, to the chain of the Cleveland and Hamildon hills, south. The station forms a parallelogram of a hundred and eighty-three yards from north to south, and one hundred and forty-three yards from east to west, and includes an area of about eight acres. The wall or rampart is still in some places almost perfect, and is nowhere totally destroyed. AArhatever depredations the spot may have formerly suffered, it is preserved with reli- gious care by its present proprietor. The vallum has been probably nearly twelve feet in height. The outside is perpendicular, built of ashler work in regular courses, the stones being about nine inches deep and twelve long : the interior is also of ashler work, formed of thin stones laid tier above tier, slanting and covering each other featherwise, and run with mortar mixed with rough gravel. The thickness of the vallum at the present surface is eight feet, but diminishes gradually by parallel steps to about four feet at the summit. It has a deep fosse on the west, and on the other sides the advantage of the sloping hill. The angles of the walls appear to have been guarded by round towers ; and, like every Roman camp, there have been entrances in the middle of each side. Arestiges of the Pr\u00e6torium may be still traced near the north gate, though covered with luxuriant herbage ; for the area of the station has been long ploughed, and only present to a com mon observer a level close of eight acres, inclosed by a mouldering rampart shadowed with bram ble and ancient thprn. \"AVithin the last century, and in the memory of persons still living, the whole area of the station, now levelled by the plough, was matted with thorns, brambles, and hazels. The late pro prietor of the farm at Hollingside recollected the spot, when it was covered with fallen pillars, and the towers of the wall were still visible. Horsley had an opportunity of inspecting the ruins of the baths, which were placed near the south-east corner of the vallum. The floor was supported by pillars about a yard distant from each other, and resting on a substance apparently metallic. The angles of four square stones met upon each of these pillars, and had their upper surface plas tered to the depth of four inches with a mixture of lime, limestone, pebbles, and fragments of brick ; this composition is extremely hard, has a rocky appearance not unlike granite, and seems in some parts to have undergone a partial vitrifaction. Beneath these pillars a second range was found, resting on blue stiff clay, with the space betwixt them filled with rubbish. Every trace of the bath is now obliterated, except some large masses of its flooring, built up in the neighbouring fences. The stone employed in the station has been brought from a hill about a mUe to the east of Lanchester. A paved way, which might lead from the quarry to the camp, may be traced in the brook opposite the church, and through the church-yard, at more than three feet below the surface. \" Though several deep wells have been found near the walls, and though the garrison could be eupplied with water from two open springs within fifty paces from the south and east wall, the Romans were not to be satisfied without something like a stream flowing through their camp,"], [344, "208 CHESTER WARD.\u2014 W. D. The traces of two aqueducts, each at least two miles long, are standing proofs of their industry. These ducts take a circuitous direction on each side of Umber Hill. The southern branch has its source in the Rippon-burn, and is traced through Mr. White's woods, and on the lower side of the Wolsingham road, between Coldpike Hill and Hollingside. The northern channel makes a north west angle in the fields above Newbiggin, and diverging towards Upper-houses one way, and to Mr. White's woods the other, terminates at a spring whose stream is now employed in turning Knitcbley-miU. This branch is easier to trace than the other, and is extremely conspicuous through the uncultivated ground, in Mr. White's woods, and at its head, where a mound has been thrown up to obtain a level. Mr. White has re-opened a part of it, and employs it in conveying water to his fish-ponds. The reservoir of both channels was opposite the south-west corner of the vallum.\" The grand Roman military road, called the Northern Watling Street, which Warburton says may be traced from Dover to Piercebridge, where it crosses the Tees, proceeds from thence, ac cording to Leman's Commentary, to St. Andrew Auckland and the Bishop's Park, to Binchester, and, crossing tbe AArcar, passes on to Lanchester. Near to this noble station, Hodgson observes, that \" AVatling Street is as visible as on the day it was made. On the hill west of Hamsteels, and at Heugh, it may lie traced through Porter's Dale, over the high grounds toward Ebchester, and from thence to the Tyne. In some places it is paved ; in others formed by a high ridge of earth covered with gravel : in general, it has a ditch on each side. On the edge of this road, about a mile north of the station, near a farm called Low Woodside, the foundations of a small circular building were discovered by the plough about forty years since. In it were a great number of hollow-headed copper nails ; a clawed hammer of rude workmanship ; and several other antiques were found buried in the ashes, resembling those of a smith's furnace.\" Besides Watling Street, another road, called Wrekendyke, led from this station, by Maiden Law, Urpeth, Kibblesworth, and over Gateshead Fell, to the estuary of the Tyne. It is difficult to trace the foundation and fall of the station at Lanchester. The very name of this important camp is extremely dubious; but, after weighing the many disputed opinions on the subject, and taking into consideration the authority of Richard of Cirencester, it may, with great probability, be inferred that Lanchester is the Epiacum of Ptolemy, and which stands at the head of the towns belonging to the Brigantes. But by whatever name this important station may be designated, it seems to have existed during the early ages of the Roman dominion in Britain. This is proved by the large proportion of coins found here belonging to the higher empire, and the lapse of time necessary to bring it into that state of decline it was found in by Gordian, and described in the two following notable inscriptions found here : \u2014 IMP.

Two winged Alctories, with branches of palm and bucklers in their right hand, support a wreath, within which is inscribed leg. xx. v. v. fec ; a boar is represented at the base. Another inscription mentions the second cohort of the Ararduli, who probably formed a part of the twentieth legion. A great many other rebques, including a small gold plate, have been rescued from the ruins of the station. The greatest number of these antiquities, being accumulated by Hunter, were depo sited in the cathedral library of Durham ; though many are preserved at Ford, the seat of the proprietor of the station. The house at Hollingside, Lanchester church, the village, the farm houses, and the stone fences of the neighbouring inclosures, have, in a great measure, been built out of the ruins of the station. Many lettered or sculptured stones are placed in the walls with their faces inwards. The station had, in fact, been the general quarry of hewn stone for the whole neighbourhood ; and, no doubt, many valuable reliques will yet be discovered. Lanchester, after ages of depredation, still exhibits perhaps the boldest and proudest monument of the Roman arms in the north. -f\" * The Basilic\u0153 were courts of justice and places where merchants met to transact business ; our modern justice-room and exchange under one roof. Afterwards, when Christianity obtained the protection of the emperors, the Basilic\u00e6 were sometimes converted into churches. The Principia were the quarters of the Principes, where the legionary eagles were deposited; the Armamentaria were the magazines of arms or arsenal, t The accurate description of this station given by Hodgson, and the judicious remarks of Surtees, leave little to be added. Those who wish to enter fully into the antiquity of the place may consult Camden, Horsley, Hunter, Gale, and Hutchinson. It may here be sufficient to remark, that the numerous hearths discovered amongst the ruins do not, as has been supposed, prove that a tribe of smiths inhabited the station ; for the Roman hearths, used for culinary purposes, exactly resembled those used in the smelting of metals. Nor is it clear that the large quantities of iron scoriae, scattered over the hills of Lanchester, are the remains of ore wrought by the Romans ; for the station had other tenants, subsequent to the departure of the Romans. The Saxons usually occupied the scite of Roman camps ; and in this. station there has been found a York penny of Edward III., a penny of Edward IL, a groat of Robert Bruce, a Calais groat of Henry IA''. or V., and some later pieces of the time of Elizabeths vol. i. 3 H"], [346, "210 CHESTER AVARD\u2014 AV. D. -' The historical evidence,\" says Surtees, \" deducible from these various sculptures and inscrip- tions, amounts to little more than \u2014 that the place was garrisoned by a portion of the twentieth legion, the A'arduli, and the Lingones ; and that the Romans not only dedicated their altars to the ancient gods of the Tiber, but admitted into their easy heaven Attires and the Sylvan guardians of the British hills and forests. The name of no other emperor, I think, occurs, except that of Gordian, the restorer of the station. The names of a few tribunes and propr\u00e6tors close the cata- lo-Tue. But the discovery of coins of the Constantines and their successors, to Aralentinian, may seem to prove that the station was scarcely abandoned before the final flight of the Roman eagle. Its destruction was probably owing to some sudden and violent catastrophe. The red ashes of the Basilica and the bath, the vitrified flooring, and the metallic substances, evidently run by fire, which occur amongst the ruins, form a strong indication that the structure perished in flames. A long night intervenes; and, a century after the Norman conquest, a Christian Lanchester first appears\u2014 parcel of the ancient patrimony of St. Cuthbert, with a church built out of the military ruins of Pagan Rome.\" Modern Lanchester. The modern Lanchester is a small, straggling village, six miles north-west-by-west of Dur ham. It is situated in a warm, sheltered vale, watered by the Smalhope-burn, about half a mile to the west of the station. It contains two farmholds, three public houses, a corn mill, and black smiths, shoemakers, joiners, cartwrights, and other useful operatives. Two surgeons also reside here. The school will be noticed under the head Charities. A Methodist chapel was built in this village in 1821. Petty sessions is held here every alternate Friday. The townships of Lanches ter, Burnhope and Hamsteels, Holmside, and Butsfield, maintain their poor jointly, and are called the undivided part of the parish. The Church. The parish-church of Lanchester has gone through the stages of a Rectory, Collegiate Church, and Perpetual Curacy. It was rectorial until Anthony Beke, in 1283, erected it into a collegiate church, consisting of a dean and seven prebendaries.* The founder furnished a set of statutes and ordinances, which were confirmed by Edward I. in 1293. They are very curious, being illustra tive of the state of ecclesiastical discipline at that time. Mr. Surtees procured an old English translation of the original statutes, from which the following is extracted : \u2014 The chief articles of regulation were, \" That the dean shall be perpetuall within holy orders of priesthood, having wholly the cure of souls.\" Each of the prebendaries of the three first stalls shall provide, at their own individual charge, one vicar chaplain ; and each of the four remaining prebendaries shall maintain one chaplain in holy orders. Let \" everye of the vicars goinge from * The foUowing endowment was assigned to the respective prebends : \u2014 To the first stall, the fee-farms of Eshe, Cornshow, Hedley, Hamsteels, High and Low Broomsheeles, and those arising from the land of Mat thew the Forester. To the second, Medomsley, Housetrees, Kyo, Bursblades, BiUingside, Bradley, and Crook. To the third, Greencroft, Holmside, Colpikehill, Steley, Buclesfelde, the Smith's land, and Scati gurley (Satley). To the fourth, Langley, Riding, Stubbilee, Brome, Notesteles, Brunhope, Langcestre, and Peche. To the fifth, Heley, Conkesheved, and Kincheley. To the sixth, Yvestone and Benfieldside; and to the seventh, Morileys, Newbigging, Hartibuke, and Fordes. These seven prebends were generally denominated from the place first named in their endowments, as the prebend of Eshe, &c."], [347, "LANCHESTER. 211 his house towards the churche, and likewise retorninge, &c. endeavour hymself to goo with a mo dest and grave pace ; and when he shall come into the churche, lett hym humble hymselfe before the crucifixe, and there lett him pray ; and after that he has entered into the quier, and before he doo goo into his stall, lett hym inclyne and bow hym seise towards the high alter in honour and reverence of our Lord and his most holye mother.\" None of the vicars shall \" brawle or chide in the quier or without ; but lett them keepe silent ; not mormoringe, gaynsayinge, or contendinge with one another ; neyther yett laughing, fleering, staring, nor casting vagabond eyes towards the people remayning in the same churche.\" It may be trusted that part of the above admonitions may at this time of day be needless in our Protestant cathedrals ; but the following piece of advice is always in season : \" Let the vicars read and also singe alowde, distinctly, with full voice, and without over skipping or cutting the wordes, making a good pause in the mydest of every verse, begynninge and endinge altogether, not protractynge or drawinge the last syllable to longe ; not hastily running it over, much less interminglinge any strange, variable, profaine, or dishonest speeches.\" Next, \" None of the said vicars shall, without some sufficient cause, go into any com mon taverne, nor tarye in the same ; neither exercise wrastlinge, dauncinge, or any other hurtfull gaymes, nor [frequent] such spectacles or syghtes, which ar comonly called Myracles ; neither lett them be helpers to any that practise the same.\" The succeeding clause prohibits the ecclesiastics from that \" grave scandalum\" of wandering about \" upon the streate,\" or sitting in the houses of \"anie lay person in their habit, unlesse the occasion be godlie and honest.\" The degrees of coercion and punishment for offenders are established much as usual. For the first offence, private reprimand ; then severe and public rebuke in the chapter, with loss of that one day's stipend ; for the third offence, loss of three days' stipend ; for the fourth, \" the subtrac tion of a whole weeke's waige ;\" for the fifth, suspension from the priestly office for fifteen days and loss of waige therewith ; \" but if anie doo fall into offence the sixt tyme, lett him be taken as a rebel not reformable, and without delay expulsed from the college :\" saving in all things the discretion of the deane either \" to deal more courteously or sharpely.\" Half the fines for neglect to go towards church ornaments, the other half to the vicars, \" who by occasion thereof will be better adorned.\" Each prebendary shall renew his sacerdotal habit, and pay his vicar his wages when he receives the fruits of his prebend.

D. the stalls in the choir ; \" the first on the south side we specially reserve to ourself and successors in token of preheminence.\" The three remaining stalls on the south were appropriated to the first, third, and seventh prebendary. On the north, the dean sat opposite to the bishop, and below him the remaining; prebendaries. The endowment bears date at Aucland, 12 Oct. 1283, the first year of Bishop Anthony, and is followed by the confirmation of Hugh, prior of Durham. In process of time, abuses crept into the college of Lanchester; and, in consequence of the ra pacity and non-residence of the deans and prebends, even the very church exhibited \" vacations and gaping ruins.\" Cardinal Langley endeavoured to reform the establishment, and afterwards, by his decree, settled a dispute respecting the right of vending and distributing holy water in the villages of \" Hamsteeles, Corneshaw, and Hedlie.\" After the succession of eighteen deans, this college, in common with other religious houses, was. dissolved. Its revenues were then valued at =\u00a349, 3s. 4d. ; but were valued in the Lincoln taxa tion at \u00a390, 13s. 4d. The following pensions were paid to the surviving members of the colle giate church of Lanchester, 1553: \u2014 To Robert Hindmer, dean, \u00a320; William Frankland, prebendary of Iveston, \u00a33; Lancelot Knagge, prebendary of Butsfield, \u00a32; Richard Burnche per, prebendary of Medomsley, \u00a35, 6s. 8d. ; John Mylner, prebendary of Greencrofte, \u00a3?4, 13s. 4d. ; AArilliam Knagges, prebendary of Eshe, \u00a35. Some small pensions were also reserved for the perpetual curate of Lanchester, and for the curates of the dependent chapelries of Medoms ley, Eshe, and Satley. The rest of the collegiate possessions, both lands and tithes, were scat tered under crown grants in very various proportions. The scite of the deanery is still well known, on a plot of ground surrounded by a ditch, a little to the north of the church ; but no portions of the ancient buildings are now remaining. The Impropriation, \u2014 By letters patent, 25th March, 7 Edward A^L, the king granted to Simon AVelbury and Christopher Morland, with other church lands, all the capital messuage and scite of the late college of Lanchester, and all the lands and possessions to the deanery of the same, under a small crown rent. Welbury and Morland immediately after granted the premises in Lanchester, Medomsley, Esh, Greencroft, Ulshaw, and Cornsey, to Richard Hodshon. The estate is now held by David Bevan, Esq,, London. Ladie-Lands consisted of certain meadows and one garth called Ladies-garth, containing about, six acres. They were given for the maintenance of one light, called our Ladie-light, in the parish church of Lanchester. Tithes. \u2014 The tithes of corn and grain, belonging to the different prebends of Lanchester, were, after the dissolution, parcelled out in various portions ; of which there are ample notices in the Chancery Rolls at Durham. Sir Nicholas Tempest held the tithes of grain in the hamlets of Lan, chester and Newbiggin, part of which were afterwards conveyed to the family of Greenwell. The AViddringtons of Cheeseburn Grange held a large portion of tithes, which were also purchased by, the Greenwells, The Church, though stripped of its vast revenues, still exhibits many marks of its original grandeur, and is much superior in size and appearance to the common parochial structures in the western district of this county. It is a fine building of hewn stone or ashler work, and consists of a nave and chancel with regular aisles, a tower, and a porch. The porch is very deep, and gives a heavy appearance to the south front. The west tower, which is seventy feet in height, is a, square of twenty feet, embattled, and strengthened by flying buttresses. The nave, which is about forty-five feet in length, has an aisle on each side, formed by two.rows of three handsamQ"], [349, "LANCHESTER. 213 round pillars, supporting four pointed arches, with zigzag mouldings. The aisles exceed the nave a few feet in length ; the south aisle being about nineteen feet in length, while the north is only fifteen. The chancel is divided from the nave by a circular arch, springing from clustered pilasters with or namented capitals. The arch is decorated with three rows of rich zigzag mouldings. The chancel bas been stalled with carved oak seats on both sides, for the accommodation of the dean and preben daries. A door opens out of the chancel into the vestry on the north, under a pointed arch, which has been ornamented with a group of figures in bas relief. The Arirgin is in the midst, seated in a chair of state, and adored by angels, while the Old Dragon lies prostrate underneath. There are corbeils of human heads within the altar-rails, and which have probably supported images. The lighte in this ancient edifice are handsome and regular. The aisles are each lighted by two double windows under square labels, and by one towards the east of three lights under a pointed arch. On the south there are four upper windows,, each with two b'ghts under square labels. The chancel has, to the south, three windows under pointed arches, two of which have two lights, and the other three. The east window consists of three tall lancet lights, which have been filled with painted glass. As tlie church is dedicated to the Alrgin, it is probable that her history once ornamented the windows and other parts of the edifice. In the upper part of this window was the Virgin's flight from Herod's persecution ; aud there are still traces of the adoration of the Magi, with the legend, laCCC iilagi bfrUItt SJfUm atror. The Virgin and Child appears again in the western window of the chancel. In the east window of the south aisle are the arms of Tempest impaling Umfreville, and in the adjoining window a venerable head, said to represent the Apostle John. There are other heads and fragments of richly stained glass, which indicate the departed grandeur of this structure. Some of the architectural ornaments are executed in the style which prevailed in the time of Henry ArI. ; but the wrecks of a much older edifice are visible. Fragments of Roman sculpture, Saxon sepulchral stones, and ancient tombs, have been discovered both in the building and in its vicinity. Monumental Inscriptions. \u2014 A recumbent effigy, in Stanhope marble, of a canon secular, with elevated hands clasping the chalice, lies under an arch in the wall of the south aisle. This figure, which is nearly concealed by a pew, is conjectured with some probability to represent Stephen Austell, dean of Lanchester, who died in 1461, on whose account Thurstan Ryston, rector of Stanhope, and William Sotheron, chaplains, conveyed two tenements and eighteen acres in Green croft to the church-wardens and parishioners of Lanchester, on condition of their causing Placebo and Dirige to be annually performed for the soul of Dean Austell on his anniversary, 27th Fe bruary, and of finding a perpetual lamp to burn before the altar of St. Catherine, where he was buried. Dean Rudde, one of Austell's successors, lies buried under a blue slab of enormous proportions, about the midst of the chancel : its brags is inscribed.: \u2014 \u00a9rat-c pro anima iWag'if Sjoannie iiu&trr in 73ccreti$ i_\u00bbacca laurii quondam Osrani fjujue i2ccle$iae Qui obiit xxix trtr i&rptrmtirie anno D'ni mcccclxxxx cu'u*s animae propittrtur Sinus animarum.

School \u2014 There was in the township of Lanchester a school, supposed to have been built by subscription, on the waste. In 1824, a new school was erected upon the scite, with apartments above for the residence of the master ; and the expenses of this building were defrayed by voluntary contributions and donations. Upon the inclosure of the commons in 1781, a small allotment, containing little more than an acre of very bad land, was set out in respect of the school : this is fenced out, and is in the occupation of the Rev. Joseph Thompson, the incumbent of the parish, at the yearly rent of 5s. per annum, which is stated to be the ut- most value. Towards the endowment of this school, the sum of \u00a3100 appears to have been left by John Smirke, about 18 years ago. In respect of this legacy, a sum of \u00a389, 16s. was transmitted by the executors to a banker at Durham, to the account of the church-wardens, who were directed to appoint two trustees, and they appointed the present incumbent, and AVilliam Thomas Greenwell, Esq., of Greenwell Ford. The sum of \u00a389, 16s. was withdrawn from the bank at Durham shortly before a failure took place, and the amount has remained in the hands of the Rev. Joseph Thompson, who pays \u00a34 yearly as the interest thereof. There is no entry in the parish hooks, or any security or memorandum given by the incumbent for this money. In respect of this yearly sum of \u00a34 and 5s. paid for the allotment, the schoolmaster instructs four children, boys or girls, of Lanchester, or the neighbouring townships, two being appointed by the incumbent and two by Mr. Greenwell, in reading, writing, and accounts, without any charge. Each child is allowed the benefit of this charity for a period of two years. The schoolmaster is appointed by the incumbent, Mr. Greenwell of Ford, and Sir Thomas Clavering. He takes other scholars, and has 50 or 60 upon an average throughout the year. Clavering' s Charity. \u2014 George Clavering, by a codicil annexed to his will, 18th May, 1793, reciting that he had purchased, in the names of himself, Allan Greenwell, of the Ford, Esq., and the Rev. Robert Dent, curate of Lanchester, \u00a3265, 10s. four per cent. Bank Annuities, declared that the said stock was purchased in the names aforesaid, upon trust, out of the dividends to pay to the schoolmaster ofthe school established at Lanchester the annual sum of \u00a310, for teaching and instructing four boys in the English grammar, writ- ing, and arithmetic, until they should be fit to put out to business, such four boys to be nominated by the person who for the time being should be in possession of his estate at Greencroft, and in default thereof by the curate aforesaid, and upon further trust, to pay the residue of the dividends to the persons who should for the time being be in possession of his estate at Greencroft. On the death of the testator, Sir Thomas Clavering succeeded to Greencroft estate, and therefore became eligible to become a trustee jointly with the two above-mentioned trustees. Sir Thomas Clavering was then resident in France; but AVilliam Lockey, his agent, has paid the master of the school the yearly sum of \u00a310. Atkinson's Charity. \u2014 In 1681, it appears that Cuthbert Atkinson bequeathed a rent-charge of \u00a33 yearly, issuing out of his lands at AVoodside, to the poor of the parish of Lanchester, to be paid and distributed at Easter and Christmas, by such persons as should enjoy his lands at AVoodside, and by the curate or parson of Lanchester for the time being, to the most needy, indigent, helpless poor people. The Rev. Joseph Thompson, the present curate, receives annually at Easter \u00a33 from the tenant of David Bevan, Esq., the owner of a farm called Low AVoodside, in the parish of Lanchester, and he distributes it in sums varying from Is. to 4s., as he sees occasion, to poor persons of the parish. The money has not been given away on any particular day, nor has any account been kept of the distribution. Old Parish Stock It appears from an old parish book, that from 1732 to 1751 there was a sum of \u00a3110 placed out on bond, and the interest thereof added to the produce of Wilkinson's charity, hereafter men- tioned. It further appears, that in 1752 the parish officers having purchased some land, the payment of interest was discontinued. It seems that, at the period above mentioned, the amount of the poor's stock was laid out in the purchase of a close called Lint Lands, containing 3 a. 2 r. 16 r., lying between and ad- joining two fields, part ofthe estate derived from Rowland AVilkinson, and also a house with out-buildings, and a garth and cottage in Satley, part of which premises haye since been resold, and the residue now form.; part of the estate held by the parish officers, with the lands belonging to AVilkinson's charity. The Com missioners for inquiring concerning Charities could not ascertain any further particulars relating to this pur chase, as the parishioners were not possessed of any deeds, except a lease for possession, bearing date 27th March, 1752, from which it would appear that the conveyance was made to William Greenwell, Thomaa Greenwell, and AVilliam AVheatley. voh. i. 3 K"], [354, "CHESTER WARD\u2014 W.

The estate now held by the parish officers of Lanchester (including the lands purchased, as above mentioned under the pre ceding-head) consists of a farm-house and several closes of old inclosed land, containing 52 a. 1 e. 27 p- and 32 acres of allotments, set out on an inclosure in 1781 ; the whole is let to Thompson AVilkinson upon an ao-reement for a lease for twelve years, from 13th May, 1824, at a good yearly rent of \u00a350, and the parish officers thereby agreed to pay the bishop's rent, \u00a31, 5s lOid., and land-tax, and also to allow five loads of lime for every acre of certain parts of the new inclosed lands therein described, and containing about 20 acres, till the whole thereof was laid down in grass. According to this agreement, the tenant has received an allow ance of lime annually, and there are about five acres only remaining to be laid down. The rent is received by the church-wardens, and after payment of the out-goings (which in the last five years have amounted upon an average to about \u00a39, 10s. per annum, including the expense of the lime provided for the tenant, and some small charges for repairs,) the clear rent has been divided amongst the poor in the following man ner : \u2014 Previously to St. Thomas's day, 1828, \u00a310 or \u00a315 was paid every Easter Tuesday and St. Thomas's day amongst the overseers of the different townships attending the parish church, and of the chapelry of Satley, to be distributed amongst the poor in their respective districts ; a list of the poor in each district being produced by the overseers, consisting of such only as received regular weekly relief from the poor-rates ; and the overseers received from the sums appropriated as above mentioned sufficient to give each poor person Is. or 2s. The residue was received and disposed of by the minister and principal inhabitants amongst other poor persons not receiving weekly relief, who from sickness or some other cause appeared to require assistance. In 1828, doubts having arisen as to the propriety of this mode of distribution, a case was drawn up for the opinion of counsel, and the parishioners were advised to extend the distribution more generally to such ob jects of charity as should not be in the receipt of regular parochial relief. Accordingly, on St. Thomas's day, 1828, the overseers produced a list of such poor persons residing within their respective districts, and not receiving weekly relief, as they thought best entitled to partake of the charity ; and the rent was di vided, at a vestry, according to such lists, allowing to each person the sum of 7s- At Easter, 1829, a simi lar system was pursued, and each individual recommended to the vestry received a sum of 13s.

By this indenture it was next provided that proper persons be hired and paid for their trouble in attending to the schoolmaster or such of the twelve poor persons as should by sickness, infirmity, or accident, be rendered incapable of taking care of themselves. And it was further provided, that 20 children between the ages of six and ten years, boys or girls or both, should be admitted to be taught in the said school free from all expense, and should be provided with books necessary for the purpose; and that no child should continue in the school after having attained the age of twelve years. And it was further provided, that the said poor persons and schoolmaster should be nominated by the owner or owners for the time being of Brancepeth Castle, that each of the said poor persons should be of the age of 55 years or upwards, unmarried or in a state of widowhood, and in case any of them should have a child or children, such child or children should not be permitted to become inmates with them in the said hospi- tal ; and that when elected, the said poor persons and schoolmaster should be admitted into the said hospital and school-house, and should continue to enjoy the provision thereby made for them until they should die, or be deprived thereof by virtue of the powers therein after given ; and that the said 20 children should be nominated by the owners of Brancepeth Castle for the time being. And it was directed, that the said poor persons, schoolmaster, and scholars should constantly attend divine worship on Sundays and holidays, unless prevented by sickness or some other sufficient cause, at the nearest church or chapel; and that the school- master should every AVednesday morning, and also on Sundays and holidays, when the poor persons should be prevented attending at any church or chapel, read in the school-room one of Paley s or Hampson's ser- mons, or such other as should be selected by the rector of Brancepeth or his curate, and should also every morning read such prayers as should be selected by the said rector and his curate, to the said scholars and poor persons. And it was further provided, that the owners of Brancepeth Castle for the time being should have power, with the trustees or the major part of them, to make rules and orders for regulating the said hospital and school, and for the government of the said poor persons, schoolmaster, and scholars, and for regulating and preserving the charity ; that the existing rules should be painted or written on tablets to be hung up in some conspicuous part of the said hospital, and in the said school ; and it was declared, that if the said poor persons or schoolmaster should refuse or neglect to comply with such rules, or otherwise mis behave themselves, or if any of the said poor persons should marry, it should be lawful for the owners of Brancepeth Castle for the time being to suspend, punish, or remove them, with the like power of displacing any of the scholars who should misbehave ; that whenever any vacancy of the said poor persons, school master, or scholars, should take place, another fit person should be elected by the said owners within six calendar months, or in case of their default, by the trustees for the time being, or the major part of them. And it was further declared, that the said trustees should pay to the said William Russell his heirs or as signs, owners of Brancepeth Castle, the surplus of the rents and profits of the said estate at Billy HaU. And a power was given to the trustees to appoint such person as they should think proper as their agent, to superintend the said hospital and school-house, and to report to the said trustees and the owners of Brancepeth Castle, at least once in every three months, the state and condition thereof, to the intent that the rules and orders given for the government of the same might be better enforced, and to give to such a^ent for his trouble therein such stipend, not exceeding the yearly sum of \u00a35, out of the said rents and profits, as they should think proper ; and it was provided, that whenever the number of trustees should be reduced to three, the survivors might appoint so many other fit persons residing in or near the town of"], [356, "CHESTER WARD.\u2014 W.

The buildings erected bv the founder are situate near the village of Cornsay, in the parish of Lanchester, and consist of three rooms in the centre, comprising a school-room and a residence for the master. On one side of this building are six apartments for six poor men, and on the other side the same number for six poor women.

The average annual expenditure of the last six years, including \u00a35 per annum retained by Mr. Bradley as agent for his trouble, has amounted to about \u00a3240- Jane and Elizabeth Tempest's Charities. \u2014 Jane Tempest left a charitable donation of \u00a36 a year for cloath ing and teaching a certain number of poor children of the parish of Lanchester, and \u00a34 a year for the relief of poor housekeepers. Her sister Elizabeth, by will, dated 27th May, 1785, gave her nephew, John Tem pest, Esq., \u00a3200 in trust, out of the interest of which he was directed to pay \u00a32, 2s. in augmentation of the said charities, and the residue to be distributed amongst the poor prisoners in the gaol and house of correc tion at Durham. The Parliamentary Commissioners say, \" Nothing appears to have been paid in respect of the charity of Jane Tempest for upwards of twenty years, though it is stated that some children were for merly sent to school and cloathed by the owner of her estate, called Hamsteels ; and we have found no trace whatever of any payment in respect of Elizabeth Tempest's charity, nor any evidence of any settlement having been made by John Tempest, Esq., in pursuance of the bequest of Jane and Elizabeth Tempest.\"* Lands. \u2014 Lanchester appears in Boldon Book one of the great manors of the see of Durham. It contained forty-one oxgangs, each consisting of eight acres. Twenty tenants in villenage pay for each of these oxgangs thirty pence, and, with the help of the cottagers, mow the whole of the meadows, and win and lead the hay, and bring the hogs from the forest ; and, whilst they mow, they have a corrody (crowdy) ; and when they drive the swine, each has one loaf. Four cottagers held eight acres, 4s. Some held their lands on more honourable services. Ulf holds sixty acres, pays sixteen shillings, attends the lord with one greyhound at the great forest hunt in AVeredale, and serves on the bishop's errands. Ulkill and Meldred hold forty acres by similar tenure. The Punder holds six acres, and takes the thraves of corn of the vill of Lanchester, and renders forty hens and three hundred eggs. The meadows and the cow pastures are in the hands of the bishop. The mills pay eight marks, and every two oxgangs of villain-tenure provide one measure (chordam) of provisions in the great chase. * There is a society in Lanchester for performing the pleasing duty of rewarding merit. On April 21, 1829, the minister, church-wardens, and select vestry, adjudged and paid the following rewards: \u2014 1. To the person who has brought up the largest family without parochial assistance, \u00a34; to Alexander Short, of East Butsfield, he having brought up nine children to the age of thirteen years, without parochial assistance. 2. To the person who enables, or has enabled, his or her aged or infirm parent or parents to live without parochial assistance, \u00a33 ; to John Allaburton, of the Brooms, he having enabled his aged parent to live without parochial assistance for the last six years. 3. To the person who has served faithfully the same master or mistress the greatest number of years as a household servant, \u00a32 ; to Ann Moor, of Greenwell Ford, she having served AV. T.

At this day, the chief portion of the lands are held by copy of court roll under the see of Durham. The manor includes the several vills of Lanchester, Broom, Flass, Burnhop and Hamsteels, ColdpikehiU, Broomsheels, Satley, Butsfield, Benfieldside, BiUingside, Kyo, Rowley, and Roughside. In 1773, a very extensive division of common lands took place within the parish of Lanchester. The preamble to the act states the quantity at \" nearly 20,000 acres ;\"' but, according to Bailey, the account stands 12,281 acres, 2 roods, and 2 perches, more improveable \u2014 3835 acres, 3 roods, and 7 perches, less improveable \u2014 and 300 acres sold to defray expenses. These 300 acres were sold under a separate act, to provide a fund for indemnifying such damages as owners of allot ments might sustain by the working of the mines belonging to the see of Durham. In order to pay expenses and form roads, 1550 acres were sold. The division included the several wastes called Lanchester Fell, Medomsley Fell, Ebchester, Rowley, Satley, and Butsfield Fells, New biggin Fell, and Knitchley Fell (the commons of Roughside, Charlaw, and Findon Hill were ex cepted). A rent-charge of four-pence per acre was reserved to the see of Durham ; the mines were also reserved. The new allotments were to be considered as of the same tenure, and subject to the same tithes, as the ancient estates, in right of which they were set out. All timber grown on copyhold allotments was exempted from the bishop's rent, and twenty- one years was allowed for inclosing the less improveable allotments. Hamsteels Common was inclosed by a separate act, 12 Geo. III. 1772. In 1810, an act was obtained for making a turnpike-road from Durham (through Lanchester) to Shotley Bridge. The road passes directly through the vale, instead of the old circuitous route along the heights. Lanchester Lodge stands upon the scite of White House, and is parcel of the dissolved deanery. It was, in Elizabeth's reign, in the possession of the Tempests, but is now the property of George Ormsby, Esq., and the residence of Mr. Robert Potts. Ford, or Greenwell Ford, is a handsome modern mansion, seated in a beautiful vale, about half a mile from Lanchester, surrounded by rich enclosures and scattered woodlands, and enlivened by the Browney and Smalhope Becks. This estate, previous to the Survey, gave name to John of Fenhall and Gamel del Ford. About a century later, the property was vested in the Fayrhare family ; but, in 1633, Nicholas Greenwell, of Fenhall, purchased the lands in Ford, which are now the property of AVilliam Thomas Greenwell, Esq. The tenement called Greenwell (where the family resided before Ford was built) lies to the south, across the Browney, Manor House. \u2014 This estate adjoins Lanchester on the south-west. The house anciently called Maydenstonhall was taken down some years ago, and replaced by a modern farm-house, which is the property of David Bevan, Esq. Previous to the dissolution, this estate was parcel of the mo nastry of Hexham. Coldpike-Hill, frequently corrupted into Cold-pigg-hill and Cowpigg-hill, is first mentioned in a grant to St. Cuthbert and his monks of Durham, At length it became a free manor, which, at the close of the 14th century, belonged to the family of Parke. In Elizabeth's reign, the Cocksons. were owners of the manor ; and ultimately it became the property of Andrew Robinson Stoney, by marriage with Miss Newton, his first wife. It is now the property of Robert Johnson, Esq., of, Byker, near Newcastle, vol. 1. 3 L"], [358, "CHESTER AVARD.\u2014 AV. D. 222 Greencroft. This township adjoins Lanchester on the north-west, and contains two gentlemen's seats, thirteen farms, one corn mill, one public house, with a few mechanics necessary to the operations of husbandry'. Greencroft Hall stands on the southern declivity of a hill, about a mile to the north of Lan chester. It is a spacious, elegant mansion, embosomed by luxuriant plantations of lofty forest trees, and commanding a fine rural prospect of the winding vale of Lanchester. There are several excellent paintings in this hall, one by Titian, and several by the most eminent masters in the Flemish school. Greencroft, by Boldon Book, pays sixteen shillings, carries the lord's wine with a wain of four oxen, and the tenants maintain the twelfth part of Lanchester mill-pool : the demesne lands are exonerated from this service, but perform the whole carriage of wine. In Hatfield's time, Robert de Kellow and John Rugheved (under the title of Dringes) held the vill of Greencroft under se veral services, and attending the bishop's great chase with two greyhounds. Other parcels of land were held by exchequer rent. Kellow's moiety passed to the Claxtons, and was forfeited by Ro bert Claxton, who engaged in the northern rebellion in 1569. The Rugheveds held the other moiety till 1423, when it was in the possession (on trust) of Sir Ralph Eure, Knt. In 1468, Thomas Forster conveyed his moiety to the Halls of Stanley, who held the estate for two centu ries, and seem to have re-united it.* Ralph Hall, who died in 1656, was a steady loyalist; and * The following letter from Bishop Toby Matthew has been often printed; but it exhibits such a curious view of the policy of former times, contrasted with the liberal feelings which now prevail, that it deserves to be placed on record in a local work : \u2014 \" Tobie Mathew, Bishop of Durham, to Lord Burleigh. \" Right Honorable, \" Maie it please your good lordshipp to be advertised, that I have lately caused the lady Katherine Gray, widdow, one of AVestmoreland's daughters, to be apprehended by Mr. John Conyers, the sheriff of this countie, and Mr. Robert Tailbois, one of the justices of peace, and have admitted her to the safe custodie of Christopher Glover, gaoler of Duresm Castle, to be kept forthcoming in his private house nighe the gaole.

He, however, seems to have been in pos session of his inheritance after the Restoration, but so loaded with the consequences of parlia mentary severity, that he was obliged first to mortgage, and then to sell his estate at Greencroft to the Claverings about 1670. In this family the estate has since rested, and is the property and residence of Sir Thomas Clavering, Bart. Iveston. This is an ancient village, standing on the exposed face of a hill, about three miles north-west from Lanchester. The township contains thirteen farms, a public house, and a few mechanics. Under Boldon Book, Iveston pays two marks, provides a milch cow, ploughs one acre and a half of the lord's land at Lanchester, attends the great chase with two greyhounds, and undertakes the carriage of wine with a wain of eight oxen. Soon after, the charters relating to this place mention a family bearing the local name ; and before the date of Hatfield's Survey, Iveston became the possession of the hospital of Kepyer. After the dissolution, John Cockburn sold his manor of Iveston to John Heath, Esq., warden of the Fleet. The heir of Heath married into the Tempest family ; and the estate is still vested in Lady Londonderry, the representative of both houses. Crook-Hall, now a farm-house, but formerly the seat of the Bakers, stands a little to the west of Iveston. By Boldon Book, it was a free manor, and, it seems, belonged to the De la Leys, lords of Witton, who, soon after the date of the record, gave it to the church of Durham. In Hatfield's time, the estate belonged to the Kirkleys, from whom it passed through the Thorntons to the descendants of Richard Lord Lumley. In 158S, it had become the property of the Shaf- path lordship to her majestie, by therle's attaynder, doe adjoin together, and therefore, I thinke, the lady Graye did there mean, for the tyme, to sett up her rest soe nigh her father's olde tenants ; the house itself also (standinge towards the fells, and nigh a pretty wodde) strongly built of newe, with many shifting con trivances, may yelde good opportunitie to lodge and intertayne, not only other ill guests, but, percase, thearle himself, si et quatenus.

D. toes, who, about fifty years afterwards, sold it to George Baker (afterwards Sir George Baker, Knight*), in whose descendants the estate is still vested. * Sir George Baker was the son of Oswald Baker, of Durham. His first preferment was the office of Clerk of the Durham Chancery, which his father-in-law, William Smith, Esq., resigned in his favour. He afterwards filled the honourable office of recorder of Newcastle upon Tyne, a situation generally held by one of the first provincial lawyers in the north, and which as usually leads to the establishment of a handsome family estate. In Sir George Baker's case, however, matters went otherwise. When Newcastle was be leaguered by the Scots in 1644, Sir George (who probably on this occasion received knighthood from the Marquis of Newcastle) was one of the principal persons who conducted the defence of the place, which, abandoned by the regular troops, was defended for nine weeks by the inhabitants under the orders of the mayor and aldermen. The town was stormed on the 19th October. Sir John Marley (mayor), Sir Nicho las Cole, and Sir George Baker retreated to the Castle, and held out till the 27th, when they capitulated on honourable terms. The subsequent adventures of Sir George Baker's life are not recorded. He died at Kingston upon Hull, and it should seem from some expression in his epitaph, in circumstances not over opulent. Indeed, he almost ruined his family by his exertions in favour of Charles I. He borrowed large sums on his own credit, and sent the money to the king, or laid it out in his service. He was buried with the military honours due to a cavalier, in the great church at Hull. Thomas Baker, a learned antiquary, was grandson of the above Sir George Baker, and son of George Baker, Esq., of Crook-Hall, by Margaret, daughter of Thomas Forster, Esq., of Adderstone, co. of North umberland. He was born at Crook- Hall, Mth September, 1656, and was educated at the free-school at Durham, under Mr. Battersby, many years master, and thence removed, with his elder brother George, to St. John's College, Cambridge, and admitted, the former as pensioner, the latter as fellow-commoner, under the tuition of Mr. Sanderson, July 9, 1674. He proceeded B. A. 1677; M. A. 1681 ; was elected fellow, March, 1680; ordained deacon by Bishop Compton of London, December 20, 1685 ; priest by Bishop Bar low of Lincoln, December 19, 1686. Dr. AVatson, tutor of the college, who was nominated, but not yet consecrated, bishop of St. David's, offered to take him for his chaplain, which he declined, probably on the prospect of a like offer from Crewe, lord bishop of Durham, which he soon after accepted. His lordship collated him to the rectory of Long-Newton, in his diocese, and the same county, June, 1687; and, as Dr. Grey was informed by some of the bishop's family, intended to have given him that of Sedgefield, worth six or seven hundred pounds a year, with a golden prebend, had he not incurred his displeasure, and left his family, for refusing to read King James II.'s declaration for liberty of conscience. Mr. Baker himself gives the following account of this affair : \u2014 \" AVhen the king's declaration was appointed to be read, the most condescending thing the bishop ever did was coming to my chambers (remote from his) to prevail with me to read it in his chapel at Auckland, which I could not do, having wrote to my curate not to read it at my living at Long-Newton. But he did prevail with the curate at Auckland to read it in his church, when the bishop was present to countenance the performance. AVhen all was over, the bishop (as penance I presume) ordered me to go to the dean, to require him to make a return to court of the names of all such as did not read it, which I did, though I was one ofthe number.\" But this bishop, who disgraced Mr. Baker for this refusal, and was excepted out of King AA'illiam's pardon, took the oaths to that king, and kept his bishopric till his death. Sir, Baker resigned Long- Newton August 1, 1690, refusing to take the oaths; and retired to his fellow ship at St John's, in which he was protected till January 20, 1717, when, with one-and-twenty others, he was dispossessed of it. This hurt him most of all, not for the profit he received from it, but that some whom he thought his sincerest friends came so readily into the new measures, particularly Dr. Robert Jenkin, the master, who wrote a defence of the profession of Dr. Lake, bishop of Chichester, concerning the new oaths and passive obedience, and resigned his precentorship of Chichester, and vicarage of Waterbeach, in the county of Cambridge. Mr. Baker could not persuade himself but he might have shewn the same indulgence to his scruples on that occasion, as he had done before while himself was of that way of thinking. Of all his sufferings, none, therefore, gave him so much uneasiness. In a letter from Dr. Jenkin, addressed to Mr. Baker, fellow of St, John's, he made the following remark on the superscription : \u2014 \" I was so then ; I little thought it should be by him that I am now no fellow; but God is just, and I am a sinner.\" After the passing of the registering act, 1723, he was desired to register his annuity of \u00a340, which the last act required before it was amended and explained. Though this annuity, left him by his father for his fortune, with \u00a320 per annum out of his collieries by his elder brother from the day of his death, August, 1699, for the remaining part of the lease, which determined at AVhitsuntide, 1723, was now his whole subsistence."], [361, "LANCHESTER. 225 High Brooms, in this township, is the residence of Mr. John Smith, the representative of a re spectable Catholic family, and who has attained to a mellow and venerable old age. He is the he could not be prevailed on to secure himself against the act, but wrote thus in answer to his friend : \u2014 \" I thank you for your kind concern for me ; and yet I was very well apprized of the late act, but do not think it worth while at this age, and under these infirmities, to give myself and friends so much trouble about it. I do not think that any living besides myself knows surely that my annuity is charged upon any part of my cousin Baker's estate ; or if they do, I can hardly believe that any one, for so poor and uncertain a reward, will turn informer; or if any one be found so poorly mean and base, I am so much acquainted with the hardships of the world, that I can bear it. I doubt not I shall live under the severest treatment of my enemies; or, if I cannot live, I am sure I shall die, and that's comfort enough to me. Isa convey- ance will secure us against the act, I am willing to make such a conveyance to them, not fraudulent or in trust, but in as full and absolute a manner as words can make it ; and if that shall be thought good security, I desire you will have such a conveyance drawn and sent me by the post, and I'll sign it and leave it with any friend you shaU appoint till it can be sent to you.\" He retained a lively resentment of his deprivations, and wrote himself in all his books, as well as in those which he gave to the college library, \"socius ejectus,\" and in some, \" ejectus rector.\" Mr. Baker continued to reside in the college as commoner-master till his death, which happened July 2, 1740, of a paralytic stroke, being found on the floor of his chamber. In the afternoon of June 29. being alone in his chamber, he was struck with a slight apoplectic fit, which abating a little, he recovered his senses, and knew all about him, who were his nephew Burton, Drs. Bedford and Heberden. He seemed perfectly satisfied and resigned ; and when Dr. Bedford desired him to take some medicine then ordered, he declined it, saying, he would only take his usual sustenance, which his bed-maker knew the times and quantities of giving; he was thankful for the affection and care his friends shewed him, but, hoping the time of his dissolution was at hand, would by no means endeavour to retard it. His disorder increased, and the third day from this seizure he departed. He was buried in St. John's outer chapel, near the monument of Mr. Ashton, who founded his fellowship. No memorial has yet been erected over him, he having forbid- den it in his wiU. By temperance and tranquillity he had protracted his existence to his 84th year. For many years he was almost a recluse, and seldom went farther than the college walks, unless to a coffee-house in an evening after chapel, where he spent an hour with great cheerfulness in conversing with a select num- ber of friends Being appointed one of the executors of his elder brother's will, by which a large sum was bequeathed to pious uses, he prevailed on the other two executors, who were his other biother Francis and the Hon. Charles Montague, to lay out \u00a31310 of the money upon an estate to be settled upon St. John's College for six exhibitioners. Mr. Masters gives a singular instance of his unbiassed integrity in the disposal of these exhibitions. His friend Mr. AVilliams, rector of Doddington, had applied to stir. Baker for one of them for his son, and received the following answer : \u2014 \" AVorthy sir, I can assure you I am not alone in the disposal of these exhibitions, nor is it any qualification by the settlement to be the son of a clergyman. In the disposal of them I have commonly had regard to those that want them most, and I thank God that is not your son's case. But I will do him that right to say, he wants no other qualifications,\" &c. Mr. Baker likewise gave the college \u00a3100 for the consideration of \u00a36 a year (then legal interest) for his life; and to the library several choice books, both printed and MS.; medals, and coins; besides what he left to it by his will, which were \"all such books, printed and MS., as he had, and were wanting there.\" All that Mr. Baker printed was, 1. \"Reflections on Learning, shewing the Insufficiency thereof in its seve- ral particulars, in order to evince the Usefulness and Necessity of Revelation, London, 1710,\" which went through eight editions; and Mr. Boswell, in his \"Method of Study,\" ranks it among the English classics for purity of style ; a character perhaps too high, yet it is a very ingenious work, and was at one time one of the most popular books in our language. 2. \" The Preface to Bishop Fisher's Funeral Sermon for Mar- garet Countess of Richmond and Derby, 1708;\" both without his name.

There is an indifferent print of him by Simon, from a memoriter picture; but a very good likeness of him by C. Bridges. Vertue was privately engaged to draw his picture by stealth. Dr. Grey had his picture, of which stir. Burton had a copy by stir. Ritz. The Society of Antiquaries have another portrait of him. It was his custom, in every book he had, or read, to write observations and an account of the author. Of these a considerable number are at St. John's College, and several in the Bodleian library, among Dr. Rawlinson's bequests. A fair transcript of his select MS. observations on Dr. Drake's edition of Archbishop Parker, 1729, was some time ago in the hands of Mr. Nichols. Dr. John Bedford of Durham had stir. Baker's copy of the \" Hereditary Right,\" greatly enriched by him. Dr. Grey, who was advised with about the disposal of the books, had his copy of Spelman's Glossary, stir. Crow married a sister of stir. Baker's nephew, Burton ; and, on Burton's death intestate in the autumn after his uncle, became possessed of every thing. * His brother, the late Rev. Thomas Smith, D. D., bishop of Bolina, and Aricar Apostolic of the Northern District, was born at the Brooms 21st March, 1763. After completing his twelfth year, his parents sent him to the Catholic school of Sedgley Park in Staffordshire, where he remained above two years, during which time he made considerable progress in the Latin and French languages. He next (in 1778) was re moved to the English college at Douay, where he advanced rapidly in the mathematical and grammatical classes. Indeed, such was the opinion entertained of his talents and diligence, that, contrary to usual cus tom, he was chosen procurator four years before he was ordained to the priesthood, which was necessarily delayed until he had entered his twenty-fifth year. He received the order from Conzier, bishop of Arras, afterwards chaplain to the present deposed Charles X., then Count d'Artois, and residing at Holyrood House. AVhen the French Revolution commenced, Dr. Smith had held the Professorship of Philosophy upwards of a year. From this situation he was removed to prison, where he continued during sixteen months, at the end of which period he was released and permitted to return to England. He had the chief care of sending most of the young students to their anxious and afflicted parents. On arriving at the Blue Boar, Holburn, his party presented a most ludicrous appearance, most of them being attired in the old cast-off coats and trowsers which the soldiers had given them, while he himself was dressed in a rough sailor's jacket. The landlady naturally scrupled to retain such a motley group ; but when so many of the nobility and gen try crowded to congratulate them on their arrival, their hostess became wonderfully polite and condescend ing. This was in March, 1795 ; and on the death of the Rev. John Lodge, in November the same year, Dr. Smith succeeded to the mission at Durham. He was consecrated the coadjutor of Bishop William Gib son, on the 11th March, 1810, by the title of Bishop of Bolina, a city of Achaia. The ceremony was per formed by the Right Rev. Dr. Poynter, at the college of St Edmund, Old Hall Green, Hertfordshire. On the death of his venerable colleague, Dr. Gibson, June 2, 1821, he succeeded to the charge of this extensive diocese. He resided chiefly at the city of Durham, Ushaw College, and the family residence of the Brooms. After a long and painful illness, which he bore with great patience and resignation to the will of his Creator, he breathed his last at Ushaw College, at eight o'clock in the evening of Saturday, July 30, 1831. His mortal remains were deposited, on the Tuesday following, in the burial-ground attached to that college, near to those of his predecessor, Dr. William Gibson. Bishop Smith was the tenth Catholic Vicar Apostolic that has sat in the chair of the Northern District. He was a man of great learning and piety, an excellent classical scholar, and a profound theologian. He was mild in his manners, but firm in his resolves ; and has left behind him, among his clergy, a character, as a bishop and a priest, which will be long remembered with regret and admiration, and which will furnish to the young ecclesiastic an excellent model for imitation. Thomas Penswick, who succeeds Bishop Smith in the Northern Vicunas, was one ofthe first that was ordained at Crook Hall after the college settled there. He afterwards served on the mission for upwards of twenty years at Chester in Cheshire and at Liverpool. He was then chosen coadjutor to Bishop Smith ; and on June 29, 1S24, was consecrated at Ushaw College by the title of Bishop of Eurojium. + Died at Pontop Hall, November 9, 1790, the Rev.

In 1474, Robert Rhodes died seized of the manor of Collierley and of land called Greenlaw. Queen Elizabeth, in 1571, granted lands in Collierly to Sir George Bowes, who conveyed certain tenements in Collierly to Robert Pye, William Parker, Cuthbert Burrel, and Robert Cooke, of Newcastle, merchant. There was formerly a chapel here, which has long lain in ruins. Collierly-Dykes, Dipton, and Pontop, are villages in this township which owe their existence to the neighbouring coal-mines. Dipton, a colliery village, contains five public houses, two grocers and drapers, with butchers, tailors, and other persons engaged in avocations necessary to a populous district. This place is the residence of Thomas Fenwick, Esq., principal agent to Pontop Pike coUiery, and author of an invaluable treatise on Subterraneous Surveying. Dipton occurs in the earbest inquest on the Gildfords, 1341. Pontop adjoins a lofty pike, called Pontopike, and from which its name is evidently derived. This manor, in 1361, belonged to the Gourleys; but, in 1409, it was alienated to Sir AVilliam Claxton, whose four coheirs shared his estates, when Pontop was allotted to the Elmden family, whose heiress carried this estate to her husband, Sir AVilliam Bulmer.

This township lies above four miles west from Lanchester, and contains six farms, lying in West and East Butsfield and Butsfield Burn. By Hatfield's Survey, this estate seems to have given name to a family. Sixty-nine acres were held by the Heswells of the bishop in capite, by homage and foreign service and 33s. rent ; for the non-performance of which, the lands were seized by the lord under a writ of cessavit, and it does not appear that they were ever restored. Woodlands, the property and residence of Thomas AVhite, Esq., affords a pleasing instance of the triumphs of art and industry over the most difficult and discouraging obstacles to general im provement. Before, and after the act for enclosing the moors and wastes within Lanchester parish was obtained, much discussion took place respecting the prudence of such a measure. Many con sidered the attempt as utterly hopeless; and tlie commissioners sold 1551 acres for about .\u00a38174, Another allotment of 300 acres was sold, subject to a rent-charge of .P30 a year. Thomas AVhite, Esq., of Retford, in the county of Nottingham, was the principal purchaser. He planted one half of the parcel of three hundred acres with forest trees ; and, under the shelter of another plantation of two hundred and eleven acres, he planted sixteen acres with fruit trees, which continue to flou rish. Thus, by this gentleman's spirited exertions, a vast, lofty, and barren expanse of country, where the perplexed traveller wandered in ambiguous tracts, is now enclosed and cloathed with rising plantations. His example has been successfully followed ; and the barren Fells are in tersected with good roads; innumerable buildings are scattered over a formerly dreary prospect; merchandise has now an expeditious passage to the villages, which were, previous to this inclosure and cultivation, almost inaccessible except in summer; and the inhabitants, greatly increased in numbers, obtain with facility the principal comforts of life. \" The ground,\" according to Mr. AVhite's own statement, \" in a state of nature, was covered with ling, fern, broom, and bad grass, and rushes in the wet places; the high parts very bad land, channelly, and not many inches from a grit-stone rock : lower down the hills the land is of a better quality, but was then cold and swampy from want of draining. Tlie features of this inclosure are rather gentle than bold, inclining from the north and south towards a narrow valley, which conti nues from east to west through the adjacent country; over which a small trout stream meandered in so many mazes as choaked its own progress, and rendered the whole of this small valley, con taining about eleven acres of my best and most sheltered land, almost useless.\" Woodlands HaU is an excellent mansion-house ; and the pleasure-grounds and gardens, which have been created in the midst of a wilderness, evince much taste.

This township, containing nine farms, is situated on the western verge of the parish, and adjoins Rowley in the parish of Muggleswick.

In 1349, Richard de Chilton gave this manor to Sir John Stryveln, who, in 1382, alienated it to John Nevill, Lord of Raby, by whom it was granted to AViUiam of Lanchester, vicar of St. Oswald's, and WiUiam Graystanes, chaplain. The latter survived his colleague, and conveyed the estate to the dean and chapter of Durham, previous to which time the almoner of the convent held lands here. Heley Chapel is mentioned in the foundation charter of the collegiate church of Lanchester, 1283. In 1648, the parliamentary commissioners did \" think fit and certifie that Heleyfield, in Lanchester parish, be annexed to Muggleswick, and united to be a parish church.\" Alansford, on the Darwent, is conjectured to have derived its name from Alan de Chilton, the old Lord of Heleyfield.

In fact, it is much easier to plant with decent effect in a tame, cultivated, inclosed country, than in a wild, untouched district, where it requires almost more than mortal skill to prevent the hard outlines of art from coming in rude and desperate contact with the eternal lines marked by nature herself. As the trees rise desolate and bare of underwood, the mischief increases, and it seems to require the mellowing touch of a century before an artificial forest can be received in lawful exchange forthe ladyfern, the heath, and the long yellow broom.\" * There is a strange story of George Maddison's death being occasioned by poison, at an entertainment in Paris, which was intended for the Duke of Manchester, the English ambassador. \" Far off, on the banks of the Seine, Thy darling, thy Maddison dies.\" Ode lo the Darwent, in Bell's Rhymes of Northern Bards. This report probably originated in the national prejudices of the inhabitants of Darwentdale, and in their grief for the unexpected death of their amiable and accomplished countryman.

This chapelry, township, and hamlet, is situated in a narrow- vale, between the branches of a small Beck which runs eastward to the river Browney, about four miles south-south-west of Lanches ter. The village contains a few straggling houses. Here are four farmholds, two public houses, a corn-mill, a school, and a few mechanics. The chapel is a small building, seated on a bleak hill to the north. In 1221, Philip de St. Helena, rector of Lanchester, granted to Satley chapelry a gene ral release of all tithes, oblations, and altarage, within Satley and Butsfield. Satley afterwards became a mere chapel of ease to Lanchester, from which it was again severed on receiving an aug mentation of \u00a3200 from Queen Anne's Bounty in 1768. The living is a perpetual curacy, not in charge, of the certified value of J?ll, 4s. ; and the perpetual curate of Lanchester is patron. In 1324, Robert de GreenweU held the vill of Satley of the see of Durham in chief, by 40s. rent, and 13s. 4d. in addition for the manor-mill. Subsequently, the families of Merely, Chambre, Hesswell, Millot, and Rippon, held lands in Satley. Broomshields, under Hatfield's Survey, was divided into various parcels ; but, for nearly four centuries, it has been possessed by the Greenwell family. Peter Grenewell of Bromesheles occurs in 1488. Broomshield House is a neat, convenient mansion, rebuilt by the present proprietor, John Greenwell, Esq., who has made several judicious improvements on the estate. Broomshields Cottage is the residence of the Misses GreenweU. West Sheet, or AVest Broomshields, was long the inheritance of the Darnells, but was alienated to the GreenweU family by the late AViUiam Darnell, merchant in Newcastle.* Langlei- This township, which contains nine farms, is distant about five miles north-by-west from Dur ham. According to Boldon Book, Arco, Bishop Pudsey's steward, held Langley, one moiety of which was presented to him by the bishop, who had purchased it, and the other part he held under the rent of half a mark. The estate reverted by escheat to the see of Durham, and was granted to Henry de l'lsle, one of the early Lords of AArynyard. Before 1306, the manor was again vested in the see ; and the Patriarch Anthony granted it to Henry Lord Percy. Under the Survey7, it is held by Richard le Scroop, Knight, and continued in possession of the house of Scroop during many generations. \" Langley,\" observes Surtees, \" if the armorial shields which still decorate her falling halls may be believed, was the residence of Henry Lord Scroop (who married Isabel Dacre) in the reign of Henry ArIIL, and was probably the occasional seat of his descendants till the extinction of male * AVilliam Darnell, of AArest Sheel, by will, in 1674, appoints for his daughter Elizabeth (besides her marriage-portion) the ancient provision, on her marriage-day, of a bridewaine : that is, a wain or waggon, with articles of use and luxury, \" inside and outside gear and plenishing,\" for the young couple. The bridewaine was usually crowned with boughs and flowers, and the horses or oxen which drew it decorated with ribbons and bride-favours. It was brought around to the houses of relations and friends, who contri buted what they pleased as a marriage-present.

The Earl of Sunderland, pushing one of his remote heirs-at-law to the end of the entail, and omitting the other, settled his estates on his three illegitimate daughters : 1. Mary, wife to Charles Marquis of Winchester, first Duke of Bolton ; Elizabeth, wife to Thomas Savage, Earl Rivers ; and Annabella, married to John Howe, of Gloucestershire, Esq. Langley, with much more important estates, fell, on the partition, to the marquis,* and in his descendants it rested till 175-, when AViUiam Powlett, son of Lord AVilliam Powlett (second son of the first Duke of Bolton), sold the estate to Henry Lamb ton, Esq.,\" whose representative, Lord Durham, is the present proprietor. The ruins of Langley Hall stand on the southern slope of a hill, which commands a rich and varied view over the vale of Brune, having the cathedral and the Durham hills in the distance. The hall has been protected partly by a moat, and partly by the Langley Burn, which turns the ancient water-mill below, and descends through a pleasant dell into the Brune. Surtees mentions a very small chamber, with access to it concealed in the thickness of the wall, near the south-east angle of the chief mass of building. But the huge mantle-piece of the great hall, described by Hutchinson, is removed. -J- It is difficult to trace the ancient arrangements of this old mansion, part of which is now converted into a farm-house. * Of this Marquis of Winchester (who selected his wife's castle of Bolton for his ducal title) the follow ing strange account occurs in Sir John Reresby's Memoirs, p. 247.\" (H>87) \"In the midst ofthe impending dangers which seemed to threaten us, there was a nobleman, the Marquis of AVinchester, who had by his conduct persuaded some people to think him mad, tho' he certainly acted upon principles of great human prudence. This gentleman passing through Yorkshire, in his way to London, I went to pay him a visit. He had four coaches and an hundred horses in his retinue, and staid ten days at a house he borrowed in our parts. His custom was to dine at six or seven in the evening, and his meal always lasted till six or seven the next morning ; during which he sometimes drank ; sometimes he listened to music ; sometimes he fell into discourse; sometimes he took tobacco, and sometimes he ate his victuals; while the company had free choice to sit or rise, to go or come, to sleep or not. The dishes and bottles were all the time before them on the table ; and when it was morning he would hunt or hawk if the weather was fair ; if not, he would dance, go to bed at eleven, and repose himself till the evening. Notwithstanding this irregularity, he was a man of great sense, and though, as I just now said, some took him to be mad, it is certain his meaning was to keep himself out of the way of more serious censure in these ticklish days, and preserve his estates, which he took great care of.\" This strange marquis (whose dinner hour, by the by, would now imply nothing extraordinary, were it not followed by so long and irregular a session) was son of the loyal Marquis John, who garrisoned his house of Basing for King Charles, and wrote with a diamond on every pane of glass, Aimez Loyaulle. The above said Marquis Charles entered heartily into the Revolution ; and his eldest son, Charles, the second duke, went to Holland (soon after the date of Reresby's story), and returned in the Prince of Orange's fleet. t It is supposed that Henry Lord Scroop, the eleventh Lord of Bolton, and who died 25th Henry VIII., built the hall of which the present ruins remain. This is inferred from an inscription copied by Mr. Robert Hutchinson in 177L and published in the Antiquarian Repository in 1775- \"At Langley Hall, in the parish of Lanchester, is a mantle-piece of stone, over a large fire-place, with an inscription thereon in capi tal letters. The inscription relates to Henry Lord Scrope, of Bolton, in Yorkshire, who married Margaret, the daughter of Thomas Lord Dacre, of Gilsland, in Cumberland. The arms on the second quarter are those of Tibetot, or Tiptoft, an heiress of which family married an ancestor of the said Henry Lord Scrope, whose coat of arms are engraved with hers ; and the same are depicted in the upper windows on the south part of the parish church of Richmond, in Yorkshire. The escutcheon, by the division on the wife's side, on the right hand, looks as if intended for him and his two wives, for he was twice married ; but the arms on the side of the wives are so worn away that they are not distinguishable.

They contain three yeomen and twelve farmers. Burnhop lies on the Browney, and the name is sup posed to be derived from the ridge that rises from the Gills or hollow of the Brune or Biowney. Hamsteels stands further westward, and only a short distance from Esh. Under Hatfield's Sur vey, Burnhop and Hamsteels were occupied by a number of tenants, some of whom were free. Holmsibe, A township containing nineteen farms, situated near the south-eastern verge of the parish, and six miles north-west of Durham. Holm Hall, as the name indicates, stands in a hollow flat, and must formerly have been a gloomy mansion, immersed in wood and morass. Part of the original build ing is remaining. The lights are narrow, and strongly guarded with mullions and iron bars. The gabel-ends have been taken down, and the house has received additions at such distant dates as to present a confused mass of Ul assorted buildings. The ruins of the chapel form the north side of the old court-yard. The moat includes a ruined orchard ; and at a short distance to the west stands another old building, defended by its separate moat. New Holmside Hall is a modern house, built some time subsequent to 1682. Both halls are occupied by farmers. Under Boldon Book, the estate was held by one mark rent, and the service of watching the bishop's deer for forty days in fence-time and rutting season, and by the carriage of wine with a draught of four oxen. Richard de Holmside occurs as the Lord of Holmside shortly after the foundation of Finchale, about the middle of the thirteenth century. A century after this, the Umfrevilles held the estate (with AATiitley and other adjoining lands) by the same services. It continued in the possession of this wide- branching family until Sir Robert Umfreville, from a mul titude of coheirs, selected Rowland Tempest, the husband of his grand-niece Isabel, and by will ordered to estate him in the manors of Holmside and AVitley. Robert Tempest, being engaged in the rebellion of the northern earls, was attainted. In 1573, Queen Elizabeth granted to Henry Gate, Knt., the manor and park of Holmside, to hold of the manor of East Greenwich, under \u00a34 crown rent. In 1595, the manor was transferred from Sir Henry's heir to Henry Jackson, Esq. ; and, in 1613, Sir Timothy Whittingham* purchased the manor of Margaret Hawkins, widow. something like bars or barry were in them : bars were in the arms of Greystock.

His dispositions by will or deed occasioned some division of the family estates. New Holmside Hall, and some portion of lands and tithes, were vested in the late John Hunter, of the Hermitage, Esq., and Miss Cookson, who represent the family of Whittingham. Old Holmside Hall was purchased by Robert Spearman, Esq., of Old Acres, and is now the property of Thomas Wilkinson, Esq., of Witton Castle, in right of his wife, Hannah-Elizabeth Spearman. Ousterley, from the time of Hatfield's Survey until 1428, was in the possession ofthe Birtleys, when the estate was sold to Thomas Chancellor, Esq., who created a long family entail. It was afterwards vested in the family of Hull. Whitley, in 1339, belonged to John de AVhitley. At the time of Hatfield's Survey, it was in the possession of the Umfreville family, and probably followed the descent of the Holmside estate. Whitley Green is a small neat village on the Conebeck, and lies partly in the parish of Chester-le- Street. Cornsay and Hedley These places, which form one township, are situated at the south-eastern extremity of the parish, and were included in the north-west division of Darlington AVard until they were annexed to the west division of Chester Ward by order of the Easter Sessions, 1830. Their early history was united under Boldon Book, when Walter the Chamberlain held Cornsay and Hedley by the pay ment of two marks, carrying wine with a draught of twelve oxen, and providing five chords at the bishop's great chase. In 1350, William de Raw, or Will o' the Raw, died seized of half the manor of Cornsay. This moiety became the estate of the Earls of Westmoreland, and continued so till the forfeiture. The property, at a later date, has been scattered. Cornsay, at present, is occupied by seventeen farmers. Cornsay Hall stands five miles north- west-by- west of Wolsingham. This, with the most consi derable estate, has been, for above three centuries, the property of the Taylors, a respectable Catholic family. Thomas Taylor, of Cornsay House, Esq., the lineal representative of the first purchaser in the reign of Edward AT., married a daughter of Sir Thomas Tancred, of Borough bridge, Bart. He died August 15, 1790, leaving issue several sons, of whom the last survivor, the Rev. Thomas Taylor, died December, 1818. The family estate is now vested in his sisters.

This chapelry is divided from Ryton by the Darwent on the north, from Tanfield chapelry and from Lanchester by the Pont Burn on the east, and by the Darwent from Northumberland on the west : the chapelry of Muggleswick forms the south-west boundary, and that of Ebchester the north-west. The chapelry includes three constableries : 1. Medomsley, with Bradley, Byerside, Darwencote, and Hamsterley. 2. Benfieldside, including Snows-Green, Shotley Bridge, the Law, See. 3. Conset and Knightsley. Medomsley. Medomsley, at the date of the Boldon Book, was a free manor, held by a monied rent. \"Wil li am , Lord of Medomsley, whose name occurs in several charters, is conjectured to have been an cestor of the Feltons, who were owners of the manor at the time of the earliest inquisitions of the Durham Chancery. Edmund Hastings obtained Medomsley and Hamsterley by marriage with the heiress of the Feltons ; aud his grandson and heir left a son and heir, Roger Hastings, Knt., of Fenwick Tower, who sold his manor and vill of Medomsley, before 1st August, 1490, to George Carr, merchant, of Newcastle, ancestor of Carr of Cocken. This family was in possession of the estate in 1656. The Hunters obtained property in Medomsley in 1584, which was gradually extended and divided amongst different branches of the family.* The Almoner of the church of Durham held some small parcels here at a very early date. * Christopher Hunter, an eminent antiquary and physician, was the only son of Thomas Hunter, of Me domsley, Gent., by his second wife, Margaret Readshaw. He was born in July, 1675, and was eaily left an orphan ; his mother dying before he was eight months old, and his father when he was only nine years old. AVhen very young, he was sent to the Free Grammar-school of Kepyer in Houghton-le-Spring. In his eighteenth year, he was removed to the university of Cambridge, and was admitted pensioner of St. John's College in 1692, under the tuition of Mr. Thomas Brown, and of the eminent scholar and antiquary Thomas Baker, noticed under Crook Hall in the parish of Lanchester, and whose sister, Margaret, was the wife of John Hunter, Christopher's elder brother by his father's first wife. Severe attention to his acade mical studies, and distinguished regularity of conduct, soon rendered young Hunter a favourite pupil of Mr. Baker, from whom he probably imbibed a taste for antiquarian pursuits. In 1698, he took his degree of B. M-, soon after which he retired to his native county, and fixed himself in medical practice at Stockton on-Tees. In 1702, Dr. Hunter was married, at Durham Abbey, to Elizabeth, one of the two daughters"], [371, "MEDOMSLEY. 235 This village is pleasantly seated on a dry, elevated, and healthy situation, surrounded by rich, well-cultivated lands, and commanding a fine view of the beautiful vale of the Darwent, and of the and coheirs of John Elrington, Esq., of Espersheels. With this lady Dr. Hunter received a considerable landed estate, and he had also a very handsome provision settled on him by his father. To these resources were added the emoluments of a respectable practice ; yet, with the common fate of generous and studious men, he seemed destined never to be rich. Dr. Hunter, a few years after his marriage, removed from Stockton to Durham, a place in many respects more congenial to his taste. The library of the dean and chapter, stored with sound history and topography, and with scarce and expensive books of reference, stood open before him. It is said that his various literary projects were abandoned, in consequence of his being excluded from this library for having accidentally thrown a bottle of ink over a valuable copy of Magna Charta. \" I sincerely hope,\" says Surtees, \" for the honour of all parties concerned, this story is apocryphal.\" Dr. Hunter's industry and success in making researches on Roman ground is attested by the numerous altars he excavated and deposited in the cathedral library at Durham. His valuable local knowledge was of the highest use to Horsley iii compiling his \" Britannia Romana,\" and to Gordon in his \" Iter Septen- trionale.\" His correspondence with Dr. Lister may be seen in Nichols's Literary Anecdotes. He also rendered considerable assistance to Mr. AVilkins in compiling his Concilia ; and Bourne was much indebted to him in writing his \" Historv of Newcastle-\" Dr. Hunter, at one time, intended to compile a History of the Diocese of Durham ; and, in 1743, he published proposals for printing by subscription, in 2 vols. 4to., \" Antiquitates Parochiales Dioces. Dunelm. hucusque inedit\u00e6,\" collected from the archives ofthe church of Durham, the Chancery Rolls there, and the Records in the Consistory Court. AVith a view probably to the completion of this work, Dr. Hunter was entrusted by Thomas Bowes, of Streatlam, Esq., with the Bowes Papers (which are yet unpublished), containing the correspondence of Sir Robert Bowes, Elizabeth's am- bassador in Scotland, and his brother Sir George Bowes, Knight Marshall. Dr. Hunter's intended work, however, never saw the light. His actual publications were confined to a republication of \" Davies's Rites and Monuments ofthe Church of Durham, 1733;\" and \"An Illustration of Mr. Daniel Neale's History of the Puritans, in the article of Peter Smart, A. M., from original Papers, with Remarks, 1736.\" His MS. collections for his intended topographical work were extremely numerous. Two volumes of transcripts from the Chartularies of the church of Durham, written in an extremely neat hand, and several loose papers, are in the cathedral library. Another volume was in the possession of the late John Hunter, Esq., of the Hermitage ; but it is feared that many more are irretrievably lost. In the spring of 1757, Dr. Hunter retired from Durham to his wife's estate at Unthank, in the parish of Shotley, where he died in the night between the 12th and 13th of July following, and was buried in Shot- ley church, on a tablet in which is the following inscription : \u2014 \" Here lye the remains of Christopher Hun- ter, M. D., a learned and judicious Antiquary and Physician. He was the only child of Thomas Hunter, of Medomsley, Gent., by Margaret his second wife. He married Elizabeth, one of the daughters and co- heiresses of John Elrington, of Aspershields, Esq., by whom he had two sons and a daughter. He died 13th of July, An. Dom. 1757, in the 83d year of his age.\" Surtees informs us that \" in his person Dr. Hunter was slender and well formed, somewhat above the middle size ; extremely neat and plain in his dress, and of mild and conciliating manners. His Use was a pattern of simple and inflexible integrity; and his remarkable moderation in respect of his professional fees, and his extreme disinterestedness in all matters of worldly economy, kept and left him poor. In his diet Dr. Hunter observed the strictest temperance. After his first settling in the country, he had occasionally indulged in conviviality ; a severe fall from his horse after an excess of this sort produced an entire reform : he determined on his recovery never to taste any thing stronger than water, and to the end of his life he persevered most religiously in this resolution. Therefore 'his age was as a lusty winter \u2014 frosty but kindly.' To supply the want of fermented liquors, he had recourse to the somewhat immoderate use of coffee, drink ing frequently twenty-four cups in a day. To this practice were probably owing the slight epileptic fits to which he was subject, which left him in a few minutes as well as before. With this exception, Dr. Hunter preserved his health and faculties unimpaired to extreme age, and seems to have completed the full stadium which nature had appointed for him.\" John Hunter of Benfieldside, son of Thomas Hunter of Horsington, married Mary Smith : their descend ants were Quakers- John's brother, Cuthbert Hunter of Medomsley (bur. 30th April, 1697), had issue Peter, Thomas, and Robert, whose son, Cuthbert Hunter of Medomsley, Esq.

The mansion-house of the elder branch of the Hunter family stands near the east end of the village, and is occupied by Simpson Brown, Gent.

The entire township contains fifteen or sixteen farms. The Church is superior to many in this district, and, from its lofty scite, may be viewed at a considerable distance. It consists of a nave and chancel of equal width, without tower or aisles. The nave is about 65 feet in length, and 22 feet in breadth, and has two double, and one single light on the south, and one small light to the west : there are no lights on the north. The chan cel, which is 35 feet in length, opens from the nave under a fine pointed arch, springing from cor bels. The east window is formed of three lancet lights, the piers ornamented with slender shafts or columns, belted in the midst with foliated capitals. On the south there are two small pointed windows, and one narrow double light. From the remains of corbels and ornaments scattered over the chancel, it seems that this part of the structure was some time more highly ornamented. A sort of decorated niche is closed up in the south wall. The font is an old stone basin, with round mouldings, resting on a stone shaft and square pedestal.

The following is the report of the Commissioners for inquiring concerning Charities : \u2014 \" In the Parlia mentary Returns of 1786 it is stated, that John Hunter (in 1675), John Cuming, and Mary Burton, gave several sums to the poor of Medomsley, amounting to \u00a330. From an entry in a book containing the over seers' accounts for the township of Medomsley, under the date of 1785, it appears that \u00a320 was then in the hands of John Hunter and Cuthbert Hunter. Cuthbert Hunter died about 30 years ago, and was succeeded in his property by his son, General Martin Hunter; and his agent, Cuthbert Surtees, has for several years paid 10s. yearly to Miss Hunter, sister of General M. Hunter, residing at Medomsley, by whom the said sum has been distributed to poor women at her discretion. John Hunter died seven or eight years ago, leaving two daughters, one of whom married Stamp Brooksbank, Esq., of the Hermitage, neai; Hexham ; and since Mr. John Hunter's death, George AVhite of Medomsley has frequently received sums of money from Mrs. Brooksbank for distribution, which he has given to poor widows in the village, returning a list of their names, with the sums given to each, to Mrs. Brooksbank. The last money he received from her was \u00a32 about two years ago, which he distributed in the manner before-mentioned. A sum of \u00a310, mentioned in the Parliamentary Returns of 1786 to hpve been in the hands of John Forster, appears to be lost.\" Brodiey. \u2014 This manor adjoins Medomsley on the south. In 1341, William de Bradley held a messuage and sixty acres of the Lord of Bradley by the service of one rose and half a pound of cumin. It was afterwards in possession of the Pooles, Feltons, Thorntons, Lumleys, Newtons, and Waltons ; lastly, it was purchased by John Simpson, Esq., of Bradley Hall, and is now tho property of his daughter, Miss Simpson. Hamsterley HaU Ues five miles north of Lanchester, and about eight miles south-west-by-west of Gateshead. It is a handsome mansion-house, seated delightfully in a warm, sheltered valley on the Pont Burn, and surrounded by rich and extended woodlands, disposed with peculiar taste. The happy arrangement of the grounds was projected and partly executed by its former tasteful owner, Henry Swinburn, Esq., and completed by Anthony Surtees, Esq., its present spirited proprietor. Hamsterley, under Hatfield's Survey, was held by John de Felton, who paid =\u00a34. It had, be fore this tiinej given name to a resident family. Before 1500, Sir Roger Hastings alienated Ham, VOL.

It continued in possession of this branch of the Swinburns until after 1645, when it was carried in marriage by an heiress to AVilliam Swinburn, of Capheaton, Esq., grandfather of the first baronet. In 1762, Sir John Swinburn devised Hamsterley to his brother, Henry Swin burn,* who, in 1795, jointly with his eldest son, Henry Joseph Swinburn, Esq., suffered a recovery of the estate. Thomas Swinburn, Esq., eldest surviving son of Henry, devised, in 1806, to his wife Fiances. Mrs. Swinburn (with others interested) joined in conveying to Anthony Surtees, Esq.

Maude, heiress of the old Lords of Dalden, and widow of Sir AVilliam Bowes of Streatlam, died in 1420, seized of this estate; and it continued in the Bowes family until 1560, when it was sold to AVilliam Stevenson, of Blackhall, yeoman.

He made the usual tour in Italy; and, in 1774, travelled with his lady on the Continent, for the express purpose of indulging their taste for antiquities and the sine arts. He spent six years in France, Spain, Italy, and Germany ; formed an intimacy with some ofthe most celebrated literati of those countries, and received some signal marks of esteem from the sovereigns of the courts he visited. On his return to England, he retired to his seat at Hamsterley. The learning and ingenuity of Mr. Swinburn are well known. The warmth and animation of his descriptions discover an imagination highly susceptible of every bounty of nature or art ; and, if he had a fault, it was the being too apt to relinquish simplicity for profusion of ornament : \u2014 but, from this fault, what traveller is free ? He was the first who brought us intimately acquainted with Spain, and the arts and monuments of its ancient inhabitants. A letter of Mr. Swinburn, under the assumed name of Porcustus, in answer to some remarks on his Travels, and describing a Roman altar then in his possession, is printed in Gent. Mag. 1784, vol. liv. p. 975- He married Martha, daughter of John Baker, of Chiches ter, Esq., Solicitor to the Leeward Islands, by whom he had several children, most of whom died young. By the marriage, however, of an only surviving daughter to Paul Benfield, Esq., he became involved in the misfortunes of his relation ; and obtained a place in the newly-ceded settlement of Trinidad, where he died in April, 1803. His library had been sold by Messrs. Leigh and Sotheby in the preceding year, and the most interesting articles in it bought in by his brother. His \" Travels in Spain\" was published in a 4to volume, 1779 ; four years after, vol. i. of his \" Travels in the Two Sicilies,\" and a second volume two years later. Both these works have been reprinted in 8vo ; the first in two, the other in four volumes. + John Hall, of Skelton Castle, in the county of York, after his marriage took the name and arms of Stevenson. \" He inherited a considerable paternal estate, of which Skelton Castle, near Guisborough, was the family seat. He was born in 1718, and died in March, 1785. AVhere he was instructed with the first rudiments of learning we have no information ; but it is well known that he completed his classical education at Jesus College, in the university of Cambridge. Here it has been generally supposed that the friendship commenced between him and Mr. Sterne, who was ofthe same college, which continued without interrup tion while they were both spared to enjoy it ; though, as they were both educated in Yorkshire, it is not improbable that their acquaintance might have commenced at a more early period. Mr. Hall afterwards made the tour of Europe ; and that he had made it with the best effect, was evident in his conversations upon the subjects connected with it. He was an excellent classical scholar, and perfectly acquainted with the belles lettres of Europe. He could engage in the grave discussions of criticism and literature with supe rior power, while he was qualified to enliven general society with the smile of Horace, the laughter of Cer vantes, or he could sit in Fontaine's easy chair and unbosom his humour to his chosen friends. AVhen he resided in London, he lived as other men of the world do, whose philosophy partakes more of Epicurus than the Porch ; and in the country, when Skelton Castle was without company, and he was threatened with the spleen, to which he was occasionally liable, he had recourse to a very fine library and a playful muse. That he was a man of singular genius and a peculiar cast of thought, must be acknowledged by all who read his"], [375, "MEDOMSLEY. 239 whose grandson, John Wharton, Esq., M.

WiUiam Carr, Esq., in 1661, divided the estate; when the eastermost lot, including the mill, was granted to Ambrose Stevenson, of Byerside, Gent. ; the mansion-house and adjoining lands fell to Robert Surtees, and the westermost portion to George Surtees.

One of the first Quaker meeting-houses in the north of England was established in Benfieldside, where (as Turner upon Providence relates) \" the devil in much wrath appeared to snatch awav works ; that, while he caught the ridicule of life, he felt for its misfortunes, will be equally evident to those who read the page that contains the Epitaph on Zachary Moore.

They have passed the fiery ordeal of examination ; and, whatever opinion may have been formed of them, whether arising from prejudice, from judgment, from friendship, or from caprice, that opinion is not likely to be altered by any thing which can be offered by an anonymous editor. The author, whose genius partook of Prior's wit and La Fontaine's ease and spirit, died, leaving his performances to the mercy of accident ; many of them little known, and some difficult to be obtained. The fate of fugitive pieces, after the course of a few years, has been a subject frequently and feelingly lamented by those who have wished to save from destruction the works of eminent authors. Already had the veil of oblivion begun to shade several of the performances contained in the present volumes. In a short time, what has now been obtained with difficulty would have been impossible to procure on any terms whatever. Soon after the present edition was projected, an application was made to the worthy representative of the author's family, John AA^harton, Esq., of Skelton Castle, Yorkshire, member of parliament for Beverley, who, with the utmost liberality and politeness, presented the publisher with corrected copies of the greater part of these works, together with several original pieces of his grandfather, which now first appear in pub- lic. These add very much to the value of the work, and demand the grateful acknowledgment of the pub- lisher. It may be thought, by some over-delicate persons, that an apology would here not be ill placed for some of the performances now re-published ; but this the editor declines, as he concurs in opinion with his author, who has already observed, that, * Outcries against writings, composed with no worse intention than to promote good-humour and cheerfulness, by fighting against the t\u0153dium vitas, were reserved for an age of refined hypocrisy. There ought to be a great distinction between obscenity evidently designed to inflame the passions, and a ludicrous liberty which is necessary to shew the true ridicule of hypocritical characters ; which can give offence to none but such as are afraid of every thing that has a tendency to unmasking.' The most prominent features of the life of Mr. Hall, the author of these poems, are the poems themselves\" \u2014Nichots' Literary Anecdotes of the Eighteenth Century, vol. iii. p. 86."], [376, "240 CHESTER WARD.\u2014 W.

Shotley Bridge is a pleasant small village, hanging on the southern banks of the Darwent. \" The surrounding scenery is wild and romantic ; and the Darwent, fringed with native wood, wanders through rich haugh grounds, finely contrasted with the heathy hills (now striped with new enclosures) which hem in the vale on the north and south.\" The chapel stands upon the summit of a lofty eminence in Northumberland ; but the village is wholly on the Durham side, and contains a Methodist and a Ranters' meeting-house, two public houses, and a few shopkeepers, with some cottages for mechanics and labourers. Here are many plots of land held under the dean and chapter of Durham. The bridge, over which the turnpike road passes from Durham (by Lanchester) to Hexham, was widened and improved a few years ago. At Shotley Grove are the extensive paper-mills of Mr. John Annandale, of Newcastle. The machinery has lately been much improved and enlarged. This place is celebrated for containing a small colony of German sword-cutlers, who, about the reign of King AArilliam, fled from their native land, and settled in this secluded vale, in order ta enjoy religious liberty ; and who, mingling with the inhabitants, soon forgot the language of their forefathers. The original names of Woper, Henkels, A'ooz, Moll, and Faws, have disappeared ; but the Oley family remain, and still possess the skill of manufacturing exceUent sword-blades and scymitars.

AVhereupon giving himself solely up to studies at home, especially in the library at Durham, improved himself to a miracle. After Oxon was reduced by the Parliament forces in the year 1646, at which time the wars were ceased, he was sent to St- John's Coll. in Cambridge, where he had not been many months, under the tuition of stir. Joh. Pawson, Fellow, e'er came out the first issue of his prodi- gious wit, entit. ' Hor\u00e6 vaciv\u0153, or Essays, with some occasional Considerations,' Lond. 1646, vvith his pic- ture before them, aged 19. The sudden breaking forth of which, amazed not only the university, as I am instructed by one of his fellow collegiates, but the more serious part of men in the three nations where they were spread. The same year, about New-year's time, came out his 'Poems,' and with them 'The second Book of divine Poems,' both which books were much admired. After he had continued more than a year at Cambridge, in the condition of a Commoner and Gent. Com. he was translated to Grey's Inn, where he added to the structure of a most admirable romance, entit. 'Lucenia,' which he had began in Cambridge, but by the lending it forth to a friend it was smother'd. In 1648, his mind being sufficiently known to en- cline towards a commonwealth, he sided with the Independent, and wrote 'A Satyr against Presbytery,' and in 1649 he published 'An humble Motion to the Parliament of England concerning the Advancement of Learning, and Reformation of the Universities.' In which taking occasion to court the then rulers, got him a present sum of money, and a pension of \u00a3100 per an. from the council. In that book he would have the ' friar-like list' of fellowships brought to a far less number, and the rest of the revenue of the university sequestred into the hands of the committee. About the same time he wrote, ' Four Paradoxes,' to which he added two more in 1653, published at Lond. under the name of 'Joh. de la Salle,' by Joh. Davies of Kid- welly : And in 1650 being commanded by the Council of State into Scotland to attend Oliver Cromwell, to make such observations on affairs there, as might conduce to the settling of the interests of the Common- wealth, he wrote a book entit. ' The Grounds and Reasons of Monarchy,' with an appendix of ' An Epitome of the Scottish Affairs:' both printed at Edinburgh and afterwards at London. About that time he was caUed to the bar, and sometimes pleaded, and in 1651 he published 'A Gag to Love's Advocates,' &c. wherein he justified the parliament's proceedings in the execution of Christop. Love, a forward and busy Presbyterian. AVhat other things he either wrote or published, are brierly these. 1. A preface before, with remarks upon, a book entit. 'A true Relation of the unjust, cruel, and barbarous Proceedings against the English at Amboyna in the E. Indies, by the Netherlandish Government and Council there.' Which book, tho' it had been published in the latter end of the reign of K. Jam. I. and the second time at Lond. 1632, Joh. Hall thought it necessary to revive it at that time (1651) because of the then differences between tho Dutch and the English. This book he dedicated to the general, O. Cromwell, and it was much bought up. AVhereupon the Dutch ambassador residing then in AA'estminster, made a complaint of that book and de- manded punishment on the reviver of it, but the parliament thinking it a seasonable service done to the public, took no notice of it. 2. He rendred into English from the original, ' The Height of Eloquence, written by Dionys. Longinus,' Lond. 1652, dedicated to Bulstrode AA'hitlock, one of the Commissioners of the Great Seal. 3. He wrote ' A Letter from a Gent, in the Country concerning,' &c. an. 1653, (just after the Long Parliament was dissolv'd) tending to settle the humours of the people in that great emergency. 4. 'Answer to the grand Politic Informer,' printed 1653, which 'Politic Informer' being a virulent pam- phlet written upon the assembly of Barbone's Parliament, and therefore censured and suppressed, it was thought expedient that Hall should answer it, and he was well rewarded for it from the exchequer. 5. He put out in English 'Lusus Serius,' Lond- 1654, written in Lat. by Mich. Majerus: half of which almost was done in one afternoon, over a glass of wine in a tavern. 6.

In 1380, the estate was in possession of the Surtees family, afterwards of the Claxtons and Eures, and is now the property of A^iscount Deerhurst. There arc some fine plantations and romantic scenery on this estate. THE CHAPELRY OF EBCHESTER. This small chapelry is separated by the romantic Darwent from Northumberland, and on every other point is surrounded by the chapelry of Medomsley. The village is distant 10 miles west-south west of Gateshead ; and though it stands at the foot of a long descent, sloping towards the north, yet it is scattered along the edge of a still steeper declivity, which overhangs the green haughs of the Darwent. It contains two public houses, two shops, a surgeon, and a few mechanics. Here is a corn mill ; and, at Ebchester mill, Mr. AVilliam Jewitt carries on the business of woollen manufacturer, dyer, and bleacher. There are four farms in the chapelry. There was undoubtedly a Roman station at this place, in the interior of which the chapel, a farmhold, and a few cottages now stand. The vallum, at the very edge of the steep, is still ex tremely distinct. \" The north-west angle,\" observes Surtees, \" is perfect, and part of the western agger, though cut through by roads and foot-paths. On the south, also, the vallum is extremely distinguishable, just within the southern wall of the church-yard, part of which at least seems built out of the ruins of the Roman ramparts ; and the moss-grown crumbling walls of some neighbouring cottages on the west betray a similar origin. The great road which leads to this station from the south, and which Warburton saw broad and distinct before the enclosures, may be still partially traced ; and ' at the distance of a Roman mile and a half to the south (according to Hunter) the foundation of a square watch-tower was discovered, about six or eight yards west of tlie military way ; the stones were cemented with lime :' and in 1727 Dr. Hunter discovered, ' a little to the south of the south-west angle of the ramparts, part of the aqueduct that supplied the baths; it was composed of two erected flat stones cemented into two niches cut in one laid flat at the bottom.' \" Many scattered remains of sepulchral and other monuments may be still observed built up in several of the houses of Ebchester. In the Philos. Trans. No. 278, Dr. Hunter notices an altar, but without legible inscription, and a stone lying near the church-door, sculptured with a very obscure figure, presumed to be habited in the Roman toga, and on each side a dolphin, with some other indistinct ornaments. Camden places amongst the Lanchester Inscriptions, a sepulchral stone inscribed have (ave). He also mentions, as discovered here, a small altar inscribed to the arrived to the 29th year of his age, and was buried there, near to the grave of his father, who died about a year before, just after his son's arrival there. To conclude; 'had not his debauches and intemperance di verted him from the more serious studies, he had made an extraordinary person ; for no man had ever done so great things at his age.' So was the opinion of the great philosopher of Malmsbury.\" It ought also to be observed that this clever man was the friend of Hegge, another short-lived genius, and a native of Durham ; and of Davies of Kidwelly, who dedicates his first edition of \" The Rites and Monu ments\" to James Mickleton, Esq., Hall's brother-in-law. Several individuals of the HaU family were of a literary turn.

On one face of the altar is a boar, and on the other a toad. Camden also mentions an urn nearly a yard in height, yet not above seven inches wide, with a small cup or chalice in its centre ; probably intended to contain a funeral oblation ol wine and milk. Several stones of the centurial kind have been discovered, one of which, Horsley says, bore the name of the fifth cohort of a legion. Another centurial stone is engraved in Hors ley, extremely, he observes, ' like what masons call trough-stones ; a circumstance which has doubtless occasioned the destruction of many a reverend fragment, thrust into a wall or the gabel of a house.' He mentions four other centurial stones built up in dwelling-houses, and conjectures, from their number, that this fort on the Darwent was built by the legionary cohorts, who inserted these inscriptions on the face of the ramparts. Other fragments, mentioned by Horsley, are, a stone on the outside of a garden wall, vv nb. ocem. vit. which he labours to make a dedication, Numi?iibus Oceani ob vitam servatam. \u2014 v\u00e6 ivl. gn.

This (which ist now in the Cathedral Library at Durham) is placed by Horsley amongst the Northumberland inscriptions; but it is plain from Hunter, that Dr. Montagu, dean of Dur ham, removed it from the corner of a barn at Ebchester. Since the days of Horsley and Gale, a few additional memorials of the station have been discovered. Three inscriptions were fixed on the wall of the parsonage by the Rev. Mr. Jefferson : 1. An altar of the usual form, very evidently dedicated to Mars (deo mart ant avg imp.) by a soldier under one ofthe Antonines; a stone inscribed s. var? and another coh. v. In the wall of another house is also a centurial stone (if it be not one of those mentioned by Horsley), coh. v. vi (not impossibly cohors v. of the sixth legion, Victrix, which lay at York. In 1784, the wash of the Darwent during a flood discovered a perfect and curious altar, which fortunately fell into the hands of the accomplished owner of Hamsterley, Henry Swinburn, Esq., whose description of this relique may be seen in the Gent. Mag. 1784. I will not attempt to decypher the inscription, which perplexed Mr. Swinburn ; but it is probably a dedication to some local deity (deo. verno. tono cocid vir. ..hi ), perhaps by one Cocidius, whose actual titles and military rank probably close the inscription.\" This Roman station is supposed by the most judicious antiquaries to be the ancient Vindomora. Dr. Hunter conjectures, with great probability, that Lanchester being too near Ebchester to form a day's march, the two stations belonged to different iters ; that the track from Lanchester proba bly crossed the Tyne by a more direct point than Ebchester, and made straight for the Wall at Halton Chesters. However, it appears that Ebchester, though perhaps inferior in importance to Lanchester, is rich in antiquities, and is conjectured to have been built by the legionary cohorts. Hutchinson says, \" We paid attention to the great Roman road which leads to this place from the southward, and found it remarkably perfect where the new inclosures of common lands had not taken place. AVe traced it for a considerable distance, so as to enable us strictly to ascertain the dimensions : It is formed in three distinct parts, with four ditches ; a centre road, probably made for carriages and cavalry, forty-two feet in width, with a narrow road on each side for foot passen gers, twelve feet wide : As we had not observed this form in any of the roads in Northumberland, or on the line of the wall, it made us more attentive to ascertain the matter. In the vicinity of lar^e cities, our modern roads have the like conveniences; in this northern situation the circum- o stance here increases our ideas of the Roman power and possession, when such a station as Eb chester required such conveniences, either for the ease of passengers, or to accommodate troops who should line the roads and guard the forage or the baggage of armies.'\"'"], [380, "244 CHESTER WARD.\u2014 AV. D. The history of Ebchester, subsequent to its Roman era, is both brief and obscure. St. Ebba, daughter of Ethelfrid, king of Northumberland, is said to have founded a monastry on the banks of the Darwent about the year 660. The convent, according to tradition, was destroyed by the Danes, and no vestige of it can now be discovered. Five centuries later, Ebchester lay desolate ; only a solitary hermit had found a retreat amongst the mouldering ruins of the ancient Vindomora, attracted perhaps by the sanctity of St. Ebba, and the retirement of the situation on the borders of the forests. Hugh Pudsey granted to his infant foundation of Sherburn, \" Ebchester, the place of anchorets on the Darwent (which river divides our forest from that of our neighbours), for the pasture of animals for the use of the sick brethren, and for the maintenance of their shepherds in the same place:\" he added \"licence to till one caracute of eightscore acres of the bishop's land newly disforested ;\" and to the house of Sherburn the advowson of the church of Ebchester and a considerable portion of land (held by lease under the master and brethren) still belong. Long after ATindomora was in ruins, the great Northern Watling Street afforded a passage both for the Danes and Saxons. Hutchinson says that King David passed over Ebchester bridge in 1346; and King Edward seems to have nearly followed the same track in pursuit of \"the elusive Scots.\" According to Rushworth, the Covenanters under Lesley took the same route. The Scots \"army marched to the water of the Darwent, and with difficulty got their foot by files over the tree-bridge at Ebchester, half over-night, and the rest next day, so that they all passed that night on the field.\" Ebchester bridge is formed by a wooden platform laid upon piers, and is not kept in good repair. There are still the remains of two stone piers of an old bridge at a short distance in the Darwent, and which some have supposed to be part of a Roman bridge. The Church stands within the south-western angle of the Roman station. It consists of a low nave and chancel, and a south porch. The chancel is entered through a round archway.

It is nine miles north-by-east of Stanhope, and eighteen miles west-south-west of Newcastle. The church is a mean edifice, and consists of a narrow nave and chancel, without tower or aisles. In the church yard lies interred one Edward Ward, a person of gigantic stature, and a great hunter in his days, whose limbs were so enormous, that, tradition says, a favourite hound littered in his wooden shoe. He was most probably one of the seditious associators in 1662, and, from the enormity of his ex ploits, obtained the name of giant. Curates \u2014 Muggleswick Perpetual Curacy.

Then the place being void for the space of a whole yeare, wee ourselves betwixt grief and necessitie went abroad to seeke, and it pleased our God to send such an one as our soules longed after, and no sooner found we one to whom our minds affected, but immediately those prebends (who whether they were friends or foes to Christ judge yee), that will not sticke to hazard their heads so they may hinder the truth, doe impose one Eraidley upon us, a bird brought out of the nest of their bosomes, who (we may say without sinne) is one of the most deboist amongst the sonnes of men, for hee will neither preach himselfe nor yet permit others, but upon the Sabbath day he took the locke from the church doore, and fastened on one of his owne, so as that the parishioners were forced for to stand in the church-yard to discharge divine duties with their mi- nister in cold frost and snow, to the infinite dishonour of the Almightie, the great griefe of their minds, and the dreadful indangering of themselves in that stormy time of the yeare ; other times before he came into the church, whilst our minister was in his exhortation, and stood up beside him, reading with a loud voyce in a book to overtop the sound of his words : afterward pulled him by the coate when hee was in the pulpit ; but when neither of these would cause him to desist from duty, he goes and rings the bels all aloud : neither is this all, but out of malice cals a communion, and enters upon the sacred action without any preparation sermon before the day.\" * Hutchinson derives the name Muggleswick from the Scotch word mickle, implying that it was a large village, though now an insignificant little place. t The Treasury contains a long catalogue of grievances inflicted alternately and endured by the prior and the freeholders of Lanchester relative to the three Hopes \u2014 Horselyhope, Hysehop, and Baldynghope, which the prior claimed as granted to his predecessor, Bishop Hugh, in exchange for Hardwyk \u2014 Surtees, vol. ii. p. 361. \" Right rev'ent fader in God and my Ryght goode frend I cu'maunde me to you, stefying you that when I was Justic at Dorrom ther was gret varians betwyxt the Reverent fader in god John Bysshoppe of Dur rani on the one part, and youre last p'dyssessor lat Prior of Durram and the co'vent of the same on the other"], [384, "CHESTER WARD.\u2014 AV. D. 248 Bishop Bainbridge confirmed the convents possessions in Muggleswick, and 216 acres of wood land and waste which he recites to have been granted to them by Bishop Kirkeham, with leave to enclose and impark the same lands. But this was merely an addition to the ancient park of Mug o-leswick, which was enclosed by Prior Hugh, who also built a Camera, a lodge (as it would now be termed), containing a hall, a chapel, &c. Some remains of this building are still in existence, with part of the park-wall. The park, which is now enclosed, was three miles in length and two in breadth, and was, in 1662, the scene of several seditious meetings. With the restoration of Charles II. , monarchy and episcopacy in England were raised to a state of extravagant splendour, and a flood of profligate joy burst over the land. This state of things was well calculated to scan dalize persons deeply embued with the principles of sober piety and of civil liberty. By the Act of Uniformity, many ministers of high character were silenced in the county of Durham, and a deep sense of resentment was cherished amongst the sincere Dissenters who inhabited these wilds ; \" and it was perhaps owing,\" observes Surtees, \" to the calmer temper of the people and the milder genius of the country, rather than to the lenience of government, that the same scenes were not acted here which soon after occurred in Scotland, when the Covenanters were hunted into the wil derness, and found consolation in anathematizing their persecutors amidst woods and wastes and waterfaUs. The Cavaliers, who saw with dismay the good old cause rearing its ominous head in more places than the green banks of the Darwent, had every reason for preserving the ascendant they had just regained : they were still sore under the bruises inflicted by the iron mallet of Crom well, and had scarcely had time to forget ' The psalm-singing rascals who drubbed them so well.' To the Cavalier the swell of a nocturnal hymn pealing down the mountain-side from some conven ticle of separatists, must have spoken of war and disaster, ruin and defeat, of Naseby, of AVorces ter, and of Long Marston. Loyal addresses were poured in, and armed associations formed in all quarters; and such a face of general resistance was displayed, that the malcontents shrunk quietly into their mew without daring the field.\" \"Durham. \u2014 The information of John EUerington, of Blenchland, in the said county, March 22, 1062. \" This informant saith, That he hath known divers seditious meetings in Muggleswick park within these last six months, sometimes at the house of one John AVard, who is one of their chief preachers, sometimes at the house of John Readshaw, Robert Blenkinsop, and Rowland Harrison, who were met together.

That they intended first to fall upon Durham, to seize any magazine that might be there, or money in any treasurer's hands, and to plunder the town.

And this informant saith, that he knows to depose what he hath said, because he was one of their party, and was re-baptized by the abovesaid John AVard, and was with them at most of their meetings, and did take the abovesaid oath of secresy, but being pricked in his conscience at the horror of such a bloody design, he could have no rest nor quietness in his mind, till he had discovered the same. \"Samuel Davison, Cuth.

Neile, justices ofthe peace.\" In a second information, Elrington accuses several gentlemen of considerable rank as participes crimines : Sir Henry Witherington of Northumberland, Edward Fenwick of Stanton, Esq., Ti mothy AArliittingham, Esq., of Holmside, and Captain Lilburne of Sunderland. The two last were apprehended and detained in custody three months, and then liberated from want of the slightest evidence to criminate them ; but Lilburne's very name was ominous, and Whittingham was a sour Presbyterian. However, the Darwentdale plot excited such commotion, that Bishop Cosin called out the trainbands, under Sir Thomas Davison ; and the principal gentry and their retainers em bodied themselves in the different wards, under Sir Nicholas Cole of Brancepath, Col. Cuthbert Carr, Col. Byerley, and Henry Lambton, Esq. After all, Ellington seems to have been an infa mous scoundrel, who finding his audience had itching ears, accused every one who leaned to the presbytery of participation in the plot. After minute enquiry, it turned out that the terrific array of mounted Anabaptists was reduced into Joseph Hopper, who had taken a jaunt to Ireland. But it is always the case of oppressors to be in fear where no fear is. In the midst of these agitations, there seems to have been much mutual recrimination on account of some persons having refused to exercise a rigour beyond the law. One Joplin, having been tried, was acquitted; for which leniency it was intended to displace some of the gentlemen from the commission. Even the bishop of Durham and his officers were blamed for their want of energy and activity in this case. Mr. Neile, ist answer to these charges, recriniinates in the following letter to Mr. Stapleton ;\u2014 \"I am hartely sorry my lord and ye country hath soe many ill enemyes, and have long seen the malice and backbiting of the Yorkshiremen against this country and my lord and his officer, and I am the more sorry y' they <*oe Scotfree, being more to blame then us.

But what a rare place wee live in, that now must beare all the loade of his folly rather then his worship should be reputed a headstrong asse. I am confident Judge Twisden is in his heart of this opinion; and I think my lord is bounden in conscience, in regard of his country, if the judge come to town, to demand it seriously of the judge whether any jurie could have given other verdict upon that evidence ; and according to his answer, either satisfie his Ma'ie in behalfe of ye countrey, or else for example sake promote the severe punishment of the offenders, and not lett yc country suffer for a few.

Butt yett I must say, considering ye temper, interest, kindness, and affinity ofthe gentlemen of this county, if these old ones be putt out with disgrace, there will be a dozen that will putt themselves out ; and I believe you are of my opinion ; and then who shall doe the business of the countrey ? But what need I aske that question, when I see Deane Carleton sitt most of ye last sessions upon yc bench in ye middle of ye justices, and take place there even of Baron Hilton, and talke as fast as any body ? This wil be a great confusion in the countrey, and bring it into a ridiculous condition, which I feare nothing will prevent, unless my lord stick to ye gentry, &c. I am sure, in the mane, his lordship is basely abused by the artifices of some insinuating pickthanks, there being ye whole evidence besides me, Davenport's and AValler's evidence, which was only a relation from his uncle Atkinson ; for neither the gaoler's wife nor daughter, though Snaith said they know, would sweare it, if it had been according to the indictment.

Cold Rowley is a village on the summit of the bleak heights betwixt the vale of Lanchester and the Darwent, about a mile from Allansford. It contains a few farmholds, and a chapel belonging to the Baptists, many of whom have resided here since the days of the Commonwealth. In the neighbourhood there is a smelt-mill, belonging to Thomas Featherstone and Co. of Newcastle. At Watergate, in this parish, the Methodists have a chapel, where they assemble for public worship. The southern parts of this parish form one continued region of rugged hills, which, though for bidding in their aspect, are rich with internal wealth, and afford large quantities of lead ore, in cluding silver.* But the banks of the Darwent are beautiful; and, says Hutchinson, \"the traveller, turning his back on Muggleswick, finds new objects of pleasure attend his steps.

His father was a farmer, and had a small estate of his own, which the doctor possessed at his death. He was first educated at the village school, and privately by the Rev. Daniel AVat- son, who was then a young man, and curate of that place. Afterwards he was sent to St. Paul's school, where he continued longer than boys usually do, as his father could not afford to send him to either of the universities. He is supposed to have been once a candidate for the mastership of St. Paul's, but the want of a degree was fatal to his application. AVhen still young, however, he became usher to Dr. Hurst, who was master of the grammar-school at Hertford, and succeeded him in that situation, which he held for many years with the highest credit. He was honoured with the degree of LL. D. from the Marischal College, Aberdeen, by the influence of Dr. Beattie. He died June 6, 1807, after experiencing a gradual decay for nearly a year before ; but on the day of his death was, as he supposed, in much better health than usual. He was buried in St. John's church, Hertford, with an epitaph in Latin, written by liimself, in which he seems to reflect a little on time lost, \" sludiis inanibus.\" This may probably allude to his \" Translation of Lucian,\" on which he employed many of his leisure hours, and which was published in 5 vols. 8vo. from 1773 to 1798. It procured him considerable fame, which, however, has been diminished, in the opinion of many, since the appearance of Dr. Francklin's more classical translation. Dr. Carr's other publications were trifles, on which himself perhaps set no very high value : \" Vol. III. of Tristram Shandy,\" in imitation of Sterne, but soon detected, 1760; \" Filial Piety,\" a mock heroic, 1763, sol. ; \" Extract of a Private Let- ter to a Critic,\" 1764, sol.; and \" Eponina, a Dramatic Essay, addressed to the Ladies,\" 1765 \u2014 Nichols Bowyer, vol. iii.

John Lough, of Low Muggleswick, a stone-mason, first evinced his skill and taste in the execution of a monument in AUendale church. He afterwards removed to Newcastle, where he worked at his trade for some time, unnoticed and unknown ; but all his spare hours were devoted to the art of modelling in clay. At length, he conceived the bold idea of executing a colossal figure of Milo, which should at once stamp his fame. This he executed at his humble lodgings in London, under circumstances of extreme difficulty; but when his task was completed, artists, noblemen, and amateurs hastened to gaze upon and admire the extra- ordinary work of this untaught genius, and numerous orders were pressed upon him. Several other original and boldly conceived works have, since that time, proceeded from his studio. Not forgetful of old associa- tions, stir.

A school house was built here in 1825, at the joint expense of the dean and chapter and Lord Crewe's trus tees ; the former of whom also give \u00a310 per annum for the encouragement of the schoolmaster, as the parish, without this aid, would not be able to support him. The Church, though rectorial, is a mean edifice, 64 feet long and 24 broad, consisting of a nave and chancel, the latter supported by short buttresses.

This parish is bounded by the Darwent on the north, dividing it from Blanchland* in North umberland, by Edmundbyers on the east, by tbe parish of Stanhope on the south-west and south, and by the imaginary line which divides Durham and Northumberland on the north-west. The parish, which is divided into five farms, forms but one constablery. Hunstanworth, under Boldon Book, is held by Robert Corbet, by forest service. \" The Hospi tal of St. Giles holds a certain parcel of ground lately disforested, and a forest for breeding cattle, near the boundary of AValter de Bolbec.\" Corbet settled this estate on pious purposes ; part to St. Giles of Kepyer, and the church of Hunstanworth to the House of Durham. Two centuries later, the prior and convent exchanged the church, the advowson, glebe, &c. with the House of Kepyer, for a rent-charge of 13s. 4d. and a moiety of the tithes of South Shirburn. In 1439, the Hospital of Kepyer, for 40s. rent, demised to Alexander Beckfield and Mary his wife \" the vill of Hunstanworth, with all its pastures and profits, by these boundaries \u2014 from the foot of Boltesburn, ascending that water to its head, and so from the head of that water as far as the head of Knewk den Burn, and so descending by that water as far as Eweshopeburn, and so proceeding as far as the water of Darwent, and descending by the Darwent to the foot of Boltesburn.\" * Blanchland, or Alba Landa, is seated in a narrow, deep, green vale, on the north side of the Darwent, and is enclosed by heathy hills and morasses. Most of the inhabitants are employed in the adjoining lead works. Here is an abbey, which was founded in 1175 by AValter de Bolbeck, to the honour of the Blessed Virgin, for twelve Pr\u00e6monstratensian canons, with liberty to exceed that number, with the consent of the bishop of Durham. He gave it the lordship, and demesnes, and advowson of the church of Blanchland, the appropriations and advowsons of the churches of Herelaw and Bywell, of Styford, of Shotley, of Apperlev, and of the church of Heddon-on-the-Wall, dedicated to St. Andrew; the tithes of the village of AVulward hope, and ten fishes for their table out of his fishery of Styford, in lieu of tithe-fishes. The Nevills were also benefactors to this house; and King John, in the 16th year of his reign, confirmed all the benefactions then settled on it. Afterwards, John de Torrington was a further benefactor ; but the bounty of Paganus de Cadurcis, i. e. Pain de Chaworth, the son and heir of Hawisia de London, by Patrick Chaworth her hus band, to this house, was most remarkable ; for he gave to the monks of this house nineteen acres of arable land, on these conditions, that every day, each priest in the abbey, in celebrating the mass, should pray for the souls of Sir Thomas de Londres, her father, Patrick Chaworth, her husband, Hawisia, his mother, and divers others, whu were dead, and for the good estate of him the said Paganus or Pain, Patrick, and Har vey, his brothers, and Eve and Anne, his sisters, while they lived. The deed of gift, bv which these lands were settled, bears date anno 1270. The abbot was summoned to parliament 23 King Edward I.

Lord Crewe, bishop of Durham, his uncle, who left it to charitable uses. The west end and tower of the church remain ; the latter was neatly fitted up for parochial duty by the trustees of Bishop Crewe's charity in 1752, who also provided a comfortable house for the curate. There are some old grave-stones in the church. The gateways of the quadrangle of the abbey and of the abbey itself are still remaining: the towers on each hand are converted into ale-houses.

It is separated on the north from Chester AVard by the AVear, and on the west is bounded partly by the windings of the AVear, and partly by the parish of Pittington. The southern boundary is formed by an imaginary line, proceeding from the sea through the parish of Hart, and which passes the extreme verge of Trimdon chapelry. The chapelry of Croxdale and the lands of Sherburn Hospital mark its western boundary. AVitbin these limits, Easington Ward forms an oblong square, small in extent, but important in populati \u00a7 and production. The general aspect of this Ward is bare and dreary. The soil is generally a cold, harsh clay, intersected by tame, monotonous chains of freestone, which display nothing ofthe grandeur of moun tain scenery. \" Yet there are beauties which may escape the eye of a casual observer. Betwixt the swells of country lie numerous dales, or denes, almost entirely concealed from the higher grounds. Every brook which falls to the sea has its banks adorned with a profusion of wild and varying scenery ; the vales, commencing imperceptibly together with the course of their little streamlets, sometimes contract themselves into narrow glens, scarce affording a single rugged footpath \u2014 some times open into irregular amphitheatres of rock, covered with native ash or hazel, or deepen into ravines resembling the bed of a rapid river, terminating on the coast either in wide sandy bays, or in narrow outlets, where the stream mines its way under crags of tbe wildest and most grotesque appearance.\""], [392, "EASINGTON WARD. 256 Bailey says that, between Hart and Sunderland, the soil *\" produces miserable crops of corn, and, when suffered to remain in grass, produces a herbage that scarcely any kind of stock will eat, unless compelled by hunger.\" The loamy soils on the Wear are of a friable and sandy texture ; and the limestone district in the western parts of this Ward is mostly a dry, but not a productive loam : yet there are parts, in all these districts, which are singularly fertile and beautiful.

THE HISTORY OF SUNDERLAND, INCLUDING BISHOP AND MONK-AVEARMOUTH. LTNDERLAND* and Bishopwearmouth on the south side of the river Wear, con- nected by an iron bridge with Monkwearmouth on the opposite shore, form one populous, commercial Town and Port. It is pleasantly situated near the conflu- ence of the AVear with the German Ocean, in latitude 54 deg. 55 min. north, and longitude 1 deg. 20 min. west; and is 11 miles south-east of Newcastle, 13 miles north-east of Durham, and 269 miles north-north-west of London. Sunderland Parish includes little more than the Borough and Town Moor. It is bounded on the east by the German Ocean ; on the north by the river, by which it is separated from Monk wearmouth ; and on the west and south by the parish of Bishopwearmouth. The principal build ings are ranged into two streets, which run from east to west, with a swift descent to the harbour on the north. The High Street is broad and handsome, and communicates with the chief street in Bishopwearmouth. The Low Street, a much more confined, irregular, and ancient line of build ings, runs nearly parallel to the river, from AVearmouth Panns west to the Low Quay eastward. Several narrow and steep avenues form a communication between these streets. Church Street, built in 1719, Silver Street, Queen Street, and other smaller streets, branch at right angles from the High Street southwards towards the Moor and Townfields. Bishopwearmouth Parish is bounded by the river A\\rear, separating it from Monkwearmouth, on the north ; by Sunderland and by the sea on the east ; by Seaham on the south ; and by Houghton-le-Spring on the west. The parish is subdivided into seven constableries: 1. Bishop wearmouth, including Barnes, PaUion, and Bainbridge Holme ; 2. AVearmouth Panns ; 3. Ford ; 4. Silksworth and Grindon ; 5. East Burdon ; 6. Tunstall ; 7- Ryhope. The entire parish extends from east to west about three miles, and from north to south about five miles. The ancient village of Bishopwearmouth lay scattered on the soutli and west sides of the hill round the church ; but the rapid increase of wealth and population has enabled the inhabitants, * Various conjectures have been hazarded respecting the origin of the name Sunderland. Some contend that it is the ancient Saxon Sondcrland, signifying a particular place with privileges of its own. Others suggest that the name may refer to the Sundry' d land, which belonged to the monastry of Monkwearmouth on the soutli side of the AVear, and near its mouth. But the simplest and most obvious derivation seems to be, that it marked the original situation ofthe place, on a point of land almost insulated by the AVear and by the sea, which has probably flowed much higher than at present up some of the deep gullies on the coast, particularly Hendon Dene, which, it seems, contained, as late as 1350, water sufficient for vessels to ride at anchor in the bay. A similar situation has given name to Sundcrland-by-the-Bridgc, situated ou the rid^e of a steep hill betwixt the AA'ear and Croxdale Beck. vol. i. 3 U"], [394, "EASINGTON WARD.\u2014 N.

The old common road is now converted into a spacious and regular street, extending near a mile in length, and communicating with the High Street, Sunderland. Several handsome lines of buildings, branching from the Main Street, both on the north and south, have risen during the same period.* The staiths erected, and the works established at the west end of Bishopwearmouth, have also given rise to a populous and extensive suburb. Wearmouth Panns extends along the Wear from the Bridge west, nearly to Beggar's Bank east, and has been gradually gained from the river by embankments. It derives its name from \" the ten salt panns\" noticed in the Survey of Elizabeth. Monkivearmouth Parish is bounded by Whitburn on the north ; by Boldon on the north-west ; by Washington on the west ; by the river AVear, dividing it from Bishopwearmouth and from Sunderland on the south ; and by the sea on the east. It extends from east to west about five miles and a half, and from north to south about two miles. This parish includes the constableries of\u2014 1. Monkwearmouth; 2. Monkwearmouth Shore; 3. Southwick; 4. Hilton; 5. FulweU. The two first-named townships constitute part of the port and town called Sunderland. This ancient town, in late times, consisted chiefly of two long streets, running from east to west alono- the heights above the river ; but, on the higher grounds northwards, a new town, judiciously planned, and consisting of regular, elegant, and convenient buildings, is gradually rising into con sequence. Monkwearmouth Shore, which formerly consisted of a few fishermen's huts, is now joined to the old town ; and the skirts of the sand are crowded with irregular buildings, and re sound with the busy hum of industry, the noise of dock-yards, the clattering of anvils, and the cries of mariners. Monkwearmouth parish is now joined, in civil matters, to the North Division of Easington AVard, and, with the parishes of Sunderland and Bishopwearmouth, form a district extending above seven miles from north to soutli, and averaging in extent four miles from east to west. But * \" Fifty years ago, the ground on which Sans Street, Villiers Street, Nile Street, Norfolk Street, John Street, Fawcett Street, Union Street, York Street, Walworth Street, and AVest Street, are now built, were fields and gardens. From the Peacock Inn eastwards, on the south side of the High Street, the only houses then built were, a house at the end of the Crow-tree Lane ; the gardener's house, now occupied by Mr. Burnip, publican ; a small cottage, rebuilt, now occupied by Mr. Longstaff; Jacob Maude, Esq.'s house, now occupied by Edward Backhouse, Esq. ; and the two houses occupied by Mr. Friend and Mrs. Turner. A wall then divided these fields and gardens from the main road. These fields extended eastwards as far as Sans Street. Before J. Maude, Esq.'s house there was a wall : since that period it has been opened out, in its present state, as a shrubbery. On the north side of the High Street the ground was fields, on which Sunderland Street, East Cross Street, AVilliam Street, Lambton Street, and Bridge Street, are now built. A wall divided these fields from the main road. These fields reached eastwards to the Bridge Inn. For merly, it would appear, there was a gate across the high road, at the head of Pan Lane. It is probable that the person who kept the gate resided in the cottage house which then stood upon the same scite of ground upon which stir. Longstaff's house is built. An old man, who had been long absent from the town, came and enquired for Robin of the yett (probably the gate had been kept by Robin) ; but both he and the gate were gone. In those days, Bishopwearmouth was like a village ; there was an annual hopping; ass-races were run in the High Street, and other rural sports and amusements took place. ***** Formerly, there was a quay, about six feet high, in the front of the houses at the north-east end of Bishopwearmouth, be ginning at Number's Garth, and reaching as far as the Bridge Inn. This quay extended a considerable way into the high road. Immediately before the Bridge Inn, there was a descent of six steps to the horse-road. The lowering of this ground was considered, and certainly is, a great improvement.\" \u2014 Burnett's Hist, of Sunderland, p. 49, et seq."], [395, "SUNDERLAND, &c. 259 the history and description of the Out Townships will be reserved until the account be finished of those parts which are so intimately connected as to form one town.

If the seamen be estimated at 4000, the total population belonging to the Town and Port will, at present, amount to 43,520 persons ! History of the Borough of Sunderland. The harbour at the mouth of the Wear, Wiranmuthe, or Ostium A'edra, was well known in Saxon ages, at which time it must have been much frequented, both on account of tlie maritime conveniences it afforded to the small craft which then navigated the coast, and of the celebrated monastry which occupied its northern bank. Certainly, this place is noticed neither by Camden nor Leland ; yet, notwithstanding the devastation spread over these parts after the Norman Con quest, it seems to have risen into some degree of consequence, as a place of maritime commerce and resort, towards the close of the twelfth century, when Hugh Pudsey, bishop of Durham, by charter erected it into a borough. This charter is addressed, amongst other personages, as priors, archdeacons, &c. to the bishop's barons, and grants \"That the burgesses of Wearmouth should enjoy the like liberties and free customs as the burgesses of Newcastle; tbat all pleas arising within the borough, except those of the crown, be determined there. Disputes between those plying with ships at that port, and mer chants to whom the cargoes were sold, to be determined within the third influx of the tide, that navigation might not be retarded ; merchandise brought by sea to be landed before sale, except salt and herrings. A year and a day's possession of lands, &c without claim, the claimant being within the realm, and not under age, a sufficient quietus. A burgess's son, maintained by his fa ther at bed and board, entitled to the like privileges as the father. A villain remaining and hold ing lands or tenements in the borough for a year and a day, without interruption, to have the same franchise as a burgess. A burgess might sell his lands and go where he pleased, if no claim was subsisting against him. If a burgess was complained against in a matter where battle ought to be waged by a villain, he was to make defence by thirty-six men, unless the value in suit was one hundred pounds, or the crime imputed to him ought to be tried by battle. No burgess was compelled to fight against a villain, unless he had forfeited his franchise. There was not to be"], [396, "EASINGTON WARD.\u2014 N. D. 260 within the borough blodwite, merchete, heriet, or blood-drawing* The reve, or head-borough, was to look after all forfeitures touching bread and beer. A burgess might bring in his corn from the country when he pleased, except at a time of prohibition or embargo. Whatsoever a burgess bought lie might sell without licence of the lord or his heir. Every burgess had liberty to buy timber and fire-wood equally with the burgesses of Durham. They should enjoy their common pasturage as was originaUy granted to them, and which the bishop caused to be perambulated. Customs of fish were to be reserved to the bishop, as Brus had from his people of Hartlepool.\" The charter was well calculated to foster the infant commerce of the borough, by releasing the burgesses from several of the most oppressive parts of the feudal law, by facilitating the transfer of property, providing for tlie speedy administration of justice, and protecting the feudal slave or stranger who had settled within the borough from being dragged back, and again chained to the soil, at the mandate of his lord. The record of Boldon Book, compiled under the same prelate, states that \" Sunderland was let to farm, and paid a hundred marks ; and that Roger de Audri paid one mark for his mill-pool, which was established within the bounds of Sunderland. In 1358. Bishop Hatfield leased the borough of Sunderland, with the fisheries and AVolton-yare, to Richard Hedworth of Soutliwyk for twenty years, under \u00a320 rent. Under the Survey of the same bishop, \" Thomas Menvill held the borough, with the free rents worth 32s. 8d., the fishery in the Wear, the borough court, the tolls, and the stallage, with eight yares belonging to the bishop; eight shillings rent from the prior of Durham for Ebyare, and eight shillings from John Hedworth for his yare called Owen's-yare, and for the right of drawing a net in the harbour of the said borough .\"-f- At the same time, \" Menvill held a place called Hynden (Hendon Bay) for the plying of vessels.\" The borough-rent had been reduced since 1358 from \u00a320 to \u00a36. The record concludes with enumerating some trifling properties held by exchequer rents: \"John Hed worth, a messuage and garden containing half an acre, 12d. ; a cottage, formerly John del Shell's, 2s. 6d. ; and another cottage of the same rent. John Hobson, a messuage and three roods called Yholwatson, which used to pay 6s. 8d., but now only 3s. 4d. ; and a waste befoie his door in AVermouth, 2d. There is a certain waste, formerly belonging to Richard de AVermouth, at the end of the town there, and sometime parcel of the demesne, containing half an acre, which used to pay 2s., but now waste and untenanted.\" In 1464, Edward IY. granted the borough, with tbe passage of the river and the fisheries, to Robert Bertram, during the vacancy of the see ; and the king engaged to provide his lease with a ferry-boat. In 1507 (22 Henry VII.), Cardinal Bainbrigg granted the borough of Sunderland, * Blodwite, an amercement for bloodshed. \u2014 Merchete was a pecuniary payment, in lieu of the right which the lord of the manor in many places claimed and had, of lying with his tenant's wife the first night after their marriage.

As late as 1788, 72 salmon were taken at one draught near the harbour-mouth.

The first lease of the anchorage and beaconage occurs under Bishop Tunstall. In 1590, Bishop Hutton leased the borough, the ferry-boats, and the fisheries, to Ralph Bowes, of Barnes, Esq., under \u00a34 rent, in as ample a manner as his grandfather, Sir Ralph Bowes, Knt., occupied the same. Bishop Mat thew granted the anchorage and beaconage, under separate leases, to Evan AVilliams in 1606. Several leases of the borough and its appendant privileges have been granted to the present time. Latterly, they have been divided into two leases : the one including the borough, the courts, fairs, markets, tolls, anchorage, and beaconage, has been vested, under different renewals, in the family of Lambton, of Lambton, who still hold it; the other, comprising the ferry-boats, the metage, and tolls of fruit, herbs, and roots, was held, from the year 1661 until the year 1795, by the family of Etterick, at which period the lease was purchased by the commissioners of AVear mouth bridge, under the powers of the act 32 Geo. III. After the statute of Henry VIII., by which the palatine jurisdiction was restrained and muti lated, Sunderland became a place of considerable note ; and it is probable that about the latter end of the reign of Elizabeth, or in that of James L, the coal trade began to find its way into the AVear. Between the years 1600 and 1630, a considerable influx of population appears to have taken place, including several families of Scotch settlers, and some foreign merchants.* In the year 1634, Bishop Morton, desirous of encouraging the rising trade of the borough, in corporated the burgesses and inhabitants by the title of Mayor, twelve Aldermen, and Commonalty of the Borough of Sunderland, and granted the privilege of a market and annual fairs. Previous to this incorporation, the borough had been governed by a bailiff-)- appointed by patent under the * Amongst the former occur the names of Dunbar, stlackracknell, stlackinnon, Dalgleish, Boyd, Rampsay, Steward, Grayme, and Oliphant : Derieksen, Claes, and a few others, seem of foreign extraction.

In 1633, Bishop Morton granted the office of water-bailiff, with the beaconage and anchorage, to Sir AVilliam Bellasyse ; yet, in 1638, \"one Michael Crake (a footman or other servant to his majesty) was made water-bailiff of Sunderland port, first by his majesty's patent, and afterwards (in the vacancy of a Lord High- Admiral) by lease, and after that by the Earl of Northumberland Lord High- Admiral. But he never enjoyed it peaceably, but was always opposed in it by Thomas Morton, then Lord Bishop of Durham, or his lessees of that office and port-duties, which was contested by orders, and counter-orders, until the grand rebellion, and the exclusion of the bishops. Crake obtaining an order of the commons of parliament to prohibit the clearing of ships without his fees and war rant : the bishop's lessees obtained another order, revoking that to Crake, and quieting the lessees in the possession untill it should be determined by law, which Crake did not prosecute at law, and so the lessees continued the possession till their lease expired during the Common-wealth. AVhen Col. George Fenwicke purchased of the usurper's trustees for sale of bishop's lands, &c. the reversion, under which he enjoyed it untill the happy restauration of King Charles 2, when the bishop (Dr. Cosins) entred and granted a new lease of all the profits, duties, and offices aforesaid. And Michael Crake being then living, he revived his claim (to the water-bailiff's office of Sunderland port), which was opposed by Bishop Cosins, and the whole matter was referred by his Royal Highness the Duke of York, then Lord High-Admiral, to Dr. John Exton, then judge of the admiralty of England, to examine and report. Dr. Exton examined, and reported the bishop's claim and right to it to be good, and therein instanced and recited diverse of the ancient charters, records, and evidences before mentioned, to ground and warrant his report, which was allowed.

The charter states \" that Sunderland had, beyond the memory of man, been an ancient borough, known by the name of the New Borough of Weremouth, containing in itself a certain port where ships had plied, bringing and carrying merchandise, as well to and from certain ports, as from other ports of the kingdom : the articles therein specified are sea-coals, grindstones, rub stones, and whetstones. It also states, that the trade was then greatly increased, by reason of the multitude of ships that resorted thither ; and the borough anciently enjoyed divers liberties and free customs, as well by prescription, as by virtue of sundry charters from the bishops of Durham, confirmed to them by the crown ; which, from defect in form, proved insufficient for the support of the ancient liberties, privileges, and free customs of the borough.\"* During the civil wars, Sunderland became a post of considerable consequence ; not so much from its positive importance, as from the circumstance that Newcastle, from 1642 to the end of October, 1644, was stoutly defended for the king, and, in consequence, the export of coal from the Tyne was closed against the rebellious city of London. Under these circumstances, the collieries on the AArear, and the port of Sunderland, became objects of vital importance ; and it seems that the latter, in 1642, received a garrison for the parliament, and that Sir AViUiam Armyne, one of the parliamentary commissioners, resided there till the surrender of Newcastle. In 1644 and 1645, several smart skirmishes took place in this neighbourhood betwixt the royal and parliamentary forces. \" 1644, March 2. Tlie Scots came over the river of Tyne ; General King, pursuing their rear, forced them into Sunderland, whereupon the Marquess of Newcastle sent for Sir Charles Lucas out of Yorkeshire, who had been ordered to stay there to fortifie Doncaster. \" March 24 ? The Scots, being much provoked to come out of Sunderland, came to Bowdon- Hill, whence with great loss they were forced back into their trenches; but next morning they came with many of their horse and foot on the Marquess of Newcastle's rear, and had so disordered it, that the whole army was endangered ; but Sir Charles Lucas, who was then in the right wing, made John Tempest, Esq., his vice-admiral, quam diu se bene gcsserit. The same bishop then also (by his like patent) made Richard Matthew, Gent., his judge of his court of admiralty. Also he then made AValter Ettricke, Gent., his register ofthe said court by like patent, afterwards AVilliam Blakestone, Esq., Charles Mountague, Esq., and William Lambton, Esq., were successively vice-admirals, by the like patents from the bishop of Durham.

The Scots, leaving two regiments to secure Sunderland, drew towards Durham; but, being not able to get horse-provisions, and unwilling to remove further till Sunderland were better fortified, returned and quartered their army on the north side the river AVeare towards Newcastle at the Shields,\" where they stormed a fort (see page 29). At this time, \" the Scots were in pain what to do with their horse, for, tho' their foot were supplyed with provisions, their horse must starve if they continued there, and if they went away without the foot, the marquess being so near, &c. it would be very hazardous; and, on the other hand, if their foot removed away witli their horse, then they should lose the advantage of their supply by sea, the land not afford ing provision, all being driven away before them by the marquess and inhabitants, who for the generality in those parts were for the king. \u2014 Whilst they were in this dilemma, the marquess de cides the debate by drawing up his army on the 23d of March from Durham and thereabouts to wards the town of Chester, and on Sunday the 24th, drew up at a place called Hilton, on the north side of the river Weare, two miles and a half from Sunderland, and the Scots drew up on a hill east from them, towards the sea. The armies faced one another all day, and towards night the cannon began to play, and parties of musqueteers fell to it, to drive one another from their hedges, and continued shooting till eleven at night, many being slain on each side. The field-word given by the marquess was, Noiv or never ; by the Scots, The Lord of Hosts is with us. On Monday tbey continued facing one another for some time, but many hedges and ditches between them : the marquess, seeing no possibility of engaging, drew off towards his quarters ; then a party of Scots horse fell on his rear, and kill'd and took about thirty ; but Sir Charles Lucas with his brigade of horse forced them to retreat.\" The disasters of the royal cause in Yorkshire soon after obliged the marquis to withdraw from the bishoprick, and leave the field open to the Scots, who first quartered \" at Easington, being the middle way betwixt Hartlepool and Durham, where, finding pretty good quarter for their horse, they continued till the 8th of April, and then marched to Quarendon HiU, within two miles of Durham.\" During the whole of the contest, the borough of Sunderland remained entirely devoted to the parliamentary interest; a circumstance which may perhaps be in a great measure attributed to the commanding influence of the family of Lilburn, -f who possessed a far greater share both of * The Scots army under Lesley amounted to 26,000, and were mostly commanded by noblemen. The vestiges of their camp at Sunderland are said to have been visible in the Pann Field, before the ground was levelled. The following fragment of a genuine Sandhill ballad evidently relates to these times : \u2014 \" Ride through Sandgate both up and down, There you'll see the gallants fighting for the crown, All the cull cuckolds in Sunderland town, AVith all the bonny Blewcaps, cannot pull them down.\" The Blewcaps did, however, at last succeed in pulling them down ; for, after a most gallant defence, Newcastle was stormed on the 19th of October, 1644, and entered by the AVhite Friar Tower and Sand-gate. t The family of Lilburn, a younger branch of a very ancient and honourable house seated at AVest Lil burn in Northumberland, had long resided at Thickley-Punchardon, in the parish of St. Andrew's-Auckland, county of Durham. This property was sold, in 1717, to Mr. Thomas Gower. \" The first of the family who settled at Sunderland was George Lilburn (uncle of John and Robert) : he was probably at first an adven turer in the trade of the place, and was afterwards carried forward, together with the increasing fortunes of his more active republican cousins, to a considerable pitch of local influence. During the whole of the civil"], [400, "EASINGTON WARD.\u2014 N. D. 264 property and interest than any other private family within the limits of the borough. A more o-eneral reason may perhaps be found in the natural bent and tendency of a population lately risen wars, he acted as the only magistrate within the limits of the borough, and in 1654 was returned one of the knights of the shire in Cromwell's parliament. He sat constantly on all committees of sequestration, and contrived in virtue of his office to get possession of a colliery at Harraton, belonging to the lessees of Sir John Hedworth, which cleared him \u00a315 a day. He survived the Restoration, and died very aged in 1677- Thomas Lilburn, his eldest son, was of Offerton, where the family held considerable property, and died in 1665, being described on his monument in the chancel of Houghton church as 'one ofthe persons instru mental in his majesty's happy Restoration ;' he bore a major's commission in Monk's army : his estate at Offerton was in the possession of his brother George's descendants in 1737- AVilliam Lilburn, grandson of the elder George Lilburn by a second marriage, sold some property in Sunderland to the family of Robinson as late as 1717; his descendants were afterwards in a very reduced condition, for one of them was confined about 1 742 in Morpeth gaol for debt, and being permitted by his creditors to go to Newcastle on his parole for a day to visit his mother, who was also a prisoner for the same cause, he met by the road one , an attorney, who reviled him most bitterly, and reproached him with his unfortunate circumstances in so taunting a manner, that Lilburn drew his sword, and running him through the body, left him dead on the spot : he was tried for the fact, and found guilty of manslaughter only, in consideration of the excessive provocation.'' \u2014 Surtees' Durham, vol. i. p. 258. The celebrated Colonel John Lilburn, or, as he was familiarly called, \" Free-born John,\" descended from this stock. He was born in Sunderland, where his father, Richard, resided in the year 1618. At an early age, he was sent to London, and put apprentice to Mr. Thomas Hewson, a wholesale clothier. The first display of his bold and intrepid spirit was exhibited in a complaint which he laid before the chamberlain of London, against his master, for ill usage. He carried his point, obtained redress, and lived afterwards in harmony and friendship with his master. In 1636, he was introduced to Dr. Bastwick, and carried to Hol land one of the doctor's anti-episcopal writings, in order to get it printed. In the following year, he was accused before the Star Chamber of publishing and dispersing seditious pamphlets. He was ordered to be examined, but refused to take the oath usual in that court, that he would answer interrogations, even though they might lead him to accuse himself. In thus refusing to become his own accuser, lie acted upon a funda mental principle of English jurisprudence ; but such constitutional conduct was construed into a contempt of court, and he was condemned to be whipped through the streets from the Fleet to AVestminster, to be fined \u00a3500, to stand two hours in the pillory, and to be imprisoned for life. He accordingly received, in his whipping at a cart's tail, from 500 to 1000 strokes from a three-lashed scourge, the cords of which had at least twenty knots: his shoulders were most dreadfully lacerated ; and in this situation he was placed uncovered in the pillory, and his sufferings aggravated by the intense heat of a July sun. Yet, amidst all this, Lilburn remained undaunted and unsubdued. AVhile he was whipped at the cart, and stood upon the pillory, he continued to declaim against oppression, and to scatter pamphlets among the surrounding popu-. lace. The Star Chamber, which was sitting at that very time in an adjoining house, ordered him to be gagged. But though both gagged and pilloried, he ceased not to stamp with his foot and gesticulate, in order to shew the people that, if he had it in his power, he would still harangue them. This behaviour gave fresh provocation to the Star Chamber ; and they ordered \" that when he was carried back to prison, he should be placed in solitary confinement, with irons on his hands, and legs, in the worst and most loathsome part of the Fleet, where the basest and most abandoned prisoners were accustomed to be confined ; and that no person, on any account, should ever be permitted to see him or give him money.\" From the want of nourishment and surgical assistance, he nearly perished in a violent fever. He, however, in some degree recovered, but continued confined in a dark and damp dungeon, till, on the meeting ofthe Long Parliament in 1040, he was allowed the liberties of the Fleet. AA^hen liberated by order of parliament, it appeared in evidence before the House of Lords, that the officers in the Fleet had endeavoured to starve him, and that he was with difficulty saved from assassination. In the same year, he and two or three others drew their swords upon Colonel Lunsford and his associates, who were menacing the people in Westminster Hall. For this proceeding, Lilburn, by special command of the king, was \" arraigned for his life,\" before the House of Lords, but dismissed. AA'hen the parliament raised an army, he entered as a volunteer; and, at the battle of Edge Hill, acted as a captain of infantry. At Brentford he distinguished himself as one of the bravest of a gallant band of 700 men, who, for the space of sive hours, in close fight, withstood the whole royal army. Though taken prisoners, yet their protracted resistance prevented the parliament's train of artillery from falling into the hands of the king, and consequently the city of London. Lilburn was imme^"], [401, "SUNDERLAND, S_c. 265 by their own exertions into some degree of commercial importance, mingled with Scotch settlers, and almost totally unconnected with any family possessed of hereditary rank or influence. During the reign of the profligate Charles II. and of his stupid successor James II. , the people of Sunderland experienced many annoyances for their non-conformity to the religion and politics of the court.* It was probably from their disbke to episcopal government that the charter of diately carried to Oxford, tried for high treason, and found guiltv. Scorning to save his life by submission, he boldly advocated the rights and privileges of the nation in open court. The execution of his sentence seems to have been suspended in consequence of the parliament threatening the lex talionis, or law of reta- liation, should any of their friends suffer death. By some means, Lilburn escaped, and was joyfully received by the parliamentary army. \" From this time,\" says Clarendon, \" he was entertained by Cromwell with great familiarity.\" But when he perceived that the public good was sacrificed to views of personal aggran- dizement, he, in 1645, relinquished the sword and resumed the pen. Soon after, he was committed to Newgate for seditious practices, but discharged without trial. He was next summoned before the House of Lords, when he boldly protested against their jurisdiction over him ; and after being sent to Newgate by their lordships, he incessantly attacked in pamphlets both the adherents of the king and of Cromwell, as both alike enemies to liberty ; and so popular were his principles, that the House of Commons deemed it prudent to order him to be released from prison. After the king's death, he opposed the leaders of the army with his usual intrepidity, and maintained the right of the people to form a constitution for themselves. Cromwell, being alarmed, committed Lilburn to the Tower ; and he was tried before a special commission for high treason, at Guildhall, in 1649. On this occasion, he was refused council, and put upon his defence without preparation : yet he justified himself with great ingenuity ; maintained that Cromwell's government was tyrannical, usurped, and unlawful; and insisted that the jury were judges both of fact and law. This last proposition was termed by Judge Jermin \" a damnable heresy.\" The jury, however, acquitted Lilburn, amidst the joyous acclamations of the people. \" Never,\" says Hume, \" did any established power receive so strong a declaration of its usurpation and invalidity ; aud from no institution, besides that of juries, could be expected this magnanimous effort.\" Foiled in this attempt upon the life of the invincible Lilburn, the parliament came to the extraordinary resolution of banishing him without trial for an alleged offence against Sir Arthur Ilaselrig. In obedience to this decree, Lilburn embarked, in 1651, for the United Provinces, and finally took up his residence at Amsterdam. After the dissolution of the Rump Parliament, he re- turned from banishment, for which he was again sent to the Tower, and, in 1653, tried at the Old Bailey for his life. \" He defended himself,\" confesses Lord Clarendon, \" with that vigour, and charmed the jury so powerfully, that, against aU the direction and charging the judge could give them, after no long consulta- tion between themselves, they returned with the verdict of Not Guilty ; nor could they be persuaded to change or recede from their verdict, which infinitely enraged and perplexed Cromwell, who looked upon it as a greater defeat than the loss of a battle.\" The jury were closely examined before the council of state respecting their obnoxious verdict. The joy and triumph of the people were exhibited in various ways ; and even medals were struck to commemorate this victory. The government, enraged at this display of popular feeling, ordered Lilburn to be sent out of the country ; but his brother, Robert, becoming security for his peaceable demeanour, he settled at Eltham, in Kent. Here he joined the Society of Friends, and preached at their meetings at AVoolwich and at other places till his death, in 1057, at the early age of thirty-nine. His wife also possessed an undaunted spirit, and was his faithful and affectionate helpmate in all his suffer- ings. Anthony AVood styles Lilburn \"a great trouble-world in all the variety of governments ;\" and others represent him of so factious and quarrelsome a temper, \"that if there were none living but him, John would be against Lilburn, and Lilburn against John.\" But it cannot be denied that his efforts in the public cause were not more zealous than they were pure and disinterested. At the close of his \" Legal and Fundamental Liberties of the People of England,\" he subscribes himself \"An honest and true-bred free Englishman, that never in his life feared a tyrant or loved an oppressor.\" Hume designates him as \" the most turbulent, but most upright and courageous of human kind;\" which is no ordinary eulogium from a writer that abhor red his political principles, and scoffed at his religious ones. \u2014 State Trials, vol. iv. p. 127- Thurlow's Slate Papers, No. 320.

In the case of Hicks versus Clerk, Levins II. 252, it was held that \" Sunderland is an ancient borough, consisting of twelve capital burgesses called burgesses, and twelve inferior burgesses called stallingers ; that each freeman, occupying a house, had commonage for two horses and four cows, and each stallinger for one cow; and the widow of a freeman or stallinger, being an inhabitant, had the like commonage after the husband's death.\" From 1654 to 1667, tradesmen's tokens were very generally issued in every considerable town throughout England, to supply the deficiency of government currency.

During the agitation arising from the rebellion in 1745, a mob, consisting chiefly of sailors, en tered the Catholic chapel, \" where they found several people at prayers, and a couple to be mar ried, who, with Mr. Hankins their priest, all fled out; upon which the sailors immediately pulled down their altar and crucifix, together with all the seats, the priest's robes, all their books, the furniture, and every individual thing in the room, and burnt them in a fire made for that purpose, and also a large library of books and papers belonging to the priest.* About the beginning of 1754, the amiable and ingenious Dr. Oliver Goldsmith, at that time studying the profession of physic in the university of Edinburgh, having involved himself in un expected difficulties by becoming security for a considerable sum of money due from a fellow student, was obliged precipitately to leave Scotland. A few days afterwards, he arrived in Sun derland, where he was arrested ; but his case being made known to Mr. Laughline Maclane and Dr. Sleigh, he was soon delivered from the hands of the bailiff, and took his passage on board a vessel to Rotterdam, whence, after a short stay, he proceeded to Brussels, and shortly afterwards made a tour of a great part of Europe on foot. On June 25, 1759, Jeremiah Bell, of the grenadier company in Colonel La Faussille's regiment of foot, quartered in Sunderland, was shot for repeated desertion. He suffered composedly. The memorable flood of November 17, 1771, which carried away the bridge of Newcastle, and destroyed three bridges and drowned three collieries on the AVear, also caused great destruction at Sunderland. The cries of the poor boys (few of the men being on board), with the cracking of the ships, were indeed terrible. All the assistance possible was sent by the inhabitants ; but the darkness and wetness of the night prevented many from receiving proper help. A great number of keels were driven away ; and many men and boys were lost. A part of the pier gave way to the force of the water, and another part was damaged by the ships which drove against it. Eight or nine dead bodies were cast ashore on the Sunday morning in the harbour. Hay-stacks and great quantities of household furniture, with a staith, were driven down the AVear into the sea. * Amongst the papers, one is said to contain a list of persons well affected to the government, and caUed odd friends, of which the following is given as a copy: \u2014 \"A List of odd Fries ds.

On October 22, 1775, while a gentlewoman was preaching in the Methodist meeting-house in this town, a false alarm of the galleries coming down was raised ; when, in the confusion that ensued, one young woman was killed, and many others were trampled down and miserably bruised. During a heavy gale of wind, on December 2, 1779' many stacks of chimneys were blown down at Sunderland, and ships driven from their moorings. The east part of the church-yard wall was also blown down, and two men were buried for some time in the ruins: one of them, named Muckle, was killed on the spot. January 7, 17-82, about twelve o'clock at night, a fire broke out in a ship in Sunderland harbour, close to Mr. Thornhill's quay ; and having her full complement of stores on board, with the guns loaded, the inhabitants and soldiers could give her no assistance, so that, as the fire proceeded, her guns were discharged, and at last it reached the powder-room, when she blew up. The sailors at Sunderland, on February 13, 17S3, came on shore, and proceeded in a large body in search of those persons who had informed the press-gangs against them. Those they found were mounted on poles, and carried through the street exposed to the insults of the populace. At length, the North York Militia was called out, and, with the civil authorities, succeeded in dis persing the mob. On November 19, 17-33, at night, the Free Masons' Lodge at Sunderland was discovered to be on fire ; and before it was extinguished, aU the furniture, pictures, &c. were consumed, and the house adjoining very much damaged. On January 24, 1794, the Good Intent, in Sunderland harbour, was discovered to be on fire ; but being towed into the middle of the river, the flames were prevented from communicating to any other vessel. The fire was not completely got under before several of her guns (which hap pened, at that time, to be loaded) went off\", and nearly the whole of her inside in the after-part was. consumed. This accident was owing to the carelessness of the boys, who had left a lamp burning on board. His Royal Highness Prince William of Gloucester arrived at Sunderland on October 3, 1796, to take the command of the troops in that place. On November 25 foUowing, a serious affray broke out between the Westminster Militia and the Lowland Fencibles, arising from one of the former corps having wantonly killed a tame favourite goat that belonged to the Fencibles. Both regiments drew up in battle array in the barrack ground; but, by the strenuous exertions of Prince AArilliam, order was restored, and the offender sent before a court martial. A transport arrived in Sunderland on October 8, 1796, with one hundred and fifty French emi grants on board, and who were accommodated with such conveniences as the barracks in Bishop-. wearmouth afforded. On March 27, 1801, the price of wheat having risen to 40s. a boll, a tumult took place in the corn-market ; when the windows of the inns to which the farmers resorted were broken, a quantity of corn was trodden under foot, and many of the farmers'1 carts were thrown into the river from tlie Ferry-boat Landing. Some of the rioters were committed to the Cage, but were soon liberated by the people. At last, the riot-act was read ; and a body of the Lancashire Militia kept guard round the George Inn during the night. On October 3, 1311, Thomas Elliott stood in the pillory at Sunderland, according to his sen tence, having been convicted of an assault on a young girl. The novelty of the scene brought to gether an immense concourse of people (supposed not less than 20,000), who behaved in the mos*. orderly manner, hardly a single insult being offered to the convicted delinquent."], [405, "SUNDERLAND, &c. 269 November 29, 1813, Sunderland was illuminated three nights, in commemoration of Holland and Hanoyrer being freed from the influence of France. Many devices and transparencies of \"Orange Boven,\" \"Wellington,\" &c. S_c. were displayed. During these rejoicings, the Quakers, having refused to light up, became the objects of popular fury. One of them had every square of glass in his house broken; while several empty tar-barrels blazed before his shop and house, to the great terror of his family and neighbours. This circumstance is worthy of record, because the progress of knowledge since that time renders it almost impossible that, at the present day, such scenes should be repeated in Sunderland. In the afternoon of March 2, 1815, a number of persons, principally keelmen and casters on the Wear, assembled in order to pull down the bridge which had been erected across Galley's Gill, near Bishopwearmouth, for the purpose of conveying the coal-waggons belonging to Messrs. Nes ham and Co. to the staiths below. They then proceeded to their work of destruction ; and, hav ing entirely pulled down the bridge, set fire to the staiths at the head of it, and burnt all the machinery which was erected there for the purpose of conveying the waggons down the inclined plane to the spouts, where the coals were put on shipboard without the intervention of keels. They also pulled down one house, and unroofed several others. The disturbance continued till a late hour at night, when a party of horse arrived from Newcastle, and dispersed the mob. One man was killed by some of the falling timbers striking him. The occasion of this tumultuous proceeding originated in an idea that other similar staiths were about to be erected upon the Wear, in consequence of which, there would not be so much employment for keelmen and casters. The injury done was estimated at =P6000. June 18, 1816, being the first anniversary of the battle of AA^aterloo, the veteran 33d regiment of foot, in Sunderland barracks, observed it as a high festival. Great rejoicings were made, in which many of the gentry of the town participated. September 18, 1816, many of the tradesmen in Sunderland injudiciously refused taking the shillings and sixpences that were plain, and without remains of the impression. In consequence of this, after dark, a large concourse of the poor inhabitants met and commenced an attack upon the shops of Messrs. Caleb AA'ilson, Nattrass, Middlebrook, AValton, Andrews, Hall, S_c. all grocers and flour-dealers; the windows of both shops and houses were nearly demolished, and the shop of Middlebrook completely gutted by the mob, who were seen running away with hams, bacon, gro ceries, &c. After the shop had been forced open, the 33d regiment were called out ; and on the riot-act being read about midnight, they prepared to act hostilely, when the mob in a great degree dispersed, but not before several soldiers received severe bruises from bricks, &c. The house of Mr. Barnes, surgeon, being at this time rebuilding, the mob took many hundred bricks for their destructive purposes. The town continued in great alarm and commotion for some time on this event. On Friday, October 18, 1816, a farmer, standing in the market of Sunderland, asked 16s. a bushel for his wheat, when a fellow standing by him forcibly seized upon tlie sack and ran off with it. This daring outrage was the signal for the whole of the corn being seized by the populace, and instantly the whole market became the scene of the utmost confusion and alarm. The shop keepers shut in their windows, the magistrates appeared and read the riot-act, and the military were ordered to be in readiness; but fortunately their services were not required. By the active exertions of about 50 or 60 special constables, the corn was nearly all recovered and tranquillity restored. vol. i. 3 2."], [406, "EASINGTON AVARD.\u2014 N. D. 270 On January 12, 1820, about half past nine o'clock at night, a fire broke out in the house occu pied by Mrs. Lynn, in New Cross Street, Sunderland. The flames burst out with great violence, and apprehensions were entertained for the safety of the neighbouring houses; but by the speedy arrival of the engines, and the exertions of the inhabitants, the fire was confined to the back part of the premises in which it commenced, and which it completely destroyed. Mrs. Lynn was herself unfortunately burnt to death. A bull was baited at Sunderland on May 28, 1822; when Simon Thornton, a poor man, was thrown down by the crowd, and had his legs broken, of which he soon after died. On the follow ing day, a fire broke out in the Sunderland Brewery, belonging to Messrs. Fenwick and Co., which did considerable damage before it was got under. August 31, 1822, His Royal Highness the Duke of Sussex descended the river AVear to Sun derland in Mr. Lambton's (Lord Durham) barge. The ships in the harbour were decorated with flags, and the people loudly cheered him. On entering the carriage that awaited his arrival, the populace took the horses out, and drew him to the bouse of A. Fenwick, Esq., where he partook of a cold collation. Previous to leaving Sunderland, his royal highness addressed the crowd, and thanked them for the kind reception with which they had honoured him. November 2, 1823, about four o'clock in the morning, the candle manufactory and loft of Mr. Caleb Wilson, in AValton Lane, was discovered to be on fire, which raged with great fury for above two hours, and was not arrested until the connected range of warehouses and about half of the stock had been consumed. On August 10, 1825, the Union Club of Seamen, having differed with the ship-owners, and ob serving a vessel going to sea manned with men not belonging to the port, determined on an attack. The principal ship-owners, who had been sworn in as special constables, were prepared to protect the vessel, which, however, was boarded by about 400 seamen, who threw the ship-owners and the crew ovei board, excepting the captain and mate. A party of dragoons having arrived, the riot-act was read ; and, as the mob refused to disperse, the military fired, when five persons were killed. His grace the Duke of AArellington visited Sunderland on October 4, 1827, where he was re ceived with the greatest .enthusiasm. During Tuesday, October 14, 1829, above 150 light coUiers had arrived safely in Sunderland harbour, and several sailed again loaden, with a fine north-west wind and a smooth sea ; but during the night, the wind having shifted to the north-east, a most tremendous sea came on, and morning presented one of the most awful spectacles witnessed there for many years. Day-light discovered four vessels lying on their broadsides on the south rocks ; and by three o'clock, P. M., there were 15 vessels on shore and wrecked between the south pier and Hendon. About four o'clock, the Eleanor of Monkwearmouth, which had sailed the day before for the northward, in putting back, sunk oft' the mouth of the harbour, and all on board perished, consisting of a father and son named HiUs, and two seamen, in sight of some thousands of spectators, unable to render the slightest assistance. Sunderland has been honoured in giving the title of Earl to two noble families. It was first conferred by Charles I. on Emanuel Lord Scrope, of Bolton, Lord President of the North ; but he dying without issue, on the 6th of June, 1643, the title was given to Henry Lord Spencer, of Wormleighton, who fell in the royal service, in the first battle of Newbury, in the same year. The honour still remains in his descendants, and is the third title of the Duke of Marlborough, Marquis of Blandford, and Earl of Sunderland."], [407, "SUNDERLAND, &c 271 History op Bishopwearmouth. When King Athelstan, about the year 930, in the course of an expedition against Constantine king of Scotland, visited the shrine of St. Cuthbert, he either gave or restored South AVearmouth to the see of Durham. Its limits were then more considerable than at present ; for, in the grant of \"the delightful vill of South AVearmouth\" were included AVeston, Offerton, and Silksworth, together with the two Ryhopes, Burdon, Seaham, Seaton, Dalton, Dalden, and Hesilden, which are stated to have been \" wrested from the church in former times through the malignity of evil men.\" In Boldon Book, AVearmouth and Tunstall are mentioned together. \" In AVermouthe and TunstaU are twenty-two tenants in villenage ; and six cottagers, whose work, rents, and services are like those of Boldon. The carpenter, who is aged, holds twelve acres for life, for making carts and harrows (for the tenants). The smith has twelve acres for the iron work of the carts, and finds his own coal. The pay and services of the Punder are the same as the Punder of Boldon (i. e. a landed salary of twelve acres, and a thrave of corn from every cart-load, and he pays 80 hens and 500 eggs). The two vills pay xxs. cornage, and provide two milch cows. The demesne is farmed with a stock of twenty draught oxen, two harrows, and 200 sheep. The rent, including the mill, is twenty pounds : the fisheries pay six pounds, and the borough of AVermouth twenty shillings.\" Under Hatfield's Survey, \" Thomas Menvill occupies a certain place called Hynden for tlie mooring of vessels, and pays 2s. John Hobson holds ten acres of the demesne, and pays 18s. 4d.

D. 272 Thus, during the period which had elapsed between the two surveys, many ofthe personal ser vices had been commuted for monied rents : these, in a few centuries, were rendered certain and immutable by custom. The Survey of Elizabeth notices no tenant in bond or villenage ; and at present nearly the whole vill of Bishopwearmouth is held by copy of court-roll under the bishop's manor of Houghton-le-Spring. Previous to the year 1649, the lands in the vicinity of Bishopwearmouth appear to have been, for the most part, undivided and in common pasture, called South Moor, Prest Moor, &c, and of very small value. But. in that year, the customary tenants were induced to improve their lands, now well situated on account of their contiguity to the town of Sunderland, which was stated to be \"just raised from obscurity, by its flourishing coal-trade, and enriched every day thereby,\" and unanimously came to an agreement to have their lands set out by distinct moots and boundaries. On this division, it appears that Building Hill and the quarry were reserved for the use of the copyholders at large, who had liberty to dig and carry away stones for building, without any pay ment or cost. This right, however, was opposed in the year 1767, hy Teasdale Mowbray, Esq., who conceived he had a right to levy a small charge on each copyholder carrying away stones from the quarry. The consequence of this proceeding was a law-suit, in which the late John ThornhiU, Esq., was defendant. Several witnesses* were examined, who proved that no charge had ever been made by any person on account of stone got and carried away by the copyholders from the quarry ; and the decision of the court was in favour of the defendant. A short distance to the west of Bishopwearmouth is a small parcel of ground, called tlie Burn. Fields, in which, from time immemorial, the inhabitants have had the privilege of bleaching their linen, and taking water for that purpose from the rivulet. These rights were, however, contested in an action at law, in the year 1760, but without success, and the above claims were recognized and acknowledged. On this occasion, the Burn Fields were described as a parcel of ground, then divided, but formerly consisting of one close, containing about six acres, with a rivulet running through the same, and otherwise called Howle-Eile Burns. Two young salters were married at Bishopwearmouth on May 21, 1752, on which occasion the plenty enjoyed in older times was strikingly exhibited. \" All relations and acquaintances on both sides were invited to the nuptials. They set forward to church about half an hour past seven, preceded by three violins and a bagpipe. Seventy couple went hand in hand, all distinguished by blue cockades, besides an innumerable multitude, which did not observe so just regularity. The bill of fare for dinner was as follows : 5 bushels of malt brewed for table-beer ; 10 bushels for ale i 16 quarters of lamb; 8 turkeys; 10 green geese; 8 hams; 4 dozen of hens; 12 ducks; 20 quar ters of mutton ; 10 quarters of veal ; 16 neats' tongues ; a quarter of beef roasted whole ; 20 stones, of beef boiled ; 6 bushels of white peas ; 80 pounds of butter ; 16 pies ; the bride's pie was carried between two, on a hand-barrow, to the bakehouse ; 20 gallons of brandy ; 8 dozen of lemons ; 7 stones of double refined sugar ; 10 bushels of wheat ; a hundredweight of tobacco ; 6 gross of * Amongst other things relative to the trial, an old man deposed, \" that lie had heard old John Richardson say, that the market was on the green, and that he shewed where the cross and the stalls stood \u2014 that the Sunderland people had stole the custom-house, then the market, and would steal the church if they could carry it.\" A woman stated, \" that her father went to the hill one night for his gavelock, and saw a waugh\" \u2014 also, that when a man of the name of Coward was \" digging this rock about ninety years ago, he found in a cavity, several fathoms from the surface, a large toad alive, with a nob on its head as big as aa egg, full o\u00a3 diamonds, and thereby got a great deal of money.\""], [409, "SUNDERLAND, &c. 273 pipes; tarts, whip possets, cheese-cakes, and jellies innumerable.

Sir William Lambton, who was killed at Marston Moor in 1644, left his estate in AVearmouth Panns settled in trustees for the use of his second wife, Dame Catherine Lambton, and her issue. Lady Catherine Lambton surrendered to her grandson, Frevill Lambton, of Hardwick, Esq., in 1683; and he, in 1714, surrendered the same premises to his cousin, AAlUiam Lambton, of Lambton, Esq. Another parcel of waste was granted de novo to John Heath, Esq., in 1586. In 1589, Heath surrendered to Ralph Lambton, Esq., whose son and heir, William Lambton (afterwards Sir William Lambton, Knt.), was admit ted in 1613, and the estate has since continued lineally in his descendants. A third parcel of waste, \" lying beneath Hoiddeape from the great Cove east to the grete Hinginge Scarr west, and extending from the lowest part of the bank twenty-four yards into the channel of the AVear,\" was granted de novo to John Lord Lumley, in 1600, for a staith or station for the loading and unload ing of coals. History of Monkwearmouth. Oswald, king of Northumberland, finding himself firmly seated on his throne after the defeat of Cedwell in 634, dispatched messengers to the Scots, desiring them to send suitable missionaries to teach his subjects the doctrines of Christianity. Aidan undertook the mission, and founded the see of Lindisfarne. In the time of this pious bishop, St. Hilda, aunt to Adulf, king of the Ea\u00abt Angles, became a veiled nun, and obtained a hide of land for a monastic establishment on the northern bank of the AArear. According to Bede, she rested here only one year, and then removed to Hartlepool, of which convent she became the superior. She afterwards deserted this place for Whitby, where her fame reached its highest elevation. But it is now impossible to identify the establishment of St. Hilda, on the north bank of the Wear, with the subsequent foundation of Benedict. -f The noble, pious, and learned Benedict, after having returned from his fourth journey to Rome, obtained from Egfrid, king of Northumberland, a grant of seventy hides of land. \\ AVith this munificent donation he founded the monastry of St. Peter's, Wearmouth, on the north side of the * Sykes' Local Records, p. 100. + Leland, quoting the legend called the \"Life of the veiled A'irgin Bega,\" which he saw in AAThitby Ab bey, says in effect, \" Bega, a native of Ireland, received the veil from the hands of Aidan, the first bishop of Lindisfarne, and became successively the founder of four several religious establishments: 1. The cell of St. Bees in Cumberland (which preserves her name, and which became subordinate to the monks of St. Mary's at York); 2. a small monastry on the north side of the AVear; 3. Hartlepool, where her fame has been eclipsed by the superior lustre of her disciple Hilda; 4. Hele, or Calcester. Greaveson adds in the margin, \" There is a humble church betwixt the mouths of the Tyne and AA'ear, dedicated to St. Hilde, and it standeth nearer to the Tyne than to the Wear. Its exact situation is on a headland called Sowter Point ; here possibly stood the little convent of St. Bee.\" stir. Young, in his History of AVhitby, thinks, with great probability, that this legend \" is a medley, composed of the lives of three or four saints jumbled together.\" X See History of Jarrow, p. 3. vol. i. \u2014 14. 4 A"], [410, "EASINGTON WARD\u2014 N. D. 274 mouth of the Wear, in 674. \" One year was spent in preparatory arrangements ; in the second, Benedict sent to France for masons able to build him a church of stone, after the Italian model ; and so fervent was the zeal of the founder, that within one year from laying the foundation, he had the gratification of celebrating mass within the walls. And now, seeing the masonry nearly completed, Benedict sent again into France for glaziers, who completed the windows of his church, his cloisters, and his cells, and instructed, moreover, the Saxons in their mystery, which, adds Bede, with a simplicity which strongly marks the novelty of the art, is both admirably calculated to supply our churches with light, and also not unworthy, \" haud ignobiliter aptum,\" to be em ployed in furnishing many of the consecrated vessels of the altar. Bede expressly states, that the craft of the glazier was as yet unknown in Britain. AVilfrid, archbishop of York, had, however, glazed the windows of his cathedral in 67- ; but he imported the glass, and, for aught that ap pears to the contrary, the honour of introducing the mystery of vitrification rests, on the sufficient authority of Bede, with a Saxon abbot of the Northumbrian province. \" Yet Benedict sighed for ornaments of which even the gay realm of France was destitute ; and, after settling the monastic rule of his foundation, and committing the charge of its government to his vice-abbot, Easterwin, he undertook a fifth and final journey to Rome, and returned with riches far exceeding the most abundant harvest of his former ventures. The importation consisted, 1. of an innumerable store of books ; 2. an abundant grace of holy reliques ; 3. be imported Bro ther John, arch-chanter or leader of the choir of St. Peter's at Rome, who instructed the monks of AVearmouth in the whole order of psalmody, and the complete ceremonial of the Church of Rome ; not only instructing them viva voce, but pricking them out a course for a whole year,* which, saith Bede, is yet reverently preserved in the convent ; 4. an epistle of privilege and immunity for the house of AVearmouth, granted by Pope Agatho, at the request of Egfrid ; 5. lastly, paintings of holy subjects, of which those of the A7irgin Mother of heaven, and of the twelve apostles, deco rated the main roof of his temple, the painting extending from wall to wall. The south wall was covered with subjects taken from the evangelists, and the terrific visions of John's Apocalypse covered the north wall. Thus, adds Bede, the humble disciple, whose ignorance of letters excluded learning at one inlet, might feel his faith confirmed, and his religious impressions strengthened, by surveying, whithersoever he turned, either the gracious countenance of his Saviour, the awful mystery of the incarnation, or the terrific scene of the last judgment.\" Soon after the completion of the monastry of Wearmouth, King Egfrid gave to tbe Abbot Be nedict yet another grant of forty hides of land, with which he founded the monastry of St. Paul of Jarrow ; and when he appointed Easterwin abbot, or, rather, vice-abbot, of his original house, he prefixed Ceolfrid over his new foundation of St. Paul's. Easterwin, the second abbot of Wearmouth, was a courtier and a relation of the pious Benedict. Bede praises the virtues and unaffected humility of this abbot, who died of the plague, after dis charging the duties of his office for nearly seven years. The surviving brethren had elected Sig frid, a man of sufficient learning, of exceUent morals, and of admirable temperance, but labouring under an incurable disorder of the lungs. Benedict, who arrived at this period from his fifth Ita- * The Abbot John (for such he was) had another business on hand of not less importance \u2014 to carry to Britain the decree of Pope Martin, and a hundred and five assisting bishops, against the heretics who main tained \"one operation and will in the person of Christ.\" Having executed both functions faithfully, and diffused orthodox religion and pricksong through the northern provinces, he re-crossed the channel, and, dying on his return, was buried in his own abbey of St. Martin of Tours \u2014 Bede, iv. 18."], [411, "SUNDERLAND, &c. 275 lian pilgrimage, was himself suffering under illness, which he sustained with firmness during the three last years of his life. His last exhortations recommended to his brethren unity amongst themselves, obedience to Rome, and the election of an abbot, distinguished rather by piety and learning than by birth or rank : \" Believe me,\" he added, \" I had rather see this spot on which our convent stands reduced to a desert wilderness, than that my brother, who, as ye know, walks in the way of the flesh, should succeed me in my office.\" These apprehensions evidently pointed to a practice not totally infrequent, of converting the headship of religious houses into a successive and almost lay inheritance. To avoid such a mischance, Benedict prevailed on Sigfrid, who was also dying, to appoint Ceol- frid, abbot of St. Paul's of Jarrow, to the government of both houses, or rather, says Bede, of that one monastry situated in two places. The holy Benedict died in the first year of Ceolfrid, A. D. 689, who remained sole abbot of Wearmouth and of Jarrow during one and twenty years. Within that period, he added largely to the plate and sacred vestments of the church, and nearly doubled the contents of the library. Amongst his literary acquisitions are particularly mentioned two pan- dects of the new translation, added to one of the old version, formerly brought from Rome. Of these valued volumes Ceolfrid, when he made a pilgrimage to Rome in his latter time, took one copy with him for a gift, and left one other to each of his convents. Nor did Ceolfrid only buy but sell to advantage, for he procured from King Aldfrid eight hides of land on the river Fresca, in exchange for a book of Cosmography, of admirable execution, which Benedict brought from Rome; a bargain begun in Benedict's time, but not brought to a conclusion at his death.* After- wards, Ceolfrid exchanged his land on the Fresca, paying the just difference, for twenty hides at a spot nearer and more convenient to the convent, which the inhabitants call ad villam Sambuce. Ceolfrid also obtained fresh letters of immunity from Rome, similar to those of Pope Agatho, which were exhibited before the synod of bishops, and ratified by the subscription of King Alfred. In those days, AVitmer, the servant of Christ, gave land of ten hides in Daldun to the monastry. After a long series of years, spent in the strict observance of the monastic rule, Ceolfrid deter mined on devoting the remaining portion of his life and strength to the exercises of religion in the sacred city of Rome, which he had already visited in his youth, during one of the five pilgrimages of Benedict. Recommending to the monastics the choice of a younger abbot, according to the holy rule of Benedict, Ceolfrid resisted aU the tears and intreaties of his brethren, and prepared for his journey with such ardent zeal, that, on the third morning from that on which he first pub- * \" On Benedict Biscop's return from his last journey to Rome and France, he imported two cloaks, woven entirely of silk, and most admirably wrought.

About 200 yards to the north-west of the church, in a garden, there was, a few years ago, an ancient well, formerly known by the name of the Monk's AVell, which, according to tradition, belonged to the monastry. It is now built over; but remains of it may still be traced in the walls of a house lately erected on its scite. \u2014 Wilcock' s Lives ofthe Abbots. Dr. CoUingwood, in his antiquarian collections, writes, that \"near the dock and staith of Lord Durham was formerly a well of excellent water, from which the shipping was supplied, and known to the older inha bitants by the name of the Castle Well. Several years ago, an ancient sculptured stone and some fragments were dug up near it, at the bottom of the cliff, from the top of which they may probably have fallen. The name of castle might originate from its proximity to some castellum, or monastic building, which may have existed near the situation of the present rectory, near the east angle of the rock from the Rector's Gill.\" On the north side of the Rector's Park, a wall formerly went down towards the river, caUed the Castle Wall ; and the street near this part of the town is called Castle Street, all probably deriving their names from some monastic house built on the south side of the AVear."], [412, "EASINGTON WARD.\u2014 N. D. 276 licly declared his resolution, all things were ready for his departure.* After the first mass there fore had been sung, and after all present had received the holy communion, he girded himself for his pilgrimage. The brethren were all assembled in the church of St. Peter; and Ceolfrid, after kindling the incense and bowing before the altar, turned towards the west, and, standing on the altar steps, and holding the flaming censer in his hand, pronounced his latest blessing on all. Loud sobs and cries mingle with the responses of the Litany, and the monks throng into the oratory of St. Laurence, which is opposite to the dormitory, to hear the last precepts of their abbot. And now the whole convent attend him to the river strand, and kneel to receive the kiss of peace. Ceolfrid ascends the bark, and pronounces his last farewell from the deck ; the deacons elevate the cross, and wave their burning tapers ; the skiff glides across the Wear, and Ceolfrid springs on his horse and disappears. After three days of prayer and humiliation, the brethren, who on this occasion, notwithstanding the late ravages of pestilence, mustered 600 monks in St. Peter's alone, proceeded, with the con sent of a few of the elders of the house of Jarrow, to raise Hu\u00e6tbert, a monk of St Peter's, to the government of both monastries. Immediately on his election, the new abbot, with a fe.w monks selected from both convents, hastened to overtake Ceolfrid. They found him still awaiting the arrival of his vessel on the coast, and, announcing the election, received his confirmation, and sent by him a commendatory epistle to Pope Gregory.-f- Hu\u00e6tbert, the fifth abbot of Wearmouth, is the last whose name has been recorded. It is thought that he survived Bede, after whose death the glimmerings of historical light, through the desolating and melancholy period that followed, are insufficient to dispel the shadows of darkness.j * The Benedictine order was founded by St. Benedict, who was born in Italy about the year 480, and was educated at Rome. AVhen only 14 years of age, he secluded himself from the world in a cavern for several years ; and, when discovered, was chosen abbot of a neighbouring monastry. Dissatisfied, however, with their manners, he again retired into solitude, where he acquired so much fame and influence as to be able to found twelve monastries. He died, according to some, in the year 543. His followers are more properly called Monks ; the other orders are better denominated Friars; or Religious. The Benedictines are also called Black Monks, from the loose black gowns they wore. According to the Benedictine compu tation, there have been of this order 24 popes, 200 cardinals, 7000 archbishops, 15,000 bishops, 15,700 ab bots, 4000 .aints, 40,000 confessors, and above 3000 martyrs and apostles, who have converted 30 provinces to the Christian faith, besides emperors, kings, &c. This order has produced a great number of eminent men. Th*. last Benedictine in England was Father Buckley, who, in 1607, erected the establishment at Doway in the Netherlands. The rule of this order recommended the monks to observe obedience, silence, and humility ; to note the hours for divine service by day and night, as well as the order and manner of performing it ; and to specify the punishments that were to be inflicted on offenders. It seems to have been Benedict's intention to form an order whose discipline should be milder, their establishment firmer, and their manners more regular than those of other monastic bodies ; and whose members, during the course of a holy and peaceful life, were to divide their time between prayer, reading, the education of youth, and other pious and learned labours. However, in time, having acquired immense riches, they lost sight of their duties, sunk into luxury, intem perance, and sloth, disregarded the rule, and took part in political cabals and court factions. They are now reformed, and some are employed as missionaries in England. t See Surtees, vol. ii. p. 4, et seq.

In the same year, they penetrated to the Tyne; and, in 870, Halfden landed at Tynemouth, with another strong party of pirates, and laid the whole adjoining country in ashes. This, then, is the latest date that can be assigned for the destruction of the monastry of AVear mouth. \" Yet,\" observes Surtees, \" if Malmsbury be correct, the monastry of St. Peter's must have risen from its ashes to perish again in the ruinous inroad of King Malcolm, two centuries later. That Malcolm, in the same expedition in which he bore off Edgar Atheling and his sisters from the harbour of the Wear, did destroy a church or monastry on one bank of the same river, seems indisputably established by the testimony of concurring historians. But this fact is related with such discrepancy both of date and place, as to leave very reasonable doubts whether the scite of the church which perished in the fury of Malcolm can be identified with that of the monastry which fell in the earlier desolation of the Danes; and Simeon, whose silence as to tlie almost contemporary destruction of Malcolm is strong negative evidence, expressly says, that from the \u00e6ra of the Danish conquest to the revival of the monastry by Aldwin, the scite of the convent of Wearmouth lay waste and desolate two hundred and eight years.\" When Aldwin and his brother monks were recalled from Melrose (see page 6), they settled, ac cording to Simeon, where they were ordered, in Benedict's old fire-scathed monastry of AVear mouth. Then, says he, began they to clear the church of St. Peter's, of which only crumbling walls, smirched with flame and smoke, were left standing, to root up the thorns and briars which matted the choir, and to restore the roof \" as it stands at this day,\" residing, whilst the structure was rising, in huts of boughs wattled together. Bishop AValcher gave to the reviving monastry, as separated it should seem from Jarrow, the vill of North AA'earmouth ; and his successor, Wil liam de Carilef, added the adjoining vill of Southwick ; but the independence of the monastry of AArearmouth lasted but for a span ; for, in 1083, the same Bishop William removed the monks, both of AVearmouth and Jarrow, to Durham, and reduced both houses into cells dependant on the monastry of St. Cuthbert. From this date, Wearmouth sunk into a subordinate cell, inhabited by a few monks, governed by a superior who bore the title of Master of Wearmouth. Betwixt the period of this reduction and the dissolution, the history of the cell consists chiefly of some litigations with the powerful Barons of Hilton, relative to the rights of sepulture in the private chapel of Hilton, and to some contested claims of tithes and offerings. In 1285, Prior Richard Claxton retired to the cell of Wearmouth ; and, in 1322, Prior Galfrid de Burdon had, on his resignation, the same cell, with the tithes of FulweU assigned for his support. At the dissolution, the whole revenues of the cell of Wearmouth amounted, on the highest estimate, but to \u00a326, 9s. 9d. per annum, and, according to Dugdale, \u00a325, 8s. 4d. In 1545, Henry VIIL* granted the cell of Wearmouth to Thomas AVhytehed (a near relative of Hugh Whytehed, who surrendered the priory of Durham in 1540, and became the first dean of the new cathedral in 1541). In 1598, AViUiam AVhytehed, son and. heir of the original grantee, conveyed the manor of North Wearmouth to John Widdrington, * \" All the house and scite of the late cell of AVermouth, with all messuages, &c. and three closes of ara ble land, containing 60 acres, a close of pasture 53 acres, a close of land, furze, and heath, called AVestfelde, and the banks adjoining, 18 acres, the Calwerds meadow 16 acres, the Calfe close an acre and half, eight cottages with two acres, and a free fishery in the AVear, [and all the messuage formerly in the tenure of iUch.

Colonel George Fenwick, of Brinkburn, an active parliament officer, a sequestrator, and of the committee for the ejection of scandalous ministers, purchased the bishop's manor of Houghton-le- Spring and the borough of Sunderland of the parliament in 1646, but which possessions reverted to the see at the Restoration. He also, by some means, after 1641, became possessed of the estate of North AVearmouth. By Alice, daughter of Sir Edward Apsley, Colonel Fenwick left two daugh. ters : Elizabeth, who married Sir Arthur Haslerigge, Bart. ; and Dorothy, who married Sir Tho mas Williamson, of Nottinghamshire, the heir of a ruined loyalist, who lost _P30,000 in the king's cause. \" Lady AViUiamson,\" says Hutchinson, \" was seized of one moiety of Monk-AVeremouth, as coheir to her father, Col. Fenwicke, which she conveyed to trustees for the uses of her own will, 18 Oct. 1682. She afterwards, in 1689, purchased the other moiety from her nephew, Sir Thomas Heslerigg, son of the well known Sir Arthur, which she settled to the same uses ; and by will, 28 Oct. 1699, she devised the whole estate to her husband, Sir Thomas, for life, with remainder to her husband's nephew, after Sir AViUiam AViUiamson, with several remainders over.\" Sir Thomas AViUiamson died 23d April, 1703, and was succeeded by his nephew, Sir William AViUiamson, Bart.

His eldest son, Fenwick Williamson, having died in 1737, he was succeeded by his second son, Sir Hedworth Williamson, of Monkwearmouth and of Whitburn, and who also held the office of high sheriff from 1747 until his death, 13th January, 1789- He married Eliza beth, daughter and heir of AVilliam Huddleston, of Milburn Castle, Cumberland, Esq., and was succeeded by his second son, Sir Hedworth AViUiamson, Bart., who likewise, by patent, held the office of high sheriff of the county palatine from 1789 until 14th March, 1810, when he died. He married Maria, daughter of Sir John Hamilton, of Monaghan in Ireland, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Sir Hedworth Williamson, Bart., the present proprietor, born November 1, 1797- He was, without opposition, elected member of parliament for the county of Durham at the begin ning of the present session. The scite of the cell of Monkwearmouth is well ascertained on or near the spot afterwards occu pied by Monk-Wearmouth Hall. AVhen Hutchinson wrote, he states that the remains of the mo nastic buildings formed \" three sides of a square with the church.\" But on April 13, 1790, a fire broke out at the east end of the hall, and spread with such rapidity that the whole was totally destroyed, except a small building to the west. It would, however, be difficult to appropriate this remain to the monastry, or to the residence of the Whyteheds and Widdringtons. A plot of ground to the north of the church is called Monk's Garth; and it is conjectured that the burial ground of the monastry has once extended considerably in that direction. Indeed, the remains of human skeletons have been frequently found in various parts of Monkwearmouth. The Hall is described by Surtees to have been a large, noble, old mansion, built about the age of James I. It formed, as before observed, three sides of a square with the church. The kitchens, which fronted to the east, and closely adjoined the church, were lofty and spacious, with large square windows, divided by stone mullions and transoms: these had very probably formed part of the monastic offices. A large dining-room was pannelled with dark oak, on which were painted"], [415, "SUNDERLAND, &c. 279 landscapes and hunting pieces; the staircase also was of dark oak. Several of the offices were probably reared out of tbe remains of the monastic buildings. Churches, Chapels, &c. Sunderland Church. In the year 1719, the borough of Sunderland being so greatly increased in population that it was impossible for the inhabitants to be received to the offices of the church at Bishopwearmouth, an act of parliament was obtained for establishing an independent rectory. The preamble to the act states, \"That Bishopwearmouth was the only parochial structure, and was totaUy inadequate to contain, with the other inhabitants of the parish, the population of Sunderland, amounting to 6000 souls ; that a beautiful church had been erected, with a vestry-room, and a dwelling-house for a minister or rector to live in, upon a parcel of ground, part of one of the common fields of Sunderland, called the Intack, and had inclosed or doled out a parcel of ground adjoining thereto, for a cemetery or church-yard.\" By this act, Sunderland was made a rectory, the patronage of which should for ever appertain to the bishop of Durham. A vestry or association of inhabitants was instituted, consisting of twenty-four persons, having freehold estates of the value of .C10, to be chosen by the parishioners, and to continue in office three years ; in which vestrymen was vested a power to make ordinances and by-laws for the regulation of the new parish, to be ratified by two justices; to appoint a sca venger, and to assess on estates, real and personal, and stock in trade, a sufficient sum, for the purposes therein mentioned, and particularly for paying to the rector a yearly stipend of _P80, and a competent sum to the scavenger, to be levied by warrant from two or more justices of the peace. The rectory to be discharged of first fruits, tenths, procurations, and synodals; but the tithes of fish, corn, and hay, were reserved for the rectory of Bishopwearmouth, the new rectory taking only Easter reckonings, surplice fees, and other small dues. At present, these produce, on an average, _f?230 a year ; but as most of the opulent families reside in Bishopwearmouth, and many of the working classes pay some of the smaller dues with great reluctance, it is not probable that this sum will in future be much increased. Sunderland church, dedicated to the Holy Trinity, was built about the year 1719, and conse crated* by the bishop of London on the 5th of September in that year. The expense of the erec tion was defrayed partly by voluntary contribution, and partly by money collected by a brief. It is a plain, neat structure, built of brick, with stone mouldings round the windows and doors. The interior is handsome, and comprises a regular nave, side aisles, and chancel. The aisles are formed by seven elegant pillars on each side, with Corinthian capitals. The altar stands in a circular recess, covered by a dome, and supported in front by two fluted columns of the Corinthian order. The pulpit is elegant ; and a spacious gallery fills the west end of the nave, the front of which is embellished by the royal arms, and those of Lord Crewe, bishop of Durham. Adjoining the organ is a gallery for the singers; and an upper one was erected for the use of the poor in 1821. The whole interior is kept remarkably clean ; and, during the evening service, it is lighted with gas. * Dr- stlangay preached the consecration sermon, for which he Mas rewarded by the bishop of Durham with a prebend in the cathedral church; although, according to the account of Dr. Richard Grey, then Ids domestic chaplain, his lordship never read any part of it, except the dedication, being perfectly satisfied therewith. \u2014 Hutchinson."], [416, "EASINGTON WARD.\u2014 N.

The leno-th of this church, including the tower, is 135 feet ; the length of the nave 72 feet, and the breadth 54 feet. In 1803, a new roof was built, under the direction of Mr. AAllson, the archi tect of the iron bridge across the Wear ; the expenses of constructing which, together with nine teen new windows, were defrayed by the money obtained for the lead that was removed from the roof, whicii originally appears to have cost only \u00a324.

In every other part of the church, burial is with great propriety pro hibited. Above the vestry is a small parochial library. The church-yard is one of the largest in England, and has, at different times, been improved, and raised by ballast. On July 28, 1819, part of the adjoining moor, which had been added to the cemetery, was consecrated by the bishop of Oxford. The whole space is already nearly covered with tombs and head-stones.

He was the second son of John and Isabel Farrer, who lived on a small, but independent freehold of their own. His mother was descended from the family that produced the celebrated Joseph Addison. At a proper age, he was placed at Appleby school, under the care of Richard Yates, M. A., a man of great and well-deserved reputation as a teacher of youth, and under whom he made a good proficiency in the customary studies of the place, stir. Yates, who had experienced the advantage of an university education, was anxious to have the same advantages extended to a favourite scholar, and therefore was not sparing of his advice to the father of the young man, to send him to Queen's College, in Oxford, the foundation of which is limited to natives of Cumberland and AA'estmoreland. But his father, being burthened with a numerous family, could not afford to send him to college : lie therefore, at an early age, became a teacher at Aycliffe, in the county of Durham, and afterwards an assistant to his old master, stir. Yates. In his 20th year, he removed to New castle upon Tyne, at which place he corresponded with his friend, Langhorne the poet, part of which cor respondence appeared in a periodical publication of 1758. From Newcastle he removed to Bishop-Auckland, where lie was admitted by Bishop Trevor successively into the orders of deacon and priest in 1759 and 1760. In the latter year, he became master of the grammar-school in Bishop-Auckland, and assisted in the duty of that parish- In 1762, he married Frances, one of the daughters of Sir AVilliam Richardson, Bart. ; and, in 1765, accepted the curacy of AVhickham. Immediately after, John Cuthbert, Esq., gave him the nomina tion to the perpetual curacy of AVitton-le-Wear, with Hamsterley in reversion. The income of both was extremely scanty ; but the deficiency he made up by opening a school, in which he and assistants taught every branch of education suitable to the future destinations of the boys. His scholars amounted to about 100, and were mostly distributed amongst the houses in the village. He composed several elementary tracts for the use of beginners, in English, Latin, and Greek. Bishop Egerton had made him a conditional offer of St. Andrew's, the mother-church of Bishop-Auckland ; but the condition was more than he could engage to bring about. Bishop Barrington, however, had not been long in the possession of the see, before he offered him the rectory of Sunderland. stir. Farrer was at this time a mourner for the loss of his wise, who had been a valuable associate to him in the management of a numerous household, and whose death now made a chasm in his domestic economy that was not to be repaired. Thus unsettled in his plans, he, after some hesitation, accepted an appointment that would vary the scene, and change his occupation ; though he could not but be sensible that the charge was great, and that he would be no gainer in emolument.

The scite was given by Marshall Robinson, of Herrington, Esq. The edifice is an oblong square, built of brick, and ornamented with hewn stone. The roof is one of the largest in England not supported by pillars. It contains three spacious galleries, one of which is generally appropriated for the use of the soldiers in the neighbouring barracks ; and all the seats in the middle gallery on the north side, excepting the front seats, are now free and open to the public. The organ stands at the back of the west gaUery ; and the communion table is placed in a.circular recess at the east end. Underneath is a vault containing the remains of stir.

The right of presentation for twenty-one years was reserved to stir. Thornhill ; the subsequent patronage was vested in the see of Durham. In 1769, stir. Thornhill endowed the chapel with i?10 per annum, out of copyholds in the parish of Sunderland.

Having now a greater command of time, he indulged in occasional excursions, in which he was commonly guided by the calls of health, affection, or duty. These were, in general, limited to the neighbouring counties ; nor, till his 70th year, had he ever crossed the Trent. At this advanced period, however, he set out for the metro polis, in company with one of his nearest neighbours and most valued friends. During the three months that he remained in town, he experienced all that cordial welcome that he had been encouraged to expect. Out of respectful compliment to their old preceptor, now a visitor among them, a number of his pupils agreed to invite him to a festal entertainment at the London Tavern ; when the memory of their boyish days at AVitton was retraced in a tone of interest that was heightened by a concurrent recollection of the various scenes of life that had since intervened ; and it was a grateful circumstance, that the company, then assembled, composed an unbroken series of scholars, through the whole course of years that he had been a teacher at AAritton. His visit to the metropolis was an engaging subject of remembrance and conversation for the remainder of his life, which was now drawing near a close; for, after an illness of no long duration, which was alleviated as much as possible by the affection of his daughter and the attention of his medical friends, he died on the 23d of November, 1808, at the close of his 73d year, and was buried among his pa rishioners at Stanwix.

This church is supposed to have been endowed and founded shortly after the grant of Athelstan ; but the structure, as it stood in 1806, had undergone so many repairs and additions at very differ ent dates, that few vestiges of the early Saxon architecture remained.* The aisles were formed by two regular rows of round pillars with roiled capitals, supporting circular arches ; and the nave had four clerestory windows north and south above the aisles. The west tower rose from low, round pilasters, supporting pointed arches at the sides and a higher round arch towards the nave. The whole of the lights in the body of the church were modern. In 1806, this building having not only become ruinous and uncomfortable, but also \"much too small to contain the increased population of the place,\" the nave and aisles were unroofed, and part of the side walls taken down ; the whole of the pillars and arches of the interior were removed, and the aisles raised to an equal height with the nave, so as to admit a gallery running round three sides of the church. A still greater additional space was obtained, by throwing twenty-four feet of the chancel to the body of the church, together with a large north porch which adjoined the present vestry : the west tower was taken down and rebuilt, the south porch removed, and a west entrance opened under the new tower. The chancel, which remains unaltered except in the reduction of its dimensions, opens into the nave under a lofty pointed arch springing from corbeils. The proposed addition to the nave rendered it necessary to remove the arch ; but the stones were all carefully numbered, and replaced by exact admeasurement in their original form. The east window is ancient, and divided into five lights ornamented with tracery ; but it is much deformed by an ugly modern brick chimney. A porch on the north of the chancel is used as a vestry. The al terations in AArearmouth church were begun in December, 1806 ; the chancel was opened for service in 1808; and the whole work finished in 1810. At the same time, a new burial-ground was pur chased, and, being enlarged by a parcel of the bishop's waste, was consecrated August 9, 1810. The present church is a neat, substantial edifice ; and the steeple is a lofty square tower, con taining six musical bells. The pulpit and reading desk are formed of oak, without ornament, and stand at the north side of the arch entering the chancel. The chancel, which was greatly im proved by the Rev. Dr. Smith near the commencement of the last century, is double stalled on each side with oak, in the cathedral style, and ornamented with a carved entablature in open work. The altar-rails form a square, and are neatly varnished.

D. an eminent philosopher, and one of the brightest ornaments of the Church of England, was born at Peterborough in July, 1743, and was educated by his father, who was the head master of Giggleswick school, in Yorkshire, vicar of Helpstone in Northamptonshire, and a minor canon of Peter borough. In his earliest days, he manifested a taste for solid knowledge, and a peculiar activity of mind. In November, 1758, he was admitted a sizar of Christ's College, Cambridge, and, before he went to reside there, was taught the mathematics by Mr. AVilliam Howarth, a master of some eminence at Dishworth, near Rippon. In December, 1759, soon after he took up his residence in the university, he obtained a scholar ship, and applied to his studies with such diligence as to make a distinguished figure in the public schools, particularly when he took his bachelor's degree in 1763. He was afterwards employed for about three years as assistant at an academy at Greenwich. In 1765, he obtained the first prize for a prose Latin disserta tion ; the subject proposed was \"A comparison between the Stoic and Epicurean philosophy, with respect to the influence of each on the morals of a people,\" in which he took the Epicurean side. Having received deacon's orders, he became curate to Dr. Hinchliffe, then vicar of Greenwich, and after wards bishop of Peterborough ; and, when he left the academy above-mentioned, continued to officiate in the church. In June, 1766, he was elected a fellow on the foundation of Christ's College, and at the en suing commencement took his degree of sti. A. He did not, however, return to his residence in college until October, 17(>7, when he engaged in the business of private tuition. On the 21st of December, 1767, he was ordained a priest by Bishop Terrick. In 1768, he became assistant tutor in his college; and, in 1772, he was admitted to an equal share in the tuition with Dr. Shepherd and stir. Law. In 177L he was appointed one of the AVhitehall preachers. The duties of college tutor stir. Paley discharged with uncom mon assiduity and zeal; and the whole of his system of tuition, as gi-^en by his biographer, appears to have been eminently calculated to render instruction easy, pleasant, and of permanent effect. After he had spent about ten years as college tutor, he quitted the university in 1776. In the previous year, he attached him self to Miss Jane Hewitt, a handsome and pleasing young lady of the city of Carlisle, to whom his suit was successfully preferred, and they were married in June, 1776. His first benefice in the church was the rec tory of Musgrove, in Westmoreland, worth only about \u00a380 a year, which he obtained in the month of May,"], [423, "SUNDERLAND, &c. 287 generally entitled to receive all manner of tithe in kind from the townships of Wearmouth, Tun stall, and Silksworth : the township of Burdon is exempt from payment of hay-tithe, and a part of Ryhope from corn-tithe. The rector receives tbe tithe of fish from Sunderland.\" It should be 1775- In December, 1776, he was inducted into the vicarage of Dalston, in Cumberland; and, not long after, to the living of Appleby, in AVestmoreland, worth about \u00a3300 per annum. In 1776, a new edition of Bishop Law's \" Reflections on the Life and Character of Christ,\" originally published in the \" Consideration on the Theory of Religion,\" was given in a separate form at Cambridge, for the use ofthe students. To this treatise some brief \"Observations on the Character and Example of Christ\" were added, with an \" Appendix on the Morality of the Gospel ;\" both from stir. Paley's pen. AVhile at Appleby, he published a small volume, selected from the Book of Common Prayer and the writ- ings of some eminent divines, entitled \" The Clergyman's Companion in visiting the Sick.\" This useful work at first appeared without his name; but it has passed through nine editions, and is now printed among his works. In June, 1780, he was collated to the fourth prebendal stall in the cathedral church of Carlisle, and thus became coadjutor in the chapter to his friend Mr. Law, who was now archdeacon; but in 1782, upon Dr. Law's being created an Irish bishop, Mr. Paley was made archdeacon of the diocese, and, in 1785, he succeeded Dr. Burn, author of \" The Justice of Peace,\" in the chancellorship. For these different pre- ferments he was indebted either to the venerable bishop of Carlisle, Dr. Law, or to the dean and chapter of the cathedral church. AA'hile his residence was divided between Carlisle and Dalston, stir. Paley engaged in the composition of his celebrated work, \"The Elements of Moral and Political Philosophy;\" but hesi- tated long as to the publication, imagining there would be but few readers for such a work; and he was the more determined on this point after he had entered on the married state, thinking it a duty that he owed his family to avoid risking any extraordinary expense. To remove this last objection, Dr. John Law pre- sented a living then in his gift to stir. Paley, on the promise that he would consider it as a compensation for the hazard of printing ; and he immediately set about preparing his work for the press, which appeared in 1785, in quarto. When at Dalston, in addition to his ordinary duties, he gave a course of lectures on the New Testament, on the Sunday afternoons. There is no part of his character more justly entitled to respect than the active and zealous discharge of his professional duties, and his even enlarging them, as in this instance, when he thought it would be for the benefit of his flock. AVhile officiating as examining chaplain to the bishop of Carlisle, he caused a new edition to be published of Collyer's \" Sacred Interpreter,\" a work which he re- commended to candidates for deacon's orders. In 1788, he joined to his other meritorious labours an effort in favour ofthe abolition of the slave trade, and corresponded with stir. Clarkson and the committee whose endeavours have been since crowned with success. On the death of the venerable bishop of Carlisle in 1787, stir. Paley drew up a short memoir of him. His next work places him in a high rank among the advocates for the truth and authenticity of the Christian scriptures. It is entitled \" Hor\u00e6 Paulin\u00e6 ; or, the Truth of the Scripture History of St. Paul evinced, by a comparison of the Epistles which bear his name with the Acts of the Apostles, and with one another,\" which he dedicated to his friend, Dr. John Law, at that time bishop of Killala. Soon after, he compiled a small work, entitled \" The Young Christian instructed in Reading, and the Principles of Religion.\" This having brought upon him a charge of plagiarism, he defended himself in a good-humoured letter in the Gen tleman's Magazine. Previously to the appearance of these works, he was offered by Dr. Yorke, bishop of Ely, the mastership of Jesus College, Cambridge, which, after due deliberation, he declined. In May, 1792, he was instituted to the vicarage of Addingham, near Great Salkeld, on the presentation ofthe dean and chapter of Carlisle. During the political ferment excited by the French revolution, he published \" Rea sons for Contentment, addressed to the Labouring Classes,\" and the chapter in his \" Moral Philosophy\" on the British Constitution. In 1793, he vacated Dalston, on being collated by the bishop of Carlisle (Dr. Arernon) to the vicarage of Stanwix. In 1794, he published \"A View of the Evidences of Christianity, in three parts: I. Ofthe direct histo rical Evidence of Christianity, and wherein it is distinguished from the Evidence alleged for other Miracles. II. Of the auxiliary Evidences of Christianity ; and, III. A brief Consideration of some popular Objections.\" This work was first published in three volumes, 12mo. ; but, in a few months, it was republished in two volumes, 8vo. and has been continued in this form through many successive editions. It is, perhaps, the most complete summary of the evidences of our holy religion that has ever appeared. In August of the same year, the bishop of London, Dr. Porteus, instituted him to the prebend of St. Pancras, in the cathe dral of St. Paul's ; and, in a very short time, he was promoted to the subdeanery of Lincoln, a preferment"], [424, "288 EASINGTON AVARD.\u2014 N.

The Parsonage stands to the north of the church, surrounded by a walled court and a very ex tensive garden, and has much the appearance of an ancient seat-house that had been gradually en croached on by the neighbouring buildings. The old rectory was almost entirely ruined during the civil wars, and the present house was built by Mr. Grey after the Restoration, and by his suc cessor Dr. Smith, whose arms are on the south front.

The most ancient names which occur in it are Shippedson, Holme, Jarvice, Roxby, Pallicer, Skrowfield (Scurfield), Ayer, of \u00a3700 per annum, by Dr. Pretyman, bishop of that diocese. In January, 1795, he proceeded to Cam bridge to take his degree of D. D. ; and before he left that place, he was surprised by a letter from the bishop of Durham, Dr. Barrington, with whom he had not the smallest acquaintance, offering him the va luable rectory of Bishopwearmouth, estimated at \u00a31200 a year. AVhen he waited on his new patron to express his gratitude, his lordship instantly interrupted his acknowledgments: \"Not a word,\" said he; \" you cannot have greater pleasure in accepting the living of Bishopwearmouth, than I have in offering it to you.\" After reading himself in, as a prebendary, at St. Paul's cathedral, March 8, Dr. Paley, for he now assumed that title, immediately proceeded to Bishopwearmouth, took possession of his valuable cure, and then returned to Cambridge against the commencement, to complete the doctor's degree, and on Sunday, July 5, preached before the university his sermon \" On the Dangers incidental to the Clerical Character.\" He now resigned the prebend of Carlisle and the living of Stanwix, and divided his residence principally between Lincoln and Bishopwearmouth, spending his summers in the latter, and his winters at the former of those places. Soon after Dr. Paley 's arrival at Bishopwearmouth, he agreed to a proposal from some of the principal land-owners for an annual compensation for tithes, and granted them a lease for his life. As a writer, he had before reprobated tithes as \"noxious to cultivation and improvement,\" and recommended \" their conversion into corn-rents as a practicable and beneficial alteration, in which the interests of all par ties might be equitably adjusted.\" He next undertook the composition of his last work, entitled \"Natural Theology ; or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity, collected from the Appearances of Nature.\" In this he proceeded very slowly, and was much interrupted by ill health ; but the work was published in the summer of 1802. It was dedicated to the bishop of Durham, for the purpose of making the most acceptable return he was able for a great and important benefit conferred upon him. In this work lie has traced the marks of wisdom and design in various parts of the creation, but has dwelt principally on those which may be discovered in the constitution of the human body. It is replete with instruction, and from its style and manner peculiarly calculated to fix the reader's attention. His valuable life was now drawing fast towards a close ; and the powers of nature, gradually exhausted by repeated sufferings, were becoming daily less capable to resist the force of his inveterate disease. Yet he kept his usual residence at Lincoln in 1805, and returned to Bishopwearmouth about the beginning of May. Soon after his arrival, he experienced an attack, in which the usual remedies were found ineffectual. Human assistance was there fore vain : his appetite failing him, he was no longer able to take the requisite support, but soon sunk under the accumulated influence of debility and disease ; and late on the evening of Saturday, May 25, 1805, he tranquilly breathed his last. As a final proof of his pastoral interest and affection, Dr. Paley had provided, by a codicil to his will, for defraying the expense of printing at Sunderland a volume of Sermons, which he intended to be distributed gratis among his parishioners at -Bishopwearmouth. To these narrow precincts their circulation was at first restricted ; but, as it was sound difficult, if not impossible, to prevent a surreptitious edition of them, his family acquiesced in the general wish, and they have since been reprinted for public sale. Though intimately acquainted v.-ith many liberal divines, yet Dr. Paley was shy in advocating the principles of civil and reli gious liberty.

The ancient church of AVearmouth, now an irregular building, still exhibits traces of high anti quity. It is now undergoing a complete repair, and is being coated with lime and rougheast. In clearing away the stones and rubbish which disfigured the exterior, it is discovered that part of the chancel is built with clay instead of mortar; and two well-executed heads have been exposed at the east end of the chancel, and two old windows at the north side. On the south side, a por tion of old stained glass was discovered in an old, disused light, and which is perhaps part of what was manufactured under Benedict, the founder of the monastry. The tower is undoubtedly an cient, and is thought to have stood from the seventh century, being supported on four heavy and low arches, and having round-headed Saxon lights. The interior has been much modernized. Formerly, the fabric consisted of a nave and one aisle ; the south aisle having been destroyed at some remote period. The north aisle was separated from the nave by round pillars, supporting pointed arches : but now the aisle is thrown into the nave ; though one heavy, round semi-pillar, with an octagonal capital, remains attached to the yvall at the west end of the nave. A gallery now runs round three sides of the nave, supported on slight wooden pillars. The chancel was formerly divided from the nave by a heavy circular arch, much like the arches of Jarrow in form, but more lofty and extended. The lights, as well in the chancel as nave, are modern ; a mixture of square sashes and pointed arches. The old pointed arch of the east window, closed up in the wall, is still distinguishable, springing from corbeils of human heads. The chief entrance is through a small north porch, under a pointed arch. A mo dern vestry is attached to the north wall of the church. The total length of this church is 122 feet. The nave is 74 feet long, 4U feet broad, and 23 feet 7 inches in height. The chancel is 26 feet long. An ugly brick bone-house, covered with red tiles, was attached to the north side of the tower ; but this unseemly erection is now removed. The west end has been ornamented by two rich fillets, on which a goat and dogs are still very dis cernible. Below this stands the effigy of a Benedictine monk in his full habit, the hands clasped on the breast. This ancient figure was discovered in 1808 by some workmen employed in lower ing the footsteps near the north-west porch. It rested on a large flat stone, and had probably been removed from the church. It has. been attributed to an ancient abbot of St. Peter's, but may be much more safely assigned to one of the Masters of Wearmouth, after the cell became subordi nate to the monastry at Durham. The face of an altar-tomb projects from the south wall within die vestry. It is highly deco rated, and contained the arms of Hilton and A^ipond. In an adjoining porch, Hutchinson saw a mutilated effigy of a man in a coat of mail, with elevated hands, and a sword sheathed at his left side. This probably belonged to the monument of the Hilton family : it is now removed or destroyed. The entrance to a tomb was discovered under the west end of the church tower, and which would seem to have been constructed with singular taste. Two small circular pillars, belonging to this funeral monument, are now in the possession of Mr. Alexander Kirkaldy,* steward to Sir Hedworth AViUiamson, Bart. : they are formed of the finest magnesian limestone, are each about * This gentleman, who feels a deep interest in the history and preservation of this venerable edifice, has also that curious portion of ancient stained glass mentioned above."], [427, "SUNDERLAND, &c. 291 2 feet 9 inches in height, and have evidently been turned in a lathe.

After the first proscription of the Catholic religion, and again at the revolution in 1688, those who adhered to this faith were exposed to all the rigours of a severe penal code. The names of twenty-three gentlemen and yeomen, and nine women, have been preserved, who were denounced as Recusants in 1689 in Sunderland and the Wearmouths. In 1745, as before related, the Catho lic chapel was destroyed, when the minister left the town. After this, the congregation was occa sionally visited by missionaries from the neighbourhood, until 1760, when the Rev. John Bramber built a house and chapel at the top of A'ine Street. But the trustee of these premises becoming a bankrupt, the property was sold by his creditors. Soon after this, Mr. Bramber died, and was succeeded in 1785 by the Rev. Mr. Fletcher, who procured the erection of the present chapel. At his death in 1812, he was succeeded by the Rev. Peter Wilcock,* who, on removing to Liver pool, was succeeded by the Rev. Edward Crane. In 1830, Mr. Crane was removed to Ellingham, co. of Northumberland, and his place was occupied by the Rev. AValter Maddocks, who, on being appointed to the mission at Ashton in the AVillows, co. of Lancashire, was succeeded by the Rev. Philip Kearney, the present minister. Meeting House of Friends. The Quakers, or Friends, formed a society in Sunderland at an early period. About tlie middle of the seventeenth century, they possessed a building devoted to the purpose of public worship ; but, in 1688, it was demolished bv an ignorant rabble. -f- In 1718, it was restored ; and, about 60 years afterwards, it was re-edified, and the exterior rough-casted. The premises were sold to Mr. Thomas Robson, linen draper, in 1822, and the present handsome meeting-house in Nile Street erected at the cost of nearly \u00a33000, which sum was raised partly by tlie sale of the old premises, and partly by subscription.

George AVilson.* In the title-deeds, the congreo-a tion are styled Protestant Dissenters. At his death, about the year 1734, he was succeeded by Lemuel Latham, M. D., an Arian. The Rev. Mr. Richardson, AViUiam Lee, and William Young, were successively appointed to the pastoral charge. The latter, who accepted a living at Kelso in the Church of Scotland, was succeeded by the Rev.

This elegant chapel was erected, in the year 1825, in A'illiers Street. It is a substantial stone edifice, in the Doric order, and cost \u00a34100. The congregation, who are probably in part the descendants of those Scotch Presbyterians who settled in Sunderland two centuries ago, seceded, in consequence of certain innovations being introduced, from the Corn Market Chapel, and met in a large room or barn at the head of Pewterer's Lane. Under tlie ministry of Mr. Lazenby, their first pastor, the congregation, in two years, ventured to build a meeting-house and a residence for their minister in Robinson's Lane. About the year 1736, Mr. Brown succeeded Mr. Lazenby, who found it necessary to vacate his office. Mr. Brown, who died in 1765, was succeeded, in I767, by the Rev. John Somerville, whose ministry was so successful that it was found necessary to enlarge the meeting-house. This popular preacher died in March, 1801, and was succeeded by the Rev. James Richardson, who, three years afterwards, returned to Scotland. His successor, the Rev. William Gardiner, was minister of this church twelve years, and, after his death in 1816, was succeeded by the Rev. Mark Aitkin. The Rev. J. T. Paterson is the present minister. This congregation belongs to the presbytery of Newcastle, which again is subordinate to the \" Synod of the Presbyterian Church in England in Communion with the Church of Scotland.\" * Some idea of the rancour entertained by the Whig and Tory parties at that time may be gained from the following fact : \u2014 On the intelligence of a victory gained over the French by the Duke of Marlborough, an illumination took place, and a hogshead of ale was procured by the Tories, and brought opposite Mr. AVilson's house (now the Exchange Tavern) to regale the populace. Mr. Wilson, above referred to, was sent for, and it was insisted that he should drink the queen's health on his knees ; to which he answered, that he \" never kneeled but to his God.\" On this refusal, his windows were immediately broken. Not satisfied with this outrage, they shortly afterwards undermined the chapel on the north side, and caused it on the following Sunday to give way, which being perceived by the congregation, they lost no time in rushing out. An action at law was the consequence of this proceeding, in which stir. AVilson was successful, and gained con siderable damages. t Author of \"A Mite for the Treasury,\" 2d edition; \u2014 \" Arminianism in the Oven, Two Sermons;\" \u2014 \" A Place of Safety in Troublesome Times, a Fast-day Sermon ;\" \u2014 \" The burdened Saint released, a Fune ral Discourse;\" \u2014 \" The King in his Beauty and the Saint in his Presence, a Funeral Sermon;\" \u2014 \"Life in Christ for every willing Soul, Three Sermons ;\" \u2014 and editor of \" A CoUection of Hymns, from the most evangelical Authors,\" 3d edition."], [431, "SUNDERLAND, &c. 295 Maling's Rigg Chapel. A few persons of the Independent denomination, about the year 1777-> hired a room in Ropery Lane, where Mr. Knipe of Newcastle occasionally preached. Becoming gradually more nume rous, they engaged Mr. Heslop (brother-in-law of the late Rev. William Romaine) to be their pastor. Shortly after, this chapel was built, and would then contain 260 people. In 1791, Mr. Heslop removed to Horsley in Northumberland, and was succeeded by the Rev. John Bailey, a clever but imprudent man, who found it necessary to resign in 1796. He was succeeded by the Rev. Newton Blyth, from Glasgow ; when the chapel was enlarged, and a front gallery erected. In 1809, Mr. Blyth removed to Branton in Northumberland, and was succeeded by the Rev. John Drysdale, who, in 1817, was admitted a member of the Newcastle presbytery ; but, in 1825, he was induced to resign. The Rev.

This is a light and elegant stone structure, pleasantly situated near the north end of the Bridge, and was erected in 1826-7 by the congregation which formerly met in Park Chapel, Monkwear mouth. Park Chapel was built in 177*8- The congregation, which was organized in the preceding year, had met in a stable, and appointed the Rev. James Hope to be their pastor. Mr Hope died in 1784, and was succeeded by the Rev. John Henderson, who, in 1797, went to Holland. His successor, the Rev. AViUiam Stoddart, having fallen into disgrace, resigned in 1802, and was suc ceeded by the Rev. Alexander Macfarline. He enlarged the chapel by a commodious gallery, so that it would contain about 800 persons; and he also changed its name from the Ropery Lane Chapel to Park Chapel. In 1813, Mr. Macfarline resigned.

Here Mr. AVesley preached, on May 10, 1752, to what he calls \"one ofthe liveliest societies in the north of England.\" About the year 1758, the society built a chapel in Number's Garth ; but, in 1790, they found it necessary to erect a larger chapel at the foot of Sans Street, and just at the entrance of the parish of Sunderland, and which was opened by the Rev. Dr. Coke in 1791- It was considerably enlarged in 1809, and again in 1824, and will now accommodate above 2500 persons.

Sans Street Chapel was opened on December 25, 1798, by the Particular, or Calvinist, Baptists. The Rev. A. Wilson is the pastor. It is believed that there have been members of the Baptist persuasion in Sunderland from the days of the Commonwealth. Formerly, they had a burial-place in Bishopwearmouth. Enon Chapel stands on the Ballast Hill, Monkwearmouth. It will hold upwards of 200 people, and was erected in 1808, at the cost of \u00a3500. Mr. Isaac Watts, the first minister, resigned in 1817- Mr. J. Garrow is the present pastor. Unitarian Chapel, Bridge Street. This is a small, handsome chapel, just finished at the cost of \u00a31000, and is capable of accom modating 600 persons. The builder, Mr. Thomas Moor, has provided for heating and ventilating the interior in a very ingenious and scientific manner. From 1814 until this chapel was finished, the Unitarians assembled for divine worship in the old Free Mason's Lodge in Maling's Rigg- Jeivs' Synagogue. The Jews assemble for public worship in a house at the bottom of ATine Street, formerly the property and residence of the celebrated Lieutenant-colonel John Lilburn. Difficult of access, and plain in the interior, it forms a striking contrast to the grandeur and magnificence which once distinguished the national Temple of the Jews. This people have a small burying- ground near Hetton Staiths, to the west of Bishopwearmouth. Charities in Sunderland Parish. Walton's Charity. \u2014 This charity was founded in 1768, by Edward AValton, a member ofthe Society of Friends, who, amongst other things, directed that the interest of one-fourth of the money bequeathed by him for cha ritable uses should be paid to a schoolmaster or schoolmistress at Sunderland, under the directions of the monthly meeting at Newcastle, according to certain rules which he prescribed for this and three other schools which he founded in Bishop-Auckland, Sheldon, and Shotton. Some time appears to havre elapsed after the death of the testator before any school was established at or near Sunderland ; but with the income, which in the interval accumulated, a school-house was afterwards built in Bishopwearmouth (a great part of what is usually caUed Sunderland being in that parish), and the fee of the ground on which it was built has subse- usually called Captain George, of the Sunderland custom-house, sent him to school: at the age of 18, he joined the Methodists, and, a year afterwards, preached his first sermon in the Market Place at South Shields. Being chosen a travelling preacher, he married, in 1793, Miss Mary Scales, of Barnsley in Yorkshire. He afterwards received a liberal offer from the late Mr. Johnson, of Byker, to officiate in his chapel at Byker, which he accepted. At this place stir. Grundell opened a school, and often preached charity-sermons in the neighbourhood; but, in 1797, he, with great disinterestedness, resigned this comfortable situation, and offered his services to the New Connexion. After this, he preached at Nottingham, Hanley, Manchester, Liverpool, Halifax, Stockport, Alnwick, and Shields, where he di*jd, December 1, 1815, in the 55th year of his age. Though blind, he was remarkably lively and vivacious and, in his youth, excelled in feats of agi lity. His voice was commanding ; and, in preaching, he was correct, earneat, and impressive. \u2014 History oj Newcastle, p. 405. vol. i. 4 G"], [434, "298 EASINGTON WARD.\u2014 N. D. quently been purchased. For several years a school was carried on in this house ; but lately it has been thought more advisable to send a certain number of children to a master keeping a school on his own account in Bishopwearmouth, under the impression that the acting trustees are thus enabled to select the best mas ter that the neighbourhood affords. In pursuance of this scheme, the upper part of the old school-house is now let for \u00a36, 6s. a year, the lower part being reserved for an infant school, and this rent is added to the yearly sum of \u00a330, being one-fourth of the annual dividends of the stock belonging to this charity. Out of the income \u00a320 is paid to a schoolmaster in Bishopwearmouth, who for this sum instructs 16 children of Sunderland and Bishopwearmouth, appointed bv a committee from the monthly meeting of Newcastle. In the selection of children, preference is given to those whose parents or connexions are or have been members of the Society of Friends, and in the next place orphans, or the children of widows, and those who from bodily infirmity are not likely to be able to get a livelihood by manual labour, are preferred ; the children are generally appointed when about 10 or 12 years osage- Out of the income \u00a34 per annum is laid out in supplying books for the scholars, and the residue has been of late years reserved for binding out apprentices. Two apprentices only have at present received the benefit of this charity. One of them is bound to a shop keeper for a term of five or seven years ; and the trustees have agreed to pay to the master \u00a36 yearly, during his term, for maintaining and lodging the apprentice, and instructing him in his business. On the binding of the other apprentice, 40s. was paid to his parents to provide him with clothes. A committee, appointed by the monthly meeting at Newcastle, visit the school regularly, and supply the vacancies of children. The accounts are kept by Thomas Richardson, one of the Society of Friends. In September, 1829, he had a balance in hand of \u00a337, 3s. lOd. Donnison's Charity. \u2014 Elizabeth Donnison, by will dated Sept. 5, 1764, appointed trustees, who were directed, after the death of her husband, to apply the interest of \u00a31500 in the first place in defraying the charges of the trust, and in the next place towards hiring a house or room in the parish of Sunderland, con venient for a charity-school, and towards employing a person to teach the children thereinafter mentioned, with a salary not exceeding \u00a310, and that the overplus should be employed in clothing a competent number of poor girls born in the parish of Sunderland, to be taught the English tongue, and spinning, sewing, and knitting, in the said school, gratis ; and that the said girls and teachers should be appointed by the trustees, or the major part of them ; that the girls should not be nominated under seven years of age, nor remain after sixteen ; and that the trustees for the time being, or the major part of them, should have power to make such orders and regulations for managing the said charity as they should think fit. It appears that trustees have been from time to time nominated to act with the rectors of Bishopwearmouth and Sunderland, and the owner of the estate of High Ford for the time being : George Robinson is now the only survivor of the five last elected trustees, and the present owner ofthe High Ford estate is a minor. The Commissioners for inquiring concerning Charities report, \" The information we received at Sunder land with respect to the funds of this charity was, that they consisted merely of a sum of \u00a32614, 7s- 7d. three per cent, consols, standing in the names of the Rev. Robert Gray, rector of Sunderland, and George Robinson, with John Goodchild and Timothy Parker, both deceased, the amount of the stock having been increased from time to time by investments of the surplus income. It appeared, however, to us that the sum above mentioned did not include the whole of the stock which had been so purchased ; and Mr. Gray having undertaken to make further inquiries on the subject, he has discovered that there was purchased, in addition to what he had been before apprised of, \u00a31056, 4s. 10d- like stock, viz. in October, 1791, \u00a3192, 15s. Id.; in September, 1796, \u00a3711, 2s, 2d. ; and in October, 1800, \u00a3152, 7s. 7d. This sum of \u00a31056, 4s. lOd. stands in the names of the Rev. AVilliam Paley, the Rev. George Scurfield, and the Rev. John Hampson. These persons are all dead, the last-named having been the survivor. We are assured that steps will immediately be taken to obtain a transfer of this stock from the personal representative of Mr. Hampson into the names of new trustees. \" The dividends on the sum of \u00a32614, 7s- 7d-, amounting to \u00a378, 8s. 6d. per annum, are received by- Messrs. Backhouse, bankers, in Sunderland, by virtue of a power of attorney given to them. The trustees draw upon the bank for such money as from time to time may be required, and interest is allowed by the bankers on the balance in their hands. A small addition to the income accrues from the work of the girls in the school, which is now accounted for to the trustees, though till lately it was allowed to the schoolmis tress in addition to her yearly salary. Till 1828, the trustees rented a school and residence for the mistress at a rent of \u00a310 a year ; but a house has been lately built on a part of the town-moor, with the consent of the parishioners, for the residence of the schoolmistress, and an old school nearly adjoining thereto, which was built upon part of the church-yard about 30 years ago by the parishioners, has been enlarged and improved for the benefit of this charity. The expense of these buildings and improvements amounted to \u00a3566, of which \u00a3400 was given for the purpose by one individual, and the residue was raised by subscription. A rent of \u00a36 a year is to be paid to the rector for the school-room. The schoolmistress receives a salary of"], [435, "SUNDERLAND, kc. 299 ct.24, to which sum it has been lately raised from \u00a320, and a gratuity of \u00a32, 2s. a year. She instructs 36 poor girls of the parish, appointed by the rector, with the concurrence of the other trustees. These children are taught reading and writing, the four first rules of arithmetic, and needle-work ; they are also instructed in the principles of the Christian religion, and are required to attend church every Sunday, Wednesday, and Friday. On their admission into the school, each girl receives a complete set of clothing ; and thev are all provided with some articles of clothing every Christmas and Midsummer. During the time they remain in the school, they are supplied with spelling-books and other school requisites ; and, on leaving it, they each receive a Bible. The average expenses of the clothing for the girls in the last three years was about \u00a348 : this payment, with the salary of the schoolmistress, the rent payable to the rector, and a few other small expenses, are sufficient to exhaust the income. The accounts are kept by the rector, to whom the manage ment of the charity is chiefly left ; they are audited annually ; at the end of the year 1828, there was a ba lance in the rector's hand of 12s. 7d-\" Williamson s Charity. \u2014 The sum of \u00a32 annually is paid by the agents of Sir Hedworth AViUiamson, which, instead of being always distributed to the poor, is sometimes applied improperly in aid of the poor's rate. (See Monkwearmouth.) Pottery Lease. \u2014 There is a large plot of ground on the east of Sunderland, which, on May 13, 1820, was granted by four freemen on a 21 years' lease, for a pottery, at the yearly rent of \u00a310, which was destined for the use of the poor ; but the Commissioners say, \" No part thereof lias ever been applied for the use or benefit of the poor. We are given to understand that the moor, of which the demised premises were a part, is the property of the corporate body, called the Freemen and Stallingers of Sunderland ; that about the year 1820, some disputes had arisen as to the right to the moor ; and that, pending these disputes, the lease above mentioned was granted by the four persons therein named. It appears to us, that without entering into any inquiry as to the title of the freemen to the demised premises (for there seems to be no evidence to support the idea that the moor was ever given for the benefit of the poor), or into the power of the parties named in the lease to grant the same, the rent hitherto received under it ought to have been distributed to the poor, to whose use it was reserved ; and that in future, during the existence of this lease, the yearly rent ought to be distributed in like manner. It has been suggested to us that another lease was granted of part of the moor, reserving a rent of \u00a35 to the poor in a similar manner, about the same period; but we have not been able to obtain any distinct evidence of this fact.\" Alms-houses. \u2014 There are two alms-houses, containing eight apartments, in Church Street, Sunderland, which have long been in the possession of a corporate body, called the Freemen and Stallingers of Sunder- land, who from time to time, as vacancies occur, appoint widows of poor persons of Sunderland to succeed. The alms-people have no other allowance but what they receive from the parish rates. Tlie buildings are very old, and are kept in repair by the freemen out of the rents of the moor, and other property held by them. National Schools. \u2014 In April, 1822, the Methodist chapel in A'ine Street was sold for \u00a3950 to the trustees for founding and establishing a school for the education and religious instruction of the children of the poor ; and, in 1827, an adjoining parcel of ground was purchased for \u00a3285, as a scite for the residence ofthe mas ter and mistress of the school. On September 3, 1823, Elizabeth AVoodcock, widow, transferred, in the name of the trustees of these schools, \u00a310()0 new four per cent, stock, as a permanent endowment for their support. \"The meeting-house standing on the premises, purchased in 1822, has been much enlarged, and a floor added thereto, and it is now used for the national schools ; and dwelling-houses have been built for the schoolmaster and schoolmistress upon the premises purchased in 1827- These expenses have been defrayed by subscription. The stock given by Elizabeth AVoodcock still stands in the names in which it was origi nally invested. The dividends, amounting to \u00a340 per annum, are received by the rector of Sunderland, to whom also \u00a320 a year is paid by the trustees of Lord Crewe's charity, and an annual subscription to the amount of \u00a34, 4s. These receipts fall far short of the expenses incurred in supporting the national schools : about \u00a3100 a year is paid to the schoolmaster and schoolmistress as their salaries, and the annual disburse ments amount altogether upon an average to about \u00a3160 a year; the difference is paid by the Rev. Robert Gray, the rector, who has undertaken the management of the schools. All the children of Sunderland and the neighbouring parishes are admitted to the school on the payment of ld. per week, and instructed on the national system.\" Above 400 boys and 50 girls usually attend this school. Charities in Bishopwearmouth Parish. Scurfield's Charity, \u2014 On March 8, 1819, Dorothy Scurfield, amongst other charities, bequeathed the sum of \u00a3], Is. to be paid yearly to the schoolmistress ofthe national school in this parish."], [436, "300 EASINGTON AVARD\u2014 N. D. Gray's Charity. \u2014 The Rev. Robert Gray, D. D. (now bishop of Bristol) in 1825 gave \u00a330, the interest to be paid yearly towards the salary of the master of the national school erected in Bishopwearmouth in 1808. This money is lodged in the Bishopwearmouth savings bank, and the interest is applied towards the payment of the salary of the master of the national school above mentioned. Gibson's Alms-houses- \u2014 Jane Gibson, by will, dated July 14, 1725, gave to Isabel Reed, of Bishopwear mouth, widow, \u00a31400, to purchase ground, and to build thereon 12 rooms in the parish of Bishopwearmouth, or Sunderland, and that the Sum remaining after building the rooms was to be put out at interest, to be paid yearly to 12 poor persons chosen by the said Isabel Reed, her heirs and assigns, preferring the relations of the said Jane Gibson. It is further stated that the said Isabel Reed married Ralph Robinson, of Middle Herrington, Esq., and with her husband fulfilled and enlarged the intention of the foundress, built the hos pital on her own ground, and laid out \u00a31000 in the purchase of copyhold lands ; and that the appointment became vested, under the will of the foundress, and by a subsequent decree, in the family of Mowbray, the descendants and representatives of Isabel Reed. At a court held for the manor of Houghton, 22d Septem ber, 1817, Robert Hopper AATilliamson, the great nephew and heir-at-law of Hendry Hopper, who survived his co-trustee John AVoodifield, surrendered to the use of WUliam Hutchinson (since deceased) and Thomas Wilkinson and Thomas Hopper, Esqrs., and their sequels in right, a parcel of land, on the east end of the church of Wearmouth, called the HaUgarth, containing in length and breadth as therein mentioned (being about 22 yards by 29), with the edifices thereupon built ; a close, called the Town and Close, containing by estimation 4 a. 1 r. 19 p. ; another close then divided into two, called East and West Briary Bank, contain ing together nine acres; and another close, formerly called the Briary Balks, with the buildings thereon, then divided into three closes, called the Garth, the House Field, and the Long Close, and containing 14 acres: all which premises, it is stated, were by surrender, bearing date 15th November, 1731, surrendered by Ralph Robinson, Esq., and Isabel his wife (then lately called Isabel Reed, widow), to the said Hendry Hopper and John AVoodifield; and by a memorandum annexed to the surrender of 1817, the trusts thereof are declared as follows ; viz. upon trust, out of the rents and profits of the said premises to keep in repair the hospital theretofore built in Bishopwearmouth for 12 poor people, pursuant to the will of Jane Gibson, and lo dispose of the residue thereof for the maintenance of 12 poor people in the said hospital. The alms-house is situate on the east side of the church-yard, and forms three sides of a square, open to the west. It comprises 12 apartments, six above and six below. The copyhold premises described in the surrender above noticed consist of a farm-house and out-buildings, and 21 acres of land, let to AVilliam Tay lor, as a yearly tenant, at a fair yearly rent of \u00a3108; and four and a half acres let to Messrs. Grey and Ellerly, as yearly tenants, at a fair yearly rent of \u00a324. The rents, amounting to \u00a3132 per annum, are re ceived by Thomas Hopper, Esq., of Silksworth, and divided half-yearly between the 12 inmates of the alms house equally. The alms-people are appointed by Dr. Gray, bishop of Bristol, as the executor of George Mowbray, in whose family, as tbe representatives of Isabel Reed, it appears from the table of benefactions the right became vested. AVhen an inmate dies, no salary is paid to her successor for tlie first half year, and this portion of the rents is carried to a separate account for repairs. It appears by the accounts that stir. Hopper was, in October, 1829. \u00a327, 6s. 2d. in advance on this account, a large sum having lately been expended in tlie repairs ofthe form -buildings, which were in a very bad state. Bowes's Alms-house, and Ogle's Charily. \u2014 There is on Bishopwearmouth Green an alms-house, contain ing apartments for 12 women, which, as it appears from an inscription on the building, was founded by the Rev- John Bowes, rector of Bishopwearmouth, in 1725. This alms-house is occupied by 12 poor women, placed there by the rector. The only endowment arises from the will of Dr. Thomas Ogle, dated in 1725, who, as it appears from a table of benefactions in the church, charged his estate in Stainton with the yearly payment of \u00a35 to the poor of these alms-houses, redeemable on payment of \u00a3100. This sum was afterwards paid to the dean and chapter of Durham, and from them \u00a35 is received annually by the rector, who gives 5s. at Christmas to each of the alms-women, and the remaining \u00a32 is applied in occasional repairs. An account is kept by him of the application of this fund; and, at the time of the Commissioners' inquiry, he had 7s- or 8s. in hand, and \u00a310 in the savings bank. Maritime Institution. \u2014 By indenture, bearing date 29th August, 1320, enrolled in the High Court of Chancery, for the foundation and endowment of certain alms-houses in Bishopwearmouth, now known by the name of the Maritime Institution, Elizabeth Woodcock, the founder, declared that she herself, for life, and after her decease the bishop of Durham for the time being, should be the visitor of the charity thereby established. These -ilms-houses are pleasantly situated in Crow-tree Lane, and are for the reception of 10 widows or unmarried daughters of master mariners, above 55 years osage.

But we are given to understand that care will be taken in future that they are distributed in charity to the poor.\" Other Public Institutions. The Muster Roll. The Assembly Room and adjacent buildings were purchased, in the year 1750, for \u00a3148; in pursuance of an act of parliament, passed in tlie 20th year of the reign of George II. , entitled, \" An Act for the Relief and Support of maimed and disabled Seamen, and the AVidows and Chil dren of such as shall be killed, slain, or drowned, in the Merchants' Service.\"* In the buildings adjacent to the Assembly Room, there are thirty-eight rooms, appointed for the reception of su perannuated sailors, or their widows. A sailor receives two shillings per month, a widow two shillings per month, and one shilling for each child under fourteen years of age. Persons possessed of a house are not entitled to relief. Under the act before mentioned, all ships in the merchant service, registered at Sunderland, pay sixpence per month to the funds of this institution, for every sailor on board, whilst employed. The act directs a proportionate deduction from the seamen's wages; but, at the port of Sunderland, the owners pay it themselves. The institution is governed by fifteen trustees, elected annually, who hold their meetings in the Assembly Room. By the re port for 1830, there are relieved by this establishment 369 widows at two shillings per month, 143 infirm old seamen at two shillings per month, and 310 orphans and children at one shilling per month ; making a total of 822 individuals relieved, at the annual expense of \u00a3800, 8s. The payments are made monthly at the office of the secretary, Mr. George Wood, A7ilUers Street. * In 1792, an act was obtained for establishing a permanent fund for the relief and support of skippers and keelmen employed on the AVear, and also for the relief of their widows and children. The keelmen, however, refused to comply with the terms of this act, or to pay one farthing towards the fund; and the expenses of the act were only discharged, many years afterwards, under a mandamus from the Court of King's Bench. vol. 1. 4 H"], [438, "302 EASINGTON WARD\u2014 N. D. Humane Society, Dispensary, and Infirmary. In July, 1791, a gentleman, whilst bathing, was attacked with apoplexy; and though immedi ately taken out of the water, there appeared a total want of the means of resuscitation. Affected by this melancholy occurrence, stir. Bernard Ogden wrote to Dr. Lettsom, requesting a complete apparatus from the Royal Humane Society of London. When this arrived, a meeting of the gentlemen of the faculty was convened, Dr. Scott in the chair, when the Sunderland Humane So ciety was instituted. Receiving houses were then appointed in suitable places adjoining the river, each furnished with a complete set of apparatus; drags were placed in many parts, and every ap pointment of the society completed. At the general meeting of the Humane Society, in January, 1794, an extraordinary committee was formed, expressly to take into consideration the means likely to lead to the establishment of a Dispensary. From this committee an address issued to the coal-owners, ship-owners, and others ; a considerable subscription was obtained, and the Dispensary established in May, 1794 ; when Dr. Scott and Dr. Brown were appointed Physicians ; Messrs. Gregson, Ferguson, Eden, and AA^atson, Surgeons ; and Mr. J. T. Robinson, House-apothecary : and at a general meeting of the subscribers to the Humane Society, held June 4, 1794, that institution was incorporated with the Dispensary, and its funds transferred accordingly. Still a more extended and efficient medical establishment was found necessary, in consequence of which the members of the above institutions convened a meeting of the inhabitants of Bishopwear mouth, Sunderland, and their vicinities, which was held on November 16, 1818, at the Exchange, the Rev. Dr. Gray in the chair, to consider the expediency of establishing an Infirmary. Some delay took place before all the difficulties to this great undertaking were removed ; but on January 10, 1822, the foundation-stone of the Infirmary was laid by the Right Honourable Lord Stewart, now Marquis of Londonderry. The building, which cost \u00a33000, occupies an airy situation at the west end of Bishopwearmouth. This useful institution is supported by donations and annual sub scriptions. It is under the patronage of the Lord Bishop of Durham, and of eight presidents, including the principal noblemen of tlie county. The eight vice-presidents and three acting trus tees consist of the principal resident gentry. Four physicians and four surgeons compose the medical department, with a house apothecary and surgeon. The Lying-in Charity. The object of this institution is to relieve, in the time of child-bearing, poor and industrious married women, in the three parishes composing this sea-port. Arisitors are appointed, who, be sides granting the ordinary assistance, give linen, bread, soap, &c. as may be thought most proper. About 150 women are annually relieved by this charity, at an expense of \u00a3100. During the year ending November 14, 1831, there were 156 women relieved, at a cost, including matrons' salaries, of \u00a3109, 14s. 6d. It is under the patronage of the Marchioness of Londonderry. The annual subscriptions at present amount only to \u00a363, 10s. Sunderland and Bishopwearmouth Indigent Sick Society. This society was instituted in 1827, and is supported by subscriptions and donations. During the first three years of this establishment, 689 persons were relieved, and 4460 visits were made. The sum expended was \u00a3414, 18s. 4-|d. It continues to be well supported. A primary object"], [439, "SUNDERLAND, &c. 303 of this society is to afford relief to hard-working men, disabled by sickness from following their employment. The committee meet every fortnight in the office of the Water AVorks, Sunderland Street. The Benevolent Society AVas established in 1792, for the relief of persons in poverty and distress. Tlie parishes of Sun derland and Bishopwearmouth are divided into districts, and visitors are appointed to each. This institution is supported by donations, subscriptions, and public collections. The average annual sum expended by this society is \u00a3160. The subscribers are mostly AVesleyan Methodists. The Society for preventing Accidents in Coal-mines. It was estimated that six hundred men and boys were destroyed in the coal- pits on the Tyne and AVear, by the explosions of inflammable air, in the years 1812 and 1813. About the end of tlie latter year, this society was established in Sunderland, to be supported by voluntary contribu- tions. AAlUiam Reid Clanny, M. D., of Bishopwearmouth, presented the society with an ingenious lamp, constructed on the principle of insulating the light by water, for which he was honoured by an unanimous vote of thanks. In November, 1815, Dr. Clanny invented his steam safety-lamp, for which again he received the unanimous thanks of the society, and, in 1817, the gold medal awarded by the Society of Arts. In August, 1815, Sir Humphrey Davy, being on a visit to Dr. Gray, at the Rectory, Bishopwearmouth, was shewn the original lamp invented by Dr. Clanny, on which he passed high encomiums ; and, after some experiments on carburetted hydrogen gas, the happy idea of using wire gauze occurred to him. About the same time, Mr. Stephenson also adopted small apertures instead of water. This society, so useful and benevolent in its objects, has not been supported as it deserved, and has therefore dwindled into a state of inefficiency. Poor Houses and Rates. Sunderland Poor House was erected by public subscription in 1740 : the right wing was added in 1779, and a building adapted as a place of labour at a subsequent period. The house contains about 200 persons, who are provided for by contract. Sunderland was made a distinct parish in 1719; and on August 18, 1722, the following minute was made in the vestry -book : \u2014 \"We, the reef- and vestry, assembled in the vestrj'-roome, doe hereby rate, tax, and assess, by an equal assessment, the several tenants, occupiers, and farmers of houses, kays, lands, tenements, and estates of the parish, and for their several and respective stocks in trade and personal estates, the sum of one shilling and sixpence upon each pound yearly rent, and the like sum upon each twenty pounds stock in trade and personal estate.\" Under an act of 31 Geo III. (1791), \"every ship or decked vessel laden with coals, belonging to, and registered at, the port of Sunderland, and cleared out from the said port,\" is liable to a duty of one halfpenny per ton. Every ship which shall be again freighted, or take in any other caro-o there or at any other port, two-pence per ton per annum, and so in proportion for any o-reater or lesser time, over and above the said halfpenny.

The assessment for Sunderland to the county-rate, forthe year ending January 1, 1831, was \u00a3110, 16s. 3d.; and the amount of poor-rate, in 1829, was \u00a34559. In the year ending 29th April, 1809, the whole parochial expenditure was \u00a3\"6900, 15s. ; and in the year 1813-14, the expenditure was \u00a39380, 15s. 6d. The rate collected was from 6s. to 6s. 6d. per pound supposed rack rent and stock in trade. These rates are so oppressive on account of the small extent of the parish and its comparatively great population. The Bishopwearmouth Poor House was erected in 1827, and is an excellent and commodious building. It stands at the west end of the town, in an airy and healthy situation. The assess ment on the value of real property in Bishopwearmouth, for the year ending January 1, 1831, was \u00a3375, Ils. 3d., and for the Panns \u00a312, Ils. 3d. The poor-rates, in 1829, amounted to ,\u00a32732. The townships of Monkwearmouth and Monktvearmouth Shore support their poor separately. The county-rate of the former place, for the year ending January 1, 1831, amounted to \u00a331, 3s., and of the latter place to \u00a359, 0s. 3d. The poor-rate of Monkwearmouth, in 1829, was \u00a3359, and of the Shore \u00a311 S5. The Monkwearmouth, Sunderland, and Bishopwearmouth Savings Bank, In AVhitburn Street, Monkwearmouth Shore, was established 10th of July, 1824, and has been very judiciously managed.* The funds, on January 14, 1831, amounted to \u00a37000; and on the 20th of November preceding, there were 265 depositors and 12 societies, whose accounts amounted to \u00a36706, 7s. 7d. Schools. In the preceding account of parochial charities, an account has been given of Walton's School, near Nicholson's Square. One part of the building is used for a School of Industry for Girls, and the other part as an Infant School. Donnison's Girls' Free School, and Sunder/and Parochial School, ATine Street, have been described. At the National School, Low Row, Bishopwearmouth, conducted on Dr. Bell's system, about 150 boys and 100 girls are educated. Monkwearmouth Subscription School, established in 1812, is supported by voluntary contributions, and affords the means of education to about 100 boys. The School of Industry. \u2014 This building is situated in Sans Street, and was erected by subscrip tion in 1809, in commemoration of King George III. having attained the 50th year of his reign. Seventy or eighty poor girls usually attend this school. They are taught reading, writing, and needle-work. In 1830, a commodious school-house was built and endowed for the education of Catholic chil dren. It is built near the Catholic chapel, Bishopwearmouth. The name of the benevolent donor is concealed. Sunday Schools were first established in this town, and ardently supported, by the late Mr. Michael Longridge. The AVesleyan Methodists are zealous patrons of these institutions, which are also supported by the members of different churches and chapels. Above 3000 children attend * About ten years ago, an attempt was made to establish a savings bank in Sunderland parish ; but the scheme, after a short trial, was abandoned."], [441, "SUNDERLAND, &c. 305 the Sunday schools of the three parishes constituting this town. At the last meeting of the Sun derland Sabbath School Union, held on September 13, 1831, the total number of Sabbath schools in the united kingdom was stated to be upwards of 10,000, with 100,000 teachers and 1,000,000 of scholars. The means of instruction in this place are ample. Here are four boarding schools for young gentlemen, and five for young ladies ; also upwards of twenty day-schools, exclusive of teachers of music, dancing, and drawing. Religious Societies. Religious Tract Society. \u2014 This society was formed in the year 1809- A subscription of five shillings per annum constitutes a member, who receives from the depository tracts to the amount of his subscription. The Sunderland, Bishopwearmouth, and Monkwearmouth Auxiliary Bible Society, in connexion with the British and Foreign Bible Society, was formed in June, 1806. Lately, another association was formed, principally by the Presbyterians, called the Sunderland Auxiliary Society, in connexion with the Edinburgh Bible Society. The Sunderland Auxiliary to the London Missionary Society held their last annual meeting on October 16, 1831, in Bethel Chapel, when it appeared that \u00a3104 had been collected, \u00a320 of which was the produce of the sale of ladies' work towards female education in India. Friendly Societies. Among the benefit-societies the Philanthropic stands pre-eminent. It was instituted on the 7th April, 1792, and contains upwards of 100 members. The objects of this institution are, a stipend to the sick, education to the orphan, and a comfortable annuity to the widow and superannuated. It is managed by a secretary, five trustees, and six visitors. One of its resolutions provides that the expenditure shall never exceed the income, which eventually must preserve its capital, amount ing to \u00a33530, vested in the new four per cent, annuities. This institution has been, in many in stances, highly beneficial to the widows of deceased members; but, at present, it requires the fostering patronage of the opulent to carry its benevolent purposes into full effect. The Seamen's Loyal Standard Association was formed in 1824, and comprises many hundred members, who have associated for mutual relief in case of shipwreck, sickness, or superannuation, &c. There are many other benefit-societies of inferior importance. Sunderland Subscription Library. On Saturday, January 31, 1795, a meeting was held at the house of Mr. Stanfield,* when the establishment of a Public Library was agreed upon. The institution slowly, but gradually, in creased ; and, in 1800, the subscribers projected the plan of the present building. The foundation- * James Field Stanfield was an ingenious man and an able comedian. He kept an inn for some time in Sunderland, and was much respected for his superior talents and pleasing manners. He wrote and sung Irish songs admirably, and was the author of a poem called \" The Guinea Voyage ;\" but his \" Essay on Biography\" is the production on which his fame chiefly depends. He had also cultivated the fine arts with considerable success, and, during many years, was scene-painter in the Sunderland theatre, in which occu pation he was assisted by his son, the present highly and justly celebrated landscape painter. After this, young Stanfield was apprenticed for sea, and sailed out of Hartley. But his taste for painting ultimately overcame every obstacle, and he obtained an engagement as an assistant scene-painter in Drury Lane theatre, from which place he issued forth and assumed his present high rank as an artist.

D. stone was laid on the 6th of May, 1801, \" in the name of Almighty God, the fountain of intelligence, and the source of mind.\" The principal room is about 31 feet in length, 20 in breadth, and 15 in height. On the same floor are two smaller apartments, for the accommodation of meetings of the members, committee, &c. The expense thus incurred was to be defrayed by shares of \u00a310 each, entitling the holder to a dividend of the net proceeds of the rents of the library and two shops'; and the management was vested in seven trustees. But although some of the principal promoters took several shares, only \u00a3730 was raised by this method, whilst the original cost of the building amounted to \u00a31280. The difference was borrowed, but repaid before May, 1814, since which time the subscribers have received interest on their shares. At the anniversary meeting on the first Tuesday of February, 1831, the number of annual subscribers of one guinea each was 205, and there were nearly 4000 volumes in the library. The books are generally select, consisting of every department of literature, as Natural and Experimental Philosophy, Chemistry, Mineralogy, Geology, Botany, Optics, Astronomy, &c. Attached to the library is a museum, consisting of various specimens of the animal, vegetable, and mineral kingdoms. Amongst the earliest and most zealous promoters of this institution we find Tipping Brown, M. D., Bernard Ogden, G. AV. Meadley,* Rev. John Farrer, Rev. George Stephenson, Michael Longridge, J. F. Stanfield, * George AVilson Meadley was born at Sunderland, on the 1st of January, 1774. His principal education was received at AA'itton-le-AVear, under the care of the Rev. John Farrer. In the latter part of the year 1788, he left AVitton ; and, being intended for commercial pursuits, he was fixed in the city of Durham, as an apprentice to stir, (afterwards Alderman) Chipchase, who united the businesses of grocer, draper, and banker. During his apprenticeship, he was occasionally employed in each department, and much disliked them all ; employing his leisure hours in reading, and in various compositions, chiefly in rhyme. During his residence at Durham, the debates on the Abolition of the Slave Trade, the Test Act, and the French Revolution, deeply engaged his attention; and the cause of liberty, natural, civil, and religious, being main tained at the public meetings held in that city by Mr. (now Earl) Grey, the late Mr. Lambton, Dr. Fen wick, and others, with so eminent a superiority of talent, he then probably first formed that decided attachment to the liberal side of the question which ever afterwards marked his character. On leaving Durham, he spent some time at home in general reading, in acquiring the Italian, and improving his know ledge of the French language. Thinking, probably, that he might combine the profits of a mercantUe ad venture with the pleasure of foreign travel, in 1796 he undertook a voyage to the Levant, visiting Naples, Smyrna, and Constantinople. At Pera he formed an intimacy with the late stir. Thornton, well known for his work on Turkey, which was only dissolved by the death of the latter. After seventeen months' absence, he returned to England, but not without having experienced the evils of existing hostilities, both in captivity and deliverance. In 1801, he passed a few weeks at Dantzic; and, in 1803, he visited Hamburgh, and made a pedestrian tour through Holstein, of which he published an account in the Monthly Magazine, vol. xvi. page 218. In the year 1795, Dr. Paley having become the resident rector of Bishopwearmouth, Mr. Meadley suc cessfully cultivated his acquaintance, and enjoyed his friendship till his death in 1805. On this occasion, no biographer of this celebrated -writer appearing, aud a sufficient interval having shewn the field to be un occupied, stir. Meadley, in the year 1809, after most carefully compiling, ventured to publish the \"Memoirs of Paley,\" which was well received, and a new edition was speedily called for. In 1813, he published \" Memoirs of Algernon Sydney.\" The dedication of these able memoirs to his friend, Dr. Disney, of the Hyde, in Essex, may be considered as one of the most happy and elegant specimens of Mr. Meadley's style ; while the brief \" Memoirs of stirs. Jebb,\" drawn up at Dr. Disney's request in the preceding year, have been much admired as a delicate and skilful pattern of minor biography. At a former period, he had printed, in a single octavo sheet, an \" Arranged Account of the several Motions for Parliamentary Reform.\" Some articles of minor biography also proceeded from his pen ; particularly a \" Memoir of stir. Robert Clarke,\" an ingenious young surgeon in Sunderland, and a \" Tribute to the Memory of the Rev. Robert Waugh, Vicar of Middleham.\" About this time, he withdrew from the Established Church, and avowed himself an Unitarian, in a \"Letter to the Bishop of St. David's, on some extraordinary Passages in a Charge delivered to the Clergy"], [443, "SUNDERLAND, &c. 307 Richard Markham, John Robson, William Eden, Robert Clarke, John Coxon, Thomas Richard son, and Thomas Burn. Sunderland Mechanics' Institution This institution commenced very auspiciously on the second Tuesday in February, 1825. The first year, the number of members was 312. Master tradesmen paid 12s. per annum, journeymen and apprentices 8s., besides several valuable donations. But now this institution has so much de clined, that, after reducing the expenses of management to the lowest fraction, the committee have only about \u00a36 or \u00a37 annually to lay out in binding, repairing, and the purchase of new books. The library consists of 400 volumes, on Natural and Experimental Philosophy, Chemistry, His tory, &c. Since the commencement, several of the members have gratuitously given lectures on Chemistry, Mechanics, Botany, Geography, Optics, and Astronomy. One of the ablest lecturers and most zealous promoters of this institution is Mr. Robert Renney, bookseller, and librarian of the Subscription Library. It is much to be lamented that this useful establishment is not better supported in such a populous and spirited town. Sunderland Reading Society. This institution was formed on January 31, 1803, under the effective patronage of Mr. Michael Longridge. It is held in Russell Street, and contains nearly 800 volumes, and is open to sub scribers, paying 6s. a year, three times a week. It is sometimes called the Wesleyan Library, being chiefly supported by members of the Methodist society. There are three Circulating Li braries in this place. The Theatre. This is a commodious building, situated in Drury Lane, where it was first fitted up, enlarged, and appropriated to its present purpose in 177*8, by *Mr- Thomas Bates, who had previously occu pied the Assembly Room for dramatic representations. The Sunderland stage has been the nursery of many eminent actors, who have subsequently shoue on the London boards.* Mr. of his Diocese in September, 1813.\" In this remonstrance, with great temper and force of argument he exposes the folly of penal statutes, and the injustice of charging Unitarians as blasphemers and leveUers. For the last two years of his life, stir. Meadley had been making collections for a life of John Hampden, the name of whom, by long prescription, now accompanies that of Sydney. He was also preparing materials for a memoir of his friend, Dr. Disney ; and he spent a great portion of the year 1818 in London and other parts, collecting materials for these projected works. He returned home with a hepatic affection, which soon terminated his life. He died November 20, 1818. As he had been one of the founders, and from first to last a most active and intelligent member of the committee of the Subscription Library, it was agreed by his friends to meet at the Library, and join the funeral procession as it passed along. About fifty gentlemen accordingly assembled ; and it was pleasing to see the Catholic and the Quaker uniting with the Churchman and the Dissenter in voluntarily following his remains to the grave. Shortly after, the subscribers to the Library caused a marble tablet to be placed in the principal room, bearing the following inscription : \u2014 \" To honour the memory and perpetuate the example of George Wilson Meadley, as one of the founders of this Library, who died 28th November, 1818, in the 45th year of his age, this marble was erected by the resolu tion of a general meeting of subscribers. \u2014 His correct and extensive knowledge, historical, political, and literary, was ever zealously devoted to advance the welfare of this institution, which thus records its great and irreparable loss.\" * John Emery was born at Sunderland, on the 22d December, 1777, where both his parents, who enjoyed some degree of regard as* provincial performers, were engaged in the exercise of their public duty. His"], [444, "308 EASINGTON WARD\u2014 N. D. James Cawdell was the second manager, who, in consequence of ill health, sold his interest and property in the theatre to Mr. Stephen Kemble. The latter was successively succeeded in the management by Messrs. Anderson and Faulkner, partners, Mr. Bland, and Mr. Mitchell. It is now about being opened by Messrs. Roxby and Beverley. father, who survived him, was an actor of some humour, but little originality- His mother appeared at the Haymarket theatre, in 1802, as Dame Ashfield. She was subsequently engaged at Covent-garden theatre, but seldom sustained any character of importance there. Their son received a scanty education at Eccles field, a small town in the AVest Riding of Yorkshire ; and this early residence on a spot so favourable to the acquirement of the northern dialect, contributed, no doubt, to that success in it which gave his performances their greatest celebrity. He was designed by his parents for a musician, and destined to the honours of a seat in some country orchestra ; but this very enviable lot had no charms for either his genius or ambition, and he determined, at a period of life much too immature for the free choice of a profession, to tread in the family footsteps, and become, if possible, a bright ornament to the Thespian circle. Pursuant to this deci sion, he made a modest appearance on the Brighton boards, as Old Crazy, in the farce of Peeping Tom, and acquitted himself, it may be surmised, with that dexterity which afterwards distinguished him in a conge nial line of characters. He then proceeded to York, and played for a short time in the company governed by Tate AVilkinson, who pronounced his ultimate claim to the title of \" a great actor.\" About the year 1797, his talents attracted the notice ofthe Covent-garden proprietors; and Tate, in his Wandering Paten tee, feelingly deplores their system of robbing him of his brightest ornaments, and particularly alludes to the circumstance with regard to Suett and Emery. Mr. Emery's visit to the metropolis was early, though brilliant; for, before he had attained his 21st year, we find him settled in the capital, and sustaining a branch of business remarkable for its labour, va riety, and importance. On the 21st September, 1798, he made his appearance as Frank Oatlands, in A Cure for the Heart Ache, and Lovesold, in The Miser. To those who are versed in the drama, it is scarcely necessary to observe, that the difficulties naturally attendant on this double essay must have been considerably augmented and enhanced by the high-wrought contrast between the two characters which he had undertaken to depict. From the open, generous, frank, sincere, and honest rustic, to the sordid, mer cenary, plodding, suspicious muckworm, the transition is indeed momentous and abrupt. Yet he sustained those diversified and opposite characters with superior ability, and with a success commensurate to the most sanguine hopes and wishes of himself or friends. In 1799, Mr. Emery and Mr. Fawcett went to the Haymarket, in the place of Munden and Bannister, and there Mr. Emery's talents became more developed. At Covent-garden he still was doomed to walk on in second old men, &C. Thus we find him playing Sir Jealous Traffic, in The Busy hody, and Count Cur voso, in The Cabinet, parts which could not add to his fame. In May, 1802, Mr. Emery led to the altar Miss Anne Thompson, daughter of a tradesman of that name, resident in the Borough. The stream of his life ran smooth. His Dan, John Lump, Robin Roughhead, &c. &c, made him tlie delight of the town ; and there is nothing to record, but that he reposed himself many years in the warm sunshine of public favour. In 1821, he was engaged at the English Opera-house, where he appeared in the character of Giles, in The Miller's Maid, and proved very attractive. He annually, at his benefit, produced some comic effusion. His song of York, you're wanted, and The Yorkshire Rout, are well known. About May, 1822, Mr. Emery became unwell, and he lingered on until the 25th of July, when he expired, at his house in Hyde Street, Bloomsbury ; his remains being deposited, that day se'miight, in a vault of St. Andrew's church, Holborn. Four of his sons attended, with a number of friends, to render the last sad offices ; while the church and passages were thronged with sympathetic spectators. His complaint was inflammation of the lungs; and his free course of life left no room for the physician's art to avail. The moment his death was announced, a subscription was commenced, and a benefit gotten up, for his wife and children. The mind of stir. Emery was highly capable of poetic impressions, and hence he embodied a range of cha racters, remarkable for their nice shades and latent properties, with a success fully equal to his best attempts upon the delineation of tangible character. His Caliban was an effort that the votary of Shakspeare would be ungrateful to forget. So perfect an epitome of this abortive being, rich in fraud, malice, rancour, and stupidity, was perhaps never witnessed. His representation of the rude and gallant soldier, Williams, iij Henry V., may also be mentioned as a proof of singular success. The scenes in which he engages are short and pithless to a common eye, and promise none of those noble emanations which repaid the search of ishis actor.

There were formerly horse-races on the town-moor ; but that recreation has long ago fallen into disuse. Free Masonry was established in Sunderland in 1755. While Captain Thompson was master, a handsome Hall was erected, and dedicated July 16, l\"t\"i8; but it was accidentally burnt down in November, 1783. On August 5, 1784, Dr. Brown laid the first stone of the Ph\u0153ni.v Lodge, which was dedicated with great solemnity on April 5, 1785. The Ph\u0153nix Lodge, 146, meets every first and third AVednesday. The Palatine Lodge, 153, formerly the Sea Captain's Lodge, was formed in January, 1757, and has, generally speaking, been maintained in a very flourishing condition. The meetings are held in the Golden Lion Inn. St. John's Lodge, 118, which was subsequently established, is held in Bishopwearmouth. There is also a lodge of Free Gardeners, and various other similar societies, held in Sunderland. Public Buildings The Iron Bridge. The ancient passage of the river was by two ferry-boats : the Pann-boat, a little below the situa tion of the present Bridge, and the Low-boat, which still continues nearer to the harbour. But the increasing population and trade of the place rendered this mode of passage extremely inconve nient.* It was first proposed to throw a stone arch across the river, 200 feet in span, and 280 to the crown of the arch. This plan was, however, abandoned, on account of the immense expense, the difficulty of meeting with foundations, and the inconvenience which the craft on the river must have suffered from a temporary suspension of the navigation. In 1790, Rowland Burdon, Esq., conceived the idea of throwing an arch of cast iron over the AVear ; and, after some opposition, an act of parliament was obtained for the purpose in 1792. The use of iron had been already intro duced in the construction of the arch at Coalbrook Dale, and in the bridges built by Thomas Paine ; but the novelty and advantage of the plan adopted at AVearmouth, on Mr. Burdon's suggestion, consisted in retaining, together with the use of a metallic material, the usual form and principle of the fine obduracy and recklessness of so desperate a creature, stir. Emery drew the materials of a conspi cuous personation. Of stir. Emery's Tyke it is difficult to speak. The vulgar effrontery of his first scene was so wonderfully contrasted with the fine emotions displayed on his interview with his father; his ago nizing description of leaving his parent wounded on the shore, and his honest exultation when he \"is going to work, to get the old man a supper,\" will never be forgotten by those who have witnessed them. His Moustache, in Henri Quatre, was another instance of his serio-comic powers ; and his Orson, in The Iron Chest, was one of the most surprising personations ever beheld. Mr. Emery drank cold brandy and water (a favourite beverage with the sons of Thespis) to excess, and studied all his characters on this excitement. He was extremely fond ofthe company of jockeys and prize fighters ; was a patron to pugilists, and sometimes presided as chairman at their dinners. Being a man of robust frame himself, and from his youth addicted to field-sports, he very naturally indulged in these pro pensities when his circumstances gave him the opportunity. His voice was a low tenor, almost a barritone, of little compass, and, in his youth, very pleasing ; latterly, his musical acquirements alone brought him through. He was about five feet nine inches in height; heavily built, and exceedingly strong ; his com plexion was light, and his eyes light blue. His whole appearance off the stage was very much like some of his assumptions on it ; indeed, he resembled a farmer much more than an actor. * Accidents frequently occurred at these ferries. About eight o'clock in the evening of April 20, 1795, the ferry-boat, in its passage across to Monkviearmouth, was overset; and, from about twenty-seven persons supposed to have beeu in the boat, only four or five were saved. vol. i. 4 K"], [446, "310 EASINGTON WARD\u2014 N. D. the stone arch, by the subdivision of the iron into blocks, answering to the keystones of a common arch, and which, with a much greater degree of lightness, possess, when brought to bear on each other, all the firmness of the solid stone arch. The blocks are of cast iron, five feet in depth and four in thickness, having three arms, and making part of a circle or ellipsis ; the middle arm is two feet in length, and the other two in proportion ; on each side of the arms are flat grooves, three-fourths of an inch deep and three inches broad, in which are inserted bars of malleable or wrought iron, which connect the blocks with each other, and are secured by square bolts driven through the shoulders and arms of the blocks and bar-iron, fastened by cotterells or forelocks. The whole structure consists of six ribs, each containing 105 of these blocks, which butt on each other like the voussoirs of a stone arch. The ribs are six feet distant from each other, braced to gether by hollow tubes or bridles of cast iron; and thus the blocks being united with each other in ribs, and the ribs connected and supported laterally by the bridles, the whole becomes one mass, having the property of key-stones cramped together. The whole weight of the iron is 260 tons ; 46 malleable, and 214 cast. The piers or abutments are piles of nearly solid masonry, 24 feet in thickness, 42 in breadth at bottom, and 37 at the top : the south pier is founded on the solid rock ; on the north, from the less favourable nature of the ground, the foundation is carried 10 feet below the bed of the river. The arch is the segment of a large circle, of which the chord or span is 236 feet ; the height from low water to the spring of the arch 60 feet ; and its versed sine 34 feet ; producing so flat an arch that ships of 300 tons pass the arch within 50 feet of its centre with great facility, having 94 feet clear at low water, and abundance of depth in the mid stream. The spandrils of the arch are filled with iron circles, diminishing from the abutment to tlie centre ; the superstructure is of timber, planked over, and supporting the carriage-road, formed of marie, gravel, and limestone. The whole breadth is 32 feet, with foot-paths on each side, laid with flags, and bounded by an iron balustrade ; above which, in the centre on each side, is the foUowing inscription, chosen as a pious record of the successful completion of the work : \u2014 \" Nil desperandum Auspice Deo.\" \u2014 (Nothing to be despaired of under the auspices of Pro vidence.) The whole of this magnificent structure was completed within three years, under the able and zealous direction and inspection of Mr. Thomas AAllson, of Bishopwearmouth, architect. The arch was turned on a light scaffolding, which gave no interruption whatever to the navigation of of the river : and the mode of bracing the ribs was so expeditious, that the whole structure was put together and thrown over the river in ten days, and the frame immediately removed. The foundation-stone was laid the 24th September, 1793; and the Bridge was thrown open to the public, amidst a vast concourse of spectators, on the 9th of August, 1796. An able writer in the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, speaking of this bridge, under the article Arch, says, \" Its construction is beautifully simple, and very judicious. A vast addition of strength and of stiffness is produced by lodging the wrought iron bars in grooves formed in the cast iron rails; and for this purpose it is of great importance to make the wrought iron bars fill the grooves com pletely, and even to be so tight as to require the force of the screw-bolts to draw them home to the bottom of the grooves. There can be no doubt but that this arch is able to withstand an enormous pressure, as long as the abutments from which it springs do not yield. The mutual thrust of the frames (or blocks) are all in the direction of the rails, so that no part bears any trans verse strain, so long as the arch keeps in a vertical position. AVe can hardly conceive any force that can overcome the strength of those arms by pressure, or by crushing them ; and the manner"], [447, "SUNDERLAND, &c. 311 in which the frames are connected into one rib, effectually secures the abutting joints from slipping* AVhen the bridge was opened, it was let at \u00a31380 per year ; but the tolls have gradually ad vanced, and, on October 18, 1831, they were let for one year at \u00a33240, being an increase of toll, in thirty-five years, of \u00a31860.

The Exchange Is situated in the High Street of Sunderland. It is a chaste, elegant structure, planned by Mr. Stokoe of Newcastle. The foundation-stone was laid on August 16, 1812, by Sir Henry A'ane Tempest, Bart. M. P. ; and the building was opened on the 26th May, 1814. It is 95 feet long. The lower story contains a kitchen, vault, and watch-house. The ground floor is an exchange. The rooms upon the same floor are let for brokers' offices, or public sale-rooms ; and others are set apart for the magistrates to meet in. The upper story contains the news-room : it is an excellent * On the 18th of June preceding the regular opening of the bridge, Lieutenant-general Sir George Os borne, at the head of the Royal Tay Fencibles, and the North Lincoln Militia, both quartered in Sunderland barracks, amounting to at least 1000 men, marched across the bridge, to be reviewed on AVhitburn sands. Its capability of sustaining heavy weights was again demonstrated at the time of the opening, when the Free Masons, Loyal Sunderland A'olunteers, the magistrates, and the principal gentlemen of the county of Durham, attended. Again, when the Duke of Wellington passed the bridge, it was estimated that 1800 persons were upon it, which, calculating each person at ten stone, gives a weight of 112 tons. t In the twenty-eight days from 12th July to 9th August, 1830, 73,548 foot passengers crossed the bridge, 22 ditto carrying parcels, 188 cows and horned cattle, 4256 hogs, sheep, and lambs, 1180 horses, &c. not drawing, 832 empty waggons and carts, 1222 laden ditto, 557 hired carriages with hired horses, and 786 carriages with owners' horses."], [448, "EASINGTON WARD\u2014 N.

The Custom House Is a well-finished building, situated at the east end of Fitter's Row, where it was erected, as a pri vate residence, in 17-27- The merchants and ship-owners have presented a memorial to the com missioners of the customs, requesting that a more eligible situation may be appointed. The Excise Office is in East Cross Street. The Barracks. This military establishment occupies a large square area at the easternmost extremity of Sun derland, where it was erected in 1794, and put in commission in tlie following year. The barracks contain accommodation for about 1600 infantry, with stabling for ten horses, and a hospital suita bly adapted for the reception of 80 patients. The entrance to the harbour was formerly defended bv two batteries ,- one on the south side, mounting six guns (24- pounders) ; and another, on the north side, with four guns of the same caliber: but the latter fort has been washed away by the incursions of the ocean ; and the former, together with part of the barracks, will soon share the same fate, unless some means are devised for their preservation. The Piers. The two piers, on the north and south shores of the river AVear, form the Harbour of Sunder land. In 1669, the king granted letters patent to Edward Andrew, Esq., to build a pier, and erect a light-house or light-houses, and to cleanse the harbour of Sunderland, and to raise contri butions for the purpose : the same letters forbid all masters of ships from casting out ballast within six fathoms water, and within the space of one mile southwards and one mile northwards from the mouth of the harbour, with powers to the officers of the Admiralty and ATice-Admiralty Courts to take cognizance of and punish offences. Several successive acts have been since obtained for the preservation and improvement of the port and river. Of these the earliest is the act of 3 Geo. I. The preamble states that Sunderland \" is well inhabited with rich and able merchants and trades men, and may be of great importance, as well for his majesty's service and revenue, as for the public benefit of the kingdom, having a port capable of containing many hundred sail, and very proper to be a nursery of able seamen\" for the royal navy. The act then notices the injury which the haven and river had suffered, as well by sand-banks cast up by the sea, as by the improper throw ing out of ballast in the harbour, and by the irregular and low building and want of repairing of wharf-stai.hs and ballast-quays, so that loaded keels can only pass at high tide; and after noticing the influence which the free navigation of the port will have in reducing the price of coals in the metropolis and its neighbourhood, it proceeds to appoint commissioners for twenty-one years, seven to be a committee, with powers to survey the port and river, to order all owners of wharfs and quays to keep them in repair and flanked up to the shore above high-water mark, or in default, after six months' notice, to levy \u00a35 per month, to fine persons casting out ballast in the river or harbour \u00a35 for each offence, and to levy 3d. per chaldron on the coal-owner, and Id. on the fitter for every chaldron, to be applied towards rendering the river navigable towards Newbridge, and"], [449, "SUNDERLAND, &c. 313 clearing away the great sands at the harbour-mouth. The act mentions coal, salt, and glass, as the chief exports, and exempts from the above duties coals employed in manufacturing the two last articles within the port. The limits within which the commissioners were empowered to act are described as extending \" from the promontory or point called Souter Point, about two miles from Sunderland Bar towards the north-east, and so into the sea to five fathoms at low water, and from thence in a supposed direct line till it is fully opposite to that land called Ryhope Dean, about two miles from Sunderland Bar towards the south, and continued west from the said Bar and limits up the said river to a certain place called the New-bridge in the parish of Chester-le-Street, and from thence to the city of Durham.\" By the act of 17^6, the commissioners were enabled to raise monies on the credit of the duties; by that of 1746, the duties were fixed at 2d. per chaldron, on all coals and cinders brought to the river, and delivered on board of ships, betwixt the New-bridge and Sunderland. The act of 1759 gives the commissioners power as far as Biddick Ford, and no further, and imposes 2d. per chal dron on coals or cinders brought to the river betwixt Biddick Ford and the city of Durham. The act of 1809 made the whole duty 6d. per chaldron. The object of all these acts was the building of the south pier, and the general improvement of the harbour. The preamble of the patent granted in 1669 to Mr. Andrew states, \"That the harbour and river there being very commodiously situated for the shipping of vast quantities of sea-coles, plentifully gotten and wrought there, for supply of all our subjects of our realm of England who can fetch the same, as also of foreign parts, is of late so much gorged, stopped up, and choaked ; and by the many shoals, sand beds, and much breach and rubbish daily increasing in the same, is almost ren- dered unnavigable.\" In a Retrospective Ariew of Sunderland Harbour, from the year 1755 to 1774, it is stated, \" That the channel at the mouth of the harbour was so very narrow and shoal, that ships drawing only six or seven feet water were often prevented getting out to sea ; and withal was so very crooked and oblique, that the wind, which served for conducting ships out of the harbour, was unfavourable for conveying them away to the southward, where almost the whole trade lies ; and the wind that was fair to bring them from thence, was as unfavourable for their entering the harbour, especially when it blew hard southerly, which generally brought down the largest fleets. In such a case, it was hardly possible, with the most laborious efforts, to get more than six or eight ships, and those of no greater burthen than six or eight keels, or about an hun- dred and forty-nine tons, into the harbour in one tide ; but if the surges happened to run high, even these few were in the greatest jeopardy of being bulged in the Ham (a flat sand on which the sea ran most violently), and of receiving other considerable damage, by beating one against an- other as they struggled to get over the Stell (a contracted shaUow part of the channel). The dread of these impending disasters occasioned many ships to go past the port to Shields and load there, or else wait for an opportunity of coming back to Sunderland for their loading, which was a great obstruction to trade, as well as loss to the town and parts adjacent. In northerly winds, the sea rushed so furiously into the harbour, that it was with much difficulty ships, lying in the lower part thereof, could be held with all their cables out ; and such as lay in the upper part, and at the north quay, were often sunk upon their own anchors, which were obliged to be carried out to hold them. Many keels suffered the same fate when dropping down to their respective ships upon the ebb.\" In effecting the improvements described in this document, at the date of 1774, many serious-, obstacles had to be surmounted. It was necessary to \" cut four feet and a half deep through a vol. 1. \u2014 16. 4 L"], [450, "EASINGTON WARD\u2014 N. D. 314 rock, extending five hundred feet in length, and one hundred and eighty in breadth;\" then, \"by opening the mouth of the harbour, and altering the direction of the pier, the sea, which ran so violently into the haven, is now diverted and thrown upon the north shore below, where its strength is broken and exhausted. Substantial moorings have been contrived and deposited in proper places of the haven, to hold the ships fast, thereby superseding any further use of their anchors, which heretofore had been so dangerous, and the cause of sinking many, both ships and craft.\" The Pann-sand must have been a \" notorious obstacle\" in those days, as they observe that \" it is now so far dragged away, as to allow keels to pass at low water, and ships at high water, without running foul of anchors as usual.\" It is then observed, \" that a considerable progress had been made in that important and improved, though critical, undertaking, of building a pier from the main shore into the sea, in order to form a new bason, as well as to check and turn aside the large quantities of ballast and gross matter which are perpetually washing out of the road, that they may not lodge upon the bar, nor be driven into the harbour, which purposes have been already, in a good degree, answered.\" The benefit of building the pier consists not only in improving the chan nel, but in procuring about four feet additional depth of water ; so that \" ships from twelve to fourteen keels, or about two hundred and seventy tons burthen, that formerly could but take in from four to six keels, or about one hundred and six tons, within the harbour, now go out to sea full laden.\" They then observe \" the prodigious saving in the articles of extra keel-dues, trim ming, and an immense quantity of coals which inevitably drop down and are lost between the ships and keels when casting at sea.\" But to return more particularly to the piers. The mouth of the harbour being, in 1785, choaked up by a large sand-bank, so that scarcely a light ship could enter, Mr. Robert Shout, the resident engineer, suggested that a temporary wooden pier should be constructed, and run across the old channel, which at that time extended as far as the north beacon, in order to contract it, and enable the ebb-tide to scour itself a deeper channel. His project being approved of, it was put in execution in 1786, by commencing what is now called the North Pier. The work then begun was built with timber, or carcase-work, and extended from high water mark 1500 feet into the sea. The effects produced by it were truly beneficial ; for, in a few months, there was a deep and spacious channel. Its utility being now no longer a matter of speculation, it was judged ne cessary, in order to preserve the carcases, to face them with a permanent pier, which was begun in 1 788, and previous to the death of stir. Robert Shout, a length of nearly 700 feet of solid pier, built on piles, was finished ; to which, Mr. Pickerncll, his successor, added 90 feet. Since that time, this pier, at various intervals, has been considerably extended, and is at present in length 1850 feet. About 280 feet from its extremity is an elegant octagonal light house, which was built in 1802, from a design of Mr. Pickernel, engineer. It is of freestone, and is 68 feet in height from the pier to the under-side of the cap. It is lighted by gas lamps, placed in nine reflectors, of 18 inches diameter. The gas is made at the place. Two neat stone cottages have subsequently been erected on the pier, for the residence of attendants, and who are ready to give assistance to ships entering the harbour in bad weather. This pier is now in want of repairs, and it is expected that the commissioners* will soon rebuild part of it. * The commissioners are empowered to collect 4id. from the coal-owners, and l-|d. from the fitters, for every chaldron of coal exported from the port. Thus they have (from the great quantity of coal now ex ported) a certain and considerable annual income, which, by the act, is to be expended on improving the harbour and extending the piers. The act of 1809 contains, \u2014 appointment of commissioners ; qualification,"], [451, ".SlITPOI) K R UA .v | ,, From tin' \\mi-iIi |',,-i\\"], [452, ""], [453, "SUNDERLAND, &c. 315 The South Pier, commenced by Mr. Andrew in the reign of Charles IL, was, in the year 1726, 300 yards in length, and had cost \u00a320,000. In 1746, it appears that 33 yards had been added to its length. In 1765, it had cost \u00a350,000, and it was estimated that its completion would require as much more. The structure was exceedingly damaged by a high flood in November, 1771 \u00bb ancl the preamble to the act of 1785 states, that the east end had become ruinous, and in danger of falling, and that it was necessary to take it down, and rebuild it in a different direction, less ex posed to the violence of the sea and land floods. Since that period, the pier has been extended, at a great expense, to the length of 2000 feet from the engineer's house. The foundations of the easternmost end have been carefully and solidly laid, with the aid of the diving-bell; and the structure, which is now nearly finished, is protected at the south-east quarter by an extensive break-water. It is in contemplation to erect a handsome and elegant light-house near its extremity. A tide-light is at present placed on the pier. This pier forms a delightful and favourite promenade for the inhabitants of Sunderland, parti cularly when a fleet of ships are expected. It sometimes occurs that from one to two hundred ships enter the harbour in one tide, and nearly as many go out, which forms a scene scarcely to be paralleled.* The Borough The charter of Bishop Morton, dated 1634, constituting Sunderland a corporate borough, hav ing been suffered to expire, no mayor or aldermen were chosen to replace those first nominated. \u00a3200 per annum real, or \u00a36000 personal property ; meetings ; commissioners to pay their own expenses ; a committee of thirteen may be elected- for one year ; chairman to be elected twice a year ; powers to elect officers ; no commissioner to vote on removal of an officer, unless he have acted twelve months ; no commis sioner to hold any office, except that of collector of the customs ; power in the commissioners, or such persons as they shall under hand and seal appoint, to improve the navigation, cleanse and deepen the channel, and build a pier or piers, quays, or jetties, and \" for that purpose to dig, take up, and carry away rocks, soil and gravel, rubbish, or other gross matter, which shall obstruct, prejudice, or hinder the navigation of the river, port, &c or the improvement thereof,\" and to take gravel, soil, &c. in the grounds of persons adjoining, within the limits of the act, tendering reasonable satisfaction ; power to purchase lands proper for the erec tion of quays, piers, jetties, \u2014 where persons will not treat, the value to be ascertained by jury ; verdicts and judgments to be returned to the sessions ; they may proceed to work after a tender made ; the value may be tried in a feigned issue. Other clauses relate to the engineer, harbour-master, ballast-keels, ballast-hills, exemptions from duty, &c &c. Mr. William Jessop, civil engineer, being consulted by the commissioners respecting the piers, recom mended the formation of a scouring bason, by inclosing an area of about 12 acres on the north side of the river, between the north pier and the town ; the object of which was to assist the ebbing in deepening the channel. This has not yet been adopted. * Mr. R. Dodds, civil engineer, when at Sunderland in 1794, making a survey of Sunderland harbour, writes thus upon the scene before him : \u2014 \" Does any one wish to have a just idea of the extensive trade of this port ? Let him go where I once stood. No sooner there, than casting my eyes to the southward, over the curling crystal flood, as Homer beautifully observes, I saw a wood of ships ; a zephyr was gently fanning them to the port, all sails drew (set), and their streamers were waving in the wind. This prominent point, the pier end, where I stood, stretching in the sea, soon became thronged. Here with glad steps came some of Eve's fairest daughters; some hung on their arm the cherub form, and by their side the tender offspring led. What glittering eyes of gladness were fixed on this fleet ! some to husbands, some to lovers. Does the artist want a subject of nature to paint joy and gladness by ? He cannot be better served than here. And for sadness, on the days of departure, he would see the half-closed eye, with the crystal tear dropping down many a fair cheek.\""], [454, "316 EASINGTON AVARD\u2014 N. D. But though the members of the corporation did not preserve their jurisdiction, \"the privileges granted to the inhabitants have been expressly acknowledged by the crown, and by the courts of judicature in several suits at law, particularly touching the herbage of the Town Moor, and the soil thereof.\" The first case in which the borough was acknowledged is noticed in page 266. The number of twelve capital burgesses called Freemen, and the eighteen inferior burgesses called Stallingers, is, upon any vacancy by death, filled up by the freemen, in whom the right of election is by long usage vested. The freemen are elected from among the stallingers resident within the borough, and the stallingers are selected from the other inhabitants. The records of the corpora tion are supposed to have been destroyed.* Grassmen are first mentioned in I7I8. For many years, the Moor was alleged by the fishermen of Sunderland to be their property, as a traditionary right, in consequence of their having for centuries dried their nets upon it. In 1814, they determined to try their right, and impounded a horse, grazing upon the Moor, belong ing to George Robinson, Esq., one of the freemen. An action was commenced by that gentleman against the parties, in which he obtained a verdict ; but no title was necessary to be proved by Mr. Robinson (as one of the freemen) to sustain his action, the onus of shewing a right lying upon the fishermen to justify their act, the legality of which they failed to establish. After this, the Moor was claimed by the parish, under an agreement in which the freemen and stallingers and the fishermen concurred in relinquishing their rights in it for the benefit of the parochial rates. This agreement, which was made in the year 1819, has been fulfilled by the fishermen, who have ever since abandoned all pretensions to the Moor; but although it was made at a public meeting of the inhabitants, and in some degree ratified by leases afterwards granted by some freemen, reserving the rent for the benefit of the poor, yet the freemen and stallingers do not concur in admitting the arrangement to be binding upon them, as it was not consented to by every member of their corpo ration. In 1828, many of the inhabitants, being much displeased with the breach of this agree ment, presented a petition to the bishop of Durham (who, as lord of the manor, or as having jura regaba in the county palatine, is supposed to be legally entitled to the soil of the Moor), to adopt such proceedings as might bring the rights of the freemen and stallingers to a fair trial and final decision ; but his lordship, under the direction of bis advisers, declined to interfere until their title to be a corporation should be first tried by an information in the nature of quo warranto. The Court of King's Bench was accordingly applied to, and a rule granted against several of the free men, to shew cause why such an information should not be filed. After a long argument on both sides, the court decided that as the freemen and stallingers did not interfere with the rule or go- * A few of the rolls of the court baron and view of frank pledge of the borough of Sunderland have been preserved, from which the following are extracts : \u2014 \u00a3. ... d.

This result still leaves it uncertain whether or not the freemen and stallingers be a legal corporate body, and also whether they have any legal right to the Moor. But the extent and value of the Moor is progressively decreasing by the in roads of the sea; and, considering the uncertain tenure by which it is held, no effectual means will probably be adopted to save this valuable portion of public ground from destruction. Public Improvements, Markets, Qc. In 1809, an act was obtained for paving, lighting, cleansing, watching, and otherwise improving the town of Sunderland ; for removing the market, building a market-house and a town-hall, and for establishing a river watch. By this act commissioners were appointed, who were vested with powers to levy an assessment for cairying the purposes of the said act into execution; for remov ing nuisances, paving, lighting, watching, and otherwise improving the town.* Another act was obtained in the year 1826, wherein the powers of tlie commissioners were more fully explained and enlarged, and wherein they were authorized to levy a higher contribution, to carry the purposes of this act into execution. The commissioners have exercised their extended powers, under this amended act, with great spirit and propriety. Nuisances have been removed, tlie principal foot paths flagged, and many useful regulations have been enforced. The New Markets are extensive and well arranged. The principal entrance is from the High Street. It contains 250 shops, occupied by butchers, shoe-makers, and dealers in vegetables, fruit, old clothes, earthen-ware, bacon, &c. Above one-half of the shops are let to occasional oc cupants. The butter, eggs, and poultry market is at the north end. The ground and houses on which the market stands cost \u00a34200. Formerly the butchers' stalls stood in the High Street. The commissioners have also established a cattle-market once a fortnight, and a half-yearly hiring for servants. They have purchased from the bridge commissioners, by an annual payment of \u00a310, the tolls of the market, and have many useful improvements in contemplation. The Gas Works were established in 1823 ; and the town was first illuminated with this igneous vapour ou the 9th of March, 1824. The cost of these works was about \u00a38000. The buildings, which are situated at the foot of Russell Street, contain 30 retorts and two gasometers, capable of holding 25,000 cubic feet of gas. * \" Fifty years ago, at the entrance of Sunderland, on the south side of the street, there was a high and rising ground, beginning at Sans Street and ending at George Street. The houses that were situated there had a terrace before them, which extended a considerable way into the street. At the north side of this terrace there was a wall, and by several steps you descended to the horse-road, which was considerably lower than the terrace ; this part was then called the High Justice Trees. A gentleman informed me he recol lected when the stumps of some of the trees were to be traced upon this terrace. Proceeding eastwards, from George Street to Maud's Lane, on the south side of the street, the ground was high, forming a sloping bank, but not terraced. From Maude's Lane to the foot of Grey Street, a high and rising ground com menced, which was terraced, and a wall built at the north side of it. This terrace extended a great way into the street, and was considerably higher than the horse-road ; there were a flight of steps (about twenty) to descend into the horse-road ; this part was called the Low Justice Trees. These high grounds were afterwards lowered, which considerably improved the appearance of the town. Where cellars formerly had been there arose shops. Previous to the opening out of the ground at Bishopwearmouth as building scites, the most respectable inhabitants resided at the east end of Sunderland ; but as the new streets in Bishop wearmouth were erected, they regularly moved thither.\" \u2014 Burnett's Hist, of Sunderland, p. 41 et seq. TOL. I. 4 M"], [456, "318 EASINGTON WARD\u2014 N. D. The Water Works, from which Sunderland and Bishopwearmouth are supplied with excellent water, are situated at the head of Fountain Street, where the water is raised from a well 144 feet deep by a steam-engine, which lifts 150 gallons per minute into two tanks or reservoirs, capable of holding 120,000 gallons each. The water is conveyed through pipes to the houses of the principal inhabitants ; and about thirty pants or public fountains are erected in different parts of the town, for the gratuitous supply of the poor. These works were established in 1824, at the expense of \u00a35000, raised in shares of \u00a325 each. Baths, 4'c. \u2014 Sunderland is a place of great resort during the bathing season, when it is crowded with persons who visit it for the purpose of enjoying the salubrious exercise of sea-bathing, for which the sands are well adapted. A set of metallic, vapour, and hot and cold salt water baths, were established on the Town Moor in 1821, by Mr. George Mitcheson. There are also hot and cold baths at Hendon, which were formed in 1800, by Mr. Graham Smith; and on the shore are a number of machines for bathing in the sea. Trade, Shipping, fye An ample and correct statement of the trade of this port will be given in the general view of the county. Here it may be sufficient to observe, that by Parliamentary Returns, ordered to be printed March 11, 1828, Sunderland appears to be, in point of maritime importance, the fourth port in the United Kingdom ; that it forms the 1-21 st part of the tonnage of the whole United Kingdom, l-17th of the whole tonnage of England, l-3d of the whole tonnage of Scotland, and that its gross amount of tonnage actually exceeds, by 5087 tons, that of the whole of Ireland. There are 651 ships and vessels belonging to this port : tlie amount of tonnage is 113,206, and of seamen 4868.* * No class of seamen excels those of this port in strength, courage and nautical skill. During the List long-protracted war, the Sunderland colliers often defied and beat off the enemies' privateers. The follow ing instance of heroism, related in the Percy Anecdotes, is scarcely to be paralleled in the annals of British daring : \u2014 The Isabella, of Sunderland, Captain Hornsby, while steering for the Hague, fell in with the Marquis of Brancas, a French privateer, with a crew of 75 men, ten guns, and eight swivels, besides 300 small arms. The Isabella's crew consi-^ted of five men and two boys : she carried four guns and two swivels. Upon observing the privateer, Captain Hornsby asked his men to stand by him ; they promised to stand by him to the last. He then hoisted the British colours; returned the fire of the enemy's chase with his two swivels. The Frenchman called upon him to strike. He coolly returned an answer of defiance. Upon this the privateer poured such showers of bullets into the Isabella, that her crew retreated to close quarters. Twice the enemy attempted to board on the larboard quarter ; Hornsby, by a turn of tlie helm, frustrated their attempts. The Frenchman still kept firing upon him. The action had now lasted an hour, when the privateer running furiously upon his larboard bow, entangled his bowsprit among the shrouds. The captain of the privateer bawled out, \" Strike, you English dog.\" Hornsby challenged him to come on board and strike his colours if he durst. The Frenchman then threw twenty men on board; but a general discharge of blunderbusses from the Isabella's crew soon caused them to retreat. The ships now got disentangled, and the privateer tried to board on the starboard side; when Hornsby and his mate shot each his man as they were lashing the ships together. The Frenchman again commanded him to strike ; upon his refusal, twenty fresh men were ordered to attack the crew in their quarters with hatchets and pole-axes; but Hornsby and his crew, from their close quarters, kept up a constant fire, and a second time the Frenchmen retreated, hauling their dead after them with hooks. The ships being stiil lashed together, the enemy kept up a con stant tire upon their close quarters ; Hornsby returned the fire with spirit and effect. Observing them crowded together behind their mainmast for shelter, he aimed a blunderbuss, which happened to be doubly loaded, through a mistake, with twice twelve balls, which burst and threw him down ; but in an instant lie started up, though much bruised. The blunderbuss made terrible havoc among the Frenchmen ; they dis entangled the ships, leaving their pistols, pole-axes, and graplings behind them. Hornsby then fired his"], [457, "SUNDERLAND, &c. 319 Ship Building is carried on here with uncommon spirit, 40 or 50 vessels being usually on the stocks at a time. About 1500 ship-carpenters are employed. Only two vessels exceeding 500 tons burthen trade to the port; but larger vessels are sometimes built here. On March 2, 1798, the Lord Duncan was launched from Southwick quay, and admeasured 925 tons. Her extreme length was 143 feet 10 inches, and her breadth 39 feet. This noble ship was accidentally blown up at Port-au-Prince in 1807-* The Lime Trade is carried on to a great extent in this port. It employs about 30 vessels, of the burthen of 40 to 100 tons each. About 40,000 AVinchester chaldrons of lime are burnt an nuaUy at the kilns of PaUion, Southwick, Bishopwearmouth, and Monkwearmouth. The export of this article is chiefly to the Yorkshire ports, and the eastern coast of Scotland. Glass Works, on the shores of the AVear, have, during the last century, experienced an increas ing demand for their goods, of which large quantities are exported annually from Sunderland. There are in the vicinity of the town eight bottle houses, and one flint, and two crown glass-houses. Roperies. \u2014 In 1797, a Patent Ropery was established by Messrs. Grimshaw, Webster, and Co., at Deptford, on the Wear. The machinery is impelled by steam, and a long rope-walk is rendered unnecessary, as ropes of any length may be fabricated in a building of less than 100 feet in length. The advantages recited in the patent are to the effect that, by the mode therein described, the strain on each part of the rope is equalized; and in the thread or yarn, the fibres of the hemp are dispersed longitudinally, and, instead of being spun from the bite or double, are spun from tlie end of it. In the strand, the yarns are dispersed in spirals, each yarn increasing in length in propor tion to its distance from the centre; and in the rope itself, each strand is regulated by machinery, so as to be made of equal length, and thus every part is so disposed as to afford its proportional two starboard guns into the enemy's stern. The ships engaged each other for two hours, yard-arm to yard arm. The Isabella's hull, masts, yards, sails, and rigging, were shot through and through, and her ensign dismantled. A shot striking the Brancas between wind and water, she sheered off. Hornsby, erecting his shattered ensign gave the Frenchman three cheers. The Frenchman returning, fired a dreadful volley into the stern of the Isabella. Captain Hornsby was wounded in the temple, which bled profusely. He called to his men to stand to their arms ; and taking close quarters, they sustained the shock of three most tre mendous broadsides, returning the fire, and the privateer again sheered off. They cheered, and set up again their ensign. The Frenchman returned, and fired two broadsides, summoning a surrender \u2014 a final defiance was hurled at him. The captain of the privateer run his ship alongside \u2014 his crew refused to board. He then cut the lashings and sheered off. Hornsby fired a gun ; upon which the magazine blew up, and the privateer went to the bottom. Out of 75 men, 36 were killed or wounded ; all the rest perished in the deep, except three. The king presented Hornsby with a large gold medal for this heroic act. In the memorable engagement which Admiral Lord Duncan had with the Dutch fleet, on the 11th Octo ber, 1797, the flag ofthe Venerable, Lord Duncan's ship, was shot away by the Dutch Admiral, De Winter. John Crawford, a sailor belonging to Sunderland, then on board the Venerable, upon observing this, imme diately ran up the shrouds (amidst the fire of the enemy) with a marline-spike in his hand, and, with the greatest coolness and intrepidity, nailed the Venerable's flag to the topgallantmast head- For this heroic and daring action, he received a pension of \u00a330 a year; and his townsmen, in testimonial of his heroism, presented him with a silver medal, bearing this inscription: \" Orbis est Dei. The Town of Sunderland to John Crawford, for gallant services on 11th October, 1797\" Reverse, \"Duncan and Glory! British Valour !\" * The smallest Vessel belonging to Sunderland was one of 15 tons, built in a yard behind the Subscription Library. She was conveyed on a wheeled carriage to the pier to be launched with great parade, by a well known running fitter named Willie Harrison. She proceeded to Jamaica, with a crew of four men, in tow of a West India ship, from which she was separated during a violent storm, which continued several days. But this little vessel outlived its fury, and arrived at her port three weeks before her bulky companion."], [458, "EASINGTON AVARD\u2014 N. D. 320 aid when the rope is strained. By experiments, made at Shields, Sunderland, Liverpool, and London, in 1806, it appeared that ropes made by this machinery possessed nearly double the strength of those of equal dimensions on the common principle, and that the durability of the former in mines, where they are exposed to much friction, was in the same proportion. Patent ropes of great length are required for the collieries. One has just been manufactured for Hetton colliery, measuring 2300 yards in length, 5 inches in circumference, and weighing about 3 tons 3 cwt. Another improved ropery, worked by steam, has been erected in South Street, Bishopwear mouth, by the patentee, Mr. John Grimshaw. There are here several other roperies, in part of which some of the modern improvements have been adopted. In Bishopwearmouth are extensive iron works, belonging to Messrs. White, Sons, Kirk, and Panton ; and in other parts are anchor and chain-cable manufactories. Here are also several con siderable works for the manufacture of earthenware, great quantities of which, particularly of tlie coarser sorts, are sent to different parts of the kingdom. Grindstones are likewise exported in large quantities. Here are three steam sawing-mills, several copperas works, and every variety of trade required by the shipping of the port, including 26 bread and ship-biscuit bakers; 60 but chers, many of whom carry on the trade extensively ; 13 public brewers and maltsters; and 263 hotels, inns, and taverns, besides the beer-houses opened under a late act of parliament. The Imports and Exports of Sunderland are considerable, and as various as those of any other port. The imports are chiefly corn, flour, wine, spirituous liquors, timber, tar, deals, flax, iron, &c ; and the exports are coal, lime, glass, earthenware, grindstones, copperas, &c. The import of goods direct from foreign countries to this port is very small, being scarcely equal to one-half of the consumption of the town and neighbourhood ; and, as stir. Garbutt says, in his History of Sunderland, a \" want of spirit seems to prevail amongst the merchants, who, rather than purchase their cargoes abroad, prefer having them from the neighbouring ports, at second-hand rate, much to the disadvantage of themselves and the other inhabitants of the town.\" But the merchants of Sunderland have lately begun to evince more spirit and enterprize, and will soon be able to supply the inhabitants with foreign goods by a direct intercourse. Ship Insurance Offices. \u2014 There are six different insurance clubs in this port, in which the capi tal insured amounts to \u00a3734,550, on 532 ships. Calculating the average loss at eight per cent., the annual loss upon the sum insured will be \u00a358,764, which amount is paid by the members, or ship-owners belonging to the clubs. Two banks, the one belonging to Messrs. Jonathan Backhouse and Co., and the other to Messrs. Chater and Co., give facilities to the trade of the port. \u2014 Petty Sessions are held every Wednesday and Saturday, in the Exchange buildings. There are ten steam-boats, varying from 4 to 43 tons each, employed in towing vessels out and into the harbour.* There are two life-boats at the mouth of Sunderland harbour, which were esta- * The Trinity House, or Incorporated Company of Masters and Mariners of the port of Newcastle, extend their jurisdiction to Sunderland, Blyth, Hartlepool, AVhitby, and Staithes; and, by an act passed in 1801, they were empowered to levy a toll for maintaining beacons and buoys at Holy Island. In December, 1803, this house appointed a ruler of pilots for Sunderland ; \" but he was violently and perseveringly obstructed in the execution of his office by the ship-owners of that port, who discarded the licensed pilots, and em ployed their own servants. At this crisis, the Trinity House acted without energy or authority ; and the licensed pilots, being reduced to a state of starvation, in 1805 revolted from obedience to the house. Mr. Brown, the Ruler, was recalled in May, 1806, having received from the house, above what he got from the pilots, \u00a3293, 16s., and was now voted a pension of \u00a320 per annum.

They are constructed on a plan suggested by John Davison, Esq., and differ entirely from any others in their principle; for when filled with water, and with any number of men, the boats are still sufficiently buoyant to preclude all danger. The inside of each boat consists of compartments, all of which are air-tight, so that if the boat should be staved by striking a rock or any other hard substance, it can admit no more water than the size of the division, which will occasion little or no injury. These boats have keels, shod with iron, which adds greatly to their strength as well as ballast. The only cork used is on the outside, which answers for a fender, and adds a little to the buoyancy. The River Wear is navigable for small craft up to Biddick Ford, a little below Chester-le-Street, and about nine miles above Sunderland. About 600 keels are employed in conveying coals from the numerous collieries, on both sides of the river, to ships in the harbour. Two dredging vessels, one of which has a double, and the other a single set of apparatus, are constantly employed in cleansing the harbour. Wet Docks. \u2014 The harbour of Sunderland, though much improved, does not afford accommoda tion for the rapidly increasing number of vessels belonging to the port. In 1816, Mr. William B-1I submitted to the harbour commissioners a proposal for forming a floating dock near the mouth of the river. After stating the method by which a fund might be raised for effecting this intended improvement, and the probable revenue which would arise from it, the projector asserts, \" When the period shall arrive that we shall have a floating or wet dock at Sunderland (for I am certain that it will take place at some future period), the property in the parish of Sunderland will rapidly increase in value, and the east part of the parish, which is at present of comparatively little esti mation, will then become of considerable importance ; tlie collieries upon the AVear will become more extensive, in proportion as vessels will be encouraged to trade to the port ; and Sunderland will become the first port in the kingdom, as far as respects the coal-trade, as it is a fact, admitted by all sea- faring men, that should the harbour of Sunderland ever be made a good one, its locality as a sea coed port will give it the palm of pre-eminence over every other.\" The project of establishing wet docks was again suggested to the commissioners in the year 1829; but their committee, after much deliberation, reported and advised, \" that the pre sent commissioners may entirely avoid entering upon the subject further as a board, under the 49th and 59th Geo. III., having the matter perfectly open to any body of adventurers who may be inclined to undertake the same, and in which project they might receive the assurance, that they would be assisted to the utmost by the commissioners of the river AVear; but on the direct understanding, that their income will only be considered responsible for the purposes of the pre sent, or any future act limited like the present, ' to the preservation and improvement of the river,' port, and haven.\" Tlie committee then say, \" We are of opinion that the interests of the two would clash, and that they ought to be kept entirely separate.\" Thus, so far as the commissioners are concerned as a body, the idea of forming a wet dock falls to the ground. \" A quay line is now laid down; beyond which line, towards the main channel, no docks, quays, &c. should be constructed.\" The commissioners consider this \" of the utmost value and importance, since it de fines the limits of the river ; and it wiU be the means of preserving the integrity of the navigation to the use of the public.\" But the imperious necessity of some increase of accommodation being afforded to the shipping of the port, continued to press upon the attention of those interested in its trade and prosperity. The harbour being frequently choaked up with shipping, great danger and confusion were expe- vol. i. N"], [460, "322 EASINGTON WARD\u2014 N. D. rienced, particularly during a land flood. This induced several vessels to pass, and enter the Tyne. The inadequacy of the harbour for the increased shipping employed in the coal-trade was observed, and gave rise to many projects, which threatened to arrest and diminish the prosperity of Sunderland. Seaham harbour was formed by a powerful coUiery owner ; the improvement of Hartlepool harbour was proposed ; railways were suggested for connecting the richest coal-field in the county with the Tyne ; and it was recommended to convert Jarrow Slake into one vast wet dock. These movements very naturally alarmed the inhabitants of Sunderland ; and a public meeting was convened on the Sth of September, 1831, to consider upon the propriety of building commodious wet docks. At that meeting, a deputation was appointed, and directed to apply to the commissioners of the river Wear, to request them, as being a constituted body, and having a fund, to be pleased to build a commodious wet dock. The deputation waited upon the commis sioners on the 15th of September, when the latter appointed a special committee, which, on the 12th of October, delivered the following report: \u2014 \"Gentlemen, \u2014 The special committee, appointed on the 14th September last, 'to obtain and disseminate accurate information on the subject of wet docks, and to report thereon at an early meeting of the board,' have, in pursuance of the above order, proceeded to the examination of such documents as have been sub mitted to our consideration, \u2014 \" First \u2014 By a committee appointed at a public meeting of ' the ship-owners, merchants, and other inhabi tants of Sunderland, the AVearmouths, and their vicinity,' holden at the Assembly-room on the 5th September. \"Secondly \u2014 By a committee appointed at a 'general meeting of the ship-owners, holden at the Exchange on the 23d September ;' and, \" Thirdly \u2014 By a committee from the general meeting of merchants, holden at the Exchange on the 29th September. \" The first committee presented us with the resolutions agreed upon at the Assembly-room, together with a ' statement of probable revenue for the purpose of meeting the expenses of a wet dock,' according to the commerce of the port in 1830 ; which statement we transmitted to the ship-owners and to the merchants \u2014 not as -i document emanating in any way from this committee \u2014 but as a statement which might, in some measure, influence the nature of their deliberations. \" The ship-owners did not adopt the scale laid down therein, so far as regarded their own particular inte rests ; but framed another on a different principle, without stating the general amount to be derived there from. This statement, therefore, required an examination in detail, and also to be submitted to the test of the official returns. \" The merchants' committee presented a scale of rates also, but without giving the general amount, and their statement has been examined in a similar way. \"Deputations from the said committees, together with a deputation from this committee, applied to the coal-owners of the river AVear, at a meeting of the trade convened for that purpose on the 4th October, for 2d. per chaldron on the annual vend, in aid; but no answer has yet been received from them. \u00a3. s. d. \"On the shipping, the duties or rates would appear to be ... ... 8,848 16 4 \" On the merchants' dues, according to their own schedules ... ... 895 9 5 9,744 5 9 \"And on the vend, (if granted) 2d. per chaldron, on 523,557 chaldrons ... 4,362 19 6 Forming a total of \u00a314,107 5 3 \" Various other presumed sources of revenue have been pointed out, which are stated in the appendix ; and we may add, on the best authority, that the general trade of the port is constantly and rapidly increasing. \" The rates and duties will naturally become payable from the date of the passing \"of the intended act ; the revenues of the commissioners being solely applicable to the 'improvement and preservation of the river AVear.'

At present, there is no fixed plan. stir. Stephenson, in his report, has named four different situations, which appear to him to be eligible; but he gives the preference to ' that on the Sunderland side of the river, opposite the Potatoe Garth, and immediately east from the Barracks ;' and on that scite he forms his estimate. But his estimate* is made, according to his own report, without fully ascertaining the nature of the subsoil by boring or mining, and also without taking into consideration the value of private property to be purchased. His plan sweeps away the whole of the commissioners' houses, grounds, work-shops, and other buildings ; and he further recommends that ' the whole of the Bar rack grounds' should be included ; and the Barracks have recently been repaired by government at a heavy expense. He also states that the staiths and other establishments for trade would ' fall to be connected by branch rail-ways with those already leading to the inland collieries,' on which he has furnished no estimate whatever. \" On stir. Stephenson's plan and estimate it would be in vain to go to parliament at any time, and parti cularly next session, as they are not framed in compliance vvith the standing orders of the House ; and before a petition is presented, the assents and dissents of all those whose property is to be affected must be ascer tained, &c. \"It appears, therefore, to this committee, that the commissioners should, in the .first place, by careful examination, satisfy themselves that the means proposed are sufficient ; they should then consider the most eligible scite (which has never yet been done) ; and it may be necessary to assist their judgment by the ad- vice of an able and competent engineer, and who should form a plan according to the mode prescribed by the standing orders of the House, together with an estimate of the probable expense of the docks, and, if necessary, of the rail-way \u2014 if that should be considered a necessary portion of the undertaking. And until these essential preliminaries are completed, it appears to your committee that nothing effective can be done ; for not only must the commissioners be perfectly satisfied vvith the feasibility ofthe plan, of the correctness of the estimates, and the extent of the means proposed, but the public favour must also be conciliated by a clear and convincing statement \u2014 which statement shall be above all suspicion. \" In conclusion, we consider the object of such immense importance, that we would recommend the board to enter upon the consideration of the subject free from all prejudice ; not to enter upon a measure of this magnitude rashly, lest by one false step at the commencement the object should be lost for ever ; but to proceed on safe and stable grounds, and with due deliberation. And the committee have come to the una nimous conclusion, that the question may be advantageously entertained by the board, in the hope that the more fully it is discussed, and the more maturely it is considered, means may be adopted, and facilities may arise, to bring to a happy conclusion an object so closely connected with the future welfare and prosperity ofthe port of Sunderland. Commission Room, October 12, 1831.\" * \" ' Until the nature of the subsoil be fully ascertained by boring or mining, tlie reporter estimates this wet dock, of thirty acre. in extent, and capable of affording berthage for 300 ships of 100 tons eac'i, at the sum of -.193,311, 7s. 9d.' \""], [462, "324 EASINGTON WARD.\u2014 N. D. During the discussion that ensued at this meeting, it was observed that if the commissioners would demand 6d. per chaldron on the annual vend of coals, instead of 4d., the present impost, the difference would be sufficient to build the wet dock. A meeting of the committee, appointed to carry the plan for obtaining a floating dock into execution, was held two days after the public meeting ; when Mr. Giles, engineer, attended, and gave it as his decided opinion, that plans, esti mates, &c. might easily be prepared in time to lay before the House of Commons in the following session. He afterwards took a survey of the ground near the South Pier, which appears the most eligible for the purpose. A subscription to defray the expenses of the preliminary steps, amount ing to near _P1000, was raised in a few minutes. At a meeting of the merchants, ship-owners, and inhabitants of Monkwearmouth, held Novem ber 9, 1831, after stating the expediency of forming a capacious wet dock, it was rest:.1 ed, \" That the situation near the Pier, at the north side of the harbour, is, by its natural and local advantages, the best adapted for such an object. \u2014 That the reports and plans submitted to the meeting are highly satisfactory, and lead to the conclusion that a capacious wet dock, sufficient for all the exigencies of the port, can be formed on the north side, near the en trance of the harbour, without having recourse to a compulsory tax upon shipping, too onerous for the present depressed state of that important interest, and can be completed in a comparatively short period. \u2014 That application be made to parliament during the ensuing session, for an act to enable commissioners thereby appointed to carry into effect the formation of a wet dock near the entrance at the north side of the harbour. \u2014 That application be made to the commissioners of the river AVear for their sanction and support.\" A committee was then appointed to carry these reso lutions into effect ; and a subscription, amounting to _(?2310, was instantly made. This dock is proposed to be 30 acres in extent, which, it is calculated, will hold half as many vessels as can at present lie between the Hetton Staiths and the Pier. It is intended to make an entrance to the dock on the south, and another on the west ; the excavations to be deposited in the hollow on the north, as the east, or sea side, is already sufficiently protected by sand-banks. The expense of this under taking, it is stated, will be much less than what it is calculated a dock on the opposite side of the river would cost. This rivalry of interests renders the speedy and effectual formation of a floating dock rather doubtful, though such an appendage to the present harbour is clearly essential to the prosperity of the port. Inhabitants. The male inhabitants of Sunderland, generally speaking, in manner and conversation bear the impress of a nautical people. The ladies are mostly handsome, and dress very gaily. But the most striking characteristic of the inhabitants is a frank, unsuspecting hospitality, very uncommon amongst those who reside in old, populous, corporate towns. Their spirit and benevolence are evinced in the fact, that, within the last 30 years, above _P100,000 has been expended upon public edifices and establishments ; while the various charitable institutions, including the poor-rates, distribute upwards of i?l 0,000 annually ; and all this has been effected during a period in which, according to a recent declaration of the venerable Mr. S. Chapman, the ship-owners of the port had sustained losses to the amount of _P50,000. In 1816, the sum of _f?2487, 9s. 2d. was voluntarily subscribed for the purpose of employing the labouring poor.

Some discoveries have occasionally been made at Fulwell, which, as Surtees remarks, might lead a desperate antiquary to fix the station ad Vedram on the lofty hills which command the coast.* The foUowing letter appeared in the Gent. Mag., October, 1763 :\u2014 \" A few weeks ago, a gentleman from Durham shewed me some large teeth and two Roman coins. The teeth, he said, he took out of the jaw of a gigantic skeleton of a man ; and the coins were found in a grave near it. The account he gives is in substance as follows. Upon FulweU Hills, near Monkwearmouth, within a measured mile of the sea, there are quarries of lime, which he rents of the proprietor. In the year 1759, he removed a ridge of limestone and rubbish, upon one of these quarries, which was about twenty-five yards in length from east to west, its perpendi cular height about a yard and a half, its breadth at the top was near six yards, and the sides were sloping like the ruins of a rampart. In the middle of this bank was found the skeleton of a human body, which measured nine feet six inches in length; the shin-bone measuring two feet three inches from the knee to the ankle; the head lay to the west, and was defended from the superin cumbent earth by four large flat stones, which the relater, a man of great probity, who was present when the skeleton was measured, and who himself took the teeth out of the jaw, saw removed. The coins were found on the south side of the skeleton, near the right hand.\"-f- * About a mile to the north-east of Monkwearmouth there is a subterraneous passage, facing the sea, called Monks' Cavern, or Spotty's Hole. \" This secret way, which most probably has been wrought by the monks, with a view of eluding their enemies in times of invasion or civil commotion, was some time ago partially explored by four of the inhabitants of Monkwearmouth. After they had advanced a little way from the entrance, they found the passage perfectly good, in general allowing them to walk upright, and entirely hewn out of the limestone rock, with which this place is surrounded. Having proceeded a consi derable distance in the direction of the scite of the monastry, without meeting with any considerable impe diment, they thought it prudent to return, on account of the danger of coming in contact with foul air, to which they might have been exposed by a further progress. \" The name of Spotty's Hole, by which this place is now generally distinguished, is derived from a fo reigner who, some years ago, having probably left some vessel in the harbour, took up his residence in this dreary abode- Being unable to speak the English language, his daily subsistence was gained among the farm-houses in the neighbourhood, where he endeavoured to make himself understood by means of signs, and was known by the name of Spotty, on account of the variegated spots on his upper garment. Having lived for some time in this subterraneous habitation, he suddenly disappeared, and was supposed either to have died suddenly, or, by advancing too far into the cavern, to have fallen a prey to foul air.\" \u2014 Garbutt's History of Sunderland, p. 89. The dread inspired by tlie mysterious Spotty is simply and naturaUy expressed in a local ballad, preserved in the collection of Sir C. Sharp. The following stanza is a specimen of this composition : \u2014 \" The poor auld AVives of the North side dis'nt knaw what to dee, For they cannot come to see their husbands when they come to the key, For they're fear'd o' their sells & their infants tee : O ! this Roguish fellow they call Spottee.\" + These coins, which are in a state of excellent preservation, are now in the possession of Mr. Alexander Kirkaldy, of Monkwearmouth. vol. i. 4 0"], [464, "326 EASINGTON AVARD.\u2014 N.

In Au\u00b0*ust, 1823, a human skull and some bones were dug up by the side of Fulwell Hill, and which was conjectured to be the remains of some one who had fallen here during the contests between the parliamentary and royal forces. A discovery of a more singular nature was made several years ago. In working the lime-stone quarries, a kind of square pit was opened, within which were deposited a quantity of stags' horns, cut into lengths of three or four inches, and resting amongst a deep-coloured substance most re sembling decayed animal matter. It is well known that the horns of deer have been discovered in several parts of Britain, on the scites of Roman temples, or spots dedicated to religious rites. A leasehold farm in Fulwell is attached to the Professorship of Poetry in the university of Ox ford, the gift of the Rev. Henry Birkhead, LL. D., of All Souls College, Oxford, the founder of that lecture, and a great part of whose estate consisted in a lease from the church of Durham. Southwick is a mile to the west of Monkwearmouth. The village, which stretches along the heights above the Wear, is extremely pleasant, and commands a fine view of the port and the German Ocean. It is inhabited by several respectable families. Here are also two earthenware manufacturies, three lime-burners, three ship-building yards, and a crown glass manufactory. John de Suthwick occurs at the beginning of the fourteenth century, after whose death the pro perty descended to the family of Hedworth. Soon after 1400, the Hedworths deserted Southwick for Harverton, on their marriage with the heir of Darcy ; but they retained their possessions here until 1630, when they sold this estate to George Grey, of Great Lumley, Gent., who soon after added a large leasehold tenement under the dean and chapter in Southwick, purchased of Philip Ebbats, Gent. This George Grey is thus described in the Diary of his great-grandson, George- Grey, of Southwick : \u2014 \" He was an active man, concerned in colliery's. 1639, He and Anthony Smith of Durham, carry'd to king and councell a petic'on, from the tenants of dean and chapter, complaining that the dean and chapter had encreased the fines of their tenants upon renewing their leases, contrary to a decree made in the court of York in the time of Queen Elizabeth. Dr. Balcanquall, then dean, complained of this petition ; and the council ordered George Grey and Anthony Smith to pay all the money which had been collected by the tenants for their expenses (which was 80'1) unto one of the clerks of the council, and committed them, March 10, 1639, to the Gatehouse, until they produced the names of all the tenants who subscribed the pe tic'on, and they continued prisoners till April 13, 1640, upon meeting of the parliament, and then discharged upon giving in the list, and had the 80'i repaid. He (George Grey) and Smith petitioned ye House of Commons complaining of these proceedings of the council. \" He (Seorge Grey) and Smith were required by the Gen. Lesley and commissioners for the Scottish army, to warn all the tenants of bishop, dean and chapter, &c. not to pay their rents to their landlords, but for use of the army. \" Aprill, 1630, 'George Grey bought the freehold estate at Southic for \u00a3650 of Ralph and Richard Hed worth of Chester-in-Street ; it was conveyed by feoffment, fine, and recovering. \" 1638, He bought his dean and chapter farm at Southwic, of Philip Ebutts. \" He was ingaged with Manby, chapman of AVhitburn, and others, in an invenc'on for boyling liquors and making salt, for which an act of parliament was obtained Nov. 1650, cap. 39; but it miscarryd, and he lost a great deal of money by it; he was imprisoned in the Fleet 1655, at the suit of Brisco, administrator of Bluday, upon a bond for \u00a3900, borrowed to carry on this invenc'on. \" He dyed, I believe, anno 1661.\" George Grey, son of the preceding, was born in 1617, an(l served in the parliamentary army.

He died 24th May, 177*2, aged 91, and was buried at St. Nicholas' church in Newcastle. He settled a part of his estate at Southwick on the marriage of his only son, George Grey, with Elizabeth Ogle, of Kirkley. George Grey, son of George and Elizabeth, sold a portion of the estate to his mother, who devised it to her daughter Elizabeth, Countess Grey. The other portion of the estate descended to the two daugh ters and coheirs of Major George Grey (last named), who sold their interest, about 1810, to John Stafford, Esq. In 1808, Elizabeth Countess Grey conveyed her part of Southwick to Thomas Brunton, Esq., for _P7000. Dr. Zachary Grey, the editor of Hudibras, was a younger son of George Grey, rector of Burniston. He was educated in Trinity Hall, Cambridge; was afterwards Fellow of St. John's, by which society he was presented to the rectory of Houghton- Conquest, near Ampthill, Bedfordshire, in 1722. Human bones, and sometimes entire skeletons, have been frequently discovered on Southwick Hills, half a mile north-west of the village, during the operation of removing the soil or clay, for the purpose of working the limestone. A few years ago, two or three skeletons were found near Mr. Brunton's quarry ; and, what is most remarkable, around each of the skulls, as they lay, was placed a circle of limpet shells (patella vulgata), as if for ornament. Perhaps some kind relative had thought his time well spent in bestowing this simple mark of attention on the bodies of his comrades, hastily interred far from their native home. About a quarter of a mile west of the bridge, and not far from the river, Messrs. Pemberton and Co. are winning a new colliery. The idea of obtaining coal under the magnesian limestone, at practicable mining depths, would, not long ago, have been treated with ridicule ; but the at tempt, in this instance, is likely to succeed, since a thin seam of excellent coal has been already discovered, so that the speedy success of the enterprizing owners is confidently anticipated. Hilton. Hilton Castle stands in a low, sequestered situation, on the north side of the river, three miles to the west of AVearmouth Bridge, on the old road to Newcastle. With the original form or extent of the castle we are unacquainted, it having undergone several considerable alterations. Its present form is that of an oblong square ; the central part is evidently the most ancient ; the wings are of modern construction ; its general appearance that of a fortified mansion. The centre of the west front consists of the great entrance and gateway, defended by square projecting turrets, crowned with hanging parapets, which cross the angles transversely, so as to make an aperture over each face of the square, for the purpose of annoying assailants. The centre is flanked by circular tur. rets, and the battlements of the ancient part ornamented with human figures. On this part are several shields of arms, but disposed so irregularly as to testify that this front did not first receive them. In the highest place are the royal arms, three fleur-de-lis quartering three lions passant ; * This curious Diary, with notes, is given in Surtees' Hist- of Durham, vol. ii. p. 14 to 17-"], [467, "SUNDERLAND, &c. 329 and beneath, in a confused manner, the arms of Graystoke, Lumley, Brabant, Percy, Ogle, Con yers, and others. On the turrets are several shields of arms, among which are those of Surtees and Bowes. The east front has an ancient tower in the centre, with a square projecting front without turrets : it is ornamented with the arms of the Hiltons without quarterings, the head of Moses the crest, above which is a large figure in relief of a stag at rest, collared and chained. There are two uniform wings of modern work, and an elegant portico in the centre, of the highest Gothic style. The interior consists of five stories. The rooms are chiefly small, the saloon being the only spacious apartment, and was once finely ornamented with representations of various kinds of fish and other figures. Several of the turrets are still crowned with human figures, some in gro tesque attitudes, others as combatants, &c. in the usual manner ; a custom, wdiich if it were not intended for mere ornament, was perhaps practised to deceive an approaching enemy, who could hardly tell, at some distance, whether the garrison were on the alert or not. The castle had for a considerable time been gradually approaching a state of ruin, when it was rendered not only habitable, but furnished in the first style of elegance, by the late Simon Temple, Esq. A great proportion of the gardens and pleasure grounds was cultivated and laid out in the most beautiful manner, and the chapel ornamented and again opened for public worship. But that gentleman unfortunately failing in his commercial speculations, before he had completed his intended improvements, the whole has now the appearance of being in an unfinished state. Tlie castle was afterwards the residence of Thomas AVade, Esq. ; but at present it is unoccupied. The origin of the ancient house of Hilton is lost in the obscurity of fable. It is said to have flourished so early as the time of Athelstan. However, Romanus de Hilton, in 1166, held three knights' fees of (indent feoffment, a territorial possession equal to what was held by the very first families of the country. In 1332 and 1335, Alexander de Hilton had summons to parliament, which was never repeated in any of his descendants. After a series of twenty descents, stretching through five centuries, the family was nearly ruined, by the improvident posthumous generosity of Henry Hilton, Esq., who appears to have been so much under the influence both of vanity and melancholy, as might, in these days of equitj/, have occasioned serious doubts as to the sanity of his disposing mind. This gentleman had, several vears before, on some disgust, deserted the seat of his ancestors, and lived in obscure retirement, first at the house of a remote kinsman at BiUinghurst in Sussex, and afterwards at Mitchel Grove, where he died. By will, dated 26th February, 1640-1, he devised the whole of his paternal estate for ninety-nine years, to the Lord Mayor and four senior Aldermen ofthe City of London, on trust, to pay, during the same term, =C24 yearly to each of thirty-eight several parishes or townships in Durham, Surrey, Sussex, Middlesex, and Newcastle on Tyne ; of?28 per annum to the mayor of Durham, and \u00a350 per annum to the vicar of Monkwearmouth ; he then leaves an annuity of \u00a3J100 to his next brother Robert Hilton, and to his heirs ; and \u00a350 per annum to his brother John Hilton, which last sum is to cease, if he succeed to the larger an nuity as heir of Robert : all the residue and increase of his rents he gives to the city of London, charoing them to bind out yearly five children of his own kindred to some honest trade ; and fur ther he desires them to raise _f4000 out of the rents, to remain in the city chamber during ninety nine years, and the interest to be applied in binding out orphan children born on the manors of Ford, Biddick, and Barmston. After the expiration of that term, he devises the whole of his estates, with the encreased vents and also the same _f?4000, to his heir-at-law, provided he be not vol. i. 4 P"], [468, "330 EASINGTON WARD\u2014 N. D. such an one as shall claim to be the issue of the testator's own body.* He then gives several lega cies to his servants, and to the family of Shelley of MitcheU Grove ; declares that he has -PSOOO on good bonds in London ; appoints the Lady Jane Shelley to be bis executrix, and desires burial in St. Paul's cathedral, \" under a fair tumbe like in fashion to the tumbe of Dr. Dunne,\" for which purpose he leaves _(?1000 to his executrix, who never complied with the injunction. \" Henry Hilton left a widow (not named in his will), who re-married Sir Thomas Smith, said to have been an active and intriguing man, of considerable influence during the Usurpation. Robert Hilton, the next brother to Henry, survived him only a few months, and he also left a widow, whose second husband, Sir Thomas Hallyman, obtained in compensation of her dower a life-estate in the manor of Ford. The will itself produced, as was most likely, litigations and chancery suits in abundance ; and under all these circumstances, the estate, or rather the shadow of the estate, vested in John Hilton, the seventh and sole surviving brother of Henry. The civil wars burst out in the same year, 1641, and John Hilton periled the reliques of his inheritance in the royal cause. Himself and his son bore the commissions of Colonel and of Captain in the Marquis of Newcastle's army. The estate of Hilton, placed exactly between the royal army and the Scots under Lesley, was plundered and wasted by both parties; and, on the final ruin of the royal cause, the Hiltons, included in the list of malignants, were totally disabled from struggling at law or equity, either with the rebel city of London, or with the two knights who had espoused the worse, then the better cause. The wonder is, that from such a state of things the family ever emerged at all; but the younger John Hilton (who succeeded to the claims of his father in 1658) seems to have possessed a share of prudence and quiet perseverance very unusual in a ruined Cavalier. The very litigations of Sir Thomas Smith with the City Chamber, though they tore the estate in pieces, whilst the heir starved, had eventually a favourable effect. The citizens of London, who derived very little direct advantage from the will of their singular benefactor, were wearied out with the contest; and, after the Restoration, an amicable decree was pronounced, by which the possession of the estates was restored to the heir, on condition that he should discharge all the particulars of the trust created by the will of Henry Hilton, should make regular payment of the several parochial charities, and satisfy the claims of the two dowagers. Under these sore incum brances Mr. Hilton took the management of his own property ; but the rents, wasted as the estate had been for twenty years, were totally inadequate to the charges ; and it was found necessary to reduce the whole of the payments one-third, in proportion to the actual state of the rent-roll, leav ing still a very sufficient burthen to exercise the prudence and patience of the family, both which useful qualities they seem to have possessed in a very exemplary degree. \" From this period the ancient Barons of Hilton, no longer distinguished by extended possessions or extraordinary influence, retreated, without degradation of blood or of honour, into the quiet ranks of private gentry. Three successive chiefs of Hilton were not more respected for their an- * This clause runs as follows : \u2014 \" Y' if anie p'son shall p'tend to be a child of my body begotten, w'ch I hope noe body will be soe impudent and shameless : I hereby, calling God and man to witness, y*- I have no child living of my body begotten, and if any such shall p'tend so to be, I hereby declaire he or she so doing to be a very imposture, and I hope noe body will undertake to doe such a shameless, dishonest, and impu dent act, and he or she soe declaring to be my child, I doe hereby utterly renounce and disclaim ym.\" Per haps this proviso, which is several times repeated in the will with jealous and almost insane precaution, points out one of those domestic subjects of disgust, which operating on a melancholy temperament, and brooded over in solitude, induced the Baron of Hilton to deprive his successors of their fair inheritance, and to leave the heir of his honourable blood and name, an annuitant dependant on the City Chamber of London."], [469, "SUNDERLAND, &c. 331 cient and undoubted descent, than for the prudent and unostentatious simplicity with which they supported the fallen fortunes of their house, without meanness, and without vain regret or mis placed pride. Their names do not even occur in the list of parliamentary representation ; and they received, rather than claimed, from the general courtesy of the country, the acknowledged rank of the first untitled gentry of the north, of noblesse without the peerage. The last baron, a man of mild and generous disposition, though of reserved habits, is still remembered with a min gled sentiment of personal respect and of that popular feeling, which even ill conduct can scarcely extinguish, towards the last representative of a long and honourable line, unstained by gross vice, and unsullied by dishonour.\"* John Hilton, Esq., who died 25th September, 1746, devised all his estates to his nephew, Sir Richard Musgrave, of Hayton Castle, Bart., on condition of assuming the name of Hilton only. Shortly after, the whole of the estates were sold in various parcels. Henry Hilton had, in 1618, alienated the great manor of Aldston Moor, which he had derived from the Ariponds and Staple tons, to Sir Francis Radcliff, ancestor of the Earls of Derwentwater. Hilton, Ford, Great Us worth, and Follonsby, the impropriate rectory of Monkwearmouth, and a leasehold estate there, were sold at the final dispersion of the property after the death of the last baron. Grindon, North Biddick, and Barmston, had been previously alienated. The Hiltons, at an early period, had possessed estates in Northumberland, rated at two knights' fees, derived from the heiress of Tyson. How the property in this county, in Yorkshire, and in Wiltshire, was disposed of, does not appear. binder the private act of parliament mentioned above, the castle and manor of Hilton were con tracted for by \u2014 Wogan, Esq., for -\u00a3\"30,000; but the sale was never completed, and they were af terwards sold to Mrs. Bowes, widow of George Bowes, Esq., of Streatlam and Gibside, whose great grandson, John Bowes, Esq. (son of the late Earl of Strathmore) is the present proprietor. The Bank-head part of Hilton estate was purchased by the Pembertons, but subsequently conveyed to Robert Reay, Esq., who built a neat mansion-house, called Hilton Place. Sir Richard Hilton, of Hayton, Bart., devisee of his uncle, John Hilton, Esq., married Eleanor, daughter and co-heir of John Hedworth, ofChester Deanery, Esq., M. P. ; and their daughter, Eleanor, married AVilliam Joliff'e, Esq., M. P., whose son, Hylton Joliff'e, Esq., M. P., is co-heir with Sir Wastell Brisco of the blood of Hilton. Catherine, fourth daughter of John Hilton, Esq., married John Brisco, of Crofton, D. D. ; and their son, Sir John Brisco, of Crofton, Bart., married Caroline-Alicia, daughter of G. F. Fleming, Esq. Their son, Sir Walter Brisco, Bart., born 177*8, thus became co-heir with Hylton Joliff'e, Esq., of the blood of Hilton. Many families stUl exist who claim alliance, more or less remote, with the ancient stock in Dur ham ; and probably the pretensions of some of them are well founded. Some obscure individuals have claimed the honours of the house, as heirs in the direct line. A pitman has lately drawn largely on the credulity of his neighbours; since then, a shoemaker in Sunderland avers that he is heir of the blood of Hilton.f * A series of short, round, companionable looking faces, on canvas, at Hilton, do not bely the family cha racter. The last baron, in a suit of blue and gold, still occupies the pannel above the fire-place in the deserted dining-room ; a fair, flaxen-haired, pleasant looking gentleman, with a mild composed countenance. \u2014 Surtees. t Mr. Surtees has appended numerous evidences to his pedigree of Hilton. The number of popular tra ditions connected with the Hiltons attest the high antiquity of the family. Sir C. Sharp, in his History of"], [470, "332 EASINGTON WARD\u2014 N. D. Hilton Chapel stands to the north of the slopes and terraces that rise to the north and east of the castle. The records relative to this little domestic establishment include the earliest au thentic evidences of the Hilton family. Romanus, the Knight of Hilton, made a convention with the prior and chapter of St. Cuthbert, relative to his chapel of Hilton, in 1157- Alexander, the successor of Romanus, in 1172 procured from the prior and convent of Durham an indenture, granting to the lords of Hilton for the time being, for themselves, their wives and children, free burial in the chapel of Hilton, or in the cemetery of the same; and Sir Robert de Hilton granted to the said prior and convent liberty to gather the tithes of Hilton, Reston, and Newton, and to carry them through any roads where the lords of Hilton and their tenants gathered and carried their corn and hay, without let or hindrance from any one. Sir Robert de Hilton, by another indenture, granted to the prior and convent of Durham one place in the vill of Hilton, for build ing a barn to lay their tithe in.* Hartlepool, relates a wild legendary tale of a raven that flew from the north, and, perching on a tower seated on the AVear, received the embraces of a Saxon lady, whom her father, a powerful Abthane, had there con fined to protect her from the approaches of a Danish nobleman ; by which may possibly be adumbrated the origin of the family, springing from a mixture of Danish and Saxon blood. \" Every castle, tower, or manor-house, has its visionary inhabitants. ' The cauld lad of Hilton' belongs to a very common and numerous class, the Brownie, or domestic spirit ; and seems to have possessed no very distinctive attributes. He was seldom seen, but was heard nightly by the servants who slept in tlie great hall. If the kitchen had been left in perfect order, they heard him amusing himself by breaking plates and dishes, hurling the pewter in all directions, and throwing every thing into confusion. If, on the contrary, the apartment had been left in disarray (a practice which the servants found it most prudent to adopt), the indefatigable goblin arranged every thing with the greatest precision. This poor esprit folet, whose pranks were at all times perfectly harmless, was at length banished from his haunts by the usual expedient of pre senting him with a suit of cloaths. A green cloak and hood were laid before the kitchen fire, r.nd the do mestics sat up watching at a prudent distance. At twelve o'clock, the sprite glided gently in, stood by the glowing embers, and surveyed the garments provided for him very attentively, tried them on, and seemed delighted with his appearance, frisking about for some time, and cutting several summersets and gambados, till, on hearing the first cock, he twitched his mantle tight about him, and disappeared with the usual valediction : \u2014 ' Here 's a cloke, and here 's a hood, The cauld lad o' Hilton will do no more good.' \" The genuine Brownie, however, is supposed to be, ab origine, an unerrbodied spirit ; but the boy of Hil ton has, with an admixture of English superstition, been identified with the apparition of an unfortunate domestic, whom one of the old chiefs of Hilton slew, at some very distant period, in a moment of wrath or intemperance. The baron had, it seems, on an important occasion, ordered his horse, which was not brought out so soon as he expected; he went to the stable, found the boy loitering, and, seizing a hay-fork, struck him, though not intentionally, a mortal blow. The story adds, that he covered his victim with straw till night, and then threw him into the pond, where the skeleton of a boy was (in confirmation of the tale) dis covered in the 1 .st baron's time.\" \u2014 Communicated by Mr. I. B, Taylor to R. Surtees, Esq. The armorial bearings of the Hiltons are not uniformly the same ; and it puzzles antiquaries to guess the origin of the strange crest \u2014 Moses's head, glorified or horned. Another crest appears at Hilton Castle \u2014 a stag with a golden chain. The title of Baron, bestowed on this house, might have been granted by the general courtesy of the county, or the Hiltons might have been Barons ofthe Bishopric, sitting with a sort of provincial peerage in the great council of their Ecclesiastical Palatine. That such an order existed is certain, from the evidences afforded by ancient charters and other episcopal documents. * Chaplains. \u2014 Thomas de Yolton, 1220. \u2014 AVilliam Harpyn, 1249, p. m.

In 1322, Robert, Baron of Hilton, granted to his chaplain, AVilliam de Hilton, the Passage of Bovis ferry (Ox-ferry), a toft and croft in Grindon, with one acre of land and a messuage and twenty- four acres, which Hutton Frer held in Hilton, in exchange for one chalder of wheat, which William used to receive out ofthe grange of Ford, and in exchange of an annual rent of sixteen shillings, which AVilliam received out of twelve acres in Grindon, and of four shiUings paid for the multure of the same twelve acres.

The botryoidal limestone, as well as the compact and thin laminated limestone, are found in great abundance: the latter sometimes exhibits the appearance of marine vegetable impressions. A still more curious specimen, perhaps peculiar to this situation, is found about the middle of the rock, and occurs in cones of distinct formation, much resembbng the top of a sugar-loaf: it is perforated on all sides with small holes, and when fractured longitudinally, presents a very beautiful appearance, much resembling the vertebrae of small animals. Rock milk is found in great plenty in fissures on the north side of the quarry. The whole of the limestone, when scraped or pounded, emits a sulphureous or urinous smell, indicating the presence of sul phurated hydrogen. * Bainbridge-Holme, supposed to be part of the ancient manor of Hameldon, lies to the south west of Wearmouth, and near the TunstaU Hills. It belonged to the Lumley family in 1405 ; and, in 1539, John Lord Lumley granted it to Nicholas Bainbrigg for life. The estate, in 1560, was sold to Thomas Whytehed, Gent. It was afterwards successively in possession of the Nat tresses, and the Shipperdsons. Robert Shipperdson, who died without issue in 1704, devised Bainbridge-Holme to his nephew, Michael Pemberton, and to Margaret and Barbara, sisters of the testator, as tenants in common. In 1715, Barbara sold the west moiety to John Pemberton, of Monkwearmouth, Gent., who afterwards purchased the remaining parts of the estate of the daughters and coheirs of Michael Pemberton. John Pemberton died in 1783 ; when his eldest surviving son, Stephen Pemberton, sti. D., became entitled to the seat-house and part of the lands, and Richard Pemberton of Barnes became possessed of the residue of the estate. Barnes, in 1370, was, with PaUion, included in the manor of Hamildon, which the Daldens of Dalden held by the fourth part of a knight's fee. Jordan de Dalden died without issue ; when Maud, his cousin, daughter of Robert de Dalden, intermarrying with Sir William Bowes of Streat lam, carried with her the large possessions of her family (Hamildon, Grindon, Clowcroft, Dalden, and half the manors of Seaham, Biddic-Watervile, and Hetton). Maud Lady Bowes of Dalden died in 1421, leaving Sir Robert Bowes, Knt., her son and heir, who was slain at Baugy Bridge in Anjou, on Easter-eve, 1421. From henceforth the manor continued in the family of Bowes in lineal descent, till the failure of male issue in Sir George Bowes of Dalden in 1556, whose three daughters became his heirs : 1. Elizabeth, wife of John Blakiston, of Blakiston, Esq.; 2. Dorothy, wife of Sir Cuthbert CoUingwood, of Eslington ; and 3. Anne, who intermarried with her cousin, * See page 272. Surtees, vol. i. p. 233. Wesley's Journal."], [473, "SUNDERLAND, &c. 335 Robert Bowes, of Aske. These heiresses divided the succession, and the manor of Hamildon fell, on the partition, to Anne Bowes. In 1571, Robert Bowes exchanged his manor of Hamildon with the crown for certain forfeited lands in Old Acres, Seaton, and Offerton.* In 1611, King James granted the manors of Hamildon, Clowcroft, and Grindon, to Thomas Emerson and Richard Cow dell, under a crown rent of _P83, 4s. 8d. ; and they immediately after conveyed to Ralph Bowes, Esq., son and heir of Robert Bowes. Mary, daughter and heiress of William Bowes, son of Ralph, about 1640 married AA?illiam Haddock, a common carrier between Newcastle and Sunderland. This Haddock, who was a very illiterate person, in 1668 sold the seat house and about one-half of the estate of John Jenkins, of London, Esq., and in 1673 alienated the remainder of the estate to Walter Ettrick, Esq. Low Barnes. \u2014 In 1708, the Jenkins family sold their moiety of Barnes to the AVardells of Sun derland, from whom it descended to John Chapman, of Whitby, by whose assignees it was con veyed, in 1783, to Richard Pemberton, Esq., the present proprietor. The house is handsome and commodious, and the grounds are kept in excellent order. Barnes with PaUion pay a modus of _P14, 13s. 4d. to the rector of Wearmouth, in lieu of all tithes whatsoever. Plomildon Hill consists of a considerable swell of limestone, containinir a com plete mass of organic remains, imbedded in a loose, granular, calcareous rock. High Barnes. \u2014 Walter Ettrick, Esq., descended from a good family in Dorsetshire, came into the north as Collector of the Port of Sunderland in 1661, and afterwards purchased High Barnes of the Haddocks. The estate has since continued in his descendants, and is now the property and residence of the Rev. William Ettrick. There is here a beautiful marble cenotaph, with the fol lowing inscription : \u2014 \" To the memory of William Ettrick, Esq.t Late of High-Barns in the County of Durham, And many years an active and upright magistrate in the said county, Who departed this life on the 22d of February, 1808, In the eighty-third year of his age : And by his last will caused this sepulchral monument to be erected To perpetuate the memory of his father William Ettrick, Esq.

The cession of Barnes to the crown was probably therefore nominal, and intended to cover the grant of the forfeited lands ; for both Robert Bowes and Ralph his son are repeatedly styled of Barnes after the exchange ; and either as tenants to the crown, or under some implied trust, held possession during the whole ofthe interval from 1571 to 1611.\" t Mr. Ettrick discharged his magisterial duties vvith great diligence and impartiality, and was therefore highly esteemed in Sunderland. The following anecdote is told of this gentleman : \u2014 One day, while riding through the town, he observed a crowd of people gazing upon a stranger, who, on enquiry, he found to be a prize-fighter. The humourous magistrate immediately sent him a challenge ; but when the boxer discovered who was his challenger, he, in a fright, prepared to leave the town. Mr. Ettrick, on returning home, again perceived a crowd, and, enquiring the cause, was told the pugilist was going off; when he exclaimed, \" Oh ! oh ! tell him from me he is a great coward ; I sent him a challenge, but he durst not accept it !\" X Anthony, brother to Walter, a gentleman of considerable talent and acquirements, was educated at Trinity College, Oxford, under the very worthy and very singular Dr. Kettle. \" In my time,\" says Aubrey,"], [474, "336 EASINGTON WARD.\u2014 N. D. This monument was executed in compliance with the will of the late Mr. Ettrick, who left a considerable sum to be expended on a family memorial, and himself suggested the inscription. It was executed by Blore, in Piccadilly, and cost, with the addition of a basement or pedestal by Jopling of Gateshead, upwards of \u00a3500. It was originally designed to occupy a place in Bishop wearmouth church ; but Blore had so far exceeded the dimensions given him, that the wall of the church, in consequence of its being modernized, would not contain it with any suitable effect; and the burial-place being in the west vestibule, it would soon also have been defaced by ill usage and exposure to the air. Under these circumstances, a cenotaph at Barnes was deemed the preferable expedient. Pallion lies on the AVear, two miles to the west of AVearmouth. The name is supposed to be a contraction of Pavilioji, the summer seat of the lords of Dalden, placed close to the brink of the river. The fishery, which seems to have been of some importance, assumed from its later lords the name of Bowes-water. On the extinction of the elder line of Bowes, the whole manor of Ha mildon fell to the share of Robert Bowes of Aske, who married his cousin Anne, the youngest daughter and coheir of Sir George Bowes of Dalden ; and, in 1572, the same Robert Bowes, Esq., for two hundred marks, granted to John Goodchilde of Ryhope \" the whole tenement and grounds called the Pallyon ; and one severall and free fishery in the river of Were, in or adjoyning the said Pallyon.\" The present Goodchilds of Pallion are descended from this founder of the family. The lime-works at Pallion are the most extensive on the Wear. In the quarries is found a vein of dark marble, capable of receiving a very fine polish. The ancient hall is the property and resi dence of Addison Fenwick, Esq. The south banks of the Wear, from AVearmouth Panns to Hilton Ferry, are covered with houses, manufactories, coal-staiths, and ship-building yards. Mr. Thomas Pemberton, at Ayre's Quay, has a large glass-bottle manufactory, near to which is another, belonging to the Ayre's Quay Bot tle Company. Mr. Hall's bottle works are at the bridge end. There is another glass-bottle ma nufactory at Deptford, and also one of flint glass. There are two ship-building yards at South Southwick, and many excellent vessels are built at Ayre's Quay and Deptford. At the latter place there is a saw-mill, a ropery, a copperas and paint manufactory, and a block and mast maker.

A chapel of ease was built at High Ford, and consecrated by the bishop of St. David's on February 15, 1821 : the living is a curacy, in the presentation of the rector of Bishopwearmouth. Low Ford is situated on the AVear, at Hilton Ferry, near to High Ford, four miles west of Sunder land, where there are two large ship-yards, copperas works, an earthenware manufactory, and a ferry for passengers, horses, carriages, &c, the profits of which belong to Capt. Thomas James Maling, R. N., who built and endowed the chapel of ease at High Ford. The township also contains seven farms, six shopkeepers, six inns and taverns, and several handsome and genteel dwelling houses. The manor of Ford, Grindon, and Clowcroft, belonged to the Hiltons from the earliest records, until the final sale of the Hilton property in 1750. The estate of Ford was sold in lots: the High Farm was purchased by AVilliam Scurfield and James Donnison for \u00a312,500; the Ferry-boat Farm and Low Ford Farm by George Longstaff' for .\u00a32700 ; and the New-hall Farm by Teasdale Mowbray, Esq., for \u00a3'3700.

Silksworth. \u2014 This township and hamlet lies near the south-western boundary of the parish, about four miles west from AVearmouth, and contains eleven farms with two corn-mills. The an cient lords of Horden were the earliest proprietors; but, in process of time, the convent of Durham obtained nearly the whole of the viU of Silksworth, and it was at last held by the Emildon family under a free rent of 13s. 4d. The heiress of Emildon carried the property into the Middleton fa mily of Belsay, from whom it descended to AVilliam Robinson, Esq , who has a handsome residence here called Silksworth Hall. The estate pays a yearly out-rent of \u00a36, 13s. 4d. to the Free Gram mar-school of Rivington in Lancashire. There was an ancient chapel at Silksworth, dedicated to St, Leonard ; but the date of its foundation or its removal are equally unknown. It was endowed with a small landed revenue, which was probably swept away amidst the last wreck of the abbey plunder. Grindon is a hamlet in Silksworth township, joining AVest Herrington and Offerton. The greater part of this estate passed from the Hiltons to the family of Watson, from whom a moiety descended to the Blakes, Thoralds, and Milbankes : the remainder is now the property of Anthony Hopper, Esq. Farnton-Hall, another hamlet adjoining Silksworth, was anciently parcel of the possessions of the monastry of Hexham. In 1610, the Hiltons, who possessed the estate, sold it to the Peppers of Cleasby, co. York, who, in 1720, conveyed it to John Cuthbert, of Newcastle, serjeant-at-law. The Cuthberts, in I76-I, sold the estate to James Donnison, of Sunderland, Gent., for \u00a36950. In 1777, James Donnison devised to the Rev. AVatson Stote, who, in 1801, conveyed the estate to the present owner, Anthony Hopper, of Silksworth, Esq, The Burdons are two villages on the southern verge of the parish, four miles south-by-west of Wearmouth. They are distinguished from each other as East and AVest Burdon, as Old Burdon and Towne Burdon, and, in Boldon Book and Hatfield's Survey, as Great and Little Burdon. This place gave name to an ancient family ; but they never passed the rank of yeomanry. In this township are eight farms, a public house, and a very elegant villa, called Tunstall Lodge, belong ing to George Robinson, Esq., of Hendon Lodge. vox. 1. 4 R"], [476, "338 EASINGTON AVARD \u2014 N. D. Ryhope is a delightful village near the coast, north of Burdon, three miles south of Wearmouth, and on the high road from that town to Stockton. \"The name,\" says Surtees, \"is perhaps de rived from its deep riven Dene. Tlie upper part of this little valley, which extends about two miles from the coast, expands into beautiful plots of pasturage, and as frequently closes into deep tangled brakes, admitting no other passage than the channel of its little rivulet. The lower part, east of the horse-road to Seaham, assumes a character of extreme wildness; the stream forces its way amidst shivered fragments of rock, or mines its passage at the foot of two beetling cliffs scooped below into dark caverns.\" King Athelstan's donation to St. Cuthbert included the two Ryhopes; but Boldon Book men tions only one village, which was occupied, together with Burdon, by twenty-two tenants in ville nage. The township is now divided into fifteen farms. Ryhope once gave name to a resident family. Here are five inns and public houses, two corn-mills, and a number of genteel houses, having lodgings for visitors during the bathing season. A neat and commodious chapel was built here in 1826, and one of the curates of Bishopwearmouth performs divine service in it every Sab bath day. Ryhope House is the residence of Edward Dale, Esq., whose family had property in Tunstall in 1680. Ryhope Bay affords a good sand and shelter for the bathing machines. In 1614, the bishop exercised his right here to \"wreck ofthe sea.\" Tunstall is a small township, situated under a lofty elevation, two miles to the south of Bishop wearmouth. The high and wild ridge of limestone, which forms the most remarkable feature in this district, terminates in two round, depressed summits, called Maiden Paps, from which there is an interesting view of the coast from Tynemouth to Hartlepool. The eastern ascent of the TunstaU Hills is tame and gradual ; but the western side sinks rapidly into a deep and romantic gill. In 1814, some workmen discovered, on the northern side of the southern peak, about six feet from the base, a rude sepulchre, formed of common limestones, and covered with the same materials. On the floor were deposited the fragments of three urns, of very rude and inelegant form, ornamented with zigzag; and all of them containing a rich dark mould, in which were in terspersed small fragments of bone, and some human teeth.* A Roman celt was found here in 1805. All the lands in this constablery are held by lease under the bishop of Durham. Many handsome seats have arisen in the parish of Bishopwearmouth, besides those mentioned ; as Thornhill, built by the late John ThornhiU, Esq. ; the Grange, the property of R. AVebster, Esq. ; Building Hill, belonging to John Renner, Esq. ; and Hendon House, lately occupied by the Hon. Capt. Coehrane. * Dr. Clanny, in a letter to Mr. Surtees, states that the \" pit, which was about four feet square, and three feet from the surface, had been formed by large pieces of limestone ; and upon the bottom of this pit or grave the urns were found. A common piece of limestone, without letters or sculpture, formed the roof. Two of the urns were much broken by the falling in of the earth ; the third is in such a perfect state as to shew its complete figure and ornaments. All three had been filled vvith a rich dark mould, which had a very earthy smell, containing some pieces of human bones, which had been submitted to a very strong heat. One of the Molares was found in a very perfect state. The urns are apparently Saxon, from the mode in which they have been placed in the earth, their zig-zag or herring-bone ornaments, and their rude construc tion : they are composed of fire-clay, in which large pieces of silex occur. An idea has prevailed, that all Saxon urns have been heated by the sun's rays only ; but a piece of one of the Tunstall urns has been sub mitted to a stronger heat than is commonly used in the potter's kilns on the Wear, without undergoing any change.\""], [477, "HOUGHTON-LE-SPRING. 339 THE PARISH OF HOUGHTON-LE-SPRING. The extensive and populous parish of Houghton-le-Spring is bounded by Bishopwearmouth on the north-east, by Dalton-le-Dale and Seaham on the east, by the river AVear on the north, by Chester-le-Street on the west, St. Giles's parish on the south-west, Pittington and Easington on the south, and Easington on the south-east.

Houghton-le-Spring Is a small but handsome market-town, delightfully situated at the head of a fine vale opening to wards the west, and sheltered from the north and east by the hills of Houghton and AVarden Law. It is 65 miles north-east of Durham. In old records it is generally called Houghton in the Spring ; a name supposed to be derived from the abundance of fine springs which every where burst from the limestone rock. Part of the town stands upon the high road between Durham and Sunderland ; but the extension of buildings has been so rapid, that the population has been more than tripled during the last thirty years. Many of the buildings are large and handsome. The Church. The church, which is a large, venerable fabric, stands at the west end of the town, on a rising and spacious burial-ground, skirted by rows of ancient sycamores. It is in the form of a cross, with a square central tower springing from four arches, at the intersection of the transepts and nave. A porch, now used as a vestry, projects from the chancel parallel with the south transept. Two regular aisles are formed by four clustered pillars on each side of the nave, and open into the transepts under low pointed arches. A lofty pointed arch divides the nave from the chancel. The east window is divided by plain mullions into five lights, under a pointed arch ornamented with tracery. The chancel has two other windows, one divided into three, the other into four lights, under flat arches. Several old narrow lights, with quatrefoil heads, are built up in the transepts The o-reat west window is of handsome work, divided into five lights, under an arch ornamented with tracery worked in quatrefoils ; but its effect is lost, from the erection of a modern gaUery and organ-loft. The chancel is forty-eight feet long, and twenty feet broad ; and the nave is ninety three feet long, and, including the aisles, forty-six feet broad. The whole structure was repaired a few years ago.* * There were, in former ages, two Guilds instituted in this church ; one dedicated to the Holy Trinity, and the other to the Blessed Virgin.

The Rectory stands to the west of the church and of the village, and was a venerable embattled building, flanked by Davenport's Chapel on the east, by an old tower on the west, and surrounded by a curtain wall. Henry Keling, rector in 1483, obtained leave \" to enclose, fortify, and em battle a tower above the lower porch within his manse. Such fortified parsonages were common near the Borders. The rectory-house, as it now stands, was built by Davenport, whose arms and date, 1664, are still remaining over the west window of the dining-room. The present rector removed the tower and the chapel, altered and enlarged the house, laid out the pleasure-grounds, and threw down part of the old wall, to open a view over the rich, warm grounds to the south. The rector is generally entitled to great and small tithe throughout the parish ; but no terrier bas ever been delivered into the ecclesiastical court. The glebe is extensive and valuable. The living is rated in the King's Books the highest of any in England.

West Rainton School. \u2014 The yearly sum of \u00a310 for a school here is charged upon some estate belonging to tlie Marquis of Londonderry, whose agent pays it to a master for instructing ten children in reading, writing, and accounts. A school-room, where these children attend, was lately built by subscription, and by donations 'from different charitable institutions. Bagshaw's Charily. \u2014 The Rev. Henry Bagshaw, D. D., bequeathed by will, dated 10th November, 1708, the Broadmeadows and Slipperthorn closes to Ralph Gowland and Robert Chilton, directing that these trustees should, out ofthe rents ofthe said closes, pay yearly \u00a33 to the principal schoolmaster of Houghton, and 40s. to the usher, and 40s. yearly to stir. Davenport's part of the hospital, and the overplus above the said \u00a3-7 he directed should, after the death of Robert Chapman, be yearly distributed at Christmas to the poor of Houghton ; and he directed that when either of the said trustees should die, the survivor should surrender the said two closes to the use of the then rector of Houghton, and the governors of the school and hospital there. It does not appear that any surrender of this property has been made since the death of the testator. The premises consist of two closes in the township and manor of Houghton, containing about 10 acres, let to John Hall, as yearly tenant, at a fair yearly rent of A'28 ; after payment of the several sums charged thereon by the donor, amounting to \u00a37 per annum, and 15s- 4 Id. for the lord's rent and land-tax, the remainder, being about \u00a318, 10s-, is distributed in bread to the poor resident in the township of Hough-"], [484, "344 EASINGTON WARD.\u2014 N.

Sir George Wheeler's Charily \u2014 Sir George AVheeler, Knight, D. D., by his will, bearing date 23d May, 1719, bequeathed to Posthumus Smith, Robert Hutton, Ralph Ironside, and Thomas Robinson, \u00a3600 in trust, to lay out the same in the purchase of land, and out of the rents to pay \u00a310 yearly to the school mistress of the charity-school at Houghton, \u00a32, 10s. yearly to the usher of the free-school at Houghton, provided he should teach the charity children every Thursday afternoon writing and arithmetic, \u00a310 yearly for buying clothes for the 12 charity female children belonging to the township of Houghton only, and \u00a32, 10s. yearly for repairing the Gate-house, where the charity-school was then kept, or providing another place, if necessary ; and he directed that the remainder of the rents should be applied in providing books, pens, ink, and paper, and materials for sewing, knitting, &c. ; and he directed that the schoolmistress should teach 20 female children, viz. 12 out of the township of Houghton, 4 out of the township of Newbottle, and 4 out of the township of East Rainton, such schoolmistress and the scholars to be chosen by the rector of Hough ton and his successors, and the said trustees and their respective heirs; and that they should order such rules to be observed by the schoolmistress as they should think fit, and should have full power to displace the said schoolmistress and scholars as they should see occasion. The sum of \u00a3600 is supposed to have been laid out in the purchase of certain copyhold premises held of the manor of Houghton, and situate in the township of Houghton, and to have been surrendered to the trustees originally appointed, of whom Thomas Robinson was the survivor. No subsequent surrender ap pears to have been made, and the Rev. Edward South Thurlow, the rector, acts as the sole trustee. On these pr> mises a school has been built, with a dwelling-house for the schoolmistress. There are also two other cottages, which, with the land, containing 16 a. 3 r. 27 P-, are let to George Livingstone, at a fair rent of \u00a380 per annum. Out of this rent the following payments are made : \u2014 \u00a3. s. d.

At the time of the Commissioners' Inquiry, Mr. Thurlow had in his hands a balance of \u00a390, 17s- Id., which he informed them would be soon required for some repairs at the cottages, and for fencing one of the closes. The income of the charity seeming sufficient to provide for the education of a greater number of children, stir. Thurlow expressed his intention of increas ing the number as soon as the repairs above mentioned should be completed. Frankcleyn's Charity. \u2014 The mayor of Newcastle, under the will of John Frankeleyn, transmits to the churchwardens of Houghton \u00a31, 6s. 8d., which is paid to the poor, William Carr's Charity. \u2014 William Carr, as stated in the will of the Rev. Bernard Gilpin, bearing data 17th October, 1582, gave out of his lands in Cocken a rent of five marks yearly, whereof 40s. was assigned to be bestowed upon the school, or upon the scholars of the school, and the other four nobles were appointed to be bestowed yearly upon the poor of Houghton parish. The agent ofthe estate at Cocken, now belon\"* ing to Ralph Carr, Esq., pays the yearly sum of \u00a32 to the master of the free grammar-school, and \u00a31, 6s. 8d. yearly to the churchwardens of Houghton, for the benefit of the poor. The last-mentioned sum is given away, vvith other charity-money, on New Year's day, as hereafter mentioned. Charities of Dame Isabella Carr and Others. \u2014 Dame Isabella Carr, by her will, bearing date 7th Marchv 1721, gaye \u00a360, the interest thereof to be distributed yearly at Christmas to the poor of Houghton-le-Sprinf and Cocken. Among other documents belonging to the charities in the possession of the rector, there is a memorandum signed by Ralph Carr, Esq., Dr. Secker, the then rector, and other persons, bearing date 26th March, 1727, stating that it was agreed that the annual interest of \u00a340, part of Lady Carr's legacy of \u00a360, should be distributed yearly to the poor of the township of Houghton ; and the annual interest of \u00a320, the remainder thereof, to the poor of Cocken, by the direction of Ralph Carr, Esq., and his heirs, and the said, Ralph Carr thereby acknowledged the receipt of the said \u00a320, the interest whereof was to be distributed a?."], [485, "HOUGHTON-LE-SPRING. 345 aforesaid. The sum of \u00a340, with the amount of other benefactions, the origin of which could not be ascer- tained by the commissioners, is probably comprised in a sum of \u00a3200 lent out on security of the tolls of the turnpike-road from Durham to Sunderland. Interest is paid on this sum at five per cent., and the amount is added to the produce of other charities, and divided at a vestry-meeting amongst the overseers of the dif- ferent townships of the parish, except Cocken, in proportion to the population. Tbe sum paid to each over- seer is distributed by them to their respective poor, and they are required to produce an account of the distribution the following year. With respect to the sum of \u00a320, which was paid to Ralph Carr, Esq., for the poor of Cocken, nothing appears to have been paid to the poor specifically as the interest of this money for many years. Tempest's Charity, \u2014 John Tempest, Esq., by his will, bearing date 1st April, 1794, gave to Sir John Eden, William Henry Lambton. Esq., and Henry Vane, Esq., their executors, &c- such a sum of money as should be sufficient to purchase in their names \u00a31200 three per cent, consols, upon trust, to pay the divi- dends yearly in such proportions as they should think fit, to the widows of six pitmen, for their lives, whose husbands should have been usually employed as pitmen in the time of the testator's father or his own time, working the Penshaw and Rainton collieries, such six widows to be nominated by the trustees in writing, to be deposited in the parish-chest of Houghton-le-Spring; and he directed that when one widow should die, another such widow as aforesaid should be appointed ; and in case the said collieries should cease to be worked, so that there t-hould be no such widows to be nominated, that the trustees should nominate six widows whom they should think fit objects of charity, and pay them the dividends in like manner ; and lie directed that when one ofthe trustees should die, or refuse or decline to act. the survivors should nominate, in writing, another trustee to act with them, so that there should be always three trustees. The sum of \u00a31200 three per cent, consols is now standing in the names of Robert Eden Duncombe Shafto, Thomas Dunn, deceased, and John George Lambton, Esq. (now Lord Durham). The dividends, amounting to \u00a336 a year, are remitted half-yearly to Mr. John Dunn, of Durham, and divided by him amongst six poor per sons, widows of persons who have worked in the Penshaw and Rainton collieries. The widows are appointed by the colliery agents of the Marquis of Londonderry, who married the great niece of the testator, and thereby became possessed of the collieries above mentioned- Kepyer School. The foundation charter of this school is dated April 2, 1574, and appoints John Heath, of Kepyer, Esq., and Bernard Gilpin,* rector of Houghton, the first governors of \" the free Grammar- School and Alms-House of Kepyer, in Houghton in the Spring, in the County of Durham,\" with power as such to plead and be impleaded ; to nominate, and, if requisite, to correct, suspend, or expel the master ; to make, revise, and from time to time alter, the school statutes ; and to acquire lands not exceeding \u00a350 per annum, to the use of the same school and alms-house. The appoint ment of the governors was reserved to Heath and Gilpin during their lives ; and was afterwards vested, where it still continues, in the heir of blood of John Heath, Esq., and in the rector of Houohton for the time being ; and in case of neglect, the nomination, pro hoc vice, lapsed to the bishop. Mr. Gilpin,f during his life, directed the whole administration of the school personally. After his death, a set of statutes bears the signature of Richard Bellasis, governor ; but these regulations * John Heath, the friend of Bernard Gilpin, was a native of London, and sometime AVarden of the Fleet. He had purchased the whole dissolved hospital of Kepyer, out of which this school was partly endowed, and from which it therefore derived its name. Gilpin, in a letter to Maister John Hethe, points out the mode of paying a schoolmaster more than twenty years, and adds, \" By y' time I trust ye laste daye woulde sollowe shorthe, ther be so many tokens to declare y' it is at hand.\" + Bernard Gilpin, the Apostle of the North, was born in 1517, at Kentmire in AAfestmoreland, of an ho nourable family. From his earliest youth he was thoughtful, reserved, and serious. At the age of sixteen, he was removed from a public grammar-school, and entered at Queen's College, Oxford. Here he studied 4, T vni.. i. * -\u00bb VOL. I."], [486, "346 EASINGTON WARD\u2014 N. D. have now become obsolete. \" In one instance,\" says Surtees, \" be it remarked (without any re flection either on the present most respectable master or governors, who only tread in the path chalked out by their predecessors) that the spirit of the founder's intention has certainly been de- the writings of Erasmus, logic, and the philosophy of the schools ; to which he added a complete knowledge of Greek and Hebrew. Having taken the degree of Master of Arts, he was elected a fellow of his college ; and on the erection of Christ CoUege, Cardinal AVolsey nominated him one of the first students on the foundation. At this time, Gilpin was prevailed upon to dispute publicly against Hooper, bishop of AVorcester, and against Peter Martyr, but with such evident uprightness of intention, candour, and sincerity, as to extort praise and admiration even from his opponents. This controversy led him into long, patient, and secret investigations, which terminated in his conversion to the doctrines of the Reformation, which he ever after maintained at the hazard of every worldly prospect, and of life itself. Gilpin continued to pursue his studies at college until the thirty-fifth year of his age ; when Cuthbert Tunstall, bishop of Durham, his mother's uncle, had him appointed to preach before King Edward VI., and prevailed upon him to accept the vicarage of Norton, in the diocese of Durham. Still he entertained doubts on certain matters of faith ; when Tunstall advised him to travel, but to keep his living, which Gilpin po sitively refused to do. \" Father's soule !\" exclaimed the bishop, \" Gilpin, thou wilt die a beggar.\" On the continent Gilpin passed some time at Lovaine, at Antwerp, and at Paris, conversing with the most learned and eminent men in those parts. After spending three years abroad, he returned to England in 1556, while the church \" was oppressed with blood and fire.\" Tunstall immediately gave him the archdeaconry of Durham, to which the rectory of Easington was annexed. Here he was indefatigable in preaching against the manners of the clergy, and the vices and corruptions of the times. He was therefore opposed by a for midable combination, and thirteen charges of heresy were drawn up against him ; but Tunstall, who was much practised in the world, easily found a safe method of dismissing the accusation. However, the malice of the clergy continued so active, that Gilpin begged permission to resign either the archdeaconry or tlie parish ; but Tunstall replied, \" I found them combined, and combined I will leave them.\" On which, Gilpin resigned both of them. Shortly after, Gilpin was removed to the great rectory of Houghton, which he thankfully accepted, and which not even the offer of a mitre could ever after tempt him to desert. He was also offered a stall in the cathedral church of Durham ; but this he refused, saving that he had already more wealth than he was afraid he should give a good account of- Still he was followed with accusations of heresy ; but the liberal and beneficent Tunstall constantly defended him. Yet so far did his enemies, by their perpetual complaints, prevail, that the bishop struck his name out of his last will \u2014 a worldly loss which Gilpin never regretted. At last he was accused before Bonner, bishop of London, who gave order to a messenger for his apprehen sion; and now, \"perceiving the reliefe which hee had found in Tunstall's clemency would fade him. he prepared his holy soule for martyrdome ; commanding AVilliam Airy, the steward of his house, to provide him a long garment, that he might go the more comely to the stake.\" Meanwhile, when he was journevinn as he believed to the stake, the sudden death of Queen Mary freed him from all danger ; and, had he been willing to make the common and permitted use of reputation, ability, and interest, the road lay open before him to the highest honours and emoluments of the church. His kind uncle had no longer the power to befriend him : though not averse to many of the principles of the Reformation, he declined, at his a<*e, a^ain changing his profession, and was deprived of his bishopric, and sent into an easy and honourable confinement with Archbishop Parker at Lambeth. But Gilpin no longer needed that friendly shelter vvhich had so often protected him from the storm. The Earl of Bedford, one of the most powerful and most virtuous noblemen of the court, became his unsolicited patron : and on the death of Lewis Oglethorpe, that nrelate, who crowned Elizabeth, asked and obtained the vacant bishopric of Carlisle for Gilpin. But, for whatever rea son, he steadily but respectfully persisted in refusing the mitre, and determined to abide by that lot vvhich had already fallen to him. In the following year, he refused the provostship of Queen's College in Oxford. AVhen Gilpin became rector of Houghton, he found the parish miserably cultivated, the people ignorant and vicious, and the parsonage-house decayed and uninhabitable. But the latter soon assumed the appear ance of a bishop's palace, where hospitality and economy went hand in hand. To the poor arid the stranger his doors were always open. He entertained his parishioners not only at Christmas, but he kepFa table for them every Sunday from Michaelmas to Easter, entertaining, according to the custom of the age, the <*en try, the yeomen, and the poorer classes at separate tables. \" In his own house he boorded and kept foure and twenty scollers, sometimes fewer, but seldome ; the greater part poore men's sonnes, upon whom he"], [487, "HOUGHTON-LE-SPRING. 347 parted from ; for, though no express mention be made of any provision for poor scholars in the charter of foundation, and though the sums appointed for that purpose in the statutes of 1658 be now most inadequate to the object, yet it cannot be doubted that Gilpin, according to his own bestowed meat, drinke, and cloth, and education ; and in the building, ordering, and establishing of his school, and in providing yearely stipends for a schoolemaster and an usher, he expended the full sum of five hundred pounds ;\" a sum, it may be added, exceeding by one-fifth the annual value ofthe rectory. Mr. Gilpin was deeply grieved to perceive the desolate and neglected state of the northern church. The wild and lawless regions of Tynedale and Redesdale particularly attracted his attention ; and, \" once a yeere, it was his custom to make a journey amongst them ; for which purpose he would usually take the opportu- nity of Christmas holidayes, when, in respect of frost and snow, other men were loath to travels. That time hee liked best, because then there came many holy dayes together, and the people would more 11 'Un- assemble \u2014 whereas, at other times, they neither would come together so easily, nor so often. Being *-<>me- times benighted before hee was well aware, and forced to lodge in the snow all night, in this extremity he commanded AVill. Airy, who for the most part attended upon him, to trot the horses up and downe, and neither to permit them nor himselfe to stand still; whiles he himselfe in the mean while did bestirre him- selfe, sometimes running, sometimes walking, as not able to stand still for cold.\" Amongst this rude and barbarous people, \" he was esteemed a very prophet, and little lesse than adored\" by them. It happened, \"that whiles Master Gilpin preacht amongst them, a certaine goodfellov had stolne away Master Gilpin's horses ; upon the missing whereof there is hue and cry raised through the country, that Master Gilpin's horses were stolne, and must bee searched for with all possible diliu'ence. The fellow who had stolne them, so soone as he heard that they were Master Gilpin's horses (for he knew not whose they were when he tooke them away), was in greate feare and trembling. The theft did not much trouble his conscience ; but, when hee heard the name of Master Gilpin, it cast him into trouble and distraction of heart. Therefore, with all the speed he could, hee brought backe Master Gilpin's horses, and humbly craved the pardon and benediction of Father Gilpin ; and protested, that after it came to his knowledge that they were Master Gilpin's horses, he was afraid to be thrust down quick into heU if hee should doe him any wrong.\" \" Upon a time when Master Gilpin was in these parts, at a towne called Rothbury, there was a deadly feud amongst some of them who were wont to resort to that church. If the faction of the one side did, perhaps, come to the church, the other side kept away, because they were not accustomed to meete together without bloodshed. Now so it was, that when Master Gilpin was in the pulpit, both parties came to church in presence of Mr. Gilpin ; and both of them stood, the one of them in the upper part of the church or chancell, the other in the body thereof, armed with sword and javelins in their hands. Mr. Gilpin, some- what moved with this unaccustomed spectacle, goeth on neverthelesse in his sermon: and now a second time their weapons make a clashing sound, and the one side drew nearer to tlie other, so that they were in danger to fall to blowes in the middest of the church. Hereupon Master Gilpin commeth downe from the pulpit, and stepping to the ringleaders of either faction, first of all he appeased the tumult; next, hee la- boureth to establish peace betwixt them, but he could not prevaile in that, onely they promised to keepe the peace unbroken so long as Master Gilpin should remaine in the church. Master Gilpin, seeing he could not utterly extinguish the hatred vvhich was now inveterate betwixt them, desired them that yet they would forbeare hostility so long as hee should remaine in those quarters: and this they consented unto; and so Master Gilpin ascended the pulpit again, and spent the rest of the allotted time in disgracing that barbarous and bloody custome of theirs, and if it were possible in the utter banishing of it for ever. And so often as Mr. Gilpin came into those parts afterwards, if any man stood in feare of a deadly foe, hee resorted usually where Master Gilpin was, supposing himselfe more safe in his company than if he went with a guard.\" Once, on entering a church in these parts, Mr. Gilpin perceived a glove hanged up as a challenge to an enemy ; on which he took it down, and sharply rebuked the people for these inhuman challenges, persuading them, at the same time, to live in peace and charity with each other. At the end of his sermons he distri buted money amongst the poor. He also visited the prisons, and often procured pardon for those condemned to die. Lord Burleigh, on returning from Scotland, visited Mr. Gilpin at Houghton, where he was entertained \" with all respects, and due rites of hospitality.\" \" When the Lord Cecill had well observed Master Gilpin, and had approved the extraordinary courtesie of the man, and had tooke notice of such diligence and abun dance of all things, with so compleat service in the entertainment of so great a stranger and so unlooked-for -a guest, being now ready to depart, hee spake on this wise \u2014 Hee had heard much, by the report of others."], [488, "EASINGTON AVARD.\u2014 N.

At present, none are admitted ; and the mas ter is presumed to be at liberty to fix his own terms of admission and education, which have never been more than sufficient to keep pace with the times.\" touching Master Gilpin ; but what hee now had seene and tryed, was much more then that hee had formerly heard ; ' therefore, (said he,) if you have any occasion or suite at court, or before the councell, I pray you to make use of me as a mediatour for you ;' and when returning towards Durham he came to Rainton Hill, reflecting his eye on the whole champion country which hee had now passed, hee, looked backe very ear- nestly, both upon Master Gilpin's house, and the situation thereof: ' I doe not blame this man (saith he) for refusing a bishopricke, for what doth hee want that a bishopricke could more enrich him withall ? besides that he is free from the great waight of cares-' \" Previous to the rebellion of the Earls of Northumberland and Westmoreland, Mr. Gilpin withdrew to Oxford. \"During the time that the rebels had possession of Durham, some of them flew out as farre as Houghton : there they found Master Gilpin's barnes full of corn, young cattell, and many things provided for hospitality ; but they make waste of all, selling the corne, &c. and basely making havocke of all things which Master Gilpin had provided for pious and honest uses. There was among them one follow whom Master Gilpin had sometime saved from the gallowes ; and this knave was the wickedest of all the rest in rioting away Master Gilpin's goods. Now after the rebels were dispersed, and proceedings made against the simple people somewhat more sharpely than was fitting, Master Gilpin begged the lives of many by his intercession ; for he knew well enough that many men were drawne into the snare, not wilfully, but through ignorance, and the fraudulent practises of others. And now, the whole trouble over, Master Gilpin returned to his accustomed studies and endeavours of charity.\" Bishop Barnes, listening to evil counsellors, ordered stir. Gilpin to preach at the visitation, just when he was preparing to go amongst the Borderers ; but he refused to neglect his perilous duty. Those who had prejudiced the bishop's mind against Gilpin were his spiritual chancellor, John Barnes, and Gilpin's ungrate- ful scholar, the learned but inconstant Hugh Broughton ; and he immediately suspended him from all his ecclesiastical functions. \" Gilpin, returning home, finds himselfe suspended ; yet he took it patiently. The bishop, having notice that Master Gilpin was returned home, sendeth unto him instantly, warning him to meete him and the rest ofthe clergy at Chester, whom he found assembled in the church. 'Master Gilpin, (saith the bishop) I must have you preach to-day.' Gilpin pleaded, that he was not provided with a sermon and his suspension. ' But I can free you (saith the bishop) from that suspension, and doe now free you ; and wee know that you are never unprovided, for you have now gotten such an habite of preaching, that you are able to performe it, even upon the sodaine.' Master Gilpin reniayned immoovable, answering that God was not so to be tempted ; and that it was well with him if he were able to performe anything in this kinde upon mature deliberation. ' Well then, (replyed the bishop) I commande you, upon your canonicall obedience, to goe up into the pulpit-' Master Gilpin, delaying the time yet a little while, answered, ' AA'ell, sir, seeing it can bee no otherwise, your lordship's will be done;' and after a little pause began his sermon. He observed his enemies taking notes of all he spoke, yot he proceeded without fear or hesitation ; and when his discourse gradually led him to the reprehension of vice, he boldly and openly reproved the enormities which the bishop permitted in the diocese. A murmur ran through the assembly. Gilpin's enemies trusted that his ruin was sealed : his friends trembled ; and when he descended from the pulpit, crowded about him in tears. ' You have put a sword into your enemies' hands to slay you with ! If the bishop were before offended without a cause, what may you expect now ? ' God (answered Gilpin) over-ruleth all : so that the truth may be propagated, and God glorified, God's will be done concerning me.' The clergy dined with the bishop; and Gilpin's friends and enemies silently waited the event. Gilpin came to take his leave of the bishop, and to returne homewards. ' It shall not be so (answered the bishop) ; for I will bring you to your house.' And when they were now come to Master Gilpin's parsonage, and walked within into the parlour, the bishop upon a sudden caught stir. Gilpin by the hand- ' Father Gilpin, (said he) I do. acknowledge yon are fitter to be bishop of Durham than myselfe to be parson of this church of yours. I aske forgivenesse for errors past ; forgive me, father. I knowe you have hatched some chickens that now seeke to pecke out your eyes ; but so long as I shall live bishop of Durham, be secure \u2014 n\u00ab. one shall hurt you.' All good men rejoiced, and Gilpin reaped in peace and security the fruit of a pious life in all plentifull manner.\" Mean while age began to grow upon him. \" After his leane body was quite worne out with diversity of paines taking, at the last even feeling beforehand the approach of death, he commanded the poore to be called together, unto whom he made a speech, and tooke his leave of them.

Being full of faith unfained and of good vvorkes, he was at the last put into his grave as a heap of wheat in due time swept into the garner.\" stir. Gilpin educated at Kepyer many scholars who afterwards became highly eminent. The following are amongst the most distinguished : \u2014 George Carleton, the biographer of his venerable kinsman and patron, and from whose works the above memoir is principally compiled, was descended from a good family in Cumberland ; born at Norham Castle, of which his father was governor; educated at Kepyer, and at Edmund Hall; Fellow of Merton in 1580; in 1617, bishop of Landaff; and, next year, one of the four English divines who attended the Synod of Dort. In 1619, he was translated to the see of Chichester ; and died, aged 69, in 1628, leaving the charac- ter of an excellent divine, as well as a polite scholar, and not ill versed in antiquities ; vigilant, and clear from every imputation, in his public offices; and in private life modest, friendly, and affectionate. His Life of Gilpin was originally written in Latin: \"Vita Bernardi Gilpini, viri sanctissimi, famaque apud Anglos Aquilonares celeberrimi.\" It was soon translated, and, before 1636, had attained a fourth edition. He was the author of a Latin epistle to Camden, containing some observations on his \" Britannia ;\" and of several printed sermons and polemical tracts; and of a performance intituled \" Astrologimania,\" pointed chiefly against Heydon's \" Defence of Judicial Astrology.\" Hugh Broughton, the learned, but ungrateful, was the best Hebrew scholar of his age, and skilled in all the learning and traditions ofthe Rabbins. He was entirely educated by Gilpin, who met with him a poor boy, running by his horse's side in one of his journeys near the borders of Wales, brought him vvith his pa- rents' consent to Houghton, cloathed and maintained him, and afterwards provided for his support at Queen's College; yet he afterwards, from a vanity and inconstancy of temper, rather perhaps than from any peculiar malice or design, lent himself as an instrument to Gilpin's enemies, and joined with Barnes, the worthless chancellor of Durham, in accusing his venerable patron of irregularities against the discipline ofthe Church of England; and engaged in that plot, which ended so notably in Gilpin's triumph, and the discomfiture of his enemies. A list of Broughton's works, and his controversy with Beza, may be seen in any Biographical Dictionary. It may be collected from his style, that his judgment by no means equalled his learning. He was suspected of leaning towards the Church of Rome ; but is said to have refused the temptation of a car- dinal's hat, and to have died at last (August 4, 1612) in obscurity and distress. Henry Ayray (Gilpin's sister's son), provost of Queen's College in Oxford, where he was held in just esteem for his learning, and the blameless purity of his life. Lastly, may be mentioned Ralph Ironside, one of Gilpin's scholars, provided for in his will, rector of Long Bredy, co. Dorset, and father and grandfather of two Gilbert Ironsides, successively bishops of Bristol, and the latter of Hereford. Beside the many learned and virtuous men who owed their education to Gilpin's foundation, Houghton can boast of many pastors on whom a portion of the Northern Apostle's spirit had descended. The follow- ing merit peculiar notice : \u2014 George Davenport, a native of Wigston in Leicestershire, where he had some paternal estate. His first introduction into the diocese of Durham was as chaplain to Bishop Cosin after the Restoration ; and he resided for some years in the bishop's family without any other preferment than his chaplaincy, vvith vvhich he united the office of librarian.

AVhilst his years seemed yet to promise longer life, he was suddenly seized vvith a mortal disorder, and, after a few days of illness, was carried to the grave the 8th of July, 1677, amidst the unaffected tears of his parishioners. Sir George Wheler, D. D-, who succeeded the pious and charitable Dr. Bagshaw in the rectory of Houghton le-Spring, was descended from an ancient family of gentry who had been possessed of property in the coun ties of Kent and Middlesex : his father, Col. Charles AVheler of the Guards, suffered for his loyalty to King Charles I., and Sir George was born whilst his parents were on that account in exile at Breda in HoUand. In 1667, he became a member of Lincoln College in Oxford ; but before he had taken a degree, he went abroad with Dr. James Spon of Lyons, and embarking at Arenice, sailed to Constantinople, and travelled through Lesser Asia and Greece. On his return, he received the honour of knighthood, and, in 1683, the degree of A. M. from the university of Oxford. He published an account of his travels, and of several an tiquities in Greece and Asia Minor, in 1682, and presented several pieces of antiquity which he had collected to the university : his valuable casket of Greek medals he afterwards gave by will to the Dean and Chapter Library of Durham. About 1683, Sir George entered into holy orders, contrary to the wishes of several powerful friends, who would willingly have supported his interest at court ; but his resolution was immove able. In 1684, Sir George was collated by Bishop Crewe to the second stall in Durham cathedral; and, in 1708, being then vicar of Basingstoke in Hants, was promoted by the same patron to the rectory of Hough ton-le-Spring. Lord Crewe's political opinions are weU known ; and Sir George participated probably, in some degree, in the sentiments of his patron, who believed in the divine right of hereditary succession, &c. It is said that attempts were made to bring Sir George into danger and disgrace for some unguarded ex pressions of attachment to the Stuart race ; but his character saved him from such accusations. AVith a spirit worthy of the successor of Bernard Gilpin, Sir George AA'heler bequeathed all the arrears vvhich should be due at the time of his death from his spiritual promotions, to charitable purposes within the parish of Houghton-le-Spring. In 1693, he had erected, principally at his own expense, though assisted by a stir. Seymer of Lombard Street, a chapel for his tenants in Spitalfields ; and his will intimates an intention of giving up this chapel to the French Protestants, and of establishing an alms-house for his decayed tenants there : but neither of these designs was executed. He gave \u00a350 by will to the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge, and an exhibition of \u00a310 a year for ever \" to a poor scholar that shall be of Lincoln College, Oxford, and bred up at the grammar-school of Wye in Kent.\" Few men ever more happily united the dignified manners and sentiments of birth and rank with the venerable simplicity and modesty of the Christian pastor, than Sir George AVheler. He died at Durham.. January 18, 1723, and was buried in the Galilee of Durham cathedral, where a handsome monument is erected to his memory by his only surviving son, Granville AVheler. John Rotheram, A. M., was the second of three sons of the Rev. AVilliam Rotheram, master ofthe free grammar-school of Haydon Bridge in Northumberland. He was born at Haydon Bridge, June 22, 1725, and, after being educated under his father, became a member of Queen's College in Oxford in 1745, where he was distinguished for his acquirements in mathematics. In 1749, he took the degree of B. A., and en tered into holy orders ; after vvhich he became tutor to the two sons of the Hon. Mr. Frere, on the island of Barbadoes : but he afterwards accepted the office of an assistant in Codrington College. During his stay on this island, he wrote \" The Force of the Argument for the Truth of Christianity drawn from a collective"], [491, "HOUGHTON-LE-SPRING. 351 \u00a3. s. d.

The succession of masters, as far as can be collected, stands as follows : \u2014 Robert Copperthwaite, Clerk, A. B., appointed on the foundation. Christopher Ranson occurs in Bernard Gilpin's will, 1582.* View of the Prophecy,\" and his \" Sketch of the one great Argument,\" which last production procured for him, in his absence, the degree of A. M. from the university of Oxford, in 1753. In 1757, he quitted Bar badoes; and, on his arrival in England, accepted the curacy of Tottenham in Middlesex. In 1759, he pub lished \"An Apology for the Athanasian Creed;\" and, in 1760, preached a sermon before the university of Oxford, of which he was presented with a fellowship. In 1766 appeared his most admired work, \"An Essay on Faith ;\" soon after which, Trevor, bishop of Durham, appointed him one of his domestic chaplains, and collated him to the living of Ryton. In about three years after, he was removed to the valuable rectory of Houghton-le-Spring, where his kindness, hospitalities, and charities, did honour to his profession. His other published works are, \" An Essay on the Distinction between the Soul and Body of Man ;\" a sermon on the death of his patron, the bishop of Durham ; a sermon on the AVisdom of Divine Providence ; another preached for the benefit of the Newcastle Infirmary ; and one on the Influence of Religion on Human Laws, an assize sermon, for vvhich he received the thanks of Lord Mansfield. AVhile on a visit at Bambrough Cas tle, being a trustee of Lord Crewe's charity, he was struck with the dead palsy, and died July 16, 1789, aged 64. His remains were conveyed to Houghton. His compositions are distinguished by elegance and simplicity of language, close and acute reasoning, and clear and methodical arrangement. * The Rev. George Swallowed is said to have been, at one time, master here. This man fell a victim to those atrocious doctrines which too generally prevailed in that age of ignorance and bigotry, and vvhich taught that it was just and holy to coerce the human mind.

Four of the established clergy attended him, and endeavoured to bring him over, and his life was to be spared; but with no effect. After he was turned off, and had hung awhile, they cut the rope and let him fall ; and the hangman drew him along by the rope, yet alwe, and there dismembered and bowelled him, and cast his bowels into the fire. Then the hangman cut off his head, and held it up, saying, ' Behold the head of a traitor.' His quarters, after they were boiled in the caldron, were buried in a dunghill.

After the Restoration, George Lilburne of Offerton, one of the governors of Kepyer School, built the north wing of the hospital, and endowed it with \u00a3\"10 per annum, issuing out of freehold tenements in Sunderland, for the maintenance of three poor persons; and George Davenport, rector of Houghton, added the south wing, and not having lived to complete the endowment, left i?160 to the governors of Kepyer School to purchase lands, or a yearly rent-charge of \u00a3*10 per annum, for the maintenance of three poor persons, to be chosen out of the poor inhabitants of the parish by the governors, with the advice of the rector.

Here are three chapels belonging to the Dissenters, viz. the Methodist chapel in Robinson Street, the Presbyterian chapel in Newbottle Lane, and the Baptist chapel in Sunderland Street. A small congregation of Ranters meet in a room. In the year 1825, a weekly market was established here, to be held every Friday ; but although the parish be rich and populous, yet it does not flourish, being too contiguous to the old markets of Durham and Sunderland. Here are four breweries, and twenty-two hotels, inns, and taverns. Petty Sessions are held at the AVhite Lion on alternate Thursdays. Old Houghton, which opens out at the east end of the church, is an airy and spacious place; but New Houghton, which was lately built, exhibits the most irregular, crowded, and awkward appearance. It is chiefly inhabited by colliers engaged in the neighbouring coal-works. The most remarkable building in Houghton-le-Spring is the Old Hall House, which was the mansion-house of the Hutton family. \" Its external structure is an oblong square, the corres ponding sides exactly uniform, and the chief front to the west equally plain with the rest, without facade, or ornamented doorway. The windows are regular, divided into five, or into three lights by stone mullions ; and the leads are surrounded by a plain pediment. The mansion has under gone little either of repair or alteration ; and, as it has been built with a massy solidity, calculated to resist the injuries of time and neglect, it presents, perhaps, at this day, one of the most perfect specimens extant of the plain durable style of architecture, which distinguished the residence of the middling gentry in the age of James or Elizabeth.\" From several architectural indications, it would seem to have been built by Robert Hutton, the rector of Houghton, some time between the years 1589 and 1623. It is certain that he acquired a very considerable property in the manor of Houghton by purchase from different individuals.* The house is at present occupied by Mr. Ralph Anderson. On the south side of the old part of the town is a field (parcel of the glebe of the rectory) called the Court or Kirk Lee, where it is supposed a church or religious house formerly stood. Many coins, carved stones, and other vestiges of antiquity have been dug up in it ; but there are no records to shew the nature of the establishment which once existed there. Some years ago, a large oak tree, upwards of 60 feet long, and a cartload of nuts, were dug up at AVardenlaw Hill ; and several human skeletons, together with bones and horns of deer, were found in the sand-hole at the half-way-house between Houghton and Newbottle. * Robert Hutton, Esq., grandson of the Rev. R- Hutton, bore a captain's commission of a troop of horse guards in Cromwell's army. He served in Scotland, and was with Monk at the storming and plunder of Dundee; and, according to village tradition, he built the family mansion-house with the plunder obtained on this occasion. But the building itself affords strong evidence of an earlier date. After the Restoration, Captain Hutton remained zealously attached to the Puritans ; vvhich may probably account for his being buried in his own orchard, where an altar-tomb (now broken) still bears the following inscription : \u2014 HIC IACET ROBERTVS HVTTCN ARMIGER.

The Bishop's Manor. \u2014 Houghton is one of the great manors of the see of Durham ; and includes Burdon, Tunstall, Ryhope, the Herringtons East and AVest, Newbottle, AVardon, and Bishop wearmouth. The Copyhold Court is held twice in every year by the bishop of Durham's Senes chal, or his deputy, who sits in the school-room, and tries petty causes of debt or assault under 40s. value. It appears from the ancient court-rolls, that the rector of Houghton held lands called Court Close, on condition of providing a dinner twice in the year for the Seneschal, his clerk, and servants. Thomas Asteley, Clerk, rector of Houghton, took one close near the rectory, then di vided into three, to hold for term of life, if he so long continued rector of Houghton, paying to the bishop 33s. 4d. ; and to the greeve 3s. 4d., to provide grass and hay for the horses of the Se neschal, and his clerk and servants, at the time of holding the Halmot. In 1453, the Seneschal fined WiUiam Carr, and eighteen other laymen, for keeping greyhounds and lurchers, contrary to the statute, the offenders not being owners of 40s. a year in land ; and for killing six hares in Hou<i:hton common field. The following account of property in Houghton appears in Boldon Book : \u2014 \" In Houghton are thirteen cottagers, whose tenures, works, and payments, are like those of Newbotill ; and three other half cottagers, who also work like the three half cottagers of Newbotill. Henry the greeve holds two oxgangs of 24 acres for his service. The smith holds 12 acres for his service. The carpenter holds a toft and four acres for his service. The punder has 20 acres, and the thraves of Houghton, Wardon, and Morton : he renders 60 hens and 300 eggs. The mills of Newbotill and Bedic, with half of Raynton mill, pay xv marks. The demesne, consisting of four carucates, and the sheep, and sheep-pasture, are in the hands of the lord.\" There is no mention of any free land in this survey. Hatfield's Survey shews the gradual conversion of the servile tenures into monied rents, and the manner in which distant parts of this great manor began to be emancipated. At the present time, there are probably not above 40 acres of freehold iu this township. This parcel of land descended for some time in the family of Rutter, and became, by intermarriage, vested in the Ironsides, who are themselves by much the most ancient resident family in Houghton, deriving their property and descent from John Ironside, who took lands by copy of court roll within this manor in 1497- This family has given two prelates to the see of Bristol : Gilbert, the elder, son of Ralph Ironside of Houo-hton, consecrated 1660, and died 1671 ; and Gilbert Ironside, son of the former, conse crated 1689, translated to Hereford 1691, and died 1701. Another junior line were lately consi derable merchants in London. The late AA'illiam Ironside of Houghton-le-Spring, Esq., held the property originally granted to his ancestor, John Ironside, within the manor of Houghton, in 1497. He had issue one son and nine daughters. The estate is at present under the management of a steward."], [496, "356 EASINGTON WARD.\u2014 N. D. The Nesham family long possessed a considerable estate in Houghton and Newbottle; and John-Douthwaite Nesham, Esq., had a handsome mansion-house in the former place. The Chil tons, an ancient family, held property in Houghton at least as early as the time of Henry VIIL, and in Newbottle much earlier. The last heir male, Richard Chilton, Gent., who married a daughter of Ralph Lambton of Lambton, Esq., was killed in a duel in his own orchard. The dry limestone pastures of Houghton Hill and other parts in the neighbourhood,* and the fine springs which supply the town with the \" pure beverage of nature,\" have given the place a deserved character of healthiness. Instances of longevity are frequent. In February, 1766, a woman named Hewitson died here at the great age of 116. She enjoyed good health and retained the use of her faculties to the very last period of her long life. Chilton Moor is a hamlet one mile west of Houghton town, inhabited by persons employed in the various mining departments. Colliery Row is another adjoining hamlet in Houghton township, of a similar kind, as its name imports, and where there is a public house and a Wesleyan chapel. Dean House, Field House, Moore's Farm, and Houghton Hill Mill, are all in this township. Newbottle, In Saxon New Dwelling, is a considerable village, in a lofty, exposed situation, above a mile to the north of Houghton. The ancient servile tenure of lands in Newbottle is described in Boldon Book. \" In Newbotill are 16 cottagers, each of whom holds 12 acres, and performs two days' works in every week (for the lord) throughout the year; and cultivates four portions of land in autumn with all his family except the huswife; and renders one hen and five eggs. And three other cottagers hold each six acres, and work, from Pentecost to the feast of St. Martin, two days in every week. John the son of Henry holds a toft and 12 acres for 12d. rent, in exchange for the land vvhich he formerly used to hold in Herington. The headborough holds 12 acres for his service. The smith 12 acres for his service. The punder 12 acres, and receives a thrave of corn from every carucate of land in Newbotill, Bedic, and Heryngton ; and renders 40 hens, and 300 eggs. \u2014 The demesne, consisting of four carucates of land, with the sheep and pasture, are in the hands of the bishop.\" Under Hatfield's Survey, \" Hugh de Boynton holds 13 acres of land and one rood of demesne land, and renders 9d. for every acre. John Wilkynson and fourteen other tenants hold 312 acres of the same demesne-lands, and render as above.\" The bond-lands were generally paid for in money. Subsequent records afford no instance of any tenure in chief, or by knight's service, in Newbottle ; and the whole township is at this day held under the bishop of Durham, either by leases for lives or years, or by copy of court-roll under the manor of Houghton. A division of the town-fields of Newbottle within the manor of Houghton-le-Spring was made in 1691 : the award bears date 29th September. Lands called the Hall Moor and Dobmire Moor were divided. The tenants all claimed as leaseholders or copyholders under the bishop of Durham, who received _P10 for his interest or consent to the division. The families of Wilson, Watson, Chilton, and Byers, were the principal claimants. * One of the finest animals of the improved breed of Durham short-horns was bred by J. D. Nesham, Esq., late of Houghton-le-Spring. This famous white ox weighed 223 stone of 14 lb., and measured from tail to pole 8 feet 8 inches."], [497, "HOUGHTON-LE-SPRING. 357 Newbottle is a wide, airy, and pleasant viUage, which contains many genteel houses. Several convenient cottages have been lately built at the south end. Here is an extensive and old-esta blished pottery, carried on by Messrs. Fairbarn and Co., a corn steam-mill, six or seven inns and taverns, and three day-schools. On the north side of the village there is a neat house, occupied by the relict of the late AViUiam AUan, Esq. The view, at night, from the west part of the viUage is peculiarly grand and striking, as the whole surrounding country seems in a blaze from the im mense fires burning at the mouths of the numerous pits. The whole township contains fifteen farms, and two corn-mills, one of which is at Sedgelitch. The Newbottle collieries are now carried on with great spirit by Lord Durham, who, in 1819, purchased them of the Nesham family for the sum of _f70,000. Many dreadful accidents have occurred in these coal-works. On June 2, 1815, the Success pit fired, when the subterraneous blast passed down the ways, destroying all that encountered its fury, until it was impeded and broken, as it is termed, by a large waggon, which it dashed to pieces, and mangled the driver and horse in a most shocking manner. After the torrent had passed by them, the men left the work ings in hopes of effecting their escape ; but few, alas ! were able to reach the shaft, and even some of those, overpowered by styth at the very moment they hoped to have escaped, fell to rise no more ! The first person that reached the surface was a little boy, six years of age. By this acci dent 57 valuable lives and six horses were lost. About ten weeks afterwards, Newbottle colliery was again the scene of a tragic event, at the first trial of an ingenious locomotive machine, called the iron horse, intended to draw 20 waggons. A number of persons had assembled to witness its powers; when the brakesman, anxious to gratify the spectators, charged the boiler so strongly that it burst, and the poor fellow was dashed to pieces: another man was cut in two by the frag ments of the boiler, a little boy was thrown a great distance and killed, and about 50 others (of whom some died) were most severely scalded and wounded. On the 8th of December, in the same year, as four of the workmen were employed on a stage 70 fathoms down the shaft of Nesham's Main colliery, repairing the masonry, one of them came to bank to get something wanted : while talking to the banksman, and incautiously passing along a plank, he fell down upon the stage he had a few minutes before left ; and so great was the force he acquired in his fall, that three beams, 6 inches by 4, which supported the stage, were broken by the shock, and the poor feUovv, with his three companions, were precipitated to the bottom (55 fathoms further) and all dashed to pieces. Another serious accident happened in one of the Newbottle pits on October 19, 1821, when a cur rent of choak-damp killed several of the workmen.* Philadelphia Row, a hamlet, stands a little to the north of Newbottle, below the brow of the hill. Like most other pit villages, it consists of long, uniform lines of low brick buildings, running along each side of the public road, black with coal-dust. A boarded pig-sty generally stands near the entrance of each dwelling, and across the public pathway an oven, devoted to the use of seve ral families. There is a public house and a good school-room. Bunker Hill, another hamlet in Newbottle township, near Houghton-le-Spring, contains some good houses, inhabited by different directors and superintendents of the adjoining coal-works. * On Sunday night, May 16, 1819, John King murdered James Hamilton in the cabin of Newbottle col liery staith. The murderer was apprehended, tried, and convicted. He was executed at Durham on the 16'bh of August following. vol. i, 4 Y"], [498, "358 EASINGTON WARD.\u2014 N. D. The Herringtons. East and Middle Herrington lie about two miles north-east from Houghton, and form but one viUage, being only divided from each other by the road. Bishop Flambert granted the Herring ton estates to AArilliam son of Ranulf, the bishop's nephew, but whom Surtees suspects to be one of the prelate's natural sons. The successors of AVilliam adopted the local name of Herrington ; and William de Herrington, in the time of Bishop Beke, granted East Herrington to Roger de Esh, from which period the eastern and western manors may be considered as perfectly distinct. East Herrington. \u2014 Boldon Book : \" Two parts of Herrington, which Hugh Plermas holds, pay twenty shillings for cornage, and provide two parts of one milch-cow, and two parts of one man for castle-ward ; and render eight chalders of malt, and the like of meal, and of oats ; and plough and harrow four acres (of the lord's land) at Newbotill ; and work with their men (for the lord) in autumn. The drenge feeds a dog and a horse as far as is incumbent on two parts of the drengage. About 1313, Roger de Esh, Chivaler, died seized of this manor; and it was held by the Esh family until the failure of male issue in 1530, when Anthony Esh died, leaving two daughters, Elizabeth and Margaret. Elizabeth became the wife of Richard Norton; and Margaret intermarried with William Smyth of Nunstainton, who was attainted in the Northern Rebellion in 1569. By settlement, or otherwise, Margaret became possessed of the whole manors of Esh and East Herrington, which descended at her death, in the 12th year of King James, to her eldest son, George Smythe, Esq. By indenture, 7 Sept. 1621, George Smythe, Esq., settled his manors of Esh and East Herrington on trustees \u2014 Sir Thomas Savage, Knt. and Baronet, and Sir Thomas l.idell, Knt. In 1644, the estates of George Smythe, Esq., a loyalist and a recusant, were sequestered by the Parliamentary Commissioners. Edward Smythe of Eshe, Esq., and of Acton in Shropshire, was created a baronet on the Restoration. His descendant, Sir Edward Smythe, Bart., sold the manor of East Herrington, in 1786, to General John Lambton of Lambton.* Middle Herrington. \u2014 John de Denum, in 1328, died seized of land in East Herrington, held of Roger de Esh by fealty and service at the lord's mill ; of a messuage and 14 acres in Middle Her rington, held of Roger de Esh in drengage ; and of other lands held of the lord of West Herring ton by fealty and service at the west mill. The record proves that, as early as 1328, the eastern and western manors were distinct estates, each possessing the manorial appendage of a lord's mill; * In the night of August 28, 1815, the house of Miss Smith (now Lady Peat), at this place, was set on fire, after being robbed. The fire was discovered about two o'clock in the morning ; when the body of Isa bella Young, a servant, and the only person in the house at the time, was found in the passage, quite dead, her head having been severely fractured. At the assizes held on the 13th of August in the following year, John Eden, James AVolf, and George AVolf his son, were put upon their trial for burglary, arson, and mur der; and, after a trial which lasted nine hours, a verdict of guilty was given against John Eden and James AArolf, who were left for execution. Some remarkable circumstances appearing to be connected vvith the case, some benevolent and active members of the Society of Friends undertook to investigate the affair ; when an alibi was established, proving, by numerous affidavits, that James Wolf was one hundred miles from Herrington when the crimes had been committed ! He therefore received a free pardon from the king, and was liberated. Pursuing their enquiries, these gentlemen further discovered that John Eden had also been falsely sworn to by James Lincoln, a seaman of Sunderland, probably to obtain the reward offered. Eden was, of course, pardoned and set free ; and, at the summer assizes held at Durham August 4, 1820, James Lincoln was tried, and, upon the clearest evidence, found guilty of wilful and corrupt perjury."], [499, "HOUGHTON-LE-SPRING. 359 Slid that portions of land in Middle Herrington were held with each. The cultivation around all villages must have been very gradual ; and it seems sufficiently probable that, at this early period, a part of what is now considered as Middle Herrington lay in waste betwixt the eastern and west ern manor. The tenure of the former was servile till gradually converted into a monied payment ; but the western manor appears, from the date of the earliest record, to have been held by military service ; whilst in Middle Herrington (which is never mentioned as an integral manor) a variety of properties and tenures has always existed. A considerable portion of the property in Middle Herrington is held by copy of court-roll under the see of Durham. Ralph Robinson, Esq., sold the chief mansion in Middle Herrington to WiUiam Beckwith of Thurcroft in Yorkshire, Esq. ; and the Hayning to John and Thomas Cooke of Streatthorpe, co. York, Esquires. The Robin sons held lands in Herrington as early as the commencement of copyhold records, temp. Edward III. West Herrington. \u2014 In 1326, John de Denum died seized of the Wodehale in AVest Herrington, with one carucate of land, and five acres of woodland, held of the bishop by homage and fealty ; and of one messuage and six acres in AVest Herrington, held of John Darcyr, Knight, by homage, fealty, and suit at West Herrington mill. On the death of Robert Darcy, in 1414, the estate was left amongst his four sisters and coheirs. The freeholders, in 1682, were John Lamb, Esq., Ro bert Ayton, Gent., John Nicholson, M. D., and John Richardson. The family of Smith had ac quired two-thirds of the manor ; one moiety, it seems, was sold to Lamb, and the other to Dr. Nicholson. The latter is supposed to be the portion since alienated to Mrs. Mary Lambton of Biddic. The Lambs conveyed their part of the manor to tbe Cuthberts of Witton Castle, who sold it to the Rowes, of whom it was purchased by Ralph Lambton, Esq., and is now the property of his great nephew, Lord Durham. West Herrington Chapel. \u2014 In 1273, Sir Thomas de Herrington granted his manor of HoughaU (Hochale) to the church of St. Cuthbert ; and in return for the donation, Richard Hoton, prior of Durham, and his convent, agreed, by their charter, dated ... Feb. 1291, to institute two perpetual chantries in the church of Durham, at the altar of St. John Evangelist under the high cross, and at the altar of St. Cuthbert; and to provide for ever two perpetual chaplains to celebrate mass; the one in the chapel of Herverton (Harraton), and the other in the chapel of West Herrington, for the good estate of Sir Thomas de Herrington, his parents Robert and MatUda, and his wives Amice and Osanna. In 1414, Bishop Langley issued a commission, directed to Ralph Stele, his official, and AVilliam Tart, canon of Darlington, to hear and terminate a dispute which existed \"between John Newton, rector of Houghton, and Robert Darcy, Esquire, and others his parishion ers, who asserted in their bill of complaint, that it was incumbent on the rector to provide two sufficient priests for the service of the parish, of whom one ought to officiate in the chapel of the Blessed Mary of West Herrington, and celebrate mass there three days in every week. The dis pute was compromised by the rector's undertaking, pure et sponte sua, and with a full salvo of his own rio-ht, and the right of his church, to provide a second chaplain, who should celebrate mass twice or thrice in the week, si ad hoc dispositus fuerit, in the said chapel of West Herrington. The chapel, of which no vestiges remain, probably did not survive the dissolution of the chantries , and its loss as a chapel of ease must have been felt in the eastern district of this extensive parish, till a new influx of population from the collieries occasioned the erection of that of Penshaw. AVest Herrington contains several excellent freestone and limestone quarries. Herrington Burn MiU, belono-ino- to Mr. Nathaniel Edwards, stands in a pleasant spot, and has undergone some"], [500, "360 EASINGTON AVARD.\u2014 N. D. judicious improvements. Cox Green, a busy hamlet on the Wear, five miles west of Sunderland, contains an iron foundry and five public houses. Offerton. Offerton, or Higher Town, is a small village at the north-eastern extremity of the parish, which commands an extensive view of the vale of the Wear. This was one of the villages which Athel stan gave to the see of Durham, as an appendage to the delightful village of South A\\rearmouth. The Denums held lands here at an early period, and from whom it seems to have passed into the family of Strother. Two-thirds of the manor, in the reign of Henry IV., was vested by marriage in the families of Fenwick and of Loreyne. The latter part is now the property of Lord Durham. Fenwick's share of the manor passed to the Lilburnes, and is now in possession of Lord London derry. Another part, after the Northern Rebelbon in 1569, came into the Middleton family, from whom it descended to Richard AA:harton, Esq., who sold to Simon Temple, Esq., and by whom it was again conveyed to Mrs. Mary Lambton of Biddick, niece of Francis Middleton, Esq. Mr. John Dawson of Biddic is the present owner, under the devise of Mrs. Lambton. Offerton HaU is now the residence of stir. T. Elliott. Here are copperas works, and three public houses, one of which is an ancient mansion-house. Penshaw. Penshaw, or Pencher, adjoins Offerton on the west. It derives its name from the British Pen, a head or hill, and the Saxon Shaw, a wood or thicket. Thus, Penshaw was the wooded hill. and is mentioned three centuries after the Conquest. Even so late as 1617, the Pen still retained its covering of native oak, some traces of which still remain. From the top of the eminence the spectator enjoys an extensive and noble prospect, comprehending many of the chief objects in the eastern part of the county, the most considerable of the neighbouring invaluable coal- works, with Durham and Chester towards tlie south and west. The village lies at the western base of the lofty bill, three miles north-by-east of Houghton-le- Spring. At an early age, it was held by the Daldens, except a portion called Bernewell, which was held immediately under the see of Durham. In 1426, Robert Karlele was found to hold \"the manor of Bernewell, the mill, and mill-pond, on a rivulet, called EUyngburne, near Heryng ton, under the name of two hundred and seventy-four acres and a half of land lying next to Be dykfields, of cultivated land, by homage, fealty, and the service of providing one man with two greyhounds, to attend tlie bishop's great chace, and \u00a34 to the exchequer; and the manor is worth nothing beyond the service. He holds the vill of Pencher of the heirs of Jordan de Escowland, together with the services of the free tenants, and 20s. rent from free tenements, except three mes suages, 8.C, which Alice de Karlele, mother of the same Robert, holds in dower for term of life.\" Joan, the daughter and heir of John Carlele,* and who died in 1188, carried the manor by mar riage into the family of Thirkeld, and from them to the Amcoats.

Tlie sum of \u00a3600 was sub scribed, and \u00a3\"400 was received from Queen Anne's Bounty. The chapel is a plain, convenient building, to which a cemetery was added in 1756.

The chapelry embraces within its ecclesiastical jurisdiction, in addition to Penshaw, the town ships of Burn-moor, Offerton, and South Biddic. There is also a Methodist chapel at this place. There are five farmsteads, two schools, and three public houses in Penshaw, or Old Penshaw. An adjoining hamlet is called New Penshaw, and is mostly occupied by persons engaged in the coal-works. Penshaw Cottage and Penshaw Lowhouse are good houses. Penshaw Foundry, belonging to Watkin and Elliott, is conveniently situated for the adjoining collieries. Low Lamb ton is a hamlet on the Wear, where Lord Durham has coal-staiths. Penshaw Staiths is another hamlet upon the bank of the river, where the Marquis of Londonderry and AVilliam Russell, Esq., have also coal-staiths, and where there are four public houses. Shiney Row is a pit village in Penshaw township, two miles west-by-north of Houghton-le- Spring, where are several mechanics and shop-keepers, a corn mill, four public houses, a Methodist chapel, a free school, and a subscription library. The school was endowed with \u00a315 per annum by the late Sir Henry A'ane, for the education of ten boys belonging to the pitmen employed in his colliery. Cox Green is partly in Penshaw township. This township abounds with excellent lime, fire, and freestone. Fire-stones are sent from hence to all parts of the kingdom, and to many foreign countries. In 1827, two ashlar stones were raised here weighing 13 tons each. South Biddick This village and township, in the chapelry of Penshaw, is situated on the AVear, four miles north-east-by-east of Chester-le-Street. It was anciently called Bedyke, probably from the Saxon, being surrounded by a dyke or foss. Supposing the present mansion to stand on the scite of the ancient Bedyk, the whole spot could have been easily insulated by a trench communicating with the AVear, and from which circumstance it may have received the name of Biddic- Waterville, which it bears in some old records. The ancient tenure of South Biddick was in villenage. Boldon Book : \"The villains of South Bedic hold their vill to farm, and pay 5s. and provide 160 men to mow in harvest, and 36 carts to lead (the lord's) corn at Hocton.\" In 1335, Alianor de Colley died seized of the manor of South Bedyk nigh Newbotell, held of the bishop in chief by homage, fealty, the fourth part of a knight's fee, and suit at the county court of Durham, val. \u00a34, leaving Gilbert son of Walter de Colley her son and heir, who styled himself Dominus de Bedyk-Waterville in 1336, and covenanted with William son of Alan de Slikcburn that his lands should descend without alienation to his son Roger de Colley, and Matilda daughter and heiress of William de Dunelm. The manor was soon vol. 1. 4 Z"], [502, "362 EASINGTON AVARD.-N. D. after held in equal moieties by the families of Dalden and Burnynghill, derived not improbably from coheiresses of Roger de Colley. The Daldens' share, by marriage, descended in the Bowes family, which ultimately obtained both portions of the manor. After the death of the Knight- Marshal, Biddic-AVaterville became the seat of George Bowes, Esq., his second son by the first marriage, whose son, Sir George Bowes, Knt., afterwards of Bradley, and heir male of the whole family-, is also styled of Biddic-Waterville in 1630.* This Sir George Bowes sold the estate to the Lambtons.-f* Robert Lambton of Biddick, Esq., intermarried with Anne Delavale, I67O.

The estate was since sold by auction to the Marquis of Londonderry, who afterwards sold the hall, with a part of the lands, to the Lambtons of Lambton, and they are now occupied by AVilliam Henry Lamb ton, Esq., a younger branch of that family. The village of South Biddick lies in a low, sequestered situation, and, like most other villages, enjoys the convenience of having joiners, shoemakers, tailors, a blacksmith, and a public house. There is also a boat-builder in the place. This village, says Messrs. Parson and AVhite, in their Di rectory, \"was formerly inhabited by banditti, who set all authority at defiance; nay, the officers of excise were afraid of surveying the two public houses, unless protected by some of the most daring of the colliers, who were rewarded for their trouble. There weie in the village about ten shops or houses where contraband spirits were publicly sold without any licence. The press-gang were at one time beat out of the place with the loss of two men, and never more were known to venture into it ; for if they were known to be in the neighbourhood, the ' Biddickers' used to sound a horn, the signal for them to fly to arms; fires were lighted in various places; the keels in the river were seized, with which they formed a bridge of communication with Fatfield (another place on the opposite side of the river, equally as lawless as their own), and kept watch and ward till the danger was past ; in consequence of which it became a receptacle for such as had violated the laws of their country.\"* * Here, it is said, James Drummond, generally styled Duke of Perth, sought shelter and safety after the defeat of Prince Charles at Culloden. James Drummond (6th Earl and 3d Duke of Perth) was born May 11, 1713- As his father had died at Paris in 1717, he was sent at an early age to the college of Douay, from which he was afterwards removed to the Scots college at Paris. About the time of his majority, he returned to Scotland, and seems to have been in some degree under the influence of his mother, Lady Jean Gordon, only daughter of the Duke of Gordon, a woman of great spirit and activity, and warmly attached to the House of Stuart. On going to join the chieftains in 1745, tradition states that he turned round, when losing sight of his seat, and, as if anticipating the result, exclaimed, \"Oh! my bonny Drummond Castle, and my bonny lands!\" He was first lieutenant-general at the battle of Preston Pans, and com- manded at the sieges of Carlisle and Stirling. He commanded the left wing of the army at the decisive battle of Culloden, where he was severely wounded, and fled on horseback from the field; and, according to the common opinion, embarked for France, but died on the passage. In the Case published by his grandson, Thomas Drummond of New Penshaw, setting forth his claims to the honours and estates of the Earldom of Perth, this statement is denied, and a variety of evidence is ad- duced to prove that it is unfounded. It is therein stated, that, after the battle, he skulked for some time in disguise about the woods of Druinmond Castle, and, as soon as opportunity offered, sailed for Shields, and finally fixed his residence at Biddick. Here he lodged vvith a pitman named John Armstrong, whose daughter he married. After this event, he removed, under the protection of Nicholas Linibton, Esq., to the \" Boat House,\" adding the profits of a huckster's shop to that of the ferry. Here he died in June, 1782, in the 70th year of his age, and was buried at the chapel of Penshaw. His eldest son, Jaines, was a quiet, timid, inactive man; and, after a laborious life, died February 7- 1823, leaving several sons and daughters, of whom the eldest son is Thomas Drummond, born April 3, 1792, who is the Claimant. The chief proofs and evidences of the identity of the Duke of Perth with his grandfather, rest on the reported declarations of his two daughters, Mrs. Ann Atkinson and Mrs. Elizabeth Peters. They expressly state, that their father visited Drummond Castle in the garb of a beggar; that he declared the scars on his person were in consequence of wounds received at Culloden ; and that they had heard both General Lambton and N. Lambton, Esq., say that they knew he was the rebel Drummond. There is also a quotation from a letter written to him by his brother, Lord John Drummond, dated April 16, 1747, wherein it is said, \" I think you had better come to France, and you would be out of danger, as I find you are living in obscurity at Houghton-le-Spring,\u2014 I doubt that is\" a dangerous place yet,\" &c. \"You say it is reported you died on your passage to France \u2014 I hope and trust you will still live in obscurity,\" &c- Some documents, it is sujiu"], [504, "364 EASINGTON AVARD.\u2014 N. D. Burn-Moors Is a small separate constablery, formerly Biddick Fence, and was separated from Biddick about seventy years ago, probably on account of the population attached to the collieries. Sir George Bowes granted Biddic-Fence to his brother, Robert Bowes, about 1629- A\\rilliam Bowes sold the estate, about 1680, to Henry Lambton of Lambton, Esq., whose descendant, Lord Durham, is the present proprietor. The modern name of Burn-Moors is probably derived from the Moors-Burn. This township contains two farmsteads and four public houses, with some genteel residences at Bowes House. Dec-pit Row, Wapping, Elba, Bounder House, and Board's Nook, arc all hamlets in Burn-Moors; but New Lambton is the most considerable place. Salt works were established here in 1815, by Messrs. Rand and Parkinson ; the spring having been first discovered to contain salt by the water leaving a quantity of that useful article in the steam boiler at the Dee pit, near New Lambton, and afterwards in the boiler at the New Lambton pit, where the works are situ ated. The brine well is 97 fathoms deep. Here is a AVesleyan Methodist chapel, and a Sunday school belong-insc to the Methodists, where about 150 children receive instruction. \"__> o ' Morton Grange Lies in the vale two miles to the west of Houghton-le-Spring. It includes four farm-houses and a public house. The services due from this vill are thus described in Boldon Book : \" In Morton are 16 farmers, who hold twenty-five oxgangs each, consisting of 12 acres, and render eight-pence, and perform twenty days' works in autumn with one man for each oxgang, and harrow during eight days, with one horse for every two oxgangs. They till four ridges of land, like those of AVardon ; and lead hay and grain six days, and carry eight loads in the year to Durham, or four to Alclet (Auckland) ; and for every carucate of land they plough one acre (of the lord's land) at Houghton, and render hens and eggs in the same proportion as AVardon.\" Under Hatfield's Survey the same services appear, but commuted in part for a monied payment. In 1525, Cardinal Thomas Wolsey granted a lease of the manor and Grange, under \u00a36 reserved rent, to Richard Belasyse, who had married Margery, daughter and heir of Richard Errington, of Cockle Park Tower in Northumberland, and of Morton, Esq. Richard Belasyse, Esq., died in 1541, leaving William his son and heir, under age, afterwards of Newbrough Abbey in Yorkshire, Knt. Sir William probably settled Morton on his younger son, Bryan Belasyse, Esq., brother of Sir Henry Belasyse, and uncle of Thomas the first ATiscount Fauconberg, who resided here in the reigns of Elizabeth and James. His son, Sir William Belasyse, Knt., who is styled of Morton in 1615, was high sheriff of the county of Durham, under Bishops Neile and Morton, from 1628 tiU his death in 1641. He re- posed, were lost, when AATilliam, his second son, a master mariner, perished at sea ; and still more important documents were irretrievably lost during the great flood in the AArear in 1771, when his house was reduced to a ruin, and scarcely an article of furniture was saved. (See the whole Case, which has been thrice printed.) Under the Act 24 Geo- III., cap. lvii., 1784, the Perth estates were granted by his late majesty, King George III-, to the father of Lady Gwydyr, who had been found, by a decree of the Court of Session, to be the nearest heir male of the attainted John Drummond, under the supposition that James Drummond had died witnout issue."], [505, "HOUGHTON-LE-SPRING. 365 ceived King Charles on his Scottish progress in 1633, at the head of the gentry, \" all giving the sheriff's livery, ash colour, lined with blue bayes.\" The loyalty of Sir William's sons, during the civil wars, nearly occasioned the utter ruin ofthe family ; and, after the Restoration, their losses and services, though acknowledged, passed unrewarded amidst the crowd of suffering loyalists. AVil liam Belasyse, Esq. (second son of Sir William) removed into Yorkshire, but died possessed of Morton House about 1678. The estate was probably sold soon after to Thomas Smith, Esq., who removed hither from West Herrington. His grandson, Meaborne Smith, Esq., left the estate to his three daughters (by his second wife), whose husbands joined in a sale of the estate to Major general John Lambton. Mortem House is the seat of Ralph John Lambton, Esq. The whole is held by lease for years under the bishop of Durham. Cocken Lies on the AVear, five miles north-north-west of Durham, where the river forms a most beautiful curvature, and almost encloses Cocken Hall. \u00c6llafus, a priest, gave Cocken to the prior and monks of Durham, in the time of Bishop Galfrid. In process of time, the prior exchanged his lands of Cocken for lands in AVolviston with Roger de Kibblesworth, whose heiress, Petronilla, gave, with consent of Reginald her husband, except eighty acres to the heir male, her land, man- sion, wood, and fisheries, to the prior of Finchale. A portion of the vill was held by the Kibbles- worths, Birtleys, and Lumleys, under the prior of Finchale. In 1509, Richard Lord Lumley died seized of a capital messuage and a hundred acres of land in Cocken held of the bishop. The remainder of the vill was vested in the prior of Finchale, and fell to the crown at the dissolution. The scite only of Finchale Abbey was restored to the new cathedral of Durham ; and all its other possessions were soon parcelled out to the grantees of the crown. By letters patent, dated 1st November, 35 Henry VIII., the king granted the capital messuage or grange of Cocken, late par- cel ofthe dissolved monastry of Duiham, to John Hilton of Newcastle and Isabel his wife, their heirs and assigns, to hold by the twentieth part of a knight's fee, and 16s. 4d. reserved rent. Isa- bel survived her husband, and died in the 21st of Elizabeth, seized of the same premises in Cocken, leaving Ralph Carr her grandson and heir, aged 29 years. Before the end ofthe 16th century, the whole manor or vill of Cocken was united (as well Lord Lumley 's share as the abbey lands) in the possession of Ralph Carr, Esq. The estate has since continued in the family of Carr, though not in the same branch of it. By indenture, dated 14th May, 1662, Francis Carr of Cocken, Esq., mortgaged \" the capital messuage or grange of Cocken\" to Ralph Carr of Newcastle-on-Tyne, Gent., for \u00a32170, reserving the colliery and seams of coal on the estate;* and by another inden- ture, 18th December, 1665, he released to the same Ralph Carr, Esq., for the additional sum of \u00a3?716, 16s., all his equity of redemption and remaining interest in the estate, still reserving the mines; which were afterwards, 29th December, 1671, conveyed to Joseph Carr of Coxlodge, Gent., on trust for tlie same Ralph Carr, to whom he immediately assigned them.

D. 366 Cocken Hall occupies a fine elevated situation, which has been much admired by the lovers of the picturesque. Pennant says, \" 12 July, saw Coken, the seat of Mr. Carr ; a most romantic si tuation, laid out with great judgment : The walks are very extensive, principally along the sides or at the bottom of great dells, bounded with vast precipices, finely wooded ; and many parts of the rocks are planted with vines and other fruit trees, which I was told bore well, but late. The river AVere winds along the hollows, and forms two very fine reaches, at the place where you enter these walks. Its waters are very clear, and its bottom a solid rock. The view towards the ruins of Finchal Abbey is remarkably great ; and the walk beneath the cliffs has a magnificent so lemnity, a fit retreat for its monastic inhabitants. This was once called the Desert, and was the rude scene of the austerities of St. Godric,* who carried them to the most senseless extravagance. A sober mind may even at present be affected with horror at the prospect from the summits of the cliffs into a darksome and stupendous chasm, rendered still more tremendous by the roaring of the waters over its distant bottom.\" Hutchinson to this description adds, \" The house and adjacent grounds are situated on an eminence, on three sides washed by the river, and towards the east bounded by deep dells, filled with stately forest trees. The southern side of this peninsula is laid out in pleasure grounds ; one wide and extended terrace runs along the summit of the cliffs, an other at their feet : From the upper terrace fine openings in the wood afford prospects of the adja cent lands ; and in one point of view, you look down upon the solemn vale scattered with the ruins of the monastry and abbey. The lower terrace is formed on the shelves of the rocky shore, from whence the cliff's rise perpendicular near an hundred feet, crowned with hanging oaks, which strike their roots into the fissures of the rock, and stretch a solemn umbrage over the walk. From this terrace the ruins of the religious edifice appear in all their majestic beauties, shut in by rising grounds fringed with woods ; the river falls over a rocky channel in troubled streams, and the murmurs of the waters are repeated by a soothing echo. For religious contemplation, recluse piety, and self-denial, never was place better adapted ; much pity it was ever disgraced by un meaning severity and hypocrisy \u25a0' Ararious are the beautiful scenes this walk affords ; description is languid ; to visit the place is the only means of forming ideas of its picturesque excellencies. Proceeding along the eastern side of the eminence, the walk is carried on the summit of a deep and wooded dell, which relieves the eye for some time before you enter upon the northern rocks, which are shaken, rugged, and truly august ; mighty volumes hang over your head, as if the wind which shook the oaks would rend the precipice and tumble it into the vale. Several deep grottos, formed by nature, are shadowed with trees suspended from their roof; hasty streams fall from the cliffs, and with a hollow clamour increase the pleasing solemnity of the vast scene. The river forms a canal near a mile in length, through an avenue of rocks and hanging forests; the spire of Chester church the terminating object. The woods are noble, consisting chieflv of oaks of a great age : Nature has lavished beauties on this place, and what art has done with an excellent taste, has smoothed her brow where art was wanted, and opened to the eye those beauties her wildness would otherwise have concealed.\" The natural beauties of this place, so justly celebrated, have been highly improved by the taste and attention of its late owners ; but its solemn character has been somewhat diminished by the fall of the old oak wood, which has not been repaired by the rise of a young spring of tender trees * stir. Pennant is here mistaken. It was at Finchale, on the opposite side of the river, that the hermitage stood where St. Godric practised his austerities."], [507, "HOUGHTON-LE-SPRING. 367 in its stead. Still there are walks and views and retreats in this place, which cannot but surprise and gratify the lovers of the sublime and beautiful. In 1804, Cocken Hall became the residence of a convent of nuns, of the order of St. Theresa, from Lier in Flanders. This community, which was first seated at St. Helen's, Auckland, con sisted of sixteen choir nuns and six lay-sisters, under the care of Dame Jessop as abbess. In this enchanting spot, so well adapted for religious contemplation, retirement, piety, and self-denial, lived these harmless nuns, during many years, secluded from the world. A colliery having been opened a few years ago near this delicious retreat, the sisterhood removed to Field House, near Darlington. The hall is now occupied by Mr. Crawford, a viewer. AVest Rainton Is a village and township four miles north-east of Durham, containing several farmers, victuallers, mechanics, and shopkeepers. Here is a handsome mansion-house, built about 1690 by S;r John Duck, Baronet. Here was anciently a chapel, and a chantry therein, dedicated to the ATirgin Mary, called Our Lady's Chapel. Vestiges of the foundations of the building still remain. A chapel of ease was erected in 1825, of which the Rev. Joseph Tiffin is curate. There is also a Methodist chapel in the village, and a Sunday-school is attached to both places of worship. Reynton, otherwise Reynington, was an ancient manor and park belonging to the prior and con vent of Durham ; and, in 1508, Prior Thomas had a grant of free warren from Bishop Bainbrigg, after which the convent obtained many successive grants of lands, which, after the dissolution, were restored to the new cathedral. Nearly the whole property in the Raintons is held by lease under the dean and chapter of Durham. Rainton Pit Houses, a scattered hamlet, about half a mile to the westward of West Rainton, was a fertile source of dispute betwixt the parishes of Houghton and Pittington. At the assizes, 1691, it was determined, and the decision has since been acquiesced in, that the houses on the north and east side of the Old Gate and Hedge (viz. \" the houses from Rainton turnpike-gate on both sides of the lane leading to Cocken\") should belong to Houghton ; and those on the south side of the gate (\" a few detached cottages near the Nag's Head, almost surrounded by the town ship of West Rainton\") to Pittington. East Rainton Lies about a mile distant from West Rainton, and on the road from Durham to Houghton. The township is divided into six farms, and contains several coal-mines. On December 18, 181 7, an explosion of inflammable air took place in the Plain pit ; and a similar accident occurred in the same mine on November 3, 1823. Seventy-nine men and boys, and twelve horses, were killed by these explosions. In the village there is a Wesleyan chapel, a day-school, and a brewery, malting, and corn-mill, belonging to Messrs. Legg and Co. Middle Rainton, a hamlet in this township, was erected in a freehold field belonging to R.

D. 368 Moor House, A constablery on the extreme western verge of the parish of Houghton, consisting of three farm houses and a cottage on the south of the Durham road, about half a mile west from Pit Houses. In 1664, this place was the seat of WilUam Ingleby, Esq., and afterwards of George Roper, Gent. Moorsley, Anciently called Moreslawe (the Moor-hill), a small village on a high, bare brow, overlooking the vale of Houghton. Adam de Moreslaw gave his lands to the prior of Durham ; and his son He lyas confirmed his father's donation, abjured all right in his inheritance, and was admitted into the prior's household as a lay domestic, to serve either as porter of the malt-house, or in any other menial office which the prior might appoint. His wife, whose sex excluded her from the monastry, had a toft and two acres in Moreslawe assigned to her rent-free for life. Several other grants were made to the convent; and had the system of donations continued, the church must have eventually ab sorbed the whole landed property of the Palatinate. Low Moorsley is a hamlet, where there are three public houses, two shops, and a few cottages. Hetton-le-Hole. This village lies in the vale of Houghton, to the north-east of Moorsley, and 5| miles east-north east of Durham. Hetton Burn rises a little to the east of the village, passes Rainton bridge, and, running westward, receives Houghton and West Herrington Burns ; after which, assuming the name of the Moorsburn, it passes near Lambton, and falls into the AVear in Lumley Park. Hetton-le-Hole and Hetton-on-the-Hill seem to have formed originally but one integral manor, of which each viU was afterwards considered a moiety. It is probable that Hetton-on-the-Hill was the old manorial residence, and that the larger village afterwards arose gradually in a more shel tered situation in the vale. Some old traces of foundations, or of an entrenchment, are still visible on the height. At an early date, most of the manor of Hetton was vested in the monastry of Fin chale. Other parts of the manor belonged, in 1380, to William de Laton, from whom it descended to the Tylliols and stlusgraves. A moiety of the manor descended from the heirs of the Moorsley s to Sir Thomas Knevett, whose part became divided into a number of small estates. The principal estate was purchased by the family of James. \" In 1607, Edward and Thomas Lewen of Hetton, Gents., conveyed to Francis James, D. C. L., Edward James of London, merchant, and Hugh Sel bie, 'all that capital messuage in Hetton-le-Hole which did formerly come by descent to Robert Lewen, father of Edward ; and another messuage in the tenure of Anne, widow of Christopher Lewen, charged with an annual pension of \u00a36, 13s. 4d. to the Free School of Rivington in Lanca shire.' In 1611, Ann Lewen, widow, suffered a recovery of all her interest to John Richardson and others, trustees for \\Arilliam James, bishop of Durham, who, in 1615, devised all his lands in Hetton to his youngest son, Francis James. In 1664, Bryan James, Esq,, conveyed a moiety of the manor of Hetton-le-Hole, late belonging to his father Francis James and his brother AVilliam Jaines, Esq., to George French of London, haberdasher, for \u00a31402, 10s, In 1686, George French conveyed the same estate to John Spearman, Gent,, under-sheriff of Durham, who settled his Het-."], [509, "HOUGHTON-LE-SPRING. 369 ton lands in 1694, on the marriage of his eldest son, John Spearman, Esq., with Ann Bromley. John Spearman of Hetton, Esq., died in 1725 ; and his son and heir, John Spearman, Esq., sold the estate, in 173\u2014, to the Countess Dowager of Strathmore, who gave or devised it to her young est son, the Hon. Thomas Lyon,\" whose son, John Lyon, Esq., succeeded to the estate. Hetton Hall occupies a low situation to the west of the village. It is an excellent deserted mansion-house, finely embosomed by soft wooded grounds. It stands near the margin of a beauti ful sheet of water, formed by the Hetton Burn. The dene, through which the stream falls, affords some sequestered and close-wooded walks. Hetton Township is very populous, and contains four farms, twenty inns and taverns, eight day-schools, a corn mill, three breweries, and a number of butchers, bakers, blacksmiths, shoe makers, tailors, joiners, grocers, shopkeepers, and other useful avocations. In the village there are four places of worship, belonging to the Baptists, and the Wesleyan, Primitive, and Kilhamite Methodists. There is also a chapel of ease to Houghton church now building. Easington Lane is a neighbouring large viUage, nearly a mile in length, where the AAresleyan and Primitive Methodists have each a chapel. The Downs is a hamlet in this township, crowded with pitmen's cottages. Hetton Colliery is a valuable and extensive concern, and continues to be enlarged by the sinking of new pits. The winning of this colliery forms a new era in the history of mines and of geologi cal science. Geologists previously asserted that coal did not exist beneath the magnesian lime stone, or, if it did exist, they said it must be deteriorated both in quality and thickness: but this colliery has been sunk through a bed of this stone, 58 yards in thickness ; and, so far from being deteriorated, the coal is excellent, both in quality and thickness. The rail-way from this colliery to the company's staith on the AVear, near Sunderland, was opened on November 18, 1822. It is eight miles in length, and in its course passes over AVardonlaw, one of the highest hills in the county of Durham. The operations of the powerful and ingenious machinery on this rail-way are truly wonderful. Five of Mr. G. Stephenson's patent travelling engines, two 60 horse power, fixed reciprocating engines, and five self-acting inclined planes, simultaneously perform their various and complicated offices, with the precision and exactness of the most simple machinery. The whole arrangement of this new and wonderful undertaking was completed under the direction of Mr. Robert Stephenson, the company's resident engineer. \"In a field,\" says Surtees, \"on the right-hand side of the road from Eppleton to Hetton, and only one field from Houghton-lane, is a remarkable tumulus, consisting entirely of field-stones ga thered together. At the top there is a small oblong hoUow, called the Fairies' Cradle : on this little green mound, which has been always sacred from the plough, village-superstition believes the fairies to have led their moonlight circles, and whistled their roundelays to the wind. The sub terraneous palaces of the fairy sovereign are frequently supposed, both in England and Scotland, to exist under these regular green hillocks ; ' Up spoke the moody fairy king, AVho wons beneath the hill ; Like wind in the porch of a ruin'd church, His voice was loud and shrill.' But the Hetton fairies, of whom, however, there is no living evidence, spoke with a voice remark, ably small and exile.\" vol. i, 5 B"], [510, "370 EASINGTON WARD.\u2014 N. D. Eppleton. This ancient manor and vill is situated on the south-eastern verge of the parish of Houghton-le- Spring, and adjoining to Hetton township. It consists of three farms, and stands on a high, regular swell of country. The chief mansion, a plain four-square building of the age of Charles II. , fronts the south, and commands a prospect as far as Huntcliff Nab on the Yorkshire coast. Eppleden gave name, for nearly three centuries, to a race of local proprietors. The Herons purchased the estate in 1391, and it continued for several descents in this martial family. Sir AVilliam Heron of Ford, captain of Berwick, governor of Norham, and twice AVarden of the East March, in the arms of whose lady James IV. wasted his hours previous to the field of Flodden, neglected this his distant estate of Eppleton, which, in consequence of his prodigality, he was obliged to sell to Todd his tenant. The acquisition did not long continue in the purchaser's fa mily ; for, in 1592, six-sevenths of Eppleton was bought by Sir Cuthbert CoUingwood of Dalden, Knt., and became the occasional residence of his family. The Shadforths afterwards became gra dually possessors of one-half of the manor. Thomas Shadforth, who had livery of his lands in 1628, resided at Eppleton nearly half a century : he married a sister of John Blakiston, one of the regicides, and, either from his connections or inclination, became a zealous supporter of the par liamentary interest during the civil wars, sat on all their commissions within the county, and after wards served the office of sheriff in 1651. In 1692, the estate was purchased by Francis Mascall of Durham, Gent. Eppleton Field House, in 1700, passed from the Shadforths to the Gowlands; but was purchased, some years ago, by James Jackson, Esq. AVardon, A township containing a corn-mill and two farmsteads, north of Eppleton, and two miles east of Houghton-le-Spring. Wardon Law is the usual name of the lofty hill which is the highest ground on the eastern coast of Durham. It rises gradually on all sides except the east. The summit is crossed by the Hetton colliery rail-way, the waggons being drawn up and let down by a steam engine fixed at the top. By Boldon Book, there were nine farmers in AVardon, holding 18 ox gangs, each containing thirteen acres and a half. The whole township is held by copy of court-roll under the bishop's manor of Houghton. A moiety of the vill, which descended from the Shad forths, was sold, in 1811, to Mr. AViUiam Hutchinson of Durham: the other moiety belonged to the Hutton family of Houghton-le-Spring.

In 1828, the former place received \u00a333, 15s. 6d., and Murton \u00a316, 17s. ; and in former years the variation has not been to any great amount. These sums have been disposed of bv the parish officers, with some of the principal inhabitants in each township, amongst their respective poor, chiefly in provisions and clothing. In some instances, sums of money have been given, but not without some particular reason. Cer tificates are sent up annually to the solicitors for the trustees in London, showing how the charity is disposed of. Dalden. This township, which was separated from Dalton-le-Dale in 1744, consists of three farms. The ruins of Dalden Tower stand near the sea, in the depth of the dale. It is now reduced to some irre gular masses of the outward walls. In one of these fragments there remains a niche with a pointed canopy, which seems to have decorated the interior of some apartment \u2014 possibly of the chapel. A"], [515, "DALTON-LE-DALE. 373 part of the manor-house, which has been built adjoining to the Tower on the east, probably by the Collingwoods about the reign of James, is still standing, and retains in its heavy gateway, mossy slated roof, and grey orchard walls, the traces of an old manorial residence. The situation of Dalden Tower, in the narrowest part of the vale, close to the hill and to the stream, but with a fine area of pasturage adjoining, has been evidently chosen vvith a view to se curity, and to command the pass ; but its strength can have been only calculated to resist the sudden attacks of the predatory bands who so often ravaged the eastern coast, or of a feudal neighbour. It has plainly belonged to that class of Peels, or castelets, so frequent on the Borders, consisting possibly of one square or oblong tower, with a dungeon, and a walled court for the protection of cattle. A domestic chapel or oratory was a constant appendage to this species of structure; and, in 1325, Sir Jordan de Dalden obtained a licence to establish one here, on condi tion that no injury should arise to the parish church of St. Andrew at Dalton. It is somewhat remarkable that the deep repose and tranquillity of the scenery around Dalden Tower have not attracted the improving hand of art; as it might easily be rendered a most delightful retreat, uniting a noble sea-view with the softest pastoral landscape on the eastern coast. Soon after the Conquest, Dalden Tower was the seat of the baronial family of Escolland, who probably assumed the local name; for, so early as Bishop Hatfield's time, AVilliam de Dalden held the manor of the Lord de Percy, by homage, fealty, and a knight's fee, for which the Lord Percy made suit at the bishop's county court every fortnight. Dalden, with the manor of Homil don, and half of those of Seaham, Hetton, and Biddic- AAraterville, centered in the family of Bowes, by the marriage of Matilda, daughter of Robert de Dalden, with Sir William Bowes, Knt., about 1375; and of Sir Robert Bowes, their son, with Joan, daughter of Sir Robert Conyers of Ormesby, and heiress of her mother, Aline, widow of William de Dalden. Dalden Tower conti nued for centuries a favourite seat of the family of Bowes.* Sir George Bowes, Knt., who died in 1556, left three daughters, who inherited his estates in the eastern part of tbe county. Eliza beth, the eldest, intermarried with John Blakiston of Blakiston, and Dorothy with Sir Cuthbert CoUingwood of EsUngton ; betwixt whom the manor of Dalden was divided. In 1618, however, it was united, by purchase, in the family of CoUingwood, who sold it, about 167*-,f to Sir Mark * The testamentary disposition of Maud, Lady of Dalden, the heiress of her family, and widow of Sir AVilliam Bowes, in 1420, is singular.

It is now the property of the Marquis of Londonderry. Seaham Harbour. In 1820, the late Sir Ralph Noel applied to William Chapman, Esq., M. R. I. A., Civil En^ gineer, &c. on the subject of making a coal port by extending certain of the inlets in the high lands on th coast of the parish of Dalton-le-Dale, and sheltering them by piers on the rocks without. A plan of a small harbour was accordingly drawn by that gentleman, vvhich attracted the attention of the Marquis of Londonderry, who had, in the interim, purchased the estates of Sir Ralph Noel. The design was viewed by that nobleman in so favourable a light, that he desired Mr. Chapman to devise a more extensive plan ; and the work, in a short time, proceeded with a spirit and in dustry almost unparalleled. The coves being the first part sheltered, their enlargement was commenced in September, 1828. The limestone rock dug out from them was converted into lime, and used for the filling ofthe piers, and the formation of a foreshore on the north, which is defended by a sloping pavement and a pa rapet. The south quay and jetties were also formed, leaving a passage into this Inner Harbour of 32 feet, closed by a falling gate, retaining the water within a few feet of the level of neap tides ; and secured from the rage of easterly seas by a line of booms. On Friday, November 28, 1828, the day appointed for laying the foundation stone of the north pier, destined to form the Outer Harbour, an immense concourse of people, many of them from a great distance, assembled to witness the ceremony. Numerous flags were hoisted along the coast, and a battery of patereros was placed on one of the points of the harbour. The scene was strikingly gay and animated, and very much resembled the eager bustle incidental to some great sporting movements on the turf, from the vast concourse of persons of all classes, and the numerous car riages that were assembled, even before the hour of 12 o'clock. The Marquis and Marchioness of Londonderry, accompanied by Lord Ravensworth and family, the Brandling family, Sir H. Browne, Sir C. Sharpe, Sir R. S. Hawks, Mr. and Mrs. Littleton, and other friends, arrived in their carriages about one o'clock. Their approach was announced by a salute of 19 guns from the battery, and shortly afterwards the distinguished party were let down in a splendid rail way carriage to that part of the harbour where the stone was suspended ready for its final position ; the band preceding them. The marquis then alighted; and Mr. Buddie, having taken his place on the foundation stone, and holding in his hand a superb silver trowel, addressed the noble mar quis on the magnitude and importance of the undertaking ; the facilities which the new harbour would afford to the commercial enterprise of the county ; and the benefits which would result to humanity from the opening of a place of refuge to vessels in distress upon this hitherto inhospita ble coast. Mr. Buddie having presented the trowel to his lordship, Sir C. Sharpe addressed the spectators, and presented a flag to the Marchioness of Londonderry, inscribed with the armorial bearings of the family, encircled with the motto of \" Success to Seaham Harbour.\" The Marquis of Londonderry, having completed the ceremony of laying the foundation stone, again mounted the lingwood of Eslington perished in the ill-fated insurrection of 1715, and the family residence there became, by purchase from the crown, the property of the LiddeUs of Ravensworth. \u2014 Surtees."], [517, "DALTON-LE-DALE. 375 Car. He addressed the assembled multitude with much feeling, and was rapturously cheered. A salute of 34 patereroes was fired from the neighbouring cliff', to signify the conclusion of the first ceremony. The car containing the noble family was drawn from the beach amidst the most enthu siastic cheering. On reaching the summit of the bank, AV. Chapman, Esq., the engineer, handing to the Marquis of Londonderry the plan of the harbour, took occasion to deliver a few observations on the forwardness of the work so recently commenced, and on the future extent of its utility. The marquis and marchioness, and their friends, having alighted from the car, walked round the limits of the harbour to inspect the progress of the work since they were last there, and then re-entering their barouche, they proceeded to the spot where the foundation stone of the first house of Seaham Town was to be laid by Viscount Seaham. The marquis and his little boy here de scended from the carriage, and were received by John Dobson, Esq., of Newcastle, architect, who, in presenting a plan of the intended town to Lord Seaham, briefly addressed the young nobleman, who had not then attained his eighth year. Plates of brass, bearing appropriate inscriptions, enclosed, with a few coins and a newspaper of the day, in glass, hermetically sealed, were deposited in a cavity of each foundation stone. The plate deposited beneath the pier bore the following inscription : \u2014 CHARLES AVILLIAM VANE, THIRD MARQUIS OF LONDONDERRY, VISCOUNT CASTLEREAGH AND BARON STEAVART, OF MOUNT STEWART AND OP BALLILAWN, IN IRELAND, AND FIRST EARL A^ANE AND VISCOUNT SEAHAM, OP TUE UNITED KINGDOM OP GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND, G.

Having married Frances Anne A^ane Tempest, only daughter of Sir Henry Vane Tempest, Bart., by Anne, Countess of Antrim, he became possessed of the estates and collieries of the Vane and Tempest fa milies in the county of Durham, and having added and annexed the estate of Seaham to the same, he em barked in the construction of this harbour, vvith an humble and confident hope of facilitating the exportation of the produce of the mines, and of augmenting the commercial interests of the county of Durham. In this undertaking, the founder has been chiefly advised by the tried experience and indefatigable indus try of his valued friend and agent, John Buddle, Esq. of Wallsend. AVILLIAM CHAPMAN, ESQ., ENGINEER. The inscription on the plate placed in the foundation-stone of the intended town was as follows : GEORGE HENRY ROBERT CHARLES VANE, VISCOUNT SEAHAM, LAID THE FOUNDATION STONE OF THE FIRST HOUSE OF SEAHAM TOAVN, NOV. 28th, 1828, A. D. JOHN DOBSON, Esq., ARCHITECT. The trowel which the Marquis of Londonderry used in laying the foundation-stone of the pier, was of silver, beautifully wrought. On the upper side of it was an engraved plan of the intended harbour, and on the lower the foUowing inscription : \u2014 \" This trowel presented to the most Honourable Charles AVilliam Vane Stewart, Marquis of Londonderry, by John Buddie, on laying the foundation stone of the north pier of Seaham harbour, this 28th day Nov. 1828.\""], [518, "EASINGTON WARD\u2014 N. D. 376 The handle was formed of Rainton coal, highly polished. The trowel presented by Mr. Dobson to Lord Seaham was also of silver, with a handle of limestone of a very fine description, with which the Seaham estate abounds. It was also beautifully pobshed. After the stones were laid, an im mense rock in the inner harbour was blasted by powder. The marquis and marchioness then re paired to Seaham House, where between two and three hundred of their friends partook of a sumptuous cold collation. The proceedings of this clay were calculated to make a deep impression on those who witnessed them. Every thing was conducted with the utmost decorum, though from 7 to 8000 persons were assembled. Lord Londonderry requested Mr. Mackreth to make this gay scene the subject of one of a series of pictures then painting for his lordship, as an illustration of this grand work. On the 25th of July, 1831, the Inner Harbour having been completed, the railway made passa ble, and geers constructed for two loading berths, the Marquis of Londonderry, with a select party, attended to see the first vessel (the Lord Seaham, a new ship carrying fourteen keels of coals) receive her loading and proceed to sea. The ship was towed out in grand style by two steamers, amidst the cheers of an immense concourse of spectators, the waving of banners, and the music of a band provided for the occasion. Fourteen steam-vessels were present, crowded with passengers from the adjacent ports. The third loading geers, completing the extent of the staiths on the south side of the Inner Harbour, are now finished; and a bason has been formed capable of containing 26 vessels. The excavations of limestone from the north and west, however, are carried on vvith such rapidity, that, in a short time, the whole of the designed extent of this part of the work, viz. 2\\ acres, will be cleared out, and brought down to a level with the bottom of the harbour ; when additional works will be constructed for loading and for the delivery of ballast. The Inner Harbour will not, at low water, have less than seven feet depth, so that loaden vessels will be so far water borne ; exclusive of which, its bottom is either a hard clay or strong marie, on which the general run of coal vessels may lie with safety. The limestone is burnt in kilns facing the sea to the north of the harbour, and which are capable of consuming daily 40 chaldrons of lime, of 36 heaped AA'nichester bushels. The Outer Harbour is formed by piers. The north pier extends as far into the sea, in an east south-east direction, as is consistent with safety ; after which, forming a right angle, it runs south-south-west, thus inclosing a square area of 2i acres. This pier is sheltered, on the north and north-east, in vvhich directions the most violent sea rages, by large rocks. The foundation of the east pier, which runs parallel to the coast, is principally upon a rock of considerable height. These erections are designed, not only to protect the coves and their enlargement, but also all the future extent of harbour. The height of the breakwaters will be six feet above ordinary spring tides ; and each of their transverse lines will have two cross walls, or facings, at 40 feet asunder, to admit of an opening being made through it, whenever an additional harbour to the south may be formed, which may extend as far as the ridge of rocks runs parallel to the shore, or beyond that limit, whenever expedient. The first division ofthe South Harbour will contain 7 acres, the second 4\\, and the third 7- The whole of the harbours, when completed, will contain from 200 to 300 sail of vessels. \" The progression of these extensive works,\" says Mr. Chapman, \" will evidently depend on the quantity of coals, from more or less adjacent collieries, that may be brought to this harbour ; which, inclusive of Blyth, has a better outlet to the south than any harbour on the coast; and in a good offing to clear the Yorkshire coast, in the long prevalent winds from the east and north -east.'*"], [519, "DALTON-LE-DALE. 377 In a \" Report on the Rise, Progress, Present State, and Projected Extension of the Harbour of Seaham,\" by the eminent engineer just quoted, the intended progress of this undertaking is de scribed as foUows : \u2014 \" Notwithstanding the present harbour was formed by enlargement of the coves in the limestone rock, because of the shelter given by the piers of the Outer Harbour, vet its extension to the south was the principal object ,- in the construction of which, nature has afforded peculiar advantages, by longitudinal and transverse ridges of limestone rock, with interstices of marie : therefore the present object is, to include the first division of the South Harbour, by conti nuing a line of pier from the present termination of the south pier (or breakwater) to the shore ; and, subsequently, forming a wet dock on the north side of it, with two entrances ; one on its southern face, next the harbour for light ships, into vvhich vessels will enter early on the tide, and so soon as the tide opens the gates for loaden vessels to proceed to sea, they will enter by the inner gates, with out interruption from the loaden ones proceeding direct to sea. Therefore, when this is finished, which may be in the course of next year, there will be four loading berths on each side ; from which the harbour, at the rate afforded by the three loading berths, might export upwards of 330,000 chaldrons of coals, which is more than was done from the port of Sunderland in 1786, and nearly three-fourths of what was exported from thence in the course of last year. \"The south boundary wall of the dock will be principally over a rock of several feet in height; the remaining extent of the rock will be consumed in the lime-kilns, the filling of the piers, and formation of a beach, on the south side of the north pier, for vessels to run upon, in case they miss of getting a rope to the south pier, in gales from the south. This dock, as already mentioned, will have two pairs of gates, with their sills two feet below low water, and of such height as to retain the water not less than the height of neap tides; from the outermost of which, vessels, load ing from the eight shipping berths, will proceed to sea.\" Two light-houses will be erected on the northern extremity of the east pier.* * In the present state of Seaham harbour, it is obvious that it can only contain a comparatively small number of vessels. The following signals are therefore used to convey information to ships entering or passing the port : \u2014 Cautionins; Day Signals. \u2014 On the south side ofthe loiv light, on the east end of the south pier of the Outer Harbour, there are two strong poles projecting over the pier to the southward ; one of them horizon tally, and the higher one sloping upwards, with an angle of about 30 deg. On the upper one, white balls, of 15 inches diameter, will be hoisted at three feet asunder, middle and middle ; each of which will intimate that 10 vessels may enter the harbour at a proper time of tide ; and each ball on the horizontal pole will 6hevv that there is room for two vessels. Thus the number of vessels that may be conveniently admitted may be easily known ; and those beyond that number, intending to have entered the harbour, may either proceed onwards, anchor in the road, or hover in the offing, according to the time of tide- Cautioning Night Signals.\u2014 On the high light-house, at a height of about 54 feet above spring tides, there will be placed four coloured plano-convex glasses of considerable diameter, (with argand burners behind them,) in two horizontal lines; the lower line, when the burners are lighted, will shew a bright red; and the higher, bright green : and until this light-house be built, the same signals will be shewn from a tempo rary building on the point of the quay at the south side of the Inner Harbour. s 20 Vessels, all four will be lighted. s 10 Vessels, north upper and south lower 18 , the two lower and north upper. 8 , two lights, one above the other.

There is no instance of a private harbour being constructed with such rapidity, and to such ail extent as the present harbour has been, by the affluence and adventurous spirit of the Marquis of Londonderry and his advisers. \"Nature,\" observes Mr. Chapman, \"has afforded the means of extending the harbour to a point requisite to receive the export trade cf all the collieries in the adjacent country ; and it lies more convenient to them than any other harbour, and also should form the export and import harbour for the city of Durham, to which it lies many miles nearer than Hartlepool.\" The following is a statement of its trade, from the opening of the harbour on the 25th of July, 1831, up to the 10th of March, 1832 \u2014 Ships loaded 501 Chaldrons of coal shipped 40,1 19 Tonnage employed for the same 84,659 Seamen employed to navigate the same 3,192 Ships loaded with lime 118 Chaldrons of lime, of 36 Winchester bushels, shipped 4,275 The average register tonnage of the vessels which had entered this harbour up to December, 1831, inclusive, was 182 tons, and the largest 271. At that time, notwithstanding the unfinished and limited state of the harbour, more coals had been vended from hence than from all the small ports north of Tynemouth Haven. Mr. Chapman says, \"Although it was predicted that many vessels would be lost by taking the harbour, and several injured whilst in it, yet not one accident has oc curred, or any injury been sustained, which was far from being the case in the adjacent harbours ; principally because this harbour has good anchorage ground without it, and has a fair channel leading into it, in which there is always grey water, through which vessels may steer, and no bar ; and also its not being affected by land floods.\" The following document has also been presented to a committee of the House of Lords : \u2014 \" I state positively that no accident or damage whatever has happened to any ship or vessel entering into, within, or going to sea from Seaham Harbour, from the 25th day of July, 1831, to the 10th of March, 1832.\u2014 AVilliam Spence.\" However, in the sailing instructions annexed to the chart of the sea coast and plan of Seaham Harbour, published in July, 1831, the dangers resulting from inattention to them are thus alluded to : \u2014 \" As the channel from the sea, between the white and black buoys, is deep when the tide is up, it then, even in heavy gales on the shore, shows itself by grey water; and it is clearly wide enough to admit vessels to approach it either to the northward or southward of the line of lights, mitted will be shown by the signals described. The signal numbers will be progressively reduced, as vessels may approach within the line between the black and white buoys fixed for pointing out the channel. The Day Signals for entering the Port. \u2014 Whenever the tide flows to 8 feet in the harbour, exclusive of the send ofthe sea in its entrance, a flag will be hoisted half-mast high on the flag-staff on the south pier. Whenever the rising tide reaches 11 feet, and until it lowers to 12 feet, the flag will be fully hoisted, and will then be lowered half-mast, until there be only 9 feet water, exclusive ofthe send ofthe sea.

AVhen the north-east pier shall be finished, a similar frame will be constructed nearits end, on vvhich one light will be shewn during the whole period in which it may be proper for light vessels to enter the harbour, by which means the opening between the piers will be clearly shewn; and, until the north pier be finished, a light buoy, carrying a broom, painted white, will be placed close without the foun dation of the pier."], [521, ""], [522, "SEA1HIAM XI A Kb1, OI'K."], [523, "DALTON-LE-DALE. 379 accordingly as the set of the tide or winds may require ; consequently, there is no danger of ves sels losing their steerage-way, which they necessarily must do where the shoalness of the approach causes the water to break at several hundred yards from the shore, as it does at high water, in similar gales, without the harbour immediately to the northward; from which cause, many vessels have been run ashore to the north and south of the piers, and, unfortunately, several have been totally wrecked from being intercepted by the great mass of stones laid on the south of the south pier head. Notwithstanding any advice the pilots may give respecting the time of entering the harbour, the masters of vessels are cautioned to consider their draught of water, and not to attempt to enter contrary to the signals and instructions already given ; as it frequently happens, in similar harbours, that a desire to pilot more vessels has induced those whose business is to conduct them into safety, to push them forward too early in the tide, the result of which is obvious.\"* The plan of the town, which is six miles south of Sunderland, was furnished by John Dobson, of Newcastle, Esq., architect. It will consist of a crescent immediately in front of the harbour, with terraces at each extremity ; and will extend nearly a mile along the heights of the coast, from Liddell's Houses on the south to Dalden Dene on the north, thus forming a striking and picturesque object when viewed from the sea. Streets will branch oft' to the north-west, west, and south-west, for the purpose of allowing the rail-ways and other passages a direct communication with the har bour. The ground for building scites will be let on lease for a term of 99 years, at an annual rent of \u00a33, 3s. for each scite of 21 feet front. The houses will be three stories high, and built uni formly according to a plan provided for that purpose ; with a flagged footpath and a Macadamized road in front. The North Terrace and the North Rail-road Street are the only parts of the town yet built. The former consists of a row of genteel houses, some of them with shops in front. The latter extends from the south end of the North Terrace in a north-west direction, and is formed by two rows of houses, one story in height ; between which, on an inclined plane, the coals from the different col lieries of the Marquis of Londonderry are conveyed to the harbour. No other railway has yet been conducted to this place. From January, 1829, up to March 10, 1832, there had been 133 houses erected, seven of which were built by the Marquis of Londonderry for his workmen. Here are twelve inns and public houses, a few grocers' and other shops, and a day-school. Tempo rary houses, work-shops, and sheds, for the use of the people employed about the various works, are scattered over the heights around the harbour. On the south is a steam-engine, for drawing up the limestone procured from the excavations of the South Harbour and AVet Dock. * The view of the coast from the piers, both to the north and south, impresses the spectator with an idea of the utility and convenience which will result to the shipping on the coast from the opening of Seaham Harbour. A long line of dreary crags extends in each direction, the monotony of vvhich is only interrupted on the north by a huge disjointed mass of rock near the entrance of Dalden Dene, broken and hollowed into fantastic arches and caverns by the continued attacks of the sea. To the south of the harbour, a similar frag ment is the only conspicuous object that meets the eye. J. Buddie, Esq., in the speech delivered by him on the occasion of laying the foundation stone of this harbour, observed, \" It will become a harbour of refuge, into which vessels may flee for safety in times of difficulty and danger, and will thus be the means of pre serving to their country, the lives of many valuable seamen. The melancholy scene vvhich we witnessed here four years ago, is still fresh in our memories. On this occasion, no fewer than eleven vessels were wrecked within the short space of a mile of the spot on which we now stand, and several lives were lost. I had op portunities of conversing vvith several individuals, who were on board the shipwrecked vessels, and they all expressed their opinion that had the harbour of Seaham been ready to receive them, every one of their un fortunate vessels would have escaped destruction.\""], [524, "380 EASINGTON WARD\u2014 N. D. The approach to the town and harbour is by a new turnpike road from the north-west, which passes over Dalden Dene by means of a wooden bridge. This dene will, however, be progressively filled up, so as to make a level plane from side to side. \" Houses of a superior style to the com mercial part,\" says Mr. Chapman, \"may there be constructed opposite a fine extensive sandy shore from thence to Ryhope, with an excellent access to it. It must, of course, become a superior resort for sea-bathers, on account of the very extensive sand for a drive and the view of the moving scene south of it, with the further advantage of the beautiful and secluded walks in the gardens of the dene.\" In a small indention of the shore, which forms the boundary between the parishes of Dalton-le-Dale and Seaham, a ship-building yard has been commenced. About a mile to the south of the town, is a romantic vale of wood and precipice, of more than a mile in length, which the noble proprietor designs to improve by additional plantations of orna mental shrubs and trees. Mukton-in-the- Whins, A hamlet and constablery to the south-west of Dalton, contains five farmsteads. From an early period to the reign of Elizabeth, the manor and the whole of the vill were the property of the family of Lumley. About 1566, John Lord Lumley abenated the whole manor to his tenants, in eight portions, reserving a free rent of _P21, 6s. 8d., and eight hens, or eight shillings. \"Indenture 20 Feb. 8 Eliz. between John Lumley, Knighte, Lord Lumley \u2014 and Richard Rede, Thomas Younge, Thomas Shadfurth, Anthony Dune, John Gregson, William Unthanke, John Shakloke, and John Robinson, of Morton, husbandmen \u2014 in consideration of \u00a3341, 6s. 8d. to be paid to Lord Lumley, vi?. \u00a3200, &c. ; and the remainder at the Fount-stone of the Temple Church in London, within the howers of one and sower of the clock in the afternoone of St. John Baptist Day, &c.

Cendune, the son of Walter de Morton, gave to the monks of Durham one acre of land, which ever they themselves should chuse out of four acres which. he held in Birfiatt.

The manor and estate were long part of the possessions of the family of Lumley. The tenure was, together with Lumley, by knight's service, homage, and fealty only.

The parish of Seaham is bounded by the townships of Ryhope and Burdon, in the parish of Bishopwearmouth, on the north ; by Eppleton and AVardon Law, in the parish of Houghton-le- Spring, on the west and south-west ; by Dalton-le-Dale on the south ; and by the sea on the east. This parish, in 1821, contained but 42 houses and 195 inhabitants. The value of property assessed to the county-rate, in 1828-9, was \u00a32022. The parish includes two constableries, 1, Seaham, 2, Seaton and Slingley. Seaham. The village of Seaham stands close to the coast. The principal mansion, called Seaham Hall, was long the seat of the family of Milbanke;* but is now, by purchase, the property of the Marquis of Londonderry. Its situation is not naturally very attractive, but has been rendered extremely pleasing by the taste and attention of its successive owners. The grounds are laid out with the most elegant simplicity; and a warm sunny vale to the south, is filled with rising plan tations, which shelter and conceal the garden. There are seven farmsteads in this township ; also a blacksmith's shop, and a mill, the occupier of which keeps an inn on the turnpike road between Sunderland and Easington. Seaham was included in King. Athelstan's donation to the shrine of St. Cuthbert; but, in the course of three centuries, it had, with Seton and Slynglawe, become a freehold manor, the property of two heiresses, Matilda and Hawysia. The former intermarried with Yeland, and the latter with Hadham, between whose descendants some disputes respecting the division of the property seem to have existed, but which were terminated in 1295 by a solemn deed executed in the church of St. Andrew of Seaham. Before 1408, Yeland's moiety had become vested, either by purchase or descent, in the family of Dalden. In 1438, Joan Bromflete, daughter of Aline, sometime wife of William de Dalden, died seized of the moiety of the manor and advowson, held of the bishop by knight's service, and of the annual value of 100s. The same moiety contained the scite of the manor-house, of no value ; five messuages and four cottages, worth 10s. per annum ; 200 acres of arable land, worth 40s. ; five acres of meadow, 10s. ; and 200 acres of pasture, worth 20s. This estate descended with se veral others to Sir William Bowes, Knt., son of Joan Bromflete by her first husband; in whose * Lady Byron, the unfortunate events of whose life are but too well known, is the daughter of the late Sir Ralph Milbanke Noel, of Seaham, Bart- The superior literary and other accomplishments, and the many amiable qualities possessed by this lady, have rendered her deservedly admired and respected by the few whom her unostentatious course of life has permitted to appreciate them. vol. i. 5 E"], [526, "EASINGTON WARD.\u2014 N. D. 382 family it continued till the death of Sir George Bowes of Dalden in 1557 without male issue. On the division of his estates, the moieties of the manors of Seaham and Seaton fell to the share of his eldest daughter and co-heiress, Dorothy, wife of Sir Cuthbert CoUingwood, Knt., whose descendant sold them to Sir Mark Milbanke, Bart. The moieties of Seaham and Seaton held by the Hadhams, continued in that family till the failure of male issue in Thomas Hadham (26th January, 1500-1). His two daughters and co heiresses intermarried with Robert Bamford, Esq. and John Blaykeston. The moiety of Seaham afterwards became, by marriage, the property of the Swinburnes of Nafferton, in Northumber land ; but was shortly after divided into several small freeholds, held by the families of Fell, Martin, Brice, Morgan, and Huntly ; all of which were gradually absorbed by purchase at dif ferent periods, and united to Bowes's moiety of the manor. The whole estate is now the property of the Marquis of Londonderry. The Church. The church is a small fabric, retaining traces of high antiquity. The nave and chancel are each but five paces wide ; but the segment of a lofty round arch, by which they are divided, seems to indicate that the building has been once of considerably larger extent towards the north. The chancel is nine paces in length, and the nave sixteen. At the west end of the nave is a low square tower. All the lights in the nave are narrow and round-headed ; and the east window consists also of two round-headed lights under an ornament of Saxon zigzag or nailhead. The font is a plain stone basin, the rim ornamented with tracery. Over the entrance by the south porch is a sun dial, dated 1113, above which is the following inscription : \u2014 \" The natural clock-work by the mighty One AVound up at first and ever since has gone. No pin drops out, its wheels and springs hold good. It speaks its maker's praise, tho' once it stood ; But that was by the order of the workman's power, And when it stands again it goes no more.\" Randall's MSS. mention a chantry in Seaham church dedicated to the ATirgin : Richard Atkin son cantarista, 1501.

The probability that this coffin contained the remains of Overton, rests on the cir cumstances of the Saxon character and stone coffins being disused in so late an era as the fifteenth century \u2022 it was a degree of elegance used in ancient interments to have such coffins. The body was then wound in fine linens, attired in the most honourable vestments, and laid in spices ; things not suited to mean person ages.

He was born in 1786, at an obscure village called Tunstill, in the north of Yorkshire, where his father was a day-labourer, bur thened with a large family. In his infancy, Joseph was placed under the tuition of the village schoolmistress, and afterwards was removed to a master, under whom he continued to write and learn arithmetic till the age of eleven ; when his brother, a ladies' shoemaker in London, having expressed a desire of taking him as an apprentice, his parents gladly acceded to the proposal, and he set forward by the waggon for the metropolis, was bound by indenture, and commenced his trade. Here his brother endeavoured to improve his scanty education, by keeping him at home to read and write on Sundays, which, though irksome at the time, was undoubtedly of essential service to him. The works which he had an opportunity of perusing in his leisure hours were, Josephus, Eusebius's Ecclesiastical History, Fox's Martyrs, and a few others, chiefly on reli gious subjects. \" At that time,\" says he, in a letter to his friend and protector, stir. Pratt, \" the drama was totally unknown to me, a play I had neither seen nor read ; in fact, I had no desire, until a juvenile friend, who was in the habit of frequenting the theatres, solicited my company to see Kemble play Richard the Third, at Drury Lane. I went, and, having seen, and soon after read, forgot the cruelties exercised in Queen Mary's reign, and left the celebrated Jewish historians and others to be cherished by more permanent admirers. Thus, sir, did the Muse of Shakespeare, with a single glance, banish the ideas of Jerusalem's wars, which memory had carefully coUected, and awakened a desire in my breast to become acquainted vvith no other language than that of nature. To do which, I frequently robbed my pillow of its due, and, in the summer season, would read till the sun had far retired, then wait with anxious expectation for his earliest gleam, to discover to my enraptured fancy the sublime beauties of that great master.\" In this manner did young Blacket continue to cultivate an acquaintance with the Muses, assiduously read ing and studying such authors as came within his reach, and which, luckily for him, happened to be the best among our national poets. He himself enumerates, \" Shakespeare, Milton, Pope, Young, Otway, Rowe, Beattie, Thomson, &c. together with one volume of Arirgil's \u00c6neid, with vvhich I was much delighted, and read with particular attention: indeed, one or other of these authors was constantly in my pocket or under my pillow. I might add the History of the Heathen Gods, and every book that I could either borrow or buy, vvhich I thought likely to improve me on any of my favourite subjects. I do not know whether you may not think it wandering from the objects of my scattered studies to observe, that I have visited most of the exhibitions of painting and sculpture ; and from the subjects of the artist have collected many ideas, which, probably, otherwise I could never have attained.\" On the termination of his apprenticeship, stir. Blacket became a lodger with his brother, whose wife's sister he soon after married. He now prosecuted his business with tolerable success, devoting whatever time he could spare to the study of tragedy and the cultivation of his ideas. After three years of happiness, how ever, his wife died of a lingering illness ; and her sister, who had been sent for from the country to attend her, was confined to her bed by a raging fever. \" Judge of my situation,\" says he ; \"a dear wife stretched on the bed of death ; a sister senseless, whose dissolution in that state I expected every hour ; an infant pite ously looking round for its mother ; creditors clamorous ; friends cold or absent ! I then found, like the melancholy Jaques, that, ' when the deer was stricken, the herd would shun him.' It will not appear strange to you, when informed, that I was under the necessity of disposing of every thing, which I actually did, and, with the sum, discharged a part of the debts I had unavoidably contracted. After the burial of my wife, her sister, thank heaven, recovered ; when, sending my Uttle daughter to a kind friend at Deptford, I quitted the roof of departed happiness with anguish.\" Mr. Blacket now retired to Seaham, where, to alleviate his sufferings in the tediousness of solitude, he beoan to commit to paper some of those thoughts and ideas in which he had indulged in happier hours.

The Rectory. \u2014 From the earliest period of the records, the advowson appears to have been at tached to the manor, and to have been held alternately by the families of Hadham and Yeland. In 1475, the rectory was annexed to the abbey of Coverham, in Yorkshire. In 1490, Bishop Sherwood instituted Robert Chawmer chaplain to the vicarage. The queen presented in 1575, probably in right of the dissolved abbey of Coverham. The patronage was afterwards vested in the noble families of Hickes and Noel, by whom it was conveyed to the family of Robinson, and has now passed to A. J. C. Baker, Esq.

The sum of \u00a310 derived from these legacies is now in the hands of the vicar of Seaham, who received it from the executor of his predecessor ; he pays 10*. yearly as the interest, and distributes it amongst the labouring poor. Seaton and Slingley. Seaton is a little cheerful village, on an easy swell of country, surrounded by green enclosures. It is situated a mile and a half to the west of Seaham, and six miles south-by-west of Sunderland ; and contains a public house. On the summit of the hill, shadowed by a few tall fir trees, is the old mansion of the Middletons, which retains, in its mullioned windows and projecting gables, some traces of the old hall-house of the seventeenth century. There are four farmsteads in Seaton. At an early period, Seaton appears to have formed but one integral manor with Seaham. Half of each vill was allotted to the families of Hadham and Yeland, under the division confirmed in 1295. Hadham's moiety descended, on the failure of male issue in 1501, to John Blakiston, an cestor of a race of resident proprietors who continued in possession till 1635. Contemporary with the latter descents of these, a younger branch of the family of Middleton of Newton Hall held lands here. An estate in Seaton descended from the Wilson family to the late Rev. Wilson Bewick, D. D., of Cassop. Slingley, anciently Slinglaice, is a hill or law to the south-west of Seaton, and includes four farms. This estate has been successively in possession of the Swinburnes, the AAriddringtons, the Collingwoods, and the Dales. Some property here still remains in the family of Carr, as repre sentatives of the Dales of Ryhope and Slingley. * In 1675, Anne, widow of Mr. John Easterbie, had a certificate of her husband's loyalty and sufferings, viz. \" that he was imprisoned, sequestered, and deprived of all he had by the late rebellion ;\" and that the said \" Anne and her children are become poore and fitt objects of publick or private charity.\" vol. i. 5 F"], [530, "EASINGTON WARD \u2014 \u00bb\u00bbea\u00ae-M<\u00bba*\u2014 SOUTH DIVISION.

The Manor. \u2014 Easington was apparently a place of some consequence at a very early date ; as its name is the first which occurs in a grant to Ealfrid, the son of Britulfinc, by Bishop Cutheard. In Lambarde's Dictionary, page 109, it is thus mentioned : \u2014 \" Essington, a manor perteyninge of auncient tyme to the byshopryke of Durham ; for when one Nicholas resigned in tyme of Plenry III. he had this towne, Howden, and Stocton, appointed for his sustentation duringe his life.\" In Boldon Book, Easington is mentioned jointly with Thorp. There were thirty-one villains, who held their lands, and performed their services, like those of Boldon. By that record it appears there were only two free tenants, Simon and Galfrid Cokesmaht, who held each half a carucate of land, and served on the bishop's embassies.

The de mesne was let out ; but the pasture and sheep stock were in the hands of the bishop.

The Halmot is held twice in the year, at which Easington, with Thorpe, Cassop, Shadforth, the Sherburnes, and Shotton, do service. An ciently, the rector held Fillymoor Close, worth \u00a3'7 per annum, on condition of defraying the ex penses of the bishop's seneschal and his attendants. The moors in this parish were enclosed, and divided amongst the freeholders, copyholders, and leaseholders, between the years 1656 and 1665.f Easington. Easington is a considerable village, which gives name to the Deanery and AVard. It stands in an elevated situation, on the high road from Stockton to Sunderland, 10 miles north ofthe former, and 17 miles south of the latter town. The land gradually inclines towards the sea, from which Easington is above a mile distant. The Wesleyan Methodists have a chapel, and the Primitive Methodists a meeting-room here. In 1814, Archdeacon Prosser erected a parish-school in this village, which, by his benevolence and other contributions, now affords education, on Dr. Bell's system, to 50 boys and 30 girls, for one penny per week each. There are, besides, two day-schools * These were, William de SwalweUs, AViUiam Fairhe, Janyn de Thorpe, John Burdon, John AVatson, Thomas Menvill.

There are thirty farms in the constablery of Easington, Thorpe, and Horden. The Church The church stands on an eminence at the west end of the town, and, from its conspicuous situa tion, serves as a sea-mark for mariners. It consists of a nave, two side-aisles, a chancel, and a square tower and belfry at the west end of the nave. The chancel measures 42 feet by 20 ; the nave is 63 feet in length, and 46 in width, including the aisles ; the latter are 9 feet wide ; and the tower rises about 60 feet. The east window is divided into three lights, under a pointed arch, with rose-work tracery ; and there are three other windows on the south side of the chancel, each divided into two lights, under pointed arches. The chancel is divided from the nave by a pointed arch, rising from corbels, and closed by a neat screen, ornamented with foliage and open work in oak. Two uniform aisles are formed by three light pillars on each side of the nave, supporting pointed arches. On the south side, two of the pillars are octagonal and one round ; and on the north, two are round and one octagonal. The nave is lighted by three windows in the south aisle, each divided into two pointed lights under square labels, and by four upper windows on each side of the nave. The tower is supported by a circular arch, now concealed by a flat modern ceiling. The old south door has been closed up, and an entrance made through the south side of the tower, under the belfry.* Certain stalls, in the south aisle of this church, are called the Pespool Seats. On the same side, also, are stalls belonging to the Horden estate, now the property of Rowland Burdon, Esq. ; and opposite to them are stalls belonging to High Eden estate, the property of Lord Durham. Chantries. \u2014 There were two chantries in the church of Easington. The chantry of St. Mary was of very ancient date. Bishop Richard de Marisco gave to it the service of South AVysle, viz. for the support of one chaplain to celebrate mass daily at the altar of the Blessed A^irgin of Esing ton; and to which Bishop Nicholas added a toft in Easington, and a meadow called the Fletes. Adam Neuman alienated without licence a messuage and 21 acres in Little Eden, worth 10s. per annum, in mortmain, to the chantry of the Blessed Mary of Easington. At the dissolution, this chantry was valued at \u00a34, Ils. 4d. George BurneU, the last incumbent, had a pension of \u00a34, which he received in 1553.

The testator endowed this chantry with the rents of a messuage and nine acres of land in Easington ; the moiety of a messuage and 16 acres also in Easington, lately purchased of Christopher Conyers, of Horden, Esq.; another messuage and 30 acres there, late belonging to Raufe Garry ; and an out-rent of 60s. granted by Hugh prior of Durham, out of all the lands of the prior and convent in Castle-Eden, by deed, 26th September, 1526; -of all vvhich lands and rents WiUiam Frankleyn, archdeacon of Duresme, John Bentley, of Trillesden, Thomas Bentley, Clerk, and Christofer Browne, stood seized for the use of John Jackson during life, and afterwards for the uses above limited in his will.

In 1256, Bishop AValter Kirkham collated Robert de St. Agatha, arch deacon of Durham, to the rectory of Easington ; and, by the same instrument, decreed the perpe tual union of the rectory and archdeaconry, which have ever since remained united. At the general array of the clergy in 1400, the rector of Easington, though one of the most wealthy in cumbents in the diocese, is returned \" Rector de Easington onerafur suffcienter ,-\" probably as archdeacon, in which capacity he had the charge and conduct of the clerical levies. In 1501, Bishop Fox granted licence to Archdeacon Roger Leyburn to enclose 40 acres of the glebe of his church of Easington, lying near Le Hallefeld, with free passage to and from a pond upon the moor. This rectory suffered severely during the civil wars. Dr. Gabriel Clarke was expelled from it, by the Parliamentary Visitors, as a Malignant ; when Philip Nesbett, a Scotchman, intruded him self into Easington church under the title of Minister Verbi Dei. \"October 26, 1645, the Na tional Covenant was taken by the parishioners of Easington, according to an order directed by the Honble the Standing Committee at Newcastle to the Minister for the time being, Philip Nesbett.\" The parish appears to have been partly influenced by Nicholas Heath, of Eden, and Thomas Midford, of Pespool; two gentlemen of considerable estate, who embraced the parliamentary in terest, and, with their neighbour, Thomas Shadforth, of Eppleton, acted in all the committees of sequestration. Dr. Clarke survived the Restoration. In 1662, Bishop Cosin gave the archdeaconry and rectory to his son-in-law, Dr Denis Gran viUe,* who was succeeded by the Lion. Robert Booth, whose family had suffered during the two * Denis Granville, (or Grenville) D. D., was the youngest son of the loyal and valiant Sir Bevil Gran ville, and brother to John, the first Earl of Bath of that family. After a suitable education, he was admitted a fellow commoner of Exeter College, Oxford, in September, 1657- On the 28th of September, 1660, he was created Master of Arts ; and soon after, marrying Anne, youngest daughter of Bishop Cosin, that pre late collated him to this living, and to the first prebend in the Cathedral church, which he exchanged for the second, April 16, 1668. He had also, in the stead ofthe rectory of Elwick, the living of Sedgefield; and was chaplain in ordinary to Charles II. On the 20th of December, 1670, he was created Doctor in Di vinity; and on the 14th December, 1684, was installed dean of Durham. From the directions given to his curates, printed among his works, it might be implied that he was exemplary in his attention to the duties of those livings ; but a volume of his MS. letters, in the dean and chapter library, prove him to have been a high-spirited man, with a strong dash of the Cavalier; fitter for courts or camps than for the cloister of a cathedral. In his youth, at least, he was perpetually involved, from systematic imprudence, in pecuniary embarrassments; and, in 1670, he was openly arrested for debt within the cloisters at the door of the ca thedral, as he was coming from a public funeral in his decanal habit, and carried to gaol. He pleaded his privilege as chaplain in ordinary to his majesty ; and the bailiffs concerned in the arrest were all ordered be fore the council board. Bishop Cosin, in his letters, frequently complains of his son-in-law's extravagance, of his non-residence, his dangling after the court, and trifling away his time at Oxford with his Doctorated Curate- This last named personage was \u2014 Davis, Dr. Granville's curate at Easington, who had taken a Doctor in Divinity's degree at Oxford at the same time with his master; a piece of presumption in a curate highly resented by the bishop. Dr. Granville warmly advocated the doctrines of passive obedience and non-resistance, and the unlimited extent of the royal prerogative ; and on the arrival of AVilliam, Prince of Orange, he opposed all the measures taken by the AVhigs to the utmost of his power, by preaching, delivering charges to the clergy, sending up an address to King James, and subscribing a sum of money for his service. On the failure of the Stuart cause, he chose, rather than submit to King AVilliam, to lose his great preferments, and retire into a vo luntary exile. Quitting Durham on the 11th December, 1688, he arrived the 19th of March following, at Honfleur, in France. In February, 1689, he took a hazardous journey to England, whereby he got a smaU supply of money, to subsist abroad. His brother, the Earl of Bath, (who had espoused the interest of the Prince of Orange) endeavoured for some time to secure his revenues ; but as no considerations whatever"], [535, "EASINGTON. 391 late reigns for a steady attachment to principles directly opposite to those of his predecessor. In 1730, George Sayer, A. M., was inducted to the living; foUowed, in 1762, by Samuel Dickins, D. D. ; on whose death, in 1791, Benjamin Pye, D. D., was collated. He died in 1808, when Richard Prosser, D. D., prebendary of the third stall in Durham cathedral, was collated to the archdea conry and rectory. On his resignation, he was succeeded by the Rev. Charles Thorpe, A. sti. The rectory of Easington is not in charge nor certified, being annexed to the archdeaconry. The glebe consists of between 500 and 600 acres of land ; and the rector is generaUy entitled to great and small tithe throughout the parish, with the exception of the prescript rents of Haw thorn, Horden, Eden HaU, and Edderacres, mentioned hereafter. The rector pays 5s. annually to the bishop for Pilmire Close, and \u00a34 for the expense of two Halmot-court dinners, and for de fraying the charge of the bishop's seneschal. He also pays \u00a31, Ils. to the churchwardens of the poor of Gateshead, for a stripe of land within the precincts of the rectory ; \u00a32, 3s. 4d. to Kepyer School, due at Michaelmas; and a fee-farm rent of \u00a34, out of which the land-tax is deducted: and he receives \u00a31, 6s. 8d. cottage-rents, is entitled to the kelp on his sea-rocks, and occasionally holds a court for the manor of the rectory of Easington. The Rectory-house stands a little to the north of the church, and is shaded by a grove of syca mores. It has been much improved by the two last archdeacons, and is now one of the most con venient parsonages of the diocese. A deserted oratory, with one large west window, under a pointed arch, stands a little to the north of the house; and some other remains of ancient build ings are still visible. Charities. Charities of Wardell and another. \u2014 In the Parliamentary Returns of 1786 it is stated that Thomas Ro binson gave \u00a3100 to the poor of Easington, and that Richard Wardell, in 177L gave \u00a3100 to the same use. It appears that the first-mentioned sum of \u00a3100 was not in fact the gift of the above-named Thomas Robin son, but that a close in Hawthorn, called the Poors Close, and containing about five acres, of which he was the acting trustee, and the rents of which had theretofore been given to the poor, was sold about 50 years ago, with the consent of the parishioners, for \u00a3100. This sum, vvith the amount of the legacy left by Richard AVardell, is now secured, with interest at five per cent., on mortgage of the tolls of the turnpike road leading from Newcastle to Bishopwearmouth. The interest is distributed in the church on Candlemas could induce him to swear allegiance to King William and Queen Mary, he was at length deprived of all his preferments, February 1, 1690. He not only refused himself, but likewise did all in his power to deter, or rather to terrify others from taking the oaths, by representing the revolution as a rebellion and usurpation. Having no prospect, after King James's defeat in Ireland, of recovering his benefices, he repaired to the ab dicated monarch's court, at St. Germain's ; where, though he had reason to expect an uncommonly kind re ception, yet, because he was a Protestant, he was soon obliged to retire, not only from court, but also from the town. It is said, that upon the death of Dr. Lamplugh, he had the empty title of Archbishop of York conferred upon him by King James. In 1695, he came incognito to England, where he found no encourage ment to make any stay. Having for some years suffered under an indifferent state of health, he died at his lodgings in Paris, the 8th of April, 1703, aged 64, and was buried at the lower end of the church-yard of the Holy Innocents in that city. His nephew, Lord Lansdown, vvith the partiality of a relative, draws his character in the following words : \u2014 \" Sanctity sate so easy, so unaffected, and so graceful upon him, that in him we beheld the y/ery beauty of holiness. He was as cheerful, as familiar, as condescending in his con versation, as he was strict, regular, and exemplary in his piety ; as well-bred and accomplished as a courtier, and as reverend and venerable as an apostle.

Township of Hawthorn. \u2014 School. \u2014 Robert Forster, by an Instrument, bearing date 24th November, 1736, directed that \u00a3200 should be put out at interest in such manner as the Friends of the quarterly meet ing of Durham should think proper, and the interest paid to a schoolmaster or mistress of Hawthorn, for teaching 24 poor scholars, such as Nicholas Dodshon and AVarren Maude, their executors and assigns, should order ; and he desired that the Friends, at their quarterly meeting, should from time to time choose a master or mistress of their Society, if any fitting person of such description should offer, and if not, such othe_e master or mistress as should not bring a charge on the township of Hawthorn, and that they should have the power of removing any schoolmaster or mistress when necessary. In respect of this charity, there is now standing in the names of James Backhouse, John Pease, Thomas Mounsey, and Thomas Richardson, the sum of \u00a3255, in the new four per cents, producing annual dividends to the amount of \u00a310, 4s. There is also a school and dwelling-house for the residence of the master or mistress, vvith a small garden, stated to have been given for this purpose by the above-named Robert Forster. The yearly sum of \u00a310 is received by Thomas Richardson, of Bishopwearmouth, at one of tlie quarterly meetings of Friends, held at Newcastle, and he pays the amount to a schoolmistress at Hawthorn, who teaches 14 children reading, writing, and accounts, and the girls needle-work in addition. The expenses of repairing the school-premises are defrayed by the Society of Friends. The children are selected by the schoolmistress chiefly, subject to the control of a committee appointed by the monthly meeting, who also occasionally visit the school. Township of Shotton Walton's Charity. \u2014 A school is kept in this township, in a house given for that purpose by Edward AValton, a member of the Society of Friends ; and the master resides in it rent-free, and has also the use of a garden belonging thereto. Out of the income, amounting to \u00a330 per annum, a salary of \u00a320 is paid to the master, and for this sum he instructs 20 children, boys or girls, who are selected by the visiting committee appointed by the monthly meeting of Friends at Newcastle. These children are supplied with books and stationary from the charity-funds. At the time ofthe Commissioners' Inquiry, there was a balance of \u00a313, 10s. in the hands of Thomas Richardson, of Bishopwearmouth, one of the Society of Friends ; and it was intended to apply this sum in placing out apprentices, no part of the income having been hitherto applied to this purpose. The residue of the income had been applied in repairing the school premises.* Little Thorp, or Thorp-nigh-Easington, is a hamlet about a mile to the south of Easincrton, and included in the same manor and township.

The manor of Horden, together with the vills of Ravensworth, Blackiston, and Hetton, was granted by Ralph Flambard, Bishop of Durham, after the accession of Henry I., to his nephew, Richard,* from whose descendant, Marmaduke, the family afterwards assumed the name of Fitz- Marmaduke. John Fitz-Marmaduke, in 1300, was one of the barons who signed the memorable letter to Pope Boniface, asserting the independence of the English crown, and refusing to submit their sovereign's claim of paramount authority over the realm of Scotland to the arbitration of any foreign power. He continued in the wars of Scotland until 1311, when he died, being at that time governor of St. John's Town, Perth. Having requested that his remains might be interred within the precincts of Durham Cathedral, his domestics, to avoid the risk of conveying them through the hostile country between Perth and the English Border, dismembered the body, boiled the flesh from the bones in a huge cauldron, and preserved the relics till an opportunity offered of transmitting them with safety to the place of destination. f For this outrage against a canon of the church (the promulgation of which had been rendered necessary by the frequency of such prac tices), the Cardinal Berengarius, Bishop of Tusculum, imposed on the offenders the mild penance of attending their master's obsequies in the cemetery of the cathedral of Durham, having first in terposed the authority of the church to insure the quiet transportation of the relics. Richard Fitz-Marmaduke, son and heir of John, was seneschal of the bishopric, and inherited from his father the manors of Horden, Ravensworth, Lamesly, Silksworth, Ulnaby, and Carle bury ; and from his mother, Isabel, sister of Robert Bruce, the manor of Stranton. \" In the year 1318, there fell out in the bishoprick a most strange and detestable action ; for as Richard Mar-, meduc, seneschall to the Bishop of Durham, did ride to hold the county court, he was slain upon the Old Bridge of Durham, by his kinsman, Robert Neville.''^ The manors of Horden and Car lebury were now settled on Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, who granted the former to Sir \u2014 Holland.

The last of the Claxton family possessed of Horden, noted in the inquisitions, was Sir Robert Claxton, Knt, in the seventh year of Bishop Dudley, who, leaving four co-heiresses, Elizabeth the third daughter married Richard Conyers, to whom the manor went in the partition of her father's estates.

Hawthorn, A village about a mile to the north of Easington, and nearly an equal distance from the sea, is pleasantly situated on a dry hill. The township contains twelve farms, a corn-mill, and a public house. Hawthorn Dene descends to the coast, and terminates in a deep, narrow ravine. The sea shore is rocky, and broken into a multitude of deep caverns ; whilst the offing is also full of rocks and shoals, so that in stormy weather its appearance is of the most terrific description. Near the mouth of the dene, where the rocks are the most broken, rugged, and romantic, Admiral Milbanke-!\" built a summer retreat, which he called Sailor's Hall. On its becoming the property of the late Major Anderson, of Newcastle, that gentleman erected, near the same scite, an elegant mansion in the Gothic style, distinguished by the name of Hawthorn Hive Cottage. It commands an ex tensive view of this wild and dangerous coast. \" The placidness of a summer's evening calm,\" says Hutchinson, \" when the moon is reflected on the smooth bosom of the ocean, is highly pleasing * Inq. p. m.

The first person mentioned in the pedigree of this family, according to tradition, was cup-bearer to Mary, Queen of Scots, and, in consequence of fighting a duel, was obliged to fly to England for safety, and pur chased an estate at Chirton, near North Shields. His great-grandson, Mark, was mayor of Newcastle in 1658 and 1672, and married one ofthe wealthy daughters and co-heirs of Ralph Cock, alderman of New castle (familiarly called \" Cock's canny hinnies\"). His eldest son, Mark Milbanke, was nominated for a Knight ofthe Royal Oak on the Restoration, and created a baronet 7th August, 1661. He died in 1680. The late Sir Ralph Noel, of Halnaby, co.

On the north side of the creek, and immediately below the Cottage, a fine bayr, called Hawthorn Hive, is formed by a natural rocky projection, called the Skaw, and by the addition of a pier, might be converted into a basin of 40 acres, where vessels might ride out a storm in safety, or wait the coming of the flowing tide. In the months of October and November, the wind is generally westerly, so that the light colliers, in their passage from London to Sunderland or Shields, \"hug the land\" as much as they can, and have frequently to \"lay to\" off' the Hive to wait for the tide; but, if the wind \"chops about\" to the east or east-north-east, they are immediately driven ashore amongst the rocks, where they are generally dashed to pieces, and the crews left without hope of succour.* Bishop Ranulf granted Hagathorne to AArilliam, the son of Ranulf, whose descendants assumed the name of Herrington. Bishop Hugh confirmed the donation to Thomas, the son of AViUiam. At an early period, the Merleys, the Lumleys, and some other families, held lands here; but the chief property, and which was afterwards considered as manorial, belonged successively to the Me nevills, Claxtons, and Radclyff'es, the latter of whom disposed of the whole to divers persons.

The crew having been refreshed with every necessary comfort at the major's house, departed after gratefully thanking their preservers; and so affected were the feelings of the captain's wife, that, on the following day she visited Hawthorn Hive Cottage, where she, with streaming eyes, expressed her gratitude, and falling upon her knees, kissed the dog which had been so essentially instrumental in saving her husband and his crew. t \" 1532, The 25. of May was taken betweene London and Greenwich two great fishes, called horlepooles. \" 1552, The 8. of August were taken at Queenbrough iii great fishes called dolphins : and the weeke fol lowing at Blacke wall, were sixe more taken and brought to London. \" The seuenth of October were three great fishes called whirlepools taken at Grauesend, which were drawne up to the Kinge's bridge at AVestminster. \"1568, The eleuenth of October were taken in Suffolke at Downam Bridge 17- monstrous fishes, some of them 27- foot in length. \" 1573, The 6. of July in the Isle of Thanet a monstrous fish ofthe sea did shoote himselfe on shore, where for want of water beating himselfe on the sands he died.

He treated the bishop, who wished to save a sinner more than to recover his possessions, with the utmost contempt, and uttered the most profane blasphemies against St. Cuthbert. \" Why do you threaten me,\" he said, \" with your dead man ? I swear by the power of my gods I will be a fearful enemy both to this dead man and all of you.\" St. Cuthbert, thus braved and threatened, exerted his miraculous powers, and, just as the caitiff was entering the church to pillage the holy shrines, nailed him by both feet to the threshold.

After the Conquest, Eden was the lordship of Robert de Brus, who granted the chapel to the monks of St. Cuthbert, with all tithes and parochial dues, upon condition that within four years the prior of St. Cuthbert should build a chapel within the vill, and procure it to be consecrated. This charter is probably the origin of the parochial church of Eden, and the name of Castle-Eden may be derived from the manorial residence. Eustace de Eden afterward gave half his land here to St. Cuthbert, and 10s. out-rent from the moiety which he reserved. This donation he made in discharge of 17 marks which the monks of Durham had paid to release him from Leo the Jew of York.* By seven several charters, William de Turp (Thorpe, a local name from a neighbouring hamlet) gave as many donations of land in Eden to the church of Durham. The situation of some of these grants may still be traced. \" It may be amusing,\" says Surtees, \" to reflect for a moment on the state in which these grants represent a district still wild and romantic, six centuries ago. The Castle (of which the certain scite cannot now be traced, but which doubtless stood near to the vill, the chapel, and the lake) towering above dark ancient woods; the Chapel almost hid on the edge of its little dene; and a few huts huddled together for protection round the mansion of their * \" It was not unusual for monastic bodies to interfere, and release the persons or properties of their lay brethren from the ruinous contracts which they had made (frequently to defray their expenses in a Crusade) with the Jews.

The monastics, it must be added, took good care to be repaid ; and, in an age when specie was so little abundant and paper credit un- known, the debtor had no means of payment but by separating a portion de cespile vivo.\" \u2014 Surtees, vol. i. p. 41. The efforts of the Jews in that age to overreach their tyrants, and the barbarities to vvhich they were sub jected in return, have been rendered familiar by the author of Ivanhoe; but perhaps the following extracts from \" A Summarie of English Chronicles\" may not be uninteresting: \u2014 \"1190, The Jewes of Norwich, Saint Edmonds-burie, Lincolne, Stamford, and Linne were robbed. And at Yorke to the number of fiue hundred, beside women and children, entred a tower of the castle, which the people assailing, the Jewes cut the throats of their wiues and children, and cast them ouer the wailes on the Christians heads, the residue they locked up, and burnt both the house and themselves. \"1209, The king (John) commanded all the Jewes both men and women to be imprisoned, because he would haue their money. \" 1235, The Jewes of Norwich stale a boy, and circumcised him, minding to haue crucified him at Easter, for vvhich fact they were conuicted.\" And, 1255, \" 142 Jewes were brought to AVestminster, vvhich were accused of crucifying a childe at Lincolne, eighteen of them were hanged, the rest remained long prisoners. \" 1243, The Jewes were constrained to pay 20000 marks at two tearmes in the yeare, or else to be kept in perpetuall prison. \" 1263, There was slaine Jewes at London to the number of 700, the rest were spoiled and their Syna gogue defaced, because one Jew would haue forced a Christian man to haue paid more theu three-pence for the vsury of twentie shillings a weeke. \"1291, The king (Edward I.) banished all the Jewes out of England, giuing them to beare their charges till they were out of this realme, the number of Jews then expulsed, were 15 sti. 9 persons.\" vol. 1. 5 K"], [546, "402 EASINGTON AVARD.\u2014 S.

Peter, son of Peter de Brus, confirmed this grant ; as did Bishop AA'alter de Kirkham in 1295. The church of Durham, however, still retained the chapel of St. James, vvith a considerable portion of land in Eden, part of which was rented by the family of Claxton.

The neck of this vase is narrow ; and from the body proceed a number of short tubes of singular form, all closed at the extremity. The mouth was applied to a human skull so near the surface as to leave the bottom of the vase exposed in the gutter of the hedge. The body had been deposited horizontally, with the head towards the east, and had been covered vvith a heap of common field stones. The labourer represented the skull and bones as appearing entire ; but he was prevented by the clergyman of Castle-Eden from making any further research. The ground was, however, again opened soon after by Mr. Burdon's direction ; and a cavity was discovered beneath the cairn, or heap of stones, large enough to contain a body of ordinary dimensions, with a quantity of deep-coloured soil, the ashes probably of the bones which had mouldered on the admission of the air. The vase was full of earth, and when emptied appeared to retain a subtle aromatic smell. Though the place of discovery is almost exactly the spot where the. grant of AViUiam de Thorp fixes the cemetery of the ancient chapel of St. James in the twelfth century, yet the manner of sepulture seems to belong to a more remote period. Similar vases have been found at Chatteris in the Isle of Ely, and in AViltshire ; the latter in a barrow decidedly British. Their object was probably to contain spices buried vvith the dead. At Castle-Eden is preserved the cup of the last abbot of Bury, a spacious goblet of Dutch glass, hand somely mounted in silver, but without any inscription. A cover of silver has been added, in good taste, by its latter owners. After the dissolution, the cup fell into the hands of the family of Reeve, of Suffolk, and came by descent to the late owner of Castle-Eden. t \" 27 Eliz.

After a century and a half of non resident proprietors, Mr. Burdon found the estate waste and uninclosed, the chapel in ruins, and not a vestige remaining of the mansion-house. He inclosed and improved the iands, rebuilt the church from the ground, and erected Castle-Eden House, an extensive mansion, remarkable for the simple elegance of its structure, and situated on an eminence, commanding a good land and sea prospect.

He was elected member of parliament for the county of Durham in 1790, and in the two following parliaments. The turnpike-road from Stockton to Sunderland was procured by his exertions ; but the most magnificent production of his genuine patriotism is the cast-iron bridge at Sunderland. In 1791, he brought the subject before parliament ; and in the following year, with some difficulty, obtained an act for its erection. After having caused an experimental rib to be cast, and set up by Messrs. Walkers, of Rotheram, under the direction of stir. Thomas AVilson, Mr. Burdon brought forward a proposal to the town of Sunderland, and the county, for constructing a bridge, on his principles, over the Wear. This proposal was adopted, and the foundation-stone was laid by stir. Burdon on the 24th September, 1793 ; when a very splendid procession took place, in which the Provincial Grand Lodge of Free Masons, in the county of Dur- ham, sustained a distinguished part. After attending divine service, the procession moved through the town to the crowded banks of the river, over which they passed by a platform made on keels, to the north- west part of the intended bridge. Here stir. Burdon addressed the surrounding multitude in an able and interesting speech, expressive ofthe nature, the difficulties, and the progress ofthe undertaking. On these topics he expatiated with spirit and sensibility, and concluded with an animated apostrophe to that Great Power vvhich had impressed him with confidence to attempt this vast work, and to whose protection he sub- mitted its future progress and accomplishment. The stone having been laid vvith the usual ceremonies, the grand honours were given, and a salute of 21 guns was fired. The interesting nature of the occasion \u2014 the splendour and solemnity of the ceremony \u2014 the steep banks of the river, covered with many thousands of spectators\u2014 the surrounding ships manned from the masts' heads to the water's edge \u2014 the discharge of cannon, sounds of instruments, and shouts ofthe applauding spectators, impressed a sensation so sublime and affect- ing, as will not be easily forgotten by any who had the happiness to witness the imposing grandeur of that day. The Rev. stir. Nesfield delivered a most animated address, and the procession returned across the AA'ear to the Sea Captain's Lodge. Mr. Burdon subscribed \u00a330,000 towards the completion of this grand undertaking ; and on the opening of the bridge for general use, August 9, 17^6, in the presence of His Royal Highness the Duke of Gloucester, he was appointed, pro tempore, provincial grand master at a very splendid masonic ceremony and procession. In October, 1806, stir. Burdon declined the representation of the county, stating, in an address to the freeholders, \" Circumstances over vvhich I could exercise no control, and which have made me the victim of misplaced confidence, oblige me, notwithstanding the earnest solicitation of many highly respectable friends, to decline acceding to their wishes.\" Although, when in parliament, he did not cut a shining figure as an orator, yet as a practical man of business he stood second to none ; but the unfortunate failure of the bank of Surtees and Co. ruined the useful pursuits of this truly great man. His personal appearance is that of a stout, independent Englishman; and, while he possesses all the accomplishments ofthe truly polished gen tleman, the mild and benevolent cast of his features attracts the esteem and respect of all who approach him. As a commercial man, he is known and respected by the wealthiest merchants of the Tyne, Tees, and AVear. The philanthropy, the public spirit, and the integrity of stir. Burdon, have, notwithstanding his retirement, rendered his name deservedly popular in the county of Durham ; and have secured him a reputation which, totally independent of party feeling, will outlive all the ephemeral distinctions of mere rank and station."], [548, "404 EASINGTON WARD.\u2014 S.

The history of the chapel of St. James of Eden, founded by Robert Brus, and afterwards ap propriated to the priory of Gisburne, has been included in the history of the manor. The present building was erected in 1764 by Rowland Burdon, Esq., the elder ; and his successor has enlarged it by the addition of two uniform aisles. It is remarkably neat and well lighted ; and the font, the bason of which is oval, is of beautiful marble. The spire forms a handsome object in the park. A Bible by BaskerviUe, two folio Prayer Books, a silver flaggon, a chalice, and a paten for the altar, are all the gifts of the late and present patron.

This parish is bounded by Castle-Eden on the north, by the sea on the east, by the parish of Hart on the south, and by KeUoe on the west. It contains four townships: 1. Monk-Hesleden ; 2. Hulam, or Holom ; 3. Hutton-Henry ; and, 4. Sheraton. The whole parish, in 1821, contained 93 houses and 470 inhabitants. The value of property assessed to the county-rate in 1828-9 was \u00a3?4556, 4s. 3d. Monk-Hesleden. Bishop AA7illiam de Carilepho granted Monk-Hesleden to the prior and convent of Durham ; from which circumstance, and from its deep dene covered with hazels, it probably derived its name. On the dissolution of the greater monastries, the possessions of the convent in Hesleden became vested in the crown. The advowson of the vicarage and the great tithes were restored to the new Cathedral Church of Durham; and Queen Elizabeth granted Hesleden HaU to Robert Bowes, of Barnes, Esq., a faithful servant of the crown during the Northern Rebellion. By him it was conveyed, in 1572, to Nicholas Tweddell, in whose descendants it continued until 1759, when John Tweddell, of Hesleden Hall, master and mariner, Grace his wife, and Hannah Twed dell his mother, joined in a sale of Hesleden HaU to Rowland Burdon, Esq., for .\u00a31385, reserving i?20 a year rent-charge to Hannah Tweddell for life, and two garths in Hesleden to John Tweddell and his heirs for ever.* * The Tweddells of Threepwood, co. Northumberland, are descended from this family. John Twed dell, one of the most enterprizing and accomplished scholars of the age, was born at that place June 1, 1769. His father, Francis Tweddell, Esq., was an able and intelligent magistrate; and his mother was a most elegant and sensible woman, singularly well qualified to \"teach the young idea how to shoot.\" At the age of nine years, he was sent to school at Hartforth, near Richmond, under the superintendance ofthe Rev. Matthew Raine (father of the late learned Dr. Raine, of the Charter-house), who soon dis covered, and carefully cherished, the rare endowments possessed by his pupil. He afterwards spent some time under the immediate tuition of the Rev. Dr. Samuel Parr, whose store of pre-eminent learning was not opened iu vain to an ardent and capacious mind. He was matriculated of Trinity College, Cambridge, where, in 1788, he gained all the three medals of Sir William Brown; and, the following year, he gained two of the three. In 1790, he took his bachelor's degree, and gained one of the chancellor's prize medals. The vol. i. 5 L"], [550, "406 EASINGTON WARD\u2014 S. D. In 1612 (10 James I.), certain lands and tenements in Hesleden were granted to William Whit more, Esq., and Jonas Verdon, Gent., both of London ; who, two years afterwards, granted them, next year he obtained one ofthe members' prizes, as a middle bachelor. In 1792, he was chosen a fellow of his college, and obtained one of the members' prizes as senior bachelor. Such uncommon proficiency in his academical course procured him unprecedented honours. The \" Prolusiones Juveniles,\" which were pub lished in 1793, furnish an ample and unequivocal testimony to the extent and versatility of his talents, and drew forth the warmest expressions of admiration from Professor Heyne, of Goettingen, in a letter addressed to Dr. Burgess, the learned Bishop of St. David's. In 1792, stir. Tweddell entered himself a student of the Middle Temple ; but the study of the law could not be congenial to a mind of such vivacity and playful ness, and so exquisitely alive to the beauties of poetic fiction, and the graces of classical composition : yet, from deference to the wishes of his father, he paid considerable attention to his professional studies. It ap pears, however, from the records of his private sentiments, his constant intercourse vvith English history, and his decided predilection for political economy, that he would have wished to employ his talents and cul tivated address in diplomacy at the courts of foreign powers. AVith a view to this object, stir. Tweddell determined to travel, and employ a few years in acquiring a knowledge of the manners, policy, and characters, of the principal courts and most interesting countries of Europe, which the war had not yet rendered inaccessible to an Englishman. Accompanied by stir. AVebb, a gentleman of fortune, he embarked for Hamburgh, September 24, 1795. After being actively employed for three months in studying the French and German languages in that city, he proceeded to Berlin, where he was distinguished by the British ambassador, Lord Elgin, caressed by the court, and admired by the ac complished and interesting Marquise de Naduillac. At Vienna, too, his literary leisure was spent in enjoying the amenities of female converse, which for him had the highest charms ; and his most intimate acquaintance was the elegant Duchess de Guise. He traversed the whole of Switzerland, like a philosopher, a painter, and a poet, on foot, and alone, for his plan had frightened his companion. In this picturesque and interest ing country, his friends were the distinguished Lavater, the venerable Necker, and his highly-gifted daugh ter, the celebrated Madame de Stael, and of whom Tweddell said, \" she had more wit than any man or woman he ever saw.\" After spending some time with Count Rumford, he passed into the Ukraine. Here he be came an inmate of the Comtesse Potaska, met the Duke de Polignac and family, and was introduced to Marshal Suwarrow and the Count de Choiseul. From Tnlezyn he proceeded in 179/ to Moscow, where he witnessed the coronation of the emperor, experienced the friendship of Sir Charles (afterwards Lord) AVhit worth, and was introduced to Stanislaus, the last king of Poland. From Moscow he proceeded to Peters burgh, passed into Sweden by Finland, and across the gulf of Bothnia. He next returned to Petersburgh, again traversed Russia, travelled through the Crimea, and then went to Constantinople, where he remained some time, acquiring the language of modern Greece, and observing the character and manners of the various races of men that inhabit this singular and celebrated city. This indefatigable traveller afterwards proceeded to Greece, where he obtained the liberation of the French traveller Fauvel, in a manner highly honourable to his character. After visiting Plat\u00e6a, Thebes, Livadea, Charonea, Thermopyl\u00e6, and Larissa, and taking an excursion to Mount Athos, he returned to Athens, where, from excessive fatigue, he was attacked by spasms in the chest and a fever, which terminated his invaluable life. He died July 25, 1799, in the arms of M. Fauvel ; and his remains were deposited in the Theseum, vvith a beautiful Greek inscription by the Rev. Robert AValpole, A. M. of Carrow Abbey, near Norwich. In person, Mr. Tweddell was of the middle stature, of a handsome and well-proportioned figure. His countenance was animated and interesting, and his eye remarkably soft and intelligent. His address was polished, affable, and prepossessing in a high degree ; and there was in his whole appearance an air of dig- nified benevolence, vvhich pourtrayed at once the suavity of his nature and the independence of his mind. In conversation, he had a talent so peculiarly his own, as to form a very distinguishing feature of his cha- racter. A chastened and ingenious wit, which could seize on an incident in the happiest manner \u2014 a lively fancy, which could clothe the choicest ideas in the best language \u2014 these, supported by a large acquaintance with men and books, together vvith the further advantages of a melodious voice, and a playfulness of manner singularly sweet and engaging, rendered him the delight of every company : his power of attraction- friend- ships was, indeed, remarkable ; and in securing them he was equally happy. The Rev. Robert Tweddell has published a very interesting volume, entitled, \" Remains of the late John Tweddell,\" &c- with a republication of his Prolusiones Juveniles, 1815, 4to. But no information can be obtained respecting his valuable journals, papers, and drawings, which were forwarded to the British am- bassador at Constantinople, though the most urgent and diligent endeavours have been made by Mr. Twed- deh's friends to recover them. \u2014 See Mackenzie's Hist, of Northumberland, vol. ii. p. 264."], [551, "HESLEDEN. 407 ifi various parcels, to WiUiam and Michael Jurdeson, of Easington and Hart ; to Henry Nichol son and William Watson, of Great Hooton, yeomen ; to Robert Porrett, of Hartlepoole, Gent., and George Thompson, of Shotton, yeoman ; and to John Burdon, of Easington, yeoman, and Thomas Burdon, of Shotton.

He was returned as well affected to the parliament, and was employed in sequestrating the estates of his loyal neighbours.

By charter without date, the prior and convent of Durham granted to their chaplain, William de Redmarshall, ten marks annually. The land belonging to the church was valued at one mark, and the remaining nine marks were rendered payable, in two equal portions, at the feasts of St. Martin and Pentecost. The vicar was bound to minister in the church in person, and to provide another chaplain to officiate as deacon. By an additional charter, it seems that the land of one mark value, granted as above, was attached to the chapel of Herdwyck. In 1325, the prior and convent granted an augmentation to the vicar of Hesilden, in consideration of the losses which the vicarage had sustained from the incursions of the Scots, viz. \" the croft which abutts on the vicar's garden ; common of pasture for two horses, three cows and their calves of one year, four swine, and fifty sheep, within the demesne lands of Hesleden and the Prior-pasture ; and the smoke pennies of the whole parish of Hesleden.\" The last article of the grant, however, was to cease when the vicarage recovered its usual state of prosperity. At the general airay of the clergy on Gillvgate Moor, in 1400, the vicar of Hesleden furnished one archer. The tithes of corn and grain of Hesleden and Hesleden HaU belong to the sixth stall in Durham Cathedral. They are described in the original apportionment of lands and tithes amongst the dean and prebendaries as \" Decim\u0153 Garbarum Vill\u00e6 de Hesildon una cum Decimis Manerii ibidem viii/. xiiis. iiijt/.\" In the Sequestrators' Books, \u2014 \"June xvj. 1644.

The yearly sum of \u00a35 was received up to the year 1821 by the incumbent of this parish, in respect of the charity of Mrs. Burn, and distributed amongst the poor not receiving parochial relief."], [553, "HESLEDEN. 409 In 1811, the arrears of interest for six years were paid by Nicholas Ruddock, Esq., of Hexham, who had acted as agent for the widow of Ralph Sparke, and was then acting for Isaac Sparke, a minor. From 1311, Mr. Ruddock or his son continued the payment on account of the above-named Isaac Sparke for some years ; but he died without issue, and devised his real estates to stir. Ruddock and another person, upon trust, to sell the same for the payment of his debts. In 1821, the sales were completed, and the trustees above men tioned were ready to pay all the then outstanding debts, and were prepared to pav the sum of \u00a3100 to the charity, if proof of the debt had been brought forward. The only document, which at the time of the In quiry, October, 1829, had been discovered relating thereto, was the copy of a deed of release purporting to have been made upon a previous lease for a year. \" If the original deed,\" say the Commissioners, \" of which the paper produced to us purports to be a copy, were to be found, such deed would be sufficient evidence of the execution ofthe bond for securing \u00a3100 for the charitable purposes above-mentioned, and the payment of interest up to 1821 would be evidence that up to that period the bond was unsatisfied, and that the estate of Isaac Sparke, deceased, was liable thereto. And, under such circumstances, we should apprehend that the principal and interest wou'd be recoverable from the property now remaining in the hands of the trustees. The property of Hutton Henry, formerly belonging to the family of Sparke, has been sold for several years, and the title-deeds were probably given up on such occasion to the purchasers.\" Hardwick House, one of the seats of the Marquis of Cleveland, is delightfully situated near the sea, about \\\\ mile east of Castle-Eden, and 15 miles south-by-east from Sunderland. It is a regu lar square building of brick, with two fronts to the south and west; and is surrounded with scat tered plantations and various sorts of forest trees. Lands in Hardwick granted to the convent of Durham, together with a chapel there,* as mem bers of Hesleden, were confirmed by Henry II. , and also by Richard I., by his charter, dated the 4th of February, in the 6th year of his reign. These acts were ratified by the bull of Pope Celes tine III. King John granted his charter of confirmation to the prior and monks, dated the 2d of February, in the 5th year of his reign ; also Henry III., by his charter, dated the 12th of May, in the 37th year of his reign, which Pope Adrian by his bull ratified to Prior Absolom ; and Pope Alexander III. also confirmed the same to Prior Thomas. However, an exchange took place be tween Bishop Pudsey and the convent, touching the manor of Hardwick, for which the convent received Muggleswick. (See page 247-) By a charter without date, but confirmed in 1278 by the prior and chapter, Bishop Robert granted to John de Malton the manor and vill of Hardvvick by-the-Sea (excepting certain lands reserved to the prior and convent), with the free and bond service of the same vill, to hold by the twentieth part of a knight's fee and suit at the county court of Durham only. In 1327, John de Denum died seized of the manor of Herd wyk juxta Hesilden, held by the last recited services, and valued at \u00a320 annual rent, leaving William his brother and heir, who is said by Hutchinson to have assumed the local name of Herdwyck. In the course of 60 years, Margaret de Ogle occurs as holding this manor for life, by grant from WiUiam de Mar tin, vicar of Hesleden, and John Forster, chaplain, with remainder to Richard Aske, and John Aske, and AVUliam Benet, and Richard Gurnays, chaplain. In 1391, John Aske was returned heir of entail ; and the family of Aske, who were of the first rank of gentry in Yorkshire, continued to hold the manor of Hardwick for two centuries. In 1587, Robert Aske, or Askew, alienated it * There is preserved in the treasury at Durham, an indenture relating to the chapel of Hardwick, betwixt the prior and Ranulf de Fishburn ; by which convention the prior grants or confirms the chapel of Herdwyk to Ranulf de Fisseburn, with licence to have mass celebrated twice in the week by his own chaplain, and three times in Advent and in Lent ; and for this concession Ranulf granted to the prior and to the mother church of Hesilden twelve acres of his land in the vill of Herdwyk in frank almoigne for ever ; on the morrow ofthe Annunciation, 1184. It is probable that the chapel of Hardwick perished during the unfortunate reign of Edward IL, when the Scots wasted the whole eastern coast of Durham ; as its lauded endowment, valued at one annual mark, was soon after attached to the vicarage of Hesleden. vol. i. 5 M"], [554, "410 EASINGTON AAGARD\u2014 S.

Hulam, Anciently Holomc, one mile south of Castle-Eden, and 14 north of Stockton, is a small township consisting of two farms, which support their poor jointly with Sheraton. In Boldon Book, \" Holome renders xxs. and carries wine with [a draught of] six oxen.\" In Hatfield's Survey, \" The heirs of AViUiam Claxton hold Holome, which was once Thomas de Ho lome's, and render xxvis. vind.\" The manor continued in this family till the 7th Eliz., when George Claxton sold it for \u00a3506, 13s. 4d. to Edmond Perkynson, of Newcastle, who left two daughters and coheirs: Barbara, the wife of Henry Midford; and Jane, wife of Henry Lawson, Esq., of Thoip-Bulmer. Christopher Midford, son and heir of Barbara Midford, sold the manor of Hulam to James Perkinson. Before 1670, it had become the property of the Strodes of Dorset shire. On the death of Serjeant Strode, the estate descended, about 1708, to \u2014 Evans as heir-at law,* who sold the same, with lands in Sheraton, to Dame Isabel, widow of Sir Ralph Carr, of Cocken, Knt. Her grandson, Ralph Carr, of Cocken, Esq., sold these estates, in 1729, to Anthony AVilkinson, of Crossgate, Esq., for \u00a38500 ; and they are now part of the possessions of that family. Hutton-Henby, In old records called Hotona, Huton, and Hooton, or Great Hooton, seems to have derived its present addition from Henry de Esh, an owner of the middle ages. The village stands on high ground, nearly two miles south of Castle-Eden, 13 miles north of Stockton, and on the western verge of the parish of Hesleden. A neat Catholic chapel, with a dwelling-house adjoining to it, called Hutton House, was built here, in 1824, by the Rev. Thomas A. Slater, for his own congre gation. There are in this village two public houses, a school, a cartwright and joiner, a black smith, a shopkeeper, &c. ; and the township contains eleven farmsteads. By Boldon Book, Hutton paid for cornage 35s., provided one castleman and one milch cow, and paid to the bishop eight chalders of malt and the like quantity of meal and of oats. Richard and Utred ploughed two acres at Shotton ; each carucate of land within the vill ploughed and harrowed two acres, and the villains wrought three days in autumn, with one man for each oxgang of land. The drenge fed horse and dog, carried a tun of wine, and one millstone to Durham, and attended the forest chace with two greyhounds, and five cords of provender, followed the court, and served on embassies. By Hatfield's Survey it is stated that Henry de Esh, as a free tenant, then held * On Serjeant Strode's death, Lord Crewe, Bishop of Durham, entered on his estates within the county \" as an escheat for want of an heir, got the tenants to attorne, and held the possession till Mr. Evans (who lived beyond London) brought an ejectment ;\" but, on being advised by the heir-at-law's solicitor, Mr. Lee, that his predecessor, \"that great prelate Anthony Beke, had for the like offence been impeached in parHa ment,\" and being threatened \" vvith an application to parliament for relief, and with an information in the King's Bench,\" he very prudently surrendered up possession to the heir, paid him a considerable sum for costs and damages ; and when he paid that money, he laid his hand upon the head of one of his chief agents, and said, \" Well, I pay this for thy experience.\" Bishop Crewe was so well satisfied with Mr. Lee's can dour and honesty, that he soon after gave him a considerable patent place, the office of Register of the Court of Chancery at Durham Surtees, vol. i. p. 57-"], [555, "HESLEDEN. 411 the vill of Huton, and four parcels of land there, by foreign service, rendering 53s. 6d. ; and that he with several others, held lands in drengage, formerly Robert Perison's and Guy de Hilton's, ren dering part of their rents at the manor-house of Middleham, and other part at the exchequer at Durham ; and that WiUiam Ward held lands there, formerly belonging to Roger, the son of Philip. The family of Esh possessed this manor till the reign of Queen Elizabeth ; when Richard Esh sold it to AVilliam AVyvill, who conveyed the same to Christopher Maire, Esq., in the 15th year of the same reign. This manor, with that of Hardwick, continued from that time in posses sion of the family of Maire, until latterly they became by descent the property of Henry Wytham, of Cliffe, co. Ebor., Esq. Hart-Bushes, in this constablery, was the property and residence of a younger branch of the family of Maire. There have been various small possessions held by sundry persons at Hutton. The family of Heron held lands here under the prior of Durham ; and in the time of Bishop Fox, Henry Bowes and Elianor his wife exchanged lands with the convent for lands at Hutton and other places. Henry de ATall had acquired lands there in Bishop Langley's time; also the family of Claxton. Sheraton, Anciently Shurveton, is a hamlet and township on the Stockton road, three miles soutli of Castle- Eden, and 12 miles north of Stockton. Here are two public houses, a spirit-merchant, a black smith, a shoemaker, and a cartwright and joiner. The township, with Hulam, contains seven farmsteads. Bishop Hugh Pudsev confirmed to the steward and leprous brethren of the Hospital of Sher burn one carucate of land in Shroveton, with pasture for 1000 sheep, which Thomas, the son of Stephen, the son of Burnolf, gave to the lepers in perpetual alms, to hold as the monks of Rievaulx held the same, viz. to whom Thomas, and Stephen the father of Thomas, had granted the same lands for twenty-four years, which lease the bishop purchased (vvith the buildings thereon) for 50 marks, three years before the end of the term ; and one bovate of land adjoining to the above, of the gift of Robert, uncle of Thomas. At this period, the vill of Sheraton was divided into two moieties, both originally held of the see of Durham in drengage ; a servile tenure, which obliged the landholder to cultivate the lord's land, reap his harvest, feed his dog and horse, and attend him in the chace. However, in Boldon Book it is said that John held a moiety of Sheraton for three marks, and was discharged of the services of half the drengage for Crawcrook, which he had quit claimed; and that Thomas held the other moiety, and rendered 30s. for cornage, four lot chalders of malt, the like of meal and of oats ; and for every carucate of villain land he ploughed and harrowed two acres, and wrought four days at harvest with one man, carried half a ton of wine and a millstone to Durham, and pro vided half a milch cow. As a drenge, he fed dog and horse in proportion to half a drengage, attended the forest chace with one greyhound, and found two cords and a half of provender and two men, made suit at court, and went on embassies. In Hatfield's Survey, the Lord de NeviUe held a moiety of this vill, with the demesnes, rendering for drengage rent at four terms 6s., for a milch cow at Martinmas 3s., for cornage 30s. ; also eight rasers of oatmeal, three rasers making a quarter ; and to the manor-house of Middleham two quarters, five bushels, and one peck of barley, and four quarters and six bushels of oats, and serving on foreign service. John de Aske then held"], [556, "412 EASINGTON WARD.-S. D. the other moiety by foreign service and 40s. ; and the whole vill carted half a pipe of wine and a millstone. The heirs of William Wakefield and Alan de Tesdall held a certain rent of one pound of cumin ; and Thomas Hexham held one acre of land in Whitsen which was an eschaet, and paid 2s. The moiety of Sheraton held by the Lord de Neville is supposed to be the same which, after passing through Hugo de Biiley, Roger Thornton, and other proprietors, came into the possession of John Lord Lumley, who suffered a recovery thereof in the 15th year of Bishop Tunstall. The moiety of Aske descended to Richard Aske, who died in 1460, leaving John, his son and heir, under age. In 1591, James Casson and Jane his wife alienated to Henry Midford, Gent, (with half the manor of Hulam) a fourth part of the manor of Sheraton. Parts of this manor were afterwards held by John AVatson and Jane his wife; by AVilliam Jurdeson, sen. and jun.; by Ralph Butterye, Gent. ; and by John Tweddell. In 1600, John Welburie and John Butterye, Gents., granted to Thomas Patteson, of Hedworth, Gent., their capital messuage and mansion house of Sheraton Grange, with certain closes, and a tenth part of the whole manor. \" In 1680, the freeholders in Sheraton were, Mr. Serjeant Stroud, for Hulam, dwelling at London ; the heires of John AAratson ; John Patteson, of Sheraton-Grainge, Gent., aged ; John Atkinson ; Francis Atkinson, Esq., at Ovingham, Northumberland; Thomas Smithson, Gent., co.

In 1723, John Spearman, of Hetton-le-Hole, Esq., John his son and heir, and John AVil kinson, of Elvet, conveyed (together with the manor of Nesbit) their lands in Sheraton to An . thony AVilkinson, of Crossgate, Esq, This family, who have acquired other possessions here, are now the chief proprietors in Sheraton. PARISH OF KELLOE. The parish of KeUoe lies to the west of Hesleden, forming the south-western angle of Easinoton. Ward. It is subdivided into six constableries: 1, KeUoe; 2. Coxhoe; 3. Quarrington; 4. Cassop and Tursdale ; 5. Thornley ; and, 6. Wingate, including Wheatley Hill, Greenhills, and the Hur worths. In 1821, this parish contained 123 houses and 679 inhabitants; and the value of property assessed to the county-rate in 1828-9 was \u00a3'6120, 14s, 3d, * Sheriff's List of Freeholders."], [557, "KELLOE. 413 Kelloe. There were formerly two Kelloes; Kellaw Magna and Kellaw Parva. The former is identified with the freehold manor and vill lying north of Kelloe Beck,* and includes the scite of the modern village. The family of Kellaw early assumed the local name. Alexander de Kellaw occurs as a benefactor to the hospital of Sherburn about the middle of the 13th century ; and Richard Kellaw was bishop of Durham in 1311. His brother, Patric Kellaw, commanded the troops of the bishopric against the freebooters of Northumberland. In the 11th year of Bishop Langley, Joan, daughter of William and Agnes de Kellaw, conveyed her possessions in marriage to John Fossour. Their descendants resided here till the commencement of the 17th century, when they removed to Harbourhouse on the AArear. Basil Forcer, Esq., died without issue in 1782; and the manor of Kelloe was sold to John Tempest, Esq., by whom it was devised to his nephew, Sir Henry Arane Tempest, Bart. On his death, in 1813, this, with his other estates, descended to his only daughter and heiress, Lady Frances A'ane, who married Charles AVilliam, third Marquis of Londonderry. The Nevilles held lands in Kelloe. In 1377, John Lord Neville of Raby had pardon of aliena tion for a third part of this manor, acquired of John de Broughton and William de Kellaw, chap lains; and, in 1383, tbe same third part was granted by John Lord Neville to John Fossour, mentioned above. Kelloe township contains the village called Kelloe Town, and the hamlet called Church Kelloe, the latter of which is situated half a mile west of the former, and consists of the church, the vi carage, and another house. It is distant 5h miles south-south-east of Durham, and 5 miles north of Sedgefield. Kelloe Old Hall, in Town Kelloe, is now used as a farm-house ; and there is also a public house in this village, kept by the parish-clerk. The township contains four farmsteads. The Church. The church and parsonage stand in a low hollow vale, to the north of Kelloe Beck. The church consists of a nave of about eighteen paces long and seven wide, and a chancel of an equal width and fourteen paces long. A low square tower projects about five paces at the west end of the nave. The east window is divided into three lights under a pointed arch. The nave has three windows of similar form, and the chancel three narrow pointed lights, all to the south. There was a large projection or porch, called Thornley Porch, or Pity Porch, on the north side, which opened into the nave by a pointed arch, and half a circular arch supported on a low pillar; but its dimen sions are now reduced to the size of a common pew, and the roof is covered with a flat ceiling.f * Kelloe Beck, a small trout-stream, rises from two heads near Thornley and AVheatley Hill ; flows past Coxhoe and Cornforth, exchanging its name for that of every village vvhich it passes ; and a little below Cornforth, receiving a small beck from Ferryhill and another which descends from Quarrington, runs through the low grounds betwixt Tursdale and Hett Moors, and terminates its course on the AA'ear. This little stream turns six mills : Coxhoe corn-mill, two paper-mills at Cornforth, Thinford corn and paper-mill, Hett mill, and Croxdale paper-mill. The last stands in a glen so deep and narrow, that the sun never shines except on its roof. t Several testamentary burials occur here : John Trollop, of Thornley, Esq., 1522, \" to be buried in my Porche of our Ladye in Kellowe churche, betwixt my wyfe and the alter ende.

John Fitz-Henry de Kellaw and Elizabeth his sister, by indenture with Thomas Hoton, chap lain, in 1347 founded a chantry at the altar of the Blessed Mary in the church of Little Kellaw, for the daily celebration of mass for the good estate of the same John and Elizabeth, and for the souls of their parents and of all the parishioners of Kellaw. In 1352, this family appropriated all their lands in Thornlaw, of \u00a310 value, to the support of this chantry, which seems to be thus identified with Thornlaw Porch, as the proprietors of Thornlaw have continued to possess certain rights in it.* Monuments. \u2014 In the chancel is a Latin inscription to the memory of Merci\u00e6 Liveley, who died January 30, 1638; probably a daughter of the vicar, John Liveley.

Master Henry de Burton, by whom instituted they knew not; Master Helyas de Langneuton, Master Thomas of London, a certain Master Nicholas (who died beyond sea in the service of the bishop), and Master Thomas of Canterbury, which four successively and in continuance possessed the vicarage on the collation of Anthony bishop of Durham. They also deposed that Master John Gray was collated by Lewis Beaumont, late bishop of Durham. Such of the jurors as were clerks, however, owned that they had seen a letter purporting that one Philip, bishop of Durham, had collated a clerk to the vicarage on the presentation of the Master and Brethren of Sherburn. The presentation seems to have rested in them from this time until 1579 ; when Bishop Barnes rejected Ralph Lever's presentation of George SwalweU, and collated Roger Wilson, his own clerk. Since that time it has remained in the gift of the bishop of Durham. April 8, 1636, a terrier of the vicarage of Kelloe was delivered into the Registry by John Live ley, vicar. \" Imprimis, the vicarage-house, a very well contrived house, and lately built by the said John Liveley.\" The glebe consisted of a great number of closes and small parcels of unin closed lands, of which several were in challenge by the Master of Sherburn. The terrier allows certain prescript rents from Wingate Grange and Town, Wheatley Hill, Cassop, Coxhoe, Turs dale and Thornlaw, which will be mentioned in the accounts of those places. At present, the glebe is all inclosed, and estimated to contain 222 acres.

A sum of \u00a35 is in the hands of one ofthe churchwardens, who received it from his predecessor about the year 1810, and pays 5s. yearly as the interest. AA'hether this sum was derived from Henry Airey or not is uncertain, as the interest appears to have been distributed many years under the name of Kirton's Dole. This small sum is divided, about Easter, amongst the overseers of the six townships in the parish, lOd. to each, for distribution amongst their respective poor.

Coxhoe Is a hamlet and township, 5 miles south-south-east of Durham, on the road from that city to Sedge field. The manor adjoins Kelloe on the east, Garmonsway and Raceby on the south, Cornforth in Bishop-Middleham parish on the west, and Quarrington and Cassop on the north. Coxhoe Hall, the seat and property of Anthony AA^ilkinson, Esq., stands in a fine healthy situation, in a good sporting country. It is a handsome square building, fronts nearly to the south, and forms a con spicuous object from many parts of the surrounding country. The estate contains 1056 acres, and is scattered over with rising plantations. This township is the residence of a schoolmaster, a black smith, a joiner, and two farmers. A considerable landsale colliery is worked here; and the estate affords lime, and a good seam of clay for making earthenware. Coxhoe is not mentioned in Boldon Book. In the 10th year of Bishop Beaumont, John Denum died seized of a moiety of the vill, with a mine of coal there, which he held of the bishop in capite, and also of a messuage and twelve acres, which he held of Thomas de Cornford. The family of Blakiston acquired considerable possessions here before the time of Bishop Hatfield, though by"], [561, "KELLOE. 417 that prelate's Survey, it seems a resident family had assumed the local name. In the time of the subsequent prelates, the Blakistons held the manor and vill ; and so late as the 13th year of King James I., Sir Thomas Blakiston, Knt. and Bart., settled the same upon his grandson, Sir Thomas, eldest son of Sir William, with remainder to his six brothers in succession. Coxhoe passed by marriage, in 1621, to WiUiam Kennett, Esq., whose great-grand-daughter Mary married Kenneth, Earl and titular Marquis of Seaforth, of the kingdom of Scotland. The earl embarked in the rash enterprize of 1715; and his lady died in exile at Paris in 1739- The family of Seaforth sold the manor, before 1749, to John Burdon, Esq. ; and it has since passed through various proprietors to Anthony Wilkinson, Esq, The estate of Coxhoe pays a prescript rent of 7s. 6d. to the vicar of Kelloe, and 12s. 6d. for the tithe of Coxhoe mill; \u00a32, 13s. 4d. to the Master of Sherburn, in lieu of corn-tithe; and a fee farm rent of \u00a33, 4s. 8d. to Sir J. P. Twisden, Bart. Quarrington. The township of Quarrington joins Coxhoe on the south, and Cassop on the east ; on the north it is divided from the manor of Tursdale by a small stream called Bow-burn, which crosses the turnpike road near Crow-trees; on the west its boundary is considerably extended, and somewhat irregularly intermixed with that of Cornforth in the parish of Bishop-Middleham. The name (anciently Queringdon) is supposed to be derived from the quarries which have been constantly wrought here. The township contains five farmsteads and two collieries. The village lies at the south-western base of a long ridge of limestone hills, 5 miles south-east of Durham. Here are two public houses, a blacksmith, and a joiner. Quarrington Grange lies nearly a mile to the west of the village. There are some traces of an ancient fortification at a place called Castle Hill, about two miles to the west of Quarrington, in the grounds belonging to a small tenement called Stand-alone or Sedgebitlee. The ground-plot, which is situated on a dead level, is nearly square, and contains about an acre and a half, included within a moat, and thrown up regularly into a very gentle rise towards the centre. Several squared foundation-stones have been discovered in ploughing, but no other remains. Local tradition assigns this spot as the residence, at a very remote period, of the Baliols. On the 8th of April, 1644, the Scotch army, under the Earl of Leven, moved their quarters from Easington to Quarendon Hill, and lay there till the 13th, when they marched to Ferry Hill, and from thence to Darlington. In the spring of the year 1747, a detachment from the Duke of Cum berland's army lay for some weeks on Quarrington Hill. The ground has not since been ploughed ; and the arrangement of the tents or huts is still very observable on the south-western declivity of the hill. At the period when Boldon Book was compiled (about 1183), this viUage was the capital of a district called Queringdonshire, which included Sherburn, Shadforth, and Cassop. The punder of this district had 20 acres as the fee of office, and rendered six score hens and 1000 eggs. In Bishop Pudsey's time, four carucates of Querrington demesne, with the sheep, stock, and pasture, were in the lord's hands. The greve or headborough man held an oxgang of land for his service, and tlie smith twelve acres, This shire paid 64s, for cornage, and provided three milch cows. Ia Hatfield's Survey, it is stated that the Master of Sherburn Hospital held Quarrington Grainge, vol. i. 5 0"], [562, "418 EASINGTON AArARD\u2014 S. D. with the demesnes, meadows, and pasture, under the yearly rent of \u00a3?18, 18s. Quarrington has since been leased by the bishops of Durham to the families of Raket or Rackets, AUenson, Wil bamson, and others. The township pays an annual prescript rent of 3s. 8d. to the vicar of Kelloe. Cassop. The village of Cassop is situated 4 miles south-east-by-east of Durham. It contains a few farm houses, scattered on the declivity of a hill, separated from Quarrington on the soutli by a broad hollow vale, and commanding an extensive prospect to the north-west, including the Cathedral of Durham, and bounded by the range of the western hills. Cassop House is the residence of Paul Anderson, Esq. Cassop was anciently included in Queringdonshire. By Boldon Book, William de Kent held four oxgangs of land, and served on embassies. Under Hatfield's Survey, the same lands were held by Thomas Clerk of Elvet (formerly by John Birtley, and prior to him by John Freeman), for which he served on embassies, and rendered 6s. 8d. The vill has since been held by lease under the see of Durham. In 1587, AVilliam Busbie, John Davyson, John Archer, John Tomlyn son, and Henry Bailes, were lessees here; and George Tailer was a tenant at will. The families of AVilson, Bewick, and Reed, have subsequently held property in Cassop. The corn-tithes of this manor are held by lease for 21 years under the Master and Brethren of Sherburn Hospital. Prescript due to the vicar of Kelloe, 3s. 8d. Tursdale lies to the west of Cassop. A farm-house, standing on a gentle slope of ground with a south-western aspect, is supposed to occupy the scite of the ancient manor-house ; as there are still some remains of old gardens and orchard-grounds. A small wooded deU opens to the north, and, receiving the water of Tursdale (or Kelloe) Beck, forms the head of Croxdale Dene, gradually deepening through a variety of wood and rock scenery till it terminates on the AVear. Bishop Philip granted the manor of Trillesden to his servant, John le Boteler, whose grand daughter Alice married Peter, afterwards surnamed de Trillesden. Their great-grandson, William de Trillesden, before 1337 had alienated this estate to William de Elmeden,* in whose family it remained till 1508; when Elizabeth, only daughter and heiress of AVilliam Elmeden, intermarried with AVilliam Buhner, Esq. Francis Bulmer, Esq., (son of WiUiam and Elizabeth) was succeeded by his son Anthony in 1577, father of Sir Bertram Bulmer, who was probably one of the most gallant and expensive men of his age in this country. He received knighthood at Durham on the first coming-in of King James, and afterwards spent much of his time at court; though his style of living at Trillesden was very splendid. After having dissipated the greater part of his paternal inheritance, he led a troop, which he raised himself, in the Low Country wars, where his men on one occasion deserted him, and he was taken prisoner by the Spaniards. He afterwards returned to Durham, and dying in the parish of St. Oswald's, was buried there May 6, 1638. On December 20, in the same year, the manor of Thirlesden, otherwise Tursdale, was conveyed, for \u00a31658, by William Bulmer, of Morwick, Esq., to Lord AVilliam Howard of Naworth. His son, Colonel * By charter, dated May], 1451, Bishop Neville confirmed to AVilliam Elmeden, a descendant of the above AVilliam de Elmeden, the manor of Trillesden ; though the supposed grant of Bishop Philip to John le Boteler, and subsequent ratifications by Bishop Hugh and Prior Absolon, had been delivered up into the bishop's chancery, to be there cancelled, with a confession that they wereya/_*e and fabricated."], [563, "KELLOE. 419 Thomas Howard, of Tursdale, engaged in the royal service on the breaking-out of the civil wars, and was killed at Piersbridge in a sharp skirmish vvith a party of the Parliament forces under Captain Hotham, December 1, 1642. In 1692, his son, Thomas Howard, Esq., conveyed the estate, for \u00a3'3950, to William AVilkinson, of Crossgate, Gent., in whose descendants it has since remained. Tursdale pays a prescript rent of 5s. to the vicar of Kelloe, and \u00a31, 12s. in lieu of corn-tithe to the Master of Sherburn. Thornley. The manor of Thornley, or Thornlaw, is bounded by Wingate and AVheatley Hill on the east, by Shadforth and part of Ludworth on the north, by Cassop on the west, and by Kelloe Lawes and Kelloe Hill on the south. It includes three farmsteads; and the village, which is 5 miles south-east-by-east of Durham, on the road from thence to Hartlepool, contains a public house, and the shops of a blacksmith, and a cartwright and joiner. During the contest of AVilliam de St. Barbara with AA'illiam Cumyn, the Scotch usurper of the see of Durham, the adherents of the former fortified or \" made a place of defence on the spot which is called Thornlaw ; and there the bishop abode, getting such scanty provision as he might.\" Not long after, the traitor Hugh Pinton surrendered this post to Cumyn. There are no remains of fortification which might afford any indication of what was then the strength of the place. The present mansion (now used as a farm-house) stands upon an eminence, with deep gulleys or dells towards the east and south, and a piece of marshy ground to the west. A little to the south of the house there is a cavern in the limestone rock ; the entrance to which is narrow, but the roof soon rises sufficiently to allow a man to stand upright. This cavern is said to communicate with the old chapel, above twenty yards to the north, and to have been used for the purpose of escape or concealment. In confirmation of this account, it is affirmed that two priests, who had escaped throuo-h this passage during the persecutions in the reign of Elizabeth, were drowned in a pool near Sherburn, still called Priest. Pool. To the north of Thornley, the highest point of the Dur ham road is called Signing Hill, from a custom observed by travellers of making the sign of the cross when they first obtained a prospect of Durham Cathedral. In the year 1190, Peter Harpyn held the manor of Thornlaw ; and Sir Richard Harpyn, of Shotton, succeeded him, and was living in 1264. Two Johns and one Thomas, of the name of Harpyn, succeeded Sir Richard ; when the male line failing, the family estates descended to Ka therine, the only daughter and heiress of Thomas, who married Thomas de Lumley.* They had issue a son, William, who died under wardship, leaving his sister Margaret his heir, who married John Trollop.

Lastly, it was agreed that the bridegroom should remain in the governance of his father \" till he be of reasonable age to govern himselfe.\" And to all these conditions each party binds himself in the pe nalty of \u00a340. The will of John the son, thus contracted in his minority, bears date at Hartlepole, 30 Oct. 1470. He bequeaths his soul to the Arirgin, St. John Baptist, St. Cuthbert, and all the blessed company of heaven, and leaves to his younger sons and other relations each an annuity of four marks, and to his three daughters \u00a320 each \" to get them husbands.\" Legacies are also appointed to certain of the religious establishments at Durham, Hartlepool, Richmond, Newcastle, and Carlisle. John, eldest son and heir of the last-named John, was contracted by his father to Catherine Sayer, of AVorsall, 21st July, 1473. Andrew Trollop, a younger son, was a soldier of considerable note in the reigns of Henry VI. and Edward IV. He served under the Duke of York in France, but afterwards espoused the cause of the House of Lancaster, and was killed in the battle of Towton, where he bore a principal command. John Trollop, Esq., son of John Trollop and Catherine Sayer, was contracted in marriage, when little more than an infant in arms, to Jane, daughter of Robert Tempest, of Holmside ; and his second wife was Alice Morland. In his will, dated 1522, amongst other annuities and legacies, he bequeaths to his two younger sons \u00a33, 6s. 8d. betwixt them annually, and to his unmarried daughters \" fourty marks for their advauncement.\" Ofthe will of John Trollop, who died in 1555, nothing is known. His son, Thomas Trollop, who died about 1558, and his grandson, John Trollop, who died in 1611, had each a numerous progeny of younger children to provide for by scanty annuities charged on the inheritance. In 1569, the date of the will of the latter, he was preparing to engage in the rebellion of the Earls of Northumberland and AVestmoreland ; and he was included in the act of attainder, by which his life-interest in the estates became vested in the crown. However, with many vexations and difficulties, he contrived to hold possession during the reign of Eliza- beth ; but King James granted away the manor of Thornley to two of his court-favourites. StiU it was thought prudent to grant a lease of it for life to John Trollop, under a yearly rent of \u00a310 ; and on his death, John Trollop, the heir of entail, recovered possession, with costs, from the king's farmer. The estate was now so incumbered, that successive mortgages were had recourse to; and, in 1621 and 1623, the Milne .field was sold to George Reed and to the Busbies. In 1625, the Gore, the best and principal part of the estate, already in mortgage, was alienated to Alexander Davison. An unfortunate accident also now oc- curred, which accelerated the downfall of the family. John Trollop the younger, in a sudden quarrel at a horse-race, on the 4th December, 1636, fought vvith AVilliam Selby, Esq., of Newcastle, and slew him on the spot. He immediately fled, and was outlawed at the ensuing assizes. On the commencement of the civil wars in 1641, the elder Mr. Trollop embraced the royal cause; and, besides the total ruin of his shat- tered fortunes, lost his two younger sons in the king's service. After the Restoration, the Trollops, like many a starving Cavalier, found themselves reduced to the possession of the family mansion, and about a third part of the original estate- John Trollop died in 1668, leaving a son and grandson, the only survivors of the numerous family of Thornley. On the death of John Trollop the younger in 1678, his father sold what remained of the property, together with the burial-place of his ancestors in Thornley Porch, to John Spearman, Gent., and retired to AVest Herrington, where he died in 1682, and was buried at KeUoe.-*- Surtees, vol- i- p. 85 et seq."], [565, "KELLOE. 421 Wingate and Wingate Grange. The village of Wingate lies to the east of Thornley, and six miles east-south-east of Durham. The township, including AVheatley Hill, Greenhills, and the Hurworths, contains 13 farmsteads. Hugh, the son of Pinton, is mentioned in a charter of Bishop William as proprietor of Wingate.* Bishop Pudsey gave this place to his favourite monastry of Finchale, to which the greater part of it seems to have belonged until the dissolution. In 1428, the prior of Durham exchanged lands in Ludworth with Thomas Holden, Esq., for certain lands and rents in AVingate, the Merringtons, and Elvet. Edward ArL, in 1553, granted property here, parcel ofthe possessions ofthe monas try of Durham, to Simon AA^elburie and Christopher Morland, which afterwards passed through various proprietors, until the whole became, by purchase, in 1702, the property of William AVil kinson, of Crossgate, Esq., in whose descendants it still remains. AAringate town pays a prescript of 3s. to the vicar of Kelloe. Wingate Grange formerly belonged to the convent of Durham, and was valued at \u00a3\"12, 13s. 4d. per annum ; but Queen Elizabeth, in the 41st year of her reign, granted it to Eastechurch and Best, two gentlemen of London, who, four years afterwards, transferred it to Thomas Liddell of Newcastle ; and he, in 1608, granted it in fee to Christopher and George AVharton, Esqrs. From their descendants it passed to the Davisons, and afterwards by marriage to the Bakers, who sold it to Sir John Cradock, K. B. Wingate Grange pays a modus of 3s. to the vicar of Kelloe, and I8s. 6d. to the Master of Sherburn in lieu of corn-tithe. Wheatley Hill, anciently Quetlawe, adjoins AVingate. The name is supposed to be derived from White Law, on account of the white or hoary appearance which high exposed situations frequently retain after the rind has thawed on the lower grounds. In 1474, Robert Rhodes, Esq., died seized of Whetlawe, which descended to Alice, wife of Richard Bainbrigge the younger. In 1621, John Bainbrigg, Esq., conveyed Wheatley Hill to Sir Thomas Riddell, of Gateshead, Knt., for \u00a3J2700; who, with his son, granted it, in 1639, to Lord William Howard, of Naworth Castle, for \u00a32880, from whose descendants it passed, with Tursdale, to the family of Wilkinson. In 1616, Thomas Bainbrigg, Esq., conveyed Greenhill, parcel of Wheatley Hill, to George Martyn, of Durham, Gent. It has since passed into the family of Gowland. The whole estate pays a prescript rent of 2s. to the vicar of Kelloe, and 13s. 4d. to the Master of Sherburn in lieu of corn-tithe.

Their present names are, White Hurworth, south-east of AVingate ; Black Hurworth, further to the south-east, near the limits of Hart parish ; Red Hurworth ; and Hurworth-Holden-Carr, or Hur worth-Hollingforth, which lies most to the south, adjoining Whinhouses, in the parish of Sedgefield. * \"If we may give credit to the continuator of Simeon,\" says Surtees, \"he (Hugh) was a most accom plished liar and scoundrel. He only just failed in betraying his master, ' dominion benignissimum,' into the hands of AVilliam Cumyn, the Scotch usurper of the see ; and he actually did, under false pretences, ensnare two barons of the bishopric, Aschetin de AVorcester and Robert de stlundevill, and deliver them up, one after the other, to be imprisoned in a dungeon till he extorted from them a heavy ransom ; and, last of all, he surrendered the fortress of Thornley (of which he was the guardian) to AVilliam Cumyn, being himself deluded by the promise of a marriage betwixt his niece and tlie nephew of Cumyn.

D. Tlie family of Kellaw seem to have had possessions here; and, in 1344, Richard de Kellaw held a rent of 13s. 4d. issuing out of Hurtheworth. The estate afterwards came to the Fulthorpes, under whom the family of Claxton for several years held a parcel of the manor. In 1468, Tho mas Hurworth died seized of Hurvvorth-Brian, otherwise Hurworth-on-the-Moor, leaving three daughters and coheiresses, between whom the manor was afterwards divided ; possibly by lot, red, black, and white. The family of Maire latterly held the chief part of the possessions here. CHAPELRY OF TRIMDON. This chapelry is bounded by the parish of Kelloe on the north and east ; by Garmonsway Moor, belonging to Sherburn Hospital, on the west ; and by the parish of Sedgefield on the south. It includes but one township or constablery of the same name. In 1821, it contained 61 houses and 302 inhabitants ; and the annual value of lands and buildings assessed to the county-rate in 1828-9 was \u00a3T433, 10s. \" At Trimdon, King Canute Dane coming on pilgrimage to holy St. Cuthbert, lighted from his horse, and having his crown shaven, travelled barefoot and bareheaded to the holy shrine.\" From this transaction Trimdon has been imagined to derive its name \u2014 the Place of Tonsure. Bishop WiUiam de St. Barbara, vvith the consent of his chapter, gave the church (or chapel) of Trimdon to Guisburne priory about the year 1146; and Bishop Richard Poore, with like consent, gave the manor to that priory in free and perpetual alms, which was confirmed by the king. In 1311, Bishop Kellaw confirmed both the gifts.

The village of Trimdon consists of one very broad and long street of houses, situated on an eminence, 3i miles north-by-east of Sedgefield. The mansion-house belonging to the estate stands at the west end of the village: over the front is inscribed, \"Brian Roper, Anno Dom. 1718.\" Here are three public houses, a common brewer and spirit merchant, with shopkeepers, butchers, smiths, and other tradesmen. The Church is a small ancient building, standing in the middle of the village. The history of the impropriation is included in that of the manor.

Robert Roper, of Trimdon, Esq., LL. D., was chancellor of the diocese of York, and auditor of the duchy of Lancaster for the north parts. He was twice married, first to Miss Woodcock, of an ancient and respectable family at Doncaster ; to his second wife he married the Lady Henrietta Hay, daughter of the Earl of Kinnoul, but left no issue. He was a man of bright genius, highly accomplished in polite lite rature, and possessed a most social vein of affability and good humour, joined with an elegant person and graceful carriage. \u2014 Hutch, vol. iii. p. 10.

A part of the church-yard at Kelloe is set apart for the use of this chapelry ; but on August 5, 1811, the Lord Bishop of Durham consecrated a new burial-ground here. About 1614, Humphrey and Thomas AVharton, Esqrs., settled a house and garth lying in Trim don (since held as the parsonage) and an annual rent-charge of ,\u00a320, free of all deductions, issuing out of the manor of Trimdon, in four feoffees, for the perpetual endowment of the church here, and the maintenance of the officiating priest for the time being. The endowment has been regularly paid. In 1715, Ann Lister, of Billingham, spinster, devised certain lands in Trimdon to the President and Fellows of the Queen's CoUege of St. Margaret and St. Bernard in Cambridge, or their ap pointees, on trust, \" to dispose of the rents for and towards the maintenance of a person to be by them chosen, to preach on all Sundays in the afternoon throughout the year, in the parish church or chapell of Trimdon ;\" with a proviso that should they at any time be enabled to purchase the advowson, then in such case they may settle the profits as an augmentation for the minister and his successors. The President and Fellows of Queen's College refused the contingency offered them under the deed ; and under a decree, about 1730, the lands were settled as a perpetual aug mentation to the cure under the name of a Lectureship. The lands consist of 110 acres, well en closed, with a farm-house on the premises, and are held for the residue of a term of 1000 years (from March 25, 1614) by the lord of the manor of Trimdon, under 56s. 2d. rent. The following records from the Sequestrators' Books relate to the chapelry of Trimdon : \u2014 \" Trimdon : \u2014 the free rent reserved to the chief lord, with the mill, is \u00a329, 4s. 4d. ; and Sir John Byron hath the wardship, vvhich expires at Candlemas 1645. \" The tyth-rent doth amount to \u00a320 per ann. which is allowed for the curate. \" Names of the Papists there, Robert AVeemes, &c. \"AVarrant to sequester two parts of their property, 9 Sept. 1644. \"12 Dec. 1644, Letten to Robert Rooper, jun. all those lands in Trimdon which he farmed of the Lord Bryan, from May-day last, \u00a375 per ann. by Mr. George and Richard Lilburne. \" It being doubted whether the Lord Bryan was a delinquent, there came in one and swore, and so proved him a delinquent.\" Charities. Charities of John Airey and others. \u2014 By the will of John Airey, it appears that the interest of \u00a350 (part of a sum of \u00a3200 advanced on certain property in Trimdon) should be applied for the putting out the poor children of Trimdon, yearly, apprentices. Henry Airey, by will, 1st February, 1680, left to the poor of the town of Trimdon \u00a350, to be put forth by the minister and churchwardens, they taking to their assistance four of the most honest and substantial neighbours, the interest to be by them all distributed amongst the poor of the said town yearly, on the day of his death, reserving 5s. yearly to the parish for the commemora tion ; and it is stated in the Parliamentary Returns of 1786 that, in 1718, Ann Lister bequeathed to the poor \u00a340, that John Wood'ifield left \u00a320, and that \u00a340 was advanced by the township, to complete the purchase of the above-named lands. These consist of three closes, containing between 11 and 12 acres, and are now let at a good yearly rent of \u00a332. The trustees receive the rent, and pay it over to the minister, churchwardens, and overseers, for distribu tion. One fourth of the clear sum is set apart in respect of the gift of John Airey, for placing out appren tices. This is generally divided equally between two boys who have been placed out apprentices, between \u00a33 and \u00a34 bein\u00b0* allowed for each, and the money is paid to the parents for the purpose of providing the"], [568, "424 EASINGTON WARD.\u2014 S. D. apprentices with clothes, as it is not the practice for masters in this neighbourhood to require any premium with an apprentice. One other fourth part of the rent is given away on the 10th July, under the name of Ann Lister's Benefaction, and is divided between 14 or 15 poor persons of Trimdon, in sums varying from 5s. to \u00a31. Of the remaining half of the rent, 5s. is paid to the minister for preaching a sermon on the 28th February, in commemoration of Henry Airey, and the residue is given away on the same day, or soon after wards, to about 17 or 18 poor persons ofthe parish, in sums varying from 12s. to 30s. Persons who receive regular parish relief are not admitted to partake of the distribution in July or February. Henry Airey s Charity \u2014 Henry Airey, by will, 1st February, 1680, gave to John Airey, of Trimdon, all his lands lying within the township of Trimdon, called by the names of the North Moor Shoolebriggs, and Roughley Close, he paying yearly out of the same \u00a35 towards the maintaining a free-school in Trimdon for ever, for the teaching and educating such and so many of the poorest of the children in Trimdon aforesaid as the minister and churchwardens should think fit, and also paying 5s. yearly to a minister that should preach a sermon yearly in the church at Trimdon, on the day of his death : he also bequeathed the sum of \u00a350 to the poor of Trimdon, and for a sermon, as above mentioned under the head of the charities of John Airey and others. The yearly sum of \u00a35 is paid as the gift of Henry Airey, by the owners of the above named lands, in quarterly payments, to the schoolmaster of Trimdon, for which he instructs six boys or girls in reading. The yearly sum of 5s. is also paid to the minister for preaching a sermon in commemoration of Henry Airey ; the further sum of 5s. being paid out of the rents of the estate purchased with the monies bequeathed by John Airey and others. Roper's Charily. \u2014 In the Parliamentary Returns of 1786 it is stated that Bryan Roper gave land to the poor of this parish. A piece of ground in Trimdon, called the Paddock, containing about an acre, is sup posed to have been derived from the donor above named. This is now let at a good rent of \u00a35 per annum. The churchwardens have the sole management of this money; and they distribute the rent amongst such poor persons of the parish as appear the fittest objects of charity, in sums varying from 5s. to 12s."], [569, "STOCKTON WARD \u2014 -*\u25a0\u00bb\u2022\u00bb \u2022\u00bbo>\u00a9e\u00bb\u00ab-_ HIS Ward and Deanery occupies the south-eastern corner of the county of Durham. It is separated from the south division of Easington AA'ard by an imaginary line, running from the sea, a little to the north of Har- tlepool, in a west-south-west direction. From the parish of Kelloe the boundary sweeps south and west, cutting out the parish of Bishop- Middleham. The Skerne river and another imaginary line divide this AVard from that of Darlington on the west and south-west, until it joins the Tees at Middleton-one-Row. This river bounds the Ward on the south-east; and the eastern coast is washed by the German Ocean. The length of Stockton Ward from the parish of Middleton St. George on the south-west, to the sea near Hartlepool on the north east, is about 18 miles ; and its breadth from Stockton, its capital, on the south-east, to the boun dary of Bishop-Middleham parish on the north-west, is nearly 10 miles ; but near the sea it is not more than 8 miles across. It is a very healthy district, the soil is generally fertile, and the scenery is in some places highly picturesque, especially on the banks of the Tees, the Skerne, the Billing. ham Beck, the Embleton Beck, and the Greatham. Stockton Ward is subdivided into two divisions, the north-east and south-west ; and contains seventeen parishes and two chapelries, of which the foUowing is an enumeration : \u2014 NORTH-EAST DIVISION.

E. D. The parish of Bishop-Middleham, formerly belonging to this Ward, has recently been consti tuted a part of the new Ward of Durham. The parishes of Low Dinsdale, Sockburn, and Hur worth, with the townships of Coathaui-Mundeville, Sadberge, and Morton-Palms (belonging to the parish of Haughton-le-Skerne), have also been separated from Stockton Ward, and annexed to the south-east division of Darlington AVard. NORTH-EAST DIVISION. PARISH OF SEDGEFIELD. HIS extensive parish is situated in the north-west extremity of Stockton AVard. It is bounded on the north by the parish of Kelloe and the chapelry of Trimdon, on the north-west by Bishop-Middleham parish, on the west by Aycliffe parish in Darlington Ward, on the south and south-east by the parishes of Stainton-le- Street and Grindon, and on the east by the parish of Elwick Hall. Sedgefield parish contains seven townships, viz. 1. Sedgefield; 2. Fishburn; 3. Butterwick and Old Acres; 4. Embleton, including Murton; 5. Foxton and Shotton ; 6. Morden; and, 7- Bradbury and the Isle. In 1821, the whole contained 453 houses and 1955 inhabitants. Ofthe 446 families then enumerated, 368 were employed in agriculture, 58 in trade or handicraft, and the remaining 20 either engaged in professional pursuits or unemployed. In the year ending January 12, 1829, the annual value of property assessed to the county-rate wras \u00a313,001, 4s. 3|d. Sedgefield. Cutheard, who succeeded Bishop Eardulph, about the year 900, redeemed, with the money of his church, the vill of Sedgefield, with its members, which had been held by Aculf, Ethelbryth, and Frythlake. In this territory the bishop had Sac and Soe. By Boldon Book it appears there were twenty villains in this manor, who held their lands and performed their services like those of Boldon. Besides those, there were twenty farmers, each of whom held two oxgangs of land, and paid 5s. ; ploughed and harrowed for the lord half an acre ; employed two men two days in mowing and reaping, and the same in getting up hay ; and a car riage two days leading corn, and two days hay. All the farmers dressed four portions of land in autumn, with all their family, except the housewife. The reve or headborough-man had two oxgangs of land for his service ; the smith one oxgang, for making iron work for the carriages, and finding coals; the carpenter 12 acres, for making and repairing carriages and implements of husbandry ; the punder had 12 acres and his threaves, like others, and rendered 40 hens and 400"], [571, "SEDGEFIELD. 427 eggs. There were five cottagers, who held five tofts, paid 5s., and dressed four portions of land. The villains paid 20s. cornage ; and the whole vill joined to provide a milch cow. AVilliam of Aldacres paid 16s. ; Utred of Butterwick, half a mark ; and AViUiam held Hardewyck, and paid 10s. Under Hatfield's Survey, Roger de Fulthorp and John Herdwyck held the manor of Herdwyck, by homage, fealty, and suit of court, rendering 10s. The vill of Butterwyck paid an assart rent* of \u00a36, 13s. 4d., which shews, that in the period between Pudsey's pontificate and Hatfield's, that tract was brought into cultivation. Oldacres also paid an assart rent. Certain lands are men tioned, belonging to John Henley, then rector, in right of his church. Other free tenants are named ; as, Thomas del Hall, Thomas Gray, and others. The next who are named are malmcn tenants, who are distinguished probably in the Boldon Book by the name of frmarij, their ser vices being the same. In this manor was a common kiln. The bond tenants were under great servility ; for, besides the various payments in scat or exchequer oats and money, &c. for 30 acres which each bondsman held, he wrought three days in every week for the lord, except at Easter and AVhitsuntide, and twelve days at Christmas. At certain kinds of labour, each had the bishop's allowance of his corrody (erowdy), or a loaf of bread. It appears there was a moor belonging to Sedgefield, called Le Brok ; but its situation is unknown. The town of Sedgefield is situated 11 miles south-south-east of Durham, and 248 miles north north-west of London. It stands on an eminence, open to every aspect, and is remarkable for the health and longevity of its inhabitants; from which circumstance it was called, by the celebrated Dr. Askew, the Montpelier of the north ; and he frequently sent his convalescent patients to it for the benefit of pure air. The turnpike road from Durham to Stockton runs through Sedgefield ; and in the centre of the town is a large square, where a market is held every Friday, and large cattle fairs on the first Fridays in April and October. A fair for the sale of swine is also held here on the first Friday in every month. Sedgefield was first made a market-town by grant from Bishop Kellaw, in the year 1312; with a fair for five days, to be holden on the eve of Edmund, archbishop of Canterbury, and on the three following days. It appears, that though the above grant was made to hold a market on Friday, a custom prevailed of exposing merchandise on the sabbath-day, which being complained of by John de Whytechurch, then rector, Bishop Bury issued his inhibition, commanding the sheriff' to proclaim the same. The market, which had gra dually dwindled into insignificance, was revived in 1827, and is now well supplied with corn, poultry, butter, &c. On the east side of the market-place stands the endowed school-room (see Charities), which is a substantial structure, faced with freestone, and was erected by subscription in 1826, on the scite of the previous building. The lower part is used as a prison for the detention of criminals, or the punishment of petty offenders. Cooper's alms-houses are situated on the south side of the road leading from hence towards Stockton. There are several respectable houses in the town, and the whole has an air of great neatness and cleanliness. The Wesleyan Methodists have a small chapel here. A boarding-school is kept at the west end of the town by the Rev. WilUam Middleton, curate; and there is also a ladies' boarding-school and some smaller seminaries. About 100 chil dren are taught at the church Sunday-school, established by the late rector. There are six inns * Assart rent, imposed on licence to stub up forest lands, and convert them into tiUage \u2014 Bract, lib- 4, ca. 38, no. 11."], [572, "428 STOCKTON WARD\u2014 N. E.

A well-conducted benefit-society, consisting of about 240 members, is supported by the inhabitants of the town and the surrounding district ; and there is a small circulating library. An ancient custom prevails at Sedgefield on Shrove-Tuesday, on which day the parish-clerk is obliged to find a ball for the use of the townsmen and the country-people, who assemble for the purpose of playing a game at foot-ball ; after which the victorious and the vanquished resort to the public houses, where they generally \" drink deep e'er they depart.\" The lands near the town are fertile and beautifully enclosed ; and the whole of the adjacent country is in a high state of cultivation,* The Church. Sedgefield church is a large building, standing to the east of the market-place. It consists of a chancel, a transept, a nave with two side-aisles, and a lofty square tower. The latter is sup ported by buttresses at the corners, and is ornamented with hexagonal turrets, bearing short spires. It contains five bells, and has a good clock with a dial to the west. The length of the nave and side-aisles is about 12 feet, neatly pewed. There are four pillars on each side of the nave, with clustered capitals of foliage and corbels of human heads, and supporting pointed arches. Each of the aisles is lighted by two pointed windows, and there are three smaller windows on each side of the nave above. The transept is nearly as long as the nave. The south end is kept as a vestry-room, inclosed by a low screen of wood, and lighted by a large window to the soutli and two side windows to the east, under pointed arches. The north end of the transept is lighted in the same manner, and contains a gallery belonging to the Russell family of Hardwick. Beneath the lofty arch which separates the nave from the chancel is a highly decorated screen of tabernacle work, surmounted by seven elegant spires of the same, forming an object of no com mon beauty. The chancel is nearly 36 feet in length to the steps which rise to the communion table, and the space within the rails is large and commodious. The whole chancel is wainscotted with oak, in pannelled work, about eight feet high, ornamented with cherubs; and there are seven handsome stalls on each side, in the cathedral style. The present rector has recently repaired and beautified this part of the church, which has a mosaic pavement, and is lighted by a large window to the east and three on each side, under pointed arches. The east window is divided into five lights by stone mullions : in the centre are the arms of the present bishop of Durham ; on the north those of Lord Viscount Barrington, the late rector ; and on the south those of the Rev. T. L. Strong, the present incumbent, at whose expense this window has been renewed. At the west end of the church is a good organ, with a clock in front, which conceals the or ganist's seat, and is dated I7O8.7 The font is a large octagonal bason of black marble, sculptured * John Reed died at Sedgefield in May, 1826.

Chantries. \u2014 In 1379, Bishop Hatfield, by his charter dated September 16, granted licence to John de Henly, parson of Sedgefield, to found a chantry, and to endow the same to the yearly value of .PIO, for two chaplains and their successors for ever, who were to celebrate divine service in the chapel of St. Catherine in Sedgefield church. In 1386, Bishop Fordham gave to his be- loved servant, Henry Pillok, of Sedgefield, four acres of land, an escheat in Sedgefield, which John-Atte-Style, of Stibington, had appropriated to the parish church of Sedgefield, -without ob- taining the bishop's licence for so doing. In 1392, Bishop Skirlaw, by his charter, dated Septem- ber 20, granted licence to John de Henlie, clerk, WiUiam de Langchester, yicar of St. Oswald's, and AVilliam de HiU, chaplain, to give one garden, 30 acres of land, and three acres of meadow, with the appurtenances in Butterwick ; one messuage, 30 acres of land, and three acres of mea- dow, with the appurtenances in Aldacres ; and five marks rent out of Hoton, to John de Bishopton, chaplain, custos of St. Catherine's chantry, to be held by him and his successors, &c. for their better support. In 1435, Bishop Langley, by charter, dated June 6, granted licence to AViUiam Hoton de Herdewyk, to assign six messuages, two cottages, and 170 acres of land, with the ap- purtenances in Sedgefield, to Thomas Hoton, chaplain, custos of St. Catherine's chantry, to be held by him and his successors, chaplains of the said chantry, for their better support and main tenance. The north transept was appropriated to this chantry, which, at the dissolution, was of the yearly value of \u00a311, 8s. 8d. It is not known when or by whom the chantry of St. Thomas, in the south transept, was founded. At the dissolution, it was of the yearly value of \u00a35, 6s. ; and Richard Turner, the last incumbent, had a pension of \u00a34 per annum, which was paid to him in 1553. In October, 1764, as some workmen were repairing the floor of this porch (then and since used as a vestry), they found a large stone image, \"curiously cut out,\" near six feet long, and lying in full length, with an arch over it, but without any inscription. Here was also a guild, or chantry, dedicated to St. Mary ; but its date and founder are un known, though the names of some of the aldermen are preserved in the bishop's copyhold books. An indulgence was granted by Bishop Fox for the reparation of the chapel and altar of the Blessed Virgin, in the year 1500.

In the pavement of the north aisle is a large stone, with two inlaid figures of brass, representing skeletons in shrouds. These figures are each about half a yard long. That on the left side has the shroud wrapped around the lower part of the waist; but in that on the right, it is thrown quite open. Much discussion has arisen relative to the origin and meaning of these and similar figures; some imagining they were emblems used by the knights of Jerusalem, and others that they were exclusively appropriated to ecclesiastics. But Hutchinson, after enumerating a variety of such opinions, sensibly remarks, \" By these sculptures it was only meant to inculcate the vanity and mutability of human felicity and greatness, and to remind the spectators that every man, however rich, powerful, dignified, adorned, or handsome, must inevitably, some time or other, put on the disgusting appearance there represented.\" The church-yard is planted with lofty trees, and contains a number of tomb-stones. There was formerly a thoroughfare through this cemetery ; but, in consequence of the damage inflicted byr idle persons, it has been shut up by the present rector, and the whole is now very neat and orderly. Upon a blue oval marble on the outside of the east end of the chancel : \u2014 \" In the vault beiow are deposited the remains of Robert Spearman, of Old Acres, Esquire, who employed the leisure and abilities which God had given him, in the study of his word and his works.

P., * Robert Lowth, second son of Dr. AVilliam Lowth, was born November 29, 1710, probably at Buriton in the county of Hants. He received the rudiments of his education in Winchester college, where his school exercises were distinguished by uncommon elegance ; and having resided the requisite number of years in that seminary, in 1730 he succeeded on the foundation at New College, Oxford. He took the degree of M. A. June 8, 1737; and, after improving his talents in that university, he was elected, in 1741, to the professorship of poetry, re-elected in 1743, and whilst he held that office he read his admirable lectures De sacra poesi Hebr\u0153orum. In 1744, Bishop Hoadly collated him to the rectory of Ovington, Hants; added to it, nine years afterwards, the rectory of East AVeedhay in the same county ; and in the interim raised him to the dignity of archdeacon of Winchester. These repeated favours he some years afterwards acknow ledged in manly and respectful terms of gratitude. On July 8, 1754, the university of Oxford conferred upon him the degree of D. D. by diploma ; an honour vvhich, as it is never granted but to distinguished merit, was probably conferred on Mr. Lowth in consequence of his \" Prelections on the Hebrew Poetry,\" which had then been lately published. Having, in 1749, travelled with Lord George and Lord Frederick Cavendish, he had a claim upon the patronage ofthe Devonshire family ; and in 1755, the duke being then Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Dr. Lowth went to that kingdom as bis grace's first chaplain. Soon after this appointment, he was offered the bishoprick of Limerick ; but preferring a less dignified station in his own country, he exchanged it with Dr. Lesley, prebendary of Durham and rector of Sedgefield, for these prefer ments. In November, 1765, he was chosen F. R. S. In June, 1766, he was, on the death of Dr. Squire, preferred to the bishoprick of St. David's; which, in tlie October following, he resigned for that of Oxford, vacant by the translation of Bishop Hume to Salisbury. In April, 1777, he was translated to the see of London, vacant by the death of Bishop Terrick ; and, in 1783, he declined the offer of the primacy of all England. Having been long afflicted with the stone, and borne the severest sufferings of pain and sickness with the most exemplary fortitude and resignation, this great and good man died at Fulham, November 3, 1787; and, on the 12th, his remains were privately interred in a vault at Fulham church, near those of his predecessor. He had married, in 1752, Mary, the daughter of Laurence Jackson, of Christ-church, Hants, Esq., by whom he had two sons and five daughters. His lady and two children only survived him. Dr. Lovvth's literary character may be estimated from the value and the importance of his works. To the Latin of his \" Prelections on the Hebrew Poetry,\" it is probable that no critic of the Augustan age could have objected. In 1758, he published \" The Life of William of AVykeham, Bishop of AVorcester,\" with a dedication to Bishop Hoadly, which involved him in a dispute concerning a decision which that bishop had lately made respecting the wardenship of Winchester college. In 1762, was first published his \" Short Introduction to English Grammar,\" which has since gone through many editions. In 1765, Dr. Lowth was engaged in a controversy with Bishop AVarburton, which made much noise at the time. In 1778, Bishop Lowth published his last great work, \"A Translation of Isaiah.\" Several occasional dis courses, which, by his station, he was at different times called upon to deliver, were of course published, and are all worthy of their excellent author. Of his poetical pieces none display greater merit than \" Arerses on the Genealogy of Christ,\" and \" The Choice of Hercules,\" both written very early in life. He wrote a spirited \"Imitation of an Ode of Horace,\" applied to the alarming situation of this country in 1745; and likewise some \" Verses on the Death of Frederick Prince of AVales,\" with a few smaller poems. Learning and taste, however, did not constitute Bishop Lovvth's highest excellence. His amiable manners rendered him an ornament to his high station, whilst they endeared him to all with whom he conversed ; and his zeal for the interests of true religion made him eager to promote to places of trust and dignity such clergymen as he knew were best qualified to fill them. He united, indeed, in an eminent degree, the qualities of the gentlem \u25a0n with those of the scholar: he conversed vvith elegance, as he wrote with accuracy. His piety had no tincture of moroseness ; his charity no leaven of ostentation. To his whole diocese he was endeared by his laudable discretion and his useful zeal. To the world he was a benefit by his exemplary life and splendid abilities ; and whilst virtue and learning are reverenced among men, the memory of Lowth will be respected and admired."], [577, "SEDGEFIELD. 433 1777, P- res.

In Mr. Blakiston's time, this mansion was returned as consisting of \" a hall, a parlour, certain chambers, with other houses adjoining upon the same house, a gallery, a study, a chamber fallen down, a coach-house, a gate-house, a house at the west gate, a pidgeon-house, a stable, a barn, an ox-house, a hide-house, a wind-mill, and other houses.\" The place was much improved by Dr. Pickering, Dr. Morton, and Dr. Ekins. On December 31, 1792, a fire broke out in one of the lodging-rooms, vvhich consumed the greatest part of the buildings before it was extinguished. The present rectory is neat and spacious, with pleasant gardens and fish-ponds to the south. Bishop Rich, by his charter dated 20th July, 1501, granted licence to Roger Leyburne, rector of Sedgefield, to inclose 60 acres of land lying on the soutli side of the rectory, being parcel of the glebe of the said church, and to hold them so inclosed to him and his successors for ever. On a division of lands in Sedgefield parish, July 25, 1636, there was allotted \" to the parson 30 acres for his consent. The bishop's wastes, upon a survey, appear to be about two acres and a half, which the bishop gave to the rector ; and in regard the value of the tithes was likely to be lessened by the division, the parties interested therein, out of their own lands, were willing to give to the rector so much land in the east field as would make up the two acres and a half (given by the bishop) 30 acres, in lieu of the supposed loss ; and in lieu of eight beastgates which the rector then had in the south moor, the remainder of the said east field, being 15 acres, was allotted to the rec tor and his successors. Ten acres, which were first allotted to AViUiam SwalweU and John Thomp son in lieu of two cottages, were bought by the land-owners, and are allotted to the bishop in lieu of his wastes ; to the rector, in lieu of his glebe lands, allotted 115 acres and 27 perches in the east moor.\"-f- A farm on this property, about a mile to the south-east of Sedgefield, is now called Gloiver-over-him. * George, fifth Viscount Barrington, of Ardglass, in the county of Down, and Baron Barrington, of New castle, in the county of Dublin, M. A., prebendary of Durham, and rector of Sedgefield, was born July 16, 1761, and died at Rome on the 15th March, 1829. He was third son of Major-general the Hon. John Barrington, by Elizabeth, daughter of Florentius Arassal, Esq. George Barrington was admitted a king's scholar at AVestminster in 1774, whence he was elected to Christ Church, Oxford, in 1778- He obtained the degree of M. A. in 1785, and having taken holy orders, was, in 1786, presented by his uncle, Bishop Barrino-ton, who then held the see of Salisbury, to the prebendal stall of North Grantham in that cathedral, and in right of that stall took the vicarage of Grantham, in Lincolnshire, which he resigned on being pre sented by his uncle (then translated to Durham) to the rectory of Sedgefield. He resigned his stall in Sa lisbury in 1802, having been preferred to a prebendal stall at Durham. Mr. Barrington succeeded to the Viscounty on the death of his brother Richard, in January, 1814- Lord Barrington married, February 12, 1788, Elizabeth, second daughter of Robert Adair, Esq., by whom (who survived him) he had issue ten sons and five daughters: 1. AVilliam-Keppel, born 1773, now Ariscount Barrington, who married, in 1823, Jane-Elizabeth, fourth daughter of Lord Ravensworth ; 2. George, a captain in the royal navy, who married, in 1827, Caroline, third daughter of Earl Grey ; 3.

D. 434 The rector is entitled to all the tithes of the parish. In 1739, Mr. Gamage, then rector, filed a bill in the Hio-h Court of Chancery against several land-owners in the township of Sedgefield, in order to break through a composition made by Dr. Naylor, and compel the payment of tithes in kind. In Michaelmas term, the defendants filed a cross bill to establish the composition, which bad been accepted by six preceding rectors, and also by Mr. Gamage himself for about nine or ten vears after he became rector. In 1741, these causes came on to be heard before Lord Chancellor Hardwick ; and he decreed tbe payment of tithes in kind, with costs against the defendants, and dismissed the said bills with costs. The composition was dissolved, because the bishop of Durham, who was patron of the living and ordinary of the diocese, was not a party to Dr. Naylor's agree ment with his parishioners. Charities.

It is not known from whence these premises were derived. The master also receives a portion of the rents of the Howie Hope estate, hereafter mentioned (being at present \u00a35 a year), in respect of a sum of \u00a352 old school-stock, which was laid out in part purchase of that property. The schoolmaster is elected by the rector and the 24 of the parish. For the income above mentioned he instructs, in reading, writing, and accounts, six poor children of the township, elected at a vestry-meeting held annually at Easter. Six boys are also sent to the master of this school by the trustees of the charity of Richard AVright, hereafter mentioned, for whose edu cation they pay him \u00a312 a year. The other children pay for their instruction. The average number of scholars, boys and girls, is between 40 and 50. Wright's Charity. \u2014 Richard AVright, by will, July 23, 1790, bequeathed \u00a3300 to his wife and the Rev. Jeffery Ekins, D. D-, rector of Sedgefield, Ralph Ord the elder, Henry Leighton, and Michael Forster, upon trust, to invest the same in the purchase of three per cent, consols, in their names, and to transfer the same to new trustees whenever their number should be reduced by death to two. They were to apply the divi dends for the educating and placing at school and clothing such six poor boys, legally settled in the town of Sedgefield, and of an age not less than six years or more than 14, as after the decease of his wife, the rector and 24 of the said parish should from time to time appoint. The Commissioners for inquiring concerning Charities say, \"The boys are not clothed, and the reason assigned is that the amount ofthe dividends (\u00a312) is sufficient only to provide for their education. It appears, however, that the usual charge for the instruction of each boy in this school is only 30s. per annum ; we therefore suggested that this sum only should be paid for the instruction of each boy, and that the residue of the income should be applied according to the direc tions of the testator in providing them with clothing as far as the same will extend.\" Lowther's Charily. \u2014 John Lowther, by will, October 19, 1792, directed that \u00a3600 stock should be trans ferred to trustees, to apply the dividends for and towards the education and clothing of such poor female children as he had then placed, or should thereafter place at school, at Sedgefield, and such others as the said trustees or their successors should think proper to place at the said school. The dividends from this stock are remitted to the churchwardens. Eight girls were, up to July, 1828, educated and partly clothed from this charity ; they were appointed at the annual vestry meetings, and selected from the most regular at tendants at the Sunday-school, their advancement to the benefit of this charity being considered as a reward for their good conduct. The schoolmistress received \u00a34, 16s. yearly for instructing the girls in reading and sewing, and each girl received clothes to about the value of \u00a31, 5s. annually. It was found at the settling of the accounts, at the time just mentioned, that there was a balance of about \u00a325 in the churchwardens'"], [579, "SEDGEFIELD. 435 hands, exclusive of one year's dividend then due ; and it was therefore resolved that six additional children should be appointed to partake of the benefit of the charity until the balance should be exhausted. Bainbridge s Charity. \u2014 John Drake Bainbridge, by will, October 16, 1811, bequeathed to the rector for the time being of the parish of Sedgefield, \u00a350, upon the same trusts, and for the same purposes, as in the will of John Lowther deceased, mentioned above. The sum of \u00a345 was remitted to the churchwardens in respect of this legacy, the duty having been first deducted, and was placed in the hands ofthe late Lord Barrington, the rector, until an opportunity should occur for investing it in the purchase of land. The yearly sum of \u00a32, 5s. has been paid as the interest, and has been added to the fund given away at February, as hereafter mentioned. It appears that the directions of the testator as to the application of this charity were not known. Cooper's Alms-houses. \u2014 Thomas Cooper, by will, March 6, 1702, demised to George Cuthbertson and John Mowbray, and their heirs, all his messuages, lands, and tenements, within the chapelry of Hamsterley, and at Hyndon in the parish of Cockfield, subject to the trusts thereinafter expressed, viz. that they and the survivor, and the heirs of such survivor, should receive the rents and profits, and pay thereout yearly, for ever, to each of five poor men and five poor women (being of the age of 50 years at the least, and living and remaining in the township of Sedgefield) the sum of \u00a34 half-yearly, by equal portions, the said poor men and women to be nominated after the decease of his wife, by the rector and the 24 of the said parish for the time being, or the major part of them, whereof the rector should be one ; and that they should also, out of the said rents and profits, provide for each of the said poor men and women a coat of the value of 8s. against Christmas yearly. The overplus of the said rents and profits (if any) were to be paid to his wife or her heirs. The testator also directed, that, if he himself should not erect a suitable alms-house in his life-time, the sum of \u00a3100 should be given to the said trustees for that purpose; and also that if such alms-house should stand in need of repairing, the charges thereof should be deducted equally out of the several annuities given to the said poor people ; that the said coats should be of a blue colour, with the letters T. C. upon the arms, in yellow ; and that if any of the said poor people should refuse to wear the same so distinguished, they should be adjudged unworthy the said gift, or of having a habitation in the said alms-house ; that the said alms-people should not admit any person whatsoever to dwell with them, unless in case of sickness. And he further directed, that if at any time there should not be within the parish of Sedgefield the whole number of ten poor people, aged and qualified to be elected for the said gift, the deficiency should be sup plied out of the township of Cornforth, in the parish of Middleham, by such persons as should be qualified and elected as aforesaid. The yearly sum of \u00a344 is paid half-yearly by the owner of the Hamsterley estate. He pays 40s- every half-year to each .of the alms-people, and at Christmas he pays them the further sum of 8s. each, in lieu of providing them with cloaks of that value. Wrightson s Charity. \u2014 It is stated on a table of benefactions that AVilliam AVrightson, Esq., in the year 1803, gave \u00a35 yearly out of a field near Beacon, in the township of Sedgefield, to be divided between the 10 alms-people, and it seems that a deed was executed for the purpose. The field was afterwards purchased by the late Lord Barrington, and the yearly sum of \u00a35 was paid by him, and given to the alms-people on St. Thomas's day. Forster s Charity. \u2014 Thomas Forster, by will, November 15, 1814, directed that the sum of \u00a32400 should be invested in the names of his trustees, upon trust, that they should apply so much of the dividends thereof as they should think necessary, in purchasing suitable clothes for the inmates of Cooper's alms-houses at Sedge field, at or about Christmas yearly, and should dispose of the remainder thereof in equal proportions amongst or for the use of the said poor men and women. And he further directed that \u00a3600 should in like manner be invested, and that the trustees should apply the dividends in the purchase of bread of good quality, to be distributed every Sunday morning, after divine service, amongst 20 of the most deserving poor persons resid ing in the same parish and the township of Sedgefield, who should not receive parochial relief. In respect of the first-mentioned legacy, the executors purchased \u00a33435, 7s- 9d., and in respect of the latter, \u00a3858, 16s. lid. three per cent, consols. The half-yearly dividends on the first of these sums, amount iris to \u00a351, 10s. 7d-, are transmitted to the rector and churchwardens, who divide the same equally amongst the inmates of Cooper's alms-houses. Part, however, has been occasionally applied in repairing the alms house ; but this has been generally done after the death of one of the alms-people, out of the half-year's allowance which would have become due if such person had lived. In respect of the half-yearly dividends on the latter investment, amounting to \u00a312, 17-s. 8d., 20 sixpenny loaves are provided every Sunday, and given to 20 poor persons selected by the rector and parish officers from such of the poor of the township of Sedge field as do not receive parochial relief. The weekly distribution of 10s. worth of bread somewhat exceeds the amount of the dividends, and the deficiency is made up from Harrison's charity hereafter mentioned."], [580, "436 STOCKTON WARD,\u2014 N.E. D. Lamb's Charity. \u2014 John Lamb, of Manchester, by will, November 26, 1808, directed that on the death of Martha Furness (who is still living) all his personal estates, with the exception of \u00a3100, should be settled for the support of five poor aged impotent men, and five poor aged impotent women, who for the time being should be inhabitants of the parish of Sedgefield, and who should be thought most deserving thereof. This sum, amounting to \u00a3484, 7s- 3d., is intended to be laid out in the purchase of land, and to be applied to the same purposes as Cooper's charity, agreeably to the design of the testator. Lady Frcville's Charity. \u2014 Dame Elizabeth Freville, by will, July 1, 1630, directed her executors to pur chase, in the names of eight trustees, lands, tenements, or hereditaments, of the yearly value of \u00a320, or a perpetuity of the same value, to be disposed of by the said trustees as follows : viz. \u00a312 thereof for the yearly binding out apprentices three poor children, to be chosen by the said trustees, the same to be equally divided for that purpose, the choice to be made for the two first years within the parish of Sedgefield, and the third year within the parish of Bishop-Middleham ; and she directed that out of \u00a38, residue of the said yearly sum of \u00a320, 2s. a piece should be given yearly to 60 of the poorest people within the parish of Sedgefield, and 20 of the poorest people within the parish of Bishop-Middleham, the said poor people to be yearly no minated by the parsons, vicars, or curates, and overseers of the poor of the said parishes for the time being. And she declared, that if the lands purchased should be improved to a greater yearly value than \u00a320, such increase should be bestowed amongst the residue of the poor of the said parishes proportionably. And she expressly forbade the children to be put apprentices to weavers or tailors, such being poor trades. Soon after the death of the testatrix, the trustees purchased a copyhold estate in Bishop-Middleham, known by the name of the Poor-Carrs, comprising eight parcels of land, and containing 86 a. 1 r. 17 P. exclusive of the stells, or wide open ditches by which the parcels are divided. The property is generally let by auction every three years, in different parcels, tothe best bidders. On May 13, 1827, it was let to seven tenants, for rents amounting to \u00a3169, 10s. The lord's rent, \u00a31, 18s. 8d., is paid by the tenants. The rents are received by the trustees ; and after payment of sundry small expenses (including 4s. modus to the rector of Sedgefield in lieu of all tithes), the sum of \u00a312 is set apart for the apprentices, and the clear resi due is divided into four parts, three of which are appropriated to the parish of Sedgefield, and one to the parish of Bishop-Middleham. This money is distributed in sums varying from 5s. to 15s. The apprentices are selected by the trustees at their annual meeting at Sedgefield, two being taken yearly from Sedgefield and one from Bishop-Middleham. The sum of \u00a34 is paid as a premium with each child, and the restrictions with regard to not binding them to weavers and tailors are attended to. Harrison's and Wren's Charities. \u2014 It is stated on the table of benefactions that Bryan Harrison, in 1663, gave \u00a3100, the interest thereof to be given to the poor of the town of Sedgefield every Sunday, and that with \u00a380 of that money a house near East Well, and a field near Ryall were bought, \u00a320 remaining in the parish stock. The house is situate in the town of Sedgefield, and with a piece of ground containing about three fourths of an acre is let to the overseers at the yearly rent of \u00a35, they keeping the buildings in repair. The premises are used as a poor-house- The field near Ryall is called the AVhite Bread Field, and is also situate in the township of Sedgefield. This was let by auction to Benjamin Stubbs, on an agreement for six years from May 1826, at \u00a313 a year. In the year 1820, the sum of \u00a330, 6s- 4d. was advanced from the overseers' accounts for the purpose of draining this field, which was then let at the yearly rent of _\u00a36, 10s. ; in conse-. quence of vvhich improvement, the property has advanced to its present rent, and the sum advanced by the overseers is nearly paid off. It further appears from the churchwardens' books, that in 1759 it was ordered at a vestry that the sum of \u00a330, given by Rebecca AVren to the poor of the parish of Sedgefield, should be laid out in building and re pairing the premises first above mentioned, and that the said house should be chargeable vvith the payment of the said sum, with interest at the rate of sive per cent. Out ofthe rents above_mentioned, now amounting to \u00a318 a year, there is paid to the overseers \u00a36, 10s. towards the liquidation of the debt incurred in draining the land, and the remainder is disposed of in a. weekly distribution of bread, beginning soon after Christmas, and continuing as long as the money lasts. Howie Hope Estate, \u2014 The churchwardens of this parish are possessed of some copyhold land, held of the manor of Bishop-Middleham, containing about 28 acres, called Howie or HoUoway 's Hope. The first moiety of this property appears to have been purchased in 1705 for \u00a3100, 2s. 6d. The other moiety was purchased about 1734 for \u00a3140. The following benefactions appear to have been applied towards these sums: \u2014 \u00a3. 1663. \u2014 From the gift of Bryan Harrison, \u00a380 having been laid out in the purchase of a house near East AVell and other premises, as before stated ... ... ... ... ... 20 1680. \u2014 Henry Airey, the interest to be given to the poor of the town of Sedgefield on Feb. 17 yearly 10 1 684 \u2014 Robert Johnson, the interest to be given to the poor of Sedgefield on St. Thomas's day yearly 2ft"], [581, "SEDGEFIELD. 437 \u00a3. 1685 \u2014 John Gibson, the interest to be given to the poor of the town yearly ... ... .... 3 1686. \u2014 Thomas Barker, the interest to be given to the poor of the parish on Candlemas-day ... 10 1739. \u2014 Alice Vane, the interest to be given to the poor of the township of Sedgefield ... ... 5 Amount of school-stock, whereof \u00a320 was given by Mrs. Freville ... ... ... ... 52 Bequest of Madam Mary Freville to the poor ... ... ... ... ... ... 20 The premises called the Howie Hope, with a cottage and barn lately erected thereon, are let by auction, and produce above \u00a340 a year.

The remainder, after deducting 13s- 3d. yearly for land- tax, and the amount of any incidental expenses, is distributed amongst the poor of the parish of Sedgefield, on the 14th February. The produce of Bainbridge's Charity before mentioned, and of Jane Mason's Cha- rity hereafter mentioned, together with any surplus of Lady Freville's Charity undisposed of on St. Thomas's day, money collected at the sacrament, and a voluntary donation by the rector, are added thereto, and given at the same time. On February 14, 1828, the sum given avvay amounted to \u00a375, 5s. Ud., which was dis- tributed amongst the poor of all the townships at the school-house, in nearly the same manner as the produce of Lady Freville's charity. Jane Mason's Charity \u2014 A table of benefactions states that Jane Mason, in 1662, gave 20s. yearly to the poor of the parish, charged on a close called Shotton Newkes, by the proprietor of vvhich it is still paid. Township op Embleton. \u2014 Lamb's Charily. \u2014 The table of benefactions states that William Lamb, in 1728, gave \u00a35, the interest to be given to the poor of Embleton. This sum is placed in the hands ofthe rector of Sedgefield for the time being, by whom the interest is paid every four years to the overseer of Em- bleton, for distribution amongst the poor of that township. Township of Fishburn. \u2014 Airey' s Charily. \u2014 The table of benefactions states that Henry Airey, in 1680, gave \u00a37, 10s., the interest thereof to be given yearly to the poor of Fishburn on February 14. This money is now in the hands of Farrow Chilton, Esq , by whom 7s- 6d. is distributed annually as the interest. Mason's Charity. \u2014 It is stated on a table of benefactions that AVilliam Mason, in 1696, charged upon his lands in Fishburn \u00a31, 4s-, to be given to the poor there, and 6d- a-piece at Christmas, Easter, and Pente- cost, to every poor widow. The sum of \u00a31, 4s. (which is all that has been paid for many years) is now con tributed in equal portions by John Chilton, John Richardson, and the tenant of William Beckwith, Esq. The payment is due on February 14. and is given away by the overseer to about ten poor persons. Woodifield's Charity \u2014 It is further stated on the table of benefactions that John AVoodifield, in 1744, gave \u00a320, the interest to be given to the poor of Fishburn. This money was in the hands of AVilliam Ar rowsmith, who became insolvent, and the money was lost many years ago. Layton (East and West) is a manor in the constablery of Sedgefield, from which town it is dis tant two miles to the south-east. It was part of the possessions of the Mundevills, and was some time held of them by the Brackenburys, by rendering a barbed arrow at entrance, or 40d. It descended to the Latons, and afterwards belonged to the family of Conyers. Ralph Conyers, Esq., forfeited his life-estate in the manor of Layton for being engaged in the rebellion of the Earls of Northumberland and Westmoreland. The property, however, descended to his family under an entail. Colonel Cuthbert Conyers, of Layton, fell in the service of King Charles I., at Malpas in Cheshire, in August, 1644. This manor is now the property of AVilUam RusseU, Esq., of Brancepeth, M. P. Hardwick. About half a mile west of Sedgefield stands the manor and hall of Hardwick. Under Hatfield^s Survey, Roger Fulthorp and John Herdwick held this manor, by homage, fealty, suit of court, and 10s. rent. In 1391, Thomas AVatkinson, of Elstob, was seized of a moiety of the manor. John de Herdwick died, seized of his proportion, in the 9th year of Bishop Skirlaw; and Agnes, his daughter and heiress, married Gilbert de Hoton, who died in the 12th year of the same prelate, seized in her right, leaving John his son and heir. The families of Cramlington and KiUinghaU vol . i. 5 T"], [582, "STOCKTON WARD.\u2014 N. E. D. 438 soon after held possessions here ; and, in 1500, John Hebborne, in right of Ellen his wife, and AVilliam Hansard, in right of Elizabeth his wife, as daughters and coheiresses of John Hoton, had livery of his lands. Soon afterwards, Hardwick appears to have been wholly the estate of the Hebbornes ; and John Hebborne, Esq., in 1507, obtained licence to alien the manors or townships of Herdwick and Shotton, nigh Sedgefield, to Ant ion y Mitford and others; which alienation must have been in trust or settlement, for Anthony Hebborne, Esq., whilst he was seized of the manor, was attainted of high treason in the Northern Rebellion, and forfeited his manor of Hardwick and lands in Mainsforth and Bishop-Middleham.* In the 32d year of Queen Elizabeth, Hardwick was granted, by letters patent, to George Frevill, Esq., as a reward for his services during the rebel lion, with remainder to Elizabeth his wife, and to William Jennison, under a reserved rent of \u00a325, 19s. 6d. George Frevill, Esq., was afterwards knighted, and died in 1619, leaving Nicholas Fre ville his son and heir, who was charged with a horse and its furniture for the service of Kinff *\u25a0 o o Charles I. His daughter, Margaret, married Thomas Lambton, son of Sir William Lambton, Knt. ; and afterwards Nicholas Conyers, of Bowlby, co. York, and of Biddick, co. pal., Esq. Freville Lambton, son of Thomas and Margaret, married, 1. Ann Milward, of Uttoxeter, Staf ford ;-f 2. Thomasine Milward ; and, 3. Ann, daughter of Judge Wright. By his second wife he had issue Thomas, whose six daughters and coheirs sold Hardwick, in 1748, to John Burdon, Esq., from whom it passed to the family of the present proprietor, William Russell, Esq., M. P. Hard wick Hall is at present the residence of Baron Hunsdon, of Skatterskelfe in the county of York, son-in-law to his majesty King AVilliam IV. The pleasure-grounds at Hardwick, formed during the proprietorship of John Burdon, Esq., are laid out with exquisite taste, and the ornaments are supremely elegant. The walks and planta tions are formed on an easy inclination, facing to the west. The hall is spacious, fronting the south, and commands a beautiful view of the principal objects of the scene. On passing near the north margin of the largest lake, the first erection which meets the eye is a Gothic seat, with steps in front, and protected by a porch. From hence may be seen the whole expanse of the lake, forming one of the finest sheets of water in the north of England, covering 36 acres, and margined with grass slopes and plantations of flowering shrubs and evergreens, thickened with forest trees behind, and all kept in admirable order. The Bath stands at the western extremity of this lake, and is a neat building, with Doric co lumns in front. In the vestibule is a bust of Diana ; and over the fire-place of one of the dressing rooms is a head of Neptune, in alto-relievo, with an appropriate scroll of shells and flowers. On the fire-screen of the other dressing-room is a painting of Apollo and the Muses. Here is also a curious antique table. Hid amidst lofty trees, and approached by confined and winding walks, stands the Bono Retiro, a kind of hermitage. In front of this erection is a small lake, at the further end of which is an artificial cascade, beautifully reflected by a mirror within the porch of the building. In the stair case, &c. are busts of Newton, Bacon, Locke, Aurelius, Boyle, and Cicero. There is a neat small study in the upper story, the domed ceiling of which is ornamented by fresco paintings. * As Hebborne's name occurs neither in the list of English fugitives in Scotland nor in Flanders, it seems probable that he either perished in the rebellion or was executed. Some of his descendants were seated in Oxfordshire. t This lady, on her death-bed, desired her husband to marry her cousin, Thomasine Milward ; which he accordingly did."], [583, "SEDGEFIELD. 439 s On emerging from the plantations on the south of the lake, the admiring visitor approaches an elegant temple in the Ionic order, erected on a circular eminence. This building is square, sur- rounded by a colonnade of six pillars on each side, and surmounted by a finely-formed octagonal dome. In niches around the walls are busts of Homer, Virgil, Horace, Milton, Shakspeare, Ben Jonson, and Pope; but a fine head of Dryden has recently been stolen. From the colonnade may be seen Heighington, Shackleton, and Brusleton towers, Windleston house, Merrington town and church, Ferryhill, Mainsforth, Bishop-Middleham, the heights of Garmondsway, Sedgefield church, and most of the pleasure-grounds. In the interior of the temple, over the entrance, is a bust of Minerva ; and arranged on brackets around the walls are those of Socrates, Plato, De- mosthenes, Julius C\u00e6sar, Titus, Marcus Brutus, and Antoninus Pius. The inside of the cupola is adorned with paintings by the Bornese, father and son. In the centre is Minerva, surrounded by genii and warlike trophies; over the windows are the four cardinal virtues, Prudence, Justice, Fortitude, and Temperance ; and in the corners are pictures of Music, Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture. The stucco work dividing the compartments of the ceiling, and medallions of the four seasons in the recesses between the windows, were executed by Cartisi. In triangular divi sions at the four corners is an inscription, which reads as follows: \u2014 \"This Temple begun by John Burdon, Esq., in the year 1754, and finished in 1757- On leaving the temple, the path leads over a picturesque bridge, erected across a serpentine river, the extremities of which are lost amongst the plantations surrounding it. A statue of Nep tune, in the act of throwing his trident,* stands on a pedestal in the middle of the river, at a little distance from the bridge. The artificial ruin consists of a small central apartment, above a pointed arch, and flanked at three of the corners by fragments of walls and towers, and at the fourth by an entire circular tur ret. It is designed to appear as having extended further to the east. Several curious fragments of sculpture from Guisborough Priory are built up in the walls. The prospect from the top of the tower is grand in the extreme. The Banquetting House stands near the east end of the large lake, and is built in the most su perb style, in the Corinthian order. The entrance is at the back part, within which is an exquisite little bust of Momus. The principal apartment is 50 feet long, 25| feet in breadth, and of an equal height. At each end is a semicircular recess, supported by Ionic pillars, and containing a bow-window. The front windows are plain. Over the fireplace is a very finely-executed full length portrait of Mr. Burdon ; and on four brackets, on the same side of the room, are busts of Flora, Sappho, Faustina, and Cornelia. On the opposite side are heads of Virgil, A^itruvius, Palladio, and Inigo Jones. The ceiling is painted in an elegant style : in an oval in the centre is the Feast of the Gods, by Hayman ;-f to the right, in a square, Thetis suppbcating Jupiter for * This statue resembles the one in the market-place of Durham. It must be confessed that in both the attitude is neither the most elegant nor the most natural.

E. D. her son ; and to the left, A^enus delivering the cestus to Juno, both by AVale. The stucco work is very fine, and the mouldings richly gilt. The mantle-piece is composed of several beautiful and well-contrasted specimens of different kinds of marble ; and even the grate is highly ornamented. At the further end of the room is a door, corresponding to the entrance, and leading to a neat re tiring apartment. The designs for the several buildings were made by Payne, and executed by Mr. Bell, of Dur ham. The grounds contain 150 acres, of which 46 acres are covered with water. The enumera tion here given of the principal objects in this delightful place, will certainly fall far short of imparting a complete idea of its numerous beauties, to effect which the language of poetry alone is adequate. Whether the visitor contemplates the beauty of the plantations \u2014 the blue and rippling surface of the lake, enlivened by its painted barge and flowery margin \u2014 the pleasing solitude of the hermitage \u2014 the architectural proportions of the various buildings \u2014 or the excellencies of the many works of art with which they are adorned, \u2014 he will be equally astonished and gratified, and will pronounce Hardwick to be a place where, in the language of Pope, \"gods might wander with delight.\" The liberal permission afforded to strangers to examine and admire the grounds, affords, also, a striking contrast to the morose and selfish system of exclusion which environs the seats of many of oui English gentry. Fishburn. The village of Fishburn lies on the side of a hill sloping to the soutli, and about two miles north of Sedgefield. It is a neat and pleasant place, containing two public houses, a corn-mill, two blacksmiths, a millwright, &c. The Wesleyan Methodists have a chapel here. Lord Crewe's* trustees have endowed a school in this village with \u00a35 per annum, and the poor are periodically relieved with the proceeds of certain charitable bequests (see page 437)- The township of Fish burn contains ten farmsteads. The family of Claxton held this manor of the bishop in capite at an early date, by homage, fealty, and suit of court. After several generations, it passed by marriage to the family of Conyers of Horden. The De-la-Poles held lands here, with other large possessions in this country. In 1388, a portion of Fishburn formed part of the forfeitures of Michael De-la-Pole, but was again restored in 1416, and became the property of William De-la-Pole, Earl of Suffolk. In 1615, Ro bert Ferroe, or Farrer, held lands here. Farrow Chilton, Esq., of Fishburn Hall, is now the principal proprietor in this township. when Nash fell into the kennel. His companion, in endeavouring to raise him, fell down also, on which Nash muttered, \" What's the use of troubling yourself? The watch will come by soon, and they will pick us both up.\" In dress and manners Hayman was remarkably negligent. One evening, at the club held in Gerrard Street, Soho, Cosvvay, a brother artist, called in after a visit at court, in red-heeled shoes, and other wise dressed a-la-mncaroni ; when the room was so full that he could not find a vacant seat. \" What, canst thou find no room ?\" said Hayman to him in a sneering manner : \" come here, my little Jack-a-dandy, and sit upon my knee, my little monkey.\" \u2014 \" If I did,\" retorted Cosway, \" it would not be the first time that the monkey rode the bear.\" After the death of stirs. Hayman. on looking over the charges for her funeral, the affectionate husband observed to Payne the architect, who was his particular friend, and who knew on what indifferent terms they lived, at the same time shrugging up his shoulders, \" Well, I ought not to gTumble, for she would have paid such a bill for me with pleasure.\" Hayman, it is said-, painted the original Barley Mow in Piccadilly; in reference to which, Hogarth has introduced him in one of his pictures as a. sign-painter, with the elbows of his coat torn, and the shirt visible."], [585, "SEDGEFIELD. 441 Embleton-, Anciently Elmedon, is a hamlet, township, and chapelry, four miles east-by-north from Sedgefield, and containing twelve farmsteads. Here is a chapel of case, in which the curates of Sedgefield al ternately perform divine service every Sunday morning. This place anciently gave name to the family of Elmedon, in whom it continued until Elizabeth, the daughter and heiress of AVilliam Elmedon, intermarried with AVilliam Buhner. The Buhners resided at Elmedon, and were styled of that place, till the beginning of the 17th century ; when it was alienated by Sir Bertram Bul mer and Dionisia Bulmer to Sir AVilliam Gascoign and Sir Nicholas Tempest. Murton, or East Moreton, is a hamlet in this township, consisting of four farms, five miles east north-east from Sedgefield. This estate formed part of the possessions of the Elmedons, from whom it passed to the Buhners. A resident family appears to have assumed the name of Morton ; and, in Bishop Skirlaw's time, the Claxtons had lands here, held of the Earl of AArestmoreland. Murton is now held by various proprietors. . Swai?iston is situated three miles east from Sedgefield, and contains three farms; High, Middle, and Low Swainston ,- near the latter of which are the vestiges of several houses, which appear to have been formerly a considerable village. This place was part of the estate of the Elmedons. Buttekwick, Is a hamlet and township two miles east-by-north from Sedgefield, containing four farms and a publichouse. By Boldon Book, Utredus de Buttervvick paid the bishop half a mark ; and the vill paid 32s. for cornage, provided one milch cow and one castleman, and rendered eight chalders of malt, the like of oats, and the like of meal ; and for each carucate of land, the villains ploughed and harrowed two acres at Sedgefield, dressed four portions of land with one man from each house, and carried a ton of wine and a millstone to Sedgefield. The drenge tenant fed a dog and horse, provided two greyhounds for the chace, and five cords of provender, attended the court, and served on embassies. In Hatfield's Survey the rent is stated at \u00a36, 13s. 4d. In Bishop Bury's time, John de Hoton died seized of this manor, at the same rent. This family soon after took the name of Butterwick ; and the principal part of the estate rested in their descendants, in the male and female line, for several generations. Other families, at different times, held possessions here. Butterwick is now the property of Mrs. Salvin, of Croxdale. Oldacres is mentioned both in Boldon Book and Hatfield's Survey as paying 16s. rent to the bishop. It was part of the ancient possessions of the Fulthorps ; and a moiety of it afterwards passed to the Cramlingtons, and, by the marriage of Alicia their heiress, to the Burtons of Scarbo rough. It was the seat and property of the late Robert Spearman, Esq., \" whose name is highly celebrated in the literary world,\" and whose father purchased this estate of the family of Butler, to whom it had been given by the crown, as a reward for services performed in the great rebellion of the Earls of Westmoreland and Northumberland;. It is now the seat of Mrs. Charlotte Swinburn. Foxton and Shotton. This township consists of a hamlet with five farms called Foxton, and two farms bearing the appellation of Shotton, two miles south-by-east from Sedgefield. Foxton was part of the posses*. vol. i. 5 U"], [586, "STOCKTON A\\rARD.\u2014 N. E. D. 442 sions of the Knights of Jerusalem ; and, on their dissolution, it devolved to the crown. Queen Elizabeth, on the 10th December, in the 21st year of her reign, demised it for 21 years to Ralph AArestharp, by letters patent, to hold the same as of the manor of East Greenwich, free of all out going, except small rents reserved to the bishop and chapter of Durham, particularly 20s. to the bishop. The families of Seton, Carrowe, Sayer, De-la-Pole, Elstobb, and Fulthorp, anciently held possessions here. In the 14th year of Bishop Booth, Roger Thornton died seized of 100 acres of land, held of Sir Robert Claxton, Knight ; and 115 acres and two oxgangs of land in Foxden, held of John Sayer and Thomas Seton. The manor became, in the last century, the estate of Carlton Carr, Esq., of Haughton ; and was by him limited to the family of Bates of AVolsingham, a near relation in the female line, of whom Mrs. Alexander, widow of the said Carlton Carr, pur chased the inheritance. Shotton appears to have belonged generally to the same proprietors with Foxton. It was part of the estate of John Hebborne in 1507, mentioned in the account of Hard wick. Foxton and Shotton are now the property of William Russell, Esq., of Brancepeth, M. P. MOKDON, A village and township two miles south-west from Sedgefield, contains ten farmsteads and a public house. This is one of the places said to have been given to the see by Snaculf, the son of Cykell. In the first year of Bishop Bury, William, the son of Thomas de Shotton, died seized of two messuages and 60 acres of land in Mordon, held of the bishop in capite, by homage, fealty, and the fortieth part of a knight's fee. Having no issue, Alicia, the daughter of Roger de Grendon, was his heir. In the 4th year of Bishop Hatfield, John de Kellaw, jointly with his wife Elizabeth, held three parts of the vill of Mordon of the bishop in capite, by the service of half a knight's fee. In the succeeding year, John Harpyn died seized of two parts of the vill, which he held by homage, fealty, and half a knight's fee, leaving Thomas his son and heir, who died soon after ; and in the inquisition taken on his death, it appears he was to find two priests to say daily mass. Not having issue, Johanna, his sister, inherited. Soon after, a resident family assumed the local name ; re specting whom, and the descendants of Harpyn, much confusion occurs in the records. The ma nor of Mordon descended, with Thornley, to the Trollops, by whom it was claimed in every succession, as long as their name remained upon record. It has latterly passed through the fami lies of Hodshon, Ward, and Sleigh, and is now the property of Richard Wright, Esq., of Sands. Bradbury and the Isle Form two manors and one township, containing seven farms, with a small village called Bradbury, and a few scattered houses, 2 -J miles west from Sedgefield. The Isle contains two of the above mentioned farms, and is completely surrounded by two branches of the Little Skerne, which sepa rate about one mile south-south-west of Bradbury, and unite again about half a mile north of Preston. There was formerly a chapel of ease here, dedicated to St. Nicholas; but no vestiges of it now remain, though the curate's house is still standing, and is let to a tenant for 30s. a year. Sands House, the property and residence of Richard AA'right, Esq., is situated about a mile west south-west from Sedgefield. It is a spacious and elegant house, and commands an extensive and delightful prospect of the surrounding country. Mr. Cade, the antiquary, was of opinion that Bradbury is a corruption of Brimesbury, and that King Athelstan fixed his camp near this place, when he gained a decisive victory over the Danes,"], [587, "SEDGEFIELD. 443 in 937. In Leland's Itin. vol. viii. p. 52, Bradbury is thus mentioned: \" Swaculf, filius Kikelli, dedit S. Cuthberto Bradebyri ;\" but how the see became deprived of this manor does not appear. The manors of Bradbury and the Isle were the estate of the family of De-la-Pole, which they held of the bishop in capite, by the service of half a knight's fee. In the 14th year of Bishop Booth, Roger Thornton died seized of the manor of Bradbury, with the Isle, which became part of the possessions of the Lumleys, in right of Thornton's heiress. In the 7th year of Bishop Barnes, George Bowes, Esq., did homage for this manor, which afterwards came to the crown by the for- feiture of Henry Earl of Huntingdon, and Sir AA'illiam Bowes, in the great rebellion of the Earls of AVestmoreland and Northumberland. King James I., by letters patent, bearing date October 19, in the 14th year of his reign, demised the manor of Bradbury, with that of Hilton near Stain- drop, to Thomas Emerson, Esq., for the term of 1000 years, under the yearly rent of =\u00a3550. Richard Manning purchased the term ; and King Charles I., in the 14th year of his reign, granted the inheritance to Edward Manning, his brother, under the same reserved rent. One Henry Mar- ley purchased Hilton for the residue of the 1000 years' term; and thereupon the rent was appor- tioned, charging Hilton with \u00a3160, and Bradbury with \u00a3390, which was entered in the books of the auditor for the crown. Afterwards, the Mannings sold Bradbury to John Ferrer, of the city of Durham, Gent. Arrears of the rent having accrued, Cromwell, by his warrant under the privy seal, dated at Westminster, April 15, 1658, adjusted the apportionment before mentioned, and ratified the same, so that the manors of Bradbury and Hilton should be charged with their own respective rents and arrears only, and not for the whole, or for the defaults of the other of them. The Claxtons and sundry others held parcels of land in Bradbury. The Tempests of the Isle were descended from the family of Tempest of Holmside.* Bradbury and the Isle are now the property of Richard Wright, Esq. * Sir Thomas Tempest, Knt., was attorney-general of Ireland. During the protectorship, he compounded for his estate for \u00a3134. His son, John Tempest, Esq., of the Isle, and of Old Durham by his marriage with the heiress of John Heath, of Old Durham, Esq., was colonel of a regiment in the army of King Charles I. At the Restoration, he was nominated for a Knight of the intended Order of the Royal Oak, which was never carried into effect, from the fear of exciting discontents and jealousies. His estate, as re- turned, was valued at \u00a31000 per annum. During the struggle between Bishop Cosin and the freeholders of the county, respecting the sending of members to parliament, John Tempest and William Davison, Esqrs-, were sent to London by the magistrates to endeavour to procure that privilege. Although their mission was unsuccessful, yet their zeal was duly appreciated, and they were received on their return to the county with great rejoicings. The following extract of a letter from the bishop to his secretary, Miles Sta- pleton, Esq., betrays the spleen with which this affair was viewed by him : \u2014 \" The newes that you write of Mr. Jony Tempest and his vain-glorious coming in triumph with one hun- dred and fifty horse before him into the country lookes like a great insolence or somewhat that is worse, for he is neither lieutenant nor deputy lieutenant, nor hath he any office under the king, or the bishop, and what this triumph tends unto, or who were the men that listed themselves to meet him and stir AA7[illiam]] D^avison], if you tooke notice of them as it may be you did, you shall not doe amiss to let us know with all other circumstances that belong to that matter.

This small parish is bounded on the north by Sedgefield parish, on the west by Aycliffe, and on the south and east by Bishopton ; and consists of the townships of Great Stainton and Elstob. The whole parish comprises about 1600 acres; and, in 1821, it contained 154 inhabitants. The annual value of property assessed to the county-rate in 1828-9 was ,\u00a31732. The soil of this parish is fertile and well cultivated, and some meadows near the church are remarkably luxuriant. Stainton-le-Street, Or Great Stainton, is a small village, pleasantly situated in a fine country sloping to the south, about 5 miles south-by-west from Sedgefield. It contains a public house, a blacksmith's shop, and a cartwright, machine-maker, &c. This place, from its name, as well as from several traces of foundations in the adjoining fields, seems to have been formerly a much larger town than it is at present. To the north-east of the church is a place still called Cross Hill, from which it might be inferred that a cross formerly stood here ; but there are no records to countenance such a supposi tion. Stainton Grange, a little to the south-west of the village, is unoccupied, and, with its offices, is falling fast into decay. The township contains four farmsteads. The Church. To the west of the village, on an elevation, stands the church, a small edifice, without a tower. It consists of a nave and chancel, separated by a pointed arch. The chancel is seven paces long and four wide, lighted by a window of three partitions under an obtusely pointed arch to the east, and by two windows to the south. The nave is twelve paces long and six wide, without side-aisles ; and its windows are modern. The pulpit stands on the north side of the entrance to the chancel, and the reading-desk on the south side. The altar is an unadorned wooden table ; and the font is an octagonal bason of freestone. Texts of scripture, in plain black frames, are arranged on the walls. The interior of the church is white-washed and kept remarkably clean ; and the whole has an air of primitive simplicity and homeliness. able Argument to persuade all the Grand Juries to petition for a new Parliament, or a List of the principal Labourers in the great Design of Popery, &c.\" Amsterdam, 1677 \u2014 he is called \" a Papist, a Pensioner, and a Court-dinner Man, and has got a Customer's place at Hull for his son.\" * In November, 1754, an attempt was made to obtain a commission of sewers to drain these Carrs; a scheme that met vvith great opposition, on the plea that though such a measure would undoubtedly have been highly advantageous to the proprietors, every other estate on the Skerne, down to the Tees, would have been inundated.

Thomas Nicholson, of Great Stainton, by will, January 26, 1745, gave and devised all his interest in certain leasehold lands, called the Moats, and Camper Close, in Northallerton, held by lease for 21 years from the bishop of Durham, and also the sum of \u00a3100 in money, to trustees, to sell the lease hold premises, and to place at interest the money arising from such sale, and the said \u00a3100, and to apply the proceeds thereof to a salary to a schoolmaster for teaching the poor children of the whole parish of Great Stainton to read English, and to write, and arithmetic ; and he directed that such schoolmaster should be nominated and put in, and removed for reasonable causes, by the owners for the time being of his estates in the county of York, or the major part of them, under their hands and seals ; and in case they should neglect to nominate such schoolmaster for six months after the death or removal of the preceding master, then that the rector of Stainton might nominate a master for that turn only ; and he directed that such schoolmaster should be of the Church of England, and should teach the children the Church Catechism and the exposi tions thereof by Dr. Nicholson, Dr. Kenn, Dr. AVake, Bishop Beveridge, a little book called the Art of Catechising, and Lewis's Catechism ; and he willed that such master should be removable for neglecting his duty, or for gross immorality ; and that the owners for the time being of his said estates should be visitors of the said school ; and he declared that such bequest was upon condition that the freeholders of Stainton should at their own expense provide a convenient school-house. The leasehold property devised by the testator is stated to have been sold for \u00a384, which, with the pecuniary legacy of \u00a3100, produce an interest of \u00a37, 7s- annually. In 177L the trustees of Lord Crewe's charities directed \u00a360 to be applied to the use of the Stainton school. Of this sum, \u00a340 was laid out, June 24, 1774, in the purchase of a rent-charge of \u00a31, 12s. issuing out of a messuage or tenement, with the closes or parcels of land thereto belonging, in the parish of Stan hope, payable yearly on Christmas-day, clear of all deductions, in trust, for the use and benefit of the master of the school of Stainton, with a power of distress in case of non-payment. A further donation of \u00a3100 was made to the school by the same trustees in 1779, in the expectation that others would thereby be induced to contribute to the like purpose ; and the sum of \u00a360 was thereupon given by Anthony Hubbuck and Isa bella his wife, on condition that, in settling the school, the privilege of sending four poor scholars of Little Stainton should be secured after their decease to their successors in the house in which they then resided. The several sums of \u00a3100 last given by Lord Crewe's trustees, \u00a320 the remainder of the former donation of \u00a360, and the sum of \u00a360 given by stir, and Mrs. Hubbuck, were laid out in 1780 in the purchase of \u00a3290, 10s. 2d. stock, three per cent, consols, now standing in the name of the Rev.

It contains the two townships of Grindon and Whitton ; the joint population of which,. in 1821, amounted to 314, consisting of 66 families, of whom 54 resided in Grindon and 12 in AVhitton. In 1828-9, the annual value of the lands and buildings in the parish was estimated for the county-rate at \u00a3'2420. Grindon. This township has not a village of its own name, but consists of the park and hall of Wynyard, the village of Thorp-Thewles, and a few scattered houses, 5A miles north-north-west from Stock ton. The manor of Fulthorp, or Foulthorp, in this township, was long the residence and property of the ancient and honourable family of that name, and was held of the bishop in capite, by mili tary service. Grindon was held jointly with Fulthorp by the same family. The last heiress married Robert Raikes, of Northallerton, who assumed the surname of Fulthorp. A farm-house in the township of Grindon is still called Fulthorp.

Nothing has been paid for upwards of 20 years, and there does not appear to be sufficient evidence to support any claim that can now be set up. In the same returns it is stated that some person unknown gave to tbe poor of AAliitton \u00a320, then vested in Henry Hutchinson, and producing 16s. per annum. This sum was lost by the failure of the bank of Hutchinson and Co. in Stockton, in i825, no proof of the debt having been made under the commission of bankruptcy.

Sir Henry Lisle, by his deed, without date, gave to Alan Langton, and Catherine his niece, all the lands he had or might have within the lordship or territory of AVynyard. Peter Wykes, who married Sir Hugh Capel's second daughter, sold his wife's part of the manor to Sir John Lisle, Knt., who gave the same to Alan Langton, and Catherine his wife, who was his daughter. Roger Fulthorp, and Alice his wife, gave to Henry, the son of Alan Langton and Margery his wife, the fourth part of this manor, by their deed, dated 1316, which fourth part Roger and Alice had of William de Cullye.

This parish is bounded on the north and north-east by the parish of Hart, on the east by Stran ton, on the south-east by Greatham, and on the south and west by the Emeldon Beck, dividing it from the parishes of Billingham and Sedgefield. This parish contains 18 farms and 24 scattered houses; and the population, in 1821, amounted to 176. The annual value of the lands and build ings was estimated for the county-rate, in 1828-9, at <\u00a32212. Hutchinson says, \" In this parish there is neither town or village, cottage house for the poor, surgeon or apothecary, midwife, black smith, joiner, house-carpenter, mason, bricklayer, cart or wheel-wright, weaver, butcher, shoe maker, tailor, or barber, schoolmaster or schoolmistress, ale-house, public bakehouse, grocer or chandler's shop, or a corn-mill.\" A public house near Embleton, and a few cottages, are the only exceptions to the above list in the present day. The Marquis of Londonderry possesses property * The following are copies of the acknowledgments usuaUy returned for these favours : \u2014 \" The inhabitants of Thorp-Thewles desire to express to the Marchioness of Londonderry their grateful sense of her unbounded liberality to the needy and infirm in that village and neighbourhood, and of her great consideration for the present and future welfare of the poor children who are so liberally educated and clothed at her ladyship's expense. \" Thorp, Saturday, October 15, 1829.\" \" The most noble Marquis of Londonderry. \" Having lately received \u00a32, 2s. from your lordship, being your lordship's annual subscription to the Friendly Society at Thorp for the relief of the sick and infirm, \u2014 at a meeting for the transaction of the bu siness of the society, it was resolved to express our thankfulness for so liberal a subscription. It is, indeed, impossible for us to find words to express the sense which we entertain for your unbounded liberality to wards us. If we, therefore, appear not to thank you as we ought, it is because words, not feelings, are denied us. We should be dead to the sensations of gratitude if we did not acknowledge the numerous favours conferred upon us. And to your lordship's amiable lady our heartfelt thanks are due. AVe can never refer but with sentiments of the utmost deference and respect for her unbounded liberality to the needy and infirm in the village of Thorp. She is deeply interested in our welfare, and we feel persuaded that whatever adds to our prosperity invariably adds to her ladyship's pleasure. \" And we have the honour to be your lordship's most obedient and humble servants. \" Thorp, October 14, 1830.\""], [596, "STOCKTON WARD\u2014 N.

It is about 9$ miles north -by-east from Stockton, and 2 miles east from Embleton in Sedgefield parish. The \" multitude of steps\" by which it was approached from the north-east in Hutchinson's time, are now removed ; and the ascent is by a steep road and foot-path. On the south side of the church is the tower, a low, square structure, beneath vvhich is the entrance-porch, under a circular arch, dated 1813. On the south wall of the church is an antique sculpture, apparently representing the Crucifixion ; and near the north wall lies a semi-octagonal pediment. The whole of the walls have been recently pointed ; and brick drains, or gutters, are placed around the church, for carrying off the water which runs from the top. The nave is divided from the aisles by three round columns on each side, supporting pointed arches ; and is about thirteen paces long, and, with the aisles, twelve paces wide. There is a large window under a semicircular arch to the west, two pointed windows in the north aisle, and a square modern window in the south aisle. The entrance from the nave to the chancel is beneath a low semicircular arch. The length of the chancel is about seven paces, and its breadth five* The east window contains three compartments, under a pointed arch ; and there are two lights, similarly divided, to the south.

Elwick Hall, the rectory-house, is a handsome mansion, standing on the north bank of the dene above mentioned, opposite to the church, and sheltered by rising plantations. In the general array of the clergy on Gillygate Moor in 1400, the rector of Elwick furnished one lancer and two archers. The writer of the Elwick Parish Register exclaims that \" maryinge by justices, election of re gisters by the parishioners, and the use of ruling elders, first came into fashion in the times of rebellion, under that monster of nature and bludy tyrant, Oliver Cromwell !\" There are no public charities in Elwick Hall parish. The manor of Stotfold in this parish was held, in the 14th century, of the bishop in capite, by the family of Kilkenny, rendering sixpence, called wodesilver. It afterwards became the estate of the Earls of AVestmoreland. Newton Hansard manor, m the time of Bishop Hatfield, was held by WiUiam Dacre, Esq., of the bishop in capite, by the service of the fourth part of a knight's fee and suit of court, which manor the Couutess of Lincoln had, and died without issue. Ralph his brother was his heir, who granted the manor to Katherine de Qwhitfield, for his life ; and she, four years afterwards, by fine levied in the bishop's court, granted the same to John Neville de Raby, Esq. It was subsequently comprised in the several inquisitions taken on the deaths of the Earls of Westmoreland. Bruntoft manor was part of the ancient estate of the Claxtons ; but there are no particulars known relative to Amerston. William Sheraton, of Elwick, was a captain iri the army of King Charles I. He refused to compound, and his estate was sold. PARISH OF HART. The parish of Hart is bounded on the north and north-west by Monk-Hesleden parish, on the south-west by Elwick Hall, on the south by Stranton, and on the east by the sea. It contains six townships and one parochial chapelry : \u2014 1. Hart, with Hartlepool chapelry ; 2. Nesbit ;* 3.

Hart. The village of Hart is situated on an eminence sloping eastward to the sea, with a small rivulet running through it, and commands a fine view of Hartlepool peninsula, and of the coast for some miles to the north and south of that place. It is 11 miles north-by-east from Stockton, and 4 miles west-by-north from Hartlepool. Adjoining to the churchyard on the south-west is the man sion-house of the Ellerker family ; and a little further to the west are the remains of an ancient buUding, apparently monastic, in which, according to local tradition, the celebrated Robert Bruce was born. It is now partly occupied as farm offices. The Rev. Robert Taylor, the resi dent curate, keeps a boarding-school in the village ; which also contains a day-school, two public houses, a common brewery, a mill, two joiners, &c. ; and the township includes eight farmsteads. The parish-feast is held on the Sunday and Monday before Old St. Magdalen's day. The history of Hart will be included in that of Hartlepool. The Marquis of Cleveland is now lord of the manor. \" Hart lordship\" contains 4165 acres, 3 roods, and 39 perches.* The Church. Robert de Brus, or Bruce, who founded Gisburne, gave the churches of Hart and Stranton, with their chapels, to that priory; and Bishop Kellaw, by his charter bearing date the 12th of the kal. of November, 1311, confirmed to the church of St. Mary of Gyseburn, and the canons there serving God, the donations and confirmations which his predecessors, bishops of Durham, had granted them, with the concurrence of their chapters, viz. the church of Hart and its chapel, the church of Stranton and its chapel of Seton, with all their lands which Robert de Brus gave them, and which Hugh Pudsey, bishop of Durham, with the consent of his chapter, confirmed to their proper use ; and all the lands and rents which AArilliam and Robert de Brus gave them in the towns of Hert and Hertillpolle, viz. of the street called St. Mary's Street, and of other rents in the same town. Hart church stands on an elevated situation. The chancel, which is divided from the nave bv a large circular arch, has a spacious window to the east, and a smaller one on each side. The nave has two side-aisles : that to the north is formed by one short column, supporting circular arches, and is lighted by two side windows and one to the east ; and the south aisle has three small octagonal pillars supporting obtusely pointed arches, with two side windows and one to the east, under pointed arches. The tower is low. On the inner wall of the entrance-porch are six grotesque heads. The font, which is apparently formed of the limestone common in the neighbour hood, is beautifully ornamented. The base is sculptured with cherubs' heads; and the shaft which is octagonal, contains the images of various saints, bearing their appropriate symbols, and placed in niches. Around the bottom of the bason are foliage and cherubs ; and in seven of the * In the grant for life to Queen Henrietta Maria, \" Totum ilium annualem redditum sive feodum firmum nostrum viginti duarum librarum de rectoria & ecclesia de Hart & Hartlepoole in ep'us Dunelmensi nobis h\u00e6redibus & successoribus nostris exeuntium & solubilium.\" \u2014 Rymer's Feed. vol. xviii."], [599, "FRAGMENTS OP THE WAI.I.

Monumental Inscriptions. \u2014 On a highly ornamented marble tablet, in the south wall of the chancel : \u2014 \" This monument was erected to perpetuate the memory of the Ellerker family, who died at Hart.

On a mural monument in the south aisle: \u2014 \" This monument was erected by John Scurfield of Stockton, in gratitude to the memory of three worthy ancestors and a beloved wife, whose remains are here deposited ; John Scurfield his grandfather, George Scurfield and Joanna his father and mother, and Jane his wife, who died the 3d day of Nov1- 1756, aged 42. John Scurfield died October 12th, 1780, aged 70 years.\" The church-yard, as well as the interior of the church, is extremely damp, notwithstanding its elevated situation. It is, however, now undergoing the process of draining, by which, it is proba ble, the whole will be much improved. In 1587, the plague raged with great violence in Hart and its neighbourhood. No fewer than \"89 corses\" were buried here, one of which was \"a young woman unknown, who died in the street.\" The Parish Register* contains the following entries : \u2014 \"December 17, 1596.

Charities Brumley's Charity. \u2014 From an entry in the parish books, it appears that Robert Brumley, by deed, No vember 24, 1668, gave to the poor ofthe lordship of Hart, and not elsewhere, the sum of \u00a320, the interest to be applied towards putting out apprentice such of the indigent poor as after his death his executors should think fit- There is also entered in the register an account of the distribution to the poor of \u00a31 yearly, in respect of this charity, to the year 1687- \"The principal,\" say the Commissioners for inquiring concerning Charities, \" is supposed to have been laid out by Edward EUeker, with other money given to the poor by one Barker, in building three cottages on land belonging to the Marquis of Cleveland (stir. EUeker having then acted as steward of the estate) ; and in the Parliamentary Returns of 1786 there is mentioned, as the gift of a person unknown, the sum of \u00a335, stated to be vested in Edward EUeker, and producing \u00a31, 15s. per annum. Of the cottages so supposed to have been built, one has been fitted up for a school by the Mar quis of Cleveland, another is inhabited by a pauper placed there by the overseers, and the third is let as a blacksmith's shop by the overseers at 20s. a year. For these premises a small rent is paid as an acknowledg ment to the Marquis of Cleveland. Nothing appears ever to have been given to the poor, or applied in putting out apprentices, in respect of this property.\" Toivnship of Dallon-Pierry. \u2014 In the Parliamentary Returns of 1786 it is stated that the sum of \u00a320 was given to the poor of Dalton-Piercy by some person unknown, and was then vested in Mr. Chilton. This sum, say the Commissioners, \" is novv in the hands of Robert Colman, of Hart-on-Hill ; and there is a me morandum in one of the township-books, signed by stir.

During the hay harvest, having gone accidentally to a neighbouring well to procure a draught of water, he let hi* rake drop, which struck upon something metallic. He immediately sent his servant girl home ; and taking off his brogues, he contrived to make two purses of them, which, after having descended into the well, he filled with broad pieces of gold.

In 1464, William Wilbefosse, Esq., held the manor of Nesbit of the bishop of Durham by 18d. service. It consisted of the scite of the manor, worth nothing; 120 acres of arable land, of the annual value of 4d. each; 12 acres of meadow, 12d. each ; and 100 acres of pasture, 9d. each.

Thorp-Bulmer, A small township, consists of three farms and houses, 12 miles north-by-east from Stockton, and 5 miles north-west from Hartlepool. It was the estate of Sir John Bulmer ; but, on his attainder for high treason, it passed to the see of Durham in 1537, and was transferred, by Bishop Tunstall, to his nephew, Bryan Tunstall, and his heirs. It afterwards became the property of the Lawsons, and was subsequently divided amongst different proprietors. Th roston, Anciently Thurstenton, is a hamlet and township 11 miles north-north-east from Stockton, and 2\\ miles west-by south from Hartlepool, and contains four farms.

It contains a mill, two public houses, two schools, with shopkeepers, joiners, smiths, &c. ; and the township includes ten or twelve farms. A tile-manu factory has recently been established in the neighbourhood of the village.

It is about 20 miles east-south east from Durham, 12 miles north-north-east from Stockton, and 249 miles north-west-by-north from London. In 1821, it contained a population of 1249 persons, consisting of 570 males and 679 females, being an increase of 202 since the census of 1811. The number of inhabited houses, at the same time, was 259. The annual value of the lands and buildings assessed to the county rate in 1828-9 was \u00a31198. Name. \u2014 Antiquaries, as usual, have differed in their opinions respecting the etymology of Hartlepool. Mr. Cooke goes so far as to consider this word as a corruption of Heracleopolis, from the Tyrian Hercules. Mr. Cade thought that Hart ness was an artificial Roman harbour, and derived its name from the redness of the stone or soil. Mr. Hutchinson says, \" Perhaps the pre sent peninsula was in former times completely insulated by the tide at high water, through artifi cial means, and being covered with a forest, was the peculiar haunt of deer ;\" and he observes that the appellations Heortu or Heorthu, and Herutey, have been agreed by commentators to sig nify Hartland, or the Isle of Harts. This opinion is strengthened by the fact of the horns and teeth of these animals having, since Hutchinson's time, been discovered in great quantities in this neighbourhood. Sir C. Sharp observes that Hart, according to Dufresne, is a Teutonic word, signifying a forest ; and that Hart-in-pol, or Hart-le-pol, (in or near the pool or sea) received that name to distinguish it from the older town of Hart. That a forest did formerly exist here is evi dent, from the discoveries of trees buried in the earth ; and this will also account for the antlers of deer found here, which animals, of course, would resort to such a place. History. There are no records in existence concerning the origin of Hartlepool as a town and port, or of its early history. In Tanner's Notitia Monastica, under the title Hartlepoole, it is stated, \" At or near this place was the ancient monastery called Heorthu, founded upon the first conversion of the Northumbrians to Christianity, about A. D. 640, by a reUgious woman named Hieu, or, as some copies have it, St. Bega, whereof St. Hilda* was some time abbess.\" In 643, Oswy became king * See page 273. Bede says, \" The religious servant of Christ, Hilda, governed the monastery with ex emplary piety and regularity ; and Bishop Aidan and other pious men, from their high estimation of her inherent wisdom, and her ardour for the divine ministry, were accustomed sedulously to visit, earnestly to love, and diligently to instruct her.\" Her pious example at home, and the fame of her virtues abroad, con tributed much to the advancement of Christianity ; and from her active benevolence, she received the name of \" mother.\""], [605, "HARTLEPOOL. 459 of Northumberland ; and previous to a battle with Penda, the Pagan king of Mercia, he made a solemn vow to God, that if he prevailed, he would dedicate his daughter, Alcfleda or Eandfleda to the service of heaven, in perpetual virginity, and grant twelve farmholds, with the appurtenant lands, for the erection and endowment of religious houses. Having gained the victory, this Saxon Jephthah immediately performed his vow by giving his child, scarce one year old, to be brought up in the holy church in the monastery of Hcortu. In 658, Hilda, with the princess and ten other virgins, removed from hence, and took possession of a religious house endowed by Oswy at Whitby. No traces can be discovered respecting the monastery at Hartlepool from this period until the year 800, when the Danes destroyed Tinmouth and Hartness. The scite of this monas tery has not been preserved even by tradition ; but it is probable that it was upon or near the spot where the Friary was afterwards built. In the Chronicle of Lindisfarne, quoted in Lambard's Dictionary, p. 145, it is said, \" Heortnesse, a town in the north partes, which Ecgred, bishop of the Holy Isle (from 830 to 845), builded and gave to the see for ever.\" Prior to the Norman Conquest, Hart and Hartness, together with other rich manors and large territories, were possessed by Fulk de Panell, whose daughter Agnes con veyed them in marriage to Robert, son of Robert de Brus, one of the attendants of AVilliam the Conqueror.* This Robert founded the priory of Guisborough in 1129, and gave thereto the churches of Hart and Stranton, with their dependant chapels. He was lord of Skelton, Yarm, Danby, and other places, in Yorkshire, and of Annandale, in Scotland. In the interim, the terri tory of Hertness was successively laid waste by the inroads of Malcolm III., king of Scotland, and the revengeful expedition of AVilliam the Conqueror. f Robert de Brus died in 1141 ; when Adam, his eldest son, succeeded to his estates in Yorkshire, and Robert, his second son, to the lordship of Annandale, the manor of Hart, and the territory of Hartness, for which he paid, in 1171, one hundred shillings into the exchequer as scutage. He gave to the monastery of Guisborough six oxgangs of land in Stranton and one in Hart; J and, dying about 1171, was succeeded by Robert, his son and heir. On July 13, 1174, Hugh, Count of Bar, nephew to Bishop Pudsey, landed at Hartlepool with a body of Flemings, consisting of 40 knights and 500 foot soldiers, to assist in the invasion by AVil liam the Lion, king of Scotland; but on learning that that monarch was a prisoner at Alnwick, the infantry were immediately sent back to their own country. In 1189, Bishop Pudsey purchased the earldom and wapontake of Sadberge for ever, and the earldom of Northumberland for life, from King Richard L, for the sum of \u00a3?1 1,000 ; and from this period, Hartlepool was held of the bishops of Durham as chief lords of the see. * Dugdale asserts that Brus received the manor of Hart from the crown for his \" many great services.' Perhaps the king might chuse to reward a favourite by giving him an heiress in marriage. t Speed says, \" He wasted all the faire country betwixt York and Durham, leaving all desolate for three score miles space, which nine years after lay untilled, and without any inhabitants, when grew so great famine that these northerns were forced to eat the flesh of men.\" X Upon a dispute between the canons of Guisborough and the monks of Tynemouth, it was agreed, that the demesnes here amounted to four hundred five score and one acre and a half, and five score and eight acres that Roger de Camera held of the demesnes here. The richly endowed priory of Guisborough was valued at the dissolution at no less than \u00a3628, 3s. 4d per annum."], [606, "460 STOCKTON WARD\u2014 N. E. D. The fourth Robert de Brus, who died in 1191, was succeeded by his son William, who obtained a grant from the crown of a weekly market to be held on Wednesday ; and King John, by his charter, dated February 8, in the second year of his reign, granted and confirmed to his subjects of Hartlepool that they should be free burgesses, and hold the same privileges and liberties as the burgesses of Newcastle.* In the 17th year of his reign, 1216, he confirmed to Robert, the son of William Brus, the market granted to his father, and added the privilege of holding an annual fair for three days, on the feast of St. Lawrence and the two days following.-f- During the minority of Robert, son of AVilliam de Brus, a contest ensued between his guar dian, Peter de Brus, lord of Skelton, and Richard Poor, bishop of Durham, respecting certain wreck of the sea claimed by the latter ; and some of the most forward of the friends of Brus seized and imprisoned a burgess of Hartlepool, known to be friendly to the bishop. On the prelate's excommunicating the offenders, however, the burgess was liberated, and it was agreed that the bishop should have the wreck of the sea without contradiction. J Robert de Brus died in 1245, and was succeeded by his son, Robert, the sixth of that name, who \"builded the haven and wall about the towne of Hertlepole, with ten towers on eche syde of the haven, and a chayne to be drawne between them near the haven, which haven would hold a C sayle.\" The importance of the situation was obvious, as it was capable of receiving ships and troops from the continent on every emergency, when the northern Borders were troubled. In consequence of his improvements, Brus was enabled to support his market and fair at Hartlepool, and to levy duties on ships and fishing-boats entering his harbour there. He was one of the can didates for the crown of Scotland; but resigned his pretensions, and died in 1295. His son, Ro bert, had engaged in the wars of Palestine ; and, on his return, he married Martha, daughter and * King John, by charters dated 1201, 1214, and 1217, granted and confirmed, for their faithful services, to his burgesses of Newcastle upon Tyne, and to their heirs for ever, the privilege that none of them should be distrained out of that town for the payment of any debt for which he was not chief debtor or surety \u2014 that none of them should be tried by duel \u2014 that they should be allowed to traverse in pleas of the crown-, according to the ancient custom ofthe city of Winchester \u2014 that none of them should be judged of misera cordia money (arbitrary amerciaments), but according to the old law of Winchester \u2014 that they should hold justly their lands, tenures, recognizances, and debts from whomsoever owing \u2014 that their lands and tenures within that town should be held rightly to them according to the custom of AVinchester, and that pleas should be held in Newcastle concerning debts and recognizances lent and made there. The king farther granted, for the improvement of the town, that all the burgesses should be exempt from the payment of yeresgyne (bribes for connivance) and seotale (officers giving people ale to drink, and then collecting money for not vexing or informing against them for the crimes they had committed or might commit) \u2014 that no sheriff or bailiff should make any seotale in that place \u2014 that those customs which had been unjustly levied in the time of war, should be altogether annulled \u2014 that every person from whatever place, whether fo reigners or others, that resorted to Newcastle upon Tyne with merchandise, should be permitted to stay there and depart from thence in the king's peace, after payment of such established customs as had become due. \u2014 Mackenzie's Hist, of Newcastle, p. 602. t In the reign of King John, Marmaduke de Tueng and Margaret his wife bequeathed a house and some land at Hartlepool, for the purpose of purchasing smocks for the nuns of Newcastle. Similar gifts were not uncommon ; and such lands were generally called smokeacres. X The justices of Sadberge ordered a memorial to be made out of the first wreck which fell to the bishop after this transaction ; and accordingly a wooden cross was soon after erected in a place called Blakelawe, near Sadberge, by the side of the high road leading to Hartlepool. The cross, which was standing nearly a century afterwards, was formed out of the mast of a wrecked vessel ; and from its yard was made a candlei stick, appropriated to the use ofthe church of Sadberge. \u2014 Sharp's Hartlepool, p. 21."], [607, "HARTLEPOOL. 461 heiress of Adam, late Earl of Carrick,* and died in 1304. In 1306, his son, Robert, asserted his claim to the crown of Scotland ; on which he was immediately declared a traitor and a rebel by King Edward ; and his manor of Hart, the borough of Hartrepol, and all his other property in the bishopric of Durham, were granted to Robert de Clifford and his heirs for ever, saving the rights of the church of St. Cuthbert. In 1312, the Scots, under Sir James Douglas, penetrated to Hartlepool, carrying off much spoil, and many prisoners of both sexes ; and, two years afterwards, they again ravaged all the country on the banks of Tees, cruelly plundering and destroying the villages. The affrighted inhabitants of Hartlepool got on board their ships, with such effects as they could remove, and put out to sea for safety.-f- Robert de Clifford, lord of Hart, was slain at the battle of Bannockburn, and was succeeded by his son, Roger, who joined the rebellion of Thomas Earl of Lancaster, and was taken prisoner at Boroughbridge in 1321. His forfeited estates were granted to John Earl of Richmond ; but they were restored to his brother, Robert de Clifford, in 1327, by whom they were held under Bishop Beaumont. In the mean while, Hartlepool had been fast rising in wealth and importance; and, during the wars between the English and Scottish monarchs, ships and armed men were often pro vided here for the service of the former. Robert de Clifford died in the 18th year of Edward III., leaving his son, Robert, a minor, who afterwards served at the battle of Cressy ; on which event, Hartlepool was one of the towns honoured by a letter from the sovereign on the occasion.

He is described as being at this time \"an illustrious knight, and a most beautiful young man.\" The lady gave him the salutations and embraces \"usual in courts,\" and requested him to partake of her diversions. \" When he betrayed a reluctance to her proposal, she forcibly drew his reins back with her own hands, and led the knight against his will\" to her castle of Turnbery, where she kt-pt him in gentle durance for \" fifteen days and more.\" They were shortly afterwards married, without either the knowledge of their mutual friends and relatives, or, what was still more requisite, the previous consent of her guardian the king, who immediately seized her estates; but, by a fine and the interposition of her friends, her feudal delinquency was pardoned, and Ro bert Bruce, by the courtesy of Scotland, became Earl of Carrick. t The disasters experienced by the English in these wars appear to have been enhanced by a season of severe scarcity, which rendered the exertion of the royal authority necessary, to regulate the prices of provi sions- In \"A Summarie of English Chronicles,\" pages 141 and 142, are the following passages: \u2014 \"1314- \u2014 The king caused his writtes to be published for victuals that no oxe stalled or corn fed, be solde for more than 24. shillinges, no grass fedde oxe for more than 16. shillinges, a fat stalled cow at twelue shil linges, another cow at x. shillinges, a fatte mutton corne fed, or whose wool is well growne at twentie pence, another fat mutton shorne at foureteene pence, a fatte hogge of two yeare old, at three shillinges foure pence, a fatte goose at two pence half penie, in the citty at three pence, a fatte capon at two pence, in the cittie at two pence halfepeny, a satt henne at one peny, in the citty one peny halfe peny, two chickens a peny, in the citty one peny halfe penie, foure pigeons for one peny, in the cittie three pigeons for one peny, twenty foure egges a peny, in the citty twenty egges a peny, &c.\" \" 1315. \u2014 The dearth increased through aboundance of raine that fell in haruest, so that a quarter of wheate or salte was solde for xl. shillinges.

On the death of Robert de Clifford, about 1362, he was succeeded by his brother, Roger Lord Clifford, who died in the 13th year of Richard II. , seized of the manors of Hert and Hertilpole, with the towns of Elwick, Stranton, and Brerton. Thomas Lord Clifford, his son, who died two years afterwards, was succeeded by John Lord Clifford, then an infant. In the year 1406, King Henry IV. wrote to Hartlepool and other ports respecting the guard of the seas, towards which it was intended those places should contribute. John Lord Clifford was slain at the siege of Meaux in France, in the 9th of Henry Ar. ; and his son, Thomas Lord Clifford, lost his life in the battle of St. Alban's, fighting for Henry AT.

Concerning whom (after that fatal day at Towton, where his father was slain) there being strict enquiry made by the then prevailing party, and their sorrowful mother examined about them ; she said, that she had given direction to convey them beyond sea, to be bred up there ; and that be ing thither sent, she was ignorant whether they were living or not, part of vvhich answer was true: for she had really sent the younger of them into the Netherlands, who died there not long after : but the elder, (viz. Henry) she placed at Lonsborow in Yorkshire (where she her self then lived) with a shepheard who had married one of her inferior servants (an attendant on his nurse) where, though he was brought up in no bet ter a condition than the shepheards own children ; yet as he grew to discretion, he chearfully submitted thereto as the only expedient for preservation of his life ; supporting himself vvith hopes of better dayes in time. \" But no sooner did the death of his grandfather the Lord Aresci happen, (viz. about 8 Edw. 4.) then that rumours were brought to the court, that the young Lord Clifford was alive.

AVhile the main body of the rebels moved south- ward, a part of them, with some judgment, occupied this town. They were not, however, prudent enough to pursue the plan which the fears both of Cecil and of Sadler suggested, viz. \" to kepe that towne for their refuge, and to seke their escape by sea, or ells be in hope to receyve there some foreygn ayde.\" It seems that before the 24th of December, Hartlepool was recovered and garrisoned for the queen with 300 men, under Sir H.

Having passed through the subordinate ranks of his profession with honour, he was appointed first lieutenant of the Namur; and on the 1st of August, 1738, when a war was threatened vvith Spain, he was promoted to the rank of post captain, and received the command of the Aldborough frigate, in which ship he immediately sailed to the Mediterranean, to join the squadron under Rear-admiral Haddock. In 1739, he had the good fortune to make many rich captures. In 1744, he was captain of the Sutherland, of 50 guns ; and, early in the ensuing spring, was ordered to proceed to the East Indies, with four of the Company's ships under bis protection. On his return from this station, he was ordered to the West Indies, where, on the death of Commodore Legge, Septemper 19, 1747, he succeeded to the chief command on the Barbadoes station, and towards the latter end of 1748, greatly distinguished himself by his activity and the judgment with vvhich he stationed his cruisers, for the purpose of intercepting the French convoy from Europe, by means of which, nearly 40 of the enemy's vessels were captured by himself or the cruisers under his orders. In 1754, he was appointed to the Cumberland, of 66 guns, in which ship he sailed to the East Indies, making part of a small squadron under the command of Rear-admiral Watson. The first operation of the fleet was against the for- tress of Geriah, the residence of the famous pirate Angria, which, after an obstinate resistance, was reduced. On February 4, 1755, stir.

He assisted at the recovery of Calcutta from the Nabob Surajah Dowlah, and afterwards served at the reduction of Chandernagore, the principal French set- tlement in the province of Bengal, and a place of great strength. - On the death of Admiral VATatson at Calcutta, August 16, 1757, Admiral Pocock succeeded to the com- mand in chief of his majesty's ships in the East Indies; and on January 31, 1758, he was farther promoted to be vice-admiral of the red. On April 29, he discovered the French fleet under the command of the Count D'Ache, which he immediately attacked; but, after a dreadful action, the French made sail and escaped to Pondicherry. After refitting his ships, the British admiral went in pursuit ofthe enemy, whom he chased on the 27th of July, and, on the 3d of August, had the good fortune to bring them to an action. The French, however, again fled to Pondicherry road, and from thenoe, having repaired their damages, to the Mauritius; and Admiral Pocock repaired to Bombay, where he remained during the monsoons. In the ensuing year, the British admiral, with his fleet, was again on the seas. On September 2, he chased the French fleet, vvhich he followed to Pondicherry. \"I arrived there,\" says he, \"on the 8th, early in the morning, and saw no ship in the road; but at one in the afternoon, we discovered the enemy to the south-east, and, by three, counted 13 sail. AVe were then standing to the southward, with the sea-breeze, and to prevent their passing us, kept a good look-out the following day. At two in the afternoon of the 9th, the wind springing up, I made the signal for a general chase ; and at four, their squadron appeared to be formed in a line of battle abreast, steering right down upon us. In the evening, I ordered the Revenge to keep, during the night, between our squadron and the enemy's, to observe their motions. On the 10th, at six in the morning, the body of the French squadron bore south-east-by-south, distant eight or nine miles, and was formed in a line of battle ahead, on the starboard tack. AVe continued bearing down on them in a line of battle abreast, with the wind about north-west-by-vvest. At five minutes past ten, the enemy wore, and formed the line ahead upon the larboard tack. At five minutes after eleven, we did the same, and kept edging down upon them. At ten minutes past two in the afternoon, the Yarmouth (Admiral Pocock's ship) being nearly abreast ot the French admiral's second in the rear, and within musket-shot, sti. D'Ache made the signal for battle. I immediately did the same; on which both squadrons began to cannonade each other with great fury, and continued hotly engaged until ten minutes after four, when the enemy's rear began to give way, the Sunderland having got up some time before, and engaged their sternmost ship : their centre very soon after did the same. Their van made sail, stood on, and, with their whole squadron, bore away, tind steered to the south-south-east with aU the sail they could ma,ke.

Middlesex, they were recently purchased by the Marquis of Cleveland, the present proprietor. From the time that the county of Sadberge was purchased by Bishop Pudsey, Hartlepool was considered as almost exclusively appropriated to the trade and warlike preparations carried on by the see. From hence, says Hutchinson, \" the prelates sent forth their fleets, and here they im- them, the Tyger having her mizen-mast and main-top-mast shot away, and appearing to be greatly disabled. The Newcastle was much damaged in her masts, yards, and rigging; and the Cumberland and Salisbury, in our rear, were not in a condition to make sail. The Yarmouth had her fore-top-sail yard shot away in the slings ; and the Grafton and Elizabeth, though none of their masts and yards fell, were greatly disabled in them and their rigging ; so that the AVeymouth and Sunderland were the only ships that had not suffered, because they could not get properly into action, occasioned by M. D'Ache's beginning to engage before they could close, so that by those means they were thrown out of the engagement ; seven of our ships, only, sus taining the whole fire of the enemy's fleet till near the conclusion, and then no more than eight.\" After some repairs, Admiral Pocock again repaired to Pondicherry road, where the French squadron was lying at anchor in a line of battle. It not being thought prudent to attack both the ships and the fort at the same time, he lay to in the offing, keeping his line of battle formed. The French squadron, consisting of eleven sail of the line and two frigates, at length sailed out ; but, instead of engaging, M. D'Ache made the signal for his ships to make sail to the southward ; by which they increased their distance from the British fleet from about a random shot at day-light to near four leagues to windward at sunset. As it was the opi nion of the rear-admiral and captains that the condition of the squadron was not such as to warrant follow ing them to the southward, Admiral Pocock proceeded to Madras, and anchored there on the 28th September. In the following year, he returned to England, leaving the command in the Indian seas with Rear-admiral Stevens. In 1761, Admiral Pocock was honoured with the Order of the Bath, as a reward for his important services in India; and the East India Company placed his statue in marble in their hall. In the same year, he was promoted to be admiral of the blue, but received no appointment till the month of January, 1762, when he hoisted his flag on board the Namur, of 90 guns, and shortly afterwards sailed on the memorable expedition against the Havannah, the capital of Cuba, in the West Indies ; one of the most daring and best-conducted enterprizes that was ever undertaken by any nation. On his arrival in the West Indies, he took upon him the command in chief of his majesty's ships in that quarter, which composed a formidable fleet, consisting of 26 ships of the line, 15 frigates, and a considerable number of sloops of war and bombs, making altogether a fleet of more than 50 vessels of war. After a very fortunate passage through the old Straits of Bahama, a navigation of considerable difficulty, this armament arrived off the Havannah on June 6, 1762. The land forces, under the command of the Earl of Albemarle, brother to Admiral Keppel, amounting to upwards of 10,000 men, were landed the next day ; and the joint operations of the army and navy were pushed with vigour, and were completely successful ; the Moro fort being taken by storm, after a siege of 29 days, during which time the enemy lost above 1000 men. About a fortnight afterwards, the governor desired to capitu late for the town, which was granted. \" AVith this great and important acquisition,\" says Sir George, \" have also fallen twelve large men of war of the line, three of vvhich were sunk, with a company's ship, in the entrance of the harbour ; nine are fit for sea, and two upon the stocks.\" The most perfect harmony prevailed between the fleet and army during the whole of the operations ; and without violating the articles of capitulation, which secured to the inhabitants their private property, the conquerors found a booty com puted at near three millions sterling, in silver and valuable merchandise, belonging to the king of Spain, besides an immense quantity of arms, artillery, and military stores. Sir George Pocock, on his return home, received the thanks of both houses of parliament, of the city of London, and other public bodies, for his distinguished services, but never accepted of any subsequent com mand, and, in the year 1766, totally retired to private life. It is supposed that he took offence at the ap pointment of Sir Charles Saunders, a junior admiral, to the high situation of the first Lord of the Admiralty, to which he thought himself and other admirals had preferable claims, and immediately afterwards resigned his rank as admiral of the blue. During the remainder of his life, he continued in honourable retirement, and died at his house in Curzon Street, May Fair, April 3, 1792, at the advanced age of 87- His remains were interred in the family vault at Twickenham, near those of his lady. In private life, a more amiable and exalted character never existed ; and as an officer, few men will stand higher in the annals of the Bri tish navy. \u2014 Campbell's Naval History of Great Britain, vol. v. p. 123 et seq."], [613, "HARTLEPOOL. 467 ported their merchandise and landed their auxiliary forces.

He also appointed an officer of customs at the port to take the butlerage of wines and ulnage of cloths imported ; and Bishop Skirlaw also granted letters patent for the receipt of certain customs there. Bishop Fordham granted his charter to the burgesses to receive tolls within the borough for the maintenance of the walls and haven, and for other public uses; and Bishop Langley and other succeeding prelates renewed or enlarged the same.

He settled at Hartlepool, and, on August 27, 1683, was admitted a burgess. In 1741, there was an advance in the price of wheat from 6s. to 15s. per boll ; on which occasion the people rose, and a formidable mob appeared in Hartlepool. Mr. AVil liam Romaine went out to meet them, asked them their wants, and was answered that they wanted corn cheaper. He put an immediate and an effectual stop to these riotous proceedings, first by promising to sell all the corn that he had at 5s. a bushel, and then by performing his promise; for he sold to all that came, while the other merchants refused to sell any. The Rev. William Romaine, A. M., second son to the gentleman last mentioned, was born at Hartlepool, September 25, 1714, educated at Houghton-le-Spring, and afterwards sent to Oxford, where he was first entered at Hertford CoUege, and thence removed to Christ Church. On entering into holy orders, he be came a frequent preacher before the university, and was noted for his zeal in behalf of what were deemed the orthodox doctrines. He removed to London in 1749, and became lecturer at St. Dunstan's church, Fleet Street. He was, for a short time, morning preacher at St. George's, Hanover Square, and professor of astronomy at Gresham College, which situation he soon resigned. In 1764, he was chosen rector of St. Anne's, Blackfriars; where, and at St. Dunstan's, he continued to preach to large and very crowded con gregations almost to his death. Towards the close of life, his voice was feeble, but his manner was very impressive ; and he was still a very ftloquent preacher on the Calvinistical scheme of divinity.

This officer is in the annual commission of the peace for the county, in which Hartlepool is the only royal borough. It is to be regretted, however, that this town is but the occasional residence of a part of its magis trates ; in consequence of which, petty sessions are now seldom or never held here, and offenders have frequently to be removed as far as Stockton for examination. The revenue of the corpora tion, which is derived from the tolls and harbour-dues, has not, for some years past, exceeded the sum of \u00a322 per annum ; which, however, would be sufficient to defray the incidental expenses of the town, were not the mayor unfortunately burthened with an annuity of \u00a324, incurred in an improvident contest with the lord of the manor.* As the salaries of the police are also paid by of Moses from the omission of a future state, is proved to be absurd, and destructive of all religion.\" He was also editor of Calasio's Concordance to the Hebrew Bible, 4 vols folio, in 1749 ; in which, it is said, he made some unwarrantable alterations to serve the Hutchinsonian doctrine. He died July 26. 1795, aged 81. His works were published in 8 vols. by W. B. Cadogan. \u2014 Rees' Encyc. ; <$\u2022 Sharp's Hartlepool, p. 77* * An action having been commenced against G.

In the 9th year of Queen Elizabeth, a court leet was held at Hartlepool, for Sir Ingram Clifford, Knt., second son of the first Earl of Cumberland. A court leet and court baron are held here twice a year by the recorder, who is the steward of the borough, or by his deputy. The former takes cognizance of all debts under 40s., and is of great advantage to the inhabitants, who are so far removed from the more expensive courts at Durham. The grand jury presents all offences contrary to good order, and to the statutes and ordinances of the corporation. The following is a list of the recorders of Hartlepool : \u2014 Matthew Dodsworth, 1605\u2014 Edward Wright, 1640\u2014 John Turner, 1647\u2014 John Swinburne, 1667\u2014 William Davison, 1669. \u2014 John Middleton, 1696. \u2014 John Fawcett, 1702. \u2014 Christopher Fawcett, 1741 David Hilton, 1747\u2014 Ralph Hopper, 1758.\u2014 Robert Hopper,* 1781.\u2014 AVilliam Walton, 1795. The franchise of Hartlepool may be obtained by gift, composition, patrimony, or servitude. j The common burgesses have the privilege to stint one horse and one cow on the town pasture ; but they have no right to the soil, which is vested in the mayor and capital burgesses. Common burgesses are also exempted from the payment of tolls to the mayor. The three town seals are of great antiquity. The two larger, which are supposed to have formed the obverse and reverse of the same seal, seem to have been made on the incorporation of Hartle pool by King John in 1200. In the centre of the first stands St. Hilda, with a monk on each side, celebrating mass, and having the following inscription round the margin : \u2014 \" subveniat famvlis nobilis hilda svis.\" The second contains a rebus upon the name of Hartlepool, a hart at bay in a pool, with the inscription, \"sigillvm commvnitatis de herterpol.\" The third seal is smaller than the other two, and represents St. Hilda, supported by two bishops, and standing on a prostrate shores between the high and low water marks, in all and every part of the township of Hartlepool, subject, however, to restraints and regulations ; that George Pocock, &c. shall not work, win, nor lead away any stones from any part of the sea shore within the slake or bay at Hartlepool, beginning from the most west erly point of the boundary line, viz. from the most westerly point of the fine of the wall, called the white or north wall, where such line meets the tide, and extending thence to the pier of the harbour of Hartlepool ; that Georae Pocock, &c shall not take away any stones either from the upright rocks or cliffs vvhich protect the fields and land of the township of Hartlepool from the sea, and divide the fields and land from the sea shore, or from any part of the rocks or shore within twenty yards from the upright cliffs or rocks, though the same should be between the high and low water marks ; the distance of twenty yards to be measured from the bottom of the upright cliffs or rocks ; that all wrecks of the sea cast on the shore in any part of the manor of Hart, including the township of Hartlepool, belong to G.

This town, as already stated, stands upon a peninsula, which, at high water, makes the figure of a crescent, bending towards the south and south-west. The narrow isthmus by which it is con nected with the main land is low, and composed almost entirely of sand-hills; a circumstance which renders Hutchinson's supposition, that the scite of the town was once insulated at high water, exceedingly probable. From hence the ground gradually rises till it forms a bold promon tory of perpendicular rocks towards the ocean. The town stands on the south side of this penin sula, and consists of a principal street, called Southgate Street, a back street, and several cross streets, all sloping upwards towards the church and Town Moor. Southgate Street contains seve ral good houses and shops ; and on the south side of it stands the Town House, a stone building, erected in 1750. The court-room is about 50 feet long by 22j broad, and is 15 feet high ; and the lower storv is. adapted for a prison. The market-cross formerly stood in front of this edifice, and consisted of a square flight of steps, terminated by a rude cross of stone. Being found incon venient, it was removed ; and piazzas, abutting from the Town House, w:ere erected for the mar ket ; but these have also been recently taken down. There are some pleasant houses on the terrace formed by the town wall, fronting south-west towards the harbour, one of which belongs to the Earl of Darlington. George Allan, Esq., barrister, of Grange Hall, has a residence here ; as has Sir Cuthbert Sharp, F. S. A. Moor House, lately the seat of Lieutenant-general Seddon, is now the residence of Cuthbert Sharp, Esq. It stands on the Moor, or Common Pasture, and commands a peculiarly grand and interesting view, embracing a vast extent of the ocean, together with the vale of Cleveland, the high lands of Yorkshire, surmounted by Roseberry Topping, the mouth of the Tees, and the villages of Redcar, Coatham, and Seaton-Carew. Hartlepool contains a respectable inn, and about a dozen public houses and taverns ; besides shopkeepers, grocers, drapers, tailors, boot and shoe-makers, dress-makers, surgeons, druggists, fish-mongers and curers, masons, joiners, blacksmiths, boat-builders, butchers, a circulating li brary, &c. A market is held here every Saturday by prescription ; but, according to the charter, it should be held on AA'ednesday. Fairs should also be held here on May 14, August 21, October 9, and November 27 ; but they are in such a languid state that the fair days are scarcely ever observed. This town is much resorted to in summer as a bathing-place ; and there are many good lodging houses for the accommodation of visitors. There is a chalybeate spring near the Water Gate, which is covered by the sea at high tide. It rises, very slowly, discovers a little sulphur, and a gallon of it yields 120 grains of sediment, of which two parts are nitre, and the rest limestone. I. has been recommended as useful in scorbutic complaints, gravel, hypochondria, &c. ; but it has lost much of its former importance. There is another spring, somewhat resembling the Harrogate waters, on the shore below the south battery. The promenade around the Town Moor is the favourite resort of strangers. Here is a prospect of an immense expanse of ocean, extending from AVhitby on the south to Suter Point on the north ; while, on the land side, the eye wanders over a rich succession of corn and meadow fields, rising to a considerable distance. On the eastern extremity of the Moor is a smaU dismantled battery, on the very edge of the cliff'. Beneath, the rocks are broken and worn by the sea intu"], [621, "HARTLEPOOL. 473 the most grotesque and romantic forms ; and at a short distance is a detached mass, surrounded by the tide, and scooped into curious and fanciful arches. The yawning space which separates this rock from the main land is called the \" Maiden Bower.\"* Further to the north is a subterra neous passage, hitherto unexplored, known by the appellation of the \" Gun Cove.\" The \" Fairy Coves\" are small cells hewn in the rock, connected with each other, about five feet in diameter, and twelve feet above the shore ; probably intended as places of concealment in times of danger. The Church. It is probable that when Robert de Brus granted the churches of Hart and Stranton to Guis borough priory, the dependant chapel of St. Hilda at Hartlepool would form a part of the grant. It is named in the confirmation charters of Bishop Pudsey in 1195, of the fifth Robert de Brus, of Bishop Kirkham in 1259, of Bishop Stichell in 1273, and of Bishop Kellaw in 1311. Previous to the last mentioned confirmation, Bishop Anthony Bek, in 1288, in consequence of the burthens which William de Middlesburg, prior, and the convent of Guisborough, are oppressed, from their great expenditure in charities, &c. granted to them the vicarage of Hart, with the customary ob ventions and appurtenances, during the life of the said AVilliam, which they might convert to their use and relief, so that the vicarage were duly served by two virtuous and discreet canons, who were to practise hospitality to the poor as far as they were able. In 1308, the same prelate (then patriarch of Jerusalem), as a mark of his especial favour, in consequence of the religious devotion, the continual observance of hospitality, &c. of the prior and convent of Guisborough, granted them the indulgence that in the church of Hart and chapel of Hartlepool, where the cure of souls had previously been exercised by a secular vicar, divine service should, after that time, be perpetually performed by a canon of Guisborough, &c In 1599, the statutes for the government of the church appear in the corporation records. In 1600, the number of \" pues or stalls\" was 33, including the stalls of the \" vicarr and dark,\" and the \" stall or pue for the maior and brethren.\" On February 5, 1719, a brief was granted by King George I. to collect the sum of \u00a3'1732 and upwards, for repairing and rebuilding the church, the choir of which was \" almost entirely unroofed, and the steeple, pillars, and walls of the same, so much decayed by length of time, that the whole fabrick will inevitably fall to the ground, un less speedily prevented by taking down and rebuilding some, and repairing the decayed parts thereof.\" On September 22, 1721, it was agreed that the church and chancel should be continued at its full length and breadth ; that the roof should be flattened to four or six feet pitch ; that the north wall, if advisable, should be taken down and rebuilt ; \" but in fear of yc cash arising from ye brief may not answer ye expectation, ye said wall shall be referred until ye last, y' ye sd church shall be new flagged, pued, and whitened, and in respect to ye glory of ye antiquity of sd church, what repairs ye windows may want, they shall be wrought after ye same model as they now are ; and as for ye chancel, yt is referred until ye Earle of Scarborough's consent is got * This place probably derived its name from a supposition that it was the haunt of one of those pre ternatural daughters of the sea \u2014 a mermaid. It has since received a more horrible confirmation of its title from the fact of an unfortunate girl having been thrown over the cliff here by her inhuman lover ; an inci dent related at large in a legendary ballad called \" The Hartlepool Tragedy,\" and more briefly in the Parish Register as follows: \u2014 \"Mary Farding, a stranger, who, by the coroner's inquest, was found to be murdered by WUliam Stephenson, merchant in NorthaUerton, to whom she was pregnant, was buried June 7> 1727\" vol. i.\u2014 24. 6 E"], [622, "474 STOCKTON WARD\u2014 N. E. D. in writing ; and yt ye steeple both in and outside be repaired.\" May 22, 1724, Bishop Talbot granted his permission for the above repairs ; and the chancel, then 23i yards long, was ordered to be rebuilt five yards within the walls. It is supposed that the gallery at the west end was* erected at the same period. This church, as before observed, stands on elevated ground, and, from the projection of its scite into the sea, forms a conspicuous object on the coast. The magnitude of the building, and the original beauty of its architecture, are incontrovertible proofs, if such were wanting, of the ancient grandeur and population of Hartlepool. The tower, which is square, appears to have been built about the conclusion of the 13th century ; and although the traces of many alterations are appa rent, enough still remains to prove the pristine splendour of its architecture. It is supported on the west and north by huge flying buttresses ; from whence it may be inferred that it has, at some time, shrunk and been in danger of faUing. In the belfry are three cracked bells, \" whose tones are truly discordant and melancholy.\" The summit of the tower is ornamented by battlements, with crocketted pinnacles at the corners. The west, or main entrance to the church, is now closed up ; and the south entrance is through a porch on that side of the tower. Within this porch is a Saxon or Norman circular arch, with chevron mouldings, of great beauty. The nave is 85 feet long, and, including the side-aisles, 44 feet wide. It is supported by five light and clustered pillars on each side, with pointed arches, \"beautiful and well proportioned.\" Each of the upper windows has formerly been under three pointed arches, now built up into one light; but the ornamented capitals still remain, and the ar chitecture of this part of the building corresponds with that of the tower. The side-aisles have been rebuilt at a much later period, and are lamentably inferior in beauty, little regard having been paid to \" the glory of the antiquity.\" The chancel, now reduced to little more than a recess for the altar, has been divided from the nave by a lofty pointed arch, springing from a cluster of pilasters. The east window, under a semicircular arch, is partly built up at the bottom. The church is regularly stalled with oak. The font is an elegant bason of Yorkshire marble, \" the gift of George Bowes, Esq., 1728.\" The communion plate consists of one large pewter flaggon, a silver chalice, and a silver paten ; the latter \" the gift of Mr. CaUb Readshaw, of Richmond, January 13, 1726.\" Chantries. \u2014 There were several chantries founded in Hartlepool church. Bishop Skirlaw, April 3, in the 8th year of his pontificate, granted licence to the mayor and commonalty of the town of Hartlepool, to found anew, to the honour of St. Helen, a chantry of one chaplain, to pray for the good estate of the bishop whilst alive, of Matilda, or Maud, wife of Roger de Clifford, and their heirs, and of the mayor and commonalty and their successors, &c. ; the chaplain and his successors to be subject to the rules and orders of the mayors, &c. He also permitted the mayor and com monalty to grant three messuages, with their appurtenances in Hartlepool, which Geffrey de El tham and Isabel his wife then had for life, to Robert Rosson, chaplain, keeper of the said chantry ; also to give seven messuages, 40-j acres and 10 roods of arable land, one acre of meadow, 10 tofts and crofts, and 14s. annual rent, with the appurtenances in Hartlepool and Neleston, which were then held of the same Matilda de CUfford, to the said Robert and his successors, chaplains, keepers of the above-mentioned chantry. Richard Gregg, the last incumbent, had a pension of =\u00a34 a year allowed him on the dissolution, which he received in 1553. Bishop Skirlaw granted his licence, of the like date, to the mayor and commonalty of Hartlepool, to resound, to the honour of the Blessed Virgin, a chantry of two chaplains, to pray at the altar of"], [623, "HARTLEPOOL. 475 St. Mary, in the chapel of St. Hilda, for the same personages ; and that the mayor, &c. should give a messuage, with its appurtenances, which Isabel de Shildon then held for life, and another mes suage which Thomas del Kyrke held for life, to Thomas del Kyrke and Thomas de Thornton, chaplains, keepers of the aforesaid chantry ; and that the said mayor, &c. might give 30 messuages, 27 tofts and crofts, 2\u00a7 roods of land, 84s. 6d. rent, with their appurtenances, in Hartlepool, which were held of the same Matilda de Clifford, for the increase of the salaries for ever.* At the disso lution, this chantry was valued at _-?7, 13s. 4d. ; and John Holmes, the last incumbent, received a pension of \u00a3?5 per annum. Bishop Skirlaw also granted licence, of the like date, to resound, to the honour of St. Nicholas, a third chantry of one chaplain, to pray at the altar of St. Nicholas in this chapel ; and that the mayor, &c. should bestow eight messuages, with their appurtenances, in Hartlepool, which were held of the same Matilda de Clifford, to John Abel, chaplain, keeper of the said chantry, and his successors for ever, for their better maintenance. Monuments. \u2014 In the chancel, upon a large black slab, inlaid with a brass plate, bearing the full effigies of a comely woman in a high-crowned hat, ruff, long waist and stomacher, close gown with long sleeves and flowered petticoat, \" casta fides victrix\" proceeding from her mouth : \u2014 \" Here vnder this stone lyeth buryed the bodie of the vertvovs gentellwoman Jane BeU who dep'ted this lyfe the vi daye of Janvarie 1 593, being the dowghter of Laverance Thornell of Darlington gent, and late wyfe to Parsavel Bell nowe maire of this towen of Hartinpooell marchant AVhos vertues if thou wilt beholde Peruse this tabel hanging bye Which will the same to the unfolde By her good lyfe learne thou to die \u00c6tatis su\u00e6 40.\" Two effigies in stone, which in Hutchinson's time were in the church-yard, are now placed against the north wall of the chancel. They are much defaced. \" The more perfect figure,\" says Sir C. Sharp, \" is habited in ecclesiastical vestments, holding in one hand a glove, and in the other a scroll, with the illegible remains of an inscription : an angel appears supporting a pillow on which his head rests, and a dog is placed sleeping at his feet. The other is meant apparently to represent a female, whose hands are joined together on the breast in an attitude of prayer.\" On a funeral escutcheon of the arms of Blackett, above the gallery : \u2014 \"Sir William Blackett, baronet, burges, alderman, and sometimes maior of Newcastle upon Tyne, dep'ted this life the 16th day of May, 1680. By his last wiU did bequeath to the poor of the parish of St. Gyles (Hilda?) in Hartinpoole, forty shiUings yearly for ever.\" The church-yard is spacious, and extends towards the Town Moor. Hutchinson says that the large table monument of blue marble, with the arms of Brus, but without inscription, which now lies under the east window, stood formerly in the middle of the old chancel. At a short distance are the remains of two figures, similar to those already described in the church, wanting, however, the scroU and the dog. Enclosed with an iron railing are the remains of Robert Rolland, Esq., of Arbroath, in Scotland, who was supposed to have fallen from a cliff there May 20, 1811, and was found floating near Hartlepool on the 2d July following. * Permission was likewise given to the mayor and commonalty to give seven messuages in Hartlepool, held of Matilda de Clifford, to Walter Bakster and WiUiam Howe, keepers of the fabric of the church of St. Hilda, for the purpose of supplying a Ught at the altar of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and for sustaining the choir of the same church."], [624, "476 STOCKTON WARD\u2014 N.

Several stone coffins have been found in various parts of the church-yard. In digging a grave (March, 1790), a stone coffin was discovered, containing the body of a man, which appeared to be quite entire.

In 1723, Lord Crewe's trustees endowed it with \u00a3\"10 per annum, agreeably to his will. In 1724, the governors of Queen Anne's Bounty gave \u00a3'200, and the vicar of Hart and others contributed a similar amount, which sums were expended, in 1727, in the purchase of lands at Bishop-Middleham. In 1812, \u00a3800 was given from the parliamentary grants; and, in 1814, an additional augmentation of \u00a31000, consist ing of \u00a3?200 from the bishop of Durham, \u00a3?200 from Lord Crewe's trustees, and \u00a3J600 from Queen Anne's Bounty. These successive grants and donations, together with the surplice fees, belong of distinct right to the perpetual curacy ; and the vicarial tithes of the township have also been re ceived by the incumbents for some years past.

Smith's Charity. \u2014 Henry Smith, or Smyth, (mentioned page 92) in 1626-7 bequeathed all his property for the purchase of estates, the rents of which were to be appropriated for the relief of aged poor or infirm people, married persons, having more children born in lawful wedlock than their labours should be able to maintain, poor orphans, such poor people as should keep themselves and families to labour, and should put forth their children apprentices at the age of 15 ; and that such course should be taken as that a stock should be provided and always in readiness to set such of the said persons to work as should be able to labour and take pains, and not to or for the relief of any persons who should be given to excessive drinking, whore- mongers, common swearers, pilferers, or otherwise notoriously scandalous, or to any persons that should have been incorrigible, or disobedient to those whose servants they should have been, or to any vagrant persons, or such as should have no constant dwelling, or should receive any inmate or inmates to dwell in the house with them, or should not have inhabited in that parish by the space of five years next before such distribution should be made, or being able should refuse to work, labour, and take pains ; and he further directed that the rents assigned for the relief of the poor should be disposed of in apparel of one colour, with a badge or mark denoting the same to be the gift of the said Henry Smith, or else in bread, and flesh or fish, on each sabbath day, publicly in the parish churches of each parish. In 1641, the trustees had purchased a capital messuage in Hartlepool, and divers other messuages, lands, and tenements, with their appurtenances, in that place, producing \u00a330 per annum. The last general con- veyance to new trustees was in August, 1825. This estate, say the Commissioners for inquiring concerning Charities, \" has for many years been under the management of the corporation of Hartlepool. It consists of a building called the Friarage, part of vvhich is in ruins, and the residue used as a workhouse. There is also a small field held with the workhouse, as a garden, and about 18 acres of land, let in small parcels to seven different tenants, at rents amounting in the whole to \u00a3119, 10s. The lands last mentioned are usually let every three years to the highest bidder. The rents are received by the overseers, and carried to the general account, and disposed of with the money collected by the poor's rate. This mode of applying the rents to the immediate relief of the rated inhabitants of the parish seems directly at variance with the inten- tions of the donor.\" Sir William B/ackclt's Charity. \u2014 Sir William Blackett, by will, March 9, 1679, bequeathed, amongst other charities, the yearly sum of \u00a32 to the poor of Hartlepool, which \" is received from the successors of the late James Hume, and the amount has been improperly carried to the overseers' account.\" School, \u2014 John Crookes, by will, September, 1742, gave to a schoolmaster for teaching 24 boys of Hartle- pool reading, writing, and arithmetic, \u00a315 per annum, and \u00a35 yearly to buy them hooks and stationery, and also shoes and stockings, and charged the said sums on his estate at Stranton. The said devise becoming void, Ann Crookes, sister to the above John Crookes, on November 21, 1755, conveyed her undivided moiety of his estates to seven trustees, to apply three-fourths of the clear rents for teaching such a number of poor boys belonging to Hartlepool, in reading, writing, and arithmetic, and in the Catechism according to the Church of England, and in the principles of the Christian religion, as the said three-fourths would extend to or be sufficient for ; such boys to be nominated and instructed by such person or persons as after the de- cease of the persons therein named the trustees should appoint ; and on further trust to apply the remaining fourth part of the rents in buying books and stationery for the said boys, and afterwards in buying shirts, shoes, and stockings for them, or such of them as the persons before mentioned should appoint ; and on fur- ther trust, that whenever the number of trustees should be reduced by death to three, the survivors should appoint others so as to make up the number to seven, and convey the premises accordingly. The property now held by the trustees consists of a barn with a small garth, and six closes, in the town- ship of Stranton. The quantity of the land is differently stated from 19 to 23 acres. The whole is let for \u00a330 per annum. There is no school-house belonging to the charity, except one built on a parcel of land which was demised by the corporation of Hartlepool, about the year 1790, to the trustees for the term of 40 years, paying a ground-rent of 2s. This school-house is not wanted by the present master, as he has a resi- dence in the town ; and it is therefore let at \u00a34 a year, which is carried to the account of the charity. The above-mentioned rents have been received by Mr. Sedgwick, the acting trustee, from the year 1825, when he received a balance of \u00a32, 2s. 9d. from stir. Richardson, the last schoolmaster, who had kept the accounts previously. The present master was appointed by the trustees in 1825, and he was to receive more or less according to the clear yearly produce ofthe estate; but it was agreed that \u00a38 a year was to be paid to the late master, who was incapacitated by age and infirmity, during his life. He lived about eight months only, and during that time the schoolmaster received \u00a35 a quarter : he has subsequently received \u00a37 a quarter till February, 1828, when stir. Sedgwick paid him \u00a36 only, reserving \u00a31 a quarter to form a fund to \u00ab\u25a0?"], [628, "STOCKTON WARD\u2014 N. E.

The master is required to teach 30 children, boys or girls, of the township of Hartlepool, without any charge, in reading, writing, and accounts ; these children are appointed by the trustees. He has also other scholars who pay, the number whereof varies, according to the season of the year, from 15 to 30. No clothing has been provided out of the one-fourth of the rent, as directed by the trust-deed ; and a very small portion has been applied in stationery or other school requisites.* Henry Hilton's Charity. \u2014 Hartlepool was one of the places nominated in the miscalculated bequest of Henry Hilton, Esq., to receive \u00a324 per annum. This annuity, reduced in 1663 to \u00a316, expired in 1739. A Sunday-school was established in Hartlepool by the Rev. B. Lumley, curate ; and is sup ported principally by the subscriptions of occasional visitors, and by an annual sermon. About 100 children usually attend. Support of the Poor. In 1558, a bill was introduced into the House of Commons, relative to the poor of Hartlepool : it does not appear, however, to have passed into a law. During the commercial prosperity of this town, it seems to have been a practice with the corporation to make gifts to the poor, and thus to supersede the necessity of poor-rates. In 1694, the charge for maintaining the poor, with other incidental expenses, amounted to \u00a317, 16s. ; but in 1815, the amount of the poor-rates had in creased to \u00a3310, Is. 5*jd., notwithstanding the appropriation of the proceeds of Henry Smith's Charity. The number of persons receiving parochial relief is very considerable; and the monthly rate at present (1832) is 8d. in the pound on the rental. Trade, Pilots, fye. Hartlepool possessed ships at a very early period after the Norman Conquest; and, as has been stated, they were frequently employed in the service of the crown during the wars with France and Scotland. The herring fishery was carried on to a considerable extent in the 14th century ; and the vessels employed in it were exempted by King Edward III. from the authority of the officers of exchange established at Dover and other parts of the Channel, to whom all florins, &c. were ordered to be carried. The import trade of Hartlepool, at that time, appears also to have been extensive. By a statute in the 5th of Elizabeth, this town, with Newcastle and Berwick, was permitted the shipment of sheep-skins, wools, &c. for foreign parts ; a trade which that act prohibited in other ports. The exportation of corn was afterwards an important branch of com merce here. In 1680, the custom-house establishment was removed from hence to Stockton, under which place Hartlepool has since continued a dependant port. However, this town seems to have had a considerable share of trade in the latter part of the 17th, and in the early part of the 18th centuries; for in 1718, according to Maitland's History of London, it sent 19 ships tothe metropolis, whilst only two were sent from Sunderland, and 75 from Stockton in the same year. In 1725, 37 vessels cleared from this port, 36 of which were bound for London ; and, according to the custom-house books, the exports were as follow ; \u2014 12,107 qrs. of oats and wheat, 112 firkins of butter, 306 lings, 85 qrs. of pease, beans, & barley, 68 ankers of ale, 239 hams, 35 qrs. of malt, 3 casks of pork, 3 barrels of mustard seed, and 159 pigs of lead, 32$ tons of dried fish, 3 boxes of books. * Another school-house, which is to be endowed by Mr. Christopher Priswick, is now building, a little t<_ the south-east of the church. There are also three day-schools in Hartlepool,"], [629, "HARTLEPOOL. 481 The imports, during the same year, were eight tons of salt, and 179 chaldrons of coals. Since this period, the commerce of Hartlepool has gradually declined ; and instead of the fleets from hence, which formerly covered the German Ocean, and carried on the whole trade of the bishopric, two small vessels are all that now belong to this port, vvhich are generally employed in carrying flour to Sunderland, Shields, &c. The only officers stationed here are a principal coast-officer, and two tide-waiters and boatmen.* Fisheries. \u2014 The grand staple of Hartlepool consists of fish, of which many tons are salted yearly for home consumption and exportation. The demand for fresh fish has been gradually increasing for many years, and large quantities are sent weekly to the towns of Durham, Northumberland, and Yorkshire. A new source of wealth arose a few years ago, from the discovery of a turbot fishery, and Hartlepool supplied the metropolis with turbot equal in flavour and quality to that taken on the Dutch coast, which were always paid for in gold, so that the balance of that branch of commerce was greatly against this country. This trade, however, is now falling off' here. Few places in England are better adapted for a fishery on an extensive scale than Hartlepool ; and it has been suggested that by the substitution of five-men boats instead of the light cobles now in use, considerable advantages would accrue, both with regard to the quantity offish taken, and the security of the men employed. The fish usually caught on this coast are cods, lings, haddocks, whitings, skates, holibuts, soles, herrings, turbots, and occasionally mackerel ; besides crabs and lobsters. From the skill and experience of the fishermen, accidents are extremely rare. It does, however, sometimes happen that these useful men, in their fragile barks, are overtaken by storms, and perish while following their avocation on the bosom of the deep.-f The bait is collected by the * In the night of November 16, 1777, the custom-house at Hartlepool was burnt down. A large seizure of goods had been lodged there the day before, from which there was great reason to believe it had been maliciously set on fire. T The fishermen formerly employed on this coast are thus descrihed in a MS. in the Cotton Library, Julius F. C. sol. 455 : \u2014 \" Truly yt may be sayde of these poor men, that they are lavish of theyr lives, who will hazard 20 or 40 myles into the seas in a small troughe, soe thinne that the gliinse ofthe sunne may be seene through ytt ; yet at 10 or 11 ofthe clocke in the morninge, when they come from sea, they sell theire whole boaty's fadinge for 4s., or if they doe sett a crowne, they suppose to have chaffered fayre. Three commonly come in one boate, each of them havinge twoe oares, which they governe by drawinge the one hande over the other. The boate ytself is built of vvainscott, for shape exceedinge all modeels for shippinge; twoe men will easily carrye ytt on lande betweene them, yett are they so secure in them at sea, that some in a storme have lyved aboarde three d.yes. Their greateste danger is nearest home, where the waves breake dangerouslye ; but they, acquainted with these seas, espieyne a broken wave ready to overtake them, suddenly oppose the prowe or sharpe ende of theyre boate unto yt, and mountinge to the tope, descende downe as yt were unto a valley, hoveringe untill they espye a whole wave come rowlinge, which they ob- serve commonly to be an odde one; whereupon mountinge with their cobble, as yt were upon a greate fu- rious horse, they ro.ve with might and mayne, arid together with that wave drive themselves on lande.\" The cobles now used by the fishermen are about 25 set long and 5 feet in breadth, with a flat bottom and sharp stem, about two tons burthen. Each carries three men : one sits near the stern, and uses a pair of oars ; the others have each an oar Each man has three lines, coiled on an oval flat piece of wicker ; each line is about 200 fathoms long, vvith 400 sno.ils of horse-hair (each 36 inches) at equal distances, vvith well- secured hooks baited vvith mussels, limpets. _and-eels, or worms. The lines are shot across the tide, and are allowed to remain about two hours moored by stones or grapnels. In \" shooting the haavres,\" strong lines of 300 fathoms in length are used, with snoods of 4^ feet, which are shot in 30 fathoms water, and remain for several weeks, being baited as occasion i*.ay require. \" Plaice lines\" are about 200 fathoms long, with 400 snoods ; shot in the evening in from 6 to 14 fathoms water, and hauled next day.

Life-boat. \u2014 Captain Manby, in his Report (1813), expresses his gratification at the admirable appointment and arrangement made for the life-boat at Hartlepool. It is supported by a collec tion made at a sermon annually preached in the church, by subscriptions, and donations. A local committee superintend the management of the funds, of which the Rev. William AVilson is the treasurer; and the immediate command of the boat is confided to the pilot-master. It has been frequently used with the happiest results, and many valuable lives have been preserved by it. The committee judge upon, and grant proportionate rewards for the exertions of the crew. A 5i-inch mortar, with barbed shot, according to Captain Manby's plan, is now attached to the esta blishment of the life-boat. Inhabitants, \" The inhabitants of Hartlepool,\" says Sir C. Sharp, \" consist principally of fishermen, a hardy race, many of whom have not received even the first rudiments of education : their manners are courteous and civil, especially towards strangers : their mode of life and thinking is characterized by stern and unbending independence : few of them have travelled beyond the neighbouring sea ports, and their knowledge of the world is consequently extremely confined, yet their observations frequently betray considerable thought and comprehension. They are nearly all akin,* prone to superstition, and yet supine and indifferent about religion. Their livelihood depends entirely on the temper of the most ' unruly element ;' and though some are careful, yet in general they live, to use a vulgar proverb, ' from hand to mouth,' so that when the weather continues unfavourable for any considerable length of time, they are frequently reduced to pressing necessity. They are in general sober, and their luxuries seldom extend beyond the indulgence of fine white cakes. They marry early, have in general large families, and their wives are universally the purse-bearers.\" From the insulated situation of this town, and the peculiar occupation of the majority of its inha bitants, many ancient rites and customs are here preserved, which are either sinking into disuse or totally forgotten in other places. It is not a little creditable to the inhabitants of Hartlepool, that, notwithstanding a laxity of their police very uncommon in the present \" improving\" age, offences are extremely rare. A corps of volunteers was raised here on the alarm of invasion during the late war, under the command of Charles Spearman, Esq., as lieutenant-colonel. -f- sunk by small stones, remain perpendicular in the water. Crabs and lobsters are taken by a bag-net, fixed to an iron hoop 20 inches in diameter, which, being baited, remains some time under water, generaUy near the rocks, and is then hauled out rapidly. * In 1815, there were living in Hartlepool 96 persons ofthe name of Pounder, 50 Coulsons, 35 Davisons, 33 Harrisons, 31 Hunters, and 27 Horsleys. At that time, the whole population amounted to 1037 persons. + In the year 1677, when the Dutch fleet hovered on the English coast, and even burned the fleet in the Medway, preparations for defence were made in the county of Durham, a descent being feared at the Tees"], [631, "HARTLEPOOL. 483 The Walls. The obvious advantages of the situation of Hartlepool induced Robert de Brus, as already men- tioned, to enclose it with walls and fortifications. Towards the sea it is defended by perpendicular cliffs of from 33 to 40 feet in height, the approach to which is rendered dangerous by spits of rocks running out into the sea. On the land side it was guarded by a wall running across tlie isthmus, and continued through a part of the harbour till it reached the north-western point of the promon- tory on which the town stands. From hence it turned south-east towards the sea, and commanded the entrance to the harbour. These strong bulwarks resemble those of Newcastle upon Tyne, and are therefore referable to the same era, viz. the reign of Edward I. They soon became objects of national importance, and were frequently supported and repaired by grants of murage from the crown. The bishops of Durham, also, often made grants of tolls for their support; and the cor poration records, in more modern times, abound with charges towards their repairs. \"There are few places in this kingdom,\" says Hutchinson, \"give the traveller so perfect an idea of the fortifications of former times as Hartlepool ; a long extended wall, strengthened by demi bastions at intervals, some rounded, others square ; various gates and sallyports, secured by ma chicolations and the portcullis ; some of the gates defended by angular, others square turrets ; all the variety appearing which had grown into use in that age.\" In the present day, the traces of the fortifications towards the sea on the north-east are nearly all obliterated. Fragments of walls, towers, and bastions, are still standing across the isthmus ; and it is probable that here stood the main gate or entrance into the town. At the distance of about 300 yards from the sea, along this line of wall, stands the North Gate, still in good preservation. \" This gate,\" says Hutchinson, or the Wear. (See the letter to the bishop, in the account of Sunderland, page 266.) Sir Gilbert Gerard writes, \" I have been at Hartellpole, wher the five companies \\j>{ train-bands] ar, and I shall consult with the offisers touching the strengthening of the wekest plases, as also what plases ar most requisett for them to kipe ther gardes.\" The following letter to the bishop displays the state of alarm felt at that time : \u2014 \" My lord, \u2014 Upon Tewesday night (that night of thunder and lightning) a post (at his swiftest rate) came to me from the maior of Hartlepoole : the messenger to all the towns he passed through boded much more amazement than the night itself, and of whose news that terrible night seem'd but a bare forerunner ; for his word to all was, Fearful doeings at Hartlepoole. The maior in his letter tells me of an ex- presse he had just then from AVhitby, to be sent to our frigates before Tynemouth. The contents of it were, that two Hollands men-of-warr had the eveninge before attempted the taking two ships out of Whitby road, but were beaten off by some gunns from a platform there ; but that which most moved him, as he said, was a Hollands man-of-war who that verie evening was come within shot of Hartlepoole, and had just then sent his long-boate within Teesmouth as farr as the inner buoy, as they conceived, to plum the harbour, and upon his returne, they fear'd a resolution of that and severall other ships for landing. \" My lord, though for the most part feare lookes through a microscope, and represents things infinitelie greater, yet abandons cautela could be noe waie prejudiciall in matters of this nature, where one single error is irreparable ; I thought it therefore my dutie to repaire thither, both to comfort and encourage the good people, and to let gainsayers see there is not the least failure in care and diligence. I went vvith a resolu- tion to have staid there if need had required, and to have provided as well as I could for the securities both of town and countrie, but when I came there I found only one single man-of-war, and I staid till he went off to sea.

The arch of this gateway is rib'd, and besides double gates, had its portcullis ; the width of the passage is ten feet (11 feet 3 inches*), and of the whole gateway tower about thirty feet (34 feet) : The projection is not much above a foot (16 inches) from the face of the wall: It appears to have had a strong tower for its superstructure, entered at each side from the parapet of the wall. The approach to the town from this gate was by the side of the haven.\" The height of the arch is above 13 feet. The wall on the south-west side of the gate has been cleared away, to render the present road into the town more commodious. The description given by Hutchinson of that part of the fortifications which, continuing in a right line from the North Gate, incloses tbe haven or inner harbour between it and the town, is as follows : \u2014 \" From this gateway the wall which secured the haven begins, and runs in a direct line, the water at high tide coming up to the gate. It is somewhat more than eight feet thick, faced on each side with dressed stones, with a parapet guarded by a breast wall and embrasure, now greatly decayed. There is a water gate in this wall, formed by a low, pointed arch, about twenty-four feet (29 feet 3 inches) in span, and ten feet high, for small craft to pass in and out of the haven without removing the boom chains, afterwards noted : This gateway projects from the face of the wall about eighteen inches (2 feet), has had flood gates, and also a watch tower, as we apprehend, from the remains of the superstructure. From thence at the distance of about seventeen paces, is a square bastion, about eight feet in front (7 feet 4 inches, projection 5 feet 3 inches); and nearly one hundred paces distant is another square bastion (12 feet 3 inches front, projection 7 feet 7 inches) ; and from thence about seventy paces (190 feet 6 inches), is a lofty round tower (324 feet), remaining very perfect, save the parapet and embrasiu-es ; Opposite to it, at the distance of thirty six feet, stood another tower, exactly simUar in dimensions, as the facia and foundations plainly shew, This was the grand entrance into the haven, and by the space between the towers, one may judge ofthe size of those vessels that were moored therein. This entrance was guarded by large boom chains stretched from tower to tower, the remains of the loops belonging to such chains being still visible in the walls of the tower. At ten paces distance are the foundations of a round bastion, near which is a modern gate, where it is presumed formerly was a small door way for the conveni ence of persons landing from boats : At twentyr-four paces distance the wall forms an angle, and turns towards the sea : This angle is defended by a half moon, The entrance into the haven had the peculiar security, that vessels coming from the sea must necessarily double the cape or point of the isthmus, and then proceed along the whole range and stretch of the south wall, within reach of the engines and instruments of war, and pass the half moon which guarded the angle of the wall.\" This account will still convey an accurate idea of the nature of this part of the fortifica tions; though the square bastions and towers have nearly disappeared. The round tower at the entrance of the harbour, partially demolished, has been rebuilt ; and the \" modern gate\" has been taken down to form a landing for the ferry-boats. \" At the distance of sixty paces (166 feet) from the angle,\" continues Hutchinson, \"is a square bastion (8 feet 7 inches in front, projection at one end 9 feet 6 inches, at the other 4 feet 4 inches), * The corrections noted in the dimensions of the various parts of the fortifications were made by Sir C. Sharp."], [633, "HARTLEPOOL. 485 and near it a large breach in the wall ; from the square bastion about one hundred and twenty paces (309 feet) is a large square projection in the wall, most probably modern, about twenty yards long (49 feet), with a sallyport ; and from thence one hundred and twenty paces (355 feet) is a round bastion (13 feet in front) ; and next stands the gateway, now called the AVater Gate (287 feet from the round bastion), and which only communicates with the land at low water, and leads to the high street : The arch of this gateway is pointed, about eight feet in width, and defended on each hand by angular turrets, with the points projecting ; a figure not very commonly met with in old fortifications : From this gate the wall advances to and buts upon the rock near its point, where the pier or mole begins : The whole of this south part appears much more modern than the north and west sides.\" This part of the town wall is about 18 feet high, and from 6 to 9 in thick ness. Its modern appearance may be accounted for by the repairs which have necessarily been bestowed upon it, as it forms the only defence for this part of the town against the inroads of the sea.* The Pier, Harbour, SsC. In 1473, Bishop Booth, by his letters addressed to all abbots, priors, archdeacons, and their officials, deans, commissaries, rectors, vicars, parish priests, and other ecclesiastics ; to all sheriff's, mayors, bailiff's, constables, ministers, and other faithful subjects of the king and the see, informs them that the mayor, burgesses, and commonalty of Hartlepool, by the assistance of God and their charitable gifts, for the benefit and relief of all mariners in distress upou the sea, purpose and in tend to make, construct, and erect a certain pier near the walls, on the south part of the town, for the safeguard of all ships and vessels arriving at the port; and which pier, when it shall be con structed and erected, will make a deep and convenient port to receive all ships of every port town within the realm of England ; and that all ships, vessels, and mariners sailing upon the seas, when strong tempests shall arise, may be protected in the port, and fix their anchors, and then moor and remain ; in which port many ships and vessels have been broken to pieces, and brought to great danger by the tempests, and mariners with their goods have been aforetime lost. He therefore entreats them to contribute to a work of such importance by their charitable donations, &c. In 1588, an act was introduced into the House of Lords for repairing the pier of Hartlepool ; but it does not appear to have been carried into effect. -j- An unsuccessful attempt was also made in parliament for the same purpose in 1665. A small duty on exported grain was laid on in 1719 towards repairing the pier; and, from the inscriptions mentioned by Hutchinson, it would appear that Lord ATane in 1721 ; John Hedworth, Esq., mayor; Henry Lambton, Esq., mayor, in 1729; John Hilton, Esq., in 1731 ; and George Bowes, Esq., mayor, successively subscribed towards its extension and support. * Formidable as these works might be before the invention of cannon, the place would be completely com manded by artillery placed on the sand-hills at the neck of the peninsula. Hartlepool, however, during its occupation by the Scots, was placed by them in a state of regular defence ; and the remains of entrenchments are still very visible on the Moor and Farwell-field, consisting of ditches and slight breastworks, which were supported perhaps by cannon at different points, particularly at the large mound near St. Helen's AVell, and at the eastern extremity of the breastworks on the Moor. t- In the year 1599, a statute of the corporation expresses, \" that whatsoever inhabytante of this town fyndethe nott a suffycyent able man in his or theire watche, or to the pcare, when and as often as they shall be commanded thereunto by the constables or peare masters, shaU pay for every time soe doeinge xiid,\" vol. i. 6 H"], [634, "STOCKTON AVARD\u2014 N. E. D. 486 The dilapidated state of the pier having endangered the town itself for many years, and parlia mentary assistance having been withheld, a subscription was entered into on October 17, 1810, towards rebuilding the pier;* and the first stone of the new work was laid on April 15, 1812, by Carr Ibbetson, Esq., amidst great rejoicings. The subscriptions not being equal to the ex pense required (estimated at .\u00a33500), the committee at length obtained an act of parliament for improving the pier and port of Hartlepool, April 15, 1813, which enacts that every ship or vessel entering into, or using the port, shall pay a sum not exceeding the rate or duty of 2d. per ton; every boat or coble used within the port, and belonging to any fisherman, pilot, or other person or persons residing in Hartlepool, or within the distance of one mile thereof, the yearly sum of 5s. ; and everyr dwelling-house, &c. charged to the poor's rate, of the annual value of <\u00a35, a sum not ex ceeding one-fortieth part of the rental. Still, however, the funds raised from these sources were found inadequate for the completion of the pier, which is built in a straight line from the south of the town, running nearly east and west. It is about 154 yards long, and incloses the harbour. A considerable part of the extremity, on which a capstan is placed, has been completed from the foundation ; but it is only connected vvith the land by the ruins of the old pier. The harbour, as has already been stated, is formed by the peninsula on which Hartlepool is built. It is an immense slake or bason, sufficiently extensive to shelter a whole navy. When en tirely flooded at high water, it contains about 200 acres ; but at low water, carriages, horses, and even foot passengers may cross the channel at its mouth with perfect safety. -f The inner harbour, or haven, inclosed between the old walls and the town, contains a surface of nearly 12 acres. Here the royal navy of England lay moored in safety, and here the bishops of Durham stationed their fleets. It was strongly fortified according to the manner ofthe age; the grand entrance being defended by the towers and chain before mentioned, while the arched water gate permitted the ingress and egress of boats. Quays probably extended around the whole of the land side; and the remains of slips or docks have been discovered in its immediate vicinity. The depth of water, even within the last 20 years, varied from 6 to 10 feet at high tide. This haven is now used by the fishermen as a dock, wherein they lay up their cobles in winter. A few years ago, an attempt was made to inclose and convert it to the purposes of agriculture ; but this plan was indicted as a nuisance, as the sweep of the back water contained by this haven is of the high est importance in scouring the port. The verdict of the jury before whom the cause was tried re stored it, in 1813, to its original destination. * George Pocock, Esq., subscribed \u00a3500; the Sunderland ship-owners, \u00a3378, Ils. 5d. ; the Trinity House, London, \u00a3210; the bishop of Durham, the Earl of Darlington, Lord Viscount Barnard, Sir H.

It is in every wind easy of access to light vessels, and to all laden ones of the burden of 100 tons and under, the latter description including about one-half of the whole of the ships employed in the northern coasting trade. When in this harbour, they are sheltered from the storms which are most fre quent, and the most destructive, on the eastern coast ; and in moderate weather they can sail out of it with all winds.\""], [635, "HARTLEPOOL. 487 Improvements. Mr. Hutchinson says, \" In order to improve the haven and town, it is possible at a small expense to carry a mole cross the slake, from the south-west angle of the town wall to the main land, which would stop the tide from flooding many valuable acres of ground, and occasion a sweep of water to cleanse an extensive bason, where ships would lie in great safety under the shelter of the land, and ply close to the walls, which at a small cost might be converted to a quay for merchandise.\" Mr. R. Dodd, engineer, in a report addressed to the corporation in 1795, proposes to erect a pier, 443 yards long, from near the entrance of the inner harbour to the main land on the west shore, with flood-gates to allow vessels to enter. The expense, including a light-house, he estimates at \u00a3\"21,537, 4s. 8d., which would render the harbour capable of containing 230 sail of vessels, such as are usually employed in the merchant service. By the quantity of water discharged at spring tides from the immense reservoir of the harbour, the channel, he says, would be scoured to the depth of from 16 to 24 feet. The principal obstacle, however, to the improvement of the port of Hartlepool, arose \" from the great staples of the country rising in distant parts, and lying upon the rivers Tyne, Wear, and Tees ;\" and it is probable that both the harbour and town might have been suffered to dwindle into insignificance, but for a concurrence of circumstances too important to be overlooked. The formation of Seaham Harbour on one side, and the Darlington and Clarence railways brought from the interior of the county to the Tees on the other, were alone sufficient to arouse attention to the capabilities for improvement possessed by the long-neglected port of Hartlepool. A scheme was accordingly set on foot for making a railway to it, and for opening it out. The capital pro posed to be raised for this undertaking was .\u00a3200,000, in shares of \u00a3100 each. A Prospectus, dated December 8, 1831, contains the following passages: \u2014 \" The extensive fields of coal, situated to the south of the river AVear, require additional facilities for shipment. It is well known, to all acquainted with the coal-fields in the north of England, that the county of Durham contains, under its surface, immense beds of coal, of the very best quality, which are, in a great measure, unworked. Such impediments have hitherto existed, to the opening out of these fields of coal, as to prevent capitalists from engaging in the working of them. But all doubt, as to the superior quality and abundance of the coal, being now removed, different companies have been formed, and are now actively en o-ao-ed in opening out these seams of coal, under a great extent of country, reaching from Haswell and Eas ington to Shadforth and Cassop, including Thornley and Ludworth. \" To the whole of this extensive coal-field, Hartlepool presents the nearest, and, in every point of view, the most advantageous place of shipment. To other collieries also, which are now working, Hartlepool holds out inducements, of the strongest possible nature, for ensuring the shipment of a large proportion of the produce of those collieries at that port. \" On a coast where, in bad weather, its rivers are inaccessible, and open road-steads afford the only shel ter, Hartlepool, in its improved state, will be a place of refuge, and the sure means of saving many lives and much property-* \" The line of railway to Hartlepool has been surveyed by stir. George Stephenson ; and he has recom mended that it should commence at the Moorsley Pit, belonging to the North Hetton Coal Company, pass in\" by Elemore Pits, belonging to the Hetton Coal Company, and so through the townships of HasweU and Easington, proceeding to Castle Eden. The new winnings, at HasweU and South Hetton, are thus brought * By tho evidence given before parliament, on Ihe Hartlepool Dock Bill, by Captain William Hewitt, Maritime Surveyor to the Board of Admiralty for the Kastetn Coast of England ; by Lieutenants Slater and Sherringham, employed by the Admiralty in survey in' part of the same coast ; by Sir John Rennie ; and by Mr. Milton, the engineer ; it appears, That the port of Hartlepool possesses -natural advantages and facilities for making it a coal port, as well as an asylum port for the coasting trade, superior to any of the exist ing harbours between the Humber and the Frith of Forth.-- Vii. t/ic Besult of the Evidence, SsC."], [636, "488 STOCKTON WARD.\u2014 N.E. D. upon the line ; and four distinct coal companies are placed upon the main line. A branch from the main line extends to Little Town Pit, and will take up the projected winnings at Thornley and Ludworth- Another branch line will proceed through AVingate, up to Cassop, affording an opportunity for all that coal to be directly brought upon the main line. The main line, thus joined by the branches, proceeds a little to the south of Castle Eden inn, through Hesleden, down to Hartlepool. \" AVith regard to the railway, nothing can be more satisfactory than the opinion of the eminent engineer who has been consulted on the subject. \" The Harbour of Hartlepool possesses advantages from nature, which, with slight improvements, promise to render it the first port in the north of England. It is proposed to convert the Inner Harbour into an extensive wet dock, surrounded by shipping places for coals, and capable of containing about one hundred and seventy skips. Another dock will be formed, capable of containing about two hundred and eighty ships, which, at a future period, may likewise be turned into a shipping harbour ; but vvhich, in the infancy of the undertaking, is intended simply as a mooring or waiting berth, where there will always be a sufficient depth of water for the largest class of vessels employed iii the coal trade to ride, under complete shelter from bad weather. \" The channel to the Harbour will be sufficiently deepened to allow vessels, of the largest size generally in use in the home and foreign coal trade of the kingdom, a free and safe entrance. A jetty will be ex tended so as to direct the stream cf back-water from the large slake ; which will be converted into a reser voir for that purpose, to cleanse and scour the Harbour and channel ; and the present pier will be repaired and lengthened. \" One of the principal advantages vvhich belong to the situation of Hartlepool, is its easy and safe access in all winds. The eastern and north-eastern winds, which are such unwelcome visitors to other coal ports, are the very winds in which Hartlepool may be taken most favourably. It is also intended to make a cut through the narrow neck of land, on the west of the town ; thus connecting the Docks aud Harbour with the sea, at the bay to the north of Hartlepool, called the Softleys ; which will greatly facilitate the dispatch of laden vessels, in almost any wind, without impeding the entrance of light vessels into the Harbour with the wind from the south. \" The advantages also to be derived, from the facilities of depositing ballast, must be apparent to all who are acquainted with the port. \" That this undertaking is one of great national importance, independent of all local interests, must be evident, from the reduction which will necessarily take place in the price of coals to the consumer, by in creasing the facilities of shipment, and by reducing freights in a ratio equivalent to the decreased distance, and other local advantages. It likewise possesses the most encouraging prospect of securing to the under takers a large return for the capital invested. So extensive is the coal-field* vvhich this undertaking will be the means of opening out in the county of Durham, and of such magnitude are the concerns now in progress, that the number of chaldrons to be shipped at Hartlepool, in the course of a very short period, must inevita-. bly be immense.\" * By the evidence of Mr. Thomas Fenwick, an eminent coal viewer of fifty years experience ; of Mr. Thomas Wood, the principal agent and manager of the Hetton Coal Company ; and of Mr. George Maddison, given before parliament on the occasion before men tioned, it appears that tlie making of Hartlepool a coal port, in connection with the proposed docks and railways, will open eut a dis trict of at least thirty square miles, abounding with coals ofthe very best quality. A bill \"for making and maintaining wet docks in the port of Hartlepool, and a railway from the said docks into the township of Moorsley, with certain branches therefrom, all in the county of Durham,\" and another \" for amending and rendering more effectual an act of King George the Third, for improving the pier and port of Hartlepool, in the county of Durham,\" were read for the first time-in the House of Commons on March 2, 1832; and, after passing through the inter mediate stages, and receiving some amendments in the House of Peers, were passed on the 24th of May following.8 By the first of these measures, the Company are empowered to purchase pro^ * These acts were obtained, in a great measure, by the perseverance and ability of Rowland Burdon, Esq., stir. Christopher Tennant, and some others of the neighbouring gentry.

By the latter bill, the act 53 Geo. III. c. 35, (1813) is amended, the duties imposed by it abolished, additional commissioners appointed, a tonnage duty laid on ships using the port, power granted to the commissioners to bor row money, the limits of the port fixed, penalties imposed for casting ballast within those limits, and the form of legal proceedings for their recovery specified. At a meeting of the Committee of the Hartlepool Docks and Railway Company, held July 9, Mr. Edward Steel was appointed principal engineer, and Mr. J. T. AV. Bell sub-engineer, for the railway ; and stir. James Milne, of Edinburgh, engineer for the docks. On a Plan of the Railway, drawn by Mr. J. T. W. Bell, the distances of the various workings from Hartlepool are stated as follow : \u2014 Moorsley Pit 14 miles Elemore' Pits 13! do. Little Town Pit 12f do. South Hetton, new winning 12.^ miles. Haswell, new winning ll| do. Thornley Borehole 10! do- The elevation above the level of the sea at Moorsley, and also at Little Town, is about 370 feet; at Thornley Borehole, 400 feet; and at the head of the Wingate branch, above 520 feet. The main line will continue down to tlie north side of the slake or harbour of Hartlepool. The Inner Harbour, or wet dock, will be enlarged to the width of 330 yards, and enclosed by a wall, with gates for the admission of vessels, on the scite of the old fortifications now standing. It will be provided with loading gears, and connected with the sea by a cut across the isthmus that joins Hartlepool with the main land, by which loaden vessels can immediately pass into a fine bay of 5 fathoms water, to the north of the town. From the south side of this dock a pier or jetty will extend about 1J0 yards to the west, with gates in its centre ; then turning to tbe north, it will join the main line of railway, thus enclosing the mooring or waiting berth mentioned in the Pros pectus. To retain the back-water in the large slake to the west, intended for scouring the harbour and channel, a jetty, nearly 450 yards long, will be erected from the point of the south, or Stran ton side of the channel, across to the north side of the slake ;_ and, by means of sluices, this water will be made to pass through the outer dock into the channel at the entrance of the harbour ; to facilitate which, and to prevent its sweeping too far to the southward, a short jetty or pier will extend in a south-easterly direction from the south point just mentioned. Thus, while the improvement of the port will render it capable of accommodating the commerce of nearly the whole county, the formation of the railway will supply the means of bringing the great staple of that commerce to its wharfs. Coals will shortly be wrought nearer to it than for merly ; and those from a distance may now be easily transported thither, by means of the great improvements already made, and still making, in the construction of machinery \u2014 improvements which may almost be said to annihilate space. Hartlepool is also situated in a rich corn country, and is well adapted for the shipment of lime. Many causes appear to concur in turning the tide of commercial prosperity towards the southern part of the county; and it cannot find a more ap propriate channel than here.

The parish of Stranton is bounded on the north and west by Hart, on the south-west by Elwick HaU, on the south by Greatham, and on the east by the sea. It contains three townships: 1. Stranton, including Tunstall; 2. Seaton-Carew, including Owton ; and, 3. Brearton. In 1821, the entire parish contained 143 houses and 704 inhabitants; and the annual value of property as sessed to the county-rate, in 1828-9, was _\u00a3?4562. This parish was anciently a member of the county of Sadberge. Strantox Evidently derives its name from its situation, the vill or town on the sea strand. The manor, for merly part of the ancient Hartness, was in the possession of the Lumleys. In the 36th year of Bishop Hatfield, Robert, son of Marmaduke de Lumley, held of Sir Roger de Clifford, by the eighth part of a knight's fee, the manor of Stranton with the appurtenances. In the 4th of Eliza beth, John Lord Lumley alienated the manor of Stranton, Seaton-Carrow, and Newburn Rawe, to Sir Thomas Gresham, Knt., from whose widow they descended to Sir William Read, Knt., of London, her son by a former husband. Portions of this manor were afterwards possessed by va rious owners ; namely, the Gibsons,f the AVhartons of Old Park, % the Wilsons of Hartlepool, the Maires of Hardwick-by-the-Sea, and others. Another manor in Stranton was anciently vested in the Fitz-Marmadukes of Horden, and their descendants, the Lumleys and Gascoignes of Ravensworth. In 1607, Sir AVilliam Gascoigne granted his manor and chief messuage of Stranton to Anthony Dodsworth, Gent., from whose de scendants they passed, in 1683, to Richard and WiUiam Reed, of Hart, yeomen.

The abbey of Guisborough held lands in Stranton, the principal part of which had been o-ranted by Robert de Brus. After the dissolution, they remained vested in the crown till July 31, 1609, when King James I. granted them to George Salter, Gent., and John AVilliams, of London, draper ; by whom they were granted, June 23, 1615, to Robert Gibson, Nicholas Dodshon, and John Dod shon, of Stranton, yeomen. This property afterwards passed to the family of Reed, in whom it remained for many years. Stranton is situated about a quarter of a mile from the sea, on the south side of Hartlepool har bour,*' and 10 miles north-north-east from Stockton. It is a pleasant, irregular village, surrounded by rich inclosed lands, with a number of scattered houses in its township.

The east window has four lights, ornamented with tracery ; and two other windows on the south side of tbe chancel, one of two, the other of three lights, have tracery in quatrefoils. On the north side, a porch, the ancient burial-place of the Fulthorpes of Tunstall, has been divided from the chancel by an octagonal pillar, supporting elliptic arches, now closed with masonry. A lofty pointed arch connects the chancel with the nave. There are two side-aisles, each formed by a single octagonal pillar, supporting blunt-pointed arches. The south aisle has two broad modern lights, and, at the east and west end, old windows of three lights, un der blunt arches. The nave has three upper windows on the south. An arch, which has formerly opened from the north aisle into a porch, is now closed. The tower is lofty, rising from pointed arches ; and under its west side is an old window of three lights. * \"In draining a morass on the side ofthe slake, a large quantity of human bones were discovered. One cut in particular, running from north to south about 50 yards, was a continued succession of graves, and seemed to be a ditch made expressly for the reception of dead bodies. Several other ditches have been cut through, full of human remains. It seems not improbable that these trenches were the hasty burial-place of the Scots soldiers who fell during the siege of Hartlepool in 1644.

In the general array of the clergy on Gilesgate Moor in 1400, the vicar of Stranton furnished one lancer and two archers. Charities. Fulthorpe' s Charity. \u2014 The Rev. Christopher Fulthorpe, by will, June 30, 1 707, devised to trustees all his property in Tunstall, Mordeston, Stranton, Throston, Hart, Hartlepool, and elsewhere in the county of Durham, that they, their heirs, and assigns, should, after paying certain legacies and annuities out of his estate called Catcoat, erect and build with the residue a school-house in such place, and according to such directions as he should give in writing ; and that after the said school-house should be so built as aforesaid, they should yearly pay the master of the said school for teaching such poor children, and so many as he should appoint in the writing aforesaid for that purpose, and for reading prayers in his chapel at Tunstall, for ever, the sum of \u00a320 yearly, by equal portions, at the feast of Pentecost, and St. Martin the Bishop, in winter ; and should also pay yearly \u00a310 at the feasts aforesaid for the purposes thereinafter mentioned (that is to say) \u00a38 for the buying coats, shoes, and hats for the poor scholars at Christmas and Easter ; and 40s. for the buying Common Prayer Books, AVhole Duties of Man, and Bibles, to be given to any that should want such books, and appear upon examination to have made the best improvement. He also directed that if his three grand-daughters, Mary, Elizabeth, and Margaret EUis, should die without issue, all the residue of the rents and profits of all the said estates, should be applied for and towards the purchasing lands for the augmentation of vicarages and parsonages within the county of Durham first, and then of the county of York, or elsewhere, as they should think fit. Conditions were appended relative to the qualifications of the master of the above school, who was to be a deacon or qualified as a deacon, and should be also able to write a good legible hand, and have some skill in arithmetic ; and that he should teach 15 children in Stranton and Hart parishes, gratis, and first those of the tenants ; but the testator desired that these might lead him his coals, and do other Uttle offices of kindness for him ; and that the number of 15 children should be made up of the poorest and most capable in each parish. No school has yet been established according to the directions contained in the will of the testator ; though the late proprietor of Catcoat is said to have admitted that \u00a3400, and the present proprietor that \u00a3290 had been returned from their respective purchase-monies, on account of the claim that might possibly be made upon them in respect of this charity. \" If these admissions,\" say the Commissioners for inquiring concerning Charities, \" can be established in evidence, it seems that they would be amply sufficient to rebut every presumption that might otherwise have arisen in favour of the purchaser from any lapse of time. This, however, is a question only to be decided by a court of equity.\" Tunstall, adjoining Stranton on the west, was the ancient seat of a younger branch of the Ful shorpes. In 1389, Richard II, restored it to Sir AAlUiam Fulthorpe. It afterwards passed by vol. i. \u2014 25, 6 K"], [642, "494 STOCKTON WARD.\u2014 N.E. D. marriage to the families of Radclyffe, Booth, and Strangways ; but was again acquired, by mar riage and purchase, by the elder line of Fulthorpe, in whom it remained till 1707, when it passed to the o-rand-daughters of the Rev. C. Fulthorpe. One of these intermarried with Robert Raikes, of Northallerton, Esq., whose son sold and mortgaged the estate. James Robinson, Esq., the pur chaser of a part, sold Tunstall to Mrs. Barras, and Catcoat to Mr. Henry Robson. Seaton-Carew, Or Seaton-C 'arrow, derives its addition from its ancient owners. Styr, son of Ulphus, gave lands in Seaton to the see of Durham in the time of Aldune, the first bishop. By the records, it appears that the manor and vill of Seaton were the estate of the family of Carrowe so early as the time of Richard I. Peter Carrowe, in the king's charter made to Hugh bishop of Durham, of the manor of Sadberge, is therein said to hold his lordship of Seaton of the crown, by the service of one knight's fee ; which service he and his heirs are awarded from thenceforth to render to the see of Durham, as others the bishop's tenants between Tyne and Tees. In 1200, Roald the prior, with the convent of Guisborough, in the presence of Philip bishop of Durham, licensed AValter, the son of Peter Carrowe, to have a perpetual chantry within the chapel of Seaton, therein to solemnize all church rites ; in consideration of which, he gave to the convent 60 acres and tofts of land, which Anne his grandmother some time held, with pasturage for 100 sheep and their lambs. In 1337, John de Carrowe died seized of this manor, which he held in capite of the bishop, by homage and fealty, and the service of a fourth part of a knight's fee, and doing suit at the wapentake of Sad berge, with a yearly rent of 13s. 4d. payable at the bishop's exchequer in Durham, at the feast of St. John Baptist, value _\u00a3?20. This family continued in possession from the above period for a considerable time ; and several parcels of land appear to have been held under them.* Bishop Bury granted to John Carrowe, who lived in 1387, free warren in this manor. In the 2d year of Bishop Neville, Sybill the wife of Roger Conyers, John Hayton, and Thomas Lumley, as heirs of the said John Carrowe, were found to be entitled to all his lands in Seaton, except certain lands called Masterland. John Hayton and Joan his wife enfeofed Ralph Earl of AVestmoreland in aU their lands in Seaton, which the earl gave to Sir John Lumley, Knt., and his heirs. By the inqui sition taken the 15th year of Bishop Langley, after the death of Sir John, it appears he held the fourth part of the manor by purchase from the Earl of Westmoreland, another fourth vvhich was the estate of his father Sir Ralph, and a third part held in dower by Isabel the wife of Sir Robert Umfrevill ; and that he had, besides, six messuages, four salt-pits, seven oxgangs of land, and ten acres of meadow, which he also purchased of the earl, rendering to him yearly =\u00a3\"19, 5s. 4d. In 1620, this manor belonged to Sir William Reed, of Oisterley, co. Middlesex, Knt. ; Sir Henry Anderson, of Elemore Hall, co. pal., Knt. ; and Robert Johnson, of Greatham, yeoman. -f- In 1766, there was a numerous set of claimants as tenants in common, having right to the manor, as * In 1363, John of Seaton-Carrowe having through ignorance seized a royal fish, cast on his lands there, and being called to account for the same, by his charter or deed acknowledged the trespass, and the bishop's right thereto, and compounded for 100 marks damage. t A cause was instituted by information in the bishop's court against Johnson, touching a royal fish cast on shore at Seaton. The cause was heard 1621, and a decree was made therein, declaring the fish was a royal fish, and belonged to the bishop in right of his prerogative."], [643, "STRANTON. 495 appears by a suit instituted in the court of chancery at Durham, touching a wreck within the manor of Seaton, the merits whereof were never discussed. In 1792, a portion of the manor and a considerable estate in Seaton were purchased from the assignees of Robert Preston, of Stockton, by George Pearson, of Durham, Esq., whose daughter and heiress intermarried with George AVil kinson, of Harperly, Esq., the present proprietor. The heirs of \u2014 Macdonald, Esq., also hold some property here. The village of Seaton is situated on the sea shore, 9i miles north-east-by-north from Stockton, and 3 miles south from Hartlepool. It consists of three sides of a square, inclosing a green ; the fourth side being open to the sea, which has probably carried away the east row. In some places, there is scarcely a passage between the houses and the edge of the bank ; and in others, the very foundations of the buildings are washed by the waves. A line of houses stretches southward, se- parated from the sands by a carriage road ; and at its extremity is a spacious hotel, with its range of buildings, erected during the proprietorship of Mr. Pearson. There are no traces of the ancient chapel, which was dedicated to St. Thomas a Becket, and given with the mother church to Guis- borough priory ; but a neat Gothic chapel was erected here in 1830, and endowed by Mrs. Lawson of Boroughbridge, whose son, the Rev. \u2014 Lawson, is the present curate. The east window is composed of three pointed lights, and there are four windows on each side. At the west end is a square tower. The Wesleyan Methodists also erected a small chapel, in 1830, in the south row of houses, facing the sea. In stormy weather, the minds of the worshippers will here be awed by the near and solemn roaring of the ocean, whilst its spray patters against the walls and windows of their little tabernacle. There is a small library in Seaton ; also a day-school, endowed with \u00a35 per annum by Lord Crewe's trustees : it is, however, very thinly attended, partly owing, as it is said, to the dependance placed by the poor on the gratuitous instruction received at the Sunday- schools of the place. This village has of late years risen into great repute as a fashionable bathing place, and contains some good and well-furnished lodging-houses ; with grocers, shoemakers, smiths, &c. Besides the hotel, here are three public houses, two warm bathing houses, and a number of bathing machines. A tide-waiter, two boatmen, and a pilot, belonging to the Stockton custom-house establishment, are stationed here. The sands are firm and level for five miles in length, and command an extensive and beautiful view of the Cleveland coast and of Hartlepool.* The township, which contains twelve farms, extends about two miles southward from the village to the point of land called Seaton Snook, near to which there are several moles and breastworks of earth, supposed to have been raised for the purpose of defending the entrance to the river Tees during the alarm in 1667- Owton is an ancient grange or manor-house to the south-west of Seaton. Robert Lambert for feited this manor for being concerned in the great Northern Rebellion. In 1574, Queen Elizabeth granted the manor, grange, and capital messuage of Owton, to Edmund Gresham and Percival Gunston. Richard Brookman, the next possessor, granted the same in fee to Richard Belassis, Esq. Sir William Belassis, his great-nephew, who had been high sheriff\" of Durham during the whole time of Bishop Morton, died December 3, 1641, leaving an eldest son, Sir Richard Belassis, of Ludworth and Owton, Knt., afterwards high sheriff.

In the reign of Charles II. , Sir William Blackett, Bart., held this manor, which afterwards belonged to the family of Turner* and subsequently to the hospital of Kirkleatham, PARISH OF GREATHAM. This parish is bounded by Stranton on the north-east and north, by the parish of Elwick Hall and the chapelry of AVolviston on the west and south-west, by Billingham on the south, and by the sea-marsh on the east. It includes two constableries, viz. Greatham and Claxton. In 1821, the parish contained 112 houses, and 484 inhabitants, forming 126 families, of whom six resided in Claxton, and the remainder in Greatham. The annual value of property assessed to the county rate for the year ending January 12, 1829, was _P3039. Greatham- The manor of Greatham belonged to Peter de Montfort the younger, whose father, of the same name, yvas killed, and himself made prisoner, at the battle of Evesham, won by Prince Edward against the confederated barons, August 5, 1264.

The village of Greatham is pleasantly situated on the ridge of a hill, on the north side of the small river to which it gives name, within 2-g miles of the sea at Tees mouth, and 6| miles north east-by-north from Stockton. A building was erected in 1831, in the centre of the village, for a school, endowed by the late bishop of Durham, and to be conducted on Dr. Bell's plan of educa tion ; but in consequence of a prejudice in favour of the old system of teaching, still very prevalent amongst the inhabitants of Greatham, this school is not as yet well attended. The village contains two day-schools, five public houses, a corn-mill, with shopkeepers, shoemakers, tailors, cartwrights, smiths, a surgeon, &c. A little to the east, James Langley, Esq., has erected a handsome mansion. The township includes seven farmsteads. On the marsh, near the mouth of the Tees, are the re mains of ancient salt-works, for which, though ruined, some of the adjacent farms pay a salt-rent to the Hospital. The cockle-beds near this place have long afforded employment to the poor of the neighbouring district. -f- The Church. In consequence of the ruinous state of this edifice, it was taken down in 1792, and rebuUt, with a square tower to the west. There are three pillars supporting pointed arches (part of the old structure) on each side of the nave. The lights are all modern ; three in each aisle, one on each side of the chancel, and a large east window. An elliptic arch connects the chancel vvith the nave. In the chancel are seats belonging to the Master and Brethren of Greatham Hospital ; and at the west end of the church are others for the inmates of Parkhurst's Hospital, above which is a hand some gallery, supported by cast metal pillars.^ Monuments. \u2014 On a plain oval tablet of white marble, against the south wall of the chancel : \u2014 \"In memory ofthe Rev.

He did not see his danger till he was nearly surrounded by the water, and knowing there was no possibility of escape, he began to consider how he could longest preserve himself from being carried away by the tide. A current of a few yards was all the unco vered space left him. He selected the highest spot, on which he placed his leap (a wicker basket, carried on the shoulder in shrimping), and fixing his shrimping pole, with the net downwards, to give the pole as sure a purchase as he could, he mounted his basket, and held by the pole- The tide soon covered his feet, and gradually flowed as high as his middle. After three hours he thought he saw the water fall ; but in a few minutes a breeze sprung up, and the tide flowed again six or seven inches. The tide, however, was falling, and he remained on his sand-bank till he was relieved by the fishing boats in the morning. His situation in the river was two miles from the Durham coast, and three from Yorkshire, in the midst of the Tees estuary, with the wide ocean full in front at the river mouth. He said it was an awful sight to look over the waters; but his presence of mind and his trust in Providence never forsook him. X The whole cost of rebuilding this church was but \u00a3315, 15s. 6d.

The glebe consists of 19 acres in Greatham township, which have a right of four gates on the marsh. The vicar has also the undivided moiety of 50 acres (of which the vicar of Dalton-le-Dale has the other moiety) in the township of Seaton-Carew, and the moiety of a farm house and stables in the village of Seaton, and of ten stints on Seaton Marsh. The Master of the Hospital holds the whole of the great tithes of Greatham ; but the vicar has tithe of hay and all small tithes in the township of Claxton, and all small tithes, but not hay tithe, in the township of Greatham, excepting from the Hospital lands, which are totally exempt. Greatham Hospital. This Hospital was founded by Bishop Stichill, by charter, bearing date on the Morrow of the Epiphany, 1272. The foundation is dedicated to God, St. Mary, and St. Cuthbert, for the good estate of the founder, for the souls of all kings of England, of the prelates of York and Durham, the monks of Durham, the parochians of St. Cuthbert, and for the souls of all the faithful de- parted. The endowment consists of the manor of Greatham (claimed by the bishop as his right by forfeiture, but which he says \" we had of the gift of our especial friend, Peter de Montfort\"), to hold to the Master and Brethren in frank almoigne, free from all toll, custom, geld, or stallage, fair or market, bridge-toll, castle-ward, sheriff or coroners' rents, suits of couit, bailiwick, or wa- pentake, &c. within the county ; with exemption from processes, except before the bishop, or the justices itinerant.* He also granted forty days indulgence to all who should increase the founda- * The statutes or ordinances are as follow : \u2014 Andrew de Stanley, priest, shaU be the first master ; and there shall be perpetually maintained five other priests and two clerks, of honest life and competent learn ing, to sing matins, and all canonical hours and placebo et dirige ; and forty poor brethren, to be chosen from"], [648, "500 STOCKTON WARD.\u2014 N.

Bishop Beke confirmed the endowment, and gave the church of Greatham to the Master and Brethren, adding one chaplain and one clerk to the establishment. Edward III. and Edward IV. also confirmed the charter ; and the latter granted to the Master and Brethren a weekly market and a fair twice a year. Bishop Tunstall issued letters of citation to visit in 1532; but no pro ceedings occur. This, being a lay foundation (valued at \u00a3\"97, 6s. 3-jd. annually), did not come within the statutes of 27 and 31 King Henry VIII. ; though it appears that the king's visitors at the dissolution carried off some \" superstitious ornaments\" of the chapel.

The bishop reserves to himself and successors the power of revising and altering the statutes. Two grants of corrodics, which occur on Hatfield's Rolls, may serve to explain the sort of subsistence which was provided for the poor brethren. In 1352, AVilliam Donant releases his corrody, viz. every day a loaf of second bread, half a pitcher of second ale, a rackfull of hay, a peck of oats, a candle, and a peck of coals in winter, and litter for one horse, and a chamber, and a gown of the suit of the serving men of the Hospital. In 1353, AVilliam de AVestle, Master, and the Brethren of Greatham, grant to Robert Menyot a corrody for life, of seven white loaves and seven pitchers of the better ale weekly, and every day such a commons as is served to one chaplain in hall, and 10s. for his gown; and if the same pensioner abide in tli9- Hospital, three quarters of sea-coal and three pounds of candles, and a decent chamber."], [649, "GREATHAM. 501 Gascoin.* \u2014 John Kingesmeyll, A. sti., March 1, 1571, p. m.

The present Hospital, the foundation-stone of which was laid September 15, 1803, is a square stone building, the principal front to the south, with a porch beneath three pointed arches, which are surmounted by a tower and cupola, with a clock. Above the entrance : \u2014 \"In fratrum hujus Hospitii usum, non sine grata patris sui nuper Episcopi Dunelmensis memoria, im pensis Joannis Guhelmi Egerton, Comitis de Bridgewater, Magistri, Anno Domini MDCCCIV, reparatum, ornatum, amplificatum.\" In the centre is a large hall, and around the three sides of the building are arranged the rooms of the poor brethren. The lights are all square, divided by stone mullions under labels. A grass plot, surrounded by a plantation, lies before the Hospital ; and the whole is brought to such a state of perfection as it had never before attained. The Master's house is a handsome modern building, with a pleasant garden, commanding a fine view of the rich inclosed country to the south, and of the Yorkshire hills. The vicar of Greatham, who is chaplain to the institution, reads prayers to the brethren in the Hospital chapel twice a day, for which he receives \u00a3T2 per annum, and \" for bread extraordinary 2s. monthly, at Pentecost 14s., and at Christmas 14s.\" The thirteen brethren, now all accommodated within the Hospital, are provided with excellent diet, fire, candles, &c. ; and each receives at Christmas 4s., on New-year's day 10s., at Midsummer 4s., and a new gown once in two years.

It is a neat building, and was erected on the scite of the old structure in 1788.* The following inscription, partly in the Saxon character, is cut on brass running round the edge of a marble slab in the floor of the chancel : \u2014 \" + Hie jacet Magister Wilelmus de Middiltoun sacre pagine doctor quondam custos dom's. istius orate pro eo.\" In black letter, on a brass plate fixed in the waU near the altar : \u2014 \"Orate pro a'i'abus Nicholai Hulme Joh'is Kelyng et Willi'm Estfelde clericor. quonda. hujus hospitalis Magistrij ac parentu. fundatoru. suor. benefactorii. atq; om'i fideliu. defuctor. quor. a'i'ab's p'piciet. deus.

In 1761, Dormer Parkhurst, Esq., then Master of Greatham Hospital, began to erect another, for six poor widows or spinsters, for whom he built six neat separate apartments, a little to the north of Greatham Hospital, with a garden-plot to each, and completed the same in the succeeding year at his own expense. -f- The endowment consists of about 27 acres of land in Stockton parish, * \"In the year 1414,\" says Hutchinson, \"the commons, willing to comply with the king's demand of a subsidy, presented an address, praying he would possess himself of the riches of the church, and seize the clergy's revenues. It was no novel thing : the preceding reign witnessed such another proposal, and the argument which supported both was, that the great annual revenue of the church would be more beneficially employed to the public service, the amount being three hundred and twenty-two thousand marks, sufficient to maintain fifteen earls, fifteen hundred knights, six thousand two hundred esquires, and a hundred hospi tals ; and the king's treasury reap yearly a surplus of twenty thousand pounds. The alarm this spread among the ecclesiastics occasioned them to assemble ; and the archbishop of Canterbury proposed, that to save the general wreck of the church, they should approach the king with the countenance of compliance, and, as a testimony of their zeal and attachment to his person and government, make a voluntary resignation of certain reUgious foundations where there was no cure of souls, and therewith the alien priories.

Claxton Is a small township, containing six farms, 6A miles north-east-by-north from Stockton. A branch of the Norman family of Heriz settled here, and gradually assumed the local name. Thomas prior of Durham granted a toft here to Leo de Claxton, for the foundation of a free chapel, with a quit-claim of two oxgangs of land which his grandfather had assigned for the same purpose. This manor continued in the same family till 1484, when Sir Robert Claxton died, leaving four daugh ters his coheirs. Claxton fell to the share of Margaret, the eldest daughter, wife of Sir AVilliam Elmedon, whose grand-daughter intermarried with Sir AVilliam Buhner, from whose family this estate passed, in 1632, to the Johnsons of Greatham and Seaton. It has since belonged to various proprietors. PARISH OF BILLINGHAM. The parish of Billingham is bounded by Greatham on the north, by Elwick Hall and Grindon on the north-west and west, by Norton on the south-west, by the same parish and the Tees on the south, and by the marshes at the Tees mouth on the east. It includes four townships or constable ries : 1. Billingham, with Belassis; 2. Coopen-Bewley ; 3. AVolviston ; and, 4. Newton-Bewleyr. In 1821, this parish contained 252 houses and 1154 inhabitants; and the annual value of property assessed to the county-rate in 1828-9 was =_?7388. Billingham Is a place of high antiquity, and memorable for a great battle fought there by Eardulf, king of Northumberland. Egfrid, bishop of Lindisfarne, gave Billingham, with divers large territories, to the church ; and it is noted to be one of those towns seized by \u00c6lla during the conflicts for the crown of Northumberland. \" Eanred, the father of Ethelred,\" says the Chronicle of Lindisfarne, \" builded, and gave this towne, amongest sundrye others, to the bishopricke of Durham, or rather, to speake in the phrase of that age, to St. Cuthbert, about the year 860.\" Under Bishop Cuth eard, 900 \u2014 915, the Pagan King Reingwald made a descent on the eastern coast, and portioning out his conquests amongst his followers, gave the country betwixt Jodene and Billingham to Scula. (See page 400.) King AVilliam I. restored Billingham to the church, and gave it to the prior and monks of Durham. Bishop Robert de Insula granted them warren and woods in Billinghamshire ; and many licences to the convent to acquire lands here occur in the records of the church. vol. i. 6 N"], [654, "STOCKTON WARD.\u2014 N. E. D. 506 Amongst the transactions of the ecclesiastics with their tenants, the origin of the family of Billing ham, afterwards of Crook Hall, occurs. John the Cowhird, of Billingham, married the sister of Bishop Kellaw, and by that alliance probably laid the foundation of his family's future elevation.* The church, however, gradually acquired, by sale or exchange, their rights in Billingham ; and a general release from Cuthbert Billyngham of Cruke Hall occurs in 1498.

At present, nearly the whole of the lands in the parish are held by leases for 21 years under the dean and chapter of Durham. The village of Billingham is pleasantly situated on a commanding eminence, about a mile from the estuary of the Tees, and 2\\ miles north-by-east from Stockton. The turnpike road from the latter place to Sunderland passes through it. Here are a brewery, a skinnery, five public houses, tailors, shoemakers, joiners, &c. ; and the township contains about sixteen farms. The Church Is said to have been originally built by Eanred ; but there is no appearance of such remote anti- quity in any part of the present structure. The tower is 48 yards high, has old double round- headed lights on each face, is embattled at the top, and contains three bells. The nave is also embattled, and the whole building is supported by buttresses. In the interior, the nave is se- parated from the south aisle by four clustered columns, supporting blunt-pointed arches with zigzag mouldings ; and from the north aisle by an equal number of square pillars (the eastern one having an aperture through it), supporting plain arches. At the east end of the north aisle is a niche, apparently designed for a statue, but now empty- The nave is connected with the chancel by a pointed arch, beneath which is a screen of trellis-work. The pulpit is placed on the south side of this arch. The chancel is stalled with oak in the cathedral style. The east window, and four lights to the south and two to the north, are all modern ; though they appear to have been originally lancet. The vestry is inclosed in the south-west corner of the church. The font is de- corated with a beautiful spire of wood work. The church-plate consists of a paten, given in 1712 by Mrs. Margery Davison (relict of John Eden, Gent., and wife of Thomas Davison), and two large silver flaggons ; one, \" Given to ye parish of Billingham A. D. 1758, by Tho. Chapman, D.

On a brass plate within the altar-rails is the figure of an ecclesiastic in the attitude of prayer, and two circular escutcheons of arms, with the following imperfect inscrip tion in Old English characters : \u2014 \"Hie jacet D'n's Robert Brerely prebendarius in eccl'ia p'ochiali de Norton ac Vicari : eccli'e p'ochialis de Bilingham Dunelm. dioc. qui obiit. ..die Ao- D'ni Mcccclxxx cuj. a'i'e p'picietur Deus Amen.\" On a brass plate in the middle of the chancel : \u2014 \" Orate pro a'i'a D'ni.

John Wallis, a botanist and historian of Northumberland, was for some years curate of Bil- lingham. He was born in the year 1714, but the place of his nativity is uncertain. The editors of the History of Cumberland say he was born in or near to Ireby in that county. He studied in Queen's College, Oxford, where he took his degree of A. sti. in 1740, and acquired some reputation as a sound scholar. Early in life he married a lady near Portsmouth, where he at that time resided on a curacy. During 56 years their matrimonial happiness was proverbial in their neighbourhood. In 1745, he published \" Reflections on a Candle, in an irregular Ode,\" printed by John Gooding, Newcastle upon Tyne, to which is prefixed an advertisement, announcing that he had opened an academy at WaUsend, where youth were to be taught Latin, Greek, music, geography, arithmetic, mathematics, navigation, and natural and moral philosophy. After this, he became curate of Simonburn in Northumberland, in which situation he indulged his taste for the study of botany, and filled his little garden with curious plants. These amusements, and the interesting remains of antiquity by which he was surrounded, led him into deeper researches; and, in the year 1769, he published his history of the county, in two volumes 4to. ; the first of which, containing an account of plants, minerals, fossils, &c. evinces the writer's knowledge in natural history : the other volume, consider- ing the limited nature of his plan, and the variety of the subjects which it embraces, is also possessed of considerable merit. This work was the result of twenty years' study and research ; \" rocks and dales, woods, heaths, and mountains, the shores of rivulets and the ocean, being his company in the hours of relax- ation, after leaving that august and venerable and truly charming and delightful seat of learning, the uni- versity of Oxford, where a period of seven years of his earliest days were spent.\" But Mr. Wallis's fortune did not improve with his reputation ; and a dispute with his rector, Dr. Scott, occasioned him to leave his happy retreat, though, alas! he had no other to fly to; and he and his wife were received into the family of a humane and benevolent clergyman, who had formerly been his friend at college. Soon after this, he be came curate, pro tempore, at Haughton-le-Skerne, 1775 ; and immediately after removed to the curacy of Billingham, where he continued until increasing infirmities obliged him to resign at Midsummer, 1792. He then removed to the neighbouring village of Norton, where, in a short time, vvith all the consciousness of a well-spent life, without a pain he expired, July 23, 1793, at the age of 79. His widow remained for a short time to lament his loss, and to look forward to their re-union in a future world. This venerable man, though possessed of good natural abilities, and no small share of acquired knowledge, lived and died in an obscure station. But his situation, perhaps, should not be much lamented, as his dis position was so mild, and his sense of duty so proper, that he acquiesced without a murmur or a sigh in his humble fortune, stir. Pennant and stir. George Allan kindly endeavoured to assist him with Bishop Eger ton, but failed, and the historian of Northumberland never had any preferment better than a curacy of \u00a330 a year. It should, however, be related, to the honour of the late bishop of Durham (the Hon. Dr. Barring ton), that when the circumstances and situation of Mr. AVallis were represented to him, he allowed him an annual pension from the time that he had resigned his curacy. From a sense of gratitude, stir. AVallis, just at the close of life, was employed in packing up an ancient statue of Apollo, found at Carvoran, a Roman station on the AVall, on the confines of Northumberland, as a present to the Hon. Daines Barrington, bro ther to the bishop. In addition to this pension, he, in consequence of the death of a near relation, possessed, for nearly the two last years of his life, the rent of a very small estate. The Rev. Richard AVallis, vicar of Carham, was his brother ; and the Rev. Richard AVallis, late rector of Seaham and perpetual curate of South Shields, is his nephew. In the year 1748, stir.

The ancient seat of the Lambtons and Edens here is now a farmhold, with stone walls of great thickness, and the remains of a regular moat, the usual defence of manor houses of the second class in a level country. A family bearing the local name were seated here at an early period after the Conquest. Ac cording to tradition, John de Belasys \" having made a vow to go upon the crusades, and a strong affection for his native place of Belasys prevailing, likely to stagger his resolution, he determined to shake off that yoke, root out partialities, and part with the estate of his ancestors, the regard for which stood in competition with his imaginary virtues.\" AA'hatever the fortunes of this sapient warrior might have been in the crusades, he lived, it seems, to return and repent of his bargain. The memory of this transaction was long preserved by the arms of Belassis and the following lines, inscribed on a window of the church of St. Andrew Auckland : \u2014 fc\u00c6titJCK fictjasigfi! iirUi>0i0 for fQenttnoUielh Hutchinson, on the authority of a charter by which John de Bellasis grants lands in AA^olviston to the prior and convent of Durham, places the date of the exchange in 1380. But, in 1361, an indenture occurs of common of pasture betwixt the prior and Alan de Billingham : \u2014 \" The prior shall hold his manor of Belasis in severalty at all times of the year, from the road called Ferygate eastwards, as the boundaries run betwixt the fields of Billingham and Bellassise (excepting only Alan's own lands within the same manor), and excepting a pasture called the AVethermerse, abut ting on Bondflatt east, and stretching to Haverland liche westward, where Alan and his men shall have enter common with the prior; and Alan and his men shall have common of pasture in the other fields of Billingham, excepting in Saltcrook, AVylycrok, Frognale, and Belasyse medowe.\" See also the previous award of the prior, quoted page 506. The transfer of Belassis to the prior and convent must, therefore, have been at an earlier period than that assigned by Hutchinson : (' a much more probable time also,\" observes Surtees, \" for a crusade with Prince Edward it may"], [660, "512 STOCKTON AVARD.\u2014 N. E. D. be, before 1272, than the date of the Wolviston charter, 1380, which seems to have been, rather, the last conveyance of the sweepings of the family estate in this southern angle of the county.\" The manor of Belassis, or Belsis, was leased for several descents to a younger branch of the Lambtons of Stainton. The B/ynde Lambton of Glover's Visitation, 1575, died childless, leaving three sisters his coheirs: 1. Elizabeth, wife to John Eden, of Durham; 2. Alice to Robert Claxton, of Old Park ; and, 3. Frances, to Sketon of Armeswell. The Edens acquired, by purchase and descent, the whole lease of Belassis,* which Sir John Eden, Bart., sold some years ago. Coopen, Or Cowpan-Bewley, is a village and township to the north-east of Billingham towards the marshes, and 5 miles north-east-by-north from Stockton. The village, which stands on the road from Bil lingham to Greatham, contains a day-school, a public house, a shoemaker, a butcher, and a black smith ; and the township, which belongs entirely to the dean and chapter of Durham, includes ten farms. Saltholme, one of the largest farms in the county, is let for _\u00a31800 per annum. Many race-horses are sent to it, to graze on the salt marshes, which extend along the north side of the Tees mouth. In these marshes are several large earthen mounds, now covered with herbage, the remains of the old salt-works which were carried on in this corner of the county. The abbot of Guisborough had his salt-works on the opposite coast.-f- AVOLVISTON. The church of Durham probably held lands in Wolviston under their ancient grants of the manor and the mother church of Billingham ; and other portions, extending in time to nearly the whole vill, were acquired by purchase or exchange from various proprietors. Bishop Galfrid gave half a carucate of land to provide a light for the chapter-house. Richard the Snarer, and Thomas his heir, exchanged their lands in AVolviston for various parcels in Pittington. Richard was what would at present be called gamekeeper to the bishop, and acquired his now suspicious title from the necessity which existed, before the invention of gunpowder, for taking wild animals by gins or snares. It was probably, at that time, a title of honour ; and his seal, a wolf passant, seems to confirm the common derivation of Wolviston. X Surtees, however, imagines that this place received its name from being the seat of AVulfe or AVulfhere, a Saxon settler. * 26 Eliz., July 20, Robert Eden, of West Auckland. \u2014 \" AVhereas John Eden, my sone, is contented that I his father shall appoynte and assigne the right he hath in Belsis, &c. I wyll, that when he is fitt to go to the Universitie, he shall have xx markes paid out of Belsis yerely ; and when he shall go to the Inns of Courte, twenty poundes in like manner.\" t Extensive staiths for the shipment of coals have been lately erected on the south side of the Tees, op posite Saltholme ; and the necessary consequence is the formation of a town in their vicinity, called New port, which is fast advancing in size and population. Great quantities of coals have been already exported from hence. X Long after the extirpation of the formidable marauder, the wolf, from the forests of England, the prac tice continued of giving rewards for the heads of more petty enemies. It was customary, so late as the 17th century, for persons to bring the heads of foxes, slain within the parish of AU Saints, Newcastle upon Tyne, and nail them to the church-door, for which they were paid by the churchwardens a shilling a head. An"], [661, "BILLINGHAM. 513 The village of AArolviston is pleasantly situated on the turnpike road between Sunderland and Stockton, 5 miles north-by-east from the latter place, and 2 miles to the north of the villao-e of Billingham. The soil on which it stands is dry, and the southern prospect is extensive and beau- tiful. It is a considerable village, and contains several good houses. Rose Villa, the seat of Ro- bert Appleby, Esq., is a neat modern mansion, a little to the south. Wolviston contains six public houses, a spirit and porter merchant, five shopkeepers, a corn-miller, four butchers, two gardeners, two stone-masons, a bricklayer, four joiners and cartwrights, two blacksmiths, two tai- lors, two shoemakers, and a saddler; and the township includes thirteen farmsteads. In the vil- lage is an academy, conducted by the Rev. Lancelot Christopher Clarke, A. B., curate ; and a good school-room has also been recently erected by voluntary subscription for Mr. AV. M. Snaith. Here are also two other day-schools, and a chapel or meeting-room belonging to the AVesleyan Methodists. An annual festival with petty races is held on the Monday after St. Mary Magda len's day.* The Chapel of Ease stands in the centre of the village. Until 1830 it consisted only of a nave and chancel ; but, in that year, a neat square tower was erected on the south side of it, containing an entrance porch, with a gallery above it, on the front of which is the following inscription : \u2014 \" This chapel was enlarged and a gallery and steeple were erected in the year 1830, by which means 190 additional sittings have been obtained; and in consequence of a grant from the Society for promoting the Enlargement and Building of Churches and Chapels, 130 of that number are hereby declared to be free and unappropriated for ever, in addition to 136 appropriated sittings formerly provided. \"Lancelot Christopher Clarke, A. B., minister. Thomas Bradley, Thomas Stephenson, chapel-wardens.\" In the loft above the gallery are two small bells ; and the top of the tower is ornamented by corner pinnacles. The old entrance porch, at the west end of the chapel, is now converted into a vestry ; a convenience not previously possessed by this place of worship. The pulpit and reading desk are placed against the north wall. A window to the east is surmounted by a circular arch ; but the whole building is but indifferently lighted.

Newton-Bewley, Or Beaulieu, is a small scattered village, six miles north-by-east from Stockton. It contains a public house and a corn-mill ; and the township includes seven farms. The whole belongs to the dean and chapter of Durham ; the manor-house and the demesnes being assigned to the twelfth stall. \" This place,\" says Surtees, \" was named Newton in reference probably to AArolviston, and had possibly its addition of Beaulieu, not from any imputed beauty of situation (in which it could have no preference over the prior's villages of Billingham and Wolviston), but because here was the prior's court-house or residence, within his manor of Billingham.
