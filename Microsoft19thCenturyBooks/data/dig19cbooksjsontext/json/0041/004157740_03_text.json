The errors, thus assumed to exist in the Record, do not seem to be attributable, as in other cases, to the maladroitness of a supplementary Scribe. If they are errors at all, they are chargeable on the Original, which classifies three Manors, Cerletone, Eslepe, and Sudtelch, under Culvestan Hundred, and, as I think, inaccurately. As to St. Alk mund's Manor of Cerletone, its identity with Charlton near Shaw bury is unquestionable. I conclude that the Domesday Scribe who wrote the words, \" In Culvestan Huud.\" opposite to Cerletone did so in error, and that they ought to be expunged. On their removal, Cerletone will fall under Bascherch, as the Hundred of Pres tone, the next preceding Manor. There in due course we shall recur to it. As regards Eslepe and Sudtelch, the presumed error ofthe Scribe is different, viz. an error of omission. Eslepe is named consecutively with certain Culvestan Manors of William Pantulf, which Manors can still be identified \u2014 and in the expected quarter. But Eslepe is not to be found there, under that or any similar name. If it be identical with Sleap, as I shall hereafter show that it was, then the true marginal affix has been omitted by the Domesday Scribe. That affix should probably be \" Bascherch Hundred.\" Of Sudtelch, which follows Eslepe on the Record, it is needless here to speak. Its re moval from Culvestan Hundred is a Corollary of the textual emen dation proposed in regard to Eslepe. The remaining Manors of Culvestan Hundred are classified in the annexed Table in accordance with the letter of Domesday. The identity of one of them (Estune) is a question, but not so hopeless as to be suggestive of an error in the Record. Of Estune we shall speak in the ordinary course. All other Manors of Culvestan Hun dred ave to be identified with case and certainty.

The exception is Clee Stanton, which, having been a St. Milburg's Manor, was, in the time of Richard I, attached to the Franchise of Wenlock. The Palatine and other independent Manors which I add to Cul vestan Hundred as a matter of classification, are all in the modern Hundred of Munslow. The Domesday Status of some of them was probably extra-hundredal, and some of them in certain relations continued independent to much later periods. J^tantmt 3Lacp+ As Osbern fitz Richard and Ralph de Mortimer respectively bore the chief sway in the Domesday Hundreds of Overs and Condetret, so in Culvestan Hundred was the interest of Roger de Lacy predo minant. His great Manor of Stanton, which he held immediately of the Crown, is thus described in the Survey.1 \u2014 \"The same Roger holds Stantone. Siuuard held it (in Saxon times), and was a free man. Here are twenty hides and a half geld able. There is arable land enough for fifty ox-teams. In demesne there are ten teams, and twenty-eight teams amongst the male and female Serfs ; and sixty-seven Villains and two Smiths and five Boors and four Cozets3 have amongst them all twenty -three Teams. Here is a Church having a hide and half (of land), and the two Priests with two VUlains have three Teams. Here are two Mills of 26s. (annual value). St. Peter of Hereford has here one Villain. Of this land, in the above Manor, Richard holds a hide and half, Azeline a hide and half, Roger a hide and half. These (three) have in demesne six teams, and six Serfs, and two Semi-Villains, and five Boors, and two Cozets with one team, and a Mill of 10s. (an nual value) . Out of the same Manor four serving men (Servientes) 1 Domesday, so. 260, b, 1 and 2. and are supposed to have been somewhat above the degree of mere Villains, but au thorities differ as to how far they were re moved from Villainage, and in what their superiority consisted. 2 The Cozets and C'otarii of Domesday were not quite identical, though the differ ence between them cannot now be deter mined. They were Tenants of cottages."], [23, "5 STANTON LACY. have land sufficient for three teams, and (have) a ferling, and they have four Teams and ten acres of land.3 Here are three Radche nistres having laud sufficient for two teams and a half, and here they have that number of teams. And one man, Auti, holds one member of this Manor, wherein are three hides ; and thereon he has one Team wth a Semi- Villain.4 The whole manor in King Edward's time was worth \u00a324. (per annum) ; now it is worth \u00a325.\" Here we notice, in the first place, how liberally this Manor was stocked. There were upon it many teams more than it was estimated to require. Of the five Shropshire Manors which Roger dc Lacy held of the King, Siward the Saxon had previously enjoyed four, viz. Hopton (Wafre), Cleobury (North), Stanton (Lacy), and Aldon. Under the two first I have already spoken of Siward,5 and it remains here to notice how appropriate is his presumed designation, as \" a rich man of Shropshire,\" to his possession of two such Manors as Stanton and Aldon. It is here fitting that I should insert the little that is known of the origin and antecedents of Roger cle Lacy. He was the eldest son and heir of Walter de Lacy, who died in the year preceding that in which the Domesday Survey was completed. Walter de Lacy was undoubtedly that Sire de Lacie whom Mestrier Wace enrols among the heroes of Hastings.6 His Nor man Fief was considerable, but the place which gave him his name was Lassy in the Arrondissement of Vire and Diocese of Baieux. At Lassy and at Campeaux Walter de Lacy was Tenant of a Knight's-fee under the Bishop of Baieux. Bishop Odo, the Con queror's Brother, and one of the chief leaders of the English ex pedition, was therefore, at the time of that Invasion, Walter de Lacy's Suzerain. There is some probability that Walter de Lacy enjoyed an estate in Herefordshire in the days of the Confessor. Domesday, giving account of four Carucates of land in the Chatel lany of Clifford, which, at the time of the Survey, were held by three teams, and had a ferling (i. c. a vir gate) and ten acres besides ; and they had stocked the whole with four Teams. 4 The Dimidii Villani of Domesday I take to be the same as the Colibcrti ; that is Villains partially enfranchised. 5 Supra, Vol. Ill, pp. 22, 23.

Roger de Lacy, adds the words Pater ejus tenuit,7\u2014an expression which all analogy directs us to refer to a period before the Con quest. Such an interest in Herefordshire, though small, may ac count for Sir Walter de Lacy's subsequent feoffment in the Western Counties. Ordericus, under the year 1070, tells us how King William bestowed the Earldom of Hereford on William fitz Os bern, Seneschal of Normandy, and how the King associated Walter de Lacy and other approved Warriors, with the Earl, in opposition to the threatening attitude then assumed by the WTelsh.8 This account of the King's policy and actions is probably correct in the main, but there is reason to think that Fitz Osbern's destination to the West was somewhat earlier. Indeed Ordericus's knowledge of the chronological sequence of these events was, as he himself shows, not correct ; for he represents Fitz Osbern's Earldom as a gift con sequent upon the death of Earl Edwin and the imprisonment of Earl Morcar ; while the fact is, that Earl William fitz Osbern was slain in Flanders on February 20, 1071, and therefore some weeks, if not months, before the sad fate of the two Saxon Earls was defi nitely sealed. Domesday tells us incidentally of a Feoffment be stowed on Walter de Lacy by Earl William fitz Osbern,9 but it is impossible to say what proportion of the estates enjoyed by Roger de Lacy in 1086 were derived from the Earl's grants to his Father, and what accrued subsequently to the Earl's death.10 And this remark will apply to estates in Shropshire as well as in Hereford shire ; for, as we have seen under Cleobury Mortimer, the Earl of Hereford's Palatinate was not limited to his own County. Walter de Lacy's advancement was steady and progressive. The Deposi tion of Archbishop Stigand is known to have been effected at Easter in 1072, aud Domesday shows one of his Gloucestershire Manors to have fallen to Lacy. But Walter de Lacy's conduct in 1074, when he opposed the rebellion of his own Suzerain, Earl Roger de Britolio, was perhaps the crowning cause of his advancement. His loyalty was exhibited most opportunely; for the Earl's fall placed a vast Fief at the King's disposal. Hence what we find stated of two Manors in Domesday, may be true of fifty, viz. that Earl William's 7 Domesday, so. 184, a, 1. 8 Ordericus, p. 521, D. de Rogerio de Laci. \u2014 And also (so. 184, b, 2.)

For whatever else is known of Walter de Lacy I refer elsewhere.11 He died on March 27, 1085, in consequence of a fall received while superintending the building of that Monastery at Hereford which figures in Domesday as the \" Church of St. Peter.\" Part of Walter de Lacy's endowment of this Church is connected with our present subject. \u2014 A Monastic Record informs us that he gave thereto ten Villains in ten distinct Vills of his Fief;1- that is, he gave as much land in each instance as was held in Villainage by one Tenant. Two of these ten Vills were Staunton and Stoke in Shropshire ; and Domesday, as we have seen above, distinctly confirms the truth of the Monastic Record, by assigning to St. Peter's of Hereford a Villain in Stantone. Roger de Lacy, eldest son and heir of Walter de Lacy and Ermelina his wife, succeeded to his Father's Barony shortly before the Domesday Survey was undertaken. That Record exhibits one instance where the Son had been already a Grantee of King Wil- Uam, viz. in a fourth part of a certain Manor, three-fourths of which had been bestowed on Walter de Lacy by Earl William Fitz Osbern.13 Roger de Lacy was now the Tenant of upwards of a hundred Manors in Berkshire, Shropshire, Herefordshire, Worcestershire, and Glou cestershire ; but I reserve some further account of him and his Suc cessors till I come to Ludlow. Here I will proceed with the specific history of Stanton Lacy. Under that name the Manor first occurs when, at least seventy years after Domesday, a Charter of King Henry II restored it or confirmed it to Hugh de Lacy.14 In 1187, during a temporary Escheat which befell the House of Lacy, I find Stanton assessed 5 merks to a King's Tallage. ,15 In 1221, Robert de Staunton, probably a Tenant here, appears as Attorney for the men of Staunton in a Suit which they, in common with the men of Ludlow, had about a right of pasture against the Abbot of Glou cester.16 By Fine dated May 1228, Ralph de Clune quit-claims for half a merk a half-virgate in Stanton for which he had sued Thomas de Wiggelegh and Margery his wife under writ of mort d'ancestre.

Manors as Stanton Lacy will now be apparent. The Inquisitions of Hundreds taken in 1255, include Stanton Lacy in no particular Hundred, though the Munslow Jurors spoke of the franchises which the heirs of Lacy claimed to exercise in Ludlow and Stanton. These franchises were, to have a gallows, to hold pleas of bloodshed and hue and cry, and to assize beer ; \u2014 also to try, under writ -of -right, all civil causes within their jurisdiction.17 Stanton Lacy was in fact at this time free from all Hundredal subjection, and so its own twelve Jurors responded to the queries propounded by the Justiciars who took these Inquests. The Jurors' names were Helias de Sutton, Robert Dovile, Roger de Akes, Wil liam de Avenitre, Robert Clerk of Doddemore, Robert fitz William, Thomas le Harpur, William de la Hall, Robert and Adam de Heyton, Richard Conni (i. e. Gunny), and Richard fitz Odo.18 These Jurors gave a somewhat full account of the knights'-fees and lands which owed service to Ludlow Castle ; but the particulars of their state ment belong to other sections of our subject. Of the state and tenure of their own Manor of Stanton-Lacy, they said not a word, nor indeed were any of the questions put to them calculated to elicit this kind of information. The only matter which they spoke of, and which can be taken as strictly local, was how one Roger de Heiton had for six years paid 13d. per annum for the Advowry of the Preceptor of Lidley : that is, I suppose, a Trader resident at Stanton had escaped the payment of all local dues by associating himself with the Order of Knights Templars, whose Advowry, or Patronage, extended to numberless Clients, and conveyed to those Clients a participation in the great immunities of the Order. At the County Assizes of January 1256, the Manor of Stanton was represented by its twelve Jurors. Robert de Malmesey was Chief Bailiff. The Jurors were Robert de Deuvill, Elyas de Sutton, Roger de Staunton, WiUiam de Wodinton, Robert de Buddemory, Robert Cusifot, William de Avenetre, Robert fitz WiUiam of Stan ton, Nicholas fitz Roger of Stanton, Roger fitz Walter of Henton, Robert de MalmeshuU, and Richard Gabythewaye. These Jurors gave account of all Pleas of the Crown arising within their Liberty. A civil Suit however, which came before the Court, shows us more of the then state of the Manor as held in Coparcenery by the heirs of Lacy. WiUiam de Stanton Lacy, as son and heir of Richard de Stanton Lacy, sued William de Songare under writ of mort d'an cestre for a messuage here. The Tenant, WUUam de Songare, called '7 Rot. Hundred.

Robert fitz Robert to warranty, the latter similarly called Roger de Staunton, and he, having been enfeoffed by Gilbert de Lacy, long since deceased, alleged the Charter of said Gilbert, and further called his heirs to warranty. The said heirs were Geoffrey de Genville and [Matilda his wife, daughter and coheir of Gilbert de Lacy, on the one hand, and Nicholas de Verdon, son of Margery, daughter and the other Coheir of Gilbert de Laci, on the other hand. Nicholas de Verdon, it appeared, was a Minor, in custody of his Father, John de Verdon, and so the cause was adjourned till he should be of age.19 In June 1261 William le Harpur of Stanton was on an Inquest which found that Hugh de Hauckeford, a prisoner for the murder of Roger fitz Nicholas, was blameless in the matter. The two had had a quarrel.20 At the Forest Assizes of February 1262, Robert de Stanton occurs as one of the Regarders of the Long Forest. In Easter Term 1263, Emma, Widow of Walter de Fenhampton, was suing Roger Eylrich and others for dower in Staunton, Ludlow, etc., but the cause was adjourned. At the Assizes of August 1267, Ede lina, daughter of Richard Carpenter of Diddlebury, with Roger and Walter her sons, quit-claim their right in five acres in Staunton to Richard fitz Odo of Heyton and his heirs. In January 1271, Reginald Phlasse, a Clerk, has a Writ of Novel Disseizin against Roger atte Ales of Stanton Lacy, for a tenement there. At tlie Assizes of September 1272, Roger de Camvull appeared as Chief Bailiff of Stanton Lacy ; the Jurors being William de Wodeton, Robert de Stok, William de Suche, William de Avetre, Robert Doville, Robert Kangefot, Riehard de Dodemor, Roger de Acres, WUliam Gonny, Walter Colet of Stanton, Walter de Strangeford, and William de Haemon. On a Ludlow Jury of November 11, 1274, I find the names of William Gunni and Roger Wymund of Heyton, and of Robert de Stok in Stanton, as he is here called. The Jurors who, on November 26, 1274, answered the King's Justices as to divers matters concerning the Liberty of Stanton Lacy were, Roger de Aka, Walter de Strongeford, William de Avenetre, William de Rocle, Robert de Stanton, William Gunny, Richard de Heymon, William de Haemon, Walter Colet, Robert de Furchis, Hugh fitz Alan, and William de Hopton. They said that Sir Geoffrey de GenvUl held the Manor in capite per baroniam ,- and indeed, on the partition of Lacy's estates, Stanton seems to have 20 Inquisitions, 45 Hen.

Sir Geoffrey had a right of free warren at Stanton, but not so as to injure his neighbours. The further report of these Jurors relates chiefly to acts of injustice suffered by the Liberty or its Free holders at the hands of the Sheriffs or other Officers of the King or of neighbouring Barons. Thomas de Grete, Bailiff of Munslow Hundred under the Shrievalties of Hamo le Strange and Ralph de Mortimer, had extorted a fictitious penalty of \u00a35. from the Liberty in general, and committed other acts of injustice. John de Peire bruge, a Sheriff's Receiver ;\u2014 The Serjeant of the Peace under \u25baHamo le Strange ; \u2014 William le Enfant, Bailiff of Munslow under William Bagod's Shrievalty ; \u2014 Roger de Boreford, Under Bailiff to Thomas de Grete ; \u2014 John Baril, Undersheriff to Hugh de Morti mer ; \u2014 Hugh de Mortimer himself; \u2014 PhiUp de Clinton, Coroner;\u2014 the Bailiffs of John Esturmy, Constable of Ludlow ; \u2014 John de la Watre, Constable of Corfham. \u2014 All these had in several ways and at different times been guiity of acts of extortion or wrong by which the Vills of Stanton, Upper Heyton, Hopton, and Sutton had suf fered. Several individuals also complained, and amongst others these, \u2014 viz. Robert de Furchis, WUUam Gunny, William de Hopton, Nicholas de Stanton, MatUda de Heyton, and Hugh Clerk of Stanton.31 The Feodary of 1284 gives Staunton as held by Peter de Genevill, by gift of Geoffrey de Genevill, his Father, who held the Manor in capite per baroniam. The circumstances under which Peter de Genevih acquired Stanton Lacy in his Father's lifetime shall be more particularly given under Ludlow. On June 8, 1292, the said Peter was deceased, and in obedience to the King's Writ of that date, a Jury assembled at Lud low on July 17 to give account of his estate. \u2014 Conjointly with Jo hanna his wife, he had held Stanton Lacy of Sir Geoffrey and Ma tilda, his Father and Mother, by knight's service, while Geoffrey and Matilda held it in capite, by service of 2i knights'-fees for this and all other their lands in England. The Valuation of this Estate was as follows. \u2014 A Capital messuage and Garden, 20a\\ Four carucates of land, \u00a316. Thirty acres of meadow, \u00a33. 6*. 8d. A Water- MiU, \u00a31.10*.

Hence the Feodary of 1316 gives Roger de Mortimer as Lord of Stanton juxta Ludlow.33 As regards Undertenants in this Manor I have merely to add the names of some who constituted the Jury at the Assizes of 1292. These were \u2014 Nicholas Eylrich, Chief Bailiff; \u2014 and William de Doddemore, Roger Colet, John de Borewardesleye, William Goby thewey, Richard Gunny, WiUiam Barker of Stanton, William de Ha union, William de Avenetre, and Robert Clerk of Stanton, Jurors. THE CHURCH. Shortly before Domesday, Walter de Lacy gave two-thirds of the Tithes of Stanton to his Monastery of St. Peter's at Hereford.2'1 Domesday speaks of the Church here as endowed with a hide and a half of land and apparently as served by two resident Priests. Domesday seldom speaks of Tithes, but it is probable that the re maining third of the Tithes of Stanton Lacy was retained for the Parochial Church. On April 24th, 1290, Stanton Lacy was visited by Bishop Swinfield. The Prior of Lanthony, whose interest here wUl presently appear, provided hay and straw for the horses of the Bishop's Suite, whilst Master Richard de Heyton, who has before occurred to us as a Portionist of Holgate, made a present of oats.20 In 1291 we find the Prior of Lanthony in Monmouthshire to be Rector of Stantone Lacy in the Deanery of Ludlow. His interest was valued at the large sum of \u00a336. 13*. 4d. per annum, while the Vicar's portion was \u00a311. more.26 I imagine that this Advowson must have been given to Lanthony by Hugh de Lacy (I) early in the twelfth century, but the grant is nowhere extant ; nor is there any Record of the negotiations which must have taken place with St. Peter's of Hereford, or Gloucester Abbey,27 before Lanthony could have been entitled to the whole of this Rectory. In 1341 the Church Taxation of Stanton Lacy was quoted by the Assessors of the Ninth at 71 \\ merks (\u00a347. 13*. 4d.). They taxed 22 Inquisitions, 20 Edw.

These receipts were chargeable with 7*. 8d. for procurations and syuodals ; while at the triennial \\isitation a sum of \u00a32. 13*. 3d. payable to the Bishop was equal to a further annual deduction of 17*. 9d.29 EARLY INCUMBENTS. Adam de Bromhal, Subdeacon, was instituted on Oct. 7, 1300, at presentation of the Prior and Convent of Lantonia prima (i. e. Lanthony in Monmouthshire). Richard de Penebrugg resigned this Living in 1310, having exchanged preferments with \u2014 Griffin de Weston, late Coporcioner of Landewey Trefendak (Menev.

HOPTON CANGEFORD. It is impossible to say whether this member of the Domesday Manor of Stantone was the hide and half held by Richard, or one of the similar estates held by Azeline and Roger, or the three hides held by Auti. In 1165 WiUiam de Hopeton was Tenant of a Knight's-fee under Hugh de Lacy, and I doubt not was Lord of Hopton.31 His Tenure is classed among those of new feoffment : that is, he or his Ancestor would ordinarily be understood to have obtained entry here later than the reign of Henry I. However, as I have intimated under Rushbury, the Fees of New Feoffment in Lacy's Barony (all apparently in Shropshire) seem to have been classified as of new feoffment under some exceptional circumstances ; aud I do not think that such classification necessarily implies that none of the Tenants of 1165 were hereditary representatives ofthe 23 Inquisitiones Nonarum, p. 188. 20 Valor Ecclesiasticus, III, 201. 30 Compare Patent. 13 Edw.

Domesday Tenants, or, in other words, of the Tenants by old feoff ment. In October 1199 I find mention of Herbert Cangefot as Recog nizor in a Suit concerning Clee St. Margaret.32 He was, I doubt not, Lacy's Tenant at Hopton, and from him the place took its dis tinctive name of Hopton Cangeford, but how he was descended from William de Hopton I cannot say. At the Assizes of October 1203, Herbert Cangeford essoigned his attendance under the Com mon Summons, his Essoignor being Roger de Hupton. In March 1227, one whose name is written as William Kangelot, may possibly have belonged to this succession.33 But in or about 1240, Nicholas de Hopton held one knight's-fee in Hopton under Walter de Laci.34 He was, I think, a Cangeford by descent, but with him the original name of his family became disused. His Successor, probably his Son, was Thomas de Hopton, who in 1250 fines half a merk for some Writ;35 and who in 1251 was impleaded by Philip de Thongland for disseizing the said Philip of a right of common in Hopton and Poston. In 1255 the Stanton-Lacy Jurors returned Thomas de Hopton as holding a knight's-fee, \u2014 one of those which were deemed to be appurtenant to Ludlow Castle.36 This fee was doubtless Hopton Cangeford; but I cannot say how Roger de Hopton, who occurs in the same year, was related to Thomas. On August 28, 1255, this Roger was impleading Margery de Lacy (Widow of Walter above-named) for disseizing him (Roger) of a tenement in Hopton. He paid 2 merks for the Writ ordering trial of his suit. At the Assizes of January 1256 Thomas de Hopton was found to have disseized Philip de Grete of 3 acres in Hopton. Judgment went in default of Thomas's appearance. His Sureties were WU liam fitz John of Hopton and William de Heyton.37 In February 1259, Roger de Hopton takes out a writ of novel disseizin against Thomas de Hopton and others. In May 1259, Roger, son of Tho mas de Hopton, takes out a similar writ against William de la AungT. A tenement in Hopton was in dispute in each case.

In April 1265, Roger, son of Thomas de Hopton, has a Writ of novel disseizin against William de Langele for a tenement in Hopton. In 1270, John de Halcton has a simUar writ against Hugh de Halcton for a tenement in Hop ton Kangefote. In 1282-3 Robert Cangefot of Hopton in Staunton Parish is sued by Joseas fitz Mansell, a Jew, for a debt of 4 merks.38 This Robert Cangefot39 was not however Lord of Hopton ; for the Feodary of 1284 gives Roger de Hopton as holding the Vill under Peter de GeneviU (one of Lacy's Coheirs), by service of a knight's fee. The Inquest on the death of Robert BurneU, Bishop of Bath and Wells, taken Dec. 10, 1292, found him to have had 24*. annual rent in Hopton Langefot, which he held of Peter de Genevile's heir, by doing Suit to the Manorial Court of Stanton Lacy.40 Similarly Edward Burnell, dying in 1315, held a messuage, 30 acres of land, and 2 acres of meadow, in Hopton Cangefot, and his estate there is called a \" member of Holegod.\"41 Nevertheless the chief Seigneury in Hopton remained all this time with De Verdon, Lacy's other coheir, and the chief tenancy with the Hoptons. A Fine levied at Shrewsbury in November 1292 may be taken as a technical mode of entailing this estate. \u2014 Roger de Hopton and Johanna his wife, Deforciants, acknowledge themselves to have given to Roger de Cheney, Plaintiff, the Manor of Hopton Cangefot. This was clearly in trust, for Cheney in return conceded the Mauor to Roger de Hopton and his wife for the life of either, \u2014 to hold at a rose-rent and by performance of capital services ; \u2014 with remainder to John, son of Roger de Hopton, and Margery, John's wife, and the heirs of their bodies, \u2014 to hold of the Lords of the fee ; \u2014 with further remainder to the right heirs of the said John de Hopton.

This was clearly another of the four members of Stanton Lacy indicated in Domesday ; but which of the four Feoffees of Domesday held it I have no means of judging. In 1165 I think Wootton had reverted to the Lords of the Fee; for I can detect no probable Tenant thereof among the names of Lacy's Feoffees. Within ten years afterwards I suppose William de Wodeton, as he was caUed from this tenure, had feoffment here, for there was sometime a Charter whereby the Chevalier Hugh de Lacy fixed the service due from William de Wotton on Wotton and Onebury, viz. he was to hold both Manors by service of half a knight's-fee in the Host,"], [40, "16 STANTON LACY. and in Castle-guard (en le hoste et garde) ; and if the Chief or Lord Paramount levied any aid on his Knights, then the said William aud his heirs were to pay in proportion to three-fourths of a fee.43 In 1176 William de Wudeton was amerced four merks for the non appearance of his Brother in some Lawsuit,44 he having been his Surety I suppose. This William de Wudeton has, I think, already occurred to us under Higley,46 but without his Christian name. I take him to have been the husband of that Cecilia de Hugley whose posterity by him shared in the Manor of Higley. He is also the person who between 1179 and 1189 has occurred in a testing clause (given under Willey), and in a position which marks his high stand ing among the Knights of the County.46 When I come to speak of Coolmere near EUesmere, I shall show that this WUliam de Wude ton had an interest there, and that his predecessor in such interest was Hugh de Lacy of Coolmere, but who the said Hugh de Lacy was I will not here inquire. If William were the name of C'ecUia de Hugley's husband, as above suggested, it is not easy to distinguish this WUliam de Wude ton from his son of the same name ; but it seems to be the Son who was entrusted, for some cause or other, with the custody of Mochtre Forest by Hugh de Lacy of Ewyas. The latter Baron died in 1185, before which date therefore Cecilia de Hugley's son will have been of age. William de Wudeton, son of Cecilia de Hugley, is in one instance described as a Clerk.47 He was however lawfully married, and the Father, as we shall see, of Robert de Wudeton. In 1198 the Staffordshire Pipe-Roll exhibits William cle Wudeton as fining three merks to have a writ of right against John de Kilpec for one Knight's-fee in Nordbiri. Norbury, Staffordshire, was a Manor of Lacy's Seigneury, and was afterwards held by KUpec's heirs under Lacy, so that Wudeton's claim would appear to have been unsuc cessful. At the Shropshire Assizes of October 1203, William de Wodcton essoigned his attendance, his Essoigner being Henry Des penser. In Michaelmas Term 1207 William de Wodeton was im pleaded by Walter de Lacy, \" for that he had made waste of Moketree Forest, at the time when he was Custos thereof by appointment of Hugh de Lacy, Walter's Father.\" The Defendant asked that View should be had of the premises, which the Court granted.48 Robert 43 Additional MSS.

Of Robert de Wudeton, the Son of William de Wudeton, Clerk, I have given many particulars under Higley. He came to occupy a prominent position in Shropshire. A Patent of July 29, 1232, ap points him and others as special Justiciars to try Richard de Leghe, then lying in Salop Gaol on a charge of Larceny. In June 1233, another Patent names him as one of the Collectors of the tax of the Fifteenth then being levied ; and in November 123 1 he was a Justice for delivery of Salop Gaol. In or about 1240, Robert de Wodeton is duly entered as holding haff a Knight's-fee in Wodeton, under Walter de Lacy.49 He appears, as I have shown under Higley, to have died shortly before November 1246. I think that he left a Widow Agnes, who remarried to Peter de Lacy, and a daughter and sole heir Amicia, who became the wife of Robert de Lacy ; for I can by no other supposition reconcile all that has been said under Lower Millichope and Higley about this succession, with what I have now further to relate. In 1250 Robert de Lascy is amerced 20*. for unjust detention. In 1251 uPr\u00e6stitum or Loan of 50 merks is charged against him as due to the Crown. In 1255 among those who being Tenants in Stanton Lacy owed service at Ludlow Castle, Sir Robert de Lacy is said to hold half a fee in Wodeton, and 20*. rent in Onibury and Walton, and a fourth-part of a Knight's-fee in Donton (Downton HaU) by such service.50 At the Assizes of January 1256, in consequence of some litigation not detailed, a day for receiving their Chyrograph was given to Robert de Lacy, Plaintiff, and to Peter de Lacy, concerning lands which said Peter with Agnes his wife held as dower of Agnes in the inheritance of Amicia, wife of Robert.51 The day given was in the Quinzaine of Easter ; but the Chyrograph, or Fine levied, does not bear date tiU the octaves of Michaelmas 1256.

Robert and Amice now renounced all claim on the whole \u00a380. ; for which Peter and Agnes demised and con ceded to Robert and Amice all lands in Shropshire which were of Agnes's dower and of Amice's inheritance on the day of Concord ; \u2014 to hold to Robert and Amice and the heirs of Amice.52 At the Forest Assizes of 1262, Sir Robert de Lacy, Knight, was amerced 20*. for some default. At the General Assizes of 1267, Robert de Lacy was found not to have disseized Richard Bacun of a right of common in Wutton, which the latter claimed as appur tenant to his tenement in Shelderton.53 In September 1272, Robert de Lacy's Widow, Amicia, was again impleaded, for that her late husband had disseized Roger le Oyselur and Richard Bacun of a right of common similar to the above. Amicia docs not appear to have pleaded the previous settlement of the case in regard to one Plaintiff, but some general right of her own. This occasioned the Court to give the Plaintiffs leave to withdraw their Writ.54 In August 127 1, Robert de Lacy was deceased, and as I have said under Higley, his Widow, calling herself daughter of Robert, former Lord of Wodetone, sold her share of Higley to Sir Roger de Mortimer. In 1274 Amicia was seized of Wootton; for the Jurors of the Liberty of Staunton Lacy (in reply to a query as to any recent ap propriations or excesses of free-chace aud warren) stated that the Lady of Wodeton had Warren and Free-chace, but dared not exer cise her right as her Ancestors had done, because of Sir Roger de Mortimer and his men.55 In Easter Term 1277, Walter de Hopton (if I understand the Record) released to Thomas de Grete, and Amicia, his wife, all right of common which he had claimed in Wo dinton as appurtenant to his lands in Shelderton. At the same time the said Walter withdrew a charge of disseizin which he had alleged against the same Thomas and Amicia about 500 acres of Bosc. The parties accorded ; and a perambulation of the boundaries of their re spective estates was entered on the Rolls.56 Walter de Hopton thus occuring was of Hopton, near Clungunford, whUe Amicia, wife of Thomas de Grete, was the Widow of Robert de Lacy.

Not long after this, Robert de Lacy's heir, whose name was Gilbert, will probably have died without issue ; for the ostensible heirs of Amicia de Wodeton were her children by Thomas de Grete, whose names were Roger, Matilda, and Agnes. In 1291, or earlier, Philip Burnel had acquired the two Manors of Wootton and Lower MiUichope from their former Lords ; for his Charter of Free Warren, dated in that year, extends to both Manors.57 The Fine has been already quoted by which in June 1293, Amice, then the wife of William de Schippeye, concurred with her third husband and her second husband's son, iu formally conveying Wootton and Milichope, and also Onibury aud Walton to Philip Burnel.58 DOWNTON now DOWNTON HALL. This member of Staunton Lacy was held under the Baronial Lords of that Manor, in 1255, by the same Robert de Lacy whom I have spoken of as their Tenaut at Wootton.59 The ancient names of this estate were Donton and Donington Lacy; and Robert de Lacy's tenure was by service of a fourth part of a Kuight's-fee. Doubtless he acquired this estate, like Wootton, with his wife. It was one of those Fees which were reputed to be appurtenant to Ludlow Castle. In August 1259 I find William de Devises taking out a writ of novel disseizin against Robert de Lacy for a tenement in Birche (The Birches near Downton). I have already spoken of Robert de Lacy's alleged disloyalty in 1265, his forfeiture of Dunton, and his attempt to recover the same in 1267, against William de Hug ford.60 A fine of one merk proffered by Robert de Lacy in 1267 for a writ of Pone was probably connected with some further attempt to regain this estate. In Michaelmas Term 1268 he seems to have succeeded ; though the composition which he then effected seems to have been with the Prior of Wenlock, to whom Hugford had pro bably conveyed his interest in Dunton. The Record represents Robert de Lacy and Amicia his wife as giving 20*. for license to accord with the said Prior. Their agreement was a formal quit claim by the Prior to certain lands and tenements in Duuton, for 57 Dugdale's Baronage, II, 61. 58 Supra, Vol. IV, p. 3. 59 Rot. Hundred.

Another writ on the same subject issued in May 1272, where Geoffrey de Genevill and others are the Defendants, and the premises described to be in Dorington Lacy. This suit probably concerned only a part of the Manor; for, whether as a guardian or otherwise, I think that in 1271 Walter or William de Fenes held Downton as a whole under Genevill ; and the interest of Robert de Lacy's Widow does not appear. In October 1271, Walter de Fenes is sued for disseizing John de Middleton of a right of com mon in Middleton. In October 1272, however, William62 de Fenes sued William de Hugford for disseizing him of common pasture in Middleton, which pertained to said William de Fenes's tenement in Dunton. \u2014 Hugford gained a verdict.63 The Feodary of 1284 gives Gilbert de Lacy, whom I take to have been son and heir of Robert de Lacy, as holding the vill of Dounton under Peter de Genevill for one-fifth of a knight's-fee. LOWER HAYTON. This member of Stanton Lacy was one of the many estates which were held under Lacy by the great Herefordshire family of Deve reux. Dugdale, at the commencement of his account of this family, assigns to it a Norman origin, viz. from the notable town of Evreux. He also mentions one or two instances of the name occurrins: in o England in the twelfth and beginning of the thirteenth centuries.64 These hints (for the great Genealogist intended them as nothing more) have been unwisely embodied by later Authors into a con nected Pedigree.65 The result, as might be expected, is a tissue of falsehood. If we take the Manors held by Devereux under Lacy in the thir- teenth century, and then refer back to their Domesday status, we shall find that no two of them were common to the same Domes day Tenant.

The earliest mention of the name in Herefordshire occurs under the following circumstances. \u2014 Walter de Lacy who died in 1085 (the year before Domesday) gave certain land at Hide in Herefordshire in marriage with a Lady named Helewise, who was perhaps the Baron's kinswoman. In 1086 Tezelinus was Roger de Lacy's Tenant at Hide.66 If we are em powered to conclude anything from this, it is that Tezelinus was the husband of Helewise. However, between the years 1113 and 1130, Helewise, as the Widow of William de Ebrois, gave land at Hide to Gloucester Abbey.67 Nothing foUows from this but that William Devereux, deceased in 1130, was perhaps the second husband of Helewise, Lady of Hide. Nevertheless, till some one more probable be suggested, we may assume this WUliam to have been Ancestor, or akin to the Ancestor, of the Devereuxes of Herefordshire. In 1165 there were two branches of this famUy, each holding under Lacy and each holding by old feoffment ; that is, they or their Ancestors had been enfeoffed earlier than 1135. In 1165 Roger de Ebroicis, who I think was the Ancestor of the line afterwards ennobled, held four fees of Hugh de Lacy, whilst Walter de Ebroicis held three fees.68 In succession to Roger came Stephen Devereux; but whether as Roger's son I cannot say. The mother of Stephen Devereux was a sister of Stephen de Longehamp. The latter having been enfeoffed by Walter de Lacy in the Vill of Frome Herbert, Herefordshire, had King John's Confirmation of the gift, bearing date March 11, 1201 ;69 but afterwards he sub-enfeoffed his Nephew Stephen Deve reux in the same ; and this transfer was confirmed by King John on July 26, 1205.70 For other particulars about Stephen Devereux, not connecting him with Shropshire, I refer elsewhere.71 That which is less known of him is that he married IsabeUa daughter of the first William de Cantilupe, and died shortly before March 17, 1228, leaving his heirs in minority.72 His wife remarried to Ralph de Pembruge, and so appears in various documents under three diffe rent names, being caUed by the name of each of her husbands, whUe she herself, granting apparently in her second widowhood, reassumes her maiden name of Cantilupe.73 William Devereux, eldest son and heir of Stephen, was apparently of age in 1240, when he confirmed 66 Domesday, so. 184, b, 1. 6' Monasticon, I, p. 547, b. 63 Liber Niger, I, 154. m \u2022 7\u00ab Rot.

The caput of this fief was the Castle of LonhaUes or Lenhalles, called also Lenshall or Leonshall. It was near to Weobley, and, as we are told, came to Devereux by marriage with the heir-general of Marburge.16 Another authority intimates that William Devereux's tenure under Lacy was by service of 4\\ knights'-fees. The cotem- porary Tenure of Cecilia Devereux and her son Nicholas was less ; and they, I take it, represented the second branch of this family ; Nicholas being the lineal descendant of Walter Devereux Uving in 1165. I have before aUuded to the interest which Sir WUliam Devereux, his Widow MatUda, and his son WUliam, had in the con- cerns of the Shropshire family of Beysin.77 I have also said how Sir William Devereux (I) fell on the rebel side at Evesham in 1265. His Widow Matilda was Sister of Walter Giffard, Bishop of Bath and Wells. She had an independent interest in Nether Heyton, for her husband, and she had purchased from Roger Tyrel two merks rent there. This rent MatUda afterwards conveyed to Elyas de Sutton, of whom we shall hear more in the sequel. The Feodary of 1284 gives William Devereux (II) as holding the Vill of Lower Heyton of the Barony of Peter de GeneviU by half a knight's- fee. A Fine levied at Westminster on October 6, 1285, is a curious and instructive document. It is between Bishop Robert BurneU, Plaintiff, and William Devereux, Deforciant, of one Mill, 5 acres of meadow, and 24 merks rent in Heydon ; which premises were now- held for life by Matilda Devereux and Walter de la Barre. William Devereux now concedes that the reversion of the two moieties held by Matilda and Walter shall go to the Bishop and his heirs, after the respective deaths of the said Matilda and Walter, when such re- version would otherwise pertain to WUliam himself. The Bishop is to hold the whole at a penny rent under WUliam and his Heirs. He is said to give a sore sparrow-hawk for the grant. Clauses ap pended to this Fine indicate the professional caution of the great Chancellor who was a party thereto. \u2014 Walter de la Barre came 74 Monasticon, VI, 400, Num. iii.

Also Matilda came into Court and declared that she claimed nothing in the premises save as her dower, except indeed two merks rent, which she and her husband had formerly bought from Roger Tyrel, and which she and her heirs were to hold under said Roger and his heirs for ever.78 These two merks I presume were not conveyed by the Fine. An inquest of October 12, 1299, declared that Elias de Sutton might without prejudice to the King or any other, assign two merks rent in Heyton to the Prioress and Convent of Acornbury. He held the same rent under John Devereux by a chief-rent of 6d.; and for this and all other services his remaining Estate was amply suffi cient.79 In pursuance of this design Elyas de Sutton conveys by deed to the Church of St. Cross of Acornbury two merks rent in the Vill of Heytone Inferior, which he had by gift of Dame Matilda Devereux. The said rents were chargeable thus \u2014 viz. 22*. on a virgate held by WiUiam Haumon, and 4*. 8d. on the tenement of Riehard fitz Robert.

At all events she then gave or had already given the land on which the said rent arose, to the Nuns of Acornbury. This is proved by another Deed, in which we again observe how the yet unexplained connection between the houses of Devereux and Beysin held good in the case of Lower Heyton. \u2014 Between the years 1311 and 1319 \" Thomas de Beiseyn quit-claimed to Katherine de Genville,81 Prioress, and her Convent of Acornbury, all his right in two merks rent arising from lands in Nethere Heytone, which lands William de Hauman and Richard fitz Robert held of the Prioress, who had them by gift of Matilda de Ebroycis.\"82 73 Pedes Finium, 13 Edw.

In or about 1240 this member of Stanton Lacy was held under Walter de Lacy by service of half a knight's-fee. The heirs of Michael de Kriketot or Kirketot were the Tenants.84 In 1265, John, as son and heir of Michael de Criketot, was suing the Prioress of Brewood under writ of mort d'ancestre, for a rent in Heyton. In Hilary Term 1283, John son of Osbert de Westhop, Agnes his wife, and Alice, Agnes's sister, Deforciants, quit-claim for themselves and the heirs of Agnes and Alice, by Fine aud for 100*. two messuages and a virgate in Over Horton (sic) to William de Stepelton, Plaintiff. In 1284 we have WiUiam de Stepleton as Pe- ter de Genevill's Tenant of half a knight's-fee in Upper Heyton,85 but by what descent from Criketot I do not know. Again in March 1317 Robert Brown was Tenant of Theobald de Verdon deceased, at Overheyton. It was half a knight's-fee, and extended at 40*. per annum.86 The Undertenants of Upper Hayton cannot always be distin guished from those of Lower Hayton.

John de la Pole however called John Pyrun to warranty, who said that he inherited the premises from Walter Pyrun his Father who died seized thereof. The Court ordered an Inquisition to be had on the matter, but the parties accorded. Their Fine was that John le Cruther and AUce renounced all claim to John Pyrun for 2\\ merks.89 In 1284 Walter Pirun held this vill under Peter de Genevill for a fourth part of a knight's-fee.90 Aks, now Rock. \u2014 This member of Stanton Lacy is described in old writings by the name \" Aks,\" usually supposed to be equivalent to \" Oaks.\" The old name is now lost, but the Vill is identical with the present township of Rock.91 I find that before the year 1240 Nicholas fitz Peter of London, * * * Malore, and another tenant of Walter de Lacy in the vill of Akes, sold their interest there to Peter Undergod of Ludlow. The latter was founder of St. John's Hospital at Ludlow, aud he gave all his land of Akes thereto, Wal ter de Lacy, the Chief-Lord, confirming. It appears that beside the land thus conveyed Peter Undergod was entitled to all amercia ments assessed on his Under-tenants at Akes in the manorial Court of Stanton Lacy. These profits he similarly gave to St. John's Hospital.93 In 1255 Akes or Hokes was thus held. \u2014 The Brethren of Ludlow Hospital had eight virgates there ; said to be \" of the eleemosynary grant of Walter de Lacy,\" which was not quite the whole truth. Roger de Stanton held one virgate there, the rent of which, viz. 8*., was payable to Dame Margery de Lacy as part of her dower. An other rent of 5*. was payable by the same Roger for an assart and a pasture called the Old Vivary, both probably in Akes, and the said rent being also part of Margery de Lacy's dower. Further the Villate or community of Akes seems to have rented another pasture in the 88 Rot. Hundred. II, pp. 69, 80. 89 Assizes, 40 Hen.

In 1534-5 St. John's Hospital at Ludlow was in receipt of \u00a37. 2*. 2d., the rents and ferms of its estate at Rocke.9* Wigley \u2014 was another member of Stanton Lacy. Here in 1255 Robert Dovile held two virgates of land, his sendee being to guard the Keep of Ludlow Castle for fifteen days in war-time. For twelve acres of land, which he also held here, he paid 2*. per annum to Dame Margery de Lacy as part of her dower.95 In 1272 and 1292 Robert DoviU sat as a Juror for Stanton Liberty at the County Assizes. In March 1317 the Inquest on the death of Theobald de Verdon gives Robert son of Robert Dovyle as holding a fourth part of a knight's-fee in Wyggele of the deceased. Its value was 20*.96 There was also a family which took name from this place ; e. g. John de Wygele, on a Ludlow Inquest in 1284, and a Juror for Munslow Hundred at the Assizes of 1292 ; \u2014 also Roger de Wyggeleye a Juror for Stanton Liberty at the latter Assizes. &ITu3m This was another Manor held by Roger cle Laci immediately of the King.

Aldon seems to have been granted by the Lord thereof to some new Feoffee, either in the reign of Ste phen or Henry II ; so that I suppose the Domesday Tenancies of Richard and \u00c6ldred to have lapsed. Among the Fees of new feoff ment returned by Hugh de Lacy in 1165 is this entry; \u2014 Feod. de Cauledon dim. milit. ;2 that is, the Fee or Fees of Aldon (as I sup pose) owed the service of half a knight's-fee to Lacy. This unusual mode of expressing the tenure may possibly have been caused by the Manor being already held by Coheirs ; a state in which it always occurs in the next century. On this coheirship I shall not here make any comment, but give the few facts which I have collected, and which require further evidence to show the mode of descent satis factorily. At the Assizes of 1221 Thomas de la Le (one of these coheirs as I think) was found to have disseized Hugh Senesot of 6 acres in Euledon. The damages were 10*.3 In or about 1240 Roger le Poer and his Coparceners are said to hold half a knight's-fee in Euledon, or Culedon, of Walter de Lacy.4 In 1255 the Coparceners named are Thomas de Le, Stephen de Smethcot, Thomas Purcel, Richard de Thongland, and John, Parson of Bissopeston. They are said to hold Lower and Higher Guledon and Weho (now Yeo) of Walter de Lacy's heir, for two and a half hides of land (the Domes day measurement) . They did suit to Munslow Hundred, aud paid the King 2*. 6d. for Stretward and Moffee? It would seem, from a note to this entry, that these Coparceners had withdrawn some suit of 6d. value ; for the Tenants of Over and Nether Guidon are said to appear (at the Inquest), and to answer concerning 6d. withdrawn. I should notice for future reference that at this time Stephen de Smethcot and Thomas Purcel were Coparceners in the Manor of Acton Scott, also Philip de Smethcot and Thomas Purcel were Co parceners**in Smethcot. In Trinity Term 1263 Philip de Thongland sued Thomas de Grete for a carucate in Eweledon as his right.

These were John Purcel, John de Lee, Reginald Scot with his wife Isabella, and Gilbert de Lacy with his wife Agnes. ALDON CHAPEL. Though Aldon had a Church and a Priest at Domesday, it is cer tain that that Church was afterwards transferred to Stokesay. We have had one similar case before, viz. where the Domesday Church of Patton was transferred to Long Stanton.7 Instances of this are however very rare ; and it is remarkable that in both the present cases the transfer took place in Lacy's Fief. We must date the change early in the twelfth century,- \u2014 that period which is illus trated by so few ecclesiastical Records. We know that in Bishop Betun's time the principle that every congregation required a Church was acted upon in his Diocese. Tins led to the building of affiliated Chapels in most instances ; but in cases like Aldon and Patton, where the original caput of a Parish had perhaps become less populous than one of the members, there is no difficulty in seeing that the natural course was to transfer the Mother Church itself to the greater Vill, and leave the Chapel to the lesser. That a Chapel or Chantry, with some land attached, remained at Aldon, I now proceed to show. In 1317, Sir Walter de Greneburg, Perpetual Vicar of Stokesay, was at issue with William de Davyntre and nine other Parishioners of Stokesay, resident in Aldon, about the Vicar's liabUity to main tain a Chantry in Aldon Chapel, situated within the limits of his Vicarage. The case seems to have been adjudicated upon by a Com mission appointed by Adam de Orleton, then Bishop of Hereford ; \u2014 and Nicholas, Abbot of Haghmon, Master Robert de Preston, Rector of Fitz, and Sir Walter, Perpetual Vicar of Bucknell, cer tified the following ordinance of the Commission, viz. that the Vicar of Stokesay should provide a Chaplain to celebrate Mass three days in a week (Sundays, Wednesdays, and Fridays) in Aldon Chapel, except on certain Feast-days. All Churchings, marriages, and con fessions were to be at the Mother Church of Stokesay. This Ordi nance was dated in the said Mother Church on June 18, 1317, in presence of John de Butterley, John de Routon, William de Smethe cote, and Thomas de Wolstanton, Chaplain. It appears by another document in the Haughmond Chartularv that the Money received at these Masses, and half a virgate and 7 Vide supra, Vol. IV, p. 39."], [53, "29 STOKESAY. nine acres of land, were deemed to be anciently appurtenant to Aldon Chapel. However on Sept. 1, 1414, we find the Abbot of Haughmond seized of this very quantity of land in Upper Aldon, and granting or rather renewing a lease thereof to a Tenant for life at a rent of 6*. 8d. ; except a grange and a plot of ground which were retained by the Abbey.8 Hence she Ministers' Accounts of 1541-2 give among the Assets of the late Monastery a rent of 6*. 8d. arising from a Tenement in Aldon.9 The Chapel had probably at this period been long disused, even if such a building existed. The Vicar of Stokesay would, according to the spirit of the times, be glad to be released from his obligation to maintain a Chaplain, while the Abbot of Haughmond was equally content to appropriate the Chapel glebe. We have a fact relating to this Manor anterior to Domesday, but not, as in the case of Stanton Lacy, -memorialized in that Re cord. Walter de Lacy endowing his Foundation of St. Peter's at Hereford, gave thereto a Villain at Stoke in Shropshire, and also two-thirds of the tithes of the said Vill.1 Domesday speaks of this Manor as held by Roger de Laci (son of Walter) of the King in capite. \u2014 \" The same Roger holdeth Stoches. \u00c6ldred held it (in Saxon times), and was a free man.

Within thirty years of Domesday Roger de Lacy or his brother Hugh enfeoffed the Says in three of their Shropshire Manors, viz. in Wheathill, already noticed, in Stoke, afterwards caUed South- Stoke or Stokesay, and in Stoke, afterwards called North Stoke or Stoke upon Tern. The first of these Says of whom I find mention was Theodoric de Say, living in the time of Henry I. This Theo doric has been represented as Ancestor of the Says of Richard's Castle. I have seen no proof, and can imagine no probabiUty for such a descent. It is inconsistent with every known fact. I shall have more to tell of Theodoric de Say under Stoke upon Tern. I take him to have been a Cadet of the Baronial house whose Ancestor, Picot de Sai, was Domesday Lord of Clun. My reason for thinking this is, that the successor (probably the son) of Theodoric de Say was named Helias, and the cotemporary Baron of Clun was also named Helias. The position and descendants of these two cotemporaries were however very different. We have seen one Helias de Sai, accompanied by other Tenants in Lacy's Fief, attesting Philip de Belmeis' grant to the Buildwas Abbey in 1138 or 1139.3 His position in the testing-clause indicates Helias de Sai of Stokesay rather than HeUas de Sai of Clun; for the latter would certainly have preceded Philip fitz Odo. An inferior witness of the same Charter is Hugh de Sai ; and of this name I think there were also two Cotemporaries, viz. the eldest son of Helias de Sai of Stokesay, and the Brother of Osbern fitz Hugh of Richard's Castle. The witness of Belmeis' charter was, I imagine, the Son of Helias de Sai. The same Hugh de Say, not however preceded by his pre sumed Father Helias, stands sixth witness of another charter of Philip de Belmeis, which I have set forth elsewhere and dated as between 1139 and 1145.4 It is not usual to find a son thus attest ing at least twenty years before his Father's death ; for, as I shall presently show, Helias de Say of Stokesay was living in 1165. However I find that any other supposition as to the identity of these witnesses will involve us in more anomalies than the single one, which disturbs but does not controvert the above calculation. In 1165 Hugh de Lacy returning a statement ofthe Knights' fees of his Barony, intimates that \" Helyas de Sai acknowledges a tenure by service of three Knights'-fees, but denied a further ser vice of two Knights'-fees; nor could Hugh de Lacy obtaiu the 3 Supra, Vol. II, p. 203. | 4 Supra, Vol. II, p. 205."], [55, "31 STOKESAY. latter service until the question was settled by due process of law.\"5 It will appear that the service of five knights thus expected by the Lord, and the service of three, acknowledged by the Vassal, became eventually a service of four, probably by compromise. All that I have further to relate of Helyas de Say is, that Pope Alexander's Bull of May 1172 mentions a grant of his to Haughmond Abbey, aud the assent thereto of Hugh his son. The particulars of the said grant belong to another locality. The name of Helyas de Say's wife was Egeline. Hugh de Say probably succeeded his father very soon after 1165. About the year 1174 he gave Stokesay Church to Haughmond Abbey. His deed, making mention of his Father Helias and his Mother Egeline, was confirmed by Hugh de Lacy (who died in 1185) as Seignoral Lord. I have given, under Wheathill, a Charter by this Hugh de Say which is attested by his wife Olympias.6 The latest that I find of him is his essoigning his appearance in a law suit at Westminster on November 12, 1194,7 at which period his age was probably very great. The son and successor of Hugh de Say was a second HeUas de Say ; and I imagine Hugh's death to have taken place about the end of 1194. There are two Charters which evidently passed in a full County Court of Shropshire. One of them must have been executed early in 1195, the other either in 1195 or 1196, and both have the attestation of Helias de Sai in a prominent position.8 A Fine of September 1199 places Helias de Sai's previous succession beyond all doubt. It was to settle the dower of his Mother Olym pias, Widow of Hugh de Sai, in Southstoke, Northstoke and Mor ton (now Morton Say) . All that I need here say of the particulars is, that Olympias relinquished her claim in respect of South-Stoke. Helias de Say confirmed his Father's grant of Stokesay Church to Haughmond.9 I have before aUuded to certain Irish interests which were common to Herbert de Rushbury and Helias de Say in the year 1200.10 The following Deed again connects these two Tenants of Lacy. \u2014 \" Elias de Say, with consent of his wife Anisia, gives to Andrew fitz MUo of Ludlow, for his homage and service, and for 23 merks the MiU of Stokes and Wetelington, with suit of ' Liber Niger, I, 154. 6 Supra, Vol. IV, p. 288.

This last Deed passed between 1216 to 1224, and is tested by John fitz Alan, John le Strange, and Robert Corbet (of Caus) .\" Before 1224 HeUas de Say was dead. The Haughmond Char tulary preserves a Deed whereby he gave, with his body in burial, a merk rent to that House. It also preserves a part of his WUl, in which, calling himself Elias de Say of Stoke, he commends his soul to God, his body to the Church of Haghmon, and together with his body gives the merk rent above mentioned, and also six oxen and one horse from Southstoke, and ten quarters (summas) of rye (Segle) growing on the ground at Northstoke, and ten quarters of oats in the barn of Southstoke.12 I infer that Helias de Say (II) died without issue ; for his Suc cessor was his Brother Robert, who was apparently a Clerk in Holy Orders. Robert cle Say confirmed his brother Helias' grant of Stoke and WetUngton MiU to Haughmond ; Walter de Lacy attesting his confirmation. He also confirmed the merk rent above mentioned in a deed which, being attested by Baldwin de Hodnet and Stephen his brother, must have passed before 1225, when the said Baldwin was dead.13 Robert de Say, previous to his succession, comes more than once under notice. At the County Assizes of October 1203 he was amerced half a merk, as was Richard de Stirchley, for some false averment or verdict. This juxtaposition of the two names reminds us of a testing clause of about that period, where Richard de Stirgle is followed by Robert de Say.14 Other testing-clauses in 11 Chartulary, ut supra. Esq., of Adderley. I shall recur to this curious document under Stoke-upon-Tern. 12 The original Will, or rather an ex tract therefrom (but written in a coeval hand, and having sometime had its own seal) is in possession of Richard Corbet 13 Chartulary, ut supra. 14 Vol. II, p. 124, note 65,"], [57, "33 STOKESAY. which Robert de Say occurs I need not quote, as they do not enable me further to determine the period of his succession, or the time during which he held the estates of his family. His death, without issue, is indicated by the fact that he was succeeded by a third bro ther, Walter.- \u2014 Walter de Say, in or about the year 1240, was holding four knights'-fees under Walter de Lacy.15 These Fees may be thus divided, viz. Stoke upon Tern and Moreton Say \u2014 1 fee ; Wheathill \u2014 1 fee ; Stokesay and its members \u2014 2 fees. Walter de Say was a Benefactor to Haughmond Abbey. Styling himself Lord of Stoke, he gave \" for the souls of himself and Amicia his wife, the whole Moor called Pencheres-medowe, as the bank of the Onie surrounded the said Moor under the Mill of Stokes and Wetlington, which Mill, Elias his brother gave to the Abbey. Witnesses, \u2014 Sir Thomas de la Lee, Hugh de Cheyne, Henry Mile. By another Deed, Walter de Say, caUing himself son of Hugh de Say, gave with his body, and for the souls of himself and Amicia his wife, half a merk rent of an assart in Stokesay Wood, viz. in Marlebeche. Witnesses, \u2014 Adam, Vicar of Stoke, Robert de Lacy. In the Quitizaine of Easter 1250 a very important Fine was levied, at Westminster, after a conventional Suit. The Fine is between Hugh de Sey, Plaintiff, and Walter de Sey, Deforciant, \u2014 of the Manors of Suthstok and Northstok. Walter acknowledged the right of Hugh, who regranted the Manors to Walter for life, \u2014 to hold at a rent of Id., and by performance of all capital services. Remainder was covenanted to Hugh and his heirs ; and Walter undertook not to alienate the premises.16 For license to levy this Fine, Hugh de Sai paid the large sum of 100*.16 Hugh de Say, thus named, became in due course the Successor to Walter, and was I presume his nephew, Son of his brother Hugh. The life-tenure of Walter de Say, coupled with the remaindership of his Nephew Hugh, are curiously illustrated by two deeds in the Haughmond Chartulary, which will have passed between 1250 and 1255. By the first, Walter de Say gives to the Abbey half a merk rent in Watlington, arising from a virgate of land held by Philip, Rector of Wistanstow. By the second, Hugh de Say, son of Hugh de Say, confirmed what Walter de Say his Uncle gave, and he him self gives out-and-out the virgate from which the rent arose. These deeds were coeval, being attested by the same witnesses (Robert de 15 Testa de Nevill, pp. 45, 48, 50. 16 Pedes Finium, and Rot. Pip. 34 Hen. Ill, Salop. Flacita, Easter Term, 34 Hen.

There is good reason to think that Stokesay was a part of this exchange, which must have taken place between 1250 and 1255. In the latter year Hugh de Say was unquestionably living ; for WheathUl is said to be held under him ;19 but Robert de Say, son of Hugh, held Moreton Say immediately of John de Verdon, whUst John de Verdon was Lord of the fee-simple of Stoke upon Tern and Stokesay. It is probable then that Hugh de Say, having aUenated aU or nearly all his Shrop shire Estates, had settled in Ireland. In the year 1256 I find Olimpias de WaUington (Wettleton) naming her Attorney in a suit against Hugh de Say.20 This proves that Hugh de Say was living, not that he was still seized of Stokesay ; for OUmpias, probably his relation and former Feoffee, may have had some claim upon him, which in the wholesale exchange with John de Verdon had not been respected. I hear nothing more of Hugh de Say or his descendants in connection with Stokesay, but shaU have to speak of them else where. I now return to John de Verdon, whom the Inquisition of 1255 duly registers as Lord of Stoke Say, Wetliton, and Neuton. He is said to hold the Manor of the Hen of Walter de Lacy, that is, he, a Coheir of Lacy, held it of the general estate of Lacy, of winch full partition was not as yet made. It was 5 hides ; that is, two hides less than its Domesday measurement. It did suit to Munslow Hun dred, and paid 5*. annually for Stretward and Motfee.21 Other parts of the same Record speak of Stokesay as held by two knights' fees, aud as pertaining to Ludlow Castle.31 Whatever were its ser vices due at Ludlow, it also owed the services of one knight in ward of Montgomery Castle in time of war for forty days.21 This last \" Chartulary : Tit.

A Deed, which I am now going to set forth, shows that in 1270 John de Verdon had ensured to one Philip de Whichecote 8 merks rent, arising annually from Ludlow MUls ; and a further salary of \u00a35. per annum in compensation of the acceptable services of the said Philip, who was .probably a Civilian. On September 1, 1270, Sir John cle Verdon conveys to the said PhUip his Manor of Stoke say for a term of three years, in return for \u00a324. paid by Philip to the Grantor. The Manor was valued at 40 merks (\u00a326. 13*. 4d.) per annum ; but the considerations which induced Sir John de Verdon to borrow money at so extravagant a cost do not appear. \u2014 The term of three years being ended, Philip was to hold the Manor for the further term of his own life, but at the full rent of 40 merks ; that is, he was to pay 24^ merks yearly to John de Ver don at Weobley, and the balance of 15| merks he was to retain as equivalent to John de Verdon's annuities (8 merks and \u00a35) due to himself on the other accounts above mentioned. During this se cond term the Wardships and Escheats of the Free Tenants in the Manor were reserved to John de Verdon, but the rents were to be Philip's. Verdon reserved a power of re-entry, in case Whichecote faded to pay the rent at stated times. On the Manor reverting to Verdon (i. e. on Whichecote's death) there were to be left thereon two waggon-loads of hay, twelve waggon -loads of forage, and a number of implements (utensilia) said to be specified in a schedule (cyrographo) . The Deed was sealed in duplicate by either party, and copies thereof exchanged.23 Inquisitions on the death of John de Verdon were ordered by Writ of October 17, 1274. One, purporting to be held at Stok Say, met on November 7, foUowing ; but it is clear from the return of the Jury, that, by the place here called Stok Say, Stoke upon Tern was meant.33 The Inquests on the death of John de Verdon say in fact no thing about Stokesay proper; probably because at the time of his death he held nothing in demesne there.

John de Verdon's Feoffee at Stokesay at the time of his death, was not PhiUp de Whichecote, as we should have expected, but Reginald de Grey (of Wilton, I presume). The Inquest of Munslow Hundred, held on November 26, 1274, tells how \" John de Verdon had withdrawn the Suit of the vill of Stok Sey from that Hundred, whereas all the free men and four Jurors with a Provost had been previously used to do the said Suit twice a year at the Sheriff's Great-Tourn.\"2* The Jurors added that Reginald de Grey now held the said Manor in the same way, i. e. without doing the Suit aforesaid. How Reginald de Grey came to be Verdon's Tenant in Stokesay I cannot discover. Soon after this the said Reginald (presumptively of Wilton) seems to have conveyed his interest in Stokesay to his son John ; which John however did not generally succeed his Father till the death of the latter in 1308, \u2014 when the said John was declared by one out of several Inquests to be 50 years of age.35 \u2014 I am particular in stating this because it shows John de Grey to have been of full age in 1279, and so capable of the feoffment above suggested. It is certain too that John de Grey, thus or otherwise seized of Stokesay, conveyed the whole to Laurence de Ludlow, in or before the year 1281. The sale, for such undoubtedly it was, is indicated by a Fine dated Jan. 18, 1281, and levied between Lau rence de Ludlowe, Plaintiff, and John de Grey and Matilda his wife, Impedients, of theManor of Stokesay, whereof was Plea of Warranty of Charter.

A Royal Charter of 1281 shows Laurence de Lud low in full possession of Stokesay.26 It gives him the privilege of Free- Warren in his demesnes of Stokesay, Neuton, and Wetlinton. In \" July 1281,\" or more probably 1282 (for the date given in the Deed involves some error) , Laurence de Ludlowe, Lord of Stokesay, came to an agreement with Henry, Abbot of Haughmond, concern ing previous disputes.

I (1290-1), Laurence de Ludlow obtained a license to strengthen his mansion with a wall of stone and lime, and to crenel late, or embattle, the same.28 The result was, probably, the erection of that fortified Manor-House whose remains are now known as Stokesay Castle. At the Assizes of 1292 the Munslow Jurors presented Laurence de Ludlow as claiming a right of free-warren in Stoke Say. On January 20th, 1296, Laurence de Ludlow being dead, a Fine was levied between Agnes his Widow, and William de Ludlow (his son), Complamants, aud Peter Gilmyn of Ludlow, and Matilda his wife, Impedients, \u2014 of 48 acres of land in Stanton Lacy, whereof was Plea of Warranty.

In March 1316, the Nomina Villarum gives William de Lodelowe and Cecilia de Halghton as Lords of the Vill of Stokesay.39 On August 25 of that year, William de Ludelowe, Lord of Stokesay, settled some disputes, about quit- rents of certain tenements in this Manor, with the Abbot of Haughmond.30 On November 11, 1316, William de Ludlow being dead, an In quest states him to have held only two-thirds of Stok-Sai.

Of Undertenants in Stokesay I have already named some in cidentally, and one of them, Nicholas, son of Andrew fitz Milo, has occurred as granting here to Haughmond Abbey. At the Assizes of January 1256, this person, under the name of Nicholas Andreu, of Ludlow, was Defendant in a suit of novel disseizin for a tenement iu Stokesay. The Prosecutor, Richard de Kinere, faded to appear, so he and his Sureties, viz. Richard fitz Gilbert of Euledon (Aldon), and WUliam de Kinere of Euledon, were in misericordid.3i At these same Assizes Nicholas de Haseloure appeared against Coleman le Whyte in a plea of convention concerning thirds of se veral messuages and parcels of land in Whettlinton, Stokesay, and Stiventon. Coleman le White not appearing, the Sheriff was ordered to have his body in Court in one month of Easter.36 It would ap pear that this plea of convention was connected with a cross-suit of mort d'ancestre which was adjourned at these Assizes; Coleman le Blund making Nicholas de Haselore his Attorney therein, against Herbert de Ledewych.37 A Fine levied at Westminster in Trinity Term 1256, explains more of this matter. Nicholas de Haselour, Plaintiff, quits to Colemann le Whyte, Deforciant, a third of three messuages, a virgate, and eight acres of land, three acres of meadow, and fifty-one acres of land in Wettelyton, Stok-Say, Sete (Sheet), and * * *,38 whereof was plea of convention. In return Coleman le Whyte (having, I suppose, gained his cause against Herbert de Led wych) concedes to Nicholas de Haselour a messuage aud 20 acres in La Sete ; eleven acres of which had sometime been held by Her bert de Ledewych. Nicholas and his heirs were to hold the same under Le Whyte at \\d. rent. The heir of Coleman le Whyte above mentioned was apparently his Nephew. The latter as Coleman de Ludelawe, son of Roger Blund of Ludlaw, quit-claims to his Lord, Sir John de Verdun, aU right in 11 acres of land and 3 acres of meadow in the fields of Stoksay, which Coleman de Ludelawe, the Grantor's Uncle (avun culus) purchased of Walter de Say.

In 51 Henry III (1266-7), Peter, son of Henry le Forester, of Stokesay, has a similar writ against Hugh fitz Ranulf, and others, for a tenement in Neuton.

No Church is mentioned as existing here at the time of Domes day, but that which then existed at Aldon was, as I suppose, re moved to Stokesay soon afterwards, the latter becoming the most important place in the Parish. When Walter de Lacy endowed St. Peter's of Hereford, before Domesday, with two-thirds of the tithes of Stoke, tithes of his demesne must be understood. St. Peter's of Hereford was in 1101 subjected by Hugh de Lacy to Gloucester Abbey. Again, in Henry II's reign, Bromfield Priory was subjected to the same Abbey. Hence a small pension, which was, I suppose, originally receivable from Stoke Say Church in lieu of the tithes granted to St. Peter's of Hereford, seems to have been subsequently payable to Gloucester Abbey, and then by ap pointment of that House to Bromfield Priory. Hugh de Lacy, the Founder of Lanthony in Monmouthshire, seems also to have granted some tithes at Stokesay to that Abbey, which grant likewise came to be represented by a pension. Again, at some period whereof, in the middle of the thirteenth century, memory was not, some Lord of Stokesay granted part of the demesne tithes of Stokesay to Wenlock Priory. This right of the Priory was likewise commuted for a pension. Hugh de Say's grant of the Church of \" St. John of Suthe stokes\" to Haughmond Abbey has been already mentioned. It certainly passed between the years 1172 and 1181, and probably early in the interval. It was tested by Marescot, Master David Wal, and Gilbert Deacon of Fernlege in the Peak. Hugh de Lacy's confirmation seems to have been cotemporary. It speaks of the Church as dedicated to St. John the Baptist. It reserves the Grantor's right, as Suzerain I suppose. It is tested by Osbert fitz Hugh and William son of William fitz Alan.

Lastly it was confirmed by Pope Honorius III on Sept. 25, 1223.50 Which of the Bishops of Hereford first granted to Haughmond the Appropriation of Stokesay Church I cannot say. Such Appro priation was certainly earlier than 1248 ; for on September 29th in that year some disputes between the Prior of Wenlock and Abbot of Haughmond were settled by a Composition, of which the substance was as follows. Certain Tithes were in dispute, viz. two garbs (per acre I suppose) on the whole demesne of Suthstok de Say. These the Prior had coUected from time immemorial ; but now the Abbot, having obtained an appropriation of the Church, covenants to pay the Prior 24*. per annum in lieu of the said tithes and in the name of a. perpetual ferm?1 The Haughmond Chartulary supplies an instance of the mode in which Impropriate Rectors dealt with the Glebe of their Churches.

These items were not included in the Church-Taxation of \u00a38. which the Commissioners adopted. The reason of this fraud perhaps lies in the fact that the Abbot of Haughmond himself presided over the Inquests which determined the amount of these assessments. On April 9, 1458, a second dispute about tithes between the Prior of Wenlock and Abbot of Haughmond was settled by me diation of WiUiam Burley of Bromcroft. The Prior's pension was reduced to 9*., and some arrears (\u00a33. 6*. 8d.) were paid.55 In 1534-5 Roger WUliamson's preferment as Vicar of Stokesay was valued at \u00a34. 8*. 4c?. in tithes. Procurations and Synodals of 7s. 8d. were chargeable thereon, and the Fee of \u00a32. 13*. 36?., due triennially at the Bishop's Visitation, was equal to a further annual charge of 17*. 96?. 56 The Abbot of Haughmond's return of his Spiritualities in 1535-6 does not include this Rectory, but why I cannot understand; for Roger Wylleston (the Incumbent who is called \" Williamson\" in the Valor) had been presented by the Abbot on March 26, 1530. Also after his death and on May 8, 1543, Roger Haywarde and John Wydder (two of the Grantees of the dissolved Abbey's estates) presented to Stoke-Say Church.57 The Valor of 1535-6, I should observe, makes no mention of the pensions anciently chargeable on this Church.

Corfton, From the Manors held by Roger de Lacy in capite at Domesday, we pass to those which he held of Earl Roger de Montgomery. Of Corfton Domesday says : \u2014 \" The same Roger holds Cortune (of the Earl), and Herbert holds it of him. Alsi held it (in Saxon times). Here are m hides geldable. In demesne are n ox-teams, and there are mi Neat-herds, and mi VUlains, and i Boor, with n Teams, and other two Teams there might be. Here is a Haye for taking kids. The value of the Manor (in Saxon times) was 16*. Now it is worth 12*. per annum.\"1 The Saxon Alsi I identify with \u00c6lsi, Saxon Lord of Middlehope, and with Elsi, Saxon Lord of Charlcott.2 Herbert, Lacy's Domes day Tenant at Corfton, also held Patton, Long-Stanton, and Mid dlehope, under the same Baron. I have intimated an opniion that this Herbert was the Ancestor of De Furchis.3 The foUowing cir cumstances almost prove the fact. We can trace a subsequent Tenant-interest of De Furchis in Patton, Corfton, and Middlehope, though we lose it in the anomalous case of Long Stanton. But the Herefordshire Domesday best settles this question of descent. There 1 Domesday, so. 256, b. 2 Supra, Vol I, p. 152. :i Supra, Vol, IV, p. 52, note 1."], [71, "45 CORFTON. we find Herbert holding a hide and half in Bodeham under Roger de Lacy ;4 and in 1 243 we find that WUliam de Furchis held a hide in Bodeham of Lacy's Barony, IsabeUa de Furchis then having the same in dower.5 When distant Manors thus appear in the same name or family after the lapse of a century and half, we naturally conclude that the later Lords are descendants of the earlier. The Successor, probably the son, of Herbert seems to have been William de Furcis. He has occurred to us as attending a great Synod at Castle Holgate about 1115,6 and his Grandson, another William de Furcis, spoke of him as we have seen7 in 1205 as having in 1135 been seized of the Manor of Oxenbold. Herbert de Furcis, who has occurred to us about 1 160 in connection with Patton,8 I take to have been son of William, and Grandson of Herbert. He had ap parently a son William, of whom we hear from 1165 to 1208. In the former year Hugh de Lacy, making a return of the Tenants of his Barony, enters William de Furcis as holding two knights'-fees of old feoffment, whilst a third fee was matter of litigation (in calump nid) ;9 that is, it was a question whether De Furchis held his lands under Lacy by service of two or of three knights'-fees. In Easter Term 1200 we have WUUam de Furcis as a Knight and Juror of a Grand Assize, which I have mentioned under Nordley Regis. From 1204 to 1208 we have seen him disputing the Manor of Oxenbold with Robert de Girros ; his claim being as Grandson and heir of William de Furcis who lived in 1135.10 The Assize-Roll of No vember 1221 proves the previous succession of a third William de Furcis, son and heir of the second William. The case was this, \u2014 Juliana de Corfton (whose son Nicholas was her Attorney) had a suit about lands, unspecified, against Adam de Ludelawe and his wife Emma.11 This Emma appears elsewhere on the same Roll as Emma fitz Richard, and as seeking by process of law to compel William de Furche to appear in warranty of a virgate in Corfton, which she claimed to hold under him, and whereof she had the Charter of William de Furche, his Father. William de Furchis, the expected Warrantor, did not appear, and an attachment issued against him for the morrow of St. Hilary at Warwick. The same time and place were fixed for the appearance, by her Attorney, of Juliana, widow of Roger the Provost, who was suing Emma for the premises, 9 Liber Niger, I, 154. 4 Domesday, so. 184, a, 1. 5 Testa de Nevill, p. 64, b. 6 Supra, Vol. Ill, p. 234. 7 \u25a0 s Supra, Vol. IV, pp. 21, 43. 10 Supra, Vol. IV, pp. 20-22.

A mar ginal note on the Roll intimates some objection to Emma fitz Ri chard's suing singly, for it says that she \" has a husband :\"13 Adam de Ludelawe of course is meant. On the morrow of St. Hilary, at Warwick, the Plea- Roll gives Susanna, widow of Roger the Provost, suing Adam * * * and Emma his wife for half a virgate in Corfton, and the Defendants calling WUliam, son of William de Furchis, to warranty?3 The result does not appear. At these same Shrop shire Assizes WUliam de Furchis and Isabella his wife duly ap peared in some suit, apparently relating to lands in Herefordshire, against Roger Pichard. The latter essoigned himself.14 In or about 1 240 we have William de Furchis as holding one Knight's-fee in Corfton under Walter de Lacy.15 In January 1243 he seems to have been dead ; for Isabella de Furches, clearly his widow, held part of Bodenham (Herefordshire) in dower under Wil liam de Furchis,16 that is, under her son, I presume, viz. William de Furchis (IV). Cotemporary with WUliam de Furchis (III) was Roger de Furchis. He occurs in 1221 and 1226, and was perhaps William's brother. WiUiam de Furchis (IV) appears in November 1248 as being called to warrant 4\\ acres in Corfton to Hugh de Ernewode. This he did, but forthwith conveyed the premises by Fine to PetroniUa de Culmynton, who claimed them. PetroniUa was to hold them of William de Furchis at a rent of 12d., and she paid 20*. down. This Fine I take to have been a technical mode of transferring a tenancy. William de Furchis occurs again in March 1249, under circum stances before noticed.17 In 1250 the Arrentation of Forest-land by Geoffrey de Langley assessed Isabella de Furcis at 66?. for half an acre in Crofton?9 The Munslow Inquisition of 1255 duly presents WUliam de Fur ches, who was one of the Jury, as holding Corfton of the heir of Walter de Lacy. The Manor was estimated at two hides (instead of the three hides of Domesday) and paid 2*. stretward and motfee. It did suit to both County and Hundred.19 Cotemporary mention of William de Furchis, as owing ward at Montgomery Castle, wras pro- 12 Assizes, 6 Hen.

At the Assizes of January 1256 Sir William de Furcis acted as a Juror of Grand Assize. He was also in office as one of the four Coroners of Shropshire. In July 1256, a writ of mort d'ancestre for lands in Corfton, Diddlebury, Parva Sutton, and Magna Cam berson, was had against William de Furchis by Nicholas son of John de Keutcwell. By Charter, dated at Hereford on August 3, 1256, King Henry III. granted to his faithful and beloved servant (minis tro) William de Furch, that for the rest of his life he should not be put on any Assize, Jury, or Recognition, nor be made Sheriff, Coro ner, Escheator, Verderer, Forester, Agistator, Regarder, or in any other way Bailiff to the King, against his will.21 Yet in 1257 William de Furchis was one of a jury of twelve which had been amerced 40*. for some misdemeanour. In 1259 he had been indi vidually amerced five merks for some non-appearance. This affair was probably of some standing, as he had paid half the debt to Philip de Pres, Receiver of Robert de Grendon, whose Shrievalty ceased in October 1255. In 1267 I find Sir William de Furches attesting two instruments whereby Sir Henry de Pembruge affected to secure to Roger de Mortimer the Manor of Pembruge,22 which affair I have narrated under Tong. The Feodary of 1284 gives Walter de Coke saye as holding the Vill of Corfton under Peter de Genevill.23 This Walter de Cokesaye I have before mentioned as a Clerk.24 His tenure of Corfton was perhaps in trust, for certain it is that Robert Burnel], Bishop of Bath and Wells, died in 1292, seized of Corfton and holding it of Peter de Genevill's heir. His tenure was by ser vice of one knight's-fee and by doing suit-of-court at Ludlow. The Capital messuage and demesne lands of Corfton were valued at 34*. pei- annum, a wood there at 6*. ; \u2014 the rents of free tenants were \u00a34. 14*. lie?., of Customary Tenants 8*. 6si?. The pleas and perqui sites of the Manor Court were 2*.

In Here fordshire however its estates passed with an heir female to the War wickshire family of Lucy of Charlecote, an ancestor of whom, Sir William, had on August 1, 1234, been appointed Steward of Lud- 20 Vide supra, Vol. IV, pp. 43, 45. 21 Forest Roll, No. IV, Salop. 22 Liber Niger de Wigmore, so. 95. 23 Kirby's Quest. 24 Supra, Vol. I, pp. 335-6. 25 Inquisitions, 21 Edw.

About the Christian name of the heiress of De Furchis, as weU as that of her Father, Authors differ so widely that I am content to leave to a note an investigation which belongs properly to the history of another County.25 I now return to speak of Roger de Furchis, presumed to have been brother of William de Furchis (III) . At the Assizes of November 1221, this Roger occurs as Surety of Howel fitz Adam, whom I shall speak of under Lawton. Also at these Assizes Roger de Fur chis withdrew his suit against WiUiam fitz Warin for common pas ture in Corfton. His Sureties were Richard fitz Cufi, Gerard the Beadle, and Walter fitz Baldwin. In 1226 he was on a great Jury, about the Forest of Stiperstones. In 1257 he had been succeeded by a son Robert, who on July 29, caUing himself Robert son of Roger de Furches, had a writ of mort d'ancestre against Thomas de Grete and others for a tenement in Diddlebury, and who in August of the same year has a writ of novel disseizin against WUliam de 26 Compare Dugdale's Warwickshire (Thomas), pp. 502, 503, and Duncumb's Here fordshire, II, 34. Dugdale's statements on this subject are so apparently probable in themselves, and yet so utterly irreconcilable with the descent of De Furchis as implied in the text, that I must needs give both stories, though I freely confess that the result is only a complex difficulty. \u2014 Walter de Hereford, Constable of England, was living at Michaelmas 1159. He was deceased soon afterwards, and was succeeded by his Brother Henry, who was probably dead in 1163, certainly so in 1165. Between 1160 and 1165 we may safely date a Deed (transcribed by Dugdale, \u2014 MS. K. p. 22) whereby Hanricus de Hereford, Constable of the King, gives to William de Furgis, in fee, 10 librates of land, viz. Kingestun, for the service of half a knight's-fee. Other conditions follow, not very intelligible in themselves, but implying that if this feoffment should ever be increased to 20 librates of land, the Feoffee should owe the service of a whole Knight's-fee, and also shewing that WiUiam de Furgis claimed some other inheritance which in case of his success would make him the Liege of some other Lord. The Deed seems to have passed at Brecknock, and was attested by the Grantor's wife Isabel. So far a comparison of dates will not prevent our assuming that this William de Furgis was identical with William who succeeded Herbert de Furchis as De Lacy's Tenant, between 1160 and 1165. Dugdale tells us nothing of any intermediate generations of this family till he comes to Amicia, daughter and heir of W'ilham de Furchis, heir also of William fitz Warin, and wife of William, son of William de Luey of Charlcote. Dugdale derived this in formation from a Deed which he had seen at Charlcote, and a transcript of which re mains among his MSS. It runs thus :\u2014 \" William fitz Warin grants to WiUiam de Luscy, son and heir of William de Luscy, Amicia his (WiUiam fitz Warin' s) heir, and daughter and heir of WiUiam de Furches, for his wife, with aU her inheritance and all lands which can accrue to her. He (Fitz Warin) undertakes that when AVilliam de Lucy, the Father, shall please, he (Fitz Warin) will go, with the counsel of the said"], [75, "49 CORFTON. Curly for a tenement in Corfton. For these writs Robert de Fur chis is charged 1 merk, and half a merk, on the Pipe Rolls of 1257 and 1258 respectively. The Pipe Roll of 1259 informs us of the result in each case ; for Robert son of Roger de Furchis stands amerced 406?. for false claim, and William de Curly a like sum for disseizin. ThisRobertde Furchiswas occasionally styled of Aston, and his Father Roger, of Diddlebury. This appears from a deed whereby, about 1250-60, \" John Hortwall, son of Adam de Hortwall, grants to Robert de Firches of Aston, son of Roger de Firches of Diddle bury, a messuage and half-virgate in the vill of Aston, which Her bert de la Hull formerly held of the Grantor; \u2014 this for a sum of 3 merks now paid.

The Deed was seal.-d with a difference of the weU-known arms of the Shropshire Fitz Warins, viz. with arms, \u2014 Quarterly, per fesse indented, Gules and Argent. Dugdale (History of Warwickshire, pp. 502-3) intimates that WUliam de Lucy Senior, named in this Deed, was he who died about 1248, that he had a wealthy brother Stephen who died in or before 1233. I know from other sources (Testa de Nevill, p. 71, a), that WiUiam Fitz Warin, Sheriff of Herefordshire from Sept. 18, 1232 to 1234, died before 1240. Tnis Deed then passed before 1240, probably before 1233, and there is nothing in the names of its other witnesses to contradict such an assumption. Possibly also it accounts for the appointment of WiUiam de Lucy as Seneschal of Walter de Lacy in 1234. But then comes the question, \u2014 How if the Une of De Furchis had ended in a female heir before 1240, how is it that we find WiUiam de Furchis holding a knight's-fee in Kim'estun in 1243, under the Earl of Hereford (Testa de Nevill) ? How too is it that we find still later notices of Corfton, etc., being held by the male line of De Furcis, as stated in the text ? These are questions which I cannot answer ; for to suppose that the above Deed falsely asserts Amieia's heirship is to tamper with direct evidence. Moreover the marriage with this heiress has been a standing tradition in the House of Lucy, a tradition supported strongly by the simple fact of these Deeds being in posses sion ofthe Lucys, and by the further fact of which Duncumb (Vol. II, p. 34) assures us, viz. that Bodenham Furches continued in the famUy tUl the reign of Elizabeth. Duncumb indeed ascribes the marriage of a Lucy with the heiress of De Furchis, to a much later period ; but then that later marriage does not account for the above Deed of the thirteenth century.

Simon rejoined that Robert de Furchis did not die seized of the premises, since he had given them to Simon himself by a Charter which he (Simon) now produced. The cause was adjourned tUl the full age of Henry de Furchis;28 but I may observe that Simon dela Hethe's plea, grounded on a grant to himself, seems inconsistent with the plea of heirship necessarily implied by every suit of mort d'ancestre. Henry de Furchis occurs somewhat later, in the foUowing series of Deeds, from the first of which I infer that his mother, Christiana, was an heiress in Aston. \u2014 Robert de Aston, with assent of Christiana his wife, grants to Henry de Forches that messuage and half-virgate in Aston which Henry's father had held, and which Christiana, Henry's Mother, had granted to him (Robert) in fee.

In January 1256, Alice, Wife of Roger le Wayn, and Aldith her sister, as sisters and heirs of Ste phen, son of Osbern le Harpur, sued Ingerich Spigh and Johanna de Corfton for 10 acres in Corfton, but the latter were shown not to be tenants-in-common (non tenere communatim), so the case failed for want of form ; but the Plaintiffs were allowed to amend their mode of procedure.31 At the same Assizes Alice fitz Simon withdrew her suit of novel disseizin against Roger le Chapclain and others for a tenement in Corfton.32 On May 28, 1256, Roger de Diddlebury has a writ of novel disseizin against William Parson of Diddlebury, for tenements and lands in Diddlebury, Corfton, and Northon.

(per annum) ; afterwards it was worth 2*., now it is worth 20*.\" x Of \u00c6lsi the Saxon, and of Herbert the presumed Ancestor of De Furchis, I have spoken under Corfton. William de Middelhope seems to have been the chief Feoffee of De Furchis in this Manor very early in the thirteenth century. There was also one William de Stanton,2 a Tenant of about a third of the Manor, but who seems to have conveyed his share to the said WiUiam de Middelhope. At the Assizes of October 1203, William de Middelhope appears as a Juror of causes tried by Grand Assize, and as one of the Coroners of Shropshire. He was probably a Knight. In Michaelmas Term 1204, he is named as a Visor who had to investigate the validity of an essoign de malo lecti, Warner de Wililey being Essoignee. In Michaelmas Term 1205, he was Attorney for Robert de Girros in the Suit noticed under Oxenbold. At the Forest Assizes of March 1209 he was assessed in two distinct Regards of the Long Forest, being called in one \" Lord of Middelhope,\" in the other \" WUliam de Middelhope.\" Between this year and 1215 William Middelhope, and Richard, his son, attest a Charter to Buildwas Abbey, which I shall set forth under Leighton. In or about 1215 we have already had an attestation by Richard de Middlehope,3 indicating his pre vious succession to his Father WiUiam. In November 1221 Richard de Middelhope occurs as Surety of Howel fitz Adam. On October 2, 1224, a King's Writ exonerates him from serving on any Juries, etc., in consideration of his office as a Verderer cf the Forest.4 In August 1226 he occurs however on a Great Jury, which had to in vestigate several matters relating to Stiperstones Forest. On Nov. 2, 1234, he was appointed a Justice to deliver Shrewsbury Gaol; again in October 1237, a Justice to try several civil suits in Shrop shire, and also to deliver the Gaols of Shrewsbury and Brug. On July 14, 1241, he was, with three others, once more appointed to try a civil suit, and to deliver Shrewsbury Gaol. In January 1246 he was Foreman of a Jury which was to investigate the Forest-rights of Thomas Corbet of Caus.

In one of his numerous attestations of Charters, Richard de Middelhope is followed by Roger de Middelhope.6 Their relation ship was perhaps that of Father and Son ; but the eldest son, and successor of Richard, was William de Middelhope, whom the Munslow Inquest of 1255 registers as then holding Midelhope of William de Furcis for a hide of land. William de Furcis did suit for the Manor to both County and Hundred, from which suits his Tenant was therefore exempted. The latter however paid the annual sum of 1*., \u2014 the Stretward and Motfee chargeable on the Manor.7 At the Assizes of January 1256 William de Middelhope makes his brother Roger his Attorney in a suit against Master William de Ros. A Patent of May 20, 1259, appoints certain Justices to inquire whether William son of Richard de Middelhope had slain his Bro ther Thomas accidentally or not. A second Patent of July 20, 1259, relinquishes, as far as the King is concerned, all prosecution of WUliam son of Richard de Middelhope, who had slain his Bro ther Thomas by accident. At the Forest Assizes of February 1262 one Herbert de Middelhop stands on the list entitled Essonia Mor tis, and one Reginald de Middelhop was amerced 126?. for Vert. I cannot say how these persons were related to William de Middel hope. He seems to have died about this time, and was succeeded by a son William. To the latter, called \"William son of William de Middelhope,\" a Patent of March 4, 1264, grants leave to hunt throughout the King's Forests in Shropshire. Richard son of William de Middelhope, on April 27, 1266, has a Writ of novel disseizin concerning a tenement in Middelhope against William de Middelhope ; that is, I presume, against his elder brother. In 1267 one Thomas de Middelhope, perhaps another brother of William, was Surety for a party suing for lands at Munslow. The same Thomas, as Under-Bailiff to Thomas de Grete, Bailiff of Munslow Hundred, was charged at the Inquisitions of November 1274 with 7 Rot. Hundred. II, 71. Rut. Hundred.

He was sued for a third part of the Manor (saving half a virgate) by Robert son of William de Stanton, who alleged that the said Wil liam de Stanton his Father had merely demised the premises, for a term of ten years now expired, to WUliam de Middelhope, Great- Grandfather of the present Defendant. The Defendant however got judgment by producing the Charter whereby William de Stan ton had enfeoffed his Great- Grandfather.10 This Suit very satis factorily confirms the succession of the four first Lords of Middle hope as deduced from other evidence. On the Munslow Inquisition of November 1274 WTilliam de Midelhop sat as third Juror. A matter personal to himself was re ported. He, as Lord of Midelhope, had agreed with another for the purchase of some land. Each party covenanted by a writing to pay a penalty of 40 merks to Sir Roger de Mortimer if he did not fulfil his part of the agreement. Afterwards by the advice of mu tual friends, it was determined to cancel the said agreement. How ever, the penal bond was not destroyed, but remained in custody of G. Andreu, from whom it was extorted by John de Blechedon and Geoffrey de Venur, two of Mortimer's Bailiffs. The latter forthwith distrained WUUam de Middelhope on the ground of this Bond, alleging that he had acted contrary to it. They actually got from him 22 merks.11 In Michaelmas Term 1278 some Law-proceedings seem to have resulted in the foUowing judgment, viz. that William de Middlehope held the Manor of Middlehope under WUliam de Furchis.12 On May 12, 1284, Sir WUliam de Middelhope sat second Juror on an Inquest about the Woods of Idshale ;13 and at the Assizes of October 1292 he was one of the two Munslow Jurors who selected their ten associates. Like Corfton the seigneural interest of De Furcis at Middlehope had at this time passed to Robert Burnell, Bishop of Bath and Wells. The Inquest on that Prelate's death does not allude to this acquisition ; but at the Shrewsbury Assizes of 1292 the King sued WiUiam de Middelhope for this Manor 8 \u20229 Rot. Hundred.

The King now therefore sued for the Manor itself, to hold in demesne. WUliam de Mid delhope left it to a Jury to say whose right was the best : whether the King's, \u2014 to hold the Manor as he required it, or William's, \u2014 to hold it by one-third of a knight's-fee under PhUip Burnel as kinsman of Bishop Burnel. The Jury found for the Defendant,14 and indeed it is difficult to imagine any possible pretext for this claim of the Crown. WilUam de Middelhope was himself on a Jury which tried certain others of these causes of Quo Waranto. The Inquest on the death of PhUip Burnel, taken in May 1295, values WiUiam de Midelhope's lands in Midelhope at \u00a38. Os. 2\\d. per annum, but states him to have held them of the deceased by service of three-fourths of a Knight's-fee.15 \u00c6nifcurp. The Domesday account of this Manor must be taken to include Walton. The Bishop of Hereford was the Lord Paramount, and it was his only Manor in Culvestan Hundred. Domesday says, \u2014 \" The same Bishop held Aneberie in King Edward's time, and now Roger de Laci holds it of the Bishop. Here are in hides geldable. In demesne there is one ox-team, and there nn Villains in gross (Villani integri), and vi Semi-Villains (Dimidii), and a Priest and one Cottar (Cozes) with in teams. Here is i Serf.

Now it is worth 20*.\" ' We hear something further of Onibury at a period very shortly after Domesday ; for Roger de Lacy, who was banished in 1195, gave the tithes of Aneberie to Shrewsbury Abbey. King Henry I's Charter, confirmatory of this and other grants to the Abbey, \" Placita de Quo Waranto, p. 680. i 15 Inquisitions, 22 Edw.

Such a mark of deference to the name of his deceased Suzerain and political Ally will appear more probable from certain remarks which I shall have to offer under Ludlow. The return made in 1165-6 of the Knights'-fees held under the See of Hereford states, that during the whole time of Gilbert Foliot, the late Bishop, that is from Sept. 5, 1148, to March 24, 1163, Hugh de Lacy had held and performed the service due upon two knights'-fees, but that then (1165-6) he denied all service on one of the said fees.3 Now passing the question whether Hugh de Lacy had been in possession for so long a period as is here de scribed, and passing also another assertion of the Bishop, viz. that these two fees ought to be of the Bishop's demesne (which I do not understand), I proceed to say that Lacy's tenure under the See of Hereford continued to be a single knight's-fee ; and that John Cumin, Custos of the vacant See in 1168, answering for the Scu tage then coUected, leaves the sum of 1 merk, due on one of Lacy's fees, unpaid, saying that Hugh de Lacy denied the debt.4 What ever service was ultimately performed by Lacy to the See of Here ford, it is certain that such service was performed wholly or partly for the Manor of Onibury. From what I have said under Wootton, it will be seen that William de Wootton was before 1175 Lacy's Under-tenant at Onibury, and that he held both Onibury and Walton for half or three-quarters of a knight's-fee, according as his Lord required a military or a pecuniary aid. The succession of the Lords of Onibury, from this period downwards, has been given under Wootton. A few local particulars have stiU to be added re garding Onibury. The neighbouring Priory and Manor of Brom field were subject to Gloucester Abbey. Hence in June 1243 we find Henry, Abbot of Gloucester, suing (I think amicably) Robert de Wodeton as Tenant of 30 acres of land and 10 acres of Bosc in Bromfeld. By Fine then levied, the Abbot enfeoffs Robert in the premises, reserving a rent of 3*. For this, Robert paid the Abbot two merks in money, and conceded to him a right of free-chace and free-fishery throughout his (Robert's) lands in Wodeton, Ouy ber', and Walton. The Inquest of 1255 says that \" Robert de Lascy (son-in-law of Robert de Wodeton, I think) holds Walton and Oniburi of the heir 2 Salop Chartulary, No. 35. 3 Liber Niger, I, 150. * Rot. Pip. 14 Hen.

They state his interest here to consist of 20*. rent.6 In February 1256 Robert de Lacy and Amice his Wife (Impe dients) convey by Fine to Walter de Strangeford (Plaintiff) 1\u00a3 virgates in Waleton, whereof was Plea of Warranty of Charter. They acknowledge the premises to be their gift ; \u2014 to hold to the Plaintiff and his heirs, of Robert and Amice, and the heirs of Amice, at 1*. rent. Walter gave one sore sparrow-hawk. In 1284 the Feodary gives Thomas de Grete as holding Oneburi and Walton of the Lords of Ludlow for half a knight's-fee, whilst the said Lords held under the Bishop and Chapter of Hereford. Thomas de Grete, as I have before said, succeeded Robert de Lacy as husband of Amice, the heiress of Wootton, Onibury, etc. The Fine has been already set forth by which William de Schippeye, third husband of the said Amice, concurred with her, and her son Roger de Grete, in June 1293, in conveying the Manor aud Advow son of Onibury to Philip BurneU.7 Philip Burnell died in the fol lowing year, and the Inquisitions say nothing of his recent acquisi tion of the Manor of Onibury ; but the Advowson of the Church, worth 20 merks per annum, is duly noted as his.8 His Widow MatUda had the Manor of Onibury and Walton in dower, and so held it when the Nomina-Villarum return was made in March 1316.9 THE CHURCH. The Priest mentioned in Domesday probably betokens the then existence of a Church here. Roger de Lacy's grant of the tithes of Onibury to Shrewsbury Abbey is not inconsistent with that idea ; for it may be proved in numberless instances that the Normans granted away the whole or parts of their manorial tithes at discre tion, and without reference to parochial necessities. However I cannot find that Shrewsbury Abbey eventually reaUzed any such right in Onibury. In 1291 the Church-Taxation gives \u00a310. as the annual value of the Church of Onebury in Ludlow Deanery, and 8 Inquisitions, 22 Edw. I, No. 45, d. 9 Parliamentary Writs, TV, 398. 5-6 Rot. Hundred.

Thirty virgates in the Parish lay untiUed, so heavy were the local burdens on the Tenantry. The Glebe-land and Alterages of the Church, worth 100*., the hay-tithes, worth 10*., the smaU tithes, offerings, and other profits, worth 40*., went to swell the C nur ch-T ax ation, but could not be taken to imply any such properties as were now to be assessed.11 The Valor of 1534-5 gives Thomas Slade as Rector of Onybury.

Roger de Lodelowe, Rector of Onebury, has a license to study for one year, dated March 27, 1276. On May 7, 1349, King Edward III forbids the Bishop of Here ford to admit any Parson to this Church, till it be decided whether the Patronage belong to Reginald de Cobham, Knight, and Johanna his wife, or to Nicholas BurneU, Knight. Before the Bishop can have received this Writ, viz. on May 8, 1349, he instituted \u2014 Sir Thomas Asselote, Priest, on presentation of Sir Nicholas Burnel, Knight. William de Strettone occurs as Rector here in 43 Edw. Ill (1369-70). John Hyde, Clerk, was instituted June 15, 1375, on presenta tion of \" Sir Nicholas Burnel, Lord of Holgot.\" Sir John de Onebury (perhaps the same person) resigned tins Living on Feb. 3, 1386, and on Feb. 7 foUowing \u2014 Henry de Collysmor was instituted at the presentation of Hugh Burnell, Lord of Holgot.

Robert dc BoUedon was probably son of WiUiam by a former wife. A Fine was levied between the parties, whereby Alice renounced aU her claim, and Robert conceded to her a virgate in BoUedon, half of which she herself already held, and half of which was held by Ri chard de BoUedon, Robert's son.

It recites the preliminaries of the case, exactly as we should expect ; \u2014 William, Thomas Mauduit's Clerk, being his Attorney. Mauduit concedes to the Tenant the whole Vill of Bul lardune in fee and inheritance, to hold of himself (Mauduit) by ser vice of three parts of a knight's-fee, in lieu of all other services. For this the Defendant paid 100*. We may say then summarily, that in this instance the service of a fourth part of a knight's-fee was bought and sold for \u00a35. In June 1237 special Justices are appoiuted to try a suit of novel disseizin, which the Prior of the Knight's Hospitallers had against Robert Bullardon and his feUows, concerning pasture in Clye (Clee St. Margaret).9 The Feodary of 1240 gives Robert de Bellardedon as holding | fee in Bellardedon of Thomas Mauduit's Barony.10 An Instrument which shows Ro bert de Bouldon to have been Constable of Castle Holgate in 1248 has been set forth already.11 In March 1249 he was a Juror in the Inquest quoted under Millichope.

Afterwards, on the morrow of Ascension Day, he ap peared at Westminster and acknowledged that he owed the said suit and service. It was worth 2*. per annum.

An extraordinary but not unsatisfactory collection of fragments has to be arranged relating to this smaU Manor. Domesday says thus : \u2014 \" The same Helgot holds Possetorne (of the Earl) . Aluric held it (in Saxon times). Here is one virgate of land, geldable. The arable land is sufficient for half an ox-team. The Manor was and is waste.\"1 Aluric I observe had been Saxon Lord ofthe adja cent Manors of Great Sutton and Little Sutton, Manors which were in the same parish with Upper Poston, viz. Diddlebury. We have already had a notice of Upper Poston, as soon after Domesday as the reign of Henry I. It was related under Dudmas ton, how Helgot's son, Herbert, enfeoffed Harlewyne de Butailles, 14 Assizes, 40 Hen. Ill, m. 12. 15 Placita de Quo Waranto, p. 707. 16 Inquisitions, 22 Edw.

Neither do I find that the Dudmastons maintained their mesne interest in Poston, but never- theless persons who were tenants of the Dudmastons at Lye-Hall had, as we shall see, in the thirteenth century a tenant-interest in Poston. In the latter part of the twelfth century the Mesne-Lord of Possetorn, under the Barons of Holgate, was that Robert de Girros whom I have already noticed as holding Oxenbold, Burwar- ton, Long Stanton, and Charlcott, under the same Barons. The Escheator, who in 1195 received the profits of Robert de Girros's estates, accounts for 6 shillings as arising from Possetorn.3 It is clear that the Tenant of Robert de Girros at Poston was a Cadet of his own family. Of the line of these Cadets I have spoken under Long Stanton,4 and shaU have more to say under Little Sutton. Roger de Girros of Stanton, Father and Son, seem to me to have held Upper Poston under the head of their family for a great part of the thirteenth Century. They, again, had an Undertenant here of whom we have heard more than once before. This was Richard Snell, alias Kene, the son of Richard fitz Fulco and the Father of three daughters, Susanna, Alice, and Matilda atte Legh. Referring generally to what I have said under Dudmaston and Romsley about this family,5 I repeat that Richard Kene was deceased in 1250. Further, as I have shown under Greet-Chapel, Richard Kene, pre- vious to his decease, gave half a virgate in Possethorne in pure alms to the said Chapel, of which Philip de Thongland was at the time, or became soon afterwards, Incumbent.6 Hence the Munslow In- quisition of 1255 states, that \"Philip de Thongland holds Upper Possethorne of Roger de Girrhos.\" The Manor was iu this case estimated to contain one-tweUth of a hide, that is, only a third part of a virgate. It did no suit either to County or Hundred, nor paid stretward nor motfee.7 The said suits had been withdrawn twentv years, which probably indicates the period of Richard Kene's grant, viz. 1235. The loss to the King by this withdrawal was 2*. per annum ; the loss by the non-payment of stretward and motfee was le?, per annum. 2 Supra, Vol. Ill, p. 186, Father aud Son, ranging from 1220 to 1270. 3 Rot.

The whole ratio of the Tenure is not given in the Inquisition, but we may pre- sume that the heirs of Robert de Girros held Upper Poston over Roger dc Girros, and under the Lords of Holgate. The ever vary- ing estimate of the contents of this- Manor it is impossible to ac- count for, but we learn that such inconsistencies are no disproof of identity. In 1259 I find PhUip de Thongland accounting for a heavy amercement, viz. 10 merks for false claim and for transgres- sion, but other particulars are not given. In 1267, as I have pointed out under Greet Chapel, Susanna and Alice de la Leye, two of Ri- chard Kene's daughters, faded to dispossess him (Philip de Thong- land) of Poston. We have yet one more phase of this matter. At the Assizes of September 1272, John de Escot and Susanna his wife, with Alice, Susanna's sister, sued Thomas de Hanleye and Juliana his wife for half a virgate in Possethorn Muchivardeknoll as the right of Susanna aud Alice, who alleged that the Defendants had no ingress into the premises save after an act of disseizin by which Mabel de la Leygh dispossessed the Father of the female Plaintiffs, here called Richard de la Leygh.8 It is necessary here to explain that Richard de la Leygh is identical with Richard Kene, that John de Escot was second husband of Susanna de la Leygh, and that Mabel, here mentioned, was the wife (probably the second wife) of Richard fitz Fulco, alias Richard Kene (I), alias Richard SneU (I), and was the Mother or Stepmother of Richard Kene (II), alias Richard Snell (II), alias Richard de la Leygh. The present suit failed because Thomas de Hanleye and Juliana proved that they were not Tenants of the premises, but that one Richard fitz Walter was tenant both now and on July 10, 1272, \u2014 the day on which the Plaintiffs obtained their Writ. The Plaintiffs here withdrew aU prosecution of their Suit ; \u2014 and well they might, for their renewal of it in the present instance must have been with a knowledge that the Charter which had five years before defeated their Suit of mort d'ancestre, disproved the averments of the present suit. The Inquisition taken in May 1295, after the death of Philip Burnel, shows the continued interest of the Lords of Holgate here, though represented only by the receipt of a small rent.9 Another Inquest taken in February 1301, in obedience to a Writ of Certiorari, states that Philip Burnel, deceased, had held Posse- 8 Assizes, 56 Hen.

(Helgot) found it waste.\"1 Between the year of the Domesday- Survey (1085) and the returns known as the Liber Niger (1165), there were several changes in the Baronies of Helgot and De Lacy. No existing Record hints at the ground of these changes, but two of them seem to have had some mutual reference. I have said that Lacy, the Domesday Lord, and Herbert, the Domesday Tenant of Long Stanton, lost all their interest there;2 also I have shown a probability that the Lords of Holgate acquired a partial interest there.3 With Great Sutton a change nearly but not exactly con verse took place. The Lords of Holgate lost the Seigneury, and Lacy gained it, not in fee, but as holding over the said Lords ; also 10 Inquisitions, 28 Edw. I, No. 24. 11 Parliamentary Writs, IV, 398. 1 Domesday, so. 258, b, 2. 2 \u2022 3 Supra, Vol. IV, pp. 32, 36, 37"], [91, "65 GREAT SUTTON AND WICHCOTT. Herbert's interest (which should subsequently be represented by De Furcis) vanished altogether. Again, under Tong I have noticed two Charters which passed during the usurpation of Stephen, and also at a period when Lacy's Barony was under Escheat ; and these two Charters, attested by several well-known Tenants in Lacy's Barony, are also attested by Herbert de Castellis, the then Baron of Hol gate.4 At the same period then, I conceive, certain transactions were on foot which resulted in the following fact. In 1165 Hugh de Lacy (whose honours had previously been restored to his Father) returned Herebert de Castellis as holding n fees of new feoffment in his (Lacy's) Barony.6 It is further probable, from the context of Lacy's Return, that these two fees were in Shropshire ; and it is cer tain, from later evidences, that Great Sutton, including Wichcott, constituted one of them. I think then that the following supposi tion may be ventured, viz. that Long Stanton having been dismem bered during Lacy's forfeiture, and the King (Henry II) being un able to restore it integrally to Lacy, gave or confirmed an estate there to the Lords of Holgate, on condition of their relinquishing then* Seigneury at Great Sutton, and holding the latter Manor by service of one Knight's-fee at Ludlow Castle, and that so, Ludlow being restored to Lacy, this fee was said to be Lacy's, and to be of new feoffment.6 In or about 1240 Thomas Mauduit (then Lord of Holgate) is said to hold one Knight's-Fee in Sutton and Wichecot, of Walter de Lacy ;7 and in 1255 William Mauduit holds the same as one of the Fees pertaining to Ludlow Castle, and therefore held under the Heirs of Lacy.8 About the year 1257, the King of Almagne hav ing acquired Mauduit' s Shropshire estates, whether held in capite or otherwise, alienated the whole to the Knights Templars, who are consequently said by the Jurors of Stanton Lacy, in November 1274, to be holding this fee in Sutton and Wychecote.9 But in 1284 Robert Burnel, Bishop of Bath and Wells, though he is said to hold the Manor of Castle Holgate under the Earl of Cornwall, services from other Manors of Lacy's Fief. I cannot conjecture how Lacy's Manors became thus chargeable at Montgomery, but it is easy to conceive that Lacy's Seigneury might easily become effaced in any Manor so chargeable. 4 Supra, Vol. II, pp. 203-206. 5 Hearne' s Liber Niger, I, 154. 6 What was the other fee held by Her bert de Castellis under Hugh de Lacy, it is difficult to determine. If it was any estate at Long-Stanton, the service due thereon was probably made afterwards returnable at Montgomery Castle, which was in the Crown, and which received 7 Testa de Nevill, pp. 45, 48, 50. 8 Rot.

This was however only half the Manor, and was held by only half a knight's-fee; for Wichcot (the other half fee) is said to be held by Robert Brom, of the same Theobald. However Robert Burnell was, ere this, Mesne-Lord of Wichcot, as I shall presently show. Therefore the Inquisition taken Dec. 10, 1292, after his death, says that he had held the Vills of Magna Sutton and Whichecote of Sir Theobald de Verdon by service of one Knight's-fee, and by doing suit to the Court of Ludlow. The extent or annual value of the whole was as follows : \u2014 A capital mes suage and garden, 4*. Two Carucates of demesne, worth \u00a34. Eight acres of meadow, worth 12*. A Water-MUl, worth \u00a31. 7s. Rents of free Tenants, .\u20ac4. 14*. 11 6?. ; of Customary Tenants, \u00a31. 2s. Id. Labour-dues from Customary Tenants, worth 6*. 9fe?.

In March 1317 the Inquest after Theobald de Ver don's death gives Sutton and Wychcote as if they were two Tenures, one held by Robert Broun, and one by John de Hanlou, Lord of Holgate, but as if held jointly by service of one knight's-fee, and valued aggregately at \u00a34. per annum?1 The undoubted fact is that Hanlou held the whole under Verdon, and Broun the half under Hanlou. This Robert Broun, I should observe, was Verdon's im mediate Tenant at Over Hayton. The earliest Undertenants in this Manor, of whom I find men tion, were Robert de Benthall and Robert his son, of whom I have given account under Benthall. They held Wichcott, apparently under the Lords of Holgate, but the Sub-Tenant of Wichcott, under Robert de BenthaU, Senior, was (as I have said) Martin de CasteUo, a person of some importance, and probably related to the Lords of Castle Holgate. We have had this Martin de CasteUo attesting a Charter of WUUam de Vere, Bishop of Hereford, in or soon after the year 1190.12 In 1203 he occurs with WUliam Mauduit (brother of the then Lord of Holgate) as Surety for Robert de Bouldon, a Tenant in that Honour. At these same Assizes he appears as a Juror of causes tried by Grand Assize, and therefore as a Knight. It was, I suppose, in Michaelmas Term 1204, that Robert de Ben- 10 Inquisitions, 21 Edw.

The Plea Roll (apparently of that Term) gives a day (in three weeks of Hilary) to the parties, and orders Emma to have her Warrantor with her in Court, as Martin would not answer her without.13 An Essoign-Roll of the same Term caUs the Defendant Martin fitz Robert, and names the Es soignor iu the present instance, viz. Henry son of Henry Sidenude. The Plaintiff was to have a Writ to the Sheriff, ordering him to compel the appearance of Robert, son of Robert (de BenthaU) , who ought to be her Warrantor, but who was now in ward to the Prior of Wenlock (as Seignoral Lord of Benthall).14 The Fine which eventually settled this matter passed in London, in one month of Easter 1205. It purports to be between Emma, widow of Robert de Benthall (Plaintiff) and Martin de Castellis (Tenant) concerning Emma's dower in the free tenement of her late husband in Wiche cote, which dower Robert, son and heir of her said husband, had warranted to her. The said Robert (Junior) now acknowledged the land to be the right of Martin, \u2014 to hold to Martin and his heirs by the free service of 2 merks per annum ; so however as that Martin, by concession of the same Robert, should pay the said rent to Emma for her life in the name of dower. For this, Martin gave to Emma 4 merks of silver. The cotemporary Assize-Roll enters the last gift as a debt pro fine facto, to be paid by instalments, viz. 2 merks on June 24, 1 merk on Sept. 29, and 1 merk on Dec. 25 ; and in pledge of such pay ments Martin placed his fee of Wichecot.15 All I have further to say of Martin de Castello is that, having served as one of the Coroners of the County, he was deceased before the Assizes of November 1221. At the Assizes of 1256 John son of Alexander de Duddebir (Did dlebury) failed to prosecute his assize of novel disseizin against John Bacun for a Tenement in Magna Sutton.16 In May 1271 Geoffrey de Whycecote has two Writs of novel disseizin, one against Philip de Whycecote and others, the other against WiUiam de Whyce cote and Agnes his wife, concerning tenements in Whycecote. In Easter Term, 1283, John Burnel and Margery his wife, and John de Cantred and Alice his wife (Deforciants), quit-claim for themselves and the heirs of Margery and Alice, to Robert Burnell, Bishop of 13 \u25a0 14 Placita et Essonia incerti tern ports, No. 75, m. 13, No. 66, m. 1. 9 dorso. 16 Assizes, 40 Hen.

The Bishop gave 100*. for this.17 At the Assizes of 1292, Robert Broun (of Wichcote) was on the Jury for Munslow Hundred. A survey of the Burnel Estates taken by Royal Order in February 1301, shows us how a mesne-tenure may have existed for nearly a century without being once mentioned in any public document. The Lords of Benthall were stUl Mesne-Lords of Wichecote; \u2014 that is, Wichecote, an estate of Philip Burnel, de- ceased, worth \u00a31. 6*. 8d. per annum, had been held by him in socage of the Lords of Bent/tale, and was now in custody of Gunceline de Badlesmere, with other Burnel estates. The same Survey gives a Tenement in Benthall itself lately held by Philip Burnell under John de Benthall (then Lord of Benthall), and worth 13*. 4^6?. per annum.19 This Tenure I have already described fully.19 By Fine levied in November 1305, Geoffrey fitz Philip of Magna Sutton and Agnes his wife (Deforciants) quit-claim for themselves and the heirs of Agnes, one messuage, 38 acres of arable laud, and 5 acres of meadow in Magna Sutton and Corvedale, to Robert de Eton (Plaintiff), who gives them \u00a3J20.

The same individual is often found to have had a twofold interest hit he same estate, that is, his name occurs twice over in the scale of tenures.

This Fine indicates, I think, the mode in which BenthaU andWichcottdescended. Tbe male line of the older BenthaUs, re presented by PhUip de BenthaU, in 1274, seems to have faded before 1283, and three Coheiresses, probably daughters of PhUip, to have succeeded. Two of these pre sumed Coheiresses are named in the above fine, the third I take to have been CecUy, wife of Nicholas CoUyng (mentioned Vol. Ill, p. 277). Margery, wife of John Bur nell, was probably the eldest Coheiress.

Robert Christian who attests Ralph de BaskerviU's grant to Shrewsbury Abbey, may have been of Steventon.2 More certainly Henry Christian was, who has occurred to us in 1194 as a Knight ofthe County.3 In September 1199 this Henry Christian, then called Senior, appears in connection with Ste venton. His son, another Henry, had sued Richard le Veil and AUce his wife for balsa virgate in Stevinton, under Writ of mort d'ancestre. He now renounced all his right, to them and their heirs, by consent and wUl of his Father being present. For this his Father gave him another half virgate in the same vill, viz. that which Walter fitz Estmar held, to hold by service of lib. of Cumin (in lieu of all, except forinsec, services) , and payable to Henry Senior and his heirs. At the Assizes of 1203 one Henry de Stiventon occurs as the Essoignor of Simon Falconer, and perhaps was identical with Henry Christian, Se nior or Junior. We shaU hear no more at present of this family under either name. The Steventons whom I have noticed as resident near Shiffnal in the thirteenth century were perhaps of the same stock.4 In the same century the Barons of Holgate had two distinct Feoffees at Steventon. This is shown by the Inquisition of 1255, which says, that Nicholas fitz Andrew and WiUiam de Aldenham hold one hide of land, Stivinton, of the Barony of William Mauduit. These Tenants did Suit to the greater and lesser Hundred-Courts but paid neither stretward nor motfee. As to Suit of the County, William Mauduit discharged that, both for Castle Holgate and for these Tenants, inasmuch as they held of his demesne of Castle Hol gate.5 There was therefore no knight' s-service retained on Steven ton. William de Aldenham here mentioned, was the same per son as he whom I have before noticed as holding Aldenham under Baskerville of Pickthorn. He seems to have underlet his share of Steventon. I have already given some particulars of a case where a second William de Aldenham, in 1267, warranted a noke in Steven ton to Adam fitz David, and, his title to do so proving unsound, was 4 Supra, Vol. II, pp. 329, 330. 5 Rot.

The Pipe-Roll of the same year gives Adam fitz David as amerced half a merk for unjust detention, but this must have been some other affair. In 1270 I find William, son of William de Aldenham, tak ing out a writ of novel disseizin against Thomas de Krete (probably Grete) and others, for a tenement in Styvynton. Also in Easter Term 1270, diverse mattersb etween Wyard de Styvinton (Plaintiff), and Adam fitz David (tenant), of a messuage and a noke (less 1^ acres) in Styvinton, were settled by Fine. Adam acknowledged the right of Wyard who, by his Attorney (WUliam son of Roger le Moneur), conceded this messuage and noke to Adam and his heirs, \u2014 to hold by payment of 276?. rent to Wyard, and by discharge of all capital services. It appears that Adam fitz David had previous to this Fine demised certain rents in Steventon, amounting to 14*. 56?., to Wyard and his heirs. This transfer he allows in the present Fine, reserv ing a rent of one clove to himself. About this time a Family surnamed Aylrich or Eyldrich was of some importance in the Borough of Ludlow, and in 1284 we find Nicholas Eyldrich as one of the Coparceners in Steventon.7 How he acquired it I cannot say, but the two Coparceners held it for one fourth of a Knight's-fee of the Heir of John fitz Alan, which heir held under the Bishop of Bath and WeUs, who held of the Earl of Cornwall. Thus the Seigneury of the Lords of Holgate remained ; but since the year 1255 a mesne interest of Fitz Alan had been esta blished here. Something of the same kind happened at The Heath, where John Fitz Alan (II) obtained a mesne interest under the Lords of Holgate between 1255 and 1263.8 I now return to Nicholas Fitz Andrew, who in 1255 was the other Coparcener in this Manor. His Father, Andrew fitz Milo, was, I conceive, a wealthy Burgess of Ludlow early in the thirteenth century. At the Assizes of 1203, Andrew fitz MUo was amerced 20*. for breach of some Assize, and the Pipe-RoU of 1204 informs us that it was the Assize of Cloth (assiza pannorum), a manu facture then confined to Borough Towns. This Andrew fitz Milo, as weU as his son Nicholas, being enfeoffed in Stoke Say Mill, granted 10*. issuing therefrom to Haughmond Abbey, as I have 6 Vol. I, p. 80, 81. \" Kirby's Quest.

I also find Nicholas fitz Andrew, with Geoffrey and James his Brothers, attesting a grant to the same Abbey, which I shall give under Upper Ashford. In the Ludlow Inquisition of 1255 we find Nicholas fitz Andrew as Tenant of a Shop in Ludlow, for which he paid 1 lb. of Cumin as rent to the Lords of the Vill. At the same time Geoffrey Andreu was Foreman of the Ludlow Jury, and Nicholas fitz Andrew of Ludlow was on the Jury for Munslow Hundred, and was William Mauduit's Tenant at Clee St. Margaret9 as well as in half Steventon. It was his tenure at Clee St. Marga ret which in 1256 brought Nicholas fitz Andrew into collision with the Lord of The Heath.10 I have already alluded, under Stokesay, to one matter in which Nicholas fitz Andrew was at this time con cerned, and to another which involved some minor interest in Ste venton.11 In 1259 Nicholas Andrew was on the Inquisition, after the death of WUUam de StuteviU. In 1266 he was himself dead ; for early in that year SibU and Joanna his daughters were suing John his son for disseizing them of a tenement in Steventon.12 These Plaintiffs fined half a merk in August to have a second Writ ap pending a different Justiciar to try this matter.13 An entry on the Assize-RoU of 1267 exhibits Dulce and Cecily, daughters of Thomas le Waleys, recovering a messuage and half virgate in Stevinton from several Undertenants, viz. William le Pescur, Geoffrey fitz Andrew, John fitz Nicholas, Geoffrey atte Walle, and Nicholas fitz Herbert. The four first had called John Andreu to warranty. John Andrew pleaded in vain that Thomas le Waleys had only died seized of 2*. rent in Stevinton, while Nicholas fitz Herbert in vain asserted that the said Thomas had enfeoffed his Father Herbert. The consequent losses of his Under tenants were ordered to be made good by John Andrew.14 How ever, a later entry gives Dulcia la Walesche and Cecilia her Sister quitting all claim in the premises to John Andreu and Nicholas fitz Herbert.16 The consideration does not appear. The Successor of John Andrew, both at Clee St. Margaret and in his moiety of Steventon, was Master William Andrew, a Clerk, and perhaps John's son. The Feodary of 1284 calls him William Ondreu, and states his tenure at Steventon as coordinate with that of Nicho las Eyldrich. All that I have further to say of Master William Andrew has been said under Clee St. Margaret.16 Ill, dorso. 9 \u2022 I0 Supra, Vol. IV, pp. 77, 16. 11 Supra, p. 38. 14 \u2022 15 Assizes, 51 Hen.

On the death of Edmund de Mortimer in 1304 Adam de la Sete was his Tenant of a Knight's-fee in Sete.6 Of Undertenants in this Manor I can only name several who were involved in litigation at the Assizes of 1256. Colemann de Ludlow (who has occurred under Stokesay as Coleman le Blund or le Whyte\") claimed as heir of his deceased Uncle, another Colemann de Ludlow, the following, viz. a messuage and 44 acres in Sete, half a virgate in Wetlington, a messuage and 2 acres in Stokes (Stoke say). The Tenants whom he sued were Juliana, his Uncle's widow, Adam de Stok, William Coterel, Simon Holegod, Henry MUde (probably MUe), Herbert de Led wych, Alicia Meyle, Isolda laNune, the Master of St. John's Hospital at Ludlow, Adam fitz David, and Roger brother of Stephen le Walsse. One of these Tenants, the Widow JuUana, showed that the Plaintiff ought to be her Warrantor for her dower, viz. as hen of her deceased husband ; Alicia Meyle said that Colemann de Ludlow Senior did not die seized of the premises, but had a son, a third Colemann, to whom he gave them, and that the latter conceded them to herself and aU the other Tenants. The Jury found that Colemann, Senior, died seized, and that his Nephew was his heir. So all the Tenants were non-suited and in misericordid, except JuUana, who was dismissed sine die.8 In another cause at the same Assizes, Juliana de Sete (probably the same widow), and Nicholas de Haselour with Christiana his wife, sued Colemann de Ludlow for disseizing JuUana of a ninth part of a messuage, and for disseizing Nicholas and Christiana of a whole messuage in Sete. The Plaintiffs got judgment.9 Some later law proceedings which concerned many of the parties above mentioned, included lands in Stokesay, Whettlinton, Steventon, and Sheet, and have been given under Stokesay.

The old value ofthe Manor was 10*. (per annum) ; after wards it was worth 5*. Now it is worth 10s.\"2 Turstin, Mortimer's Tenant at Huntington and elsewhere, was, I think, identical with the person caUed Turstin de Wigmore in other passages of Domesday. We have seen under Cleobury Mortimer that Turstin de Wigmore was originaUy Earl WilUam fitz Osbern's Feoffee in that Manor, but that when it came to form a part of the Barony of Mortimer, Turstin was removed. Probably Mortimer gave him Huntington, Lingen, and Shirley, instead ; for of these three Manors Turstin was Mortimer's Tenant in 1086. It is pro bable also that Turstin held something (undeclared in Domesday) in the Chatellany of Wigmore, whence he took his distinctive name. But these are not all the antecedents of Turstin de Wigmore. In the reign of Edward the Confessor, and while Earl Godwin and his son Harold were in exile, there was one Osbern, probably a Norman, holding the two Herefordshire Manors of Burghill and Hope of the King. This Osbern was Uncle (avunculus) of Alured de Merle berge, which Alured was also Lord of a large Manor in Hereford shire during the Confessor's reign. On the ascendency of the Nor mans being established in Herefordshire, Alured de Merleberge was greatly enfeoffed by Earl WiUiam fitz Osbern, who gave him a number of estates which had been Earl Harold's. On the forfeiture of the Earls of Hereford, King William allowed all WUUam fitz Osbern's grants to Alured de Merleberge. From this and other favours Alured de Merleberge figures in Domesday as one of the greater Tenants in capite of Herefordshire aud Wiltshire, and also as holding Manors in Surrey, Hampshire, and Somersetshire. His Tenant for some land in Ewias, for the Manors of Stratford in Herefordshire, and part of Chenete in WUtshire, was Turstin, and Domesday gives us further particulars of the relations of Lord and Vassal. Turstin de Wigmore had married Agnes the daughter of Alured de Merleberge, which Agnes is said herself to be holding Cuure (Cowarne Magna), and a large Manor, unnamed, in Tornelaus 1 This word is underlined, and Bovarii I (Neat-herds) written over in correction. \"\u25a0 Domesday, so. 256, b, 2."], [101, "75 HUNTINGTON. Hundred, at the time of Domesday, and under her Father.8 When I add to all this that Turstin held Stanford under Roger de Laci, eight carucates in the Chatellany of Carleon under William de Scohies, and Merchelai under Turstin fitz Rolf,4 it is plain that Turstin de Wigmore was a man of great connections and wealth at the time of Domesday, even supposing that oue or two of these entries relate to another person. Now this Turstin de Wigmore is said by Genealogists to have been Ancestor of the great Herefordshire family of Lingen ; an as sertion which is backed by one main consideration, viz. that the Lingens are found in the thirteenth century to be holding under Mortimer precisely the same Manors which Turstin de Wigmore held under Mortimer in the eleventh. I do not indeed find the Lingens succeeding to the estates which Turstin held under others than Mortimer at Domesday, but I find them asserting claims to very great estates which they never recovered. Of this however hereafter. The Genealogists, I should observe, who derive the Lingens from Turstin de Wigmore, have further identified the latter with Turstin the Flandrian. This, if not an error, would go far to annihilate the descent of the Lingens assumed above, for Turstin Flandrensis suffered exile and total forfeiture,5 and consequently transmitted nothing to any English descendants. If however this forfeiture were anterior to Domesday, and I think it was,6 then the identity of Turstin Flandrensis and Turstin de Wigmore is impossible. For nearly a century after Domesday I hear nothing of the Lin gens or any other descendants of Turstin de Wigmore. Previous to the year 1182 one Ralph de Lingein had been put in charge in Dor setshire for a Fine of 100 merks due to the Crown.

At Domes day Oidelard held it under Ralph de Mortimer, which looks as if Turstin's for feiture was before Domesday. It is true that Turstin the Flandrian attests a Char ter at Salisbury in January 1103, in pre sence of Henry I, and in behalf of Philip de Braose (Monasticon, VII, 1083) ; but it does not foUow from this attestation that the said Turstin was not an Alien at the time. 4 Elsewhere caUed Turstin fitz Rollo, or Turstin fitz Rou le Blanc. He bore Duke William's Gonfanon at the Battle of Hastings, and appears as a Domesday Landholder in several Counties besides Herefordshire. \u2014 Mr. Blakeway mentions him as the re puted Ancestor of the famUy of SoUars ; but on what authority I know not. 5 Monasticon, I, 594. 6 Turstin the Flandrian was Lord of"], [102, "76 HUNTINGTON. de Maisi. In 1182 this charge is transferred to the Herefordshire Pipe-Roll, obviously because Ralph de Lingein was resident in that County. I find the fuU sum of 100 merks charged against Ralph de Lingein on the Herefordshire Pipe- Rolls of the next seven years, its non-payment being explained by a note to the effect that he had never been able to get to trial in the matter of his claim.7 Mean- time the Shropshire Pipe-RoU of 1183 gives Ralph de Lingein as amerced half a merk at the recent Assizes; \u2014 the Herefordshire Pipe-Roll of 1185 gives Ralph de Linguein as similarly amerced in the current year for unjust disseizin ; and the Worcestershire Pipe- Roll of 1186 gives Ralph de Lingein as amerced on a third and later occasion half a merk for disseizin. Again in 1188 Robert Marmion and his associates visiting Shropshire amerced Ralph de Linguein 20*. for novel disseizin, and the fine was paid. So far as the Tradition is true which represents a Lingen to have been con- cerned in the Foundation of Lymbroke Nunnery in Herefordshire, this Ralph de Lingen wiU have been the person aUuded to.8 He is said in a Genealogy of much apparent probabUity to have been suc ceeded by a Son, Grandson, and Great Grandson, aU named John. It would certainly appear that soon after 1189 Ralph de Lingen was succeeded by a son or other heir, \u2014 John de Lingen. The latter occurs on the Wiltshire Pipe-Roll of 1196 as fining 100 merks to have trial (pro habendo redo) in respect of his share in fifteen knights'-fees in Eilun and Pedon and Stana, against Robert, son of Robert de Maisi. I have not even discovered where the places thus mentioned were, much less have I attempted to ascertain any genealogical bearings which the claims thus set up in two successive generations may possibly have. Such inquiries would involve me far too deeply in the history of distant Counties. Some time previous to the year 1222 John de Lingene had en feoffed Ralph de Cambray in a virgate in Aschford (probably Ash ford Jones) ;\u2014 but one Walter fitz Odo had sued Ralph de Cambray for the same. The latter called John de Lingene to warranty, and John de Lingene had been obUged to concede the same by fine to the said Walter fitz Odo. Consequently upon this, Ralph de Cam bray sued John de Lingene for a virgate in Aschford in exchange of ' Sed nondum habuit rectum, vel habere potuit (Rot. Pip. 1 Rich. I, p. 142). s Monasticon, IV, 182. I should add, in confirmation of the Legend which at tributes the foundation of Lvmbroke to a Lingen, that at the Dissolution the Nuns had lands in Shirley, Amestrey, Cowarne Magna, and Lingen ; \u2014 in aU which places we can trace a previous interest of the Lingens."], [103, "77 HUNTINGTON. the one which he had failed to warrant. It would appear that John de Lingene had no such virgate to grant ; so by a Fine levied in Easter Term 1222 he gives to Ralph a virgate in Huntiton, half of which was held by Osbert Cailac, and half by Adam Carlis ; \u2014 to hold to Ralph and his heirs in fee, together with two other virgates which Ralph had previously held of John cle Lingene. The whole was to be held by service of one-seventh part of a knight's-fee. For this John de Lingene remitted a rent of four ducks, which Ralph had been used to pay him for 3 acres in the sa,me~vill? I am unable to date a Deed whereby this John de Lingen, or one of his successors, grants land in Wigmore to Helias fitz Harald. The Deed is attested by Brian de Brompton and Roger de Langaburgh.10 I should not quote it but that it shows the Lingens to have had lands in the Lordship of Wigmore, and so accounts for their pre sumed Ancestor being called Turstin de Wigmore. John de Lingen, perhaps the second of his name, had a transac tion in November 1236 with his Suzerain, Ralph de Mortimer. The particulars relate to land at Lingen itself, where they shall be given. The same John in 1240 is said to hold half a fee in Lin gaine under Mortimer,11 and about that time we have seen him at testing two deeds which bore upon his Patron's interests.13 In Ja nuary 1243 we have John de Lingaine holding half a hide under the Abbey of Lanthony in Gloucestershire. It was at Kenchester (Here fordshire), and had previously belonged to the honour of Snodhull.13 Also at Kovenhop (Conhope), Herefordshire, he was Mesne-Lord of a fourth part of a knight's-fee, Mortimer of Wigmore being his Seigneur.14 A Covenant dated July 31, 1253, arranges the terms on which Grimbald, son and heir of Sir Richard Pancefot, was to wed Constance the daughter of Sir John de Lingayn. I refer else where for the' particulars of a tale of female devotion which is said to have formed a sequel to this marriage.15 Beauty, love, and hero ism are transcendently associated with the name of Constance de Lingen ; and though a Critic might carp at one or other feature of her story, its substantive truth is supported by circumstances of much general probabUity. The Inquisition of Munslow Hundred in 1255 teUs us of John de Lingenie holding Huntiton of Roger de Mortimer. He did suit 9 Pedes Finium, 6 Hen. Ill, Salop. 10 Liber Niger de Wigmore : Tit.

Within the next ten years Sir John de Lingen stands first witness of two important deeds already set forth.17 In 1259 and 1260 he was chief of the Commissioners (Dictators they are called) who were nominated by the King to preserve the truce with LeweUyn. Patents of October 15, 1259, and January 14, Febru ary 25, and May 28, 1260, instruct John de Lingen and his as sociates as to their proceedings in this trust, particularly as to their obtaining satisfaction from the Welsh for certain breaches of the truce and other trespasses.18 In Easter Term 1283, I find Walter de Pedwardine suing Ralph de Lingeyn and others for trespass at Bereford,19 but I cannot say whether this Ralph was head of his family. In 1297 John de Lin geyne was one of those who held lands or rents in Shropshire of the annual value of \u00a320. and upwards, and so was summoned with horses and arms for Foreign Service, the Muster being fixed for July 7, at London.20 The same John, in 1301, was summoned from Herefordshire for military service against the Scots, the Muster being fixed for June 24, at Berwick upon Tweed.21 In March 1316 John de Lingeyne was one of the Lords of the several Vills of Cre denhUl, Conhope, and Leye, in Herefordshire;22 and in 1324 Sir John Lyngeyne, Knight, was among those summoned from Herefordshire to attend a Great CouncU, to be held at Westminster, on May 30. M The principal Underte nancy in Huntington was that of the family of Cambray. As early as 1199 Ralph de Cambray occurs as having been amerced half a merk for the unlawful erection of some fence.24 This Ralph was probably the same person with him whom I have already mentioned as John de Lingen's Tenant here in 1222. In 1237 WUliam de Cambray accounts to the Sheriff for half a Fine of one merk which he had proffered for having some seizin, unspecified by the Record.24 His sureties were John de Lin gede (Lingen) and Odo de Hodenet. Again in 1249 William de Cambray accounts for a larger Fine, viz. 20 merks, which he had given for some Inquisition to be had.24 His Sureties were Geoffrey de Ledwych, Hugh Carbonel, and two others.

The ground of the third does not appear. In the same year he was amerced 20*. for a false oath. In this year (1259) we have mention of another Undertenant here, viz. Robert de Huntin don, who was amerced 3*. 4d. for not producing one for whom he was pledge.24 On August 11, 1266, Nicholas de Brumfield has a Writ of novel disseizin against William de Huntinton and Aldith, widow of Robert de Huntinton, concerning a tenement in Huntinton. 8sj)tati or &s!)forti 3ont%.

The trial was by Grand- Assize, and the question was whose was the better right. The Sureties of Ralph de Cambrai were John Car bonel and Reginald de Eisford. There is a note appended to the recital of this case, purporting that the Tenant had called John de Lingen to warranty in the County Court ; that the said John had failed in warranty, and was therefore summoned to appear at War wick, whither the Justiciars were proceeding.3 The sequel I have given under Huntington. Reginald de Ashford, just now named, seems to have been Bur ley's Chief Tenant here, for John de Esseford, who is said in 1240 to hold half a fee in Esseford, under Ralph de Mortimer,4 was son of Reginald ; but that his tenure was not immediately under Mor timer is proved by the Munslow Inquisition of 1255, which says that John son of Reginald holds Upper Asford of Simon de Bur leg. It contained a hide-and-half, \u2014 the Domesday estimate : did suit to Munslow Hundred, and paid 186?. per annum for stretward and motfee. John fitz Reginald was on the Jury which made this report.5 In 1256 John de Esseford was returned among those who holding twenty librates of land were not knights. In 1259 I find a second Reginald de Asford sitting as a Juror on the Inquest after WUUam de StutevUl's death ; but I cannot say positively that this Reginald was of Upper Ashford. Notwithstanding Ralph de Cambray's failure in keeping posses sion of that virgate in Ashford in which he had been enfeoffed by John de Lingen, it would appear that his successor at Huntington, viz. WiUiam de Cambray, had an interest also in Ashford. Nay, the latter actually styles himself WUUam de Cambray of Asford in a Charter whereby, about the year 1250, he granted to Haugh mond Abbey, for the souls' -health of his Ancestors and Heirs, a rent of 126?. arising out of land in Asford, which MUo of Little Hereford held of the Grantor. The witnesses hereto were Hugh CarboneU, Henry de Budlers, John de Asforde, Nicholas fitz An drew, Geoffrey and James his brothers.6 On May 19, 1284, a Fine was levied between John Mauveysin and IsabeUa his wife, Plaintiffs, and WUUam de Mortimer, Defor- 3 Assizes, 6 Hen.

They held it immediately of the King, and the following is its description in Domesday. \" The same Osbern (fitz Richard) holds Esseford. Ledi held it (in Saxon times). Here are ii hides geldable.

Carbonel was unquestionably a Norman name,2 and the Domes day Survey gives us one Carbonel as then holding a Herefordshire Manor (Lacre) of the King in capite? In the next century there was one Geoffrey Carbonel, of whom all that we know is, that his son WUUam asserted him in 1203 to have died seized of half a hide in the Manor of Harcott.4 We have seen William Carbonel (the same son of Geoffrey, I presume) attesting, as William Carb de Hese fordia (WUliam Carbonel of Heseford or Ashford) a Charter of the \" Compare the Eine given under Nash (supra, Vol. IV, p. 332). 2 Stapleton's Sot.

In Easter Term 1200 he was one of the twelve knights who formed the Jury noticed under Nordley Regis ;8 and in 1210 a Feodary of the Ho nour of Richard's Castle has William Carbunel as holding half a fee therein.9 Consistently with all this we have had William Car bonel attesting Geva de Tenbury's grant to Haughmond Abbey before 1185 ;10 also attesting a deed of Hugh de Ferrars between 1196 and 1204. A Deed too of Robert de Mortimer, between 1209 and 1219, confirming several grants to Haughmond Abbey, has the attestation of William Carbonel. Lastly, the Grant of Herbert de Tenbury's daughters, given under Cornewood, has the attestation of William Carbonel and of John and Pagan his sons.10 In November 1221 William Carbonel was dead, for John and Pagan Carbonel, brothers and knights, appear as Jurors of certain causes tried at Shrewsbury. John Carbonel, the eldest of these brothers, appears again in August 1226 among the chief knights of the County, who then made Inquisition concerning the Forest of Stiperstones. Of Pain Carbonel I shall hereafter speak under Wooferton. The Feodary of Richard's Castle, which I account to have been drawn up about 1230, gives Pain Carbonel as living; but John Carbonel was apparently dead, for Hugh Carbonel, whom 5 Vol. II, p. 67, note. a knight on horseback, charging sword in hand.

It contained 1| hides (the Domesday estimate), did suit to Munslow Hundred, and paid 186?. annually for stretward and motfee.13 In 1256 Hugh Carbonel was one of those who held fifteen librates of land in this County and was not yet a Knight. In 1259 he was a Juror in the Inquest taken on the death of WiUiam de Stutevill. Before November 1266 Hugh Carbonel was deceased, leaving a widow, Joanna, and a successor, doubtless his son, Richard Carbonel. Joanna and Richard were then sued respectively for one-third and two-thirds of a virgate in Asseford, but the case was adjourned. The Plaintiffs were Geoffrey, son of Geoffrey le Tayleur, and William de la Val with his wife Joan ; and their Essoignors were William fitz Roger, Robert fitz William, and Robert de Furche.14 Richard Carbonel was, in 1265-6, one ofthe witnesses of Hugh de Mortimer's Char- ter to the Burgesses of Burford. Hugh Carbonel having slain Philip de Grete, a Patent of the year 1267 directs certain Justiciars to try whether the act were one of self-defence. This Hugh I take to have been younger brother of Richard Carbonel of Ashford. The latter was on the Jury for Munslow Hundred at the Assizes of September 1272, and on a Ludlow Inquest in January 1284. The Feodary of 1281 gives him as holding Asford Carbonel for half a knight's-fee, under Robert de Mortimer. In 1287 this tenure is repeated, only, as I have said under Overton, that vill was held by Richard Carbonel jointly with Ashford Carbonel.15 The whole tenure was estimated at 100*. per annum. The Inquisition taken on the death of Matilda de Mortimer, in April 1308 gives Hugh Carbonel (probably son of Richard) as then holding the Manors of Aysford Carbonel and Overtone by half a knight's-fee.16 The same Vas Lord of the Vill of Ashford when, in March 1316, the Return caUed the Nomina Villarum was made.17 THE CHURCH.

The Church (now a Perpetual Curacy annexed to the Vicarage of Little Hereford) was doubtless founded as a Chapel, and in strict subjection to the Mother-Church. The date of such foundation I can by no means indicate. The non-mention of the Chapel in Records of the thir teenth century is by no means conclusive as to its non-existence at that or an earlier period. jflttitileton With this Manor we introduce a series of four Manors in Cul vestan Hundred which WiUiam Pantulf held at Domesday under the Earl of Shrewsbury. \u2014 \" The same William (Pantulf) holds Middeltone, and Berner (holds it) of him.

Helgot was his Succes sor in a less number of cases. The bulk of WUliam Pantulf's Shrop shire estates lay in and around Wem, where I shall speak more fully of his origin and descendants. His Manors in South Shropshire seem mostly to have been disunited from his Barony, a fact to which I have already adverted in two instances2 and which will now ap pear yet further in detail. Berner, Pantulf's Tenant at Middleton, was, as I have said, almost surely the Ancestor of the Hugfords, but the Hugfords are not found at any later period to hold Middle ton under Pantulf. They held it first under Lacy, then under Fitz Alan. The four fees of old feoffment which in 1165 were held by Nicholas de Hungerford under Hugh de Lacy were unquestion ably Higford (two fees), Middleton (one fee), and Upper Ledwich (one fee) . Higford was of Lacy's seigneury at Domesday, Middle ton and Upper Ledwich were not. The question is then as to why Domesday, so. 257, b. 1. | - Vol. IV, pp. 27, 189."], [111, "85 MIDDLETON HIGFORD. these two last fees passed to Lacy. Now I can hardly suggest that they were given to Lacy in compensation for certain dismember ments of his Fief, which took place during the forfeiture of his House. In that case they would scarcely have been classed as fees of old feoffment. I rather thiilk that they must have been allotted to Lacy early in Henry I's time. It was obviously the policy as well as the practice of our Kiugs, to maintain a coordinate share in the government and disposition of the greater Castles of the King dom. Ludlow Castle came into being shortly after Domesday. The Crown was interested in its maintenance and security, so long as its Lords were loyal. The territorial arrangements of Domesday had been made with no apparent prospect of this Castle being built. The King, in respect of the loyalty of the first Hugh de Lacy, or in remembrance of the disloyalty of his predecessor, or with a view to the strengthening of Ludlow Castle and the maintenance of his own influence there, may have procured from William Pantulf the re signation of one of his Manors in South Shropshire, in order that competent ward might be provided for this great fortress. Such ward was afterwards due at Ludlow from the Manor of Middleton, and I know not how the obligation can have arisen, save by inter ference of the Crown. That from owing service to Ludlow this Manor came to be reputed as of Lacy's Fief, is a process by no means unintelligible. Thus much as regards the treatment of a single Manor. \u2014 The po licy of the Crown being admitted as obvious, viz. to qualify the ab solute control of any great Feudatory over a given Fortress, that policy may be shown to have had a wide practical range ;\u2014 for cer tain Manors, which were not of Lacy's original Fief and which never became (even nominally) annexed thereto, owed ward at Ludlow,3 whilst on the other hand, several Manors4 which were originaUy of Lacy's Fief, and one which became annexed thereto,5 were charged with Castle-Guard at Montgomery. The next that we hear of Middleton must be understood to in clude Higford and Upper Ledwich. AU three were given by Hugh de Lacy about the year 1175 to WUliam fitz Alan (II), who then married the daughter of the said Hugh. Henceforth then these Manors were held by the Hugfords under Fitz Alan, and formed the four knights'-fees which in 1240 Walter de Huggeford is said to 3 Viz. Kenley, Henley, and Great Sutton. 4 Viz.

It did suit to Munslow Hundred. In 1270 Robert de W * * re and Katherine his wife sue WiUiam de Hugeford for novel disseizin in Middelton. In 1271 John de Middleton (a tenant probably of Hugford's) has a similar writ against Walter de Fenes and others. In January 1272 Isabella, widow of Richard Huberd, was suing WiUiam de Hugford for her dower in 30 acres, and was suing Adam Huberd for her dower in a messuage and 1^ virgates in Middleton. William de Hugford, having had, I suppose, some surrender from Richard Huberd, sued Adam Huberd, probably Richard's heir, in a plea of warranty. Adam Huberd, as against Isabella, called WUliam Paternoster to warranty and sued him thereupon.9 Both cases were adjourned. At the Assizes of September 1272, the said IsabeUa accorded both suits, in what way does not appear. The thirds sought against Hugford are said to be of 24 acres, against Adam Hubert, of two messuages and two virgates.10 The Feodary of 1284 gives WiUiam de Hugford as holding Mid delton under the heir of Fitz Alan for a whole knight's-fee, the said hen holding it of the King. Some other particulars of Hugford's interest here I have given under Higford.11 At the Assizes of 1292 William de Hugford was reported by the Munslow Jurors as a De faulter in due attendance. The Chapel of Middleton, whenever founded, was in subjection to Bitterley. However, the Priory of Wenlock is said to have had the tithes of Hugford Myddylton from ancient time,12 though then value is not stated.

He (Pantulf) found it waste.\" 1 As regards its Saxon Owner Uluric, its Domesday Lords, William Pautulf and Berner, its transfer to Lacy and then to Fitz Alan, and the descent of Berner's interest to De Hugford, the early history of Upper Ledwich is exactly that of Middleton Higford. The subsequent difference between the two was that while Mid dleton came to be charged with service at Ludlow Castle, Upper Ledwich owed a similar service at Montgomery. Under Rudge, Abdon, and Cleeton, I have given some particulars of a family which took its name from this place. These Ledwiches were De Hugford's Tenants in this Manor. The first of whom I hear is Roger de Ledewic, who attests in 1120 a Charter cited under Beckbury.2 Next comes Geoffrey de Ledewich, amerced 2 merks in 1185 for unjust disseizin, and who also has occurred to us in 1197.3 Before Easter, 1203, this Geoffrey was dead, for a Suit at West minster, between his widow (here called Hawise) and Walter de Huggeford, is entered on a Roll of that Term as settled by accord. However, another suit arose between the same parties wherein the Widow's name is several times written as Juliana. Hugford sued her at the Salop Assizes of October 1203, for custody of half the vill of Ledwic. She did not appear tiU the Justices-in-Eyre had reached Gloucester. There Hugford's Attorney (Warin) claimed 3 Supra, Vol. Ill, p. 205. 1 Domesday, so. 257, b, 1. - Supra, Vol. IV, p. 133."], [114, "88 UPPER LEDWICH. the custody of the premises for his Principal as having the ward ship of Geoffrey de Ledwic, infant son of Geoffrey deceased, which latter had held both Ledwic and other lands under Hugford. Ju liana replied that the moiety of Ledewic in dispute was her dower, which her infant Son aforesaid ought of right to Warrant to her. Hugford's Attorney rejoined that it was not her dower, for she had for dower the land of Clie,4 and had held it days and years since her husband's death, and thereof he produced evidence. The cause was further adjourned to Oxford, where Hugford's Attorney was to pro duce the Ward, without whom, as her Warrantor, Juliana would not plead further. She named Roger de Mora as her Attorney.5 We have seen Geoffrey de Ledwich (II) to have been of age in 1222,6 and occurring at Abdon7 and Rudge from 1226-7 to 1240. Geoffrey de Ledwich, who in 1248 was Surety for WiUiam de Cam bray's fine, and who in 1251 fines one merk for some Writ, was per haps identical with the last-named Geoffrey, but, as I have shewn under Cleeton, Geoffrey de Ledwich (II) was deceased in 1253, leav ing a Widow, Agnes, and a son and heir, Geoffrey. Nor were the differences before recited between the Widow and the Heir confined to Cleeton, for in the same year Agnes, widow of Geoffrey de Lede wic, aUeges a disseizin in Ledewic against Geoffrey de Ledewic. The Inquisition of 1255 says that \" Geoffrey de Ledewich holds Ledewich of Walter de Huggeford. It contained n hides (its Domesday measurement), and did suit to Munslow Hundred, and paid the King 2*. for stretward and motfee.\"9 Here the Seigneury of Fitz Alan, over Hugford, is not expressed, probably because the entry follows that of Middleton, where the higher Tenure had been set forth. However, the same Record informs us that Geoffrey de Ledewich was bound to find one soldier to do ward at Montgomery for forty days in time of war, and that the said service was in arrear.8 This, as I have already intimated, is very consistent with the idea that Upper Ledwich had been sometime of Lacy's Fief, though now annexed to Fitz Alan's. In 1256 Geoffrey de Ledewyz was one of those who, holding 15 librates of land in Shropshire, were not yet Knighted. At the Assizes of this year, Agnes de Ledwic names Ralph de Arras, or Thomas de Ledwic, her Attorney, against Geof frey de Ledwic, and the latter was found to have disseized Agnes of 4 Perhaps something at Cleeton, adja cent to the Titterstone Clee HU1. 3 dorso. c \u25a0 1 Supra, Vol. Ill, p. 56, and IV, 129. 8 Rot.

It would seem from a Deed already set forth,10 that he had not attained that rank in 1260, or later. At the Forest Assizes of February 1262, Geoffrey de Ledewych was accused of having taken a Doe (damam) on Tuesday after the Invention of the Cross, 1257. The Feodary of 1284 gives Geoffrey de Ledewich as holding the vill of Ledewich by a knight's-fee under William de Hugford, omit ting Fitz Alan's seigneury ; \u2014 for the same reason, I presume, as the Record of 1255. At the Assizes of 1292, Geoffrey de Ledwich was reported by the Jurors of Munslow Hundred as a Defaulter in due attendance.11 The Chapel. \u2014 This Chapel must be taken to have been origi nally dependent upon Bitterley, the Parish into which the now Churchless district has returned. Nevertheless, the Church of Lede wych, as it is caUed in the Taxation of 1291, is mentioned without any appearance of dependency, though worth less than \u00a34. per an num12 It was, Uke Bitterley, in the Deanery of Ludlow. The as sessment of the Ninth in 1341 makes the Taxation of the Chapel of Ledewych to be 6 merks, i. e. \u00a34. The Assessors rated the Parish only 4*. to the current impost, because, said they, \" the Parish was annexed to the Church of Butterley, and taxed to its true value together with the same.\" Nothing in fact belonged to Ledewych Chapel but a bovate of land for the sustenance of a Chaplain who said mass on Sundays, and who also had the offerings of the Vill on one day in the year.13 The Valor of 1534-5 takes no notice of a Chapel here, and I suppose it was either destroyed or unserved.

The Manor (in King Edward's time) was worth 3*. (per annum) . Now it is worth 9*. He (Pantulf) found it waste.\"1 William Pantulf lost the Seigneury of this Manor at some early but unrecorded period, not I think by forfeiture, but by some arrange ment with the Crown ; an idea already suggested in the cases of Middleton, Higford, and Upper Ledwich. However, the King did not assign this Manor to Lacy's Fief, but made it a Serjeantry, and the next that we hear of it is its being held under the Crown by a family which took name from the place and discharged the service presently to be mentioned. Thomas de Sudton, a Recognizor in October 1199, in the suit mentioned under Clee St. Margaret, may have been one of these Tenants by Serjeantry. If so, he was the earhest I can name. More surely Osbert de Sutton, amerced half a merk in 1207, was of this place, and perhaps identical with that Osbert de Sutton whom we have seen in the following year to renounce a claim and a tenure in Boraston.2 But in 1211 William de Sutton was registered as one of the King's Tenants by Serjeantry, his duty being to accompany 14 That is, Sheriffs-Ledwich; but why this place was so distinguished it is difficult to say. I can only observe suggestively that WiUiam fitz Alan (II) who acquired the Seigneury from Lacy was Sheriff of Shropshire from 1190 tUl 1201. 1 Domesday, so. 257, b, 1. 5 Supra, Vol. IV, pp. 326-7."], [117, "91 LITTLE SUTTON. the Sheriff, twice in each year, whea the latter conveyed the ferm of the County to the Exchequer. The King, however, paid William de Sutton's expenses.3 William de Sutton was succeeded, apparently before the year 1215, by Robert de Sutton, whose Tenure is stated in an Assize-Roll of 1227 to be 2 merkates of land in Sutton, held by service of finding one horse to convey the King's treasure towards London twice a year.4 This Robert de Sutton commenced in 1215 and continued till 1239, a series of feoffments in his Serjeantry; \u2014 that is, he alienated several small parcels of land to Undertenants, and apparently without license. In 1240 and 1245 his son and successor, Osbert de Sutton, continued these alienations. I have already given some account of the steps taken by the Crown in 1246 and 1247 against the Aliena tors of Serjean tries in general, and those of Shropshire in particu lar.5 Robert Passelewe, the King's Commissioner, visited Shrop shire probably about March 1247. His Arrentation, as it is called, of Osbert de Sutton's Serjeantry, is a lengthy document, but very instructive as to the mode of his procedure. He found eight greater and five lesser alienations in Little Sutton, besides the small residue which we may suppose to have remained to Osbert de Sutton. Other Records inform us of one or two alienations of which Passelewe's RoU takes no notice. The whole matter was treated as follows : \u2014 First the Record recites that \" the Serjeantry of Osbert de Sutton, in Sutton (for which he should provide for the King a horse with a head-stall (capistro) to convey the King's treasure yearly at Michael mas from Shrewsbury to London) is alienated in part.\" Then fol low the names of the five lesser Tenants whose collective holdings were 1 Bovate and 22 (or 20) acres, of the annual value of 4*. 96?. For these lesser Tenants, and by their consent, Osbert de Sutton covenanted to pay an annual rent to the Crown of 2*.,6 to be repaid him ratably by the said Tenants. Also, and I suppose in lieu of his former Serjeantry, Osbert himself was to perform the service of a fiftieth part of a Knight's-fee. As to the eight greater Tenants, they fined with Passelewe individually and collectively: that is, they covenanted to pay several rents to the Crown, amounting altogether to 18*. per annum, and to discharge in common the service of one thirtieth part of a knight's-fee. Thus on the whole Osbert de Sut ton's Serjeantry was commuted for an annual rent of \u00a31., and the 3 Testa de Nevill, p. 56, and Liber 5 Supra, Vol. II, p. 144.

The Pipe RoU of 1250 charges the eight greater Tenants with 3\\ years' arrears of then rent, but omits all charge on Osbert de Sutton. An Assize-Roll, probably of the year 1251, enumerates the names of all the then Tenants, but calls Sutton anachronously the \" Fee of Sir Robert de Sutton.\"8 In 1254 the Aid for marrying the King's daughter was put in charge at the rate of 40*. on every Knight's-fee. Osbert de Sutton was charged 9^6?. on -fg of a Fee. The eight greater Tenants were not charged (as we should have expected) 166?. in common on of a fee, but 166?. each, as if they held ~ths of a fee. However, the whole was paid.9 The Hundred-Roll of 1255 says that Robert de Sutton (formerly) held Sutton for half-a-hide, of the King. It then recites his Serjeantry, as before stated, and intimates his hav ing owed suit to Munslow Hundred, which suit had been withdrawn two years before (i. e. in 1253) by Osbert son of the said Robert, whence a yearly loss of 2*. resulted to the Crown.10 In January 1259, Osbert de Parva Sutton, being dead, his Widow Alina sued several ofthe cotemporary Tenants for dower. The thirds claimed by her were seized pro tempore by the Crown;11 but the RoU which should contain a further hearing of the cause is lost. In 1260 the Scutage of Wales was assessed at 40*. per fee. The assessment of this Tenure thereto is copied verbatim from the assess ment of 1254. When therefore Osbert de Sutton's name stands charged with 9^6?. on -^th of a fee,13 this is no proof that he was living, and the same may be said of each of the eight Tenants. In fact we do not hear again of any interest retained here by descen dants of Osbert de Sutton. The lands of course remained charge able with the same mUitary service as before, and the Munslow Inquisition of November 1274 duly records the liabUity of divers tenants in Little Sutton to pay the King an annual rent of 20*. 13 From the Records already cited, when compared with and cor rected by each other, and from other sources, I now proceed to give a distinct account of each alienation of this Serjeantry and the de scent of each Feoffee therein. \u2014 1.

Passelewe's Arrentation in 1247 makes Robert de Cheles' tenement to be 1 bovate and 4 acres, worth 4*. 96?. annually. The rent and service to the Crown, then fixed on this Tenement, was included in the 2*. rent and -^th of a fee charge able upon Osbert de Sutton. In November 1249 Robert de Cheles was sued for half an acre in Little Sutton by Johanna and Lucia, daughters of Alexander Chaplain, who were Coparceners in another tenement.14 The result does not appear. Robert de Cheles is men tioned among the Tenants of 1251, and of 1255 ; but in the latter year his chief-rent of 1*., which had previously been paid through Osbert de Sutton, was paid at once to the Crown. Robert de Cheles was succeeded by his son Roger, probably in 1259, when an indistinct allusion to the relief payable on such succession occurs on the Rolls. This Roger had, in 1245, been enfeoffed by Osbert de Sutton in 4 acres at a rent of 1^6?. In 1260 Roger de Cheles takes out two writs, paying a merk and half for the same. One was probably against Richard de Millenhop and Edith his wife, who appoint an Attorney against him in the same year. I suppose that in succession to Roger de Cheles came Robert Cheles; for a Jury which sat at Great Sutton, on January 14, 1316, found that Robert Cheles had, in the time of King Edward I, held a messuage and 20 acres in Little Sutton by a rent of 10c?., payable to the Crown, and by making two appearances in a year at the Hundred-Court of Munslow. The premises were worth 7s. 6d. per annum. Margaret, Widow of Robert Cheles, now (that is, in 1316) held a third thereof, and fermed the other two thirds of the King. Richard Cheles, son and heir of Robert, was found to have been 21 years of age on January 25, 1315. 15 The latter occurs on a local Inquest in 1323. 2. William fitz Henry was enfeoffed by Robert de Sutton in 1215 for an annual rent of 4*., payable to the Feoffor. This rent among others Robert de Sutton conveyed, before 1240, to Henry the Moneyer (Monetario). William, son and heir of Henry the Moneyer quit-claimed this and other rents to the King \"before the Justices,\" and probably in 1247. The Arrentation of 1247 esti mates WUliam fitz Henry's tenement at half a virgate and nine acres, of 12*. annual value, but this probably included another tenement of 11 J acres, in which he had been enfeoffed between 1240 and 1247 by Osbert de Sutton at ld. rent. The Arrentation of 1247 fixes his Crown-rent at 4*. In Easter Term 1250 he was 14 Placita, Mich. Term, 33 and 34 Hon. Ill, m. 38 dorso. I 15 Inquisitions, 9 Edw.

The Plaintiffs alleged that William fitz Henry had no other ingress into the premises than by Osbert de Parva Sutton, to whom Alicia de Sutton, the Plaintiffs' Guardian, had demised the premises whUe the Plaintiffs were in ward. William fitz Henry replied that as to 8 acres he held them hy feoffment, not of Osbert de Sutton, but of Roger son of Robert de Stanton (a matter to which I shaU recur), and as to the two remaining acres he held them indeed by feoffment of Osbert, but Osbert had them, not from the said Alice, but from his own Father, \u2014 Robert de Sutton. A Jury of the Vicinage, to whom this matter was referred, verified WilUam fitz Henry's state ment, and the Plaintiffs were non-suited, but their amercement was excused on account of their poverty.16 In this year (1250) WiUiam fitz Henry, as one of the Greater Tenants of Sutton, was charged his Crown-rent of 4*. per annum, with the arrears then due. His name occurs on the list of Sutton Tenants in 1251. From the Hundred-Roll of 1255 it appears that his Crown -rent of 4*. was made up of two sums, viz. 2*. 66?. and 1*. 66?., chargeable respec tively on his feoffment of 1215, and on his more recent feoffment by Osbert de Sutton. To both the Aid of 1254, and the Scutage of 1260, WUliam fitz Henry was charged 166?. as on -jLth of a Knight's-fee. In January 1259 WUliam fitz Henry was one of those whom Osbert de Sutton's Widow sued for dower, viz. for thirds in 8 acres of his Tenure. WUliam fitz Henry must have lived to a great age ; for his earliest feoffment was in 1215, and the King's writ of diem clausit extremum on his death bears date August 26, 1278. The consequent Inquest found his tenure-in-cdpite at Sutton to be half a virgate and eight acres, and his rent to the Crown 4*. He also held twelve acres under Roger de Stanton, for which he paid a rent of 136?., whilst Roger in turn paid 126?. thereof to the Crown. His whole estate was worth 8*. 86?. per annum, and AVil liam his son and heir was of full age.17 In the same year I find William son of William fitz Henry, paying his relief as a Tenant in-capite, which is all I shall say of this Tenure. 3. William le Franceis was enfeoffed in 1215 by Robert de Sutton, whose reserved rent was 3*. This rent Robert de Sutton transferred to Henry the Moneyer, and William, Henry's son, quit claimed it to the King. The Arrentation of 1247 gives William le 16 Placita, Mich. Term, 34 and 35 Hen.

He fined for a rent of 2*. 66?. to the Crown, and was charged at that rate in 1250. To the Aid of 1254 he was assessed at -L-th of a fee. He was deceased before October 10, 1256, when the Inquisition on his death duly states him to have held 29 acres in capite, by service of 2*. 66?. rent. For other 2 acres held under Osbert de Sutton, for merly Lord of Sutton, he paid rent to said Osbert, and 1\u00ab?. to the King for Stretward. His son William was 26 years of age.18 To the scutage of 1260 WiUiam le Franceys is charged on -J^th of a fee ; but in the same year Margery, Juliana, and Alice, daughters and coheirs of William le Fraunceis, are registered as having fined 206?. each in 1258 for their relief of his inheritance. Either then the age of William le Franceys, Junior, was much understated at his Father's death, or these women were his Sisters. The estate seems eventually to have centred in Alice ; for a Writ of October 16, 1306, orders an Inquest to be taken on the death of Alisia 6?e Frense, and a Jury which met on October 31st, found that the De ceased had held 36 acres in capite at Sutton ; \u2014 that the service arrentated thereon was 2*. 66?. per annum ; \u2014 that the tenement was worth 13*. per annum, and that Roger le Frense was heir to the deceased, and upwards of 28 years of age.19 In April 1323 Roger le Frensh being dead, an Inquest taken at Munslow found him to have held a messuage and 30 acres in capite at 2*. 6s?. rent, and by service and suit at Munslow Hundred-Court every three weeks. WiUiam le Frensh his son was aged twenty-one on March 25, 1323.20 4. Roger de Girros was enfeoffed in 1225 by Robert de Sutton in half a virgate, for a reserved rent of 26?. Roger de Girros in 1231 transferred his interest to \u2014 William de Corne, on whom the Arrentation of 1247 sets a Crown-rent of 2*. 66?., valuing his tenement at 8*. per annum. Con sistent mention is made of William de Corne on the Pipe-Roll of 1250 as paying a rent of 2*. 6d. per annum, and on the Scutage Rolls of 1254 and 1260 as owing of a knight's-fee. Also on the Hundred-Roll of 1255 we have his tenure and rent duly stated; but I. hear no more of his family as connected with Sutton, and I think that their interest must have gone to some other Tenant. 5. Alexander the Chaplain, otherwise caUed Alexander de Thideliby, was enfeoffed in one virgate, at 36?. rent, by Robert de 18 Inquisitions, 40 Hen. Ill, No. 5.

He was dead in 1247, and no Arrentation was set upon his infant daughters, whose rights indeed seem to have been invaded by the other Tenants during their minority. In November 1249 Nicholas de la More was allowed at Westminster to sue John le King and others in behalf of the said Infants. Four suits fol- lowed, but in three cases out of the four the Defendants made out a good title, and the fourth case was adjourned. The list however of 1251 gives two maidens, Johanna and Lucia, among the Co- tenants of Sutton, so that they had either retained or regained something. The Hundred-Roll also of 1255 says that Johanna and Lucia, daughters and Grantees of Alexander the Chaplain, paid the King an annual rent of 3*. 4si?., which indicates a considerable in- terest. However, to Aid and Scutage they were never assessed in their own names. In 1256, as we shall see, another Tenant in Sut- ton recovered certain land against them. Again in Easter Term 1260 Nichola de Corfton was suing Johanna fitz Alexander, Lucia her Sister, William fitz Hugh, Geoffrey de Wychecot, Robert his son, and Richard Achilles, to oblige them to keep an agreement which they had made with Simon de London,21 Nichola's Brother, about 21 acres in Sutton and in Diddlebury. The Defendants faded to appear, and the case was adjourned to Michaelmas Term. Mean- time, that is in October 1259, I find Richard son of Roger Buffard suing Richard le Waleys for disseizin in Little Sutton. The cause, long unheard, eventually assumed another form. In August 1267 Richard Buffard sued several petty Tenants for 5 acres in Sutton, of which he asserted his Father Roger to have died seized. Ri- chard said that Lucia and Johanna, daughters of Alexander the Chaplain, having the premises in fee, had enfeoffed his Father, and then conceded them to Richard le Waleys. On the other hand it was shown that Roger Buffard had only had a nine-years' term in the premises from Lucia and Johanna. So Richard Buffard was non-suited.33 Another Suit of mort d'ancestre, which the same Ri- chard had against Geoffrey de Sutton for a quarter of an acre, was withdrawn.33 6. William Cheles was enfeoffed in a noke at a rent of 1\u00ab?. in 1231, and by Robert de Sutton. Perhaps he was dead in 1247; for WUliam de Cheles Junior was then Tenant of 16 acres, of 4*. annual value.

In Easter Term 1250 Cristina de Cheles was impleaded by Joanna and Lucia fitz Alexander for 4 acres in Parva-Sutton. In November following, Cristina, who was widow of WUUam de Cheles Senior, appeared in Court. The Plaintiffs sued under the same form as they sued William fitz Henry, viz. as having obtained ingress through Osbert de Sutton, etc. Cristina showed that she held one-third of the premises in dower, and two thirds as Guardian of her Son WiUiam. The case was adjourned till the said William should have attained his majority. The Pipe- RoU of 1250, the Tenant-list of 1251, the Hundred-Roll of 1255, the Assessments to the Aid and Scutage of 1254 and 1260, \u2014 all mention WUliam de Cheles as a Sutton Tenant. His rent to the Crown was 2*. ; his tenure too was assessed as -jVth of a Knight's fee. In January 1256 WUliam de Cheles, being apparently of age, sued Lucia and Johanna fitz Alexander for 6\\ acres, Ingretha Spich and Johanna de Corfton for 2 acres, and Elyas de Sutton for half an acre in Sutton. Elyas called WiUiam le Chapeleyn to warranty ; the latter caUed Johanna and Lucia, who therefore were the main Defendants in the case. WiUiam Cheyles recovered the whole, as his inheritance derived from his Father.33 7. Thomas de Baskerville was enfeoffed in 11 acres at 16?. rent, by Robert de Sutton in 1235. This was Thomas de Basker vUle of Pickthorn, Northwood, etc., of whom I have spoken so often, and who will recur again to us under Lawton. No Arrenta tion was set upon this Tenure in 1247, nor is it named on the Roll. However it stUl existed, for in 1251 Walter, son of Roger de Bas kerviUe, is entered on the list of Sutton Tenants ; \u2014 not quite accu rately perhaps ; for in 1255 Anastasia, relict of Roger son of Thomas de BaskerviUe, was holding this tenement in dower. 8. Robert de Stanton Lacy was enfeoffed in 30 acres, at 3d. rent, by Robert de Sutton in 1235. Robert de Stanton gave 18 acres of this estate to Nicholas fitz Reginald de Stanton. Moreover Roger, son of Robert de Stanton, gave the residue (here said to be 13 acres) to William fitz Henry before mentioned, reserving a rent of 5s.u thereon.

We have had an instance (Vol. IV, p^J, 33) where it was equivalent to a fourth part of a virgate, i. e. to 15 acres, accord ing to the usual estimate of the virgate in Shropshire. Here again we have the Bovate equal to from 12 to 14 acres. 11 V."], [126, "98 LITTLE SUTTON. in the Sutton Serjeantry. The then annual value of these tenures was 6*. 86?. and 4*., and an arrentation of 2*. and 1*. was set upon them respectively. The two sub-tenancies which thus arose I must speak of separately. \u2014 Nicholas de Stanton's alleged feoffment by Robert de Stanton before 1247 has to be reconciled with another fact. John le King was impleaded in Michaelmas Term 1249 by Johanna and Lucia fitz Alexander for 10 acres. In Michaelmas Term 1250 John le King showed that he was Tenant for life of these 10 acres, not having ingress therein through Osbert de Sutton, as the Plaintiffs alleged, but through Robert de Stanton, whose Deed he produced. The Jury confirmed this statement, and the Plaintiffs were non suited. I conceive then that Nicholas fitz Reginald had the re version or fee-simple of these 10 acres, and that so his name appears in the Arrentation of 1247, the Tenant-Ust of 1251, the Aid-RoU of 1254, the Hundred-Roll of 1255, and the Scutage-Roll of 1260, his Crown-rent being 2*., his nominal Tenure -xoth of a Knight's fee. As to Roger de Stanton who inherited the residue of this tene ment from his Father, his name figures in the same Records as the person liable to the Crown for 1*. rent and the service of -j^th of a Knight's-fee. However he had sub-enfeoffed WUliam fitz Hem-y before Easter Term 1250, when the latter was impleaded by Lucia and Johanna fitz Alexander for 10 acres, eight of which, as he afterwards proved, he had by feoffment of Roger, son of Robert de Stanton. I have already quoted the Inquisition of 1278, which so accurately distinguishes the Tenement held in capite by WiUiam fitz Henry, deceased, from the 12 acres which he held under Roger de Stanton, at a rent of 136?., the said Roger being responsible for the King's rent of 1*. assessed thereon. 9. Richard fitz Philip was enfeoffed in one noke at 6d. rent in 1235, and by Robert de Sutton. This rent (variously stated as Is.) was one of those given by Robert de Sutton to Henry the Moneyer, and quit-claimed, by the son of the latter, to the Crown before 1247. The Arrentation of that year estimates Richard fitz PhUip's tene ment at 18 acres, worth 6*. 86?. yearly, and sets thereon a Crown rent of 2*. The Records of 1251, 1254, 1255, and 1260 make con sistent mention of this tenure, adding Richard fitz PhUip's liabUity as Tenant of of a Knight's-fee. 10. Reginald de Heyton was enfeoffed by Robert de Sutton in 1239, at rent. The Arrentation does not assess him, his Tenure"], [127, "99 LITTLE SUTTON. . being one of those included in Osbert de Sutton's fine, where he is caUed Reginald fitz Wymund. In 1255 his Tenure was detached from this group, and his proportion pf Crown-rent said to be 3d. He was one of the Tenants impleaded by Osbert de Sutton's Widow in 1259, viz. for a third of 2 acres; which 2 acres were, I suppose, all he held. Adam de Heyton had succeeded to Reginald in 1262, and John, son of Reginald de Heyton, occurs at Sutton in 1306. 11. Herbert de Wichcote was enfeoffed in 3 acres, by Robert de Sutton in 1239, at rent. Like Reginald de Heyton his Crown-rent of 36?. is first apportioned on him in 1255. AUna, widow of Osbert de Sutton, sued him for dower in 1259, viz. for a third of 2 acres. Herbert's successor was probably Geoffrey de Wichcote, who has been mentioned under Great Sutton as occur ring in 1271,36 and also under Stokesay.36 An Inquest taken at Little Sutton Feb. 20, 1309, on the death of Hugh, son of Geoffrey de Wychcote, states his tenure in capite there to have been 8 acres and his arrentation 6d. The annual value thereof was 2*. 8d. A messuage and 15 acres which he had in Great Sutton were held under MatUda Burnel. Hugh his son and heir was aged 26 years and more on lS[ov. 1, 1308. 21 12. Elyas de Sutton was enfeoffed in 1240 by Osbert de Sutton in one noke, at le?, rent, also in 7 acres, at 26?. rent. The Arrenta tion of 1247 estimates his tenure as 2 bovates, worth 7s. per annum, and fixes his Crown-rent at 2*. The Records of 1251, 1254, and 1260 make consistent mention of this tenure and Crown-rent, but the Hundred-RoU of 1255 inaccurately specifies only 1*. of Crown rent. This is the last of the eight greater Tenures in Sutton, each said to owe the service of AA^1 0l\u00b0 a knight's-fee. The Inquest on Elyas de Sutton's death is preserved. The Writ of Diem clausit bears date July 20, 1262. Among the Jurors are Adam de Heyton, Robert Wymund, and WiUiam fitz Henry de Sutton. The deceased had held 25 acres in Little Sutton of 4*. 86?. annual value, by a service of 2*. yearly to the Crown. He also had held of the King of Almagne a carucate of land, worth 34*. per annum, at a rent of 10*. (The latter tenure was in Great Sutton.) Elyas, son and heir of the deceased, was at least 24 years of age. In this same year (1262) John, son of Elyas de Sutton, was amerced 126?. for vert, and assessed 126?. for an imbladement within Regard of the Long Forest. At the Assizes of 1272 Elyas de Sutton (John's elder brother) was a Juror for Munslow Hundred; so too at the Inquisition of 1274. =G Supra, pp. 96 and 67. I v Inquisitions, 2 Edw. II, No. 11."], [128, "100 LITTLE SUTTON. He was again on the Munslow Jury at the Assizes of 1292, and one of the Jurors to try Pleas of Quo Waranto at the same Her. I have already given particulars of Elyas de Sutton's interest in Lower Hayton, and of his grant thereof to Acornbury Nunnery in 1299.38 The Inquest which defined his estate in Lower Hayton said further that besides his grant to Acornbury he had three carucates of land in Sutton and Possethorne, and 100*. annual rent in the same vills.29 In June 1300 Helias de Sutton occurs as one of the Verderers of the Royal Forests of Shropshire.30 The time of his death I cannot ascertain, but he was succeeded by his son Richard, who was de ceased May 27, 1324. The said Richard's tenure in capite was found by Inquest, held August 10 following, to have been a mes suage, 12 acres of land, and one acre of meadow, the arrentation whereon was 1*. He held also a messuage, 36 acres of land, and 5*. rent in Great Sutton of Sir John de Handlo, by service of 7s. rent. John de Sutton, son and hen of Richard, was 15 years of age on June 24, 1324.31 13. Richard Walsh (Walensis) held by rent of 126?. under Ro bert de Sutton ; which rent Robert de Sutton gave to Henry the Moneyer, together with a meadow, for which the said Henry was to pay 36?. per annum. WUliam, Henry's son, quit-claimed the rent of 126?. to the Crown, and gave the meadow up to Stephen de Buterley, the King's Escheator. These surrenders were probably before 1251. Then Richard WaUicus is entered as a Sutton Tenant. He is caUed Richard le Waleys in 1259, when Alina, widow of Osbert de Sutton, sued him for thirds of a messuage and 6 acres in Sutton. Roger le Walse, perhaps of this family, occurs on a Sutton Jury in 1306. 14. Other Tenants were Robert Merth, enfeoffed before 1255 by Osbert de Sutton in a messuage and garden, worth 4*. per annum, at rent ; \u2014 John fitz Henry, holding 4 acres in 1247, worth 2*. per annum ; \u2014 Richard le Mazun, sued in 1259 by Osbert de Sutton's widow for thirds of a messuage and 8 acres ; \u2014 Henry de Parva Sut ton and Eve his wife, similarly sued for thirds of 2 acres; \u2014 and lastly WUUam le Moneur of Parva Sutton, who occurs in 1292.

However I prefer to speak of Lawton here, because it now forms one township with Little Sutton, and was associated therewith by several circumstances of ancient tenure. Like Little Sutton, Lawton had in the twelfth century become a Serjeantry, and was held in capite by those same BaskervUles whom I have mentioned under Aldenham, Pickthorn, Northwood, Newton, and Little Sutton. I return for a moment to the question of the origin of these BaskervUles whose estates, be it remembered, were not only in Shropshire, but also at Bradwardine, in Herefordshire, and at Helidon, in Northamptonshire. Connected as they undoubtedly were with the BaskervUles of Eardisley, that connection has only served to confuse all accounts of the two races after they became distinct. One statement would lead us to infer that a Ralph de Baskervill, of the elder line, acquired Eardisley and WiUersley by marriage with Sibil, daughter of Adam de la Port;1 but surely Eardisley belonged to the Fief of Lacy, rather than to that of La Port. However in this statement we have perhaps an element of a much more probable theory, viz. that a Cadet of the BaskervUles of Eardisley, by some such marriage, and early in the twelfth century, acquired Bradwardine, \u2014 a fee which, as we have al ready seen,3 was held in 1165 by Ralph de BaskervUl under Adam de la Port. There are other circumstances which I have not yet aUuded to, but which are illustrative not only of this Ralph de BaskervUl's Tenures in Herefordshire and Shropshire, but of his personal history and tragical death. Like his cotemporary, Robert de BaskervUle of Eardisley, Ralph de Baskervill was a Benefactor to the Priory of Brecknock. \" He gave,\" says my authority, \" to the Monks of Brecknock lands at Bredwardine.\" His Charter was attested by WiUiam de Braose (who then enjoyed La Port's Barony) and by William de Braose the younger.3 A renewal of this Charter seems to have had the attestations of William de Braose Senior, Maud de St. Valeri his wife, and Ralph Abbot of Wigmore3 (who occurs in office in 1180 and 1185). Ralph de Baskervill by another Charter, gave Trosdref Mill, on the river Llyfni, to Brecknock,3 and this grant, being made in the presence of Peter Bishop of St. David's, must have passed between 1176, when that Prelate succeeded, and 1191-2, when Ralph de Baskervill seems to have been assassinated.

Baskervill who gave to the Knights Templars of Lidley his Mill of Lawton.4 If so, the grant will have heen made between 1185 and 1192 ; for in the former year a Eecord of all the Templars' posses sions in Shropshire was not inclusive of this item. The wife of Ralph de Baskervill has heen before alluded to as having remarried to Roger fitz William, suspected to have been her first husband's Murderer. This Lady was undoubtedly the same with Nesta ap Griffith, who after Ralph de BaskerviU's death is said to have contested his grant of Trosdref Mill to the Monks of Breck nock. Ultimately she withdrew this opposition and became herself a Benefactress of the Priory. Her Quit-claim seems to show that she was surviving later than the year 1203.\u00b0 I have on former occasions mentioned three of Ralph de Basker vill's children, viz. Thomas his heir (under age at his Father's death) , Nesta, who in 1199 claimed Bradwardine as her inheritance, and Isolda, who seems to have married a Botterell. He had perhaps other issue,6 but of his daughter Nesta I must here speak particu larly, inasmuch as he is said to have enfeoffed her in Lawton before his decease. In 1211 we accordingly find Nesta de Baskerville among the Tenants of Shropshire Serjeantries. Her duty was to provide one serving-man with a lance for the Kings army of Wales.7 The husband of Nesta de Baskervill was Howell fitz Adam, who appears to have been in rebellion and under forfeiture at the close of King John's reign. A precept of Henry III, dated October 18, 1217, informs the Sheriff of Shropshire that Huwell fitz Adam had returned to his allegiance, aud commands that his estates be restored to him.s In 1219 Nesta de Baskervill was deceased. A King's Writ, dated November 23, orders the Sheriff' of Shropshire to seize the land, lately hers, in Lauton, and to allow nothing to be removed therefrom till further orders.9 In this instance the deceased is called * Testa de Nevill, p. 60. had formerly held under her Brother.\" She may have been a Sister or a daughter of Ralph de Baskervill, but the meagre way in which her Deed is quoted by Jones, destroys its genealogical bearing.

The Heads of that House from 11S6 to 12S2 were all named Walter. 5 Jones's Brecknockshire, II, pp. 79, 80. \u2014 This Quit-claim is attested bjMagis ter G. de Barri, and by G.

Another King's Writ dated November 23, 1220, recites that Hoel fitz Adam was the surviving husband of Nesta de Baskerville, and had issue by her. This alluded to his rights by Courtesy of England, and the King enjoins that he have seizin for life of all her inheritance in Lautun.1\" It would seem that Howell fitz Adam's title was under dispute, the Counter-claim ant being his brother-in-law Thomas de Baskervill. Both in Hilary and Easter Terms 1221 the latter appeared in the Courts of West minster in his suit against Howel fitz Adam. The case was ad journed till the Justices Itinerant should visit Shropshire ; and the land was seized into the King's hand in consequence of the Defend ant's non-appearance. At the Assizes of November 1221 the case was again adjourned ; for on some ground or other the Defendant was under imprisonment in one of the King's Gaols. According to the last entry only half a virgate of land in Lauton was in dis pute, but the Westminster Plea-Roll of Trinity Term 1222 shows that half a hide, or in other words, the whole Manor was in litiga tion. The question seems to have been whether Nesta de Basker vill had really been enfeoffed by her Father Ralph, or had only had a life-interest in the estate. The Sheriff of Shropshire had em panelled a Jury of the Vicinage to ascertain this point. Accord ingly, in Trinity Term aforesaid, the Sheriff reported to the Court at Westminster that he found by Inquisition that Nesta had been seized of Lauton before her Father's death, viz. from a period com mencing between Chfistmas (Dec. 25) and the Purification (Feb. 2), and ending at the feast of St. Augustine (May 26) . The latter was probably the day of Ralph de Baskervill's murder ; for the Jurors further reported that \" after her Father's death Nesta was in like manner seized of Lawton.\" I cannot discover any proof that Howel fitz Adam or his issue by Nesta de Baskervill maintained any claim in Lawton. In the year ending Michaelmas 1223 Thomas de Baskervill fined in the large sum of 12 merks for some Inquest to be had. In October 1224 he names Hugh Peche as his Attorney in a plea of land against. Roger de Furchis,11 and this land appears by an entry on the Plea- Roll of Hilary Term 1225 to have been half a virgate in Lauton. Cotemporarily Roger de Furchis had a counter-suit, about certain chattels, against Thomas de Baskervill ; and the Courts of West minster issued an order prohibiting him from prosecuting the latter \" Hot.

In July 1226 three Coheiresses appear as claiming half the Manor of Lauton against Thomas de Baskervill. These were Alice wife of John fitz Simon, Agnes wife of Peter de Aldermoneston, and Isabel wife of Hugh de Radenovre. Each claimant seems to have made her hus band an Attorney in the suit, but the result I know not. In 1228 Thomas de Baskerville pays a Crown debt of 5 merks, which had previously been charged in Norfolk against Master Mi chael Belet on behalf of the said Thomas. Thomas de Baskervill died, as I have before shown, in 1241, and his son and heir Roger died in 1244, leaving a Widow, Auastasia, and a son Walter, then an Infant. An Inquisition of Munslow Hundred, taken about 1251, represents the \" Heir of Roger de Baskervill as holding Lanston by Serjeantry.\"12 This was not quite correct ; for the said heir was still in minority, and his Mother Ana stasia was holding Lauton in dower. In Michaelmas Term 1253 Auastasia had remarried to Robert Mauduit, and Henry le Maratin was suing Robert Mauduit and Anastasia his said wife, for a debt of 9 merks. The Defendants had been attached by William Sel mund of Lauton, but did not appear. The Munslow Jurors of 1255 said that Robert Mauduit held Lauton by Serjeantry of the King, in the name of the dower of Anastasia his wife. It contained half a hide of land. The service due from the Tenant was to find one Archer with bow and arrows for 15 days, in time of any Welsh war, at his own cost. The Manor did Suit to the Hundred, and paid 6^. yearly for stretward and motfee. The whole estate of \" Anastasia, Lady of Lauton\" was further valued at 100*. per annum.13 The Feodary of 1284 represents Robert Mauduit as still living and holding Lauton by Serjeantry, but forty days' service with the King in Wales is said to be due from the foot-soldier whom he had to provide. The Munslow Jurors at the Assizes of 1292 stated the older service, viz. that of an Archer for fifteen days. They repre sented Roger de Baskervill as then seized of Lauton. Its contents were 2 carucates. Unlike other Serjeantries, nothing of this estate had been alienated, no services were in arrear, and Roger de Bas kervill had done homage to the King as Tenant.14 Another entry on the same Roll contradicts this last statement, and represents Roger de Baskervill as fining half a merk to have respite in regard of his doing homage till January 1293.

The following Deed passed in the first sixteen years of the fourteenth century, and probably on occasion of the marriage of Richard, son and heir-apparent of Roger de Baskervill. \u2014 The said Roger grants to Riehard, his eldest son, for a sum of money all his Manor of Pykethorne with 405. rent in his Manor of Lauton, saving to himself the suit of the Tenants paying that rent ; \u2014 to hold of the Grantor, \u2014 to Richard and Juliana his wife, and their heirs law fully begotten, at a rent of J30. for the Grantor's life.

The Table already given will supply some of the details. Other facts are as follows. \u2014 Roger de Baskervill died about January 1339. The Serjeantry whereby he then held Pick thorn had been changed, probably owing to the previous subjuga tion of Wales. He was to furnish the King with a barbed arrow as often as the King came to hunt in Corndon Chace. He died seized not only of Lawton, but of the Manor of Weston Bradwar dine in Herefordshire, and of a messuage and rents in the vill of Bradwardine. The latter item was held under the Earl of Here ford (evidently as heir of De Braose) by the twentieth-part of a knight's-fee.17 Richard de Baskervill, son and heir of Roger, was \" upwards of 40 years of age\" at his Father's death, \u2014 an expression which does not preclude the idea that he was more than 50. He was deceased in 1344. Walter, his son and successor, married Elizabeth Lacy, who was an heiress, and brought the Manor of Cressage to her husband. Ou May 1, 1344, died Joanna de Baskerville, Walter's Grandmother. She had held Lawton in dower to the day of her death.18 Walter de Baskervill died in 1368.

John, only son of John de Baskervill, died in infancy and with out issue on January 2, 1383. With him expired the elder male line of his House, nine generations of which have therefore been traced with a degree of certainty seldom attainable in such cases. The heir of John de Baskervill was his first Cousin, Thomas Foulshurst, the infant son of his Aunt Margaret, sometime wife of Robert Foulshurst.21 Thomas Foulshurst came of age on May 25, 1390.22 He died in 2 Henry IV (1400-1) ; but the Inquest on his death has beeu lost, and we are left to conclude from an abstract thereof, that he had estates at Weston-in- Bradwardine (Herefordshire), and at Lawton, Pickthorn, Cressage, and Stanton Lacy in Shropshire.23 I learn from other sources that his son and heir, a second Thomas Foulshurst, was under age at his Father's death. According to one account he was still under age at the time of his own death, which took place in November or December 1416. He was however seized of two-thirds of the Manors or vills of Pickthorn, Cressage, Weston, and Bradwardine ; the re maining third of each being still held by his Great-Aunt Katherine m dower.24.

Several Inquisitions25 taken iu Shropshire and Herefordshire in October 1435 found him to he of full age, and heir of Weston, Bradwardine, Pickthorn, and Cres sage, the thirds of which Manors had reverted to his estate while he was a Minor, viz. on October 29, 1423, when his Great-Great- Aunt Katherine died.

William his Brother, was his heir, and being of full age succeeded to Hcli don in Northamptonshire, to Pickthorn aud Cressage in Shrop shire, and to Weston and Bradwardine in Herefordshire, except so far as his Mother had dower in those estates.20 William Fouls hurst died on the 16th or 21st of October 1439 without issue. His estates, enumerated in an Inquisition of the following year, were the Manor of Helidon in Northamptonshire, called Basker vyle's Manor, the Castle of Bradwardine and the Manor of Weston in Herefordshire, three-fourths of Cressage and two-thirds of Pick thorn in Shropshire.37 William Foulshurst was the last of his fine. One authority names Joyce his sister, but she, if a real personage, must have died before him and left no issue. It was now necessary to go back several generations in order to identify the next heir of this House. The said heir was found to be John de Baskervill, son of Richard, son of Richard, son of Richard de Baskervill, which last Richard was younger brother of that Walter de Baskervill who married Elizabeth Lacy, and died in 1368. It is clear therefore that nothing of the blood of Elizabeth Lacy was in John de Baskervill. Cressage here upon escheated to William, Duke of York, as Lord of the Fee, and in default of any known heir of Elizabeth Lacy. Sir John Basker vill, Knight, then upwards of 30 years of age, succeeded in 1440 to the Baskervill estates proper. I have not examined all the autho rities which supply further details of this subject. I must be con tent therefore to conclude with a summary of what I believe to have been the sequel. The younger male line, represented in 1440 by Sir John de Baskervill, failed. The next heir was found by revert ing one generation further back than in the last instance. Joanna, daughter of Roger de Baskervill, who died in 1339, had been the wife of Peter de Overton. The line of Overton had ended in a fe male heir, \u2014 Johanna wife of William Worthyn. Again the line of Worthyn had ended in an heiress, Eleanor or Ellen, wife of John Bruyn. Margery Bruyn, great-granddaughter, and eventually sole heir of the said John and Eleanor, married William Otley of Pitch ford. Thus the Otleys came to represent the eldest extant line of the Shropshire Baskervills. But this was not all. There was a younger House of Baskervills which also seems to have become extinct, and its representation to have gone to the Otleys as the next known heirs. The Ancestor of 26 Inquisitions, 15 Hen.

Thomas de Baskervill, styled of Newton, seems to have had a son John, styled of Eaton Mascott. From Margaret, daughter and heir of John, descended Roger de Pickthorn, but in what way is not quite clear. Roger de Pickthorn was how ever son of William de Pickthorn, and William de Pickthorn was cotemporary with Roger de Baskervill who died in 1339. William de Pickthorn and Roger de Baskervill are incidentally mentioned in a Deed of 1339-40, which I have already quoted under Northwood.28 The curious indorsement of that Deed by Adam Otteley of Pitchford, I have also adverted to.

In another respect the his tory of Merston differs very remarkably from that of Middleton Hig ford, Ledwich, and Little Sutton. The Seigneury of Merstun re mained with William Pantulf's Representatives for at least two cen turies after Domesday; and very little more than this is known about the place. The Munslow Inquisition of 1255 says that Ralph le Butiler (he was then Baron of Wem) holds Meryston of the King. It was estimated to contain two carucates and one virgate.

More over it is noted that the Vill of Merston made no appearance at the taking of this Inquest.2 These immunities, singular as they are in such a case, may per haps be associated with a fact in the history of the House of Pantulf, to which I shall hereafter refer. In Hilary Term 1278, Ralph le Botyler of Wemme, and Matilda his wife, concurred in a Fine which was substantively a grant or settlement of this Manor to the use of Nicholas de Seymor and Alice his wife, with remainder to the heirs of Nicholas by the said Alice. On failure of such heirs and on death of the Survivor of Nicholas and Alice, the Manor was to revert to Ralph le Botyler and his wife, or to the heirs of the latter, quit of any other heirs of Nicholas. A rent of one rose was reserved to the Grantors, and the Grantees are said to pay \u00a3100. for the Fine.3 John de Merston, probably an Under-tenant here occurs on a Jury at Little Sutton in 1306.

His Ante cessors at Clee Staunton had done suit to Munslow Hundred till the time of King Richard, when as in other of St. Milburg's Manors, their suit was transferred to the Franchise of Wenlock.4 At this time, I should observe, Stoke St. Milburg is said to contain no more than 20 hides, though inclusive of Clee Staunton. I have already commented on this presumed mistake,5 which unless under stood might prevent our identifying the Clee of Domesday with the Clee Staunton of a later period. Such diminutions of the reputed hidage of a Manor or Manors were in most cases encroachments on the rights of the Crown ; but in the present instance the change was little likely to be observed, for in respect of St. Milburg's Manors the Crown had no longer any rights dependent on hidage to guard. At the Assizes of January 1256 William fitz Hugh of Stanton was suing Philip de Clinton to allow him to have estovers in Philip's wood of Stanton. Philip did not appear, but by a Fine levied at Westminster in Michaelmas Term following, he conceded the right in the woods called Hanacre and Bondiwode, while the Plaintiff re nounced all claim in the woods called The Pitte and the Hawe. In this same year Philip de Clinton was returned among those who holding 15 Librates of lands were not yet Knights. A Patent, dated in July, exempts him from the implied obligation for an indefinite period. In 1261 I find mention of Philip de Clinton as one ofthe Coroners of Shropshire ; and at the Assizes of 1272 his name appears among those who were to give account of their conduct in that office. At these same Assizes William fitz Hugh served on the Jury for Munslow Hundred : an obligation however which can hardly have arisen from any interest which he may have had in Clee Stanton. The Ecclesiastical Taxation of 1291 registers the Prior of Wenlock' s seignoral right in Staunton as an assized rent of \u00a31. 6s. 8d., i. e. 2 merks per annum? Ivo de Clinton who succeeded to Philip sometime between 1274 and 1284, appears at the Assizes of October 1292, as answering for Philip's discharge of his duties as Coroner during the latter part of his life. Ivo de Clinton was himself holding that office, and had to answer on his own account. He was living in 1300, as I have shown under Henley, but in March 1316 John de Clinton was Lord of Henley.7 In conclusion I observe that the Foreign Rent-Roll of n Pope Nich. Taxation, p. 164.

Who Hugh fitz Turgis was I cannot say, more than that he held two other Manors, Wilderley and Chelmick, under Earl Roger at Domesday. It is probable that his Shropshire interests expired with those of Earl Robert de Belesme ; for in the next succeeding period we find his three Manors annexed to the Honour of Montgomery, that i>, to the Fief which King Henry I bestowed on Baldwin de Boilers. A word now as to the different names by which this place has been known. In some early Saxon \u00e6ra, unchronicled by Domesday, it was the Hope, or Valley,3 of Forthred. Hence its Domesday name of Fordritishope. In the hands of Baldwin dc Boliers or his descen dants it acquired the distinctive name of Hope Boilers or Bufhlers, of which Bowdler is the modern form.

In the year 1201 Robert de Bullers was Lord of Montgomery, and Roger de Say was apparently his Tenant in the Fee of Hope Bowdler. Both had been impleaded by Richard de Wilderley (who then held Wilderley of the same Honour of Montgomery) for the Vill of Hop. The suit seems to have been one of mort d'ancestre originally, but had been partially arranged ; for in the Quinzaine of Michaelmas, a precept issued from theCourts at Westminster ordering that Richard de Wilderley should, before the Quinzaine of St. Martin, give security to the said Robert and Roger for the money which he had agreed to pay them.4 Another precept in the same term orders the parties to come and receive their Chirograph in Hilary Term 1202.* The Fine thus indicated is preserved. It was levied at Westminster in Hilary Term, 1202. It purports to be between Richard de Wildredeslege, Plaintiff, and Robert de Bullers and Roger de Say, Tenants, of the whole vill of Hope, whereof there had been suit of mort d'ancestre. Robert and Roger now acknowledged the said vill to be Richard's right and inheritance, \u2014 to hold to Richard and his heirs for ever, under them and their heirs, by the service pertaining to the land in question ; \u2014 saving however to one Robert Witbret his former tenement in the same fee, \u2014 to hold to the said Robert Witbret and his heirs under Richard de Wildredes lege and his heirs, Robert Witbret performing the same services to the said Richard as he (Witbret) had previously performed to Robert de Boliers. For this recognition and fine, Richard de Wildredes lege gave to Robert de Bullers 110 merks, and to Roger de Say 50 merks.5 Of Roger de Say I shall have other occasion to speak as a Tenant elsewhere in the Honour of Montgomery. His interest in Hope Bowdler will have been effaced or rendered merely nominal by the above Fine. Richard de Wilderley now became the Tenant-in-fee of Hope. I shall speak of him again under YVilderley, which Manor with other lands he granted to Haughmond Abbey at a certain rent. This rent, and with it all his interest in Wilderley, was abandoned to the same Abbey by Stephen, son and heir of Richard de Wilder ley. Hope Bowdler therefore remained as the principal estate of the said Stephen, who consequently appears in all instances under the name of Stephen de Hope. 4 Placita, Mich.

Damages of 12s. were awarded. The Sureties ofthe Defendants were Gregory de Hope, Robert Whyt bert, John, Richard, Eborard, and Robert de Raggedon, Adam fitz Baldwin, Richard fitz Helin, and Adam de Chelmundewyk.6 At the same Assizes Philip Wytberd, with twenty-seven others, was found to have wrongfully raised a fence in Tykelworthin, thereby injuring the Prior of Wenlock' s Tenement there. Damages of 40s. were given in this instance.6 In 1240 William de Cantilupe being Lord of the Honour of Montgomery, Stephen de Hope and the Abbot of Haughmond are entered as holding one knight's-fee under the said William, in Hop and Wilderdeleg.7 Stephen's estate was Hope Bowdler, and the Abbot's was Wilderley, but the two were perhaps collectively re sponsible for the services implied by this entry. Between the years 1240 and 1255 Stephen de Hope's interest in Hope Bowdler passed to Odo de Hodnet, then Seneschal of Mont gomery, but in what way I cannot discover. In 1255 the Honour of Montgomery was in custody of Prince Edward as having ward ship of the infant heirs of William de Cantilupe, late Lord of the said Honour. Odo de Hodnet held \" Hupe Budlers\" of the said heirs. He did suit to County and Hundred, and is said to pay 4d. for stretward and motfee? The last payment is proportionable to a Manor containing only a third of a hide. The Manor then which Odo de Hodnet thus held was probably not the whole of the Domes day Manor. ' I shall presently endeavour to point out other con stituents of the Domesday Manor, but the collective territory thus ascertained will still be very short of the Domesday estimate of three hides. Such discrepancies, as we have often seen, do not dis prove identity. At the Assizes of January 1256 William le Bret failed to prose cute a suit of novel disseizin against Odo de Hodnet, concerning a tenement in Hope Bulers. George de Cantilupe, last Lord of Mont gomery, of the male line of his House, died in the month of October 1273.

The Feodary of 1284 gives the Bishop as holding Hope Boulers for one fourth of a Knight's-fee under Wil liam de Hodnet, who held under the heirs of Cantilupe. On the death of Philip Burnel (Nephew and heir of the Bishop) iu 1294, his tenure of the Manor of Hope Bowdler is duly recorded.10 So too Edward Burnell, dying in 1315, is said to have held Hope Boudlers under William la Zouche.11 The latter, as is well known, was son and heir of Eudo la Zouche by his wife Milicent, sister and coheir of George de Cantilupe above mentioned.

My reason will appear immediately. \u2014 At the Assizes of Oc tober 1203 John le Poer and Christiana his wife, Richard de Lind leg and Matilda his wife, and Baldwin fitz Robert and Margery his wife, were joint Suitors against Richard de Wilderley, of whom we have heard as Lord of Hope Bowdler. He essoigned himself,15 but the case came on at Gloucester, whither the Justices Itinerant proceeded. The suit proved to be one of mort d'ancestre, the three female Plaintiffs claiming two virgates in Raggedon as daughters and Coheiresses of one William, whom they alleged to have died seized thereof. Richard de Wilderley adduced his Fine of Hilary Term 1202 with Robert de Boulers, which, be it remembered, was of the ivhole of Hope Bowdler. This Fine, as he maintained, barred all collateral claims : nay Simon de Patshull, a Justiciar before whom the Fine was levied, and who was now in eyre, seems to have testi fied that the present Plaintiffs had actually opposed (or sunk) their claims at the time of the Fine. Richard de Wilderley called Bald win de Boulers, the heir of Robert de Boulers, to warranty, and an adjourned hearing was to take place at Oxford.15 I find nothing fur ther of this suit, but we shall hear of these three Coheiresses again in other relations. Ragdon remained a member of Richard de Wil derley's Fee of Hope Bowdler, and his interest there passed even tually to De Hodnet. The Tenant of Richard de Wilderley, or of his son Stephen de Hope, at Ragdon, was probably one Robert de Leye, which Robert de Leye sometime between the years 1224 aud 1227 follows John Bonet, Sheriff, or rather Custos, of the County, in attesting a Charter to Buildwas Abbey.16 In the year ending Michaelmas 1228, Robert de Leie himself acted as Custos under Henry cle Audley, then Sheriff.

I shall have to speak of him elsewhere, but must here notice par ticularly his grant to Buildwas Abbey, which must have passed be tween the years 1245 and 1255. Thereby calling himself \" Robert de Acton, Clerk, son of Robert de Lega,\" he gives to the Abbey, for the soids of his Father, etc. all his land of Raggedone, in pure alms, together with all his common rights in the Manor of Hope. His Deed mentions and reserves a certain due which lay upon that portion of the premises which was held by one John de Ragdon, viz. to provide one foot-soldier to do ward for fifteen days at Montgomery Castle. The witnesses are Sirs Thomas Corbet, Hugh de Scheyntone (Shineton), and William de Lectone (Leighton), Nicholas Parson of Hope, Philip Burnel, Bene dict de Frodesleg, Richard de Eton, and Peter de Cristesheth (Cres sage) .17 The Inquisition of 1255 tells us consistently that the \"Abbot of Buildwas holds Raggedon of the gift of Robert dc Acton.\" It con tained one hide, and paid 12d. per annum for stretward and motfee. Odo de Hodnet did suit both to the County and to Munslow Hun dred for Ragdon and for Hope.18 It is obvious from this that the mesne-interest of Stephen de Hope at Ragdon had passed as an appurtenance of Hope Bowdler to De Hodnet. At this period then Hope Bowdler, the Buildwas Abbey Fee therein, and the Manor of Ragdon, contained altogether 1\u00a3 hides and 1 virgate; \u2014 so much less than the three hides of the Domesday Manor that we are tempted to search for other ancient members of the latter. Such a search will, I believe, be vain, and we must leave Hope Bowdler among that large Category of Manors whose original hidage and liabilities had either been relaxed by the Crown, or tampered with by the Tenants. To return to Ragdon itself, \u2014 the Abbot of Buildwas had, in 1291, annual rents there amounting to \u00a3l.19 The Valor of 1535-6 gives the Abbot's receipts from Kynnerton and Ragdon together, as 17 Rot.

In 1291 the Church of Hope Boulers, in the Deanery of Wen lock, is valued at \u00a34. 13s. 4d. per annum. The Rector of Rushbury had also a Portion of 2s. therein.22 An Inquest of the year 1386 states this Pension to be in lieu of a certain small amount (par ticul\u00e6) of tithe due to the Rector of Rushbury, but arising from land in Hope Bowdler Parish. In 1341 the Taxation of this Church, being correctly quoted at \u00a34. 15s. 4d., the Assessors of the Ninth taxed the Parish only \u00a31. 6s. 8d. The mountainous nature ofthe district, the poverty of the Tenants, and a murrain among the sheep, were partly the causes of this reduction. Moreover the hay-tithes, small-tithes, offerings, and glebe-land were worth \u00a32. 13s. 4d. per annum, and though reckoned in the Taxation, were excluded from the current assess ment.23 In 1534-5 the Preferment of John Masse, Rector of Hope Bowdler, in glebe and tithes, was valued at \u00a36. 13s. 4d. \u2014 less 6d. per annum for Synodals.24 EARLY INCUMBENTS.

At the Assizes of January 1256 this Nicholas sued the Prior of Wenlock for estovers and common-pasture in cer tain woods lying in the Prior's Manor of Eaton, which he claimed in right of his Church. The Prior showed that the Parson of Hope Bowdler had enjoyed these privileges by permission only of Stephen de Hope, Patron of this Church twenty-five years back, which Ste- 20 Valor Ecclesiasticus, III, 191. 21 Monasticon, V, 361. -4 Valor Ecclesiasticus, III, 208. 25 Rot.

It is now worth the same.\" The Manor, thus described, probably comprehended Enchmarsh, Chatwall, and Willstone, all which are in the Parish of Cardington.3 That Alan fitz Flaald and his descendants the Fitz Alans succeeded to the Domesday estates of Rainald Vicecomes, is a rule with very few exceptions. The first William fitz Alan gave to the Order of Knights Templars, Cardington, Enchmarsh, and half the Vill of Chatwall, also 3 merks receivable annually from Cardington Church, and 5s. receivable from Cardington Mill. These gifts were probably made in the first three years of Stephen's reign, or the first six years of Henry II's reign. The probability arises in this way.\u2014 The Order of Knights Templars had its origin in the East about a.d. 1118. Their introduction into England is placed by good authority as early in Stephen's reign, which will coincide with the \u00e6ra of Roger de Mowbray, one of their chief Patrons, and who gave them his Lordship of Balshall, in Warwickshire. Balshall became a Preceptory of the Order ; and all Shropshire grants were reputed to be within the Bailiwick of Warwick. William fitz Alan who for the last sixteen years of Stephen's reign had little or no power to deal with his Shropshire estates, was restored in 1155 and died in 1160. To this period therefore we may safely attribute his grants to the Templars. The Knights fixed their House at Lidley, 1 Domesday, so. 255, a, 1.

The next notice which I have of Cardington belongs to the year 1167, when it is called \"Templars' Cardinton\" (Cardinton Tem plariorum), and when the Vill was amerced 2 merks by Alan de Nevill, Justice of the Forest.3 The debt was paid in 1170.3 In 1185 we have a full survey of the Shropshire estates of the Tem plars.4 I here enumerate those which they had by gift of William Fitz Alan and confirmation of the King. In Carditon itself they had 18 Tenants holding half a virgate or more, and 16 Tenants holding less quantities. The rents varied from 3s. 4d. to 2s. on each half-virgate, the virgate consisting apparently of 40 acres. For smaller quantities than a quarter-virgate the rent was uni formly 2d. per acre. Of the thirty-four Tenants, six are said to pay from 6d. to Id. each pro fraternitate , that is, for the privilege of participating in the immunities of the Order ; an extra rent for a messuage or a mansion is also charged in three cases. Among the Tenants are Odo the Provost, and Inard the Priest (Sacerdos), who had a wife, Matilda; and it is curious that both the Priest and his (so-called) wife were put in charge pro fraternitate, viz. 6d. and 4d. distinctively. Six Widows also were among the Tenants, and two of them paid 6d. and ld. pro fraternitate. The total re ceipts from Carditon were \u00a35. 4s. At Huchemers (now Enchmarsh) the Knights had seven Te nants of half a virgate, and three of lesser quantities. The same rates of rent were paid as in Carditon, and there was one payment pro fraternitate. The total receipts were \u00a31. 9s. 2d. At Chatewelle were eight tenements, four of which were half a virgate or more. Separate rents are charged on a garden, two messuages, and pro fraternitate. The total receipts were 16s. 10\\d. We may reckon the whole of this estate as equal to half the Domesday Manor of Cardington, that is, to 2\\ hides. When I add that it now amounted to 19| virgates \u2014 which at Domesday would have constituted nearly five hides \u2014 we get a good instance of the altered ratio which a century had worked, as between the hide and the virgate. \u2014 The same hide which in 1085 contained 4 virgates was made to supply nearly 8 virgates in 1185. Returning to the Survey which I have been quoting, I have to add that Roger Miller was Life-Tenant of Cardington Mill at a rent of 5s., and that Arnolf, Parson of the Church of Cardinton, ' MS. quoted Vol. I, p. 363, note 479. 3 Rot. Pip. 13 and 16 Hen. II, Salop. \\"], [152, "124 CARDINGTON. paid the Templars three merks per annum for the Church, and Is. for their fraternity. The customs of Cardington were that every acre of land newly assarted, in Cardington or its hamlets, should pay 2d. per annum for the three first years of cultivation. Also all tenements of less than a quarter- virgate were for life only, and re verted to the Lords on a Tenant's death, unless the said Tenant's heirs were willing to pay as much as any other bidder. Other customs, which related also to Lidley, shall be given under that Manor. In 1187 I find the Vill of Cardinton again amerced for waste hy Justices of the Forest. Half a merk was charged in this instance, but it was excused in 1189, in accordance with a Franchise granted by Royal Charter to the Knights of the Temple. In 1200 the Vill of Kartington was again amerced one merk for waste ; but in the following year the Templars obtained a King's writ ordering their acquittance, in conformity with their Charter. In October 1237 I find the Master of the Templars suing Gregory de Bottefeld and Adam de Wilureton for disseizing him of a tenement in Cardinton. At the Munslow Inquisition of 1255 the vill of Cardington made no appearance at all, and was not reported of. What was said of a moiety of Chatwall is an index to the state of the whole territory of the Templars. \" The Templars of Lidley hold half a hide in Chatwalle. They do no suit to either County or Hundred, nor pay stretward nor motfee?' The King was damaged 2s. per annum for the twenty years during which the Jurors said that the Templars had thus held this moiety of Chatwall.5 From the Inquisition of 1274 it would appear that the Templars were then possessed of a part of Willstone, for they are presented as having withdrawn the suit of one-third of the vill of Wilferstone from the Sheriff's Great Tourn.6 I must consign to a note the ex traordinary account which the Feodary of 1284 gives of Cardington.7 The forfeiture of the English Templars seems to have been de cided upon in 1308. The suppression of the Order throughout Europe was consummated by the Council of Vienna in 1311, when all its possessions were, by an Edict of Pope Clement V, conveyed to the Knights Hospitallers. It is clear however that in England s Rot. Hundred. II, 72, 71. Alan fitz Ploc was a legendary represen tative of Alan fitz Flaald? The \u00e6ra of the latter was however far too early for any other than a supposititious grant to the Templars. 6 Ibidem, p. 100. 7 \"Magister Corlicie (read Militie) Templi tenet Manerium de Carditon de dono Alani filii Ploc, et idem Alanus tenet de Rege in capite.\" Is it possible that"], [153, "125 CHATWALL. many of the Templars' estates reverted, in the first instance, to the Heirs of the original Donors.8 I find a statement, which, as regards Cardington, shows very satisfactorily how matters were arranged between the Knights Hospitallers and the Heir of the Donor. \" The Knights granted it to Edmund fitz Alan, Earl of Arundel,\"9 who was, in fact, the heir in question. Hence the territorial Survey of March 1316 enrols the Earl as \"Lord ofthe Vill of Cardington.\"10 A Deed of 18 Edw. II (1324-5) is quoted as a grant and confir mation of this Manor to the same Earl Edmund by the Prior of the Hospitallers. The Deed will have been a Confirmation only, though, as was often the case, it may have borne the appearance of an original grant. Chatwall. \u2014 That which I have to say distinctively of this member of Cardington relates chiefly to the moiety which was not granted to the Templars. This moiety of course remained with Fitz Alan as seignoral Lord. In the beginning of Henry Ill's reign it seems to have been held under Fitz Alan by Gilbert de Buckenhull (of whom we shall hear more elsewhere) and under Gilbert by one Alan de Draiton. In 1255 William, son and successor of Alan de Draiton, held half a hide in Chatewalle of Gilbert de Buckenhull. He did suit to neither County nor Hundred, the said suit having been with drawn twenty years previously, whereby the king was damaged 2s. per annum. He paid 6c?. for stretward and motfee ; and the Muns low Jurors said that he owed suit to their Hundred.11 William de Draiton died without issue. His heir was his Sister Petronilla, wife of John de la Lee. She was dead in January 1276, but John de la Lee, having issue by her, was then holding half Chatwall by Courtesy of England. In that month he was suing Brother Richard Lovel, Master of the Templars, for disseizing him of 100 acres of bosc in Chatwall. The Master pleaded that the said bosc was of his demesne, and that John de la Lee was entitled only to housebote therein. John proved the former seizin of Alan de Draiton, and deduced his own title as I have given it above; \u2014 where upon he recovered against the Templars.12 I shall have more to say of this succession under Berrington, in which Manor the Drai tons, and after them the Lees, were Coparceners.

These names are Walter, Nicholas Maucovenant, and John de Hanewode.15 There is more or less doubt as to the locality of their Tenures, but one of them, perhaps Walter, was probably Tenant of Willstone. If this conjecture be right, Walter was ancestor of the family of Muneton or Minton, re presented certainly by one Walter de Muneton in 1199. I shall have more to say about this family elsewhere, but here observe that in 1240 Adam de Muneton was holding half a knight's-fee (the usual equivalent of a whole Muntator' s-fee) in Wilureston, under Fitz Alan.16 In 1255 Peter de Muneton, son of Adam, had an Undertenant here ; for Mile de Hop is said to hold Wiluriston for two hides of land under Peter de Muneton. He did suit to the Court of John fitz Alan at Upton under Haemon, i. e. Upton Magna. He paid the King 2s. per annum for Stretward and Motfee. A memorandum, annexed to this return of the Munslow Inquisitors, seems to inti mate that the Tenant in question had latterly paid only 4c?. per an num for stretward and motfee, and was now summoned to give account of this change.17 An Extent of Fitz-Alan Fees, taken at Oswestry on June 25, 1272, seems to have mentioned Wolurestone as an estate held of that Barony ; but the Record itself is utterly defaced.18 Another defaced Inquest, taken apparently about 1275, includes Wilverston among the Vills whose suit had been withdrawn from (I thiuk) Munslow Hundred, and by the Master of the Templars.19 CARDINGTON CHURCH AND PARISH.

Culvestan, Conodovre, and Lenteurde. The Antiquity of the Church was probably much greater than is implied even by the very early mention thereof in Fitz Alan's grant to the Templars. In the thirteenth century the Templars had the Rectory, as well as the Advowson of the Vicarage of this Church, and we hear no more of the mere Pension previously receivable therefrom.20 In 1291 the Church of Cardynton, in the Deanery of Wenlock, belonging to the Templars, is valued at \u00a313. 6s. 8c?. It was exempt from the Tenth* paid by most Parochial Churches of the Kingdom to the See of Rome. Besides this Rectorial value the Vicar's Portion in Cardington Church was \u00a34. per annum.21 On the suppression of the Templars in 1308 the Advowson of Cardington was for a space in the Crown, then it went to the Hos pitallers with whom it remained ; for they did not convey the An vowson together with the Manor to the Earl of Arundel. In 1341 the Taxuiii \u00b0\"*^Cardington Church being duly quoted as \u00a317. 6s. 86?., the Parish was taxed only \u00a35. to the Ninth. The de struction of corn, murrain among sheep, and the non-cultivation of the lands of twenty off-gone Tenants were among the reasons of this reduction. Also the Glebe and Altarages of the Church went to form the higher sum, and had no relation to the current levy.22 The Valor of 1534-5 gives no account of the Rectorial value of this Church. The Vicarage then held by William Halle, was worth \u00a36. 10s. in Glebe aud Tithes, whereon a sum of 7s. 8c?. was annually chargeable for Archdeacon's Procurations and Synodals.23 EARLY INCUMBENTS. Arnolf, Rector of this Church in 1185, paid as I have already said, a pension of three merks to the Templars. 20 It seems doubtful when the Templars obtained an Appropriation of Cardington Church. Mr. Blakeway names an Epis copal Instrument for that purpose as bear ing date November 9, 1303 ; but he seems to have questioned the accuracy of this ; for he remarks that Hugh was Arch deacon at the time of the Appropriation. As far as the history of the Templars is concerned, the commencement of the thir teenth century is a very probable, and the commencement of the fourteenth a very improbable, period for them to have ob- tained this privilege. Moreover I find only one Hugh in office as Archdeacon of Salop (Hereford Diocese) during the whole period in question. This was Hugh Foliot who occurs as Archdeacon in 1214, and became Bishop in 1219. \u2014 According to this the appropriating Bishop will have been either Giles de Braose (1200-1216) or Hugh de Mapenore (1216-1219). 21 Pope Nich.

Here is a Mill of three measures of corn (annual value). In King Edward's time the Manor was worth 65s. (per annum) . Now it is worth 40s. He (Rainald) found it waste.\"1 This Manor I trace, as regards name, in the present Vill or Township of Aston, near Munslow. I would notice, in support of this idea, that Bouldon, a Manor about two miles to the south-east of Aston-near-Munslow, was in Saxon times held in part by the same Elmund who was Lord of Estune. As regards extent, I think that the Domesday Manor of Estune involved Munslow as a mem ber, and that the Church (indicated by the Domesday mention of a Priest) was subsequently transferred to Munslow as to a place which outstripped Aston in importance. We have already had similar instances of the transfer of Parish Churches, viz. from Patton to Long Stanton, and from Aldon to Stokesay. But other great changes have to be accounted for in the case before us, for at pre sent the identity of Estune with Aston-Munslow and Munslow rests only on the following view of the case, viz. that the Domes day Manor has no other possible representatives in the known area of Culvestan Hundred ; and that unless Estune be the Domesday antecedent of Aston and Munslow, the two latter have no Domes- day type. I now proceed to enumerate and, as far as I am able, to account for the changes above alluded to. \u2014 First. \u2014 Munslow became the caput of the collective Manor. This was, I presume, in the time of Henry I, when Munslow was fixed upon as the caput of the new Hundred, to which it has given 1 Domesday, so. 255, a, 1. v. 19"], [158, "130 MUNSLOW AND ASTON. a name, and which in great measure supplanted the older Hundred of Culvestan. Secondly.\u2014 Though Estune was of the Fief of Rainald the Sheriff, Aston and Munslow are not found in the Fief of Rainald's ordinary and almost uniform Successors, the Fitz Alans. This may be accounted for thus. There can be no doubt that the Fief of the Sheriff was for a time, long or short, in the hands of Henry I. In regranting it to the Ancestor of Fitz Alan, the King very pos sibly reserved Estune as the Manor which contained the Caput of the projected Hundred of Munslow, a Hundred which we cer tainly know was retained for the Crown. Or perhaps the Manor was surrendered to the Crown, the King wishing to make it inde pendent of Fitz Alan's Fief, and so better adapted for the centre of a new jurisdiction. Thirdly. \u2014 We find that Aston and Munslow collectively never equalled, as regards hidage, the great estimate given by Domesday for Estune. To meet this anomaly I suggest that the newly or ganized Manor or Manors may have been allowed, as a privilege, to stand at a lower hidage than their predecessor. Indeed I have often mentioned circumstances which suggest that Domesday hidage was essentially an estimate of liability to taxation, \u2014 an estimate formed with reference to presumed value rather than to any mea surement actually taken. If so, there is no absurdity in supposing that the reputed hidage of a Manor could at any time be lessened at will of the Crown. I proceed now to treat of Estune under its later status, and as represented by the two Manors of Munslow and Aston-Mimslow. jWunstoto and &stmt jWunstoto. The Hundredal Seigneury being, as I have said, retained by the Crown, the King (Henry I, I presume) granted the manorial estate to a subject, who will consequently have become a Shropshire Te nant in capite. Who this Grantee was, can, I think, be ascertained. We have seen that about the year 1115 a quarrel arose between the Monks of Wenlock and Stephen, Rector of Munslow, about certain Tithes. The Rector was non-suited by sentence of Richard"], [159, "131 MUNSLOW AND ASTON. de Belmeis, presiding over a judicial assembly at Castle Holgate. The proceedings incidentally mention the love and respect enter tained by the Monks for a person who is merely mentioned as \" Lord\" of the non-suited Rector.2 This person was then, I con ceive, Lord of Munslow. I think too that his name is given in another part of Belmeis' Patent, viz. in the Testing-Clause. The second Layman who attests is Richard Banastre,2 whom, on various grounds, I venture to name as Lord of Munslow and Aston Muns low in 1115, holding the same in capite under Henry I, and stand ing high in provincial importance. I think however that Richard Banastre was a greater man in Cheshire than in Shropshire. I cannot enlarge on a subject and a genealogy in which I obtain small help from the Historians of Cheshire. Suffice it for me to point out how, in May 1106, a Deed of Richard, Earl of Chester, and the Countess Ermentrude his Mother, names Richard Balaste (read Balastre or Banastre) as one of the Barons of Cheshire ;3 how also Richard Banaster stands next to the same Countess in the testing-clause of another Charter ;* how, lastly, between the years 1120 and 1128 the same Richard Banaster is a prominent witness to a Charter of Ranulf de Meschines, third Earl of Chester of his line.5 The successor of Richard Banaster, both in Cheshire and Shrop shire, was Thurstan Banaster, probably his Son. I refer to two Charters of Ranulph de Girnons, fourth Earl of Chester of his line, one of which shows how high Thurstan Banaster stood in the Pala tine Court of the Earl, while the other illustrates, though it does not prove, Thurstan Banasteris connection with Shropshire. These Deeds probably passed after 1141, and certainly before 1154. The first, a declaration by the Earl of Eustace fitz John's hereditary right to be Constable of Chester, is tested by Thurstan Banester as third witness, he having precedence of Norman de Verdon, Richard de Vernon, Walcheline Maminot, and William Malebenge, all men of Baronial rank.6 The other deed is Earl Ranulph's exemp tion of the Monks of Shrewsbury from payment of toll in the City and County of Chester. It is tested by Abbot Ralph (of Chester, I suppose). If so it passed after January 1141. The other wit ness is Turstan Banastre.7 The elder male line of Thurstan Banaster ended with himself or - Supra, Vol. Ill, p. 233 ; Vol. TV, p. 2. 3 \u25a0 4 ' s Leycester's Antiquities, pp. 115, 110, 127. 0 leycester's Antiquities, p. 161 7 Salop Chartulary, No. 312."], [160, "132 MUNSLOW AND ASTON. with his successor of the same name, and I think in the time of Henry II (1154-1189). There was indeed a Thurstan Banaster in Henry Ill's time, but he was clearly of a collateral line. Thurstan Banaster, whose male line expired in the twelfth century, left two daughters, his coheirs, viz. Margery wife of Richard fitz Roger, and Matilda wife of William de Hastings. Of William de Hastings, who was deceased in 1182, and left a son Henry, not then fifteen years of age, I shall speak presently. Richard fitz Roger was of Lancashire, in which county he seems to have had grants of land from John, Earl of Moreton, afterwards King of England. In May and July 1199 I find two Essoigns in a suit of land, wherein Ri chard fitz Roger and Matilda de Hastings were the Litigants.8 The cause was entered upon in August at Westminster. Matilda de Hastings (here called by her maiden name Matilda Banastre) ap peared against Richard fitz Roger, Margery his wife, and Robert de Stocf (read Stocport) their Attorney. The suit was about the shares of the sisters (Matilda and Margery) in certain lands ; hut as the Plaintiffs did not appear, judgment was given for Matilda, leaving to the Plaintiffs whatever right of recovery they could otherwise establish.8 I suppose it was before this sentence that Richard fitz Roger proffered a fine of 40 merks to King Richard that his wife might have her share of the lands of Thurstan Banaster her Father, which Fine seems to have been increased to 100 merks on the accession of King John.9 Richard fitz Roger was deceased in 1201, leaving Margery his wife surviving and five daughters his Coheirs. These were Matilda, then wife of Robert de Stockport, Margery, Avice wife of William Mulum, Quenilda and Amur, three of whom were unmarried. Various Fines followed, purporting to secure to Robert de Stockport his wife's share of Richard fitz Roger's lands, also the custody of his three unmarried Sisters-in-law, further to exempt the widow of Richard fitz Roger from any obligation to remarry.9 A Charter dated March 14, 1301, also secures some of John Earl of Moreton's grants to the heirs of the Grantee.9 Meanwhile Richard fitz Roger's Fine of 100 merks remained in arrear, and is so entered in the Warwickshire and Leicestershire Pipe-Roll of 1201.10 In 1204 \" Margery Banastre, widow of Ri chard fitz Roger,\" renewed this fine, adding a palfrey to the 100 merks, and stipulating that her husband's fine of 40 merks proffered 8 Rot.

Her object was to have a right share, as eldest Sister, of the lands of Thurstan Banastre her Father, which share her Sister Matilda refused to allow her.\"11 Early in 1206 Robert de Stockport seems to have been dead ; for Matilda Banastre, his widow I think, fines 20s. to have an assize concerning land in Appleby, Leicestershire, before the King him self.11 Certainly it was Matilda widow of Robert de Stockport, rather than her Aunt, Matilda, widow of William de Hastings, who calling herself Matilda Banastre, fined 20 merks and a palfrey with King John that she might not be compelled to marry, unless by her own wish and with the King's consent ; also that she might have her share, as eldest coheiress, of the lands of Richard fitz Roger, her Father, and Margery Banastre, her mother (both ap parently deceased) . The King's mandate issued accordingly to the Sheriffs both of Lancashire and Leicestershire.11 Cotemporarily William de Mulum with Avice his wife, and Thomas de Bothum with Amur* his wife, fined 20 and 40 merks respectively for the shares of the said Avice and Amur in the lands of their Father and Mother, \u2014 Richard fitz Roger and Margery Bandstre.11 I now close this branch of the subject remarking that the Leicestershire in heritance here mentioned, or part thereof, was the Manor of Little Appleby and the Advowson of Great Appleby,12 sometime held by Richard fitz Roger and Margery his wife under Ferrars Earl of Derby. BARONY OF HASTINGS. In the division of Thurstan Banaster's estates, Munslow and Aston fell undoubtedly to the share of Matilda wife of WilUam de Hastings. Their descendants became therefore Tenants in capite in Shropshire, and I must pause awhile to give some account of the origin of a House whose early history has never yet been treated with that accuracy which its subsequent greatness would seem to deserve. In the time of King Henry the Conqueror, or rather perhaps of William Rufus, there was one Radulphus, called Dapifer, because proof that in 1221 the Patron of Appleby Church was some heir of Richard fitz Roger. These considerations are impor tant to the Histories of other Counties, but , especially as furnishing a material 11 Rot. Fin. pp. 213, 347, 352-3. 12 Burton in his Description of Leices tershire (page 15) cites a Deed whereby Robert de Stokeport gave this Manor and Advowson in fee, to William de Vernon and his heirs. He dates the Deed in King John's time. Again (page 12) he adduces correction to the received genealogy of the so-called Barons of Stockport."], [162, "134 MUNSLOW AND ASTON. he held the hereditary Stewardship of the Abbey of St. Edmunds bury in Suffolk, an office which involved a tenure of three knights' fees in the estates of the Abbey. A Charter, more probably of Wil liam Rufus than of his Father, orders the restoration of certain lands (Lidgate and Blunham) to this Radulphus,13 which lands it seems were part of his fee as Steward of St. Edmundsbury. Between the years 1115 and 1119 Albold Abbot of St. Edmundsbury gives this Stewardship to Maurice de Windleshore, together with all the land which Radulphus Dapifer, Maurice's Predecessor, held therewith, adding other lands, to be held in fee and inheritance by service of two knights'-fees, over and above the former three.13 We can only suppose that Maurice de Windleshore was the heir of Radulphus, because his office was hereditary , and after his own death descended to a collateral heir. Also in 1130 Maurice de Windsor and Egidia his wife made an eleemosynary grant to Norwich Cathedral, the object being to establish a Cell or Convent of Monks to pray for the soul of Radulphus Dapifer ;13 \u2014 a fact most strongly suggestive of a blood relationship. Maurice r1# Windleshore was living in Stephen's reign (1135-1154) ; for that King confirmed to him his office and all his lands of whomsoever held.13 In the same reign he probably died, and without issue, as will presently appear. Cotemporary with Maurice de Windsor was William de Hastings, concerning whom some things are doubtful,14 but one thing certain, viz. that before 1130, being a claimant of the Master -Mar shalship of the Court of Henry I, against Gilbert Marshall and John his son (ancestors of the Earls of Pembroke) his claim was disallowed.15 It is proximately evident that this William de Hastings held a sub sidiary Office as one of the Stewards (Dispensatores) of the King's household, and also that his wife was Sister, and in her issue heir, of Maurice de Windsor. By this Lady, William de Hastings seems to have left two sons, Ralph and Hugh. Of Hugh I will speak 13 Brakelond's Chronicle (Camden So ciety), pp. 116, 118. of Robert, was identical with the William in the text, for the latter was apparently deceased in 1130, whilst Juliana, the wife of the former, was already a wealthy heiress in 1130 (Sot. Pip. 31 Hen. I, p. 58), and so must have been a diiferent person to the sister of Maurice de Wind sor, whose heirs at the time can only have been expectant. 14 Some accounts trace the pedigree of Hastings to Robert de Hastings, Port grcve of Hastings (See Collins, Vol. Ill, p. 84.). It is probable that there was such an Officer ; for in 1130 WilUam, son of Robert de Hastings is held accountable to the Crown for the Lestage of Hastings and Rye (Sot. Pip. 31 Hen. I, p. 68). But I cannot think that tliis William, son 15 Rot. Cart. 1 John, m. 13."], [163, "135 \u2014 Hugh de Robert de William de Hastings I. \u2014 * * * Sister, and, Maurice de Windsor (kinsman = Egidia.

That King, by a Charter which appears to have passed very soon after his accession, concedes and confirms to Ralph de Hastynges, Steward (Dapifero) of the Queen, and to his heirs, all the lands and Tenements formerly belonging to Ralph, Steward of St. Edmund's, and to Maurice de Windsor, maternal Uncle of the said Ralph de Hastings, of whatever fee the said lands were held. The King also expressly confirms the Stewardship of St. Edmund's to Ralph de Hastings as previously held by Ralph and Maurice, Stewards in the time of the King's Predecessors.16 It is remarkable that this Charter, passing as I suppose, in 1155, is addressed to the King's Lieges in Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, Bed fordshire, and Northamptonshire, in which five Counties (as also in Dorsetshire, Berkshire, and Middlesex) Maurice de Windsor is known to have had lands in 1130.17 Other proofs of the favour in which Ralph de Hastings stood with King Henry II are not wanting. He attests some of the King's earliest Charters. In 1156, 1157, and 1158 his lands in Middle sex, Berkshire, and Gloucestershire are exempted by Writ Royal from several current imposts.18 The King had himself given him 20 librates of land at Fordeham, Cambridgeshire, and 10 librates at Witham, in Somersetshire.18 His office in the household of Queen Eleanor is illustrated by his receipt of various large sums of Money, paid to him by the fiscal Officers of the Crown for the Queen's use.18 This Ralph de Hastings (about whom Dugdale says not a word) was deceased in 1165, and without issue. I must now revert to an earlier period in order that I may show more clearly how a second William de Hastings came to be his heir. William de Hastings, father of Ralph, seems to have had a younger son Hugh. This Wil liam (the Father of Ralph and Hugh) was, as I have said, apparently deceased in 1130. In that year Hugh de Hastings accounted for 90 merks and 2 Destriers, being the whole or the balance of a Fine which he had given to the King \" for having the land and the niece of Robert de Flamenvill.\"19 Erneburga daughter of Hugh de Flamville and niece and heir of Robert de Flamville, is known, on other evidence, to have married Hugh de Hastings.

A charter of King Henry II, which by its own in ternal evidence, must have passed in 1165 or 1166, confirms to Wil liam de Hastyngs, called by the King his own Steward (Dispensa tori),22 the Stewardship (dapifer atum) of St. Edmund's, with all its appurtenances, as Ralph the paternal Uncle (patruus) of the said William, or Maurice the maternal Uncle (avunculus) of the said Ralph, had held the same.23 Another Charter of Henry II confirms to William de Hastings his other heritages, paternal and maternal. This Charter seems to have been a Pedigree in itself. It mentions William de Hastings, the Grandfather, and Hugh de Hastings the Father of the Grantee, as living in time of Henry I. It also enumerates lands given to Robert de Flamenville by Robert de Limesi, Bishop of Coventry, and in time of Henry I, \u2014 lands given therefore between 1100 and 1117. It lastly shows Erneburga de Flamville to have been Mo ther of the Grantee, and to have stood in all other relations as the annexed Pedigree declares.24 I now turn to the Liber Niger, or Feodary of 1165, for a further illustration of this subject. \u2014 20 Rot. Pip. 31 Hen. I, passim. Serjeantry assumed at a later period is given by Dugdale (Baronage, ut supra). There were in Henry I's time, and after wards, several Dispensatores and several Dapiferi in the Royal Household, and most of their offices were hereditary. The subject would nil an interesting volume. 21 Dugdale's Baronage, p. 574, a. 22 It appears that the words Dapifer and Dispensator were indifferently applied to the office held by De Hastings in the Royal Household: also we observe that Ralph de Hastings' ministry in the Queen's Household was only a temporary arrange ment. The Serjeantry of De Hastings whereby he held in capite the Norfolk Manor of Ashele, was the same thing as his Royal Stewardship. It is always asso ciated with his office of Dispensator; and in one instance the Royal Pantry is men tioned as the department of these par ticular Stewards. The form which the I need hardly observe that the Steward ship of St. Edmund's, so often alluded to in the text, had no connection whatever with the Household Stewardship of De Hastings, though accidentally held by the same family. 23 Brakelond (ut supra), p. 120. 24 Dugdale's Baronage (ut supra). 20 V ."], [166, "138 MUNSLOW AND ASTON. There I find William de Hastings holding five fees in the Honour of St. Edmund,26 two fees of the Earl Ferrars (which, in time of Henry I, had been held by Robert de Chartres and Henry de Cune geston),25 one fee under Robert Marmiun,26 and one knight's-fee and twenty librates of land in the Honor of Clare.27 These were all of old feoffment. Of new feoffment William de Hastings had three fees in the Honour of Gloucester.28 This William de Hastings it was who married Matilda daughter and coheir of Thurstan Banaster : a match which still further in creased the inheritance of his descendants. In proof of his atten dance on the King's Court, I may instance his attestation of two Royal Charters : one of which passed at Woodstock, probably in March 1163,29 the other some years later, at Le Mans.30 In 1182 this William de Hastings was deceased. His wife Matilda Banaster survived him, to all appearance about forty years. His eldest son Henry was an Infant in 1182, and remained so at least six years later. This youth was under the protection of his Uncle Thomas de Hastings, said by Genealogists to have been Ancestor of the Earls of Huntingdon of the Hastings name. Brakelond tells us how on April 1, 1182, Thomas de Hastings appeared before the Abbot of St. Edmundsbury, with a great retinue of Knights, and leading his Ne phew Henry, not yet a knight, but for whom he demanded his he reditary office, here called by the Chronicler his Seneschalcy. The Abbot appears to have objected to the incompetence of such a youth, and a deputy was for a time appointed.31 In 1188 Robert de Flam vill, probably a relation of young Hastings, was acting in this be half.31 However in 1190 Henry de Hastings was old enough to ac company King Richard to Palestine ; and a Scutage assessed in 1191 on the fees held by him under St. Edmundsbury is excused on that account. It would seem that Henry de Hastings died in this ser vice or shortly after his return, and without issue; for in 1194 his Brother William proffered 100 merks for his Relief of the lands and Serjeantry of the said Henry, and 100 merks more for the King's Favour in regard that be did not then accompany the King into Normandy.32 This AVilliam de Hastings (third of his name) married Margery daughter of Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk, falsely supposed 25 Liber Niger, I, pp. 281, 220. 26 . 27 \u2022 28 ibidem, pp. 207, 294, 164. 29 Old Monasticon, I, 518. 32 Dugdale quoting Rot.

She essoigned her attendance under the common summons, an attendance which was probably due in respeot of her seigneury at Aston and Munslow, those vills being of her own, not of her late husband's inheritance. Her Essoignor in this instance was William fitz Aldith. The same person, on the same occasion, essoigned Matilda Banastre's appear ance in a suit wherein she was impleaded by Thomas Grossetost. William de Hastings (III) attended the Parliament of Lincoln in November 1200, when William, King of Scots, did homage to King John. In the same year a Feodary of St. Edmundsbury gives Wil liam de Hastinges as holding 5 knights'-fees under the Abbey, viz. 3 in Lidgate, Blunham, and Herlinge, and 2 in Tibenham and Gissing.34 I refer elsewhere for some further particulars concern ing this William de Hastings,35 to which I might add many more, but in so doing should be in danger of saying that of him which may refer to a cotemporary of the same name, and who had estates in some of the same Counties.36 It was clearly William de Hastings, the Steward, who was in rebellion against King John in 1216; for a Writ of April 10 orders the Constable of Norwich to destroy his Castles and lay waste his lands,37 whilst a second writ of April 22nd gives up to his Suzerain, the Abbot of St. Edmund's, all lands which he held in the Abbot's Fee.38 Another Writ of King John, dated at Clun, August 3, 1216, grants away William de Hastings' lands in Warwickshire and Leicestershire.39 On June 17, 1222, William de Hastings fines 10 merks for two hides in Astun (Shropshire), which Matilda Banister his Mother held in capite?0 To this period therefore I assign the death of his said Mother. His own decease will have taken place shortly before January 28, 1226, when Henry his son and heir, being of full age, had livery for a Fine of 50 merks. The King's precept, allowing the same, is addressed to the Sheriffs of Warwickshire, Leicestershire, Salop, Bedfordshire, Norfolk and Suffolk,41 those being the Counties where most of his lands lay. In 1235-6 I find mention of another Matilda de Hastings, holding ap- shire, but who is, when distinguished at all, called William de Hastings of Eton, from an estate which he had in Berkshire. 33 Dugdale (Baronage p. 547);\u2014 a mis take partly corrected by the same Author (p. 133). 34 Brakelond (ut supra), notes p. 88. 37. 33 . 39 Sot.

In or about 1240 we have Henry de Hastings (written Hastont) enrolled as Tenant-in-capite of one-fourth of a knight's-fee in Eston and Mosselawe.43 We have nearly cotemporary notices in the same Record of his Tenures under the Crown, the Earls Ferrars, the Lords Marmion, and others in several counties. Many of these estates were his inheritance from his Father, but many more had accrued by his own fortunate marriage with Ada, youngest sister and coheir of John Scot, Earl of Huntingdon. I have spoken on this subject before, under Worfield, and have carried down my ac count of this Barony some generations later.44 Here therefore I return to some more specific and earlier details connected with the Manors now before us. Munslow and Aston were in 1167 amerced half a merk and one merk respectively by Alan de Nevill, Justice of the Forest. At this time one or both of these Vills, or some part thereof, were, I think, held under Matilda Banaster and her husband by one Robert fitz Walkeline. This Robert fitz Walkeline was, I further think, the person who in 1165 held two Knights'-fees under the Earl Ferrars.45 If so, he aud William de Hastings, his Lord here, were fellow-vassals in another Fief. Robert fitz Walkeline joined the Rebellion of 1173, in which we have ample assurance that his Suze rain, the Earl Ferrars, was deeply involved.46 His tenure in Shropshire hereupon escheated to the Crown for a time ; \u2014 at least I thus explain the fact that in 1174 the Sheriff of Shropshire ac counts 51*. 4d. for the issues forth of the \"land of Robert fitz Walkeline, who was with the King's enemies.\" In 1187 the Vills of Musselawe and Eston were jointly amerced 40s. for some default (pro defect u). The debt was discharged in 1191. In October 1199 a Fine was levied between Robert Baratin, Plaintiff*, and Amicia, widow of Robert fitz Walkeline, Tenant, of a carucate of land in Meselawe, whereof was suit of mort d'ancestre.

Robert Baratin, for five merks, now renounced all his claim to Amicia and her heirs for ever. During the next fifty years I find no statement or hint as to the tenure of Aston and Munslow; nor can I indicate from other sources the succession of De Hastings' Feoffees in either Manor. Subsequently the two Manors have a history sometimes distinct, sometimes confused, and at all times fragmentary and unsatisfactory. In 1255 William de Venables was Mesne-lord of Munslow, holding the same of the fee of Henry de Hastings. The Vill was estimated at two hides. It did Suit to the Hundred, but paid neither Streward nor Motfee. Under Venables three Coparceners held the Manor. They are described as John de Chandurs, Ni cholas de Stubbings, and Dame Armetrewe*7 \u2014 a description which, being unable to illustrate, I will not venture to correct. At the same time Geoffrey de Lusignan, half-brother to Henry III,48 had Aston in custody with the infant heir of John de Hert walle49 (Hasting's late Feoffee there). The Vill was estimated at two hides. It did suit neither to County nor Hundred, and paid neither stretivard nor motfee. The Jurors of Munslow Hundred knew it to be of the Fee of Henry de Hastings. The Feodary of 1284 ostensibly gives account of the Vill of Munslow only, saying that Alice de Seymor and Adam de Herk wall held it of John de Hastings for a fourth-part of a knight's-fee. \u2014 1 suppose Alice de Seymour50 to have been Lady of Munslow, and Adam de Herkwalle Lord of Aston. At the Assizes of 1292 it was reported that the Vill of Aston and Munselowe used to appear at the Sheriff' s-Tourn, twice yearly, by four men and a Provost; and that one of the four men had been withdrawn twelve years pre viously by William de Munslow, a Tenant then deceased. The Sheriff was ordered to compel the Tenant then seized to appear. In March 1316 Robert de Beek is enrolled as Lord both of Munslow and Aston.51 He appears to have been Hastings' imme diate Tenant in Munslow at least; and in 1324 we shall find him son of Adam de Hortwall, and as grant ing in Aston.

Robert de Beek was of a very ancient Staffordshire family, holding two knights' fees in Over and Nether Tayne, etc. under the Barons Stafford. 49 John de Hertwalle or Herkwall, deceased in 1255, has, I think, occurred to us already under Corfton, viz. as John,"], [170, "142 MUNSLOW AND ASTON. disputing the right of Advowson with Sir John de Hastings. As to Aston, though not mentioned on this occasion, I have reason to think that the Hertwalls remained Hastings' Tenants there to a much later period. Among the Tenants of a still lower degree in Munslow and Aston, that is, those who holding under one or other of the greater Tenants, were actually the resident occupants of the lands, I may name a few. \u2014 William de Camera of Aston has already occurred to us in 1249.52 We have also had mention of Roger de Furches of Aston, of whose family I have given account under Corfton. Before 1255 John de Wigley, Thomas de Stoke, Thomas Clerk of Munslow, John fitz Robert of Munslow, John de Aston, Henry de Ernwood, and Roger de Hordeslee were Under- Tenants in Aston, Munslow, or Corfton. In October 1258 William de Corfton sues Roger de Hordesley for disseizin in Eston. In June 1259 the latter person, called Roger de Haderlegh, and his wife sue William fitz Elen and others for disseizin in Aston. In 1259 Roger Ernold of Munslow is amerced 20s. for a false oath. About the same time we hear of one Robert de Munslow. In 1262 Thomas de Munslow was a Regarder of the Long Forest. In the same year it was found by the Justices of the Forest that the Bosc of Sir Roger de Ridware at Munslow was wasted of old time. In 1267 we find the latter person described as Roger de Redewelle. He with Agnes his wife sued Thomas le Clerk of Munslow and John de Brewes (Braose) for disseizing them of a messuage and half a virgate in Munslow. Thomas le Clerk pleaded that he claimed nothing in the premises but a tenure of thirty years, by demise of William de Estanford, father of Agnes the Plaintiff. He produced the lease in question, but was non suited. Among his Sureties was Henry de Aston.53 In this same year Thomas de Munslow was amerced half a merk for some non-attendance (quia non venit). In July 1271 John de Breus was suing Roger de Clifford, Senior, Roger, his Son, and Stephen Tyrel for disseizin in Munslow. At the Assizes of 1272 Robert de Musselawe was a Juror for Munslow Hundred. In November 1277 there was a Fine levied between William de Munsselowe, Clerk, Plaintiff, and Roger de Ridware and Agnes his wife, Impedients, of a messuage, 4\\ virgates, and 18s. rent in Munslow and Aston. Roger and Agnes acknow ledged the premises to be the Plaintiff's by their own gift, \u2014 to hold 52 Supra, Vol. IV, p. 5. | 53 Salop Assizes, 51 Hen.

The Plaintiff or rather Feoffee in this case was probably the same person with William-in-the-hole, Clerk, of Munslow, whom we have seen with other cotemporary tenants in Aston and Munslow attesting a Deed given under Corf ton.54 In January 1284 Robert de Munselow was Foreman of a Ludlow Jury. At the Assizes of 1292 Henry de Aston was a Juror for Munslow Hundred, whilst Margaret the widow, and William the Infant son of William de Munslow, deceased, were the persons called to account in the matter of that withdrawal of suit which I have noticed above. The names of some later Tenants in Aston and Munslow may be found in the Deeds quoted under Corfton.54 MUNSLOW CHURCH AND BARISH. The Domesday Church of this Parish was, as I have already said, probably situated at Aston. We have seen however that before the year 1115 the Church was known as the Church of Munslow, and that it claimed a certain parochial jurisdiction55 which shows that its Parish was one of the original and extensive Saxon Parishes of Shropshire. In 1252 the King presented to Munslow Church, du ring the minority of Henry de Hastings' heir. On Sunday, April 23, 1290, Munslow Church was visited by Bishop Swinfield.56 No Procurations seem to have been furnished by the Rector, who was probably non-resident. The Taxation of 1291 values the Church of Munslow, in Wenlock Deanery, at iSll. 6s. 8d. per annum. This was the Rectory. The Vicar's Portion, as it is called, was under \u00a34?7 In 1341, the Taxa tion of \u00a315. 6s. 8d. being first quoted, the Assessors of the Ninth rated this Parish at \u00a33. only.58 The corn had been destroyed by storms : there had been a general murrain among the sheep, and five carucates of land lay untilled. Moreover the Glebe'and Altar ages of the Church were included in the Church-Taxation, but ex cluded from the current assessment. The Valor of 1534-5 gives the preferment of John Lytilton, Rector of Monslowe, as worth, in glebe and tithes, \u00a322. 16s. 8d.

John de Covintre was presented January 14, 1252, by the Crown, as having custody of Henry de Hastings' heir.60 B,obert de Sheppeye was Rector in 1311, when, on April 27, he presents William de Tikenhale to the Vicarage. The Rectory was vacant in 1324, and the right of patronage contested between Sir John de Hastings and Robert Bek. A King's Writ of May 12 forbids the Bishop to admit any Parson pendente lite ; but another Writ of July 21 certifies that Hastings is the Patron. Meanwhile, that is, on June 26, Sir John de Hastings had presented \u2014 Master William de Lodelowe. The same person called \u2014 Master William de Routon, being Rector here, was cited in 1333 for non-payment of Procurations. In 1337 he was excom municated, and a Writ was out for his arrest. On his (\" Master William de Lodalowe's\") death, viz. on July 22, 1349 \u2014 Adam de Hopton, Clerk, was presented by the King as Custos of the land and heir of Sir Laurence de Hastings, late Earl of Pem broke.61 Sir William Rychardyn, Priest, was instituted Oct. 3, 1371 ; \u2014 on presentation of Sir John de Hastings, Earl of Pembroke, Lord Wexford and Abergavenny. A Commission of December 13, 1385, concerns charges of scandalous immorabty against this Rector ; and on March 8, 1386, he has the Bishop's dispensation for five years' absence, and license to demise the fruits of his Church, for that period, to Sir Richard Talbot, Lord of Blakmere. Rychardyn re signed in 1396, exchanging benefices with \u2014 Sir William Cachepolle, who on May 5, 1400, again ex changes with \u2014 Sir Richard Leynwardin, late Rector of Dale, in Canterbury Diocese. 59 Valor Ecclesiasticus, III, 209. 60 Patent, 36 Hen.

When, on the forfeiture of Earl Robert de Belesme, all his Seigneu ries reverted to Henry I, that King, re-arranging the Hundreds of Shropshire, made Munslow the Caput of its Hundred, which Hundred mainly represented the more anciept ones of Culvestan and Patinton. Corfham then became simply a Manor of Royal Demesne. It was combined with two adjacent Manors, Culmington and Siefton, and all three came to the hands of Henry II, as con stituting an estate of Royal Demesne, whose fiscal value was \u00a331. 1 Domesday, so. 253, b, 1.

I have told, under Ditton Priors, how this estate was, together with the said Ditton, given by Henry II, in the first year of his reign (1155) to Hugh de Periers, and how it so remained till the death of Hugh de Periers, about Christmas 1175.4 Then Corfham, Culmington, and Siefton reverted to the King, and from then till Michaelmas 1177 the Sheriff accounts at the rate of \u00a331. per annum for these Manors, as if they again constituted an estate of Royal demesne, rated at so much in the County Ferm. But at Michaelmas 1178 this plan was altered. \u2014 The Sheriff, de scribing the whole estate as the land of Corfham, claims quittance for himself of \u00a331. (the previous year's ferm thereof), saying that he, the Sheriff, had delivered up the same according to the King's precept.5 And this entry is in substance repeated on every Pipe- Roll till the year 1190. The truth is that about Michaelmas 1177 the King bad granted this estate to a subject, and the reason why the Grantee's name was so unusually excluded from a public docu ment bke the Pipe-Roll, is not difficult to discover. \u2014 The Grantee in question was Walter de Clifford, Father of King Henry's Para mour, Fair Rosamond. The gift was, in short, the wages of dis honour, \u2014 wages long in arrear and at length paid stealthily. Policy perhaps as much as shame dictated the concealment ; for Henry's affairs, both in relation to Queen Eleanor and the kingdom, had only recently recovered from a crisis which had wellnigh overwhelmed him.

I can add no thing to what Dugdale has said about Richard fitz Ponce, except that he was living in or after the year 1115,7 and Walter de Clif ford, his son, had succeeded him before 1138.8 Of Walter de Clif ford's conduct during the war of succession which ensued, we know nothing. A close attention to Chronology will however supply, in connection with his name, some traits in the character, and some facts in the career, of a greater personage. Henry, Duke of Nor mandy, was of the age of nineteen years and two months when on May 18, 1152, he married the Princess Eleanor of Poitou, who six weeks previously had been divorced by Louis VII of France. The match was a hasty one, but to Duke Henry it promised great poli tical advantages. On the other hand the beauty and attractions of the Princess had already been blackened by tales of the foulest scandal. On Eleanor's fidelity, whilst the wife of Henry Planta genet, I believe no imputation has ever been thrown. Her excesses as Queen of England were of another kind. Let us see how far they may have been provoked by the conduct of her husband. Prince William, be it observed, the eldest son of Duke Henry and Eleanor, was born on August 17, 1153; Prince Henry, their second son, on Feb. 18, 1155. On January 6th, 1153, Duke Henry had landed in England to make a great effort for his Crown. After the campaign and the well-known treaty with Stephen, he recrossed to Normandy on April 4, 1154. In this interval commenced, and du ring a great part of this interval continued, the amour of Henry with Rosamond, daughter of Walter de Clifford. The result was that the births of William and Geoffrey, the two sons of Henry and Rosamond, took place between the births of William and Henry, the two eldest children of Henry and Eleanor !9 The first notice which I have of Walter de Clifford after Henry II's accession, is a grant of 10*. to him, paid in 1158 by order of the King through the Sheriff of Herefordshire.10 This may have been connected with the successful expedition which, as Keeper of ' He attests a Charter of Bernard, Bi shop of St. David's, who was consecrated in that year (Carte's MSS.

Caput 17, so. 274). account (p. 547, a, ibidem) would make the transaction later, viz. in the time of Abbot Gilbert (1139-1147) ; but this tes timony is of inferior weight. 8 Walter de Clifford exchanged the Manor of East-leach for that of Glasbury with Gloucester Abbey before 1138, when King Stephen confirmed the transaction (Monasticon, I, 551, b). The Monastic 9 The seniority of Geoffrey, Archbishop of York, over Prince Henry is distinctly noted by the Biographer of the former (Anglia Sacra, II, 378). 10 Rot. Pip. 4 Hen.

Walter de Clifford's name is connected with many eleemosynary charters which, whether we consider them as works of piety or re morse, tell us something further of his family and private concerns. His grant to Dore Abbey of Canterselif seems to have been made in hope that a subject Abbey would be founded at the latter place. It was made with consent of his wife Margaret and all his heirs. It was for the souls' health of himself and his wife, their parents, and their sons and daughters, also of Osbern fitz Hugh (who has been said to have married a daughter of Clifford). The Deed is attested by David, Bishop of St. David's (1147-1176), Osbern fitz Hugh, Margaret de Clifford, Walter de Clifford the younger (juvene), Rosa mund his Sister, Ralph de Bascherville, and others.16 This Charter probably passed before the year 1173 ; \u2014 a date de termined by a series of events which evidently were subsequent, and which I must incorporate in my story. In March 1173 Prince Henry left his Father's Court in Normandy, and sought that of his Father-in-law, Louis VII of France. The Princes Richard and Geoffrey followed their Brother ; and Queen Eleanor, who, actuated as it is said by jealousy, had planned this domestic rebellion, also absconded. The Queen fell into the hands of her husband, and with 11 Powel, p. 152. William fitz Osbern, Earl of Hereford, they forget that, if daughter of Ralph de Toni, the said Margaret was niece of Wil liam fitz Osbern's wife who was sister of the said Ralph. 12 . is . 14 jjiier mger, I, 174, 150, 149. 15 Liber Ruber Scaccarii, so. xlix. 16 Monasticon, V, 555, No. viii. \u2014 Margaret wife of Walter de Clifford (I), is said, with probability, to have brought him Clifford Castle vnfrank-mar riage, she being a daughter of Ralph de Toni, Domesday Lord of that Castle.

Immediately on the Queen's imprisonment, Rosamond Clifford became openly and avowedly the Paramour of the King.17 For an indefinite time pre vious she had been secretly domiciled at Woodstock. The Charter above quoted must have passed still further back and before she left her Father's House. The avowed profligacy of Henry's conduct, dating as I have said in 1 1 73, is curiously parallelled by another event of that year. Rosa mond's second son, Geoffrey, though not yet twenty years of age, was actually elected Bishop of Lincoln, and this was doubtless by the King's procurement. However the Mother's career ended soon after the change in her position. She died then about 1175-6, for I cannot put a wider construction on the expression of the Chro nicle,18 and was buried at Godstow,\u2014 a place ostensibly dedicated to the holiness of female chastity ! There are two Charters to Godstow Nunnery, which, passing as they did within ten years of Rosamond Clifford's death, next claim our attention. Walter de Clifford for his soul's health, and for the souls of his wife Margaret and their daughter Rosamond, gave to the Nuns aforesaid his Mill of Framton, with a meadow near thereto. Also he gave them his Salt-pit in Wich. This he did with consent of the King (Henry II), and of his own heirs. And Walter de Clifford Junior, calling himself son and heir of the Grantor, con cedes the gift in a distinct clause of the Charter. There were wit nesses of the whole, Osbern fitz Hugh, Hugh de Say, Richard de Clifford, William his Brother, Richard de Karesi, William Char bunell.19 Osbern fitz Hugh's cotemporary grant to Godstow I have already given in another place,20 and I have only here to repeat that it men tions, more precisely than the last Deed, the previous death of Mar garet and Rosamund Clifford, and the burial of both at Godstow. Of Walter de Clifford's grant to Haughmond Abbey between 1177 and 1185 I shall speak under Culmington. The cotemporary benefactions of Osbern fitz Hugh to that house have been already noticed. I have said that Walter de Clifford died about 1190. We have seen also that he had three sons, Walter, the eldest, Richard, and William. It is quite certain and very remarkable that \u2014 \"7 Bromton, p. 1151. 19 Monasticon, IV, p. 366, xiii. ;\u00b0 Supra, Vol. IV, p. 306. 13 Sed ilia cito obiit (Bromton)."], [183, "151 BARONY OF CLIFFORD. Richard de Clifford, the second son, succeeded to Corsham and the Shropshire estates of the Father, \u2014 and this for a Fine of 300 merks proffered to and accepted by King Richard I, before Michael mas 1190.21 The Sheriff of that year deducts \u00a331. from his lia bilities for the ferm of Corsham in the same mode as had been used during the life of Walter de Clifford (I), but the Pipe- Roll also con tains Richard de Clifford's Fine, of which 130 merks had already been paid. And on the Roll of 1191 the Sheriff claims quittance for this \u00a331. for the Manor of Corsham, adding that Richard de Clifford had the same by the King's order ; \u2014 which entry is repeated on the annual Rolls to the year 1199 inclusive. Also Richard de Clifford's Fine, all but 21| merks, had been liquidated in 1193, and the balance had been assured by the undertaking of a third person. The inquiry now arises as to why Richard I thus ignored the rights of the elder Brother and dictated or allowed this anomalous succession. For want of a positive answer I venture on a sug gestion. Of all Henry's sons, Richard Duke of Aquitaine was the most distinguished for steady devotion to the cause and person of his Mother. Under the circumstances of the Royal pair, Richard's affection for his Mother necessarily implied hostility to his Father. This hostility was increased, if we may believe the story, by a monstrous personal injury suffered by Richard himself. In January 1168, during a temporary peace between Louis VII and Henry, Richard, then a boy in his eleventh year, did homage to the King of France for the Duchy of Aquitaine, and was affianced to Adelais the infant daughter of Louis. The care and education of the Prin cess was entrusted to her intended Father-in-law. She was con veyed to England, and it is broadly asserted by one ofthe Chroniclers that on the death of Rosamond Clifford the affianced bride of Rich ard became the mistress of King Henry. There is too much reason to believe this story. Subsequent events strongly corroborate it. Henry sought a divorce from Queen Eleanor in order, it is supposed, that he might marry Adelais. Philip Augustus peremptorily de manded the surrender of the Princess, his Sister, and Richard, whose earliest love had been thus atrociously outraged, leagued himself with the French King and defied his Father. On Henry's death, Richard's first act was to liberate his Mother. While Richard was occupied with the affairs of Normandy, Eleanor 21 Rot. Pip. 2 Ric. I, Salop.

Two years later and a Bishop of Lincoln ordered the body of Rosamond Clifford to be removed from its sepulchre in the Church of Godstow, and to be buried without the walls. All these things com 'ined, certify us of some thing further, and more relevant to our provincial subject. We learn the severity with which Richard will have regarded everything con nected with the infamous passions and crimes of his Father ; we learn the disgust with which he must have listened even to the name of Clifford, so associated with his Mother's wrongs. What wonder then if when, according to established routine, he was called upon to confirm his Father's grant of one of the finest Crown estates in Shropshire to the heir of the first Grantee, he should have refused to do so, though he gave it to a younger brother ? Of Richard de Clifford, Lord of Corsham and Culmington during the remainder of King Richard's reign, I have nothing further to say at present. A curious problem now demands our notice. \u2014 It is evident that \u2014 Walter de Clifford (II) was seized, during Richard's reign, of other estates of his inheritance, though not of Corsham. I offer a few incidental hints of this fact. His influence, as one of the Lords Marchers of Herefordshire, is shown in the circumstance that in 1191 he had custody of Knighton Castle. This trust was appa rently his by the direction of the Chancellor, Longchamp, by whose orders the Sheriff of Worcestershire paid Walter de Clifford 25 merks for the purpose in question. Also the Sheriff of Shropshire paid for 60 hogs required by Walter de Clifford for the stores of Knighton Castle.33 Again in 1194 the scutage on a knight's-fee in Berkshire was charged to the name of Walter de Clifford.23 The same thing recurred in 1196, when also Walter de Clifford was charged with scutage on half a knight's-fee in Wiltshire.23 He was also charged with the scutage of 1199 in Berkshire.33 But King John had been crowned little more than two months, when the following Fine appears on the Rolls : \u2014 \u2022\" Walter de Clifford gives the King 300 merks to have the King's confirmation of the Manor of Corfam and of Colminton, and of the Haye of Ernestre and of Les Clies.\"34 Before September 29, 1199, he had paid 50 merks of this Fine into the Treasury. He was acquitted of .\u20ac19. 8s. 9d. more, in respect of disbursements which, as Sheriff f 22 Rot. Pip. 3 Ric. I, Worcestershire aud Salop. 24 Rot. Fin. 1 John, m. 17 ; Rot.

Herefordshire in the year then ended, he had made over and above his receipts.33 The balance of \u00a3147. 4s. 7d. was discharged in sub sequent years. Now the King's Charts \u00ab, which was secured by this Fine, is ex tant. \u2014 It bears date at Chambrais August 3, 1199, and gives the premises to Walter de Clifford and his heirs, to hold of the King by service of one Knight's-fee. It moreover grants the premises with all appurtenances, \" as King Richard, our Brother, granted and confirmed the same to Richard de Clifford, the Grantee's bro ther, whose heir the said Walter is.\"26 The Charter then appa rently supposes the previous death of Richard de Clifford without issue. Whether Richard de Clifford was really so deceased is the problem before us. If he was, then Walter de Clifford had still another brother Richard to dispute his title.27 In short, either the Richard de Clifford named in King John's Charter proved to be living, or another Richard de Clifford contested the Charter ; and if so, probably on the ground that King Richard's previous grant had made Corsham the appanage of a younger brother. This pro blem I will not attempt to solve, but will give the progress of the litigation between the two Brothers as far as I can collect it. \u2014 In Easter Term 1200 a day of that Term (April 17) was given to Walter de Clifford and Richard his Brother concerning the land of Korfham. The Litigants were to appear before the King him self, if he should be in England, on the given day ; if not, then they were to appear at Westminster. Richard de Clifford named Oliver de Bekelay (perhaps Berkeley) his Attorney ad lucrandum velper denduin.-9 On the day given Walter de Clifford essoigned himself by Fulk de Beinfeld and Robert Clerk.29 A postponement of a fortnight was allowed by the Court. The further process of this interesting case, and consequently the pleadings, are, I fear, lost. We have however the result in a Fine levied at Westminster in Michaelmas Term 1200. It purports to be between Richard de Clifford, Plaintiff, and Walter de Clifford, his Brother,\u2014 Tenant, of Corsham and of Clyes and of Colminton, and of the Haye of Er nestrie, whereof was suit between the parties. Richard de Clifford now renounces all claim of himself or his heirs, and in favour of Walter and his heirs. In return, Walter de Clifford gives to 25 Rot. Pip. 1 John, Salop. 26 Rot.

Richard de Clifford and his heirs, begotten of Leticia de Berkelay his wife, the whole Manor of Framton, \u2014 to hold of the Grantor by service of one Knighf s-fee ; but in case the Grantee should have no issue by his said wife, the Manor was (at his death) to revert to the Grantor and his heirs. Moreover the said Walter gave to the said Richard a life annuity of \u00a310., to be paid in equal half-yearly payments by the hands of Hugh de Dunre and John de Solers, and, in case of their deaths before the death of the Annuitant, to be similarly paid by their heirs. And further, Richard, for his life, was to be quit of the Knight's service reserved on Framton to Walter, and was to render only the King's and Chief-Lord's ser vices due thereon ; but the heirs of Richard, begotten of Leticia as aforesaid, were afterwards to render the knight's service, temporarily released, by one Knight doing ward at Clifford Castle for forty days. Hugh de Dunre and John de Solers, being present at this agreement, undertook for themselves and their heirs to fulfil the conditions regarding the above annuity of \u00a310.30 All that we can say of this is, that Richard de Clifford's claim on Corsham, etc., must have been very cogent, otherwise so valuable a consideration would not have been given for its abandonment. One of Walter de Clifford's first acts on obtaining or securing his possession of these Shropshire estates, was a grant to Haugh mond Abbey. He gave to the Canons, for the sustenance of their Kitchen and their refections in fresh fish, the Mill of Culmitone and the Mill of Syneton (Siefton) ; also half a virgate in Syneton, with a messuage pertaining to the latter mill ; also all usual suit and aid due from his Tenants of Culmitone in support and in re pair of the said Mills. The Deed mentions the previous interests of Walter de Clifford, the Grantor's Father, and of Hugh de Pe rares (Periers) in the premises. The witnesses were Hugh de Ferrars31 (the husband, that is, of the Grantor's Great-niece, Mar garet de Say) ; Walter de Clifford son of Walter the Second (son, that is, of the Grantor) ; Simon Falconer, then Seneschal.33 It is a very remarkable circumstance that the Canons of Haugh mond obtained a confirmation from \" Richard, son of Walter de Clifford,\" of the above grant. This, I take it, was done ex abun danti cauteld ; and either during the progress of the litigation be tween the Brothers, or else in forestalment of any future revival of Richard de Clifford's claim, notwithstanding the fine of October 30 Pedes Fimum, 2 John, Salop. i 31 He died in 1204.

The witnesses of Richard de Clifford's Confirmation were Reginald de Balun and Robert Corbeth, \u2014 names which accord well with its supposed date. The trust and favour with which Walter de Clifford (II) was almost continuously regarded by King John are proved by numerous entries on the Rolls of that reign. We find him sometimes in per sonal attendance at Court ; sometimes he is the Custos of Royal Castles, either that of Hereford or those on the Welsh Border of Herefordshire. Onewhile he has a present of Deer from the King's Forest. Hostages and escheated lands are entrusted to his keeping, the latter sometimes for his own personal benefit. He held the Shrievalty of Herefordshire in 1199, and again for another period, commencing at least as early as April 1205, and ending in May 1208. His conduct in this office seems to have been extremely rapacious ; but a Fine of 1000 merks prevented any troublesome inquiries, and secured the King's good will, suspended, it would ap pear, at the moment.33 This was in the Summer of 1208, and a document of the previous year distinguishes this Walter de Clifford from his son of the same name by the appellation Vetus.M It is probable indeed that at the time he was upwards of seventy years of age ; and though he lived till 1220, it is very doubtful whether some intermediate appearances of a person called merely Walter de Clifford do not belong to the Son. It was however Walter de Clifford the elder who, in June 1211, was returned as holding the Manor of Corsham by gift of King Henry II and by service of one knight's-fee, \"which Manor\" the Record says most intelligibly \" used to render \u00a331. ,\"35 i. e. to the Royal Exchequer, yearly. Again it was Walter de Clifford the elder who about August 1213, and in consequence of his Brother Richard's death, gave King John 100 merks and a palfrey for custody of the lands and heirs of the said Richard. The said heirs were to be married at the King's will, and the Sheriff of Gloucestershire was to be reimbursed his outlay on certain buildings at Frampton,30 \u2014 an outlay apparently incurred since the estate came into the King's hand by Richard de Clif ford's death. Again, when on April 30, 1215, we find Walter de Clifford summoned, with other Barons then at Gloucester, to meet the King with horses and arms at Cirencester,37 we should suppose that Walter de Clifford the elder was concerned. However the co- 33 Rot. Pip. 10 John, Herefordshire. 34 Rot. Finium, p. 458. 35 Testa de Nevill, p. 56. \u00e6 Rot. Finium, p. 485. * Rot.

The same doubt arises as to the identity of that Walter de Clifford who on May 28, 1216, was commissioned to treat with Reginald de Braose, and to bring him to King John ;39 and who on August 8, 1216, was appointed one of the Keepers of Beauchamp's Castle of Elmley.40 However Walter de Clifford the elder died shortly before January 23, 1221, when the Sheriffs of Wiltshire and Salop were ordered to give his lands to Walter Junior, his son and heir.41 A word now as to \u2014 Agnes de Cundy, Lady of Cavenby and Glentham, the great heiress who as wife of Walter de Clifford (II) so materially in creased the importance of his House. In November and December 1194, I find Walter de Clifford (II) concerned in litigation about lands in Kent.42 Doubtless these lands were at Wickham or some other Kentish estate of his wife Agnes. Also Walter de Clifford's interest in Essex, mentioned in 1198,43 probably accrued with the same Agnes. His contest in 1199 and 1200 with the Lincolnshire Abbey of New-house about a Nottinghamshire Advowson,44 his grants to the Lincolnshire Abbey of Barlings and the Nottingham shire Nunnery of Brodholm45 are facts which faintly indicate the great estates which were of Agnes de Cundy's inheritance in those Counties. In 1201 Walter de Clifford's fine of fifteen merks that he should not be compelled to cross the seas in the King's service, shows him to have been a Tenant in capite of five knights' -fees, and the Fine too is registered under Nottinghamshire.46 About March 1208 a Fine was tendered singly by Agnes, wife of Walter de Clifford, \u2014 viz. one palfrey that she might hold all her life her Manor of Wicham (in Kent), and that her Tenants there might be quit of certain suits and aids.47 The King's Patent of March 20th grants the privileges sought, in corresponding terms,48 but the ano- 33 Liber Ruber, so. cxlv. only add that Roger de Cundy, her Fa ther, held in 1165, no less than eight knights'-fees under the Bishop of Lincoln (Liber Niger, I, 261).

It certifies that Walter, \" Chaplain of Agnes, wife of Walter de Clifford Senior,\" in journeying any whither through the said Walter's Manors, is under Royal letters of safe-con duct, without any limit as to time.50 Many of the circumstances which I have now narrated had sug gested to my mind the idea that Walter de Clifford (II) was inter mittently or continuously imbecile during the last few years of his life. I have however met with extracts from a most interesting document, \u2014 the Will of Dame Agnes Clifford,51 \u2014 which exhibit the Lady in a less independent position than the King's Patents, and show also that, when the Will was made, her husband was both living and competent to act. We know not indeed the date of this Will, that is, how long it preceded Walter de Clifford's death, and so the doubt about his state in the last few years of his life may remain. I pass to the Document itself. Thereby Dame Agnes de Clifford be queaths 100 solidates of land to the Prior and Convent of the Holy Trinity {i. e. the Cathedral Monastery) at Canterbury. This bequest was together with her body in burial, by consent of her Lord, Walter de Clifford. To the Augustine Monastery at Canterbury she gives 40s., to St. Gregory's Church, 20s., and to the Church of St. Sepul chre, 20s. Her bequest to Wenlock Priory follows, as I have al ready given it.53 As a provision for Basilia her daughter {Basili\u00e6 fili\u00e6 me\u0153 consulend\u0153), she leaves 20 merks ; to Dame Cecilia, 5 merks; to Walter her son, a golden ring ; to her own Mother,53 a ring ; to her sons, Roger, Richard, Simon, and Giles, some bequest un- specified ; and to each of her daughters a golden ring. To fulfil this her Testament she certifies that her Lord, Walter de Clifford, has conceded the issues of the Manor of Cavenby arising in the year after her death. She appoints as her Executors Sir Walter de grants her some privileges in the Forest of Brill in Buckinghamshire. She was then resident at Middleton, a Manor which, if I mistake not, was in Oxfordshire, and constituted part of the Fief first held by De Cundy and afterwards by Clifford of the See of Lincoln. 49 Rot.

Clifford, the Bishop of Hereford, and the Prior of Christ-Church, Canterbury. Walter de Clifford (III), with whom I now proceed, attested his Father's Charter to Haughmond in the very beginning of the thirteenth century. On May 23, 1208, he was sent from Winchester by King John to certify his Father that his successor in the Shrievalty of Herefordshire had been appointed.54 Omitting many problema tical notices of a Walter de Clifford, which occur from this time forward without distinguishing Father and Son, I insert others which certainly relate to the Son only, and in which he is usually distin guished as Junior or Juvenis. In February 1210 King John sends letters from The Tower to Walter de Clifford Juvenis}1 In the sequel of that year we have repeated proofs of his being in Ireland with the King.56 On August 14, 1215, King John appointed him Sheriff of Herefordshire in succession to Nicholas de Lymesye,57 and on the 18th of November made him Custos of the See of Hereford, vacant by the death of Bishop Giles de Braose.58 On February 25, 1216, he was ordered to resign the latter trust to another ;59 and on August 15, 1216, Walter de Lacy was appointed his Successor in the Shrie valty.60 That this was no sign of the Royal displeasure we find from a Writ of August 19, whereby the King gives Dimmoc to Walter de Clifford Junior, to maintain him in the Royal service.61 His steadfast adherence to King John is certified by his attestation of a Royal Charter at Lincoln, on September 28, 1216, \u2014 just three weeks before the King's death. On October 28, 1217, Dimmack, which had been temporarily seized for the Crown as Royal demesne, was restored to Walter de Clifford by writ of Henry III.63 On January 22, 1221, succeeding to his paternal inheritance, his Relief is fixed at \u00a3100. 63 The same year he had the usual letters of scutage, he being personally with the King at the siege of Biham. On De cember 16, 1231, he fines \u00a3100. for custody and marriage of the heirs of his deceased Brother Roger.64 In August 1233 Walter de Clifford, \" a distinguished soldier,\" is noticed as one of the Con federates of Richard, Earl Marshall. The King precipitated their threatened rebellion by \" denouncing the said Confederates as pro scribed exiles, without judgment of his Court or sentence of their Peers. He ordered their personal arrest, and gave their lands to 54 Rot.

Similar Writs to the Sheriffs of Kent, Oxfordshire, and Lincolnshire, ordered the seizure of Clifford's lands in those Counties.66 The treason of Walter de Clifford was very short-lived. A Patent of September 1, 1233, dated at Haye, gives safe-conduct through the King's land to Rich- ard fitz Simon and others of Clifford's men who were in garrison at Clifford Castle. A second Patent, dated at Montgomery on Sep- tember 16, gives safe-conduct to Walter de Clifford himself, in com- ing to the King to treat of peace. On March 17, 1234, H. de Tru- blevill is ordered to give up Clifford Castle to its Lord, to whom the King had restored it. At Michaelmas 1235 and Easter 1236 Wal- ter de Clifford was separately assessed in Shropshire for his propor- tion of the Aid due on marriage of the King's Sister. He paid in all \u00a31. 18s. 2d., that is, at the rate of 2 merks per fee, on one fee of old feoffment, and one-third and one-tenth of a fee of new feoffment.67 These additions to the original service of one fee will be explained elsewhere. In November 1236 a Fine was levied between Richard Prior of Little Malvern, Plaintiff, and Walter de Clifford, Defor- ciant, of 90 quarters {summis) of corn, (value \u00a313. 10s.), being the arrears of an annual due of 6 quarters claimed by the Prior. Clifford undertook to pay the due in future at Corsham, and the Prior re- mitted the arrears. I doubt not that it was in respect of this Law- suit that Walter de Clifford figures on the Pipe-Roll of 1238 as owing the King 20 merks for unjust detention. In or about 1240 we have Walter de Clifford's Shropshire Tenure entitled a Barony.66 It may however be a question whether the expression could properly be used, except with reference to his collective estates, here and elsewhere. In Trinity Term 1243, and again in Easter Term 1244, I find allusion to another Suit between the Prior of Little Malvern and Walter de Clifford. Walter de Clifford was now of advanced age and the father of an only child, a female. To this we may attribute a Patent of April 30, 1244, which intimates the King's desire that a contract of mar- 05 Wendover, Vol. IV, p. \"271. M Originalia, 17, Hen.

We shall recur to this subject again. In or about the month of January 1250 Walter de Clifford again appears in a rebellious attitude. \" Being,\" says the Chronicler, \" not least among the Barons Marchers, in power, wealth, and pri vileges, he was accused of violent and disgraceful treatment of a King's Messenger. He had compelled the said Functionary to swallow, seal and all, the Royal Epistle of which he was bearer. Clifford submitting to the King's sentence, hardly escaped forfeiture and death. He lost however his franchises {libertatem), was fined 1000 merks, and, being dismissed under pledge of select Sureties, went home without imprisonment.\"69 Certain Crown-debts of Wal ter de Clifford recorded on the Shropshire Pipe-Roll of 1252 may possibly involve a balance of this amercement. He is said to owe \u00a377. 8s. on two debts, payment whereof was required in Bucking hamshire. Also he owed 20 merks for default and transgression, \u2014 a debt put in charge in Warwickshire. The Inquisition on the Manor of Corsham in 1255 must be un derstood to include under that term Culmington, Siefton, and Did dlebury, with their adjuncts. The Manor was estimated to contain 7\\ hides, whereas the same territory at Domesday was equal to 14 hides. Sir Walter de Clifford held the Manor of the King by ser vice of one Knight. He had a franchise here, by grant of the King's ancestors. He had gallows, assize of bread and beer, and held pleas of blood-shed, hue and cry, and other lesser pleas. Besides these he was entitled to the breve de recto, that is, I suppose, to a King's Writ, ordering any local suit to be tried in the Manorial Court.70 A fine of 2 merks of gold for a grant of Market, Fair, and Free- Warren, was proffered by Walter de Clifford in 1258, and entered on the Shropshire Pipe-Roll of 1259. I do not find however any corresponding Charter securing these privileges to his Shropshire estates, though a Charter of 1261 confers them in his Herefordshire Manor of Clifford.71 On May 19, 1263, a Patent to Walter de Clifford undertakes that the King will look to Matilda de Longespee, Walter's daughter, for payment of his debts due to the Crown. On December 16, 1263, Walter de Clifford was deceased, for then did Margaret his Widow (so describing herself) bequeath her heart 69 M.

Her Deed, which passed at Ross, in Herefordshire, was sealed with the seals of Sam son, Abbot of Kingswood, and Henry, Abbot of Dore ; \u2014 probably because the Lady had not as yet a seal of her own, proper to her recent state of widowhood.72 On December 23, 1263, the Sheriff of Shropshire is ordered to seize for the Crown the lands of Walter de Clifford, deceased. Having died in the King's debt, his Execu tors are not to administer his goods and chattels till further in structions.73 Margaret, the above-mentioned wife of Walter de Clifford (III), was a daughter of Lewellyii, Prince of Wales. She could not have been married to Clifford before 1231-2, in one of which years her first husband, John de Braose of Brcmber, was killed by a fall from his horse. Consequently her daughter Matilda cannot have been twelve years of age when in April 1244 the King proposed her mar riage with a son of William Longespee. By this means the said son, viz. William Longespee (III), being Great-Grandson of Rosa mond Clifford, became the husband of his Father's second Cousin, Matilda de Clifford. This match was productive of one only daugh ter, Margery, whom I reckon to have been under five years of age71 when her Father, in December 1256, negotiated for her marriage with Henry de Lacy, afterwards Earl of Lincoln, then a boy of about the same age as his proposed wife. Within two months of this negotiation, that is, about January 1257, William Longspee (III) died in the flower of his youth, and . Matilda his Widow be came seized of her dower in his estates. In 1263, and while still a Widow, she succeeded to the whole Barony of her Father Walter de Clifford. For the circumstances of her subsequent abduction by John Giffard of Brimsfield, I refer elsewhere.75 A Patent dated March 10th, 1271, legalized her marriage with the said John Giffard as far as the King was concerned. At the Inquisitions of November 1274 many were the complaints of the neighbourhood against John Giffard and his Officers at Corf ham.

Nor was the tyranny of these men exercised on strangers only. The Jurors of Corsham itself had various exactions to report within the Liberty. The most flagrant, and perhaps the truest of their allegations, concerned an offence against the Crown, rather than against themselves individually. Sir John Giffard, they said, through Iris Constable (here called De Aqua) had often arrested Felons, and had subsequently released them with out trial. These Corsham Jurors further knew well the history of their Manor, how it was ancient demesne of the Crown, how Henry II had given it to Walter de Clifford \" for love of Rosamond his daughter,\" how too Priors-Ditton had anciently been appurtenant to Corsham.76 In Trinity Term 1276 I find John Giffard and Matilda his wife implcading many persons for hunting in their Forest of Corsham.77 In 1283 Matilda, wife of John Giffard, was deceased, but he con tinued to hold her estates as Tenant by Courtesy of England. Hence the Feodary of 1284 says that \" John Giffard holds the Manor of Corsham by right of Matilda de Longespeye, formerly daughter and heir of Walter de Clifford, for one Knight's-fee.\" In October 1292 John Giffard was questioned, under Writ of Quo Waranto, for holding Pleas of the Crown within his Manor of Corsham. He answered that he claimed to hold two great Courts (annually) for the said Manor, and in such Courts to inquire into all matters of the peace usual to such Courts, and to hold the same Pleas as were held in the Sheriff's Tourn, and to have infangethef and ivayf. But, whereas John Giffard was only Tenant for life, and the Manor was the inheritance of the four daughters of his deceased wife, the youngest of whom was produced in Court and shown to be under age, the cause was adjourned.78 John Giffard died May 28, 1299. The heirs of his first wife, Matilda de Clifford, were found to be Margery, Countess of Lin coln, her daughter by William Longespee, and Catherine, Eleanor, and Maud, her daughters by John Giffard. Of these, Catherine, already wife of Nicholas de Audley, was twenty-seven years of age, Eleanor was twenty-four, and Maud twenty-two.

A separate In quest shows that John Giffard had purchased a Tenement at Peton (value 5s. 10c?. per annum), which was to be held of the Lords of Corsham by payment of a Chaplet of Roses at Corsham Castle on the day of St. John Baptist's Nativity. The heir to this Tenement was his son, John Giffard, by a third wife, which son was twelve years of age.79 On the division of the Clifford estates between the above-named Coheiresses, Corsham fell to the share of Eleanor Giffard, who, before the close of Edward I's reign, became the wife of Fulk le Strange of Blackmere. Hence the Return of March 1316 gives the said Fulk as Lord of Corsham.80 Of him and his Line I shall have to speak elsewhere. Having now traced the Old Barony of Clifford to an Abeyance, out of which, notwithstanding some opi nions to the contrary,81 I conceive that it has never been taken, I here quit this branch of my subject. Having thus far been speaking of Corsham in respect of its Lords Paramount, I must say a word as to its \u2014 Manorial Jurisdiction, and in so doing, I necessarily include Culmington and Siefton, which, though distinct Manors at the time of Domesday, came afterwards to be mere members of that Liberty of which Corf ham was the Caput. The Assize-Roll of October 1203 allots a distinct space to the Villata de Corfham, a space which, though not filled up with any report of local concerns, shows that the Franchise was recognized as extra-hundredal, and separately responsible. In 1250 I find the Manor of Corfham amerced three rnerks de fine ante judicium ;82 through the marriage of his Son, Roger (III),with the Coheiress of DeVipont. Per haps the fittest designation for this branch of the Cliffords till the death of Roger (II) would be \" Clifford of Tenbury,\" for they held that Manor under tho elder House. 79 Inquisitions, 27 Edw.

It was similarly represented by its twelve Jurors at the Assizes of 1256 ; but at those of 1272 a Bailiff and eight Jurors appeared for Corfham, and a note on the Roll marks the deficiency. At the Inquisition of 1274 twelve Jurors reported on this Liberty ; but at the Assizes of 1292 the presentments of a Bailiff and only six Jurors seem to have been deficient in no point of form. I now turn to a complicated subject, viz. the several Feoffments, or rather Tenancies, which occur in Corfham. The first of these seems to have been a transfer, actual or alleged, of the whole Manor. I will call it the \u2014 Tenure of Braose. It will appear that Margery or Margaret, wife of the third Walter de Clifford, was widow of John de Braose. This John had died in 1231-2, leaving two sons in infancy. The name of the second of these sons does not appear, and therefore I am by no means positive that it was that John de Braose whom I have now to introduce. This John had in 1257 acquired, by feoff ment or otherwise, a very considerable interest in Culmington and Siefton, of which I shall take due notice elsewhere. It would ap pear that he had also some claim upon Corfham ; for on AprU 15, 1259, Nicholas de Handlou was appointed to investigate a charge of disseizin preferred by John de Breus against Walter de Clifford. The tenure sought to be recovered was in Corfham ; and we know from a later Record that the hearing by Nicholas de Handlou ter minated in favour of the Plaintiff. Clifford however, conceiving himself to be injured, seems to have appealed to a higher Court. His appeal stood for hearing before the King himself in Michaelmas Term 1260. Then John de Brehus failing to appear, his Mam captors were declared to be in misericordid, and the cause was ad-. journed.8* The further pleadings are lost, but the result appears in a Patent of May 6, 1262, which directs James d'Audley to 83 Two Litigants compounding any Suit in the King's Court without license so to do, and before sentence given, were hable to amercement. The reason was because the Crown thus lost the amerce ment chargeable on the defeated party. The same Rule held good in the case of a Manorial Court, only that the amercement went ordinarily to the Lord of the Fran chise. In 1250 the Lord of Corfham was, as we have seen (p. 160), under for feiture of his Franchises. Hence the King profited by the illegal transaction of the Manorial Court. S4 Placita coram Rege, Mich.

I must now enumerate those members of the Manor of Corfham which I suppose to have formed its four Domesday Berewicks. These were perhaps Bromcroft, Peaton, Diddlebury, and Sparchford ; and in giving some account of each I shall necessarily be intro ducing the name of many Feoffees in the collective Manor of Corfham. Bromcroft was, I think, held under the Lords of Corfham by the family of Tyrel ; but whatever was the Tenure of these Tyrels in Corfham Manor, I cannot discover that any knight's-service or other acknowledgment was reserved thereon. There was a Richard Tyrel who in 1234-5 and in 1242-3 held a knight's-fee in Skipton Chamfleur, Gloucestershire, under Roger de Chandos.87 The same person, I think, appears as one of the Manucaptors of Walter de Clifford in a Suit of Easter Term 1243, and was amerced one merk for the non-appearance of his Principal. In January 1246 this Richard Tyrel was second on a great Inquest taken by Knights from all parts of Shropshire. At the Assizes of November 1248, and afterwards, he was one of the Coroners of Shropshire, but though living, was no longer in office in January 1256. In 1250 Richard Tyrel fined five merks \"that Wyloc might be under plevin.\" This Wyloc was, I think, a Corfham Tenant.

Richard Tyrel's successor in Shropshire was Roger Tyrel, who, himself or one of his name, had held lands in Herefordshire, under De Lacy, as early as 1242. In March 1265 Roger Tyrel occurs on a Great Herefordshire Inquest concerning the estates of Acornbury Nunnery.90 In or about 1267 he attests a Pembridge Deed.91 In November 1268 he was appointed a Justice for gaol-delivery at Brug. Soon afterwards he attests Ma tilda Longespee's Charter to Shrewsbury Abbey, as will hereafter appear. We have had various notices of him about the same period in former Volumes.92 His later occurrences in Shropshire are in December 1274, when he was Foreman of a Jury at Burford, and in 1292, when he was reported by the Corfham Jurors as non attendant at the Assizes.

Walter fitz William, of Peton, was one of those who had suffered from the oppressions of John Giffard's Officers.97 In Trinity Term 1299 Hugh son of Hugh de Cheyny with Cecilia his wife, Plaintiffs, acknowledge by Fine their gift of two messuages and a virgate in Peton to Roger de Cheyny and Margery his wife, Deforciants. The latter reconvey the pre mises to the Plaintiffs for life, at a rent of one rose annually, and to revert to themselves. I shall have more to say of the family con cerned in this Fine elsewhere. Walter fitz William de Peton was a Corfham Juror at the Assizes of 1292. Among the Tenants men tioned in the Inquest of July 1299, these were perhaps of Peaton, viz. Walter fitz William paying a chief-rent of 10s. 8d. to the Lord of Corfham, and William fitz Adam paying 5s. Sd. Diddlebury. \u2014 In speaking of Diddlebury as an appurtenance of the Manor of Corfham, and perhaps one of its Domesday Berewicks, I must be understood to treat of the Lay -Fee of Diddlebury only. A great part of the district was Church-land, and so never came to the Seigneury of Clifford. This Spiritual-Fee will require a sepa rate notice. The principal Tenant of the Lay -Fee in Diddlebury was perhaps that Achilles who attests Hugh de Periers' grant of Ditton to Wen lock Priory, about the year 1175.98 Achilles and his descendants continued to hold under the Cliffords in Diddlebury, but whereas they also held Beche under the same Lords, I shall reserve what I have to say of their descent till I come to that Township. The names of other Tenants in the Lay-fee of Diddlebury may be gathered from the following notes.\u2014 In 1243 Roger fitz Roger, of Duddelby, was a Manucaptor for Walter de Clifford. In 1245 William, son of William de Dudelibir', fines one merk that he may have an assize. It was perhaps con nected with the following. \u2014 In 1249, at Exeter, Walter de Clifford duly presented himself before Roger de Thurkelby (a Justiciar who had visited Shropshire in 1248).

At the Inquest of 1255, Wyot de Dudelebir', Tho mas de Musselawe, and Richard de Panteleg, were on the Corfham Jury. At the Assizes of 1256 the same three persons officiated in a like Capacity. John Blethwath, another Juror, was perhaps iden tical with John Bledenoch, who, with Robert de Furches and Wil liam L'Enfaunt, lost certain tenements in Diddlebury at these As sizes, because the said tenements were frank-almoign, and belonged to the ecclesiastical fee. Again at these Assizes Matilda, Widow of William le Bedel, sued Walter de Clifford, Robert le Devenois, Adam Pocock, and others, for disseizing her of 4 acres and a mes suage in Dudelebir. The Court directed her to sue Ernald de Ber kele, the Tenant then in seizin.1 In 1257 we find Richard Balie taking out a Writ of mort d'ancestre against Richard de Pauntele and others, concerning a messuage and tenements in Corfton and Diddlebury.3 Soon after this, we have William L'Enfant, of Did dlebury, and Richard de Pantheloe (as he is called), attesting a Deed already given under Corfton. At the Assizes of 1267 Richard fitz Roger recovered four acres in Dudelebyr, of which Richard Koc, his Uncle {avunculus), had died seized. The Tenants now ousted were entitled to have an equivalent out of the lands of Thomas Clerk of Munslow, their Warrantor? At these same Assizes, Johanna de Clifford, as Sister and heir of Dionisia de Clifford, sued William fitz Alexander of Hulton, for two-thirds of half a virgate in Dodelibir'. The Tenant called William de CUfford to warranty, and the cause was adjourned.3 In June 1271 Elyas fitz Alexander, of Dudelibi, has a writ of novel disseizin against Richard de Paun teleye for a tenement in Dudelibi.3 At the Assizes of 1272 Wil liam le Enfant was Bailiff of Corfham, whilst Richard de Paunteley, William fitz Wyot, Thomas de Munslow, and William de Clifford, were Corfham Jurors.

For this, John Purcel conceded to the Deforciants and the heirs of Cecilia a messuage and vii'gate in Norbury, at a rent of one clove, and all capital services. John Purcel also paid 31 merks to the Deforciants. Another Fine (levied June 25, 1283) was between Richard de Duddelebury, Clerk, and Emma his wife, Plaintiffs, and John Purcel and Wymarca his wife, Deforciants, of a messuage and 60 acres iu Duddelebury, whereof was Plea of Convention. The Deforciants conceded the premises ; \u2014 to hold to the Plaintiffs at a rent of one Rose, payable to the Deforciants and the heirs of Wymarca, and by performance of all capital services. For this the Plaintiffs gave 67 merks. A Ludlow Inquest of January 1284 was attended by William le En fant and Richard de Paunthele.

Earl Roger's own Charter re cords the gift. \" I gave,\" says the Earl, \" the Church of Dudele bury, with all things which pertain thereto.\"5 The Confirmation too of King William I, or his son Rufus, records the grant as that of the Earl and Countess, adding that Spertford (Sparchford) and half a hide in Corston (Corfton) wrere the appurtenant possessions of Diddlebury Church.5 The evidence of Domesday is marvellously consistent with that of the monastic Charters ; for though at first sight Diddlebury Church would not seem to be mentioned in that Record, a little consideration shows us that by the \" Church of the Manor of Corfham\" is meant the Church of Diddlebury. This then, with its hide of land yielding to the Monks 18s. yearly, was in 1085 a possession of the Church of St. Peter, that is, of Shrews bury Abbey.6 It is singular that in the very next year Earl Roger should have granted a third of his tithes at Corfham to the Colle\" giate Church of Quatford.7 The fact that he did so is nevertheless substantiated by a piece of later evidence which I shall offer in its proper place. Earl Roger's grant of Diddlebury Church to Shrewsbury Abbey had the confirmations of Henry I and Stephen, also those of Henry II and Henry III. The two latter were however (in this instance) mere formal repetitions ; for the Abbey had lost the Church before Henry II came to the throne. I have alluded on former occasions, and particularly under Billingsley, to the claims which the Norman Abbey of Seez made, and in some measure maintained, on certain possessions of Shrewsbury Abbey.8 The Sagian Monks were al ready, it would seem, in seizin of the Church of Dudenebury, when about the year 1147, Bishop Robert de Betun's Charter informs us of the settlement of all disputes between the two Abbeys. Among the various transfers and concessions then agreed upon, Ranulf Abbot of Shrewsbury, gave up to John Abbot of Seez, the Church of Dudenebury.9 We have only fragmentary evidence as to the mode in which the Abbey of Seez dealt with this Advowson. An unvouched note (of 5 Monasticon, III, 520, 521. 6 Supra, p. 145. nald) Prior of Wenlock, Edmund, Prior of Leomuister, William, Archdeacon of London, and Godfrey, Archdeacon of Worcester, were present in the Chapter of Hereford when Bishop Betun expedi ted this Charter. 7 Supra, Vol. I, p. 109. 8 Supra, Vol. I, pp. 34, 35, 65. 9 Salop Chartulary, No. 337.\u2014 Gilbert, Abbot of Gloucester, Reginald (i. e.

Mr. Blakeway's) implies that one \" Osbern, Parson of Diddlebury, was instituted by Robert, Bishop of Hereford, between 1164 and 1186 on the presentation of the Monks of Olverton;\" moreover that the said Osbern was still \" living in 1237.\" The Bishop here al luded to must be either Robert de Melun, who sat from Dec. 22, 1163, till Feb. 27, 1167, or Robert Foliot, consecrated Oct. 6, 1174, and who died May 9, 1186. Now I shall have that hereafter to say about Osbern Parson of Diddlebury, which will show that his in stitution should rather be ascribed to Bishop Robert de Betun, and should therefore date before April 22, 1148, the day of that Pre late's death. We have here to inquire how it was that, within a year of the time when we have supposed this Bishop to have as signed the Advowson of Diddlebury to Seez, the Monks of Olverton are found acting as Patrons ? By Olverton must be meant Alcester, sometimes called Oversley, a Benedictine Abbey in Warwickshire, founded in 1140, and very possibly associated by some early tie with the Foreign House of Seez. We are positively assured that sometime or other the Monks of Alcester were so seized of the Ad vowson of Diddlebury as that they were enabled to transfer it to the Chapter of Hereford,10 and yet that the latter body, when late in the thirteenth century its title was brought into question, applied immediately to the Abbey of Seez for documentary proof thereof.11 My own impression is, that whatever was done by the Monks of Alcester in regard to Diddlebury Church, they did as Proctors or Trustees of the Abbey of Seez. I shall now adduce a piece of evi dence which shows that in 1212 the then Rector of Diddlebury was bound to pay an annual acknowledgment of 45s. to the Abbot of Seez through the Bailiff of the latter. This I think proves that the Abbot was still Patron of the Church, and that before he had presented this Rector thereto, he had required security for the future payment of the said pension. The Rector in question is styled \"Osbern, Parson of the Church of Doudelebere,\" and was evi dently the second Incumbent of that name. Being \u00a32. 18s. 4d. in arrear of his acknowledgment of 45s. per annum, he covenants on March 13, 1212, with N., Bailiff of the Abbot of Seez, to pay the said annuity in future, and gradually to liquidate the arrears. He attorns Alexander-his Chaplain to pay the annuity to the Bailiff or Messengers of the Abbot. Alexander undertakes the charge; and Osbern covenants that he will not force Alexander to pay to himself the rent thus transferred to the Abbey : \u2014 that is, Osbern will fairly io \u25a0 \u00ab History of Shrewsbury, II, 12, I, 142."], [204, "172 CORFHAM. allow this payment in his own reckoning with his Chaplain. Os beru's Sureties in this matter, besides his corporal oath, were Alex ander the Dean, Osbem fitz William, Aschilles a Knight, and Os bern fitz Deacon. The three first, with William Foliot, a Monk, Adam Parson of Hactun, John Dougee, and William fitz Herluin, attest the Composition, which was executed in duplicate, sealed with the Seals of Osbern and of the Abbot's Bailiff, and most curiously dated with reference to the Great Interdict under which the Realm of England then lay.12 Pursuing now the subject of the Abbot of Seez' continued Pa tronage of this Church, we find an Ordinance of Ralph de May denestun, Bishop of Hereford, dated in June 1236, which expressly declares that right of Patronage, without any mention of the Monks of Alcester. The Abbot and Convent of Seez had, it appears, felt a great danger (spiritual danger, I presume) in regard to their right of Patronage, \" inasmuch as living in foreign parts they could not, as was right and decent, provide a fitting Pastor for this Church.\" They had therefore besought the Bishop to devise some remedial plan for this their danger, and had committed the cure and ordi nation of the said Church to the Bishop for ever, undertaking to ratify the Bishop's ordinance, whether it should convert the Church to his own uses, or to the uses of the Sagian Monks, or to the uses of any other , and also approving, if, on the next vacancy, the Bishop should confer the Church on one single Parson.\" The Bishop accordingly proceeds with his pious task, which, with all due deference to medi\u00e6val sanctity, we shall see that he converted into a scandalous job. He first considers the poverty of the Church of Seez, and for the sustenance of the poor men who there serve God (he means the Monks) he allots an annuity of 10 merks {\u00a36. 13s. 4c?.), to be paid out of the fruits of the Church of Dudele bury in the name of a benefice for ever. Meantime however, \u2014 that is, till the Church should be vacant, \u2014 O. (Osbern, I presume), the Rector, and W. (William), the Vicar of Diddlebury, were for their lives to receive their accustomed portions, and the Abbot of Seez was to be content with his ancient pension (that is, 45s. I suppose) . Further, the Church itself was to remain for ever subject to the Ordination of the Bishop of Hereford, for the time being, saving the above pension of 10 merks to Seez.13 In the same month Stephen, the Dean, and the Chapter of He reford inspected, recited, and confirmed the Ordinance of their Madox, Formtdare, No. ch. ,3 Madox, Formulare, No. xii."], [205, "173 DIDDLEBURY CHURCH. Diocesan.13 Thus the Advowson of Diddlebury was lost to the Abbey of Seez ; but for some cause or other, in the year 1257, that House directed one Ralph, a Sagian Monk and its Proctor in England, to get a copy of the Charter of Bishop Maydenestun, or to borrow the original. It was judged hazardous at that period to send original documents about the Country, and so copies of the Bishop's Ordinance and of the Dean and Chapter's Inspeximus were taken ; and both were submitted to the inspection of John (II), Bishop of Chichester, who verified them, and attested their accuracy under his own seal.13 I now return to the year 1255, when Osbern, Rector of Diddlebury, was apparently dead, and William cle Ros was Parson. He had seemingly been so for seven years, and I think it probable that he was identical with \" W.,\" the Vicar named by Bishop Maydenestun in 1237. I have alluded elsewhere to certain tithes in Corfham, of which, with 16d. of other income, William de Ros deprived the Collegiate Church of St. Mary Magdalene of Brug, appropriating them to his own Church of Diddlebury.14 These tithes, I doubt not, represented Earl Roger's original grant of the third of the Tithes of Corfham to Quatford College. The Jurors of Corfham in 1255 were interrogated as to any rights or liberties within their Franchise which, being ordinarily appurtenant to the Crown, had been withdrawn. They answered more fully than the Jurors of Brug above-quoted, viz. that the tithe withdrawn was a third of the tithes of Walter de Clifford's demesne at Corf ham ; that Master William de Ros had withdrawn it seven years before, and apparently under the authority of the Bishop of Here ford.15 We happen to know that William de Ros died in 1276-7, and it was then probably that Bishop Maydenestun's Ordinance came into full operation. Diddlebury Church had already been given, or was now given, by the Bishop of Hereford to his own Chapter. But in 1283 the Abbey of Shrewsbury had revived its ancient claim to this Advowson, and took occasion of the Court of Common Pleas sitting at Shrewsbury to sue the Chapter of Here ford for the same. The Chapter, in a letter of March 14, 1283, requested the Abbot of Seez to search his muniments on the sub ject. \" On two days,\" says the letter, \" had this Plea been before the Court, and the third day fixed for its hearing, viz. May 2nd, was approaching.\"16 Any further proceedings in the Civil Court I cannot trace ; but Shrewsbury Abbey in this same year came to 13 Madox, Formulare, No. xii. 14 Supra, Vol. I, p. 77. 15 Roi.

The Abbey was allowed to appropriate its own Church of Stottesden. In return, it gave up its claim on Diddlebury, as well as its rights in the Advowsons of Tugford and Holgate, or rather, in two out of the three Prebends of Holgate. Swinfield forthwith gave Diddlebury to his own Chapter, and kept. Tugford and the two Holgate Pre bends for himself. This was done by Swinfield under the specious pretext of facilitating the hospitality and other good works of Shrewsbury Abbey.17 A more consummate job, covered by more thorough cant, it is impossible to conceive. In the twelfth century we have seen how Bishops and Monks conspired against the pa rochial rights of the rural districts; in the thirteenth, the con spiracy still continued, the Bishop proving himself the cleverer rogue of the two, by plundering not only the public, but his own former accomplice. Pleasant it is however to find a good springing out of intolerable evil. To this day do the Dignitaries of the Church of Hereford enjoy the greater part of the Rectorial tithes of Diddlebury, whilst the Bishop presents to the Rectories of Hol gate and Tugford ; \u2014 Tithes and Rectories which, had they been left in 1287 with Shrewsbury Abbey, would now be in the hands of Lay Impropriator s. Bishop Swinfield's Award was, in the case of Diddlebury, con firmed by a Fine levied in the Curia Regis at Westminster in Oc tober 1283. Thereby John, Abbot of Salop, Plaintiff, surrenders and quit-claims for ever to John the Dean and the Chapter of the Church of St. Ethelbert of Hereford, Deforciants, the Advowson of Dudelebir, whereof was Suit at Law between the parties. For this quit-claim the Deforciants are said to pay a Sore Sparrow hawk. It is remarkable that in Bishop Swinfield's Visitation of 1290 the Churches of Diddlebury, Holgate, Tugford and Stottesden were all omitted. The Taxation of 1291 values the Church of Duddele bury in the Deanery of Ludlow at the high rate of j\u00a338. 13s. 4</., besides which a portion of \u00a31. 6s. 8d. in the Church of Alberbury belonged to the Rectory of Duddelebury. The Vicarage of Duddele bury was moreover worth \u00a37. 6s. 8d. per annum.19 The Rectory of Diddlebury must from this period be taken as appropriated by the Dean and Chapter of Hereford.

On June 15, 1322, the Deanery of Hereford being va cant, the Chapter grant to their Fellow-Canon, Master Richard le Vernoun, P.C.L.,20 for his life, their Churches of Dodelebur' and Longestaunton ; he paying yearly \u00a360. sterling to the Collegiate body. In 1341 the Assessors of the Ninth accurately quoted the Church- Taxation of Dodlebury as 69 merks (\u00a346.). They assessed the Parish only at \u00a39. This reduction was allowed because six carucates of land lay unfilled on account of diverse taxes which oppressed the Tenants here, because also the Glebe land, worth \u00a33., the hay-tithes, worth \u00a36., the tithes of Mills, worth \u00a35., the Vicarage and other small-tithes, offerings, and profits, worth \u00a320. per annum, went to swell the Church-Taxation, but were not to be reckoned in esti mating the Ninth.-1 In 1534-5 the Rectories of Diddlebury and Long Stanton were returned, as I have before stated, as jointly worth \u00a340. per annum.22 The Vicarage of Dedulbury, then held by Thomas Slade, was worth in tithes of all kinds \u00a313. 6s. 8d. per annum, which income was chargeable with 7s.

Aluric, Clerk of Dudelibi, and Osbern his Priest, who about the year 1115 w-ere present at the Synod of Castle-Holgate,24 must I think be taken to have represented the Rector and Vicar of a later period. I will not suppose that Osbern, the Subordinate of 1115, became afterwards the Rector, but at all events one \u2014 Osbert de Duddelebir, Clerk, occurs between the years 1155 and 1159 under circumstances which show him to have been a per son of great ecclesiastical importance. The facts are these.25 \u2014 In that interval died William, Archdeacon of London, a person well known in Staffordshire history, and who had held, among other things, the Church of Bradeley by presentation of Robert, second 19 Supra, Vol. IV, p. 40. 23 Valor Ecclesiasticus, III, 202. 10 He had the Prebend of Inkbarrow, in Hereford Cathedral. 24 Supra, Vol. Ill, p. 233. 25 These particulars are taken from the Stone Chartularies (Cotton MSS., Vespas* E. xxiv, and Cotton Charters, xiii, 6). 21 Inquis.

On the Archdeacon's death, the Canons of the Church of Gnowsall claimed the Advowson of Bradeley; also Osbert de Diddlebury claimed the vacant Incumbency, but whether as a Dignitary ofthe Church of Gnowsall, as Presentee of that Collegiate body, or in some other right, is not clear. Robert de Stafford on the other hand presented Master Richard de Salop to Bradeley Church. A contest arose, which ended in Bishop Walter Durdeut admitting Stafford's Nominee. It also appears that Osbert de Duddelebir had been brought to renounce his claim before Helias, Archdeacon of Stafford, and Robert de Stafford, for which renuncia tion Master Richard de Salop gave Osbert seven solidates of land in Shradicot. The last transaction was certified in a letter, written long afterwards by Robert de Stafford, to R. the Bishop, and G. the Dean, of Hereford, by whom I understand, \u2014 Robert Foliot (con secrated 6 Oct., 1174, died 9 May, 1186), and Geoffrey known to have been Dean of Hereford in and about 1173. About this time the Advowson of Bradeley seems again to have been subject of dis pute, but Richard Peehe, Bishop of Lichfield, ignored the claim of the Church of Gnowsall, sanctioned that of Robert de Stafford, and confirmed Bradeley Church, at ihe presentation ofthe said Robert, to Stone Priory. Now it does not appear from the Stone Chartularies why Robert de Stafford should memorialize the Bishop and Dean of Hereford about matters which belonged to another Diocese. The Bishop and Dean were, as I suggest, Judges Delegate in this ecclesiastical con test ; \u2014 but what is more to our present purpose is that Robert de Stafford's letter speaks of Osbert de Dudelebir as if still living and renewing his claim to Bradeley Church.56 On the whole I conclude that Osbern, Rector of Diddlebury, was presented to Diddlebury in 1147-8, as before shown,27 claimed the Church of Bradeley between 1155 and 1159, and again in or after the year 1174. How much longer he lived I cannot say, because he had a cotemporary, apparently a Layman, who though usually called Osbert de Sturchley was also called Osbert de Diddlebury, and to distinguish between the Clerk and Layman is not always pos sible.

Osbert, Parson of Diddlebury, who was living in the time of Richardi (1189-1199). Him we have seen attesting a Bitterley Char ter about 1210, 28 and in March 1212 he undertook as Rector to pay the Abbot of Seez' Pension in this Church through the hands of \u2014 Alexander, his Chaplain, whom I take to have been the cotem porary Vicar. By an extraordinary coincidence, this second Osbert, Rector of Diddlebury, had a second lay Cotemporary, sometimes called Osbert de Diddlebury, sometimes Osbert de Stirchley, and sometimes Osbert fitz William ; as for instance in attesting the Bit terley deed just now quoted, aud as in March 1212, when he was one of the Sureties of Osbert the Parson. To increase this con fusion, we find that Osbert the Parson had also an interest in Stirchley. That some near relationship existed between the two is evident, but what it was I dare not conjecture. The next notice which distinctly belongs to Osbert the Parson of Diddlebury, is in a Suit of 1226, where he is fully designated as I shall show here after. In 1230 too, Osbert Parson of Dudlesbir', had been amerced 20s. for disseizin by Stephen de Segrave. In July 1232 Osbert, Parson of Diddlebury, levied a Fine of lands in Stirchley, which I shall set forth elsewhere. In June 1236 he was doubtless that Rector whom Bishop Maydenestun's Ordinance describes only by the initial letter of his name, and in the same document we have \" \\V.,\" representing the cotemporary Vicar, probably some William, who may also have been identical with William de Ros, a subse quent Rector. Having nothing more which I can positively state about Parson Osbert (II), I proceed to the said \u2014 William de Ros, afready shown to have been Rector of Diddle bury iu 1248 and 1255. He has also occurred to us under Corfton in 1256 as William, Parson of Diddlebury.29 He occurs as Trea surer of Hereford in 1272 and 1275, and died in 1276 or 1277. He was the last Rector of Diddlebury, and the date of his death corresponds well with the institution of the first Vicar nominated by the Dean and Chapter of Hereford. This was \u2014 Walter de Lodelowe, Deacon, instituted 1 April, 1278, by Bishop Cantilupe. On Dec. 23, 1312\u2014 John Dole, Deacon, was instituted Vicar on a like presentation. He is probably the same with \u2014 Sir John le Bole, who occurs as Vicar in 1314. Richard, Vicar of Diddlebury, occurs in 4 Rich.

Sir John Sutton was instituted to this Vicarage Aug. 12, 1396. ECCLESIASTICAL FEE OF DIDDLEBURY, INCLUDING- SPARCHFORD AND PART OF CORFTON. The principal Feoffees of the Rectors of Diddlebury were I think that Oshert and that Osbert fitz William whom I have already men tioned as cotemporarics of the first and second Rectors of the same Christian name. Osbert de Stirchley, as he is called, occurs in 1167, 1176, and 1180, in connection with Sturchley ; but in 1193, being amerced half a merk for some false claim, he is called Oshert de Dudelebi. Sometime between 1193 and 1207 this Osbert was succeeded in estate both at Stirchley and Diddlebury by Oshert fitz William. On October 6, 1207, Osbert fitz William appears as Attorney of Walter de Clifford (II) in a Fine concerning lands in Buckinghamshire.31 On November 5, 1208, a Fine was levied be tween Osbert fitz William, Plaintiff, and Walter de Stircheleie, Tenant, of one hide in Stircheleie and one virgate in Dodelibir, for which lands Walter was suing Osbert under writ of mort d'ancestre. He now relinquished his demand. In return Osbert conceded to Walter the said virgate, as well as the messuage in Dodelebir held by Alexander the Priest, also half a virgate in Sparcford held by one Wiard ; \u2014 to hold to Walter and his heirs under Osbert and his heirs at a rent of 16s. per annum.31 As to the hide in Stircheleie, Walter was also to hold that, but for life only, and on terms which I will state elsewhere. At Assizes of the Forest held in 1212, one Walter de Budebir (probably Dudelibir), was assessed one merk for a new purpresture. Him I take to be the same with Walter de 311 This is not the only notice which I have met with of this Chapel.

In 1227 some misunderstanding arose about the said Fine, and a Placitum finis facti, as it was termed, resulted in a second composition, annihilating the first. This Fine was levied at Reading on Dec. 14, 1227, between Osbert fitz William, Plaintiff, and Walter de Stirchleg, Deforciant, of a hide in Stircheleg, and a virgate in Dudelebir. Walter again acknow ledged the right of Osbert, who conceded him the Diddlebury vir gate, in fee as before, and at a rent of 16s. The change made was in regard of part of the hide in Stirchleg, which part was now granted to Walter in fee, perhaps in lieu of the former concession in Sparchford. It is very singular and very perplexing to find that on the death of Walter de Stirchley in 1232, Osbert, Parson of Diddlebury, and not Osbert fitz William, settled with Walter's widow her claim of dower in a hide at Stirchley. There is indeed a piece of evidence suggesting the idea that Osbert fitz William was dead in 1231, but the same evidence would show that his son Wil liam fitz Osbert was his heir, not Osbert the Parson. This evidence is as follows. \u2014 On July 1, 1231, Avelina, Widow of Richard de Did delbir, sued William fitz Osbert for a third part of 30 acres in Diddelbir as her dower. William pleaded that Avelina was not married to Richard \"because she was his Aunt\" {amita sua) \u2014 an expression which is ambiguous, and does not determine whether Avelina is said to be Aunt of Richard, or of William, or of both, if they were brothers. William further seems to have pleaded that Richard, after his alleged marriage with Avelina, took another wo man to wife, and had her for sixteen years, and died so having her ; moreover that Richard never had any land, for he died in his Fa ther's life-time, and married no wife with his Father's consent. Avelina was non-suited.32 Reserving all attempt to explain this matter till I come to Stirchley, I proceed to say that in 1233 and 1234 I find mention of Osbert de Stirchley, and in 1238 of Osbert de Dodelebyr, in connection with Stirchley. I cannot doubt that Osbert fitz William, and not Osbert the Parson, was in each case meant. I think too that this Osbert fitz William may have been second of his name, Grandson that is of Osbert fitz William, living in 1227, and Son of William fitz Osbert, living in 1231. I should say further of him here that about 1243, and as \"Osbert de Stirch ley,\" he gave half his Manor of Stirchley to Buildwas Abbey ; \u2014 that by Fine, dated July 1, 1247, he confirmed this half and ap parently gave the other half to the same House, that in the said 32 Placita, Trin.

Fine he is called \" Osbert de Styrcheleg ;\" but in Charters nearly equivalent to and cotemporary with the said Fine, he calls himself Osbert fitz William, Lord of Stirchley, and speaks of Richard his Uncle {avunculus) as a former Grantor to Buildwas. He died pro bably soon after, and was buried at Buildwas, if the intention ex pressed by one of his Charters was duly carried out. He seems to have been succeeded by a second William fitz Osbert ; for at the Assizes of 1256 such a person stood warranty for Wylecok, son of Robert le Prestre, a tenant of a messuage in Dudelebyr, who was impleaded for the same by Roger Skynnar, as brother and heir of Robert le Chapeleyn, which Robert was alleged to have died seized thereof. William fitz Osbert was dismissed sine die?3 This is the latest notice which I have of the family of which I treat. I now revert to instances where I suppose other Undertenants of the Church of Diddlebury to be mentioned. In August 1226 Su sanna de Corfton came before the King sitting in his Court at Salop, and withdrew a suit of novel disseizin which she had preferred against Osbern Parson of Dudesbir', for a tenement in Spertford (Sparchford). Philip and Yvo de Wyluredeston and William the Dean are mentioned as Sureties in this case.34 In 1230 when Os bert, Parson of Diddlebury, was amerced 20s. for disseizin, William fitz Alexander (I think his tenant) was amerced 2 merks for the same. The latter occurs as William fitz Alexander de Dudelbir in 1240, when he was amerced 20 merks for trespass. In 1255 the Corfham Jurors said that \" Master William de Ros, Parson of the Church of Dudelebur had liberty with respect to his men in the Fee of the said Church,\" that is, he and his Tenants were exempt from the ordinary jurisdiction of Corfham Liberty. He, William de Ros, had assize of beer, of blood-shed, and held other lesser Pleas in his Court.30 At the Assizes of 1256 a Jury was impanelled to try whether a messuage, 26 acres of arable land, and 7 acres of meadow, in Duddebir, were free almoign pertaining to the Church of Dud debir, whereof William de Ros was Parson, or were the lay-fee of Robert de Furchis, William l'Enfaunt, and John Bledenoch. Wil liam de Ros pleaded that Osbert his predecessor, being seized in demesne of the premises in the time of Richard I, had alienated them. William le Enfaunt's warrantor was Robert de Furchis, while the latter and John Bledenoch further called their Feoffor, viz. 33 Assizes, 40 Hen. Ill, m. 10. 34 Assize coram Rege, 10 Hen. Ill, m.

On a subse quent day of the Assizes this Ranulf appeared in warranty, and pleaded that the premises were not almoign, for that neither the said Osbert, nor any other predecessor of William de Ros, was seized of them as. almoign, or had held them in demesne, or had any other interest in them save a certain rent. The Jury however found that the premises -were frank almoign and not the lay -fee of Ranulf de Harpcote. The said Ranulf accordiugly lost them, and had to pro vide an equivalent elsewhere for each of his dispossessed feoffees.37 By this we learn that the Rectors of Diddlebury were unable legally to give feoffment of any part of the Church's lands. Such feoff ments however had been given, and it is probable that some were of so ancient a date as to defy the challenge of the last-named Rector. Of other interests of the family of De Furchis in Diddle bury I have spoken incidentally under Corfton. The land which the Church of Diddlebury had in the latter manor will account for the association between the two places. I may conclude the subject before us by mentioning a transfer of land in Diddlebury and Sparchford, which was most likely of the ecclesiastical fee, and was conveyed by Sibil Edrych to Roger Mor timer of Wigmore, probably between 1266 and 1282.38 Also Wil liam fitz Aldith and William Finch, both Tenants in Sparchford, are named in 1274 as having suffered by the extortions of John dc Aqua, constable of Corfham.39 Culmtncjton* This was at Domesday, like Corfham, a Manor of Earl Roger's demesne. \"The same Earl holds Comintone, Edric held it (in Saxon times).

In King Edward's time the Manor was worth \u00a34. annually ; now it is worth \u00a36.'n The Edric here spoken of was probably Edric Savage, many of whose Manors were retained by the Norman Earl. The three Berewicks of Culmington were undoubtedly Bache, Norton, and Burley, of each of which I shall speak separately in the sequel. The history of Culmington itself, as Caput of a Manor, may almost be said to end with Domesday. Like Corfham it escheated to Henry I, and was held as Royal demesne till Henry II gave it first to Hugh de Periers and then to Walter de Clifford. Thus associated with Corfham, it became a dependency thereof, and consequently the general history of its seignoral Lords has already been given. I now speak of minor matters immediately relating to Culmington. \u2014 In 1175, when Hugh de Periers granted Ditton to Wenlock Priory, he reserved the rights of Walenger and Alberic his Brother, as Tenants there.2 I think it probable that Walenger of whom I have spoken more fully elsewhere,2 was also a Feoffee in Culmington. In 1221 Walinger fitz Hugh, perhaps his descendant, was sentenced to give a third of a virgate in Culmington to Elias le Parker, whom he had enfeoffed in half a virgate in Richard's Castle, and who being sued by Richard fitz Osbert and Lucia his wife for the said half virgate, as dower of Lucia, had lost it, and became thus entitled to an equi valent. The marriage between William Longespee and Matilda de Clifford was first proposed by King Henry III, as we have seen, in 1244. This marriage was not consummated for some years after. A good authority assigns to the year 1254 a grant mfrank-marriage of the Manor of Culmington to the said William and Matilda by Walter de Clifford her Father.3 Culmington was then valued at \u00a328. 8s. 2c?. per annum, which sum was to be made good out of Corf ham in the event of any deficiency.* The whole settlement of Wal ter de Clifford on his daughter was to be \u00a3200. per annum. Cul mington, thus transferred, must be taken to include the mesne-tenure not only of Beche and Norton, but also of Siefton, a Manor which though originally independent had gradually been absorbed in Cul mington. By what means the whole came to the hands of John de Braose I cannot declare, but in 1257 he was clearly seized of Domesday, so. 251, a, 1. Sir James de Audley, etc. I suppose it was cotemporary with the consummation of the marriage in question. - Supra, Vol. Ill, pp. 331, 315. 3 Kennel t's Parochial Antiquities, p. 248.

Matilda de Clifford's interest in all, for he then had the King's Charter of Free- Warren in Culminton, Smetou (Siefton), Norton, and La Bache, and also a grant of Market and Fair in Culminton.6 Also at the Forest Assizes of 1262, a wood at Sineton (Siefton), which being within regard of the Long Forest was assessed at half a merk for waste thereof, is called \"the Bosc of Sir John de Breuse.\" It does not account for De Braose's Tenure to state that Matilda de Clifford's first husband, William Longespee, died early in 1257; for John de Braose has never been suggested as her second husband : in fact it is more probable that he was her half-brother, and we know also that the two had litigation together at a later period. We have seen also that from 1259 to 1263 John de Braose extended his claims even to Corfham, still held by Walter de Clifford, Matilda's Father. Walter de Clifford (III) died about December 1263, and then it appears certain that Culmington was possessed by Margery his Widow, whose tenure must have been in dower. She, be it re membered, was a daughter of Lewellyn, Prince of Wales, who in the year 1264 so actively seconded Montfort's rebellion against Henry III. On the other hand Roger de Clifford, nephew of Wal ter de Clifford, deceased, had in that year become a firm and dis tinguished Royalist. In 1264 and 1265, while the King was a captive, Roger de Clifford's name is usually associated with the names of Roger de Mortimer and Hamo Le Strange, in those fabricated Pa tents which were devised by Montfort for the purpose of entrapping or getting rid of these Patriots of the Marches. Prince Edward, it will be remembered, escaped from Hereford on May 30, 1265. It was a signal for the Royalist Leaders tobestir themselves. On July 25, Roger de Clifford ejected its Welsh Mistress from the Manor of Culming ton, and took possession of it himself. Ten days later and he fought under Prince Edward at Evesham, and fourteen days later the e- mancipated King gave him Custody of all the Forests citra Trent.6 Other favours to him and to his son Roger followed ; but it is more to our present purpose to state that Roger de Clifford Senior re tained possession of Culmington till June 24, 1270. In the previous year he had been repeatedly impleaded for the same by one Walter de Wanford, and had as often failed to appear. At last sentence went by default, viz. \" that Walter de Wanford do recover the said Manor.\" ? This suit I find to have been a mere fiction, for on June 24, 1270, Walter de Wanford entered on possession under the sen- 5 Rot. Cart. 41 Hen. III. 6 Patent, 49 Hen.

Meantime Margery de Clifford was stirring to recover the Manor. A Writ of 1270 appoints Master Richard de Stanes to try her action of novel disseizin against Roger de Clif- ford concerning her tenement in Colminton.8 On August 29, 1271, she got sentence in her favour after a trial taken before Walter de Helyun, a Justiciar of that period ; but it appears that she did not thus obtain re-entry, for a Writ of January 27, 1272, orders Wal- ter de Helyun to certify the King of the particulars of an Assize, which had been taken between Margaret de Clifford and Roger de Clifford Senior concerning a tenement in Kilmington. Another Writ of July 26, 1272, explains this. It recites how Margaret de Clifford had complained to the King that, though she had long be- fore recovered seizin of the Manor of Culmington against Roger de Clifford Senior and Junior, and though her damages had been taxed at \u00a370., the two Defendants still held the Manor. The Writ fur- ther orders that the period of such unlawful tenure be ascertained by Inquest. That Inquest was held at Ludlow on October 11, 1272, and furnishes the principal materials of the foregoing narrative.9 This story, I should observe, in no way countenances the idea before alluded to, viz. that Roger de Clifford, Senior, was or claimed to be heir of his Uncle's Barony. He had seized on Culmington by force, and at a lawless period. His object in procuring his son's feoffment was probably to escape the first effect of an action for disseizin which he knew could only be valid against the Tenant in possession : a man\u0153uvre which seems to have been counteracted by Margaret de Clifford suing both him and his son jointly. She of course ultimately recovered possession, though I have no evidence of the fact. We know however that the Manor afterwards returned to her late husband's heirs, for it was part of the estates of which John Giffard died seized in 1299. Of Undertenants here, I may notice, \u2014 Alexander de Cheney, who, in June 1250, sues Walter de Clifford for disseizin iu Culminton and Sireton (Siefton), and pays 20s. for the Writ. In 1299 John, Bailiff of Culminton, is named as a Tenant under John Giffard, deceased. CULMINGTON CHURCH AND PARISH.

Because the Church was very poor, yielding only \u00a32. per annum, Clifford added to his gift a virgate of land in Sidi tonia (Siefton), held by Master Roger de Beche at a rent of 5s. The witnesses of this were Osbert fitz Hugh (he was dead in 1185), Walter the Grantor's son, William de Eton, Robert de Beche, Master Roger his brother.11 Between the years 1220 and 1226 Hugh Foliot, Bishop of Hereford, received, at the presentation of Osbert, Abbot of Haghmon, John de Wrocestre to the Church of Culminton, and instituted him as Parson, saving however the per petual Vicarage of the said Church as taxed {i. e. apportioned) by the Bishop. Witnesses, \u2014 Adam, Chaplain of Westbury, Thomas, Precentor of Hereford, Robert Grossoteste, and Richard de Here ford, the Bishop's Official.12 In May 1248 an Assize of Dernier Presentment about this Church was tried at Gloucester. Walter de Clifford asserted that he had presented Adam, the Parson last de ceased, and in the present King's reign. The Abbot asserted that his Predecessor Osbert had presented John, his Clerk; that the said John was the last deceased Parson, and that Adam was only Vicar.13 The matter ended in a fine between Walter de Clifford (III), Plaintiff, and Gilbert, Abbot of Haggeman, Deforciant, whereby the Abbot resigned his right to this Advowson. In return, Clifford conceded to the Abbot the homage of Richard Bell (Balie) and his heirs in Sydinton (Siefton), to hold in pure almoign for ever.14 In 1291 the Church of Culmynton in the Deanery of Ludlow was taxed at \u00a310. annual value.15 In 1341 the Assessors of the Ninth, quoting this Church-Taxation, reduced the assessment on the Parish to \u00a33.

Roger de Leye, Acolyte, was admitted Feb. 20, 1296. Fulco, son of Sir Roger16 Corbet, knight, was instituted on the Wi of the ides of March (perhaps March 7) 1311 on presentation of Sir Fulk Le Strange. The Church was also commended to Master William de Bosco, Chancellor of Sarum. On April 10, 1312, it was commended to Sir Roger de Eyton, Priest; and on March 27, 1314, to William de Eyneton, Priest. Sir Walter occurs as Rector in 1346. Sir Thomas Camoyll, Chaplain, was instituted Nov. 11, 1360, on the death of a previous Incumbent, and in compliance with a Patent of King Edward III, who presented, as Custos of the lands and heir of Sir John le Strange of Whitchurch (De Albo Mona sterio), Knight. John de Halle, Clerk, instituted March 20, 1367, on presen tation of Maria le Strange, Lady of Corfham, occurs again in 1389. Sir John Davies, Chaplain, instituted August 12, 1396, on a like presentation, occurs as Rector in 1398, 1407, and 1420. He died in 1423, when, on Sept. 28\u2014 Sir Roger Stede.uan, Chaplain, was instituted on presentation of Sir John Talbot, Lord Talbot, Furnyvall, and De Corfham. He resigned in 1425, when, on October 12 \u2014 Sir ****, son of Robert Henrysson, was instituted on a like presentation. BECHE. Hugh de Periers' grant of Ditton to Wenlock Priory passed 1175.

The particulars of Master Roger de Beche's tenure in Siefton have been incidentally given under Culmington Church. Walter de Clifford's Deed, there recited, gives us the name of a third Brother, viz. Robert de Beche, who, as well as Master Roger, is among the witnesses. This was between 1177 and 1185. Again I must refer to my account of Wheathill for a Deed which I have ventured to date between 1180 and 1196, the two first witnesses of which are Master Roger de la Beche and Achilles his brother.20 At the County Assizes of October 1203, Anchell de Bach, as he is writ- ten, essoigned his attendance at the common summons. He is the Knight Aschilles who in March 1212 witnessed the agreement of Osbern, Rector of Diddlebury, with the Abbey of Seez, and who stood Surety for Osbern's performance of his part of the Covenant. The Assize-Roll of November 1221 gives Achilles de la Bech as having been one of the four Coroners of Shropshire, probably since the last preceding Assizes. Of three of them the Roll states that they were dead ; \u2014 of Achilles de la Bech, that he was ill {ianguidus est)?1 In a Schedule of amercements inflicted in this Eyre, one merk is charged against \" Achilles de Bech, one of the Coroners, because he came not to give answer concerning his time,\" i. e. his period of office.21 The cotemporary Pipe-Roll records the amerce- ment more briefly, viz. as inflicted on Achilles, quia non venit. We thus get at the meaning of the latter expression, so common on Amercement- Rolls of the period. Achilles de Beche was at this period (1221) very old. The same Assize-Roll gives us the names of two of his sons, \u2014 William and Richard. Richard fitz Achilles had been already married and was dead. It was proved that on his marriage his Father Achilles dowered his wife Isabella, at the Church Door, of a tenement in Beche ; that Richard died in Au- tumn just past, and that after his death Isabella remained seized of her said dower till the very time when the Justices Itinerant reached Shrewsbury; that then William fitz Achilles (her Brother-in-law) and Robert fitz Ingeni (probably Ingenulf ) disseized her. She now, while the Justices were still at Shrewsbury, recovered her seizin and had damages against the Defendants of 30s. 6c?. in money, and two cows of 13s. value.31 The cotemporary Pipe-Roll gives William fitz Achilles as owing half a merk to the Crown for disseizin.

The Lady in this in stance is called Isabella de Taunglaunt, by which I understand either that Thongland was her maiden name or the name of her second husband. In October 1227 a Fine was levied at Salop between William fitz Achilles, Plaintiff, and Isabella de Taunglaunt, Tenant, of the vill of Beches, which William had claimed under assize of mort d'ancestre. Isabella now renounced all the right which she had in name of dower, and similarly all right in all other lands at Diddlebury, Abdon, and Dudinghop, which she was requiring from the said William on the day of this Concord. In return William gave and conceded to Isabella an annuity of 42s. for her life, to be paid half-yearly at Beches, by William and his heirs or their Bailiffs. In default of payment, a power of re-entry into the vill of Beches is reserved to Isabella. The Feodaries of 1240 vary in stating that William Achilles, or Attehill, then held -rVth, or \\th, of a knight's fee in Diddlebury under Walter de Clifford.23 The Tenure was doubtless one-tenth of *a fee, and lay in Beche as well as Diddle bury. Before 1246 William Achilles was deceased, and his son, called Richard fitz William, or Richard Achilles, had succeeded. The latter had neglected to pay his Aunt the annuity of 42s. cove nanted by his Father. She therefore, with Henry de Bradelegh, now her husband, had sued him for the same under a placitum finis facti as it was termed. A second Fine was the result, \u2014 levied at Westminster in January 1246. Thereby Richard fitz William again undertook to pay Isabella's life-annuity of 42s., but at Diddlebury, instead of at Beche. He also re-admitted her power of distress, and paid her and her husband 100s. for their damages. In 1255 the Corfham Jurors included Bach among the 7\\ hides of the collective Manor of Corfham. Richard Achillis, they said, held it of Sir Walter de Clifford by service of one-tenth of a knight's fee, returnable, it would seem, by four days' ward iu time of war at Corfham Castle, and at the Tenant's cost. Richard Achilles did suit to the Court of Corfham. His name, printed as Richard Athill, appears among the Jurors who made this return.2'1 Richard Achilles was also a Corfham Juror at the Assizes of 1256. In February 1259 I find Henry de Bradelegh and his wife Isabella again suing Richard fitz William, as he is called, for his neglect in observing the 22 Supra, Vol. IV, p. 129. i -' Rot. Hundred.

The case was adjourned to Trinity Term in consequence of the nonappearance of the Defendant.25 In October 1260 Richard Achilles was one of the Manucaptors of John de Braose in the cause mentioned under Corfham.26 A suit of the same year concerning lands in Little Sutton aud Did dlebury, and in which Richard Achilles was concerned, has been given under Little Sutton.26 At the Assizes of 1267 Richard Palemosc claimed half a virgate in La Bache, as heir of his Father, Robert Palemose, alleged to have died seized thereof. Hugh de Haluton, the tenant in posses sion called William Moil of Ludlow to warranty ; William Moil similarly called Hugh Russel ; and the latter called Richard Achilles, who deposed that he possessed no tenement such as to enable him to vouch a warranty. Evidence was given that he had a messuage and certain rents, and the Court ordered him to vouch a warranty so far as the said tenement and rents were available for that purpose. The result does not appear.27 At the same Assizes Richard Achilles of Dudelbir', Hugh Russel, Hugh de Haluton, and others were found to have disseized William de Sineton and Margery his wife of a messuage and half- virgate in Beche. Hugh de Haluton deposed that he had bought the premises from William Moyl, and so his amercement was excused.27 Lastly, at these Assizes Richard Achilles, Hugh de Cheyney, and Roger de Bradeley were sued for disseizing Isabella, Widow of Henry de Bradeley, of 32s. {sic) rent in Bache. Hugh and Roger only were found to have been the Disseizors.27 Roger de Bradeley here mentioned seems at this period to have acquired most of Richard Achilles' estate in Beche, and probably by purchase. Possibly he was the son of Henry de Bradeley, and had disseized his Mother of her dower. The Feodary of 1284 gives him as Mesne-Lord of La Bache, holding the vill under John Gif fard. His cotemporary interest in Thonglands28 seems to be con nected with the circumstance of Isabella, his presumed mother, having on a former occasion been called De Taunglaunt. He has also occurred to us in 1292, as having an interest in Holgate.29 In October 1296 a Fine was levied at Westminster, whereby 25 Placita, Hil. Term, 43 Hen.

In September 1235 Alexander de Cheny appears as Seneschal of Walter de Clifford.30 In or about 1240 Hugh de Chenay (or de Cheene) is variously represented as holding half a fee and a third of a fee in Norton under Walter de CHfford.31 The last statement is the true one; for the Inquest of 1255, reckon ing Norton among the seven-and-half hides of Corfham, says that Hugh de Cheyne holds the vill of Sir Walter de Clifford for one third of a Knight's-fee, \u2014 that is, by doing 15 days' ward at Corf ham Castle in war-time at his own cost. Hugh de Cheyne also did suit to the Court of Corfham.32 In 1256 Hugh de Cheney was returned among those who, holding 15 Librates of land in Shrop shire, were not yet knighted. About 1260 we shall see him as Hugh de Chennei attesting a Charter to Acornbury. He has already occurred under Beche in 1267. In 1284 John de Cheyne held the vill of Norton under John Giffard for a third part of a knight's-fee.

It can hardly have been in any prospect of the pious uses to which, about thirty years after wards, the Lady converted her estate. Between the years 1257 and 1262 Catherine de Lacy granted the whole tenement which she held of Sir Walter de Clifford in the Manor of Corfham to the Church of the Holy Cross of Acornbury, and to the Prioress and Nuns there serving God. Her Charter, which, as printed else where,3* I need not more fully transcribe, included Borleye, the bosc called Brenhales, a virgate held by Eytrop de Siretone (Sief ton), and two nokes held by William Glorn. Her object was to maintain a Chaplain at Acornbury to celebrate daily mass for the health of the said Walter de Clifford and Margaret his wife, and Dame Mathildis de Longespee their daughter,35 and Margaret her daughter. Together with this grant Catherine de Lacy, for greater security, surrendered to the Nuns the charter which she herself had sometime had from Sir Walter de Clifford. Her Deed is attested by Sir William Devereux, Sir Roger de Clifford, Sir Richard Tirel, Sir Robert de Lacy, Sir William Racheford, Vicar of Tenbury, Hugh de Chennei, (i. e. Cheney) Warm de Grendon, and William de Wodetun.36 Sir Walter de Clifford's Charter most fully confirming Katherine de Lacy's grant, may well be of even date. It is printed elsewhere,37 and was attested by Sir Henry, then Abbot of Dore, Sir William de Braose,38 Sir Roger de Clifford,38 Sir Hugh his Brother,38 Sir Robert le Bret, Sir William le Rocheford, then Vicar of Tenbury, Richard le Bret, and Griffin Wendhout.

The result does not appear, nor can I say how Katherine de Lacy came to have such interest at Middlehope. Burley continued in possession of the Nuns of Acornbury till the Dissolution. In 1534-5 it was returned as yielding in rents and ferms \u00a32. 18s. 3\\d. per annum?1 The Ministers' Accounts, two years later, give nearly the same estimate, but the income derived by the Nunnery from Ludlow and other places is mixed up with that derived from Burley.46 Of Undertenants here I may instance John de Borleg, occur- 39 A significant expression, showing the independence of Corfham and its ad juncts, of any other hundredal jurisdic tion. by William, Vicar of Tenbury, Master John the Physician (Physicus), and Henry de Clifford. 42 Chartulary (ut supra), No. vi. 40 Cousin, I think, of Sir Walter, and a Canon of Hereford (Vide Monasticon, V, 555, Num. vi) . 43 Duncumb's Herefordshire, II, 170.

Haughmond Abbey Fee. \u2014 I have already stated that Walter de Clifford (I) gave about 1180 a virgate in Siditon to Haughmond Abbey, and that about 1200 Walter de Clifford (II) gave inter alia a Mill, a messuage, and half a virgate of land in Syneton to the same House. It would seem that this second Walter de Clifford, while as yet he was seized of the Gloucestershire Manor of Framp- ton, gave to Haughmond a grant of a certain quantity of beans pro- duced there, \u2014 I presume annually. This grant was commuted by Walter de Clifford (the third I think) for an annual rent of 8s. issuing out of two half-virgates of land which Richard Balie held of him in Ciniton. Witnesses, \u2014 John le Strange, Richard de Mid- delhope, Richard Tirrel.2 Again we have seen that in 1248 Walter de Clifford (III), recovering by Fine the Advowson of Culmington from Haughmond Abbey, conceded in return the homage of Richard Balie and his heirs in Sydinton? This concession was in its nature more extensive than the grant of the whole or any part of Richard Basse's rent ; for it made him over to the Abbey as Tenant, with all 1 Domesday, so. 254, a, 1 2 Haughmond Chartulary : Tit.

He grants the whole land, with all appurte nances, which Richard Balie held of him in the vill of Sinetun, viz. the two half-virgates from which the Canons already received 8s. per annum, and all other land held by Richard Balie for which he had hitherto paid 2s. per annum to the Grantor. Witnesses, \u2014 Sir Matthew de Mans, Sir Richard Tirrel, Sir William de Furchis. Well then did the Corfham Jurors of 1255 say that the \"Abbot of Hagh mon had 10s. of assized rent in Corfham Manor by gift of Sir Wal ter de Clifford seven years past.\" Richard Balle's personal appear ance on the said Jury perhaps accounts for this accuracy.4 The same Jurors less accurately declared that the \" Abbot of Hagemon had held two Mills and half a virgate of land in Corfham Manor from the time of Henry II, they knew not by what warranty, hut the Mills and land were worth 5 merks per annum.\" This is evi dently in allusion to the grant of Walter de Clifford (II), but as the Jurors could not specify the Grantor, they were not likely to know the date of the Grant, viz. that it was in the reign of John. I should observe that the grant of a virgate in Siditon by the first Walter de Clifford was in Henry II's time, but it must have been nullified ere this, together with the grant of the Advowson which it was intended to augment. In 1291 the Abbot of Haughmond's Mills in Culminton and Sil veton are valued at \u00a32. per annum ; his rents from two Tenements there were 6s. Sd? The Haughmond Chartulary supplies us with several demises by the Abbot of these tenements, viz. \u2014 one to Ri chard Balie and Petronilla his wife of half a virgate in Ciniton, re serving a rent of 5s. and suit of the Abbot's Court of Neuton (New ton near Stokesay) ; \u2014 another to William Burley, of Cinetone-Mill and a messuage, reserving 16s. rent and a Heriot ; \u2014 a third, dated in 1334, to John son of William Balie of Cineton, leasing the Mill of Culmiton and Cineton for life. The Valor of 1535-6 probably includes the Abbot's receipts from Culmington and Siefton among those of Newton juxt a Stokesay, which were \u00a37. 13s. 8c?.6 The Ministers' Accounts in 1541-2 are a little more specific, giving a Water-Mill at Cibeton as worth \u00a31. 2s. 8c?. per annum, and a rent of 2s. 2c?. from Corbeton (pro- bably the same place) .7 ' Rot.

Among other Undertenants in Siefton I should notice Warin de Grendon, who in October 1259 has a Writ of novel disseizin against Walter de Clifford for a tenement in Syneton, and who in 1270 has a similar Writ against Lewellyn de Braose for a tenement in Cyneton. This latter cause was heard at the Assizes of 1272. It was for 9s. 4c?. rent in Cyneton ; but as Lewclin de Brcuwic {sic) called John Giffard and Matilda his wife to warranty, it was ad journed.8 This Warin de Grendon had property also in Ludlow. He was son of that Warin de Grendon who from 1219 to 1221 acted as Under-Sheriff of Herefordshire for Walter de Lacy. Under Lacy he held the Herefordshire Manor of Grendon- Warin, which thus acquired its distinctive name.9 About the year 1262 Katherine de Lacy, so often mentioned above, granted to Acornbury a rent of 2 merks in Stoke Bliss (Herefordshire). Her deed is attested by Sir William Rector (Query Vicar) of Tenbury, Sir Roger Rector of Grendon, and by Warin de Grendon, her Seneschal.10 Other Tenants under Clifford and his heirs, had their holdings probably in Siefton. Of these I may instance Walter Meyler, oc curring in 1255, 1256, 1260, 1272, and 1274, Adam Balie and Roger Chaplain of Cyneton, occurring in 1274, and Isabella de Sineton occurring in 1299.

At a later period there was one Simon, a Feoffee in Corfham, and who, if a Clifford, was brother I think of the second Walter. This Simon had two sons, Richard and Simon. Richard has already occurred to us as Richard fitz Simon, and as having in 1233 custody of Clifford Castle.11 In the year 1248 Sir Richard fitz Simon, with Sir Simon his brother (who I believe was sometime a Canon of Hereford), joined in granting a virgate-and-half of land and an assart in Corfham Manor to Clifford Priory. The gift was worth 2 merks annually, said the Jurors of 1255, but a chief-rent of 2*. to Sir Walter de Clifford was payable thereon.13 I can trace little 8 Assizes, 56 Hen.

The Ministers' Accounts of 1536-7 give also a Shropshire estate or estates of Clifford Priory, viz. a tenement and land iu Sybington (perhaps Siefton) yielding 16s., and Hylhall Manor yielding 13s. per annum.13 Besides the various Undertenants to whom I have endeavoured to assign a fitting mention under Corfham, Culmington, and Siefton, many others remain ; \u2014 but as I cannot fix the locality of their hold ings I must mention them in mass as Tenants in the aggregate Manor. These were, \u2014 William fitz Matilda, Adam Tropin, and William de Opford, Jurors on the Inquest of 1255 ; \u2014 also Reginald Chaplain of Dourleg, Master John the Physician of Blockeleg, Philip Sturmi, and Richard le Franseys of Hulton, Defaulters on the same occasion. Philip Esturmy, William de Furchis, and Roger fitz Faber appear as Corfham Jurors, under Robert de Luntel, their Bailiff, in 1256. Roger de Mutti was a Juror in 1272, and Richard fitz Alice, John Fillot, Roger de Monte, William de Bulledon, and Adam the Beadle, were Jurors or tenants in 1274. Simon de Bys sell was Chief Bailiff, and Philip de Cheyny, Hugh Sturmy, Adam le Bedel, and Nicholas le Barber, were Jurors at the Assizes of 1292. Hugh Stormy, Thomas de Monte, Richard de Middelhope, Nicholas le Barber, Walter Tropyn, Hugh de Bolledon, Adam le Bedell, Roger Faber, and William le Yunge, occur on local Juries of 1299, which Juries name Hugh Stormy, William le Yunge, Ricard Jug, William de Hulle, Nicholas le Barber, Martin le Lechour, Richard Faber, William Maddok, William dc Bondy, Alice de Caunville, William le Porter, Richard de Middelhope and William de Lodelowe as Corfham Tenants.

Here then did the Cliffords exercise those rights which ordinarily belonged to Royal Forests. King John confirming the Manor of Corfham and Culmington to Walter de Clifford (II) in 1199, adds \"the Haye of Ernestreu and Les Clines.\" At the Assizes of 1203 it would almost seem that the Clee Forest was represented by distinct Jurors, as if not involved in the Liberty of Corfham. A space at least is allotted on the Roll for the \" Clies\" as well as for Corfham, though no presentments were entered under either. The Foresters of Walter de Clifford (II) were wont to levy a certain impost, called Doverett, on all lands within jurisdiction of the Clee Forest. The great Manor of Prior's Ditton was thus assessable; but it appears that Joybert, Prior of Wenlock, came to some agreement with Clifford, acquitting his tenants of the liability. In Trinity Term 1230 I find Prior Imbert suing Walter de Clifford (III) to observe the convention made by his Father. Clifford appeared not, and the case was ad journed to November following.1 Before that time Clifford's ag gression had assumed another character ; for the'' Prior charged Walter de Clifford, Hugh de Kynardel', Philip Angevin, William de Clifford, Peter de Middleton, John Wyard, Roger and Herbert, Foresters, Walter de Parin (Paris), Roger Dun of Peton, Walter fitz Ivo, William Oliver, Wylloc Beadle of Corfham, and William fitz Adam of Peton with grave trespasses, viz. with wounding and imprisoning the Prior's men. This charge was first preferred in the County Court ; but the Prior, conceiving that a false judg ment was given by that Court, appealed to Westminster. The King's Justices ordered the Sheriff of Shropshire to make record in a full County-Court of the proceedings in this case, and to re turn the same to Westminster before Oct. 20th, 1230. The Sheriff failed to do so, aud the Justices made a similar order returnable by the Sheriff m three weeks of Hilary 1231.3 The Rolls of that Term are lost ; but we have a Fine of Hilary Term 1232 which probably settled all the points at issue. It was between \"Prior Imbert, 1 Placita, Hil. Term, 14 Hen. Ill, m 17. 2 Placita, Mich. Term, 14 and 15 Hen. Ill, m. 10."], [234, "198 THE CLEE FOREST.

The Con vention was as follows. \u2014 The Prior conceded that Clifford should maintain the same Forest {i. e. Forest-rights) in the boses of Dit ton aud Stoke, as he maintained in the boses pertaining to his Forest of Clive. \u2014 The Prior was to keep in tillage all lands in the Hayes of Stoke and Ditton which were under tillage at the date of this Fine; also to assart 40 acres more in Pakemore, but he was not to build any house on the said assarted lands. Clifford con ceded that the Prior and his Successors should be quit of the cus toms first alluded to in the Fine, and should have certain common pasture and easements. The Prior and his Successors should more over have their own Foresters in their demesne-boscs of Stoke and Ditton, provided the said Foresters swore fealty to Clifford con cerning good care to be taken of his venison, and prosecuted all attachments against the Prior's men (being malefactors against venison), according to the mode and custom ofthe Forests of Eng land. The men thus attached should be dealt with in Clifford's own Court. The Prior and his Successors should have the tenth beast of those taken in the said demesne-boscs of Stoke and Ditton, and also of those started in the said boses and taken elsewhere. Lastly, Clifford should have Foresters of his own, to keep the said boses in conjunction with the Prior's Foresters. In October 1253 Walter de Clifford was suing William Mauduit, William fitz John, and Hugh de Dudmaston, before the King in Council, for taking a Boar in the Forest of Corfham (which I sup pose to be the Clee Forest rather than that portion of the Long Forest which pertained to Corfham) . The Defendants had often failed to appear to this charge. The Sheriff was now ordered to distrain Mauduit and arrest his two Esquires, as they are called.3 In 1255 the Jurors of Stottesden Hundred complained that the Foresters of Sir Walter de Clifford required from every house 3 Placita coram Rege, 37, 38 Hen.

The Vills which refused to attend were heavily fined by the Constable. He had also placed four or five Deer-Keepers where there used to be but one, and this was at the cost of the country. He would not permit the Lord of any Manor to take aught from such Lord's own proper woods if within the free-chace aforesaid ; \u2014 and this was con trary to former custom. He also compelled the Free-Tenants within the Chace of Clyes to serve on Juries, without the King's precept. This was apparently said with reference to the Manorial Court of Corfham. Moreover these Jurors represented that John Giffard had for four years appropriated a right of warren within his Free Chace, no such right having previously existed. Other special trespasses these Jurors alleged against John de la Watere, in re- spect of the Forest jurisdiction of his Lord. I have alluded to these in their fitting place. The Jurors wound up their charges by protesting that the whole country round the Chace of the Clyes was nearly ruined by these and other extortions, whereof the number was unknown.8 The Jurors of Wenlock Liberty also joined in the outcry, showing specially how the Prior and his men ' Rot.

The Corfham Jurors on the same occasion presented that John Giffard claimed Free-Chace in La Clee and a Free-Hay e in Ernestre, as pertaining to his Manor of Corfham, in the whole of which Manor he also claimed Free- Warren. A consequent but not quite accurate Writ of Quo Waranto questioned him {inter alia) for \"having Free- Chace in his Manors of Corfham and Cley,\" \u2014 to which he answered pertinently enough, that Cley was a mountain within Corfham Manor, i. e. no Manor of itself.9 The rest of his defence did not touch on the question of Free-Chace, but was in fact a refusal to plead, as I have before set forth.10 The Inquisition on his death in 1299 gives the profits on Ernestre-Bosc as 6s. 8c?. per annum, and on a pasture on Le Cle, called Heymedewe, as 6s. 8c?. also. I conclude this branch of the subject with remarking that the great Forest-Perambulation of 1 300, which relaxed so much of the Royal claims in Shropshire, did not touch the jurisdiction of the Clee Forest. Forestership of the Clee. \u2014 The office of at least one Forester under the Cliffords was held in fee and inheritance, or at least al leged to be so held by the family of Wyard, who anciently had it. The Progenitor of this family is called \" Wiard the Forester\" in the only notice which I have of him, and which has been given under Burwarton.11 It there appears that he was dead in 1199, leaving a Widow Alice, whose dower lay in some place not quite legible in the Record, but which I think may possibly stand for Loughton. William Wiard was then at issue with Alice, who had remarried to Roger de Burwarton. This Williani was doubtless Wiard's son and heir, and though he was said fifty years after, by his own Grandson, to have held the Cbfford Forestership in Henry II' s time, I venture to doubt that assertion. He occurs again, I think, at the Assizes of 1203 under the name of William fitz Wiard, when he gives the King half a merk for license to accord some suit, his Surety being Walter Haket (of Wheathill, I think) ,la William Wiard was succeeded by 8 Rot.

John Wyard had certainly succeeded to Philip in or before 1230, when, with two others of Walter de Clifford's Foresters, he participated in his Lord's outrage on the Prior of Wenlock, as already described. Precisely at this time, if I may judge from the names of persons common to both transactions, Clifford was making great concessions to Shrewsbury Abbey in respect of that part of the Clee Forest which abutted on Loughton. These concessions it seems touched upon John Wyard's interests as Forester. About the year 1247 he seems to have made terms with the Abbey. By one Charter \"John Wyard, son of Philip Wyard, releases to the Abbey 120 acres of the Bosc of Luchton, which Sir Walter de Clifford had already dis forested and clearly conceded to the Monks. John Wyard however reserves to himself three roads called Dukesli, Hageswey, and Fule wey, by the which he might drive his Cattle to his free pastures without hindrance of the Monks. For this the Abbot gave him one merk. Witnesses, \u2014 Sir Robert de Halechton, Philip de Baggesour, W.

Witnesses, \u2014 Robert de Halechton, Richard Tyrel, Thomas de Cos tentin, Knights.\"13 We have seen that Walter de Clifford incurred forfeiture in 1233 for his alleged rebellion. He seems also to have suffered a partial forfeiture for his rebellious conduct in 1250. On the latter occa sion the Clee-Forest was in the King's hand, and, as Clifford after wards deposed, the King gave John Wyard's Bailiwick to one Roger de Hogelawe. John Wyard however, contradicting Clifford, stated that Clifford himself had ejected him, in or about the year 1251. Wyard certainly seems to have acted in accordance with the latter idea. The Pipe-Roll of 1252 gives John Wyard as fining one merk for a Writ of Pone, i. e. to change the venue of some pending cause. From the Shropshire Assize-Roll of 1256 we probably learn what that cause was. \u2014 \" Walter de Clifford appeared in Court to answer John Wyard in the following Plea, viz. that he, Clifford, should per mit Wyard to have a Bailiwick iu the Forest, viz. in Northlye.\" The 13 Salop Chartulary, No. 128, c and d.

Clifford replied that \" Wyard had no Charter on the subject, nor had he possession of the tenement to which the Bailiwick in question appertained, but that he had held office merely by favour : moreover, as to the tenement to which the Bailiwick ap pertained, Roger de Hogelawe held that, aswell as the Bailiwick, by gift of the King, when the Bailiwick was in the King's hand.\"14 The result I cannot trace, but in December 1258 John Wyard was one of the Jurors on the death of Philip de Baggesore, a Royal Forester. LOUGHTON. My sole reason for treating of this place here is that a great part of the Manor consisted of lands taken from the Clee Forest. I can not find the original Manor of Loughton in Domesday lb but early in the next century it belonged to Salop Abbey. Now whereas the Chartulary of that House does not inform us how it came into pos session of Loughton, we naturaUy search for a probability that Loughton was involved in some Domesday Manor in which the Abbey had already an interest. Stottesden and Morville present themselves as alone likely, and if to Morville was attached the dis tant Berewick of Cold Weston, and if Duddlewick and Prestcot were members of Stottesden, analogy would lead us to suppose that Loughton might have been a member of either Morville or Stottes den, and so have come to Salop Abbey with its other share of either Manor. But we are minutely told what the vills were which the Abbey acquired in Morville and Stottesden, and Loughton is not among them. Again Loughton was parochially a member of Chet ton, and it is reasonable just to ascertain whether its manorial con- 14 Assizes, 40 Hen. Ill, m. 9 dorso. Loketon to Salop Abbey between 1108 and 1121. It is not necessary now to in quire where this land was. It could hardly have been Loughton, for Robert Corbet had nothing in that quarter of Shropshire, if we are to trust in Domesday. 15 Roger fitz Corbet had a Manor Luche tune in Ruesset Hundred (Domesday, so. 255, b),but that was undoubtedly Loton, \u2014 now Loton Park. Also Robert Corbet gave some land (terram unam) named"], [239, "203 LOUGHTON. dition may not have been similar. This is easily done, and the re sult is negative. No grant in Chetton was ever made to Shrews bury Abbey ; and Chetton in the thirteenth century was so far from having lost aught of its Domesday adjuncts, that its hidage was in creased. Summarily then we conclude that Loughton is omitted in Domesday, that is, it neither appears under any specific name, nor can we assign it as a member of any greater Manor. I have often said that lands, exclusively forest, are not surveyed in tlie Shropshire Domesday. My idea is that Loughton was then involved in the Clee Forest, but subsequently colonized by the Monks of Shrewsbury under some unrecorded relaxation or permission of the Norman Earls, or of the Crown. I have adverted in a note to the very slender possibility that Loughton was identical with certain land called Loketon, which was given by Robert Corbet to Shrewsbury Abbey between 1108 and 1121. Even if this were so, my main conclusion holds good, viz. that Loughton is unmentioned in Domes day, for that Record gives Robert Corbet nothing in the neigh bourhood now under notice. Passing from theories to facts, we find Loughton in possession of Shrewsbury Abbey about the year 1138, when Bishop Betun's con firmation to that House, after naming certain tithes in Dudelwich, Stottesden, and Walkerslow, further allows the Monks two parts of the tithes of their demesne of Luchton, and all the tithes of their demesne of Tugford.16 Luchton, mentioned in such a sequence, is assuredly Loughton, and the reservation of a third of its tithes was probably connected with its parochial subjection to Chetton. About the year 1225, as I think, Walter de Clifford for one merk paid to him by the Monks of Salop, gave license that their Goats should go and feed in the Bosc of Luhtune. \u2014 Witnesses, Egidius de Clifford the Grantor's brother, Richard Tyrel, John d'Ebroicis (Devereux), Thomas de Baskerville, Thomas de Costantin, Symon de Leeg Clerk, William de Clifford Constable of Corfham.17 About 1230 Walter de Clifford grants to Salop Abbey 100 acres of Bosc in the Bosc of Luhtone, whereof each acre was to be 40 perches by 4 perches, and each perch 25 feet. \u2014 Witnesses, Richard Tyrel, Richard fitz Symon Knights, Robert de Estone Constable of Corfham, Hugh de Kynsithelege, Robert de Bolledon, Richard de Ballecote, John de {sic) Wyard, Walter de Paris, Herbert Forester of Clye.18 16 Chartulary, No. 334. | 17 Salop Chartulary, No. 8. ] 18 Ibidem, No. 9.

There is another, and, judging by the witnesses' names, a nearly cotemporary grant of Walter de Clifford's to Salop Abbey, but whether it was intended to reconvey the premises named in the last, under a corrected measurement but with a considerable ad dition, or whether it was a grant de novo, conveying 120 acres over and above the hundred acres of the last, I cannot say. \u2014 Styling him self \" Walter de Clifford son of Walter de Clifford and Agnes de Cundy,\" he grants to Salop Abbey in pure almoign, 120 acres of the Bosc of the said monks at Luhtone, of which the Bosc and site were already theirs, to assart, fence, and dispose of as they liked ; provided the beasts of his forest should be able to pass in and out according to the custom of the forest ; provided also that the said acres should be those nearest to the vill of Luhtune and consist of uncultivated (frised) land and bosc, between Roger de Ondeslawe's Assart and the watercourse {Sichet) towards Burwarton. Each acre in this case was to be 40 perches by 4 perches, but each perch was to be only 24 feet. The witnesses are the same as in the last, except that Sir Richard de Clifford, Knight, occupies the second place, and Hugh de Kynsithelege is omitted.19 John Wyard's Charters, supplemental to Clifford's, have before been given. It is observable that the Stottesden Jurors of 1255 exclude Loughton from their ordinary Survey. The probable rea son was that they had no precedents or Records enabling them to fix its status, \u2014 a natural consequence of its omission in Domesday. Again in 1256 the Charter of Free-Warren, granted to Shrewsbury Abbey, includes Duddlewick and Tugford, but omits Loughton. The reason was because the latter was within the jurisdiction ofthe Clee Forest. At the Assizes of 1256 Simon fitz Philip of Lutton sued Ralph Parson of Lynrugg (Lindridge) Robert de Furches, Ralph fitz Robert of Hul, and Benedict de Duderhul for disseizing him of 3 acres in Lutton. Roger Bonoste and William de la Lawe, two of the Recognizors in this cause, did not appear ; but the Jury found that John Wyard having first enfeoffed the Plaintiff in the premises, had afterwards disseized him, that then John Wyard had enfeoffed Ralph Parson of Lindridge in these and other lands, that the said ford's trespass on Wenlock Priory in 1230.

The Plaintiff was allowed to obtain a remedy by some other process.20 It is probable that the above suit concerned land in Clifford's fee, not in the Shrewsbury Abbey estate. In June 1259 Matilda, daughter of Richard de Lowton, sues the Abbot of Shrewsbury and others for disseizin in Lowton. Between the years 1266 and 1271, William Abbot of Shrewsbury concedes to Robert fitz Adam of Stoke, for his own life and for the lives of any two Assignees he might choose, for 5 merks paid, all the assart made by Adam de Stoke in the field of Luchton called Hase lovere. \u2014 Rent to be 2s.

This dispute probably resulted in the Charter whereby, within the next four years, Matilda Longespee confirmed her Father's Grants to Shrewsbury Abbey, \u2014 Roger Tirel, Thomas Boterel, and William de Monkyton, her Seneschal, attesting her Confirmation.23 Between the years 1272 and 1278 Luke, Abbot of Shrewsbury, grants to Sir Thomas Botterel a messuage in the vill of Lucton, and 9 acres in the fields thereof, lying in Wetemore, between Borewar ton and Lucton. \u2014 To hold in fee, at a rent of 3s. 4d. \u2014 Witnesses, Sir Ralph de Arras, Sir John de la Lee, and Sir John fitz Aer.2* In 1291 the Abbot of Shrewsbury's receipts from Loughton are probably included in those of Duddlewick.25 The Valor of 1534 and the Ministers' Accounts of 1541-2 are equally indistinct as to any separate estimate of Loughton.

We also determine that the Hundred of the latter, not expressed in Domesday, was Culves tan, \u2014 the known Hundred of Upper Poston. As to Chetel, Saxon Lord of Lower Poston, he had also a part of that Manor of Stanton which afterwards was called the Manor of Holgate.2 Earl Roger then gave one of Chetel' s Manors to Helgot ; the other he bestowed on his own Chapel within the Castle of Shrewsbury, known in Domesday as the \" Church of St. Michael.\" I refer elsewhere for an account of the latter foundation.3 That a Tenure, secured only by payment of a bundle of box to deck the Church on Palm Sun day, should speedily vanish is no matter of surprise. The acknow ledgment was almost worthless in itself, and came from a most un reasonable distance. Except in Domesday, we hear nothing of St. Michael's interest in Lower Poston. The Seigneury of this small Manor became Fitz Alan's, in what way I cannot tell.

I have said more of him under that Manor.6 The connection between Thonglands and Lower Poston does not end here, for the Feodary of 1284, after describing Roger de Bradeley's tenure of Thonglands under Fitz Alan, intimates that a place written Possehne was annexed to the tenancy. I can find nothing more relating to this small estate, and will conclude by observing that its Manorial distinctiveness is well paral leled by something iu its parochial condition, for while Upper Pos ton is in the Parish of Diddlebury, Lower Poston is, like Thong lands, in the Parish of Munslow.

This land Robert now holds under Earl Roger, and it is waste, and was found waste (by the said Robert) . One part with another, the arable land (of the whole xx hides) is sufficient to employ liiii ox teams.\"2 It is seldom that Domesday gives us so many traits of personal character, and so many historical allusions as are involved in the above entry. Edward the Confessor, injudicious in his choice of favourites, zealously pious in his intentions, dilatory and irresolute in his actions, is here drawn in outline. The King was attacked by the fever, of which he died, on December 24, 1065. His Court was, as usual at that season of the year, assembled at Westminster, and Edward, though struggling with mortal disease, presided for three days over the festivities. On the 28th he was too ill to witness the consummation of his darling project, \u2014 the consecration of West minster Abbey, and on the 5th of January he died. Thus passed the \" festal days\" alluded to in Domesday. Other names men tioned in the Domesday notice of Bromfield have a history of their own, and it will be better to take them in chronological order. Spirtes, the Canon, who in his day engrossed half the emolu ments of this Saxon and Collegiate Church, was himself a Saxon, and is elsewhere called Spiritus, or Spirtes Presbyter. He lived in the reigns of three Saxon Kings, Harold I, Hardicanute, and Ed ward the Confessor. With the two first he was a special favourite ; the last banished him, for what cause is not known. The Hereford shire Domesday refers to a period of the Confessor's reign, when Spirites the Priest held four Manors in that County under the Church of St. Guthlac. At Domesday St. Guthlac had lost the Seigneury of these Manors, and the same Nigel the Physician, who had an interest in Bromfield, held them all, independently of the Church.3 Again we are told that Spirtes had a rich Brother named Earnwi, who being a layman, was Pr\u00e6positus under the Church of Worcester, of the Manor of Cotheridge. Earnwi made over Cothe ridge to Spirtes, to the intent that Spirtes, when he paid Earnwi a visit, should, in going and returning, have lodging there. When Spirtes was banished, Richard Scrob seized upon Cotheridge, and so the Church of Worcester lost it, and was still dispossessed when Heming, the Worcester Monk, who tells this story, was writing.* The Worcestershire Domesday calls Cotheridge \" Codrie,\" and describes it as a member of the Bishop of Worcester's Manor of 2 Domesday, so. 252, b, 2.

This part of the Record refers apparently to a period of the Confessor's reign after the banishment of Spirtes, and says that Ricardus (meaning doubtless Richard Scrupe) had then held Codrie by such service as the Bishop required. The Lord of Codrie at the time of Domesday was Osbern fitz Richard (Richard Scrupe's son) ? His descendants clearly held Cotheridge in capite of the Crown and not of the Bishop, and so far Heming's account seems more accurate even than Domesday. To return to Spirtes; \u2014 he was also a Canon of the Collegiate Church of St. Alkmund, Shrewsbury. His Prebend therein was Wistanstow, both the Church and the Manor. The Shropshire Domesday refers back to a period of the Confessor's reign when Spirtes Presbyter (not yet an exile), was holding Wistanstowr of St. Alkmunds.6 A monastic memorial of great credibility, tells us nothing of Spirtes' previous banishment, but begins with the fact of Edward the Confessor bestowing the Prebend of Wistanstow on Godric Wiffesune,. on whose death, says the same record, Earl Roger gave the Prebend to Nehel, a Clerk, his own Physician.7 Domesday, in all but perfect harmony, gives Nigel the Physician as Lord of Wistanstow, but holding it of the King, not of Earl Roger. Further particulars of this local subject shall be given under Wistanstow. Of Nigel the Physician we shall also speak elsewhere. His presentation to the benefices, once Spirtes the Priest's, resulted in another instance besides the six already mentioned. Of Robert Fitz Wimarc, Spirtes' successor in ten hides of Bromfield, I observe that in Kinsr Edward's time he was Lord of the Herefordshire Manor of Torchestone.8 There can be little doubt, I think, that he was identical with Robert the Deacon, a Norman, who was allowed to remain in England when Edward the Confessor, awed by Earl Godwin and his Sons, expelled the Normans in general. If this identification be accepted as true, then that Son-in-law of Robert fitz Wimarch, whom the Domesday no tice of Bromfield mentions without giving his name, can have been no other than Richard Scrupe. I have before adverted to the fact that the Norman Canons, introduced by Earl Roger to English Pre bends, were not bound by the laws of celibacy. Under the Saxon rule such an obligation had never, I imagine, been thought of.9 In 5 Domesday, so. 172, b, 2. 6 Domesday, so. 260, b, 2. appears that the Synod of Winchester for bade tho marriage of Canons of Collegiate Churches in 1076, \u2014 a date which must very nearly tally with some of the earliest of Earl Roger's presentations. ~> Lilleshall Chartulary, so. 100. 8 Domesday, so. 186, b, 1. 9 See History of Shrewsbury, Vol. IT. \\i. 21, for further remarks on this subji 1 . 1 1 v. 29"], [246, "210 BROMFIELD. Robert fitz Wimarc we have an instance of a Canon, acknowledged as such by the scrupulous Edward, but who, as a Father-in-Law, must also have been legally a Father. The Domesday notice of Bromfield requires one more observa tion. The Record names a certain Robert as Earl Roger's, Tenant of 10 hides in Bromfield, whereas we should have expected that Richard Scrupe, the presumed Son-in-law of Robert fitz Wimarc, and himself a Norman, would have remained undisturbed in this Tenure till his death, and that then Osbern fitz Richard his son, succeeding thereto, would have been seized at Domesday. I find however no subsequent evidence of any such lay tenure in Brom field as will correspond with these 10 hides. I conclude that Earl Roger, as was his wont, restored them to the Church on proof of its undoubted title. BROMFIELD PRIORY. The Church of St. Mary at the time of Domesday probably pre- served much of its Saxon constitution, that of a College of Secular Canons, without any ostensible Head, but damaged somewhat in estate by recent changes. I have shown under Morville and under Wenlock, and shall show in other cases, that it was not the Norman policy to maintain these Saxon institutions on their original plan. How soon a change came upon Bromfield, and what the first change was, are things not easy to determine. A Charter of King Henry II, presently to be cited, speaks of Canons of Bromfield and their Prebends as existing in the time of Henry I, and at his own acces- sion, \u2014 as if the Saxon College had in no way been remodelled. However an unvouched authority which speaks of Bromfield as founded in 1105, may possibly allude to some change of that date,10 and when I find Osbert, Prior of Bromfield, attesting about 1115 an ordinance of the Viceroy Belmeis,11 and also attesting a grant to Kenil worth Priory, which must have passed between 1130 and 1135,12 I am assured that his presidency, under the title of Prior, indicates some previous change in the constitution of this Church. A greater change however took place in the reign of Henry II. \u2014 A Chronicle of Gloucester Abbey informs us that in 1155 \"the Canons of Bromfeld gave up themselves and their Church to the Monkish profession or rule {ad monachatum) of the Church of St. Peter's, Gloucester, by mediation {per manuni) of Gilbert Bishop Monasticon, I, 537, a. 12 Monasticon, VI, 231, No. iii. Supra, Vol. Ill, p. 233."], [247, "211 THE PRIORY. of Hereford, and authority of Theobald Archbishop of Canterbury, Legate of the Apostolick See.\"13 Another account represents the matter as if the Canons actually undertook to pass their monastic life in Gloucester Abbey under the then Abbot, \u2014 Hameline.1'1 All the names thus mentioned consist with the date alleged (1155), and the result, whatever the mode and process of the change, was that Bromfield became a Benedictine Priory, inhabited by its own Monks, but subject to Gloucester Abbey. This change cannot have been valid without Royal consent ; for Henry II, as having by escheat the Palatine Earldom of Shrewsbury, was doubtless Patron of every Canonry in this Collegiate Church. Accordingly we have a Charter of Henry II, on the subject,15 which (from the witnesses' names) may well have passed in his first year (1155), but which, by its internal evidence, can only be proved to have passed in one of his first fifteen years. It is remarkable that this Charter, though it sanctions a change from Canonicism to Monachism within the Church of Bromfield, reserves the land-tenures of the existent Ca nons, and says nothing about subjection to Gloucester Abbey, though perhaps the attestation of William Earl of Gloucester may be taken as an indication that the proposed subjection was tacitly recognized. The King calls the Church of St. Mary of Bromfeld his own, and gives it to a Prior and Monks already located there {ibidem Deo servientibus) , \u2014 to hold of himself and his heirs in pure almoign, as a chapel of royal demesne (sicut nostram dominicam capellam),16 with all its prebends (which he enumerates), and saving 13 . 14 Monasticon, IV, 155, No. i ; and Vol. I, p. 545. 16 The precise effect of this expression was well understood at the time. It meant that Bromfield, in whatever state (Colle giate or Monastic), was exempt from Epis copal Jurisdiction. So' Bishop Gilbert Fohot interpreted and accepted the King's Charter in another of his own. Therein he acknowledged not only his own want of Jurisdiction over Bromfield Priory, but that the Prior was not obliged to find him procurations except as a matter of favour. This I learn from the valuable annota tions of the editor of Bishop Swinfield's Household Roll (Vol. II, p. clxxxviii, note). From the same source I conclude that Henry II' s Charter to Bromfield must have passed within the first nine years of his reign ; for Bishop Foliot, who thus indorsed it, was translated to London 15 Monasticon, IV, 155, Num. ii. I find another Charter of Henry II, to Bromfield Priory ; \u2014 inspected and con firmed by his Grandson Hem-y III, and transcribed on the Shropshire Forest-Roll of 46 Hen. Ill, (m. 3 dorso). As regards the territory secured to the Monks, this Charter is not quite so full as the above ; but it gives them license to assart, and otherwise do as they pleased, with their own woods, and it specially takes their Bosc of Doddinghope out of Regard, the same \" having previously been within the bounds of the King's Forest.\" This Char ter is attested by T. Chancellor, that is by Thomas a Becket. It passed therefore (see Vol. I, p. 291), between 1155 and in 1163. ' 1158."], [248, "212 BROMFIELD. the life-tenures of the existing Canons, as aforesaid. After the deaths of these Canons the prebendal lands were to revert to the proper uses and demesne of the said Chapel and the Brethren there, with all franchises, quittances, free-customs, and royal dignities. Wit nesses, \u2014 Hyllary Bishop of Chichester, Reginald Earl of Cornwall, William Earl of Gloucester, and Richard de Humez Constable (of Normandy) . \u2014 Dated at London. This Charter of King Henry II names four Canons of Bromfield, and intimates that there were other Canons (unnamed) in a similar position, viz. as having held or still holding Prebends in Bromfeld Hurnisse, either in the time of King Henry I, or of King Henry II himself. The Canons named are \u2014 Frethericus clericus de Bureford, i.e. Frederick de Burford, Clerk. Robertus Calemon de Pontesbyr, i.e. Robert Calemon of Ponts bury. Edricus presbyter de Bromfield, i. e. Edric de Bromfield, Priest. Robertus presbyter de Feltune, i.e. Robert de Felton, Priest. The expression Bromfeld Hurnisse17 is interpreted by the Charter itself. It meant \" all the lands and vills of Haverford (Halford), and of Dudingehope (Dinchope), and of E ffor d (Ashford18), and of Feltune (Rye Felton and Clay Felton), and of Burg eheye (Burway), and of Lethewic (Lower Ledwich), and three Prebends in Bromfield, and three Prebends in Habntone (Hill-Halton, Lady-Halton, and Priors- Halton) . A subsequent Charter, or rather Precept, was issued by King Henry II in favour of the \" Prior and Monks of his Church of St. Mary of Bromfeld.\" The attestation of Geoffrey Bishop of Ely, fixes the date of this Charter as between 1174 and 1 189. It enjoins that the said Prior and Monks shall have free aud peaceable power of venei-y19 in their Bosc of Mouhtre (Mocktree) and the Bosc of Ailricheswude, viz. from Whitebroc as far as the fount of Werebroc, and in their Bosc of Kanerwude and of Dudingehope, and in their Bosc of Esrugge, viz. from Eilsichewey even into Ludeford, along the road called the Rugwey.

To some of the localities here indicated I shall have to revert in the sequel. At present I follow the main but disjointed History of the Priory itself. In 1188 I find it designated as the \"little Cell of Bramfeld,\" by Giraldus the Historian, who passed hereby in company with Archbishop Baldwin, after preaching the Crusade in the West.20 In 1203 and 1208 Elias Prior of Bromfield occurs in some law proceedings which I shall detail hereafter. At the Gloucester Assizes of 1221 the Abbot of Gloucester was suing William Falconer and others in a plea of pasture. It appears that William Falconer represented the joint communities of Ludlow and Stanton Lacy, the real Defendants in this suit. It was ad journed, the men of Ludlow making Ralph Aurifaber their Attorney, and the men of Stanton naming Robert de Stanton as theirs. It is obvious that the interests in dispute were those of Bromfield Priory. A Patent of May 26, 1228, expresses the King's assent to the election of Henry, late Prior of Bromfeld, as Abbot of Gloucester. On July 16, 1235, King Henry III inspected and confirmed the two Charters of his Grandfather above described.21 The Prior and Convent of Bromfield paid 100s. for this confirmation.22 In 1243 we have an instance of the subject condition of this Priory ; for the Abbot of Gloucester endeavours by suit-at-law to re gain certain lands in Bromfield, on the ground that Elyas, former Prior of Bromfield, had demised the same without consulting the Chapter of Gloucester. The Munslow Inquisition of 1255 says that the Prior of Bromfeld claimed to have certain franchises in Brom feld. He had gallows, held pleas of blood-shed, and hue and cry ; he assized beer, and tried local causes under a ivrit de recto?3 On January 18, 1257, the Prior of Bromfield has the King's letters of protection for ten years. At the Assizes of 1292 the Munslow Jurors presented the Prior as claiming Free- Warren in Bromfield. The Prior defended his right under Henry II's Charter, which Charter was also taken to imply a right of Infangthef; \u2014 and it was 20 Giraldus Cambrensis, Liber II, Cap. xiii.

I refer elsewhere for the names of some of the last Priors of Bromfeld,34 as also for a proof that its subjection to Gloucester Abbey continued till the Dissolution, and how its possessions were then disposed of.25 Bromfield Manor. \u2014 Something should be said generally of the Manor and such of its members as were usually held in demesne by the Monks. It is impossible to enumerate all these members with certainty, but Burway, Clay-Felton, Rye Felton, Whitbatch, Hal ford, and Dinchope, were surely of the number ; whilst Priors Halton, Lady-Halton, and places called Chapel and Ashford, were less positively so. Of members abenated by early feoffment, I shaU speak separately hereafter. I here give first an instance of feoff ment hardly amounting to alienation. \u2014 In Hilary Term 1243 the Abbot of Gloucester commenced the suit above alluded to, viz. against Robert de Wudeton, for 30 acres of arable land and 10 acres of bosc in Bromfeud, which the Abbot alleged to have been unlawfully demised by a former Prior of Brom field to WilUam de Wudeton the Defendant's Father. Robert de Wudeton' s defence was that the premises were in Wudeton, \u2014 a manor which he (Robert) held under Walter de Lacy (meaning Walter de Lacy's heirs) ?e The Fine which resulted left Robert de Wudeton Tenant-in-fee of the premises, paying a rent of 3s. to the Abbot. The other particulars I have given under Onibury.27 In 1255 the Prior of Bromfeud is said in the Munslow Inquest to hold the vill of Bromfeud with its appurtenances, of the frank almoign of King Henry II. This tenure was estimated at five hides, and the Prior did no Suit either to County or Hundred for the same, having, as was alleged, a chartered franchise.28 The Feodary of 1284 gives the Prior as holding the Manor of Bromfeld with its members, of the King in capite, but by unknown services. The Taxation of 1291 gives the following estimate of the Prior of Bromfield's income as Lord of this Manor, and as holding much of it in demesne. \u2014 Eight carucates of land yielded \u00a34. per annum. The hay (ten loads at Is. 6c?.) was worth 15s. The assized rents and tallage of natives amounted to =\u20ac22. 13s. 4d.

A few items came from external sources, but I shall include them here, both for the sake of compression and because the non-existence of any Brom field Chartulary prevents my tracing the external acquisitions of the Priory to their sources, \u2014 an investigation which, could it have been pursued, might have added something to the history of the other places in question.

I know not whether the Priory-Church was distinct from the Parish-Church, but suppose that it was. The Parish of Bromfield was evidently one of Saxon origin, involving Ludford, and all the modern Parish of Ludford, also Halford and its Parish, and we know not what more beside. Bishop Swinfield, in his Visitation of 1290, was at Bromfield on April 26. He received nothing in the name of Procuration from the Prior of Bromfield, whose peculiar privileges exempted him from any such dues. Forage for the horses of the Bishop's Suite was however provided by the Prior as a gift. Swinfield's other expenses on this day were \u00a31. 19s. 3\\d., and he paid them himself.38 The Taxation of 1291 puts down the Church of Brompfield (in the Deanery of Ludlow) as the Prior's own, that is, the Prior was Rector. His income in that respect was \u00a323. 6s. 8c?. Besides this the Parish Church furnished a Vicar's portion of less than \u00a34., and a portion to the Prior of Wenlock of \u00a31.39 33 Sheet, Steventon, and Lower Ledwich, named in Henry II's Charter.

In the assessment of 1341 the Taxation of Bromfield Church is erroneously and unaccountably quoted as 26^ merks, i.e. \u00a317. 13s. 4d. The assessment of the Parish purporting to be grounded on this Taxation, exposes but does not correct the error. The Assessors rated the Parish at \u00a39. to the Ninth of wheat, wool, aud lamb, ad ding that they had considered the non- cultivation of 4 carucates of land in the Parish ; also that the Glebe was worth \u00a310., the hay tithes worth \u00a31., the small tithes, offerings, and profits \u00a33.40 Such an estimate was more probably founded on the real taxation of the Church (about \u00a328. 6s. 8c?.) than on the ostended one of \u00a317. 13s. 4c?. The Value of the Rectory of Bromfield in 1534-5 has already been given in effect, or may be gathered from the account of the Prior's Tithes. A Pension of \u00a31 . thereon was still payable to Wen lock Priory. The Bishop of Hereford was now avowedly entitled to Procurations at his triennial visitation of this Church, \u2014 a charge averaging \u00a31. 11s. ld. per annum. Also the Archdeacon of Salop had 6s. 8c?. annually for his Procurations. Further the Prior is said to pay an annual pension of \u00a32. 13s. 4c?. to the Perpetual Vicar of Bromfelde for his table?1 The Valuation of the Vicarage (then held by John Tylar) takes no notice of this last receipt, but states the Vicar's income from tithes to be \u00a36. 10s. only ; \u2014 which sum was burdened by procura tions of 6s. 8c?., and Bishop's Visitation-fees at the rate of 17s. 9c?. per annum ; \u2014 leaving the Vicar's net income as \u00a35. 5s. 7c?.42 EARLY INCUMBENTS.

Simon Gernun, whom I shall presently show attesting a Bromfield Charter of the twelfth Century, was, I think, Lord of this place, and Father of the person usually called Robert fitz Simon, of whom I have further particulars. \u2014 The King's Justices, in the Autumn of 1203, visited Shrews bury, Worcester, Gloucester, and Oxford, in succession. At each place some steps were taken in a double suit wherein Elyas, Prior of Bromfield, and Robert fitz Simon were the Litigants. The Prior sued the Layman under a plea of fine levied, and under a plea of land. The particulars of the latter only are given. It was for half a hide of land in Bromfield which the Prior claimed to hold of the King in frank almoign as the right of his Church of Bromfield.43 The result at Oxford was that Robert fitz Simon put himself on a Grand Assize, which was to say who had the better right, he or the Prior. This caused an adjournment to the next Eyre in Shrop shire.43 That was in November 1208, when Ralph de Ardern and his associates visited the County. Their general proceedings are not extant, but their Fines are. The recognition of Grand Assize above mentioned was thus terminated. \u2014 The Prior allowed the right of Robert fitz Simon (Tenant) to the said half hide ; \u2014 to hold to him and his heirs, of the capital Lord. He however and his heirs were to pay the Prior and his Successors one pound of frankincense yearly at the Nativity of the Virgin, in quittance of all claims of the said Prior and his Successors. I should observe that the Capital Lord above alluded to was not the Prior, but evidently the Lord holding immediately over Robert fitz Simon, and so holding medi ately between him and the Prior. Who this Mesne Lord was at the time, I cannot say, but we shall presently discover evidence that the subiufeudatious so common at the time, had been introduced on these estates of the Church. Simon's Bromfield was so called, I presume, from Simon the father of Robert fitz Simon.

This having been done, it was further ordered that the Perambulation should be embodied in a Chyrograph, and that the Litigants should attend to receive their counterparts of the said Chyrograph when the Justices in Eyre next visited Shrop shire. The reason of the delay was because \" there were many Lords iu the Vills where the disputed lands lay, and it would thus appear whether the said Lords were willing to sink (apponere) their claims or not.\" I suppose the rriain question here to have been one of boundary between Walton and Onibury on the one hand, and Simon's Brom field on the other, but that there were contingent interests to be guarded. Hugh de Bromfield, of whom I find no other mention, was I presume Lord of Simon's Bromfield, but how related to Ro bert fitz Simon I cannot say. Probably he was a Gernon. Robert fitz Simon seems to have been represented in 1255 by one Walter Gernum, whom the Munslow Jurors reported to be then holding half a hide of land in Simon's-Bromfeud of Henry de Fraxino. Walter de Gernon did suit to Munslow Hundred, and paid the King 6d. annually for stretward and motfee?4. Thus we see that lands which, except by a nominal rent were alienated from the Church, lost their original privileges. In this case the suit and service originally due at the Prior's Court at Bromfield were exacted elsewhere, and in other forms. In 1284 the representative of Wal ter de Gernon in Bromfeld parva, as it is called, was William fitz Hugh. He held the vill for the eighth part of a knight's-fee under Hugh de Freyne {i: e. Fraxino), and Hugh held it under Emfred {i. e. Humphrey) de Bohun. Emfred de Bohun is further said to hold it of the King,45 \u2014 so completely had the mesne-interest of Brom field Priory been effaced. By Emfred de Bohun I presume we must understand the cotemporary Earl of Hereford. How the Bohuns obtained an interest here is another question. The family of Du Fresne, or De Fraxino, held largely under the Bohuns elsewhere. It would seem that the Tenant of a small Manor or Vill, though he might succeed in getting rid of one Seigneural Lord, was by law, custom, or his own interest, obliged to adopt another, and in re spect of that particular holding. Such a power or necessity is often alluded to in Domesday, but I have found no declared instance of its exercise in later records. But to continue. \u2014 William fitz Hugh, of Bromfield, was at the Assizes of 1292 one of the two Munslow Jurors who had to elect their fellows. In 1300 one Roger de Brom- 44 Rot. Hundred.

The latter Vill had somehow been regained by the Priory, but I do not know that even its situation can now be traced. West Halton, now Little Halton. \u2014 The following Deed ex hibits an early Lord of Halton, not I think holding under the Prior of Bromfield, but in some other way of which we have no evidence. \u2014 Robert son of Radulf de Halenctune, with the assent of his heirs, and for the souls' health of himself, his ancestors and successors, gives in pure almoign to the Church of St. Mary of Bromfelde, and to the Prior and Monks thereof, all his share in the Moor of Wuln roughale, viz. that part which lies between the old foss and the bank of Hemedg (or Nemedg).

This Deed I can only judge from its writing to have passed at the close of the twelfth Century. In or about 1210 a second Ralph de Halton seems, from what I shall have to say under Wofferton, to have succeeded to the estates of his family. Adam de Halton was Lord of this Vill as well as of Oakley in 1221. His position seems to have been like that of his neighbour at Simon's Bromfield. He was to all appearance independent of the Prior. What feudal obligations he was under instead, must be gathered from the sequel. In November 1221 a suit of mort d'ancestre which William Ger- nun had against Adam de Halcgton for a half virgate in Halegton, resulted in a Fine. \u2014 William renounced his claim, and Adam in re- turn gave and conceded to William 16 acres of the premises,48 to hold in fee, of the Grantor, at a rent of 20c?. in lieu of all, except forinsec, services.48 The successor of Adam de Halton was a second Robert de Halton, Rot.

Soon afterwards Robert de Halton enfeoffed his son Simon, both in West Halton and in Oakley. In 1254 I find Simon de Haleweton fining 20s. for some Writ. In 1255 Simon de Alton appears as a Juror on the Inquest of Munslow Hundred, and, as Simon de Halton, is said to hold West Halhton of Robert his Father. The tenure was half a hide of land. Simon did suit to Munslow Hundred, and paid the King 6c?. an nually for stretward and motfee?^ At the Assizes of January 1256, Simon de Alton was again a Munslow Juror. At these Assizes Margery, apparently Simon's Sister, but only called daughter of Robert cle Halton, sued Robert de Halton (I suppose her own father) for disseizing her of a tene ment in Halton, viz. 15 acres and a curtilage. Her suit failed, but she being under age, her amercement was excused.50 Six months later and Robert de Halton was dead ; for on July 26, 1256, a Patent orders trial of a suit of mort d'ancestre which Ste phen Drak had against Simon de Halucton and Johanna widow of Robert de Halucton, for half a knight's-fee in Halucton. In August 1257 I find Robert Dovill and his wife suing Simon de Haluton for disseizing them of a tenement in Haluton. In the same year Simon de Haleghton was one of twelve Jurors who fined 40s. in atonement of some trespass or wrong, done by themselves. In 1259 Simon de Halton was on the Inquest held on decease of William de Stuteville. At the Assizes of 1272 Simon de Hakinton, as he is called, was one of the two who chose their fellow Jurors for Munslow Hundred. The Feodary of 1284 gives Simon de Halaton as holding the vills of Halaton and Okeleye for half a knight's-fee of Edmund de Mortimer, who held them of the King.51 How Mortimer of Wig more obtained ingress here is much the same question as De Bohun's ingress in Simon's-Bromfield. The following notices relate probably to Halton's Undertenants here. \u2014 In 1255 Hugh de Halton was a Defaulter in attendance at the Munslow Inquest.52 In Michaelmas Term 1269, Nicholas Orm is suing William de Corfton for a moiety of 24 acres in Halcton.

Again the same Plaintiffs together with Agnes daughter of Thomas de la Chapele, renounce for two merks, their claim against William fitz Milo for 5 acres in Overton.54 Their renunciation was to bind themselves and the heirs of Alice and Agnes, \u2014 probably sisters and coheiresses. Hill Halton. \u2014 I suppose it was this place which, under the name of La Hull, was affected by the following Fines, but under whom the parties held I cannot say. On July 1, 1302, Nicholas de Rigate, Deforciant, surrenders a messuage, 69 acres of land, 1 acre of meadow, and 4 acres of Bosc in La Hull juxta Bromfield, to WilUam de la Hulle and Alice his wife, whereof was plea of convention. The Plaintiffs pay \u00a320. and are in future to hold the premises under the Lords of the Fee. In Easter Term, 1305, John de Horsned and Constancia his wife, and Hugh Body and Alianore his wife, for themselves and the heirs of Constancia and Alianore, concede to the same WilUam and Alice, Plaintiffs, two MiUs in La Hull for 100s., \u2014 whereof was Plea of Convention.55 Oakley. \u2014 The Haltons held Oakley, as I have already intimated under West Halton. Their tenure of the two is distinguished in the Munslow Inquisition of 1255, merely by Acley being stated to contain a quarter of a hide, and consequently to pay 3d. for Stret ward and Motfee. Its tenure by Simon de Halton under his father Robert, and his obligation to do suit to Munslow Hundred, are the same as at West Halton. What I have else to say of Oakley chiefly concerns Halton's Undertenants there. One of these, Pagan de Acley, has occurred 53 Placita, 53 Hen. Ill, memb. 1. from, Hulle near Burford. The coinci dence of his having property in two places of the same name, was perhaps the reason why those places are distinguished in two Fines, as \" Hulle near Bromfield,\" and \" Hulle near Hyntes\" (Vide supra, Vol. IV, p. 345). The second of the Fines, quoted above in the text, inarks no such distinction, and consequently there may be a question as to which Hulle was the place concerned. 54 Pedes Finium, 56 Hen. Ill, Salop.

The same or another Pagan de Acle sued Adam de Halton in 1221 for dis seizing him of com mon- pasture in Acle. He was non-suited, and Roger de Buterley stood Surety for his amercement.66 In 1228 Pagan de Acle fines for license to accord some law-suit. His successor seems to have been Adam de Oakley, who was de ceased before May 1259, when Richard son of Adam de Oclee, takes out a Writ of mort d'ancestre against Simon de Halton for a tenement in Oclee.57 The result is not recorded, but we find the same Richard fitz Adam taking out similar Writs in November 1259, and February 1261.58 Again in Easter Term 1260, Geva, widow of Adam de Okeley, sues Simon de Halton for her dower, viz. a third of a messuage and 7 acres in Okeley. Simon pleaded that the deceased was his Vil lain, but the Jury found him to have been a Free Tenant. So Geva recovered her dower.59 Burway. \u2014 In 1194 Richard de. Patesbi had a suit with Robert the Prior and the Convent of Brunfeld for a virgate in Burgeia. In the Curia Regis he acknowledged the said virgate to be the pure and free almoign of the Church of St. Mary ; for which quit-claim the Prior undertook to pay the said Richard an annuity of 4 merks for life, but on his death the Prior was to have the premises quit of all obligation. The Prior of Bromfield took the unusual precaution of having this Quit-claim recorded on the Great Roll; for which privilege he paid 1 merk to the Crown. At the foot of the Shropshire Pipe-Roll of the sixth year of Richard I, the Memorandum is still to be seen. Possibly Henry MUe, who, sooner or later than this, attests the Deed given under West Halton, was a Tenant in Burway. Again Henry Mile of Ludlow, a Juror for Munslow Hundred at the In quest of 1255, and the Assizes of 1256, was so, I think, in respect of a feoffment in Burway, but under whom he held I cannot say.

The above Table indicates but one part of an undoubted fact, viz. that the Domesday boundaries between Herefordshire and Shropshire have been to a great extent altered. Shropshire, at the time of Domesday, contained several Manors which are now in Herefordshire ; \u2014 but of that elsewhere. Conversely, we see from the above Table that parts of a district which Domesday places in the Herefordshire Hundred of Cutestornes are now in Shropshire. It is the latter district which I now propose to survey according to the plan indicated by the said Table. I should observe however that though Ludford appears on the Table, it is not thereby sug gested that Ludford has ever been included in Shropshire. Men tion of the place was necessary to a synoptical view of the subject before us, and must frequently occur in connection with the de tails on which I now propose to enter. ktcijarti^Castle, formerly <Mxtt<mt* The Castle, thus named from Richard Scrupe its Founder, was in Herefordshire, where also the Vill of Richard's Castle still re mains. But the greater part of the territory once attached to this Castle, is now in Shropshire, and to introduce any intelligible notice thereof I must first say something of the whole Lordship. It is thus noticed in two passages of the Domesday Survey.\u2014 After Ludeforde (held by Osbern fitz Richard and placed in Cutestornes Hundred) the Record says, \u2014 \" The same Osbern has xxm men in Castle-Auretone, and they pay (him) 10s. This Castle is worth to him 20s. {per annum).\"1 I suppose some little territory was annexed to the Castle at the time, and the garrison ferrned half thereof. Another passage ofthe Herefordshire Domesday gives as \"the land of Robert Gernon, Larpol, in Ulfei Hundred.\" Robert Gernon 1 Domesday, so. 186, b, 2, 31 V."], [266, "226 honour of Richard's castle. held it of the King. Richard Scrupe had held it in Saxon times. It was in hides. (The later name of this place is Yarpole.) Then follows, under Cutestom Hundred, this entry, \u2014 \" The same Robert (Gernon) holds five and a half hides in the Chatellany {castellarid) of Auretone. Richard held it (in Saxon times). This land is not geldable. In demesne there are v ox-teams, and there are xxxim Villains, vi Boors and a Smith, with xv ox-teams among them all, aud they pay 20s. {per annum). Here are x Serfs and a Mill ren dering four measures {modios) of corn {annon\u00e6) and xv sticks of Eels. The value in time of King Edward, and since, and now, was and is \u00a37.\"2 It is clear to me that the Richard here mentioned as owner of the Chatellany in Saxon times was Richard Scrupe. Of Robert Gernon all that I have further to say is that he held of the King 13 Manors in Hertfordshire, 9 in Cambridgeshire, 2 in Middlesex, aud 1 in Buckinghamshire, but that after Domesday we never hear of him in connection with Herefordshire. It is difficult to account for his tenure of Larpole aud the Chatellany of Auretone, because, at the period of Domesday, Osbern, the son and heir of Richard Scrupe, was under no forfeiture, but generally stood in succession to his Father's Manors. Certain however it is that both Yarpole and the Chatellany of Auretone returned to Osbern fitz Richard or his heirs, and that the name of their original owner was revived. The whole district was in fact caUed The Honour of Richard's Castle, a term which must be taken to include whatever land was attached to the Castle itself at Domesday and already in the hands of Osbern fitz Richard or his men. The next account which I have of this district speaks only of the Herefordshire part thereof. That, in 1243, was reputed to be three hides. John Esturmi, Richard de Kinardesley, and Jordan de Lude ford, were enfeoffed therein, their services being a half, a fourth, aud a fourth, of a Knight's-fee respectively.3 These feoffments had been granted by Robert de Mortimer, and therefore before 1220. I now turn to the Shropshire constituent of the Honour of Ri chard's Castle. This, in 1255, contained five hides, four of which were then in the hands of seven distinct Feoffees. The fifth hide, Wol lerton, was held by Sir William de Stutevill, in demesne. The five 2 Domesday, so. 185, a, 2 . 3 Testa de Nevill, pp. 66-68.

He did Suit to neither County or Hundred, but of the ground of his exemption they were equaUy ignorant.1 Connecting this with what Domesday had said about 5 \u00a3 hides inthe Chatellany of Auretone not being geldable, the coincidence is striking, and perhaps we are informed why the Domesday notice of Osbern fitz Richard's interest in the residue was so meagre. Some prescriptive independence may have preserved the full details from the scrutiny of the Commissioners. At the Assizes of 1292 the Munslow Jurors reported that Hugh son and heir of Robert de Mortimer, being then a Minor and in Custody of the Earl of Warwick, claimed free-warren in Wolferton. I now proceed to give account ofthe several Vills or Estates which formed the Shropshire part of the Honour of Richard's Castle. \u2014 Woolverton, Wollerton, or Woofferton, already mentioned, retains something of its ancient status ; for though in the Shrop shire Hundred of Munslow, it is in the Herefordshire Parish of Richard's Castle. A Feodary of the Honour of Richard's Castle, drawn up about 1210 gives Ralph de Halictone as holding one-twentieth of a fee thereof.6 This was in Woolverton; for a later Feodary (about 1230) gives Robert de Halton as holding the same twentieth in Wolfer ton? Also at the latter period Pagan Carbonel held another part of Wolverton by one fourth part of a fee. De Halton's Feoffment here seems afterwards to have reverted to the Seignoral Lord, but Carbonel's continued ; so that, from the Hundred- Roll of 1255, we must not conclude that all Woolerton was in the demesne of William de Stuteville. The Feodary of 1284 gives WilUam Carbonel as holding \\ fee of Robert de Mortimer in the Vill of Wolferton, which Vill Mortimer held in capite for a whole Fee.7 And again, on Robert de Mortimer's death in 1287, William Carbonel held a carucate in Wulferton, of 10s. annual value, for one-fourth of a Knight's-Fee.8 So also in 1304 an In quest states William Carbonel's chief-rent for Wulfreton to be 1.2c?. and Ranulph Carbonel's lc?.,9 and another Inquest, in 1308, makes William Carbonell Tenant of i fee in Wolferton.10 Those whom I s Inquisitions, 15 Edw.

At the Assizes of 1221 Edith, as daughter and heir of Robert de Wulfretou, sued Pagan Carbonell for a virgate in Wulfreton under Writ of mort d'ancestre. The Defendant got judgment on the grounds that he was not Tenant of the whole premises, \u2014 having enfeoffed two Undertenants, viz. Pagan de Wulfreton and Ralph Goldsmith (.4m rifuber) in a few acres thereof.11 By a subsequent Fine he con ceded two-thirds of the virgate to the Plaintiff, \u2014 to hold in Fee, for 4s. rent. The Capital Messuage and remaining third were to con tinue his, but he gave another messuage in the vill, in lieu of the capital messuage, and covered by the reserved rent. It appears that Ralph Goldsmith thus occurring, sold a messuage and noke in Wol ferton to Richard fitz Roese, which Richard, his first wife Matilda being dead, was married at the time of this purchase to a second wife Hillaria, who was jointly enfeoffed, by the Charter of the Ven dor. Hillaria had a daughter Sibil, who became wife of Adam Berde, and these two, together with one William le Tayllur, were holding the premises in 1256. Then Richard de Brumfeud, as son and heir of Richard fitz Roese, sued these Tenants under writ of mort d'ancestre; but it was shown that he was son of Richard fitz Roese by his first wife Matilda, whose issue had no place in the deed of feoffment. It is difficult to see why so clear a case should have induced Adam and Sibil Berde to fine half a merk pro licen tid concordandi, and to concede half the premises to Richard son of Richard de Bromfeld (as he is caUed in the Fine) at a penny rent.13 At these same Assizes John sou of Ralph de Huntington, sues John de Wlfreton for a virgate in Wlfreton, but the case was adjourned to Westminster.13 By a Fine of Michaelmas Term 1292 John de Horsened and Con stancia his wife, give a messuage and 7 acres in Wulferton to Ranulf Carbonel for 7 merks.

The premises are to remain to the heirs of Alice. For this Quit-claioi the Recognizor received 28s. The Mesne-Lord of Ashford at this time, or rather later, was Henry de Boulers, whom the oft-quoted Feodary of about 1230 gives as hold ing Esford by one-fourth of a Knight's-Fee of the Honour of Ri chard's Castle. The Feodary of 1240 ascribes the same tenure to Henry de Bodleys.16 Again in 1255 Henry de Budlers is stated to hold i hide in Asford BuUers of the same Honour.17 At the Assizes of 1272 Robert de Boudlers was sued in vain by John le Fevere and others, who, holding tenements in Asford CarboneU, pretended to a right of common in Asford Boudlers.18 Previous to these Assizes, but in the same year, Peter de Grete had taken out two writs, one against Robert de Boliers for disseizin in Esford Boliers and Wiser ton, the other against the same Robert de Bulers and Emma his wife for disseizin in Asford. The case actually tried at the Assizes was for a messuage and 16 acres in Asheford Boulers and Wolferton. The Defendants' only plea was that five of the said acres were in Overton. They lost the cause.19 In 1284 we have Robert de Boulers holding the vill of Asford for J fee of Robert de Mortimer; and the same statement is repeated on the death of Mortimer in 1287, only that the tenure is styled a Manor, and extended as of \u00a34. an nual value.20 A Richard's-Castle Feodary, taken in April 1308, makes John de Boudlers Tenant of a \\ fee in Asford Budlers.21 overton.

Dugdale thinks he was deceased in 13 John (1211-2), but was eventually succeeded by another Henry, his son. If so, the latter is he whom a Ri chard's-Castle Feodary (of about 1230) represents as holding half a knight's-fee in Overton and HuUe.2i In October 1227 W'alter fitz Odo, claimant of a virgate in Hovertun under writ of mort d'an cestre, renounces his right to Henry Hubaud, Tenant thereof, for two merks.25 Of Walter fitz Odo we have aUeady heard under Ash ford Jones. Henry Hubouth was holding a knight's-fee at Ipsley, in Warwickshire, in 1236 ;26 and Henry Hubaut was holding half a fee at Hulle, in Shropshire, in 1240,27 both of the Barony of Ri chard's Castle. Again in 1252 one Henry Hubald was Lord of Ipsley, while the Hundred-Roll of 1255 gives Henry Hubaud as holding lj hides in Overton and Hulle.2S Dugdale shows Henry Hubaud as in rebellion in 1265-6, and as suffering forfeiture of his Warwickshire estates. A Charter of King Henry III, dated Jan uary 20, 1266, grants the estates of several Shropshire Rebels to Matilda wife of Roger de Mortimer of Wigmore. Among others Hulle is thus bestowed ; but the owner deprived thereof is said to be William (not Henry) Hubaud.29 If this is correct, WilUam was perhaps Undertenant to Henry, at Hulle, and shared in his rebellion. Dugdale gives further facts about Henry Hubaud, who, he says, died in 15 Edw. I (1286-7). Our Shropshire Feodary of 1284 gives Henry Hubaud as holding the vill of Hulle, and half the vill of Overton for half a knight's-fee under Robert de Mortimer.

In August 1290 however, a Jury of Knights, assembled at Kidder minster, declared that Henry Hubaud (then deceased) had not held Ippele of Robert de Mortimer's heir, but under John de Hastings,31 who in fact was Mesne- Lord. The King probably lost the wardship of Henry Hubaud's heir by this Verdict, but I need not pursue a subject which at this point ceases to be connected with Shropshire. Overton's Fee. \u2014 The other part of Overton was a fourth part of a Knight's-fee held by Robert de Overtone in or about 1210,32 and by the same in or about 1230,32 and in 1240. 32 In 1255 this tene ment was stated to be three parts of a hide, and Richard de Overton was Tenant.33 This Richard was a Juror on the Inquest of 1259, after the death of WilUam de StuteviU. At the Assizes of 1267 Richard son of Richard de Overton sued Henry fitz Philip and Nesta his wife for disseizing him of a messuage and four acres in Overton, but it was shown that the whole matter had already been sifted in the Court of Sir Hugh de Mortimer (the Suzerain) ; and so the Defendants had judgment in their favour.34 The Inquisition of 1287 gives John de Overton as Tenant of the vill of Overton under Robert de Mortimer, deceased, \u2014 by J fee. The tenement was valued at 40s. per annum?5 So too an Inquest of April 1308 gives John de Overton as holding J fee in Overton in that part of the Richard's Castle Barony which had been aUotted to Thomas de Bikenore and Johanna his wife.36 Of Undertenants in Overton I notice that in Michaelmas Term 1232 Pama widow of Hugh de Overton sued Robert de Overtoil for dower, \u2014 viz. a third of 32 acres. Robert asserted Hugh to have been his Villain, and so the cause was referred back to a local Jury.37 In Michaelmas Term 1 250 Agnes fitz William sues Rese de Over ton and Agnes his wife for 66 acres in Overton.

Agnes asserted that she obtained the premises as heir of her Mother Juliana, but the Jury found otherwise.39 On Nov. 18, 1290, a Fine was levied between John de Bradeford (Plaintiff), and Gilbert le Corvisur and Agnes his wife (Impedients), of 9 acres in Ludford (Herefordshire), and a messuage and 4 acres in Overton juxta Richard's Castle (Salop). Gilbert and Agnes recognized the Plaintiff's right as by their own gift, and they and the heirs of Agnes would warrant the same.40 Batchcott. \u2014 I know nothing more of this member of the Fran chalimot of Wollerton than that in 1255 it was held by Geoffrey Leky and WiUiam de la Hulle under WiUiam de StuteviU. With two other v ills now to be mentioned, it formed a hide of land.41 Mora, one of these vills, is now represented by Moor Park. WilUam de Bachecot held it in 1255.41 Whitebroc, the other of these vills, I cannot now trace. At the Assizes of 1221 Ralph fitz Roger sued the Master of the Hos pital of Richard's Castle for an acre in Wydibroc of which his Fa ther had died seized. The Master produced Ralph's own Charter granting him the land, since his Father's death. But Ralph, it was proved, was under age, both when the charter was drawn up, and now. So the Court ordered the Charter to be destroyed {carta frangatur) and the Prior (read Master) was in misericordid?2 In 1255, Walter Hakelutel was WiUiam de StuteviU's Tenant of Whitebroc.4-3 At the Assizes of 1256, the Jurors of Munslow Hun dred reported Walter Hakelutel as non-attendant on the proper day. At the Assizes of 1272 David de la Grene and Amelina his wife withdrew a suit of mort d'ancestre which they had against Walter Hachletel about a messuage and 3 acres in Wythebrok.44 The same David and Amelina gave half a merk for license to accord with Giles Hachletel about half a virgate (except a messuage and 3 acres) in Withebrok. Their Fine, which is preserved, purports to be the conclusion of a suit of mort d'ancestre. David and Amelina, the Demandants, renounce their claim to GUes HakeUtel for 40s. 38 Placita, Mich.

TuRFoq^ \u2014 I cannot trace the Vill which bore this name, but I think it must have been in the Shropshire part of the Manor of Richard's Castle, that is, in the Franchalimot of Wollerton. Some early Lord of Richard's Castle seems to have given this Vill to the Templars, and they to have transferred it to the Hospitallers of Dinmore. At the Assizes of October 1227, David and John de Turford (ap parently Tenants here), were amerced half a merk for not producing one for whom they were Sureties. The Sheriff of Shropshire re ceived the amercement, but handed it over to the Knights Templars, by reason of their Franchise under Royal Charter?5 The Munslow Jurors at the Inquest of 1255, after enumerating the several Vills of the Franchalimot of Wollerton, pass to the ham let of Turford which they said was held by the Hospitallers of Dune mor \"by grant of the ancient Lords of Richard's Castle.\" The place contained 2^ virgates and did no suit either to County or Hundred.46 This tenure had existed from a period anterior to all memory {a tempore unde nemo recolit),46 which accounts for these Jurors representing the Hospitallers as the original Grantees. iUttiicito, A reference to the Map wUl show that a series of Domesday Manors, akeady identified and described, did, with their members, form an irregular but continuous circle round the site of the Town of Ludlow. Bromfield, Stanton Lacy, Middleton- Higford, Henley, Lower Ledwich, Sheet, Steventon, and Ludford are the Manors to which I aUude. And now comes the question, \u2014 Where is Ludlow itself? Ludlow, a place whose very name bespeaks antiquity, whose very stones teU of an existence almost if not quite as early as Domes day, where is Ludlow in that Record ?

The Chronicle of the Fitz Warins, says of Earl Roger de Bele healme (meaning Earl Roger de Montgomery) that \" he commenced a Castle at Brugge, and another Castle he commenced at Dynan ; but he finished them not.\"1 By Dynan the Writer means Ludlow, though he uses the name Dynan anachronously, that is twenty or thirty years before any cause of its being so named can have arisen. Now if Earl Roger de Montgomery commenced Ludlow Castle, it was commenced within eight years of Domesday, that is between 1086, when Domesday does not mention it, and 1094, when the Earl died or was dead. This date for the foundation of Ludlow Castle is exceedingly probable on many grounds ; but on the ground given, viz. that the foundation was the work of Earl Roger, it cannot be maintained. Earl Roger was not the Founder of Ludlow Castle, and the assertion of the Fitz-Warin Chronicle that he was, though it has obtained impUcit credence from the twelfth to the nineteenth century, is the chief reason why the probable truth of the matter has been uninvestigated. We may reject the assertion of the Fitz- Warin Chronicle on two specific grounds : first, the context of the Chronicle itself, next, the contradiction which it gives to the better evidence of Domesday. Earl Roger is said, in the context, to have \" begun but not to have finished a Castle at Brugge.\" If by Brugge is meant Bridgnorth, \u2014 and that is most likely to be the Writer's meaning, \u2014 we can prove that Earl Roger commenced no Castle there; if Quatford be meant, we know that whatever of Castle or fortified mansion he commenced there, he also finished. The evidence which Domesday furnishes in contradiction to the Fitz-Warin Chronicle is constructive, but complete. Earl Roger had no territory in Shropshire which can correspond in name or circumstances with Ludlow or Dynan. In Herefordshire he had nothing at all. Of the Shropshire and Herefordshire Manors which have been mentioned above, as encircling the site of Ludlow, Earl Roger had not one in demesne. He had the Seigneury of only three, and those insignificant. They were Middleton, Henley, and Ste venson ; and all three remained in the succession of their Domesday Lords, that is, were never resumed into the Palatine demesne. Earl Roger therefore did not found Ludlow Castle for two reasons ; \u2014 first, because the only authority which says that he did, is not to be 1 History of Fulk Fitz Wcnrine (Warton Club, 1855), p. 3."], [275, "LUDLOW CASTLE"], [276, ""], [277, "LUDLOW CASTLE. INTERIOR"], [278, ""], [279, "235 LUDLOW. believed in the matter ; secondly, because he had not au acre of land whereon to found it. Aud now, having no direct statement as to this foundation ex cept a false one, we must needs go to probabilities for a solution of the question\u2014 Who founded Ludlow Castle ? The argument con structed from Domesday is this. \u2014 The Lords of the surrounding lands were, the Canons of Bromfield, Helgot, William Pantulf, Rainald the Sheriff, Osbern fitz Richard, Ralph de Mortimer, and Roger de Lacy. The Canons are out of the question, as Castle- Founders ; \u2014 the three next had very inconsiderable interests in this quarter; \u2014 Osbern fitz Richard had a Castle near at hand already; \u2014 Mortimer had one not far off, at Wigmore. Roger de Lacy then remains as on this ground likely to have founded Ludlow Castle. Add that he had no other Castle in Shropshire, that Ludlow was environed on the North-west by his enormous Manor of Stanton, that his interest in the adjoining Hundred of Culvestan was equalled by no other, and the probability is increased. Add that Ludlow appears in course of time as the recognized inheritance of Roger de Lacy's successors, and the probability is still stronger. Now let us turn again to facts, and see if we cannot find Ludlow in Domesday, \u2014 find the centre of the territorial circle which I have described, as well as its circumference. \u2014 At the time when the Sur vey was taken, Herefordshire contained a Hundred called Cutestorn or Cutestornes. The bulk of this Hundred lay in a semicircle, West, North, and East of the City of Hereford ; but, like the Shropshire Hundred of Bascherch, Cutestornes Hundred had two distant de tachments. One of these, with which we have nothing here to do, lay in Ewias-land, but the other comprised the Chatellany of Aure tone (that is Richard's Castle), \u2014 and Ludford, \u2014 and a Manor of two hides called in the Record \" Lude.\" Now there were three Ludes in Cutestorn Hundred at Domesday. Two of them were held by Roger de Laci, in capite, and, from their position in the Record, I should judge, but cannot affirm, them to have been in that part of Cutestorn Hundred which was near to Hereford. Two places, afterwards distinguished as Lude Much gros and Lude Sancy, were in that quarter and were in Lacy's Fief. I therefore speak now of the third Lude only. This was in the de tached portion of Cutestorn Hundred, if we take the same test, \u2014 viz. that of position in the Record ; for below it and next to it we have a notice of Ludford, and below and next to that, a notice of Castle Auretone. In short we have these three places mentioned in Domes-"], [280, "236 LUDLOW. day exactly as we should read off their presumed representatives, Ludlow, Ludford, and Richard's Castle, on a modern Map. About this Lude, which I thus suppose to be the Ludlow of Domesday, that Record speaks as follows. \" The same Osbern (fitz Richard) holds (of the King) Lude, and Roger de Laci (holds it) of him. Saisi held it (in Saxon times) . Here are n hides geldable. In demesne there are n ox-teams and (there are) one Villain, a Bailiff {prepo situs), and a Smith, with n teams. The Manor was worth 25s. (per annum) in Saxon times. Now it is worth 30s.\"2 This im proved value of the Manor of Lude, coupled with the mention of a Provost and a Smith there, may not be enough to suggest the idea of an existent Borough or the intended residence of a great feudal Chief, but the ideas being suggested already, they are in strict har mony therewith. Lude then, identified in theory with Ludlow, I take further to have been the whole thereof; for Ludlow as a territory was never large. An objection which presents itself in limine to this new theory I must at once dispose of. If Osbern fitz Richard were Seignoral Lord of Lude, how are we to account for the Lords of Richard's Castle never appearing as Seignoral Lords of Ludlow? How, in other words, did Osbern fitz Richard lose the Seigneury ? The answer is, \u2014 possibly by exchange with his greater Feoffee; possibly by the law of might against right ; or possibly the Seigneury became effaced by will of the Crown, under which it was expedient that such a Fortress as Ludlow should be held immediately. But the negative proof is always the best in such cases. \u2014 Osbern fitz Richard was Seignoral Lord of a certain Lude in Herefordshire at Domesday. Osbern fitz Richard's successors never afterwards had such a Seigneury. They therefore lost such a Seigneury, and that loss cannot be accounted for in any better way than by supposing Lude to be Ludlow, held as it was by Lacy, \u2014 the only Tenant of Osbern fitz Richard who was more powerful than his Lord. It appears probable that Ludlow Castle, though non-existent at Domesday, was founded within the next ten years. And, supposing Roger de Laci to have been its Founder, two events happened in that same interval of ten years which will at once account for such an endeavour on his part to strengthen his position. In 1088, two years after Domesday, Roger de Lacy joined the English rebeUion against William Rufus and in favour of Courteheuse. Roger de Laci was the first to act in the West ; for he had already attacked 2 Domesday, so. 186, b, 2."], [281, "237 LUDLOW. Hereford, when, joined by Bernard de Newmarch and Ralph de Mortimer, and seconded by the aid and influence of Roger Earl of Shrewsbury, these three Chieftains threatened Worcester. Their defeat, and the probability that they suffered but little in estate for this treason, have been often aUuded to in these pages. It is to this combination between Roger de Lacy and the Earl of Shrewsbury that I attribute the Legend or idea which has made the Earl Foun der of Ludlow Castle. He may have prompted, he may have pro moted and assisted the work, but if so, it was only as a poUtical friend and partisan, not as having any jurisdiction in the matter. In 1095 Earl Roger was dead and Roger de Laci joined the second rebellion against Rufus, that of Robert de Mowbray. For this he was never forgiven ; he Uved and died in exile ; his English estates, or the greater part of them, being bestowed by the King on Hugh de Lacy, his brother.3 In identifying Ludlow with the Domesday Lude, I oblige myself to state an etymological opinion in which I shall have small sup port from former Writers. All authorities of any note have, I be- Ueve, interpreted the name Ludlow as Leobe-hl\u00e6p (Leode-hl\u00e6w), \u2014 the tumulus, grave, or hill of the people ; and Ludgate, London, has been plausibly (but perhaps erroneously)4 instanced as involving an analogous idea. But this notion falls to the ground directly that we find three places in Herefordshire named Lude ; \u2014 for Lude, if it means people, is senseless when used singly as the name of a place. The different ways in which the three Ludes were compounded, after Domesday, with other words, was to distinguish them from each other, \u2014 a special necessity, seeing that all three were in Lacy's Fief. Lude Muchgros and Lude-Sancy were so called from Lacy's Tenants there : Ludlow got its distinctive name from the low or tumulus which was a prominent feature of the town. Another no tion about the word Ludlow would derive it from Lud or Luda, a man's name ;5 but this too fails, because the name Lude, if it be that of a person, can never have stood in the nominative case for the name of a place. In short, some meaning must be found for Lude which in a non-composite form will indicate a locality. \u2014 3 Ordericus, p. 704, C. 4 I think the origin of Ludgate to have been Hhb-jear, a postern-door. 5 We shall hereafter 9ee the name Luda incorporated in a Ludlow Legend, \u2014 ap parently as the name of an Irish Saint; but the Legend was probably a fabrica- tion. Ludi was also a Saxon name. Such a person was Lord of Huntington in the Confessor's days (Vide Supra, p. 74). The same or a similar Saxon name seems to enter into composition, in cases like Ludston, Luddesdon, Luddington, etc."], [282, "238 LUDLOW. Twice already in these pages I have given instances where the word Lode stands in connection with a stream or river, and as I think, indicates a. ford? This idea will suit the locaUty under notice, and I shall suppose that the original vill was caUed Lude from some adjacent ford of the River Teme. It is true that no such word as Lude, signifying a ford, is to be found in the Saxon glossaries ; but then the word very possibly belonged to an older language than the Saxon, and its meaning was unknown to that people.7 This idea will account for another phenomenon. If Lude be a ford, then the name Ludford involves a redundancy; but I account for this in a very simple way. \u2014 I take Ludford to have been populated after the word Lude had become obsolete as meaning a ford, and was signi ficant only of a locality. To call a more recent vill Ludford, \u2014 that is to name it after a neighbouring vill and a neighbouring ford, \u2014 was natural, for in such a case the redundancy would be unfelt or dis regarded. I must now incorporate my further account of Ludlow with that of \u2014 THE BARONY OF DE LACY. Of Hugh de Lacy, whose loyalty and rectitude Ordericus con trasts with the conduct of his elder Brother Roger, little is known. He is reputed to have added, by Conquest, the land of Ewias to his original Fief.8 This must be taken with some qualification. \u2014 Lands in the Chatellany of Ewias had been granted to Walter de Lacy, father of Roger and Hugh, by WilUam fitz Osborn Earl of Hereford, and therefore before 1071. 9 Roger de Lacy had obtained other lands in the same province before Domesday. The best au thenticated instance of Hugh de Lacy's connection with Ewias-land is his Foundation therein of the famous Monastery of Lanthony. I refer to a Monkish Chronicle for a full account of particulars, and only observe that this so-called foundation of Hugh de Lacy was rather a great enrichment and extension of a previous monastic es tablishment, and that it was after the year 1108 ; \u2014 for that was the year when the rude church of the yet unendowed settlement was consecrated.10 This Chronicle, though it magnifies the liberality 6 Supra, Vol. II, 221, note 76. Vol. Ill, p. 138, note 68. 279). The theory seems applicable here. 3 Dugdale's Baronage, I, 36, quoting 7 The comparative antiquity of the names of certain streams and rivers has been before alluded to (Vol. IV, pp. 230, Giraldus. 0 Domesday, so. 184, a, 1. 10 Monasticon, VI, 128, et seq. No. i."], [283, "239 BARONY OP DE LACY. and other virtues of Sir Hugh de Lacy, teUs us nothing of the time or manner of his death, and only gives us a hint about his succession, a hint of which in due course I shall avail myself. In 1101 Hugh de Lacy subjected or conveyed to Gloucester Mo nastery the Church of St. Peter's (Hereford) , with aU its possessions, as founded and endowed by his Father.11 Hugh de Lacy, I should observe, had a brother Walter, who was at this time a monk of Gloucester, having entered the Monastery in 1080 when yet very young. On August 3, 1130, Walter de Lacy received the episcopal benediction as Abbot of Gloucester, in which high office he died 8 Feb. 1139. Hugh de Lacy his brother made further grants to Gloucester Monastery, and apparently in the year 1101.\u2014 The assertions that this Hugh de Lacy was a Benefactor to the Church of St. David's and the Monastery of Monmouth are pro bably founded in error.12 Hugh de Lacy the elder {vetus) was said by a provincial Jury in 1255, to have given two virgates in Ludlow to the Knights Hospitallers of Dinmore,13 but there are reasons for doubting whether the Grantor alluded to can have been the Hugh de Lacy whose very uncertain history I am endeavouring to trace. I have found only one more direct mention of the latter and it is embodied in one of those little-to-be-trusted Records, \u2014 a Monastic Fundatorum Progenies. \" Hugh de Lacy,\" says this document, \" the Founder of Lanthony in Wales, came into England at the Con quest.\" This announcement obliges us to receive with some cau tion the further statement that \" he died without issue, whereby his inheritance descended to his two Sisters, \u2014 Ermelina (who died issueless) and Emma, who being married (to a husband unnamed) had issue GUbert. Gilbert would appear to have taken the name of Lacy, for the Chronicle calls him Gilbert de Lacy without further comment.14 Now I cannot find any account of Hugh de Lacy's death, nor can I fix its period except by conjecture I think it took place between without issue, and most un- 1108 and 1121. No doubt he died Deed which appears to belong to a much later \u00e6ra than that of this Hugh de Lacy. (See Monasticon, IV, 597, Num. iv.) 11 Monasticon, I, 547. 12 Dugdale quotes Leiand (Coll. II, 89, b) for the first statement, but the pas sage in question refers to Lanthony. The Church of David, incidentally mentioned in an etymological discussion a few lines higher, seems to have misled Dugdale. As to Hugh de Lacy's grant to Mon mouth, Dugdale only supports that by a 13 Rot. Hundred. II, 69. 14 Monasticon,Vl, 135, b.

The former was perhaps too great a ca tastrophe to escape the direct notice of cotemporary Chroniclers ; the latter might more easily be passed over. Henry I evidently ig nored the claims of Gilbert or any other heir of Hugh de Laci. It seems to me that the King gave or entrusted Ludlow, Ewias, and Weobley to Pagan fitz John. With less certainty I fix upon Hamo Peverel as Grantee or Trustee of Lacy's estates in North Shrop shire. The proofs of all this are circumstantial. I have never seen the name of Hugh de Lacy or of Pagan fitz John directly associated with Ludlow, but I know that the daughter and the Grandson of Pagan fitz John were claiming Ludlow and Weobley, and probably Ewias, in 1198 as their hereditary right. I also know that Pagan fitz John was Lord of Ewias in Henry I's time, for Giraldus ex pressly says so.15 All else that is known of Pagan fitz John is quite consistent with the idea that he was entrusted with Ludlow Castle by Henry I. I therefore proceed to give account of this sometime Lord of Ludlow. Pagan fitz John is with great likelihood said to have been bro ther of Eustace fitz John,10 a powerful favourite of King Henry I, at whose Court both Eustace and Pagan are found in frequent at tendance. At Easter 1121 King Henry I is known to have been at Berkeley in Gloucestershire. It was probably on this occasion that he expedited a Charter to Richard de Capella, Bishop of Here ford.17 That Charter is addressed to and attested by Walter de Gloucester and Adam de Port, two great Herefordshire Barons. Their attestation is followed by that of Pagan fitz John ; and this is the first hint I have of any interest of the latter in the affairs of Herefordshire. Between the years 1123 and 1127 Pagan fitz John was appointed Viceroy of Shropshire in succession to Richard de Belmeis. I have before alluded to this fact and given the proofs thereof.18 I have also shown Pagan fitz John as having custody of Brug Castle in 1128 ;18 and I have shown him as addressed by Henry I, at Condover, in 1129 or 1130, in a way which almost proves his Viceregal power in Shropshire ; for though on some occasions he is called Sheriff, on this the Sheriff of the County is also addressed.19 The Pipe-Roll of 1130 extends to neither Herefordshire nor Shrop- 15 Giraldi Bin.

It exhibits Pagan fitz John as a land-holder in Oxfordshire, Gloucestershire, Berkshire, and Norfolk j also as a Justiciar who with Milo de Gloucester (his usual associate) had held pleas in Staf fordshire, Gloucestershire, and Pembrokeshire.30 About this time and in company with the same Milo de Gloucester (whom however Giraldus calls by anticipation Earl of Hereford), Pagan fitz John is noticed as a Secretary and Privy-Counsellor of King Henry I, and under circumstances which leave little doubt but that the two were associated in the government of the Welsh Marches. Pagan fitz John is also called \" Lord of Ewias.\"21 Under the year 1134, Or dericus relates how the Welsh, exasperated by the oppressions of the English, seized upon and burnt a Castle of Pagan fitz John called Cans, and slaughtered every inmate, male and female.22 In 1136, the first year of Stephen, Pagan fitz John was slain by the Welsh ; and John Hagustald adds to the circumstance a remark on this Baron having been somewhat prompt to acquiesce in the usur pation of Stephen.23 The Writer of the Gesta Regis Stephani con firms this to the letter, calling Milo de Gloucester and Pagan fitz John Governors of the Provinces of Herefordshire and Shropshire ; relating how, under King Henry I, these two had extended their power from the Severn to the Sea; \u2014 how through all the borders of England and Wales they had harassed the natives with vexatious Law- suits and compulsory services ; \u2014 how both concurred in doing fealty to Stephen ; and how Fitz John fell in a Welsh foray, pierced through the head by a spear, while none other of his band was wounded. This Writer hints that these two Lords of the West were actuated rather by a personal fear of Stephen than any in- ability to oppose him.24 Pagan fitz John left two daughters his coheirs,25 viz. Cecdy and Agnes. Cecily married before the year 1139 to Roger, eldest son 20 Rot. Pip. 31 Hen. I, passim.

Cecily became in due course Countess of Hereford. She was neglected if not deserted by her husband (Earl Roger), who died childless in 1155. She lived to a great age ; for she was born before 1127 and died about January 1207. Agnes, the other and I presume younger daughter of Pagan fitz John, was born about 1127. She married * * * * de Munchensi and had by him a son, William de Mun chensi, with other issue. She was living in 1185, but deceased in 1198, when William de Munchensi together with his Aunt, the Countess Cecilia, bad tendered that Fine to which I have before alluded, viz. \" to have their right in Ludelawe and Wibelay (Weo bley) and (apparently) Ewias.\"27 It is obvious to me, not that they had such a right, but that their claim was founded on their rela tions to Pagan fitz John, who consequently must be taken to have been sometime seized of Ludlow. A Writ of King John's, dated May 7, 1207, speaks of \" Cecilia Countess of Hereford and William de Munchensy her Nephew and heir.\" This William was therefore at that date the sole representative of Pagan fitz John ; but, as he never succeeded in establishing any claim on Lacy's Fief or on Lud low, I shall here leave him and revert to other matters. \u2014 The Fitz-Warin Chronicle, after reciting the treason and banish ment of Earl Robert de Belesme, tells us of the redistribution of his lands by Henry I. \" The Castle of Dynan,\" says the Writer, \" and all the country round towards the river .of Corve, with all the Ho nour, he (the King) gave to Sir Joce his Knight ; who thenceforth retained the name of Dynan, and was called everywhere Joce de Dynan. This Joce completed the castle which Roger de Belehealme (Earl Roger is meant) in his time began ; and he was a strong and valiant Knight. Now, the town was a very long time called Dynan, which is now called Ludlow.\"28 \u2014 The whole of this is probably false. We know that Earl Roger 26 Baronage (ut supra) quoting Glover's Collections. V Rot. Curi\u00e6 Regis, I, 144. The last name is written T * ias or Twias. That ~Ewias was meant I cannot doubt. 23 History (ut supra), p. 4."], [288, "244 LUDLOW. did not commence Ludlow Castle. We know that the Honour of which Ludlow was a part did not fall to the disposal of Henry I by the forfeiture of Earl Robert, but as an Escheat of Lacy.29 We have seen the probability that Henry I gave it to Pagan fitz John. More over, Joceas de Dynan is never heard of in Henry I's time, and when he does appear, so far from taking his name from Dynan, it is only possible that for a brief period he caused Ludlow to be called Dynan ; \u2014 but of its being so called at any time we have no other proof than the assertion of this Chronicle. Other authorities, with as little to back them as the Chronicle, talk of a Sir Fulk de Dynan, ouewhile as the Grantee of Earl Robert de Belesme (who never had Ludlow to bestow) , onewhile as the Grantee of Henry II, who we happen to know bestowed Ludlow in a very different way. Utterly discarding all these stories about Sir Fulk or Sir Joceas de Dynan, I proceed to state what is positively known and what may be reasonably concluded about Sir Joceas de Dynan, \u2014 the only real person of the two. Joceas de Dynan was, I conceive, a Foreigner, taking a name from his native town of Dinant in Bretagne. This obvious supposition is backed by a curious circumstance in the sub sequent history of his family. The third Fulk fitz Warin was Grandson aud Coheir of Joceas de Dynan and when outlawed in the reign of John he took refuge for a season in Bretagne. Joceas de Dynan first appears in the reign of Stephen. On the death of Pagan fitz John, the king probably seized that Baron's lands, and especially Ludlow Castle, which was garrisoned for the Crown. This reservation by Stephen will be more evident in the sequel. I suppose that the King appointed Joceas de Dynan Castellan of Lud low, giving him a share of Lacy's or rather Pagan fitz John's lands, to support him in that service. Stephen had occupied the throne little more than two years when several Barons revolted from his allegiance.30 The Norman Writer who records their names must be understood to place the event soon after Easter 1138.31 By some unaccountable accident he has represented Paganell as holding the Castle of Ludelaue against the King ; and this substitution of Lud low for Dudley has been adopted without question by every Writer since ; \u2014 I say since, because there was one cotemporary Writer, a Monk of Worcester, who gave the true account, but unfortunately 29 See Mr. Blakeway's remarks to the same effect ; printed among the \" Docu ments connected with the History of Lud low\" pp. 25, 26. 30 Chronica Normanni\u00e6 (Duehesne), p. 977. 31 Not Easter 1139, as the marginal date would load us to suppose."], [289, "JOCEAS DE DYNAN. 245 no one has followed him.32 Hence the history of Ludlow at this period, meagre and unsatisfactory as it is, has been encumbered with an additional and gratuitous difficulty. It was clearly in July or August 1138 (that is immediately before the siege of Shrews bury), that Stephen marched to the Castle of \" Duddel\u00e6ge\" which (as the Worcester Monk intelligibly tells us) \" Radulf Paignel\" (its owner to wit) \"had fortified against the King.\" The King burnt and plundered the neighbourhood, and then moved off to at tack Shrewsbury. In the next year (1139) we have an undoubted piece of Ludlow History ; and it was the hearing of this I think that confused the usually accurate Norman Writer, whom I have above mentioned, and who probably did not know that Dudley and Ludlow were two places. It was on April 9th, 1139, that Matilda, Stephen's Queen, accorded with Prince Henry of Scotland at Durham. The Prince went to Nottingham, where Stephen was, and remained with the King the whole summer. There was that in Stephen's character and exploits which might justly be called chivalry had it not been tainted with perjury and ingratitude. The fair side of his character was that which attracted the nephew of the Empress Maud to his Court. On April 30th, Stephen, with a royal retinue, visited Wor cester iu state. Thence he went to Ludelawe and encamped before it. He built two counter-forts against the Castle, and leaving it, apparently in a state of siege, moved away through Worcestershire, as if towards London. The Worcester Chronicler never tells us who defended Ludlow. It was doubtless Joceas de Dynan ; \u2014 and he had rebelled against Stephen. It was to this occasion that the Norman Chronicler alludes when he tells us how Prince Henry, riding under the Castle-walls, was seized by a grappling-iron thrown out by the besieged, and being thus dragged from off his horse would have been made a prisoner had not Stephen, by a splendid effort of personal courage, rescued him. This Chronicler adds some words which imply that Stephen succeeded in reducing Ludlow.33 The Monk of Worcester tells a very different story, but in such obscure terms that I will only venture on a general statement of what I conceive to be his meaning. The Knights whom Stephen had left besieging Lud low seem to have got up some tournament or passage-of-arms among themselves. It was numerously attended, and some fatal casualties occurred. Stephen hearing thereof, turned back from his London expedition, recrossed Worcestershire, reached Ludlow, settled all dis- 32 Flor. Wigorn. Contin. II, 110. 33 Chron. Normann. p. 978, A."], [290, "246 LUDLOW. turbances there, and then proceeded to Oxford.34 It was at Oxford, as we know, in the end of June, that he arrested the Bishops of Salisbury and Lincoln, \u2014 a step the most portentous and the most disastrous ever taken by him. Ludlow, I imagine, remained un reduced. Recurring now to the fact, hitherto assumed, that Joceas de Dynan rebelled against his Benefactor Stephen, I shall not attempt to account for it, but be satisfied if I can adduce one or two circum stances to show that I have not gratuitously assumed it. I have before spoken of the Charter by which Stephen gave the Earldom of Hereford to Robert de Bossu, Earl of Leicester.'55 It is almost certain that this Charter passed in 1 140. It gives to the proposed Earl the County of Hereford generally, but excepts from the grant the great Fiefs of Mortimer, Richard's Castle, and Braose; \u2014 which of course were still to be held immediately of the Crown. It also excepts the \" Fee of Godso de Dinan which before was Hugh de Lacy's,\" but with this remarkable proviso, that \"If the Earl of Leicester could so deal with the said Godso as that he himself should be willing to hold the fee aforesaid under the Earl, \u2014 that the King fully al lows.\"36 It is evident that the King was not in a position to guaran tee anything about Joceas de Dinan or his Fief. The fealty of the Lord of Ludlow was not the King's to grant. The new Earl was to get it if he could. I will now exhibit Joceas or Gotso de Dinan in the Court of the Empress, which will prove his political leaning beyond doubt. There are two Charters of the Empress to Shrewsbury Abbey. They were probably cotemporary, and one is dated at Devizes (in Wiltshire), a town which the Empress never obtained till after the defeat of Stephen at Lincoln in February 1141. In that year, one, and pro bably both, of these Charters passed. One is attested by Goe' de Dinan, the other by G. de Dinan.37 I shall here be justified in assuming that Stephen's grant of the lands of Pagan fitz John to his daughter Cecily, then wife of Roger, son of Milo de Gloucester, must have been in antagonism to Joceas de Dinan's interests. Also 31 Florence Wigorn. Confr'\u00bb.II,115,116. 37 Salop Chartulary, Nos. 40, 50.\u2014 One Charter is tested by Bainald Vicecomes de Cornubia, the other by Bainald Comes dc Cornewallia.

The month of April 1139 was also the period of Joceas de Dinan's defection and the siege of Ludlow, so that probably Stephen's Charter to Cecily passed between April and September 1139. And when Milo had deserted him, Stephen, na turally enough, resorted to a third shift, and granted Milo's Earl dom to Robert de Bossu, viz. in 1140. I will now show the persis tent adherence of Joceas de Dinan to the cause of the Empress, as well as his continued tenure of Ludlow Castle notwithstanding the enmity of Stephen. \u2014 I have often commented on the great accuracy of a certain French Chronicle which details the fortunes of the House of Mortimer. I have also pointed out several reasons for supposing that Hugh de Mortimer who lived in Stephen's reign was a constant friend to the Usurper. Naturally then we expect to find him a foe to Joceas de Dinan. And so it was. After the death of Bishop Robert de Betun (April 22, 1148) and before the accession of Henry II (1154) \"a great war arose,\" says the Chronicle, \" between Sir Hugh cle Mor timer and Sir Joce de Dinan, then Lord of Ludlow, insomuch that this same Joce could not freely or at pleasure enter or quit his Castle of Ludlow for fear of Sir Hugh, so pertinaciously the latter pursued the war. And because Joce could prevail nothing against Sir Hugh by force, he set spies along the roads where he heard that Sir Hugh was to pass unattended, and took him and held him in his castle in prison until he had paid his ransom of three thousand merks of silver, besides all his plate and his horses and birds (hawks) . And to hasten this ransom as speedily as possible, Sir Hugh requested aid of his friends on all sides,\" etc.38 The truth of this story is con firmed by the testimony of the Fitz-Warin Chronicle, which, as secondary evidence, has its value. The Writer speaks of the some time captivity of a Mortimer in Ludlow Castle, and says that in his time a certain tower (\" the highest in the third bail of the castle \") was called Mortimer.39 This Writer lived in the thirteenth or four teenth century ; \u2014 but the name and position of Mortimer's Tower are still known in the nineteenth.39 Returning to Joceas de Dinan, I have one more proof of his con tinuous attachment to the cause of legitimacy during the civil war. 38 History of Ludlow (Wright), p. 113. 39 History of Fulk fitz Warine, p. 34. I See also Mr. Wright's note, identifying the | Tower in question."], [292, "248 LUDLOW. Prince Henry, as Duke of Normandy, first landed in England in January 1153. In the course of the year the Duke, being at Gloucester, granted a site for the Staffordshire Abbey of Radmore. His Charter was attested inter alios by Gozo, i. e. Gotso de Dinan, whose name however has been converted by the hands of transcribers into Sozo de Dinam.40 The earliest extant Pipe-Roll of Henry II's reign is that of 1156. It exhibits Joceas de Dinan with an enor mous grant of Crown-lands in Berkshire, viz. \" \u00a376. blanch, of lands in Lamborn.\" The same grant is repeated on the Pipe-Rolls of succeeding years, and we know from other authority that the King made this grant without reserving any service to the Crown. My belief is that the grant was not altogether in discharge of the King's debt of gratitude to Joceas de Dinan. I think it was also in compensation of a claim upon Ludlow, which circumstances obliged the King to disallow. Of that however hereafter. Joceas de Dinan lived probably till 1166. In 1167 he was certainly de ceased.41 He left two daughters and coheirs, Hawise, wife of the second Fulk fitz Warin of Whittington, and Sibil wife of Hugh de Plugenai ; but of this succession I cease to speak here, inasmuch as the title of the family to Ludlow was never recognised after Henry II's accession. I must now return far back, to trace, if I can, something of the fortunes of the disinherited House of Lacy. \u2014 I have before quoted a Charter of King Stephen, which, passing about March 1136, was attested by Pagan fitz John as a Baron.42 It will somewhat per plex our former argument to observe that the second signature pre ceding Pagan fitz John's purports to be that of \" Gilbert de Lacy, \u2014 Baron.\" We at once conclude that Stephen had recognised the title of Hugh de Lacy's Nephew, and this is inexplicable if he had also recognised that of Pagan fitz John. But the whole difficulty ai'ises in an error of transcription. Another Charter of Stephen's, on a cognate subject, passed at the same time, probably on the same day as the last. Of its 36 witnesses 30 had attested the former Charter, one was Grantee in the former Charter, and four are new witnesses. The 36th or remaining witness is Ilbert de Laci, Baron, corresponding to the Gilbert de Lacy ofthe former Charter.43 Doubt- 40 Monasticon, V, 447, Num. v. 1167 shows Lamborn partly resumed by the Crown, partly given to Hugh de Plu genai, partly given to others. 41 The Berkshire Pipe-Bolls from 1162 to 1166, mention the Crown-grant of \u00a376. blanch in Lamborn; but the Grantee's name ceases to be entered.

There can be little doubt I think that the Lacies of Ewias and of Pontefract were originally of the same stock, though each family had had its own representa tive from a period anterior to Domesday. I say this, not to account for the confusion just noticed, but to introduce another branch of this investigation. \u2014 At the death of Richard Bishop of Baieux in 1133, two Knights, Gilbert and Henry, are registered as holding two fees in that Nor man See. Their collective fief is called Feodum de Lacey cum Cam pellis (the fee of Lacey and Campeaux) .** These two Knights I take to be Gilbert, the nephew of Hugh de Lacy of Ewias, and Henry, younger brother of Ilbert de Lacy of Pontefract. Both families were then under escheat in England, but not, it would seem, in re gard of this their tenure in Normandy. On the death of Henry I, all persons disinherited in England naturally anticipated that, in the coming struggle and confusion, something might be gained by those who had nothing to lose. Ilbert de Lacy of Pontefract joined Ste phen ; his brother Henry, if not at first, yet in course of time, ad hered to the Empress. Gilbert de Lacy's first movement I cannot detect ; but a kinsman of his (Geoffrey Talbot) primarily joined Ste phen, and attested as a Baron the very Charter noticed above as bearing the signature of Ilbert de Lacy. A careful collation of dif ferent Chronicles enables me to give the following account of pro gressive events. After Easter (April 3) 1138 Geoffrey Talbot re belled, and fortified Hereford Castle against Stephen.45 Stephen heard of this just after Ascension Day (May 12) at Gloucester. He marched to Hereford, spent four or five weeks there, and was crowned in the Cathedral on Whit-Sunday (May 22). The Castle was sur rendered. Stephen also took the town of Wibbeleag (Weobley, once a member of Lacy's Fief) which the same Geoffrey Talbot, who now had fled from the neighbourhood, had fortified against the Crown. On the 15th of June, Stephen having left Hereford (the City half burnt, but the Castle well garrisoned), Geoffrey Talbot 44 Rot. Normanni\u00e6 (Stapleton), II, kxx.

This month of June was marked by a great event, the revolt of Bristol, at the behest of its illustrious Earl, Robert the Consul, who in the end of May had openly and formally published his renunciation of all allegiance to Stephen. To Bristol Geoffrey Talbot now betook himself. One day (probably in July) Talbot, with William Hoset and another (unnamed by the Worcester Monk), made an excursion from Bristol for the purpose of reconnoitring Bath, then held by its Bishop, \u2014 a partisan of Stephen. The Bishop, having some sus picion of their object, took such measures that Talbot was arrested ; \u2014 but the two others escaped. The Castellans of Bristol instantly appeared at Bath with force sufficient to back a threat that if Talbot was not released, the Bishop and his retinue should be hanged. The Bishop gave up his prisoner, but nearly lost his Mitre, so enraged was Stephen at hearing of his pusillanimity.46 The writer of the Gesta Regis Stephani tells this story, describing Geoffrey Talbot as one whom a previous part of his narrative (now lost) had shown to be under sentence of exile from England; \u2014 but, what is more to our purpose, he gives the name of Geoffrey Talbot's other companion in the exploit at Bath. It was his \" kinsman Gilbert de Lacy, a prudent man, and one of great foresight and activity in any military undertaking.\" This writer attributes Lacy's escape to his making a more skilful and a fiercer resistance than Talbot. The rest of the story is told at much length, and with circumstances which show that the method by which Lacy and his party procured the release of Talbot was tainted with sacrilege and perjury.47 In August 1140 Geoffrey Talbot was slain in a skirmish near Bath. The Worcester Monk says that he was \" an active but treacherous Soldier, now in the King's party, now in the Earl's, doing all things in guile.\"48 It was by the times in which they lived that such characters were formed. Talbot was probably not much better nor much worse than the generality. He was buried in the Monastery of Gloucester, and his kinsman49 Gilbert de Lacy survived him. On July 25, 1141, \u00ab F/or.

Stephen had already encouraged three claimants to the whole or a part of Lacy's inheritance. Pagan fitz John had been killed ; Joceas de Dynan had betrayed the cause of Stephen ; the husband of Cecilie fitz Pagan, Stephen's third nominee, was the son of Milo de Gloucester, now Stephen's bitterest foe. No wonder then that Stephen should be glad to enlist a fourth Grantee, and one who could claim as an heir. The symptoms of Gilbert de Lacy's change of sides are as follows : \u2014 At Devizes, in September 1146, Robert fitz Roy, Earl of Glou cester, in the presence of Mathildis the Empress, quit-claimed to Philip, then Bishop of Bayeux, all the fiefs of Ilbert and Gilbert de Lacy which they held of the said Bishop, at Lassey, and at Cam peaux, and elsewhere.51 Ilbert de Lacy was, I repeat, a known par tisan of King Stephen. Iuferentially Gilbert de Lacy was at this time the same ; \u2014 and the Empress and her Brother concurred in a measure which was meant to deprive them both of their Norman Fiefs. About the same time we have an indication that \u2014 Gilbert de Lacy was in possession of his Lordship of Ewias, and on terms of friendship with Hugh de Mortimer of Wigmore, \u2014 the latter fact implying that he was also a supporter of Stephen. It appears that Oliver de Merlimond (whom I have mentioned as Mor timer's Steward) held something at Lanthony in the Lordship of Ewias. This estate he seems to have given, previously to the year 1 1 13, to certain Canons whose residence at Shobdon he had taken much pains to procure. Oliver de Merlimond's disgrace, his taking refuse with Earl Milo, and Mortimer's harsh treatment of the Shob don Canons, I have before alluded to.

I must now turn to the Fitz- Warin Chronicle, which exhibits the traditionary accounts of a long-enduring feud between Walter de Lacy of Ewias and Joceas de Dynan of Ludlow. If there be any truth in the particulars related, they must have transpired at a period when all law and kingly authority were in abeyance. Such a pe riod was the reign of Stephen as regarded Shropshire and Hereford shire ; and so far as Joceas de Dynan was concerned, he never had anything at Ludlow after the accession of Henry II. His antagonist was undoubtedly Gilbert, not Walter, de Lacy ; but whether Lacy recovered Ludlow Castle by stratagem, as the Legend declares, or by some more formal assertion of his hereditary right, he can only have been permitted to retain it on the latter ground, as sanctioned by Henry II. For there is no doubt that Gilbert de Laci's partisan ship with Stephen and Hugh de Mortimer was overlooked by Henry II, and that he was regarded with much favour by that Monarch. As a proof of this I may instance one fact. \u2014 In 1158 a Donum was exacted from most English Counties, and Gilbert de Lacy was ex cused, by Writs of the King, his proportion in the several Counties of Herefordshire, Gloucestershire, and Shropshire.33 Gilbert de Lacy became I think a Templar before his death ; for the \"Monkish Chronicler of Lanthony, after recording the virtues of the first Hugh de Lacy and the sanctity of his brother Walter (the Abbot of Glouces ter), further informs us that \" Hugh had a Nephew, a most approved soldier, who, after winning a reputation for innumerable acts of va lour, and coming off triumphant in many contests and wars, did not refuse to work in the Christian cause under the habit of a Tem plar.\"54 That Gilbert de Lacy was here alluded to, I think probable from the terms used, but morally certain when I find that the Calen dar of the Templars' lands taken in 1185 records benefactions in Guttingres (Guiting Temple), Holford, and Winchelcumbe, as hav ing been made to the Order by Gilbert or G. de Lacy.55 Another Record makes Gilbert de Lacy the Grantor of many tenements and lands attached to the Preceptory of the Templars at Quenyngton, in Gloucestershire.56 52 History of Ludlow (Wright), p. 109. 53 Rot.

One or both events will have taken place between 1158 and 1163, according to a fact already stated, and the further fact that \" Gilbert Bishop of Hereford (translated to London in 1163) received from Hugh de Lacy the service of two knights'-fees which he was reputed to hold of the Bishop, but half of which service Hugh afterwards denied.\"57 I have purposely with held a part of the expression used in this quotation, because it bears upon another question, viz. as to when Hugh de Lacy entered upon public life and whether it was not some time before his Father's death? The Bishop of Hereford of 1165 asserted Hugh de Laci to have rendered service on two fees during the whole time of Bishop Gilbert. Now Gilbert Foliot was consecrated in September 1148, and if the above expression be literally true, Hugh de Lacy will have had seizin of these ecclesiastical fees long before his Father's death. He appears also in another matter earlier than we should ordinarily expect. It was before the year 1155 that the Shobdon Canons, whom I have so often alluded to, were allowed to migrate to Ay mestry, a permission which Sir Hugh de Lacy as a friend of Sir Hugh de Mortimer persuaded the latter to revoke on the ground of its impolicy. The Canons were consequently removed to Wig more.58 This Sir Hugh was, I doubt not, the person whom all au thorities agree to have been son and heir of Gilbert de Lacy. Hugh de Lacy, probably on his succession, obtained a Charter of confirmation from Henry II. That Charter is not known to be in existence, but it once formed a part of the muniments preserved at Wigmore Castle, and was described in a catalogue of those muni ments as the Charter which King Henry made to Sir Hugh de Lacy of the Manors of Stauntone Lacy, Lodelow, Webbeleye, Ewyas, and Arkhulle (Child's Ercall) .\"59 These appear to me to have been the Manors of Lacy's demesne. The Feodary of 1165-6 contains the return of Hugh de Lacy.\u2014 The great Chief probably compiled the Document himself, and it is worthy of very particular attention. He considered himself entitled to the services of 58| knights'-fees, whereof 53| were of old and 5^ of new feoffment. Besides this he had nine Tenants, each holding from 6 librates down to a virgate of land, but without any specific knight's-service assessed on their Tene ments. Some of these lived in Sir Hugh's household, some were in 59 Additional MSS. (Brit. Mus.) No. I 6041, so. xxxvij. W Liber Niger (Hearne), I, 150.

However, the services on 3^ of these old fees were now refused or questioned by the Tenants. The 5^ Fees of new feoffment had probably been granted during the Lacy forfeiture. \u2014 Two of them were held by Herbert de Castellis, and all of them appear to have been in Shropshire, as I have shown or shall show elsewhere. The first Aid, assessed according to the returns enrolled in the Liber Niger, was put in charge in 1168, in consequence of the marriage of the King's daughter. An extreme view seems to have been taken of Lacy's liabilities; for instead of being assessed on 58| fees he was assessed on 60^, and so was entered as accounting (at the rate of 1 merk per fee) for a sum of \u00a34Q. 3s. 4s?.61 In October 1171 Hugh de Lacy accompanied King Henry II in his expedition to Ireland; and when in April 1172 more urgent affairs obliged the King to make a hurried return, Hugh de Lacy was left, doubtless for the purpose of furthering his Master's in terests across the Channel.62 The rebellion of Prince Henry broke out in Normandy in April 1173. The King instantly recalled Hugh de Lacy from Ireland to aid him at this critical juncture; for the re bellion of his Son was prompted by the Councils, and seconded by the arms of Louis VII of France. Parties in Normandy were di vided. On the side of the Prince stood the powerful Earl of Chester. The aged and experienced Earl of Arundel, and the chivalrous Hugh de Lacy, were constant in their devotion to the King. On July 6 Louis invested the important frontier town of Verneuil. It was magnanimously defended by Hugh de Lacy aud Hugh de Beau champ, its Governors, who held out for more than a month. On Au gust 9, King Henry himself relieved Verneuil, and Louis was forced to retreat. The rebellion of Prince Henry had now extended to England, and the King can hardly be said to have recovered secure possession of his throne before the Winter of 1174. Under these circumstances it is not probable that Hugh de Lacy was permitted to return to Ireland. Judging from Hugh de Lacy's appearances 00 Liber Niger (Hearue), I, 153-155. r'; Roi. Pip. 14 Hen.

It was probably in this interval (1174-1177) that he negotiated the marriage of young William fitz Alan with a daughter of his own, whose name I cannot declare, but I think that she was at the time an infant. Four of Lacy's Shropshire Fees were given in frank-marriage on this occasion, and so went to aug ment the Barony of Fitz Alan. Meanwhile, Richard Earl of Stri goil, had been appointed Justiciar {i. e. Viceroy) of Ireland. He died in that office on April 5, 1176, and William fitz Adeline, one of the King's Dapiferi, was appointed to succeed him. It was early in May 1177 that King Henry, in a Great Council at Oxford, de clared his son John to be King of Ireland, and exhibited a Papal sanction of the appointment. On this occasion the King renewed his former Charter to Hugh de Lacy, so far as the Province of Meath and the City of Dublin were concerned ; but nothing was said about the Justiciarship.63 Now probably Hugh de Lacy re turned to Ireland, his mind filled with projects of a large if not of a selfish ambition. Early in 1179, the King being at Windsor, heavy complaints reached the Court about the excesses of William fitz Adeline and Hugh de Lacy, the Lords of Meath and of Wex ford.64 What view the King took of this does not appear ; but the same year he shipped a quantity of corn from Bristol for the use of his retainers {famili\u00e6 su\u00e6) in Ireland, and this corn was conveyed by servants of Hugh de Lacy.63 Early in the year 1181 the King being in Normandy heard that Hugh de Lacy had married a daugh ter of the King of Connaught. This was without the royal license, and therefore the King sent the Constable of Chester and Richard de Pecco to supersede Lacy in his office of Custos of the City of Dublin.66 So far the Chroniclers' accounts are substantiated by an entry on the Staffordshire Pipe-Roll of 1181; for the Sheriff actually charges an outlay which he had been ordered to make in forwarding the two new functionaries to their destination. But the Pipe-Rolls go historically much further than this, and assure us that Hugh de Lacy's offence was viewed as nothing less than High Treason. In short, there can I think be little doubt that King Henry suspected Lacy of an intention to found an independent Kingdom for himself in Ireland.67 Ludlow Castle was seized to the Crown in 1181, and 00 Benedictus Abbas, p. 354. 63 Hoveden, 323, b, 324. 64 Benedictus Abbas, p. 287. 67 I find this broadly asserted by one of 65 Rot.

Turstin fitz Simon held the King's Herefordshire Manor of Linton for that year, in payment of \u00a316. 10s., his salary for custody ofthe said Castle. A similar allowance was made to Turstin fitz Simon in 1182, 1183, and indeed till 1189 inclusive. Meantime, that is on Julv 25, 1185, Hugh de Lacy had been assassinated atDurrow, in Ireland. He left issue, says my authority, \"four sons, Walter, Hugh, Gilbert, and William, and two daughters, \u00c6gidia wife of Richard de Burgh, and Elena wife of Richard de Belfou.\"68 The first of these Ladies is erroneously named as a daughter of Hugh de Lacy, and we may put in her stead that other daughter who was the wife of William Fitz Alan. Walter de Lacy was evidently a Minor, or under political dis qualification, perhaps both, at his Father's death. In 1186 the Sheriff of Herefordshire accounts \u00a310. to the King for the issues of the lands of Hugh de Laci within his Bailiwick. In 1187 Lacy's Fief was assessed to the scutage of Galway as containing no less than 51 J fees of old, and 11-fV fees \u00b0f new feoffment. Ralph de Ardern, Sheriff of Herefordshire, levied and accounted for the whole sum of \u00a362. 7s. thus arising. He so accounted because the Honour of Hugh de Lacy was in manu Regis. Further, the same Sheriff had received \u00a347. for a year's issues of Hugh de Lacy's lands in Herefordshire. Out of this he had paid \u00a337. for the cost and cus tody of the Castles of Ewyas and New Castle {Novi Castri) from August 1, 1186, to Michaelmas 1187, and \u00a310. for the custody of Weobley Castle during the same period. In this year also Ludlow was assessed to a Royal Tallage at the high rate of 20 merks, as being in manu Regis. In 1188 Ralph de Arderne had again received \u00a347. from Lacy's Herefordshire Fief, and had again ex pended it on the custody of Lacy's three Herefordshire Castles. I should observe in connection with this fragmentary account of Lacy's Escheat, that a House which he had in Shrewsbury was seized by the Crown, apparently about March 1185, and Is. (the half-year's income therefrom) was accounted for by the Sheriff at Michaelmas 1185 as a new Escheat. Two Shillings per annum are burgh says also that the King recalled Lacy from Ireland, but that Lacy set the mandate at nought. Newburgh gives a fuller account of Lacy's assassination than I have elsewhere seen.

About Midsummer 1189 Henry II appears to have restored the lands of Walter son and heir of Hugh de Lacy. Accordingly the various Accountants at the Michaelmas Exchequer of 1189 (King Richard had then succeeded) answer for only three quarters of a year's receipts from the Lacy estates. Lacy's Manor of Bretford in Wiltshire bad thus yielded \u00a319. 6s., his Herefordshire Fief \u00a335. 5s., his House in Shrewsbury Is. 6d., \u2014 all for the King's use.69 In 1190 a Scutage, I think for Wales, was somewhat irregularly assessed throughout different parts of the Kingdom. Walter de Lacy was charged in Herefordshire for the same, on 51| knights' fees only, that is, he was charged \u00a325. 12s. 6d. at 10s. per fee. Not yet had Ludlow Castle been restored to Walter de Lacy ; for I find that in this very year the Sheriff of Shropshire had stored the said Castle with corn, oats, bacon, and wine, at the order of the Chan cellor (Longchamp) and at an expense of \u00a310. 9s. Sd. Moreover the said Sheriff had paid to Gilbert de Essartis 100s. for custody of the same Castle under a like authority. The following year these payments were suspended, and I infer that Ludlow Castle was again in the hands of its Lord. In 1194 Walter de Lacy was put in charge to the Scutage for the King's Redemption. He was assessed on 51| fees, that is \u00a351. 5s., at the rate of \u00a31. per fee. \" During this year,\" says my authority, \" the ravages committed by Walter de Lacy, in conjunction with John de Courcy Lord of Ulster, upon the territory of the King in Ireland, caused a seizure of his lands into the King's hands.\"70 A few extracts from the Pipe-Rolls will illus trate this statement. The King's Escheator received at Michael mas 1194, Is. for the rent of an escheated house in Shrewsbury; at Michaelmas 1195 he received 3s. for the same ; and afterwards 4s. per annum was accruing on this account till Michaelmas 1197, when the payment ceases.71 At this period Walter de Lacy was evidently in treaty with King Richard for the royal pardon.

The Roll of 1198 assures me that such a proffer had been rejected as inadequate, and gives more of the actual transaction, as follows.72\u2014 \"Walter de Laci renders account of 3100 merks (\u00a32066. 13s. 4d.), for having the King's good-will and seizin of his laud.

And he owes \u00a31200.\"73 I have already alluded to the assertion of Hoveden, that Lud low Castle was seized into the King's hands by the Viceroy Hubert Walter, at Christmas 1197.74 I do not question the fact; but whe ther the seizure was only pending the King's negotiations with Lacy, or whether it was intended that Ludlow should be an excep tion to the general reseizin accorded to Lacy I cannot declare. I think however that the latter was the case ; for the next notice I have of Ludlow exhibits it, both town and Castle, as in the hands of King John. I should pause here a moment to notice another feature in the annals of this remarkable family. The Norman Fief of De Lacy was at this time as great as his English, and perhaps as his Irish possessions. An idea of its magnitude may be gathered from the account which the King's Escheator rendered of his receipts from Lacy's estates in Normandy during the year before they were re stored to the heir. That Officer had actually received therefrom \u00a3750. in money, besides produce-in-kind of diverse sorts, \u2014 grain, wine and fish.75 That King John at his succession looked upon Lacy with sus picion is probable. A Writ of September 4, 1199, mentions the out rages committed by W. de Lacy and John de Courci on the King's territory, as if they were not yet forgotten or else had been renewed, and yet we know that, on the very day previous, Walter de Lacy was in the King's Court at Rouen. Again in the next year he appears to have gone with the King to Normandy ; for he occurs in the Court at Falaise on June 4. On November 9 he was with King- John at Feckenham, in Worcestershire ; and about this time it was 72 King Bichard was in Normandy all this time, and Lacy had evidently gone thither to make his peace.

In less than soar years Lacy had lost his Norman Fief under a law stronger than that of mortgage, \u2014 the law of conquest. In less than ten years he and his Father-in-law were Outlaws and exiles, by sentence of the very King who had sanctioned their domestic contract. In January 1201 I find Walter de Lacy in attendance on King John at Lincoln. The same year his Herefordshire Fief was assessed, as containing 51 j Knights'-fees, to the second scutage of King John. This evidently included his Shropshire Fees ; but one fee in Berk shire and 2^ fees in Oxfordshire were separately assessed.77 After this we usually find Lacy's Shropshire Fief assessed to Scutages by itself. Thus in 1202 and 1203 it was put at 10 knights' fees, and so answered to the third and fourth scutages of King John. In the latter instance William de Braose was held responsible for the charge, \"because,\" says the Record, \"he had Walter de Lacy's land in custody.\" In this same year (1203) it becomes evident that Ludlow was in the King's hand ; for a tallage of 10 merks was set upon the Vill in common with other estates of the Crown. In 1204 Walter de Lacy had quittance in Shropshire from the fifth scutage of King John. He had gone over to his Irish estates,78 and with the King's sanction ; for a Patent of March 14, 1204, speaks of him as being in the King's service there, and directs that, as long as he was so, the Sheriffs of Shropshire and Herefordshire should protect his interests in those Counties.79 Another Patent of March hostages from Walter de Lacy before he went to Ireland, that is, in February or March (Rot.

Lacy was accordingly to hand the same over to the Viceroy of Ireland.82 Two Charters of November 13 give to Walter de Lacy and his Brother Hugh no less than fourteen Irish Cantreds, but these Charters were brought back from Ireland by one of the Nuncios entrusted therewith, and were afterwards cancelled.83 This indication of distrust is strengthened by passages in the Close-Rolls, which show that in January and June 1205 King John had in his custody certain hostages as security for Walter de Lacy's conduct. Moreover a Letter which, on June 30, 1205, the King addressed to his Irish Viceroy, though it indicates unshaken confidence in Hugh de Lacy (Earl of Ulster), yet seems to enjoin the Viceroy to defer to the advice of Walter de Lacy more as a matter of expediency than confidence.84 In this year, and in 1206, Walter de Lacy's Shropshire Fief was rated to the sixth and seventh scutages of King John as consisting of eight Knights'-fees. Though there was a Tallage in each year, Ludlow was not assessed. It appears indeed that before May 26, 1206, Walter de Lacy had fined 400 merks for repossession of the Castle and land of Ludelawe ; for a King's Writ of that date tells the Barons of the Exchequer to let the said Fine be liquidated at the rate of 100 merks per annum, instead of 200 (as originally agreed).85 A Patent of February 21, 1207, shows that Walter de Lacy had been openly at variance with the Irish Viceroy about Limerick. The King thanks the Barons and Knights of Meath (Lacy's own Vassals) for their loyalty to the Crown, and for their efforts to keep their Lord 80 Rot. Patent, p. 45. 31 Rot. Cart. p. 136. 82 Rot.

The latter is to give it up to Philip de Al binyac, to whom the King had entrusted it, to keep during pleasure, and in the same way as the Justiciar {i. e. the Chief- Justice of Eng land) had formerly kept it.86 A Precept of March 10 shows that 20 merks had already been paid to Philip de Albinyac for this pur pose ;87 a second orders wine of the King's to be sent from Bristol for the stores of Ludlow Castle.88 In further proof of Lacy's dis affection, we have a Patent of April 14, 1207, offering him security if he will come to the King's Court, and there do and receive jus tice.89 This was accompanied by a Letter-Close to the Viceroy of Ireland, telling him not to proceed to confiscation against Lacy, if he would so come and take his trial.89 Again a Patent of May 23 exhibits Walter and Hugh de Lacy as both in Ireland, and trespas sing on the rights of the Crown.90 On the 13th of July, 1207, Philip de Albiniac is ordered to de liver the Castle and Vill of Ludlow to William de Braose,91 \u2014 a half indication that Lacy had come or was coming to terms with the King. On July 16 we accordingly find him in the Court at Win chester, and on September 27 in the Court at Bristol. On Decem ber 4th we hear of the King's releasing one of his hostages ; and, on the 5th, the King informs the Viceroy of Ireland that he has committed to his faithful and beloved Walter de Lacy the Cantred of Ardmull, to hold during pleasure, and the Viceroy is not to allow him to be impleaded in any suit so long as he is, by the King's will, in England.92 In January 1208, though we find mention of one of Lacy's hostages being still in the King's custody, the Baron him self is with the Court, and has the King's letters of Protection for himself and his Suite.93 His full restoration to Royal confidence appears to have taken place in March. On the 19th of that month King John being at Clarendon, writes to inform the Viceroy of Ire land that \" Walter de Lacy has made peace for his Irish estates.\" The Viceroy, if he has attacked Lacy's Tenants or Territory in any way, is to desist, and to leave him and them in peaceable posses sion.94 A Patent of the same day orders that as soon as William 91 Patent, p. 74. 92 Claus.

When found, that Char ter should be restored to Braose.\"95 On March 20th Walter de Lacy is still with the Court at Claren don ; on the 23rd a Patent styles him faithful and beloved ; on the 9th of April the King (as if vouchsafing a special favour) allows that Hugh de Lacy, one of Walter's hostages, shall be permitted to go without irons, but still must be safely guarded.96 On April 24, 1208, the King, at the request of Walter de Lacy, expedited a great Charter securing to him and his heirs his land of Meath, to hold by 50 Knights'-fees, and his fief of Finegal, in the Vale of Dublin, to hold by seven knights'-fees, of the King and his heirs for ever, under certain provisions as to the jurisdiction of the said pro vinces.97 Soon after this, Lacy returned to Ireland ; for a Patent of May 29, 1208, gives him the King's protection as long as he should remain there in the King's service.98 At this period the loss of a great part of our national Records prevents our tracing the progress of events with anything like accuracy. It is difficult ou the other hand to extract from the Chroniclers anything more than a general idea of the causes which induced King John's expedition to Ireland in the Summer of 1210. Suffice it to say that the great Houses of Lacy and Braose were in open rebellion, so that Meath, Ulster, and Munster were arrayed against the King. John's campaign was on the whole successful. It closed with the outlawry and banishment of Walter and Hugh de Lacy, and of the elder Braose. They re tired to France. The wife and the eldest of Braose's Sons fell into the King's hands, and never reappeared. Tradition has it that they were famished in the dungeons of Windsor.99 Walter and Hugh de Lacy, according to one account, took refuge in the Monastery of St. Taurin, at Evreux, but without declaring their rank.

This story consists with a probability that the Monastery of Foure, in Ireland, a cell to the Norman Abbey of St. Tauriu, was afterwards founded and endowed by Wal ter and Hugh de Lacy, \u2014 grateful, we may suppose, to the friends of their adversity.100 It was during Walter de Lacy's exile, and probably in the years 1211 and 1212, that two Shropshire Surveys speak thus of his es tates. \u2014 \" Walter de Lacy used to hold of the King by Barony. He owed the service of ten Knights. His lands are in the King's hand.\" And again, \u2014 \" The Castle and Vill of Ludellawe, with their appur tenances, are in the King's hand. Engelard Engayn (read Cigoyn), Sheriff of Herefordshire, is responsible for the same.\"1 Before June 1, 1213, Walter de Lacy sent Letters to King John, asking for permission to return into England (or to come to the King in England) on certain conditions. The King promised that he might safely and at once do so.2 The result of the conference was that on July 29 the Kiug wrote to Engelard cle Cigony, enclos ing a copy of an undertaking made by Lacy, and desiring that as soon as Lacy should have delivered four hostages3 and other securi ties to the said Engelard, he should give him full seizin of all his lands except Ludlow, which the King retained during pleasure. If any stores or stock had been removed from the said lands since June 24 last, they were to be replaced. A similar precept was ad dressed to Hugh de Nevill, Justice of the Forest, probably as hav ing custody of the Forest of Ewyas.4 The same day another Man date tells Engelard de Cigoin that, as soon as Lacy shall have found security for paying \u00a340. per annum towards custody of Ludlow Castle, he (Engelard) is to give him seizin of the Manor of Ludlow, with all its appurtenances, except the Castle.5 A mandate of Au gust 7 enjoins the same thing in other words, viz. that Engelard de Cigoin do give to Walter de Lacy seizin of the Manor of Ludelawe for \u00a340. per annum? That this was not done is clear ; for the Borough of Ludlow remained in the King's hands, probably because Lacy failed to find the required securities. Consequently in 1214 we find the Vill of Ludlow assessed at 50 merks to a King's Tal lage.7 Lacy, and of William de Fuishes (read 100 Rot. Normanni\u00e6 (Stapleton), II, I lxxij. Eurches). 4 Claus.

We have news of his having landed at Rochelle before March 14, and of his going to Narbonne on April 13 to purchase horses for the King. On this occasion he is styled \" our faithful and beloved\" by the King.8 On May 26 the King's Letters exempt Walter de Lacy generally from the Scutage of Poitou, which had its effect in Shropshire by the Sheriff's acquitting him of 21 merks, the assess ment proportioned to seven knights'-fees. On October 23 the King, having come to some agreement about Ludlow with Walter de Lacy, orders Engelard de Cigoyn to deliver up the Vill instantly to the said Walter.9 Another Writ followed, on November 2, about the Castle. It is worth giving in the King's own words : \u2014 \" The King to Engelard de Cygon, greeting. What thou reportest thyself to have done in the matter of the swine\" (probably alluding to some garrison stores) \" is well done. And al though it may be better worth while to restore the Castle of Lude lawe (to Lacy) than to pay 40 merks per annum for its custody, yet keep you the said Castle in our hand, and let Walter de Lacy have the vill according to the agreement between him and us, because we don't wish to flinch from the said agreement.\"10 On Dec. 26, 1214, King John, being at Worcester, commands Engelard de Cygoin to allow Walter de Lacy to have all the fran chises which Hugh de Lacy his Father rightfully had in Henry II's time. The Sheriff is to support and protect Lacy, his tenants, and his property.11 In the next year (1215) we have innumerable in stances of the favour and trust with which King John at last re garded this influential but often disloyal Baron. Walter de Lacy is onewhile charged with commissions of great import in Shropshire, Staffordshire, and Herefordshire ; at other times he is found in the King's Court. The King allows him to hunt in Dean Forest, pre sents him with a Destrier, prevents his being unduly taxed, gives him custody of escheated lands, and releases his Brother William from a four-years prison, Walter beiDg one of the Manucaptors for the said William's future fidelity. The more important negotiations of that year were as follows. On March 15, Lacy proffered a great Fine to King John at The Tower. Till he could satisfy the King on the subject of this Fine {i. e. his means and securities for paying eomato acknowledged himself to have re ceived 30 merks of this Tallage. The Vill of Ludlow is charged with the Balance. (Rot. Pip. 2 Hen. Ill, Salop.) It was paid in the following year. 8 Patent, pp. 112, 113. 9 \u25a0 10 Claus. I, 175, 173. 11 Claus.

These Documents the King lodged at the Temple, and undertook, by Patent, to restore them to Lacy when he (the King) was satisfied as aforesaid.13 On the 12th of April the King ordered Engelard de Cigoyn to deliver up to \" our faithful and beloved Walter de Lacy, his Castle of Ludlow.\"13 On July 6, Walter de Lacy had not yet found the security for his Fine about his Irish estates, but the King orders the Keepers of his Irish Castles, no less than eight of which are named, to deliver them up to Lacy the instant that the Viceroy should inform the said Keepers of the security aforesaid being found.14 It is evident that part of this security was that Gilbert, the eldest son of Walter de Lacy, should be given up as a hostage to the King. The youth reached the King at Ludgershall (Wiltshire) on July 9th, and a Patent of the 10th certifies the fact.15 Lacy's Fine and Convention, or rather the restoration of his Irish Estates conditioned thereby, was to take effect from July 5, 1215. We have the document in full. \u2014 Lacy covenants to give the King 4000 merks to have his land in Ireland, now in the King's hand, viz. that land which he had on the day of his forfeiture. His Castle and land of Drogheda were however to be retained by the King for three years, with several provisoes in case the King's then intended Crusade {peregrinatio) should last a longer or shorter time than the said three years. The 4000 merks were to be paid in three instal ments (of 1000, 1500, and 1500 merks each) before Michaelmas 1216. Lacy was to find security for such payments before he had seizin, and his son was to remain a hostage for his loyal service till the money was actually paid. On the said son's being released, the King, if he chose, was to have another hostage, a legitimate son or daughter of Walter de Lacy, if he had either. The Fines (on any grant or renewal) with Lacy's Irish Tenants were to be the King's up to July 5, 1215 ; those subsequent were to be Lacy's. The Knights Hospitallers of London were to keep this and all other writings made between the King and Lacy, till the Convention should be fulfilled. The Viceroy of Ireland, if he could only get security for one of the four thousand merks, was not on that account to delay the proposed restoration, for the hostage given by Lacy was sufficient security for the residue.16 Patents of July 27 and Aug. 1, inform Lacy's Tenants in Meath, 12 \u25a0 13.14 patentt pp 131, 132, 148. 15 Patent, p. 149.

On Sept. 13, the King orders that all instalments of Lacy's fine, received in Ireland, be lodged in the Church of the Holy Trinity at Dublin.18 The year 1216, the last of John's life, can only be called conven tionally the last of his reign. Practically his kingdom had departed from him. Nevertheless Walter de Lacy, like other Barons of the West, forgot all former grievances, and was found loyal at the last. A letter of King John to his Irish Viceroy, dated April 12, implies that Walter de Lacy had paid 1000 merks of his Fine, and prolongs the terms at which the remainder was to be exacted.19 Similar marks of favour, and many proofs of trust, continue to occur in the King's Writs of the succeeding months. A Patent of July 30th may be only apparently of another complexion. \u2014 The King, not liking that there should be so many boys (hostages) in Devizes Castle, takes measures to remove Walter de Lacy's son from thence and to bestow him in custody somewhere in the Marches of Wales.20 On August 8th, the King appoints Walter de Lacy one of the Keepers of Elmley Castle.21 On August 18th, he appoints him Sheriff of Herefordshire, and Walter de Clifford junior is to give up the Castle and County to his Keeping, for as long as the King shall please.22 On the same day the King restores to him three Irish Castles which his Brother Hugh and another had held in his Fief.23 A Patent of August 19th is a startling document for Eng lish ears. It allows and gives license to the faithful and beloved Walter de Lacy that, if Louis (Prince Louis of France was then in England) should come and besiege Hereford Castle so that the siege could not be raised without the intervention of an army, \u2014 that in that case Lacy need not venture his person within the said Castle during the siege, but only see that it be garrisoned by those who might be trusted, as surely as Lacy might, to defend it without loss of the King's honour and advantage.24 On August 30, Walter de Lacy appears as Custos of the vacant See of Hereford.25 An act of October 10th indicates not merely King John's deference to Lacy's 20 . 21 \u2022 22 . 23 . 2J patentt pp. 191, 192, 193, 194. 17 Patent, p. 151. 18 Claus.

The King gives a tract of land in Acornbury Forest to Mar garet de Lacy (Walter's wife) whereon she may found a house of religion for the souls of William de Braose her Father, Matilda her Mother, and William her Brother.28 This reminiscence of his for mer victims was addressed by John to Walter de Lacy himself, \u2014 as Sheriff of Herefordshire I presume. Lacy was with the King or coming to him at the time ; for he transacted business for him at Lincoln on October 17th.27 On the 19th King John died. There seems never to have been the least interruption to the good understanding which existed between King Henry III and Walter de Lacy, from the date of that Prince's accession to the day of his great Vassal's death. Lacy was continued seven years in the Shrievalty of Herefordshire, sometimes accounting himself, some times by a Deputy. The Royal Writs to him in that capacity indi cate the greatest favour and confidence. Other Writs of the young King tend to give full effect to his Father's Charter, and to Mar garet de Lacy's efforts in relation to her proposed foundation of a House of Religion at Acornbury. Others again, addressed to two successive Viceroys, insist upon that full restoration of Walter de Lacy's Irish estates which had been guaranteed by the Con vention of 1215. Lacy meanwhile appears to have remained in England. In 1218 his Shropshire Fees, estimated to be seven in number, are assessed to the first Scutage of Henry III. In 1221 he has quittance of the Scutage of Biham. On the 24th of April 1222, I find that he was in Ireland, having gone thither in the King's service.28 Later in the year, he is seen to have been active in recovering his lost estates, the King still urging the Viceroy, by letters, to assist him. On December 27th, 1222, we have notice of Gilbert, a younger Brother of Walter de Lacy, crossing the Channel as a King's Messenger to the second Brother, \u2014 Hugh Earl of Ulster.29 Before July 1223 Walter^de Lacy had returned to England. A Patent dated at Worcester on the 5th of July offers safe-conduct to Lewellyn, Prince of Wales, if he will meet the King at Ludlow.30 Henry however does not seem to have visited Ludlow on this oc casion ; probably because his offer was declined. He remained at Worcester nearly a fortnight longer, and then went southwards. On July 14 I find Walter de Lacy superintending his successor in the I 28 '29 Claus. I, p. 493, 527.

Shrievalty, in respect of certain works at Flereford Castle.31 In August 1223 Walter de Lacy had Quittance of the Scutage of Wales, in respect of his lands in seven Counties, viz. Shropshire, Hereford shire, Worcestershire, Wiltshire, Staffordshire, Gloucestershire, and Oxfordshire. In the four first Counties he was further empowered to levy an Aid on his Tenants, \" wherewith to sustain himself in the King's service.\"32 A Writ of November 16 following, informs the Viceroy of Ireland that the King still retains Walter de Lacy for his service in England, and desires that all Suits commenced against the said Walter since he left Ireland shall be adjourned till Easter 1224.33 That Feast found Lacy indeed in Ireland, but on other busi ness than litigation. The Earl of Ulster and the men of Meath were in rebellion against King Henry, and Walter de Lacy had been sent to subdue his own brother and his own Vassals. A Writ of March 30th, 1224, certifies these facts to the Sheriff of Herefordshire, who is consequently desired to exact no Suit of County or Hundred from Walter de Lacy's demesnes during his absence.34 Another Writ of the same day enjoins the Viceroy of Ire land to provide accommodation in Trim Castle for Walter de Lacy and his Followers, so long as the said Walter should be in that quarter, levying war on the enemies of the King and of himself.35 A Patent of the 15th of April 1224, which commands Walter de Lacy to give custody of Ludlow Castle to William de Gammages, must, under the circumstances, be taken as a security for his fidelity while in Ireland.36 In this year his Shropshire Fees were acquitted of the scutage of Bedford. A Writ of April 21, 1225, mentions incidentally a Cantred in Ire land sometime given by Walter de Lacy in marriage with his daugh ter Egidia to Richard de Burgh.37 Another Writ of April 2.2 men tions William de Lacy (Walter's brother, I presume) as if under es cheat. Before May 13 Walter de Lacy had fined 3000 merks with the King to have seizin of all the lands in Ireland which had be come forfeit by the rebellion of Hugh de Lacy or his Tenants, ex cept the lands of three of the latter who had already come to terms with the King. Lacy's Fine covenants for further privileges, and inter alia that he may have the Castle of Ludlow which the King had retained in his hand because of the late war.

The Earl was to give Lacy seizin accordingly.38 On October 5 of this year I find a Certificate that Lacy was in the King's service in England,39 and on the 22nd the King gives him some indulgence as to the term of paying one in stalment of his fine.40 A Writ of March 23, 1226, shows that the King still retained Walter de Lacy in England ;41 another, of July 4, would imply his previous return to Ireland; for it informs Geoffrey de Mariscis (now Viceroy) of the particulars of the said Walter's Fine, and enjoins him, on having security for the residue thereof, to give Lacy its benefits.42 A Writ of January 6, 1227, shows the King supporting a construction of this Fine which was in Lacy's favour ;43 but later Writs show that Lacy was dealing harshly, not only with his Bro ther's Tenants, but with his Brother himself, towards whom the King appears to relent. At the same time that the King defers to the previous discretion of Walter de Lacy, in retaining certain of Hugh de Lacy's Castles, which the King had ordered him to re store, the King enjoins that the adjacent territories be at least given to Hugh, and adopts a plan by which the responsibility of restoring the Castles would devolve on himself.44 In 1229 and 1230 Walter de Lacy's Shropshire fees (still re puted to be seven) were acquitted of the scutages of Keri and Brit tany. A Patent of April 20th, 1230, dated at Portsmouth, names him among those whose property etc. was to be protected while they were with the King in foreign parts. The arrangement thus indicated was probably reversed soon after; for in July 1230, the King of Connaught, hearing of the King's absence in France, attacked the English in Ireland, and was defeated with enormous loss by Geoffrey de Mariscis, the Viceroy, two di visions of whose army were commanded by Walter de Lacy and Richard de Burg.45 In 1231 Walter de Lacy was assessed to the scutage of Poitou, in respect of his seven Shropshire Fees, and paid a part of the charge. In 1232 he was excused his contribution to the Scutage of Elvein. About the year 1233 died Gilbert, the only son and the heir-ap parent of Walter de Lacy.

A Patent of that date assigns to her and to him the Castle and Honour of Ewyas-Lacy, as Isabella's dower out of the estate of her former husband. I have said that Gilbert de Lacy left at his decease a son Walter. This fact, hitherto unnoticed by any Genealogist, is embodied in a Charter which belongs to the very year at which our narrative has arrived. The said Charter moreover informs us that the elder Walter de Lacy was that year in Ireland ; it tells us too of the kingly state which he kept there, and how meanwhile he managed his English estates, and especially his great Castle of Ludlow.46 On the lst of August 1234, Walter de Lascy, being at Trim in Ireland, certifies that he has given and conceded to William cle Lucy, for his homage and service, the Stewardship {Scenescalitiam) of all the lands which he (Walter) then had, or might by any chance have, in England. Likewise he gives to the same William two caru cates of the demesne of his Castle of Lodelawe. The said William and his heirs were to hold the said Stewardship and land, of the Grantor and his heirs, in fee. In consideration of the said two carucates, William and his heirs were to be Constables of Lodelawe Castle, which they should keep, or cause to be kept, at their own cost for ever. They were further to maintain a Chaplain, a Porter, and two Sentinels there, as they had been maintained aforetime. This was to be the Rule when the Grantor or his heirs proposed to make any short stay at Ludlow Castle ; but, in time of hostility, the Grantor and his heirs should garrison the Castle, and the Grantee and his heirs should remain in the Outer Bailey, so long as such garrison should be there.47 The Grantee and his heirs were further to take, in the Grantor's absence, such rates {prisas), taxed upon bread and beer, in the vill of Ludelawe, as the Grantor had been accustomed to take, or could lawfully take, when present. The re pairs which William de Lucy and his heirs were to do at the walls and dwellings of the Castle, were to be at the Grantor's cost, under view {i. e. valuation) of two lawful men of the Vill.

If William or his heirs, by command of the Grantor or his heirs, should go anywhither on the Grantor's territory to hold a Court, to audit accounts, or expedite other of the Grantor's affairs, they should be provided in all necessaries of food and drink for themselves and five horses. Further the Grantor would provide, for the Grantee and his heirs male, all garments and accoutrements as for a Knight of his own household. Lastly, if Walter son of Gilbert de Lascy, when he should be of age, should wish to have the aforesaid two carucates in his own hand, he should give the Grantee a fair equivalent elsewhere. This Charter was witnessed by Sir Richard Bishop of Meath, Sir Geoffrey de Marisco,48 Symon de Lascy, Almaric de Lascy, Symon de Tylleshope, Michael de Criktot, Philip de Wichecot, Hugh de Stanton then Chancellor to Walter de Lacy, and William de Ponte Clerk, the Notary who drew up the Deed. It was attested by the Grantor's seal, charged with a simple Fesse, the well-known cogni zance of his House. At Michaelmas 1235, and Easter 1236, the Aid in marriage of the King's Sister was assessed on eight fees of Walter de Lacy in Shropshire. The first moiety of 8 merks was paid by hand of Ro bert de Stanton.49 On the 24th of February, 1241, the King had heard of Walter de Lacy's decease, and ordered the Sheriffs of Herefordshire and Shropshire to take custody of his lands.60 Mat thew Paris dates the death of Walter de Lacy as about Easter 1241. 51 In his old-age he had lost his sight, and suffered from many other infirmities. The Chronicler justly gives him the pre eminence among all the Nobles of Ireland, and adds sententiously, but not accurately, that he left his inheritance to be divided among his daughters?2 Walter son of Gilbert, and Grandson of Walter de Lacy, died in infancy between the years 1234 and 1241. The heirs of Walter de Lacy Senior, were his two Granddaughters Matilda and Margaret, of whom I shall speak presently. His wife Margaret survived him, and on June 25, 1241, had respite of a debt of \u00a312. which she owed the King for certain chattels which she had had out of the estate of her deceased husband.53 A Writ-Close of November 26 Hen.

I now arrive at a somewhat difficult subject, \u2014 rendered so, partly by an accidental similarity of names, partly by the errors of former Writers. Instead of commenting unnecessarily on these errors, I will follow my usual plan of quoting authentic Records in chrono logical sequence. Where such Records exist, the conclusions which they suggest will seldom be found uncertain or untrue. On February 19, 1244, the King commands the Sheriff of Here fordshire to value and make equal partition of the lands, late Wal ter de Lacy's, in that County, and to deliver one portion thereof to Peter de Geneva and Matilda his wife, granddaughter {nepteni), and one of the Coheirs of the said Walter. The other portion, belong ing to Matilda's Sister, was to be as yet retained in the King's hand.54 Peter de Geneva, here mentioned, was a Provencal of mean birth, but a great favourite with King Henry III, who having the Ward ship of the granddaughters of Walter de Lacy, gave the eldest in marriage to this Foreigner.55 On March 15, 1244, the King commands John le Strange, Justice of Chester, to deliver to Peter de Geneva \" the Castle of Ludlow, which belonged to the said Peter's wife.\"56 A Certificate of June 25, 1245, shows that the King had allowed to Peter de Geneva \u00a3100. per annum at the Exchequer, till certain portions of his wife's inheritance should be delivered to him {donee dotes57 de h\u00e6reditate uxoris su\u00e6 deliberentur) . This annuity was now being commuted for Crown-grants of another kind, not relevant to our subject.58 In this same year, seven knights'-fees in Shropshire were assessed, in the name of Walter de Lacy, to the Aid in marriage of the King's daughter. The assessment was \u00a37., whereof Margaret de Lacy (Walter's Widow, I presume) paid \u00a35., and \u00a32. remained due. The Scutage of Gannok, at 3 merks per fee, was also assessed in 1246 on Walter de Lacy, but no instalment on this debt of \u00a314. was paid at the time. Meanwhile, that is, on December 19, 1245, it appears that nearly \u00a31000. had been owing by Walter de Lacy to certain Jews, whose 54 Rot.

The King excused Peter de Geneva and Matilda his wife their moiety of this debt ; but the moiety of John de Verdun and Margery his wife (Lacy's other Coheir) was to be by them accounted for.59 In 1248-9, Peter de Geneva was appointed Governor of Wind sor and two other Royal Castles ;60 but in the course of the latter year he died.61 Consistently with this date, in October 1249, we find Matilda de Lacy singly impleaded at Westminster, by the Widow of one of her Shropshire Tenants, for dower.62 Matilda de Lacy had issue by Peter de Geneva a son and a daughter ; but it is evi dent that the former died in infancy. She remarried to Geoffrey de Genevill, whom Dugdale (misled by the similarity of the names Geneva and Genevill) has erroneously set down to be her Son. The first that I hear of Geoffrey de Genevill is in October 1253, when he and Matilda his wife appear as having jointly the Seigneury of the same Shropshire Manor, for dower in which Matilda had been singly impleaded in 1249.63 Geoffrey de Genevill or Join ville was of the town so named in Champagne. He was son of Simon de Joinville by his second wife Beatrice of Burgundy. His usual style was Joinville de Vaucolour to distinguish him (says my authority64) , from his Brother Sir John de Joinville, of whom I shall say some thing hereafter. On September 18, 1254, King Henry III, by Patent, restored to Geoffrey de Gyanvill the Castle of Trim in Ireland, as the right of Matilda de Lacy his wife?5 In this same year the Aid for knight ing Prince Edward was put in charge ; but the Shropshire Fees of Lacy were not mentioned in the Assessment for that County. It is clear to me that at this time no final partition had been made between the Coheirs of Lacy. As to Ludlow Castle, I suppose it to have been in the hands of Geoffrey de Genevill, but the Inquisitions of 1255 do not so much as mention his name.

We must learn the same from subsequent Records. In the same year the Scutage of Wales was assessed on no part of Lacy's Shropshire Barony, but John de Verdon appears under military summons as a Baron-Marcher. On December 24, 1263, John de Verdon was named with Roger de Mortimer, John fitz Alan, James d'Audley, and Hamo le Strange as one of the King's Commissioners for Keeping the Peace in the Counties of Salop and Stafford.

Backed by Lewellyn he first took the Castles of Hereford and Haye and devastated with fire and sword the estates of Roger de Mortimer of Wigmore. Hugh de Mortimer of Richard's Castle surrendered that fortress and his own person to the Earl. Lud low Castle was in turn reduced. Finally at Montgomery, Roger de Mortimer was constrained to come to terms with Montfort, and, as we are told, gave hostages in pledge of his peaceful intentions.70 There may be some doubt whether these statements are not ex aggerated. Their Author was a zealous anti-royalist, a believer too in the miracles and the sainthood of Simon de Montfort. The Con tinuation of Matthew Paris (a Chronicle supposed to be another work of the same Rishanger) repeats the story of Montfort's cam paign with very little variation, \u2014 except that it places the whole series of events in the commencement of 1265.70 On the whole I think it probable that about this period Ludlow Castle was actually won by the Barons ; for Rishanger enumerates Lodelawe among the places which were reduced by the Lords Marchers immediately after Prince Edward's escape from Hereford and before the Battle of Evesham.70 Rishanger's admission of the recapture of Ludlow is perhaps the best proof of his veracity in regard to its previous cap ture. After these troubles, viz. in January, 1266, a Writ of the King orders that all Law-Suits wherein John de Verdon was Plaintiff, should be postponed till Easter Term.71 A partition of all the fees pertaining to the Barony of Lacy seems eventually to have been made between Geoffrey de Genevill and John de Verdon. The lat ter, whose remaining history I will now give, accompanied Prince Edward in the Crusade of 1270. His wife Margery de Lacy was already deceased, and, about a year after his departure, his eldest son by her, viz. Nicholas de Verdon, died also. It is evident that during John de Verdon's absence this Nicholas was to stand seized of a part of his Mother's Barony.

This Fine, says the Record, was levied with the assent and by will of the King. Peter de Genevill, thus enriched, died, as I have already shown under Stanton Lacy, in 1292, and in the lifetime of his Fa ther and Mother. He left three daughters, his heirs, by Joane his wife above mentioned. Peter de Genevill's interest in Ludlow is stated in the Inquest on his death, to have consisted of, \u2014 The Castle ; five merks of rent from his share of the Vill ; two-thirds of two carucates of land yielding 10 merks ; and tolls of the Vill, which, together with Fairs, Pleas, and Perquisites, yielded \u00a34. per annum?6 The Sequel is well known. \u2014 Two of Peter de Genevill's daughters, Isabel and Beatrice, became Nuns at Acornbury, while Joan the other daughter carried the whole inheritance of Genevill and a moiety of the great estates of Lacy to her husband Roger de Mor timer Earl of March.87 Hence it was that Roger de Mortimer and Theobald de Verdon were described as joint Lords of Ludlow in the Feodary of March 1316 :88 hence it was that so many of the Lacy Charters above quoted were at one time extant among the Muni ments at Wigmore Castle.

The existing remains of that noble fortress have been explored and illustrated by Writers fully competent to such a business, \u2014 a busi ness which, except incidentally, does not come within my proper scope.

In treating of this question I must appeal to a species of historical evidence, very satisfactory in itself, but so seldom available, that I have not, in these pages, had occasion as yet to allude thereto. \u2014 I mean the evidence of Coins. Our Anglo-Saxon Monarchs permitted or encouraged Mintmen to exercise their craft in every quarter of the Kingdom. It is pro bable that these Artisans were controlled in their operations by some central authority. A passage in King Canute's Laws further inti mates that each Mintman worked under the surveillance of the Geres a or Reeve of the Town in which he resided ; for in Towns only were they permitted to dwell. Athelstan was the first Anglo-Saxon King in whose reign the money was generally stamped with the name of its place of coinage. In his reign Shrewsbury had its Moneyers ; and Coins of Edgar, Ethelred II, Canute, Edward the Confessor, and Harold II, are known to have been minted at Shrewsbury. It does not as yet ap pear that any money was coined at Ludlow so early as the reign of Athelstan, but the subsequent series is more complete than that of Shrewsbury. Coins were struck by Ludlow Moneyers in the reigns of Edgar, Edward II, Ethelred II, Canute, Harold I, and Edward the Confessor. In all cases the name of the place is given, either as Lud, Luda, or Lude?9 Some other coins stamped Ludan, Ludo, and Lyda, are not taken into this account, nor will I venture to say that one of William the Conqueror's coins, stamped Ludeie, came from a Ludlow Mintman. I believe that no later coin which can possibly be ascribed to a Ludlow Moneyer has been discovered. The licensed coinage of this Borough therefore ceased in or before the reign of William I, viz. at or about the very period when, on inde pendent historical grounds, we should have expected it to cease. The Pr\u00e6positus said by Domesday to be resident at Lude, must be taken as the Reeve, or Chief-Officer of the Borough, under Roger de Lacy. After that period we have no allusion to the municipal affairs of Ludlow till the reign of Henry II, and then I can find but three. The first of these is in the year 1180, when William de Ludelaw (perhaps Provost here) was amerced \u00a32. 6s. Sd. by Ranulf de Glanvill, because he wrongfully seized a pack-horse belonging to the Knights Templars.90 Some question of toll on the one hand, 89 For most of these particulars I refer to Ruding's Annals of the Coinage, Vol. I, p. 131, et seq. ; Vol, II, p. 209. 90 \" Quia cepit equitaturam Templa riorum injuste.\""], [325, "281 THE BOROUGH. and the immunities of this privileged Order on the other, had, I conclude, given rise to this decision. It is very remarkable that the two other instances in which Ludlow occurs in this reign should both refer to matters of coinage. I could imagine that local tradi tion had preserved some knowledge of the coining which had for merly been permitted there, and that some of the inhabitants were tempted to use this knowledge for unlawful purposes. I should pre mise that owing to the adulterated state of the coinage, Henry II, in 1180 or 1181, called in the old money and issued new.91 It does not appear that trading with the old money was at once made illegal, but I could quote several instances to show that the legal value of the old money became from 10 to 20 per cent, lower than that of the new. Consequently traders, who used old money as equal in value to the new, acted fraudulently. There was an Assize, or Law, for the purpose of restraining such practices, and, though the Statute itself seems to be lost, the Pipe-Rolls of that period give us several instances of its application. Among others the Hereford shire Pipe-Roll of 1183 records the following amercements by Tho mas fitz Bernard and his associate Justices. \u2014 \" Roger de Ludelaw owes six merks of old money, of which he was an Exchanger;\" and again \" Roger Young {Juvenis), of Ludelaw, renders account of 20 merks because he bought and sold with old money, contrary to the Assize,\" that is, without properly allowing for its depreciated worth. The latter delinquent had probably traded to some effect, for he was able to pay 14 merks of his Fine at once. In 1187 Robert Marmion and his Associates visiting Shropshire, amerced Herbert Provost of Ludelaw \u00a35. His offence was that he had not produced before the Justices a certain Money-forger, who had lodged in his Borough.92 I have already mentioned the cotem porary amercement of Hugh de Esketot for not producing a certain woman who had dealings with Money-forgers.93 His penalty is fol lowed by those of Roger Young {Juvenis) in 15 merks, William the Money er {Monet arius) in 5 merks, and Walter Smith {Faber) in 3 merks, for the same offence. One of these persons certainly, and all probably, were Burgesses of Ludlow. At the Assizes of 1203 the Vill of Ludelawe appeared as an in dependent Liberty, but no presentments of its Jurors are entered on the Roll. The Justices amerced Basilia de Ludelowe half a merk for breaking some assize; also Roger theMoneyer, and William the narium coram Justiciariis.\" *> Supra, Vol. IV, p. 368. 38 91 Ruding (ut supra, Vol. I, p. 171). 52 \"Quia non habuit hospitem falso- I V."], [326, "282 LUDLOW. Moneyer his Brother, were amerced 9 merks and 20s. for a like offence. These three names follow each other on the Roll, and I think that these two Monetarii were of the Ludlow family so named. At the same Assizes Walter de Mucegros essoigns himself against William Clerk of Ludlow, in a plea of appeal. This plea was alto gether withdrawn soon after. It appears that a certain Richard Auceps (Fowler) lodging in the house of Edelina de Ludlow, had risen in the night and carried off all the plunder he could collect. The Vill of Ludlow followed him with hue and cry {levato clamore) and he was killed. William Clerk had fined 8 merks to have an Inquest held as to his share in the matter. He was now pronounced blameless. This affair is placed among the presentments of Muns low Hundred. At the Assizes of 1221 the Vill of Ludelawe ap peared by its Provost and twelve Jurors. No special entry was made of their presentments. On December 17, 1232, a Patent issued conferring facilities for a plan of enclosing the Town of Ludlow with a Wall. At Robert de Lexinton's Eyre in 1240, the following amercement was recorded. \" The whole foreign Court {Curia forinseca) of Walter de Lacy of Ludelauwe, except the Borough, renders account of 15 merks for two Robbers wrongfully released.\" The Curia forinseca here spoken of, was probably that of Stanton Lacy Liberty : if so, the distinction from the Borough Court is well shown. Half the fine was paid iu 1242. It appears that in 1252 the Men of Montgomery having obtained a Charter of Privileges from the King, had used the said Charter to the disadvantage of the Men of Ludlow. A Writ of August 20th in that year directs that it shall be ascertained by Inquest \"what Franchises the Men of Ludlow had enjoyed in the King's Town of Montgomery previous to the said Charter?\" The answer was that at all previous periods the Men of Ludlow had exercised all manner of trading at Montgomery, and had both bought and sold as freely as the Men of Montgomery themselves, without paying any toll and without suffering any hindrance.94 The Inquisition of 1255 tells us nothing of any customs or pri vileges exercised by the Municipality of Ludlow. The fact of a separate Inquisition being taken, shows of itself that this was an 94 Inquisitions, 36 Hen. Ill, No. 26 \u2014 Castle. Both incidents doubtless result ed from a state of things, in the time of Henry I or Stephen, of which no direct memorial exists.

In 1256 the Borough of Ludlaw ap peared at the Assizes by its Bailiff, Richard de Chabenoure, and twelve Jurors. A Patent of July 1260 empowers Geoffrey de Gene vill to levy customs, or murage, for five years, towards walling the Town. Similar Patents for Murage at Ludlow occur in 1267, 1272 (where Theobald de Verdon is the Patentee), 1280, 1285, 1290, 1294 (where Geoffrey de Genevill is again the Patentee), 1301, and 1304. To return, \u2014 on October 1, 1267, John de la Lynde, a King's Jus tice, presided at an Inquisition at Ludlow. The case was one of homicide in self-defence ; but the man tried, as well as the Jurors, belonged to a distant part of the County. Perhaps therefore the visit of John de la Lynde was for the general purposes of Assize, and in continuation of his recent sittings at Shrewsbury. It is the only instance which I have found of Ludlow being thus visited. At the Assizes of 1272 the Borough of Ludlow was represented by Richard de Momele (its chief Bailiff) and twelve Jurors. At the Inquisition of 1274 the Jurors of this Borough had various acts of oppression and extortion to complain of, as committed against mem bers of their community by public Officers or the Retainers of neigh bouring Barons. John Baril, late Under-Sheriff of the County, Hugh de Dudmaston, and Thomas de Grete, sometime Bailiffs of Munslow Hundred, John de Blecchedon Constable of Wigmore, William Mauveysin Constable of Richard's Castle, John de Aqua Constable of Corfham, the Serjeants {servientes) of Munslow Hun dred, the Bailiffs and Foresters of Wigmore, \u2014 all these had committed some injustice on the Borough, its liberties, or inhabitants. I will give one or two specimens of these complaints. \u2014 There was a quarrel between the Community of Ludlow and William le Gardiner, a Fellow-Burgess. The latter sheltered himself under the patronage {advocacionem) of Sir Roger de Mortimer (of Wigmore). Then came the Bailiffs and Serjeants of Wigmore, and entering on the Liberty and free demesne of the Lords of Ludlow, took the cattle feeding therein, and drove the said cattle to Bromfield, where, by the said driving, a certain heifer, worth 4s., was lost. Again \u2014 On St. Laurence's-day (Aug. 10) 1274, at Ludlow Fair, Arnold de Brondesleg, with his Son, and with Luke Beadle of Cleobury (Mor timer) arrested, and proposed to take away and imprison at Cleo bury, Roger Tyrel, Custos of Caldeford Gate. Roger's offence was that he would not allow these men to pass the said gate with the oxen which they had purchased in the Fair, unless they produced their"], [328, "284 LUDLOW. tallies ; he, Roger, being posted at the gate and sworn in for this very duty. Hereupon the three wounded him in such a way as to draw blood, and took from him some chattel,95 worth 12c?. But Thomas de Wulfreslauwe, Bailiff of Ludlow, came up with his Ser jeants and found the trio taking off the said Roger like a Prisoner, and within the Liberties of the Town ; \u2014 and the Bailiff would fain have released him, when Hugh de Don vill, then Bailiff of Stottesden Hundred, with a great posse, interfered, intending to arrest and take away the Bailiffs (of Ludlow) and their Serjeants, and when he (Donvill) was unable to do this, he took from them some article95 worth 8^., by violence and force. Again, \u2014 John de Aqua, Con stable of Corfham, extorted from Richard de Olreton, a Burgess of Ludlow, 45s. 7d. on the following pretext : \u2014 A cart of Sir John Gif fard's was driving through Ludlow and smashed a certain caldron ; the carter not having wherewithal to pay the damage, voluntarily gave up a horse out of his team, so that the aforesaid Richard (owner of the Caldron) was recompensed. But when the said John de Aqua heard of the affair, he caused the cattle of Dame Sibil de Olreton at Clee St. Margaret, to be attached ;- -and detained the said cattle eight days till (Richard de Olreton) fined 60s. for his act ; of which fine as aforesaid he had, under constraint, already paid 45s. 7d?6 An Inquest taken in September 1283, shows that Ludlow had the usual privilege of a free Borough, viz. that the corporate body was sufficient for the discharge of certain responsibilities which in unchartered towns were an excuse for the interference of a Sheriff, an Escheator, or other Officer of the Crown. A messuage in Lud low, late in the tenure of a convicted Felon, was, according to Law, the King's, for a year and a day ; \u2014 after which Term it ought to revert to the Tenant, holding over the outlaw. The question in this instance was whether the messuage formerly held by John de Brumesgrove, a Felon, under Agnes widow of Gilbert le Mareschal, had so been in the King's hands for a year and a day. The answer was in the affirmative; that is, the Borough of Ludlow held the pre mises, and was answerable to the Crown for the issues thereof.97 An Escheator's Roll, about a.d. 1325, supplies an instance of a con trary kind, viz. where the Crown interfered in the concerns of Lud low in a summary, and, as I think, a most vexatious manner. \u2014 Theo bald de Verdon, late Tenant-in-capite of half the Vill, had conveyed to one Nicholas de Rughton 7 acres in Ludlow, without first ob- 95 Hackam denoscham :\u2014\" A Danish 1 axe,\" says Mr. Wright (Hist.

The premises had been confis cated on this ground, and were still in the hands of the Escheator, who accounts 6s. 80?. for the issues thereof.98 I now return to an earlier period, and propose to give the names and some other particulars of the principal Burgesses of Ludlow in the thirteenth Century. \u2014 In 1210 we have three Fines whereby Warin de Grendon, Plain tiff, quit-claims three several thirds of a Messuage in Ludlow to Andrew fitz Milo, William Falconer, and Roger fitz Osbert, who pay the said Warin 3 merks each. Gilbert Young {Juvenis) was an Attorney in the case. In Trinity Term 1220, Adam de Dublin and Agnes his wife, re mit their claim on a third part of a messuage in Ludelaw for 10s., given by Alan Swein, Robert Faber, and another.99 At the Assizes of 1221 it appeared that a certain Hugh had for merly given to William Faber of Stanton a merk in frank-marriage with his daughter Hawise, \" according to the Law of Bretoil ;\" i. e. Bristol;1 but Hugh, not having the merk at hand, mortgaged half a messuage in Ludlow for that sum, to his said son-in-law. After wards Nicholas Bum, the son of Hugh, and therefore the Brother of Hawise, redeemed this mortgage, and then enfeoffed Wimund fitz Wimund in the whole messuage. On William Faber's death Hawise remarried to Roger Faber of Stanton, and the two sued Wimund fitz Wimund as having no ingress in the premises save through William Faber, whom, whilst living, his wife Hawise could not con tradict. They asserted in short that the half messuage had been given out-and-out to Hawise in frank-marriage, not mortgaged only. The Jury found otherwise ; so Wimund and Nicholas were dismissed sine die? At these same Assizes, Roger fitz Milo sued Robert fitz Roald for half a messuage in Ludlow, but the latter did not appear.3 In October 1227, Amicia widow of Geoffrey Dames, remits for 16s. to Nicholas Fisher {Pistor) her claim to dower, viz. to one-third of a messuage in Ludlow.

At the Assizes of January 1256, Geoffrey fitz An drew, Peter Milisent, William de Radnor, Thomas Mympe, Richard Balls, William Coterel, Geoffrey le Dunan, Henry fitz Meiade, Ralph Goldsmith, Roger Feremon, Nicholas Fisher, and Roger de Hesford (Ashford) were the Ludlow Jurors.

The result of this Statute is imme diately seen in the Fines of the period. All the following convey tenements to the Grantees ; \u2014 \"to have and to hold ofthe Chief Lords of the Fee,\" and reserve nothing to the Feoffor whose interest of course vanishes. In short they represent absolute sales rather than subinfeudations. \u2014 November 1290. William Schekenhurste and Alice his wife con vey a Messuage in Ludlow to Roger Foliot who gives a sore hawk.

Among the presentments of these Jurors was one which I believe reveals to us the original condition of the great and prosperous fa mily of Ludlow. \u2014 Laurence de Ludlow, the Founder of that family, was, as I have shown under Stokesay, already Lord of that Manor and Castle. The Jurors of his native Town spoke of him in 1292 in a very different capacity. He had been selling cloth, contrary to the Assize. Doubtless then Laurence de Ludlow acquired his great wealth as a Ludlow clothier. There are other evidences that the trade of Ludlow was at this period very prosperous, but Laurence de Ludlow may be considered as the type of a class, the creature of a social change. It was not till the reign of Edward I that mer cantUe wealth could thus readily be exchanged for territorial im portance."], [337, "291 THE CHURCH. Subsequently to the Assizes of 1292, the following Ludlow Fines occur, bringing the series down to the close of Edward I's reign. \u2014 November 1293.

Looking at the circumstances of the surrounding district I should imagine Ludlow to have been originally in the Parish of Bromfield, and so Ludlow Church to have been originally a dependency of the Saxon Church of St. Mary's of Bromfield. For the word originally, a very wide meaning is here bespoken. \u2014 The earliest existing Re cords give not the slightest hint or trace of such a dependency, and this silence, though it does not disprove the fact, proves that any such fact must have belonged to a period far too remote for Anti quarian research. If there was already a Town at Lude in the reign of Athelstan, there was probably also a Church or Chapel. We have given some proof that there was such a Town, and according to the validity of that proof we infer that Ludlow Church or Chapel was founded at least 150 years before Domesday. There is another consideration which suggests a high though still indefinite antiquity for this ecclesiastical foundation. \u2014 In the end ofthe tweUth century (the year 1199) a story was palmed off upon the inhabitants of Ludlow which bespoke for their Town and Church-"], [338, "292 LUDLOW. yard, if not for their Church, an antiquity of something more than six hundred years. However exaggerated this estimate may have been, it is obvious that the Editors of the Story dared not to have uttered it, had they not believed that no stretch of traditional me mory could convict them of falsehood. Now it is probable that if the Church and Town of Ludlow were founded as late as the reign of Athelstan (925-941), there would, in 1199, have been some tra dition extant among the inhabitants which would have clashed with any theory implying that foundation to have been earUer than 600. Such a theory was however boldly propounded, and apparently without any fear of this kind of refutation. We may now detaU , the circumstances which seem to have sug gested and facilitated the invention and utterance of this Story. \u2014 In the year 1199, the inhabitants of Ludelau finding their Church insufficient for the increasing population of the place, determined to enlarge it. This they did by lengthening it towards the East. The only obstacle to their plan was a Lowe or tumulus in that direction, doubtless the very Lowe which had already given a distinctive name to the Town itself. This tumulus was levelled, and as we may weU believe, was found, during the progress of the work, to contain hu man remains. Now we shall hear what use the Clergy (Clerici) of Ludlow made of this discovery. \u2014 They asserted that these human remains were the bodies of three Irish Saints, who, as far as I can make out from other evidences, must have lived and died in the sixth Century. The Ludlow Clerks carefully coUected these re mains, deposited them in a wooden Coffer, and decently placed the whole, on April 11th, inside their church, \"covering them up,\" says the Narrator of the 'transaction, \" till such time as the Lord should \\g pleased to perform certain virtues (miracles are meant) by the merits and intercessions \" of the said Saints. The motive thus assigned exposes the whole affair. Ludlow Church must at the time have been slenderly endowed; for its Parish was small. Its Clerks had in short few tithes, and what was worse they had no reliques. This source of income, which could no longer be spared, was supplied by the above device. I must not however leave this matter without noticing the proof which the Ludlow Clergy offered as to the identity of the disen tombed skeletons. \u2014 On one of the three was found a Scroll, rolled up and preserved, \u2014 inwardly by wax, outwardly by lead; which Scroll declared as follows, but in the British tongue. \u2014 Hie requies ettnt S. Ferc/ar, pater Brendani, beata pignora, sancti scilicet Iber-"], [339, "THE CHURCH. 293 nensis, pulchrd lapide et solo inclusd.

Hie nempe quindenis deguerunt annis, dum sanctorum Britanni\u00e6 adirent patrocinium post obitum Lud\u00e6 increduli.16 The three Irish Saints then, said in 1199 to have been found buried at Ludlow, were first, St. Fercher the Father of St. Brendan, secondly, St. Corona the Mother of the same St. Brendan and the Aunt of St. Columkill, and thirdly, Saint .... Cochel the brother of Saint Corona. These three, said the Scroll, \" lived on the spot for fifteen years, what time they adopted the protection of the Saints of Britain, distrustful\" (of their native country, I presume)- \" after the death of Luda.\" Now without any disrespect to the memory of the Irish Saints of the sixth century, and without any deep knowledge of their respec tive relations, I venture to state that they were not related in the way that this ScroU intimates ; moreover that the Scroll was written, waxed, leaded, and buried in the Ludlow tumulus, within a few days before its discovery. However, though this ScroU was a mere fraud, and though it tells us no truth as regards Irish Sainthood and Irish Martyrdom, we may use it for another purpose, viz. to illustrate the Priestcraft, as well as the local history, of the time and place at which it was writ ten and discovered. The Ludlow Clergy resorted to Ireland for the materials of their myth, because such a plan was less open to jealousy and detection than if they had tampered with an English Legend. They were also (these Clergy) possibly Irish themselves, some or all of them ; at all events they lived at a time and in a place when and where Irish ideas will have been very current, for the passing and repassing of De Lacy's Clerks and Retainers between his Eng- lish and Irish estates must have been constant. I now proceed to another subject. \u2014 It may be taken as a general axiom that our parochial and ecclesiastical boundaries are much older, and have been preserved far more intact than our civil and manorial boundaries. When therefore Ludlow is found in all writ ten Records to have given name to a Deanery, we might be inclined to assume, on this ground, the great ecclesiastical antiquity of Lud low. I believe that such an assumption or inference would not be sound ; for it is certain that some Deaneries have taken their names from towns which have come into existence since the Conquest. 16 Wright's Ludlow, p. 14, note."], [340, "294 LUDLOW. All that can be said therefore on this head is that Ludlow is, and has been during aU memory, the Caput of a Deanery, that it pro bably became so before the Conquest, but that possibly it attained this eminence since. In 1291 the Church of Lodelawe, in the Deanery of Lodelawe, was valued at \u00a313. 6s. Sd. per annum?7 The Inquisition of March 1317, taken on the death of Theobald cle Verdon, values his moiety of Ludlow Church only at \u00a33. 6s. 8d. per annum. In 1341 the slender acreage of Ludlow as a Manor prevented its being taxed according to its Church value, and under the Deanery of Ludlow. It was taxed as a mercantile town, and by verdict of a special Jury, which valued the Ninth of the moveable goods of the Burgesses at \u00a372. 12s. lid. This great assessment (far larger than that of Shrewsbury, and fourfold that of Bridgnorth) indicates an acquired wealth rather than a growing prosperity in this Borough. \u2014 The Jury thought fit to give several reasons why they had not assessed Ludlow still higher. These reasons are interesting and instructive, if I may pre sume to interpret them ; \u2014 for though I think the Verdict to be in telligible, it is certainly not grammatical. \u2014 I understand it to have been represented that several Merchants of Ludlow (among whom were Roger de Orleton, Nicholas Eylrich, Dionisia de Orleton and John de Lynie), who had been used in times past to give & fifteenth of their goods to the King, coidd not now give any tax, because the King had taken from them their goods and chattels, in the shape of wool, both at home and abroad. A general plea of poverty seems to have been further set up for the above and other merchants of Ludlow. As to those Burgesses who lived by agriculture, their in come arose from without the Vill, and in sundry other parishes, so that they were already taxed elsewhere to a ninth of their wheat, wool, and lamb. The latter kinds of produce it is intimated did not form any part of the Revenues of the Church of Ludlow, so that it would have been unfair to have taken the Church Taxation as in dicating any such properties of the parishioners as were now pro posed to be taxed.18 On the whole then Ludlow was assessed, not in respect of any increasing trade or agricultural wealth, but on the moveable goods of its inhabitants, that is, on their effects and pro- 17 Not at \u00a33. 6s.

The Valor of 1534-5 gives the Rectory of Ludlow, then held by John Crage, as worth \u00a320. per annum, viz. \u00a319. 13s. 4d. for tithes, and 6s. Sd. for glebe. The only charge on this income was 7s. 8d. for Archdeacon's Procurations and Synodals.19 EARLY INCUMBENTS.

Ludlow Hospital was founded between the years 1220 and 1230 by Peter Undergod, a rich Burgess of Ludlow. It was dedicated to the Holy Trinity, St. Mary, and St. John the Baptist. It stood on the North side of the Teme, near the Bridge;\u2014 a situation which (like that of St. John's Hospital at Bridgnorth) was evidently selected with a view to the future usefulness of the establishment as a Hospital or Hospice. The Founder, Peter Undergod, had pur chased the site of this House from one Walter fitz Nicholas. He had bought lands at Akes (now Rock) from several persons, and he had bought a Fulling MiU in Ludlow (to which aU the Fullers of the town owed suit) from Gilbert son of Walter de Lacy. These, with all his other purchases and possessions in Ludlow, Ludford, or elsewhere, he conferred on the Hospital. It is probable that he was himself the first Custos of this House ; for his Foundation-Charter, which is extan' speaks of the Brotherhood as already assembled, and only directs tV mode in which a Custos or Master shaU be appointed, as a step to be taken after his own decease. For other particulars I refer to the Charter itself, which was attested by Sir Walter de Lacy, Sir John de Monemue, Pagan de Ludford, Pagan CarbuneU, Phihp de ColevUe, and Edmund de Ludlow.29 Sir Walter de Lacy, as Seignoral Lord, confirmed to Peter de Undergod his purchases from * * * * Malore, in Akes, and approved of the said Peter's having appropriated the same to this Hospital. Sir Walter, moreover, for the souls of himself, his wife Margery, and his son GUbert, concedes this confirmation as a gift in frank-al moign, remitting aU rents and services heretofore accruing to him self from the premises. He also enumerates and allows Peter Under god's other grants to the Hospital. His Charter was attested by Sir John de Monemue, Walter de Pegerton, Richard de Midlehope, Master Richard de Cranefeud, Master John Eaton, Philip de Thaig land (Thongland) * * * de Greete, WiUiam de Ponte-cUvo, and Richard de Pipe, Notary of the Charter.30 This Confirmation was probably cotemporary with the Foundation-Charter above quoted. It was inspected, recited, and confirmed by a Charter of King 29 Monasticon, VII, 681, Num. i. 30 Ibidem Num. ii. There seems to have been a 'second Charter of Confirma- tion by Walter de Lacy.

Henry III, dated at Kenilworth on the 18th of July in his fiftieth31 year, i. e. 1266. The Inquisition of 1255 erroneously attributes it to a grant of Gilbert de Lacy that the Brethren of Ludlow Hospital then stood seized of five burgages and a Mill there, worth 40s. per annum. The Jurors reported another acquisition, viz. of a messuage worth 4s. per annum, the gift of Roger Eylrich Senior.32 In 1267 I find the Master of the Hospital of St. Mary of Ludd laue fining half a merk for some Writ.33 I must refer to other Au thorities for later additions to Peter Undergod's Foundation.34 In 1534-5 John Cragge, the Master of this Hospital, is styled its Dean. I doubt if he were not the same with the Cotemporary Rector of Ludlow. The Hospital Revenues were (in gross) as fol lows : \u2014 From Rocke (formerly Akes), \u00a37. 10s. 2d.; \u2014 from Hawke batch (near Dowles), \u00a31. 11s.; \u2014 from Overton (Richard's Castle), \u00a32. Os. 8c?.;\u2014 from Ludford, \u00a33. 14s. 5d.;\u2014 from Ludlow, \u00a311. 2s.; \u2014 from Demesne-Lands, \u00a35. This Revenue was chargeable with certain Quit-rents, viz. : \u2014 to the Lords of Rocke, 8s.; to the Dean of Lichfield, for Hawkbatch, 4s.; to William Wollascote, for Ludford, 8d.; to the Bailiff of Ludlow, \u00a32.; to the Chamberlain of Ludlow, 10s. The net income of the Hospi tal was set down as \u00a327. 16s. 7d. The Hospital at this time sup ported two Chaplains, who performed services for the soids of its Founders at a salary of \u00a32. each, per annum. It gave \u00a33. 6s. 8d. 'early (in alms) to the poor, 13s. 4d. to its -own Steward, and \u00a32. 13s. 4d. to a Receiver. The King had one Coirody in the House worth \u00a34. per annum?5 The Master and Brethren of this Hospital conveyed it, with all its possessions, to Edmund Fox by a Lease, dated 20th September, 1535. This step was anticipatory of, if not identical with, its Dis solution, and it had the consent of the Crown. The lengthy docu ment from which I gather this, shows that a larger Salary was sub sequently secured for the two Chaplains above mentioned, and was stiU chargeable on the Hospital Estates.36 This was probably be cause the said Chaplains continued to perform divine service in the King's Chapel of St. Peter within the Castle of Ludlow, \u2014 a Cure, for 31 Not anno quinto as printed in the Monasticon.

The Friars of St. Augustine were established in or near Ludlow at least as early as the year 1282, when their Prior is mentioned as a witness of a curious natural ph\u00e6nomenon described already.37 Again we have mention of these Friars in 1284, when King Edward I, after receiving the report of a local Inquest, issued a Patent in their favour.38 The Inquest alluded to sat on January 24, 1284, and found that it would not injure the King or any other, if the King allowed the Prior and Brethren of the Order of St. Augustine of Ludlow to en close with waU and fence, and to keep enclosed, a certain lane {ve nellam) contiguous to the space {are\u00e6) already occupied by the Fra ternity in the Suburbs of Ludlow. The said lane extended from John le Hor's messuage in Holdestret (Old-street) to the Street called Galdeford.39 The next that I hear of this Establishment is in a letter of Swin field, Bishop of Hereford, dated August 16, 1299, and addressed to King Edward I. The Bishop earnestly complains of a violation of Sanctuary committed by the men of Ludlow, in that they had drag ged from the Church of the Friars of St. Augustine, nigh Ludlow, a Clerk who had fled thither for his life.40 For the particulars of a later grant to this Friary I refer elsewhere ;41 as also for an account of a House of \u2014 CARMELITE OR WHITE FRIARS\u2014 sometime estabUshed in Ludlow, but the Foundation of which pro bably belongs to a period later than that to which I ordinarily wish to confine myself. Some other Religious Houses had interests in Ludlow, of which I should take brief notice. Wenlock Priory Fee.\u2014 This in 1255 consisted of 7s. 6d. rent, arising from three messuages granted to the Priory by Walter de Brug, Alnoth Red, and Richard Palefrey before the year 1241.42 These Rents or part of them appear still with the Priory shortly before its Dissolution ; e.g. about 1516, the Sacristan of Wenlock 37 Supra, Vol. IV, p. 250. 33 Rot.

Sd. rent from Ludlow,43 and some other Officer of the Con vent had a second rent of Is. 6d. from a tenement in Ludlow.43 Also about 1520 the Infirmary of Wenlock had a rent of Is. 6d. from St. John's Hospital at Ludlow for a tenement there.43 Wigmore Abbey Fee. \u2014 This consisted of four messuages, given by Burgesses of Ludlow to the Abbey before 1241, and yielding in 1255 a rent of 8s. 2d. After the Dissolution, viz. in 1539-40, the Ministers' Accounts give two rents (of Is. and 6s. 8d.) in Ludlow among the receipts of the late Abbey.44 Cresswell Priory Fee. \u2014 Walter de Lacy, who founded this Priory, gave thereto the ninth sheaf of grain, except oats, in his Manors (Demesnes) of Ludelawe, Stanton (Lacy), and Akes in Shropshire. He also gave a man in Ludlow, viz. Stephen the Soap boUer {saponarium) , with aU his lands, tenements, and suit (family). This grant was confirmed by Henry III on August 21, 1231, which gives the latest limit of its date.45 In 1255 the Ludlow Jurors re ported the Prior of CrassewaUe as having one Burgage in the Town of 12d. annual value, and one shop {soldam) bringing in 4d., both of the gift of Walter de Lacy.46 I find no later notice of these in terests of CressweU Priory. Knights Hospitallers' Fee. \u2014 This consisted of no less than twelve Burgages and two virgates of land, in the Town and Manor of Ludlow, granted by the elder Hugh de Lacy47 to the HospitaUers seated at Dinmore in Herefordshire. In 1255 the twelve Burgages realized 12s. rent to the Commandery of Dinmore, but the two vir gates of land had been assigned by the Order for the maintenance of the Chaplain of St. Leonard's Chapel in Ludlow j48 \u2014 but where St. Leonard's Chapel was, or aught further about it, I cannot de clare. The Jurors of Ludlow further reported how four of their Townsmen, viz. Nicholas le Savoner, Robert de Brug, Thomas de CapeUa, and Adam Cotele, had become Tenants of the Hospitallers of Dunmore, for their land in the vill of Ludlow, for the sake of obtaining the Advowry or patronage of the said Order.48 This Ad- vowry freed its possessors from all those imposts from which the 43 Wenlock Register at Willey, sos. 30, b;31, b;40, b. ris.\" I do not understand why Hugh de Lacy, who died in 1185, should be called vetus.

I should here state the grounds which induced the men of Lud low in 1269 to assault Reginald fitz Stephen, as before alluded to.49 He was clearly one of those who had this Advowry of the Hospital lers, and on the strength thereof he dechned to pay any local clues. All parties agreed to refer their disputes to Sir Geoffrey de Genevill and Sir Martin de Littlebury (a Justiciar of that period) . The Ar bitrators decided that, in respect of the tenement which the said Reginald held under the Hospitallers, he should be free of tallages and gelds, but that he should be in scotto et lotto with the other Burgesses in respect of aU other tenements, and in respect of all mercantile transactions by him done.60 49 Supra, p. 286.

Two Manors, Cantelop and Lege, held by Normannus under Earl Roger, are mentioned consecutively, and both are apparently assigned to Conodovre Hun dred} As regards Cantlop there can he no doubt that this arrange ment was correct ; but it is probable that the Domesday Scribe omitted to give in the margin the proper Hundred of Lege. I have pointed out under Albrighton that the ordinary succession to Nor mannus Venator was in the family of Pichford.3 This consideration suggests that Norman's Manor of Lege was the Manor now known as Lee-Brockhurst. Lee-Brockhurst certainly descended to the Pichfords, and unless it be identical with the Lege held by Nor mannus, it has no Domesday representative at all. When I come to Lee-Brockhurst I shall strengthen my argument by showing that Norman Venator's interest in that quarter is established by evidence independent of Domesday. At present it is sufficient to have determined that his Manor of Lege must not be looked for in Condover Hundred. With this exception, the annexed Table ad heres to the letter of Domesday. One or two questions of identity I leave to be discussed under the Manors themselves. When the Hundreds of Shropshire were re-arranged in the time of Henry I,- that of Conodovre remained intact, except that one Manor, Ratlinghope, and with it perhaps Overs, were annexed to Purslow Hundred. Thus things continued till nearly the close of the twelfth century. Further changes took place both then and in the thirteenth century; and all changes, of whatever date, have been in the way of diminution. The general result is that the modern Hundred of Condover contains nothing which was not con tained in the Domesday Hundred, but, at the same time, it is 2 Supra, Vol. II, pp. 149, 150. 1 Domesday, so. 259, a, 1.

Edbaldinesham (now Edgebold) was detached from Condover Hundred under the construction put by Roger de Mortimer on the Charter which he obtained from Henry III after the Battle of Evesham. This place has since been annexed to the Liberties of Shrewsbury. 8. Sheinton, another of Mortimer's Manors, was similarly sepa rated from Condover Hundred in the time of Henry III. When Mortimer's Franchise was abolished, Sheinton seems to have been disposed of according to a most fantastic rule of official routine. Because forsooth it had been for a time a reputed member of Cleobury Mortimer, it was, like Cleobury Mortimer, annexed to the distant Hundred of Stottesden.

Polehe (now Pulley) was a divided Manor at Domesday. It is easy to see how Mortimer's share thereof, having first been extra hundredal, fell afterwards, like Edgebold, to the growing Liberties of Shrewsbury. It is not so easy to determine why the other share (Teodulf's) should have been severed from Condover Hundred. It became a Serjeantry, and so a Tenure-in-capite ; but which of our Kings permitted its annexation to the Borough Liberties I cannot discover. 10. Welbatch by some unknown but very imaginable process has been annexed to the Liberties of Shrewsbury. 11. Womerton, probably as having been sometime an Escheat of the Crown, was annexed to the Royal Manor of Church Stretton. It is now, like Church Stretton, in Munslow Hundred. Enough has now been said on Condover Hundred as a territory. I proceed to add a few notices of the Hundred Court or Jurisdic tion, \u2014 its Proprietors, its Officers, and its value. In Edward the Confessor's time two-thirds of the profits of this Hundred-Court belonged to the King, as Lord of the Manor of Condover : the third penny, as it was called, probably belonged to the cotemporary Earl of Mercia ; but this fact, not recorded in Domesday, rests on the analogy of Morville and such other Royal Manors as were Heads of Hundreds. At Domesday Earl Roger de Montgomery had the whole profits of Condover Hundred, a circumstance illustrative of his Palatine dignity, \u2014 his combination of the prerogatives both of King and Earl. Earl Roger was moreover Seigneural Lord of every Manor within the Hundred, except five at most. Of these two were Ralph de Mortimer's, two the Bishop of Chester's, and one belonged to the Shrewsbury Church of St. Chad, but under whom it was held is not quite clear.3 It is worth a passing notice, how nearly the 96^ hides which Domesday assigns to this Hundred, approximate to the hundred hides which some authorities deem to have been- the original essence of the district called a Hundred. When we consider that Domesday does not record the hidage of a part of the Manor of Lege (now Longnor), this approximation is still nearer. On the forfeiture of the Norman Earls, Condover Hundred was retained by the Crown. Its revenues from the reign of Henry II 3 This was Little Eaton, near Pitch- I of its tenure I reserve till we come to the ford, \u2014 a Manor now lost. The question | place itself."], [449, "7 CONDOVER HUNDRED. to that of Edward I constituted some unknown part of that annual ferm of .\u20ac265. 15s., for which the Sheriff was responsible at the Exchequer. The Sheriff in turn underlet this and other Hundreds to certain Fermors or Bailiffs at as high a rent as he could obtain, while the efforts of these Officers to realize a profit, produced all those cruelties and extortions which we hear of in the Hundred- Rolls of 1255 and 1274. At the Assizes of 1203, five cases of murder and two breaches of the King's Peace were alleged by the jurors of this Hundred. In no instance do the charges appear to have been groundless, and the outlawry of the accused had resulted in the majority of cases. At the Assizes of 1221 I count no less than twelve murders or homi cides recorded for this district. Two of the victims had perhaps fallen in some foray, for the murderers were Welshmen unknown. In the Inquisition of 1255 it is stated that the Sheriff of Shrop shire received 12 marks from the Hundred of Condover, that is, the Fermor of that period paid him so much.* At the Assizes of 1256 the Hundred appeared as usual by its twelve Jurors, but the name of the Fermor or Chief-Bailiff is not given. At the Assizes of 1272 William de Munslow appears in that capacity. The Jurors reported the then value of the Hundred to be 7 merks. This de crease was probably in consequence of the number of Manors which had withdrawn their Suit from the Sheriff's Tourn. Besides certain legal withdrawals, already enumerated, the Vills of Acton Burnell, Acton Pigot, Langley, Belswardine, Church Preen, and Holt Preen are mentioned as arrogating this immunity. In 1274, the value of this Hundred to the Crown is put at 6 merks. The Inquest charges the withdrawal of the Suits of Belswardine, Sheinton, Great Preen, and Little Preen on Richard King of Almagne ; \u2014 the accuracy of which statement I shall discuss hereafter. The successive Officers of the Hundred are charged with acts of extortion and wrong, being in each instance called Beadles or Sub-beadles, that is, I think, Deputies of the cotem porary Bailiff. Roger Howe, John le Rotur, and Henry de Astone seem to have been in office together as Beadles of this Hundred, but at what period previous to 1274 does not appear. John de la Hull and William de Baschurch, the Beadles of 1272-3, were recent and notorious oppressors. William de Munslow is noticed as a venal officer, but his actual position as Bailiff of the Hundred is not specified.5 4 Rot. Hundred. II, 63. | 5 Rot. Hundred. II, 91, 92."], [450, "8 CONDOVER. At the Assizes of 1292, Roger de Frodesley appeared as Chief- Bailiff of Condover Hundred, which was again valued at 6 merks per annum. Among the Vills which no longer did suit to the Sheriff's Tourn, we have not only Belswardine, Acton Burnel, and Acton Pigot, but Betton Strange, Alvithele, and Alvythemere. It is singular that we should thus hear of the two last-named places, for where they were, or what was their status, I shall find it difficult to show with any certainty. Cantiotor* Among the Shropshire tributaries of the Severn, the stream which traverses the Manor of Condover is not the least. The stream and river unite indeed more than four miles to the East of this Village ; but, though their confluence is thus distant, it fur nishes us with the etymological origin of the name Condover. The village of Cound, which stands much nearer to the point of junc tion, is probably a very ancient settlement, for it is nothing else than the Celtic word Cond, signifying an embouchure.1 The meaning of these primitive names was unknown to the Saxons, who consequently designated some later foundations by titles altogether inept. We have already had a probable instance of this in the case of Ludford.3 Another is now before us. The Saxons, on their arrival, found a place called Cound, or Conede. They established another place higher up the same stream, and called it Conedovre, that is, Over-Conede, or Upper Cound. This they did, not knowing, or forgetting, that the word Conede, or Cound, was proper only to a place situated at the disemboguement of some stream. Condover was in Saxon times a Manor of Royal demesne, and Caput of the Hundred to which it gave a name. The first Norman Earl of Shrewsbury retained more than half the Manor in demesne, and was also sole Lord of the Hundred, \u2014 as we learn from the following passage in Domesday : \u2014 \"The Earl himself holds Conendovre. King Edward held it. To this Manor appertain ten Berewicks. Here xm hides are sub- 1 See Harlshorne's Salopia Antiqua, I pp. 91, 92. 2 Supra, Vol. V, p. 238."], [451, "9 CONDOVER. ject to Geld. In demesne there are seven hides, and thereon are iiii ox-teams; and xn Villains, and a Priest, with vn ox-teams; and still there might be in additional teams thereon. Here are viii Neat-herds, and a Mill of 8s. 6d. (annual value).\" \" Two (out of every three) pence (arising) from the Hundred of Conendoure used to belong to this Manor. In King Edward's time the Manor yielded \u00a310. (per annum). Now, together with the Hundred, it yields \u00a310.\" \" Of the land of this Manor Roger Venator holds i hide, Osbern i hide, and Eluuard iiii hides. Thereon is one team; and mi Villains, n Boors, m Radmans, and n Neat-herds have, among them all, in ox-teams; and still there might be vm teams more (on this portion). The whole (of this portion) is worth 41s. (per annum).\"3 Earl Roger then, it seems, had given three feoffments in his Manor of Condover. Only one of these, viz. that of Roger Ve nator, had any permanence. I shall show, under Great-Lyth, that the Barons of Pulverbatch (Roger Venator's descendants) retained an interest in Condover Manor till the thirteenth century. Osbern, the Domesday -Teaszat of one hide in Condover, was probably iden tical with Osbern fitz Richard, Baron of Richard's Castle. We have seen that in respect of other tenures under the Earl, Domesday designates this great Feudatory by his simple name Osbern; we have also seen that in two instances (Brockton and Ryton) his in terests descended not to his successors.* Analogy justifies us in assuming that his share of Condover was similarly re-annexed to the Palatine demesne. As to Elward's greater share of the Manor, that, with Elward's other Domesday estates, undoubtedly reverted to the Crown, and probably by forfeiture. King Henry I, when he constituted the Honour of Montgomery , annexed most of El ward's lands thereto, but it seems that the King retained the four Condover hides in his own demesne. On the whole, then, it is probable that, whether by forfeiture of the Norman Earls, or by other acts of resumption, Henry I. was seized in demesne of the whole Manor of Condover, except the Tene ment of Roger Venator. We know little comparatively of this great King's daily movements or local predilections. That little must therefore be taken as the more largely significant. If from scanty Records we find that the King visited Condover thrice, or, 3 Domesday, so. 253, a, 2. VI. 4 Supra, Vol. II, p. 62. 9."], [452, "10 CONDOVER. at least, twice in his reign, we may well imagine that it was a favourite residence. In the year 1121-2, or else in 1126-7, the King is known to have been at Norton. A Precept which issued on that occasion has been already set forth in these pages.6 It was attested singly by Bernard, Bishop of St. David's. I have identified the place at which this Precept passed with Norton, near Condover, not from any mistaken idea that the latter Norton was a member of Condover, and so a part of the Royal demesne, but because of another and very similar precept, which passed either in 1115-6, or else between 1121 and 1123, and which I now proceed to quote : \u2014 \" Henry King of England, to Richard Bishop of London, and to all Sheriffs in whose Bailiwicks the Abbot of Shrewsbury holdeth lands etc., \u2014 greeting. I enjoin that Godefrid Abbot of Shrewsbury hold' his lands and all his effects in peace and quietude, and that he do not plead concerning any land, or Church, or Prebend, or any other thing which Abbot Fulchered, his antecessor, may have held on the day of his death, nor give answer to any one touching the same, except in my presence (coram me). Witnesses, \u2014 Richard Bishop of London, Bernard Bishop of St. Davids, Robert Bishop of Chester, and Hamo Peverel, at Conedover.\"6 The materials from which I infer that Henry I was at Condover, once, if not twice, at a much later period of his reign, have already been given,7 and the Charter which then passed the Great Seal shall be more fully set forth under Brompton. The question whether Henry I granted any feoffment in Con dover, is one for future consideration. The Manor reached the hands of Henry II as one of ancient demesne, whose proportionate value in the Firma Comilatus was \u00a312. 13s. per annum. A small grant of land made by Henry II in Condover did not affect this arrangement. The Sheriffs' accounts during his reign and the reigns of his two sons, Richard and John, imply that the fiscal value of the Manor remained unabated by any grant, small, or great. Before I proceed with other details, it will be better that I should speak on the subject of \u2014 Tallages, \u2014 as levied upon Condover and other Manors of Royal Demesne, for the use of Henry II and his three successors. I have already given the Tallages of Shrewsbury and Bridg north,8 as well as those of Claverley, Worfield, and Nordley Regis 5 Supra, Vol. I, p. 34. \u2022 Supra, Vol. I, p. 247. 6 Salop Chartulary, No. 43, c. s Supra, Vol. I, pp. 295-297."], [453, "11 CONDOVER. during the period in question.9 I here add, in a tabular form, the Tallages of seven other Royal Manors and one Royal Borough, leaving all account of the irregularities with which the impost was levied till I come to the places specially concerned TABLE OP TALLAGES IN SHROPSHIRE The mode in which Royal Manors were managed by the suc cessive Sheriffs or Fermors, the wasted state in which they were occasionally found, and the process of restocking them, \u2014 these are matters in which Condover was affected, like other Manors of the same class.

Early in the reign of Henry III the history of Condover becomes associated with more important events. That Prince, from the day of his succession till the eighth year of his reign, had found in his Brother-in-law, LeweUyn, little else than an open enemy or a trou blesome neighbour. I refer elsewhere for a general account of the grievances, suffered or alleged by either party, and the diplomacy which perpetuated rather than settled the contest.30 Some further particulars I supply from original Records. On the 19th of Sep tembei', 1224, King Henry was at Worcester. He was there visited by the Welsh Princess Joan, the wife of LeweUyn, and his own half sister. What transpired we know not. The King passed on to Kidderminster, Bridgnorth, and Shrewsbury. From the latter place, ou September 24th, he issued a Writ to the Barons of the Exchequer, ordering them to give credit in the accounts of the She riffs of Shropshire for a sum of \u00a38. 7s. 4d., which the said Sheriff had expended by the King's command in the accommodation of the Welsh Princess when journeying from Wales to Worcester.21 The Pipe-Roll ofthe following Michaelmas shows that the Sheriff charged this exact sum against the Crown, and that it was allowed. The fol lowing year (1225) passed away in vain negotiations between Henry and LeweUyn, but a Patent, dated at Worcester on July 28, 1226, ensures safe conduct for the King's \" beloved Brother LeweUyn, Prince of North Wales,\" who with his Wife and Son were appointed to meet the King in conference at Shrewsbury. The parties met and the result was a peaceful one. On the 29th of August, the King, being at Shrewsbury, informs the Sheriff of Shropshire that \" he has committed to his beloved sister Joan, wife of his faithful and beloved LeweUyn, the Royal Manor of Cunedour, to be held by the said Joan so long as the King shall please.\" The existing Autumnal crops and the rents due at the coming Michaelmas the King re serves.21 It will be seen by the foregoing Table that Condover was exempted from the Tallage of 1227. The King relinquished his right, and iu lieu thereof the Sheriffs of Shropshire and Leicester shire were ordered to assess a reasonable aud moderate Aid on the Manors of Condover and Ralegh, which Aid the King had conceded for the uses of his Sister the wife of LeweUyn.22 In October of the same year the King's Justices visited Shrewsbury and amerced \u2022LeweUyn, Prince of North Wales, in the heavy sum of 50 merks. This was for some unspecified act of disseizin. Such penalties, whe- 20 History of Shrewsbury, Vol. I, p. 96, | et se1- 21 Claus. I, 647, b. Claus. II, 135. a Claus. II, 176. Patent. 11 Hen.

On May 16, 1228, Condover was again in the King's hands. A Writ-Close to the Sheriff of Shropshire, adverts to the fact of this resumption, but orders that Joan, wife of LeweUyn, shall be allowed to remove all cattle (averia) which she had on the premises.23 Other writs, dated at Hereford, on the 13th and 15th of August following, assure a safe-conduct for the Princess, who was proposing to come and con fer with the King at Shrewsbury.24 The King was at Shrewsbury on the 29th and 30th, but I find no indication that his Sister met him. The following month (September) presents LeweUyn in open rebellion. He had laid siege to Montgomery Castle, then held by Hubert de Burgh, the King's Justiciar. Henry raised the siege in person. The campaign of Keri, which followed, was a balance of petty successes on either side, and euded ostensibly in a pacification. A Patent of September 3, 1229, introduces a new person on the stage. David, son of LeweUyn, is coming to do homage to the English King at Windsor, and he and his Sister, who accompanies him, are ensured a safe-conduct. Another Patent of October 3rd, certifies that the act of homage had been rendered. The King, in return, presents his beloved Nephew with an annuity of \u00a340., soon to be commuted for a feoffment of 40 Librates of land, in case the King gave up his then proposed transfr et ation ; otherwise the lands should be conveyed as soon as the King returned to England. Con dover had at this time been restored to the Princess Joan : in fact, the Pipe-Rolls take no notice of the temporary forfeiture of 1228. At Michaelmas 1229, the Sheriff acquits himself of two sums of \u00a312. 13s. each, being the fiscal or reputed revenue of the Ma nor of Condover for the years ending Michaelmas 1228 and Mi chaelmas 1229. This fiscal value had been, as usual, determined by Inquest, but why the Sheriff did not take a similar credit for the year ending Michaelmas 1227, I cannot discover. Joan's te nure of the Manor is carefully noted on the Pipe- Roll as being limited by the Royal pleasure and as being De baillivo Regis, a term which I shall have to notice hereafter. To continue ; \u2014 the Tal lage of 1230 is seen, by the foregoing Table, not to have been assessed upon Condover. The Manor was stUl in the hands of the Prin cess Joan, and the Sheriff, as usual, discharges his Michaelmas 23 \u25a0 * Rot. Claus, and Rot. Patent. 12 Hen.

This arrangement ap parently continued up to Easter 1231 ; for, at Michaelmas of that year, the Sheriff speaks of Joan's Tenure of Condover in the pre terite tense, and assigns her only \u00a36. 6s. Gd. or one-half of the cur rent year's revenue. Another entry on the same Roll implies that the Sheriff himself was responsible for certain issues of the Manors of Condover and EUesmere since they had been seized into the King's hand. Ellesmere, I should observe, had been held by Le weUyn up to a recent period, under the English Crown. The year of which I am speaking (1231) was undoubtedly one of open hosti lity between England and Wales. It was the year in which Lewel lyn devastated the Marches from Brecknockshire to Montgomery, and in which King Henry prosecuted the campaign of Elvein with circumstances of no ordinary ferocity. The connection between Condover and the history of Wales ends here, but I have been care ful to mark the period of the Princess Joan's Tenure of the Manor for a particular reason. She held it till Easter 1231, that is, for a year after the time (AprU 1230) when LeweUyn is said to have de tected her in an adulterous intercourse with WiUiam de Braose, an English Noble. That LeweUyn put Braose to death, is on all hands confessed ; but that the act led to no immediate rupture between Henry III and his Sister Joan, is now apparent. Why the King of England thus temporized, is a question not easy to answer. Had he any secret understanding with his Sister? Was her unfaithful ness to LeweUyn of a pohtical character, and not that frightful episode of domestic crime which I have already questioned as so improbable?23 The statement of the Welsh Chronicler, that the Princess Joan survived till the year 1237, and was buried by Lewel lyn with circumstances of honourable distinction, is as yet uncon tradicted, and should have its weight in clearing her name of aU suspicion. Condover continued in the King's hands for seven years after the resumption of 1231. During that period, viz. in October 1235, the King ordered that Survey of the Shropshire Forests which has been already quoted more than once. The Visors reported, inter alia, on the state of the Bosc of Buriwude, which was appurtenant to the Manor of Condover. They found it \" much wasted from the time at which the Manor was in the hands of the wife of LeweUyn. 25 Supra, Vol. IV, p. 215, note 84 ;\u2014 where I quoted M. Paris as stating that the Princess Joan (as well as Braose) was executed by LeweUyn. This was a mere error, a misinterpretation of the passage in question."], [457, "15 CONDOVER. That Lady's Bailiffs had sold on one occasion 500 oak-trees from the wood, besides making other wastes. Moreover the trees had been stript of their branches on occasion of the war.\" Here the Record which I am quoting becomes defaced, but enough is legible to show that a scarcity of forage had necessitated this destruction of the oak-trees of Buriwude. This allusion I have no hesitation in ascribing to the war of 1234, commonly known as the war of Richard MareseaU. Matthew Paris describes how the Earl Mar shall leagued with LeweUyn devastated Shropshire to the very gates of Shrewsbury, and actually asserts that they burnt the town itself.26 The incursion was in January, and so does not immedi ately account for the devastation of the summer foliage of Buri wude ; but the scarcity which resulted in Shropshire throughout the year is matter of record, and this Forest- Survey perhaps supplies us with one instance of that consequent desolation. In 1235 Condover was assessed to a King's TaUage, but on June 11, 1238, the King gave Condover and five other Manors to Henry de Hastings and Ada his wife, in lieu of the said Ada's share of the inheritance of John Scot, late Earl of Chester, of whom she was Sister and coheir.27 I have related under Worfield how this grant took effect from March 1238.28 At Michaelmas 1242 the Sheriff deducts \u00a356. 18s. &d. from his own liabilities at the Exchequer, in respect of Cunedour, four and a half years' revenue of which Manor had now accrued to Henry de Hastings. From this period the history of the Seigneural Lords of Condover is as that of Worfield, except in the few particulars which I proceed to note. The King's Tallages were suspended ; but a Writ of 1246 allows Henry de Has tings to appropriate the TaUage of that year arising from Condover. After the death of Henry de Hastings in 1250, and during the mi nority of his Son, Condover fell into the King's custody. . About Easter 1252 it was entrusted to Guy de Rochfort (Rupe-forti) as Fermor thereof. The annual rent payable by him to the Crown was \u00a320. 13s. \u00a7\\d. At Michaelmas 1254 he accounts through the Sheriff for \u00a351. 14s. \u00a7\\d., or 2i years' arrears of this Ferm. The Inquisitions of 1255 found the Manor of Condover still in the same state. \" Gwido de Rocheford,\" says one Inquest, \" holds the Manor of Coned' by reason of the custody of Henry, heir of Sir Henry de Hastinges, which (custody) he (Rocheford) has by autho rity of the King. The Manor indeed was once the King's, and 25 See History of Shreicsbury, I, 111, for the probable meaning of this assertion. 2' Patent. 22 Hen. Ill, in. 4. 28 Supra, Vol. Ill, pp. 107, 108."], [458, "16 CONDOVER. was afterwards given to Sir Henry de Hastinges in exchange for lands in the parts of Cheshire.\"29 So far said the Jurors of the Hundred. The Jurors of the Manor itself said that the Manor was extended or valued at \u00a321. per annum, by which they meant, not its reputed fiscal value (which was still \u00a312. 13s.), but its actual income as ascertained more recently. Guy de Rochford's ferm of \u00a320. 13s. %d. added to the valuation of two small tene ments (3s. 4o?. and 4s. per annum) give a result rather higher than the aUeged Extent. These Jurors mentioned a local feature of some interest. The Extent or gross value of \u00a321. was inclusive of a sum of 2s., the reputed value of the Vivary of Buiemar'A0 now known as Bomer Pool. I have alluded under Worfield to the Escheatoris receipts from the forfeited Manors of Henry de Has tings. The issues of Condover from Feb. 2, 1266 to Feb. 4, 1268 were \u00a334. 4s. MeanwhUe Roger le Strange was entitled to the Fine payable by Henry de Hastings for the redemption of his lands under the Dictum de Kenilworth. A Patent of July 13, 1267 (which I have quoted under Worfield) was foUowed by another of September 23rd, to the same effect, viz. that Henry de Hastings should have no seizin of Condover, Worfield, and Wolverhampton till he had satisfied Roger le Strange in the matter of redemption. On the death of Henry de Hastings (about 1268), Condover, like Worfield, was for a time in the hands of Edmund Plantagenet, Earl of Cornwall. The Inquisition of the Manor, taken in No vember 1274, alludes to this circumstance quite incidentaUy.31 Meantime, that is in 1269, we find Condover to have been once more assessed to a King's TaUage, an intimation that the rights of any Fermor or Custos of an escheated Manor did not exclude this recurrent interference of the Crown. In October 1283 an Extent or Valuation of the Manor of Con dover was taken, by order of King Edward I, for some unspecified purpose. The Jurors who officiated were Nicholas de Felton, Roger de Chilton, John de Byrinton, Thomas Marscot, William Selimon, Adam fitz Margaret, Henry de Wesselegh, John de Pulilegh, WU liam de Fulewode, William de Lak, John Champneys, and William de Preston. They said that Condover was held de dominico Regis. Seventy-eight acres of arable and 4 acres of meadow land were in demesne. The capital messuage was estimated to be worth 6d. per annum (net value) . All the Tenants of the central Manor (that is, of Condover itself as distinct from its members) were Sokemen. 29 - M Rot.

Four Tenants of assarted lands paid Is. lid. rent. The Fishery of Bolemere was valued at 2s. per annum. The Pleas of Court were worth \u00a31. 6s. 8d. The net value of the Manor and its Members (hereafter to be noticed) was \u00a315. Is. 6^d. The Jurors remembered how King Henry III had had the Manor in hand under the Dictum de Kenilworth, and, according to their state ment, it was Hamo le Strange who primarily had custody thereof by grant of that King.32 The next feature in the history of this Manor is its transfer by John de Hastings to Robert Burnell, Bishop of Bath and Wells. The Deed of Conveyance exists only in an abridged form. Thereby \" John de Hastings grants to the said Bishop his Manors of Condover and Wolverhampton, the Bishop giving in exchange the Manor and Advowson of Woton near Northampton.\" The Deed is dated in 12 Edward I (1283-4), and is attested by WiUiam de Stapleton, Adam de Lacy, Robert de Stapleton, and John de Lee, Knights; \u2014 also by William Burnell, Richard Burnell, Engelard de PolUey, and Randulph de Harpcote.33 An Inquest taken in Condover Wood on May 7, 1292, found that the Crown would not suffer material injury by a project of Bishop BurneU's ; \u2014 viz. to enclose and cultivate 200 acres of his own Bosc of Condover. There were oak-trees only growing there, and no underwood. The King would lose any fines which might be inflicted for vert, and any profits of impounding goats and swine in the fence-month. Other parties having common-rights would be left with a sufficiency in the rest of the Bosc.3* The Inquisition taken in December 1292, on the death of Bishop BurneU, says that he had held Conedovere in capite, but by what services the Jurors knew not. The Assized Rents of the Manor were \u00a314. 5s. \\\\%d. The Pleas and Perquisites of Court were \u00a31. A Bosc, which was common to the whole Manor, both during the Mast season and at other times, only yielded Is. to the Lord of the Manor.35 The Inquisition taken in July 1294, on the death of PhUip Burnel states him to have held the Manor of Conedovre in capite, by service of finding 12 foot-soldiers for the Army of Wales.36 Another Inquisition as to the Tenures of Philip Burnel was taken under Writ of Certiorari, on Feb. 10, 1301.

Gunceline de Badlesmere was now in possession, pending the minority of Philip Burnel's heir.37 I have alluded, under Rushbury, to an Inquisition ordered 10th July, 1302, as to the waste aUeged to have been committed in certain estates of the Burnels by Gunceline de Badlesmere, then deceased.38 The inquiry extended to Condover, Langley, and Corfton, but with the same result as at Rushbury. In 1 Edw.

And if Cottars were admitted, or Cottages built, on that land, each Cottar should pay the Grantor Id. per annum and do suit to his Court of Condover. The Grantee was to pay a rent of 25s., and the Grantor retained the usual rights of wardship and marriage, when such should arise.

The gross income of the Manor was estimated as \u00a321. 14s. lO^dA The Return of March 1316, known as the Nomina Villarum, gives Alina Burnel (she was Edward Burnel's widow) as Lady of Conedovere.41 Having thus far treated of the Seignoral Lords of Condover, I now turn to speak of the Manor as an Independent Liberty, that is, as governed by its own community, though it happened also to be the Caput of a Hundred. Herein I shaU include whatever has to be said of \u2014 Under-Tenants in the general Manor, leaving those, whose Tenures are associated with any distinct Member of the Manor, for a more appropriate notice under the places of their presumed residence. In 1167 Alan de Nevill inflicted an amercement of one merk upon Condover, that is, I suppose, upon the community thereof. 37 Inquisitions, 28 Edw. I, No. 24. 33 Supra, Vol. IV, p. 97. and two.

In 1202 the Tithing (Thedinga)m of Cunedour was amerced one merk for some withdrawal (quia retraxit). By the word Tithing I here understand the Manor as distinct from the Hundred. At the Assizes of October 1203 the Manor of Condover was repre sented as an independent jurisdiction, but a space left on the Roll for a statement of its concerns was not filled up, either because they occurred incidentally in other parts of the Roll, or because they were entered on some other Schedule, now lost. At the Forest Assizes of March 1209, Robert, Provost of Cunedour, was assessed for an imbladement. At the General Assizes of November 1221, the Villata of Cunedour appeared by its Provost and six Jurors, but no presentments specially affecting the Manor, as distinct from the Hundred, were made. In 1231 Samson de Cunedour, as Surety for some one unnamed, was fined 3s. by Justices of the Forest. Next year Richard fitz Eldith of Cunedour appears on a similar list. In 1250 Geoffrey de Langley fixed arrentations on several persons in respect of parcels of Forest-land occupied by them in Condover and Ryton. A rood was thus assessed in the name of Nicholas Clerk, two acres in the name of WiUiam de Rutton (Ryton), three acres in the name of * * * de Cunedovere, and three-quarters of an acre in that of Geoffrey Mai. In 1255 separate Inquests were made as to the Manor and Hun dred of Condover. Among the seven Jurors who reported on the Manor, I here notice Walter Pik, Nicholas de la Stiwele, and Elyas de Cunedovere. To a question as to whether the Free Tenants and other men of the Manor gave due attendance to Summonses in general, or to the Summons now in force, the Jurors answered affirmatively, explaining that the community never put in an ap pearance, or an answer, save through six men and a Provost. To most of the questions propounded, their answers were still more laconic, and so convey little information beyond a general notion of the independence of the Manor.43 The Jurors of the Hundred, on the same occasion, reported how the men of Condover Manor and the men of Chattefort had rescued things taken in distress by the Bailiffs of Robert de Grendon, then Sheriff.43 At the Assizes of January 1256 the Manor appeared by its six Jurors, among whom were Richard Champiun, Geoffrey de Buton, 42 A Tithing, in Saxon times, was a I section of a Hundred. 43 Rot.

At the Forest Assizes of February 1262, on the List entitled Essonia Mortis, appear the names of William de Burton, Roger Bolemer, Walter Champiun, and William fitz Simon of Condover. Elias de Cunedoure was Essoignor of the first. At the Assizes of September 1272, John de Prestcote, Bailiff of the Abbey Foregate, was also Bailiff for the Manor of Condover, whUst Roger the Provost and Elias de Conedovere are named as Electors of ten other Jurors, who appeared with them for this Manor. Among the ten are Adam Faber, William Bulloc, WUliam fitz Hugh, WiUiam Binte, Nicholas Chese, Adam Hare, Roger Bulloc, Roger Gamel, and Nicholas Pyk. In November 1274, eleven Jurors reported on the state of this Manor. Nicholas de Botiton, Richard Colvox, Nicholas Pick of Ryton, John Methe of Ryton, WiUiam Bulloc, Richard Botte of Condover, Nicholas Young (Juvenis), Adam Faber, and WUliam fitz Reginald of Chatteford were of the number. They complained of the unjust and arbitrary distraints levied on the men of Condover by John de la Hulle and William de Bassechirch, who \"were Bailiff's of Condover with William Francis.\"44 By this they meant the Hundred of Condover, of which the said Officers are elsewhere spoken of as Bailiffs or Beadles. At the Assizes of 1292, Thomas de Walecote appeared as Chief Bailiff for this Manor : Roger and WUUam BuUok chose ten other Jurors, among whom were Richard de Haldenelde, WiUiam Clerk, and Richard de Chatteforde. BEREWICKS OF CONDOVER, I wUl name twelve places, ten of which I think may have been the Berewicks of Condover alluded to in Domesday. They are Dor rington, Chatford, Great Lyth, Little Lyth, Great Ryton, Little Ryton, Westley, Wheathall, GonsaU, The Sytch, AUfield, and Burwood. Of some of these I now propose to take distinct notice. Dorrington. \u2014 The Chief Forestership of Shropshire was an Office which I believe to have been founded and endowed by Henry I. He gave it, too, as I suppose, to Ulger the Hunter, of whom I have spoken under Bridgnorth,45 and whose descendants for many generations held the Office and were resident at Great Bolas. Among other estates given to this family was half a virgate in Dorrington. In the thirteenth century it was stated by Inquest that the ancestors of the then Chief Forester had this half-virgate 44 Rot. Hundred.

Robert fitz WUliam, Ulger Venator's grandson, was Forester of Bolas at the commencement of the thirteenth century. A list of Shropshire Serjeantries, drawn up about that period, inti mates that Reginald de Dodinton was his Tenant of half a virgate in Dodinton, the value of which was 40c?. per annum.*6 In succes sion to Reginald de Dodinton came Robert Champneys, whose son and heir, WUliam, was usually called WUliam Champneys of Dorrington, to distinguish him from a cotemporary of the same name who was resident at Wilderley. WiUiam Champneys of Dorrington acquired a smaU estate at Cothercote by marrying Alice, daughter of Baldwin de Cothercote. This estate he after wards sold to his brother-in-law, Roger de Cothercote.47 At the Inquests of 1255 the Jurors of both Condover Hundred and Con dover Manor reported the particulars of William Champeneys' tenure of half a virgate of land under John fitz Hugh, then Chief Forester of Shropshire. The Tenant's obligation was to take charge of the Cover of Stepelwood, a part of the Royal Forests. He seems also to have paid a rent to John fitz Hugh, viz. twenty discos and four ciphos, by which I understand dishes and cups. His duty is otherwise stated to have been the custody of Vert and Venison from The Quake-Wendebruge to Egeforde. His land was stated to be valued at 4>0d. per annum.is WUliam Champeneys himself was one of the Jurors for the hundred. An Inquest taken in March 1262 was attended by WiUiam Champeneis as a Forester of-the-fee. In April 1264 I find him Juror in an Inquest taken at Langley, and from that time tiU 1285 he is a frequent witness of local Deeds. In December of the latter year he appears, as a Forester of Shropshire, investigating a matter connected with the Haye of Shirlot,49 and in May 1292 as a Forester on a Condover In quest. Nothing later can I find referable to this family or Tenure. Other notices of this Vill or its inhabitants are as follows. \u2014 At the Assizes of 1203, it is entered under Condover Hundred that Jagow de Tang was a fugitive, for the murder of Richard de Dunninton. At the Forest Assizes of March 1209 the Vills 40 Testa de Nevill, p. 61, b. hold a half-virgate in Condover in the same way as William Champeneys, and by gift of Henry I.

In 1250, Geoffrey de Langley set an arren tation on three-quarters of an acre, tUled by Nicholas, son of Nicholas de Dodington. This or another Nicholas de Dodinton sat as a Juror for Condover Manor at the Assizes of 1256, 1272, and 1292. At the Forest Assizes of 1262 WilUam de la HuU of Doditon was assessed under Regard of the Long Forest. At the Inquest of Condover Manor in 1274 Adam de Dodinton was a Juror. By Fine levied at Salop, in November 1277, WUliam Dun of Eton, and Margaret his wife (Impedients), for themselves and the heirs of Margaret, acknowledge their gift of a messuage and Bovate in Derigton, to Hugh, son of Hugh del Hulle (Plaintiff) ; the latter to pay a rose-rent, and to discharge all capital services. Twelve merks were given for this. According to the Extent of 1283, nine virgates in Dodinton yielded 61s. rent to the Lords of Condover. At the Assizes of 1292 Richard de Doditon was a Juror for Condover Manor. There are many indistinctive notices of other persons named from, or connected with, some Dorrington, Ditton, or Donington in Shropshire. These I must omit altogether, for where nine or ten places are concerned, the chances against a conjectural allocation are formidable. Great Lyth. \u2014 When we see Earl Hugh de Montgomery grant ing two-thirds of the Tithes of his Demesne of Lid to Shrewsbury Abbey, it is possible that a part of his Condover Demesnes was intended.50 It is further remarkable that a Confirmation by Richard Peche, Bishop of Lichfield (1161-1182) to the said Abbey, speaks of the Monks being entitled to two-thfrds of the Demesne tithes of Lithe?1 I know of no Lithe in Lichfield Diocese, which can be here intended, unless it be the locality before us. How ever, it is clear that the whole of Great Lyth can never have been in Earl Hugh's Demesne, for here or hereabouts was that hide of land which Domesday tells us to have been held by Roger Venator in Condover Manor. This Tenement, as I have already said, would in the ordinary course of succession be found to have gone from Roger Venator to the Barons of Pulverbatch.62 We shall presently find sure indications of such a result.

All that I shall say here of Walter fitz John is, that he attests a Charter of the first Wil liam fitz Alan which probably passed between 1155 and 1158, that he was Uving in October 1200, but dead in April 1201. His son, usually called WUliam fitz Walter, was perhaps identical with one WUliam de Lia, who in May 1200 occurs as a Recognizor in a Lawsuit concerning Harnage. I have shown in a former Volume how William fitz Walter, in the year 1 203, quit-claimed one moiety of Great Lyth, viz. half a hide there, held of the Ba rony of Pulverbatch, to Robert cle Gatacre.53 I think that this Tenure may account for John de Gatacre appearing as a Juror for Con dover Hundred at the Assizes of 1256. At aU events we are sure from what I have said under Gatacre that an estate at Great Lyth remained with the Gatacres in the fourteenth century.54 I have now to show that, notwithstanding his surrender to Robert de Gatacre, WiUiam fitz Walter retained an interest in Great Lyth (probably the other moiety thereof), and transmitted the same to his Son, Walter fitz WUliam. The first dated notice that I have of Walter fitz WiUiam is, his appearance as Walter de Upton on a great Inquest taken in August 1226 concerning the Stiperstones Forest. In November 1227 we find Walter fitz WUUam not only a declared Tenant in the Manor of Pulverbatch, but joining with others in a claim upon the whole Manor against Hugh de Kilpec, its hereditary Lord. The Fine which conveys this information I will give at length under Pulverbatch. At or about this very time, I find that Walter de Upton gave to Shrews bury Abbey two-thirds of the tithes of all meadows of his demesne in the Vill of Lya.55 I look upon this grant as supplementary, that is, as intended to increase or to complete the Abbey's previous right of tithes in Great Lyth. This matter of Tithes introduces another family to our notice, Tenants, I think, of Walter de Upton and his Father in Great Lyth, and probably having other relations to the Lords of Pulverbatch. A Deed of Emma de Pulverbatch (the last possessor of that Barony before it went to collateral heirs), has the attestation of Martin fitz WUliam. The Deed passed between 1189 and 1193, as I shall show under Pulverbatch. Martin fitz William was Father of several sons, one of whom, 53- \u00ab Supra, Vol. Ill, pp. 88, 90. 55 Salop Chartulary, No. 123.\u2014 Attes- I ted by Robert de Stepelton, Henry Bo zard, and Master Stephen de Franketon."], [466, "24 CONDOVER. William fitz Martin, had property in the Abbey- Foregate of Shrews bury, and occurs in several transactions with the Abbey. Among other things, he executes a Deed which I look upon as a sort of pendant to Walter de Upton's Deed above quoted. \" With consent of his wife Joniana he gives to Shrewsbury Abbey two parts of the tithe of his meadow in Fulcheye, which meadow was of the demesne of Walter de Hupton in the vill of Lya.\"56 Next in order of time comes a Fine dated at Shrewsbury, Nov. 23, 1236. Thereby Johanna, widow of WilUam fitz Martin (Plaintiff) quit claims to Odo de Hodenet (Tenant), five nokes of land and one acre of meadow in Magna Lya, whereof had been Suit-at-Law. Odo de Hodenet gave 100s. for this Quit-claim. I shall in due course show that Odo de Hodnet was a Tenant elsewhere of the Barons of Pulverbatch. The following Fine, levied in January 1278, relates to another tenure here. Thereby WiUiam le Clerk of Acton and IsabeUa his wife (Impedients) surrender to WUliam de Lake and Isolda his wife (Plaintiffs) a messuage and half-virgate in Magna Lythe as the right of Isolda by their own gift; to hold to WiUiam and the heirs of Isolda at a rent of one Rose payable to the Grantors and the heirs of Isabella, and by performing aU capital services. For this a Sore Sparrow-hawk is said to be given. William de Lake as well as WiUiam Clerk of Acton frequently occur in the cotemporary affairs of this neighbourhood. The former is found on local Juries in 1283, 1284, 1286, 1290, and 1292. Little Lyth. \u2014 Under this head I wiU give some extracts, one or two of which possibly refer to Undertenants in Great Lyth, for the two places are not always distinguished. In 1200 Hugh de NevUl, Justice of the Forest, amerced Nicho las de Lya half a merk for Vert. In 1228, PhUip de Leie was amerced for some default as a Surety. In 1231, John de Parva Lya was amerced half a merk for trespass. In 1250, Geoffrey de Langley set an arrentation of 2s. 3d. on John de la Lithe for 2j acres of forest-land stated to be in La Lithe. He also set an arrentation of 2s. 10^d. on John Balie for 3^ acres and acre stated to be in Pulverbatch. Three years' arrears of each of these rents are charged on the Pipe-Roll of 1254. These entries are connected with a tale of injury characteristic of the times.

Pipe-Roll of 1259 states that John de la Lythe owed 72s. for arrears of assart-rents and for an additional amercement with which he had been visited. His Sureties were Robert de Gateford and Roger le Champyun. The Pipe-RoU of 1261 shows that John de la Lithe and John Balie were one person, and that the Barons of the Exchequer had, by order of the King, directed an Inquisition to be held as to the sums with which he was charged. It turned out that the lands described above, as 3\u00a3 acres and J acre in Pul verbatch, were altogether imaginary and non-existent, that the man's real tenure was 1^ acres, being that which had been increased to 2| acres in the Roll of 1254. The reason of all this injustice was that John Balie, alias De la Lithe, had had a quarrel with Richard de Middelhope, a person much employed in Forest mat ters at the time (1250) when Geoffrey de Langley visited Shrop shire : and so the said Richard had used his official intercourse with Geoffrey de Langley for the purpose of procuring John BaUe's land to be assessed with a plurality of arrentations.57 In 1267 I find WUliam Underhul and John Barel of La Lye amerced 6s. 8d. for not producing one for whom they were Sureties. At the Assizes of 1272 WUUam Balie of La Lye appears on the Jury for Condover Hundred. The Inquest of 1274 shows that in one instance a provincial officer had seized on a horse worth 20s., belonging to WUUam Balie of Le Lithe. In another instance he had been fined 4s. Id. on some unintelligible pretext, and had been imprisoned.58 Great and Little Ryton. \u2014 WiUiam de Rutton and Geoffrey Mai, already named as Condover Tenants in 1250, had their hold ings in one of these Vills. At the Inquisition of 1255 Geoffrey de Ritton and John Mai of Ritton appeared as Jurors for Condover Manor. Those Tenants of Condover, whose names are variously written as Pik, Pach, or Pyk, appear to have been of Ryton. The Extent of 1283 gives 4 virgates in Great Ryton and 4 virgates in Little Ryton as yielding rents of 28s. and 27s. 4>d. to the Lords of Condover. At the Assizes of 1292 Nicholas, John, and Henry de Ruton were all Jurors for Condover Manor, and WilUam de Ruton appears as a Juror at Sheinton in June 1294, and at Little BuUd was in December 1302.

This was because he was Lord of Longnor, a Manor adjoining to Condover, and which was held by the male Une of Sprencheaux for several generations. Our present concern with this family is to state in limine that Alric Sprencheaux as weU as his son and heir Roger Sprencheaux (I) occur more than once as Eylric and Roger de Wesseleg, i.e. West ley. This was because of some interest which they had at Westley, and I cannot but associate that interest with a grant recorded to have been \" made by a King of England to Eylric Sprenghose.\" The said grant was a MU1 and half a virgate of land in the Manor of Condover. The King who made it was doubtless Henry II, and a chief-rent of 20s. per annum was reserved to the Crown. Of this land and Mill, Eylric Sprenghose was seized at his death, which seems to have taken place about 1170-5. His son Roger Spreng hose (I) succeeded, and held both land and Mill for Use.59 He died, as I know from good authority, in or shortly before the year 1221. His son, Roger Sprenghose (II) entered upon both land and MiU. He was however disseized of the MU1 by LeweUyn, to whom Henry III had granted the Manor of Condover. This then was between the years 1226 and 1231. When in the latter year Henry III reseized the Manor, Roger Sprenghose did not there fore recover the Mill. Henry de Hastings became Lord of Con dover. He died in 1250 leaving his son, a Minor in ward to the Crown. Still Sprenghose's MiU was unrestored, but the Inquest of Condover Hundred in 1255 distinctly notes how Roger Spren those was holding half a virgate of land within the once Royal Manor of Condover, though the Jurors were ignorant of his Title.59 On the death of Henry de Hastings (II), in or about 1268, Con dover was again in the King's hand as before explained. Then at last Sir Roger Sprenghose (III) procured a King's Writ and an Inquest and so recovered the Mill. He was holding both the MiU and half-virgate in November 1274, aud paying the King a rent of 20s. for the same.59 At this time Sir Roger Sprenghose (III) had made a further acquisition in Condover Manor at a place called The Hoo. Thomas Hancoc (in one instance called Subescheator of the King, in another called Seneschal of Condover) had set out 2 acres of land which Sir Roger had assarted, and for which he was in 1274 ''paying a rent of Is. to the Lord Edmund,\"59 that is, as I have already explained, to Edmund Plantagenet, Earl of CornwaU.

The Jurors remembered how he had re covered the said Mill after long disseizin, by a Writ of King Henry III, and by an Inquest, taken while Hamo le Strange was Custos of the Manor. The assarted lands, which Roger Spreng hose had, are said in this Extent to have been leased to him by the Bailiffs of the Lord Henry of Almagne, a mistake, I presume, for Edmund Plantagenet, son of Richard, King of Almagne. Of this family of Sprencheaux I shall speak more fuUy in their greater position as Lords of Longnor. I now add one or two further parti culars about Westley. In 1231 Henry de Wesseleg accounts half a merk to the Sheriff of Shropshire, due from him as a surety in some Forest-Plea. In AprU 1 264 John de Wesley occurs on a local Jury. Henry de Wesseleye was on a local Inquest in 1283, and a Juror for Condover Hundred at the Assizes of 1272 and 1292, as also on the Inquest taken, in December of the last named year, as to the estates of Bishop BurneU deceased. Other Inquests of the same year give us Roger de Wesseleye, John de Wesseleye, and John son of Robert de Wesseleye, as Jurors. Wheathall. \u2014 Roger de Whethal was a Juror for Condover Manor at the Inquest of 1255 ; so were WUliam and Nicholas de Wetal at the Assizes of 1292.

This was one of those great Parish- Churches whose once Col legiate character bespoke its Saxon origin, but the extent of whose"], [470, "28 CONDOVER. Parish can only be determined partially and incidentally. The establishment was known in Saxon times as the \" Church of Saint Andrew.\" It is strange that the Domesday notice of the Manor of Condover indicates nothing more of this Foundation than is implied by the mention of one resident Priest. Another passage of Domes day is however more instructive. We are told, under Berrington, that \" Thoret, the Saxon Lord of that Manor, held half a hide therein of the Church of Saint Andrew by (a certain) service.\" Part then of the Glebe of Condover Church lay in another Manor and Parish ; for Berrington, no less than Condover, seems to have had a Saxon Church. Within eight years after Domesday we have an authentic state ment as to the Church of Chonedoura, as it is called. Earl Roger de Montgomery, gave it to Shrewsbury Abbey with all things ap pertaining to it.60 The Confirmations of King WUliam (probably William Rufus) and King Henry I, recite and aUow Earl Roger's grant of Condover Church, but neither of them specify the implied addition of half a hide in Berrington. This omission is corrected in the Charters of Stephen, Henry II, and Henry III, which aU three mention the said appurtenance of Condover Church. Among the Episcopal Confirmations to Shrewsbury Abbey we have that of Roger de Clinton, Bishop of Chester, confirming the Church of Conedovere, with its Chapels, and with a pension of 18s.; that of Bishop Walter Durent, confirming the same Church with its Tithes and Chapels ; and that of Bishop Richard Peche, confirming the Pension of 18s. During the time of Bishop Peche (1161-1182), and probably in the last ten years of his Episcopacy, the two Chapels (or the united Chapelry) of Lee Botwood and Bechcote were appro priated to Haughmond Abbey. It appears that these Chapels were affiliations of Condover Church, for the consent of all the Portioners of Condover is alleged by the Bishop as concurrent with his license of appropriation. The Portioners were apparently three in number. Their Christian names, Bartholomew, John, and Thomas, appear in the testing-clause of the Bishop's Charter.61 It is observable that Archbishop Peckham's Confirmation to Shrewsbury Abbey, which passed in August 1280, mentions the Pension receivable from Condover Church as 18s.62 In 1291 how ever, Pope Nicholas's Taxation, after valuing the Church of Cone dovere, in the Deanery of Salop, at \u00a323. 6s. 8d., adds that the Abbot 60 Salop Chartulary, No. 2. 61 Haughmond Chartulary : Tit.

These Rectories were, according to the nefarious system of the period, destined soon to become the divided spoil of the Bishop of Lichfield and the Abbot of Shrews bury. The Monks obtained a Charter of Appropriation from Bishop Walter de Langton. The Deed was dated July 9, 1315. It recited a previous Deed, dated June 15, 1315, whereby WiUiam, Abbot of Shrewsbury, and his convent, had submitted Condover Church to the Ordination of the Bishop. It commended the alms-giving and hospitality of the Abbey, and alluded to a requisition in its favour which the Bishop had received from King Edward IT. Then, with consent of his Chapter of Lichfield, the Bishop concedes and ap propriates the Church of Condover to the Abbey, saving however the life-interests of the existing Portioners (Henry de Lichfield and Thomas de Charnes) ; that is, the Appropriation was not to take effect till they were deceased. Meantime each of the said Portioners consented to pay 2s. per annum to the Abbey nomine per sonatits. The Deed reserved to whoever should be Bishop of Lichfield when these Prebends became vacant, a power of fixing the Taxation of Condover Vicarage, that is, of allotting a competent provision for the future Vicar, who was to be presented by Shrewsbury Abbey. Lastly the Abbot was, out of the appropriate funds, to pay an annual pension of eleven merks to the Cathedral Church of Lichfield. Five merks of this sum were to increase the emoluments of the Canons of Lich field, and six merks were to go to the support of a Chaplain or Chantry Priest, who should say masses in Lichfield Cathedral for the souls of Edward I, of Bishop Langton, and his Predecessors and Successors.64 On July 19, 1324, the last Portioner of Condover was dead, and Bishop Roger de Northburgh proceeded in due Canonical form to give effect to the unrighteous scheme of his Pre decessor. His Charter, entitled Ordinacio Vicari\u0153 de Conedovere, recites much of Langton's Deed of Appropriation as I have above set it forth. It then announces the decease of the last Rectors of Condover ; and states that it has been found by Inquest that the fruits and profits ofthe Church in question amount to \u00a353. 14s. 8rf.65 per annum, that is to say ; \u2014 the tithes of corn and hay, with the annual rents receivable by one Portioner, were, together with his Manse, worth \u00a333. 14s. 8d., whUe the small tithes, oblations, and \u0153 The total is 6s.

The Bishop now ordains, \u2014 that the future Vicar shall have the Houses (domos) late inhabited by Thomas de Charnes, a Portioner, together with the Manse, Close, Curtilages, and other appendages thereof, and with free ingress and egress; that the Monks shall make good all deficiencies of the said buildings at their own expense, rendering them complete with a hall, two chambers, a cellar, a kitchen, a stable, a brew-house, and other buildings proportionate to the estate of a Vicarage. The Vicar was to receive the lesser tithes, the oblations, the mortuaries, the tithes of curtilages, whatever they were, and all other obventions of every kind belonging to the Church, it being defined that lesser tithes were all tithes except the tithes of corn and hay. These last, to gether with the annual rent, the suits of Court, and all other receipts from the Tenants of the Church, were appropriated to the Abbey of Shrewsbury. However, the Vicar was to have the hay-tithes of Dodyngton (Dorrington), and the grass in Condover Churchyard. The Vicar was to bear aU ordinary burdens lying on the Church, except the Pension of eleven merks due to Lichfield Cathedral, which was to be discharged by the Abbey. When the time came for so doing, the Monks were to build^ the Chancel of the Church, and always repair and maintain the same at their own cost. As to extraordinary and prospective burdens, such, when they arose, were to be borne, two-thirds by the Monks, and one-third by the Vicar. Lastly the Bishop reserves a power to himself and his Successors of altering or interpreting the premises in any way which might there after appear expedient.07 In 1341 the Assessors of the Ninth, quoting the Church Taxation of Condover as \u00a323. 6s. 8c?. (which was \u00a31. less than the actual Taxation), rated the Parish at \u00a316. 13s. 4c?. The reasons for the decrease were because the Glebe, the rents, small tithes, oblations, and hay-tithes were worth \u00a37. per annum, and so the Ninth of wheat, wool, and lamb was unequal to a Church-Taxation com prehending those receipts ; also the corn-crops were deficient in the current year.68 At this time a Chantry, called the Condover Chantry, had been founded in Lichfield Cathedral and endowed with that Pension of 11 merks which the Impropriators of Condover Church were bound 66 I suppose the Chancel was much i Northburgh's era. dilapidated.

Among his outgoings was the Pension of 11 merks (\u00a37. 6s. 8c?.) payable to the Dean and Chapter of Lich field out of Condover Church.70 On September 29, 1536, Thomas, Abbot of Shrewsbury, and his Convent, leased the Parsonage and Tithes of Condover to one Thomas Glover, which Lease was re newed on May 4, 1542, for a term of 41 years, to commence on Feb. 2, 1543, the reserved rent being \u00a327. 6s. 8c?.71 The Ministers' Accounts of the Estates of Shrewsbury Abbey vary very slightly from the Valor.

In the Summer of the same year (1299) Bishop Langton writes to Thomas de Charneles (as he is here called) and tells him to meet the Bishop at York to confer about his stUl disputed Title. The Bishop seems to have held that his obligation to Shelton would be discharged if he obliged the Abbot of Shrewsbury to provide the said Shelton with an annual pension of 40s. or at least 20s. However, by a subsequent Pre cept, Bishop Langton orders Thomas de Charneles to provide for his opponent (Shelton) an annual pension of \u00a310. I find that Charnes was instituted at York, but not before January 31, 1300. In December 1300 and February 1310 he has Ucenses for two years' study, being at the latter period in Priest's Orders.72 He was the last Rector of his Portion, and was deceased, as I have said, in 1324. Henry de Lichfield, the last Incumbent of the other Portion, is the only one I can name. He was also a Canon of Tamworth, and in July 1322 has a license to reside on the latter preferment and to receive at the same time the emoluments of his Condover Portion. He was to provide for the services at Condover being performed and the poor duly attended to.73 He was deceased in July 1324. John Husee, first Vicar of Condover, was admitted July 17, 1324, on presentation of the Abbot and Convent of Shrewsbury.73 John de Mineton resigned this Vicarage in May 1375, having exchanged preferments with \u2014 William Amyas, Priest, late Vicar of Aldelym (Lichfield Diocese), who was presented accordingly to Condover by the Abbot and Convent of Shrewsbury.

Berrington, anciently written Berintone or Biritone, is etymologi caUy the town of some Saxon Byrine. At Domesday the prominent Tenure in Condover Hundred was that of Rainald the Sheriff under Earl Roger. I will now proceed with the seven Manors which composed this Tenure. And first of Berrington, described in Domesday as follows : \u2014 \" The same Rainald holds Beritune, and Azo holds it of him. Thoret held (in Saxon times) half a hide in this VU1 under (the Church of) St. Andrew, by (certain) services. Besides this half hide, he (Thoret) held two geldable hides (here). In demesne there are n ox-teams; and (there are) vn Serfs and vi ViUains with i team; and yet there might be n teams more here. St. Peter in Shrewsbury holds the Church and Priest of this VU1. In King Edward's time (the Manor) was worth 30s., afterwards it was worth 14s., now it is worth 40s. (per annum) .\" 1 Of Toret the Saxon I have spoken already under WiUey.3 Ber rington was one of the Manors which he lost wholly or partly at the Conquest. Berrington was at Domesday a Manor of 2\\ hides. Two of these hides were held by Azo under Rainald the Sheriff. What was the then tenure of the remaining half-hide, Domesday does not specifically declare ; but I presume it to have been still held under, or subsequently restored to, the Church of St. Andrew at Con dover, and Toret may possibly have been stiU Tenant thereof. 2 Supra, Vol. II, p. 49. \"' Blakeway's MSS. 1 Domesday, so. 254, b. 1. VI."], [478, "34 BERRINGTON. Of Azo I have spoken at some length under Glazeley and Abdon, and I have intimated as a general rule that whatever was held under Rainald by Azo at Domesday is found to be held subse quently by the elder House of Le Strange under Fitz Alan.3 Ber rington is no exception to this rule, but there seems to have been some variation as to the time when each Manor of Azo's Fief was transferred to Le Strange. Glazeley and Abdon, for instance, had passed to Le Strange before 1165 when John le Strange appears as holding 2 fees of new-feoffment under Fitz Alan. But with Ber rington I think it was otherwise, and that this Manor constituted the whole or a part of that one fee of old-feoffment which hi 1 165 was held by Hamo de Sancto Remigio under Fitz Alan.4 That the Mesne-tenure of Berrington did at length accrue to the Fee of Le Strange, is however certain ; and this wiU partly account for the fact that in 1240 the Fief of John le Strange under Fitz Alan was not merely 2 fees, but, if I mistake not, at least 2>\\ fees. I shall now show by documentary evidence that within seven years of the year 1165, John le Strange had obtained an interest in Berrington, and also that, at a subsequent period to his exercising such interest, Helewisa, the daughter of Hamo de Sancto Remigio, retained a right in the Manor and exercised that right in subjection to John le Strange as Mesne-Lord. Pope Alexander III, confirming the grants of all previous Bene factors to Haughmond Abbey, on May 14, 1172, includes two grants of John le Strange, viz. one virgate in Beriton, and half a virgate in Webblescowe (Webscott near Middle) .5 But Pope Alex ander's Bull does not include, and therefore preceded, a Charter whereby \" Helewisa, daughter of Hamo de Sancto Remigio, gave and confirmed to Haughmon half a virgate in Beriton, viz. that held by one Gilbert,\" by which she also gave \" Odo her Vassal, with all his children, to hold the said land of the Canons.\" This Deed was witnessed by William fitz Alan (the second of his name) 3 Supra, Vol. I, p. 211. Vol. IV, pp. later. It is attested by William, son of William fitz Alan, by Wido, the grantor's brother, and by Ralph, Wido's son. Now William fitz Alan II did not come of age till 1175 and Ralph le Strange not till 1182. I take it therefore that this Deed was sealed in the last year of John le Strange's life, viz. in 1177-8, and was confirmatory. 127-8. 4 Liber Niger, I, 143. 5 Harleian MSS. 3868, so. 11.

It was also confirmed by John le Strange, Hugh Panton again attesting the Confirmation.6 It is this confirmation by John le Strange, whether the first or second of his name, which proves that his Tenure of Berrington was an inserted one, that is mediate between Fitz Alan and the heirs of Hamo de Sancto Remigio. A few years later, and we have good reason to suppose that Hugh le Strange, whose relation to John le Strange I cannot certify, occupied the place of Helewisa de Sancto Remigio in the Tenure of Berrington. Possibly he was the husband of Helewisa herself. He, I take it, was that Hugh le Strange who, next to John le Strange, attests a Charter of Guy le Strange which passed about 1174 and which I have already recited under Badger.7 We learn from the same Charter that Hugh had a Brother, another John. There were possibly two persons named Hugh le Strange holding Berrington in succession under the elder house of Le Strange. At aU events I have several notices which connect a Hugh le Strange with this neighbourhood at the very commencement of the thir teenth century. I wiU here mention only, that, at the Assizes of 1203, Hugh le Strange appears as Surety for a Fine of 5 merks proffered by Hamo Marescote, then Lord of Eaton Mascott. Eighteen years later, and we have clear evidence of Hugh le Strange's Tenure of Byrinton. At the Assizes of October 1221, he was found to have disseized the Abbot of Haughmond, the Prioress of Brewood, and SibU, widow of Wydo Wallensis, of their right of common in the pasture called The Clude, in that Manor.8 In or about the year 1240 Hugh le Strange was dead, and his inheritance divided among females. This I gather from a Record which, however inaccurate in itself, I wiU endeavour to explain.9 Among certain Knights'-fees erroneously classed as belonging to the Barony of Hugh de Kilpek we have the following entry. \u2014 Roger Sprinchose et heredes Hugonis Extranei 1 /. in Biriton Logenhoke, or (as a cotemporary Roll has it) in Binton, Longelorn. The fact reaUy was, that Roger Sprencheaux held Longnor, and the Coheirs of Hugh le Strange held Berrington, under John le Strange (III), who in turn held under Fitz Alan. The Hundred Roll of 1255, though it omits Fitz- Alan's Seigneury, is explicit on other points. It says that \" Richard de Dryton, William fitz Alan, John 6 Haughmond Chartulary : Tit.

At the Assizes of 1292 there was a dispute between Gilbert Abbot of Haughmond and Sir John de la Lee (then Lord of Berrington) as to lands, tenements, meadows. Suits of Court, and Commons, pertaining to the Vill of Biriton. It was arranged, out of Court, that Sir John de la Lee should allow the Abbot and his men of Biriton common-pasture for aU their animals throughout the whole of his (Sir John's) fee of Biriton, except in Staplemore, La Cloude, Depemere and Longe bache. I introduce this matter here because the composition was effected by mediation of Richard Earl of Arundel and other friends, and was attested by that Nobleman, by SU John le Strange and by Sir Thomas de RossaU.10 Now two of these witnesses were the Seigneural and Mesne Lords over Sir John de la Lee. I shall here dismiss the question of Fitz Alan's Seigneury and Le Strange's Mesne-tenure at Berrington, merely remarking that a Feodary of Fitz-Alan estates, taken in 1397-8, gives a recurrent proof of the former, when it inserts Robert de Lee as Tenant of Byriton by service of half a knight's-fee.11 I now turn to the four Coparceners of Berrington, mentioned in the Hundred-RoU of 1255. Whether they were the sons or the husbands of four Coheiresses of Hugh le Strange I cannot say, indeed I know little positively about any of them except WiUiam fitz Alan. \u2014 Richard de Dryton may be the same person with Richard de Dray ton, who appears on the Pipe-RoU of 1230 as owing half a merk for non-production of one for whom he was Surety. I find Richard de Dreyton to have been Juror on an Inquest concerning Langley, in March 1253, and Juror for Condover Hundred at the Inquest of 1255 and the Assizes of 1256. Within ten years of this time, one Richard de Dreyton appears attesting Deeds which concerned Aston near Oswestry. His fellow-witness, in two in stances, was Sir John fitz Philip, whom I know to have been Lord of Aston, and whom I think to have been the third Coparcener in Berrington. At the Assizes of 1272 Richard de Drayton ap peared as one of the Coroners of Shropshire, and as Recognizor in a great suit about the Manor of Albrightlee.

The first, third, and fourth witnesses thereof are Sir John de la Lee, Richard de Drayton, and Hugh fitz Philip.13 These three persons represented three of the Coparceners of Berrington in 1255 ; that is, John de la Lee was Brother-in-law of William fitz Alan, Richard de Drayton was identical with, or the son of, Richard de Drayton, and Hugh fitz Philip was son of John fitz Philip of Aston. To proceed with Richard de Drayton ; \u2014 the Jurors of the Manor of Ford complained at the Inquest of 1274, that he had taken undue rewards for the exercise of his office as Coroner.14 Before the Assizes of October 1292 he was dead, and Thomas de Felton, as his heir, appeared to answer for his con duct whilst in office. I think Thomas de Felton was son of Nicholas de Felton, who occurs on Juries in this neighbourhood in 1283-4. We shall hereafter see how Stephen, son and heir of Thomas de Felton, disposed of his share of Berrington. This Stephen I happen to know was born in 1281. He married a daughter of Walter de Burton and made proof of his age before John de la Lee (under whom he held lands) in 1302-3. I find nothing as to any interest in Berrington remaining to \u2014 Hugh fitz Philip. The same may be said of \u2014 Philip de Hungefort (the fourth Coparcener of 1255) and his representatives. His name wUl recur to us again under the date 1255, when he was Coparcener in another but distant Manor, viz. Stanwardine-in-the-Fields. I now turn to the other Coparcener of 1255, viz.\u2014 William fitz Alan, better known as WilUam son of Alan de Drayton. This person has already occurred to us as Lord of Chatwall in 1255, and I have shown how that, he dying without issue, John de la Lee, as husband of his (Wilham's) Sister Petronilla, acquired his estate at Chatwall for life.15 The same thing will have happened in respect of Berrington, but I think that Sir John de la Lee, who was a noted person in his day, instead of retaining a mere fourth of this Manor, acquired a further share therein by lapse or by purchase. 12 \u25a0 ]3 Haughmond Chartulary : Tit.

John de la Lee was eldest son and heir of Sir Thomas de la Lee, who had estates in HadnaU, Hunkington, Alderton, and Lee near PimhUl. Thomas has occurred to us also as a Coparcener in Aldon, and under the dates of 1221 and 1255.16 I know that he was living in April 1258, and that he had been generally succeeded by his son, Sir John, before February 1270. I have a notice of John de la Lee much earlier than this, but it probably indicates an interest in his wife's inheritance rather than his father's. In March 1262 he was one of those who were prosecuted and also pardoned, at the Forest Assizes, for keeping hounds within jurisdiction ofthe Forest, with out license. John de la Lee was, as we have seen, a Coparcener in Aldon in 1284,17 and it was probably in the year 1283 or 1284 that his estate at Berrington was increased by a grant of John le Strange, the Mesne-Lord of that Manor. Le Strange, I presume, was empowered to make this grant by the lapse or surrender of one of the four shares above mentioned. The Charter itseU purports to be merely a gift by John le Strange to Sir John du Lee, Knight, of a messuage and carucate of land in Byntone. It was attested by Sir John de Kirkeby (who became Bishop of Ely in 1286), Sir Robert Corbet, Sir Reyner de Acton, Sir Peter de Eyton, and Sir John de Arundell.18 The Composition of 1292, already recited, shows Sir John de la Lee dealing with Berrington affairs as if he were sole Lord of the Manor,19 or, at least, something much more than a mere Feoffee in one-fourth thereof. I have alluded, under Aston Botterell, to a grant of John son of SU Thomas de la Lee, to Richard BottereU. The grant passed on May 1, 1297, at Aston Botterell.20 The next note which I have of Berrington is involved in a very curious Fine levied at Westminster in October 1314. It is \"be tween John du Lee and Alice his wife (Plaintiffs) and John son of Alice Boterel (Deforciant), of 7 messuages, 1 garden, 3 virgates and 40 acres of land, and two acres of meadow in Biriton, Hauky ton, and Shetton (Berrington, that is, and Haston and Shotton, near HadnaU), whereof was Plea, etc. John son of Alice Boterel now concedes and renders up the premises, to have and to hold, to John du Lee and Alice his wife, and to the heirs which John may have begotten of the body of Alice, of the Chief Lords of the Fee.

I reserve for a future occasion the question whether the John du Lee of this Fine was identical with, or the son and heir of, Sir John de la Lee, living in 1297. That he was at some time a Knight, there can be no question. The Return called the Nomina Villarum, made in pursuance of a Royal Order of March 1316, returns him as John du Lee and as Lord of Birinton.21 As John de Lee, Knight, he made a Quitclaim to Haughmond Abbey of a parcel of land in HadnaU, his deed being dated at Biriton on Sep tember 24, 1317.22 We are fortunate in having a memorandum of an Assize held at Ludlow in December 1317, wherein most of the names concerned in the Fine of 1314 recur, and whereby we learn more of the actual relations of the parties to that Fine than its technical phraseology could have taught us. In the said Assize Hugh de Byriton, Clerk, is opposed to John de Lee and Alice his wife; to Thomas, son of Alice; to Isabella, daughter of John du Lee, and PetroniUa her sister ; and to Oliver, son of Alice-du Lee, and Alice, Oliver's wife.33 So then, John du Lee Senior and Alice Boterel were man and wife ; \u2014 and their chUdren were John, Thomas, OUver, Petronilla, and Isabella; but why the said chUdren should be thus variously described, onewhUe by thefr father's, onewhile by thefr mo ther's name, I cannot understand, nor do I see why the Fine of 1314 should have named Alice Boterel and Alice wife of John du Lee as if they were two persons, when in fact they were identical. To continue; \u2014 in 13 Edw. II (1319-20) John du Lee Senior was de ceased, and I have a note of an agreement which was then arrived at between \" Thomas son of Thomas du Lee and Alice widow of John du Lee, late Lord of Biriton,\" in which agreement \" John de la Lee Thomas, Oliver, Petronilla, and Ysabella are named as sons and daughters ofthe said Alice.\"34 We know not what lands were affected by this agreement, but it is evident that at this time there 21 Parliamentary Writs, IV, 398. 22 Haughmond Chartulary : Tit.

Thomas, son of Thomas du Lee (party to this agreement), was of the latter House. He was, in fact, younger brother of Sir John de la Lee of Roden, and was nephew of John de la Lee, late Lord of Berrington. There is a Deed quoted as having passed in 16 Edw. II, that is, between July 1322 and July 1323, whereby \" John du Lee, Lord of Byriton, gave to Thomas his son that land in the Manor of Stanton which was called Okehurst, and which Oliver the Grantor's Brother had held.\"34 The question is, Who was this Grantor? Was it John son and heir of John du Lee of Berrington (deceased in 1319-20), or John son and heir of Thomas du Lee of Roden and Stanton (deceased in 1318) ? It is as difficult to account for the former granting in Stanton as for the latter styling himself Lord of Berrington. To increase the difficulty, it is positively certain that each John had a brother Oliver ; but it is not known which of them had a son Thomas. My own belief is, that John du Lee of Roden had at this time acquired from his Cousin, or otherwise, the pro minent interest in Berrington. I back this belief by a Fine, dated Nov. 18, 1323, which shows John du Lee of Roden intent on making an acquisition in Berrington, in fact, buying up one of the four shares. The Fine was levied at York between John son of Thomas de la Lee, Chivaler, (Plaintiff, through his Attorney, Thomas de Buryton), and Stephen, son of Thomas de Felton and Sibil his wife (Deforciants), of one messuage, one carucate of land, six acres of meadow, and the moiety of a Mill in Buryton, whereof was Plea, etc. Stephen and Sibil acknowledged the Plaintiff's right as arising by their own grant, \u2014 to hold to the Plaintiffs, of the Lords of the Fee, with warranty from the Deforciants and the Heirs of Stephen. For this the Plaintiff gave 20 merks. By a Charter, dated at Roden in 1 Edw.

This John de Lee I take to have been not the Lord of Roden and Berrington, but the once heir of the latter Manor, reduced to the position of a common Freeholder.

In January 1333, Thomas son of John de la Lee, Thomas son of Thomas de la Lee, and Isabella daughter of John de Baskerville, are collectively sued by John de BaskerviUe for disseizing him of a tenement in Eaton Mascott. During the progress of this cause, Oliver de Lee appears as Surety for Thomas son of John de Lee, that is, I presume, for his own brother, whose son (Thomas son of Thomas) seems to have been the real Defendant in the cause. I shall recur to this subject under Eaton Mascott. Of the three brothers, John, Thomas, and Oliver, as Tenants at Berrington, I find nothing more, unless it were John de la Lee, the elder of them, whose widow Johanna was impleaded in March 1346, by Thomas de Lee of Berrington, for disseizin in Berrington. If so, I am doubtfrU whether the Prosecutor in this case was the still surviving Brother of John de Lee or the son of that Brother. This branch of the Lees, though undoubtedly the eldest, seems gradually to have fallen into obscurity. I now return to Maud de la Lee, whose Father John de la Lee (Lord of Stanton, Roden, and Berrington) had given her a life estate at Berrington in 1327-8. She was surviving in 1378-9, and then, as Matilda widow of John Lyle, released to Robert de Lee, Lord of Roden, the residue of her interest in such estate. This Robert de Lee was her Great-Nephew, that is, son of John, son of John, son of John, father of Matilda. Robert de Lee of Roden married Petro niUa daughter and sole heir of Roger de Lee of Langley, which Roger was Cousin in the fourth degree to his daughter's husband. In 1397-8 a Fitz-Alan Feodary records Robert de Lee as holding Stanton by two knights'-fees and Berrington by half a fee of that Barony. He married Petronilla before 1401, and they had a son, Ralph, born in 1404. In 7 Henry VI (1428-9) Robert de Lee was probably deceased, for then William Beistan (I think a Feoffee-in trust) empowers an Attorney to give seizin, to Ralph Lee son of Robert Lee, of a messuage and 3 virgates in Biriton. But Petro niUa, Ralph's Mother, was still Lady of the Manor of Berrington, having it, I suppose, in dower. In 17 Henry VI (1438-9) she leases to her son Ralph the Manor of Byritone with its appur tenances for the term of her life. PetroniUa died on March 12, 1442, seized of one-third of Langley, which of course descended to her son Ralph. On March 25, 1445, we find Ralph Lee, Esq., taking an eighty years' lease under Richard, Abbot of Haughmond, of part of the Abbot's Berrington estate, viz. \" of a messuage aud vi. 6"], [486, "42 BERRINGTON. garden, \u2014 parcel of the half-virgate which Helewisa daughter of Hamo de Sancto Remigio gave to the Abbey, and of a croft, \u2014 parcel of the virgate which John le Strange gave to the Abbey.\" The reserved rent was 20c?. Ralph Lee died on Dec. 5, 1479, but at some time previous to his decease he seems to have made a dis- position of his estates by the usual method of granting them to Feoffecs-in-trust. I can only find an abstract of the Counter-Deed of these presumed Feoffees, and which does not declare any further uses or remainders than that \" Richard Welde, Chaplain, and James Rydley granted to Ralph Lee of Langley, Esq., and Isabella his wife, daughter of the said James Rydley, all messuages, lands, etc., which the said Richard and Ralph had in the Vills of Hatalles, Ruckley, Haigh ton (Haughton, near HadnaU), Roden, Acton Bur- nell, and Buryton.\" This Deed, if such it is, purports to be dated in 19 Edward IV (1479-80), which I find hard to reconcile with the statements given in the Inquest on Ralph Lee's death. The Jurors said that the said Ralph died seized of the Manor of Muche Longley (Langley is meant), held in capite, by one-fourth of a knight's-fee ; also, that William Mitton, Esq., and John Bromlowe, having been lately seized (in trust, I presume) of the Manor of Buryton, had entailed the same on Ralph and Isabella and the heirs of their bodies, with remainder to the right heirs of Ralph ; \u2014 also, that Isabella predeceased Ralph, and that Ralph died seized of the Manor in fee-tail, it being held of John, Earl of Arundel, by un- known services; lastly, that Petronilla, Ralph's Mother, being seized in her lifetime of the Manors of Roden and Stanton, had given them (in trust, I presume) to John Massy and others, and that Richard Lee, Esq., now forty years of age, was son and heir of both Ralph and IsabeUa. If I am to reconcile these statements, it must be in this way ; \u2014 that the messuages and lands in Berrington spoken of in the Deed were distinct from the Manor of Berrington spoken of in the In quest; \u2014 that Ralph had two wives, both named Isabella, the first being mother of his son Richard, the second, IsabeUa Rydley, she who was provided for in the Deed of 19 Edward IV. This appears more probable from a further note which asserts IsabeUa, Widow of Ralph Lee, to occur in 20 Edward IV (14-80-1). Of Undertenants in Berrington I have little more to add, except as regards a famUy which took its name from the place. In 1203 Robert and Roger de Biritone were Sureties in a suit against Roger Sprenghose of Longnor. In 1253 Hugh and Nicholas de Byriton"], [487, "43 BERRINGTON. were Jurors in a Smethcott Inquest. At the Inquest of 1255 Nicholas de Bfritone was a Juror for Condover Hundred, and Hugh de Biritone occupied a simUar position at the Assizes of 1256. Hugh de Byriton occurs in an Essoign of 1262, and also as being amerced half a merk by Justices-of-the-Forest for non-production of one whose appearance he had guaranteed. He was father of John de Byrinton, presently to be mentioned. In 1267 Richard de Berington is amerced half a merk for unjust detention. Thomas de Byriton was Juror in an important cause in 1272. Nicholas de Byriton was Juror for the Hundred in 1274, and appears as a Re garder ofthe King's Forests, in 1285. He it was, I think, who has occurred to us as a Grantee in Northwood (near Stottesden) at the close of the Century, and who, in 1310-1, disposed of his lands there. John de Byrinton occurs on a local Jury in 1283, and at the Assizes of 1292 John de Byriton chose the Jury for Condover Hundred.35 He occurs again in 1307-8. Hugh de Byriton, Clerk, occurs in 1317, William de Biritone is named in a Wilderhope en tail of 1321,36 and Thomas de Burytone as an Attorney in 1323. The latter was apparently son of John de Byriton, living in 1292 and 1307, for on May 23, 1333, Nicholas, Abbot of Haughmond, leases to Thomas son of John de Bireton a messuage and half virgate in Bireton, and a messuage, half- virgate, and Mill in Eton Mascott, all which had been held by the Lessee's Father, to hold to the Lessee for life, to Mary his wife for life, and to Thomas their eldest son for life, at a rent of \u00a32. 6s. 8c?.

This was I think a Saxon Foundation. At all events it existed before Domesday, when we are told that both the Church and Priest of Beritune were in the tenure of St. Peter's Abbey at Shrewsbury. Within eight years after Domesday we have Earl Roger's Charter to that Abbey in wonderful consistency with the nobler Record. It confirms as a grant of Guarin, Sheriff, \"the Church of Beriton with the tithe of the same Vill.\" The Charters of WiUiam I, Henry I, Stephen, Henry II and Henry III, all con firm the grant. Among Episcopal confirmations, Roger de Clinton's Charter names the Church of Brugton and a pension of 24s., Walter Durdent's names the Church and the tithe of the ViU of Biriton, and Richard Peche's names the pension of 24s. Arch bishop Peckham's Confirmation, in 1280, ratifies the same pension. In Hilary Term 1226 Roger la Zouche was suing the Abbot of Shrewsbury for the Advowson of Berington, as weU as the Manor of Betton.31 The Pleadings as to the Advowson are not extant. I suppose Roger la Zouche' s claim was similar to his claim of the Advowson of Tong a few years previous,32 and that he failed in both cases. Whatever right of presentation to Berrington may have been asserted by Roger la Zouche's ancestors, I presume that the original ground thereof was in some of the many transactions which had taken place between the Abbot of Shrewsbury, on the one hand, and Richard de Belmeis, Bishop of London, or his Nephew Philip, on the other. These transactions belonged to the reign of Henry I, and we shaU see, under Betton, that of a part of them there was no Record in the time of Henry III, in fact that they were totally misrepresented in the Law-Courts of that reign. In 1274 the Jurors of Condover Hundred reported how Ber rington Church had been broken open and the clothes of Richard de Bath stolen therefrom by Alice de Haumon. The culprit had been lodged in Shrewsbury Gaol, but had escaped without trial by presenting a Cow to William de Munslow (he was an Officer under Robert TriUek, Under-Sheriff to Ralph de Mortimer).

These Pensions were that of 24s. to Shrewsbury Abbey, and one of great magnitude and undoubted antiquity, but of which we now hear for the first time, viz. \u00a36^ 13s. 4c?. (the full half of the gross Revenue), to the Ca thedral Church of Lichfield.34 Now this Pension was not a bribe given by the Monks of Shrewsbury to any Bishop of Lichfield in return for a License to appropriate ; for Berrington Church was not then, and has never been since, appropriated. It is a Rectory to this day. My belief is that this pension was part of a very early but unrecorded exchange between the Abbey of Shrewsbury and the Church of Lichfield, and that another result of this exchange was that the Manor of Betton, which at Domesday belonged to the See of Lichfield, belonged ever afterwards to the Monks of Shrews bury. Now Great Betton was in the Parish of Berrington. In 1341 the Assessors of the Ninth quoted the Church-Taxation of Byriton at 20 merks (.\u20ac13. 6s. 86?.), which was quite correct. They assessed the Parish only at \u00a38. 13s. 4c?. to the Ninth, because the foUowing items not computable in the Ninth formed part of the Church-Taxation, viz. Glebe, 40s. ; Oblations, Small-Tithes and Hay-Tithes, \u00a33. 6s. 8c?. ; Tithes of three Mills, 10s. In the Ninth thus ascertained, the Assessors certified that the Abbot of Shrews bury's Temporalities in the Parish were included.35 By this they meant the land which had at a previous period constituted the Glebe of Condover Church, and also whatever the Abbot may have held in demesne at Betton, Brompton, or Cantlop. The Valor of 1534\u20145 names Richard BromhaU as Rector of Byr rynton, and values the Church in gross at \u00a320. 12s. per annum. The Pensions to Lichfield Cathedral and Shrewsbury Abbey were stiU chargeable on this Income. The Procurations were 6s. 8c?. and the Synodals 6s. But besides, a Pension of 30s. was payable to the Abbot of Haughmond, aU which charges reduced the Rectory to a net value of \u00a310. 12s.36 The Pension to Haughmond Abbey here mentioned may, I be lieve, be thus accounted for.

This right, or the greater part of it, the Abbot seems to have surrendered to the Rector of Berrington, in exchange for a Pension of 30s. chargeable on Berrington Rectory. This ar rangement was probably made in or before the fifteenth Century. Abbot Burnell's Ordinance of Sept. 29, 1459, alludes to this pen sion, but not in very distinct terms. It seems to me that the Abbot then allotted 20s. thereof to the Salary of the Claustral Prior and 10s. to the Salary of the Sub-Prior of Haughmond, reserving the balance of the tithes of Eaton Mascott (that is, what ever part thereof was not commuted into a Pension) to himself.37 Thomas, Abbot of Haughmond, in his declaration for the Valor of 1535-6, makes no mention of the Tithes of Eaton Mascott nor of the Pension which mainly represented the same. This omission is usual where a particular item of Revenue was specifically aUotted to the Officers of a Convent. However, the Ministers' Accounts of 1541-2 give among the Assets of the Dissolved Abbey the foUow ing item, \u2014 Eyton Market, Firma decimarum, \u00a32.38 Here we have, I doubt not, the Tithes of Eaton Mascott, though 30s. of the sum should rather have been described as a Pension than a Ferm.

This was on the usual presentation of the Abbot and Convent of Shrewsbury ; but Harley covenants to resign if the Bishop should be put to trouble by any one in conse quence of admitting him.42 Harley exchanged preferments with \u2014 Stephen de Chelaston, late Incumbent of the Chantry of St. Andrew in Lichfield Cathedral.

In endeavouring to under stand Domesday, I have always found that a collection of parallel passages illus trates a particular phrase far better than any existing commentary. Thus in the present case we may cite the passage where certain Sochcmen are described, \u2014 qui habent terras suas in dominio et qui petunt dominos ubi volunt ; or where a Freeholder is described, qui tenebat dimidiam hidam et poterat abire sine licentid domini ipsius mansionis. cum terra ; \u2014 non potuit recedere ab ec clesia (vide supra, Vol. Ill, p. 300) ; \u2014 tres Radchenistresnonpoterant de hoc Manerio separari. 2 The Saxon Inland is supposed to have been equivalent to the Norman de mesne, and the Saxon Outland to the tenementary land of the Normans (In troduction to Domesday, p. lxxiij,note 8). The word Inland seems to be occasionally used in Domesday for the more ancient part of the demesne, such as it existed in Saxon times (ibidem). This explanation by no means satisfies the above passage ; but I can offer no better. 3 The Haia was a part of the wood en closed by fences, into which the beasts were driven. A Firm Haye was probably nothing more than such an enclosure in good repair. The disqualification opposed to such a franchise is represented in such passages as the following. \u2014 Non potuit recedere 4 Domesday, so. 254, b, 1."], [495, "49 LONGNOR. Leaving to the notes an explanation of one or two expressions in the above passage, I will here attend to its more important sig nificancies. \u2014 All that I have said under Berrington, relative to Manors held by Azo, as Rainald's Tenant at Domesday, holds good with respect to Azo's Manor of Lege, if we identify that Manor with the Longe nolre of the thfrteenth century and the Longnor of a later date. Under any other hypothesis than that these Manors are identical, we cannot instance any modern Manor which will aptly represent the Domesday Lege, nor can we fix upon any probable Domesday type for the modern Manor of Longnor. By analogy, therefore, and by the Proof negative, we are entitled to assume that the Lege of Domesday is now represented by Longnor. But what was it, then, that Domesday alludes to as the Caput of this Manor ? Where was that Inland and ungeldable estate which Roger Venator held, not under Rainald the Sheriff, but under the Norman Earl ? Analogy again directs us to look for some estate in this quarter held in later times by the Barons of Pulverbatch (Roger Venator's representa tives), and so held, not under Fitz Alan, but in capite ofthe Crown. This research I leave to the sequel. As regards Longnor itself, the first notice which I have thereof subsequent to Domesday, is in Azo Bigot's grant of half a hide there to Shrewsbury Abbey. In this instance the place is variously written as Langanara or Longanalra. Azo Bigot, as I have already explained, was identical with the Azo oi Domesday. Other particulars of him and his descendants I have given under Abdon.5 As to the estate at Longnor thus acquired by Shrewsbury Abbey, that must form the subject of a future and distinct notice. I think it very possible that, like Berrington, Longnor was in volved in the Knight's Fee which, in 1165, was held by Hamo de Sancto Remigio, under Fitz Alan. At all subsequent periods, how ever, of which I treat, Fitz Alan's immediate Tenant here was the elder House of Le Strange; and the Stranges were Mesne Lords over the Family of Sprencheaux, who were the tenants-in-fee. Of this FamUy I now proceed to speak. Alric Sprencheaux, otherwise known as Alric de Longenalra or Eylric de Wesseleg (i. e. Westley), has already been named as a Grantee of King Henry II in the Manor of Condover.6 I find Eilric and Gilbert de Wesseleg attesting a grant to Haugh mond Abbey, which probably passed between 1158 and 1172, and 5 Supra, Vol. IV, pp. 127, 128.

Be tween the years 1169 and 1176, Alric de Longenalra, with Ralph, his son, and Robert, his nephew, attest a Charter of Peter, Prior of Wenlock, which shall be given under Hughley. Before 1183 Alric Sprencheaux seems to have been succeeded by his son and heir, \u2014 Roger Sprencheaux (I), for it must be the latter who, as P. Sprenshose, attests Bishop Peche's appropriation of Lee Botwood Chapel to Haughmond Abbey. On March 12th, 1185, one of the earliest Fines on Record was levied at Woodstock, before Ranulph de Glanvill and other Barons and Justiciars of Henry II. This Fine was between the Abbot and Convent of Hagemon on the one hand, and Roger Sprengehose on the other, concerning certain land and Bosc lying between Lega (Lee Botwood) and Langenore, whereof there had been Plea in the Curia Regis, The agreement was, that Sprengehose should hold the premises in dispute, under the Abbot and Convent, for his life, and at a rent of 6s. per annum, payable at Michaelmas. After his death his heirs should hold the premises under the Abbot and Convent, in fee and inheritance, and should be quit of the said rent of 6s. But the Abbot was to have, together with the body of the said Roger (when deceased), aU the Mill of Langenore, wholly and for ever, and as fuUy as Roger had himself held it; \u2014 was also to have a third part of the live-stock of the said Roger. But the Wood aforesaid was to be so far in common as that either contracting party should take therefrom things necessary to his own use. They were also to divide the profits and pannage thereof equally. The future boundary of the land and bosc in dispute was lastly settled to be this. \u2014 From Bottestret to the stank of Langenore Mill, and from Fulefen to Bavcnesac, and so on to Noteleg (Netley), and so along the Sichet to the boundaries of Smedicot (Smethcott), and to High RudingA About this time I find Roger Sprengehose attesting a Charter of his seigneural Lord, John le Strange II.8 I also find that he was a Tenant in the Fee of Pulverbatch. It will have been before the year 1189 (because apparently in her husband's Ufetime), that \"Emma de Pulverbatch, wife of Sir Herbert de Castello, gave to Haughmond Abbey 3 shillings rent which Roger de Wesseleg was used to pay yearly out of his land.

Emma de Pulverbatch, apparently when a Widow, and if so, between 1189 and 1193, further increased this grant. She gave the land which Roger de Wesseleg held in Pulverbatch, together with aU his services, for maintenance of the lights before the High Altar of the Church of Haughmond. Witnesses, Bar tholomew de Girros, Martin fitz William.9 So then, Roger de Wesseleg, alias Roger Spencheaux, was Tenant not only of Lognor under Le Strange, but also of something now (1189-93) reputed to be in Pulverbatch. We have, I doubt not, in these combined tenures a reflex of that mixed status which, a century before, Domesday had described when treating of the Manor of Lege. The Seigneury of each tenure remained distinct, just as analogy would have led us to expect, but the two were held by a Feoffee in common. Something then in the direction of Pulverbatch must be taken to have been the Inland Caput of the Domesday Manor of Lege. The only difficulty is, that the Deed last quoted states Roger Wesseleg's tenure to be in Pulverbatch itself. This is soon explained. The Domesday Manor of Pulverbatch was only two hides. In 1255 it had grown to he five hides. This was clearly owing to the intermediate annexation of a considerable territory which Domesday had treated as distinct from Pulverbatch. I shall say more of this transfer under Pulverbatch. Here it is sufficient to have accounted for part of the increase, and to have shown what probably became of Roger Venator's Inland tenement in the Manor of Lege. At the Assizes of 1203 we have Roger Sprenghose as a Knight and as a Juror in causes of Grand Assize. At the Forest-Iter of March 1209 he is named, apparently as having had to do with the assessment of some former imhladements within Regard of the Long Forest. He himself was among the assessed. It was probably at a late period of his life that Roger Sprenghose came to an agreement with Haughmond Abbey which materially altered the terms of the Fine of 1185. This agreement, \"made in the full County-Court of Salop,\" but not attested by witnesses, describes the Wood as \" the Bosc of Lega (i.e. Lee Botwood) and Longenolre, which is called Mutlewood.\"10 The Abbot and Sprenghose now divide it equally between them.

The Wood thus divided was bounded as follows : \u2014 from Muttehesel down along a trench to a great alder-tree which stood at the extremity of John Brito's Assart ; thence through the field of Longenholre and of Dodinton (Dorrington) to the Sichet of Neteleg, and thence up along the Sichet to Rudingenord, thence along Rudingway to Muttehesel aforesaid. The subdivisions agreed upon here follow, but are not worth transcribing, except that they mention the Assart of Richard de Seinton. The part towards Rudingeway was to remain to the Abbot ; that towards the field of Logenholre to Sprenghose. Reservation is made of an indepen dent grant which Sprenghose had given to the Abbey, viz. a strip of Sprenghose's own wood, three perches in width, and, in length, as far as the said wood abutted on the field of Lega (Lee Botwood). Both parties sealed the agreement.11 At the Assizes of November 1221 it was recorded that Roger Sprenghos, having served the office of Coroner for the County, was deceased. His son and heir was amerced 20s. by the Justices, for not appearing to answer for the term of his Father's office. Thomas 'de Lege was surety for this Fine ; Robert de Wudecot was surety for another Fine which \u2014 Roger Sprenghose (II) incurred at the same Assizes for with drawing a suit of novel disseizin which he had against WUliam Hunffaund, concerning a tenement in Lowenalre. There is nothing in the style or the testing clause of the following agreement which does not tally with the idea that it was a compo sition made out of Court, soon after the Assizes of 1221, and which in fact put a stop to the litigation just alluded to. The names Hunffaund and Hunald are simUar enough to be identical. \u2014 Sciant presentes et futur i quod hcec est finalis concordia facta inter Rogerum Sprehinghose tenentem et Willelmum Hunald petentem, scilicet quod Rogerus tenens et Willelmus petens in tali forma conve nerunt, quod Rogero remanebit dimidia pars nemoris de cooperto, scilicet ilia pars apud Har lyd et Lallelyd per istas divisas, scilicet de volatu quod suit Roberti filii Alwredi antravers Sullakemor per trancheum usque ad Kusibroc ad vadum de Benetleya et deinde Kusy broc acontrewale usque ad trancheum desuper locum qui dicitur Thuaheth et deinde trancheum usque ad grossam quercum qu\u00e6 stat ad Acysvey, et deinde Acyswey ascendendo usque ad Hetvehtsty et deinde Hewehtsty usque ad Lude, et post de Lude-Sparkeheswey usque a la fose qu\u00e6 est opposita exteriori cornel\u00e6 assarti Walteri Luctoris, 11 Harleian MSS. ut supra."], [499, "53 LONGNOR. et de cornerd Walteri Luctoris contrewal La Haie de Frodesley usque ad predictum volatum quod suit Roberti filii Alvredi ; et volatum illud remanebit Rogero Sprehinghose cum predicto bosco, tenendum et habendum quiete et libere in omnibus libertatibus, Rogero et here dibus suis, sine aliqua reclamacione Willelmi vel heredum suorum in posterum.

The Master complained that Roger required the same right of common in the Bosc afore said as he (the Master) had in Roger's land, whilst Roger performed no such service to the Master as would entitle him to such a right. The Fine was, that the Master gave up to Roger one-third (saving 12 acres) of the said Bosc, viz. that part which reached from the \"dyke of Kemeshall to Wisebroc, and thence to Hevedsti, and onwards to the dyke which was under the alder marked with a cross\"; \u2014 to hold to Roger and his heirs, in demesne, under the Master and Brethren for ever, at a rent of 12c?.

In August 1226 Roger Sprenghose was one of the Jurors who made Inquest as to the Forest of Stiperstones, and in or about the same year he attests a grant of Peter de Eyton to Shrewsbury Abbey.13 Very little, if at all, later must we date the Charter whereby \" Roger Sprenghose, Lord of Longenolre\" gave the MiU of Longenolre to Haughmond Abbey in pure and perpetual almoign. He gave it apparently as an original gift, and without any allusion to his Father's previous negotiation on the subject. He gave it with the Suit and Multure and Toll of the whole Vill of Longe nolre, as well as of his own Household. He also gave aU that Alder-copse which lay near the Mill, and allowed all means and appliances necessary to maintain the Mill-stank ; also a place near the MUl-door for winnowing. He gave the whole watercourse, and covenanted that neither he nor his heirs should ever divert the same from the place called Ancre Parrok to the place where Polle brok faUs into the Conede, and thence to Edrichesleg, and thence past Hardemedewe, and so past Birchul and past Weysebrok, and thence past the Mulnefurlong, and so down to the MiU itself. He also gave and allowed the pathway which led from Frodesley, and the road which led from Lydeley, to the said Mill, and all roads for teams, horses, or foot-passengers, which led to the said Mill through the Fill of Longenolre, or elsewhere, and which had ever been used in the time of any of his ancestors. He covenanted further that neither he nor his heirs would ever construct any other MiU in the territory of Longenlore to the injury of the said MU1. Wit nesses, \u2014 Sir John le Strange, Sir Thomas Corbet, Sir Finan (Vivian) de Roshale, Sir Philip de Stepleton, Sir Richard de Lechton (Leighton), and William de Drayton, Chaplain.14 Such were the precautions taken in those days to guard and fence about that treasure, much coveted by Monks, \u2014 a Manor-Mill. In April 1230, Roger Sprenghose accompanied King Henry III in his first expedition into Brittany. A patent of Protection, dated June 15, at Nonetas, names him among those who were thus em ployed. The Shropshire Pipe-Roll of 1232 indicates his safe return, for he is debited half a merk as Surety for some Litigant. A Patent of Nov. 2, 1234, names him as Justice to deliver Shrewsbury Gaol on the 24th of the same month. About the same time, as \" Roger 13 Salop Chartulary, No. 2S0. | 14 Charter in possession of Edward I Corbett, Esq., of Longnor."], [501, "55 LONGNOR. Sprenghose, Lord of Longenholre,\" he confirmed to the Abbot of Haughmond his Father's agreement as to the division of the Bosc of Mittelwodc, quit-claiming in addition, for himsetf and heirs, aU right of any kind within Lega in Botwode, or within the Abbot's boundaries towards Lega. His Charter specifically releases aU right of common. (Such a right, it will be remembered, his Father's Agreement had retained in the Abbot's share of the divided Bosc.) In return, the Abbot and Convent allowed him, whenever he chose, to assart his own share of the said Bosc, saving to them and to their Chapel of Lega (Lee Botwood) all tithes arising from such assarted places, \" because that previously to the said Partition (by his Father) the Abbot and Convent had the whole ground in their possession.\" The Charter further aUows to the Abbot and his men of Lega common pasture for aU their animals throughout Roger's whole Manor of Longenholre; also Roger quit- claims all right to the Moor near the Abbot's Mill of Longenholre, aU which moor, to gether with the Alder-copse and all rights of road, the Abbot and Convent were henceforth to enjoy unreservedly. Witnesses, \u2014 John fitz Alan, John le Strange, Vivian de Roshale, John Honald, Wil liam de Draiton, Thomas de Stratton, and Roger de Smethcot.15 The Forest Perambulation of 1235 has two allusions to Longnor. \" The Bosc of Wimbrinton (Womerton) had been much wasted of old time, and trees had been fallen there and given for repairs at Shrewsbury and Stretton Castles, and to Roger Sprengehos to for tify his House at Langenalre, and this was by Precept of Hugh de NeviU, then Justice of the Forests.\" Again, the Commissioners had \" taken View of the two Boses of Langenafre. These were weU kept, but, in the Bosc of * * *, Roger Sprengoles had in the time of liberty 16 cut two trenches, and since the time of liberty he had assarted them,\" that is, I presume, the land which they encompassed. In 1240 we have the inaccurate but easily amended Record, which I have already quoted under Berrington, viz. that of the fees of Hugh de Kilpec, Roger Sprinchose and the heirs of Hugh le Strange held one fee in Biriton and Longelorn. The fact probably was, that Roger Sprenghose held half a fee in Longnor, and the heirs of Hugh le Strange half a fee in Berrington, under John le Strange (III), who held under John fitz Alan (II) .

The next notice which I have of Longnor, or its Lords, intro duces, as I believe, a new personage, viz. : \u2014 Roger Sprencheaux III, but I have no evidence to show the exact period at which this succession took place. A Patent of May 15, 1251, orders that \"Roger Sprenghose and Richard de Stretton shall not be put on any Assize, etc., so long as they shall adhere to their fealty to the Crown and be in the service or fol lowing (obsequio) of Griffin ap Wenunewen.\" Here, then, I think we have the first hint of that connection which seems to have asso ciated the House of Sprenghose with the Princes of Powis for more than half a century. The Hundred-RoU of 1255 tells us that \" Roger Sprenchose holds Long', for one hide, under John le Strange. He pays 8c?. for Stretivard and Motfee, and does suit to both County and Hundred.\"17 The decrease on the Domesday hidage is here to be observed, also that the Seigneury of Fitz Alan is altogether omitted. The third Roger Sprencheaux lived at an eventful period, but by following his Seigneur, the third John le Strange, in the path of Loyalty, he attained to a position of great eminence. After the Battle of Evesham and the restoration of Monarchy, the first notice which I find of Roger Sproueheths (as his name is written) is on the Forest Assize- Roll of 1267, where he stands surety for an amercement inflicted on Robert Corbet for trespass against Venison. About this time he appears to have had a grant of the forfeited estates of Sir Hugh Wrottesley of Wrottesley. The Charter by which Roger Sprenghose Lord of Longenolre (as his name ought to be written) quit-claimed and restored these lands to Sir Hugh, is in fact a composition under the Dictum de KenilworthA Sprenghose got 60 merks for the surrender. About the same time, he obtained the restoration of a Mill in Condover Manor, of which his Family had been deprived for forty years. At the Assizes of October 1272 he appears as a Knight and a Juror in causes tried by Grand Assize. He also had himself a suit of mort d'ancestre with Haughmond Abbey for a meadow in Longenore. He, how ever, styling himself \" Roger Sprenchose III,\" quit-claimed his right by a subsequent Deed, attested by Richard de Eton, William Rot. Hundred.

Marscote, Richard Burnel of Langeley, William de Stepleton, and PhUip de Smethcote.19 I should assign the same date to another Charter of \" Roger Sprenghose tertius\" (as he styles himself), whereby he concedes and confirms the MU1 of Longanolre to Haughmond Abbey.

Sperughose (as his name is printed) in the important post of Constable of Montgomery. He writes to Walter de Merton, then Chancellor of England, to say that he had duly directed certain of his people to attend the Abbots of Haughmond and Dore on January 20th last, when those Com missioners were appointed to go to the Ford beyond Montgomery, and there receive the oath of Fealty, due from Lewellyn ap Gruffyth, Prince of Wales, to Edward I, who had recently succeeded to the throne of England. \" The Commissioners,\" says the Constable, \"waited at that Ford till long past noon, but Lewellyn neither came nor sent any message.\"21 Roger Sprenghose had custody of the Royal Manor of Stratton-dale (Church Stretton) from 21st October, 1273, till December 10, 1274; but he had the King's Order to give all the issues thereof to Hawise wife of Griffin ap Wenhunwin.23 In 1275 Roger Sprenghose and Reginald de Leye were commissioned to assess the tax of the Fifteenth in the Counties of Salop and Stafford.23 In March 1276, Sir Roger Sprenghose was Foreman of the Jury which made Inquest on the estates of John le Strange deceased. From the year 1279 till May 1286 Sir Roger Sprengehose served 19 The original Deed at Longnor has the Grantor's seal remaining, viz. a shield, charged with two Lions passant and a Label of three points.

This Seal is the one given among the Illustrations. 20 Harleian MS. 446, Quatern xh. sos. 1, 2. This Charter (except that it omits the word dedi before concessi) has all the appearance of an original Grant. It is in fact nearly a verbal transcript of that Grant of the second Roger Spreng hose, which passed about 1226. Later in hfe (as we shall see) Roger Sprenghose III adopted the much more intelligible course of inspecting, reciting, and confirming his Predecessor's Charter. This Deed gives A. as the initial letter of the cotemporary Abbot of Hagheiuon's name. It calls the meadow Herberdes medeme, and the Grantor styles himself Rogerus le Esprenghosc tertius. 21 F\u0153dera, I, 499. 22 Rot. Pip. 4 Edw. I, Salop. 23 Rot.

During the same period he occurs as interested in the forfeited estates of Henry de Hastings, for in January 1285 I find John de Hastings, the heir, impleading Roger Sprenghose, and endeavouring to obtain redemption of his lands in virtue of the Dictum de Kenil worth?* Sir Roger Sprenghose is said to have served the office of Sheriff again in 18 Edward I (1289-90). If so, William de Titteleye (who appears on the Pipe-Roll as Sheriff of that year) was only Sprenghose's Deputy, though afterwards he was Sheriff absolute. At the Assizes of October 1292, Bogo de KnoviU, Roger Sprengehos, and Robert Corbet are enumerated in that order, as Sheriffs no longer in office, but who were still living and ready to give account of their respective periods of office. SimUarly Walter (it should be WUliam) de Tytnelegh is entered as the existent Sheriff. To the period when Sir Roger Sprenghose and William de Titteleye were associated in office, I assign the Charter whereby the former (styling himself \"Roger Sprenghose tercius Dominus de Longenolre\") inspects, recites, and confirms that Charter of Longnor Mill which I have assigned to the yrear 1226. The Inspeximus speaks of Roger Sprenghose, who made the original grant, as the present Grantor's Antecessor, while there is every reason to think that he was his Father. I have elsewhere stated that the meaning of the word Antecessor in these Charters is Predecessor in estate or office. The witnesses of Roger Sprenghose Ill's Inspeximus are WiUiam de Titneleg and Robert de Stepleton, Knights ; Richard Clerk, of Longenholre, Roger de Smethcote, William fitz Adam of WUdeiiey, John Champeneys of Wilderley, and WiUiam Beadle of Longen holre.25 Sir Roger Sprenghose was one of the Knights of the Shire returned for Shropshire, in November, 1295, to the Parlia ment then held at Westminster. Of the five Knights who in June 1300 joined in making the great Perambulation of the Forests of Shropshire, Sir Roger Sprenghose was one. The latest that I hear of Sir Roger Sprenghose is his attestation of a lease granted by Gilbert, Abbot of Haughmond, on October 21, 1304. This Lease will appear under Lee Botwood. In January 1311 we hear of one Emma Sprenghose, who then devoted her self to the life of an Anchoret in St. George's Cemetery, at Shrewsbury. I cannot fix her place in the family Pedigree.

He has already occurred to us under various dates from 1286 to 1316.27 In a Deed which I shall have to refer to hereafter, his relationship to Sir Roger is expressly declared. Before I proceed to speak of Sir Roger Sprenghose's Successors at Longnor, I should notice a series of six Manorial Deeds in which he appears as Grantor. 1. As Roger Sprenghose, Lord of Longenolre, he gives to Richard Clerk, son of Osbert de Dudelburi, for two merks, two acres of his land in Longenolre, to hold in fee, at a rent of one rose. Kelmeshale and the field of Linley e are mentioned as localities of the grant, and WUliam le Budel and Richard Clerk himself, as holders of ad joining lands. The Deed is attested by Roger de Smethecote, John Champeneys, John de Biriton, WiUiam fitz Enge, and William le Budel. Only a fragment of the seal remains. The date of this Deed is probably between 1291 and 1298, which are also the limits of the three foUowing. 2. The same Roger Sprenghose grants to the same Richard Clerk, and to Emma his wife, a certain footpath, leading from their house into the Fill of Longenolre. The path is described as traversing the field of Longerhull and the garden of Peter fitz Peter, and passing thence between the house and the grange of the said Peter into the high-road. Sprenghose further allows the Grantees to enlarge the moat (fossatum) around their house (curiam), making it 12 feet wider than the old moat. Witnesses, \u2014 Roger de Smethcote, John Cham peneys, John de Biriton, Walter de Burton, Henry de Wesseleg, WiUiam de Haywode, John Selimon, William Beadle, of Longe nolre. The seal of this Deed is charged with Arms; \u2014 two lions passant, and a label of three points. Whether the family of Spreng hose bore this Coat as Cadets or as Vassals of the House of Le Strange is a question of much doubt. 3. Roger Sprenghose, Lord of Longenolre, gives to WUliam, called Le Budel, of Longenolre, for \u00a344. and for 6c?. rent, all the land which William Twychelone and Agnes, widow of Adam de Bottefeld, sometime held; also aUows that the Grantee may have 30 hogs and 1 boar quit of pannage in the woods of the Manor.

The following localities are named in this Deed, viz.

The witnesses are Roger de Smethecote, Richard Clerk, William BudeU, John de Byriton, aud Richard de Eton. The seal is as the last. With Roger Sprenghose (III) we have now done. Between the years 1304 and 1310, Longnor, with other lands at Condover, Lidley, and Leie (probably Lee Botwood?), passed from him to Griffin de la Pole, but whether by inheritance, by gift, by bequest, or by sale, is all uncertain. If there was any blood-relationship in the matter it is more probable that the person related to Spreng hose was the wife of Griffin de la Pole than the said Griffin him self, who was a younger son. Griffin de la Pole, otherwise caUed Gruffith Vachan, was in fact fifth son of Griffin ap Gwenhunwin, Prince of Powis. His eldest brother, Owen de la Pole, better known as Owen of Arustle, being Prince of Powis, died in 1293, leaving two infant children, Griffin ap Owen, and Hawyse. The custody of these Infants was first, that is, in 1295, granted by King Edward I to their Grand mother Hawyse,30 who was widow of Griffin ap Gwenhunwin, but at the same time an Englishwoman, for she was a daughter of the third John le Strange, of Nesse and Cheswardine. In the first year of Edward II (1307-8), though Hawyse last-mentioned was stiU alive, the King, for some cause or other, gave the custody of Pole Castle and of aU the lands, late Owen de la Pole's, to Griffin de la Pole,31 \u2014 who being, as I have said, younger brother of Owen de la Pole, was son of Hawyse last-mentioned, and Uncle of the two Infants, Griffin ap Owen and Hawyse ap Owen. Till these heirs came of age, Griffin de la Pole was to hold their lands. In 2 Edward II (1308-9), Griffin ap Owen died without issue,33 and his sister Hawyse, becoming Princess of Powys, was married in 3 Edward II (1309-10) to Sir John de Cherleton. In November 1310 died Hawyse, Grandmother of Hawyse, Princess of Powys,33 when her dower, out of the estates of Griffin ap Wenhunwin, passed at once to Hawyse, wife of John de Cherleton. I suppose that on 30 Originalia, I, p- 88. 31 Originalia, I, p. 159- 32 Inquisition, 2 Edward II, No. 79. 33 Inquisition, 4 Edward II, No. 39."], [508, "62 LONGNOR. the marriage of this Hawyse aud John, in 1309-10,34 Griffin de la Pole's custody of his niece's lands had ceased. However, his interest in Powys-land continued very great, for a Writ of Edward II's, dated June 18, 1310, not only makes him a Commissioner to levy forces in Wales for the then proposed invasion of Scotland, but definitely names him and John de Cherlton as the persons who, it was expected, would allow a contingent of 400 men to be enhsted in \" their land of Powys.\"35 It is at this juncture that Griffin de la Pole appears in succession to Roger Sprenghose of Longnor, as the following Deeds will prove. 1. On December 13, 1310, Griffin de la Pole, Lord of Longe norle, grants to William de Acton Burnel, Clerk, and his heirs, of his body, a messuage and half-virgate in the vill of Longenorle, which WUUam de Breustere had previously held of the Grantor. He grants also the assart caUed the Neustokkynge and 6 acres now to be assarted, and a place in Hethei whereon to build, and hous bote, heybote, firewood, and pannage for swine, free of all charge. The reserved rent is a pair of gilt spurs, and the Deed is dated at Longenorle and attested by Roger de Smethcote, Richard de Eton, John de Biriton, Walter de Borton, Richard Clerk, and WiUiam Beadle of Longenorle. The seal is a Lion rampant, the weU known bearing of the Princes of Powys, and it has this legend : \u2014 S' Griffini fil' Griffini de Powys.35 2. On December 19, 1310, the same Grantor expedites another Deed quit-claiming the same premises to the Grantee, but reserving the rent of gilt spurs. This quit-claim is sealed and attested as the last Deed. 3. On February 20, 1311, the same Grantor again quit-claims the premises, but in this Deed, which has the same testing clause, he further remits and quit-claims the previously reserved rent. It would seem that Griffin de la Pole's title to Longnor had not as yet been formally acknowledged by the Seigneural Lord, but\u2014 4. On March 3, 1312, Edmund, Earl of Arundel, certifies, by Writ dated at Clun, that he has received the homage of Griffin de la Pole for his (Griffin's) Manor of Longenolre which is held of the Earl in capite,36 for which homage the Earl and his heirs wUl 34 Claus. 5 Edward II, m. 2. 35 Parliamentary Writs, IV, 1304. 35 This Seal will be found among the of cadency is the Ring, at the top of, and outside, the shield. 36 An expression which seems to ignore any mesne-tcnure of Le Strange of Nesse.

To this Deed is attached a small seal of the Earl's arms, viz. a Lion rampant. 5. Ten days after this, viz. on March 11, 1312, Griffin de la Pole grants and concedes to Sir Fulk, son of Robert le Strange, all his Manor of Longenolre with all its appurtenances, as in homages, rents, services both of free-men and Villains, houses, gardens, meadows, boses, feedings, pastures, moors, marshes, stanks, vivaries, waters, mills, escheats, and reversions. He also grants all his lands and tenements, which he had in Conedoure, Lidleie, and Leie (per haps Lee Botwood), \u2014 to have and to hold to the said Fulk, his heirs and assigns, of the Chief Lords of the fee, by performance of all services due. Witnesses, \u2014 Sir William le Botiler, Sir Roger Corbet, Sir Richard de Harleie, Sir William de Lodelowe, Sir Robert de Stepleton, Sir Richard de Lechton, Roger de Smethcote and Richard de Eton. This Deed passed at Salop, evidently in a fuU County-Court. It has the Grantor's seal attached, viz. a Lion rampant within a Border engrailed.37 6. By a second deed of the same day, simUarly sealed, but dated at Longnor, Griffin de la Pole gives to Sir Fulk le Strange, for a sum of money now paid, all his goods and chattels found in the Manor of Longenolre, both moveable and immoveable. This transfer of his Shropshire lands and effects by Griffin de la Pole was I think a mere Sale, suggested or necessitated by his circumstances at the moment. I would point out by the way that the Purchaser of Longnor etc. was the Vendor's first Cousin, that is son of Robert le Strange, brother of Hawise le Strange, Griffin's mother. Griffin de la Pole had chUdren of his own and was living long after this transaction. I will briefly state what is further known of him. In the very year in which he disposed of Longnor he asserted a claim to Pole Castle, and raising a great power of the Welsh, actuaUy laid siege to that fortress. It was defended by his Niece who, with her husband John dc Cheiiton, happened to be residing there. Though Hawyse obtained the sobriquet of Gadarn or The Hardy for her conduct on this occasion, her Uncle's schemes were only defeated by the energy of Roger de Mortimer of Wigmore, whom Edward II instructed to support Hawyse and her husband.38 But although humbled for a season, Griffin de la Pole 37 This Seal I give among the Illustra- tions.

It will be remembered that this very land had once been in the hands of Roger Spreng hose. It does not appear however that Griffin de la Pole's title thereto arose in the same way as his title to Longnor. A Writ- Close of King Edward II assumes Mecheyn Iscoit to belong to the Lady of Powys, and orders the Sheriff of Shropshire to summon the said Griffin before the King, on February 3, 1313.39 On the 16th of October in that same year, Griffyth de la Pole is included in the pardon granted to the adherents of the Earl of Lancaster who had participated in the death of Piers Gaveston. And again, a Writ of November 1, 1318, names Griffin de la Pole as one of the adherents of Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, who were pardoned for all felonies and trespasses up to the 7th of August preceding.40 The Welsh Chronicles inform us of a final settlement between Hawyse Gadarn and her Uncles, whereby the Principality of Powys was settled upon Hawyse and her heirs general, whilst the portions of the said Uncles were limited to them and their heirs male, with remainder to Hawyse and her heirs.41 This is not the place to discuss how such an entaU may have affected the succession of Griffin de la Pole, who, as far as I have seen, had none but female children. I find incidental mention of his two Sons-in-law, viz. Sir Roger Chamber and Hugh Montgomery ; but as neither they nor any other of Griffin's hens were concerned in Longnor, I now return to \u2014 Sir Fulk le Strange, his successor there. \u2014 Of him, as first Baron of Blackmere, as husband of Eleanor Gif fard, and as Lord of Sutton Maddock and Corfham, I have already spoken at some length.42 In the Nomina Villarum of March 1316, he appears as Lord of the Vill of Longenolre.43 On July 16, 1316, 39 Claus. 6 Edw.

It recites that on May 17, 1290, Owen ap Griffin ap Wenliunwin had agreed with his brother Griffin, that the latter should hold the whole land of Mercheyn Iscoit under the former, during, their Mother Hawyse's life, but that on her death the said land should revert to Owen and his heirs, and that Griffin should have, instead, the land \u25a0I\" Dendor (then held by his mother in dower, but the reversion whereof was Owen's) ; \u2014 to hold to Griffin and his heirs, under Owen and his heirs for ever. The cause of Edward II's present VCrit was a complaint by John and Hawyse de Cherleton, viz. that, though Griffin had had Dendor on his mother's death, he still detained Mercheyn Iscoit. 40 Parliamentary Writs, IV, 1304. 41 Powel, p. 157. 42 Supra, Vol. II, pp. 120-123; Vol. V, pp. 147, 163. 13 Parliamentary Writs, IV, 399."], [513, "65 LONGNOR. \u25a0 as Fulco Extrancus, Lord of Corfham, he grants to William de Acton BurneU and the heirs of his body a messuage and half- virgate in Longenolre which WiUiam de Allecote had previously held.

This Deed is dated at Longenolre and scaled with the Grantor's Arms, \u2014 two Lions passant.44 On February 5, 1321, Griffin de la Pole styling himself son of Griffin ap Guenonwen, and being then at Whitchurch (Album Monasterium) , releases and quit-claims to Sir Fulk le Straunge, Lord of Whitchurch, his heirs and assigns, all right in the Manor of Longenolre. Witnesses, \u2014 Sir Roger Corbet, John de Leyborne. Thomas de Roshale, William de Sanford, Knights ; John de Gua renne, Richard Ford, and John de Lee. This deed is sealed with the Arms of Griffin de la Pole as in 1310.45 It does not appear why such a security was given or required. Fulk le Strange of Blackmere, or of Whitchurch, as he was more usually called, had three sons whom it is necessary now to notice. These were John (his eventual heir and successor), Fulk, and Hamo. It becomes more probable than ever that Fulk le Strange acquired Longnor by purchase, when we find him settling it on his younger sons. There are two Deeds dated at Shrewsbury on April 25, 1322, and attested by the same witnesses, viz. by Sir William le Botiler, Sir Roger Corbet, Sir Fulk de Penebrugge, Sir William de Ercall, Sir Walter de Huggeford, Sir William de Sanford, and SU John de Chetewynde. Both Deeds are or have been sealed with the Arms of Sir Fulk le Strange, viz. two Lions passant, with the Legend S' Fulconis le Straunge. By oue of these Deeds Fulco Lestrange, Lord of Whiteminster, gives to Fulco Lestrange his son, his Manor of Longenolre, with its appur- tenances ;-\u2014 to hold of the Grantor and his heirs, to Fulco and the heirs of his body lawfully begotten, paying a rent of one rose to the Grantor and his heirs, and performing for the Grantor and his heirs all services due to the chief Lords of the Fee.

The consequent Inquest mentions his tenures at Whit church, Wrockwardine, Sutton, etc., but makes no mention of Longnor.47 Obviously, then, his fuller grant to his son Fulk was the one which had taken effect. I must now conclude summarily this branch of a subject which has already extended beyond my usual limits. Fulk le Strange of Longnor was deceased in 1375. He seems to have left only daughters to share his inheritance. One of the daughters, Margaret, released her share of Longnor, in 1375, to John Careles and Edward de Acton, whom I know to have been the husbands of Joan and EUanor, \u2014 Margaret's sisters. The line of Careles ended in a female married to John Corbett of Habberley, who thus obtained a moiety of Longnor as well as other Careles estates at Albrighton, Boningale, and Ryton.48 From these two persons descended the line of Corbett of Longnor, one of whom, Thomas Corbett, reconsolidated the Manor in the reign of James I by purchasing that moiety which, more than two centuries before, had been apportioned to Edward de Acton and his wife Elianor le Strange, but which during the interval had been sold and resold to several indifferent parties. 46 Charters at Longnor. whose granddaughter it was that first took a share of the Manor to a Careles. The explanation of this incongruity is ob vious after one glance at Roger Careles's Charter of Free \"Warren. It has been falsified. The word Bolinghale, which (as I know from the enrolment at the Tower) stood in the original grant, has disap peared, and the word Longnorole (or sometliing like it) has been inserted in stead. It is difficult to suppose that this falsification was intentional. It appears to me to be the work of some Scribe, at tempting to restore certain faded parts of the original document, by guess. Other words in the document have been re traced by the same hand with better 47 Inquisition, 17 Edw. II, No. 73. 48 A statement is given by Mr. Dukes (Antiquities, p. 295) from which we should infer that as early as the eleventh year of Edward I (1282-3) Roger Carlis was Lord of Longnor. This is a complex error. The Charter of Free Warren al luded to, is by Edward II, not Edward I. The original is in possession of Edward Corbett, Esq., of Longnor. The Great Seal attached, and the witnesses' names, prove it to be Edward II's, and in fact it is enrolled on the Charter Roll of his eleventh year. This makes the date of the Charter to have been January 8, 1318. But at that period (as I have shown in the above narrative) Longnor was in pos session of Fulk le Strange of Blackmore, success."], [515, "67 LONGNOR. Of Undertenants in Longnor I have several further notices. At the Assizes of 1203, Matilda, widow of one William, is suing Roger Sprenghose for dower. In 1250 an arrentation of 3d. was set upon Richard Picot for a quarter of an acre of Forest land in Longenholre. In 1262 William de Eton and Alan Gamage, both of Longenolre, were assessed for imbladements within regard of the Long Forest. At the Assizes of 1292 William fitz Engelard of Longenolre was a Juror for Condover Hundred, and appears with WiUiam Beadle of Longnenoure on another Inquest of that year. WUliam fitz Enge has occurred above as a witness of Roger Sprenghose's Deeds, towards the close of the thirteenth century. On January 7, 1319, Roger son of WUliam Enge of Longenolre leases for 33 years to Henry de Bosco a meadow between Bradleyespolle and the meadow of Richard fitz Roger, also certain cursones of land, when the tenure of Richard son of William Enge should cease therein. Witnesses, \u2014 Richard fitz Roger, Nicholas Pyk, Roger Thurlewynd.49 On July 4, 1319, the same Grantor gives the premises to the Lessee for a sum of money, and to hold of the chief Lords of the fee. Witnesses, Richard Clerk of Longenolre, WiUiam Bedell and others.49 On March 6, 1323, the same Grantor, as Roger son of William Engesone of Longenolre, grants for a sum of money to William de Acton and John his eldest son, their heirs and assigns, three acres of land and a meadow in Longenolre ; to hold of the Lords of the fee. Mittewode, Kelmeshal, The Lowe, The Hoo, and Aldetones medwe, are localities named as landmarks in this Deed ; also Richard Clerk and Richard Adies are adjoining tenants. The witnesses are John de Lee, Richard Clerk, WiUiam le Budel, Richard de Hoghton, Walter de Burton, Alexander de Waterdene, and Robert Inge.49 On March 27, 1323, the same Grantor quit-claims to William de Acton Burnel and John his eldest son, their heirs and assigns, his right in all lands which Simon Permentar of Wenlock and Agnes his wife formerly held as Agnes' dower in the inheritance of the Grantor in Longenholre, in which lands the said Simon and Agnes had previously enfeoffed the present Grantees for the term of Agnes' Use.

Previous to this, viz. on Nov. 15, 1322, Roger Thurlewynt of Longenolre grants for a sum of money, to the same WUliam de Acton Burnel and his son John, all the lands and tenements within and without the vill of Longenolre which he (the Grantor) had by feoffment of Sir Roger Sprenghose, Richard Clerk, or any other Feoffor ; \u2014 to hold of the Lords of the Fee.

Longnor Mill is not entered in Pope Nicholas's Taxation as a possession of Haughmond Abbey. The Valor of 1534-5 is similarly sUent, but perhaps the income from Lee Botwood included this item. Shrewsbury Abbey Fee. \u2014 We have heard of half a hide iu Longnor given by Azo Bigot (the Domesday Tenant) to Shrewsbury Abbey.50 There seem to have been Charters by some of the earlier Lords of Longnor whereby they granted 5*. rent, arising from their Demesne of Longenolre, to the same Abbey. This was probably in lieu of the land granted by Azo, which certainly the monks did not retain. Between the years 1270 and 1280 I am inclined to date a Deed whereby Robert (it should be Roger) Sprenghose, Lord of Longenolre, inspects the Charters of his Predecessors granting the said rent-charge of 5s. This Inspexi mus is attested by Sir Thomas Boterel, Hugh de Ley, WUUam de Stepleton, Richard de Eton, Hugh de Wlonkeslo (i.e. Longslow), and Engelard de PulUe.51 The following Deeds which seem to be parts of the same transaction and to have passed in or about the year 1279, show this rent-charge again commuted for land. By the first Deed Roger Sprenghose Lord of Longenolre gives in the name of exchange a place of land yielding 4s. rent, viz. half a virgate in Burton. Witnesses, \u2014 John de Lee, WUliam Mascot, Richard de Eton, Engelard de PolUeye, John de Prestcote, Adam le Bole, Henry Meyler, WUliam de Prestecote, and Adam le Pes- tur.51 The second is an agreement between John, Abbot of Shrews- 40 Charters at Longnor. fied him further with that Wygot who held Longner (upon Severn) under the Bishop of Chester at Domesday. Accor dingly they fixed in the latter Manor Azo Bigot's grant; \u2014 but Shrewsbury Abbey is not known ever to have possessed any thing in Longner upon Severn. 50 The Historians of Shrewsbury (Vol. II, p. 27) have made a mistake about this matter. Seeing that Azo Bigot who granted to Shrewsbury Abbey in Lan guenare and Abdon, was clearly that Azo who held the latter Manor at Domesday, they immediately and erroneously identi- 51 Salop Chartulary, Nos. 297-b, 298."], [517, "69 COUND bury (who became so in February 1279) and Sir Roger Sprenghose, concerning a certain annual rent of 5s.

LONGNOR CHAPEL. This was probably one of those affiliations of Condover Church which Bishop Clinton confirmed to Shrewsbury Abbey in the reign of Stephen.

Having, under Condover, given the etymology of this name, I proceed to state what Domesday says of the Manor : \u2014 \" The same Rainald (Vicecomes) holds Cuneet, Earl Morcar held it (in Saxon times).

We consequently learn but little from Records beyond the broad fea tures of its history. The Chartulary of Shrewsbury Abbey contains a curious grant, evidently of the first William fitz Alan ; but at what period of his career it passed, there is nothing to determine. He gives the Monks an annuity of one merk \" for the special purpose of buying wine wherewith masses were to be sung, to the intent that, by virtue of that sacrifice and by the merits of St. Peter and St. Paul, the Grantor's soul might be deUvered from the torment of everlasting thirst.\" The annuity was for the present to be chargeable on the rent of the Grantor's MiU of Coneta, tiU he should decide upon some land of his demesne, equal in value, and convey the same to the Church. The witnesses hereof were, Richard, the Grantor's Chaplain, and two Priests, named Heming and Ebrard.3 A matter which I have next to name is of exceeding interest, but it is only problematically connected with Cound. In 1165 Walter fitz Alan is enrolled as having two fees of new feoffment in the Barony of William fitz Alan.3 The latter was Nephew of Walter, and was in minority at the time. The Feoffor of Walter wiU there fore have been his deceased Brother WUUam, and the feoffment must have taken place between 1135 and 1160. There is no direct evidence proving where Walter fitz Alan's lands, thus acquired, lay. He, as I shall show hereafter, was Seneschal of Scotland and the Ancestor of the Royal House of Stuart. Obviously therefore his English Feoffments wUl have been surrendered by himself, or one of his Successors, for no such illustrious Tenants as the Seneschals and Kings of Scotland appear among the later Feudatories of Fitz Alan. I think it probable that Cound was one of the Manors thus temporarily held by Walter fitz Alan, or his immediate Successors. I can instance no other Shropshire Manor with equal probability as having been Walter fitz Alan's, and this general impression is strengthened by a circumstance. \u2014 A Survey of the Knights Tem plars' possessions in England, taken a.d. 1185, states, under the head Shropshire, that the Knights had a virgate of land at Coneton by gift of Walter fitz Alan. One Robert and his son Hamo, Te nants thereof, paid the Knights a rent of 5s.4 I think that by Coneton is meant Cound, but no estate in the latter place remained with either Templars or Hospitallers. 2 Salop Chartulary, No. 83. 3 Liber Niger, I, 144. 1 MS. ut supra, Vol. I, p. 363, note 479."], [519, "71 COUND I now pass over the greater part of a century, to state that on June 16, 1240, Cuuette was one of the Manors assigned for the dower of Hawise de Blaneminster, widow of the first John fitz Alan. A Charter of King Henry III, dated at Vasat (Bazats) on January 28, 1254, allows to John fitz Alan (II) the privilege of Free- Warren in his demesnes at Upton (Upton Magna), Wroxeter, Cuned, Harrenege, (Harnage), Acton (Acton Round), and other places.5 The Hundred Roll of 1255 says that \" Sir John fitz Alan holds the Manor of Conet, for 3i hides of land, and of the King (in capite) . It pays neither Stretward nor Motfee, nor does it any Suit, either to County or Hundred.\"6 This estimate of the extent of Cound is one hide less than that of Domesday. The difference was made up by a hide of land which formed the then distinct Manor of Harnage, which, as I shall presently show, was no longer in Fitz Alan's demesne. Cound, like Acton Round, already noticed, was part of the dower of MatUda de Verdon, widow of the second John fitz Alan.7 She remarried to Richard de Amundeville, and died Nov. 27, 1283. The Inquest which followed values the gross income of the Manor of Conede at \u00a319. 7s. 9d. The capital messuage, or Manor-house, was apparently ruinous or fallen (messuagium non edificatum). Among the receipts, mention is made of a certain custom caUed Wrmtak, which, with the Bosc and Pannage, yielded 6s. 8d. yearly.8 Cound now reverted to the estate of Richard fitz Alan, Earl of Arundel, who was Grandson of Matilda de Verdon, and who, having been born on Feb. 3, 1267, was now (1283) in minority. Cound was soon, however, redisposed of, being given in frank -marriage with MatUda fitz Alan to Philip Burnel, Nephew and then Heir expectant of Robert BurneU, Bishop of Bath and WeUs. This Matilda fitz Alan has been set down by Dugdale, and I believe all the Genealogists, as daughter of the said Richard, Earl of Arundel ; \u2014 an astonishing error, which the slightest attention to possibiUties and dates would have prevented. Her son, Edward BurneU, was bom July 22, 1287, that is, at a time when his alleged Grandfather, Richard fitz Alan, had not reached the age of twenty-one. Doubt less Matilda fitz Alan was the Sister of Richard, Earl of Arundel.

Hope Bowdler), Longdon, and Conede. As to Pleas-of-the-Crown and Ways, he denied his claim thereto, or exercise thereof. He exhibited Charters authorizing him to hold fairs and markets at Rushbury, Wootton, Hope Bowdler, and Longdon. As to Cound, he claimed a right to assize bread and beer there;9 and this was apparently over and above what he was questioned for ; indeed, the prosecution, as regards Cound, seems not to have been pressed by the Crown. Philip BurneU died June 26, 1294, seized, inter alia, of Cound, which he had held in frank-marriage conjointly with his wife MatUda. His service, due thereon to the Earl of Arundel, is stated to have been the finding of one horseman to serve in the wars of Wales.10 I find nothing further of Cound as held by any descendant of Philip Burnel. The precise time at which it reverted to the Fitz Alans I cannot determine. However, in the Nomina Villarum of March 1316 Edmund, Earl of Arundel, is set down as Dominus de Conede,11 \u2014 a hint that the Manor was again held in demesne by its Seignoral Lord. With the Fitz Alans it certainly remained for ages. Or Undertenants in Cound I notice the following. At the Assizes of November 1221, Robert de Bray was impleaded for dis seizing Isolda, daughter of Martin Kempe, of a free tenement in Shrewsbury and in Cunede. Robert de Bray's defence was, that Isolda's husband (unnamed), having slain a man, had taken Sanc tuary in one of the Shrewsbury Churches, and in due form abjured the realm. His land, as an Escheat, had been given by the King to the Defendant. Isolda repUed that the tenement for which she now sued was her dower, by gift of her said husband, whose out lawry she did not deny. The Court decided that no woman could hold a free tenement by virtue of the grant of a Felon. So the cause was adjourned sine die, and the Defendant declared to be quit therein (inde quietus) .la 9 Quo Waranto, p. 685, a.

On November 12, 1242, John de Hauckeston was summoned in Court at Westminster to answer Walter de Cunede, seeing that the said John had against the King's prohibition prosecuted the said Walter in Court-Christian for a lay -fee in Cunede ; to wit, for a rent of 10s. there. The said Walter had been impleaded in Chapter be fore the Dean of Morton, and had been excommunicated by the said Dean ; so he laid his damages at 100s. John de Hawkston now pleaded that he had not followed up his suit in Court-Christian since he was served with the said prohibition. He was bound over to take his trial on that issue, in the Quinzaine of Easter following. Meantime, Robert de Haleghton and Roger de Merston became Sure ties for his reappearance, and undertook that he should obtain abso lution for the Plaintiff.13 In November 1272, we have another or the same Walter de Conede employed in certain purchases of Bishop Burnell, at Belswardine. At the Assizes of 1292 the Jurors of Condover Hundred told how two men had fought on Cound Bridge, one with a sword, the other with a knife, and how both had been slain. HARNAGE. This Manor, though constituting one of the hides involved in Cound at Domesday, has subsequently a history of its own. When WiUiam fitz Alan (I) was restored to his Shropshire estates in 1155, he, being then at Brug, received the homage of his Vassals. This was on July 25, on which day he also granted Wroxeter Church to Haughmond Abbey. His Charter has only three wit nesses, and the last of the three is Hugh de Lacy of Colemere, that is, of Coolmere near Ellesmere. Now there is some probability that this Hugh de Lacy was identical with him who afterwards became Lord of Ludlow and Ewyas. If so, we account for his being called De Colemere in 1155 thus. \u2014 His Father Gilbert was living, but was up to this period under forfeiture like Fitz Alan. The son therefore may have been provided for by political friends or others, in a way which could not but be acceptable at the time, though his subsequent greatness Ul accords with such poor antecedents. With out however, prematurely settling this question of identity between Hu\u00b0-h de Lacy of Colemere, and Hugh, son of Gilbert de Lacy, I here shall only insist on the probability that Hugh de Lacy of Cole- 13 Placita apud Westminster, Mich.

Possibly he be came so in that very year, but in any case we may certainly fix upon Harnage as at least a part of the estate in respect of which he was Fitz Alan's Vassal. In 1167, when Hugh de Lacy of Ludlow had succeeded to the Honours of his House, we have a notice of Harnage. \u2014 Hugh de Lacy's Manor of Harnage (Herenegga Hugonis de Laci) had been amerced one merk in the Forest-Iter of Alan de Nevill : but Hugh himself had obtained the King's Writ, excusing the penalty, and he ivas quit. What we know of Hugh de Lacy of Ewyas makes it strongly probable that he was the person thus favoured by King Henry II. At this period, or a Uttle later, we hear first of one Almaric de Lacy. He was Lord of the neigh bouring Manor of Cressage, and held it certainly under Hugh de Lacy of Ewyas. I think Almaric was Hugh's brother. I think too that Hugh transferred to Almaric his tenancy of Harnage, though he did not and could not alienate the Seigneury of Cressage, which was his in a totally different way. In 1178, among persons liable to a payment to the Crown for wastes and assarts in Shropshire, Almaric de Lacy had been par doned 10s. 6d. by Writ Royal. I shaU defer many things which I have to say about Almaric de Lacy and his son Gilbert tUl I come to Cressage. Meanwhile the following notes are strictly appropriate to Harnage. On May 7, 1200, we have Warner de WUiley appearing in the Courts at Westminster as Attorney of WiUiam fitz Alan (II), who, it seems, was suing Gilbert de Laci in a plea of assize (as it is called) for 60 acres of land in Hamage. The Defendant appeared not, nor sent any essoign ; so the Court decided to proceed with the case, because of such default ; but the Recognizors were not all forthcoming, so the case was adjourned till the Justices in Eyre should visit Shropshire. The non-attendant Recognizors were William Pigot, William de Lia, Hugh Burnel, Philip de Linleg, and William de Bikedon. Their future appearance was ordered to be secured by attachment. The attendant Recognizors, as weU as those who had sent Essoignors, were also to appear.14 This adjournment to the next Eyre ofthe King's Justices was not final. On October 20, 1200, the cause came before the Courts of Westminster as a Suit of mort d'ancestre, the question being \" whether William, Father of William \" (that is of William fitz Alan II) \"died seized of 60 acres in Harnege now held by Gilbert de Lasci, and if so, whether WU liam Junior was his heir.\" The Jury decided in the affirmative ; 14 Rot.

The Charter is printed else where, whereby this same Gilbert de Lacy, caUing himself son of Aumeric de Lacy, granted \" the whole of Hernege to Buildwas Abbey, together with the land which Maurice sometime held, to wit, whatever he (Gilbert) had in that vill, whether in demesne or in service.\" The boundaries of the grant are given, viz. from the Sichet called Sciremoresiche, etc., to the road going to Keneley, including the whole Riflei (probably Riflet), etc., to the rivulet beyond the viU of Keneley, aud along the said rivulet down to the boundaries between Herenege and the land of WiUiam Burnel, etc., \u2014 along Kenildebroc down to the boundaries of Mortone and on wards to the boundaries between the field of Cristeseche (Cressage) and of Hernege, and to the ditch near the top of Wilardsmedwe, and thence along the ditch near the high grove of the Haye, through Raynald's assart and through Sciremore, including all Sciremore up to Sciremoresiche before mentioned. Gilbert further grants a right of common in the Manor of Cristeseche (both in the wood called Haye and elsewhere, wherever the free men and other tenants of Cristeseche had common) for 50 oxen and cows and for other animals, under view of his (Gilbert's) Servant. The Charter also secures wood for fencing and fire, and rights of road through Cres sage, to the Severn, so that the Abbot's men might avail themselves of that River, both for washing their sheep and for the purpose of water-carriage.16 The Charter implies that the Monks of Buildwas had barges (naves) on the Severn. It was attested by Sir Ymbert, Prior of Wenlock, Sir John fitz Alan, William Priest of Draytone, (i.e. William de Draytone, Priest), also by Richard de Lecton (Leighton), Richard de Middelhope, Roger Sprenghose, Robert Parson of Cristeshethe and John Tece.17. This Charter is the more valuable from our being able to date it with precision. It doubtless passed in 1232, for King Henry III, being at Wenlock on November 30th in that year, confirmed it.18 Next year, GUbert son of Almarick de Lacy was deceased, and Eva ls Transcript of Buildwas Charters in W.

Thus in \u2014 July 1233, Simon, Abbot of Buildwas, essoigns himself by Walter de Brident against Eva, widow of Gilbert de Lacy, in a plea of dower. Eva makes WUliam de Diche her attorney.

The Court grants it, and adjourns the case to one month of Easter.

The Fine actually levied is not extant. Pending this lawsuit, that is, between the years 1232 and 1236, Gilbert, son of Gilbert de Lacy, expedited a Charter whereby \" he binds himself to the Abbot and Convent of Buildwas under a penalty of \u00a340., to appear at whatever time or place they may deem necessary, before the King's Justices, and to answer Eva de BaUloil his mother concerning the land which she asserts to pertain to 19 In October 1233, I find mention of a Shropshire Suit wherein John fitz Adam (then on foreign service), and Richard fitz Gervase, Attorney of Eva de BaiUol, were concerned.

The reasons for the reduc tion in general were; \u2014 because the hay-tithes (worth \u00a31. 6s. 8d.), the tithes of Mills (worth 10s.), and the glebe-land, rents, and ob lations (worth \u00a37. 10s.), were included in the Church-Taxation, but were not computable in assessing the Ninth of wheat, wool, and lamb.29 A Patent of June 26, 1354, announces that the King (Ed ward III), notwithstanding the Statutes adverse to such a pro ceeding, has, for a Fine of 20s., to be paid by the Abbot and Convent of BuUdwas, given license to Richard Earl of Arundel that he may grant the Advowson of the Church of Conede (not holden of the King)30 to the Abbot, in exchange for the Manors of Kynnerton, Ruton, and Stirchesle31 (also not holden of the King), and that the Abbot may appropriate the said Church.33 It does not seem to me that either this exchange or appropriation ever took place.

He was however pardoned. Sir Thomas de Acton Reyners, Priest, was instituted to this Rectory, at presentation of Dame Matilda Burnel, on May 19, 1298. On Oct. 18, 1299, he has licensed for a year's non-residence in order that he may devote himself to the service of the said Lady.37? Master John de Stanton, Priest, had this Church commended to his care on March 30, 1312, in order that he might watch its interests during the spring seed-time (semestre tempus) ; but this title was exchanged for one of full institution on April 1 following, Dame MatUda Burnel presenting.37 Stanton resigned on Feb. 14, 1318, and on March 10 following \u2014 John de Cheyne was admitted at the presentation of Edmund Earl of Arundel.

As late as the year 1553 I find the Assignee of Henry Earl of Arundel (the last Fitz Alan), presenting to Cound.39 Umlep* This place is noticed in Domesday as follows : \u2014 The same Rainald (Sheriff) holds Chenelie, and Odo holds it of him. Edric held it (in Saxon times) and was a free man. Here is one hide geldable. In demesne there is i ox-team, and there might be iiii additional teams here. Here is a wood which wUl fatten 400 swine. In King Edward's time the Manor was worth 30s, (per annum), and afterwards it was waste. Now it is worth 4s.1 The Seigneural interest of Rainald at Kenley descended in the usual course, viz. to the Fitz Alans. So also the Tenancy of Odo de Bernieres went down regularly to the elder representatives of the House of Fitz Odo, as I have described their succession under Broadstone and Rushbury.2 From Fitz Odo it passed to De WUUey, with PetroniUa, sister and heir, or more probably coheir, of Herbert fitz Odo ; and with Burga, the heiress of De WUUey, it went to the Harleys. Kenley then formed a part of the Fief which in 1165 was held by Roger fitz Odo in the Barony of Fitz Alan. The whole of the said Fief was held by service of one Knight and three Muntators, equivalent to 2i knights'-fees.3 The proportion due from Kenley was, I think, half a fee. Now it is clear to me that in the reign of Henry II KeiUey was not being retained in the demesne of the elder House of Fitz Odo, but that a younger branch was subinfeuded therein. These Cadets 39 Blakeway's MSS. make Fitz Odo's Fief as 2| fees, viz.

The circumstances which warrant this conclusion I now proceed to give or to recapitulate. PhiUp fitz Odo, the presumed son and heir of Odo de Bcrnieres, was Uving in Stephen's reign, and, as I have intimated under Broad stone, was succeeded by Roger fitz Odo, probably his Son. It seems however that the latter (living in 1165) had a Brother, who coin cided with him and their Mother in a confirmation to Shrewsbury Abbey.4 When I find that, cotemporary with Roger fitz Odo, there was a person of much weight, named William fitz Odo, I cannot doubt that he was the Brother in question. WUliam fitz Odo seems to me to have had both Kenley and the whole of Gretton ; \u2014 of course as a Tenant of his elder brother, if such Roger was. This tenure would naturally associate WiUiam fitz Odo with the Fief of WUliam fitz Alan. Accordingly I find him attesting no less than five Charters of that Baron, all of which passed between 1155 and 1160, and one of them about Easter in the latter year. Of course WiUiam fitz Odo does not appear as a Tenant of Fitz Alan's Barony in ] 165, for the simple reason that Roger fitz Odo was the immediate Tenant, WUliam holding under him. Between 1169 and 1176 we have the name of WiUiam fitz Odo attesting a Charter of Peter Prior of Wenlock about Hugh ley,5 a circumstance which strongly favours our assumption of the witness's connection with Kenley. Within the same period I think it probable that William fitz Odo died, leaving at least three sons, viz. Thomas, Roger, and WiUiam, of each of whom I have something to say. WiUiam fitz Odo, though not the eldest, had an interest in Ken ley, for in 1180 he was fined 3s. by Justices of the Forest for waste there. He was long afterwards alleged to have held something in Tong (under Belmeis of course), and we know from the very facts of this case that he died without issue 6 of William fitz Odo his Uncle (avuncu lus), who (as he stated) had died seized thereof. Presently Thomas de Chabbe nour withdrew the Suit, so he and his Sureties (Peter Pak, Henry de Prene, and Robert de Wudeton) were in miseri cordia (Assizes, 6 Hen. Ill, m. 5, dorso). I have only to observe on this that the word avunculus must here be taken as equivalent to patruus, i.e. paternal Uncle . also that, if the hide of land sued for had 4 Vol. IV, p. 90, note 6. s Register at \"Willey, so. 7. 6 I have alluded to this case before (Vol. II, p! 217), but not being satisfied as to its relevancy to Tong, did not give the particulars. \u2014 At the Assizes of November, 1221, Thomas de Chabbenour sued Roger de la Zouche under Writ of mort d'ancestre for a hide of land, said to be in Twenge.

He occurs however independently in a matter which I shaU state under Acton Pigot, viz. as having been Guardian of three Coheiresses in part of that Manor. But I return to Thomas fitz Odo, otherwise called Thomas fitz William, Thomas de Chabbenore,7 and Thomas de Tasley, who was doubtless the eldest son of his Father, and whose interests were as various as his names. He was a Feoffee in Herefordshire, a Grantee of Henry II, a Tenant by Serjeantry, and the husband of a Shropshire Coheiress. One notice which I have of him, is about 1175, when he attests, as Thomas fitz Odo, a Charter of Henry II at Shrewsbury.8 It wiU be remembered that even prior to that he had, by grant of the same King, the custody of the lands of young Roger Corbet of Tasley.9 The Shropshire Pipe-Roll of 1177 gives us \" Richard the man of Thomas fitz Odo\" as amerced 1 merk by the King for Forest trespass. How Thomas fitz Odo's line acquired the name of Chabbenore, is no easy matter to determine. His wife Margery was niece and Coheir (through her Mother) of Helias de Higley, \u2014 a Shropshire Vassal of Mortimer of Wigmore.10 Who Margery's Father was, does not appear, but possibly his name was De Chabbenore. The Village and Manor of Chabnor (or Chadnor) in Herefordshire, lie about two miles eastward of Weobley, once the Caput of Lacy's Barony. Chabnor was however a member of the Barony of Todeni, and held for many generations by persons who took name from the place. That this family of Chabnores was identical with the Shropshire family I cannot prove or disprove. Here however is a piece of circumstantial evidence, showing that Thomas fitz Odo was concerned in that part of Herefordshire, and in the Fief of Todeni.\u2014 About seven miles south- westward of Weobley, and pretty near been stated to have been in Gretton rather than Tong, the whole matter woidd have been much more intelligible. That a Fitz-Odo should claim a tenure in Gret ton under La Zouche, is easily accounted for (compare Vol. IV, pp. 107, 108). not. He certainly was dead in 1213, and if in 1211, then it was his son only who was called Thomas de Chabbenore. If, again, he was living in 1211, he was doubtless called De Chabbenore in respect of property acquired with his wife. 1 There may be a doubt whether Tho mas fitz Odo himself was ever called De Chabbenore.

Leaving this digression, I return to Warner de Wililey and his wife Petronilla, whom I shall show in full possession of Kenley within ten years after the litigation of 1194, though it is probable that at this period they held the Manor under Petronilla's brother, Herbert de Rushbury. In Hilary Term 1203 a day (in one month of Easter) was given to Warner de Wilileg, Plaintiff, and to Hugh de Lega (i.e. Hugh ley) in a plea of pasture.16 A Fine levied at Westminster, on June 8 following, informs us what this plea was about, and how it was settled. The fine was between Warner de Wililee and Petronilla his wife (Plaintiffs) and Hugh de Lega (Tenant) of a common right in the Bosc of Kenelee. Warner and Petronilla now con cede to Hugh and his heirs 60 cart-loads of dead wood in the said bosc, to be taken annually, under view and delivery of War ner's Foresters. Also the said Hugh and his heirs should have 60 of their own swine in the said wood, free of pannage ; but if they had more, pannage they should pay. Hugh's men were also to pay pannage if they had swine in the bosc. Hugh, his heirs, and his men of Lega, were to have pasture of the herbage of the said bosc. For all this, Hugh and his heirs were to pay 2s. yearly, on St. Martin's Day, to Warner and Petronilla, and the heirs of Pe tronilla; also every house in Lega, belonging to Hugh, his heirs, or men, and from which a head of cattle went forth (into the bosc), was to pay two hens at Christmas. Hugh, moreover, and his men, were to mow, at their own cost and at a reasonable 15 Vide supra, Vol. I, p. 124, for a part of the evidence which leads to this identification. Some hints derived from Charters at Pitchford, confirm the idea. The Serjeantry of The Hay may therefore be looked upon as cognate with that of The More in the same district (Vide Vol. I, pp. 126-128) ; and both The Hay and The More may have been consti tuents of that Domesday Manor of Bole bee, whose extent we have actually ascer tained to have been double tbe subse quent extent of The More taken alone (Ibidem, p. 130). 18 Placita, Hil.

If Warner and Petronilla, or the heirs of Petronilla, should at any time wish to increase their wainage at Kenelee by assarting, they should do so in that part of the bosc next to Kenelee, without hindrance of Hugh or his heirs ; and if Warner and Petronilla should send corn to be ground at Hugh de Lega's mill, that corn should be ground next after such corn as might happen to be in the hopper (treumid) . At the Assizes of October 1203, the Jurors of Condover Hun dred had a presentment touching a matter of the King's Peace, in which Warner de Wililey was Appellant and Hugh de Esketot Appellee. Both parties now came into Court and put themselves in misericordid, Hugh's surety being Walter de Muuleton (pro bably Muneton), and Warner's, Maucoline de Harley. Hugh de Scotot or Esketot, thus occurring, was Lord of Bitterley, and his descendants, if not himself, had a share of Rushbury. I have before alluded to certain indications that these Lords of Bitterley were coparceners in the inheritance of Fitz Odo.17 I think it probable that Hugh de Scotot's wife was a Fitz Odo, and possible that she was a sister of Petronilla de Wililey. If so, the above quarrel was a family affair ; but the heirship or coheirship of the Ladies in question had not as yet arisen. A presentment of the Condover Jurors at these Assizes again brings William fitz Roger into notice. He and another had been accused of some breach of the King's peace and had been out lawed. When we find that the Appellant or Prosecutor in this case was Warner de Wililey, we identify William fitz Roger with the Litigant of 1194, and may well suppose that conflicting in terests were the cause of this prosecution. At these same Assizes the Condover Jurors presented Matilda de Kenley's appeal against Bran, a servant of Warner de Wililey, who, she said, had taken her oxen and horse in robbery. It proved how ever that the seizure had been made for some debt to the Crown, and that the Chattels had been returned to the Owner under plevin, before she made her charge of robbery. So she was in misericordid; and Gosceline de Kenley stood Surety for her amercement. At the Forest Assizes of 1209 the whole Vill of Kenelegh was amerced corporately for telling a lie (quia negavit quod prius dixit). Warin de Wilegh also was in misericordid for some affair of Forest law, apparently because some unlawful engine or instrument was \" Supra, Vol. IV, pp. 96, 368-9."], [537, "87 KENLEY. found in one of his fences. The passage is illegible or unintelli gible in any other way, but it appears that he was not personally suspected. His assessment for an imbladement within Regard of the Long Forest, was perhaps an incident of his tenure at Kenley rather than at Rushbury, where I have noticed it. I have related, under Gretton, the Suit which lasted from 1213 to 1218, touching Margery de Chabbenore's claim against Warner de Wililey for dower in Kenley. I have also explained its bearings on the genealogical history of the family of Fitz Odo.18 There was still one of that House living in 1221 and holding a small estate under Warner de Wililey at Kenley. This person is called William fitz Odo, and I think he must have been a son of that Roger fitz Odo or fitz William who was brother of Thomas and son of William fitz Odo (I) . If so, we recognize in William fitz Odo of 1221, that William fitz Roger who apparently succeeded his father in 1194, and who was outlawed in 1203, as already related. Be this as it may, William fitz Odo (III) was the person whose cruel wrongs I have briefly described under Willey.19 He, with Henry son of Roger le Hare, had been arrested because the carcase of a stolen cow had been found in an out-house of his. He now pleaded that the said carcase was placed there, out of animosity to him, by Warm de Wililey, his Lord, who coveted the freehold which the said William held under him. The Jury found that William fitz Odo of Kenley was an honest man (legalis homo) and no way blamable in the matter ; \u2014 that the carcase was placed in his out house maliciously and for his disinheritance, in respect of certain land which he held of Warin de Wililey ; \u2014 that Petronilla, Warm's wife, was the person who had sent for the King's Serjeant when the latter took the Prisoner into custody, that she not only told the said Serjeant when and where to find him, but where he might find the cow's carcase ; \u2014 to wit \" in the Grange of Leytton, far away from William's own residence (curia).\" Both of the accused were here upon acquitted ; Maurice de Alrigg, a Serjeant, who, presuming the Prisoner William's felony, had seized and sold his working cattle, was first ordered to prison, but afterwards committed to the custody of his Sureties, viz. William de Bassecherch, William Burnel, and * # * * (je Eton. Warin de Wililey's punishment I have already detailed.19 At the Assizes of Angust 1226, Warin de Wylileg was sued in vain for disseizing Robert de Lubecote of a tenement in Kenley. The 18 Supra, Vol. IV, p. 106. \" Supra, Vol. II, pp. 54, 55."], [538, "88 KENLEY. Plaintiff proved to be a Tenant in Villainage. Within the next five years Warner de Wililey was deceased, having settled Kenley and his wife's other estates in the manner which I have related under Willey.20 The Forest Survey of 1235 includes a report on the Bosc of Kenleg, it being, as I suppose, within Regard of the Long Forest, though its soil was the property of the Lord of the Fee. The Surveyors found it \" well kept of late, as regarded oak-trees and underwood, but of old much oak timber had been fallen, to wit, in the time of war and of liberty given.\" In 1240 we find Kenley in the hands of Warner de Wililey's widow, now called Petronilla de Kenley. The collective evidence of three nearly cotemporary Rolls is, that she was holding Kenley, with its appurtenr.nce of Bromcroft, and Acton Pigot, with its appurtenance of AJlcot, all by service of one Knight's-fee in Fitz Alan's Barony.21 Petronilla fitz Odo, as I have shown under Willey, was succeeded by her son Nicholas de Wililey, who died before 1255, leaving a widow, Burga (de Pich ford), and an Infant son, Andrew. Hence the Hundred- Roll of 1255 reports, though with some inaccuracy, that \" Dame Burga de Wilileg holds Kenleg in custody, for one hide of land, and in right of the guardianship of Ranulph, son of Nicholas de Wilileg.\" The Manor was of the \" Fee of Sir John fitz Alan.\" It paid 8d. per annum for stretward and motfee, and did suit to Condover Hun dred.22 The mistake in this entry is calling the son of Nicholas de Wililey, Ralph. The same mistake has been noticed under Gretton, as having been made in another Hundred.23 The origin of this error will be more apparent under Golding, where we shall see that there was a Ralph fitz Nicholas, indirectly concerned in the Fee of Fitz Odo at this very period. The Assize Roll of 1256 presents us with a very puzzling entry. \" Henry fitz Roger, as son and heir of Roger le Hore, had a suit of mort d'ancestre for four acres in Kenleth, whereof Robert Aleyn held one acre, and William Trenger, of Bromcroft, and others, held the residue. All the Tenants called Robert Aleyn to warranty. He in turn called Thomas fitz William to warranty ; but the latter being a Minor in the Queen's custody, the cause was necessarily ad journed.34 Here we have doubtless a second appearance of Henry son of Roger le Hare, \u2014 accused and acquitted of felony in 1221. 20 Supra, Vol. II, pp. 55, 56. 21 Testa de Nevill, pp. 44, 48, 49. 23 Supra, Vol. IV, p. 107. 24 Assizes, 10 Hen. Ill, mm. 3 dorso, Rot. Hundred. II, 62. 1 recto."], [539, "89 KENLEY. But surely the Minor, Thomas fitz William, cannot be a mistake for Andrew fitz Nicholas de Wililey. I rather suppose the name to be given correctly, and that in Thomas fitz William we have the Infant son of that William fitz Odo, who has also appeared in 1221, under the same circumstances, with Henry le Hare. But how the pre sumed representative of a younger branch of the House of Fitz Odo should have fallen into the Queen's custody I cannot surmise. Evidently such a Guardianship resulted from some other Tenure than this mesne interest in a few acres at Kenley. Probably Henry le Hare was identical with Henry de Ken ley, who brought a suit of mort d'ancestre at these same Assizes against Juliana de Kenleg. 2* The Lady, whom we have heard of before as daughter of Warner de Wililey,25 appoints Hugh de Wlon keslawe (Longslow) her Attorney, but the result does not appear. A reference to my account of Willey will show that in the year 1272 the forfeited estates of Andrew de Wililey were in she hands of Robert le Strange, then absent on the Crusade, while Burga, the daughter and heir of the said Andrew, was probably in minority and as yet unmarried. This will explain part of an entry on the Assize Roll of September 1272 : \"Petronilla, the Recluse (Inclusa) of the Church of St. Mary of Shrewsbury, asks license to recede from a Suit which she had against Robert le Estrange, Walter de Pedwardin, and Burga daughter of Andrew de Wylileg, for disseizing her of a free tenement in Kenleye, viz. a rent of 20*. and 13 quarters of Corn.\"26 I may here observe that the South Porch of St. Mary's Church at Shrewsbury is furnished with one of those curious upper stories or chambers, known among Ecclesio logists as Parvises. There are perhaps the remains of another such chamber in the North Transept of the same Church. These Chambers were anciently tenanted by a single inmate, usually a female, self devoted to perpetual seclusion. The offices of the Church were audible in these Cells. The Recluse or Anchoret, once immured, never left her abode while living. Her wants are usually supposed to have been supplied by contributions of the Parishioners. In the case before us it is clear that one at least of the Parvises of St. Mary's had or was assumed to have a regular endowment,\u2014 a rent-charge probably granted by some Lord 24 Assizes, 40 Hen.

We have already had an instance where the Devotee was a Lady of the knightly family of Spren cheaux.27 Walter de Pedwardyne, it would appear, was the person among the above Defendants who had the temporary and actual custody of Kenley. Probably he had received it from Robert le Strange by grant or purchase. At these same Assizes \" Walter de Pedewardyn\" came into Court and \" acknowledged that he owed to Petronilla, the Anchoret (Anacorit\u0153) of St. Mary's, a sum of \u00a34., payable during four years. Also the said Walter conceded that if he should happen to hold the lands, late Andrew de Wililey's, to wit the Manor of Kenleye, for more than four years, he would pay 20*. per annum to the Anchoret for each such additional year.\"28 The further descent of the Fee of Kenley is implied in my account of Willey, and it will be continued yet later under Harley. When it is said that the Manor of Kenley, like that of Cound, was given in frank-marriage with Matilda fitz Alan to Philip Burnel, the Seigneury only must be understood. Thus, on the death of Philip Burnel in 1294, it was found that Richard de Harleye had held the Manor of Kenleye by half a knight's-fee under the deceased, and its gross value was estimated at \u00a310. per annum.29 In other words, the knights' -service due on Kenley was, with all its feudal con comitants, due to Philip Burnel, but the alleged revenue was Richard.de Harley's. The Nomina Villarum, a return of 1316, rightly gives Robert de Harlegh as Lord of Kenlegh.30 By Deed, dated in 11 Edw. Ill (1337-8), Burga, Lady of Wyllelegh and of Kenlegh, grants to Reginald, Lord of Legh (Hughley), two assarts and a parcel of land in Kenlegh, as they were assarted in the time of Sir Richard de Harlegh, formerly her husband.31 So then (if this Deed be rightly dated) it appears that the great heiress of Fitz Odo and De Wililey had not, even in extreme old-age, resigned her whole interest in Kenley to her son Robert. As to Undertenants in Kenley, the names of so many have been incorporated in the above account, that little remains to be said under this head. On October 29, 1227, we have a Fine, whereby Robert fitz Reginald, claimant, under Writ of mort d'an cestre, of half a carucate in Keneleg, allows the same to be the right of Agnes, wife of William Cocus. William Cocus and the 27 Supra, p. 58. 30 Parliamentary Writs, IV, 398. 31 Lacon Evidences (See Vol. II, p. 53, 28 Assizes, 56 Hen. Ill, m. 14. 29 Inquisitions, 22 Edw. I, No. 45, d.

They also gave him one merk. In 1262 William, son of Susanna de Kenley, was assessed for an imbladement within Regard of the Long Forest. In 1267 Lovekine de Longenolre and Thomas le Petit of Kenley were amerced 6s. 8d. for making charcoal.32 Their Sureties were Thomas de la Mare and William Champeneys (both Officials connected with the Forest). Bromcroft. \u2014 At the Assizes of 1203 the Pleas of the Crown in Condover Hundred show that Gerard de Bromcroft had been out lawed for the murder of Richard de Kenel' at the suit of Adam and Roger, brothers of the deceased. Richard de Ambersleg, Sheriff, answered for 20s., the value of the Outlaw's Chattels, but sentence was to be passed on three Coroners who had endeavoured to embezzle 5s. of this sum. They were William de Middelhope, Walter Haket, and William Picot. A Suit commenced at these Assizes and ended at Westminster in Easter Term 1205, wherein Warner de Wililey and Petronilla, his wife, were Defendants, the Attorney of Petronilla being variously called Bernard de Posenhal and Bernard de Boslei (i. e. Broseley). The suit was for a virgate and quarter in Bromcroft, claimed, as her right and inheritance, by Felicia de Wadeleg, or Wedeleg, daughter of Reginald de Wadeleg, alias Reginald Marshall. The Plaintiff was nonsuited after making repeated defaults. Warner de Wililey's defence refers to a matter already noticed. He said, appa rently (for the Record is defaced), that he had had a Plea con cerning this and other land on a former occasion in the Curia Regis, that the then Plaintiffs were Thomas and Roger fitz Odo, and that Felicia, the present Plaintiff, never opposed any claim. A note alludes to the Fine levied at Westminster in 5 Ric. I (1193-4). Other persons named in this Suit are John Bocointe, apparently a Civilian, and of whom we hear in other causes ; \u2014 also, Ralph fitz Robert, an Essoignor of Warner de Wililey on one occasion, when he was stated to be ill at Kenley ; \u2014 also, Roger Sprenghose, Philip de Stapleton, William Burnel, and William de Middlehope, four Visors appointed to see the Essoignee and certify his state of health.

There he had appeared, but no one had any charge to bring against him.33 Thomas fitz Adam of Bromcroft occurs again in 1278, and also William fitz Arnald of Presthope, both as Tenants in Kenley Manor, and both as holding forest-land in Gipholes. The particulars have been given under Presthope.3* Kenley Church. \u2014 This was originally a Chapel, that is, an affiliation of some ancient parochial Church in the neighbourhood. I am unable positively to assign the mother Church, but should fix on Cound rather than Harley or Acton Burnell, which were them selves probable Chapels in the first instance.

Wil liam fitz Pagan was perhaps successor of Rainald fitz Pagan whom we have seen attesting a Charter of Roger fitz Odo to Shrewsbury Abbey.3 William at his decease left a sister (in her issue his sole heir) , and a widow, Mabel, who remarried. Her second husband, William Picot or Fitz Picot, had half this Manor with his wife in dower, and, though his estate was only for life, it was he who left to the place that distinctive name by which it is known to this day. Some time towards the close of the twelfth century the Chapel of Acton Pigot was vacant, and from the list of persons who concurred in presenting one Silvester thereto we learn the partition of the estate. William Picot was one of the Patrons in the right of his wife. The Sister of William fitz Pagan was dead, so were the three daughters and Coheirs who had represented her, so were the husbands of two of the said daughters. Roger de Harpcote, the surviving husband of one (probably the eldest) of the three daughters, concurred in presenting Silvester, in right of Roger de Harpcote his son, who was heir to his Mother. William de Bels wardine, son and heir of another of the said three coheiresses, also concurred. But the third Coheiress, whose husband is not named, had at her death left three daughters and coheiresses, Matilda, Mabel, and Sibil. The fourth joint patron of Kenley Chapel was Roger fitz Odo, then guardian of these three Infants. Some years will have elapsed after this presentation when the Records begin to afford other notices of William Picot. On May 7, 1200, we have him as Recognizor in the Suit already mentioned under Harnage. In the same year he and one William fitz Walter appear as charged 4s. by Justices of the Forest for some matter within their jurisdiction.4 At the Assizes of October 1203, William Picot was amerced one merk for trespass (pro transgressione) . This may have been that act of dishonesty which we have noticed under Bromcroft as detected in him and his Fellow-Coroners. But at these same Assizes the Advowson of Acton Chapel was in dispute among the Coparceners. William Picot at first essoigned himself, one Benedict Chat being his Essoignor. Nevertheless the cause was heard and decided. It appeared that Silvester, the last Incumbent, was dead, and the question, as usual in such causes, was, who had presented him. The verdict of the Jury I have 3 Supra, Vol. IV, p. 90, note 8. 4 Wills fit. Picot et Wills fit.

Roger de Harp cote, Junior, was no longer represented by his Father, but was acting for himself. It was in fact he who claimed the Advowson against all the others. William Picot, Mabel his wife, and Wil liam de Belswardine, still held their former position, but the three daughters of the third Coheiress were all married, viz. Matilda to Philip de Allescot, Mabel to Richard de Moneford, and Sibil to Robert de Allecot. There were therefore ten persons who severally, or in pairs, claimed the right of presentation in 1203, and the Court dealt with and allowed this mixed right, just as if an estate of lands had had to be divided.5 I must now trace these various interests in Acton Pigot, as far as a few notes can illustrate so complex a subject. \u2014 William fitz Pichot is found attesting a Pitchford Deed which I supposed to have passed from four to eight years later than the above Suit. This is the last I hear of him, and it is obvious that after the decease of him and his wife, their share of Acton Pigot will have been distributable among the Coparceners by inheritance. Roger de Harpcote (II) seems to have been succeeded by Walter de Harpcote. The latter has already occurred to us in 1226 as a Surety for Hugh de Beckbury,6 whom I shall hereafter show to have had an interest in Golding. Walter cle Harpcote was succeeded by his son Ranulph, who was a Coparcener in Acton Pigot in 1255, and who in 1256 was, as we have seen, concerned in the distant Manor of Diddlebury.7 At the Assizes of 1272 Randulph de Harpcote is entered as a Juror for Condover Hundred. This is all that I need to say here of a family which I shall have to notice elsewhere. William de Belswardine was, as his name suggests, interested in the neighbouring Manor of Belswardine. He is assessed on the Forest- Roll of 1209 for an imbladement within Regard oi the Forest of Mount Gilbert, which I do not think relevant to his concern in the neighourhood before us. As at Belswardine, so at Acton Pigot, he was followed by one William de Bascherch, his relations with whom I cannot further determine than by saying that they were at issue in 1204 about land at Belswardine. When I come to that Manor I shall show this William de Bascherch to have been living in 1221. In 1255 his Representatives at Acton Pigot seem 5 Assizes, 5 John, m. 5. I < Vol. V, pp. 180, 181. 6 Supra, Vol. II, p. 126."], [545, "95 ACTON PIGOT. to have been Richard de Bascherch and Roger de Bascherch ; \u2014 one or both of them. Richard de Bascherch also occurs in 1249 on two local Juries concerning estates at Pulley and Langley. In 1256 we have Richard, son of Richard de Bascherch, concerned in this neighbourhood. Again Richard and Roger de Bascherch appear on an Inquest at Langley in April 1264. Philip and Matilda de Allscott, whose name was derived from a vill once appurtenant to Acton Pigot, had a Representative in 1255; \u2014 probably Philip de Allecott, then a Coparcener in the Manor. The Representative, at the same period, of \u2014 Robert and Sibil de Allcott, was probably Gilian deAllcot. Mabel, the sister of Sibil and Matilda, seems to have left no per manent representative. The Hundred- Roll of 1255 combines these scattered facts as fol lows. \u2014 \" Ranulf de Arpecott, Richard de Bascherch, Philip de Alle cot, and Giliana de Allecot, and Roger de Bascherch hold Acton Pigot for in hides, of the Fee of Kenleg. It pays 2s. for strehvard and motfee, and does suit to Condover Hundred.\"8 The full mean ing of \" holding of the Fee of Kenleg\" is, that the above Coparce ners held under Andrew de Wililey, now in custody of his Mother, Burga, the said Andrew holding of John fitz Alan. In Easter Term 1283 a Fine was levied whereby Richard de Bouthlers and Matilda his wife (Deforciants) acknowledge them selves to have given to Robert Burnell, Bishop of Bath and Wells, a messuage and half-virgate in AUecote ; to hold of the Grantors and the heirs of Matilda at a clove-rent. For this, which seems to have been a purchase, the Bishop paid 20 merks. A Fine was levied on July 8, 1292, between Robert and Philip Burnel, Plaintiffs, and Richard de Harley and Bulgia (Burga) his wife, Impedients, of 6s. 8d. rent in Acton Pycot and Allyeote. The Impedients acknowledged that the rent, and whatever they had in Acton Pycot and Allyeote, belonged to the Plaintiffs. In return the latter conceded to Harley and his wife 11s. rent in Wilderhope, together with the homage of Richard, son of Robert de Wilder hope.9 The Inquest taken in December 1292, as to the estates of Bishop Robert Burnell, then deceased, names Acton Pigot in a sequence which would lead one to consider it as a member of Acton Burnel.

The Advowson of the Chapel of Acton Pigot was also Philip Burnel's, but its value was nothing beyond services,11 that is, I presume, beyond the sum necessary to provide for the performance of divine services. Acton Pigot was among those estates of Philip Burnel which were dealt with in the mode described under Abdon,12 that is, seized in satisfaction of his debts to certain Merchants of Lucca. ACTON PIGOT CHAPEL. This structure, long disused, still exists as a Ruin. It has usually been looked upon as a dependency of the Church of Acton Burnell, which at the present day is the Parish Church of the two districts. It may, however, be doubted whether Acton Burnell itself was originally more than a Chapel. If conjecture be, in such a case, allowable, I should suggest that Cound was probably the Mother- Church of Acton Burnell, as it was unquestionably of Acton Pigot. I have given the early history of Acton Pigot Chapel (as far as it can be ascertained) with that of the Manor. Its date is thus cer tified as at least as early as Henry II's reign. The Taxation of 1291 does not mention this Chapel, except that we must understand it as being one of the Chapels of Cound, valued in gross with the Mother Church. In 1341 the Assessors of the Ninth rated the Parish of Acton Pygot only at one merk. A third of the corn-tithes of the Chapel belonged to the \" Mother- Church of Conede,\" and the small-tithes, worth one merk per annum, were not to be reckoned of, in settling the current tax.13 I subjoin the names of one or two \u2014 EARLY INCUMBENTS.

Newman resigned in 1409.10 I cannot leave this subject without quoting a few memoranda from the Diary of the late Very Rev. John Chappel \"Woodhouse, Dean of Lichfield and Archdeacon of Salop, who was visiting the Churches of this District in September 1799. Speaking of the Chapel of Acton Pigot, the Dean remarks that \" no duty had been done there for 70 years ;\" that \" there was only one inhabitant in the District on whom the repairs would fall ;\" and that the Chapel being \" within less than a mile from the mother Church\" (Acton Burnell is meant), \"and being therefore of little use, had been suf fered to go to ruin.\" Archbishop Cornwallis had, it seems, when Bishop of Lichfield (1749-68), been asked by the then Rector of Acton Burnell, whether this Chapel should be taken down, but had ordered it \" to be permitted to sink of itself.\" In 1799, Dean Wood house, at the earnest request of the same Rector, ordered the door and windows to be bricked up, that the place \" might not be profaned.\" Who can be blind to, and who will censure the feeling of these Churchmen ofthe last century ? They surely held it grievous that a place once consecrated to God's \"Wor ship should come to profanation. Yet, hand-tied and tongue-tied, they did and said little or nothing. Are we to criticize their conduct as a weak compromise, or re spect it as the result of a forced and involuntary resignation ? If the latter, then their example may be of use in an age when Churchmen are ready to rush into polemical utterance and action about principles far less venerable than that of the abiding sanctity of Churches. dMtiincj* This Manor, now a mere member of Pitchford, belonged to a different Fief at Domesday. \"The same Rainald (the Sheriff) held \" Register Langton, so. 68. 15 Register Northburgh, so. 224. vi. 16 Blakeway's MSS. *3"], [550, "98 GOLD ING.

In demesne was one ox-team and in Serfs and i Boor, and there was capability for a second team. The Manor was then worth 5*. (per annum) having been previously worth 8s.\"1 As at Kenley and Acton Pigot, the Seigneury of Golding de scended from Rainald Vicecomes to Fitz Alan ; and the tenure of Odo de Bernieres to Roger fitz Odo (living in 1165), to Herbert de Rushbury (living in the time of Richard I), and to Petro nilla his Sister the wife of Warner de Wililey. The sub-feoff ments of the estate, small as it was, were rather complicated. The Pitchfords of the twelfth century must have held a part of the Manor under Fitz Odo. Also we find that Engelard de Stret ton, a Cadet of the family of Pitchford, had an interest in Golding. This was apparently acquired through his wife Ermeburga, but who she was I know not. Towards the close of the twelfth cen tury \" Ermeburga, formerly wife of Engelard de Stretton, gave to Haughmond Abbey half a virgate in Goldene, which was part of her estate in frank marriage. She gave it together with William fitz Ralph the Tenant, his house, and his children. Witnesses, \u2014 William son of William fitz Alan, John le Strange, Hamo his brother, Hugh Pantulf, and Stephen de Staunton.\"2 I further gather, from a Wombridge Charter (inaccurately transcribed) that Felicia daughter of Engelard de Stretun gave to that Priory an other half-virgate in Goldene.3 These incidents must not distract our attention from a more prominent fact, viz. that Herbert de Rushbury at the close of the twelfth or beginning of the thirteenth century retained an estate at Golding, held under Fitz Alan by service of one sixth part of a Knight's-fee. In this estate Herbert de Rushbury enfeoffed that Hugh de Beckbury (the first of his name) whom I have spoken of under Harrington and Beckbury. I shall presently quote evidences to show that this feoffment by Herbert de Rushbury had the distinct and the cotemporary sanction of William fitz Alan (II), as Seig neural Lord of Golding. Hugh de Beckbury, having thus acquired a footing in Golding, seems to have set himself to buy up other interests. He had certain assarts at Sundorn which he gave to Haughmond Abbey, receiving in exchange that half-virgate which 1 Domesday, so. 254, b, 1. 2 Haughmond Chartulary : Tit.

Of this transaction, John le Strange and Reiner de Lee were witnesses.4 With the Canons of Wombridge, Hugh de Beckbury had a similar arrangement. He obtained their half-virgate in Goldene, by giving them an equal quantity of land at Uppington, which was part of the estate brought to him by his wife Alina, daughter and coheiress of Roger Mussun. This exchange with Wombridge was attested by Bald win de Hodnet, Hugh fitz Robert, and William de Hedelee. Probably the year 1220 will be the proximate date for both these transactions. About this time Hugh de Beckbury was impleaded by Warner de Wililey and his wife Petronilla for his estate here. A Fine levied at Shrewsbury on November 12, 1221, contains genealogical evidence of the highest value. It was between the said \" Warner and Petronilla (Plaintiffs) and Hugh de Bechebury (Tenant) of one sixth of a Knight's-fee in Golden, to wit of the whole land which had belonged to Herbert de Rushbury in the said vill, whereof was suit-at-law between the parties. Now Warner and Petronilla ac knowledge the premises to be the right of Hugh as those which the said Hugh has by gift of the aforesaid Herbert, brother of Petronilla, whose heir she affirms herself to be. Hugh and his heirs are to hold the premises under Warner and Petronilla and the heirs of Petronilla, paying a rent of 1 lb. of pepper at Christ mas, in lieu of all other services to them. Moreover Hugh was to sa tisfy the Chief- Lords of the Fee (the Fitz Alans of course) for all services due on the said land. For this recognition of Herbert de Rushbury's feoffment, Hugh de Bechebury paid the Plaintiffs two merks of silver.\" The Fine is indorsed with a memorandum that \" Roger de Buterleg opposes his claim,\" which squares with my surmises, already expressed,5 that Roger de Scottot or De Bitterley, being son of Hugh de Scotot, was son also of a sister of Petronilla de Wililey, and so of a sister and coheiress of Herbert de Rush bury. At this period (1221) Hugh de Beckbury had his own Under- Tenants at Golding, for at the Assizes of that year I find that John de Golden, tenant of half a virgate in Golden, being dead, his widow Richolda sues Hugh de Becheberwe for her dower or thirds thereof. The result was a Fine levied between Richolda and her second husband, Seisoc fitz Alured, on the one part, and Hugh de 4 Haughmond Chartulary : Tit. Son- I 5 Supra, Vol. IV, pp. 368-9. dron."], [552, "100 GOLDING. Bechebur' on the other. The Plaintiffs relinquished their claim, Hugh paying them one merk. A Fine of November 18, 1236, shows that John de Beckbury, son and heir of Hugh, had in turn to defend or to fortify his feoff ment in Golden. In this instance the estate is described as a carucate of land in Caldone (that is, Golding) and in Newbold (a member I think of Golding, now lost). John de Beckebir is Plain tiff and John fitz Alan Impedient, and the Fine purports to be the issue of a suit of charter-warranty . John fitz Alan now acknow ledges the right of the Plaintiff as arising by gift of William fitz Alan, father of the Recognizor (to Hugh de Beckbury, father of the Plaintiff). John de Beckbury and his heirs are to hold the premises under John fitz Alan and his heirs, paying therefore 1 lb. of cumin at Michaelmas, in lieu of all services ; and moreover pay ing to Petronilla de Kenleg (now widow of Warner de Wililey) and her heirs, 1 lb. of pepper at Christmas. For this recognition John de Beckbury is said to give a sore sparrow-hawk, and it is specially noted that the Fine was levied in the presence and by concession of Petronilla de Kenleg. I have noticed under Beckbury those Feodaries of Fitz-Alan's Barony which would seem to imply that about the year 1240 Johu de Beckbury was holding one-eighth of a fee under Fitz Alan in Beckbury.6 Doubtless, I think, the tenure in which this state ment originated, was his tenure in Golding. In May 1249 I find William de Golden (probably John de Beckbury's tenant here) sitting as Juror on a neighbouring Inquest. The status of Golding is very imperfectly recorded in the Hun dred-Roll of 1255. The Manor was reputed to be half a hide (its Domesday measurement) ; it paid the proportionate sum of 4d. for stretward and motfee, but did suit neither to County or Hundred. Fitz-Alan's Seigneury here is totally ignored, so is the mesne tenure of young Andrew de Wililey, except that the Manor is stated to be held of the Fee of Rushbury.1 The only truth con tained in this expression is that the Mesne-Lord of Golding hap pened to be also Mesne-Lord of a part of Rushbury, but we must remember that Rushbury was a fee of Lacy's, not of Fitz-Alan's, Barony. As to the Undertenants of Golding, the Hundred-Roll mentions two, viz. the heir of Ralph de Pichford and William de Golden. Here again a mesne-tenure is ignored, viz. that of Philip 6 Supra, Vol. IV, p. 137. | < Rot. Hundred. II, 62."], [553, "101 GOLDING. de Beckbury, who certainly held over William de Golden. John de Pichford, the Minor above alluded to, can have had but a trifling interest in Golding. Whatever he had, it was now (1255) in cus tody of Master Walter de Peshal and Ralph fitz Nicholas, to whom the King had given the wardship of this heir, he being, as I have elsewhere explained, a Tenant-in-capite at Albrighton, and Little- Brug. The Assize- Roll of January 1256 confirms what I have said of Philip de Beckbury's continued interest here, by showing him to be seized of 20*. rent and one pectoralis of land in Neubolde, and of 16s. rent in Caldeton (Golden). For thirds of these heredita ments, as well as for a third of 10s. rent in Beckbury, he was now impleaded by his step-mother, viz. by Alice, widow of his father John de Beckbury, and now wife of Thomas de Beckbury. Philip's defence was that the marriage between his Father and .Alice was unlawful. At first Thomas and Alice fined one merk to have an Inquest hereou, but afterwards Philip gave another merk pro li centid concordandi? By the Fine thus initiated, Thomas and Alice remit their claims to thirds of 6s. rent in Golden, 10s. rent in Bechebir', and 20s. rent and one pectoralis in Neubold. For this, Phihp conceded a meadow in Bechebur' called Holdemor, with 6s. 8d. rent, to be received by Alice for life, from two-thirds of Philip's Mill at Bechebur', also one-third ofthe profits of common pasture in the wood of Bechebur', and one of every two oak-trees there fallen, and certain liberties to depasture sheep therein. In 1294 Ralph de Picheford, Lord of Albricton, grants to Walter son of Reginald de Goldene, that half-virgate in Goldene which Reginald his said father had held for life, also a nocate and garden held by the said Reginald. The Tenant is to pay a rent of Is. to Margaret, the Grantor's Mother, for her life. The Deed reserves suit of Court every three weeks, and a heriot, viz. the Tenant's best Ox.

Now it is worth 20s.\"1 I have intimated under Easthope that Fulcher, Rainald's Tenant in that Manor as well as this, was not succeeded by heirs of his blood.2 Eaton certainly reverted to Fitz Alan as Seigneural Lord, and was granted between the years 1135 and 1160, by the first William fitz Alan, to one Marescot, who accordingly appears in the Feodary of 1165 as holding half a fee of new feoffment in the Barony of Fitz Alan.3 During the war of succession waged by the Empress Maud against Stephen, the Partisans of the former will have been in constant communication with her Uncle and Cousin, the King and Prince of Scotland. William fitz Alan's own brother, Walter, became Seneschal of Scotland at this period, a country from which there is much probability that their Ancestors had sprung. I take Marescot then to have been what his name suggests, a Scot by birth, and to have become associated with the House of Fitz Alan during the civil war. Besides his estate at Eaton, Marscot had some feoffment at Downton, near Upton Magna. This he seems to have surrendered in favour of Haughmond Abbey. A Charter of the first William fitz Alan, ratifying the transfer, must have passed 10 Inquisitions, 9 Edw. II, No. 67. 1 Domesday, so. 251, b, 1. 2 Supra, Vol. IV, p. 117. 3 Liber Niger, I, 144."], [555, "103 EATON MASCOTT. between the years 1155 and 1158. It is attested by Marescote himself and by Adam his Esquire (Adam armigero ejus), which satisfies me of the knightly rank of the former witness. Before the year 1172, Marescot made a more independent grant to Haugh mond Abbey, viz. two-thirds of all tithes of his demesne of Eatune. This was attested by Henry, the Grantor's son ; by Adam de Arun dell; Wido le Strange; Robert de la Mare; Robert fitz Herbert; and by one whose name is written as Robert fitz Chaleuric, but of whose identity I must speak elsewhere. This grant of Marscot's is recorded in a Bull which Pope Alexander III issued to Haughmond Abbey in May, 1172. The second William fitz Alan came of age about the year 1175. Several of his Charters have the attestation of Marscot ; but two which he expedited to Buildwas Abbey, probably about 1175-6, are attested not only by Marscote, but by his two sons Henry and Hamo. Again, a Charter of the first John le Strange, which must be of date about 1177-8, is attested by Marescote and Henry his son. Parallel in time with these Charter evidences we have some notes of Marscot's political career. The Shropshire Pipe-Roll of 1177 tells us how he had been amerced by the King himself for trespass of the Forest. One hundred merks and two horses was an enormous fine for a man of mere knightly degree. Marscot had however paid 35 merks, and had delivered two horses to the King himself. The King had excused him 50 merks. The balance (15 merks) he paid in the year following. In 1180 Marescot's name is the first of twelve, apparently constituting a Jury, which had pronounced a false judgment against Fulk fitz Warin.* His amercement on this occasion was 1 0 merles, five of which he paid on the instant, and the balance in subsequent years. From his attes tation of Charters, I think it probable that Marscot was still living about the middle of Richard I's reign, viz. about 1194. It would seem that Henry, evidently his eldest son, died in Marscot's life time, or else survived him but a short time, and was succeeded by his next Brother, Hamo. The Assize-Roll of 1203 exhibits Hamo Marscot as a Knight, and as a Juror in the greater class of causes. He himself fines 5 merks that he may have some Inquisition, his Sureties being Walter de Muneton, Walter Haket, William de Lotwich, Philip de Stapelton, and Hugh le Strange. Again, a son of his, whose name is not expressed, is mentioned as a Surety or a 4 Marescot, r. c. de X marcis quia intei-fuit falso judicio facto Fulkoni filio Warini."], [556, "104 EATON MASCOTT. Witness in a case of Wager of Battle which I shall relate under Shawbury. In 1207 I find Hamo Marcot and his fellows (Jurors I suppose) amerced one merk for a foolish verdict (pro stuito dicto) . At the Forest Assizes of 1209 Hamo fitz Marescot, Hugh le Strange (of Berrington, I presume), and the men of William fitz Alan were questioned for taking hares in the Warren of Bulregg. At the Assizes of 1221, and on an important Inquest about the Forest of Stiperstones in 1226, Hamo Marscot appears as a Juror. The Feodary of 1240 introduces William Marescott in this succession, viz. as holding half a knight's-fee in Eton, of the Barony of Fitz Alan.5 The same person was Juror on a Pulley Inquest in 1249, and the Hundred-Roll of 1255 tells us that (the same or a second) William Marscot, himself a Juror for Condover Hundred, holds Eton Marscot of Sir John fitz Alan, for three hides. He paid 2s. annually for stretward and motfee, and did suit to the Hundred.6 At the Assizes of 1256, Margery wife of William de Lyfford, Richard Marscot, William de Bromton with Margery his wife, and Edneweyn with Isota his wife, name their Attorney in a suit of lands against Saer Mauveysin. I think it was only some under- tenancies in this Manor that were thus disputed, for previous to this time William Marscot (Lord of the Manor) had evidently been succeeded by a son William, which last William was impleaded by Saer Mauveysin at these same Assizes, and apparently for the whole Manor. William son of William Marscot, called his Suzerain, viz. John son of John fitz Alan, to warranty. The result was a Fine, wherein the said John fitz Alan appears as paying Saer Mauveysin twenty merks, in return for a Quit-claim of 14 mes- suages, 1 mill, 1 carucate, 6| virgates, and 11 acres of (arable) land, and 2\\ acres of meadow in Eton Marscot. William Marscot was a Juror for Condover Hundred at these Assizes. He occurs also on a local Inquest in April 1264. At the Assizes of 1272 he was one of the Electors of the Jury for this Hundred, but was pro- nounced to be in misericordid for some previous non-attendance. Again he occurs on a local Jury in December 1273, and at the Inquest of November 1274 his name stands first on the panel for Condover Hundred. I think that soon after this, the elder male line of Marscot must have failed. Probably it vanished in two female coheirs, but my evidence on the subject is very scanty. Among the Jurors who in October, 1283, made an extent of Con dover Manor, we notice the names of Thomas Marscot and AVilliam ' Testa de Nevill, p. 44. | 6 Rot. Hundred. II, 62 ."], [557, "105 EATON MASCOTT. de Preston.7 I do not know that the former, if his name was really Marscot, can have been anything more than a Cadet of his House. The latter was more certainly a Coparcener in the Manor of Eaton Mascott. The other Coparcener was Thomas de Baskerville, usually styled \"'of Newton,\" of whom I have already spoken as occurring from 1272 to 1294, in connection with Pickthorn, Newton, and other Baskerville estates in South Shropshire.8 In March, 1276, Thomas de Baskerville was one of the Jurors who made Inquest on the estates of John le Strange, then deceased. This I think must have been a result of interests already acquired in Eaton Mascott. The next notice of this Manor is that, like Cound and Kenley, the Seigneury thereof formed part of the estate in frank-marriage which Matilda fitz Alan brought to her husband Philip Burnel. Hence, after the said Philip's decease, an Inquest taken in May 1295 states that Thomas de Baskervile and William de Preston held one carucate of land and 38s. rent in Eton Markcote under Philip and his wife. Thomas de Baskerville was succeeded at Eaton by his son John, whom I have already named under Northwood and Law- ton as occurring in 1316-7 and 1325-6.9 I have little to add to particulars already given, but that little belongs to Eaton Mas- cott. A Deed of his is quoted which bears date at Eaton Mascott on July 25, 1326, and whereby he is said to have quit-claimed, to Richard Waters of Betton, 10^ acres in Eaton Mascott. Among the witnesses of this alleged Deed are Walter and Roger de Burton, and William de Preston. Besides Margaret wife of William Par- sons of Middleton, John de Baskervill seems to have had another daughter, Isabella, to whom he gave, or was said to have given, lands in Eaton Mascott. Isabella was again said to have trans- ferred these lands or part of them to Thomas son of Thomas atte Lee. However, we have notices of a suit, lasting from January 1333 to December 1335, whereby it appears that John de Bas- kervill denied all his alleged grants in Eaton Mascott, and sued Thomas son of Thomas atte Lee, Thomas son of John atte Lee, and Isabella, his own daughter, for disseizing him of one mes- suage, 60 acres of land, and 5 acres of meadow, in Eton Mascot. Thomas son of Thomas atte Lee (the real Tenant) produced John cle Baskervill's Charter of 1326 as to part of the premises, and further alleged certain feoffments made to himself by Isabella de Basker- 9 Supra, Vol. IV, pp. 175-6 ; Vol. V, pp. 102, 110.

It seems that this defence was good, for John de Baskerville at last withdrew the suit, and was in misericordid.10 I should observe that Roger de Middelton, named as his Surety during its progress (viz. in January 1335), was probably John de Baskerville's Grandson, the son of his daughter Margaret. For indications of the eventual failure of this Hne I refer to a former Volume.11 Eaton-Mascott Mill has a history of its own, commencing, as we have seen, with Domesday, and offering several illustrations of the more general history of the Manor. Towards the close of the twelfth century there were apparently two places called Neuthon and The Beche, occupying that bank of the Cound-brook which was opposite to Eaton Mascott, and being themselves in the Manor of Little Eaton, or in the Manor of Pitchford. We have seen Geoffrey de la Beche attesting a Pitchford Deed about 1 192-4. n About ten years later, Hamo fitz Marescot, wish ing, I presume, to improve or reconstruct Eaton Mill, obtained from William de la Beche, son of Richard de la Beche, a feoffment of the whole of that bank of the Cunethe which belonged to the Feoffor' s land of Neuthon and La Beche. A rent of 2d. was re served by the Feoffor, whose Deed was attested by Richard, Canon of Haghmon, Ralph Husey, Vivian de Roshall, Guy de Arundell, William Husei, Nicholas son of Marescot, and WiUiam de Bike down.13 It was, I think, at least twenty years later than this, that Hamo fitz Marescot sold the Mill of Eaton to Haugmond Abbey. There are several Records of the transaction. One of these conveys also half a virgate in Eton, held by one Thoke, and a seilion near the Mill, and reserves a quit-rent of 2d. to William Beche. This Deed is attested by John fitz Alan, John le Strange, William de Hedley, Hugh le Strange, Roger Sprenghose, and Henry Boscart. Another Deed has the additional attestation of Ralph Marescall. A third mentions Petronilla, the wife of Hamo fitz Marscote, and is appa rently a confirmation. It adds a noke in Eaton, held by one Siward, and ensures the suit of the vill of Eaton to the Mill in question. Between the years 1234 and 1236 the Abbot of Haughmond pro cured a direct grant to himself, from William son of Richard de la Beche, of the land previously granted to Hamo fitz Marscot. The old rent of 2c?. was again reserved, and the transaction was attested 10 Extracts from Plea-Rolls, communi- I cated by W.

I cannot tell whether a third Charter by William de la Beche to Haughmond Abbey was explanatory of, or in augmentation of, the former.

The latter occurs at Eaton Mascott as early, I think, as 1270.

Whatever the word Lyth may import, it was common to several localities in the district now under notice. We have Great Lyth, Little Lyth, and Lythwood ,- nor can I offer any other etymology for the name Hundeslit than by supposing it to be equivalent to Huni's Lyth. We have seen that Neen Savage, known to have belonged to one Huni in Saxon times, was hence called Hundesnene, i.e. Huni's Nene1 That a Saxon named Huni or Hunit was at some period Lord of Hundeslit, rests on a still further probability ; \u2014 for in King Edward's time part of the Manor was held by 'one Huning. Now the name Huning is a patronymic, signifying the son or descen dant of Huni. The incidental evidences that Hundeslit, a divided Manor at Domesday, is identical with the Manor of Stapleton, I leave to the sequel. The negative and general proof (often named by me as the best in such cases) I once more recapitulate in this instance. \u2014 If Hundeslit be not Stapleton, then Hundeslit is not represented at all in the modern Hundred of Condover ; and, vice versa, if Staple ton be not the Hundeslit of Domesday, then Stapleton has no Domes day antecedent. As to the time when, and as to a reason why, these names were changed, those questions need little research or argument. Hundeslit was called Stepel-tun, when a Church came to be added to the Manor ; and that the change took place as early as the reign of Stephen I have good proof ; \u2014 for the Lord of the Manor during that reign was called \" De Stepleton.\" I now pro ceed to quote from Domesday the particulars of this then divided Manor. \u2014 \" Roger fitz Corbet holds (under Earl Roger) Hundeslit, a Manor of one virgate and a half; and Ranulf (holds it) under 14 Supra, p. 43. 16 Monasticon, VI, 114. 15 Valor Ecclesiasticus, III, 192. 1 Supra, Vol. IV, p. 232, note."], [561, "109 STAPLETON. him.

(per annum) . Now it is worth 4s.\"3 Most of the names mentioned in these two entries seem to have been otherwise associated with the vicinity. Huning, Huninc, or Hunic, had in Saxon times enjoyed the neighbouring Manors of Cothercot and Welbatch, and had shared in that of Pulverbatch. \u00c6lric was perhaps identical with Elric the Saxon Lord of Hawksley (near Acton Burnell) . Rannulf, Roger Corbet's Tenant in a small portion of Hundeslit, was also his Tenant in the whole of Welbatch. Among some minor changes which befell Roger Corbet's Domesday Barony, he and his Tenant Rannulf lost all interest in Stapleton. Their share thereof was annexed, probably by Henry I, to the Honour of Montgomery. I should not be inclined to attribute such a trifling dismemberment of Roger Corbet's Barony to his participation in the rebellion of Earl Robert de Belesme, for it appears that where Corbet lost one Domesday Manor he gained another. Such changes then were probably the result of some pacific re-arrangement between him and his Suzerains. As to Alward, or Elward, he was doubtless a Saxon, and the same person with him who is elsewhere described as \" son of Elmund.\" The latter too was living at the time of Domesday, and shared in one of the many Manors which his son then held under the Norman Earl. As I have hinted under Condover, the ultimate forfeiture of Elward is more than probable, and his share of Hundeslit was, like Roger Corbet's, annexed to the Honour of Montgomery. Stapleton then, from the time of Henry I, was held of the suc cessive Lords of Montgomery, and by a race of Feoffees, the first of whom, living in the reign of Stephen, I have already alluded to. This was Baldwin de Stapleton, Lord of Stapleton and Wistanstow. He was in all probability a Norman, and his real name De Meisy. A vill, so called, stood at the Western extremity of the Norman Diocese of Seez. Baldwin de Stapleton was succeeded by his son Philip after the year 1165.

Her estates are described as lying at Dormiton (Dormington) and Brictwastre in Herefordshire, and at Boicot, apparently in Shropshire. Her right thereto was disputed by Herbert fitz Herbert, who I think was Seigneural or Mesne Lord of the Manors in question. In Easter Term 1200, I find Emma wife of Phihp de Stapleton naming her husband as her Attorney in the suit of novel disseizin which she had against Herbert fitz Herbert, concerning land in Dormiton and Brictwastre, and in the suit of mort d'ancestre which she had con cerning land in Boicot. The Court decided to hear the first cause at London on the Quinzaine of Easter, but the suit of mort d'an cestre was left to be heard by the Justices in Eyre.4 On April 23 of the same Term, Herbert fitz Herbert was found to have unjustly disseized the Plaintiff and her husband of their tenement in Dor minton and Bricwarestr'. He had to pay half a merk damages. His Baronial rank is noted in the margin of the Roll. The adjourned cause ot mort d'ancestre seems to have come before the Justices-in-Eyre at Salop, in October 1203. It is now how ever called a suit of \" novel disseizin concerning land in Roicoc,\" whereof Herbert fitz Herbert had deprived Philip and Emma de Stapleton. The Seneschal of Herbert fitz Herbert appeared in Court and objected to the cause proceeding, because all his Master's lands were in the King's hands. The Sheriff was hereupon called and examined. He deposed to the fact that Herbert's lands had been so seized because he had neglected to make fine with the Crown for his passage (i. e. to compound for his non-attendance on foreign service), but, said the Sheriff, this seizure was such as that neither the Seneschal nor the Serjeant (Serviens) nor the Bailiff (Prepositus) of the said Herbert had been removed. So the Trial proceeded, and the Jury found Herbert to have disseized the Plaintiffs. How ever, the Justiciars adjourned any order for reseizing the Plaintiffs till they could consult Sir Geoffrey fitz Piers (then Chief Justice of England).5 It seems clear that the place written Boicot or Roicoc, was Boycot near Pontesbury; for at these same Assizes the Plaintiffs had a second suit against Herbert fitz Herbert for disseizing them of a tenement in Pantesb' (Pontesbury) . The same argument was repeated and the same verdict followed, but in this case damages of 2s. were awarded to the Plaintiffs. A third suit, tried at these Assizes, is more to our present pur pose.

The damages were half a merk, and the Defendant in misericordid, but what concern Wilham Botterell can have had in Stapleton is matter of mere conjecture.6 At this period (1203) Philip de Stapleton was a Knight, if I may judge from his position as a Recognizor or Visor on more than one occasion. At the Forest Assizes of March 1209, the Vill of Stapel ton was assessed as within Regard of the Long Forest. In one instance it is described by the name of its owner, viz. as Stapelton Philippi, to distinguish it, I suppose, from the Vill of Stepleton-in- Legharnesse. At the Assizes of November 1221, Philip de Stapleton again appears as a Knight and Juror. As a Suitor also he obtained judg ment against Roger, Serjeant of Meole, William Provost, Warin de Pole, and John fitz Edith, who had disseized him of a tenement in Stapleton. He recovered possession and 10s. damages. The Sureties of the Defendants were Warin de Pulileg, Walter de Neubold, Robert de Pulrebech, Henry de Wesseleg, Richard le Messer, and Riehard fitz Edwin.7 In August 1226 Philip de Stapleton appears on a great Inquest concerning the Forest of Stiperstones. In a fine levied November 12, 1227, he surrenders a claim which he and others seem to have had to a tenancy in the Manor of Pulverbatch. In this instance his Attorney was Robert de Stapleton, \u2014 I think, his Son. The following Deeds probably passed between 1225 and 1230. \u2014 \" Philip de Stapleton, with consent of his son Robert, releases to the Canons of Haghmon all claim in the wood of Wilderley.

The debt had, it seems, been first put in charge in Lin colnshire, but what concern Philip de Stapleton had in that County I know not. He left two sons, Robert and. William. The elder, Robert, appears on the Pipe-Roll of 1230-1 as Surety for a Wis tanstow Tenant. In 1233 he was Surety for other Litigants. On November 2, 1234, he was one of the Justices to deliver Salop Gaol. On July 12, 1235, he was in a similar Commission for the Gaols of Salop, Stafford, and Brug. On September 15, 1235, he was put on a Special Commission to try a civil suit, and in the same month he appears as one of the Receivers of a King's Scutage, payable at Brug. In or about 1240 William de Cantilupe was seized of several estates as representative of the ancient Lords of Montgomery. Robert de Stapleton's tenure of Stapelton is de scribed as one-fifth of a knight's-fee, held by \"Robert de Meisy \" under that Baron.10 Soon after this, Robert de Stapleton or De Meisy died; for a Herefordshire Feodary drawn up on January 23, 1243, records that John son and heir of Robert de Stapelton, was then holding two hides in Dorminton under Herbert fitz Peter, and by Serjeantry. This John had, I think, a younger brother, Robert, usually called Robert de Meisy, but of him and of other Cadets of the family I shall speak elsewhere. The Condover Hun dred-Roll of 1255 records John de Stepelton as holding Stepelton, of the Fief of Sir William de Canteloy, for a hide and half of land (the Domesday measurement of the aggregate Manor of Hundeslit). He paid 12c?. yearly for stretward and motfee, and did suit to both County and Hundred.11 In 1256 we find John de Stepelton on the list of those, who, holding 15 Librates of land in Shrop shire, were not as yet Knights. A Patent of September 1257 allows him the privilege of hunting in the Royal Forests of the County. The Pipe-Roll of 1259 refers to the Originalia-Roll of 1258 for particulars of a fine or fines, of 1 merk, and half a merk of gold, proffered by John de Stepelton for a charter of market, fair, and free- warren ; but I can learn nothing further of this transaction, 9 Dukes's Transcripts (in Bihl.

At the Assizes of September in that year the Condover Jurors reported Robert, Lord of Stepleton, as not in due attendance. Moreover, though holder of a Knight's-fee, and of full age, he was not as yet a Knight. The Inquest on the death of George de Cantilupe, ordered in November 1273, seems to have noticed the Manor of Stepleton as held of his Barony,13 but the document itself is lost. In November 1274 the Jurors of Chirbury Hundred, returning the names of certain persons as holding of the Honour of Mont gomery though not in the said Hundred, reported that \" Robert de Stepulston held the Fill of Stepelston without any service, which Vill had used to be held of the Honour aforesaid, by service of one Knight's-fee, and that the said service was withdrawn, and the Vill was answerable for nothing.\"13 In August 1282,. when the King's army was summoned to muster at Rhuddlan, Sir Robert de Stapleton was one of the Knights named by Sir Theobald de Verdon, in the contingent due from himself, as owing the services of 3^ knights' fees. This same year a Robert de Stapleton, perhaps the person under notice, had a grant of Crown lands in Ireland.14 In Easter Term 1280 I find Milisent widow of Eudo la Zouche asserting her claims as a coheiress of Cantilupe, and impleading (among others) Robert de Stepleton, as Tenant of half a knight's-fee in Stapleton. In Hilary and Easter Terms 1283 we have evidence on the Plea-Rolls that this suit was still pending. However the Feodary of 1284 re cognizes Robert de Stepleton as Tenant of half a knight's-fee under Milisent la Suche, who held the same in capite. An Inquest was taken April 3, 1284, pursuant to a Writ of King Edward I, and with reference to Robert de Stapelton's design of en closing and making a Park ofthe Bosc of Alsemore. The Jurors found that the change would not be injurious to the Crown; that only a corner of the said Bosc abutted on the Long Forest; the said Bosc had ever been divided from the main Forest (bassd haid), and no Regard was accustomed to be made therein ; that Robert de Stepelton used the said Bosc as an enclosure for his own cattle ; that it contained five acres of land, and was not frequented by beasts of chace. A memoran dum attached to this Inquest intimates that in consequence ofthe large concession sought by De Stepelton, the King would require fuller information when the Justices of the Forest visited Shropshire.15 | M Calendar of Patent-Rolls, V. 50.

A Charter of Free-Warren, obtained by Robert de Stepelton in 1290, informs us of his estates in four several Counties. Besides Wistanstow and Stepelton in Shropshire, the Charter extends to Dormingtou in Herefordshire, Waleton in Derbyshire, and Norman ton in Leicestershire. In October 1292 Robert de Stepleton was impleaded by the Crown for this Manor, as having sometime been the Seizin-in-fee of King Henry II. He appealed to a Jury, naming Stephen de Stepleton his Attorney. The question seems to have been one of tenure, and was decided for the Defendant, viz. that he had a better right to hold the Manor as he held it, than the King had to recover it in the way sought.16 Robert de Stapelton was, in 1297, returned as holding lands or rents in Derbyshire and Shropshire to the yearly value of \u00a320. and upwards. He was therefore one of those who were summoned with horse and arms to muster at Nottingham, on July 7, for service in Scotland. In 1301 a similar summons, returnable on June 24, at Berwick-upon-Tweed, was served on Robert de Stepelton, as a Landholder in Leicestershire. A Writ of King Edward I, dated at Berwick-upon-Tweed, on July 15 following, commissions Robert de Stapelton to inquire into the conduct of certain Officers or Bailiffs in Shropshire who had taken bribes from the foot-soldiers impressed for the Scottish wars, and allowed them to remain at home.17 We shall see that in 1307 a Robert de Stapleton presented to Stapleton Church. Some Pedi grees suggest that there were two Sir Roberts in succession, and that the change took place about this time. A Patent, apparently of Edward II, and which, if his, passed August 22, 1311, declares that the King, at request of John de Somery, has pardoned Robert de Stepelton the trespass which he had done by enclosing his Bosc of Alissemor and of Stanleymor (which was within the bounds of the King's Forest), and making a Park thereof, the Royal license not having been first obtained. The Patent proceeds to secure the said enclosure and Park, to Ste pelton and his heirs for ever.18 A Roll ofthe \"names and arms ofthe Banneretsof England,\" which belongs to this period, enters Sire Robert dc Stepeltone under Stafford shire, his shield being \u2014 Azure, a Lion rampant double-queued, Or.19 On October 16, 1313, Robert de Stepelton is pardoned for his 16 Placita de Quo Waranto, p. 674. 17 Parliamentary Writs, I, 845. 18 The original Patent, in possession of | W.

He had several Military Summonses against the Scots during the reign of Edward II, viz. on August 20, 1316, and on March 20 and May 22, 1319. He was also summoned to attend a Great Council, pursuant to a Writ attested at Westminster, May 9, 1324.20 Sir Robert de Stapleton was living in 1329,21 but deceased in 1333. It appeal's to me that Sir Robert de Stapleton had no issue by his second wife, Isabella de Bermingham. His heir was apparently Ro bert, son of Philip de Stapleton, whom I take to have been his grand son by his first wife, rather than his Nephew, or Great-Nephew. By Indenture, made at Birmingham on July 20, 1333, it is re cited that Isabella, widow of Sir Robert de Stepeltone, having been impleaded by Robert son of Philip de Stepeltone, for certain lands and tenements, had now surrendered the same, whereupon the said Robert son of Philip concedes to the said Isabella all her goods, chattels, and live and dead stock found on the premises, with free power to remove the same.

John de Stapleton, Patron of the same Church in 1381, was probably son and heir of the last Robert. He served the office of Sheriff of Shropshire in 1383 and 1391. In the fifteenth century the Stapleton estates were divided among coheiresses, but I forbear to extend my remarks to a matter which presents many difficulties, and on which my present information is fragmentary. The subject will recur under Wistanstow. Of Undertenants in Stapleton, I should first notice William, the younger son of that Philip de Stapleton who was deceased in 1231. At the Assizes of 1256 there was a suit concerning haff a virgate in Stapelton, between William son of Philip de Stapelton, on the one hand, and Geoffrey fitz Henry of Ruthon, and Emma his wife, on the other. Stapleton gave half a merk for license to accord. The Fine, hereupon levied, places the half-virgate in Little Hauwood. William de Stapleton, the Tenant, acknowledges the right of Emma thereto, and she, with her husband, concedes it to William, to hold in fee, of themselves and the heirs of Emma, at a penny rent. Later in the century there was a Sir William de Sta pleton interested in this neighbourhood, but I will not assume him to have been the same person with the above. He attests a Longnor Deed in 1272, and was one of two Knights who presided over an im portant Inquest concerning Lythwood in 1280. 24 A testing- clause of 1284, already given under Condover,24 contains the names of Sir W'illiam and Sir Robert de Stapleton. Here the Head of the House seems to be placed second in order, probably because Sir William was a much older man. This Sir William was unques tionably Father of that Philip de Stapleton whom I have named under Willey as living in 1277-8 and deceased in 1283, and who appears to have left no issue by his wife Burga de Wililey.25 Robert, perhaps a Brother of the said Philip, has occurred to us in 1292, where joint mention is also made of his Mother, viz. Isabel widow of William de Stapleton.26 Another Cadet of this House was Robert de Meisy, younger son, I think, of that Robert de Sta pleton who was deceased in 1243. At the Assizes of January 1256 this Robert and Eva his wife (by their Attorney, Absolon de Upham), sued Philip Marmyun and Johanna his wife, John de Neweton, and Roger de Weslegh, for disseizing them of a tenement in Stepelton. Marmyun evaded the issue by pleading that his wife 24 Inquisitions, S Edw. I, No. 45, b, and I supra, p. 17.

The Court gave the Plaintiffs leave to amend the form of their procedure.27 In April following, I find Robert de Meysy taking out a new Writ for disseizin in Stapleton, but the Defendant named is Eva widow of Philip Mar mion,\u2014a complex but intelligible error. The Pipe-Roll of the year records a debt of 20s., due from Robert de Meysi and Eva his wife, pro habendd assisd. On October 20, 1259, Robert de Meysi and his wife take out another Writ against Philip Marmion. At the Forest Assizes of 1262 one Robert de Stepleton is mentioned, appa rently as deceased. Richard de Bradele is named as his Essoignor. He was perhaps the same with Robert de Meysy. STAPLETON CHURCH. This Church was probably founded in the first half of the twelfth century, as I have already suggested. Such a date of Foundation necessarily implies that it was originally a Chapel, \u2014 an affiliation of some greater Church. It is indeed often called a Chapel in early Records. I cannot hesitate to assign Condover as the Mother Church of Stapleton. The Taxation of 1291 values the Church of Stepelton, in the Deanery of Salop, at \u00a34. per annum.29 The Assessors of the Ninth, in 1341, call the Church a Chapel, and rate the Parish at \u00a31 . 16s. 8d. to the current tax. The cultivation of the land was in a low state, and the Glebe-land, Small-tithes, and Rents, belonging to the Chapel, constituted \u00a32. 13s. 4d. of the Church Taxation.29 The Valor of 1534-5 gives Stepulton as a Rectory, held by Richard Webbe, and worth \u00a37. per annum. The Procurations were Is., the Synodals Is. 8d. per annum. A Pension of 10s. was payable by the Rector to Shrewsbury Abbey.30 This charge, though mentioned in no earlier Record, was beyond all doubt a vestige of the original dependence of Stapleton Chapel on Condover Church.

How ever, I cannot make out that Welbatch was, like Stapleton, lost to Corbet's Seigneury or annexed to the Honour of Montgomery. The only direct evidence I have on the point would indicate the Barons of Pulverbatch as the Seigneural Lords of Welbatch in the thirteenth century, but that evidence is of a doubtful character, as we shall see in the sequel. On the other hand, a piece of indirect evidence favours the opinion that Corbet's Seigneury over Welbatch continued. \u2014 We have seen in a former Volume that, about the year 1203-4, William fitz Walter conveyed to Robert de Gatacre half a hide in Great Lyth, held under the Barony of Pulverbatch ; also that he added to the concession certain nokes of land, held of the Fee of Alberbury.3 My conviction is that these nokes were in Wel batch, a Manor which adjoined Great Lyth. If so, Welbatch was probably of the Fee of Alberbury ,\u2014 an expression which can have but one meaning, viz. that Welbatch, like Alberbury, was held by Fitz Warin under Corbet of Caus. Baldwin de Hodnet, I should add, the first witness of William fitz Walter's concession, was 1 \" Molinum hiemale non \u00e6stivum.\" 3 Supra, Vol. Ill, p. 88. 2 Domesday, so. 255, b. 1."], [572, "120 HUELBEC, NOW WELBATCH. probably Fitz Warin's immediate tenant at Welbatch. Whether Corbet was Seigneural Lord of Welbatch or not, it is clear on other evidence that Fitz Warin of Whittington was Mesne-Lord, and that under Fitz Warin the family of De Hodnet had the tenure in fee. Now these De Hodnets were Seneschals of Montgomery Castle, and so, on the death of Baldwin de Hodnet, early in 1225, his estates, as well those which he held of the Crown by that service of Seneschalcy, as those which he held of other Lords, were seized into the Kinges hand by Godescall de Maghelin, then Custos of Montgomery Castle. But a precept of Henry III, dated Feb. 12, 1225, draws a distinction between these two classes of estates, and commands the said Custos \" to give Fulk fitz Warin seizin of Hwelbech and Muston (Moston), which Baldwin de Hodnet had held of the said Fulk in capite, but to retain whatever Baldwin had held of the King's fee of Montgomery.\" 4 The next notice which I have of this place is in or about 1240, when Odo de Hodenet (the son of Baldwin) had attained his full age, and was registered as Tenant of half a knight's-fee in Welbach.5 This Tenure is entered under the Barony or Fief of Hugh de Kilpee, then Baron of Pul- verbatch, but the list of Kilpec's Fees is so manifestly incorrect in other respects, that I do not trust it in this. Moreover the Mesne- tenure of Fitz-Warin is altogether ignored. The Hundred-Roll of 1255 is more accurate in this respect. It says that Sir Odo de Hodenet holds Wulbech of Fulk fitz Warin for a hide of land (the Domesday estimate). He paid 8d. per annum for stretward and motfee, but had withdrawn himself from suit (of County and Hundred) twelve years before, whereby the King was damaged 24s., or at the rate of 2s. per annum6 The Inquest taken Feb. 15, 1284, on the death of Sir Odo de Hodenet, states that his tenure of Whelbeche under Fulk fitz Warin was by service of one- twentieth part of a knight's-fee. The value of the estate was 54s. per annum.1 Welbatch passed with the heir-general of the Hodnets to the Ludlows. Hence on the death of William de Ludlow in 1316 an Inquest, taken on November 11th at Shrewsbury, states that he and his wife Matilda (she was the Hodnet heiress) had jointly held the Vills of Welbache and Moston by feoffment of William de Hodnet. The Tenure of both Vills was clearly under one person and inferentially (for I quote an obliterated Record) under Fulk 4 Rot. Claus. Vol. II, p. 16. 5 Testa de Nevill, pp. 48, b, 50, a. 6 Rot.

They were held, I think it is stated, by service of a tenth part of a knight's-fee.8 An abstract of this Inquest, taken when the Document was more legible, gives the constituents of the estate at Welbache as a Messuage, 80 acres of land, a water-mill, and 58s. 6d. in rents.9 In 1326 the Canons of St. Chads, Shrews bury, seem to have had property at Whelebcche.10 ftcttm BurneU, This was another of Roger fitz Corbet's Domesday Manors, and the Seigneury remained with his Descendants, the Barons of Caus. Domesday describes it thus. \u2014 \"The same Roger (fitz Corbet) holds Actune (ofthe Earl) and one Roger (holds it) of him. Godric held it (in Saxon times) and was a free man. Here are three and a half hides geldable. In demesne there is one ox-team, and (there are) n Serfs, i Villain, mi Boors, and i Radman, with a Team and half. In King Edward's time (the Manor) was worth 30s. per annum ; afterwards it was worth 15s.; now it is worth 20s. There might be one team more here.\"1 I cannot affirm, nor will I deny, that Roger, the Domesday Tenant of Actune, was Ancestor of those Burnels who afterwards gave the Manor its distinctive name. Such a descent rests on the average probability that the Tenant of any given Manor in the twelfth century was lineal heir of the Tenant in the eleventh century. Dug dale has given us a genealogy, or rather List, of the Burnels which would make the name of the Domesday Representatives of the family to have been Robert.2 However this evidence is very ques tionable. Dugdale's list of Burnels was copied from an old Martyr ology belonging to Buildwas Abbey. It was either then the result of a Record kept by, or a Genealogy extemporized by, the Monks of Buildwas. As Buildwas was not founded till fifty years after Domes day, the evidence of its Monks in this matter is so far doubtful as it was less than cotemporary. But we may judge this Martyrology by another standard. It gives the names and obits of seven suc cessive Burnels. To the last three of these names we can apply 1 Domesday, so. 255, b, 1. 2 Dugdale's Baronage, II, 60. 8 Inquisitions, 10 Edw. II, No. 9 Calendar, Vol. I, p. 283. 10 Hist. Shrewsbury, II, 184.

The later half of this Martyrology being thus discovered to be men dacious, the earlier half is still less to be trusted. We must, in short, reject the whole as fabulous. It was evidently a tribute de vised by obsequious Monks to gratify the pride of the Burnels in the days of their prosperity. I shall now have to give a less dog matic but a very different account of the rise and fortunes of that familv. The first Burnel of whom I find authentic mention, is William Burnell. He attests a Charter of Peter, Prior of Wenlock, which I shall set forth under Hughley, and show to have passed between 1169 and 1176. Soon after this we have evidence of two distinct branches of this family, each holding or claiming to hold a share of Acton Burnell and other estates. The representative of the (sup posed) elder branch was Thomas Burnel, and he had a brother Wil liam. The representative of the (supposed) younger branch was Gerin, or Warin, Burnel. It is probable that Thomas and Gerin were more distantly related than as brethren. It is also probable that Thomas and William were sons of that William who attests the Wenlock Deed above mentioned. Among the Oblata entered in the Shropshire Pipe-Roll of 1182 is this one. \u2014 -\"Gerin Burnell accounts for 5 merks to have trial (pro recto) in the Curia Regis, concerning one knight's-fee in Aketon.\" He had paid 22s. already. The balance of 44s. 8d. he discharged in the year following. This suit was probably against Thomas Burnel, who was, I think, holding the whole of Acton Burnell at the period, and who seems to have been Lord of Langley and Ruck- ley, an estate which was held in capite by Serjeantry. The Suit between Thomas and Gerin Burnel was seemingly of long duration. It was settled by a Fine levied after the year 1189 (because in the time of Richard I), and before 1195, when, as I shall show, Thomas Burnell was dead. The particulars of this fine are not recorded, further than that it dealt with a knight's-fee, and half a hide, and 12 acres of land, in Akerton (Acton), Langley, and Ruckley. The result, gathered from later evidences, was that Gerin Burnell ob- tained a share of Acton. In 1195 Thomas Burnel died without issue. His tenure by Serjeantry necessitated a fine with the Crown by his heir. Hence the Pipe- Roll of 1195 exhibits William Burnel as \" accounting 40s. for having the land of his Brother Thomas, whose next heir he is.\" He paid 20s. now, and 20s. in the year following.."], [575, "123 ACTON BURNELL. On January 14,1198, a Fine was levied at Shrewsbury which shows William Burnill buying off for 16 merks the claim of Simon Burnill to a hide and half-virgate of land in Akton Burnill. Simon, who gives an absolute surrender, was probably a Cadet of the family, but more nearly related to William than to Gerin Burnell, who still held his share of the Manor, and was about this time succeeded by a son and heir, Hugh. Continuing my account of William Burnel (II), as he may fitly be called, I observe his name as a Knight sitting on the Grand Assize, which I have mentioned under Nordley Regis, as taken in Easter Term 1200.3 In the same Term Hugh Burnel was one of the absent Recognizors empanelled to try the cause men- tioned under Harnage.4 At the Assizes of October 1203, William Burnell again appears as a Knight and Juror of Grand-Assize. In November 1204 he was Visor of the alleged illness of Warner de Wililey, who was essoigning himself at Kenley. In March 1209 the Forest Assize-Roll gives one imbladement in the Long Forest, and two in the Forest of Mount Gilbert, as chargeable on William Burnell. In 1211 he is duly recorded as Tenant in capite of Lang- ley, a matter which at present I postpone. I gather from evidence given at a trial in the year 1272, that William Burnel (II) died in the year 1220. This date was perhaps not intended as quite exact, but it is certain that William Burnel (II) was succeeded by a son and heir, William. I conclude it was William Burnel (III), who, at the Assizes of November 1221, appears not only as a Knight and Juror, but as one of the four Coroners of Shropshire. At these Assizes a presentment of much interest occurs among the Pleas of the Crown for Condover Hundred. The transaction alluded to seems to have taken place some years before, that is, during the Shrievalty of Thomas de Erdinton, \u2014which expired in April 1216. Gerin Burnell, implicated therein, I take to have been son of Hugh, but Hugh (as we shall see) was alive long after. This Gerin Bur- nell, with William Corbet and others, had, it was alleged, robbed a Monk of Buildwas, at the instigation of Thomas Corbet, whose Aunt had a House in the Abbey Foregate, at Shrewsbury, in which House the robbery was said to have taken place. Since the rob- bery, Gerin Burnell and William Corbet, to avoid arrest, had come forward and given 5 merks to be allowed to find Sureties for their future appearance to take their trial. Robert Corbet (evidently the Baron of Caus, and father of Thomas) had stood security for the fine. The Sureties for the reappearance of the accused were chiefly \u25a0 ' . 3 Supra, Vol. Ill, p. 157.

In Hilary Term 1229 William Burnel is impleading Hugh Burnel at Westminster, for non-observance of the \" Fine made in time of King Richard, between Gerin Burnel, Father of Hugh and Thomas Burnel, Uncle (avuncuium) of William, Tenant of one Knight's-fee, half a hide, and 12 acres, in Akerton and Langelle and Ruchelegh, whereof there was a Chyrograph.\" The present Litigants are ex pressly stated to be heirs of the parties to the Fine. The suit was adjourned, because of Hugh Burnel's non-appearance ; and I hear no more of it. His future appearance was ensured by William de la Beche and Philip Burnel.6 What place this Philip should occupy in the genealogy of the Burnels I cannot say. In 1231 William Burnel fines one merk, that he may hold in peace an assart which he had made across the bosc of Fulwud.7 In 1238 we have recurrent mention of Warin (i.e. Gerin) BurneU. He is amerced one merk for some disseizin. I presume that he had ere this succeeded his supposed Father, Hugh. In 1240 a list of Thomas Corbet's Barony gives William and Geryn Burnell as hold ing- one knight's-fee thereof in Acton. Two cotemporary lists make the tenure half a fee, and erroneously class it under the Barony of Hugh de Kilpec.8 About March 1247, when Robert Passelewe visited Shropshire, for the purposes detailed under Little Sutton,9 William Burnel compounded with him for certain alienations of his Serjeantry at Langley. In the course of that year he died, and on October 20th King Henry III received the homage of William Burnel, his son and heir, whom I shall call William Burnel (IV). It was probably in the year 1248 that WiUiam Burnel (IV) brought disgrace on his name, such disgrace as may well account for the Buildwas Monks having excluded this notorious malefactor 5 Assizes, 6 nen.

A Plea- Roll of 33 Henry III (1248-9) notices a pending Suit between William, son of William, and Grandson of William Burnel, and the Abbot of Shrewsbury. It related to a Fine levied in 1197 by William Burnel, the Grandfather, and Hugh, a former Abbot. What I here have to notice most, is that the suit was adjourned sine die, because WiUiam Burnel, the present Litigant, \" had committed felony by slaying a man.\" The Inquests taken on this matter are more par ticular as to the crime. One, ordered by Writ Royal of April 17, 1249, says that William Burnel had slain two men, and that he was already outlawed.10 A later Inquest, ordered by Writ of March 16, 1253, gives the names of his two victims. One was * * * * Curteis, the other was a Priest, named Gilbert. The outlawry had been pronounced after due process in the County Court.11 It is obvious that, after the sentence of outlawry had issued in 1249, the King must have had William Burnel's share of Acton BurneU for a year and a day. In the ordinary course, the said share would then revert to the Suzerain, that is, to Thomas Corbet of Caus. That Baron appears to me to have introduced Hugh de Beckbury therein, but not, I think, as a regular Feoffee. Mean time the name of Burnel was by no means obliterated in the dis grace of its Chief. Roger Burnel actually sat on the Inquests of 1249 and 1253, which I just now was quoting; and Philip Burnel sat on the Inquest of 1253, and occurs in October of the same year as Juror in a great Inquest concerning the right of Patronage over Haughmond Abbey. Now, of these two persons, it is evident that Roger was the representative of Gerin Burnel, living in 1240. The Hundred- Roll of 1255 says accordingly that \" Roger Burnel and Hugh de Becbur' hold Acton Burnel, for three hides, of the Fief of Sir Thomas Corbet, and they pay 2s. per annum for stretward and motfee, and do suit to Condover Hundred.\"12 The Pipe-Roll of 1257 contains a reminiscence of William Burnel the Outlaw. His Chat tels, valued at \u00a31 . 10s. 8d., had been sold by the Sheriff, and the proceeds handed over to William de Gardinis (he was now Lord of '\u00b0 \u2022 \u00bb Inquisitions, 33 Hen.

The Assize-Roll of 1262 supplies us with several hints that Thomas Corbet of Caus had been a recent Visitor, or occasional resident, at Acton Burnel. He is styled Thomas Corbet in Acton, a usual proof of residence, and was apparently liable to amercement for some default. The words coram Rege are added to the entry, instead of (as we should have expected) the amount of his amercement. The words indicate, I think, that, being a Baron, he could only be amerced by the King. The next entry is that of an amercement of half a merk, set upon Robert de Acton-Burnel, Clerk, for default. These two persons were further involved in a more serious matter. It was presented that \" Sir Thomas Corbet had taken, on Thursday before the Epi- phany, in the King's 42nd year (that is, on Thursday, January 4, 1258), a two-year old deer (unum brokettum cervi), and had carried the carcase to the house of Robert de Acton, Clerk.\" The Justices hereupon issued an order to the Bishop of Chester to cause Robert de Acton to appear. Thomas Corbet they destined to take his trial before the King. Corbet must have had a long Chace, if we may judge by the Vills which were pronounced to be in misericordid for not duly investigating this trespass. They were Haughton (near Morville), MorviUe itself, Aldcnham, Aston (Aston Eyre), Muckley, Willey, Bold, Longden, Pyklescot, and Woolstaston. These appearances of Thomas Corbet at Acton Burnel I take to have been the result of his having in hand a share of the Manor, viz. as the Escheat of William Burnel. I will give further evidence of this immediate interference of the Seigneural Lord. In August 1267, among Pleas heard at Shrewsbury was one by William Crone, who charged Thomas Corbet with disseizing him of a free tenement in Acton Burnel. On Crone's withdrawal of the Plea, Corbet re stored to him a messuage and half a virgate, and Crone in turn gave Corbet 40s. to purchase his goodwill (pro bonq pacis) 13 I have thus far paved the way for a subject of more than merely Antiquarian interest. \u2014 The disgrace and ruin of one member of the house of Burnel was to be shortly eclipsed by the all but kiugly exaltation of another. At the time of which I am speaking, Robert Burnell, the future ChanceUor of England, was a Clerk in the ser vice of Prince Edward.14 Acton Burnell was in all probability his 13 Placita apud Salop,511Ien.III,m.4j. 11 At one time I supposed Robert Bur- I nel to have been identical with Robert de I Acton, Clerk, abovo and elsewhere (Vol. V."], [579, "127 ROBERT BURNELL, native place, and he obtained, by purchase rather than by inhe ritance, the fee-simple of the whole Manor ; \u2014 both that portion which had belonged to the Outlaw, and that which we last saw in the hands of Roger Burnell. What was Robert BurneU's relation ship to any of the Burnells already mentioned, is a question on which I wiU throw the little light I am able, in the course of the narrative. The first mention I have found of Robert BurneU is in company with other Clerks of Prince Edward, who were apparently about to accompany the Prince on a visit to France. A Patent of protection, usual to such occasions, issued in behalf of the said Clerks, and bears date November 8, 1260. Robert BurneU's ac quisitions at Acton BurneU probably commenced before the year 1263, for a Patent bearing date in June of that year mentions him in company with Thomas Corbet of Caus, Peter his son, and seven teen other persons, of whom I know that at least fifteen were Vassals of the said Thomas Corbet: The whole of this company had the King's letters of protection till November 1 following, in case the War with Wales should last so long. It is certain that during the campaign of this year Robert Burnell was employed by Prince Edward, whom we know to have been at Shrewsbury in April, caring for the state of the Marches.15 The next occurrence of his name is stUl more significant. It is in a Patent of March 1265, one of those Pseudo-Patents which issued while King Henry and Prince Edward were captives of Montfort. \u2014 Robert Burnell and others have Letters of Safe- Conduct into South Wales, whither they are going \" on the affairs of Edward the King's son.\" I have a note of a Charter of Henry III to Robert Burnell \" concerning 15s. rent in Langele, Rokele, Hocales, and Acton Burnell, within the Forest of Salop.\" This Charter was dated October, 1266, when the King was before Kenilworth.16 It is ex plained by a cotemporary Patent, wherein the King remits to Robert Burnell, in fee, an annual rent of 15s. paid for assarts made in the Boses of the Manors of Langeley, Rockley, Howhales, and Acton Burnell, within the Forest of Salop, so that he and his heirs were to hold the said assarts, quit of waste and regard for ever. A second Patent allows the said Robert BurneU to impark his bosc pp. 118, 119) spoken of. Lord Camp bell's statement (Lives ofthe Chancellors) that Robert Burnel's father was named Robert, strengthened this idea, for Robert de Acton was son of one Robert de Lega. A fortuitous piece of evidence, which I will mark in a future note, has convinced me that this identity is imaginary. 15 F\u0153dera, I, 425. 16 Harlcian MSS. 1982, so. 52."], [580, "128 ACTON BURNELL. which was within the King's Forest of Salop.17 By Charter tested at Westminster November 30, 1269, King Henry III accords to Robert Burnell, \" his beloved Clerk,\" the privilege of holding a weekly Market on Tuesdays at Acton Burnell, also of holding two annual Fairs there, one on the vigU, the day, and the morrow of the Annunciation, the other on the vigil, day, and morrow of Michaelmas. He is further allowed a right of free-warren in his demesnes at Acton BurneU, Langley, Alecote (Allcott), Bedleswrthin (Belswardine) and Euthon (Eudon BurneU).18 A Patent of April 27, 1270, allows Robert Burnell to enclose the Bosc of Cumbes, though within the Royal Forest, and to make a Park; and, whereas he had taken (for that purpose) 40 acres of his own ground in Acton Bur neU and Acton Pygod, without license, he is hereby pardoned. I now come to a curious question. Robert BurneU is said on aU hands to have accompanied Prince Edward on the Crusade. That he intended to do so is clear from the following documents. A Patent of July 13, 1270, is a protection for those who, having volunteered in this cause, were termed Crucesignati, and Robert BurneU is among them. These Letters of protection extended to the Patentees, their Vassals, lands, and effects, and purported to exempt them from Law-suits in general for four years ending Easter 1274 ; but the Patent was to be inoperative, if the Cruce signatus for whom it was drawn either failed to set out or returned within that period.19 At this time Henry himself intended to lead the Crusade ; \u2014 a design which was soon abandoned. A Patent of August 2, 1270, concedes to Robert Burnell, as a Crucesignatus, seeing \" he is about to set out to the Holy Land with Edward the King's son,\" that WiUiam de Middelhope and Malcolumb de Har ley, should be admitted to act as his (BurneU's) Attorneys in aU things, he having so appointed them in presence of the King. This permission was to extend to June 24, 1274, unless Robert Burnell returned home in the interval. I should, by the way, notice another Patent of August 4, 1270, which, at the instance of Robert Bumell, \" Clerk to the King aud to Prince Edward,\" allows that Hugh and William, brothers of the said Robert Burnell, should not be em panelled (as Jurors) in any Assize, and should not be appointed to any Shrievalty, Coronership, or Escheatorship, so long as they should live.

Without pretending to a very minute investigation of the matter, I select, as most con sistent with the Patent- Rolls, the date given in the Annals of Waverley, viz. August 19, 1270, when it would seem that the Prince and his companions embarked from Dover. If Robert Burnell ever embarked with the Prince, there is abundant evidence that he re turned home long before Edward, and probably before the latter reached Palestine. A Patent of January 24, 1272, mentions Robert Burnell as Arch deacon of York ; another of February 20th shows him holding that dignity, and in actual attendance in King Henry's Court at West minster.20 On June 18, 127.2, Prince Edward, then at Acre, in Palestine, made a WiU, wherein he appointed Robert BurneU one of his Ex- ecutors, but in terms which do not indicate where Burnel was at the time.20 At the County Assizes of September 1272, the Jurors for Condover Hundred reported Robert Burnel's establishment of a Market at Acton Burnel. They also stated that the ViUs of Acton Burnel and Langley, having been used to do suit to the Hundred every three weeks, had been withdrawn six years previously, and that two-thirds of the Vill of Acton Pigot having owed suit to the Sheriffs' tourn had been withdrawn two years previously, all by Ro- bert BurneU. Moreover Robert Burnel, and Robert, Clerk of Acton,21 were not in due attendance at these Assizes. One of the Jurors who made these presentments was William Burnel, no doubt the brother of Robert already mentioned, whilst Hugh Burnel, the other brother, was apparently a Knight, and sat as a Juror in causes tried by Grand Assize. A Patent of the 19th of this same month of September aptly shows why Robert Burnell was not in Shropshire. With the Arch bishop of York and Roger de Mortimer, he is named as a locum tenens of the King's absent son Edward. Another Patent of Sep tember 24 gives protection to Archdeacon Burnel's men, and to any traders who might attend the Market and Fairs recently chartered at Acton BurneU. Though Burnel was not in Palestine, it appears that Malcolumb 20 F\u0153dera, Vol. I, p. 492, 495. 21 It is this mention of Robert de Acton, Clerk, in the same document with I Robert Burnel, that shows them to have been two persons (vide supra, pp. 126-7, note 14). vi. 17"], [582, "130 ACTON BURNELL. de Harley was acting as his Attorney at this period. In the course of the above Assizes the said Malcolumb acknowledges a debt of 10 merks due from Robert BurneU his lord, to Walter de Conede. The ground of this debt wiU appear under Belswardine. A Fine levied at the same Assizes was between Robert Burnell (Plaintiff, through his Attorney Malcolumb de Harley) and Martin de Burchton and Elina his wife (Impedients), of a messuage in Acton Burnell, and 60 acres of land in Pychford, called Collyngacre. Martin and Elina acknowledged a gift thereof to Robert Burnell, to hold in fee, of themselves and the heirs of Elina, at a penny rent, and by performance of all services due to the capital Lords of the fees. For this, Burnel is said to give a sore sparroiv-hawk. King Henry III died on November 16, 1272, and it is evident that the Archbishop of York, Roger de Mortimer, and Robert Burnell assumed the Regency, pending the continued absence of Prince Edward. In or about January 1273 we are told that this Trio convened a Parliament or rather a CouncU of the Realm at Westminster, and took oaths of fealty from all the Lieges, on behalf of King Edward.22 The same authority intimates that Walter de Merton was appointed to the vacant Chancellorship at this Coun cU. That, however, is an error, for Merton attests as ChanceUor immediately after King Henry's death, that is, on November 29, 1272. He was doubtless appointed thus early, by Burnel and his colleagues, and it is a proof of the large discretion aUowed to those Commissioners, that Edward confirmed the appointment by letter as soon as he heard of it. On September 21, 1274, King Edward, now on his father's throne, bestowed the Great Seal on Robert Burnel himself. On January 23, 1275, the new Chancellor was elected to the See of Bath and Wells, and was consecrated Bishop on April 7 following. . Burnell as a Jurist and Statesman is no fit subject for a pro vincial pen. His public career has been criticized and his praises recorded on a nobler page. As a Bishop he was unknown to Shropshire, and, I may add, far from well-known iu his own Dio cese. I am to speak of him here chiefly in respect of those terri torial acquisitions which entitled his successors to a place among the Barons of the realm. In November 1274 the Condover Jurors spoke with uncompro mising plainness of the newly created Chancellor and his affairs. \"Robert Burnel,\" said they, \"is holding Acton Buruel in warren 22 Annals of Wan cley, p. 227."], [583, "131 ROBERT BURNEL. since the 52nd year of Henry III, the Jurors know not by what warranty.\"33 And again, \"Robert Burnel did make a Park at Acton Burnel in the 53rd year of King Henry, the Jurors know not by what warranty.\"23 Again I notice that William Burnel, probably the Chancellor's own brother, was one of the Jurors who made these observations. Dugdale, whose account of the Burnels of the thirteenth cen tury is extremely inaccurate, speaks of two brothers of the family, \" Robert and William,\" who were drowned at Nevyn in 1282. He also identifies Robert BurneU, thus said to be drowned, with Ro bert Burnell who had had the grant of Market, etc., in 1269.21 The conclusion due on these premises would be the very prepos terous one that Lord Chancellor Burnel was drowned in 1282 ! However, this drowning story was probably founded on a fact, and we search for the true particulars elsewhere. \u2014 The Chroniclers give various accounts of a great mischance which befell the English arms near the Menai Straits, on St. Leo nard's Day (November 6) 1282. The King's forces were, it seems, encamped in Anglesey, but the Straits had been spanned by a bridge of vessels. A large party of the English, commanded by Sir William Latimer, and seconded by a troop of Gascon Merce naries, crossed this bridge to plunder or to explore. They were surprised by the Welsh, overpowered, and put to flight. A high tide prevented them from regaining their bridge, and nearly the whole party were slaughtered or drowned in the endeavour. From thirteen to fifteen knights, from seventeen to thirty-two Esquires of name, from two hundred to a thousand foot-soldiers, are variously stated to have fallen in this manner. One Chronicle enumerates among the slain, two Gentlemen of good accompt, that were bre thren to Robert Burnell then Bishop of Bath.25 I can show the probability of this statement from other Records. Sir WiUiam Burnel, Knight (we know that the Bishop had a brother William), performing military service due from the Bishop of Bath and Wells, is on the RoU of those who were summoned to muster at Rhuddlan on August 2, 1282, against Lewellyn.26 His compliance and his fate are obvious. Ao-ain, King Edward I, being at this very Rhuddlan on Novem ber 10 1282, issued writs of Diem clausit extremum, announcing 23 Rot. Hundred.

The Inquests, hereupon returned, mention certain estates held by the deceased under Sir Robert BurneU, who also was next heir to the deceased, as regarded these particular estates. Here then we have the name of a third brother of the Chancellor, though the Inquest does not declare the relationship. We have also proof that Philip Burnel died without issue. Lastly, we see that the statement, which makes Sir Hugh Burnel to have been elder brother of the Chancellor,27 is probably erroneous, for had it been so, Sir Hugh, who was still living, would have been next heb: to Philip. I refer elsewhere for indications that the King himself was the Guest of his ChanceUor at Acton Burnell in October 1283, also for some particulars of the Parliament which was assembled at Acton BurneU at this period.28 The Statute De Mercatoribus, otherwise known as the \" Statute of Acton Burnell,\" was enacted in this Parliament. Its object was to faciUtate the recovery of debts. It has been highly commended for its wisdom and justice. It was probably devised by the Chancellor himself; and it is very remark able that the first person of mark who is known to have expe rienced its stringency was PhUip Burnel, the ChanceUor's own Nephew and spendthrift heir. A Patent of January 28, 1284, allows that \" Robert, Bishop of Bath and WeUs, our Chancellor, may, he or his heirs, strengthen with a wall of stone and lime, and also embattle then- mansion of Acton BurneU.\"29 A Patent of Edward I, tested at Caernarvon, July 15, 1284, is an interesting document. The King professes himself to have been \" long observant, as in gratitude bound, of the affection which the Venerable Father, Robert, Bishop of Bath and Wells, entertained, and was still entertaining towards his native place (natale solum) of Acton Burnel, whence he derived his origin, and towards the people of those parts.\" The King recites a previous license which he had given to the Bishop to take building-timber from the demesne hayes and boses of Salop for the purpose of constructing his Manor House there. The King now admonishes his Justices and other Officers of the Forest not to annoy the Bishop, his heirs, or his men, in respect of the said license. Another Patent of the same date29 shows that the Bosc of Frodesley and BurneU's own Bosc 27 Lord Campbell's Lives of the Chan cellors, Vol. I, p. 163. 28 History of Shrewsbury, I, 149-152. 29 Patent, 12 Edw.

The prescriptive right to be summoned did of course lead in several instances to a formal Summons, but it is clear that such Summons did not create the Barony. The two points alluded to are these. \u2014 1. The Burnels were recognized as Barons, because of then- Tenure of Castle Holgate, not by descent from Mauduit of Warminster, who lost the dignity as soon as he alienated Castle Holgate to the King of Almagne. 2. Maud Burnel and her second husband were legally enabled to settlo Castle Holgate on her younger son, Nicholas Burnel, to the exclusion of her elder son, John Lovel. The Barony followed the estate, wliich it could not have done unless it had been a Barony by Tenure. BURNEL OF CASTLE HOLGATE AND ACTON BURN ELL. Baeoniai.

The King now par dons the said waste, and restores the said Boses to the Chancellor. This great man died at Berwick-upon-Tweed on October 25, 1292, whilst attending his Sovereign on his Scottish affairs.30 His body was sent to Wells for burial, and he was interred in the nave of that Cathedral on November 23rd. At the time of Bishop BurneU's death, the Justices in Eyre were holding Assizes at Shrewsbury, where they had commenced business on October 6th. Their pro ceedings show, not only that BurneU's decease was fully known, but that his heir was already recognized in the person of Philip Burnel his Nephew. The latter was actually questioned at these Assizes, as Lord of Acton Burnell, Acton Pigot, and Allecot, for the with drawal of those Vills from their suit of Condover Hundred, a with drawal here alleged to have taken place seventeen years before. He was also questioned for exercising free warren in Acton Burnell, Acton Pigot, and Cound, also for holding two Great annual Courts at Cound, and assizing bread and beer in Acton Burnell and Cound ; also for weyf in Cound, and for tumberell, and pillory, and a Market on Sundays, at Acton Burnell. His general plea to these questions was that the estates were in the King's hand by reason of Bishop BurneU's death, a plea which, as regarded Cound, seems to me to have been unfounded in fact. The Inquisition taken December 10, 1292, as to the estates of Robert Burnell deceased, notifies his Tenure of Acton Burnell under Sir Peter Corbet by service of half a knight's-fee. The Capital messuage there, with its garden, curtilage, moat, barns, etc., was valued at the unusual sum of 40s. per annum over and above the cost of its maintenance. Four carucates of land, held in demesne, were worth \u00a38. ; two acres of meadow were worth 4*. ; three Vivaries were worth 20s.; a Water-Mill was worth \u00a32. 13s. 4d.; the Park was valued at \u00a31. 6s. 8d. ; two dove-cotes at 5*.; and the assized rents of free-tenants and Burgesses realized \u00a35. 2s. 2\\d. per annum.31 Besides the great estates which this Inquest shows Burnel to have acquired, there is one entry which proves that the minutest gains of Shropshire territory had not been above his notice. He had bought up a number of rents, due to the Crown from assarted lands, scattered about the County. These Rents amounted to 30 F\u0153dera, I, 762. 31 Inquisitions, 21 Edward I, No. 50."], [588, "136 ACTON BURNELL. \u00a32. 13s. 2\\d., and a sore sparrow-hawk ,- and Burnel had given the King, in lieu thereof, rents of \u00a32. 13s. 4d. and other services due from Christiana de Marisco, his Tenant at Bastyngdene in Berkshire. The Inquest taken July 26, 1294, on the death of Philip Burnel, the Bishop's Nephew and Heir, states his tenure of Acton Burnell under Sir Peter Corbet to have been by service of one knight in time of war.32 The Church, which was also in his Patronage, was valued at 10 merks per annum.32 It appears from a later Inqui sition (August 14, 1294), that Acton Burnell was one of those Manors half of which had been given up, previous to Philip's death, to certain foreign Merchants, in liquidation of enormous debts. These estates were consequently restored to the said Merchants by the Crown, immediately that their mortgaged state was fairly ascertained. An Inquest taken Feb. 10, 1301, under Writ of Certiorari, as to the then condition of the Burnel estates, shows that Acton Burnel was in the. hands of Walter de Beauchamp, pending Edward Bur nel's minority. The estate is described as 47 Burgages in the Vdl of Acton Burnel, from which we may presume that the Chancellor had aimed at the foundation of a flourishing market-town, rather than an imposing feudal residence. We have already seen how the same great Statesman allowed Castle Holgate, the caput of his Barony, to become valueless 'as a residence.33 From such indica tions we gain some knowledge of the social and political feelings of one whose master-mind not only discerned the advent of a new \u00e6ra for England, but in a great measure directed and governed the elements of change. The Inquest on Edward Burnel's death, taken October 25, 1315, states him to have held Acton Burnel of Peter Corbet at a fourth part of a knight's-fee. The Manor was now valued at \u00a38. 19s. per annum.3* It seems to have formed part of the dower of his Widow, Alyna, who was returned as Lady of the Manor in the fol- lowing year.36 Of Undertenants in Acton Burnell I have the following notices. In November 1221 John de Harley sued William de Harley for disseizing him of a tenement here, but he was nonsuited on its being shown that his seizin was not in fee, but only as a Mort gagee (non habuit terram nisi in vadio) . 32 Inquis., 22 Edw.

Of Robert de Acton, Clerk, son of Robert de Leye, I have spoken fully under Ragdon,36 and incidentally a few pages back. He was resident at Acton Burnell, and was perhaps Incumbent of the Church. His assessment for Forest land, as noticed under Ragdon, still held good in 1253. Meantime (in 1250) Geoffrey de Langley had further assessed him with 2s. 3d. per annum, chargeable on three acres in Acton, and with ll|d. per annum, chargeable on an acre and a rood in Frodesley. At the Assizes of 1256 Robert de Acton was party, under three different names, to as many Law suits. As Robert de Acton, he was found to have 'unjustly erected a stank in Acton, thereby injuring Hugh de. Byriton' s tenement in that Vill.37 As Robert le Clere, he acknowledged himself to have disseized Hugh de Bynton, or Burton (probably the same Plaintiff), of four acres in Acton. He at first called Roger Burnel to war ranty in this case, but to no purpose.37 Again, as Robert son of Robert de Legh, he abandoned a suit of novel disseizin, which he had concerning a tenement in Acton against Thomas Corbet and Reginald de Eyton. His Sureties, de prosequendo, were Richard son of Richard de Bascherch, Robert de Cherleton, and William son of Robert de Acton.37 I shall again have to notice this Robert de Acton as an injurious if not a sacrilegious Priest. A moral taint was probably left on his character by his exercise of the office of Under-Sheriff. We may safely assume that the last of the above named Sureties was his son. The said son was perhaps identical with William Clerk of Acton Burnell, a Juror on a local Inquest in July 1280, and with William de Acton Burnell, Juror on a similar Inquest in December, 1303. Meantime, I find Walter Burnel of Acton amerced as a Surety in 1262 ; and the Assize-Roll of 1272 tells us of John the Chaplain of Rukesley, Roger le Keu, and Avota his daughter, having disseized Robert le Keu, bailiff of Pymley, of a messuage in Acton Burnell.38 Fulwood. \u2014 This member of Acton Burnell seems to have arisen by a clearance in the Forest, effected (as we may presume from a hint already given) between the years 1220 and 1231 by William Burnell. Such a clearance was, if I mistake not, sometimes called a trench (trenched). William Burnell seems to have enfeoffed one Reginald de Lega in the whole or part of this assart ; and in turn we have a Charter, whereby \" Reginald de Lega grants to Peter fitz Warin a noke of land in the Trench of Fulewode, which noke was 36 Supra, Vol. V, pp. 118, 119. 37 Assizes, 40 Hen.

He also sat on local Juries in April 1264 and December 1273. In November 1274 William de Folewode was one of the Jurors who made Inquest for the Hundred. He occurs also on a local Jury in 1283. ACTON BURNELL CHURCH. I have already hinted my conviction that this Church was ori ginally a Chapel. Condover and Cound were the Mother Churches of the district. I should suppose Acton Burnell to have been an affiliation of Cound. In 1291 this Church was valued at only \u00a32. per annum.40 In 1341 the Assessors of the Ninth describe the Parish of Acton Burnel (most correctly, as I believe,) as a Chapelry. They assessed it at 24s. to the current tax, which sum was exclusive of other 24s., the value of the small tithes, oblata, and profits of the Church. The previous Taxation of \u00a32. is not alluded to in this assessment, but it would seem that the non-cultivation of a great part of the Parish was considered.41 The Valor of 1534-5 places the Rectory of Acton Burnell in the Deanery and Archdeaconry of Salop. The gross income of Edmund Lymney, as Rector, was \u00a37., which sum was chargeable with 10s. ld. for procurations and synodals.42 EARLY INCUMBENTS. Robert de Acton, Clerk, as I have already suggested, may have been Incumbent here. He occurs from 1227 to 1272. Thomas, Parson of Acton Burnell, the next Incumbent whom I can name, was deceased between 1286 and 1288. The Condover Jurors of 1292 remembered how he had fought with Wilham Petyt, a Chaplain, and been killed. The Chaplain had since died in Shrews bury Castle, having been imprisoned there during the Shrievalty of Leonius de Romesley.43 39 Harleian MSS. 1396, so. 253. 40 Pope Nich.

I must, however, first discuss its Domesday status. \u2014 \" Toret holds Languelege of the Earl. Suain held it (in Saxon times) , and was free. Here is half a hide, geldable. The arable land is sufficient for one ox-team. Here that team is, together with mi Serfs. The former and present value of the Manor was and is 5s. (per annum).\"1 Of Toret the Saxon I have spoken under Willey, Norton,2 Ber rington, and Eaton Mascott. In Saxon times he had held six Shrop shire Manors. Three of these he retained at Domesday ,- three he had wholly lost, unless a part of Berrington was still his, a matter which Domesday does not settle. In Langley we have a Manor in which Toret had no antecedent interest, but which had perhaps been given him by the Earl in qualification of his losses. Toret had therefore four Manors at Domesday, but it is probable that, soon after Domes day, he was removed from these, and had other estates in lieu thereof. Nothing, at all events, in these four Manors can be traced to his descendants, the Corbets of Wattlesborough. Langley, under such circumstances, will have reverted to the Suzerain, whether Earl- Palatine, or King. In turn, it was made a Tenure by Serjeantry, and bestowed, probably by Henry I or Henry II, on an ancestor of the Burnels. The Serjeantry, by which the Burnels held Langley, was apparently as follows : \u2014 \" Every year the Lord of Langley was to convey a Goshawk from the gate of Shrewsbury Castle to Stepney in Essex.\" Who provided the bird we are not told, but it was evidently to go to Stepney for the King's use whilst sojourning at the Royal Palace of Havering. The first3 statement of this service is in a Roll of Shropshire Serjeantries drawn up about the year 1211, and therefore in the time of William Burnel (II). Willielmus Burnel, says the Record, tenet per serjantiam et debet de servicio ferre unum austrucum apud Stubbinges in Essex ad custum Domini 1 Domesday, so. 259, b, 1. 2 Supra, Vol. II. pp. 49, 305. John. The assessment was doubtless on his Serjeantry, though the Pipe-Roll (6 John, Salop) does not enter on such par ticulars. 3 William Burnel was assessed half a merk in 1204 to the fifth Scutage of King"], [595, "141 LANGLEY. Regis.* A Record of the year 1227, when William Burnel (III) was living, adds the locality and value of the tenure : \u2014 Willielmus Burnel tenet villam de Lange/eg de Domino Rege per servicium portandi unum aucipitem ad custum Domini Regis, et valet per annum II marcas. Robert Passelewe's arrentation of Serjeantrics (made about March 1247) describes this one as Serjantia Willielmi Burnel in Langele, pro qud debuit deferre unum austurcum a porta Castri de Salobir' usque Stebbing in Essex quolibet anno ad custum proprium;6 where the expense of the journey is not, as previously, charged on the King, but on the Tenant. Passelewe found that many alienations had been made of this Serjeantry. There were fourteen different feoff ments therein, the collective values of which amounted to 66s. per annum ; the quantity of land alienated was summed as 2 virgates, 7 bovates, and 36| acres, besides a Mill.6 Burnel compounded for these illegal transactions, in the same way as has already been de scribed under Little Sutton.7 The Tenants agreed, each to pay Burnel an annual sum equal to one-third of the annual value of his tenement. The sum of 22s. thus annually arising was to be handed over to the Crown, in composition of the illegal alienations. As to the residue, not alienated, the Service due thereon was commuted from a Serjeantry to a simple Military tenure-in-capite by service of one-third of a Knight's-fee. I have noticed the succession of William Burnel (IV) in October 1247, and his outlawry in 1248. Nevertheless, the Pipe-Roll of 1250 recites the Fine or arrentation set on Langley, with a little variation from Passelewe's Roll, and charges 3^ years' arrears of the annual rent against the name of William Burnel.8 With still greater inaccuracy, the Pipe-Rolls of 1254 and 1260 charge one merk to the Aid for knighting Prince Edward, and one merk for the Scutage of Wales, as due on one-third of a fee held by William Burnel. Meantime the actual history of this escheated estate was as follows : \u2014 An Inquest, ordered by writ of April 17, 1249, found that the Outlaw had held two-thirds of a carucate at Langley in demesne; that the remaining third was still held by Rose his Mother ; that the gross value of the Manor was \u00a38.

The King then gave them to Elyas de Etingeham, for the term of his life ; but on December 28, 1250, Elyas de Ekyngham (as he is in this instance called) was deceased. Accordingly, the King issued an order to his Escheators to seize the land which the deceased had held de ballio Regis in Langley, and to cultivate the same, answer- ing for the proceeds at the Exchequer.10 On October 16, 1251, the King had granted (concesserat) the land of William Burnel the Outlaw to William de Gardinis. The King now further ex- cused William de Gardinis all that pertained to the King, of all manner of debts of the said William Burnel.10 Hence it was, I suppose, that, as I have before related, the present Grantee had the very chattels ofthe Outlaw. The King's first grant to William de Gardinis seems to have been less than absolute, for I find a Writ of March 16, 1253, ordering inquiry to be made by Inquest, as to whether William Burnel's land was an Escheat in such sort as that the King might give it (dare). The Jury returned an answer in the affirmative, estimating William Burnel's estate as one carucate in Langelee, one bosc, three parcels (particlas) of land, assized rents of \u00a34. 19s. 8d. in Langley and Hothalles, and the Advowson of the Chapel of Rocle (Ruckley) , which Chapel was worth 5 merks yearly. All this the said WiUiam was said to have held of the King at a rent of 22s., and by service of one foot-soldier.11 In this same year (1253) I find the King presenting \u00a310. to William de Gardinis through the Sheriff of Shropshire, whilst a Patent intimates that he was serving the King in Gascony, and gives him the protection usual on such occasions. In 1255 the tenure of William de Gardinis seems to have been absolute. \"William de Bardinis,\" said the Jurors of Condover Hundred, \" holds Longeley, for half a hide, of the King, rendering to the King 20s. per annum. And it was a Serjeantry in ancient time. And the Abbot of Buldewas holds 2 acres of the same Serjeantry, alienated by William Burnel, former Lord of the Ser jeantry. Also Sir Hugh de Lega holds Scales (perhaps Hothales was meant) of the same Serjeantry, and pays 8s. per annum to the aforesaid William (de Gardinis).\"12 These two grants to the Abbot of Buildwas and to Sir Hugh de Lega were not enumerated in the arrentation of 1247. I assume therefore that they were made 19 Fines, Vol. II, pp. 94, 118. 12 Rot. Hundred. II, 62. 11 Inquisitions, 37 Hen.

On August 3, 1256, King Henry III, being at Ledbury, grants five years' respite of knighthood to Wil liam de Gardinis. On July 30, 1259, William, son of William de Legh, has a Writ of mort d'ancestre against William de Gardinis concerning a tenement in Langley. On April 10th and 22nd, 1264, a Writ of Diem clausit issued, and an Inquest was held, on the death of WUliam de Gardinis. His tenure-in-capite of a carucate, etc., in Langeleg is stated, as we should have expected. His son and heir, WiUiam, was now 30 years of age and upwards.13 Before October 1266 William de Gardinis (II) sold Langley to Robert Burnell. The Patent of that date, quoted under Acton BurneU, presupposes such a sale, for it goes on specifically to remit the 20s. payable to the Crown by the said Robert for the Serjeantry of Langel'. In 1269 a Charter, which I shaU quote under Hawks ley, styles Robert Burnell \" Lord of Langley.\" Within the next two years, .Robert BurneU granted Langley to Richard Burnel, whom one Record calls his Nephew (nepos) . Hence in Easter Term 1271 we have several notices of a Suit then pending. \u2014 First, \"Richard le Bryth essoigns himself in a plea of land against Richard Bur neU.\" Then we have evidence that Richard le Brythe was also called Richard de Eton, and was a Feoffee of William de Gardinis ; for, \"a day, in one month of Easter, is given to Richard Burnel (Plaintiff) and to William de Gardino, whom Richard, son of Richard de Eton and Laurencia his wife, had called to warranty in a plea of land.\" A further adjournment of this cause merely specifies the land in dispute to be 20 acres in Stokeleye. In 1272 we have Richard Burnel \"of Langley\" attesting a Longnor Deed, and, as we have seen, Robert Burnel had withdrawn the Suit of Langley from Condover Hundred six years before. Among the Inquisitions of 1 Edward I, is a representation or petition by Robert Burnell, stating how he himself, having held Langley, had given it for life to Richard Burnel his kinsman (cognato suo), and how the Escheator finding that the wood of Harlithe, though held by the Templars, belonged to Langley, had given the said Richard seizin thereof: further, how the Templars had now ejected Richard. Robert Burnel therefore prays that the wood may be seized in manu Regis, till Inquisition should be had on the matter.14 A Writ of January 26, 1273, orders the Sheriff to inquire if the Bosc of Thuleshey, which the Escheator had first 13 Inquisitions, 48 Hen.

If it was, the Sheriff was to deliver it to the said Richard. Another Writ of December 16, 1273, recites a complaint, made by Richard Burnel himself (viz. that the Preceptor of Lydley had ejected him from the said Bosc) and orders an Inquest to be held on the mat ter. The said Inquest sat on Feb. 1, 1274, and found that the Bosc of TywleshayhelongeA to Langley Manor, but that the Preceptor of Lyd ley had had seizin thereof from old time, by what title the Jurors knew not.15 The Condover Hundred- Roll of 127416 recites how Langley had escheated from the Outlaw Burnel to Henry III, how the King had given it to William de Gardinis, how it had been sold to Robert Burnel, and given by him to Richard Burnel his nephew (nepoti suo) .17 This grant, as we have seen, was only for life ; but on January 27, 1276, a Fine, purporting to be the result of a suit of warranty, shows Robert Burnell, now Bishop of Bath and Wells, granting the Manor of Langley and the Chapel of Rokleye to Richard Burnel and the heirs of his body, to hold, under the Bishop and his heirs, by one fourth of a knight's-fee. In default of Richard's heirs aforesaid, the premises were to revert to the Bishop and his heirs. A sore sparrow-hawk, the usual fiction of the great Chancellor's Fines, was said to have been the consideration. A memorandum on the Pipe- Roll of 1277 states that Robert Burnell had held the lands of William Burnel, and that the King had pardoned the alienation. Another memorandum, appearing upon this same Roll, intimates that no Scutages were hereafter to be as sessed on Langley, for that the Knight's service (\u00a3 of a fee) due thereon was included in Robert BurnePs Ferms of Serjeantries and Assart-Rents. At the Assizes of 1292 Richard Burnel's tenure of 50 solidates of land in Longeleye, was returned by the Condover Jurors as a Ser jeantry, and the old service duly recited.

So if Ro bert Burnel had been really the Uncle of these two brothers, he would have been brother of that William Burnel who died in 1247. But we know, on the contrary, that Robert Burnel was brother of a WilUam Burnel who was living in 1270, On the whole, I believe that the precise relationship between the Bishop and the Outlaw was studiously concealed in co eval documents; and I doubt whether any Antiquary of the nineteenth century will be able to discover what Chancellor Burnell chose to hush up in the thir teenth."], [599, "145 LANGLEY. pelled to fine half a merk that he might retain the estate till the next Parliament. Hugh de Louther however sued him under Quo Waranto for the Manor. Hereupon Richard Burnel recited his un exceptionable title, as already set forth, and was dismissed sine die1% A Patent of July 10, 1297, shows how soon the plans, if not the rights of Robert Burnell, deceased, were put in question. It recites how \" Langley Manor and Ruckley Advowson had recently been seized into the King's hands, because Robert Burnel, who had held them in capite of Henry Til, had alienated them to Richard Burnel, and changed the Serjeantry into a Tenure by Knight's service, with out license \" (which was not the fact) . It allows however, seeing that Richard Burnel was about to cross the seas with the King, that he should have the Manor, etc., to hold to him and his heirs, in capite, of the King, by service of a fourth part of a Knight's fee ; saving the rights of any other person. There can be little doubt that this transaction was a violation of the rights of young Edward Burnel, the Mesne-Lord of Langley, perpetrated by his guardian, the King of England. Nevertheless Gunceline de Badlesmere, among other lands of Edward BurneU committed to his custody, is stated to have had something in Langelee, to which the inquiry of 1302, already mentioned,19 extended. Subsequent to this, the in terest of the Baronial Une of Burnels vanishes altogether. An Inquest ordered on September 24, and taken October 5, 1313, on the death of Richard Burnel of Langley, states him to have held the hamlet of Langley in capite by service of one-fourth part of a knight's fee. William, his son and heir, was now thirty-two years of age.20 Hence, in the Nomina Villarum of 1316, we find William Burnel enrolled as Lord of Longeleye.31 I will not follow this sub ject further than to the death of William Burnel, which is announced by a Writ of Diem clausit, dated January 20, 1331, and the return to which, dated February 12, stated that his son and heir, WiUiam, was sixteen years of age on August 15, 1330.22 Of Undertenants in Langley, I shall first mention two who were assessed for imbladements in the Forest-Iter of 1180.

Philip recovered the same, after repeated defaults made by the Defendant.28 In 1262 Robert, Miller of Langley, was assessed under Regard of the Long Forest.

This, like Acton Burnell, was, I presume, au affiliation of the Church of Cound. The Taxation of 1291 takes no notice of Ruck ley Chapel, but in 1341 the Parish of Rokeley was assessed to the Ninth at 16s. This was exclusive of 24s., the value of the small tithes, Oblata, and other profits of the Church. The non-cultivation of a great part of the Parish was also taken into consideration by the assessors.29 The Valor of Henry VIII is silent about this Cha pelry. It is probable that the Chapel now existent at Langley was a mere transfer of that which was formerly at Ruckley. I find the foUowing names of a few early Incumbents of Ruck ley :\u2014 John, Chaplain of Ruckley, who occurs in 1272, was perhaps only a Deputy. On October 31, 131 1\u2014 Ivo, Rector of this Chapel, died, and on November 23 fol lowing \u2014 Robert de Longeley, Clerk, was instituted at presentation of Richard Burnel, Lord of Longeley.30 He died Aug. 5, 1349,31 and on September 14 following \u2014 Roger Wyttingeslowe,' Chaplain, was admitted at presentation of Edward BurneU.32 Roger, Rector of this Chapel in 1382, may be identical with the last, or with \u2014 Roger le Knith, who occurs as Rector in 1384-5.33 I offer a statistical illustration of his remark.

At Domesday, Teodulf held Avochelie of the Earl. Elric had held it (in Saxon times), and was a free man. Here was half a hide, geldable. \" It was and is waste (says the Record) .

Teodulf was probably a Saxon, and soon displaced. He held a part of Pulley in this Hundred, which part became a tenure in capite by Serjeantry. Hawksley seems to have been granted to Shrewsbury Abbey, but whether by Earl or King we know not, for the Chartulary of that House does not recite or even allege the original grant. The Burnels occur in the first instance as Custodes, under Shrewsbury Abbey, of Hawks ley. The following acknowledgment by Thomas Burnel of such a trust must date about the year 1194. \" Thomas Burnel restores to St. Peter a certain wood (nemus) of the Monks of Salop, viz. Hauekelega, which he had held under the Monks as Custos, with all its assarts and appurtenances. And concerning an assart in the field of Robert (a tenant I suppose) , it was thus settled, viz. that he (Robert) should hold it for his life, without right hereditary, under the aforesaid Monks, rendering therefore to the Monks the same service annually as he had been used to render to the Declarant.

His Essoignor was Oliver Cocus or Costard.3 I do not know that this suit related to Hawksley, but it probably indicates the exact year when William Burnel succeeded his Brother. The foUowing Fine, levied at Westminster on May 7, 1197, is a curious piece of evidence. It purports to be between Hugh, Abbot of Salopesburi, and his Convent (Plaintiffs), and William Burnel (Tenant), of aU that land, with its appurtenances in Hauchelee, whereof was Plea between the parties in the Curia Regis. The Abbot and Convent now conceded the aforesaid land to WiUiam Burnel, \u2014 to hold to him and his heirs, under, the Abbot and his Successors, by the free service of 6s. per annum, payable at Lady Day and Michaelmas. And the aforesaid William quit-claimed to the Abbot aU those demands which his Ancestors used to make upon the Abbey. These demands were, two measures (summ\u00e6) of corn (bladi), \u2014 one wheat (frumenti), the other fine wheat (siliginis); and one boce(?), and two cheeses. Moreover, William and his heirs conceded to the Abbot reasonable easements for his demesne houses at Branton (Brompton), Emistre (Emstrey), and Berton (probably Betton), under view of William's Forester, in the wood of Hauchelee. Between the years 1213 and 1218 Hugh, Abbot of Shrewsbury, assigns to the Brethren of his Convent certain annual rents for their fuller refection on the day of his anniversary. Among the rents so assigned was that one of 6s. from Hauechelega which we just now saw secured by Abbot Hugh himself.4 The following Charter I am inclined to attribute to William Burnel IV (the Outlaw). If so, its date is unquestionably the year 1248, when the Shrievalty of Shropshire passed from the first to the second witness. \u2014 \" William Burnel, son of WiUiam Burnel, concedes to Shrewsbury Abbey in his wood of Longeleg the same easements as the Abbey was entitled to have in the wood of Hauecheleg, ac cording as they (the easements) were contained in a Cyrograph of the Lord King (i.e. a Fine levied in the King's Court), made be tween the Abbot and the ancestors of the present Grantor, con cerning the said wood of Hauecheleg.

Ill (1248-9) a Suit, before alluded to, was pending between the Abbot of Shrewsbury and WiUiam Burnell, but was stopped by the Outlawry of the latter. The Abbot was suing Burnel, not about easements, but to oblige him generally \" to observe the Fine made between Abbot Hugh and the present De fendant's Grandfather (avum) concerning 6 solidates in Hawell.\"6 Seven years after this, viz. at the Assizes of January 1256, it was ascertained by Jury that William Burnel, at the time of his Out lawry, was holding 50 acres in Rode (Hawksley was meant) under the Abbot of Shrewsbury ; \u2014 that the King had then held the premises for a year and a day, but that, on the expiration of that term, the Abbot failed to obtain his reversionary right from the King (non perquisivit sibi versus Dominum Regem). The reason of this was, that, at the moment, \" there was no certain Abbot of Shrewsbury ;\" for there was a contention between the Abbot who eventually sat, and was in office in 1256, and a certain other person whom the Bishop of Chester had appointed Abbot.7 When therefore, after the expiration of the King's year and day, the King gave the lands of the Outlaw in Langley, Ruckley, and Hothal, to Elyas de Etingeham for life, this land of the Abbot's was included in the grant, because still the Abbot was not asserting his right. But after the death of Elyas de Etingeham (which we know to have taken place about December 1250), all these lands reverted to the Crown. Then at last the Abbot petitioned the King for restitution. He obtained it, and held this 5 Salop Chartulary, No. 156. Diocesan Bishop. Adam (III) sat but a short time, if at all, for on August 19, 1250, another Patent, similarly addressed, assents to the election of William, Sub- Prior of Coventry, as Abbot of Shrews bury. It may be doubted whether this William sat at all ; and I think it probable that the Bishop of Chester was resisting the exigency of both these writs addressed to him, and was favouring a third Claimant. His Nominee I take to be that unnamed Abbot whom the Annals of Tewkesbury tell us to have been de posed in 1251 by concurrent sentences of the King and the Pope.

But when (in October 1251) the King granted the Outlaw's lands to William de Gardinis, the latter, presuming that this monastic estate was included in the Grant, ejected the Abbot. Thus things continued till the Assizes of January 1256, when the Abbot brought his action of disseizin against AVilliam dc Gardinis for 50 acres in Rode ; Sibil, the Defendant's wife, appeared on his behalf and showed the Outlawry of Burnel, the escheat to the Crown, and the feoffment of WiUiam de Gardinis by the King in Langel', Roclegh, and Hothal. The Abbot rejoined, and showed how the 50 acres in question were held under himself, how the King had had the land for a year and a day, and how he (the Abbot) sub sequently obtained the King's order to R. de Grendon, then Sheriff (he was in office from Easter 1250 to Michaelmas 1255), to restore the said 50 acres to the Abbey. The Abbot further showed his own seizin for half a year, and the King's feoffment of William de Gar dinis, the present defendant. The Jury's finding, I have already detailed. Its accuracy, as tested by other evidences, is very remarkable ; and, in accordance therewith, the Abbot recovered his estate.8 We next see Robert BurneU obtaining a grant in fee-farm of this third estate of his family. In the year 1269 WiUiam, Abbot of Shrewsbury, demises for ever to Robert Burnel, Lord of Longeleye, the culture called Hauckeleye, situate between the said Robert's vill of Rokeleye, and his Manor of Longeleye ; \u2014 to hold in fee-farm, at an annual rent of 6s. 8d.

In this partition, whenever made, Woolstaston went to the share of BotereU. The second WUliam BotereU, being grandson, as I sup pose, of Robert fitz Corbet, became, about the year 1170, the third husband of Isabel de Say, Lady of Clun, whose former husbands, William fitz Alan and Geoffrey de Vere, died in 1160 and 1170. I have before alluded to two Charters which at the close of the twelfth century were expedited to Wenlock Priory by Isabel de Say, and by her third husband, William BotereU.2 The second witness of each Charter was Roger Anglicus, and he was no other than William Boterell's Feoffee at Woolstaston. It is quite clear that William BotereU married, in 1203\u20141, Al breda, daughter and coheir of Walter Waleran and widow of John de Ingeham ; but whether this WiUiam BotereU were the surviving husband of Isabel de Say, or the son of that husband, by Isabel de Say, I wiU not here discuss. Sure it is that William BotereU, the husband of Albreda Waleran, was deceased in June 1211, and that he left, apparently by Albreda, a son and heir, William, who was an infant, and who did not obtain livery till December 1220, at which period, if son of Albreda, he must have been stiU in minority. Albreda Waleran survived her second husband nearly sixty years, and had for a long time the Seigneury of Woolstaston as part of her dower. Meanwhile, that is before the year 1209, Roger Anglicus (I) died, leaving a son John, and a widow AmiUa. I think it clear from subsequent evidence that Amilia had the tenancy of Wools taston in dower. The Forest- Roll of March 1209 records a fine of 1 merk proffered by Amilia de Wolstaneston \" for a new assart, not made clandestinely,\" and for license to build a house thereon. 1 Domesday, so. 256, a, 1. | 2 Supra, Vol. II, p. 6."], [607, "153 WOOLSTASTON.

Albreda's lands in general were in the custody of John de Monemue, a still loyal subject, who had married CeciUa Waleran, sister to, and coheir with, Albreda. A precept of King John, dated at Oswestry (Album Monasterium) on August 7, 1216, orders the Sheriff of Shropshire to give \" John de Monemue seizin of the land in Wlstoneston which had lately belonged to Amilia widow of Roger Anglicus. She (Amilia) was with the King's enemies, and her land belonged to the fief of Albreda de BotereU, which fief was already in John de Monemue's custody.\"4 A Writ of King Henry III, dated November 3, 1217, certifies the Sheriff of Shropshire that John Anglicus and Amilia his Mother have returned to their allegiance, and are to have their lands restored.4 Subsequently to this I find reason to suppose that Amilia (whether as a dowager or the wife of a second husband) endeavoured to obliterate the title of her son John, and his only daughter Johanna, to Woolstaston. Amilia favoured a person who in this instance is called Roger Anglicus, though I think that we shaU hear of him elsewhere under a different name. His relationship to Amilia, or to her former hus band, I wiU not here speculate upon. Suffice it to say that he was not their son. In 1240, owing to these causes, we find that, under the \" Land of Aubreda de Botereus,\" Wlstaneston is entered as one-fifth of a knight's-fee held by Roger Anglicus.5 In Michaelmas Term 1251 I find Johanna, daughter and heir of John le Engleis, and now wife of Robert de Grendon, moving the Courts of Westminster for recovery of her inheritance. She and her husband made use of the process termed De Ingressu ; \u2014 and the case is one which very pertinently shows the distinction porary Rolls (pp. 48, 50) give Wlstanes ton as \\ fee held by Roger Anglicus, but it is erroneously placed under the Barony of Hugh de Kilpec. 3 Haughmond Chartulary : Tit.

In fact, no disseizin had taken place, because the Plaintiff had never been seized, and the writ of mort d'ancestre was probably a hazardous expedient, seeing that the last of Johanna's ancestors who had held Woolstaston was her Grandfather, who had died more than 40 years before. After this explanation I proceed to show the Writ De ingressu in operation. \u2014 \" Robert de Grendon and Johanna his wife seek against Roger le Engleys, the Manor of Wullaveston (except two virgates), and against Richard le Engleys they seek one virgate in the same, as the right of Johanua, into which premises Roger and Richard have no ingress save through Amilia widow of Roger le Engleys (I), which Amilia held the same in dower by grant of John le Engleys (her son I presume), the father of Johanna the present Plaintiff, and whose heir she (the Plaintiff) is.\" In reply, Roger le Engleys (II) admitted that he had had ingress through the said Amilia, but he denied that Amilia had the premises in dower as aforesaid, for that they were a gift in frank-marriage from WUUam de Wytenton (probably Amilia's father), given with the said AmUia to Roger le Engleys (I) sometime her husband. Richard le Engleys, the other Defendant, denied that he had ingress by Amilia at all. In fact, he was the Feoffee of Roger le Engleys (II). Both Defendants appealed to a Jury, and the cause was adjourned to the Quinzaine of Hilary 1252. But there was still another virgate in Woolstaston not included in the above Suit. This was held, haU by Richard le Engleys and half by WiUiam de Willaveston, whom the Plaintiffs sued as having no ingress save by Roger le Engleys (II), grantee of Amilia, who had the virgate in dower, etc. (as before) .

William de Willaveston admitted that Roger le Engleys (II) was his Feoffor, and caUed him to warranty. The cause was adjourned like the last.6 I again catch a glimpse of this suit on the Plea- Roll of Michael mas Term 1253, when, on October 6, the Plaintiff Johanna, here called Johanna de Berkele, names au Attorney in her suits against Roger and Richard le Engleys and William de Wulstaneston.7 The result may be learnt from a Fine, dated a week later in the same Term.

Johanna also covenanted to give Roger a life annuity of \u00a310. She also allowed common-pasture and other privileges. The premises, on the death of Cecilia, were to revert to Johanna. In 1254 the Pipe-Roll shows Roger Engleis as fining one merk to have some assize, and as amerced half a merk for a false plaint. In the year 1255 Roger le Engleys (II) was dead, and his widow, under the name of Cecilia de Wolverslawe, was guardian of his infant son, called Roger Waldin. However, Cecilia's share in Wool staston is not reckoned of in the Condover Hundred-Roll of the same year. Johanna de Berkeley, here called Dame Johanna le Engles, is said to hold Wolstaston, for n hides, of Sir William (it should be Reginald) de Botereus. The Manor paid 16d. for stret ward and motfee, and did suit to both County and Hundred.8 In Hilary Term 1272 we have notice of a suit, which shows that Johanna de Berkeley had married a second, or more probably a third, husband, viz. Simon de Keringewyk, and had since been suc ceeded at Woolstaston by Egidius de Berkeley, probably her son by her first husband. Also Richard le Engleys, above mentioned, and whom I know to have been a Brother of Roger le Engleys (II) , had died and been succeeded by a son John, still under age. However, the said John sued Egidius de Berkele for the Manor of Wul staneston, alleging that the said Egidius had no ingress therein, save through Simon de Keryngewyk, Johanna his wife, and Cecilia, widow of Roger le Engleys, who had concurred in disseizing Richard le Engleys, John's father. The suit was adjourned on Egidius de Berkeley showing the Plaintiff's nonage.9 In October following, the Justices-in-Eyre at Shrewsbury gave a day (the Quinzaine of St. Martin) to John, son of Richard le Engleis, Plaintiff in this suit, but the result does not appear. Within the next ten years the fee-simple of this Manor was acquired, probably purchased, by Robert Burnell, Bishop of Bath and Wells.

The (arable) land would employ 5 teams.\"1 The history of Womerton, meagre as it is, suggests the idea that the whole of Robert Corbet's Barony was not divided among his Coheirs. In fact I doubt whether any partition was attempted till after the death of his illegitimate grandson, Reginald, Earl of Corn wall. If this were so, and if his estates were for more than half a century at the arbitrary disposal of the Crown, it is not to be won dered at that a Manor like Womerton should have been annexed to the adjacent and Royal demesnes of Church Stretton. At all events we never hear of Womerton after Domesday, except as a mere appendage of Stretton, and even in that relation it appears rather as an afforested district, than an inhabited Vill. Thus, in 1232, we find Andrew de Wulstanestun (Woolstaston) assessed at 6d. for an imbladement of an acre of oats in Wymbritton.2 Again, in 1235, the Surveyors of the Shropshire Forests found that the Bosc of Wimbrinton had furnished timber for the repairs of the Castles of Shrewsbury and Stretton, and for the strengthening of Roger Sprenghose's mansion of Longnor.3 Lastly, in 1255, Henry de Helewynton (a Commissioner for the sale of timber in the Shrop shire Forests) got 6s. 8d. for windfalls in the bosc of Wimbriston.4 In the Perambulation of 1300, Womerton must be taken to have been one of those adjuncts of Church Stretton which were declared not to be disforested. Thus its distinctive state as a Manor was finally obliterated ; and the case is worth noting, because it is a rare thing, in Shropshire History, that a Domesday Manor can be thus shown to have vanished in the Forest.6 The scheme of wide depopulation which formed the New Forest in Hampshire, is an historical fact, paraUel in kind, though far greater in degree. &atlmc$ope* \" Rotel \" is the Saxon proper name from which the County of 1 Domesday, so. 256, a, 1. 4 Rot.

This Manor of Robert fitz Corbet is very briefly described in Domesday. \u2014 \" The same Robert holds Rotelingehope (of the Earl) . Seuuard held it (in Saxon times) . Here are n Hides. They are and were waste.\"1 A connected history is not to be expected of the wild, and at times unapproachable, district of which we are now to treat. Nevertheless the few facts which remain are not wanting in interest. In the reign of King Henry II we find Stitt, a member of Rat linghope, disposed of by the Crown in terms which I shall consider presently. Here I merely remark that the King does not notice any voice or interest, concurrent or otherwise, which the Coheirs of Robert fitz Corbet might have been expected to assert in the matter. Later evidences however show that the title of the said Coheirs was not wholly obliterated. As regards Ratlinghope itself, and Coates, another of its mem bers, we have no such early evidence. We know, or may reasonably infer, that before the year 1209 Ratlinghope and Coates had been acquired by Walter Corbet, an Augustine Canon, but, whether from the King or from the Coheirs of Robert fitz Corbet, we cannot teU. Walter Corbet's object was clearly a religious one, and it would seem that he was either the Agent of Wigmore Abbey in this transaction, or else that, finding himself unable to maintain an independent position, he placed himself and his acquisition under the patronage of that House. Hence Ratlinghope became a Priory or Cell of Wigmore Abbey. I have placed these events before the year 1209, because, at the Forest-Assize held in March of that year, the Abbot of Wigmore came before the Justices at Shrewsbury and fined 3 merks, that he might be unmolested in respect of certain assarts and purprestures which he had made at Rodelingehop and Cotes. This indicates a previous settlement of some duration, and that the district was within Regard of that wide-spread territory known as the Long Forest. From an almost unknown Charter, and in connection with this obscure locaUty, I now proceed to de duce facts not merely of genealogical importance, but of some political and personal interest. LeweUyn ap Jorwerth recovered the throne of North Wales in 1194 from his uncle David, the ally of the English. From that period till the death of Richard I, there was nothing but open war 1 Domesday, so. 256, a, 1."], [614, "160 RATLINGHOPE. between England and North Wales. But King John in the very first year of his reign began a series of treaties with the Welsh Prince, who became his Son-in-law in 1204. In short, the whole period from 1199 to May 1211 was unmarked by any open rupture between the King and the Prince, though the frequent notices which we have of conferences, complaints, trespasses, and truces, indicate no very cordial state of feeling. During this interval (1199-1211) we have an address or precept of LeweUyn which, as an official document, is undoubtedly genuine, and which, as far as it indicates his personal views and feelings, does him no small honour. In a few lines we find expressions which show the pa ternal solicitude of a Prince for his people, the social affection which he could not withhold even from his English kindred, and above all a strong sense of the responsibility which he owed to a Higher Power. It had been told to the Prince, that Ratlincope and Cotes, places consecrated to God and to pious uses, were so near to the land of Keri as to be exposed to the occasional raids and forays which agitated the Border. Now \" Brother Walter Corbet,\" who had acquired this estate with a pious design, was the Prince's relation and most familiar friend. The Prince loved him much for his religious and virtuous qualities, as well as because he was the brother of William Corbet, the Prince's own Uncle.2 In the cause, then, of kindred, friendship, and religion, the Prince addresses the Chieftains of North Wales, and all others resident there, whether personally known or strangers to himself. He promises them the best of his aid and counsel in all their wants and just requests. He shows them that it is their interest not less than his own, to foster and protect religion, its professors, and its shrines. He commands all whom his command can bind, that, as they love his per son and his honour, they will protect and assist Walter Corbet in his designs. He threatens, on the other haud, the loss of his friendship to any one who is disobedient to his wishes. Lastly, he addresses Madoc son of Mailgwn in particular, reminds him how he had brought him up and promoted him. He conjures him not to return evil for good, but to respect the Prince's Honour, as he, the Prince, 2 Frater Willielmi Corbet avunculi mei. So then, in all probability, the wife of Jorwerth Drwyn-dwn, and the mother of Lewellyn, was a Corbet, and not that \" Marred, daughter of Madoc ap Mere dyth, Prince of Powis,\" of whom we hear elsewhere. I observe that whenever then native Princes married Englishwomen, the Welsh Genealogists were not only care ful to suppress the fact, but have usually supplied its place by a fiction. I shall hereafter exhibit other instances of this."], [615, "RATLINGHOPE. 161 would thereafter consult for and succour the said Madoc.3 The persons to whom this letter was addressed should be enumerated, for one or two of them occur in far different relations. Besides Madoc ap Mailgwn and his brothers, there is Hoel ap Cadewathlon. Now this Madoc and this Hoel were two of the hostages given by LeweUyn to King John, probably when he submitted to his Father in-law in 1211 ; they were two also of those twenty-eight whom John so mercilessly executed, when he found himself unable to obtain other revenge for LeweUyn's renewed outbreak in 1212. So far, then, as the Chroniclers have represented the victims of John's cruelty to have been mere striplings,4 they hereby stand convicted of exaggeration. We have yet another notice of Madoc ap Maylgon and Howel ap Cad wathlon.\u2014 They claimed to hold the land of Melenyth under Roger de Mortimer of Wigmore. They fined heavily with King John to be aUowed a trial thereupon. This trial took place at Shrews bury, and the right of holding the district in his demesne was ad judged to Mortimer.6 Another person addressed by LeweUyn is Meredith, son of Robert. This was Meredyth ap Rotpert of Cydewen, one of the Chieftains famous for having seconded LeweUyn in his campaign of 1212. Again, Gervase and Meredith, sons of Heinoun Clut, Gervase, son of Meirioun, and Gervase Goch, with his son Meuric, and his other sons, are addressed by LeweUyn. Of a Gervase Goch, fatherof two sons, Madoc and Griffin, we have heard before.6 We may now ask whether Gervase was living in Wales long after his connection with England had ceased, and after Madoc and Griffin had succeeded him in his English office and estate ? In Meuric, his other son, we possibly have the Welsh successor of his Father ; but some further inquiries on this obscure subject I reserve for a more fitting occasion.7 I hear nothing more of the Manor of Ratlinghope till the year 1255, when the Jurors of Purslow Hundred represented one of Robert Corbet's Coheirs as still the Seigneural Lord. They knew not, however, the service by which the \" Abbot of Wigmore held half Reginald fitz Peter. The Manor did a hide in Rotelinghop under 3 Monasticon, VI. 496. 4 Powel, p. 193. died in 1133, that is, about seventy years before his son is thus addressed by Lewellyn.

At the Forest Assize of 1262 it was shown how Roger, Prior of Ratlinghop, had taken one ofthe King's deer on December 7, 1256, and how he was since dead. In September 1267, King Henry III, being at Shrewsbury, orders that the Canons of St. Mary of Rotelingehop shall have the chattels of one John de Cotes, who had been beheaded for a felony committed on the Long Mynd, which Chattels certain men of Rotelingehop had in keeping. The Taxationoi 1291, though it takes no notice of a Church at Rothelinghop, speaks of the place as a Cell of Wigmore, and particularizes the estate of its Prior. He had a carucate of land worth 10s. per annum ; assized rents, \u00a31. 6s. 8d. ; meadow and pasture land worth 6s. 8d. He received from Fines and perquisites, 8s. 8d. ; from a Water-Mill, 10s. His profits on live stock were, 6s. on four Cows, and 4s. on ten sheep. Total, \u00a33. 12s.9 The Valor of 1534-5 gives the rents and ferms receivable by Wigmore Abbey from Rollynghope as \u00a34. ; but the Ministers' Accounts of 1539-40 gives the rents and perquisites as .\u20ac4. 9s. 3lrd., and a Crown-grant of the confiscated Manor, dated 16 May, 1546, values it at \u00a35. 11s. 1 Ad. per annum10 RATLINGHOPE CHURCH. Ratlinghope must have belonged originally and parochially to Worthen or some other Saxon Parish of the district. The Church or Chapel was probably founded by Wigmore Abbey in connection with the Priory. No such Church is noticed in the Taxation of 1291. In 1341, however, the Parish of Rotlynghope was assessed as a distinct Parish, but the Assessors did not quote any previous Taxation of the Church. They rated the Parish at 20s. to the Ninth, and gave the poverty of the Tenants as the only reason for so low a charge.11 This Inquisition places Ratlinghope Church in the Deanery of Clun, and I take that to have been no arbitrary arrangement of the Com missioners. The Church is not mentioned in Henry VIII's Valor ; but at the present day it is reputed to be one of the Churches of Pontesbury Deanery. This is, I believe, a false allocation, though it is most rare to meet with an instance where an ecclesiastical boun dary has been thus obliterated. I account thus for the anomaly. \u2014 8 Rot.

From the time when a Church was built here by Wigmore Abbey to the time when Wigmore Abbey was dissolved, this district was in some sort extra-parochial and extra-diocesan.

Consistently with this idea we find the Bishops of Hereford never to have interfered at Ratlinghope, and never to have instituted an Incumbent till Fe bruary 15, 1555, when \u2014 Laurence Johnson, a Canon of the dissolved Abbey of Wig more, and already pensioned for life, was presented to this Rectory by Philip and Mary.

Henry II, in whose reign the Canons acquired Stitt, is probably the King alluded to, but I cannot think his Grant to have been anything more than a confirmation of some cotem porary gift, originated by the Coheirs of Robert fitz Corbet. This transfer evidently took place during the Episcopacy of Robert Foliot, Bishop of Hereford (consecrated October 6, 1174, died May 9, 1186), for to him we must attribute a Deed which recognizes the Canons as settled at Stutte. \u2014 \" Robert, Bishop of Hereford, gives to the augmentation of their sustenance all the tithes of the Vill of Stutte : and because by his Visitation it appeared that there was no Church there, he gave the Canons license to build a Church in the place where they already had an Oratory, in which Church there was to be a Baptistery, and Sepulture, and service performed once in every week.

The name of the Dean, indicated only by the initial letter G, was undoubtedly Geoffrey. This instrument confirms, inter alia, the little Church of Stutt (ecclesiam exilem de Stutta) with all its liberties and appurtenances. The Canons then had probably availed them selves of Bishop Foliot's license, and built a Church. There is a Deed of William de BotereU to Haughmond Abbey about Stitt, which must have passed between 1204 and 1210, and should therefore be taken as confirmatory of some previous grant or grants by the Coheirs of Robert fitz Corbet. He gives to the Canons, for the souls of his Father, Mother, and Ancestors, aU the moiety of Stutt, with its appurtenances, and with all such integrity as they had it in the time of Herbert fitz Herbert.13 Witnesses, \u2014 William fitz Alan, John le Strange, and Hugh Pantulf.14 In Hilary Term 1226, Peter fitz Herbert and the Abbot of Haughmond had a Plea of land pending. In Easter Term follow ing, this Plea was heard at Westminster. Peter fitz Herbert sued the Abbot for a Carucate in Stute, aUeging that Herbert, his father, had been seized thereof in Henry II's reign, and that the Abbot's Predecessor had only had the land of the bailiwick of the said Her bert. The Abbot appealed to a trial by Grand Assize, and offered the King one merk that the Writ, ordering such trial, should make mention of this particular issue, viz. \" Whether the said Herbert was ever seized of the said land in fee, or not.\" The case was thus adjourned for further hearing before the Justices-in-Eyre.15 Before I give any further account of this Abbatial estate, I must return to take notice of some other acquisitions of Haughmond Abbey, which, though not in Ratlinghope Manor, became indis solubly connected with Stitt. As early, I think, as the year 1175-6, King Henry II, being at Feckenham, addresses his Foresters and Bailiffs of Shropshire, and tells them that he has given to the Abbot of Haughmond the pasture of Longamenede (The Long Mynd) which is up above Stretton, to the end that the Abbot may there depasture his herds 13 Herbert fitz Herbert was the other Coheir of Robert fitz Corbet. He died about April 1204. liam fitz Alan, the first witness, was his half-brother, and Hugh Pantulf was the husband of his half-sister. 14 This Deed favours the idea that the William BotereU, who granted it, had lately succeeded.

Again, \" Robert Corbet gave the Canons his culture of Gateden (Gatten), for which he had received from the said Canons 6s. 8d. yearly. Witness, \u2014 Hugh Pantulf.\" Also, \" Robert Corbet gave them an assart, held by WUliam fitz Maie, and situate near their culture of Gatteden ; \u2014 this at a rent of 4d.

He had nothing in Ratlinghope proper, but his grants in Gatten were in fact parcels of his great Manor of Wentnor.17 The Taxation of 1291 values the income from the Abbot of Haughmond's estate in this neighbourhood as foUows : \u2014 \u00a3. s. d.

Again, we find Ernui, or Ernuin, to have been Saxon Lord of Pontesbury, Fairley, and Westbury, three Manors of Ruesset Hundred, but aU contiguous to Oaks. Lastly, there is something in the present status of Oaks which very strongly supports the probability that it 29 Valor Ecclesiasticus, III, 192.

It is the only township in the extensive Parish of Pontesbury, which is not in Ford Hundred. It continues to be in its presumed Domesday Hundred, viz. Con dover. That the Seigneury of Oaks remained with oue or other of Robert fitz Corbet's Coheirs, I cannot doubt, but I have no direct proof of the fact. The Feoffee of such Coheir was more surely that Robert de Girros, whom we have seen holding so largely under the Barons of Holgate in the time of Henry II, besides being a Tenant in capite at Claverley. I have quoted, under Longnor, a Deed of Henry II's time, where William de Botereaux is the first, and Ro bert de Girros the second witness.2 This induces me to think that Girros held Oaks under BotereU rather than under Fitz Herbert. I have noticed, under Claverley and elsewhere, the Escheat which in 1191 befeU the estates of Robert de Girros (I), and supposed that it was owing to his death and the minority of his heir.3 This Es cheat extended to Oaks. At Michaelmas, 1194, the King's Escheator accounts for 7s., the half-year's ferm of Robert de Girros' Manor of Akes. In 1195 the same Officer accounts for 7s. more, received from the same source. We conclude that Robert de Girros (I) had not held Oaks in demesne, but had enfeoffed some Tenant or Tenants there, who paid the above ferm. In September 1199, we hear of such a Feoffee, viz. WiUiam de Bikedon, who, being Tenant of one hide in Olkes, was impleaded for the same under writ of mort d'ancestre by WiUiam fitz Geoffrey. The Fine which resulted left William de Bikedon's tenure unquestioned, but he conceded a virgate and messuage to the Plaintiff (viz. that which his Father Geoffrey had held), \u2014 to hold in fee, rendering therefore one Sore Falcon yearly, in lieu of all, except forinsec, services. In 1255 the lines both of Robert de Girros and WUliam de Bikedon had termi nated in Coheiresses. Hence the Condover Hundred-Roll states that Isabella de Bikedon, daughter of William (de Bikedon), and her Sister, held Akes, for n hides of land (the Domesday hidage of Hach), under the heir of Sir Robert Girros; and (these sisters) paid 16d. per annum for stretward and motfee, and did suit to the Hundred.4 At the Assizes of August 1267, Robert Corbet and Ida his wife withdrew a suit of novel disseizin which they had had against Wil liam Hager concerning a tenement in Okes. Their Sureties were John fitz Henry and Roger Tuder, both of Okes. 2 \u2022 3 Supra, p. 50, and Vol. Ill, p. 78. | 4 Rot. Hundred. II, 62."], [622, "168 OAKS From an entry on the Assize- Roll of 1272, it appears that the daughters of William de Bikedon, deceased, were named IsabeUa and Margery. Isabella, then wife of Thomas son of Richard Gourdin, as heir of her father, sued Thomas son of (another) William de Bikedon for half a toft, etc. in Bikedon, but reduced her claim by one-half, because Margery her Sister would not join in the suit. In fact the latter, as \" Margery fitz William,\" was called to war ranty by the Defendant, and deposed that the whole of the premises belonged to her pourparty, and that Isabella her sister had an equi valent in Okes. The result does not appear. In Trinity Term 1293 I find Record of a purchase, made by Richard Burnel of Langley, of a tenancy in Oaks, and possibly the Vendors represented one or. other of the Coheiresses of 1255. By Fine levied in the said Term, Roger son of Roger de Froddesleye and Agnes his wife (Deforciants) quit-claim to the said Richard Burnel (Plaintiff) for 20 merks, a messuage and virgate in Okes juxta Wallingsburn;6 \u2014 to hold of the chief Lords of the Fee. From this and probably some other such purchases, it came to pass that the Nomina-Villarum-Roll of 1316 enters William Burnel (son of the aforesaid Richard) as Lord of Oke in Condover Hundred. Whether the Heirs or Assignees of Botterell retained any Seign- eural interest here, or whether the Heirs of Girros or of Bikedon had still any mediate rights in the Manor, are questions which analogy alone cannot determine, and on which no written Record is likely to give information. The following Undertenants in Oaks were probably of a lower class than any of the above. \u2014 In April 1253 Thomas de Okes and Henry fitz Baldwin of Okes occur on a Smethcote Jury. Thomas cle Hokes occurs on a Langley Jury in April 1264. At the Assizes of August 1267, William Hager was found to have disseized Angaret wife of Henry fitz Baldwin of 6 acres in Okes, which the said William alleged himself to have purchased.6 In October 1272 it was found, after trial by Grand Assize, that John fitz Henry, Plaintiff, had a better right to 20 acres in Okes than WiUiam Hagher, the Tenant.7 Thomas de Hakes, a Juror for Condover Hundred at these Assizes, is called Thomas de Okes in a Langley Inquest of 1274, and in a Longdon Inquest of 1283.

Seuuard held it (in Saxon times). Here is half a hide. It was and is waste.\" ' Not a trace can I find of any later interest retained by Robert fitz Corbet or his heirs in Brompton. Probably this wasted half hide became absorbed in the greater interest of Picot de Say, whose son, we know, dealt with the Manor of Brompton as if exclusively his own. This greater interest of Picot de Say is thus registered in Domesday. \u2014 \" Picot holds, of Earl Roger, Brantune. Ernui and Elmer held it (in Saxon times) for two Manors, and were free.

These were witnesses of Picot de Say's Charter,\u2014 Hugh, Earl of Salop, Hamo Peverel, Gyrard de Tornaco, Robert Corbet, Robert Pincerna, and Richard de CurceU.3 This Charter of Picot de Say, though there is no reason to doubt its genuineness, was so far ineffectual, as that his son and heir, Henry de Say, obtained Longfield (Cheney LongvUle) from the Abbey in the time of Henry I, and ostensibly in exchange for Brompton. This exchange was confirmed by Henry I in a Charter dated at Condover, addressed to the Bishop of Chester and to Pagan fitz John, Sheriff of Shropshire, and attested by Milo de Glou cester and WiUiam de Albini Brito. I have already given reasons for supposing this Confirmation to have passed in 1129 or 1130.4 The Confirmation of the Empress Maude, which probably passed about 1141, mentions and ratifies this exchange as one made in the time of her Father.5 Richard (Peche), Bishop of Coventry, con firming the possessions of the Shrewsbury Monks between 1161 and 1182, mentions the tithes of Bromptone as tithes of their own demesne.6 The Demesne lands of their Manor of Brompton were also included in the Charter of Free Warren obtained by the Monks on May 21, 1256.7 In the Taxation of 1291 the Abbey estate of Bromptone was valued at .\u20ac4. 3s.

It was perhaps combined with Eyton-upon-Severn, or with Emstrey, in these Surveys. \u20acmstrep* This extensive and valuable Manor was in Saxon times the heritage of the Earls of Mercia.

Emstrey, with its members, Cronkhill and Chilton, was in the Saxon Parish of Ettingham, now Atcham. In the reign of Stephen there seems to have been some question about the tithes of Emstrey, and it appears that Ranulph, Abbot of Shrewsbury, gave up two-thirds of the tithes of Emstrey demesne to the Church of Ettingham. This was without the consent of his Convent; \u2014 and between the years 1148 and 1159, Abbot Ranulph being dead, Abbot Robert, his successor, persuaded Archbishop Theobald to annul the concession.

If we take the Domesday estimate, Emstrey, Bour ton, and Betton alone realized 16^ hides, and the Abbot had other lands within the Hundred. King Henry Ill's Charter of Free- Warren to the Shrewsbury Monks bears date May 21, 1256, and extends to their demesnes at Emnistre. The Taxation of 1291 values the temporalities of Shrewsbury Abbey at Emestre as low as \u00a36. 4s. 9\\d., viz. a Carucate of land 10s. ; assized rents \u00a34. 14s. 9Ad.; Pleas and Perquisites (of Court), \u00a3l.\u00b0 This statement is perhaps a little less dishonest than at first sight it would appear, for 3 carucates of land, worth \u00a33. per annum, wee attributed to the Abbot's Manor of the Foregate (printed Foy ton), and a part of these three carucates may possibly have been in Emstrey. In the Nomina Villarum of 1316 the Abbot of Shrewsbury duly stands as Lord of the VU1 of Emystre. A Rent-RoU drawn up about the year 1490 exhibits a new and not very intelligible classification of some estates of Shrewsbury Abbey. The general estate, which extended south-eastwards from the Abbey- Foregate to Atcham, was caUed Hernesse,10 or The Lordship ; but certain rents are more specifically stated to arise from tenements in Emstrey, CronkhiU, etc. IwiUset forth such parts of this Rent- RoU as I conceive to belong to the original Manor of Emstrey, in cluding perhaps Brompton.11 Hernesse ; \u2014 ten items of receipt, amountiug to \u00a315. 8s. 8d.

Such a dif ference is too great for explanation, and I am obUged to conclude that the Fiscal Officers of Henry VIII discovered some ferms and rents which had been suppressed in the Valor. Of Undertenants in Emstrey or its members, I shaU only name one, Roger de Chylton, a Juror on several Inquests between 1283 and 1293, and, inter alia, on the inquest of Condover Hundred at the Assizes of 1292. Bourton, or Bortton, Earl Roger's gift of Bourton to Shrewsbury Abbey has been set forth under Emstrey, and one would imagine from the terms used in his Charter that the two Manors were given in the same way, that is, were original gU'ts of the Earl. Domesday however suppUes us with some qualification of such an idea. The Earl's gift of Bourton was an act of restitution. The Manor had belonged to that Saxon Church of St. Peter which was thenceforth to be represented by the Norman Abbey of St. Peter and St. Paul. \"The same Church,\" says Domesday, \"holds Burtune, and held it in the time of King Edward. Here is one hide geldable. In de- 12 Monasticon, III, 528."], [628, "174 BOURTON. mesne there is one ox-team, and (there are) vi Boors with one Team and also n Neat-herds here. Its former value was 5s. (per annum) : now it is worth 8s.\"1 The Monks of Shrewsbury seem to have dealt with this estate very differently from Emstrey. Instead of retaining it in demesne, they had a Feoffee here whose services were, if I may judge from later evidences, merely nominal. A Chapter in the Haughmond Chartulary accidentaUy furnishes some very early particulars about two of these Feoffees, viz. Gilbert Bochart (or Boschart), and his son Ralph. It would appear that Hamo le Strange of Cheswardine was a Tenant of the Abbot of Shrewsbury in respect of a part of the Manor of Betton. This Hamo, as I have said under Alveley, died about the year 1160, and without issue. A portion of his tenement in Betton was a strip of land dividing Berrington on its East from Condover on its West, and bounded by the Condover Brook on its South. Over against this strip of land, which was called Bulerugge, and on the other side of the Condover Brook, was the Manor of Bourton, held, at the time of Hamo le Strange's death, by Gilbert Bocharte under Shrewsbury Abbey. It is very remarkable, but not the less certain, that these two Tenants of Shrewsbury Abbey concurred in introducing a rival interest on these monastic estates. Hamo le Strange, making a final dispo sition of his property, gave \" the land of Bulerugge \" to Haugh mond Abbey. The object of this gift was clearly that the Canons might found a Mill on Condover Brook, for Hamo's grant included a Mill-stank. This Grant would however have been inoperative without the concurrence of Gilbert Bocharte, the proprietor of the opposite bank. Him the Abbot of Haughmond brought to terms by a present of one merk, and Gilbert Bocharte executed a Charter wherein he \" concedes the donation made by Hamo le Strange at the close of his life \" both of Bulerugge and of a MUl-stank, and adds, apparently on his own account, a grant of half the water (dimidiam partem aqu\u00e6). This Charter was attested by John le Strange and Guido his brother; and Engelard de Stratun stood Surety for Gilbert Bocharte's fulfilment of the agreement, after receiving Gilbert's fealty (or solemn promise) on the subject. It would seem that Radulf Bocharte, son of Gilbert, gave a cotempo rary security, in the form of a Charter which confirms to the Canons \" the land of Bulrugge, and the stank of a MU1 \" (here called the Mill of Bettone), \"and half the water, which (half) his Father 1 Domesday, so. 252, b, 1."], [629, "175 BOURTON.

This Grange, as well as the land, is called Underhelde in the Deed, which recapitulates former grants in a very intelligible way, specifying \"the whole water of Coner1 down to the boundaries of Biriton\" and \" the stank of the Mill of Betton which is at Aldefelde (AUfield), with the moor,\" etc., and \" liberty to erect a Mill for the uses of the Canons.\" Ralph Bozard seems to have been succeeded by Roger Bozard. Roger Bozard died about Easter 1194, and, having been a Tenani- in-capite at Pulley, his two infant daughters became Wards of the Crown. With regard to his lands, we have evidence that Bourton was in the hands of the Escheator in 1194-5, but no evidence that Pulley, which was his actual tenure-in-capite, was thus seized. His widow, viz. Dionisia, one of the numerous daughters and coheirs of Roger Mussun of Uppington, seems to have had her dower in PuUey, which may account for this omission. Be that as it may, the Escheator, at Michaelmas 1194, accounts at the Exchequer for 17s., as half a year's ferm of Burton ; \u2014 and also for 13s., the value of corn sold off the said vill, in the same period. In this instance, Burton is described as the estate of Roger Bozard, but the Es- cheator's account for the half-year ending Easter 1195 gives the late Proprietor's name as Radulf, and accounts 25s. for the haff-year's ferm of Burton. This mistake as to names is rectified on the Pipe- Roll of 1195, which records a Fine of 15 merks proffered by Henry Bochard and Elias de Echingeham, \" that they might have custody of the land of Roger Bochard and the bestowal of his daughters in marriage, with due regard to their rank and interests (ubi non dis paragantur).\" Of this Fine, 50s. had been paid at once, but 150s. remained due. Henry Bochard's interest in the matter afterwards passed to Hugh le Strange (of Berrington, I think), probably owing 2 Haughmond Chartulary : Tit. Bulerugge."], [630, "176 BOURTON. to some misconduct of Henry Boscard. The result was, that Alice, one of the Coheiresses, married Thomas, son of her guardian (Elias de Echingeham), and Isabella, the other Coheiress, married Ralph Mareschall. Bourton now became a divided estate, and I must needs foUow the interest of each Coheiress in turn. \u2014 Echingham Fee.\u2014 At the Salop Assizes of October 1203 I find Thomas de Ethingeham and Alice his wife moving a suit of mort d'ancestre against PetronUla, widow of WilUam Ketel. The latter essoigned hersetf by Robert the Miller, and the hearing was ad journed to Worcester, whither the Justices were proceeding, Alice naming her husband, Thomas, as her Attorney. At Worcester the Tenant, or Defendant, appears as Petronilla de la Hee. The dispute concerned half a carucate of land and half a MiU in Burton ; but the Defendant objected to the form of procedure, saying, that the Writ made no mention of Alice's sister, that is, that Alice, as a Coheiress, could not sue legally without her sister IsabeUa. The Court ordered a remanet, and gave leave to the Plaintiffs to amend their Writ and use the necessary form, making mention of two sisters. In this case, of which I hear no more, Alice's husband is called Thomas filius Ely\u00e6.3 He occurs as late as 1211, under the name of Thomas de Bureton ; but within the next ten years it is evident that he died, and that his Widow AUce remarried to a person whose Christian name was Elyas, and who was henceforth called Helias de Burton. About the year 1220, Henry Bossard appears again on the stage. He was doubtless related to the Coheiresses of Bourton, and perhaps held something there under them. I think, however, that his agreement with Ralph MareseaU and Helyas de Borton about Borton Mill must have originated in his having been placed there as Tenant of the Abbot of Haughmond's acquisitions. I actually find that, at some unspecified and unascertainable period, the Abbot of Haughmond \" demised the MiU of Aldefelde to Henry Bossard for life, and to one heir after him, at a rent of 10s. 4d.\" I imagine this to have been opposed by the joint Lords of Bourton, who appear to have intended to build a Mill themselves on the same site, and who, at aU events, about the year 1220, came to an agreement with Henry Bossard, of which the following is the substance : \u2014 \"Henry Bossard concedes to Ralph MareseaU and Helyas de Borton that they may make the stank of their MiU of Borton on whatever part they chose of Henry's land. Ralph and Helyas in return give Henry 20s. on entry, and covenant to pay him and his 3 Assizes, 5 John, mm. 1, 6."], [631, "177 BOURTON. heirs an annual rent of 6d. Henry should also pay no toll for grinding any corn at the said Mill, and should be entitled to grind first after such corn as might happen to be in the Mill. This agree ment was tested by WUliam de Norfolk and James fitz Martin, Bailiffs of the Lord Abbot of Salop ;4\u2014 an indication, I think, that the Monks of Shrewsbury were watching the proceedings of the Haughmond Canons with jealous care. At the Assizes of November 1221 the Jurors of Condover Hun dred reported, under the heading De Dominabus, how \"Isabella and Alice, daughters of Roger Boscard, were of the King's gift\" (as regarded their marriages) ; how \" Isabella had been married to Ralph MareseaU, by permission of King John ; \" how \" Alice had been married also to Elias de Burton, but the Jurors knew not by whose authority.\" Their lands in Condover Hundred were esti mated to be worth 12s. per annum. The Court ordered Elias de Burton's share to be seized into the King's hand. A Record which belongs to the Autumn of 1227 proves that Elyas de Borton was then dead, and his wife Alice again a Widow.6 It was about this time that the said Alice, calling herself \" Alice de Burton, daughter of Roger Bossart,\" gave to Shrewsbury Abbey a rent of 6d. arising from the tenement which WiUiam de Hagemon and Dionisia his wife held in the vUl of Burton. Witnesses, \u2014 - Master G. de Weston, Master Alan, Hugh de Kyneseleg. This grant was obviously the surrender of a Mesne interest, and, so far as it went, it made WUliam de Hagemon the immediate Tenant of Shrewsbury Abbey in a part of Bourton. The only child of Alice Bossart was Henry de Burton, her son by her second husband. He had succeeded her before 1255, as wdl appear under Uppington. Meantime, The' Helde, a member of Bourton, was tenanted by Ralph, son of that Henry Boschard whom I have so often mentioned. In the year 1261, William son of Ralph de la Re impleaded Henry de Burton for The Helde, before the Justices in banco at Westminster ; but making default, the land remained with Henry de Burton. Within two years, this land, with all his right therein, was given to Shrewsbury Abbey by Henry de Burton, styling himself \" Henry son of Elyas, and of Alice, daughter of Roger Bossard of Burton.\" The same Henry also gave to Shrews bury 3d. rent of the MiU of Burton, which had used to be paid annuaUy by Henry Panton and his wife AUce, daughter of Ralph 5 Testa de Nevill, pp. 53, 54. 4 Salop Chartulary, No. 117. AS VI."], [632, "178 BOURTON. MareseaU of Burton.6 This grant, which I take to have been a sur render of all Henry de Burton's remaining interest in Bourton, was made with consent of his wife Edelina, and his heirs. It was at tested by John de Prestecote, then Provost of the Foriete (Abbey- Foregate), by Richard de Preston, Clerk, and by Ralph MareseaU of PoUley (who died in 1263). As I do not know that this famUy had any further concern in Bourton, I reserve what I have further to say of them till I come to Pulley and Uppington. I now turn to the other moiety of Bourton which we may call the \u2014 Marshall Fee, as having been conveyed by Isabella daughter and Coheir of Roger Boscart to her husband Ralph MarshaU. This marriage took place before the year 1211, and the connection which thus sprang up with Shrewsbury Abbey is illustrated by Ralph MareseaU attesting more than one Charter of that House. In one instance he is caUed Ralph de Burtone. In November 1236 a Fine was levied between Henry Bozeard, Plaintiff, and Ralph MareseaU, Tenant, of three bovates in Bureton, whereof was Suit at Law. Henry Bozeard quit-claimed the whole, receiving, as the Fine expresses it, a sore sparrow-hawk. Probably Henry Boz eard's claim was founded in his relations with Haughmond Abbey. Ralph Marshall (I) must have died within four years of this Fine. He left his wife Isabella surviving, and two children, Ralph and Alice. Isabella, the widow, of course continued to hold her share of Bourton for life. The King's writ of Diem clausit, on the death of Isabella Burton, as a Tenant-in-capite at Pulley, bears date April 28, 1249. The consequent Inquest states the deceased to have held Burton under the Abbot of Shrewsbury, by the annual service of one salmon. She had at Burton haff a carucate in de mesne, worth 10s. yearly. She was in receipt of three rents there, amounting to \u00a31. 2s. 8d., viz. 14s. 10d., 7s. 4d., and 6d. She was entitled to a yearly tallage of 6s. 8a!. Ralph, her son and next heir, was now 40 years of age.7 On May 14, 1249, Ralph MarshaU (II) had livery of his mo ther's inheritance.8 He was deceased on September 14, 1263, when his son Engelard, called Engelard le Marescal, had livery as BaUiff of the King's Forest of Lythwood.9 On March 26, 1271, Engelard, son of Ralph le Marschal of Pulley, was appointed Forester of that part of the Wrekin which belonged to the appointment of the 6 Salop Chartulary, No. 116. s Rot.

I think that he had an exchange with William Pride, of Shrewsbury, by which he gained something at Pulley and lost something at Bourton. The following fact was aUeged at a trial in 1292, viz. that Ingelard de Poliley, during his Ufetime, had disseized Ralph de Ree of a messuage and 20 acres in Burton-juxta-Betton. I suppose this Ralph de Ree to havebeeu son of William de Ree, who just nowoccurredtousinl261. He (Ralph) had two daughters, Emma and Eva, of whom presently. Whether Ingelard de Poliley obtained ingress into the messuage and 20 acres by disseizin or otherwise, it appears that he conveyed the same to WUliam Pride, of Shrewsbury. William Pride, again, was de ceased in 1292, leaving a son and heir, John, and a widow, Sibil, who remarried to Walter de la Barre. Thus things stood when, at the Assizes of 1292, Robert son of Henry de Muneton, with his wife Emma, and Adam son of John de Wyluriston, with his wife Eva, sued Walter de la Barre and his wife Sibil for a messuage and 20 acres in Burton-juxta-Betton, as the right of Emma and Eva, whose father, Ralph de la Ree, had been disseized thereof as afore said. Walter and Sibil repUed, showing that they only held one third of the premises as Sibil's dower, and that John son of Wil- Uam Pryde held the other two-thirds. This defence, being found true by the Jury, silenced the prosecution.11 On August 12, 1343, it was fouud by Inquest that Stephen de Salop, Parson of Oldbury, and Richard de Dodyton, Chaplain (pro bably Trustees), were holding the Manor of Burton-juxta-Condover under Shrewsbury Abbey, at a rent of 32s., and by suit, twice a year, to the Great Court of Monkforyate. It was also found that no injury would be done to the Crown, if the said Tenants granted the said Manor, together with a messuage in Shrewsbury, and 2 acres in Cantlop, to the said Abbot and Convent, who were to pro vide a Chaplain to perform services in the Church of St. Peter for the health of Ralph (de Shrewsbury), Bishop of Bath and WeUs, while living, for his soul when dead, and for the souls of his parents.12 Of Undertenants in Bourton I have made much incidental 10 Salop Chartulary, No. 114, c.

In 1193 WUliam de Stanwardine, as Surety for one Engelard Bozard, was amerced half a merk; and the next entry on the Amercement- Roll is one of 10s. assessed on the Vill of Burton for some concealment. We have had notice of Hugh Boschard, Knight, living in 1206 ;13 but Henry Boschard, who fined in 1195 for custody of Roger Boschard's daughters, was also a Knight. This Henry was amerced half a merk in 1198 for some disseizin. The same thing happened again in 1199. In 1200 the Justice of the Forest amerced him half a merk for waste, which probably was coincident with his loss of the wardship above men tioned. At the Assizes of 1203, being a Knight, he sat as a Juror in certain causes tried in Grand Assize. In 1207 he was amerced one merk, probably for some offence against the forest-laws. In 1226 he was on a Great Jury which had to investigate certain ques tions relating to the Stiperstones Forest. The last that I hear of him is his fine of 1236 with Ralph Marshal. Ralph Bossard, whom we have seen to have had an interest in Pickthorn about 1241-2,14 we have also seen to have been son of Henry, and a Tenant in Bourton. In 1249 we have Ralph Boscart and Alan de Bureton on a local Jury. The same Ralph sat as a Juror for Condover Hundred at the Inquest of 1255 and the Assizes of 1256. Perhaps William de Burton, who essoigned his attendance, at the Forest-Assizes of 1262, through Elias de Conedovre, was iden tical with William de la Ree already mentioned. Walter de Burton appears as a Juror for Condover Hundred at the Assizes of 1292, and as Witness of a Condover Deed in 1320-1. I find something further about this Walter de Burton. He was born about 1253, as he himself stated in 1303. His daughter was married to Stephen de Felton before the latter came of age, that is, before 1302-3.15 Of Stephen de Felton I have already spoken under Berrington.16 The Abbot of Shrewsbury continued Lord of Bourton till the Dissolution, but his receipts therefrom are always classified with his receipts from Condover. I have stated these accounts under the latter Manor.17 As to the Abbot of Haughmond's acquisitions in Bourton, I should have concluded them to have vanished in the thirteenth century, judging from the tenor of the evidences above cited. How ever, I find that, in December 1419, Roger, Abbot of Haughmond, 13 Supra, Vol. IV, p. 21. 14 Supra, Vol. I, p. 240. 15 Inquisitions, 31 Edw. I, No. 178. 10 \u25a0 \"i\" Supra, pp. 37, 40, 31."], [635, "181 BETTON. granted a life-lease to Richard Gosenhtdl of Condover, of the Mill of Aldefelde, with a Moor, at a rent of 10s. The Valor, and other accounts of Henry VIII's time, make no mention of such an asset of Haughmond Abbey. Bttton. The History of this Manor, now divided into Abbot's Betton and Betton Strange, is disjointed and perplexing. Some inter esting documents bear upon the case, but a great deal is still left to conjecture. At Domesday, the whole Manor belonged to the Bishop of Chester, a circumstance which possibly is associated with the fact of Betton Strange being at this day an isolated part of St. Chad's Parish. In Saxon times, St. Chad's Church at Shrews bury was a Collegiate Church, and, if I mistake not, might be called the Shropshire Cathedral of the Bishops of Mercia with more propriety than modern notions are likely to recognize. I shall show in many instances that the relations between this Church and the Diocesan Bishops did not end at the Conquest. Domesday describes the Manor of Betton as foUows. \u2014 \" The same Bishop (of Chester) holds Betune, and held it in King Edward's time. Here are n hides, geldable. In demesne there is one ox team and a half, and (there are) mi Villains with two ox-teams and a half. Here are in Serfs. The Manor used to be worth 15s. (per annum). Now it is worth 16s.\"1 After Domesday we have not a particle of direct, and but very little indirect, evidence of Betton belonging, or ever having belonged to the Bishop of Chester. The Manor passed wholly or chiefly to Shrewsbury Abbey, but in what way, the Chartulary of that House does not anywhere declare. The Charter of William II mentions the license of Peter, Bishop of Chester, as having been adhibited in the foundation of Shrewsbury Abbey, which was within his Diocese.3 Earl Roger's foundation-charter speaks of his having had the counsel sembled the Monks of his Abbey iu the year 1087. I do not see that Bishop Peter's death in 1085 is inconsistent with such a statement. 1 Domesday, so. 252, a, 2. 2 Salop Chartulary, No. 34.\u2014 The ex press words of the Charter indicate that Earl Roger, relying on such a license, as-"], [636, "182 BETTON. of Bishop Robert (de Limesey) in his appointment of the first Abbot of Shrewsbury ; and the foundation-charter itself is attested by that Prelate as \" Robert, Bishop of Chester.\"3 It is however more than probable that the Diocesan Bishops of that day, no less than this, aided substantially any work of which they approved theoretically. I myself beUeve that Betton was Bishop Robert de Limesey's contribution to Earl Roger's Abbey. That Shrewsbury Abbey was possessed of Betton in the reign of Henry I, that the Monks gave a Use-lease thereof to Richard de Belmeis, Viceroy of Shropshire, and that that Prelate on his death bed (in January, 1127) took order with his Confessors that the Manor might revert to its Owners,- \u2014 all these are certain facts to which I have alluded already under Tong.4 I wUl here transcribe the very ancient and undoubtedly genuine documents which au thorized my former statements. \u2014 First there is the Letter of Fulk, Prior of St. Osyth (one ofthe Bishop's Confessors), addressed to G. (Geoffrey) Abbot of Shrewsbury. \u2014 G. Abbati, patri reverentissimo, et fratribus universis Monasterii Beati Petri Salopi\u00e6, Fulco, Sanct\u00e6 Osid\u00e6 Minister in Domino, salu tem.

Valete.12 I have given under Tong specific evidence that between the years 1154 and 1167 Ranulf de Belmeis (son of Philip aforesaid), being seized of Betton, surrendered the same to Shrewsbury Abbey, ac knowledging the unsound title of himself and ancestors thereto.13 I bebeve that we may now date this surrender still more nearly, viz. as between 1154 and 1160, and that we may do so with reference to the next circumstance which comes to our notice, and which has transpired under Bourton, viz. that Hamo le Strange, about the year 1160, made a grant in the Manor of Betton to Haughmond Abbey. My bebef is that Hamo le Strange was enabled to make this grant as Lord of Betton Strange, and that he was Lord of Betton Strange by feoffment of the Monks of Shrewsbury, who had alienated to him that part of the Manor, which was thenceforth called Betton Strange, in distinction from Abbots Betton, \u2014 the part which the Monks retained. The Heir of Hamo le Strange was his elder Brother John le Strange (I) of Nesse and Cheswardine. This John died in 1178, and was succeeded by his son, John le Strange (II). It is re markable that the latter, expediting, between the years 1203 and 1210, a Charter of Confirmation to Haughmond, sanctions his Uncle's grant in the following words. Dedi et iisdem Canonicis the neighbourhood of Tong (Vol. II, p. 201).

The language of original gift, here used instead of the language of confirmation, is so common in these Charters that it need not deceive us. All I wish to deduce from the paragraph is, that it implies John le Strange (II) to have been Lord of Betton Strange between 1203 and 1210.14 In Michaelmas Term 1220 Roger la Zouche was suing the Abbot of Shrewsbury at Westminster for the Manor of Beyton. The cause was adjourned to Hilary Term foUowing, the Abbot naming John, Prior of Morville, as his Attorney therein.15 The first hearing took place at the Shrewsbury Assizes of November 1221. Roger la Zouche, as I have shown under Tong,16 deduced his pedigree and right from his Uncle, Philip de Belmeis (II), who, as Roger alleged, having been seized de feodo et jure of the Manor of Beyton, had mortgaged the same to Salop Abbey for a term which had now expired. The prosecution, which was under the form De Ingressu, further insisted that this mortgage constituted the only ground on which the Abbot had obtained entry at Beyton. This monstrous averment was met by a mere technical objection on the part of the Abbot, viz. that La Zouche had first sued out his Writ for this trial in the time of a former Abbot, and so that the Writ was not good against the present Defendant. It was explained however that the Abbot alluded to was not dead, but was only deposed, and so the Court ordered the present Abbot to proceed with his defence, his plea being disallowed. He then petitioned the Court to grant View, i.e. a local Inquest, on the matter. This La Zouche resisted on the ground that the said View had already been had, viz. by the former Abbot. The Court however grauted the Abbot's prayer, and ad journed the case to the Morrow of St. Hilary (January 14, 1222), at Warwick.17 The Warwick Roll shows the cause adjourned to the Quinzaine of Easter, at Westminster. A Westminster Roll of Hilary Term 1223, calls the Suit one about half a knight's-fee in Becton, and adjourns it to Easter Term 1223. In Hilary Term 1225 the Suit is still pending, and the Abbot names one John, a Monk of Shrewsbury, his Attorney therein. The Suit, again adjourned to 14 Harleian MS. 446. Quatern. xi, so. 4.

I know not the result of this Suit from any evidence of the Plea- Rolls,18 but I cannot hesitate to say that La Zouche was wholly un successful. I should here observe that Bishop Richard Peche's Charter to Shrewsbury Abbey (between 1161 and 1182) confirms to the Monks the tithes of their proper demesnes in Parva Bettone.19 So Henry Ill's Charter of Free- Warren, dated May 21, 1256, extends that privilege to the Monks' demesnes in Parva Betton.20 The name thus given to Abbots-Betton must not confuse us. It was called Little Betton in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries to distinguish it from Great-Betton-in-Hales, a Manor also belonging to Salop Abbey. By an extraordinary accident, the Manor which was then called Little or Abbot's Betton is now called Great or Abbot's Betton; but this is to distinguish it from the adjacent and less extensive Manor of Little Betton or Betton Strange. The Tenure-Roll of 1284, com monly known as Kirby's Quest, says that \" Bogo de Knovill and Alianore his wife, hold Becton Extraneum of John le Strange, and John (holds it) of the King.\" John le Strange (V) of Nesse and Cheswardine, was the person here alluded to. His tenure of Betton, sine medio ofthe Crown, I greatly doubt. Bogo de Knovill held Betton Strange in right of his wife, she having it in dower as Widow of Robert, brother of John le Strange (IV) of Nesse and Cheswardine.21 I now come to a curious puzzle arising out of the variations of local nomenclature. At the Assizes of 1292 the Jurors of Condover Hundred represented that the Vill of Betton Strange and Alvithele, then held by Bogo de Knovill and Alianore his wife, had been used, in the reign of Henry III, to be geldable, in common with the rest of the Hundred, and to appear twice yearly at the Sheriffs' Town by four men and a Provost. Bogo de KnoviU appeared before the Justices and stated that his interest was merely in respect of his wife's dower, and that the Vill was of the inheritance of Fulk le Strange (her son by her former husband), without whom he de- own account, rendered Michaelmas 1277, when he was Sheriff and also Escheator. He renders account of \\2s. 6d., the assized rents of Baktone, late Robert le Strange's, which rents had accrued between Sep tember 2 and October 22, 1276, when the estate was delivered up to Alianore, widow of the deceased, in dower (Rot. Pipe, 5 Edw. I, Salop). 18 In 1228 Roger la Zuche is entered on the Shropshire Pipe-Roll as fining 40s. pro habendd mentione in brevi 'de tempore. This may have referred to the Suit about Betton. I have explained the technical nature of such a Fine under Ratlinghope (supra, p. 161, note 15). 19 \u2022 20 Salop Chartulary, Nos. 329, 53. 21 We learn this from Bogo de KnoviU's 24 VI."], [640, "186 BETTON. clined answering the presentment. Fulk le Strange then appeared and denied that Henry III ever had the Suits aforesaid, or that the Fill was ever geldable. The Jury found to the contrary, and that Betton and Alvythere had done the said Suits, and been geldable till 40 years since, when these dues had been withdrawn by John le Strange Senex (John le Strange (III) was meant). The Crown accordingly recovered the said dues.23 This use of a second name, Alvithele, or Alvythere, for the whole or a part of the Manor of Betton Strange, is connected with another decision, in a case of Quo Waranto, tried just after these Assizes. The Crown- Attorney (Hugh de Louther) sued John le Strange for the whole Manor of Avythelegh (except 3 virgates) as the King's right, and by a Writ-de-recto. John le Strange appeared and said that there was no such Vill as Avythelegh in the County, and on that point he appealed to a Jury. Hugh de Louther at first agreed, but afterwards petitioned the Court not to proceed to an Inquest. So Le Strange was dismissed sine die.23 I should suppose that in this way we may account for the Town ship, in which Betton- Strange stands, being at the present moment called the township of Betton and Alkmere. It is however certain that the name Alvithele, or some very similar name, was anciently common to other places in this neighbourhood besides Betton- Strange. I should now observe that the Taxation of 1291 is quite silent as to any estate, retained in demesne by Shrewsbury Abbey, which we can identify with Great Betton. The Rent-RoU, drawn up about 1490, gives however seven items of income as receivable by the Abbey from Button, amounting to \u00a38. 4s. 8dA The Valor of 1534 gives among the Abbey's receipts \u00a32. 17s. 4d. from Abbots Betton, and \u00a36. 11s. 5\\d. from Alveley.25 Lastly, the Ministers' Accounts of 1541-2 enumerate receipts of \u00a37. 9s. Ohd. arising from Alveley, and do not mention Abbots Betton at all. These receipts were, Assized Rents \u00a35. 10s., Rents of customary Tenants 19s. 6_d., Rents of Tenants-at-will 13s. 2d., and Perquisites of Court 6s. 4\u00ab'.26 It is impossible to say what could be the distinction, or identity, between Abbots Betton, Betton Strange, and Alveley, which would account for all these apparent discrepancies.

Manor in the thirteenth century, but must, I conceive, have been originaUy a member of the Manor of Betton. The name of Alvithe mere indeed is rather identical with Alkmere than Alvithele is, and we have seen how Alkmere and Betton Strange are still associated. As to the precise situation of Alvithemere, that may be almost determined by its occurrence as a limit to the King's Haye of Lythwood. The boundary of the said Haye, after \"running down an ancient foss which divided the Manors of Bayston and Pulley, came to Bayston Hill. Thence it went down to Bolemeressiche, that is, the watercourse which feeds Bomer Pool. Thence it went up along an ancient foss under Bolerugh27 to the field of Alvith mere, and so on to the Score above Boletug, and thence down to the field of Sutton.\" It is clear then that Alvithmere must have lain to the north-east of Bomer Pool, and so between Bomer Pool and Betton Strange.28 It was perhaps by feoffment of the Monks of Shrewsbury, perhaps by sub-feoffment of the Stranges, that Hugh de Turburvile aud Johanna his wife were seized in 1277 ofthe Manor of Alvedesmore. By a Fine of November 5 in that year, the said Hugh and Johanna (Impedients) grant the said Manor to Robert Burnel, Bishop of Bath and WeUs (represented by his Attorney, John de Berewyk). The Bishop, who gave \u00a3100 for the grant, was, with his heirs, to hold the Manor immediately of the Lords of the Fee, and by cus tomary services. Robert Burnell, probably within the next six years, gives his Manor of Alvedemar to Sir William de Ercalewe, in Frank-Mar riage with PetroniUa, the Grantor's Cousin. The Deed, which is without date or witness, limits the estate to the heirs of the bodies of the Grantees, quit of the Grantor; but in default of such heirs, it reserves a remainder to the Grantor and his heirs.29 PetroniUa Burnel, thus married to Sir WiUiam de Ercalewe, was a daughter of Sir Hugh Burnel, and so a niece of the Bishop's. AU I shall say of her here is, that her eldest son, WUliam de Ercalewe, was born December 29, 1284. At the Assizes of 1292 the Jurors for Condover Hundred represented that the ViU of Alvythemere, held by WUliam de Ercalewe, had withdrawn its Suits, etc., from the Hundred, in the same way as has been set forth of Alvithele. It was stated in reply that William de Ercalewe, the Tenant, had 23 Salop Chartulary, No. 279. 27 Bolerugh is, I conceive, identical with Bulregg or Bulerugge, already mentioned (supra, pp. 104, 174). 29 Charter in possession of Mr. George Morris of Shrewsbury."], [642, "188 PULVERBATCH. been convicted of felony, and was now in custody of the Bishop of the Diocese. It would thus appear that William de Ercalewe, though a married man, was entitled to the full privUeges of a Clerk. A Writ of King Edward I, dated June 10, 1293, informs the Sheriff and Coroners of Shropshne that R. (Roger de Molend), Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, had petitioned the King to restore to WiUiam de Ercalwe, Clerk, his lands and chattels. The Writ recites how the said Clerk, having been indicted for larceny of 15 swine before the Justices, last in Eyre at Salop, had been delivered up to the Bishop on account of his clerical privilege, and how the Bishop now testified that the accused had lawfully proved his innocence of the said crime. The King now desires further information as to the common reputation and conversation of William de Ercalwe, and whether he was a notorious Malefactor. The answer returned to this Writ, after an Inquisition held, is explicit as to the good repute of De Ercalwe. \" He is not and never was a Malefactor against the Peace, but was always of good fame and of faithful condition.\"30 All I shall say further about this reputed Manor of Alvithemere is, that the Inquest taken in 1304 on William de Ercalwe's death, says nothing about his tenure here ; \u2014 but estates held of the Church, as I presume this to have been, frequently escaped the notice of these Inquisitions. PuftertatclK As the modern ~We\\-batch figures in Domesday as Huelbec, so Pulverbatch was spelt Polrebec by the Norman Scribes who regis tered that Survey. About this termination, bee or batch, there are two opinions. Mr. Blakeway cannot forget that Bee, in the North of England, is a little brook, nor that the German form, Bach, is found in other Teutonic dialects. In Shropshire, the situation of Beckbury and other places on or near streams, suggests the same etymology. However, Mr. Blakeway acknowledges that it can hardly be said that there is a brook at Pulverbatch ; and I canuot find in the Saxon Glossaries any word like bee or bach, significant of a stream. Mr. Hartshorne, on the other hand, asserts the exis- 30 Inquisitions, 21 Edw. I, No. 191."], [643, "189 PULVERBATCH. tcnce of a Mercio- Saxon word, bach, signifying a bottom or valley. I cannot doubt that, in Shropshire and Staffordshire names, the word batch has the latter signification.1 I must join Mr. Blakeway in hazarding a somewhat bold opinion as to the etymology of the other part of the name Pulverbatch. It is clear that this district was well known to the Romans, and I can not but see that Roman and Saxon words are compounded in such names as Pontesbury, Pontesford, and Pitchford. Why, then, should not the Latin noun, Pulvis, pulveris, be accepted as the component of Pulverbatch ? Mr. Blakeway says that the district in summer is literally \" a bed of dust.\" It is moreover easy to see that a Norman Scribe, well knowing, as every Domesday scribe did, the meaning of the Latin part of the word Fafeer-batch, should write it as Polre-bec ; for Poire is, within a letter, the same as poldre, and that is the old French word for dust, \u2014 the original, in short, of our word powder. Lastly, one fact is known to all dwellers in the neighbourhood of Pulverbatch, viz. that in the local dialect the place is pronounced Powderbatch to this day. Domesday classes this Manor among those which were held by Roger Venator under the Norman Earl of Shrewsbury. \u2014 \" The same Roger holds Polrebec. Hunnic and Uluiet held it (in Saxon times) for three Manors. Here are n hides geldable. There is (arable) land (enough) for v ox-teams. In demesne there are n (teams) and (there are) mi Serfs and vn Villains with m teams. Here is a wood which will fatten 100 swine. Here are n Radmans. In King Edward's time the Manor was worth \u00a36. (per annum). Now it is worth 30s. When he (Roger Venator) received it, it was worth 20s.\"2 Of Hunnit and Uluiet, the Saxon Brothers, who were living and not wholly dispossessed at Domesday, I have spoken already.3 Pulverbatch they had not only lost, but the change of ownership had resulted in an unusual diminution of value. Of Roger Venator I have said something under Beckbury, but, as Pulverbatch became the head of his Barony, and as the Norman Castle, which once stood there, was probably of his foundation, I should here dweU more fully on him and his descent. He was brother, and probably younger brother, to Norman Venator, the 1 Salopia Antiqua, p. 240. Mr. Harts horne very aptly quotes the two versions (English and Latin) of the famous Legend of King Kenelm. By comparing the two versions, it will appear that the En- glish words, \" In Cient, in cowbach,\" were anciently Latinized by the words, \"In Cient, in convaUe bovina.\" 2 Domesday, so. 259, a, 2. 3 Supra, Vol. II, pp. 48-9, 304-5."], [644, "190 PULVERBATCH. ancestor of the Pichfords ; and the two brothers attested Earl Roger's foundation-charter of Quatford Church, probably in the very year when Domesday was compiled.4 After this I hear nothing more of Roger Venator. The supposition that Ulger Venator (who distinguished himself at Henry I's siege of Brug) was Roger's son and heir,5 is unquestionably erroneous. Probably however they were less nearly related. The Representative of Roger Venator in 1135 (the year of Henry I's death) is stated on good evidence to have borne the name of Roger, and to have been Ancestor, through females, of several Shropshire families. Among these the Constantines of Eaton Constantine and Oldbury ; the Uptons of Waters Upton; the Stapletons of Stapleton and Wistanstow are expressly mentioned, and we are also told that there were others beside. It would seem clear that Roger Venator had a Representative in the male line as late as the reign of Henry II. This was Re ginald de Pulverbatch, who left a daughter and sole heir, Emma. She carried the Barony of Pulverbatch to her husband Herbert de Castello. But this junction of two Baronies was transient. Herbert died about 1189, Emma about 1193. Neither of them left any issue, and the heirs of each had to be sought among their collateral relations. I have quoted, under Beobridge and Longnor, certain Charters of Emma de Pulverbatch, expedited both in her husband's lifetime and during her widowhood. The following, which belongs to the latter class and wiU therefore have passed between the years 1189 and 1193, I insert here, though it principally relates to land in Westley. \" Emma de Polrebech, daughter of Reginald de Polrebech, grants to Henry son of EyUic de Wesseleg, half a virgate in Wesseleg, and the whole of a certain Moor caUed Humbermor.

I do not perceive that, on the decease of Emma de Pulverbatch, 4 Supra, Vol. I, p. 112. 6 Blakeway's transcript from the Char 5 This was Mr. Blakeway's opinion. I ters of E. W. Smythe Owen, Esq."], [645, "191 PULVERBATCH. there was any question as to who was her heir. In the year 1193 the Herefordshire Pipe-Roll records a Fine negotiated between the Chancellor (Longehamp) and John de Kilpech, whereby the latter proffers \u00a3100 for his reUef of the Barony of Purbech, and pays instalments amounting to \u00a37. 10s. The whole fine seems to have been liquidated by subsequent instalments ; at least, on the Roll of 1197, I find a balance of only 50s. standing against John de Kil pech. Meanwhile, an Escheator's-RoU, which I will quote presently, shows that the livery given to Kilpec cannot have been complete, and that Pulverbatch remained in the King's hand till Easter 1196. Before I proceed with a further account of the Shropshire Barony of Pulverbatch, I must turn to another County, and recall the names and events of a previous century. My object is to supply the omissions of former Writers, and to record for the. House of KUpec that rarest of genealogical attributes, \u2014 a pure Norman pedi gree, as old as Domesday and as unquestionable as Truth. Turning over the folios of the Herefordshire Domesday , I find one William fitz Norman holding immediately of the King in several in stances.7 Besides the four Manors of Muleslage, Hopetune, Fenne, and Feme, he had Bradeford, a member of the Royal Manor of Leo minster ; he had a section of the Royal Manor of Maurdine, and he received certain issues, in money and in kind, from the Royal Manor of Lintune. But, besides aU these, WiUiam fitz Norman held three Manors of the King, which were situated in the Province of Arcene felde, and one of these Manors was Chipeete, that is, KUpec. From WUliam fitz Norman we pass to Hugh, his son and heir, whom we find to have been Fermor, or Custos, of the Royal Forest of Dean and of the King's Hayes in Herefordshire. The Gloucester shire Pipe-Roll of 1130 exhibits Hugh, son of William fitz Norman, as accounting \u00a313. for the census or revenue ofthe said Forest and Hayes, and as having due acquittance thereof.8 In 1134 we are told that Hugh, son of WUliam Norman, gave to Gloucester Abbey the Church of St. David of Kylpec, with the Chapel of St. Mary in the Castle (of Kylpec), and all his Churches and Chapels, with the lands thereto pertaining ; also, all tithes of his lands, both of wheat, hay, etc., and of all things of which Christian men ought to give tithe. He also gave pannage and common-rights in his wood, the terms of the Grant implying, I think, his expectation that the Monks of Gloucester would have a Priory or Cell at Kylpec.9 i Domesday, sub Tit.

In July 1141, when the Empress Matilda exalted Milo de Glou cester to the Earldom of Hereford, she gave him, inter alia, the Hayes of Hereford, and the services of Hugh fitz William, and all his fees wherever he had any ;10\u2014 that is, she transferred the fealty of Hugh, son of William fitz Norman, to the new Earl, and made his Tenure-in-capite a mediate tenure. It is evident that King Henry II at one time confirmed, to Roger Earl of Hereford, the whole of his Mother's grants to Milo, and specifically that very part of the said grants which related to the tenure of Hugh fitz William ;n but Roger Earl of Hereford died issueless before Henry II had reigned two years, and his Brother, though he became his heir in some respects, was neither allowed the Earldom nor the Seigneury over Hugh fitz William. Accordingly we find, from the Pipe-Rolls, that Hugh the Forester, as he is called, was held accountable to the Crown, at the rate of \u00a33. per annum, for the first four years of Henry II's reign, and that this due was for the Hayes of Herefordshire.12 A Return of 1 1 65, entered in the Liber Niger, was filled up by \" Hugh fitz WiUiam, Forester of Herefordshire,\" himseU. He ac knowledged a whole fee, held in his own demesne, and two quarter fees, held under him apparently, by Eutrop fitz Hingan and Hugh fitz Walding.13 These were held in capite, and were of old feoffment. As Hugh Forester he appears on another page of the same Record as holding a Knight's-fee under Baderon de Monemue.14 Hugh the Forester died in 1170, for the Herefordshire Pipe-Roll of that year records the Fine recently proffered by his son and heir, Henry, on succession. It was 60 merks, and was expressed to be for the land and office (ministerio) of his Father. The Hereford shire Pipe-Roll of 1175 shows Henry fitz Hugh as charged 10s. for the Scutage of Ireland, in lieu of personal service. The Pipe-Roll of 1176 makes double mention of him. As Henry fitz Hugh, the Forester, he accounts for a balance of \u00a38. 13s. 4a7., his fine for the land and office (servitio) of his Father ; as Henry de Kilpedet he appears on the list of those whom the King had recently amerced for forest-trespass. The enormous fine of 100 merks, thus inflicted on a man of less than baronial estate, probably indicates that the trespass in his case was looked upon as a breach of trust. About this time I find Henry de Kilpec, followed by his brother Walter in the testing-clause of a Charter of Robert (Foliot) Bishop 10 Selden's Titles of Honour, p. 537. 12 Rot. Pip. Ren.

I have said that the Escheat-Rolls supply a hint that this fine did not secure John de Kilpec immediate possession of this Barony. At Michaelmas 1195 the Escheator accounts for 1^ years' ferm of Pulre bec, viz. \u00a37. 10s., accruing since Easter 1 194 at the rate of \u00a35. per an num. Again, at Michaelmas 1197, the Escheator accounts for 20s., being the ferm of Pulrebech for the half-year ending Easter ] 196. The Scutage-Roll of 1194, viz. that for King Richard's Redemp tion, supplies like evidence. The Barony of Pulverbatch was not as sessed thereto at all ; but John de Kilpec paid 30s.17 on this account in Herefordshire ; that is, he paid the exact sum proportioned to those 1^ fees of old feoffment which had constituted the Honour- of his pa ternal Grandfather. The same non-assessment in Shropshire and the same assessment in Herefordshire are apparent in the Scutages of 1195 and 1196, which were assessed for the army of Normandy. In 1199, the first Scutage of King John was levied at the rate of 2 merks per fee. Accordingly John de Kilpec was assessed 40s. in Herefordshire on 1| fees; but his Shropshire assessment was mixed up with that of Hugh de Bosco, who was at the time accountable for the Barony of Holgate. I have noticed the errors of this assessment in a former Volume.18 Suffice it here to state that John de Kilpec paid only two merks, implying an opinion on his part that the Honour of Pulverbatch was only ratable to Scu tages as a single Knight's-fee. I have before alluded to suits which John de Kilpec had about Norbury (Staffordshire) in 1198, and about Beobridge (near Cla verley) in 1200-3.19 Both suits were probably contingents of his succession to the Barony of Pulverbatch. In the year 1200 John de Kilpeak gave the King 40 merks and a Palfrey, to have the King's guarantee that the King would grant no powers of assarting or falling timber in the Forests of the said 14 Carte's MSS.

John's Bailiwick to any one else, unless the King should fall tim ber for himself.20 Such seems to be the object of a Fine which secured a Charter, dated November 7, 1200, whereby the King covenants not to diminish aught of John de Kilpeak's Bailiwick of the Forests of Herefordshire, the King however reserving a right to fall and sell timber himself, without committing waste.'21 In the year 1201 John de Kilpec renders account of more than half of this Fine. He also accounts 40s., and, in lieu of a hawk, one merk,- \u2014 a fine or acknowledgment due from the preceding year on the Hayes of Herefordshire. He also fined 10 merks to be excused crossing the seas.22 This was in lieu of the second Scutage of King John, and Kilpec's service is stated at 2| fees, evidently 1^ fees for his Herefordshire Honour, and 1 fee for the Barony of Pulverbatch. In 1202 no Scutage was assessed on John de Kilpec in Shropshire, but to the fourth Scutage of King John, assessed in 1203, he was charged 5 merks on his Shropshire fee singly. In 1204 and 1205 his name is omitted from the Shropshire Scutage RoUs, and on January 7 of the latter year we find that he was deceased. The King then informs the Sheriff of Staffordshne that he has given the custody of John de Kilpec's land to WUliam de Cantilupe.23 On February 8 following, the King informs the Sheriff of Shropshire that he has entrusted his (the King's) Castle of Purrebech to Wil liam de Cantilupe. The Sheriff is to give it up with aU arms and chattels found therein.2* Another Writ, of April 26 following, gives information as to Cantilupe' s trust to Geoffrey fitz Piers (Chief Justice of England), and it appears that John de Kilpec's heir was also to be in ward to Cantilupe ; but the King reserved his marriage.25 Meanwhile Juliana (as she is in this instance caUed), the widow of John de Kilpec, gave the King 50 merks and a palfrey for the following privileges ; viz. that she might have her dower in Rokesley and Feme, where her late husband had assigned it, but out of his Serjeantry she was to have no thirds ; that she might remarry any one save an enemy of the King, giving the King due notice of her intention ; and that the Will of her husband might be executed, saving his debts to the Crown.26 WUliam de Cantilupe was informed of the King's acceptance of this Fine.

William de Cantilupe now gave the King 40 merks for the wardship of the person and lands of \u00c6gidia, Lady of KUpec, widow of William fitz Warin.59 The infant son of John de Kilpec was named Hugh. He had a long minority, of which the foUowing Records are proof, A Roll of Herefordshire Serjeantries, drawn up in 1205, says that WiUiam de Cantilupe holds in Bredeford by forest-serjeantry.30 This state ment is repeated with respect to a moiety of Bradeford in a Roll of 121 1,30 when also the same William de Cantilupe holds lit knights'-fees in Herefordshire, as Guardian of John de Kylpec's heir.30 A Shropshire Roll of 1211 confuses the Baronies of Hol gate and PuUebeche, but states the coUective tenure of the two as five knights'-fees, held by Thomas Mauduit, Baron, aud William de Cantilupe.31 I find nothing indicating that Hugh de Kilpec (II) had attained his majority before July 31, 1216, when a Writ of King John ad dresses him in his official capacity, as Custos of the Royal Forests of Herefordshire.32 From this time till his death he is constantly addressed by Henry III on matters connected with his Serjeantry. A Writ of April 4, 1222, gives him facilities for rebuilding his House at Rokel, apparently in Wiltshire.32 In August 1223 he had Letters entitling him to collect the Scutage of Montgomery from his Tenants in five counties, viz. Salop, Staffordshire, Here fordshire, Wiltshire, and Gloucestershire.32 In Michaelmas Term 1225 we first hear of that lawsuit from which it would appear that there were persons jointly claiming the whole of Hugh de Kilpec's Shropshire estates. In the present instance, the Defendant merely names an Attorney in a Plea of \u00bb Rot. Pip. 11 John, Heref. Dugdale (p. 446) has again mistaken these circum stances.

Henry de Ecton stood Surety for his appearance in Easter Term. As John fitz William, one of the Plaintiffs, was not moving in the suit, the Court ordered that the other three should sue for their respective shares. This they did in Easter Term 1226, claiming three-fourths of a knight's-fee in Phurebek, against Hugh de Kilpec.34 They alleged that a certain ancestor of theirs, named Roger, was seized thereof on the day when King Henry I was alive and dead (Dec. lst, 1135). Kilpec at first took exception, on the grounds that there were Sons descended from other Sisters and Coheiresses, besides those Sisters from whom the Plaintiffs derived their claim ; but this Plea he after wards abandoned, and demanded View . The Court acceded, and adjourned the case till the Justices-in-Eyre should visit Shropshire. This Suit ended in a Fine, levied at Lichfield on Nov. 12, 1227, and which shows that the Plaintiffs' claim was no frivolous matter. Robert de Stapleton acted as Attorney for Philip de Stapleton and Walter fitz William. The three Plaintiffs quit-claimed all their right to three -fourths of a Knight's-fee in Pulrebech, held by Hugh de Kilpec, but reserving to Thomas de Constantine and Walter fitz William the tenement already held by them in that Manor. In return Kilpec gave the three Plaintiffs 50 solidates of land in Lastes, Herefordshire, to hold to themselves and their heirs for ever, at a rent of 6d. He also gave them 40 merks of sUver on the instant. His Tenants in Lastes were present, and allowed that they coUec tively owed the services of 50s. now transferred. On April 20, 1230, Hugh de Kilpec, being about to accompany the King to Brittany, has a Patent of protection during his ab sence in foreign parts. About this time Hugh de Kilpec appears on a Staffordshire Scutage-RoU as paying 2 merks for a fee of old feoffment at Northbury.36 At Michaelmas 1235 and Easter 1236, he pays 2 merks to the Aid on marriage of the King's Sister; he pays it by hand of John Walsh ( Wallensis) .36 This was for the Honour of Pulverbatch. The Shropshire Feodaries of 1240 are very confused about this Barony.

Lastly, I should notice that these Feodaries of 1240 class Bels wardine, Acton Burnell, Berrington, Longnor, Woolstaston, and Welbatch under the Barony of Hugh de Kilpec without the slightest probability of truth. At or about this period we find Hugh de KUpec holding the following fees in other Counties. \u2014 In Staffordshire, 1 fee in North bury, under Walter de Lacy ;38 in Gloucestershire, % fee in Weston, over Richard le Bret ;33 in Wiltshire, 1 fee in Winterburn, under Robert de Tregoz ;38 and in Herefordshire, is fee in Eaton, over WiUiam de Eaton,39 fee in Park, over Alianore de Parco,39 fee in Lastres or Lastes, under the Earl of Hereford,39 besides 1| fees in KUpec and its members, held of the King in capite.39 On February 7, 1244, it appears that Hugh de Kilpec was de ceased, leaving two daughters to share his inheritance. The King on that day received the homage of Philip Marmion, who had mar ried Johanna, the youngest of these Coheirs, and ordered the Sheriff of Herefordshire to allot to the said PhUip and Johanna their share of Kilpec's estates. Meanwhile the esnecy of Isabella the elder daughter was reserved, and her said share was committed to the custody of WiUiam de Cantilupe tUl the said Isabella should come to the King and do whatever she was bound to do on thus suc ceeding.40 In this same year Isabella de Kilpec became the wife of WUliam Waleraund. On February 20, 1254, King Henry III granted to PhUip Mar mion the privilege of holding a weekly Market on Mondays at Pul verbatch, and an annual Fair of three days, viz. the eve, the day, and the morrow of St. Edith the Virgin (September 16) . The fol lowing status of this Manor appears on the Condover Hundred-Roll of 1255 : \u2014 \" Sir PhUip Marmion and WUliam Walraund hold Pul rebech, for five hides, of the King in capite, and they pay 40d. for stretward and motfee.

More probably still, Pulverbatch now included that estate of Roger Venator which Domesday had described as being then In land and ungeldable, but had treated as a part of Lege, or Longnor. At the Assizes of January 1256, William Waleraund and IsabeUa his wife were suing PhUip Marmion and Joan his wife for a mes suage in Pullerebach.42 Joan Marmion also named Robert Cocus as her Attorney in this or some other suit against the same Plain tiffs.42 Also Richard fitz Robert, a Condover Tenant, suing Philip Marmion for disseizing him of common pasture in Stepelwood, failed, because he had not impleaded the Defendant's wife as well as himself.43 On August 18, 1256, WUliam Walerond has a suit of novel disseizin against Thomas Corbet for a tenement in Pulverbach. Philip Marmion was in the next year engaged in the King's service in Wales, as I judge from a Patent of Protection in his favour, dated July 13, 1257. Partition of Hugh de Kilpec's estates was ultimately settled by a Fine of July 8, 1258. The Manors of KUpec and Rokele, a carucate in Tolunton, and the Advowson of Norbury went to William and Isabella Waleraund; the Manors of Sernte, Bradeford, Lastres, Norbury, and Pulverbach, with the Advowson of Pulverbach, went to Philip and Joanna Marmion, who were also to have a rent of \u00a32. 2s. 6d. from Rokele, or, in case the Waleraunds lost that Manor, from KUpec.43 On the Shropshire Pipe-Roll of 1259 an amercement of 100s. is charged against Philip Marmion for seizing some one's chattels iUegally. At the Forest Assizes of 1262 he was accused of having taken a Stag on September 14, 1260. In 1267 he fines half a merk for some Writ connected with his Shropshire affairs. At the Assizes of 1272 Philip Marmion's non-attendance was reported by the Jurors of Condover Hundred, as also his exercise of a right to hold a weekly Market at Pulverbatch. On February 14, 1283, King Edward I. orders the Sheriff of Shropshire to adjust the boundary between the lands of the Bishop of Bath and WeUs in Longden, and the lands of Philip Marmyun iu Pulrebache.

It was bounded by the high-road between Longedon and Pulrebache, which high road was the boundary between the said Haye and the King's Forest as far as to Idekinebrok ; thence the boundary passed to the field of Okes. The same Jurors decided that the forinsec bosc which was in Stepelwode was common, as between the Manors of Pulverbatch and Longdon. A second Writ, dated September 6, orders the Sheriff to cause these boundaries to be respected.44 The Feodary of 1284 has a duplicate entry of Philip Marmion's tenure-in-capite of Pulverbatch, or CasteU Poleredech, by service of one knight's-fee. The Officer who drew up the Survey evidently thought that there were two Manors in question. The King's Writ of Diem clausit, on the death of Philip Marmion, bears date December 5, 1291. An Inquest, held at Shrewsbury on January 14, 1292, found the deceased to have held Pulrcbeche in capite by service of one knight's-fee. In demesne there were, a capital messuage, a carucate of arable land, and two acres of meadow. A Mill realized 30s., the rents of free-tenants were \u00a39. Os. 2d. The deceased had also had the bailiwick of the Forestership of Hocklyth, worth 2 merks per annum.iS From this Inquest and those of other Counties I collect the following particulars of Phibp Marmion's heirs. \u2014 Mazera, apparently his eldest daughter, having been wife of Ralph de Crombewelle, was already deceased, but had left issue a daughter Joan, now twenty-four years of age,46 and the wife of Alexander de Freville. Joan, apparently the second daughter of Philip Marmion, had been wife of William de Morteyn. She was now a Widow, and 36 years of age. Matilda, third daughter of Philip Marmion, was 30 years of age, and now wife of Ralph le Botiler.47 A fourth daughter, another Joan, having been born March 25, 1283, was, as yet, only 8 years of age.48 It seems that, on partition of the various estates of Marmion of Tamworth, Pulverbatch fell in the first instance to Joan de Morteyn. At the Assizes of October 1292 she was said, by the a younger son of William le Boteler of Wem, and was seated at Norbury, Staf fordshire.\" Of course, we are not to forget 44 Inquisitions, 11 Edw. I, No. 65, b. 45 Inquisitions, 20 Edw. I, No. 36. 40 One Inquest (with, less apparent at tention to details) states Joan, the wife of Alexander de Frevile, to be upwards of that he got Norbury with his wife. 48 This Joan must have been Marmion's daughter by a second wife. Consequently she never appears as interested in the thirty. * Mr. Blakeway say9 that \" Ralph le estates of Joan de Kilpec, his first wife. Boteler, husband of Maud Marmion, was"], [656, "200 PULVERBATCH. Condover Jurors, to be holding the whole Manor, and her marriage to be in the King's gift. The Manor was valued at \u00a310. per annum. She, Joan de Morteyn, was questioned for exercising free chace in Huggelith, but this she evaded, on the ground that she was a Coparcener.49 At these same Assizes Johanna le Morteyn, Ralph le Botiler, and Matilda his wife, together with Alexander de FrevUle and Johanna his wife, are put down as Plaintiffs against Peter Corbet, concerning 20 acres of Bosc in Castel-Pulverbeche, in which the said Peter was said to have no ingress, save by an act of dis seizin, committed by Thomas Corbet, Peter's father, against Joanne Marmion, mother of Johanna le Morteyn and Matilda le Botiler, and Grandmother of Johanna de Freville.50 The same matter was subsequently brought forward at Lichfield as a suit of mort d'an cestre, the female Plaintiffs claiming as heirs of Joanna Marmion, whom they asserted to have died seized of the said 20 acres. Corbet evaded a direct issue in both cases, by showing that Freville and his wife were not really taking part in the suit.50 A Plea of Quo Waranto on this occasion questioned Johanna de Mortayn for holding pleas of the Crown, and having Free-warren, Market, Fair, and ways, in her Manor of Pulverbach. She acknow ledged her tenure of the Manor, but pleaded that she could not bring the question to legal issue without her Coparceners. The latter were summoned to attend at Lichfield on January 20, 1293. They did so. Joanna de Mortayn then stated that, as to holding Market and Fair, she was justified by the Charter of King Henry III to Philip Marmion, which Charter she produced, and so far her plea was allowed. As to holding Pleas-of-the-Crown, she stated that she only claimed view of frank-pledge twice a year, and then to hold such pleas as a Sheriff held in his Tourns. And generally as to her warrant to hold such View of Frank-pledge, and to have Warren and ways, she alleged her Coparcenery as above. Hereupon Ralph le Botiler and Matilda his wife, Alexander de Frevill and Joan his wife, came into Court and joined with Joanna de Mortayn in a refusal to plead further ; because John, son of Isabella Waleraund, being another Coparcener in the inheritance of Hugh de Kilpec, was not included in the summons. The said John was in fact an idiot, and in ward to the Crown. This plea produced an adjournment of the case ;\u2014 probably till such time as the whole of Hugh de Kilpec's Coheirs could be called upon to plead jointly.51 \u00bb Placita Coron\u00e6, 20 Edw.

These legal evasions must not allow us to imagine that during the life of Joanna de Mortayn any other Coparcener had a substantive interest in Pulverbatch. On August 13, 1295, the said Joanna was deceased without issue. An Inquest, held at Pulverbatch on August 31, found her to have held the Manor in capite as a knight's fee. The next heirs of the deceased were Joanna de Frevill, her Sister, and Ralph, son of Ralph Botiler, her Sister's son. Both were of full age. The Warwickshire Inquest, taken on this occasion, re presented how Philip Marmion had left, by a second wife, a fourth daughter, Joan, who was still in ward to the Crown. The Jurors knew not how far this Joan had a right to participate in the in heritance of Joan de Mortayn.52 The state of the case is however clear. Joan, the infant, had a right to a share in whatever Joanna de Morteyn had inherited from Philip Marmion, but to no share in anything which Joanna de Morteyn had inherited from her Mother, Joanna de Kilpec, \u2014 consequently no right in Shropshire. I find a note of the Relief paid by Ralph Botiler for Pulverbatch, being acknowledged in 30 Edward I (1301-2) .63 The sum paid was \u00a311. 2s. 2c?. (probably a balance). Pulverbatch is stated to be held \" by the third part of the moiety of the barony of Kilpec,\" which is intelligible enough according to what has been said above ; \u2014 but it should be remembered that of Marmion's moiety of the Barony of Kilpec there were now only two Coparceners. Pulverbatch is duly entered in the Nomina Villarum of 1316, as held by Ralph le Botiler. It continued with his descendants in the male line, till the reign of Elizabeth. Among Undertenants in this Manor those of the name of Walsh are of most frequent occurrence. Reginald Walsh was John de Kilpec's Attorney in a Lawsuit of the year 1200.54 In 1255 John Wallensis was one of the Jurors who made Inquest of Condover Hundred. The same person, as John le Waleis, was Foreman of a Langley Jury in 1264, and as John Wallensis of Purebech was re ported as non-attendant at the Assizes of 1272. In April 1284 John le Waleys occurs on a Stapleton Jury. Other Tenants here were Roger de Pulrebach and Richard de Linleg, \u2014 the latter Surety for an amercement of half a merk set on the former in 1203. At the Assizes of 1221 one PetroniUa, as heir of her Mother Alice, sued Richard de Linlegh for half a virgate in Pulrebech. The Defendant proved the Plaintiff to be the daughter of 52 Inquisitions, 23 Edw. I, No. 55.

She was nonsuited and in misericordid, her Surety being Philip de Stapelton.55 At these same Assizes Richard de Linleg surrendered a third part of half a virgate in Pulrebech, for which he was impleaded by Juliana, widow of Reginald Chamberlain, who claimed it as dower.55 The person here concerned may be that Richard de Linlega, who being brother and heir of Nicholas de Linlega, confirmed a grant which the latter made to Haughmond Abbey, viz. of aU that assart which Richard fitz David held under him in the Chircheton (Church- Town) of Pulrebache. Nicholas de Linlega's Deed had reserved a rent of 2d. to Richard his Brother. Roger Sprenghose and Reginald Parson of Pontsbury, attested the Deeds of both brothers.56 I have a note of a grant by Hugh de Kilpec to Robert Red, of land in Pulverbatch, at a rent of 2s., but the witnesses are not given.57 The Deed probably passed between 1220 and 1243. In 1249 John, son of Richard de Pulverbatch, occurs on a local Jury. In 1250 Hugh le Lene of Pulrebech was amerced 10s. for vert. At the Assizes of 1272, Isabel, widow of William le Whyte, withdrew her prosecution against Philip Marmion, whom she had called to warranty concerning a noke of land in Chyrchepullebatch.58 At the same Assizes Hugh Gratesige, and Joan his wife, Thomas le Mareschal and Avice his wife, with Dionisia and Margery, sisters of Joan, sued Philip Marmion for a debt of \u00a354. 6s., but the cause was adjourned.59 Also John Russel, as Grandson and heir of Roger Russel, sued Philip Marmion and Joan his wife, for half a virgate in Pulverbech. Roger de Pulverbach, a Juror on a local Inquest in April 1290, and Simon de Pulverbatch, a Juror in January and May 1292, were probably Undertenants here. THE CHURCH. Whenever it was that the Vills of Castle Pulverbatch and Church Pulverbatch were so distinguished, it was evidently subsequent to the foundation of the Church. This consideration would induce me to date the Church at least as early as the twelfth century. It was dedicated to St. Edith the Virgin, whose Feast-day, as we have seen, was fixed upon in 1254 as the period for an annual Fair at Pulver- 65 Assizes, 6 Henry III, mm. 4, 5. 50 Haughmond Chartulary, Tit.

I always supposed this Church to have been originally an affiliation of Pontesbury, and have found evidence of the fact, which I will state presently. The Taxation of 1291 values the Church of Pulverbache, in the Deanery of Pontesbury, at \u00a36. per annum, but says that the Church, that is (I presume), the Rector, was beneficed elsewhere.60 In 1341 the Assessors of the Ninth rated the Parish of Pulrebach only at \u00a34. The reason was that the Church-Taxation of \u00a36. was inclusive of \u00a32. 11s., \u2014 the value of the glebe, rents, oblations, hay and other smaU-tithes ; \u2014 income arising from sources not contem plated by the present assessment on wheat, wool and lamb.61 On March 30, 1446, it was ascertained by Inquest that Pulre bache was a Chapel without Cure of Souls, and that the spiritual cure of all persons resorting thither belonged to the Priests or Por tioners of Pontesbury, and the Hebdomadary (the Portioner doing duty at Pontesbury) for the time being ought to see thereto.62 The Valor of 1534-5 gives the preferment of John Butler, Rector of Powdurbach, as \u00a310.

On the contrary, the Manor was annexed integraUy by Roger Venator or one of his Successors to the adjoining Manor of Pulverbatch. Hence the Hundred-Roll of 1255 makes no mention of such a Manor as WrentnaU, but calls Pulverbatch a Manor of five hides, that is, a Manor which included the two Domesday hides of Pulverbatch, the two Domesday hides of WrentnaU, and a hide besides, with which we have nothing here to do. From that day to this, Wrentnall has been involved both parochiaUy and manorially with Pulverbatch, and I find only a few Deeds entitling it to any further distinctive notice.

His tenure at PuUey, being an Escheat in the hands of the Earl, or King, was constituted a Serjeantry, hut whether by Earl Hugh, Earl Robert, King Henry I, or King Henry II, I cannot say. The first Tenants of this Serjeantry, whom I can name with any show of probabUity, were Gilbert, Ralph, and Roger Bocharte, of whom I have said so much, under Bourton, as suc cessive Lords of that Manor in the reigns of Henry II and Richard I. Without recapitulating particulars there given as to the death of Roger Bocharte in 1194, and the division of his estates between two Infant daughters, I will proceed to quote and explain such docu ments as bear exclusively upon their lands and Serjeantry at Pulley. 4 Blakeway's extracts from the Muni- I Owen, Esq., of Condover. ments and Charters of E.

The Pipe-Roll of 1199 records the following Fine:\u2014 \" WiUiam fitz Geoffrey renders account of 40s. for having custody of the third part of Lia, which pertains to the dower of Dionisia his wife. He paid 29s. 4c?., and owed 10s. 8d.\" William fitz Geoffrey, thus mentioned, was Lord of Longner-upon- Severn, a Manor which he held under the Bishop of Lichfield, or Chester. He had married Dionisia Mussun, widow of Roger Bocharte, and his claim to hold, with her in dower, a third part of her late husband's Serjeantry, was, it seems, allowed. In 1200 I find William fitz Geoffrey charged only 6s. 8d. for his arrears of the last Fine. Also, among Fines made more recently with Hugh de NevUl, Justice of the Forest, one of 6s. 8d. is charged against WUUam de Longenalre for \"ill custody of his Bailiwick.\"3 This he had paid, and the mis stated arrear of 6s. 8c?. was paid in 1201. I have said (under Bourton) that Henry Boscharte, who originaUy had custody of one of Roger Boscharte's daughters, probably lost that privilege for some misconduct, and that it was bestowed on Hugh le Strange. In the year 1200 Hugh le Strange fines 20s. with the King \" for having custody of La Lye,\" that is, I presume, for such part of the BaUiwick as pertained to his infant Ward. The debt was paid before Michaelmas 1201. A Roll of Shropshire Serjeantries which belongs to this very period (1200-1202) has the following full and clear statement : \u2014 \" Hugh le Strange and EUas de Hatin cham have in custody, with the heirs (thereof), two virgates of land in PuUleg, (held) by Serjeantry, which (two virgates) are worth 8s. (per annum) ; and Dionisia, late the daughter of Roger Mussun, holds one virgate there in dower, which (virgate) is worth 4s.\"3 It is worth noting how Teodulf's-PuUey had thus maintained the exact measurement recorded in Domesday, while its reputed value had been exactly doubled. I have shown, under Bourton, how Alice Bocharte, one of the Coheiresses of PuUey, was in 1203 the wife of Thomas, son of Elyas de Echingham ; and how Isabella, the other Coheiress, was in 1209 the wife of Ralph Mareschall. This will explain the foUowing Records, it being first understood that the Serjeantry in question was, or how concerned as a Custos of the Forest, I cannot imagine. Probably there is some mistake in the Record. 2 The next entry on the Roll is of 1 merk, charged against William de Pulileia for \" ill custody of his Bailiwick.\" It had been paid, but who William de Puliley 3 Testa de Nevill, p. 61."], [664, "208 PULLEY. involved the custody of Biriwood, a forest, or rather haye, which was distinct as regards boundary from Lythwood, but usually asso- ciated therewith. In 1209 Thomas fitz Elyas fines 2 merks for having custody of the Forestership of Berawude. In June 1211 a Roll of Shropshire Serjeantries teUs us how \" Ralph Mareschall ought of his service to keep custody of Biriwode, a forest of the King, and of Lye, a haye of the King.\"4 Another but cotemporary Roll is more particular in the matter of Coparceuery. It says that \" Ralph MareseaU and Thomas de Bureton (identical with Thomas de Echingham) hold (their land) by serjeantry of the custody of La Lye and Buriwude, hayes of the Lord King.\"5 It would seem that Marshall had only recently obtained his share of this Serjean- try, for his fine of \" four merks for having a bailiwick of the Fo- rest\" is not recorded earber than the Pipe-Roll of 1211-1212. I have said that Elyas de Bourton, second husband of Alice Bocharte, was deceased in the Autumn of 1227. It would appear that his death was a violent one, and that Ralph Marshall obtained both shares of the Bailiwick of Lythwood. A Fine on the Pipe-RoU of 1228 exhibits Ralph MareseaU as \"accounting one merk for having that moiety of the Bailiwick of Lye and Buriwude which Elyas, who had been slain, had had.\" It seems to me that from this time Ralph MarshaU continued to be sole Custos of Lythwood, nor do I find Alice Bocharte or her son Henry de Burton exercising any subsequent interest in PuUey ; Alice de Bourton however, as she is in this instance called, is said at some time or other to have alien- ated half a virgate in PuUey, of which matter I wUl speak hereafter. In 1231 Ralph MareseaU had been amerced 20s. for \"ill custody of his bailiwick.\" He is also said to account with Elyas his fellow (though the latter had been dead some years) for 14s., the produce of windfalls in the Haye of Lye. In 1249 his widow IsabeUa de Burton being dead, her tenure in Polilegh was estimated by Inquest to have been 3\\ virgates, worth 6s. per annum, and held by the de- ceased by service of keeping the Forest of Lye.6 It is singular tbat the alienations of this Serjeantry were not taken account of by Robert Passelewe when he visited the County for such purposes in 1247. After Isabella de Burton's death, and immediately after the succession of her son, Ralph MarshaU (II), that is about January 1250, Geoffrey de Langley and Roger de Somery took cognizance of these alienations, though their specific commission was to assess 4 Testa de Nevill, p. 55.

According to the Pipe-Roll of 1252, they had set Crown-rents amounting to 10s. per annum on four tenants, holding 3 virgates of Ralph le Mareschal's Serjeantry, and three years' arrears of the said rents were now said to be due. The statement on the Hundred-Roll of 1255 varies considerably from this.7 It gives to Ralph MareseaU, Forester of the Haye of Lye, only 1^ virgates in Hoverpolile, for which three tenants paid rents of 6s. to him, and of 5s. to the Crown. It adds that his mother and his ancestors had sold the said land to these Tenants. Another part of the Roll indicates three Tenants in Poliley as paying rents of 20c?. each, or 5s. in all, to the Crown ; but one ofthe three was Tenant, not by feoffment of Ralph MareseaU or his predecessors, but by feoffment of Alice de Burton. I will endeavour to reconcile these, at least imperfect, statements when I come to speak of the Undertenants in Pulley. It appears that Ralph, the Forester of Lye, claimed the winter-pannage as his perquisite.7 At the Forest Assize of February 1262, Ralph Marscall, Forester of La Lye, was amerced one merk for trespass. His Sureties were William Burnel and William Champion. He further owed 8s. for the agistment of the Lye Forest in the current year. As one of the Foresters of the Fee, Ralph Mareschall attended an important Inquest at Brug in March 1262. Though he died in this or the following year, a debt of half a merk for trespass is recorded against him on the Pipe-Roll of 1267. In December 1273, Engelard, son and heir of Ralph MarshaU, appears on an Inquest at Brace-Meole as \"Engelard, Forester of Pulileg,\" a common metathesis, which is equivalent to Engelard de Pulilee. Forester. The Hundred- Roll of 1274 states that the tenure of Ralph Marchal under Henry III had been 2\\ virgates, held by Serjeantry of keeping Lithwode Forest ; that he had sold the said lands to five men of Poliley, viz. half a virgate to each ; that these five tenants now paid 6s. per annum to Engelard, son of Ralph le Marchal, under whom they held, and that, since the Her of Geof frey de Langley, Justice of the Forest, they had paid 10s. per annum to the King.8 These statements wUl require further remark in the Sequel. In 1284 Engelard de Puliley attests a Charter already given under Condover. In December 1285, as a Forester, he sat on a Jury at Salop. On January 28, 1290, he was deceased, and the Kind's Writ of Diem clausit resulted in an Inquest on 7 Rot. Hundred. II, 63.

The deceased, said the Jurors, had held in capite 6s. rent in Polilegh, which he received from three free tenants there, his service to the Crown being to keep the Haye of Lythe wode. He had also held, under John Pride of Salop, If virgates in Polilegh and Great Lithe, at a penny rent, the net value of the tenure being 13s. 4c?.9 With respect to this second tenure in PuUey I know nothing further. It is possible that John Pride may have been the Repre sentative or Successor of Alice Bocharte's heirs, and that MarshaU had obtained a feoffment of the other moiety of Over-Pulley. I think it however more probable that Engelard MarshaU's te nure under Pride was not in Over-Pulley, but in that part of Pulley which was of Mortimer's fee. PhiUp, son and heir of Engelard de Polilegh, was of full age on November 1, 1289. He therefore succeeded at once to his father. He appears as a Forester of-the-Fee in the great Perambulation of Shropshire Forests, made in the year 1300. In 1308 we have seen him attesting a Condover Deed. The Undertenants in Theodulf's-Pulley cannot always be dis tinguished from those in Mortimer' s-Pulley. I suppose that the whole of Theodulf's-Pulley was alienated by Roger Bocharte's Co heirs, and that the six half-virgates of which the Manor was com posed were held in the thirteenth century by as many Undertenants. Out of the discordant evidences which bear upon this question, I can only gather particulars about five of the six half-virgates. In or about the year 1222 Maurice de Pulilega gave to the In firmary of Haughmond Abbey an acre of land in Pulleley, with the houses thereon. The land was bounded by the lands of one Osbern and of Isabel, wife of Engelard.10 We have here the names of three early Tenants of the Lords of PuUey. Isabel, wife ofEngelard, was probably the mother of Engelard de Polilegh, a Juror on a local Inquest in 1249, and who, according to Langley's arrentation of 1250, held a whole virgate in Pulileg, pay ing the King a rent of 3s. 4d. per annum. The same Engelard, by the Record of 1255, appears to have been a Feoffee in Marshall's moiety. His tenure is put at half a rirgate, his rent to the King at 20d., and his rent to Marshall (if the rents were proportionate to p Inquisitions, 18 Edw. I, No. 12. That the Abbey retained this Tenement is proved by a Lease of the year 1321 whereby the Abbot demises to Richard, son of Richard de Cobeley, Notary of Pulleley, a messuage and Selion in Pulle ley, \u2014 to hold for life, at a rent of 2s. 10 Haughmond Chartulary, Tit.

At the Assizes of 1256 this Engelard, written as Engelard de Possileg, was on the Jury for Condover Hundred. In 1274 he is represented by Richard de Polileg, a Juror for the Hundred, but who is caUed Richard fitz Engelard in the enumeration of the five Pulley Tenants, who are said to have jointly paid a rent of 6s. to Engelard Marshall, and a rent of 10s. to the Crown. In May 1292, a second Engelard de Poliley appears on a local Jury, and in such a position as to indicate that he was of this family, even if we did not know that his Suzerain, also called Engelard de PolUey, had died two years before. He was father, I conclude, of William fitz Enge lard de PulUey, who appears on a local Jury in August 1295. Osbern, the Pulley landholder of 1222, is represented in the arren tation of 1250 by two sons, viz. by John fitz Osbern, holding a vir gate, and paying a Crown-rent of 3s. 4c?. ; and by Henry fitz Osbern, holding half a virgate, and paying a Crown-rent of Is. 8c?. In 1255 these two sons appear as John de Polileg and Henry Doyl ; but as holding only two half-virgates in Marshall's moiety, for which they seem to have paid a rent of 4s. to Marshall, whilst John's half-vir gate only is mentioned as paying a Crown-rent, and that Is. 8c?. It is clear that this is an omission, and that Henry Doyl must have contributed Is. 8c?. of that 5s. which was paid to the Crown by Marshall's three Tenants coUectively. In 1274 John de PoUley and Henry Doyl recur as Tenants of half a virgate each, and con tributing their proportions (whatever they were) of MarshaU's rent of 6s. and the King's rent of 10s. In October 1283, and in January and May 1292, John de Polilegh occurs on local Juries ; and, on the last occasion, a second Juror, called John fitz Henry de PolUegh, wiU have been the son of Henry Doyl. Maurice de Pulilega, the remaining Landholder of 1222, must, I take it, have been a Feoffee in the moiety of Alice Bocharte. In Michaelmas Term 1232, Richard fitz Auty sues Juliana, widow of Maurice BedeU, for 1\\ virgates in Pulileg. Juliana pleaded that her sole interest in the premises was as Guardian of her infant son, William. The Court ordered the Plaintiff to proceed against the said WUliam, when of age.11 Neither the Record of 1250, nor that of 1255, notice this tenure, but it is clear that it existed. In 1274 we have probably the above son and heir of Maurice in William Morice now Tenant of half a virgate in Pulley. He is stated to contribute to the King's rent of 10s., and to Marshall's rent of 6s. ; \" Placita, Mich. Term, 17 Hen. Ill, m. 16^"], [668, "212 PULLEY. but the latter is probably a mistake. The same person appears as WiUiam de Polilegh on a Jury of 1292. Robert fitz Robert,12 tenant of half a virgate in 1250, and sub jected to a Crown-arrentation of Is. 8c?., was clearly a Feoffee on Alice Bocharte's side ; indeed he is the same person with, or the father of, that Roger fitz Robert who, in 1255, is distinctly stated to have held half a virgate, aUenated by Alice de Burton, and to be paying a Crown-rent of Is. 8c?. This Roger fitz Robert appears as Roger fitz Broun on the Roll of 1274, again as holding half a virgate and contributing to the Crown-rent of 10s. But the same Roll is clearly in error where it states him to be a Feoffee of Marshall, and a Contributor to Marshall's rent of 6s. Mortimer Fee. This part of Pulley may perhaps be distin guished from the part already treated of, by a circumstance which exists at this very day. I think Mortimer's Manor must have been that part of PuUey which is now in the Parish of Brace Meole, while Teodulf's Manor was that part which is now in St. Julian's Parish. Domesday describes Mortimer's Manor as foUows : \u2014 13 \" The same Radulf (de Mortimer) holds Polelie (of the King) ; Eddid held it (in Saxon times) . Here is i hide and i virgate, geld able. The (arable) land is (sufficient) for v ox-teams. Here are in Radmans, and mi Villains, and v Boors, with vn14 ox-teams. In King Edward's time the Manor was worth 30s. (per annum). Its value afterwards and now was and is 40s.\" It is clear that the proximity of Mortimer's share of Pulley to his greater Manor of Meole, as well as the parochial connection which existed between the two, effaced their manorial distinction. Hence too it has come to pass that Meole has attracted this part of Pulley from Condover Hundred to within the Liberties of Shrewsbury. Except in Domesday we never hear of this part of Pulley as a dis tinct Manor, nor as anything more than a member of Brace Meole. Consequently, Mortimer's Feoffees in Brace Meole, that is De Can tilupe and De Bracy, must be taken to have been Mesne Lords of this part of Pulley. We shaU find evidence that they were so. I do not now purpose to speak of these great families, but only of their Undertenants in that part of Brace Meole which I take to be identical with Mortimer's-Pulley 12 Brunn de Pulileg, who has been men tioned under Stapleton (supra, p. Ill, note 7), as occurring in 1221, was father probably of this Robert fitz Robert. 13 Domesday, so. 260, b, 1. 1 ' The letters or written over the figures VII, make it probable that four (quatuor) ox-teams was the number intended."], [669, "213 PULLEY. Warin de Pulileg, who has occurred to us in 1221, seems, from his associates, to have been a tenant in Mortimer's-Fee. Perhaps Ralph de Pulie, who occurs at the same date, was another. He was impleaded for dower by Agnes, widow of Henry de Barewe, but, when the case was called on at the Assizes, the Plaintiff was found to be deceased.15 At the same Assizes William, claiming to be son and heir of Stephen de Purileg, sued Audulf de Bracy for a virgate in Purileg. De Bracy pleaded that the Plaintiff was ille gitimate, having been born before the marriage of his parents, which had only been solemnized when his Father was in his last Ulness. De Bracy objected therefore to the trial proceeding. The Court, finding that the Plaintiff's mother was dead, as well as his father, and that he, being an Infant, could not answer De Bracy, would not allow the trial to be stopped. Presently De Bracy gave way, and conceded William's demand and accepted his homage.15 In January 1222 a Fine was levied at Warwick between Audulf de Brascy, Plaintiff, and Walter le Poer, Tenant, of 2 virgates in Pulile, whereof was Assize of mort d'ancestre. Audulf acknowledged the right of Walter; \u2014 to have and to hold to him and his heirs for ever. One virgate, viz. that which Roger fitz Henry held, was to be held by Walter, under Audulf de Brascy, at a rent of half a pound of cumin, or lc?. ; the other virgate, viz. that which Peter held, was to be held by Walter at a similar rent under William de Cantilupe, who, being present, conceded the -arrangement. In 1232 I find one William fitz Edeline of Pulileg amerced for some breach of the Forest-laws. At the Assizes of 1256 John de Bracy was found to have disseized William cle Rodene and Alice his wife of half-a virgate in Pulilegh.16 It appears that, during Montfort's rebellion in 1265-6, John son of John le Waleys incurred the forfeiture of certain lands in Walsburn (Walleybourn, near Pulverbatch) and PulUeye. Thomas Corbet had a grant from the Crown of the re demption to be paid by Le Waleys, under the Dictum de Kenilworth ; and, in Hilary Term 1272, a precept issued to the Sheriff to bring Le Waleys before the King in Easter Term following, but for what specific purpose we are not told.17 15 Assizes, 6 Hen.

This was another of Ralph de Mortimer's Domesday Manors : \u2014 \"The same Radulf holds Edbaldinesham (of the King). Eddid held it (in Saxon times). Here is one hide, geldable.

Since then it was waste.\"1 It is clear from this that the existing value of the Manor was 8s., that is, the fee-farm rent at which the unnamed Tenant held it. I wUl not surmise who this unnamed Tenant was, but it is evident that Edgebold was, like Mortimer's part of Pulley, afterwards an nexed to Meole, and that so Cantilupe, or De Bracy, became its mesne-lord. We shall now observe a singiUar coincidence, viz. that, nearly two centuries after Domesday, the Lord of Edgebold's rent to Cantilupe stUl stood at 8s. \u2014 An Inquisition taken at Brace Meole, December 13, 1273, on the death of George de Cantilupe, found him to have been seized of a moiety of the Manor of Melesbracy, which he held under Roger de Mortimer.2 Among his rents, one of 8s., receivable from the Lord of Egbaldenham, is specified, and the said Lord of Egbaldenham did suit at the Manor Court of Melesbracy.3 fejjrinton.

Azor and Elgar and Saul held it for three Manors. Here are n hides, geldable. Here is a wood which will fatten 100 swine, and a Mill of 10s. (annual value). The whole is worth 20s.\"1 There is a great analogy between the histories of the two Manors of Sheinton and Burwarton. The Saxon Azor had an in terest in both. Both were held at Domesday by Helgot under Ralph de Mortemer. Both were involved in that large section of Helgot's Barony, which, by feoffment, or otherwise, passed to De Girros.2 In two respects these Manors differed. The mesne-interest of Helgot's Successors at Sheinton was not so completely obliterated in the 13th century as at Burwarton. Sheinton again was not held by De Girros in demesne. His Feoffees therein were a succession of knights, taking their family-name from the place. So then in the 13th century the status of Sheinton was as follows. De Sheinton held it of De Girros, or his heirs ; De Girros held it of the Lords of Holgate ; the Lords of Holgate held it under Mortimer of Wigmore, who held it of the Crown. I must now follow the succession of De Sheinton ; but, whereas the Representatives of the family uniformly bore the name of Hugh, I shall be unable to mark each generation wjth any certainty. The earliest Hugh de Sheinton of whom I have any notice occurs about the year 1150, as witness of a very ancient Charter ab-eady quoted under PosenhaU.3 Again the Pipe-RoU of 1197 teUs of a Hugh de Seinton, who had fined 2 merks with Geoffrey fitz Piers (then a Justiciar of the Forest) for license to cultivate an assart. The next or the same Hugh de Shineton occurs in 1207 as being amerced half a merk. He died between the years 1217 and 1221, after serving the then important office of a Coroner for Shropshire. This Hugh de Shineton, during the Barons' Wars of 1 Domesday, sos. 256, b, 2 and 260, b, 1. | \u25a0 ' 3 Supra, Vol. Ill, pp. 31, 285."], [672, "216 SHEINTON. 1215-6, adhered to the Royalist side, with his Suzerain, Hugh de Mortimer of Wigmore, while his Mesne- Suzerain, Robert de Girros, suffered forfeiture for espousing the opposite cause. Robert de Girros was however included in the Letters of Reseizin, issued by Henry III on November 4, 1217. Hugh de Shineton died soon after, and was succeeded by his son and heir, whom I will call Hugh de Shineton (III) . The latter, it appears, notwithstanding De Girros's re-investiture in all his rights, continued to render the services due on Sheinton to Hugh de Mortimer. At the Assizes of November 1221 Robert de Girros sued Mortimer \" for disseizing him of his tenement in Sheinton,\" by which was meant his right to the aforesaid services. Mortimer pleaded Robert de Girros's dis affection, and showed how the late Hugh de Shineton, through De Girros's default, rendered all services to himself (Mortimer) till the day of his (Hugh de Shineton's) death ; how also Hugh de Shineton his son had done the same, so that De Girros had, in fact, never been seized of the services on Sheinton since his rebellion. De Girros denied this and affirmed that he had, since his restoration, received the services of Hugh de Shineton, both father and son, iu turn, and that the disseizin which he alleged against Mortimer was since. The Jury gave a verdict for De Girros, who recovered his mediate rights and 5 merks damages. At these same Assizes, Hugh de Sheinton was amerced 20s. for not coming forward to answer for his deceased father's discharge of his duties as Coroner. The Feodary of 1240 gives Hugh de Shin ton as holding two-thirds of a Knight's-fee under Ralph de Mor timer,4 as if there was no mediate interest in the matter. This usual omission need not deceive us. We have had a Charter on a former page which about this very period associates the three names of Mortimer, De Girros, and De Shineton, in a way quite consistent with their mutual relations.5 In Easter Term 1243, Alice, widow of William le Gos, recovered a third of nine acres in Scheynton from Hugh de Scheynton and Roese his wife.6 In 1247, 1249, and 1253, I find Hugh de Shineton a Juror on three several Inquisitions. From his attestation of Charters I judge him to have been at this period a Knight.7 The Hundred-Roll of 1255 entitles him Sir Hugh de Seynton, and declares how \"he holds Seynton, for two hides, under Sir Roger de Mortimer, and pays 16c?. per annum for stretward and motfee, and does suit to both 4 Testa de Nevill, p. 45. 1 Supra, Vol. Ill, p. 52. 6 Placita, 27 Hen.

County and Hundred.\" The Jurors who made this return repre sented how the Abbot of Buildwas had entered on the fee of Scheyn ton to the extent of a carucate of land, and how the Prior of Wenlock was possessed of 4 acres there. The Jurors knew nothing of the title to these acquisitions in either case.8 No extant Char ter of either Monastery enables me to say anything more on the subject. At the Assizes of 1256 Hugh de Scheynton with eight others, all apparently Knights, were declared in misericordid, for refusing to make some perambulation ordered by the Justices. At these Assizes, John, as son and heir of John Tece, claimed 1^ acres in Cristeheth (Cressage) against William son of Hugh de Sheynton, but failed to prove that his Father had died seized thereof.9 In 1258 we have a notice of Hugh de Shineton's interest in Much Wenlock, as before stated.10 In 1259 he is amerced half a merk for some disseizin. In June 1260 he attends a great Forest Inquest, at Sheriff Hales, as one of the Verderers of Shropshire. A notice which we have had of him under Wenlock in 1267 makes mention of his heir, and perhaps indicates his advanced age.11 The next Hugh de Shineton who occurs was, I take it, a different person. At the Assizes of 127.2 the Jurors for Condover Hundred repre sented that the Vills of Sutton (near Salop), Sheynton, and Sta pleton would not allow the King's Bailiffs to levy distresses therein. Also the Vills of Belswardine, Sheynton, Church Prene, and Holt Prene, having been accustomed to do certain suits to the Hundred, had withdrawn them. One would imagine, from Sheinton being mentioned in this sequence, that the Lords of Castle Holgate had still a seigneural interest there. I doubt however whether these immunities were not claimed for Sheinton by stress of the fran chises of Roger Mortimer of Wigmore. An Inquisition on the subject of such withdrawals, taken about this time, expressly charges the withdrawal of Sheinton on Mortimer,12 but the Hun dred-Roll of 1274 attributes it to the \"Lord Earl Richard,\"13 evidently meaning Richard Earl of Cornwall and King of Almagne, sometime Lord of Holgate. On August 14, 1283, Hugh de Sheinton (IV), as I wdl call him, was empanelled for the Perambulation between Pulverbatch and Longden. He is named first after the Knights who acted on the Jury. The Feodary of 1284 says that \" Hugh de Schenton holds 12 Inquis., temp, incert., Hen. Ill, No. 8 Rot. Hundred. II, 62. 9 Assizes, 40 Hen.

Schenton under WiUiam de Hopton, and William holds under Ed mund de Mortimer, and Edmund de Mortimer under the King.\" I believe that for William de Hopton we should here read Walter de Hopton. He was one of the Coheirs of De Girros. I have before quoted a passage in this same Record which gives De Hopton's name first as Walter and then as William.14 At this period the mesne interest of the Lords of Holgate in Sheinton seems to have entirely vanished, otherwise it would have been Bishop Burnel's. Edmund de Mortimer's exercise of exclusive Franchises in Sheinton was ques tioned in 1292, as I have before shown.15 An Inquest, held pursuant to a Writ of May 27, 1294, states that a messuage and virgate in Seynton, lately held by Adam de Seynton, a felon, under Hugh, Lord of Seynton, had been in manu Regis for a year and a day, and that the Vill of Seynton was answerable for the proceeds. Again, pursuant to Writs of Edward I, dated at Dunfermlin, on November 6, 1303, two Inquests were taken as to a messuage and half-virgate in Shineton, lately held by Bernard de Shineton, an outlaw for felony, and a messuage and virgate held by Adam de Shineton, another outlaw. The returns are in the usual form, viz. that the King had had both tenements a-year-and-a-day; that they were held under Hugh, Lord of Shineton, who now had them in hand, except Adam de Shineton's messuage, which was now held by WU liam de Rugge and Petronilla his wife.16 For some cause or other two new Writs on the subject of these forfeited estates issued on September 1305. The returns were in substance the same as be fore.17 A Feodary, drawn up on February 10, 1305, gives Hugh de Scheynton as holding a Knight's-fee in Scheynton under Edmund de Mortimer, deceased.17 On February 9, 1306, this Manor was settled by a Fine levied at Westminster.

This was in all probability one of the Chapels originally subject to the Church of Cound. Though its dependence in the thirteenth century was perhaps nominal or obsolete, the Taxation of 1291 does not notice this Rectory. Neither was Sheinton, as a distinct Parish, assessed to the Ninthin 1341, unless indeed the place called Shevyn, which was assessed at 13s. 4c?., was Sheinton.19 If so, the error of placing it in Stottesden Deanery is an extraordinary one. In 1534-5 the Valor correctly places the Rectory of Shaynton in the Deanery of Salop, and the Diocese of Lichfield and Coventry. The prefer ment of John Smythyman, the Rector, was put at \u00a36. 13s. 4c?., out of which he paid 3s. 4d. yearly for Procurations, and lie?, for Synodals.20 EARLY INCUMBENTS.

The wood here (will fatten) 100 Swine. In King Edward's time the Manor was worth 20s. (per annum). Now it is worth 10s. He (Helgot) found it waste.\"1 We must understand by this that Richard held two hides and Godebold one hide in Preen. The two hides were afterwards known as Great Preen, or Church Preen, the one hide as Preen Girros, Holt Preen, or Little Preen. Great Preen. \u2014 I have hinted, under Meadowley, a possibility that Helgot's Tenant, Richard, was no other than Richard de Bel meis, afterwards Viceroy of Shropshire.2 In proportion to that probabUity is the probability that Belmeis, or his heirs, granted his or their interest in Great Preen to Wenlock Priory. The Viceroy himself is known to have had a special favour for that House. The distance of this Manor from Wenlock seems to have occa sioned the foundation of a Cell here, but of the date of that founda tion we are as ignorant as of the period when the Monks obtained the estate. The Lords of Holgate maintained a Seigneural in terest here in the thirteenth century, a circumstance which pro bably accounts for the seeming inability of the Monks of Wenlock to withdraw the Manor from Condover Hundred and to annex it to the Liberty of Wenlock. It would seem too that the Lord of Holt Preen had a concurrent right, with the Prior of Wenlock, in the Patronage of this Cell or Priory. Robert de Girros's quit-claim of a moiety of the Advowson of the CeU of Prene to Wenlock Priory took place in 1244, as before recited.3 It was within a year of that date that the Prior, probably in virtue of a title thus strengthened, withdrew Great Preen from suit of Condover Hundred. In 1250 we have had notice of the Prior's assarts in Preen.4 In 1255 the Condover Hundred-RoU reports that \" the Prior of Wenloc holds Prune Magna of the Fief of Sir WUliam Mauduit, for n hides. He paid neither stretward nor motfee, and had ten years since with drawn the suit which he had used to render to the Hundred; \u2014 whereby the Crown had lost 20s., or 2s. per annum.\"5 At the Assizes of 1256 Walter, son of John de Prene, claimed, as his father's, a messuage and half virgate in Prene against the Prior of Wenlock ; but the prosecution failed, because the Prior, having de mised the premises to one Dionisia, was not actual Tenant thereof.6 4 Supra, Vol. Ill, p. 241.

A third Suitor, Walter, son and heir of Alexander fitz Walter, recovered a messuage and half virgate in Prene from the Prior, according to the Assize-RoU;8 but a cotemporary Fine shows the said Walter quit-claiming a messuage, haff- virgate, and six acres to the Prior, whereof was Suit of mort d'ancestre, and receiving in return a life-lease of the premises at a rent of 4s. At the Assizes of 1272, the Suits of Church Prene and Holt- Prene were reported by the Jurors of Condover Hundred as having been withdrawn from the Sheriff' s-Tourn, seventeen years previously. The Hundred-Roll of 1274 repeats the substance of this statement, aUeging the withdrawal of Great and Little Preen, from the Greater Hundred-Court to Castle Holgate, as the act of Earl Richard, King of Almagne.9 It seems too that the Knights Templars, the existing Lords of Holgate, still withheld the said suit from Condover Hundred. In 1291, Pope Nicholas's Taxation gives the Prior of Wenlock's Temporalities at Preone as \u00a38. 3s. 4c?. : viz., from two carucates of land, .\u20ac2 ; from annual rents and from a Mill, \u00a35 ; from labour dues, 5s. ; perquisites of Court, 5s. ; from hay, 10s. ; and from a Dove-cote, 3s. 4c?. The profits on moveable Stock (viz. two Cows and three Sows) are further set down as 6s. 9c?.10 It would seem, from one expression in this statement, that the CeU was presided over by an Officer caUed the Prior of Preone. The same Officer is caUed merely Custos in an Inquisition which I shall now set forth, and which shows more of the real state of this CeU of Wenlock than any other document. A Writ of King Edward I, dated AprU 6, 1301, informs the Escheator-citra-Trent that \" Henry Prior of Wenlock has presented his feUow-monk, Brother Roger of Little Hereford, to the custody of the Cell of Prene, vacant by the resignation of Brother Richard de Wystanstowe, late Custos thereof: \u2014 that such presentment had been made to the King, as Guardian of the Infant heir of Philip Burnel, inasmuch as the Prior's Predecessors had always been wont to present the Custodes of Preen to the Lords of Holgate.\" The King, before he admits the Presentee, or restores to him the temporalities of Preen, wishes for further information as to the estate possessed in the aforesaid \" Assizes, 40 Hen.

It was involved, I presume, among those forinsec, or outlying, estates, whose revenues are usually given in gross on these Rent-Rolls. Of Undertenants here, the following probably belonged to the Wenlock Fee. At the Assizes of 1256, Henry son of Thomas fitz Hamon failed to prove his claim to a messuage and half virgate in Prene against the Prior of Wenlock, for the Prior had only demised the premises to his Father for life.13 In 1270-1 Hugh de Wlonkeslowe has a Writ of novel disseizin, against John le Dispenser of Prene and his wife Edith, concerning a tenement in Prene.14 In Trinity Term 1283 a Fine was levied whereby Hugh de Leye and Alice his wife (Deforciants) surrender to Henry fitz Philip of Chircheprene, a third part of half a virgate in Chircheprene, which was of the dower of Alice, but of the in heritance of Henry. A sore sparrow-hawk stands as the consider ation in this Fine. On June 11, 1296, Richard le Scot of Chirprene grants to Reginald de Wystanstowe and Johanna his wife 1^ acres in the fields of Chirprene for 20s. paid, and reserving a penny rent to the Lord of the Fee.

The Hereford Registers mention no Incumbents of Preen, but the Visitation-Book of Bishop Westfaling in 1587 names a Curate here, and speaks of the Church as \" an nexed to that of Cardington.\" This was no doubt a faithful restoration of its original state. The Living, though now inde pendent of Cardington, is only a Perpetual Curacy. HOLT PREEN, LITTLE PREEN, OR PREEN GIRROS. Godebald, the Domesday Tenant, under Helgot, of a hide in Preen, was a Priest. I have already adverted to some particulars of his position,15 and shown that his successor in ecclesiastical pre ferment was, after his son Robert, that very Richard de Belmeis of whom I was just now speaking.16 Who Godebald's temporal heir may have been is another question, and one quite proper to the present occasion. However I must be content with stating that his successors at Preen were the representatives of that family of Girros which we have seen to be so largely enfeoffed in the Barony of Holgate. I have no other reason for thinking that De Girros was Godebald's temporal heir. A rent-charge which was set upon Holt Preen for the benefit of St. Michael's Chapel in Shrewsbury Castle we shaU hear more of presently. It is an ex traordinary circumstance. Perhaps Godebald, Earl Roger's friend and adviser, was Incumbent of St. Michael's, and thus charged his temporal estate for the benefit of his successors in that Chap laincy. In 1194, the Escheat-RoU, which I have so often quoted as furnishing the income of Robert de Girros's estates, includes a sum of 16s., being half a year's ferm of his estate at Prene. A second half-year's ferm of 16s. is acknowledged by the Escheator inthe Roll of 1195. Robert de Girros \"the second,\" as I have usually called him, made a grant in Preen to Haughmond Abbey, a grant which I will not venture to date more nearly than between 1215 and 1235. It was of all the land which Adam de Gyros held of the Grantor in Prune, with the services of the said Adam and his heirs, viz. 17s. per annum. The Grant reserves to Adam all his rights as Tenant, and reserves to the Grantor all those easements in the Bosc 15 Vol. I, pp. 109, 111 ; II, p. 201. | '\u00ab Supra, p. 221."], [681, "225 HOLT PREEN. of Prune, which he retained when he enfeoffed the said Adam. The Canons are also to pay out of the said rent 5s. yearly at Michaelmas to the Chapel of St. Michael in Shrewsbury Castle, in lieu of all services falling on the Grantor or his heirs. For this concession, the Canons gave Robert de Gyros \u00a313. Witnesses, \u2014 John le Strange, Roger de Say, Vivian de Roshale, William fitz Alan,17 William Chaplain, Robert de Staunton, Robert Palmer, William Palmer, and Roger de Gyros.18 I wUl presently speak more particularly of the interest thus acquired by Haughmond Abbey in Holt-Preen. In a Fine of Easter Term 1232 we have the first indication of the Knights Templars getting a footing in Holt Preen. \u2014 Peter Cementarius and Matilda his wife (Impedients) acknowledge and warrant their gift of a carucate in Holprene to Brother Robert, Master of the Templars in England (Plaintiff by his Attorney Ralph fitz WilUam) . The Master and his successors were to hold the premises of the chief lords of the fee for ever. For this Fine the Master gave 5 merks. The Survey of Shropshire Forests, taken in 1235, draws a clear distinction between Great and Little Preen. \" Item, \u2014 the Bosc of Prene was viewed ,- \u2014 well-kept in respect of underwood ; but there is little oak timber therein, and it pertains to the Prior of Wenlock' s Liberty. Item, \u2014 the Bosc of Prene Girros was viewed ; \u2014 much fallen of old, by reason of the liberties (of the forest),19 but reasonably well kept (now) in respect of oak-trees and underwood. In the aforesaid Boses there be few Beasts, except such as pass backwards and forwards.\" Another Tenant of Robert de Girros in Holt Preen was Henry de Girros. The first I find of him is in 1247, when he appears as a Juror in a Wenlock Inquest. The Hundred-Roll of 1255 makes Little Prune to be one hide (its Domesday measurement) ; but it seems that the Wenlock Monks, here called \" the Monks of Prune,\" had added a third of Little Prune to their other estate at Great Preen. The remaining two thirds are said to be held by Henry Girrhos (one of the Jurors who made the Report) . The Manor paid neither stretward nor motfee, nor did it any .suit (to County or Hundred) .20 Here we must understand the Seigneury of WiUiam Mauduit to have been still existent, if not some mesne interest also of Robert 17 Of Drayton, I presume.

The Tenant interest of the Templars is alluded to in another part of the same Hundred-Roll, where it is said that \" the Templars of Lidley hold 20. acres (of forest) at Parva Prona and have destroyed the whole covert, which is in the Forest.\"21 At the Assizes of 1256 we have Alice de Prene giving half a merk for leave to compound her suit of dower with the Master of the Templars.22 At the Forest Assizes of 1262 Henry de Girros was amerced 5s. for vert.

On the forfeiture of the Templars in 1308 the Seigneury of Holt Preen seems to have remained with the estate of Edward Burnell, as Lord of Holgate. At all events the Feodary drawn up on Edward BurneU's death in 1316 gives Holt Prene as a member of Holgate.24 It is clear however that the principal tenant-interest went, like other estates of the Templars, to the Knights Hospitallers.25 The latter Order was in 1338 receiving the following income from Prene: \u2014 From a messuage and garden, 3s. ; 100 acres of land, 50s. ; com mon pasture, 20s. ; 6 acres of meadow, 6s. ; assized rents, 47s. lie?.; pleas and perquisites of Courts (including probably a Court at Long Stanton), 20s.26 The Total of \u00a37. 6s. lid. was chargeable with 21 Sot.

On the forfeiture of the Templars in 1308, the Abbot was prevented from receiving his rent. He com plained to the King,\u2014 Edward II, I think. A Writ of the King, addressed to the Barons of the Exchequer, recites the above par ticulars as to 17s. rent, due from the Templars to the Abbot, and orders that justice be done to the latter. Another Writ, which, if Edward II's, was expedited on June 18, 1309, orders John le Strange, as Custos of the Templars' lands in Shropshire, to pay the Abbot 17s. annual rent out of the escheated tenements in Holt-prene, with a year's arrears thereof. In 1338 a Pension was stiU paid to Haughmond Abbey by the Knights Hospitallers for the Templar estate at Prene ; but it had been reduced, by composition, to 16s.

De Girros had apparently a mesne interest here, as in many other Holgate Manors. The first whom I can name, as probably Tenant in-Fee here, was Roger Welcume. The years 1160 and 1180 are proximately the limits of certain Deeds of Humbald Prior of Wen lock, Gervase Paganell of Dudley, and Robert Prior of Wenlock, which I have already set forth, and which are attested by Roger Welcume.2 My reason for thinking that he was of Belswardine is that 1 Domesday, so. 258, b, 1. | * Vols.

The next Lord of Belswardine was that William de Belswar dine whom I have shown to have been a Coparcener in Acton Pigott at the close of the twelfth, and the beginning of the thirteenth, century. As William de Beddlesworth' he appears as a Recognizor or Juror on the Assize-Roll of 1201. In 1204 WUliam de Belleswrde fines one merk \" to have a Pr\u00e6cipe at Westminster, concerning 4 virgates of land, with their appurte nances in Belleswrth, against William de Bassecherche.\"3 This suit probably concerned the whole Manor; and, as I have said under Acton Pigot, William de Belswardine's successor both there and at Belswardine was William de Baschurch. At the Assizes of 1221, Walter fitz Roheis, in right of his wife Matilda, alleged to be heir of her Mother, Christiana fitz Ralph, claimed three-quarters of a virgate in Blidewurthin against William de Baschirche. The Jury found that Christiana died in the time of Henry II, and not of Richard I, as the Plaintiffs asserted. The Plaintiffs were therefore nonsuited, but they were excused any amercement, on account of poverty.4 Somewhat later than this, as I think, WiUiam de Basse chirche is found attesting a grant to Buildwas Abbey, which I shall give under Leighton. On October 28, 1227, I find that Robert de Clifton was Lord of this Manor, in right of his wife Amelina ; but how she inherited it I cannot say. A Fine of that date gives Thomas fitz WiUiam as claiming the Manor of Bedleswurth against the said Robert and Amelina under an assize of mort d'ancestre. For a sum of 10s. he renounces his claim, in favour of the said Tenants and the heirs of Amelina. On the day following, another fine was levied between Robert de Clifton and Amilia his wife, Plaintiffs, and Swanilda de Becleswrth, Deforciant, concerning the customs and service which the Plaintiffs required from the Deforciant for a tenement held by her under them in Becleswrth. The suit thus terminated was one of Grand Assize. The Plaintiffs had required the Defendant to provide one horseman in the King's Army-of-Wales at her own cost, whilst she asserted that the Plaintiffs were bound to find the horse, and she only to find the rider.

In Easter Term 1234, Robert de CUfton was one of the Jurors (and I think Knights) who appeared at Westminster in the Suit of Fitz Warin versus De Burwardsley, already noticed. In 1235 the Surveyors of the Shropshire Forests reported \"the Boses of Belleswurthin and Sheinton to be weU kept as regarded oak-trees and underwood.\" Both Manors, it will be remembered, were within the jurisdiction of Shirlot Forest. The Feodaries of 1240 are at variance about the tenure of Bedlesworth. Two RoUs give it as half a fee or a whole fee, held by Robert de Clifton under Hugh de KUpec ; a third is more correct in calling it half a fee held under Thomas Mauduit.6 I find Robert Clifton sitting on a Wenlock Jury in 1247, on a Lud low Inquest in 1252, and on an undated Inquest at Worfield, which probably came between the two. In 1255 he had been succeeded by his son Richard, who is set down on the Condover Hundred- Roll as holding Beclesworthin, of the fee of Sir Robert de Girros, for half a hide of land (the Domesday estimate) . The Manor paid 4c?. per annum for stretward and motfee, and did suit to both County and Hundred.6 The Seigneury of Mauduit is here omitted ; but of course it existed. At the Assizes of January 1256, Richard de Harley was attached to answer Richard son of Robert de Clyfton, for a trespass. He had entered the wood of the Plaintiff in Beldeswrih, had beaten his men, and carried off timber, contrary to the peace. Harley denied the injury and violence, and alleged that the wood in question was his own. The Sheriff was ordered to make a perambulation between the estates of the Litigants, which was done. The boundaries de termined upon are not given ; but four knights who were present are named. They were Odo de Hodnet, Stephen de Buterlegh, Peter de Muneton, and William de Leighton.7 The withdrawal of Be dleswrthyn from the Great Hundred-Court of Condover, as alleged at the Assizes of 1272, has been noticed under Sheinton. The Hundred-RoU of 1274 alleges a withdrawal from both County and Hundred, and charges it against Earl Richard, that is, the King of Almagne, late Lord of Holgate. The Knights Templars, who suc ceeded Earl Richard in that Lordship, still arrogated the suit of Belswardine to Castle Holgate.8 Meantime Robert BurneU, anticipating, no doubt, his future ac quisition of the Barony of Holgate, was buying up some tenements 7 Assizes, 40 Hen.

The Fines by which he effected his purchases passed on November 18, 1272, at Salop. They are curious, as showing the technical forms adopted by this great Lawyer. 1. Walter de Conede, Plaintiff, quit-claims to WiUiam le Fraun ceys, Tenant, a messuage and bovate in Bedeleswurth, which had been subject of a suit of Grand Assize. WUliam now, at instance of Walter, concedes the premises to Robert Burnell and his heirs, for a sum of six merks ; \u2014 to be held of the Lords of the Fee. 2. WiUiam le Fraunceys of Badeleswurthyn, Impedient, acknow ledges himself to have given a moiety of lj virgates in Badeles wurthyn to Robert Burnell, Plaintiff, represented by Malculine de Harley ; \u2014 to hold to BurneU and his heirs, paying a rent of one rose to the Grantor, and performing aU capital services. This Fine purports to be the conclusion of a suit of charter-warranty , and Burnel gives a Sore Sparrow-hawk. 3. Walter de Conede, Plaintiff, quit-claims to Richard de Clyfton, Tenant, a half-virgate in Bedeleswurth, whereof was Suit-at-law; Richard, at the instance of Walter, concedes the same to Robert Burnell and his heirs, to hold of the chief lords of the fee. For this BurneU paid 4 merks to Walter de Conede. At the Assizes of 1292 the Jurors for Condover Hundred pre sented that John de Le and Eva his wife held the VU1 of Bedles worthyn; that it had been used to attend the Sheriff' s-Tourn, twice in a year, by its Provost and four men, till twenty years past. The said Suit was valued at 12c?. per annum ; and, the said John and Eva not appearing, the Suit of Bedlesworthyn was declared to be in manu Regis, as a thing taken in distress (nomine districionis) .9 I must here discontinue this subject for want of further evidences. I neither know who the above John de Le was, nor how he suc ceeded to Belswardine, nor under whom he held the Manor. The Burnel Inquisitions of the period immediately subsequent take no notice of any Seigneural or Tenant-right possessed by that family in this Manor.

He (Helgot) found it waste.\" That the heirs and successors of Helgot did not retain the Sei gneury of all his Domesday estates, is a fact suggested by the history of Broseley,2 but made quite certain by that of Harley. In short, we never hear of the Lord of Holgate as concerned at Harley, except in Domesday. The Manor was annexed, and probably by Henry I, to the Honour of Montgomery. As to the Feoffees of this Manor, they were members of a family which took its name from the place, and which was seated here at least as early as the reign of Henry II. Much have Heralds and Genealogists laboured to prove the antiquity of a name which good fortune and high desert have conspired to render Ulustrious ; but the ordinary anti quity of a knightly family is all that belongs to the race of Harley. The Coronets of De Vere and of Mortimer, borne in later times by the representatives of this House, were achieved rather than inhe rited. Its origin, comparatively humble, and as yet unexplored, shall now be our subject. The Register of Wenlock Priory contains a memorandum of cer tain transactions between the Monks and two successive Lords of Harley. This document I quote as I find it,3 its grammatical in accuracies not being detrimental to its meaning. Libertates pro tenentibus Sancte Milburge in Harley.

It is evident that the Monk who wrote this memorandum had be fore him two Deeds, in one of which Edward, Lord of Harley, granted easements and pasture in Harley Wood to the Monks of Wenlock, in exchange for a House in Wenlock. The other Deed was a con cession of his predecessor's gift, by Hernulf, Lord of Harley, for an additional sum of 16s. paid by the Monks. Now the Sequel will show that this Edward and Hernulf, how ever related to each other, were Lords of Harley at a period ante cedent to any other Record. Probably the first half of the twelfth century was their era, and they, one or both of them, were an cestors of the Harleys. The next Lord of Harley whom I can name was Malcoline de Harley. We have seen him attesting a Deed of Henry Prior of Wenlock, between 1176 and 1190.4 In 1180 the Justices of the Forest, visiting Shropshire, entered the foUowing assessment on their Schedule of Imbladements : \u2014 In Herleid, de Malcolum pro 30 acris frumenti et 20 acris avene \u2014 10 sol. Again, in the year ending Michaelmas 1185, one Malculun had fined 100s. with Justices of the Forest for a new assart. The money had been paid at once. On November 22, 1192, we have Mal columb de Harlehe attesting a famous Charter of Bishop Novant to Buildwas Abbey. In 1198 one Malculum accounted at the Ex chequer as Deputy- Sheriff of Shropshne under WUUam Fitz Alan. In Easter Term 1200, we have Maucolum de Herleia as a Juror (and clearly a Knight), sitting on the Grand Assize which I have mentioned under Nordley Regis. At the Assizes of 1203 Maukolum de Harleg was a Juror in simUar causes and was also a Surety for the amercement inflicted on Warner de Wililey, his neighbour at Kenley. At the Forest Assizes of March 1209, Maucoline de Har legh was assessed 3s. 6c?. for an imbladement of 15 acres of oats, within Regard of the Long Forest. William de Harley, the next who occurs of this name, was, I imagine, Lord of Harley ; but it is clear that he was not the son of Malcolumb. At the Assizes of 1221, Thomas de Lega withdrew a suit of novel disseizin which he had moved against WiUiam de Har leg for a tenement in Harleg. His Sureties were Osbert and Hugh de Blakeway, and Roger Sprenghose.5 WiUiam de Harley's success 4 Supra, Vol. Ill, p. 294. | \u00bb Assizes, 6 Hen. Ill, in. 1 dorso."], [689, "233 HARLEY. against John de Harley in another suit has been told under Acton Bur neU.6 Also his occurrence as Surety for Gerin Burnell and William Corbet has been already noticed.6 At these same Assizes WUliam de Harley occurs in another and more curious relation. As son and heir of Robert Malherve he was called upon, to warrant his Father's grant of a messuage in Wenlock, by one John fitz * * * the Grantee, claim ing to be his Tenant. He did so willingly (libenter) and was dis missed sine die. It appears that his previous neglect to back his Tenant had enabled the Prior of Wenlock, as Seigneural Lord, to interfere with the Tenant's design of building on the said messuage, and to distrain the said Tenant's goods ; therefore the said Tenant sued him, to the end that \" he should acquit the said Tenant as regarded the Prior, since the said Tenant had rendered whatever was due to the said William de Harley.\"7 Doubtless this messuage in Wenlock was the same with the mansura which a former Prior had given to Edward, Lord of Harley. Probably the latest occurrence of WiUiam de Harley belongs to the interval between 1226 and 1231, when he was one of the Feoffees-in-trust to whom Warner and PetroniUa de Wililey conveyed their estates, as mentioned in a former Volume.8 The Genealogists make WiUiam de Harley to have been succeeded by a son Nicholas. Such a person has been mentioned already as having married Alice, daughter of Roger, son of Ralph de Presthope.9 I cannot question this statement on the ground of any apparent in consistency of date ; but, as I hear nothing else of Nicholas de Harley, I am inclined to think that he was only a Cadet of his House. Certainly in 1240 the name of the Lord of Harley was Richard. Richard de Harle held a knight's-fee in Harle of the Fief of WiUiam de Cantilupe, who then had the Honour of Montgomery.10 In May 1247 Richard de Harley and Adam de Harley were Jurors in an Inquest at Wenlock.11 The same year Richard de Harley and Hugh de Beckbury were amerced half a merk for not producing one whose sureties they were. In 1250 Richard de Harley appears as claimant of a great part, if not the whole, of the Manor of Neen Sollars.12 His title, grounded probably on the marriage of some ancestor, does not appear to have been recognized. In Michaelmas Term 1253, he sat as Juror on an important Inquest touching the 10 Testa de Nevill, p. 46. 11 Supra, Vol. Ill, p. 256. \u00ab Supra, pp. 136, 124. 7 Assizes, 6 Hen.

In 1255 the Condover Hundred-Roll registers Sir Richard de Harleg as holding Harleg for in hides, of the Fief late Sir William de Canteloy's. He paid the proportionate sum of 2s. for stretward and motfee, a proof that the Domesday hidage of the Manor had been reduced one-fourth. He also did suit to the Hundred.13 One would suppose, from Richard de Harley's style of Dominus in this entry, that he was a Knight. The next year however he was enrolled among those who held six Librates of land and were not Knights. At the Assizes of 1256 he sat as a Juror for Condover Hundred. Within the next six years he died, being in office at the time as one of the Coroners of Shrop- shire.14 He was succeeded by Robert his son and heir, whose mar- riage with Alice, daughter of Roger de Pynelesdone, has been already set forth.15 Its date will have been about the time of Richard de Harley's death. At the Forest Assizes in February 1262, Robert, son of Richard de Harley, stands among those who were assessed under Regard of the Long Forest. We have had Robert, Lord of Harley, as well as his Father-in-law Roger de Pevelesdone, attest- ing a Brockton deed of this period.16 In Michaelmas Term, 1269, I find evidence on the Plea-Rolls, showing that Robert de Harley was dead, and that his son, being a Minor, had been committed to to the guardianship of Robert Burnell by Prince Edward. The latter, I presume, had an interest in the matter as being Custos of the infant heir of Cantilupe, who was Seigneural Lord of Harley. The evidence in question is as follows. \u2014 In the Term above stated Robert Burnell names an Attorney in a plea which he had cor am Rege against William de Corf.17 Later in the Term the suit was adjourned to Hilary Term 1270. It is expressed to be a suit against William de Corve, Hem-y de Pres of Wenlok, and William his brother, \"who had entered upon the bosc of Robert Burnell, in Harleye (which bosc he had in custody by commission of the Lord Edward) and who had cut down trees therein to the extent of \u00a340 damages.18 I catch another glimpse of this suit on the Roll of Easter Term, 1270. The Sheriff, Uryel de St. Pierre,19 had been ordered to have the bodies of William Corve and Henry Preest in 13 Rot. Hundred. II, 62.

He was also amerced \u00a310 (or two sums of \u00a310 each) for his previous default.20 The Inquest taken in December 1273, on the death of George de Cantilupe, is in part missing. It seems to have mentioned Harley among the Manors pertaining to the Barony of Montgomery.21 Accordingly, in Easter Term 1280 I find Milisent, widow of Eudo la Zuche (one of George de Cantilupe's sisters and heirs), im pleading Richard, son of Robert de Harley, for the service of a knight's-fee in Harley.22 I conclude that the said Richard was now of age ; indeed we know that within the next three years he married Burga de Wililey, that great heiress whose estates thereafter contributed so much to the importance of this family. The Feodary of 1284 gives Richard de Harle as holding Harle for half a knight's-fee under Milisent la Zouche. For the last ten years of Edward I's reign the public offices and employments of Richard de Harley were numerous. As holding lands or rents of \u00a320. yearly value and upwards, he was summoned for military service in foreign parts, and to be at the Muster in London on July 7, 1297. In the same year he appears as an Assessor and Collector of Taxes in Shropshire and Gloucestershire. In 1299, 1300, 1301, 1306 he occurs as a Commissioner of array, a purveyor of provisions, or in other matters connected with the King's forces. In 1300 he was a Justice of Oyer and Tezrminer. In the same year and also in 1305, 1306, and 1307 he sat in several Parliaments as Knight of the Shire of Salop.23 As a Commissioner of array, a Conservator of the peace, a Justice for special purposes, or a Knight of the Shire, his name occurs in eighteen Writs of Edward II, between the years 1307 and 1316. He attended the Parliament of Lincoln which sat from January 27 to February 20, 1316, and apparently died within the next month; for the Return to a King's Writ, of March 5 following, certifies Robert de Harley to be Lord of the Vills of Keuley and Harley in the County of Salop. He was in like manner returned as one of the Lords of Aston, Herefordshire, and of Idbury and Foxcotefield in Oxfordshire ;~* but these estates were not inherited like Harley. They came to Robert de Harley in right of his wife Margaret de Brompton. Of this marriage I haye already given the particulars.35 Suffice it to observe 20 Placita, No. 156, m. 3 dorso. 21 Calendar, Vol. I, p. 49. 23 Parliamentary Writs, I, 657. 24 Ibid., IV, 977. 25 Supra, Vol. IV, pp. 253-4. 22 Abbreviatio Placitorum, p. 198."], [692, "236 HARLEY. that the importance of the family of Harley was so increased thereby, as that its history and descent from that day to this are less matters of curious research than of large notoriety. The Record which I have already quoted gives evidence of the continued in fluence possessed by Robert de Harley till the close of Edward II's reign. For subsequent events, I may safely refer to those Genea logical Collections which cease to be untrustworthy as soon as they appeal to public Records and discard family traditions. Or Undertenants in Harley, I have but few to notice. We find Roger de Blakewey assessed at 20c?. per annum in January 1250, in respect of 2 acres of forest-land ; and Robert de Blakeway amerced in 1259 for some trespass. Richard son of Sibil de Harleye occurs as a Juror for Condover Hundred at the Assizes of 1292. The Prior of Wenlock seems to have had some small landed interest in Harley besides a right of pasture. A portion too of the tithes was apparently his. Some allusions to these matters wiU recur under Wigwig. HARLEY CHURCH. This was, of course, originally a Chapel, subject perhaps to Cound. The Taxation of 1291 gives the Church of Harleye (in the Arch deaconry and Deanery of Salop, and the Diocese of Lichfield) as worth \u00a33. 6s. 8c?. per annum26 This is the earliest notice which we have of a Church which was probably founded more than a cen tury before. In 1341 the Assessors of the Ninth rated the Parish of Harleye at 30s. Great storms had destroyed the corn crops, a murrain had prevailed among the sheep, the inhabitants were so poor as to be scarce able to till the ground ; also the glebe land and other income ofthe Church went to make up the Church-Taxation, but were not to be estimated in assessing the present tax.27 In 1534-5 the preferment of William Dyeson, Rector of Harley, was valued at \u00a36. per annum, which sum was chargeable with 6s. 8c?. for procurations, and Is. 3c?. for Synodals.28 EARLY INCUMBENTS.29 Richard de Kynsedeleye, Clerk, instituted March 24, 1301.

His forfeiture and the redistribution of his estates by King Henry I, are facts which I have ventured to assume in the case of Quat.2 I may now seal that assumption by exhibiting cognate features in the history of Lydley. Lydley I suppose to have included the two townships of Botvyle 3\" Lichfield Registers, A, sos. 18-b, 19, I ' Domesday, so. 259, b. 66-b ; B, sos. 6-b, 209-b, 228.

In the latter case the Grantee will have been Herbert fitz Helgot, the very person to whom, with his brothers, King Henry I. has been supposed to have granted Outi's forfeited Manor of Quat. I have fixed the approximate period (1127-1138) during which Herbert de Castello, the son of Herbert fitz Helgot, must have suc ceeded to the Barony of Holgate.3 He married Emma, Lady of Pulverbatch; and sometime before the year 1185, Herbert de Cas teUo, either singly or with his wife Emma, granted Lydley to the Order of the Templars. I must now revert to a former question, * and fix more nearly, if I can, the precise period at which the Knights of the Temple ob tained a footing in Shropshire. \u2014 The earliest extant Pipe-Roll of Henry II, viz. that which be longs to the year ending Michaelmas 1156, has the following entry, implying a charge of 13s. 4c?. per annum on the Crown revenues of Shropshire, recently authorized by the King, and made payable, through the Sheriff, to the Knights Templars. \u2014 Et in Eiemosynis noviter constitutis. \u2014 Militibus de Templo 1 marc' argenti.5 Now, this entry does not imply an actual settlement of the Tem plars in Shropshire, though it did sometimes happen that a payment of \" constituted alms\" was charged on a particular estate of the Crown, and was in substance a transfer of such estate, or the King's interest therein, to a Religious body.6 Henry II. seems to have made a cotemporary and similar grant to the Templars, chargeable on the revenue of nearly every County or Shrievalty in the King dom.7 This annual entry on the Shropshire Pipe-Rolls continues as long as the Order of Templars held estates in England ; but we must resort to other evidence, if we wish to fix the period of their first settlement in the County. The Pipe-Roll of 4 Henry II. (1158) contains a list of those, whose quota of a Donum, assessed upon the landholders of Shropshire, had been excused by the King. The Knights of the Temple stand excused 2s. 7c?.8 In 1160 another Donum was levied in Shropshire, and the Knights were excused 3 Supra, Vol. IV, p. 54. 4 Supra, Vol. IV, p. 122. 5 Rot. Pip. 2 Hen.

In 116.2 they were excused their quota of the Danegeld then assessed in Shropshire ; but the sum excused (though appa rently 5s. or upwards) is obliterated in the Record, and we arc thus deprived of important evidence as to the extent of their Shropshire estates. However, the year 1158, the earliest in which the Tem plars are thus proved to have had lands in Shropshire, is involved in that interval of 1155-1160 which I have already fixed upon as the period when they got Cardington, Ench marsh, and half Chatwall, from the first WiUiam fitz Alan. Now, as the Templars fixed their Shropshire House at Lydley, and not at Cardington, it is reasonable to suppose that they acquired Lydley at least as early as Car dington. Probably, then, the years 1155 and 1160 will mark the period of all their Shropshire acquisitions. In 1185, Pleas ofthe Forest were held in Shropshire ; and Botefeld and Lidlega (entered as Fills of the Templars) were amerced 6s. 8c?. for a MiU, and for neglecting the expeditation of dogs. This amercement was paid in 1188; for the Templars had not as yet obtained those franchises which, at a later period, exempted their estates from such matters of forest jurisdiction. The Record of the Templars' possessions drawn up in the year 1185 has been already quoted under Cardington.9 It says that the Knights had \" a carucate of land at Lidlegee by gift of Sir Herbert de Castle-Holegot and confirmation of the Lord King (Henry II.) . This estate was held by the Brethren in demesne, except 16^ acres, thirteen of which were held by Richard de Lid legee at a rent of 26c?., and the remainder by his brother William, at a rent of 13c?.\" At Botlegee (a place now lost) the Knights had 2 virgates of land, \" by gift of the aforesaid Herbert, and by con firmation of the aforesaid King. This estate was divided into half-virgates, and leased at 5s. each half-virgate. John, Herbert, and WUliam held half a virgate each ; Edric and Herbert half a virgate between them ; an odd acre and half was rented by Edric Porcher for 3c?. Another part of this Record certifies that the Mill of Lidlegee was held by the Knights in demesne ; another, that they held the land of Botefeld (now Botvyle) in demesne. Certain cus toms were common to the Templars' Tenants at Cardington, Ench marsh, Chatwall, Botley, Linlegee (read Lidley), and other vills unnamed. They held their lands at the specified rents, quit of all customs, saving to the Knights such rights as their other Vassals rendered in case of a death, which rights however did not extend 9 Supra, Vol. IV, p. 123."], [696, "240 LYDLEY HEYS. to any charitable bequests of the dying person. The Seigneural rights in question were then a third part of the chattels of the de ceased, after his debts had been paid, another third remaining to his widow, and another to his chUdren.10 The sum total of the Templars' money-receipts in Shropshire was \u00a310. 8s. 4Ad. In 1190 I find the Justices of the Forest setting an amercement of half a merk on the Knights Templars' vill of Botfeld, in re spect of a neiv mill erected there, which was held to be apourpresture; but the amercement was cancelled, and the Knights are entered on the Roll as quit, because of the franchises secured to them by Royal Charter. Under Gatacre, and under Great Lyth and Pulverbatch, I have spoken of Walter de Upton or Walter fitz John, also of his son variously caUed William fitz Walter, WUliam de Lyth, and William de Upton. This WilUam fitz Walter appears as claiming half a hide in Botesfeld against the Master of the Templars and under writ of mort d' ancestre.11 He so appears on April 23, 1200, a period at which we know that his father, Walter fitz John, was Uving. It is therefore clear that he claimed in right of a deceased mother, or of some ancestor of a deceased mother. I shall have other occasion for showing that RichUdis, the mother of WiUiam, was an heiress, and was actuaUy deceased at this period, also that, as her heir, and in another instance, WiUiam fitz Walter disputed his own Father's title to certain estates elsewhere. I must now quote from the Rolls the steps taken in the Suit between William fitz Walter and the Templars.

The fragments which I have quoted leave another material point in doubt. Did Herbert de CasteUo grant Lydley and Botvyle to the Templars out of his own Barony, or out of that of his wife ? The latter appears most probable ; for Emma de Pulverbatch's con sent to any grant of her husband in his own Barony can only have been necessary to bar her own dower, a matter which in the year 1200 would have been irrelevant, seeing that she was dead. Again, John de Kilpec's status could hardly have been a point in the above suit, unless Botvyle had been of the Fief of Pulverbatch. And again, analogy leads us to expect that a claim by WiUiam fitz Walter would be rather in the Barony of Pulverbatch than in that of Holgate. AU these considerations compel me to recur to a former doubt, and to repeat that they materially affect the question whether Auti's Manor of Lydley, etc., was not rather granted by Henry I. to the cotemporary Lord of Pulverbatch than to the cotem porary Lord of Holgate.

In 1255 the Condover Hundred-Roll tells us how the Templars of Lidley were holding Lidleg, Gumble (Comley), and Bottefelt ; how they paid neither stretward nor motfee, nor did any suit (to County or Hundred).17 In 1267 we have William de Bottefeld amerced for some trespass.18 At the Assizes of 1272 we hear how certain malefactors, not yet identified, had burglariously entered the house of William son of Robert de Bottefeld, had wounded the said WiUiam, murdered his son Henry, and plundered his house. The Vills of Bottefeld, Lydeley, Le Botwood, and Prene were in misericordid for not making due Inquest in the matter.19 Meantime, that is about the year 1263, the Pr\u00e6ceptor of Lidley had obtained from Richard Plantagenet, King of the Romans, a demise of the Honour of Castle Holgate with all its rights and appurtenances.20 This tenure, as I have before explained, expired before 1284, and the Pr\u00e6ceptory of Lydley is seldom mentioned in public Records of a later date. In 1308 it was of course abo lished, together with all other English Houses of the Order. The Knights Hospitallers, succeeding to the Templars, seem to have held the Manor of Lydley for a season. The lands and tenements in Lidleie and Leie, which we have seen21 Griffin de la Pole surrendering to Fulk le Strange in 1312, were certain portions of Lydley and Lee Botwood which had been held by the Lords of Longnor, first under the Templars, and then under the Hospitallers. The Feodary of March 1316 gives the Earl of Arundel as Lord of Lidleye,22 and it is probable that he had obtained the Seigneury together with that of Cardington.23 However, the principle on which the Earl obtained the two must have been different, for he was the heir of the ori ginal Donor of Cardington ; but, whether it were the Baron of Holgate or of Pulverbatch who first gave Lydley to the Templars, the Earl was the heir of neither. I suppose the matter was one of arrangement with the Hospitallers ; in fact a Deed, some years later, though it does not give us the terms of the original trans action between the Hospitallers and the Earl, ratifies the surren der of both Lydley and Cardington. The Deed bears date at London \u00bb Rot. Hundred. II. 63. had Castle Holgate as early as 1256 ; but that rather was the date when the King of the Romans got it from William Mauduit. 18 Rot.

The Deed further remits to the Earl the Manors of Weston and Keteby in the Isle of Axiholm (Lin colnshire) , saving however the Advowson of Asthorp, in the same Isle, to the Order.

The copy from which I quote bears the seal of the Prior of the HospitaUers.2* Another Deed by the same Earl Edmund bears date at Clun, and passed in Edward II.'s reign, though the precise year is illegible.

It stUl remains in Con dover Hundred, in which Cardington itself neither is nor ever was. I suppose that Rainald, above mentioned, was Rainald the Sheriff; but his Successors, the Fitz Alans, do not seem to have retained any interest in Broome. Possibly their half-virgate here was too in significant a tenement to be kept distinct from Cardington, and went to the Templars together with that Manor. But of the residue of Broome we never hear as a distinct Manor, whereas we should ex pect to find an estate of Royal demesne to correspond with Earl Roger's Domesday tenement. I can only conjecture that the land in question became absorbed by the Forest, or was annexed to some adjacent Manor by one of those antient but unrecorded transfers which we have a right to assume when we find that a Domesday Manor has ceased to exist independently. In July 1280 we have William de Brome attending a Lythwood Inquest, and in 1295 attending the Inquest on Philip Burnel's death. In 1296 the same WiUiam, with Hugh, his son, attests a Deed already given under Church Preen. Whose Tenants these persons were does not transpire.

Two lands, or barren tracts in this district, together with some pasture, were now bestowed by Henry II. on Haughmond Abbey. Bechcote, which was added to the gift, must not be con sidered as a part of Botwood, but as another tract of Forest-land which had never been manorially settled. Pope Alexander III., confirming the acquisitions of Haughmond Abbey on May 14, 1172, includes the foUowing. \u2014 Ex dono Regis Henrici Secundi, Legam in forestd de Bottewde et Bechecote.* Here we have the origin of the modern name Lee Botwood, which, written at length, should be Lee in Botwood. Henry II. was at Nottingham at Christmas 1179, and, being there, expedited another Charter to Haughmond Abbey, which was attested by Geoffrey, Bishop Elect of Lincoln,5 and Geoffrey de Luci. This Charter gives and confirms half a hide of land in Lega apud Bottewde (that is, I presume, the whole Domesday Manor), and also 15 acres of assart towards Alwardeshed, for convenience of transit, or ad passagium, as the Deed expresses it. At this time there was at Lee Botwood either an Oratory (a vestige of the previous hermitage) ~or else a Chapel, founded by the Canons of Haughmond as soon as they entered on the estate. At Bechcote too there was an Oratory or Chapel ; and it would seem that some third Charter of Henry II. insured these ecclesiastical 5 Geoffrey Plantagenet, usually account ed as the King's second son by Rosamond Clifford.

There are two Charters of Bishop Richard Peche which bear upon this subject, and both must have passed before 1182-3, when that Prelate resigned his See. One of these Charters confirms to Haughmond the \" Chapels of Lega and Bechecote,\" as given by King Henry IL, and allows the Canons to place Chaplains in these and other Churches of their patronage, and to appropriate any residuary endowment.6 But it appears that both Bechcote and Lee Botwood were parochially within the ju risdiction of the Church of St. Andrew of Condover. Bishop Peche's second Charter on the subject alleges therefore the con sents of the Archdeacon of Salop and of all the Portioners of the Church of Conedovre, and then appropriates to Haughmond the Chapel of Lega in 'Bottewode, and (the Chapel) of Bechecote, with all tithes to them pertaining. \"And let the said Chapels,\" con tinues the Bishop, \" be served as (they are served) now, by one Canon of Haghmon, or by one Secular Chaplain, removable at the will of the Abbot, and who shaU receive the Cure from the Abbot's hand so long as he shall there remain.

It was not hidaged (probably as having been Forest-land) ; nor did it pay stretward or motfee, nor did it render any suit (to County or Hundred) .\" In the year 1273 the Canons of Haughmond and the Templars of Lydley were at issue about their respective rights of common in the Woods adjacent to Lee Botwood; but, before I set forth their agreement, I must premise that the Forest of Botwood, as distinct from the VU1 or Manor of Lee Botwood, was stiU in the Royal De mesne, except so far as it had been allotted or leased to any Grantees of the Crown. As early as the year 1199 the Templars of Lydley had assarted 40 acres in this Forest. Hence King John's Charter of July 16, 1199, gives the Order a full quittance in respect of this and other assarts.11 The Knights were, in short, exempted from all questions of waste and regard in respect of these encroachments on the Forest. A Charter of King Henry III., dated February 10, 1227, renews these Franchises of the Templars, in respect of 40 acres of assart at Botewd, and other assarts in England and Wales.12 The composition before aUuded to, between Guy de Foresta, Master of the English Templars, and Alan, Abbot of Haghmon, bears date December 11, 1273, and agrees, with respect to their disputes concerning common pasture in the Woods of Bottewode, as follows :\u2014 The Abbot concedes to the Master and the Brethren at Lidley common pasture in the aforesaid Wood for the swine and cattle of themselves and their men of Lidley ;' but in the pesson season, that is between Michaelmas and Martinmas, the beasts of neither party were to enter the Bosc of the other.

This agreement was tested by Roger Sprenghose, John de Esthope, Richard de Eton, WiUiam Marscote, and WUliam Champneis ; also by Brother Richard Lovel, then Pr\u00e6 ceptor of Lidley ; John Large, Brother Serjeant-at-Arms to the Master ;13 and Brother Geoffrey de Bocles.

Of Alward, or Elward, I have spoken under Condover and Stapleton, and said that, whUe all his Domesday Manors were probably forfeited, most of them were annexed by Henry I. to the Honour of Montgomery. Smethcott, forfeited by what Saxon or Saxons soever, was undoubtedly thus bestowed ; and in the following account we must uniformly under stand that the cotemporary Lord of Montgomery was the Lord Paramount of Smethcott. Towards the close of the twelfth century the Lords of Mont gomery had a Feoffee at Smethcott, whose Christian name, William, is alone preserved. This William left three daughters and coheirs, Christiana, Matilda, and Margery. In October 1203 these Co heiresses, being the wives respectively of John le Poer, Richard de Linley, and Baldwin fitz Robert, were claiming the Manor of Rag don, as I have already stated.3 Their suit does not appear to have been successful. At the same time two of them seem to have been at issue with one another about Smethcott ; for the Assize-Roll of the year in question notices how Richard de Linleg and MatUda his wife, having a suit of disseizin against John le Poer and Christiana his wife, for a tenement in Smethcot, had withdrawn the same, and were in misericordid together with their Sureties.4 1 Domesday, so. 259, b, 1 2 Ibid., so. 259, b, 2. 3 Supra, Vol. V, p. 118.

Picklescott was a member of Smethcott, of which I must here after take distinct notice. The Haughmond Chartulary preserves a Deed which passed somewhat later than the above transactions, seeing that Christiana appears therein with a second husband, Philip de Hulega. The said Philip and Christiana join with Richard de Linleg and his wife Matilda, and with Baldwin fitz Robert and his wife Margery, in granting hatf Pykelescote to Robert fitz Madoc, for his homage, aud for 60s. paid, and for some other consideration, not to me intcUigible.5 The same Chartulary supplies us with a stiU later Deed, which we may safely date as between 1217 and 1227, and which exhibits the Coheiress, Christiana, with a third husband, and the coheness, MatUda, as deceased. Thereby Baldwin de Smeth cote, son of Robert, with his (Baldwin's) wife Margaret, Sir Richard de Linleg, late husband of Matildis de Smethcote, and Sir Stephen de Patinton with Christiana his wife quit-claim to Haughmon Abbey all disputed wood between Lega (Lee Botwood) and Smeth cote.

Their interests in other places, such as Aldon and Acton Scott, will give some occasional help in this investigation. 1. Christiana's successor I take to have been Roger le Poer, who occurs as a Coparcener at Aldon in 1240.7 If so, he was, with equal probability, the son of her first husband, John le Poer. Sub sequent representatives of this branch are caUed Pichard, but I can not fix their affinity with Le Poer. Roger Pichard, living in 1253 and 1255, had an alleged interest in Acton Scott, but not in Aldon. 2. Matilda, wife of Richard de Linley, had, apparently by him, a son Richard; and the said son had a daughter and sole heir. Richard son of Richard de Linley, with Alice his daughter, quit claimed then* right to a part of Pykelescote, as I shall show here after. I think that this Alice became the wife of Thomas Purcel, who occurs on a Smethcott Inquest in April 1253, and who in 1255 was a Coparcener in Aldon, Acton Scott, and Smethcott. 3. Margery was the wife of Baldwin fitz Robert ; and the said Baldwin succeeded his father in a tenure-in-capite at Chirbury. His descent is therefore easily made out. He took the name of Smethcott from his wife's inheritance, and, as Baldwin de Smethcott, troduced him to this neighbourhood. 5 Chartulary, Tit. Pykelescote. 6 Ibid., Tit.

Dying about September 1233, he was succeeded at Chirbury by his son Roger; but Margery his wife, surviving him, continued to hold her share of Smethcott. The years 1245 and 1255 will probably be the limits of a Deed, whereby Margery widow of Baldwin de Smethcote granted to the Abbot of Haghmon and his men of Le Botwood a right of common in all her lands at Smethcote. Witnesses,\u2014 Sir Roger Sprenchehose, John de Stepulton, Richard Anglicus, Philip Burnel. In October 1252 we have Margery de Smethcott claiming the Advowson of Acton (Acton Scott) against Roger Pichard, and other persons, unnamed in the Patent which I quote. Besides her son Roger, Margery seems to have had a son Stephen, who suc ceeded her at Aldon and Acton Scott, and was a Coparcener there in 1255. A Patent of January 7, 1256, pardons Stephen son of Baldwin de Smethcott for his entertainment of WUliam de Ragdon, an outlaw. Roger de Smethcott died about April 1253, leaving a son and heir, Philip, aged 23 years, and who succeeded at once to his Father's estates on the Border. Before the year 1255 the said Philip had apparently succeeded his Grandmother at Smethcott. The above three statements will now explain the following return on the Condover Hundred-Roll of 1255. \u2014 \" Roger Pichard, Thomas Porcel, and Philip de Smethecot hold Smethecot for half a hide of land, of the Lord Edward, the King's Sou, (whose tenure is) in the name of custody of Sir WUliam de Canteloy's heir.\" The Manor paid 4c?. per annum for stretward and motfee, and did suit to both County and Hundred.8 Here we should explain that the Infant heir of William de Can tilupe, late Lord of Montgomery, was in ward to Prince Edward. The Domesday hidage of Smethcott was made up by Piclescote, reputed to be also half a hide ; but the tenure of the two was now totally distinct, as wiU appear in the sequel. I will now resume a distinctive account of each share in Smethcott. 1. Roger Pichard of Smethcot was assessed in 1262 for an im bladement within Regard of the Long Forest. He stiU owed 18c?. on this account in 1267. Roger Pychard was reported by the Jurors of Condover Hundred as failing in attendance at the Assizes of 1272. Smethcote was one ofthe Manors which were enrolled as having been held of George de Cantilupe's Honour of Montgomery in the Inquest taken after his decease. I have an extract of a Deed, said to have passed in the time of Henry III., and which clearly 8 Rot. Hundred.

Thereby Roger Prichord of Staundon, Knight, grants to Sir Hugh Burnel, Knight, his land in Smytycot, together with his share of the Advowson of the Church.9 The Feodary of 1284 names only two Coparceners in Smethcott, viz. Reginald le Escot and Hugh Burnell, holding the Manor of Matilda (read Milisent) la Zouch. On the death of PhUip Burnel, son and heir of Sir Hugh, an Inquest, taken in July 1294, states that he held certain rents in Smethecote under Milisent la Zouch.10 Also half Philip Burnel's Manor or estate of Smethcott was at the time of his death, as found by another Inquest, in the hands of those Luccan Merchants who had such a large Uen on his property.11 Again, on Edward Bur neU's death in 1315, the Inquest states him to have held a third part of the VU1 of Smethcote (including 48s. 3c?. rent) under Wil- Uam la Zouche by one-twelfth part of a Knight's-fee.12 This share of Smethcott was annexed to the dower of Edward Burnel's widow, Alina, who accordingly appears in the Feodary of 1316 as Lady of Smethcot,13 the names of the other Coparceners being omitted. 2. After Thomas Purcel in 1255, I find no instance of a Purcel holding in Smethcott, though John Purcel was in 1284 a Copar cener both in Acton Scott and Aldon. After 1255, where we should expect a Purcel holding in Smethcott, we find a Scot ; and yet it is clear that Scot was not Purcel's heir, for Reginald le Escot was in 1284 not only a Coparcener in Smethcott, without a Purcel, but was, with Purcel, a Coparcener in Acton Scott. Also, in 1292, Reginald le Scot and his wife Isabel stood side by side with John Purcel as Coparceners in Aldon.1* To explain this I am unable. I can only therefore add what I know of the Scots as successors, but not heirs, of Purcel in a third share of Smethcott. On December 28, 1320, Walter, son of Reginald de Scottes- Acton, remits and quit-claims, to William son of Walter le Budel of Longenolre, all his right in a moiety of the Vivary caUed Froggepol in Smethecote, which Vivary lies below the Marshe and (below) the wood of the said viU.

Philip de Smethcott, the third Coparcener of 1255, was a Juror for Condover Hundred at the Assizes of 1272, and is found attesting a Longnor Deed of the same year. In Easter Term 1280 he appears as that Lord of Smetecote whom Milisent, widow of Eudo la Zouche, seems to have singled out for prosecution when she claimed the service of half a knight's-fee in Smethcott as a Coheiress of Canti lupe.16 This Suit was still unsettled in February 1283, when the Sheriff was ordered to compel the presence of PhUip de Smethcott and other Cantilupe Tenants by distraint. In April 1283 PhUip de Smethcot appears on a local Jury. He was succeeded by a son Roger ; for I find Roger, son of Philip de Smethcote, quit-claiming to Haughmon Abbey a messuage and 11 acres in Cothercote. Witnesses, \u2014 Roger Sprencheose and Ranulph his brother, knights, Philip de Penniton and Reyner de Lee.17 In April 1290, January 1292, and at the Assizes of the latter year, I find Roger de Smethcott on local or Hundredal Juries. As a witness of numerous Deeds he occurs from 1292 tiU December 1320. He left two sons, PhUip and WU liam, as appears by the testing-clause of the foUowing Deed, which I take to be an arrangement between two Undertenants in Smeth cott. On December 15, 1323, it was thus agreed between Richard fitz Walter and Thomas fitz WiUiam, both of Smethcote. Richard de livers to Thomas for life a messuage and land in Smethcote which he, Richard, bought of Roger, son of Philip de Asthampton: \u2014 Thomas to pay 4s. 5c?. rent to Richard, and to liquidate all dues to the King and to the Lords of the Fee. Witnesses, \u2014 PhUip, son of Roger de Smethcote, WiUiam, his brother, Richard Tristram, Richard Faber of Smethcote, William de Bottefeld. It will further appear, under the Incumbents of Smethcott Church, that Roger de Smethcott left another son, Roger, a Clerk, also that a WiUiam de Smethcott was a joint Lord of Smethcott in 1354 and 15 Charter in possession of Sidney Steadman Smith, Esq.

Picklescott. \u2014 I have spoken of Robert fitz Madoc as having been enfeoffed early in the 13th century in half Picklescott, his Feoffors being the Coparceners of Smethcott. Robert fitz Madoc granted this moiety of Picklescott to the \" White Monks of Pole,\" as the Haughmond Chartulary expresses it, meaning the Cistercian Convent of Ystrat Marchel. The second Richard de Linley, with his daughter Alice, quit-claimed \" to God and St. Mary and to all the Saints, and to the Abbot and Monks of Pole, all their right in that part of the whole vill of Pikelescote which Robert Madoc had given, and which was of the fee of Alice's ancestors.\" The Abbot and Convent of Strattmarkel gave this land to Thomas Corbet of Caus, in exchange for certain land in the Haye of Thomas Corbet above Caus. Thomas Corbet, in turn, styling himself sou of Robert Corbet, gave aU his land of Pykel escot above mentioned to the Abbot and Convent of Haghmon in exchange for land at Eddes tan,18 belonging to Haghmon Abbey. The Abbot gave 8 oxen and 4 cows in addition, for cultivation of the land of Eddestan. This exchange, whereby the Abbot of Haughmond obtained half Pick lescott, was attested by John fitz Alan, Vivian dc Rossall, and Robert de Girros. From these names, and from other circumstances, I know it to have been made between 1227 and 1235. About the same time, or at all events before the year 1231, Hoel de Pikelescote (probably an Undertenant in the other moiety of this Vill) gave a noke therein to Haughmond. Witnesses, \u2014 John le Strange, Roger Sprenchose, and Phihp de Stepulton. In 1255 Madoc de Piclescote was the Tenant-in- fee of that moiety or residue of this Vill which had not previously been obtained by Haghmon Abbey. The Condover Hundred-Roll says that \" the Abbot of Haghmon and Madoc de Piclescote hold Piclescote for half a hide, and pay 4c?. per annum for stretward and motfee, and do suit to the Hundred.\" The Record adds that \"they held of the Fee of Roger Sprenchose.\"19 Probably therefore the joint Lords of Smethcott had conveyed their mesne interest in Picklescott to Sprenghose of Longnor ; or if such a complete conveyance was at that period technicaUy improbable, they had granted the ser vices of Hao-hmon Abbey and of Madoc de Piclescote to Spreng hose, to hold of themselves at some nominal rent.

Piclescot, I should observe, occurs on a local Jury in April 1253. At the Inquest of 1255 and at the Assizes of 1256, he was a Juror for Condover Hundred. Again in April 1264 he was empanelled on a Langley Inquest. At the Assizes of 1272 the Condover Jury reported one Roger fitz Baldwin of Piclescote as faUing in due attendance. He was possibly Madoc's successor. From this point I confine myself exclusively to the Abbot of Haughmond's interests here. Between 1264 and 1281, Walter Says quit-claims to Abbot Alan all right in that half-virgate in Piclescote which Gunilda his Grandmother sometime held. Witnesses, \u2014 Roger Sprenghose, WUliam de Stepultone, William Champneys of Dodintone. Also, in the same interval, Abbot Alan demises to Mabel, widow of Nicholas de Fredesleg, a noke in Piclescote, for which she had sued him under writ of right. She is to pay 20c?. rent, and to do suit of Court. Witnesses, \u2014 Richard BurneU, Lord of Langley, and William Marscote.20 The Taxationoi 1291 notices the Abbot of Haghmon's estate at Picklescote in conjunction with Lee Botwood. The particulars I have already given.21 On March 28, 1395, Ralph, Abbot of Highmon, leases to Roger Heighwey, his wife Joan, and their son WiUiam, two messuages and two nokes in Piclescote, reserving a rent of 6s. 6c?. and suit of the Abbot's Court of Boveria. In 23 Hen. VI. (1444-5) Abbot Richard demises the same premises to Roger Highway, Katherine his wife, and William their son, at a rent of 6s. 8c?. The Valor of Henry VIII., in giving the estates of Haughmon Abbey, must be taken to include Picklescote either under Lee Botwood or Boveria.

When he (Hugh fitz Turgis) received it, it was worth 10s.\"1 Of Hugh fitz Turgis I have spoken under Hope Bowdler, and said that his three Shropshire Manors were annexed to the Honour of Montgomery, as founded by Henry I.3 In the following narrative therefore, the Cotemporary Lords of Montgomery must uniformly be taken as Lords Paramount of WUderley. I have omitted to notice under Hope Bowdler that in 1195 Ivetta de Widerleg fined 5 merks that she might have judicial recog nition concerning the viU of Hope with its appurtenances. Of this fine she paid all but i merk in the year ending Michaelmas 1203. Her suit therefore was a different one to that of Richard de Wilderly already traced to its conclusion under Hope Bowdler. Of Ivetta's suit I hear no more, nor yet of a suit of mort d'ancestre, which Alan de Boulers had in October 1203 against Richard de Wildredeleg, and in which the latter had essoign.3 The said Richard was un doubtedly in that year Lord, under the Barons of Montgomery, of WUderley, Hope Bowdler, and, I may add, Cothercote. The enor mous outlay of 160 merks, by which he obtained this position, seems to have thrown him on his resources. In the year 1204 apparently, he sold Wilderley and Cothercote, for 126 merks, to Haughmond Abbey. By his Deed \" Richard de WUdredelega gives the whole land of WUdurley and of Codercote, with all liberties and appur tenances, to the Canons, who are to pay a rent of half a merk for the same after a term of 27 years complete, from the year of the In carnation 1204.

Witnesses,\u2014 Baldwin de Hodnet, Roger de Say. It was probably soon after the acquisition of this estate, that \" Richard, Abbot of Haghmon, at request of Reyner Bishop of St. Asaph, demised in fee-farm to Ithel, son of the said Bishop's Aunt (materter\u00e6), for his homage, a virgate in Wildurley,\" the said Bishop attesting the Deed. In 1226 Philip de Stapelton was found to have disseized the Abbot of Hageman of a tenement in Wyldridesle, viz. of 2 acres, bounded lengthways by the bosc of Wyldredesle \" and on each side by Hormoc and Kniormiok, and from thence to the Abbot's Haye.\" 6 The Quit-claims of PhUip de Stapleton and his son Robert, al ready recited under Stapleton, probably followed this decision and were in Ueu of damages. I see no reason for questioning the apparent date (1231-5) for the Charter or Charters whereby Stephen de Hope, and the other heirs of Richard de Wilderley confirmed their Father's grant to Haghmon, Stephen de Hope further quit-claiming the rent of half a merk which the Canons paid him for holding the said lands. Witnesses, \u2014 John fitz Alan, Robert de Girros, and Vivian de Rossall.6 In 1255 the Condover Hundred-RoU states that the Abbot of Hagmon holds Wildridleg, for two hides of land, of the fee of Hope Bothelers. The Manor paid 16c?. for stretward and motfee, and did suit (to County and Hundred) A This holding of the Fee of Hope Bowdler is a significant expression, which on a former occasion I explained rather loosely.8 It means that the service of one-fifth of a knight's-fee by which the Abbot of Haughmond held Wilderley was due immediately to the Lord of Hope Bowdler, and constituted so much of the whole fee by which the Lord of Hope Bowdler held under the Lord of Mont- 4 Powys Ledger, so. 102.

The earliest dated notice which I have of \" William de Champneis in Wylderle \" (as he is styled) is as a Juror on a Smethcott Inquest in April 1253. He had also a tenement in Cothercote which he gave to Haughmond Abbey. In one instance he attests a Haughmond Charter with Richard his son. In 1262, he was assessed for an imbladement within Regard of the Long Forest. In October 1274, he and his son Roger were fellow-jurors on a Caus Inquest. On November 3, 1281, a Fine was levied, whereby William Champeneys (Impedient) acknowledges that he has given to John Champeneys (Plaintiff) 2 messuages, lzz virgates of land, and 5 acres of meadow in Wil derdeleye, to hold at a rent of 5 merks, payable to the said William for his life, the Grantee performing all capital services. After the Grantor's death, John Champeneys, who pays 12 merks for the grant, is to hold the premises, quit of the aforesaid rent, and paying instead a rent of one Rose to the Grantor's heirs. This Fine will have had the effect of disinheriting the Grantor's heir, whom I take to have been that Richard le Champeneys who, in HUary Term 1283, was sued by Odo de Hodnet for some tres pass.12 Meantime I find the Grantee in the above Fine styled John Champeneys of Wilderley, and sitting on a Lythwood Inquest in July 1280.

Avenel, the Domesday Lord of Cothercote, held no other Shropshire Manor. His interest seems to have lapsed to the Crown, and the Manor to have been annexed by Henry I. to the Honour of Montgomery. I have shown, under Wilderley, how Richard de Wilderly, holding Cothercote under the then Lord of Montgomery, granted the Manor in 1204 to Haughmond Abbey. It is probable that, at the time of this grant, Richard de Wilderly had a Feoffee at Cothercote, who be came of course a Tenant of the Abbey. The said Feoffee or Tenant, early in the thirteenth century, was represented by one John de Cothercote, who was deceased in January 1243. This Umits the date of a Deed whereby John de Cudardecote, with consent of Baldwyn his son and heir, grants to Thomas son of Roger de Byriton with Alice his daughter in frank marriage, aU that land in the town and fields of Cudardecote which Roger the Smith held ; to hold to Thomas and his heirs under the Grantor and his heirs at a rent of l^c?., the Grantee to be responsible for forinsec services, but quit of pannage and toU.s In January 1243 a suit of dower, which Roger fitz Warin had against Wentlian, widow of John de Codardecot, is canceUed on the Plea-Roll, because the action would not lie ; that being, I conceive, the meaning of the words non jacet affixed to this entry.3 Baldwin de Cothercote, succeeding to his father John, seems to have been involved in pecuniary difficulties.

He also gave the Canons common pasture in Pulrebech except in the Bosc of Huglith. Witnesses, \u2014 John le Strange, Sir William de Hedleg, Sir Hugh fitz Robert.\" I cannot help suggesting here, that this Deed favours an idea that the Lords of Pulverbatch had not been very scrupulous on questions of boundary in this quarter, and had encroached on the Fee of the Lords of Montgomery at WUderley and Cothercote.6 In 1255 Pulverbatch had increased its Domesday hidage in a way which we cannot whoUy account for on any other supposition. At the same period, though it is true that Wilderley maintained its Domesday hidage, Cothercote and its half hide are wholly suppressed in the Survey of Condover Hundred. In fact Cothercote was no longer a distinct Manor. My belief is that the Domesday hidage of WUderley, as held in 1255 by Haughmond Abbey, was made up by the undeclared addition of Cothercote, and that an equivalent out of Wilderley-proper had been long before annexed to Pul verbatch. In 1291 the Abbot of Haghmon is registered as receiving 19s. 3c?. assized rents in Crodecot.6 His Assets from the same Vill at the Dissolution were \u00a34. 3s. 3c?., as already stated under Lee Botwood.7 TOfitotij.

All we know of the date of this transaction is that it was previous to the reign of Richard I., for then did the Monks of Wenlock withdraw the VU1 from Condover Hundred to their own Franchise. Such Freeholders as I shall name in the sequel were, I presume, Feoffees of Wenlock Priory. In 1177, Alured de Wiggewich had been amerced 2 merks for Forest-trespass by King Henry II. In 1185, Osbert fitz Richard of Widewic paid 2s. for a pourpresture in the Forest. At the Assizes of 1226 Warin de Wyggewych sued Imbert, Prior of Wenlock, for disseizing him of a, free tenement in Wygge wych, but in vain, for the Plaintiff proved to be a Tenant-in- Villainage.4 William de Wigwig was a Juror on the Inquest which in 1247 reported as to the tenures of the Prior's Burgesses at Wenlock. The Wenlock Hundred-Roll of 1255 accounts Wigwig as a member of Wenlock Manor. \"The Prior of Wenlock paid to the Abbot of Shrewsbury 20s. for the Vill and its appurtenances. William de Wigwig (himself a Juror on this Inquest) held half a carucate of land in the Vill of the Prior, and paid an annual rent of 16s., and did Suit to the Prior's Court by afforciament. He (or, I presume, his ancestors) used to do Suit to Condover Hundred before the reign of Richard I.\" The same change of suits is re ported in the case of Henry de Wigwig, who held a noke under the Prior at a rent of 29c?.6 This Henry dc Wigwig was probably the same with Henry fitz Adam, who in August 1257 was impleaded by Richolda de Wiggewyk for disseizing her of a tenement in Wiggewyk. 2 Domesday, so. 258, a, 1. 3 Supra, Vol. II. pp. 46-48. 4 Abbrev.

John Coly and Walter Par menter; but he was excused amercement at the instance of Roger le Strange.6 The Condover Hundred-Roll of 1255 hints, while the Roll of 1274 fully records, how Wigewike \" had once owed suit to the Greater Court of that Hundred, and how the Prior of Wenlock had withdrawn it to his Franchise.\"7 In December 1277 Henry de Wyggewig and Roger his brother occur as Jurors on a Benthall Tnquest.

This I have before alluded to.10 But in this valuation a carucate of fal low-land at Wyggewyk is valued separately as worth 3s. 4c?. per annum.11 At other times we find the income from Wigwig and Harley valued in conjunction with the Marsh Manor.12 At the Dissolution the Prior of Wenlock was receiving \u00a31. 16s. 8c?. for the ferm of a messuage and lands at Wigwyk and Harley, and 18s. for the ferm of tithes at Wigwyk and Harley.13 ptdtforti.

This is the more probable, as a branch of the great Roman road (the Watling Street) passed through the upper part of the Vill. Domesday describes the Manor as follows. \u2014 \" The same Turold holds Piceforde (of the Earl) . Edric, and Leuric, and Uluric held it (in Saxon times) for three Manors, and were free.

(per annum) ; afterwards it was worth 16s.; now it is worth 40s.\" It was probably Turold de Verley himself, rather than his son Robert, or one of their successors the Chetwynds, who first enfeoffed a Tenant in Pitchford. That Tenant's descendants, though they were also the descendants and heirs of Normannus Venator (Turold's equal in the scale of feudal tenures) , yet took a name from Pitchford in preference to Albrighton, or any other of those Manors which they held in capite of the Crown. This may, I think, be accounted for. \u2014 Ralph de Pichford (I.), who, be it remembered, distinguished himself at the siege of Bridgnorth, sixteen years after Domesday} is nowhere mentioned under any other name. It is probable, then, that he was called De Pichford at the time of the siege, and that his feoffment by Turold preceded that event. Now, as Norman Venator was living in 1093 and later, it is further probable that Ralph de Pichford was enfeoffed in Pitchford before he or his descendants became Norman Venator's heirs. This would account for their re taining the name of De Pichford, and not assuming a name more relevant to their greater feudal pretensions. Of Ralph de Pichford and his descendants I have already given account under Bridgnorth, Albrighton, and Ryton. Some circum stances of their history, in connection with Pitchford itself, remain to be told. We have it on credible authority that Pitchford Church was founded by a Ralph dc Pichford.2 If so, we are bound to attri- 1 Supra, Vol. I. pp. 354-5.

Hence it is most unwarrantably assumed that this Engelard was the Incumbent in ques tion, and that Richard was the real founder of Pitchford Church. The truth is, that 2 See History of Shrewsbury, II. pp. 183, 184. The document quoted by the Historians of Shrewsbury states that Ralph de Pyche ford presented his brother Engelard to the recently-founded Church. In a note"], [725, "269 PITCHFORD, bute the credit of this work to Ralph de Pichford (I.), and to fix its date in the time of Henry I., or Stephen. The arguments which would assign it to Richard de Pichford (I.), and to the reign of Henry IL, needlessly assume that an erroneous name has been given in an original document, and are otherwise fallacious. Ralph de Pichford (I.) was succeeded, as I have elsewhere shown, by a Son, and Grandson, both named Richard. The grant of Pitch ford MiU to Haughmond Abbey by Richard de Pichford (II.) has been fully set forth.3 A Fine of 1199 by Hugh de Pichford relates partly to Pitchford, and has also been given.* Hugh de Pichford married Burga daughter and heir of Ralph cle Baskerville, by his wife Isabel,5 which Isabel was, I find from a Record of 1203-4, called Isabel de Say ; but it does not appear whether Say was her maiden name, or the name of a second husband. By this match it would seem that Hugh de Pichford acquired mesne interests in a number of estates. I may instance Herberbury and Chesterton in Warwickshire, Sutton-on-the-HUl in Derbyshire, and Snareston and Swannington in Leicestershire.0 All these were held of the Fief of the Earl Ferrars, and we can trace a subsequent interest of the Pichfords, their Feoffees, or then connections, in all of them. At the Salop Assizes of October 1203, Hugh de Piceford essoigned his attendance under the general summons. In March 1209 he was assessed under two several Regards of the Long Forest. He died, as I have said, in 1211 or 1212. Besides his son and heir Ralph (IL), he left a son WiUiam, and, I think, a daughter IsabeUa, who had Snareston in Leicestershire. Who was the husband of IsabeUa, I Engelard brother of Richard de Pichford was no Clerk, but a Knight, \u2014 was, in fact, that famous Engelard de Stretton whose history I have given under Ryton.

Nichols's Leicestershire, TV.* p. 980. The same note of the Historians of Shrewsbury presents another phase of this question. It is assumed that the original document, in giving Ralph as the name of the Founder of Pitchford Church, must have alluded to Ralph (II.) , whose \u00e6ra we know to have been from 1212 to 1252. But I do not see why the original docu ment should be thus construed to indicate Ralph (II.) rather than Ralph (I.). There are bits of masonry in the walls of Pitch ford Church which are much more likely to belong to the reign of Henry I., or of Stephen, than to that of John, or of Mr. Blakeway associates the Leicester shire tenures of the Pichfords with their arms (a einquefoil), which he justly remarks was the bearing of the old Earls of Lei cester. I look upon the coincidence as a mere accident. The Pichfords had pro bably borne the Cinquefoil before their connection with Leicestershire ; and that connection would have rather resulted in their bearing Baskervill or Ferrars arms, than those of De Bellomont."], [726, "270 PEDIGREE OF PICHFORD, OF ALBRIGHTON, PITCHFORD, ETC.

Her son called himself Richard de Picheford, and sometime between 1230 and 1252 he enfeoffed one Simon de Bere ford in all that land of Snarkeston which came to him of the inhe ritance of Isabel de Picheford his Mother. This feoffment was for a penny rent and for 15 merks paid down. Ysabella de Picheford was living at the time; for she in a separate charter confirmed her son's grant.7 I have already alluded to a contest in 1226, between Warner de Wililey and Ralph de Pichford (II.), about this Manor.8 The latter appointed his brother William his Attorney in the matter.9 This was a contest between two Feoffees of the House of Chetwynd, and between two families which afterwards intermarried ; but there must be a deeper significancy in the incident, and I can hardly doubt that the families of Wililey and Pichford were previously and otherwise related. By Fine of November 3, 1236, Agnes daughter of Ulger de Piche ford (Plaintiff) quits, for one merk, to Ralph de Picheford (Tenant) a claim to a carucate and messuage in Picheford, which she had sued for under writ of mort d'ancestre. Ralph de Pichford made a grant to Lilleshall Abbey, viz. of a rent of 8s. which was his right, arising from the Fishery of Brug (Bridgnorth), and from the lands pertaining thereto.10 The Inquest ordered April 20, 1253, on the death of Ralph de Picheford, states him to have held the Manor of Picheford by ser vice of half a knight's-fee, under John de Chetwynd. The deceased had 4 carucates in demesne, \u2014 value \u00a34>. per annum. His assized rents were \u00a36. 2s. 7\\d. What with a Mill, two gardens, some meadow land, a Wood, a Vivary, income from Tallages, and the rent of a virgate of land (which was not strictly a part of Pitchford Manor), the whole estate was valued at \u00a316. 12s. Id. The Condover Hun dred-Roll of 1255 reports that \" Ralph fitz Nicolas holds Pichford, for three hides, in virtue of the guardianship of John son and heir of Ralph de Pichford, which guardianship Ralph fitz Nicholas had from the King.\" Pichford was of the Fee of Sir John de Chete- crusily fitchee, Zfleur de Us Sa.

De Pichford's mesne interest is here ignored. It is worth noting that these Berefords bore for arms \u2014 Arg. 8 Supra, Vol. II. p. 55. \u00bb Rot. Claus.

I have an impression that he and the Pichfords were related. I must, however, dismiss that question in a note,14 and state who Ralph fitz Nicholas was. His real name was Pipard.15 He was Seneschal in 1218 to the Earl Ferrars, and afterwards to King Henry III. He enjoyed a goodly proportion of Crown patronage. He died in 1257, and was succeeded by his sonRobert in various estates in Derby shire, Warwickshire, Leicestershire, Wiltshire, Suffolk, and Sussex. A word now as to Adam Talbot, who married the Widow, and, as I think, the second wife, of Ralph de Pichford. Whoever he was, we are told that he had a son William, and that the latter was in 1278 Lord of Swannington (Leicestershire).16 Now Swannington was a Pichford Manor ; at least, earlier in the century, one William de Pichford (probably a cadet of the Shropshire House) was put down as Mesne Lord (under the Earls Ferrars) of Swannington and Overton Sawcey.17 Such coincidences are worth noting, though always to explain them is neither within my power nor my province. 11 \u25a0 12 Rot. Hundred. II. 62, 63. wiclcsh., Thomas's Edition, p. 582). This was precisely the blazonry of one of the coats in an Albrighton window. 13 Supra, Vol. II. p. 152. 14 Both Ralph fitz Nicolas and the Pichfords were descended through females from Baskerville. Both too inherited Baskerville estates (Dugdale's Warwick shire, p. 50). Both held imder the Earls Ferrers. The son of Ralph fitz Nicholas named a Pichford as his Surety in 1268. Again, the Arms of Pipard (Ralph fitz Nicholas's family) are given as Arg. two barsgu., on a canton az., a cinques oil or, \u2014 and such arms occur, mixed with Pich ford arms, in the way already alluded to under Albrighton (Vol. II. p. 165, note 60). I may add to these heraldic evidences, that Dugdale gives the following Coat from the Chancel- Window of Long Compton, Warwickshire, where the Pipards had an interest. The coat is Arg. two bars az., and a canton with a rose (Hist, of War- 15 Burton (Antiquities of Leicester shire, pp. 210, 211) gives Ralph fitz Ni cholas's name as Wichard, and his Arms as Az., a chevron Arg. between four (or three) martlets or.

The Arms which Burton gives for Talbot are those which he had before assigned to Bereford (supra, note 7), except that Talbot's fleurs de-lis are Gules. \" Testa de Nevill, p. 95."], [729, "273 PITCHFORD. I believe that the first wife of Ralph de Pichford was Margery, a daughter of John le Strange (II.) of Nesse and Cheswardine, and further that they had a daughter, Burgia, who became the wife of Nicholas de Wililey. Except on these suppositions, I cannot explain a deed whereby Nicholas de Willilegh, with the assent and will of Burgia his wife, sells to Sir John le Strange all that land in the Vill of Lucam (Lytcham, Norfolk) which the Father ofthe said John gave for the frank marriage of Ralph de Pichford with Margery his daugh ter.18 This deed is without date, and the witnesses are not given, so that I may only state it to have passed between 1238 and 1255. John de Pichford, son and successor of Ralph, was, I think, his son by a second wife. Coming of age in 1258, he seems to have es poused the same political cause as his ill-fated nephew, Andrew de Wililey, and his no less unfortunate father-in-law, William Devereux. However, a patent dated at Kenilworth on July 11, 1266, spared him the consequences of rebellion. The King remitted all his wrath at John de Pichford's conduct during the late disturbances, and ordered that he should not be molested in respect of his possessions. On Sunday, April 30, 1273, John de Pychford was one of the wit nesses who appeared before the King's Council at Westminster to give evidence as to the age of George de Cantilupe, then claiming his livery. Pychford's statement accorded with that of previous witnesses. His knowledge on the subject arose thus ; \u2014 he had married a daughter of William Devereux, and, his wife being a cousin of George de Cantilupe's,19 he (Pychford) had been led to make inquiries about the age of the latter.

It is more than probable that this mortgage was redeemed or cancelled. Archbishop Giffard was maternal Uncle of John de Pichford's wife. On August 16, 1283, Sir John de Pychford was one of the Knights selected to make a perambula tion between Longden and Pulverbatch. The Inquest taken April 25, 1285, after his death, states him to have held the VillofPyche ford, by a fourth-part of a Knight's-fee, under the Heirs of John de Chetewynde. The service personally due on Pycheford was that of one man doing Castle-guard at Oswestry for 10 days, a coincidence of Chetwynd's tenure being, not, like his Ancestor Turold's, a tenure in-capite, but under Fitz Alan. Pycheford was on this oc casion valued at \u00a312. 14*. 4d. per annum.23 In the hands of Mar garet the Widow, and Ralph the son and heir of John de Pychford, the Shropshire estates of the elder line of this family were utterly alienated. If Ralph de Pychford (III.) left any Descendants, I think it probable that they settled in Ireland. At the Assizes of October 1292, Roger Careles, of whom we have heard under Albrighton, was admitted as Attorney for Ralph de Pycheford, the latter having gone to Ireland by license of the Crown.2i At the same time Margaret widow of John de Pyche ford was sued for disseizing Richard de Eton of estovers in 300 acres of bosc. It was found however that no hindrance had been suffered by the Plaintiff.25 In 1298, as we have already seen, Walter de Langton, Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry, commenced a series of acquisitions in Shropshire with the purchase of Tasley from the Corbets.20 On January 27, 1301, a Fine was levied between the said Bishop (Plaintiff) and Ralph de Pychford (Deforciant) of the Manor of Pychford, whereof was a Plea of Convention. Ralph de Pychford's quit-claim was purchased for \u00a3100. The Bishop, by a second Fine, bought up the life-interest of Ralph de Pychford's mother. The Fine itself purports to be between the Bishop and Margery, widow of John de Pychford, of the Manor of Pychford, whereof was plea of charter-warranty. Margery acknowledges that the Manor is the Bishop's by her gift, to hold to him aud his heirs under the chief lords of the fee. In return the Bishop covenanted to pay \u2022\u25a0' Inquisitions, 13 Edw. I., No. 14. I 5 recto. 24 \u25a0 2a Assizes, 20 Edw. I., mm. 1 dorso, I * Supra, Vol. I. p. 97."], [731, "275 PITCHFORD. Margery a life annuity of \u00a328., and gave, in case of his failing so to do, a power of distress on the Manor.27 This Fine has an indorse ment intimating that William Grandison, Sibil his wife, and John la Ware opposed (that is, sunk) their claim. It is difficult to account for this indorsement in the case of Pitchford, though it is intelli gible enough in the cotemporary Fine already given, where the Bishop purchases the Advowson of Albrighton, the Manor, and some land there, having been already sold to John de Tregoz, whose heirs indorse the Fine.28 Possibly Ralph de Pychford's sale to Sir John de Tregoz had been carelessly defined, and the transaction needed a full and legal adjustment. It is also possible that the parties concerned in the purchase of Pychford's Shropshire inheri tance were not all aliens in blood to the Vendors. Still these sales or transfers excluded the elder representatives of Norman Venator from their position in Shropshire, and thus closed the history of a Domesday Fief, if not a Domesday Barony. In the Nomina Villarum of 1316 the Bishop of Chester stands enrolled as Lord of Pycheford.29 On July 4, 1317, the date of a letter informs us of his being resident here. Bishop Langton died in November 1321. An Inquisition held December 17, 1321, found him to have held the Manor of Pichford under Sir John de Chete wynde for half a knight's-fee. The following extent thereof is given : \u2014 A capital messuage, worth 3*. 4d.

The last was under Sir John de Chetwynd by service of one-fourth of a knight's-fee. John Peverel, son and heir of the deceased, was aged one year on May 19, previous.31 This John died apparently without issue, for Margaret sister and heir of John Peverel of Castle Ashby (Northants) married William de la Pole.32 From them, through females, de scended the Lords Cobham ; but whereas William de la Pole sold his interest at Pitchford in 1358 to Sir Nicholas Burnel, I shall no further pursue my account of the Lords of this Manor. Of Undertenants in Pitchford some have been incidentally mentioned already. Between 1176 and 1206 Richard, Abbot of Haghmon concedes to Hugh, the son-in-law of Osbert, and to Juliana his wife, that half-virgate which they already held in Piche ford, to hold at a fee-farm rent of 2s. Witnesses, \u2014 Hugh, Lord of Pychefort, and William fitz Pichot.33 Pitchford Mill, as we have seen elsewhere, was first granted to, and then surrendered by, the same Abbey, in exchange for land at Bridgnorth.34 We have had mention of Adam de Pichford, in 1235,35 and in 1249 one Henry de Pichford fines one merk for license to accord in some lawsuit. Ulger de Pichford, whose daughter Agnes has been mentioned above, in a Quit-claim of 1236, had, it seems, five other daughters, viz. Emma, Juliana, Isabella, Alice and Margery. Of these Emma fitz Wolger, as she is called, married Robert Scot, to whom Ulger, Emma's father, gave, or is said to have given, half a messuage and 50 acres in Pitchford in frank-marriage. Emma dying issueless, Robert Scot remarried one Juliana, but enfeoffed Ralph de Pichford (II.) in the premises. Robert Scot then died, and in 1272 Juliana his widow and John de Picheford were holding the premises in such sort as that the latter was Juliana's Warrantor in the Suit which then came on. The said suit was instituted by Juliana fitz Wolger and Richard son of Isabella (fitz Wolger), claiming to be heirs (jointly with the representatives of a third and fourth daughter of Wolger) of Emma fitz Wolger. They sued only for half the premises, because William son of Alice (fitz Wolger) and Alice daughter of Margery (fitz Wolger) refused to join in the 31 Inquisitions, 5 Edw. III., No. 46.

John de Pichford's defence was, that Emma fitz Wolger did not die seized of the premises, for that her husband, to whom Wolger had given them, survived her, and enfeoffed his (John's) father Ralph therein.36 The result of the Trial does not appear. Robert BurneU's purchase of 60 acres in Pichford from Martin and Elina de Burchton has been given under the year 1272, and in my account of Acton Burnell.87 We have Thurstan de Pichford sitting on a local Jury in July 1280, and the same person (with Richard his son) attesting a Golding Deed in 1294. This Thurstan de Pichford, by Deed, gave to God and St. Mary and St. Michael, of the Church of Pichford, a messuage and three acres of land in pure and perpetual almoign, \u2014 the messuage, namely, which Robert le Moot formerly held.38 Beche and Newton. \u2014 These Vills, whether members of Pitch ford or of Little Eaton, cannot now be traced, but they probably lay on the bank of the Condover Brook, opposite Eaton Mascott. Of the Tenants of Beche I have given some account in speaking of Eaton Mascott Mill. A Fine of November 8, 1248, relates to Beche, and enables us to show to what John de Pichford alluded in 1272, when he stated that Robert Scot had enfeoffed Ralph de Pich ford in 50 acres at Pichford. The Fine is between Ralph cle Piches ford, Plaintiff, and Robert le Scot, Tenant of a virgate in Pichesford. Robert surrenders it to Ralph, and the latter concedes 35 acres in La Beche to Robert ; \u2014 to hold for life only, at a rent of 8s., and by per formance oiforinsec services. The terms of this fine render it pro bable that Robert le Scot was hurrying to smother the question of title by involving his Suzerain in the matter, and accepting a very inadequate consideration. By another Fine ofthe same date, Robert son of Henry de Preston, with Isabella his wife, suing for 35 acres in La Beche, under Writ of mort d'ancestre, quit-claim the same to Ralph de Pichesford for half a merk. These Fines I have given in an order inverse of that in which they were levied ; for it is clear that the 35 acres, thus acquired by Ralph de Pichford, were those which he forthwith conveyed to Robert le Scot.

PITCHFORD CHURCH. With regard to the Foundation of this Church I cannot do better than translate the ancient and authoritative document already alluded to.39 \u2014 \" Memorandum : \u2014 That, before the Foundation of the Church of Pycheford, and before the Constitutions of Lyons, certain men, who were then of the Lordship of Pycheford, went to different Churches in the neighbourhood, to hear divine service and to receive the Sacraments, aud bestowed their tithes where they chose, as it was lawful for them to do before the aforesaid Constitutions. Hence, at that period the men of Little Eton, Newton, and Beche gave their tithes to the Dean and Chapter of the Collegiate Church of St. Chad, Salop, on condition that they should provide for the said men a Chaplain and Clerk, a Chalice and vestments, and all things neces sary towards celebrating divine services three days a week at Eton, in a certain Oratory set apart by them for that purpose, and that the said Chaplain should undertake the duties of hearing confessions, visiting the sick, baptizing infants, and administering all other Sacra ments to the said people. At length there arose a certain Lord of Pycheford, Radulf by name, who, on account of the many (spiritual) dangers which were constantly arising in respect of an insufficient visitation of the sick and the distance of infants from baptism, moved with pious charity and holy zeal, built a Church at Pyche ford, procured it to be consecrated, and presented Engelard his own brother thereto, which Engelard was instituted and inducted therein at the said presentation. And whilst the institution of Engelard was yet in force, contentions and suits arose, and daily increased, between him and the aforesaid Dean and Chapter concerning tithes and other obventions. At length they came to the following agree ment, viz. that the Dean and Chapter should receive the great pre dial tithes and a heriot, and that all other tithes and obventions what ever should remain with the said Engelard aud his successors for ever, on condition of their discharging the aforesaid duties.\" It seems, from the comments passed by the Historians of Shrews bury on this Document, that the Council held at Lyons in 1274 3'J Supra, pp. 268, 269, note. See Hist. Shrewsbury, II. p. 184, note."], [735, "279 THE CHURCH. passed a formal, but now lost, enactment agaiust the arbitrary con secration of tithes, that is, denying the right of any person or persons to bestow their tithes elsewhere than on the Mother Church of the Parish wherein such tithes arose. It seems to me that such a right of alienation has never been universally acknowledged in England since the words tithes and parishes were first heard of. Many instances of arbitrary consecration of tithes may perhaps be cited from the history of the half-century following the Conquest ; but if so, these were Norman innovations, and the general rule was, that the great tithes of a parish belonged to the Mother Church of that Parish, or to those who obtained an appropriation of the Mother Church. On these grounds, and with the aid of analogous cases, I put a very different interpretation on the above document to that which the Historians of Shrewsbury suggest. The Vill of Little Eaton, near Pitchford, is now destroyed ; but in Saxon times and at the date of Domesday it belonged, as a distinct Manor, to the Church of St. Chad. Now, we remember that Dictum of the Monks of Wen lock which received the sanction of the Viceroy Belmeis in the reign of Henry I.40 The Dictum was, that \" all St. Milburg's land con stituted but one Parish ;\" and we have seen that \" St. Milburg's land\" involved many more localities than those which the Church of St. Milburg held by the secular tenure recorded in Domesday. I conceive, then, that the Saxon Church of St. Chad asserted a spi ritual jurisdiction analogous to that of the Church of St. Milburg, that St. Chad's Manor of Little Eaton was in fact held by the Canons to be a part of St. Chad's Parish, and that the Parish in cluded Newton and Beche. Legally therefore, and not, as the above document would suggest, at their own discretion, did the inhabitants of these three Vills pay their tithes to the Canons of St. Chad, and very properly did the Canons in return maintain, first an Oratory, and then a Chapel at Little Eaton. But when (as I con ceive in the time of Henry I., or of Stephen) Ralph de Pichford founded a Church at Pitchford, it became the interest of the men of Little Eaton, Newton, and Beche to second his design; for, as I shall show, he was secularly their Suzerain, holding mediately between them, on the one hand, and the Church of St. Chad, or the Lord of Chetwynd, on the other. The disputes which ensued were natural, the settlement still more so. The Rector of Pitchford o-ot the small tithes and Oblata of Little Eaton, Newton, and Beche ; '\" Supra, Vol. III. p. 232."], [736, "280 PITCHFORD. and the Canons of St. Chad got rid of their spiritual responsibilities in the district. Nothing above-said touches, or is intended to touch, the question as to what Parish Pitchford itself was in, before it had a Church. On this point I can only suggest Cound ; and it is probable that Ralph de Pichford had to make an agreement with the Rector of Cound in composition of a second claim to spiritual subjection. In this, as in hundreds of other cases, all evidence of the agreement is lost. Pensions of a few shillings, the usual tokens of original affiliation, are, from their very nature and the changed value of money, more likely to become obsolete than to be perpetuated. The Taxation of 1291 gives the Church of Picheford (in the Diocese of Lichfield and Coventry, and the Deanery of Salop) as annually worth \u00a35.41 On July 4, 1326, we have good evidence that the Canons of St. Chad were in receipt of the great tithes of Little Eton, Neuton, and Beche.42 In 1341 the Assessors of the Ninth taxed the Parish of Pychford at \u00a32. They stated that, when the Church-Taxation of \u00a35. had been calculated, there were more sheep in the Parish, and that now there were only 60 sheep. Moreover, the glebe, oblations, and small tithes of the Church amounted to \u00a32.; and three carucates of the demesne of Pychford were lying unfilled.43 The Valor of 1534-5 gives Roger Otteley as Rector of Pyche fforde; and his preferment as \u00a36. 13s. 4d. per annum, less 6s. 8c?. for procurations, and Is. 4d. for synodals.44 EARLY INCUMBENTS. Engelard de Pichford, the first Rector of this Church, lived probably in the reign of Stephen. Richard Clerk of Pichefor, is hypothetically placed by Mr. Blakeway on the list of Incumbents. It is added that he became a Burgess of Shrewsbury in 11 John (1209-10), a fact which should in my opinion exclude him from this bst. Master Robert de Pichford, Canon of St. Edith's, Tamworth, and Parson of Hoginton and Picheford, occurs in September 1294.45 On Dec. 18, 1311, Bishop Langton commits custody of this bene- fice, then sequestered, to \u2014 41 Pope Nich.

The Monument, of which an engraving is annexed, belongs to a class not very numerous, and of that class it is one of the finest spe cimens to be found in England.49 The figure (full seven feet in stature) and the slab on which it reclines are formed from one solid trunk of dark oak. In contemplating this august memento of a past \u00e6ra, the spectator first and most naturally inquires whom it is supposed to represent. Seldom can a concise and positive answer be given to such inquiries. The study of uninscribed Monuments, though it may afford pleasure to the literary wrangler or the careless speculator, brings small satis faction to a responsible author. With a full certainty that I can prove nothing about the Pitch ford monument, I cannot consistently suppress my ideas on the sub ject, however open they may be to contradiction. In the present instance we have three evidences to guide or to perplex us, as the case may be. These are (1) the Tradition of the neighbourhood, (2) the Costume of the Effigy, and (3) the Armorial bearings on the side of the monument. As to Tradition, though I have somewhere heard it said or sug gested that this was the Monument of Sir Hugh de Pichford, I refer with more confidence to the tradition of the last Century, as certified 49 Berrington Church contains the monumental effigy of a Knight, wrought in wood like that at Pitchford, but differ ing in many respects, and especially in not having been nearly so well preserved. Tra- dition (very improbably, I think) assigns this monument to a Berrington. It has neither armorial insignia nor inscription.

Now there were three Ralphs of this family; and if one of them be really represented in this Effigy, I should judge from the costume of the figure that it was he who died in 1252. The Shields which adorn the side of this Monument are these. 1. Semee of crosses, a cinquefoil pierced (Pichford). 2. A fesse and in chief three Roundels (Devereux). 3. Semee of mullets and a cinquefoil, all pierced (Pichford).51 4. A chevron between three Roundels (Baskervill) . 5. Fretty. 6. A Lion rampant. 7. Five barrulets. Now the first and third of these Coats are undoubtedly those of Pichford, aud should be blazoned thus, (1) Az., a cinquefoil or., pierced gu., between 8 crosses of the second, (3) Az., a cinquefoil or., pierced gu. between 7 mullets of the second, pierced of the field. The second shield is unquestionably that of Devereux, and should be blazoned \u2014 Arg. a fesse gu., and in chief 3 torteaux. The fourth shield, that of Baskervill, should be blazoned, \u2014 Arg., a chevron gu. between 3 heurts. On the fifth, sixth, and seventh coats I offer neither comment nor conjecture here. The coats (1) and (2), from their position at the head of the figure, are the leading features of the series. They are allusive to the marriage of John de Pichford with Margaret Devereux. Ac cording to their evidence, then, the monument is that of Sir John de Pichford, who died in 1285; and I see nothing in the costume of the knight's figure subversive of such an idea. The coats (3) and (4) must be taken for those of John de Pichford's Grandfather and Grandmother, viz. of Hugh de Pichford and Burga de Baskerville, who was an heiress. Consequently there are no coats left which we can reasonably assign to Ralph de Pichford and to his wife Margery le Strange, whose shield would have been charged with Two Lions passant. Now, though we often find a person's monument orna mented with the armorial achievements of his children, I cannot conceive that this was done to the exclusion of the arms of himself and his wife. On the whole, then, we may say that Tradition (uncontradicted 50 The Reverend Edward Williams (see MS. 21, 236, p. 6, Brit. Museum). where with a Semee of Martlets and of Cross-crosslets.

Of these two alternatives I cannot hesitate to prefer the latter.53 Leaving this interesting but perplexing subject, I have one or two miscellaneous matters to notice in conclusion. At the close of the last Century the three following Shields were decypherable on Quarries in the floor of Pitchford Church. (1) Quarterly, per fesse indented. (2) Quarterly, per fesse indented, a bend over all. (3) Fretty.53 The second of these Coats will claim particular attention in a future Chapter. Pitchford contains one more monument ofthe remote \u00e6ra to which my researches are confined. Tradition says that the ancient and gi gantic Lime Tree which adorns the precinct of Pitchford Hall has been known for centuries as The Tree with a house in it}* The House has been carefully maintained,55 though, in the annexed Illus tration, the Engraver omits that feature. Perhaps it was well to preserve the venerable simpbcity of an object which, had it memory and utterance, could bear witness on all those questions in the early history of Pitchford and its Lords, Which I regretfully leave unsolved. iUttlt eattrn. Domesday mentions this Manor very briefly. \u2014 \" The Church of 62 I have not thought it necessary in the above remarks to advert to the very exceptional case, where a monument may be supposed to have been erected to some famous personage long after his decease, and so may bo expected to exhibit de tails of costume and ornament which were appropriate only to the \u00e6ra of such erection. The best, perhaps the only well ascertained, instance of this is the oaken effigy of Robert Courteheuse in Gloucester Cathedral.

Its site is unknown, much more the site of its Oratory or Chapel, which was probably disused seven hundred years ago. The Canons of St. Chad probably took Turold for their Tenant of Etone, as being Lord of Pitchford. To him the tenure must have been an object. When the Pichfords were enfeoffed in Pitchford, the tenure of Chetwynd under St. Chad vanishes, and the Pichfords held Little Eaton immediately of the Church. So I inter pret a statement in the Inquisition taken in 1253 on the death of Ralph de Pichford (II.) . \" He held,\" says the Record, \"one virgate under the Chapter of St. Chad, Salop. The rents he received from this virgate were j\u00a3l. 9s. 6\\d.,\" but his chief-rent to St. Chad' is not stated, and was perhaps merely nominal. A family, which took its name from the place, seems to have held Little Eaton, or a great part thereof, under the Pichfords, for several generations ; but the names Eton, Eaton, and Eyton, being synonymous, are often interchanged in ancient documents, and were common in Shropshire. I shall only notice here such persons as I am assured belonged to the locality before us. We have Uger de Eton and Oliver his brother attesting a Deed of Hugh de Pichford's about 1192-4.2 Again we have Richard de Etun as Juror on a Pulley Inquest in 1249 ; and the same person, printed as Richard de Ston, was on the Inquest of Condover Hundred in 1255. At the Assizes of 1256 Richard de Eton again appears on the Jury of that Hundred. I find him also on a local Inquest in May 1259. In 1262 and 1271 we have had mention, under Ruckley and Langley, of Richard son of Richard de Eton.3 This second Richard de Eton was probably he who was amerced 20s. at the Assizes of 1272 for not joining in some recognition or view when empanelled. Yet he was one of the two Electors of the Condover Jury on this occasion. He sat on neighbouring Inquests in December 1273 and 1 Domesday, so. 253, a, 1. \u2014 However, I cannot help thinking that, in Saxon times, St Chad's had held all its lands under the Bishop of Chester, and I question whether such a Seigneury was likely to be interfered with by the Norman Earl. I have, in the Table of Condover Hun dred (supra, p. 2), put down St. Chad's Church as holding Etone under Earl Roger. The Record itself does not state as much ; but wherever a Shropshire Tenure is not certified to be held de Rege, the usual inference is that it was held de Comite. - Supra, Vol. I. p. 359. 3 Supra, pp. 143, 147."], [746, "286 CANTLOP.

We have further had Richard de Eton attesting a Golding Deed in 1294,4 which is perhaps the most pertinent mention of the name which I could offer, seeing that the Deed is by Ralph de Pichford (III.), whose Vassal Richard de Eton probably was. Lastly, we have had frequent mention of another Richard de Eton, occurring from 1310 to 1333, and whom I conceive to have been of this place. Of Newton and Beche, possibly members of Little Eaton, but now lost like itself, I have said enough under Eaton Mascott and Pitchford.5 Cantlojh It will serve much to perspicuity if, after noticing the two Manors in which De Pichford was a Tenant of De Chetwynd, or of St. Chad, we proceed with one of the Manors which he held of the Crown and as Heir of Normannus Venator. But before I proceed I should say a word about the natural but false idea which has associated this Vill with the illustrious name of Cantilupe. The Cantilupes, as Lords of the Honour of Montgomery, had many estates in Shropshire, and even in the neigbourhood before us. They had also a Tenant-interest in Brace Meole, acquired by an other title, and such a title as might perhaps, per se, comport with the notion that they drew their origin from some Shropshire lo cality. But the race of Cantilupe was famous before it was known in Shropshire. They were Normans undoubtedly, taking their name from one of those Vills of Cantilupe of which the Duchy con tained several. These Norman Vills were called Cantilupe, I sup pose, by the original settlers, whose labours of clearance or occu pation had been inordinately disturbed by the \" wolf's long howl\" resounding from adjacent forests. The Shropshire Vill of Cantlop must not be associated with any such etymology. The Norman Scribes who wrote Domesday, prone as they were to Norman forms of speech, registered Cantlop with Saxon simplicity and in the fol lowing terms. \u2014 \"Normannus holds Cantelop of Earl Roger. Edric held it (in 4-6 Supra, pp. 101, 106, 277."], [747, "287 CANTLOP. Saxon times), and was a free man. Here is one hide, geldable. The (arable) land is enough for iiii ox-teams.

In King Edward's time the Manor was worth 20s. ; afterwards it was worth \u00a34. 10s. (per annum) : now it is worth 110s.\"1 Before I enter on a succession of details as to the Tenure of this Manor in the thirteenth century, it will be better to give a sum mary statement. It was divided at some unrecorded period by Nor mannus, or by one of his successors. The Feoffee of one moiety was some ancestor of the hereditary Foresters of Bolas, the Feoffee of the other moiety was some Ancestor of the Arundels of Tet neshull and Merebrook. In the thirteenth century the share of the Foresters of Bolas went in marriage with a daughter of their House to Longslow of Longslow, and Arundel's share was sold to the Burnels. Now, the earliest known ancestor of the Foresters of Bolas was Ulger Venator, one of the three persons entrusted by Robert de Belesme with the defence of Bridgnorth in 1102. The first Ralph de Pichford was cotemporarily distinguished in the siege of that Castle and on the side of the King. That the Castle was surren dered in consequence of friendly communications between the Chiefs on either side, we know full well. The Defendants were further bribed by a promise of lands, to be given by the King. We know that Ulger Venator obtained such lands from the Crown. I have already given most of these facts. I have suggested, from the his tory of Little Brug and of Lee Brockhirst, that Ulger Venator was related both to Norman Venator and to the first Ralph de Pich ford.3 Here, under Cantlope, we find a fact strongly supporting such a theory. Ulger's descendants were the Feoffees of Norman's heirs. Surely Ulger himself got half Cantlope in the time of Henry I. by feoffment of Norman Venator, or of Ralph de Pichford. The son and heir of Ulger Venator was William fitz Ulger, living in 1156; the son and heir of William fitz Ulger was the author of the following Deed, which passed about 1177-1187. \" I Robert fitz William, have given to the Abbey of Shrewsbury half the Mill of Cantelhope which William my Father in my presence bequeathed to the said Abbey.

This was in 1203, and Hugh fitz Robert was married in 1213 or 1214, and died in 1249. Hugh fitz Robert seems to have given his share of Cantlop in frank marriage with one Alice (probably his daughter) to Hugh de Wlan keslaue (i. e. Longslow). I think this was before the year 1228, and that Hugh de Longslow is the person called Hugh de Wittokes lawe in the following Fine. On May 31, 1228, one Walter fitz Walter, having impleaded Hugh de Wittokeslawe and Ahce his wife, under writ of mort d'ancestre, for half a virgate in Cantelop, obtained a recognition of his right, viz. to hold it, he and his heirs, under Hugh and Alice and their heirs, at a rent of 2s. For this Walter paid half a merk. A comparison of dates leads me to suppose that, if this Alice was Hugh fitz Robert's daughter, she must have been daughter of a previous wife to the one whom he married in 1213-4. In 1253 we have Hugh de Wlonkeslow as Foreman of a Langley Inquest. In 1255 the Condover Hundred- Roll says that \" Hugh de Wlonkesloy and John de Arundel hold Cantolop for one hide of the fee of Pichford, and pay 8d. per annum for stretward and motfee, and do suit to the Hundred.\"4 The expression here used, the fee of Pichford, is calculated to mislead. Cantlop as a Manor had no connection with Pitchford except that the Seignoral Lord of Cantlop was Tenant Lord of Pitchford. The Fee of Albrighton or the Fief of De Pichford would have been correct expressions, when classifying any member of Norman Venator's Barony. At the Assizes of 1256 Hugh de Wlonkeslow officiated as Chief-Bailiff of Condover Hun dred. A Patent of May 11, 1270, appoints Justices to try a cause of disseizin alleged by John de Baskervyle against John de Arundel for a tenement in Cantilup. A second Patent of July 2 substitutes Robert Corbet as Defendant. The connection between Robert Corbet of Moreton and the Arundels has already had our notice,6 and will perhaps account for this change.

At the Assizes of 1272 we have the two Coparceners of Cantlop at issue ; and the statement of their case is of much genealogical interest. Hughde Longslow of 1256 had been succeeded by his son, another Hugh. The Suit was as follows.\u2014\" John de Arundel seeks against Hugh de Wlankeslaue a moiety of 200 acres of bosc in Cantelop, of which the Defendant disseized Petronilla, widow of John de Arundel, and mother of the present Plaintiff.\" Hugh de Wlankeslaue states in reply, that \" Hugh fitz Robert gave the premises to Hugh, the Defendant's Father, in marriage with Alice, the Defendant's Mo ther,\" that \" Hugh, his father, had died seized thereof, and, since then, Alice, his mother, had died seized thereof.\" So said the Jurors also, and the Defendant was dismissed sine die.6 The Condover Hundred-Roll of 1274 alleges a pourpresture against Hugh de Wlon keslawe, but in terms not intelligible. Apparently the pourpresture, which was of seven years' standing, and consisted in an appropriation of pannage, affected that part of the King's Bosc of Buriwode which lay between the Manors of Condover and Cantlop. John de Pich ford's name is associated with Hugh de Wlonkeslawe's, but with what meaning it is impossible to say.7 The Inquisition taken May 24, 1285, on the death of John de Pichford, mentions his Seigneury over only one moiety of Cantelop, which, said the Jurors, had been held by Hugh fitz John under the deceased by service of a fourth part of a knight's fee.8 Here then is recurrent evidence of the mesne- tenure of the Foresters of Bolas still existing ; for Hugh fitz John was Son of John fitz Hugh, and Grandson of Hugh fitz Robert above mentioned. Why the sub tenure of Hugh de Longslow under Hugh fitz John was not noticed is evident. He owed nothing immediately to John de Pichford. It is not so easy to see why John de Pichford's seigneury over the other moiety of Cantlop is suppressed in this Inquest. He can hardly have alienated it, for the Statute of Quia Emptores had not yet passed.9 On June 17 of this same year, 1285, a Fine was levied, whereby John de Arundel, Impedient, acknowledged himself to have given this other moiety of the Manor of Cantilupe to Robert Burnell, Bishop of Bath and Wells, for one Sore Sparrow-hawk. A rent of one Rose to Arundel and all the services due to the Lords of the fee are charged on the Grantee and his heirs. Before I proceed with 8 Inquisitions, 13 Edw.

A Writ of Diem clausit, dated January 23, 1290, announces the death of Hugh de Wlonkeslowe. An Inquest, held at Shrewsbury on February 9, found that the deceased had held under Hugh fitz John a messuage and virgate in Cantelope, by service of one pound of cumin, which service was valued at l\\d. The said messuage and land were worth 10s. per annum. He had also held 10 acres of bosc in the King's forest, of which the last year's profits were only Is. for pannage. Hugh, son and heir of the deceased, was now 40 years of age.10 At the Assizes of 1292, Hugh de Wlonkes low was one of the two who chose the other Jurors for Condover Hundred. He was also a Juror on an Inquest of the same year on Bishop Burnel's death. At his death however, in 1314, the Inquest says nothing of any estate held by him at Cantlop. This may be explained by the Nomina Villarum of 1316, where Nycholas de Pycheford appears as Lord of half Cantelhop.11 As the elder branch of the Pichfords had ere this vanished from Shropshire history, this Nicholas was probably a Cadet. Under whom he held half Cantlop I cannot tell.13 As to BurneU's moiety, the Inquest taken in December 1292, on the Bishop's death, says with some inaccuracy that he had held 48s. 8c?. rent in Cantelop, under the heirs of John de Arundel, by service of a fourth part of a knight's-fee. Such service we know was not due to those heirs, but if due to any one, then to some one holding over the said heirs. The Inquest taken in June 1294, on the death of Philip Burnel, says that he held a rent in Cantelhope under the Lord of Pychford, thus ignoring any mesne tenure of Arundel's heir. Lastly, the Inquest taken in October 1315, on the death of Edward Burnell, values his interest in Cantelhope at 32s. per annum, and says that he held half the Manor under the Lord of Chetwynd. This I conceive to have been a mere mistake, arising in the false idea, before noticed, that Cantlop was of the Fee of Pitchford. Of Undertenants here, I have only one to mention, viz. Thurstan de Cantelhop, a Juror on a neighbouring Inquest in June 1294. 10 Inquisitions, 18 Edw.

(per annum) ; now it is worth 8s.\"1 This was not the only Manor which Siward was allowed to retain by the Norman Earl. He also had Longville (now Cheney Long ville) and Ovres at the date of Domesday. Whether he was iden tical with that Siward who was dispossessed of so many Manors in South Shropshire, and of whom I have attempted to give some account under Cleobury North, I cannot determine.2 I think how ever that he was not. Siward of Frodesley was more probably the same with Siward, surnamed Grossus, who has already occurred to us at a period later than Domesday, and in the company of Earl Roger.3 If Siward le Gros was, as Ordericus tells us, a kinsman of the Earl, there is no wonder that he should retain his Saxon estates. The only wonder is that they were not increased. This is not intended to throw doubt on Ordericus' s statement, which is strengthened by another consideration, \u2014 the name Siward is Danish rather than Saxon, and Earl Roger's Great-grandmother was a Dane.4 Siward was probably succeeded in his estates by his son Aldred, of whom we shall hear more under Cheney Longville. I cannot trace the succession any further.* Frodesley became subjected to the Fief of Fitz Alan, and though one Roger fitz Siward appears in company with the first William fitz Alan in Stephen's reign, and though a Richard fitz Siward appears in the same position soon after the accession of Henry IL, I doubt if these persons were descended from Siward le Gros or had any concern in Frodesley. In fact, I question whether Frodesley was annexed to Fitz Alan's Fief so early; for the Liber Niger of 1165 gives neither a Fitz Siward, nor any other Tenant of Fitz Alan whom I can associate 1 Domesday, so. 259, b. 2, 4, where the Writer's designation of Siward as a \"Saxon Gentleman\" need not be taken as the result of mature con sideration as to his origin. 2 Supra, Vol. III. pp. 22, 23. 3 Supra, Vol. i.p. 112. 4 Compare Hist.

The first Lord of Frodesley after this period, whom I can name with any probability, was Robert Hunald or Hunaud. At the Assizes of 1203, Augnes, widow of one Robert, sued him for dower ; but he declined to plead, saying that the tenement out of which she claimed dower was held in Villainage. She called, I think (for the Record is defaced), her infant son to warranty, but was directed by the Court to sue the Defendant under Writ of mort d'ancestre; that is, I presume, her son was to establish his heirship before she could sue for dower.5 At the same Assizes Robert Hunont essoigned his appearance against Robert Burdin and Agnes fitz Osbert in a plea of dower, his Essoignor being Richard Boscard : also Robert Hunald essoigned his attendance at the common sum mons, his Essoignor being Nicholas, his man. In March 1209 I find Robert Hunald assessed for imbladements within Regard of the Long Forest. His name stands between the assessments on Roger Sprenghose (of Longnor) and on the Vill of Dorrington, which consists well with his supposed concern in Frodesley. William Hunald, who appears in 1221, was certainly of Frodesley He also held Marton under the Lords of Montgomery. At the Assizes of 1221 he excused his appearance in a plea against Enge lard de Acton and Laurina his wife. His essoign was that which the Jurists called de malo veniendi, a term which is well explained in his case by the accompanying statement that he ivas beyond sea at St. James's. He had gone to visit the Shrine of St. James of Compostella, which we happen to know had been visited by John fitz Alan, his Suzerain, in the previous year. William Hunald's Suit and agreement with Roger Sprenghose of Longnor, dating in or about 1221, have already been recited.6 So also has the issue of his suit with Engelard and Laurina de Acton.'7 In 1231, William Hunald was amerced three merks because his hounds had been corn-sing without license. About 1234 we have John Honald attest ing a Charter of Roger Sprenghose, already given. His position would well comport with the idea that he was Lord of Frodesley, but I find almost continuous mention of William Hunald at this period ; that is, William Hunald occurs in 1231 and William Hu nald again in 1235 without any proof that they were two persons, or that a John Hunald intervened, further than is afforded by this testing clause. 6 Assizes, 5 John, m. 5 dorso. | r'-l Supra, p. 52, and Vol. IV. p. 124."], [755, "293 FRODESLEY.

The other part was well kept. Oak-trees did not grow therein. In 1237, William Hunaut appears as a Surety for a fine of 100 merks then inflicted on Robert de Wudeton for some trespass. In 1 240 we have William Honaud registered as holding a fourth part of a knight's-fee in Fredesleg under John fitz Alan.8 In November of the same year he was one of the special Justices appointed to try an assize between the Abbots of Buildwas and Haughmond. In 1246 he appears on a great Inquest touching the Forest-rights of Thomas Corbet of Caus : he occurs also in that year as Es cheator for Shropshire.9 Early in 1248 I find a King's Writ ordering the Sheriff to discharge a certain duty, which belonged properly to the Escheator, because William Honald was dead, and his successor not yet appointed.10 In Easter Term 1248, his widow Laurencia sues John fitz Alan for a ninth part of the Manor of Frodleg as her dower. The Baron allowed the claim, and the lady gave up her damages.11 Another suit, which this lady (called Lo retta) had about her dower in Marton, shows that her son and heir, Thomas, was an infant ; that both William de Cantilupe (as Seigneural Lord of Marton) and John fitz Alan claimed his ward ship ; and that, pending the dispute, Loretta concealed or removed (elongavit) her Son. The Condover Hundred-Roll of 1255 says that Thomas Unald holds Fredesleg for one hide under John fitz Alan. He paid 8d. for stretward and motfee, and did suit to both County and Hundred.12 Another passage in the Record leaves it doubtful whether Thomas Hunald was yet of age. However, in 1256 he is on the list of those who, holding 15 librates of land, were not as yet Knights. In May 1259 Thomas Hunald was a Juror on a neighbouring In quest. In 1262 it was reported to the Justices of the Forest, then in eyre, how that Richard fitz Hamon of Frodsley, being Woodwarden of Frodsley, had shot a stag on May 3, 1258.

In con sequence of this trespass the Bosc of Thomas Hunald of Frodesley, which he had previously had in his own keeping, had been seized in manu Regis. The said Thomas now appeared, and, for a fine of 6s. 8d., obtained repossession of his Bosc, Thomas Botterel and William, son of William de Drayton, being his Sureties.13 In 1270, Richard le Harpur and Sibil his wife sue Thomas Hunaud of Frodesleye for disseizing them of a tenement in Ram neshurst. I suppose that Thomas Hunald was succeeded by Wrilliam Hunald, and that the latter died in 1277-8; for an Inquest of 6 Edward I., which spoke of William Hunold, and his estates at Frodesley and Marton, was probably an Inquest on his death.14 It is, however, lost. The next whom I can take as Lord of Frodesley is John Hunald or Honaud, whom we have seen attesting a Wilderhope Deed about 1292.15 Frodesley, that is, the Seigneury, was one of the Manors given to Philip Burnel in marriage with Matilda Fitz Alan. Hence the Inquest taken May 28, 1295, after the said Philip's death, says that John Hunaud held Frodesley under him for half a knight's fee. The Manor was extended at \u00a312. 16 This John Honaud, being returned as a holder of 20 librates of land in Shropshire, was sum moned in 1297 to be in London on July 7, with horse and arms, for service beyond the seas.17 In the Noinina Villarum of 1316, John Honaud was duly enrolled as Lord of Frodesley.17 Of Undertenants in this Manor I may instance Benedict de Frodesley and Richard Hunaud, Jurors on a local Inquest in May 1249. The same Benedict occurs on Jury Lists of April and October 1253, on the Jury for Condover Hundred in 1255, and as amerced half a merk for some failure in Suretyship in 1262. Richard Hunaud above-named was perhaps the same with Richard de Frodeslegh, amerced 20s. in 1250 for keeping hounds within the Forest without license, and whose Surety, Robert, son of Ro bert de Drayton, was amerced 6s. 8d. in 1252.

Ovre is inadvertently inserted in one part of Domesday as a Manor of Earl Roger's demesne,1 and is described thus. \u2014 \"In Ovre there is half a hide, geldable. It is worth 3s. (per annum) . Seuuard held it in time of King Edward.\"2 Another part of the Record assigns Condover as the Hundred in which this Manor stood, and says that \" Seward holds Ovre of the Earl. He had also held it (in Saxon times). Here is half a hide, geldable. Here are n Vil lains, with half an ox-team. Its former and present value was and is 3s.\"3 I have noticed in a former Volume an instance w4iere an omission in Domesday was instructive. Here we have a case where the very redundancies of the Record attest its substantive accuracy. Overs, as a Manor, or even as a Township, has never been heard of since Domesday. The place exists, being situated about a mile south-west of Ratlinghope, to which, parochially, it belongs. In Saxon times it was associated with Ratlinghope in another way ; for Siward was Lord of both Manors. The evidence which has been given under Frodesley implies the forfeiture or failure of the line of Siward. We should consequently expect to find Overs as an Escheat of the Crown in the twelfth or thirteenth century, or else annexed by the Crown to some con tiguous Barony or Manor. We find, however, no direct evidences of either circumstance. The history of Ratlinghope and Stitt, already 69-b ; B. so. 6. 1 Vide Vol. I. pp. 128, 129. 22 Blakeway's MSS. 2 \u25a0 3 Domesday, sos. 254, a, 1 ; 259, b, 1."], [759, "297 NETLEY. given, is full of anomalies. Ecclesiastical boundaries in this district were either undefined or actually changed. We have King Henry II. granting Stitt as if it were Royal Demesne, but we know not how it became so. If the King had thus dealt with Overs, the process would have been intelligible, but of Overs we hear nothing. We know that as a Manor it was annihilated; we may presume that it was annexed to some adjacent Manor, \u2014 perhaps to the Abbot of Wig more's estate at Ratlinghope, perhaps to one of the Abbot of Haugh mond's estates at Stitt, at Linley, or at Boveria, on the Long Mynd. But though we fail to point out the Seigneural Lord of Overs in the thirteenth century, we know something of the Tenants ; for they took a name from the place, and had possessions elsewhere, which brought them into notice. This family of De Overs had an estate at Mucklewick, in Chirbury Hundred. They also held under the Mores in the \" Fee of La More,\" as it was then called. We shall therefore hear of them again when we come to the history of the Borders. Of their dealings in Overs I cannot certify a single fact ; for their grant of Little Radley Wood to Haughmond Abbey was, I take it, an incident of their tenure elsewhere. Here I shall give no more than the names of these presumed Tenants of Overs. \u2014 Madoc de Overes was succeeded by his son Robert before 1221. He had six other sons, viz. Eynun, Griffin, LeweUyn, Tudor, Wronou, and Madoc. Robert, his eldest son, was living in 1248, but was dead in 1255. 0tt\\t^ Domesday gives Netley in a sort of appendix, with five others of the smaller Manors of Earl Roger's demesne.\u2014\" The Earl himself holds Netelie.

In 1209 Richard and William de Netelegh and the men of Nete legh are charged with imbladements within Regard of the Long Forest.2 In Langley's Forest- arrentation of 1250, Ralph le Lung and other settlers at Netley are assessed in small sums. The period when its Manorial status was restored to Netley does not come within my present scope. Nethelegh was, however, one of the places which were disforested by the Great Perambulation of 1 300-1 .3 Bapston- This was one of the Manors which the Domesday Commissioners found William Pantulf to be holding under Earl Roger. Their remarks, which are evidently intended to question the propriety of such a tenure, must be given in the original Latin ; for I will not offer more than an opinion on their precise meaning. \u2014 \" Isdem Wil lelmus tenet Begestan.

Hence, argued the Commissioners, the Manor could not divert (or be diverted) from the Bishop. The clause, et ei pr\u00e6stiterat tantum in vitd sud, is ambiguous. It may mean that Edric had ren dered during his life certain produce in kind, or that the Manor had rendered certain produce during the life of the last Bishop of Hereford. In the former case, the allusion would be to the death 2 Placita Forestas, 10 John, m. 1 dorso. It is worth observing that the term used is De hominibus de Netelegh, whilst in all other cases where a community is assessed the word villatd is used, e. g. De villatd de Weseleg. The inference is, that Netley, though inhabited, was not recognized as a Vill. 3 Salop Chartulary, No. 279. 1 Domesday, so. 257, a, 2."], [761, "299 BAYSTON. of Edric Sylvaticus in prison, a matter which we have before dis cussed;2 in the latter case, allusion would be to Walter, Bishop of Hereford, who died six or seven years before Domesday. The posi tion of the Domesday Commissioners, that the Seigneury of Bayston could not lawfully be changed, seems to have been deferred to most implicitly. At no subsequent period have we the slightest appear ance of a Pantulf interest in the Manor ; but whenever the Sei gneural Lord is named, it is the Bishop of Hereford. A branch of the House of Sprenghose held Bayston under the said Bishop in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The same branch also held Plaish, but under different Lords. A Writ of King Henry III., dated at Ludlow, October 2, 1224, names Richard Sprengehose as one of the Verderers of Shropshire, and as exempt from all future liability to serve on Assizes, Juries, or Recognitions.3 This Richard I take to have been of Bayston. In 1255 the Condover Hundred- Roll says that Richard Sprenchose (probably a second of the name) holds the vill of Beyston under the Bishop of Hereford. He paid the Bishop 20s. per annum, but did no suit either to County or Hundred, nor did he pay either stretward or motfee.* Thus the immunities of this Manor were greater since it had been restored to the Church, for Domesday had registered it as geldable. In 1257 Richard Sprengehose and Robert Corbet appear as Sure ties for an amercement set on Thomas and Philip Hord. Richard Sprenghose's attestation of a Wilderhope Deed about 1260 is the last occurrence of his name that I have to mention.5 William and Walter Sprenghose appear as Jurors on an Inquest of April 1283. The latter, according to the Feodary of 1284, was Lord of Baystan, holding it of the Bishop of Hereford, who held it of the King; but of the services due thereon the Inquest makes no mention. A Pulley Inquest of April 1290 was attended by Alan Sprenghose ; but Walter Sprenghose of Plash (and of Bayston) occurs again in 1297.6 Lastly, we have Walter Sprenghose on a Preen Inquest in April 1301. In the Nomina Villarum of 1316, Richard Sprenghose appears as Lord of Plaish and of Beystan.7 His attestation of a Wilderhope Deed in this or the preceding year shows that he was styled of Plash.8 By a Deed, dated at Beyston on June 25, 1364, Sir William Sprenchoes, Lord of Beyston, demises to Richard Barker \u2022 \u25a0 6 Supra, Vol. IV. p. 101. 2 Supra, Vol. III. p. 50. 3 Claus.

The probability that this place was visited hy Henry I. has been already glanced at.2 The King, having his head quarters at Condover, might easily be at Norton accidentally, and being found there by the Abbot of Shrewsbury, might think the expediting of a Writ no interruption to the pleasures of the table or the chase. Such matters, I suspect, were as often transacted in the field as at the Council-board, for in those days the Chancellor's place was ever at the King's right-hand. At the close of the twelfth and the beginning of the thirteenth centuries, Dawley, Tibberton, and Norton were held, under the Pantulfs of Wem, by a younger branch of their house. In 1240 this younger branch was extinct in the male line, and was represented by Coheirs. In 1255 two of these Coheirs, viz. Michael de Morton and Richard Irish (Hibernensis) , were holding Norton, for one hide, of the Fee of Wem. The Manor owed neither stretward, motfee, nor suit of Court.3 At the Assizes of 1256 a very remarkable and probably an er- 9 In possession of W. W.

One WilUam fitz Thomas sued Michael de Morton for disseizing him of a messuage and half-virgate in Norton. Michael de Morton de clined to plead, alleging \" that Northon was a member of Conedoure, and that Conedoure was ancient demesne of the Crown, wherein no Writ was current except the Parvum breve de recto clausum.\" The Jury affirmed this proposition, and Michael was dismissed sine die* I have often explained how Writs of novel disseizin and some other Writs were excluded from operation in Manors of ancient de mesne. It is possible, nay it is certain, that the jurisdiction of Norton had at this time been abstracted from Condover Hundred and attracted to the Court of Condover Manor.5 Prescription therefore may have settled the franchises of Norton as identical with those of Condover ; but the above suit was not determined on that ground ; it was determined on the ground that Norton was a member of Condover and so ancient demesne, the fact being that, in so far as it was not ancient demesne, it was not a member of Condover. It seems that Bishop Burnell obtained a feoffment of at least Michael de Morton's share of Norton. The Inquest taken in De- cember 1292 on the Bishop's death, says that he had held 27s. 9d. annual rent in Norton under Michael de Morton by service of one rose. The Inquest, taken in July 1294, on Philip Burnel's death, is quite consistent in stating that certain rents held by the deceased in Norton involved a suit to the Manorial Court of Conedoure.6 But an Inquisition of Burnell Tenures, taken at Cound in 1301, gives this Estate of Norton as realizing \u00a31. 16s. 5d. per annum, and as having been held in socage, by Philip Burnell, deceased, under Thomas Corbet.7 I cannot explain this, and suspect some error of the Jurors. The Inquisition taken in October 1315, on Edward BurneU's death, is much more intelligible. The Jurors valued the Vill of Norton juxta Condover at \u00a32. 6d. per annum, and said that Edward Burnell had held it, free of all service, under the heirs of Michael de Moreton and of Reginald de Charnes.8 Reginald de Charnes, be it observed, was another of the Coheirs of Pantulf of Tibberton and Dawley. The previous non-mention of his name as a Coparcener in Norton is no more a proof that he had no interest there than this Inquest is a proof that the heirsof Irish and Caverswell * Assizes, 40 Hen.

Domesday classifies the possessions of Wenlock Priory under the following title, viz. Quod tenet \u00c6cclesia Sanct\u00e6 Milburg\u00e6. At the end of the list is this notice of a Manor, unnamed, but placed in Conodovre Hundred. \u2014 \" Sancta Witburga holds half a hide, geldable ; and the Son of Aluric holds it of him (de eo). Here is one Villain with one ox team, and there might be another (ox-team) here. It (the Manor) is worth 3s. (annually) .\"l It is obvious that in this passage we should read Milburga for Witburga, and ed for eo. It is apparent, too, from what has been said under Burton, that Aluric, a Saxon Tenant of St. Milburg, in the time of the Confessor, was represented at the time of Domesday by his son Edric.2 This Edric was, in short, the only Feoffee of Wenlock Priory, alluded to in Domesday ; \u2014 and he held Burton and the unnamed Manor now under notice. That this Manor was Hughley there cannot be a question, for Hughley was the only Manor in Condover Hundred which will fulfil certain conditions of identity. It was held after Domesday by Wenlock Priory. So (it may be said) were Church Preen and Wig wig, both in Condover Hundred ; but then we know that Church Preen and Wigwig were acquired by the Priory after Domesday, and that in Domesday they appear by name, and in other hands. In fact the negative proof is in this case, as in many others, unassailable. If the unnamed half-hide of St. Witburg be not Hughley, then the Manor so described in Domesday had no subsequent representative, and, if the Manor of Hughley be not the said half-hide, Hughley has no Domesday antecedent. Domesday, so. 252, b, 2. Supra, Vol. III. p. 300."], [765, "303 HUGHLEY. Edric fitz Aluric, though untouched in estate at Domesday, was, I imagine, eventually dispossessed. Had the later Lords of Hugh ley been his lineal heirs, they would probably have inherited Burton also ; but that Manor never appears after Domesday, except as a Manor held in demesne by Wenlock Priory. On the other hand, Hughley was held from the twelfth to the sixteenth century by Feoffees of the Priory, at one uniform chief rent of 5s. The Estate in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries is always written as Lega or Lee, a word which I have elsewhere ex plained to be nearly equivalent to Manor.3 This was one step in advance of the indistinctiveness of Domesday ; but there were many Lees in Shropshire, and the second step (that by which this Manor was at length definitely known) was not taken till the end of the thirteenth century. It was then called Hugh-ley, the prefix being the Christian name of a former Lord of the Manor. This was a curious result ; for while the family had taken its name from the Lee or Manor, the Manor in turn took its distinctive name from one of the family. It is now my business to mark the succession of those Lees who held the Manor under Wenlock Priory, \u2014 a work which I cannot hope to accomplish with any certainty, seeing that my chief evi dences are of the most indefinite character, viz. the testing clauses of undated Charters. In 1120 we have seen Ranulf de Leges attesting a Charter of Wenlock Priory ;* and him I take to have been Ancestor of Thomas de Lega, to whom, between the years 1169 and 1176, Peter, then Prior of Wenlock, made the following conditional grant of the Advowson of the Chapel of Lega : \u2014 Sciant presentes et fu turi quod ego Petrus Prior de Wenloke concessu totius conventds concessi Thome de Lega et heredibus suis in perpetuum liberam donacionem Capelle de Lega et presentacionem Clerici ad eandem Capellam, ita quod Clericus, per presentacionem Thome sive here dum suorum ab ipso institutus, antequam mittatur in corporalem possessionem, vel aliquod beneficium de eadem Capella percipiat, veniet ad Cenobium de Wenloke, tarn ipse quam Successores sui, et coram Priore et Conventu jurabit, tarn ipse quam Successores sui, fidelitatem matrici Ecclesie de Wenlok, et quod fideliter ser vabit legata et cetera que ad matricem Ecclesiam prestantur, et quod annuatim nomine penstonis duos solidos matrici Ecclesie de Wenloke in odabis Pentecostes in manu Sacriste persolvet.

Thomas and William are joint witnesses of that Corve Charter which I have ventured to date about 1180.8 I think that Hugh de Lee succeeded his father, Thomas, before the end of the twelfth century. His attestation of a Charter which has been given under Presthope points to such a conclusion.9 In 1203, we have him agreeing with his neighbour, the Lord of Ken ley, in terms already set forth. At the Assizes of October 1203 he appears as a Knight, empanelled to try causes of Grand Assize. Again, in 1206 we have had Sir Hugh de Lega as a Juror in an Oxenbold Suit.10 On the Forest Assize-Roll of 1209 two separate 5 \u2022 6 The Translation of St. Milburg is placed on May 26 (Butler's Lives of the Saints, Vol. II. p. 209).

Regards (or Assessments of persons living within Regard) of the Long Forest are entered. The first exhibits the name of Reginald de Leges, followed by that of Matilda, a Widow, among the assessed. Lower down comes the name of Hugh de Lega as assessed for one acre in Easthope. The second Regard has the names of Hugh de Lega and Matilda, a widow, consecutively ; but no Reginald is men tioned. Now I cannot think that either this Reginald or this Hugh was Lord of Lee, much less can I say how they were related. They re-appear in 1221-2, at which date there was also a Thomas de Lega, more likely to have been Lord of this Vill than either Reginald or Hugh. At the Assizes of 1221, Reginald de Legh appears in a matter stated under Benthall ; and possibly he was the person whom I have noticed under Claverley.11 If so, his profession would seem to have been the Law. In or about 1222 Reginald de Leya and Hugh de Leya follow each other as witnesses of a Deed of partition between Longnor and Frodesley ;13 and later in the century Reginald de Lega has been seen attesting a Larden Deed.13 Thomas de Lega was, as I have said, cotemporary with Reginald and Hugh. His Suit with William de Harley in 1221 has been noticed under Harley.14 At the same time he appears as Surety for the amercement of Roger Sprenghose (II.) of Longnor. The fol lowing Deed has already appeared under Acton Burnell, of which Manor, Fulwood was a member ; but I here repeat it, because it ex hibits these three persons, Reginald, Thomas, and Hugh, again in conjunction, a circumstance which will sufficiently indicate its date. In part, also, it shows their relations and positions. \u2014 \" Know all men that I Reginald de Lega have given to Peter fitz Warin a noke of land in the Trench (trenched) of Fulewode, which (noke) is contained in a Charter of my Lord, William Burnell.

Also we see that Thomas and Hugh de Le\u00b0-a were brothers, and that Thomas, as being evidently the eldest, was probably Lord of Lega.

We have had Hugh de Lega attesting a Badger Deed at about the period of this supposed suc cession,16 and a Middleton- Prior's Deed of March 12, 1227.17 Be tween 1234 and 1256 we have Hugh de Lega attesting various Deeds already cited under Broseley, Hatton, and Arlscot. In the same interval he is named under circumstances which show that he was a Knight,18 and his position on an important Inquest of 1253 is not less than knightly.19 At the Inquest of 1255 he was Foreman of the Jurors for Wenlock Liberty, which Jurors declared that \" Hugh de Lega was Lord of the Vill of Lega, and held it of the Prior of Wenlock, and paid 5s. annual rent to the Prior.\" He did suit to the Prior's Court by afforciament, as his Ancestors had done suit to Condover Hundred till the reign of Richard I. The Vill was stated to contain half a hide, \u2014 exactly its Domesday measurement, and its only Domesday name.20 The Jurors of Condover Hundred also adverted to the withdrawal of Hug' -Leg' from their Franchise. Various documents of June 1259, February 1262, and November 1271, exhibit Hugh de Lega as a Verderer of the Shropshire Forests. Various Charters passing during the same or a little wider period have him as a witness. These have been given under Farlow, Wilderhope, Brockton, and Longnor. In two instances out of the four he is styled Lord of Lega. Before October 1282 he was de ceased. His wife was Elena, a daughter, if not the heiress, of the Lees of Calvington, which Lees were, I think, themselves Cadets of the Lees of Lega. Hugh de Lega and Elena his wife concurred in enfeoffing Edmund (evidently their younger son) in whatever they had at Calvington. Their Deeds in this matter, belong to a future Chapter, but I may state here that Edmund de Lee's quit -rent for Calvington was made payable to the heirs of Hugh and Elena, at Lega. The eldest son of Hugh de Lega was named Reginald. In 1275 Reginald de Leye appears as one of the Assessors of the tax called the fifteenth, in the Counties of Salop and Stafford. In October 1282 he occurs as a Knight. He presented to the Church of Hughley in that month, and in December 1313.

We have seen it represented by a Chief-rent of 5s. in 1255. The Ecclesiastical Taxation of 1291 gives among the Temporalities of Wenlock Priory a rent of 5s. from Leye.23 The Foreign Rent-Roll of the Priory drawn up in 1514-5 includes an item of 5s. receivable from William Gataker for Hugh Lye.24 The printed Valor of 1534-5 does not give the items which went to make up the Foreign Rental of the Priory. The Ministers' Accounts of 1541-2 are more specific and include this one of 5s. from Hugh ley.25 THE CHURCH. Hughley was within the bounds of that spiritual jurisdiction so often mentioned in former Volumes, \u2014 the Fief of St. Milburg. Its Chapel therefore, founded, as we have seen, before the year 1176, was an affiliation of the Church of Wenlock. The Lords of the Manor then obtained the Advowson from the Priory ; but the Presentee of the said Lords was at all times to pay over to the Mother Church all Legacies and things belonging thereto, and was also to pay an annual pension of 2s. in token of subjection. In the Taxation of 1291 the Church of Huley, or Heweleye, in the Deanery of Wenlock and Diocese of Hereford, is registered as of less than \u00a34. annual value.26 Bishop Charlton's Confirmation to Wenlock Priory, dated May 23, 1331, does not include Leye among the Dependent Chapels of Wenlock Church, but sanctions the pension receivable from the Church or Chapel of Leye.27 The reason of this distinction is obvious, if we compare the history of Hughley Church with that of 25 Monasticon, V. 81. 26 Pope Nich.

The Valor of 1534-5 gives the preferment of Roger Strenger, Rector of Hughlye, as \u00a34. 13s. 8d., less a pension of 2s., still payable to the Prior of Wenlock, and less 6d., payable to the Archdeacon for Synodals.28 The same Record gives a Portion of 3s., receivable by the Priory of Wenlock from the Vill of Huglye. This I take to be the same thing as the Pension, but inaccurately expressed as to amount. The Minister's Accounts of 1541-2 confirm this view, for one asset of the late Priory is a Pension of 2s. from the Vill of Hughley.29 EARLY INCUMBENTS.

Cpij-ter-ac, or Christ's-oak of the Saxon \u00e6ra. The name probably originated at the period when Christian Missionaries first taught the Gospel to heathen Saxons. The wide-spread oak-tree gave appropriate and natural shelter to the Votaries of a simple but as yet unorganized Religion. In primitive states of society, or where institutions have been fluctuating and unsettled, trees have often served as places of dwelling or resort. A tree on the plain of Mamre was the guest-chamber of the Patriarch Abraham. Abra ham's Oratory at Beersheba was a tree (or grove) planted by him self. Deborah's Hall of Judgment was a Palm-tree in Mount Ephraim. A tree in Ramah was one of the hyp\u00e6thral Palaces of King Saul. We are told that the spot where Christ's-oak grew at Cressage was afterwards occupied by a Stone Cross -1 but whether this is said as a matter of tradition, or only of opinion, I cannot ascertain. The thing is probable enough in itself. It is also probable that the original Christ's-oak suggested to a later but long bygone generation the idea of naming a second tree in this Parish. The Lady-Oak (so called in honour of the Virgin Mother) was a monument of ages, and existent in our time;2 nay, in some sort, it may be said to exist still. Domesday describes Cressage in the following terms. \u2014 \" Rannulf Peurel holds Cristesache of Earl Roger. Edric held it (in Saxon times), and was a free man. Here are one hide and a half, geldable. In demesne there are hi ox-teams; and viii Serfs, vn Villains, xi Boors, and mi Cottars have mi teams, and yet there might be two more teams here. Here is a Fishery of 8s. (annual value), and a Wood which will fatten 200 Swine. In King Edward's time the Manor was worth 110s. {per annum). Now it is worth \u00a310. When he (Rannulf) received it, it was worth \u00a36.\"s We may presume that the Fishery of Domesday was a Weir in the River Severn, and that the Domesday wood is that which is now known as Cressage Park. It is more difficult to trace in modern Cressage any such extraordinary agricultural capabilities as will account for the Domesday estimate of 6 ox-teams, and \u00a36. 13s. 4d., Market-Cross, which latter was removed in hi9 time. 1 In support of this, Mr. Blakeway quotes a Shrewsbury Burgess-Roll of 12 Edw.

Mr. Blakeway adds that the Stone Cross 'gave way in turn to a 2 The Lady-Oak was nearly destroyed by fire about the year 1815.

I cannot help thinking that Cressage was allowed to stand in Domesday as a Manor of 1^ hides by special favour then shown, or under some unrecorded immunity of Saxon origin. The area of the modern Parish is 1900 acres, or 1266 acres to the Domesday hide. This is an unusual proportion. I have not, at present, found any other hide of the Shropshire Domesday, which I can calculate to be represented by so much as 1000 acres of modern measurement. Of Ranulf Peverel, and his traditional relations to William the Conqueror, I have spoken at some length already.4 I have denied all probability that he was the father of those Peverels who figured in Shropshire during the reign of Henry I. I have suggested that William Peverel, called of Essex or of London, was the successor and only son of Ranulf Peverel. Now all that we know surely about William Peverel of London or Essex is that the Barony of himself and his Sister Maud escheated to the Crown in the reign of King Henry I. and before the year 1130.6 In perfect consistency with this, I shall presently show a probability that Cressage was in the Crown at or about the time of Henry II.'s accession. But a difficulty here besets me. I cannot show that Cressage was in the Crown continuously from the forfeiture of William Peverel of London till the accession of Henry II. The only evidence I have on the point implies that it was not ; for a Document of the year 1203 declares Cressage to have been of the Fee of Peverel of Nottingham. This means that it was a member of the Barony forfeited by the last William Peverel of Nottingham in 1154-5, for the crime of poison ing the Earl of Chester. The only solution of this difficulty is by supposing that Peverel of Nottingham succeeded to part at least of the escheated estates of Peverel of London.6 To deduce inferences from suppositions is a most unscientific procedure, especially in a matter which promises much to further inquiry into facts. Suffice it to say that there is much more probability that Peverel of Notting ham was nearly related to Peverel t f London, than to those other Peverels of Henry I.'s time, whom Dugdale has represented as sons of Ranulf Peverel, and as half brethren of the first William Peverel of Nottingham. 4 Supra, Vol. II. pp. 104, 105. authority, that in other Counties than Shropshire the Escheats of Peverel of Not tingham and Peverel of London are com bined or confused in an inexplicable way. 5 Sot.

Cressage, whether as an Escheat of William Peverel of London, of William Peverel of Nottingham, or of both in turn, reached the hands of Henry II. ; for that King it must have been who annexed it to the Fief of De Lacy. I think too that such annexation was later than 1165; for Hugh de Lacy's return of that year, enrolled in the Liber Niger, contains no evidence that he was then Seigneural Lord of Cressage. It was however annexed to his Barony before the year 1180, and he had enfeoffed Almaric de Lacy, perhaps his bro ther, therein. I know this from the Forest-Roll of 1180, in which Amauri de Laci is assessed 7s. for an imbladement of 7 acres of wheat in Cristesech. It does not appear that Almaric de Lacy was involved in the disgrace which befell his Suzerain in 1181.7 In 1186, the year after Hugh de Lacy's death, the Justices of the Forest set a fine of 100s. on \" Almaric de Laci's Vill of Cristesech,\" for some default. A Writ of the King cancelled the whole amercement, and in favour of Almaric de Laci himself. I conclude that he died in 1185-6, for, in the latter year, the Sheriff accounts to the Crown for a sum of \u00a34. Is. 6d., beng the ferm of Cristesech, the land of Amal ric de Laci. Also the Sheriff of. Herefordshire accounted 37s. for the issues of the land of Froma, the land of Amalric de Laci. Castle- Frome, I should observe, had been held by Almaric under Hugh de Lacy. The reason, I presume, why these Escheatures fell to the Crown was because the Barony of Hugh de Lacy was in manu Regis. In 1187 I find the Sheriff of Herefordshire rendering account at the Exchequer, of 100s. for issues of the land, late Almaric de Lacy's. I conclude that soon after this, Almaric de Lacy's heir obtained livery of his estates by composition with the Crown. Of Gilbert, son op Almaric de Lacy, I have given some ac count, under Harnage, a manor which he held of Fitz Alan. At the Assizes of October 1203, the Jurors of Condover Hundred made the following presentment. \u2014 \" Gilebert de Lasci holds Cristesac, which is of the Fee of Peverel of Nottingham, under Walter de Lasci. It is worth \u00a310. (per annum). The Jurors know not what service he (Gilbert) owes to Walter de Lasci. Walter de Lasci holds it (the Manor) of the Lord King.\"8 A Writ of Henry III.'s, dated May 2, 1222, is in favour of Gilbert de Lacy, Lord apparently of the Wiltshire Manor of Bretword? Some Forest Pleas, recorded on the Shropshire Pipe-Roll of 1231, contain an amercement of one merk against Gilbert de Lascy of Cristesech.

This second Gilbert de Lacy is he whom a Herefordshire Feodary of 1243 registers as holding Castle Frome, a Manor of four hides, under the heir of Walter de Lacy, for one knight's-fee.10 On September 21, 1249, Gilbert de Lacy (IL), called in this instance Gilbert de Frome, was dead. His son and heir, Adam, was under age and in ward to Matilda de Lacy, then widow of Peter de Geneva, but afterwards wife of Geoffrey de Genevill.11 Gilbert having died in debt to a certain Jew of Hereford, a King's Writ now allows to the said Matilda that neither the principal nor in terest of such debts shall be demanded till Adam should come of of age.12 In Michaelmas Term of this same year, 1249, 1 find that Agnes, widow of Gilbert de Lacy, impleaded Matilda de Lacy for her dower, viz. for a third of the Manor of Cristesich and a third of the Manor of Castel-fromme. The Defendant not appearing, the lands were ordered to be seized for the Crown, and the case to be reheard on the Quinzaine of Easter (1250) .13 It is evident that, in Cressage at least, Agnes eventually recovered her dower. In Michaelmas Term 1253, the Abbot of Buildwas appears with a claim upon Cressage, probably in the nature of a mortgage. His suit lay against Geoffrey de Genvill and Matilda (de Lacy) his wife ; but they came to this agreement : \u2014 Geoffrey and Matilda de mised the Manor of Cristeseche (except the dower of Agnes, mother of Adam de Lacy) to the Abbot, for a term of nineteen years, as specified in a certain Chyrograph. The Abbot paid for this the large sum of 200 merks,14 which may be taken as an indi cation of what the value of a wardship was in those days. The Hundred Roll of 1255 says, with great accuracy, that \"the Abbot of Buildewas holds Cristeseche of Dame Matilda Lacy for a term.\" It was now set down as half a hide, a still further dimi nution of its low Domesday hidage. But its immunities were such as to leave any question about its hidage immaterial. It paid neither stretward nor motfee: it did suit neither to County nor Hundred.15 The Abbot of Buildwas's occupation of Cressage during the mi nority of Adam de Lacy will be illustrated by what I shall have to say of the Undertenants in the Manor.

A Hind (bissa) had been struck by an arrow from some unknown hand in the Chase of Sir Ralph le Butiller of Wem. The King's Foresters had tracked the animal, apparently through a long and circuitous flight ; for the hind had fallen dead in the Haughmond Bailiwick of the Forest, and the Vill of Cres tesech was one of those which were amerced on the occasion. In October 1268, it would seem that Adam de Lacy was in possession of Castle-Frome, for Walter de Neget was then implead ing him for disseizin there. A Writ of February 1271 indicates that Adam de Lacy was in possession of Cristesach. A fence, erected by Adam de Lacy of Castlefrome and others in Cristesach, was objected to by the Abbot of Buildwas, and the matter was ordered for trial at law. It will be observed that at this time Adam de Lacy must have been of more than full age (for he was born before September 1249), and yet that the term of 19 years guaranteed to the Abbot of Buildwas in 1253 could not have expired. This puzzle is solved by a fortuitous piece of evidence. \" At Easter (April 5) 1271, A. (that is Adam), Abbot of Buildewas, acknowledges himself to have received from Adam de Lacy, Lord of Frome-Castle and of Cristesech, the sum of 15^ merks, he being bound to the Abbot in the sum of 25 merks, for two thirds of the Manor of Cristesech which (two thirds) the Abbot lately had at ferm from Sir Geoffrey de Genevill and Matilda his wife, and into which Manor the said Adam de Lacy entered and ejected the Abbot, the term granted by the said Geoffrey and Matilda being as yet unexpired. The Abbot further quit-claims all remaining right in the said two thirds of Cristesech.\"16 So then, Geneville's lease was longer than he was entitled to grant, and yet the wronged heir thought it best to compound for his Su zerain's injustice. We have had Adam de Lacy attesting a Condover Deed in 1284, and the Feodary of that year notes him as holding Cristerdech of Geoffrey de Genevill and Matilda his wife, who held it in capite. In 1292, Emeric (i.e. Almaric), son and heir of Adam de Lacy, was represented by the Jurors of Condover Hundred as claiming to hold a free court twice a year in Cristesech, as also to assize bread and beer. Nothing followed from this presentment, for the said Emeric proved to be under age. He was still under age in 1297, for the 16 Blakeway, \u2014 from the Newport Evidences. vi. 40"], [778, "314 CRESSAGE. Return to a Writ of May 24 says that the heirs of Adam de Lacy, being holders of 20 Librates of lands in Herefordshire, were under age, and in ward to Geoffrey de Genevyll.17 I do not find that Almaric de Lacy ever came into possession. John de Lacy, who succeeded, was more probably his brother than his son. In 1311 and 1313 this John de Lacy was a Knight of the Shire, returned for Herefordshire, and on August 15, 1314, he was to appear at Newcastle-upon-Tyne for military service against the Scots.18 In the Nomina Villarum of 1316 he appears as Lord both of Castle- Froome and Crissage, \u2014 a proof that he survived the great carnage of Bannockburn. My evidence as to how this line of Lacy of Cressage ended in a female (Elizabeth, wife of Walter de Baskervill) is very imperfect, and I must be content to state one prominent difficulty in a note,19 and to suppose that the said Elizabeth was daughter or granddaughter of John de Lacy above-named. Her Descendants have been already given in a Tabular Pedigree.20 Their successive interests in Cressage, and the ultimate failure of her line, I have also traced.21 In addition to what I have said under Lawton, it is worth stating that on March 10, 1401, the King gave the custody of Thomas Foulshurst's lands, and the marriage of his heir (Thomas Foulshurst, Junior), to Wil liam Venables of Kinderton, a near relative of the Ward. A Mor timer Feodary of 1414 gives John de Senes as holding a fee in Cras- sach of that Barony. John de Senes s, be it noted, was then Thomas 17 Parliamentary Writs, I. 286. kervill was living in 1339. 18 Parliamentary Writs, TV. 1063. But Mr. Blakeway's Deed is probably misdated, for enough has been said under Langley to show that Edward Burnell was not Lord of that Manor so early as 1327-8. Still the name Juliana, being common to the Lady of Cressage and to the wife of Richard de Baskervill, is small proof of then- identity. In disproof thereof we have authentic assurance that the Lady of Cressage who married a Baskervill was named Elizabeth, and that her husband was not Riehard, but Walter, Richard's son. Also the arms on the dexter side of the above shield are not Baskervill arms. I think Juliana, Lady of Cressage, came between John de Lacy and Elizabeth de Lacy, but in what way it is vain to con jecture. 19 Mr. Blakeway quotes a Deed of \" 1 Edw. III.\" (1327-8) whereby \" Juliana de Lacy, Lady of Cryssagh, grants to Edward Burnell, Lord of Langley, certain rights of road in Cryssagh.\" This Deed was sealed with a Coat of Arms ; viz. Two bends (on the dexter side), empaling some obliterated coat, which we may assume to have been that of Lacy of Cressage. Mr. Blakeway conjectures that this Juliana was \"wife of Richard, son of Roger de Baskervill.\" Now a reference to the Pedigree already given (Vol. V. p. 102) will show that Juliana, wife of Richard de Baskervill, cannot have been identical with Juliana de Lacy who in the above Deed of 1327-8 is clearly a Widow : for Richard de Bas- 20 \u25a0 21 Supra, Vol. V. pp. 102, 107-109."], [779, "CRESSAGE. 315 Foulshurst's Guardian. William Foulshurst, the last of Elizabeth de Lacy's descendants, died in 1439; and it is curious to observe the various false claims which were made upon Cressage before it es cheated to Richard, Duke of York, as Lord of the Fee.22\u2014 1. Sir John Baskervill claimed Cressage as being descended from Richard, Brother of Walter de Baskervill. A glance at the pedigree will|show how this was a valid title to BaskervilPs estates, and not to Elizabeth de Lacy's. 2. John Baskervill of Bristol claimed it as being descended from Roger, brother of Walter de Baskervill. This was invalid on the same grounds, and moreover \u2014 3. Elen, wife of John Bruyn, affirmed that the said Roger de Baskervill died without issue. She, as third claimant, derived from Johanna, daughter of Sir Roger de Baskervill. Of course this Johanna, being^Aunt of Elizabeth de Lacy's husband, had none of Elizabeth de Lacy's blood. 4. Isabella Spencer derived from Sir Hugh Spencer, whom she affirmed to have been second husband of Agnes, heiress of Cressage. The heiress Agnes does not appear to have been believed in. If Elizabeth was meant, the claim was plausible; but I suppose the Claimant's pedigree did not hold \"good. 5. Margaret, daughter of Sir William Devereux, and wife of Miles Waters, Senior, of Clifford, derived from Joan, sister of some Gilbert de Lacy, who married Maud de Kingly. This Joan, Mar garet said, married * * * * Glodeshull, and had a daughter, Eliza beth, wife of Sir William Devereux, and mother of the Claimant, who made her two nieces parties to her suit. I cannot discover how this Gilbert de Lacy was related to Lacy of Cressage, but this Claimant's pedigree is in one respect backed by a piece of secondary evidence. A Writ of King Richard IL, dated in 1386-7, grants to Sir Simon de Burley the Manor of Castle-frome, which had belonged to Elizabeth Clodeshall, relict of Sir William Devereux, and had been forfeited by her because she was assenting to the murder of Thomas Tidwyne, Esq. 6. Richard, Duke of York, claimed as heir of Mortimer, Earl of March, heir of Genevile, heir of Lacy of Ludlow ; and this claim prevailed.23 I presume it was allowed to the Duke, as Lord of the title to the Crown. 22 I have inadvertently given William as the name of the Duke of York in a former page (Vol. V. p. 109). It was Richard ; he who opposed Henry VI.'s 23 This account of the Claimants of Cressage is taken from Blakeway's MSS. Mr. Blakeway's authority is not given."], [780, "316 CRESSAGE.

I cannot suppose that the Duke proved positively the extinction of all the descendants of that Almaric de Lacy who lived in Henry II. 's time, or that he proved Hugh de Lacy of Ludlow to be, in his issue, next heir to the said Almaric. Of Undertenants in Cressage I enumerate the following. \u2014 William de Cristeseche was amerced half a merk in 1230, quia non habuit quern plegiavit. At the Assizes of January 1256 William Pyneleys, a Minor, sued the Abbot of Buildwas for a virgate in Cristesech as his inheritance. The Abbot pleaded (untruly I think) that he was only Tenant of the premises from year to year, at will of Geoffrey and Matilda de Genevill. The Plaintiff was ordered to sue the said Geoffrey and Matilda, and his amercement was excused because of his nonage.24 The Abbot of Buildwas had other suits pending at this time, one of which at least related to Cressage. They were against William, son of William de Kistesbech, and against Thomas de Sambrok and Alice his wife. Robert de Duddelegh and Brother Nicholas le Waleys were the Abbot's Attorneys. Thomas, son of Alice, was the Attorney of Thomas and Alice de Sambrok.25 Again, at these Assizes, John Tece recovered an acre in Cristesich, the Tenant, William de Stevinton, failing to appear.26 Also Roger le Fraunceys makes Christiana, his wife, his Attorney in two suits of land, one against William le Clatere, the other against Gilbert de Frome and Margery his wife.26 John de Crisesech is mentioned as deceased in the Forest-Roll of 1262. At the Assizes of 1272 a Plea was heard involving the fol lowing statements : \u2014 William Morel, deceased, son of Herbert Morel, had had by his wife Matilda, five daughters, Alice, Sibil, Amice, Eve, and Leuka. Eve and Leuka were already deceased without issue, Amice was married to Henry le Cowarde, Sibil to Roger Walewayn, and Alice was single. These last five persons claimed against Wil liam de Penles a messuage and haff a toft, and against Roger Parson of Sheynton half a toft in Cristesich. Their claim was as heirs of Matilda aforesaid, but the Defendants asserted themselves to have been enfeoffed by William Morel (Matilda's husband) .

The Jurors of Condover Hundred presented how William Wolfrych had slain with an arrow William, a page of Walter, the Sheriff's Clerk ; how William Wolfrych had fled, and being malcredited had been, after due sum mons, outlawed. The sympathy which the homicide had met with was, however, very apparent. The Sheriff was accountable to the Crown for 3s., the value of his Chattels ; but the Condover Jurors were liable to sentence for having concealed, or allowed the concealment of, these Chattels. Nay, William Wolfrich was still living in Cres sage, and the Vill was declared to be in misericordid for not now bringing him forward for trial or sentence.29 John Franceys (who was of Cressage) occurs as a Juror for Con dover Hundred at the Assizes of 1272, the Inquest of 1274, and the Assizes of 1292. He sat also on an Inquest at Little Buildwas in December 1302.

Even the Valor of Henry VIII. does not recognize its self-existence, and the Diocesan Registers down to that period never notice an Incumbent.

The Manor contained a Mill and some wood-land.3 Second in succession to Robert de Limesey (the Domesday Bishop of Chester) came Roger de Clinton, who, from the Archdeaconry of Buckingham (then in Lincoln Diocese), was elevated to this See, receiving Consecration from the hands of Archbishop William Cor bois, at Canterbury, on Sunday, December 22, 1129.'' Roger de Clinton was Nephew of the elder Geoffrey de Clinton, who, at the time of which we speak, was holding high office in the Court and Kingdom of Henry I. He was a Royal Treasurer and Chamberlain, a Justiciar commissioned to every part of the Realm; he also had the Shrievalty of Warwickshire in this very year, besides other Ferms for which he was accountable to the Crown.

Roger de Clinton is said to have founded Buildwas Abbey in 1135,6 a date which becomes extremely probable from evidence pre sently to be cited. He is also said to have been Founder of Fair well, a Benedictine Nunnery in Staffordshire. His evident interest in the prosperity of Kenilworth Priory may be attributed to his re lationship with Geoffrey de Clinton, its Founder. A Charter, which Roger de Clinton expedited to Shrewsbury Abbey, indicates a deep concern in the Parochial condition of his Diocese, and is in sym pathy and verbal concert with similar Charters of the Cotemporary Bishop of Hereford, perhaps the most exemplary Prelate of his day. Roger de Clinton has had various degrees of credit in regard of his contributions to the fabric of his Cathedral at Lichfield. The ques tion between large improvement and entire reconstruction cannot be settled by existing evidence, for the present Church contains little or nothing that can be assigned to his \u00e6ra. He increased the dignity of the Collegiate body by the addition of eight Pre bendaries, endowed apparently out of the revenues of the See. In 1139, Roger de Clinton was one of the five Dignitaries elected to represent the English Church at the tenth General Council, which, under the auspices of Pope Innocent II. , assembled in the Basilica of the Lateran on April 20 in that year. Not one authentic instance can I find of this Bishop's having attended the Courts of Henry I., Stephen, or the Empress. He joined the Crusade of 1147, and died at Antioch on April 16, 1148. The Writer of the Gesta Regis Stephani supplies us with a very different estimate of the character and conduct of Roger de Clin ton. Detailing the wretched state of England in the autumn (as I infer) of 1143, he makes severe remarks on the conduct of the Bishops ;\u2014 the cowardice and fickleness of some ; the violence and rapacity of others. The latter he describes as girt with the sword, clad in splendid armour, fortifying and manning their castles, op pressing and spoiling their neighbours, riding forth in the same ranks with the fiercest agitators of the period ;\u2014 the prime movers of enormities which they never attempted to palliate except by charging them on their subordinates. \" And,\" continues this Chronicler, 6 Tanner, quoting the Annals of Parcolude."], [784, "320 BUILDWAS. \" that I may at present keep silence about others, for it is indecent to stigmatize all equally, public rumour hath denounced the Bishops of Winchester, Lincoln, and Chester as more eagerly bent upon such unholy pursuits than any others.\" The individuals thus held up to infamy appear to be selected by this cotemporary writer, without the usual leaning which he exhibits to the cause of King Stephen. Henry of Winchester was the King's brother, and, though once his opponent, had been at a more recent period the main instrument of his restoration to the throne. There is some slight ground for supposing that Roger de Clinton was in turn associated with each of the political parties of his day ; but a temporizing spirit, which were venial in him, if a man of peace, was only servile treachery if combined with that love of cruelty and violence with which he is charged. Summarily the character of Roger de Clinton, Founder of Build was Abbey, is presented to us under contrasts which no ingenuity can reconcile. On the one hand we have the Simoniacal occupant of a Bishoprick, busy in fortifying the Castle of Lichfield, in sur rounding the town with a rampart, in converting the peaceful Tenants of a Spiritual Fief into Tenants by military service ; we have, in short, the picture of a ruffianly marauder and persecutor. On the other hand, we find him improving his Cathedral by a costly outlay, increasing the number and dignity of its collegiate members, originating or stimulating other Religious Foundations : we read his Charters warm with pious zeal and full of holy consi derations ; we see him representing Catholic England in the Coun cils of Christendom ; lastly, we behold the Crusader devoting his energies and his life to a cause as hazardous as it was accounted holy. We may gather from all this, not the specific truth which regards an individual, but a more general fact, viz. that the internecine war, which deluged this kingdom with crime and bloodshed, blotted also the records of the age with impenetrable falsehood. From the man and his ambiguous character, we now pass to the date and circumstances of one of his undoubted works. Among the various branches of the Benedictine Order, the Cis tercian arose in a.d. 1098, when its first House was founded at Citeaux, in Burgundy. It adopted a white habit, in contradistinc tion to the black dress of the original Benedictines. It affected other reforms of usage, chiefly revivals of a more ancient rule. Its presumptive purity soon increased its influence, and other Monas-"], [785, "321 BISHOP ROGER DE CLINTON. series were founded on the pattern of Citeaux. Amongst these was the Norman House of Savigny, originally a Hermitage situate in the woods which terminated the Southern frontier of the Diocese of Avranches. The probable date at which Savigny became a Cistercian Abbey was a.d. 1112, but it soon established itself as the leader of a separate Order, called Savigniac or Tironensian, during the period of its independence, but which in 1147 was, with most of its affiliations, reunited to the Cistercian Body. Meantime Savigny had two such affiliations in England, viz. Furness in Lancashire and Buildwas.7 Furness, which for a time resisted all reunion with Citeaux, had been founded in 1126 or 1127, or rather transferred to Furness in one of those years, after a previous so journ at Tulket in Amunderness. Its Founder was Stephen de Blois, then Earl of Boulogne, and afterwards King of England, whose Norman Fief of Moretain ad joined, if it did not comprise, the district in which Savigny was built. Buildwas, said to have been founded in 1135, was the second or third Savigniac House in England,8 but when it became simply Cistercian it lost this relative precedency. We have a transcript of Roger de Clinton's foundation-charter of Buildwas. Its inaccuracies, verbal and grammatical, are probably due to its Transcribers. In other respects it has every appearance of being derived from some genuine original. I give the Charter substantively as it stands in Dodsworth's MSS.9 Ego Rogerius Dei Gratia Cestrensis Episcopus, universis Sanct\u00e6 Matris Ecclesia filiis, prelatis et subditis, clericis et laicis, salutem.

Some internal evidence supports such a conclusion, \u2014 e.g. the first lay attestation, if rightly attributed to the Earl of Gloucester, indi cates the presence of a person who can have attended no peaceful meeting, in company with the Bishop of Chester, after Easter 1137. Nearly the same may be said of the Earl's Son-in-law William fitz Alan, who early in 1138 was in arms for the Empress, and before the close of the year an exile, \u2014 never restored to his Shropshire estates till seven years after the death of Bishop Clinton. It is also quite certain from external evidence that the gift implied by this Charter took place before August 1138, when King Stephen, occu pied in the siege of Shrewsbury, confirmed it. However, a diligent examination of the testing-clause of this Charter convinces me that it was not written at the time when the Bishop's grant was made, but some years later, and that the names which it embodies are of two classes, viz., \u2014 lst, some who were afterwards remembered by the Bishop to have been present when he gave Abbot Ingenulf formal seizin of Buildwas Manor, and 2ndly, some who, not having been then present, were afterwards witnesses and approvers of a Charter, written to record the conveyance and assure the Abbot's Title. Of the first class, as I take it, were the Earl of Gloucester, Wil liam fitz Alan, Philip de Belmeis, and perhaps other lay witnesses. Of the last class were Ralph Archdeacon of Stafford, Roger Arch deacon of Derby (neither of whom were in office till after 1139), and There were only two English Earls during the \u00e6ra of Roger de Clinton who bore the name of Robert. They were of Leicester and Gloucester, two words which bear about an equal resemblance to the mis nomer of the Transcript. All other asso ciations would make the Earl of Gloucester the most probable witness of this deed."], [787, "323 BISHOP ROGER DE CLINTON. perhaps Laurence Prior of Coventry, and the other ecclesiastical witnesses.14 The gift of Buildwas Manor and the Foundation of Buildwas Abbey belong, I doubt not, to the year 1135 or 1136, the written Record or Charter to a period perhaps ten years later.15 The next subject of* notice shall be King Stephen's Charter to Buildwas, which, though already printed, I must needs repeat here :16 \u2014 Stephanus Rex Anglorum, archiepiscopis, episcopis, abba tibus, comitibus, baronibus, justicariis, vicecomitibus, et omnibus fidelibus suis totius Angli\u00e6, salutem.

It confirms Bishop Roger's grant of the Manor as a grant made in consistencies and presumptuously reject ing them as forgeries. 14 Laurence, Prior of Coventry, has not yet been heard of earlier than 1144 ; and that gives him 35 years of office, for he lived till 1179. My estimate of Roger de Clinton's Charter to Buildwas is grounded on some general remarks of the late Mr. Stapleton in his notes to the Rotuli Normanni\u00e6 (Vol. I. p. lxxiv.). Mr. Stapleton seems to me to have understood and valued this class of evidence better than any other Antiquary, dead or living. 15 I have been very particular on this matter of date. Monastic Charters con stitute something like half of the histo rical evidences of that period. It is there fore of the greatest importance that we should ascertain howthese Charters passed, instead of seizing on their superficial in- 16 New Monasticon, Vol. V. p. 356."], [788, "324 BUILDWAS ABBEY. the King's presence, \u2014 another proof that verbal and public con cession was a mode of conveyance quite distinct from the written Charter, for the Bishop's Charter has no appearance of having passed before the King. The King's Charter also quotes the estimated hidage of Buildwas, and exempts the Manor from all dues and obligations appertaining to the Crown. The hidage given is that of Domesday, and the privileges allowed by the Usurper were afterwards respected by his lawful Successors on the Throne. Again, the King speaks of the Abbey as Savigniac, and as dedi cated to St. Chad. The latter was the Patron-Saint of Bishop Clinton's Cathedral at Lichfield, as well as of his Collegiate Church at Shrewsbury. When Buildwas became Cistercian, we of course expect to find it following the unvarying rule of that Order by as sociating the tutelage of the Virgin with that of its previous Patron ; but I shall presently show that this addition was made earlier, i. e. while Buildwas was simply Savigniac. Earl Symon de Silvanecta, who attests Stephen's Charter, should perhaps be noticed as iden tical with Simon de St. Liz, Earl of Northampton. The King's Charter is dated \" apud Salopesberiam in obsidione, anno Incarnationis Dominic\u00e6 mcxxxix, regni vero mei tertio.\" Here the Dominical year given is inconsistent with the regnal year, as well as with the historical fact ; for no part of the third year of Stephen fell later than Christmas 1138, and the Siege of Shrewsbury, which lasted a month, ended in a surrender between Aug. 21 and Aug. 28, 1138. This has been pointed out and com mented upon before;17 but the Charter involves another matter very pertinent to chronology and history. It is tested by Robert de Ferrars, whose services to Stephen are said to have procured him an Earldom in this very year.18 This Charter helps to prove his activity. He must have quitted the siege of Shrewsbury im mediately, for he commanded the men of Derbyshire at the Battle of the Standard which was fought on Monday, August 22, 1138, and in that very week Shrewsbury surrendered to Stephen. Milo de Gloucester, another witness of Stephen's Charter, was at the siege of Shrewsbury, but probably by no will of his own. Little more than a year after, he was apprised by the Earl of Gloucester of the Empress having landed at Arundel.

Philip de Belmeis, the last witness of Stephen's Charter, should be noticed more particularly in connection with Buildwas Abbey, to which, after the King and Bishop, he was probably the next benefactor. His Grant of Ruckley to \" Saint Mary and Saint Chad \" of Bildewas, I have printed, from the original, elsewhere.19 The Grantor acknowledges the reception of himself, his wife, and heirs into the fraternity of Buildwas, and of the Mother-Church of Savigny,\u2014 a proof that Buildwas, while simply Savigniac, adhered to so much of original Cistercian Rule as to acknowledge the tutelage of the Virgin. Belmeis's Charter passed about 1139, as I think, but more cer tainly before 1145, when he was enlisted in favour of another and very different Foundation. Another very early Benefactor to Buildwas was the first William fitz Alan, who is known to have died about Easter 1160. He gave Little Buildwas, an outlying member of his great Manor of Wrox eter, but only separated from the Bishop's land by the River Severn. The Charter conveying this grant is not known to be in existence, but it is expressly alluded to, and its contents distinctly enumerated and confirmed, by his Son, in a Deed which seems to have passed about 1175.20 Other early grants, by the Founder himself, we only hear of in subsequent confirmations, and these shall be cited in their place. To enumerate here all territorial Benefactions would interfere with my usual plan of giving such details under the localities concerned. Suffice it then to say, that although no collective Chartulary of Buildwas is known to exist, the deficiency may be almost supplied from the Inspeximus of Edward I., and from other public and private documents.51 19 Supra, Vol. II. p. 203.

These Charters not only"], [790, "326 BUILDWAS ABBEY. There is another story about the Foundation of Buildwas Abbey, which, as it was adopted by Leiand and indirectly strengthened by Dugdale, deserves some attention. Leiand tells us that\u2014 \"Matild de Bohun, Wife to Ser Robert Burnelle, Foundar of Bildevois Abbey (thowghe some for the only Gifte of the Site of the Howse, toke the Bysshope of Chester for Founder), was buried in the Presbitery at Dour.\"22 I am not aware who Matilda de Bohun, buried at Dore-Abbey, may have been ; but I presume that Leland's somewhat ambiguous sentence means to indicate Sir Robert Burnell as the Founder of Buildwas, not his Wife, as the Editors of the Monasticon have concluded. Dugdale, in his account of the Barony of Burnell, tells us of \" an old Martyrologe (sometime belonging to the Abby of Buldewas) which plainly demonstrated the great antiquity\" of that family.23 At the head ofthe succession, thus authenticated, stands Sir Robert Burnell, Knight, alleged to have died November 15, 1087, 20 Will. Conq. (where, by the way, we must read either 1086 or 1 Will. 2). This Sir Robert Burnell must be the same as he whom Glover reveals to us as \"a Knight in the army which Earl Roger de Belesme brought over to this kingdom with William the Conqueror,\" and as dying in 1087, and being \" buried at Buildwas in Salop.\" We need not stop to identify that never existent personage, Earl Roger de Belesme, or to talk of the man buried at Buildwas nearly 50 years before it was founded, nor yet to criticize the two schemes of succession, by which Glover and Dugdale pass through a series of else unheard-of Burnells till they arrive at a genuine Phihp Burnell, who died in 10 Edw. I. (1282), and about whom they both record something inaccurate. The truth I have already stated under Acton BurneU, and now repeat it. \u2014 The Bur nells were a family of moderate estate in Shropshire, heard of first in the reign of Henry II., and thenceforward, till, in the time of Henry III., the head of the house was outlawed for murder. His confiscated estates were in time repurchased by a relation, Robert Burnell, who, after various minor accessions of wealth and honour, came to be Bishop of Bath and Wells, Lord Chancellor of England, and the Founder of a splendid Barony. The \u00e6ra of BurneU's ChanceUorship corresponded with the time when the first Statute of Mort main dealt a heavy blow on Monastic interests. Alive to their prospective needs, the Monks of Buildwas bethought themselves of an ingenious plan for propitiating their powerful neighbour at Acton BurneU. Under the shape of a Martyrology they con cocted a genealogy of the BurneUs, which (whether we take Glover's or Dugdale's ver sion thereof) omits aU accurate mention of every known progenitor of the race, and is specially sUent about the Outlaw. The Ust commences with Sir Robert BumcU, who, as aforesaid, is made to die iu 1087. Him the Monks further adopted as their Founder. It is mortifying to find Leiand, Glover, and Dugdale dupes of such an imposture ; but the combination of creduUty and self-deception which wUl have brought the Monks of BuUdwas to be commemorating the deeds, praying for the souls, and perhaps pointing out the tombs, of men who never Uved, never died, and never were buried, is simply ludicrous. I now resume my account of the fortunes of Buildwas Abbey with the accession of Henry II.

This refers to a previous acquisition of the Monks. Gerold de Brelectun, a knight of the first William fitz Alan, had given them \" the land of Broctun.\" This estate was in the Parish of Sheriff-Hales, and is still known as Brockton Grange. In 1158 the Monks of Buildwas are excused two sums of 2s. 4d. and 4s. 2d., \u2014 their respective quota of the donum then collected in Staffordshire and Shropshire. In 1162 they are excused 2s. of the Danegeld of Staffordshire. Between the years 1163 and 1166 King Henry IL, being at Lich field, issued a Writ in favour of the Monks of Buildwas, which re quires some explanation, independently of its being inaccurately printed elsewhere.26 A charge, called cher chambre, had in the time of Henry I. been payable by a certain district of Shropshire to the Bishops of Coventry and Lichfield. This due Bishop Peche (con secrated in April 1161) had recently made over to the Monks of Buildwas, but the latter it seems were resisted in levying it. The King's Writ orders the Sheriff of Shropshire to enforce the Monks' right, by judicial process against the men of his Bailiwick. The Writ is tested by Geoffrey, Archdeacon of Canterbury. In 1174 King Henry II. is said to have subjected St. Mary's, Dublin, to Ranulf, Abbot of Buildwas.27 The date and circumstance are supported by a Charter. The King's act was in effect a ratifica tion of the previous arrangement of the Chapter of Savigni. In or about the year 1175 the second William fitz Alan expedited two Charters to Buildwas Abbey, confirming two former acts of his Father relative to Little Buildwas and Brockton. About the year 1177 Matthew, Abbot of Basingwerk, endea voured to free both his own House and that of Dublin from sub jection to Buildwas. He had appealed to Citeaux in the matter, but William, Abbot of Savigni, summoned both Abbots (Matthew 27 Monast.Hibern.(Axch.da$).

They obeyed. The Charters of Richard de Curci, Abbot of Savigni in 1156 and 1157, were pro duced, and settled the question. Abbot William of Savigni, in full Chapter, ratified the ascendency of Buildwas, and issued injunctions of obedience accordingly to Matthew, Abbot of Basingwerk, and to A., Abbot of Dublin.28 In 1182 we hear that Robert, Abbot of Buildwas, transferred the Seigneury over the Irish Abbey of Dunbrothy from Buildwas Abbey to St. Mary's, Dublin.29 Harvey de Montemarisco had, it seems, given Dunbrothy to Buildwas ; but Brother Alan, a Monk of Build was, having been over to inspect Dunbrothy, had found it waste and desolate. Hence this prudent transfer. On October 21, 1189, King Richard I., being at Winchester, granted a Charter to Buildwas, acquitting the Abbot and his men of all obligation to pay toll (theloneum) and other dues, anywhere in his dominions.30 The next day (October 22) the King expedited a general Charter of Confirmation to Buildwas, which may be taken to recite all the previous acquisitions of the Abbey. It ascribes to Bishop Roger (de Clinton) the grants of the Manor of Bildewas, of Meola (Monk Meole), and of the Chir chamber assessable on the two Hundreds of Wrockwardine and Condover;31 also, the grant of one man, named Edric, in the territory of Lichfield. It ascribes to Bishop Richard (Peche) the grants of a messuage in the Forgate of Chester, and of 4s., receivable yearly out of the Mill of Burne, near Lichfield. Then follow the grants of (Little) Buildwas, Brock ton, Ruckley, Cosford, and Hatton, as described elsewhere in these pages. Walter fitz Heremann had also given a moiety of Walton (in Staffordshire) ; Henry fitz Fulcher had given the land of Iven broc (in Derbyshire); William de Caldone, the land of Caldone (in Staffordshire) ; and Robert fitz Thomas, a house in some place, printed He ... . gfeld.32 A much more interesting piece of evidence is the Confirmation of Bishop Hugh de Novant to Buildwas Abbey. It is dated at Bildewes 28 Ecclesiastical Documents, pp. 52, 53. mained in Bishop Clinton's time (1129 1148).

It concedes to the Monks the place in which they are militant under the rule of St. Benedict, and under the Cistercian order. It also confirms the Vill of Meole and those Burgesses of Salop which belonged to the Bishops of Lichfield, and the tenure near Lichfield which Edric for merly held, and 4 solidates in the Mill of Burne, and half a mansure in the Foriate of Chester, which had been Herbert the Scrivener's, and the right to collect the corn called Chirchomber, \" which right the Bishop's predecessors were known to have enjoyed themselves, and to have conferred on the Monks, as appurtenant to the Manor of Bildewas and Meoles.\"34 The Charter was corroborated by the Seals and authority of the Bishop himself, his Chapter of Coven try,36 and his Chapter of Lichfield. In this same year (1192) we hear of another quarrel between the Houses of Buildwas and Basingwerk. The latter House had re- newed an attempt to withdraw itself and Dublin from tlie jurisdic- tion of Buildwas, and to subject both to the immediate control of Savigni. William, Abbot of Savigni, aud the cotemporary Abbot of Clairvaux, sitting at Clairvaux in judgment, again decided that Basingwerk and Dublin were subject to Buildwas, as Daughters.36 This decision was recited and confirmed in the same year by Wil liam, Abbot of Citeaux, as head of all Cistercian houses,.

On October 24, 1198, King Richard I., then at Roche Andeley, expedited a Charter whereby the Monks of Buildwas were entitled to hold all their lands, whether already obtained or thereafter to be ob tained, free and quit of all waste and regard of the King's Forest.38 Soon after this, I think, \"H.\" (perhaps Huctred) \"Abbot of Buildwas\" caused transcripts to be made of the Charters which proved the subjection of Basingwerk and Dublin to his House. These transcripts, verified by W., Abbot of Cumbe, W., Abbot of Miraval, and W., Abbot of Stanle (Stoneleigh), were forwarded over sea to W., Abbot of Citeaux, presiding over a Chapter of his Order.39 In Hilary Term 1221, an unusual but curious subject occupied the attention of the Courts at Westminster. It was the expediency of altering a certain pass in the Royal Forest near to Buldewas, the spot having become notorious as a haunt of Malefactors, and for the constant commission of crimes. The History of Buildwas Abbey during the thirteenth Century involves little more than will be found classified under its various Dependencies. The Hundred-Rolls of 1255 do not so much as mention the Manor, obviously because it was extra-hundredal. The Abbot seems to have obtained a Charter from Edward I., dated September 14, 1290. This Charter does not remain on the Rolls, but we gather from another Record that it was, in part at least, an Inspeximus of one of Richard I.'s Charters. The Charter inspected was recited most fully in this instance, as far as privileges were con cerned, and it seems doubtful whether it was not different to either of the three Charters of Richard I. already quoted. It allowed to the Church of St. Mary of Buldewas all the lands and tenements previously granted thereto, and that the Monks should hold both those lands and all lands thereafter acquired, free and quit of geld, danegeld, scutage, fines for murder and larceny, also of hidage, of shires and hundreds (that is the suit thereof), of military services 33 Forest Roll, Salop, No. VI. 30 Ecclesiastical Documents, p. 54.

The Charter explains the comparative obscurity in which the internal affairs of Buildwas Abbey are buried. The Taxation of 1291 gives us the first general statement of the possessions of this House. In Hereford Diocese it derived from Kynnerton, Wentnor, Ragdon, and Hope Bowdler an income of \u00a36. 7s. lOd. from lands and rents, and \u00a39. lOd. from live-stock.41 In Lichfield Diocese, and Stafford Archdeaconry, it had, from Walton, Brockton, and Cuddesdon, an income of \u00a321. 18s. 6d.*2 Its gross income from places in the Archdeaconry of Salop was \u00a376. 12s. 3fi?.43 Its total temporalities, that is, excluding Churches, Tithes, etc., may therefore be put at \u00a3113. 19s. 5d. per annum. Of this sum Build was Grange, that is the Abbey Manor (not including Little Build was), yielded \u00a315.; or \u00a34. 10s. on six carucates of land and \u00a310. 10s. on live-stock.43 On February 6, 1292, Edward I.'s ample Inspeximus of Buildwas Charters passed the Great Seal.44 Its chief contents are already printed, and will be or have been cited elsewhere in these pages. In 1301 the old disputes about the supremacy over Dublin were revived. The Abbot of Savigni now claimed the honour against Buildwas ; but a General Chapter, presided over by John, Abbot of Citaux, and sitting at Citeaux, decided once more for Buildwas. William de Ashburne, who on this occasion acted as Proctor for Buildwas, was a Monk of the House, but afterwards became Abbot of Dublin. The existing Abbot of Dublin was Roger de Brugor, who also had been a Monk of Buildwas, and who died in 1309.45 I should here observe that the Diocesan Registers of Lichfield do not afford the slightest evidence that the Bishops of that See retained any right of Patronage over Buildwas Abbey. A Letter of Bishop Ro\u00b0-er de Northburgh to the Abbot of Buildwas, dated at Eccles hall on January 14, 1324-5, not only precludes all idea of friendly 40 Placita de Quo Waranto, p. 145. \u00ab Rot.

The Bishop had been commissioned by the Pope to collect the biennial tenth, last accruing to the Apostolick See. The Abbot had pertinaciously, the Bishop says insolently, neglected to pay his quota. After plen tiful abuse the Bishop threatens to proceed to the publication of censures (meaning excommunication) against the Abbot, in such Churches and places as shall seem expedient, unless the Abbot pays before the 2nd of February.46 In 1342, John, Abbot of Buildwas, attending a general Chapter at Citeaux, confirmed to St. Mary's Dublin a supremacy over the Abbey of Dunbrothy.47 I now pass to the Valor of Henry VIII., in whose seventh year (1535-6), Stephen, then Abbot of Byldwas, declared the Revenues of his House to be as follows. \u2014 Byldwas itself, that is the Abbey Manor, yielded \u00a320. 9s. 8d. ; \u2014 the land being partly in hand and partly let to tenants. Little- Byldwas yielded \u00a318. 11s. 8d. Other Shropshire Manors and es tates yielded \u00a364. 13s. 10c?. From Derbyshire came \u00a36., from Staf fordshire \u00a39. 3s. 4d. The tithes receivable from Leighton and Hatton were \u00a36. The Abbot of Lilleshall paid a fee-farm rent of \u00a34. 3s. 4d. for certain land at Longdon upon Tern. The Manor- Court (of Buildwas I presume) yielded 5s. The total temporalities aud spiritualities of Buildwas Abbey were therefore \u00a3129. 6s. lOd. The outgoings on this income were put at \u00a318. 7s. 6\u00b1d., leaving a net balance of \u00a3110. 19s. 3\u00b1d.*9 The Ministers' Accounts of 1536-7 estimate the gross income of the then dissolved Abbey of Byldewas, at about \u00a330. more than the Valor. The excess was chiefly in the valuation put upon the re ceipts from Great and Little Buildwas, which, instead of \u00a339. Is. 4d. per annum, were increased to \u00a361. 16s. Id.; but the Site of the Monastery was an item in the later calculation. Also, the Rectory or Rectorial tithes of Buildwas were now reckoned as \u00a35. 13s. 4d., an item which does not appear in the Valors-' In the year after that in which this account was taken, the King granted the Site of the Abbey, with all its possessions in Shropshire, Staffordshire, aud Derbyshire, to Edward Grey, Lord Powis.

In one instance he attests as Ingenulf, Abbot, without any specification of his Convent.50 Ranulph first occurs as Abbot of Buildwas in the testing-clause of Bishop Walter Durdent's Confirmation to Lilleshall Abbey.61 This Charter probably passed between 1149 and 1152.

Huctrad, Abbot of Bildewas, attests a Charter of the second William fitz Alan,57 which probably passed just before that Baron's decease, and so in the year 1210.

It may be worth noting, as a matter for architectural investigation, that a Deed, already stated to have passed about the year 1220, indicates that the Monks were then engaged in, or contemplating, consider able additions to their buildings ; and that the stone which they proposed to use was to be procured from Quarries, which lay within the Manor of Broseley and adjacent to the River Severn.73 One word, in conclusion, as to the Site of Buildwas,\u2014 a matter rather for the historian than the Architect.

Hence also comes it to pass that in the present day Cistercian Ruins are preserved in a greater proportion than the Ruins of other Monasteries. Their materials have not stood ob jectively available for utilitarian or ignoble purposes. Now at length the time has come when a changed state of feeling again views such Ruins as sacred ;\u2014 sacred to departed genius and taste, sacred to the ever-living beauty of grandeur and repose, sacred indeed to yet higher and holier associations, of which nothing but a too narrow Sectarianism would forbid the indulgence. Cijt \u00a3o ncj tfomt. The Royal Forests of Shropshire originated in one or other of two natural conditions of the soil. The spontaneous and undis turbed growth of timber over a large area suggested the afforestation of the Forests of Morf and Wyre. The existence of large districts, so mountainous or sterile as to be unavailable for agriculture, formed a nucleus for such Forests as Shirlot, The Clee, The Stiperstones, The Wrekin, and the Long Forest. The framework, as it may be termed, of the Long Forest, has^its readiest exponent in a modern Map. Its chief constituents were several series of mountains or hills. \u2014 From Halford on the south-west, to Much Wenlock on the north-east, there extends a continuous Ridge or Terrace, rnow known, throughout its length of fifteen miles, as Wenlock Edge. This was the primary feature of the Forest so aptly termed Long. The Valley or Basin which flanks this Terrace on the north-west is again bounded by a parallel but more broken and unequal chain of hills. The Stretton, Caradoc, Lawley, Frodesley, and Acton-Bur nell Hills form this series. Again, crossing an interval of country to the north-west of this series, we have the range of the Long Mynd, five miles in extent, on the one hand, and the isolated Lyth Hill on the other. Another step to north-west of the Long Mynd, and we reach the high grounds about Linley. Here we pause,"], [808, "336 THE LONG FOREST. for we are on the confines of the Stiperstones Forest, a Chase and Jurisdiction annexed from time immemorial to the Barony of Caus. Such are the great physical features of the district once involved in the Long Forest ; and we obtain nearly the same idea of its ex tent and area if we consider the Manors, Vills, and Woods which were subject to its jurisdiction. \u2014 \u25a0 The whole of the Domesday Hundred of Condover was within the Jurisdiction of the Long Forest, except the three Manors of Build was, Sheinton, and Belswardine, which belonged to the Bailiwick of Shirlot. In Patinton Hundred, the Jurisdiction of the Long Forest involved the Manors of Burton, Eaton under Heywood, Easthope, Gretton, Lutwych, Millichope, Patton, Rushbury, Shipton, and Stanway, with all their members. Perhaps it involved the Manor of Acton Round, and at Presthope at least it trenched on the Manor of Much Wenlock. In Culvestan Hundred the Jurisdiction of the Long Forest ex tended to the whole or parts of the Manors of Corfham, Diddlebury, Culmington, Siefton, Aston-Munslow, Bouldon, Cardington, Corf ton, Hope Bowdler, Great and Little Sutton, and Middlehope. At Wetlington too it touched on the Manor of Stokesay, and at Din chope and Halford it involved perhaps a part of Bromfield. In Lenteurde Hundred this Jurisdiction involved Acton Scott, Chelmick, Alcaston, Myndtown, Plaish, Wittingslow, Wistanstow, Strefford, and Church Stretton with all its members. In Rinlau Hundred, \u2014 -this Jurisdiction involved Munede, Edgton, and perhaps Sibdon. At Medlicott it trenched on the Manor of Wentnor. At Asterton and Aston Wood it was invading the Bishop of Hereford's rast Manor or rather Province of Lydbury North. In Ruesset Hundred, the Regard of the Long Forest involved the Manor of Longden ; and Sutton and Brace Meole, though within the very Liberties of Shrewsbury, were not exempt from this ex traordinary Jurisdiction. The maintenance or relaxation of the Jurisdiction of the Long Forest will best be traced by quoting the successive documents which bear upon the matter. The Forest-Roll of 1180 suggests that very few concessions in the way of assart or imbladement had been allowed to the inhabitants of the district. Rushbury, Harley, Cres sage, Langley, and Westhope were the favoured Fills. In Kenley, Longeville,1 and Hope (Bowdler), amercements were inflicted for waste or pourpresture. 1 This is LongvUle in the Dale, \u2014 now Cheney-LongvUle, \u2014 noticed Vol. III. p. 318."], [809, "337 THE LONG FOREST. In 1209 the Regard of the Long Forest shows that indulgences had been extended to the Lords or the Inhabitants of a far greater number of Vills. Kenley, Harley, Hughley, Cressage, Preen, Acton Burnell, Longnor, Frodesley, Pitchford, Netley, Stapleton, Woolstaston, Condover, with its members of Dorrington, Ryton, Westley, Wheatall, and Allfield; also Rushbury and Easthope, Wilston, Ragdon and Chatwall, Westhope, Chelmick, Acton Scott, Wittingslow, Myndtown, Edgton, and Affcot, had all been suffered to increase their area of cultivation, or had compounded for so doing. A Forest Jurisdiction, as I have before observed, limited the right of ownership in all the Woods of the district. The Survey of Shropshire Forests in 1235 reports on the state of a great number of Woods and Boses which appear to have been subject to the Jurisdiction of the Long Forest. I have stated elsewhere what the Surveyors said about the Boses of Kenley, Great Preen, Little Preen, Stanwey, Frodesley, Burywood (which belonged to Condover), and Longnor.

Condover, Ryton, The Lithe, Staplewood, Langley, Wilderhope, Stanwey, Millichope, Corfton, Sibton, Simington, Dod dinghop (Dinchope), Woolston, Rushbury, Gippoles, Frodesley, Wis tanstow, The Marsh, Hope Bowdler, Ragdon, Longnor, Dorrington, Netley, Pulverbatch, and Gretton. On this occasion Geoffrey de Langley' s proceedings were not all concessions. He seized into the King's hand Walter de Clifford's Wood in the Long Forest,\u2014 evidently Siefton Wood. It still re mained in the King's hand in 1255, and was, it seems, better taken care of than when Clifford had it.29 In 1255 the Jurors of Munslow Hundred were questioned as to 24 Perhaps Steplewood was the word obliterated.

These re ceipts had been handed over to Peter de Muneton (Forester of that district), and transmitted by him to the Sheriff.32 At the Forest Assizes of 1262, Ralph de la Lowe and Hugh de Kynsedele (or his successor, Hamo de Middleton) accounted for twelve years' agistment (from 1251 to 1262 inclusive) received from The Lye, Bissemore, and Havechurste, as the three Royal Hayes are called. For one year (1251) the Pesson of the Lye had wholly failed. In another (1252) it had yielded \u00a34. In the same year Bissemore and Havechurste together had only yielded 16s. At these same Assizes the Regard of the Jurisdiction now under notice is appropriately entered as the Regard of Long-Forest, Strat ton Dale, and Longemunede . Imbladements were assessed in Little Sutton, Medlicott, Ratlinghope, Langley, Kenley, Harley, Wilderley, Smethcott, Dorrington, and Longnor. The Boses of Siefton and Munslow, \" within the aforesaid Regard,\" were stated to be wasted, as I have elsewhere particularized.

THE LYE FOREST, NOW LYTHWOOD. There are some particulars, proper to the King's Haye of Lith wood, which would only have interrupted the above general account of the Long Forest, and which I therefore add here. On August 29, 1226, King Henry III., then at Shrewsbury, orders the Chief Forester of Shropshire to allow the Canons of St. Chad four oak-trees in the Bosc of Lye, towards the building of their Church.48 In the Pipe-Roll of 1228 the following Fine is recorded. The men (freeholders) of Westley, Great Lye, Welbatch, Newbold, Beyston, Pulley, Little Lye, and Norton, render account of ten merks, that they may have pasture for the cattle of their demesnes, in The Lye, except in the Fence-Month .- they pay \u00a35. 13s. 4d. down, and owe \u00a31. They further pay one merk for the year's rent of such pasture ; which sum they are to pay yearly as long as they shall enjoy the same by the King's pleasure. This annual rent of one merk is charged more or less regularly on the Pipe-Rolls of succeeding years ; but it appears that about the year 1232 John de Monemue, then Justice of the Forest, ejected the said Freeholders from their pasturage. It was not till the year 1280 that the matter was properly settled. On June 25, of that year, Edward I. directs the Sheriff of Shropshire to in quire how the matter stood, and, if he found that the said Free holders were not enjoying the said pasturage, he was to acquit them of the said annual rent of one merk, with all arrears, and to restore any cattle of theirs which might have been taken in distress. The Sheriff returned an Inquest, taken in full County 48 Clans. II. 135."], [819, "347 SHREWSBURY HUNDRED. Court, before himself and the Coroners. The Jury described the original Fine with Henry III., the disseizure of the Freeholders 3\u00b1 years after, and their consequent want of all benefit of the Fine for 48 years past. \" Nevertheless,\" said the Jurors, \" they have paid and still pay the said merk annually to the Sheriffs of Salop, for the King's use.\"49 END OF CONODOVRE HUNDRED. I^ljretostap Jftmtrretr. Domesday designates this Hundred sometimes as that of Sciropes berie, sometimes as the Hundredum Civitatis.1 Circumstances oblige me to deal with the Hundred of Shrewsbury in an exceptional way. Domesday points it out as involving, or paying geld upon, 100 hides.2 Of those hundred hides, we are not able to distinguish the precise locality of more than 6| from the evidence of Domesday. The locality of 2 hides more, though uncertified in Domesday, may be fixed with the aid of subsequent Records. Half a hide more, though it has distinct mention in Domesday , is unallocated in that Record, and must remain so, for want of later evidences to show its position. 49 Inquisitions, 8 Edward I., No. 45, b. 2 Domesday, so. 252, a, 1. This is a signal proof that the Hide was not an invariable measure of extent, but a measure of comparative value. It would be absurd to suppose that the City Liberties contained an area equal to that of Condover Hundred ; yet such would be the residt of assuming the hide to have consisted of a definite number of measured acres. Thus the Domes day Hundreds of Alnodestreu and Con detret were perhaps originally Half-Hun dreds, and Overs perhaps a Quarter- Hundred; but Patintun, Culvestan, and Conodovre Hundredsappear mDomesday, each with such a hidage as leaves it sup posable that they were originally Hundreds in the strict sense of the term. 1 It seems that Domesday does not here recognize' the usual distinction, which ap plies the title of Civitas or City only to Cathedral towns. In a great majority of instances Domesday observes the distinc tion, and applies the terms Burgus or Villa to such towns as were not Episcopal Sees. I think it possible that the existence of such a Church as St. Chad's at Shrews bury may have been deemed sufficient to entitle the town to the rank of a Civitas. However, the town of Leicester is also called Civitas in Domesday, and though the Bishop of Lincoln had two Churches in Leicester, they can hardly be reckoned as equal, in coUegiate dignity with St. Chad's."], [820, "348 SHREWSBURY HUNDRED.

My rule shall be that, where Domesday asserts a distinct tenure within the City Liberties, I will give a separate account of that tenure, carrying it on to later times, where materials for doing so exist. This plan will leave a large surplus, viz. 90| hides, under the indefinite title of Shrewsbury and its Suburbs. With that item I do not propose to deal. The general History of Shrewsbury has been already written, and so written as that any reproduction thereof must needs be either a plagiarism or a failure. That the said History might be improved by an appendix is possible, \u2014 an ap pendix dealing especially with territorial, or rather civic, boundaries and with the early changes of property within the Borough. But this task is beside my present scope, and beyond my present power. It is a thing of itself, and I may neither promise to my Readers or to myself that distant future which would alone suffice for so large an undertaking. The annexed Table of the Civic Hundred of Shrewsbury requires one or two remarks. The description of Earl Roger's Sub-tenants in the 90f unallocated hides of Shrewsbury is necessarily a general one. These Sub-tenants were, of course, the community of Bur gesses, French and English, except those who held their Burgages under Ralph de Mortimer, or the Bishop of Chester, and except those who held their Burgages not immediately under the Earl, but mediately, under one or other of the Shrewsbury Churches. In the latter category we should place 39 Burgesses whom the Earl had made over to his recent foundation, \u2014 the Abbey of St. Peter. The present Liberties of Shrewsbury contain all that was in volved in the Domesday Hundred, and much more besides. The annexation to Shrewsbury of several Manors out of Condover Hun dred has already been shown. We shall hereafter see how the Borough extended its boundaries into every other Hundred which bordered it at Domesday. Lastly, I should point out that, whereas Shrewsbury consisted in Saxon times of the exact number of 100 hides, we may infer that that was the primary idea and condition of all Hundreds. Where any variation occurs, we may presume that the original estimate had been tampered with in its details, or perhaps authoritatively changed. In cases where Districts, consisting of 50 hides or there abouts, have got the name of Hundreds, it is easy to see that the original District was a Half- Hundred, and that the arithmetical dis tinction of name had become obsolete."], [822, "350 ffltolt 3Srace+ This Manor was one of those which Domesday classifies as held by Ralph de Mortimer of the King, without any mesne right or interest of the Norman Earl. \u2014 \"The same Radulf (de Mortemer) holds Melam.

In demesne there are m ox-teams, and (there are) vi Serfs, im Female Serfs, vi Vil lains, and in Boors, with m teams, and one Radman with half a team. To this Manor belong ix Burgesses within the City (of Shrewsbury), and a Mill of 20s. (annual value). In King Edward's time, and afterwards, the Manor was worth \u00a37. (per annum). Now it is worth \u00a313. 5s. 6d.'n I have pointed out, under Cleobury Mortimer, that Edith, the Queen of Edward the Confessor, is the person described in the above and other passages of Domesday under the name Eddid.2 Queen Edith's estate near Shrewsbury, consisting of Meole, Edge bold, and a great part of Pulley, had probably passed from her hands to those of William fitz Osborn, Earl of Hereford, had been forfeited by his Son, Earl Roger de Bretolio, in 1074, and had then been granted by King William to Ralph de Mortimer. That such grants were in diminution of the Palatinate of the Norman Earl of Shrewsbury is obvious ; not less obvious is that policy of the King which suggested these checks on provincial absolutism. It is probable that, in the hands of Mortimer, Edgebold and a great part of Pulley became so involved in Meole, that all three Manors are occasionally described as Meole. The two first were also withdrawn from Condover Hundred, and were eventually an nexed, like Meole, to the Liberties of Shrewsbury. Of this col lective Manor of Meole we are told that Hugh de Mortimer (of AVigmore) was seized in demesne at the time of Henry II. 's acces sion, but that he subsequently enfeoffed William Martel, a Knight, therein. William Martel, we are also told, gave Meole in turn to Audulf de Braci. Something of this kind probably took place ; but we know that Roger de Mortimer, son and heir of Hugh, denied both the above feoffment and gift, and that, after the death of the 1 Domesday, so. 260, b, 1. | - Supra, Vol. IV. pp. 193, 194."], [823, "351 MEOLE BRACE. first Audulf de Braci, of whom we have record, Roger de Mortimer seized upon Meole as his own demesne. Hence arose a series of litigation, perhaps the most protracted of any which I shall have to record, but so interesting in many particulars, that I will not materially abridge its successive stages.\u2014 At Westminster, April 27, 1203.\u2014 An Assize came on for hearing, under the form of mort d'ancestre, viz. \" whether Adolph, father of Adolph de Bracy (the present Plaintiff), was seized in demesne as of fee, on the day he died, of the Manor of Mole, which Manor Roger de Mortimer was now holding.\" Mortimer put in no reason for postponing the Trial. However, the Bench adjourned it till the Justices-in-Eyre should visit Shropshire. The reason was that the Recognizors, most of them, had essoigned their attendance at West minster. Other Recognizors, who were unessoigued, and whose future attendance was to be enforced by attachment, were William Pantolf, Hugh de Upton, Griffin Galet, Daumer de Rodinton, and Simon Falconer.3 The Justices-in-Eyre were sitting at Shrewsbury on October lst, 1203. On that day they accepted the essoign of R.oger de Mor timer, in a plea of mort d'ancestre against Audulf de Brascy, and adjourned the hearing till October 16th at Worcester. Mortimer's Essoignors were Oliver Costard and Robert de la Cote ; his Sureties were WilUam de Spineto and Adam le Sauvage.4 The case was heard at Gloucester, and not at Worcester, but in the same Eyre. The Jury found that Audulf, the Father, had died seized of the Manor of Moles ; so judgment went for Audulf, the Son, who was to have seizin thereof, while Mortimer was left in misericordid} Before I proceed with this litigation, I should introduce a cotem porary notice which we have of Audulf de Braci. Fulk fitz Warin's outlawry probably took place about May 1201, and continued till November 1203. The Fitz Warin Chronicle calls Aldulf de Bracy his Cousin, and implies that he shared his exile in Little-Brittany in 1 201 .6 The outlawed companions of Fulk fitz Warin are enumerated with apparent fulness on the Rolls of the period, but Audulf de Bracy is never mentioned as one of them. If then we are to accept the statement of the Chronicle, we must further understand that 3 Placita, Pasch. Tm. 4 John, m. 5. Roll of the same Term.

To proceed with the litigation. \u2014 Mortimer was not to be baffled by the decision against him. He now turned Plaintiff, and sued Audulph de Braci in a general form for the land of Moles. An un dated Assize- Roll, but which I think belongs to February 1204, states this suit to have come before Geoffrey fitz Piers and his asso ciates at York. Strange to say, De Braci appeared in Court and pleaded that he was under age. This Mortimer denied. The issue then, to be first tried, was this one of age, which was adjourned to the morrow of the Close of Easter, \u2014 i. e. to May 3 (if the year was 1204) A A second undated Roll, probably of that Term, further adjourns the Placitum terr\u00e6 and the Placitum de \u0153tate faciendd which Mor timer had against Braci, to the hearing of the King on the morrow ofthe Holy Trinity (June 21, if in 1204). 8 Then the Placitum de \u0153tate was further adjourned to October 6, because the Recognizors were not all in attendance. Herbert Mauveisin, Richard de Lecton (Leighton), and Thomas de Costentin, are named as Defaulters on this and several previous occasions, and the Sheriff was ordered to have their persons in Court.8 I hear nothing further of this suit for more than a year ; but in Easter Term 1206, Audulf de Braci receded from the Placitum de \u0153tate, probably because time had made it no longer a question. The Court ordered the issue of a fresh writ (breve originate), com mitting Braci to the Suit de terra de Moles ; and Mortimer named Baldwin de Gusering or John de * * *, his Attorney therein.9 In Trinity Term, 1206, the case-was called on. John de Bacoinot, Mortimer's Attorney, appeared, but Audulf de Braci made default. The land was, as usual, seized by the Crown, and the Litigants stood summoned for June 25.10 On that very day Audulf de Braci appeared in Court and replevied his land ;10 the Suit was adjourned to October 20.10 On January 27, 1207, the case appears in Bald win de Cuserigg's care, as Mortimer's Attorney, but could not be heard because the Sheriff had neglected the return of some Writ connected therewith.11 On January 27, 1208, I get another glimpse 7 Placita tempore Regis Johannis, No. 59, m. 4 dorso. 10 Placita, 7, 8 John, mm. 9 dorso, 15 recto, 16 recto. 8 Placita, Roll No. 7, mm. 3 and 5. 9 Placita, Pasch.

William de Kantelupe, who, as we know, was a near connection of De Bracy. It was not till Sunday, May 18, 1208, that the pleadings were fully heard. The process was as follows.\u2014\" Roger de Mortimer seeks against Audulf de Bracy the Manor of Moles with its appurtenances, as his right, and as a Manor whereof his (Mortimer's) Ancestors, from the Con quest of England, were seized, as of their right, both in the time of King Henry, the King's Grandfather (meaning Henry I.), and after wards, even to the time of King Henry, the King's Father ; \u2014 in whose time, Hugh, the Plaintiff's Father, was seized, of fee and of right, to wit by taking esplees thereof to the value of 10s., and more ; \u2014 and of this the Plaintiff has sufficient evidence (sedam sufficien tem).\" \"And Audulf appears and denies (defendit) the Plaintiff's right to hold the Manor in demesne, but he well acknowledges that the aforesaid Hugh (de Mortimer) was once seized thereof in de mesne, and that he (Hugh) gave the Manor to a certain Knight, William Martel, to wit for his homage and service, which William took esplees thereof, as in his own right, for many years ; and he (William Martel) afterwards gave it to Audulf de Bracy, the De fendant's Father, for his homage and service; which Audulf took esplees thereof and died seized thereof; and from him the Manor descended to the Defendant as his heir. And this the Defendant offers to try (dirationare) against the Plaintiff, as he ought to try it, viz. that the land was so given.\"12 The technical language which follows should be explained rather than translated. As an alternative the Defendant offers to decide the matter by duel. He names one Wigan, a free man of his own, as his champion ; or if any accident should happen to Wigan (be fore he entered the lists), another should be named, competent to the business. Mortimer accepts the challenge, and names his free man Robert de Brocton as his champion. The Court does not seem to have adopted the proposal of a duel, but named June 15 as a day for the parties to appear before the King and hear sen tence. A marginal note intimates that De Braci proposed the De Braci. The history of the Bedford shire Manor of Eaton, which I shall pre sently trace, suggests such an idea. . 12 Placita, Pasch.

Wager of Battle, in case another plea, which he had, were unavail ing, viz. \"that the person who ought to warrant the Manor to himself was beyond sea.\"13 The Absentee was, I conclude, the heir of William Martel. On June 15, 1208, sentence in this cause was deferred till July 22.13 Meantime, Audulf de Bracy cancelled his appointment of William de Kantilune as his Attorney, and named William de St. Edward instead.13 A Patent of July 26, 1208, now comes in, not explaining, but very materially complicating this story. Wigan de Mara, Servant (Serviens) of William de Cantilupe, the King's Seneschal, has Letters of Protection freeing him from all Suits of County and Hundred, etc., \" so long as he shall be in the service of the said Seneschal, forthe purpose of making trial (pro disracione faciendd) on behalf of the said Seneschal, between him and Roger de Mortimer concerning the land of Moles.\" It is evident from this that Wigan, probably a professed duellist, was really Cantilupe's servant, and had been engaged while Cantilupe was yet Bracy's Attorney. The question is, why Cantilupe, though dismissed by Bracy, retained the Bravo in his employ, and how Cantilupe comes to figure as principal in a suit against Mortimer about Meole. My only suggestion is that there was a cross-suit instituted by Canti lupe, of which the Assize-Rolls fail to inform us, but of which we shall have other evidence in the sequel. In October 1208 William de St. Edward essoigned his appearance before the King at Gloucester, as Attorney in the Suit between Mortimer and Braci. The hearing was adjourned to April 6, 1209.14 I hear no more of this Suit or Suits ; but I can quote the Fine which ended them, and which was levied before the King himself at Westminster, in January 1211. The fine purports to be between \" Roger de Mortimer, Plaintiff, and Audulf de Brascy, Tenant, of the Manor of Moles with its appurtenances, whereof there was Plea between them.\" Roger now recognizes Audulf's right to the premises, \" so, however, as that William de Cantlup and his heirs shall hold the whole Manor aforesaid under Roger and his heirs for ever, doing therefore the service of one knight in lieu of all other services. And the same Audulf and his heirs shall hold a moiety of the aforesaid Manor under the same William and his heirs for ever, doing therefore the service of half a knight's fee in lieu of all services. This moiety was not to include any part of 13 Ibidem, mm. 9 recto, 14 dorso. '4 Placita, No. 68, m. 5."], [827, "355 MEOLE BRACE. the Capital Messuage, which was to remain to Cantlup and his heirs quietly and for ever. For the above recognition, fine, and concord, the aforesaid William de Cantlup gave to the said Roger 300 merks of silver.\" I cannot explain this transaction further than by saying that it held good for ages. Cantilupe's conduct and concern in the matter are from first to last inexplicable. Some trading or treachery on his part had probably to be concealed, and that which does not transpire in the Records of that shameless period is in no dan ger of minute exposure now. I have said that William de Cantilupe and Audulf de Bracy were connected. Though at the expense of a considerable digres sion, I will make that point good at once ; for everything that bears on the origin and rise of the great House of Cantilupe is of impor tance, and, as regards one section of my future history, is essen tial. The first wife of WiUiam de Cantilupe was Mascelina, daughter of the first Audulf de Braci and sister or half-sister of Audulf de Braci, party to the above fine. This is proved, or rather illus trated, as follows. \u2014 I believe, and can partly verify, a statement that King John gave the Manor of Eaton (Bedfordshire) to Ardulf de Braci.15 If so, the Grantee was the first Ardulf, and the grant must have taken place in the first four years of King John's reign, for the said Ardulf (as we have seen) was deceased in April 1203. Certain it is that Audulf de Brascy, father of Mascebna, wife of the first William de Cantilupe, gave or confirmed land in Eaton (Bedfordshire) to Dunstaple Priory, and certain it is also that, after the said first Audulf 's death, William de CantUupe got possession of Eaton, not as heir, but by grant of King John. On March 28, 1204, that King, being at Windsor, orders the Con- (vide Patent, 2 John, m. 28). The Dun staple Register further contains a Deed of which the following is an extract : \u2014 Ego Adulfus de Braci confirmavi terram de Sortegrave, qu\u00e6 est de feodo meo de Ey tone, ut invent Conventum (de Dunstaple) seisitum, quando Rex mihi dedit Manerium de Eytone. 15 Lysons 's Bedfordshire, p. 78. \u2014 It appears from the Register of Dun staple (Harl. MSS. 1885, so. 24), that in the reign of Henry I., Osbert Martel was Lord of \u00c6^<on,including one third of Sorte grave,where he made a grant to Dunstaple Priory. It further appears that Ingeram, Butler to Queen Eleanor, living in the reigns of Henry II. and Riehard I., and surviving the accession of John, confirmed Osbert Martel's grants in Sortegrave, and made other grants in Sortegrave and Et than to Dunstaple and to Fontevrauld These facts, together with what is said in the text, prove that Audulf de Braci's seizin of Eaton was between Ingeram Pin cerna's and William de Cantilupe's, and so between 1199 and 1204."], [828, "356 MEOLE BRACE. stable of Berkhampstead to give William de Kantilupe full seizin of the Manor of Eton.16 A Charter of April 4, 1205, explains this Order. The King had previously given to William de Can tilupe the Berkshire Manor of Cockeswell. He now gives him in exchange for Cockeswell the Bedfordshire Manor of Eyton, in fee and inheritance,17 for one knight's-fee; but Cantilupe pays the King 300 merks for the exchange.18 On June 20, 1209, William de Cantilupe settles, by fine, a dis pute which he had with the Prior of Dunstaple about 50 acres in Sorcegrave (Shortgrave), a member of Eiton. Cantilupe quit-claims not only the said 50 acres, but also 20 acres in Eiton, being part of 40 acres which the Prior claimed in virtue of a grant made to his House by Audulf de Brascy, father of Mascelina, wife of the afore said William.19 I shall recur to these details on a future occasion, and will now proceed with my account of Meole, as held by Cantilupe under Mortimer of Wigmore, Cantilupe's Under-Tenant in a moiety thereof, being that Audulf de Braci, in whose tenure the distinctive name of Brace Meole originated. \u2014 At the Assizes of 1221, Audulf de Bracy appears as a Knight and as Surety for his neighbour, Hugh le Strange of Berrington. At these Assizes we also have had mention of Gilbert de Meles, of Roger Sergeant of Meola, and of Wdliam Provost of Meles.20 The last at least was an Officer of Cantilupe's, for William de Cantilupe, paying his proportion of an Aid in 1235, as Lord of the Honour of Montgomery, pays it by the hand of William, Provost of Mole.-1 A Feodary of 1240 duly records William de Cantilupe (he was son of the last William) as holding Meeles under Ralph de Mortimer, by one knight's fee.22 On August 27, 1254, King Henry III., being then at Bordeaux, grants Free-Warren to Robert de Cantilupe in all his demesnes at Brugel (Yorkshire) and Meules (Salop).23 Robert de Cantilupe, be it observed, was a Cadet of his House, and must have held what ever he had at Meole under William de Cantilupe (III.), who, at the time of the above Grant, had little more than a month to live. 16 Rot.

At the Forest Assizes of 1262 the name of John de Bracy of Mele appears on the list entitled Essonia mortis, a proof that such a person was then deceased.21 At the Assizes of August 1267, Wil liam de Horton was found to have disseized Audulf de Bracy of 6 acres in Moles. An Inquest held at Melesbracy, December 13, 1273, on the death of George, fourth and last Baron Cantilupe of Bergavenny, found him to have held half the Manor of Melesbracy under Roger de Mortimer for half a knight's fee. There was a fortified dwelling, called a tower, there, and other buildings, very poor, but extended at 2s. per annum, independently of the tower. The demesne-lands realized \u00a31. 9s. 4d. per annum. The Boses of Hanleg and Hay wode, though within the Manor, were also within the Forest. The rent of the Lord of Edgebold was 8s., and certain free-tenants within the Borough of Salop, viz. Hugh Colle, Roger le Paumer, Philip Pikenel, Alan fitz Gamel, and Peter Corde paid rents amounting to 5s. 4\\d.2h George de Cantilupe's interest in Meole went to his Sister, Mili sent, who at the time of his decease was wife of Eudo la Zouche. In Easter Term, 1280, I find the said Milisent, then a Widow, im pleading Audulf de Bracy for half a knight's fee in Melesbracy,26 that is, as I suppose, for the service due on Bracy's moiety of the Manor. A Feodary, taken February 10, 1305, on the death of Edmund de Mortimer, found William de la Souche to be holding a whole knight's-fee in Meoles of the deceased.27 Of Undertenants here, I may mention Walter de Chapel, who in 1261 sues William le Kent for disseizing him of a tenement in Mulesbracy. Of Newton and Nobold, members of Brace Meole, we have occasional mention. In 1249, William de Neutun was Juror on a Pulley Inquest; and in 1292, Thomas de Neuton sat on a Pulver batch Inquest.

The (annual) value (thereof) was and is 4s.\"34 It is consistently said, on another page of Domesday, that St. Mary had one virgate out of the hundred hides which composed the Hundred of Shrewsbury.34 St. Mary's virgate then was situated in, but quite independent of, Mortimer's Manor of Meole. In no Record subsequent to Domesday can I trace such a possession of St. Mary's. It is very seldom that the means of identifying an ecclesiastical estate are thus lost. It is quite supposable that the Church may have sur rendered or exchanged the land ; but, as a general rule, we find that the suburban estates which belonged to St. Mary's in the eleventh century, are in the Parish of St. Mary's at this day. In the present instance, we should expect to find an isolated part of St. Mary's Parish in or near Brace Meole. Nothing however of the kind exists. Necessarily, therefore, our account of this lost estate of St. Mary's is confined to the description given thereof in Domesday. jHmtfc JHtoU and Croto ffiltolt. The two places known in later times by these distinctive names formed a Domesday estate of the Bishop of Chester. \" Isdem Episcopus habet unum Manerium,\u2014 Melam. Non est neque suit hospitatus.1 Reddebat xx solidos tempore Regis Edwardi : modo (reddit) xvu solidos et iiii denarios.\"2 We know from Richard I.'s confirmation to Buildwas Abbey, that the \" land which was called Meola \" formed part of Bishop Clinton's endowment of that House. The Bishop had granted it \" with the greffegh and with the Burgesses, and with all things per taining to the said land.\" Hence Monk-Meole, as a possession of the Monks of Buildwas, acquired its distinctive name. We have seen that the impost called cherchombre, assessable by Manor, in fact, though within the Bo rough, was not occupied by any Burgesses or other Free Tenants. Neither does it seem to have been geldable. 34 Domesday, sos. 252, b, 2, & 252, a, 1. 1 Here we must read hospitatum, a word equivalent to colonatum.

Some other due, the nature of which I cannot determine, is probably implied by the term greffeg h. It does not appear whether the Burgesses who were made over to Buildwas by Bishop Clinton were actually resident on the land of Meole, as Richard I.'s Confirmation would imply, or were resident within the Walls of Shrewsbury, as Bishop Novant's Confirmation would suggest. Sixteen Burgesses of Shrewsbury, not connected with Meole, had belonged to the Domesday Bishop of Chester ; and if we suppose that some of these were occupying the land of Meole in the time of Bishop Clinton, his conveyance of both land and Burgesses will become very intelligible. In 1267, a Patent shows the Abbot of Buldewas suing Henry Charite for disseizing him of a tenement in Melam. In 1291, the Abbot of Buildwas had four carucates of land in Moele, worth \u00a32. 16s. per annum. His live stock there yielded an annual profit of \u00a35. 15s. 3d., and a Mill yielded \u00a31. Total, \u00a39. 11s. 3d.3 The Valor of 1535-6 describes the Buildwas Estate of Crow- Meole and Monk Meole as that of Cronyet and Monkemeyt. It then realized \u00a313. 6s. 8d. per annum.* Also, from a place called Monkehayles, which I think was part of this estate, a revenue of 13s. 4d. was arising. In 1536-7, the Ministers' Accounts give the same amount, as arising from Monke-meyle and Monke-eye, viz. Ferm of tenants-at will, 13s. 4d., and Ferm of lands and Tenements, \u00a313. 6s. 8d. i^jtlttm. This was another of the Bishop of Chester's Manors, but held under him by his own Collegiate Church of St. Chad, Shrewsbury. Domesday describes Shelton as follows. \u2014 \" The same Bishop holds Saltone, and the Church of St. Chad (holds it) of him. Here is a hide and half.

This land pays geld.\"1 Tins passage is of importance, as showing the ancient connection between the Bishops of Chester and the Church of St. Chad. Edward III, we are assured, asserted St. Chad's Church to have been founded by his Royal Progenitors, and affected to treat it as a Royal Free Chapel, or Peculiar ;2 but such a status was never actually established for St. Chad's, and, as to its foundation, that was probably the work of some Bishop of Lichfield, not long after the \u00e6ra of St. Ceadda himself. There is another passage of Domesday, bearing upon this question, which, as it has not been cited by the Historians of Shrewsbury when treating of this Foundation, I will notice here.\u2014 The Record is either speaking of Peter, Bishop of Chester, who died the year before Domesday was compiled, or else of a Bishop (Wulsius or Leofwine) who held the See of Chester (or rather Lichfield) in Edward the Confessor's reign, when it states as follows \u2014 \" The same Bishop had in the said City (Shrewsbury) sixteen Canons. They paid no geld (to the Crown), nor is it known how much rent they paid to the Bishop.\"3 These sixteen Canons, resident in Shrewsbury itself, were clearly, all or most of them, Canons of St. Chad's. There is nothing to show that their number or condition was altered at the time when Domesday was compiled ; and their being described at any time as the Bishop of Chester's Canons precludes all idea of St. Chad's being a Royal Foundation. In after-times the Collegiate body of St. Chad's consisted of a Dean and ten Canons; and we know from the Registers of Lichfield that the Diocesan Bishop was the Patron of every Stall in the Church. There is a circumstance showing to this day the connection which existed between the Bishops of Lichfield and St. Chad's College, and showing moreover how very an cient that connection was, for it would seem to have existed before our parochial boun daries were settled, and in some measure to have determined them. At the time of Domesday it is certain that the following scattered localities were possessions of St. Chad's College, viz. Little Rossal, Bicton, part of Onslow, Little Eaton, Broughton, and Yorton. All of these are in the modern parish of St. Chad, except the three last, and even those three have perhaps been hi the said parish at a period since Domesday. This proves only the antiquity of St. Chad's Church, viz. that it existed when the parochial boundaries of the district were first determined. But we also know that Shelton (or a great part thereof), Betton and Alkmere, Monk Meole and Crowmeole, and lastly Longner, \u2014 all belonged to the Bishop of Chester's Domesday Fief ; and these again, scattered as they were, are in the modern parish of St. Chad. Thus we are assured not merely of the antiquity of St. Chad's College, but of the antiquity of its connection with the See of Lichfield. This digression, which relates rather to St. Chad's Church than to its estate at Shelton, should now give way to some account of the latter Manor. Unfortunately no materials for such an account are likely to be in existence. The ancient muniments of St. Chad's College are utterly lost. No portion of them is incorporated in the Diocesan Registers.4 Other Records are little likely to treat of an estate held under an Episcopal See, by a Collegiate body.

A series of unknown changes can only be argued from their results : viz. that, at the Dissolution of St. Chad's College, the Bishops of Lichfield had lost every vestige of their title to the Seigneury of Shelton, and the Chapter of St. Chad's, neither retained an acre of land there, nor received more than one small rent therefrom. The said Dissolution took place, I should observe, under the Act of 1 Edward VI. (1547). One of the ejected Canons (William Mar shall) had the title of Prebendary of Shelton, apparently because part of his standing income of 5s. 6d. arose from a messuage in Shelton. He had also a portion of the corn and hay-tithes of Shel ton, but the bulk of the said tithes was shared between four other Prebendaries.5 Of Undertenants in Shelton I have a few early notices, but quite inconclusive as to the mode of their tenure. In the Pipe-Roll of 1176 the Chattels of Robert de Schelton, value 12^., and of Tosti de Chelton, value 7s., are accounted for by the Sheriff, those persons having perished by the Ordeal of Water, under the Statutes of Northampton.6 At the Assizes of 1221, Stephen de Shelfton, as heir of his father, Peter de Shelfton, sued Adam de Kemton for a virgate in Shelfton, but the Defendant took a technical objection to the process (mort d'ancestre), showing that, since Peter's death, Alan, eldest son of Peter had been seized of the premises. This the Plaintiff acknow ledged ; but here the Bailiffs of Shrewsbury interposed, stating that they had a Charter of King John enacting that no assize of mort d'ancestre, concerning any tenement within the Borough or Hundred of Shrewsbury, could be taken or held.

The Church of St. Milburg is registered in Domesday as holding a Manor in Sciropesberie Hundred. \u2014 \" The said Church held (in Saxon times) and (still) holds Sudtone. Here is one hide. What with Freemen and Villains, there are eight men here, with four ox teams. The old value of the Manor was 1 2s. (per annum) . Now it is worth 16s.\"1 Sutton was obviously so called as standing nearly south of Shrews bury. The first transaction after Domesday in which Sutton is mentioned, rather concerns the Monks of Shrewsbury than the Monks of St. Milburg, unless indeed it was an aggression on the rights ofthe latter. Between the years 1141 and 1155, \"Ivo Pan tulf gave to Shrewsbury Abbey the site of a Mill, under Sudton, on either side of the water;\" aud this grant was confirmed by Henry II. in 1155.2 It is probable that all the Baronial Houses of Shropshire, as well as all the Religious Houses, either possessed, or made it an object to acquire, some tenement in the County-town. Thus the Barons of Wem will have had an estate in the fields of the Borough, lying south of Coleham, and extending up to or beyond the Meole Brook in the direction of Sutton. Hence Ivo Pantulf's grant to Shrews- bury Abbey.3 Hugh Pantulf renewed his Father's grant in a distinct Charter, o Assizes, 56 Hen.

In this Charter, which must have passed early in the 13th century, Hugh Pantulf makes mention of his wife Chris tiana. The Deed is witnessed by Robert Corbet and his son Robert, by Ivo Pantulf (probably a son of Hugh) , by Master Stephen de Francheton and Stephen de Hocley.4 On August 3, 1234, Henry, Abbot of Shrewsbury, and Humbert, Prior of Wenlock, came to an agreement about several matters of dispute, but chiefly about the Mill under Sutton, aud five acres in the field of Coleham, of which the Abbey of Shrewsbury was in posses sion. The Wenlock Monks complained of the site and disposition of the mill-stank, and the waste caused by inundation. The Shrewsbury Monks alleged similar wastes against the Wenlock Monks, in the direction of Chongede-Mulne. Again, the Wenlock Monks said that the Shrewsbury Monks made waste in the bosc of Mount Gil bert, which, was common to both Monasteries. It was agreed that the site of the said Mill, the said five acres of land, the attachia ments of the mill-stank, the trench towards Chongede-Mulne, the island lying between the said trench and the bank of Meole-brook, together with the ancient watercourse, should remain to Shrews bury Abbey for ever; but the said Abbey was to make good all damages occasioned by the water, banks, or stank, to the lands of the Priory. Also the Prior gave up to the Abbot his (the Prior's) share of the Bosc of Mount Gilbert, concerning which a Cyrograph or agreement had previously been made between the two Houses in the Curia of King Richard I. In return for all this, the Abbot conceded to the Prior ten acres of the Abbot's demesne in the field of the Foriete (the Abbey Foregate), viz. such ten acres as were nearest to the Prior's demesne of Suttune. Witnesses, Sir John le Strange and \" Robert de Haye, then Sheriff of Salop and Stafford.\"5 I much doubt whether the ten acres above-named were ever con veyed to Wenlock Priory. A second agreement, dated May 10, 1240, would imply that the Prior accepted another equivalent. By this Deed the Prior of Wenlock concedes to Shrewsbury Abbey the Mill of Sutton with the Island in which it was situated, and the trenches there made, at an annual rent of 8 merks.

The fact is, I sup pose, that Suttou was for all ordinary purposes extra-hundredal and extra-parochial; but its distance from Wenlock, or its situation within the Liberties of Shrewsbury, seems to have made it an ex ception to the ordinary rule ; for I have found no indication of the Tenants of Sutton having owed any suit to Wenlock Hundred- Court. The Taxation of 1291 values the Prior of Wenlock's Temporali ties in Sutton at \u00a32. 10s. 8d. per annum, viz. : from 3 carucates of land, \u00a31.; from two acres of meadow, 4s. ; from assized rents aud a Mill, \u00a31.; and from tallage, 6s. 8d.9 A Valuation of the possessions of Wenlock Priory, taken in 1379, estimates the receipts from Sutton at \u00a31. 11s., viz. a messuage, value \u2014 nothing, besides the expenses thereof; 2 carucates of land, yielding 10s. ; an acre of meadow, Is. ; a water-mill, 13s. 4d. ; as sized rents of free tenants, 6s. 8d.9 The Valor of 1535-6 gives the Prior of Wenlock as in receipt of \u00a311. 7s. for the rents and ferms of Sutton.10 In the Ministers' Accounts of 1541-2 the Ferm of the Manor of Sutton-juxta-Salop is put at \u00a37. 13s. 4d., and the ferm of a water-mill there at \u00a32.n THE CHURCH.

The tithes of hay and of two Mills were \u00a31. 3s. 4d. ; the small tithes, oblata, and glebe-land were worth 13s. 4d. per annum ; and all these items, though they had formed a part of the Church-Taxation, were not computable in assessing the Ninth.1'' In 1379 the Church of Sutton juxta-Salop, of \u00a34. annual value, is stated to belong to the Prior of Wenlock's presentation.16 In 1534-5, \u00a33. of the tithes of Sutton were, as we have seen, annexed to the Vicarage of Wenlock.17 The Chapel itself was probably disused, or served only by some Chaplain, removable at the will of the Prior of Wenlock.

St Julian's jtator* Under the Title, Quod tenet Sanda Juliana, Domesday says that \" the Church of St. Juliana holds half a hide, and has thereon one ox-team ; and two Burgesses, labouring on this land, pay 3s. rent (to the Church). The Manor was worth 8s. (in Saxon times), and still maintained the same (annual) value.\"1 Another page of the Record shows us that St. Julian's half-hide was part of the hundred hides which constituted the Liberties of Shrewsbury. St. Julian's Church was a Royal Free Chapel, and its history is inextricably involved with that of St. Michael's Church. For an account of all that is known of both Foundations I refer elsewhere.3 That account does not give us a single instance of the Incumbents of St. Julian's having been so concerned with any lands in or near Shrewsbury, as to indicate that they retained their Domesday estate. Tithes they had, and a Parish ; but they retained no Fee, or territory. It is obvious, however, that the Domesday estate of St. Julian's will have been a part of its present Parish. Now that Parish involves part of the Castle Foregate, the whole of the Wyle Cop, and nearly the whole of Coleham, \u2014 all within the Town. In the Country it extends to i Domesday, ios.253,a,l,asu\\2o2,s..l. | 2 Hist, of Shrewsbury, II. pp. 415-430."], [840, "368 st. alkmund's manor. part of Pulley on the South, to parts of Shelton and Oxon on the- West, and to Coton Hill, Green-fields, and the Old Heath, on the North. It is probable that the Domesday half-hide of St. Julian's lay in the last direction; but I forbear to attempt any further account of an estate which I cannot with any certainty identify. $t JHamir- Under the Title, Quod tenet Sandus Almundus, Domesday says as follows. \u2014 \" The Church of St. Almund holds in Sciropesberie xxi Burgesses besides the twelve Houses of its Canons. These Bur gesses pay rents of 8s. 8d. The same Church has two of the hun dred hides which are computed in the geld of the City. These two hides are held by two Canons, who have thereon one ox-team and a half, and (who have) four Villains possessing two ox-teams and a half. The (annual) value (of this estate) is 15s.\"1 The Burgages, or Town property, of St. Alkmund's, lay un doubtedly in the Castle Ward and Castle Foregate. The suburban estate of two hides probably comprehended a part of Coton Hill, but was mainly identical with Hencot. It is of Hencot alone that I propose to speak, because its history as a distinct Manor or estate is not obliterated. Like all the possessions of St. Alkmund's, Hencot passed in the Reign of Stephen to Lilleshall Abbey. Of the foundation of Lilleshall, on the basis of St. Alkmund's, I shall speak fully elsewhere. My present subject is a matter of detail. Hencot, though within the Liberties of Shrewsbury, was not exempt from the Jurisdiction of the Forest of the Wrekin. We have an early proof of this in the Forest-Roll of 1180, where \"the Miller of Hennecote \" stands assessed Is. for an imbladement of 2 acres of oats. The Lilleshall Chartulary preserves some of those early Fines which are invaluable as being lost from the proper reposi tory. On Wednesday, February 8, 1189, Ralph de Ardern, Maurice de Berkele, William Fitz Alan, Thomas Noel, Hugh Pantulf, Master Robert of Salop, Robert de Haselee, and Nicholas Britton, were sitting as Justiciars of King Henry II. at Salop.

If any waste should be made, each party was bound to repair it. The boundaries of the Bosc were to be from Scotebrug, through Sumergeld, to Holeford ; thence, past certain oak-trees, previously marked, to Deorefald, and so to Cho liers-wai, and back to Scotbrugg. And the Bosc contained within these limits was the Bosc concerning which there was dispute (clamium) between the Abbot and Stephen.\"2 King John's general Charter of Confirmation to Lilleshall Abbey bears date at the Castle of Roche-Andely, August 31, 1199. Like other Royal Charters, which it is needless to enumerate here, it makes mention of Hennecote as one of the estates of St. Alkmund's Church, which now belonged to the Abbey.3 In Michalmas Term 1200, a Suit was pending at Westminster, as to a right of common between Shrewsbury and Hewecot, claimed by the Burgesses of Shrewsbury. The Defendant is not named, but was probably the Abbot of Lilleshall. It was ordered that twelve Knights should be empanelled to make recognition of the case, be fore the Justices next in Eyre.4 At the Assizes of 1203, the Jurors of Pimhill Hundred reported a case where William, Provost of Hencot, had seized and beaten some Officer in discharge of his duty, and further detained the said Officer, till he was liberated by the Sheriff's Clerk. The Provost appeared, and denied the imputed felony ; but his further defence is illegible.5 On Wednesday, November 5, 1208, Ralph de Ardern, William de Albeny, Robert de Berkelay, Humphrey Archdeacon of Sarum, John de Gestling, Henry de Pont-Audemer, Richard de Mucegros, and William fitz Richard, Justices of King John, were sitting at Shrewsbury. By a Fine then levied, Roger fitz William (Plaintiff in a Suit of mort d'ancestre) quit-claimed to Ralph, Abbot of Lilies hull (Tenant), a virgate in Ennecote. He also quit-claimed a bovate in the same vill, which he had held under the Abbot.
