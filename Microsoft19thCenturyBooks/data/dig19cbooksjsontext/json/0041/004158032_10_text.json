Bowen probably made but a short stay in Ireland \u2014 Norris was in London in 1700, and Estcourt and Keen not long afterwards. Wilks' first inclination to the theatre, proceeded from the praises of Richards, then an actor on the Dublin stage \u2014 Richards is said to have been a good performer both in Tragedy and Comedy, but not happy in his personal appearance. Wilks used to hear Richards repeat his parts and read the intervening speeches, which he did with so much propriety that the praises of Richards began to fire his mind for the Drama, and he was easily prevailed on to act the Colonel in the Spanish Friar privately at Mr. Ashbury's \u2014 after he had acted T *2"], [286, "276 IRISH STAGE.

When Wilks settled finally at D.

On Dec. 26 1701 the galleries of the theatre, being uncommonly crowded, gave way \u2014 and tho' no lives were lost, yet several persons were hurt in endeavouring to get out\u2014 as this was the first night of Shadwell's Libertine, it gave occasion to foolish people to say that it was a judgment on the specta tors for going to so improper a play \u2014 nay some carried their extravagance so far as to assert that"], [289, "279 IRISH STAGE. there was a Dancer extraordinary among the Devils, with a cloven foot, and whom nobody knew \u2014 this circumstance occasioned the Libertine to be laid aside for 20 years.

To Sheridan's credit it should be observed, that through the whole connexion between him and Gar rick, such was his strict adherence to his engage ments, and open unreserved behaviour, that they parted good friends, Garrick acknowledging that he was the man of honour and the Gentleman. On May 3d Garrick left Ireland, and in company with Victor returned to London, highly pleased with a trip, which surpassed his expectations, both in fame and profit. While he was in Dublin, he generously bore tes timony to Barry's growing merit, in several letters written to his friends in London, assuring them that he was the best lover he had ever seen. About a fortnight after Garrick's departure, She ridan closed his first season, the most honourable and brilliant that had ever marked the Irish dramatic annals. (Davies \u2014 Victor and Hitchcock.) Mrs. Bellamy's Apology for her Life, as has been before observed, is full of mistakes \u2014 one instance of which is, that she speaks of acting with Barry at Dublin the following season as well as the last, tho' it is certain that Barry was then at D.

Not content with this, when Garrick asked Miss Bellamy to act Jane Shore for his benefit, she abso lutely refused, saying that if she was too young to act Constance, she was of course too young to act Jane Shore \u2014 Garrick, finding his entreaties ineffec tual, prevailed on Mrs. Butler to use her influence with Miss Bellamy \u2014 to whom also he wrote a ridi culous note \u2014 this he directed \" To my soul's Idol, \" the beautified Ophelia,\" and delivered it to his servant with orders to carry it to Miss Bellamy\u2014 the z 2"], [350, "340 1745-1746. fellow, having something else to do, gave the note to a porter, and he, not knowing where Ophelia lived, carried it to his master, who happened to be a news-man \u2014 and next day it appeared in the pub lic prints, which was a second mortification to Gar rick. When he called on Mrs. Butler to take his leave, she put into his hands a sealed packet, saying it con tained her sentiments \u2014 and enjoining him not to open it, till he had passed the Hill of Howth \u2014 Gar rick took the packet with a significant air, concluding that it contained not only a valuable present, but also such a declaration of tender sentiments, as her virtue would not suffer her to make known to him, while he continued in that kingdom \u2014 Garrick was so disappointed when he opened the packet, and found that it contained nothing, but Westley's Hymns and Swift's discourse on the Trinity, that he threw them both into the sea.

Before the riot began, the Fair Penitent had been appointed to be acted for the annual benefit of the Hospital of Incurables\u2014 the governors, who were all persons of consequence, sent Sheridan word, that if he would perform Horatio, they would take upon them to defend him that night, resting assured that no set of men would oppose a Charity play \u2014 espe cially as all the ladies of quality were to honour it with their presence \u2014 the bills were accordingly posted up \u2014 the governors in their white wands went early to the theatre \u2014 the boxes and pit would have been filled with ladies, if about 30 gentlemen had not taken early possession of the middle of 2 or 3 benches near the orchestra \u2014 there were about an hundred ladies on the stage\u2014 and when the curtain drew up, nothing could equal the brilliant appearance of the house \u2014 at the entrance of Sheridan (who had the honour of being ushered in by the governors) these 30 gentlemen, all armed, rose up in the pit, and ordered him off \u2014 and they were joined by some few"], [361, "1746-1747. 351 placed in both the galleries \u2014 Sheridan withdrew, and then violent disputes, and something very like challenges passed between several of the governors and the gentlemen in the pit, as all the persons on both sides were publickly known \u2014 among the go vernors was a Student of the College in his Bache lor's gown, who behaved with some warmth against those that opposed the play \u2014 a gentleman in the pit called him scoundrel, and (as he declared) said \" they were all a pack of scoundrels\" \u2014 away flew the Student to the College (the distance half a mile) and returned in about 20 minutes, with as many Gownsmen armed for the combat \u2014 but as the affront was not given till the house was half empty, the rioters had most fortunately all left the pit\u2014the Gownsmen made search after them at most of the taverns that night \u2014 but not finding them, they re turned to the College, and called a council of war, which lasted till the morning \u2014 as soon as the gates were opened, they all sallied out armed \u2014 and dispersed in large parties to beset the different lodgings of the rioters \u2014 these detachments struck terror into all concerned in the opposition, and seemed to threaten such mischief, that several shops were kept shut in the principal streets \u2014 but the chief aim of the Students was to secure the person who had insulted their whole body, and as that gentleman was just come from the country, he was not easily found \u2014 during this single pursuit, several of the leaders of the opposition fled with fear and trembling to the Court of Chancery, where the Lord Chancellor was sitting, and begged his protection against the Gowns men \u2014 about 11 o'Clock this principal offender was"], [362, "352 1746-1747. found and carried to the College -the greater part then proceeded in search of another delinquent, who was a young Officer and lived with his father, a gen tleman of large fortune \u2014 the house was defended by a good number of servants \u2014 after several difficult as well as dangerous attacks, they made a breach\u2014en tered, and brought out their prisoner \u2014 they put him into a hackney coach, and guarded him in triumph to the College \u2014 great care was taken by 2 or 3 of the Principals (who secretly aided the enterprize) that no extravagant punishment should be inflicted on the prisoners \u2014 the first and greatest offender was com pelled to kneel down on his bare knees, in all the courts of the College, and to repeat a form they had prepared for him \u2014 the other was excused kneeling, and only read his submission, and asked pardon of the College\u2014 and thus the affair ended as far as the young men of the University were concerned, who only interfered with regard to themselves, and not in the manager's quarrel\u2014 and not only the whole city, but the Provost himself approved of their conduct. The Lords Justices now thought proper to order the Master of the Revels to shut up the theatre by his authority, which was accordingly done\u2014 this was a prudent step, because the theatre was made the seat of war.

Tho' Sheridan had left Ireland with due resent ment for the infamous treatment he had met with, yet as all passions subside in time, he was willing to return to his 'native country, when he found a change had taken place in the public opinion. Victor was glad to resume his former station of treasurer and deputy manager \u2014 and Sowdon seems to have continued as an actor as heretofore. On Sheridan's return to Dublin, he employed a person to paint three or four sets of scenes, which were much wanted \u2014 and made several expensive additions to the wardrobe, which two years' use had not a little impaired.

The 1st act of the Busy Body was performed with the utmost quietness, but in the second, a few young men in the pit called out Sheridan ! Apology ! which was seconded by the same number in both the galleries \u2014 Dexter, who acted Sir George Airy, and was remarkable for his modest behaviour, was on the stage alone\u2014 he bowed and retired, and went to consult Victor \u2014 Victor desired him to go on again, and say that Sheridan was confined to his room with a very bad cold, and that he did not doubt but that Sheridan when he was recovered would give them all the satisfaction they desired \u2014 this however would not content them \u2014 they had collected spirits to make a beginning, and had gradually excited a con- siderable uproar \u2014 they insisted on Dexter's going to Sheridan, whose apartments they knew were con- tiguous to the theatre, and on his bringing a positive promise from him \u2014 Victor and Dexter accordingly went to Sheridan, who was of course much hurt at this unreasonable demand, however he was prevailed on to comply\u2014 and Dexter assured the audience that when Sheridan was recovered, he would make an Apology on the Stage, and that public notice of it should be given in the bills \u2014 this was received with universal applause. Victor recommended Sheridan, if the audience"], [417, "1756-1757. 407 would have an apology, to make them pay for it, and to give notice of it in the bills before some Comedy that would not otherwise pay charges \u2014 he would naturally be supposed to be too much affected, on that solemn occasion, to perform any character on the same night\u2014 to this Sheridan assented \u2014 and Oct. 25th was fixed on for him to undergo this severe and most unmerited mortification. (Victor and Hitchcock.) Soon after the doors were opened, every part of the house was crowded to behold the unmanly tri umph of despotism over reason and justice \u2014 such a spectacle perhaps was never presented to the public before, nor since \u2014 a manager, who deserved a statue to perpetuate the memory of the good he had done, was obliged to appear like a criminal, before that tribunal which he had so often furnished with the most rational entertainment \u2014 but he was equal to this arduous task \u2014 when the curtain drew up, he advanced to the centre of the stage, with a paper in his hand, fearing in that unavoidable confusion to trust entirely to his memory \u2014 it was the opinion of some of the best judges, that no man within their observation ever appeared before the public with so much address, or spoke to the passions with such propriety \u2014 tears gushed from the eyes of several of his male auditors \u2014 his apology was followed by the loudest acclamation \u2014 and after he had begun to retire, he advanced again, and with faltering and broken accents spoke as follows, \" Your goodness \" to me at this important crisis has so deeply affected \" me, that I want powers to express myself\u2014 my \" future actions shall show my gratitude\" thus"], [418, "408 17 56-1 757. ended this disgraceful affair\u2014 every liberal mind must be shocked at the degeneracy of the times, which could reduce a man of Sheridan's abilities and sentiments, to the humiliating situation of apolo gizing to the destroyers of his property, for having ruined his fortune and having demolished the labours of so many years. Some few nights after, Sheridan appeared in Hamlet to a crowded audience, and was received with the utmost applause \u2014 he afterwards drew seve ral good houses to his Richard, Tamerlane, Dumont, Horatio, &c. Sheridan having in vain endeavoured to secure Barry, engaged Lee, an actor of reputation, whom he had never seen perform, at \u00a3400 for the season \u2014 tho' he did not answer the manager's expectations, yet he supported a line of first characters with tolerable reputation \u2014 his 1st app. was in Lear, he then performed Hastings\u2014 Iago \u2014 Hotspur, &c. Sheridan had engaged two celebrated Dancers, to whom he was to pay \u00a31000 \u2014 this proved a bad bar gain to him \u2014 and indeed his great error was in en gaging performers at larger salaries than the theatre could afford. Several new performers of merit were brought out \u2014 among whom were Miss G. and Miss M. Phi lips, Mr. Glover and Miss Wells \u2014 Mrs. Gregory had returned to C. G. Fair Penitent.

At the beginning of the season, among other regu lations adopted by the manager, he determined if possible, to put an end to the numberless complaints of the outrages committed in the upper gallery, by converting it into boxes, and raising the price to 2s. and 6d. \u2014 this answered the end proposed, but proved highly detrimental to his interest \u2014 for as most things are governed by fashion, so novelty and whim drew the ladies, and consequently the gentle men, in such numbers to the upper boxes, that those below were in great measure deserted, and the pit thinned of course \u2014 however by this regulation, peace and order were suddenly restored. (Hitchcock.) As soon as Sheridan had resolved to resume the management of the theatre in 1756, before he left London he waited on Barry with a gentleman who was a common friend to both, and made him over tures of all kinds to engage him for the ensuing sea son \u2014 telling him at the same time that he should not continue on the stage above a year or two at most\u2014 and that it should be Barry's own fault, if his station was not as eligible as he could wish \u2014 Sheri dan proposed to engage him at a certain salary, or to admit him to a share of the profits \u2014 and after-"], [422, "1756-17^7. 412 wards let the theatre to him \u2014 before they parted, Barry seemed inclined to come into some one of these proposals \u2014 he promised to consider the point, and in a few days to call on Sheridan, and let him know the result of his thoughts \u2014 but he neither called, nor ever afterwards spoke to him on the sub ject. About March 1757 the report began to be credited that Barry's agents had actually agreed with the Pro prietors of the Music Hall in Crow Sti-eet for their property there, in order to build a new theatre \u2014 Sheridan and Victor, after frequent consultations on the subject, concluded that Victor should go to Lon don, and endeavour to dissuade Barry from the rash enterprize of building a new house, since he might have the united theatres of Aungier Street and Smock Alley on advantageous terms, if he had any objection to a partnership with Sheridan. When Victor called on Barry, Barry soon con vinced him that this offer came too late \u2014 it must however be remembered that Sheridan had in person made similar proposals to Barry before he left Lon don \u2014 this Sheridan afterwards stated in his \" Appeal \" to the Public,\" and as he was never contradicted, Victor argues with good reason, that what Sheridan said must be admitted as fact \u2014 and that the theatre in Crow Street was erected, after mature deliberation and after Barry had preferred his own scheme to Sheridan's proposals. Victor's business with Barry being soon over, he set about executing the other part of his commission, which was to engage Mrs. Gregory, and Mrs. Bland,"], [423, "1756-1757. 413 now become Mrs. Hamilton \u2014 after a negotiation of 7 weeks he engaged Mrs. Gregory at \u00a3500 and Mrs. Hamilton at \u00a3400. As Mrs. Gregory and Victor had a mutual confi dence in each other, their agreement was only made in the shape of a memorandum \u2014 which they both signed \u2014 but as Mrs. Hamilton had a husband who was a stranger to Victor, he thought it prudent to call in an attorney, and have an article drawn in form with a penalty of \u00a3500. (Victor.) Rich, finding Mrs. Hamilton was engaged, insisted on her breaking her article, and promised to indem nify her \u2014 a law suit ensued, and after a delay of three years, Rich was obliged to pay the \u00a3500 with costs. \u2014 ( Victor and Hitchcock.) See Victor's 103d letter. Barry, Macklin and Victor left London about the same time, and landed in Ireland from the same packet boat the latter end of June \u2014 and soon after wards the Music Hall in Crow Street, and some ad jacent buildings were levelled to the ground, to lay the foundation of the new theatre. ( Victor.) Barry remained in Dublin till Sep , when having obtained a sufficient number of subscribers to the new theatre, and arranged every matter relative to his great design, he returned to London \u2014 Hitchcock says that Macklin accompanied him \u2014 but Cooke tells us that Macklin stayed in Dublin to superintend the concerns of the theatre, in which, it seems, M acklin was originally intended to have been a part ner with Barry.

Previously to the indentures being drawn up be tween Barry and Macklin as joint managers of the new theatre, Macklin gave in a list of parts, and a plan of managerial arrangement, as it respected his own power, which roused Barry to pause on such an agree ment \u2014 besides Shylock and the comic parts which he usually acted, he was for articling to play Hamlet, Richard, Macbeth, &c. occasionally \u2014 seeing Barry rather surprised at this last proposal, \u2014 \" Not, my \" dear Spranger (says he) that I want to take your \" parts from you, but by way of giving the town \" variety \u2014 You shall play Macbeth one night and I \" another, and so on with the rest of the tragic cha \" racters \u2014 thus we will throw lights upon one \" another's performance, and give a bone to the \" critics.\" Barry remonstrated in vain against this absurd project, by telling him, in his soft conciliating man ner, that the very reverse of what he had predicted must happen, as, in the proportion of one of them being a favourite in any of those characters, the"], [425, "1756-1757. 415 other must feel the degradation, and of course the receipts of the house must suffer \u2014 that he, Macklin, had a large circle of comic parts to range in, all at his own disposal, which he could vary as he liked \u2014 which would be sufficient both for fame and fortune, and not risk the taking up of new business at his time of life. Macklin caught fire at the word risk and, perhaps, time of life, and told him, it was more a certainty than he and Garrick were aware of \u2014that he had long thought of these parts, that he had long studied them \u2014 and tho' he had never before then had a power to demand them, he would not now lose the opportunity ! \u2014 \" and by Heaven, Sir, let me tell you, \" I think I shall be able to show the town something \" they never saw before.\" To such reasoning nothing could be applied, but by breaking off the engagement, which accordingly was dissolved \u2014 ( Cooke) \u2014 and Barry turned his thoughts towards Woodward \u2014 see D.

(Hitchcock.) Sheridan's friends argued that Dublin was not suf ficient to support two theatres \u2014 that at that time it could barely maintain one \u2014 and that if a second should be set up, the inevitable consequence must be, that they would ruin one another \u2014 they reminded the public of the lamentable condition in which Sheridan found the stage when first he undertook to reform it \u2014 and of the indefatigable pains and un limited expense he had been at to adorn and improve it \u2014 they affirmed with truth, that by his learning and abilities, which his very enemies could not dispute, he had, after a struggle of many years, shown the people of Ireland, what they had never seen before, in their own country, a tvell regulated theatre \u2014 and"], [432, "422 1757-1758. that consequently he was entitled to the support of the public. Barry's advocates replied, that it was far from evi dent that Dublin could not support two theatres \u2014 that the public would be gainers by a contest \u2014 and that Barry had engaged so far in his design, that it would be absolute ruin to him to relinquish it\u2014 they added that when Barry was in Ireland in 1754-1755, his performance gave such general satisfaction, that he was encouraged by many of the nobility and gentry as well as citizens of the greatest eminence, to build a theatre and settle in Dublin \u2014 that he had accepted the invitation with gratitude \u2014 that he had treated immediately for several pieces of ground, but could not find any to his purpose 'till about May 1757 \u2014 &c. (State of the Stage in Ireland printed in 1758.) Many and various were the schemes for preventing the new theatre, and some were carried into execu tion \u2014 the Case of the Proprietors of the united theatres of Aungier Street and Smock Alley was printed and delivered to all the Members of Par liament, setting forth the great expense they had been at in building and completing two magni ficent theatres, and praying that the number of theatres might be limited by Parliament as in London \u2014 and that as two were thought sufficient for that great city, that one might be fixed for Dublin. As many of the leading Members of Parliament were subscribers to the new building in Crow Street, and many more wellwishers to it, the case of the"], [433, "1757-1758. 423 proprietors of the united theatres, remained neglected and unpitied. The manager began very soon to see the vanity of these attempts, and at last to turn his thoughts properly to an opposition \u2014 he called the company together in March just before the benefits, and said it was high time to see who would stand by him\u2014 he made his first application to Mrs. Fitzhenry \u2014 he agreed to give her \u00a3500 a year, but seeing her de mur, he offered her \u00a3600 \u2014 well knowing, that with out her, it would be unsafe for him to article with a large body of people, many of whom had considerable salaries, though they were only useful \u2014 Mrs. Fitz henry gave such a reply to the manager's proposal, as made him conclude, that she meant to keep her self open to offers from the other side \u2014 and there fore he declared too rashly against entering into articles with any one \u2014 upon which Dexter and King went off, and signed with Barry's attorney directly.

Victor opened S. A. Oct. 22d, as he was obliged to do, as Manager of the King's company of Come dians. Soon after his return, he engaged Brown (late of the Bath Company) who made his 1st app. in the Copper Captain \u2014 and tho' he met with the usual fate of a stranger, that of bringing very few people to see his first performance, yet those who were present, gave him universal applause\u2014 his first night brought no more than \u00a312 \u2014 his second \u00a328 \u2014 and his third more \u2014 till at last (as Estifania was well supported by Mrs. Kennedy) it became the only es-"], [435, "s. a. 1758-1759. 425 tablished Comedy of the season \u2014 Woodward, was thought inferiour to him in that character, and with all the advantages, which his theatre and company possessed, he could not keep Rule a Wife and have a Wife on a par against Brown. ( Victor.) Brown had an unfortunate propensity to Tragedy \u2014 he attempted Richard at D. L. Feb. 23, 1753 and was barely permitted to finish the part \u2014 and because Victor would not allow him to play capital tragic parts, he was much displeased. (Victor and Wil kinson. Brown was well received in Benedick \u2014 Don John and all parts of that cast \u2014 his principal fault was his making his pauses too long \u2014 probably owing to his having seen the effect produced by Garrick from his pointed pauses \u2014 but then Garrick had a judgment to direct him to a second, as to the proper time to con tinue them \u2014 in the Wonder, in the grand scene be tween Felix and Violante, the pause was near four minutes * but then Garrick's looks and actions sup plied the want of wordst \u2014 pauses in general are * This seems an exaggeration \u2014 Victor would probably have been more correct, if he had said four seconds. f And how did Garrick speak the Soliloquy last night ? \u2014 Oh, against all rule, my lord, most ungrammatically ! betwixt the Sub tantive and the Adjective, which should agree together in number, case and gender, he made a breach thus \u2014 stopping as if the point wanted settling \u2014 and betwixt the nominative case, which, your lordship knows, should govern the verb, he suspended his voice in the Epilogue a dozen times, three seconds and three fifths by a stop-watch, my lord, each time admirable grammarian \u2014 but in"], [436, "426 s. a. 1758-1759. dangerous intervals ; which should only be ventured on, when the circumstance and situation of the cha racter demand them \u2014 and then they should not be continued too long. Towards the close of November, Victor made several attempts to engage Mrs. Fitzhenry, who in that precarious situation of the theatre demanded security to be given her for the payment of her salary \u2014 Victor was so anxious in the business that he pro cured the security she wanted \u2014 but before the bond was executed, Sheridan wrote a letter in which he expressed his resentment at Mrs. Fitzhenry's making such an unprecedented demand \u2014 and his doubts of his being able to be himself in Dublin that season as he had intended Mrs. Fitzhenry immediately en gaged with Barry and Woodward. This Victor thinks was the fatal blow to S. A. \u2014 and that if Mrs. Fitzhenry had been engaged and Sheridan had returned, with the assistance of Digges and Mrs. Ward in the same Tragedy (for instance the Distressed Mother) they would have been a force too strong for Barry \u2014 more especially, as after all the pains he had taken to procure a good actress in Tragedy, he had only been able to get Mrs. Dan cer, who at this time was inferiour to what she after wards proved \u2014 nor was Woodward much better sup ported in Comedy. suspending hi3 voice \u2014 was the sense suspended likewise ? did no expression of attitude or countenance fill up the chasm ? \u2014 Was the eye silent ? \u2014 did you narrowly look ? 1 looked only at the stop-watch my lord\u2014\u2014 Excellent observer !

A. to be frightened, and Douglas was acted 9 times to the best audiences they had that season \u2014 which was no small triumph on their side \u2014 more especially as the play never ap peared at the new theatre agreeably to promise \u2014 but this was only a temporary relief, for the ship which was bringing T. Cibber, Maddox, &c. to Ireland was lost, and all the passengers drowned \u2014 the loss of Maddox was severe, as he was not only to have been the Harlequin, but had the Music with the business and plot of the Pantomime in his custody \u2014 the Car penter from Sadler's Wells, with the scenes, machin ery, &c, arrived safe in another ship \u2014 from him Victor collected the plot and business of the scenes as well as he could \u2014 he got a new Harlequin, adapt ed Music to the piece, and in 3 weeks produced the Pantomime, which was received with great ap plause. Victor had only one hope remaining \u2014 the mana gers at D. L. had given Miss Macklin leave to come to S.

When the benefit plays began to be advertised (as many of the company had great interest in the City, which was well known) the friends of the new ma nagers thought of a very happy expedient to defend them against the injury they must have unavoidably sustained \u2014 and that was to apply to some leading Ladies of Quality to fix on their nights, bespeak their plays and make an interest for all parts of the house, particularly by Pit and Gallery tickets among their tradesmen, as for a distinct benefit \u2014 this was done \u2014 by which means it was common to find some woman of Quality making an interest for her play at Crow Street, with the same zeal that the Player at S. A. was exerting himself to support his wife and children \u2014 it was customary on these occasions for the great Lady to go early into the Box-room to re ceive her company \u2014 a friend of Victor was present one evening, when a Lady, who had sent out tickets for the pit and gallery with threatenings to her trades men, if they did not dispose of them, was ready to faint at finding a thin pit and thin galleries \u2014 after smelling bottles had been applied, she cryed out \" she was ruined and undone ! she should never be \" able to look dear Mr. Barry in the face any more, \" after such a shocking disappointment\" \u2014 the box-"], [439, "s. a. 1758-1759. 429 keeper endeavoured to console her by saying \" I beg \" your Ladyship will not be disheartened \u2014 indeed \" your Ladyship's pit will mend, and your Lady \" ship's galleries too will certainly mend before the \" play begins\" \u2014 the Lady however remained incon solable, but protested she would be revenged by pay ing off\u2014 no \u2014 by turning off all her saucy tradesmen the next morning. The theatres in London at this time had only a lobby before the boxes \u2014 those at Dublin had a com modious box-room (particularly Aungier Street) where the company assembled after the play was over, and conversed till their carriages were called. But in spite of this man\u0153uvring at C. S. the bene fits at S. A. were in general good \u2014 as from the very ill success of the theatre, it was impossible for Vic tor to pay the salaries regularly, he took on these occasions but \u00a316 in cash from each performer to pay contingencies, and allowed \u00a324 for arrears, which together made \u00a340, the usual charge for a benefit \u2014 at the beginning of March, Victor renewed his correspondence with Macklin, and after the ex change of 2 or 3 letters, was informed by him, that he had determined not to come to Ireland on account of his daughter's ill health, which made it dangerous for her to undertake such a journey and voyage. This last disappointment compelled Victor to put Sheridan's orders into execution, which were to dis solve the company from acting any longer on his ac count, and to close the season \u2014 this was done the 20th of April \u2014 at the same time, as the whole com pany were sufferers by arrears of salary, he offered them from Sheridan the use of the theatre, if they"], [440, "430 c. s. 1758-1759. chose to act some few more plays on their own ac count-this offer they accepted \u2014 but not finding it an swer to them, they finally closed the theatre May 28th. Victor distributed the money in his hands among the tradesmen, who had not received a farthing that season, and some of the poorer performers \u2014 this gave great offence to others \u2014 but he seems to have acted as uprightly as he could, under the existing circum stances \u2014 he left Ireland at the close of the Season \u2014 and here his account of the Irish Stage ends see his 108th letter.

Mossop had this season an Italian Opera company which was of infinite service to him as to profit, but very astonishingly hurt his own consequence as a per former, for the great box nights were chiefly confined to those of the Burlettas. ( Wilkinson.) The first performance of this kind was Dec. 19th. Mossop and Mrs. Fitzhenry were strengthened by the accession of an actor of considerable abilities, who had then been but a short time on the stage \u2014 Reddish made his 1st app. in Etan, and by his figure, voice and manner, made a very favourable impres sion on the audience. (Hitchcock.) Reddish about 1763 inserted a paragraph in the papers informing the public that he was a gentleman of easy fortune \u2014 as he was acting Sir John Dorilant he threw away a book which he had been reading and which was elegantly bound \u2014 a gentleman in the pit seeing him do this, said to Macklin, \" pray Sir,"], [469, "s. a. 1761-1762. 459 \"do you think that conduct natural ?\" \u2014 \" Why no \" Sir\" replied he gravely, \" not as Sir John Dorilant, \"but strictly natural as Mr. Reddish, for you know \"he has advertised himself as a gentleman of easy \" fortune.\" \u2014 thus Wilkinson \u2014 it is however Bel mour, who throws away a book in the School for Lovers\u2014 and there is a stage direction for him to do so. All in the Wrong, acted at D. L. in the summer, was gotten up at both theatres \u2014 they had the start at S. A. by six nights, and then it was not worth much to either party \u2014 (Hitchcock.) \u2014 in all proba bility, Mrs. Abington was Belinda at one house, and Mrs. Dancer at the other. In March, Barry and Mossop fixed their benefits for the same night, each intending to play Othello \u2014 \u2014 Mossop relying on his novelty, and Barry on his established reputation in that part \u2014 but by the inter position of the Lord Lieutenant, Barry postponed his benefit till the next night \u2014 he was inwardly not displeased that the critics might have an opportunity of seeing them separately \u2014 party zeal, added to cu riosity, brought more persons to the theatres, on both these evenings, than they could contain \u2014 in point of acting, Barry was as much superiour to Mossop, as Mossop would have been to him in Rich ard or Zanga \u2014 but from taking too much pains, he did not act his favourite part as well as usual. ( Wil- kinson.) Wilkinson says that King, who had been a great favourite at Dublin, having obtained some few weeks leave of absence from D. L., came to S. A. in May, but did not attract\u2014 and that owing to an influenza,"], [470, "460 s.

Hitchcock on the contrary tells us, that King was at this time a most deserving favourite with the town, that he first appeared in Ranger and Cadwallader and was received with that warmth of applause, which his former character and present improved state of acting, merited \u2014 he adds, that during his short stay he acted Perez \u2014 Sharp \u2014 Oakly \u2014 Lord George Brilliant \u2014 Benedick \u2014 Lovemore \u2014 Scrub \u2014 Fribble and Bayes \u2014 in these characters he was capi tally supported by Mrs. Abington. Wilkinson speaks of what happened while he was at Dublin, and is therefore more to be depended on than Hitchcock, who sometimes talks at random, and who is always inclined to represent things in the most favourable point of view. The victorious party at this theatre finished their career with eclat \u2014 but Mossop had no great reason to boast of the state of his finances, and might have said with Pyrrhus \" Such another victory would ruin us.\""], [471, "c. s. 1761-1762. 461 C.

Much about this time Mr. Thomas Barry was first introduced to the public in Tamerlane, his father playing Bajazet \u2014 this young man's figure was light and pleasing, his abilities were but moderate, he might just be said never to offend. Stamper was engaged this season \u2014 he had acted under the management of Victor and Sowdon in 1755-1756 \u2014 as the houses were but indifferent, the managers, as their last resource, brought forward Macklin, who acted Shylock, Iago and the Miser several times with success.

Macklin brought out Love a-la-Mode, which was acted 16 times in the course of the season \u2014 Sir Archy = Macklin : Sir Callaghan = Barry : Squire Groom = Woodward : and Beau Mordecai = Messink, who (as Wilkinson says) was excellent in a superiour degree."], [472, "462 c. s. 1761-1762. Sir Callaghan was partly the character of Barry himself in his convivial moments \u2014 for as he excelled in telling humourous stories relative to Irishmen and their blunders, he knew how to fill up the minuti\u00e6 of the picture to advantage \u2014 the heroism of his figure, and the frankness of his manners, gave that finish to the whole, which rendered it as perfect a piece of acting as perhaps ever was exhibited. (Cooke.) In order to oppose the musical pieces, which were performed with such success at S. A., Midas was first produced \u2014 in ridicule of the other house, it was ludicrously announced as being brought forward un der the conduct of Signior Josephi Vernoni (honest Joe Vernon) \u2014 it was then in 3 acts, but being found too long, was afterwards cut down to 2 \u2014 (Hitchcock) \u2014 the cast was Midas = Mahon : Apollo = Vernon : Pan = Morris : Dam\u00e6tas \u2014 Oliver : Daphne = Miss Elliot : Nysa = Miss Polly Young : Mysis = Mrs. Macneil : \u2014 Barry was to have performed Sileno, and rehearsed it several times \u2014 but not being equal to the musical part, he gave it up, and it was played by Corri. As you like it was from Woodward's Touchstone, Mrs. Dancer's Rosalind, and Vernon's singing, (in the character of Amiens) a great favourite in Dub lin. (O'Keeffe.) Wilkinson having completed his engagement at S. A. was prevailed on by Woodward to act 4 nights at C. S. \u2014 the 1st night he acted Kitely to Wood ward's Bobadill \u2014 his benefit was May 25th.

There is a considerable deal of truth in what Mack lin says, but still the grand point was, that Dublin could not maintain two theatres\u2014 yet this, Macklin would not see \u2014 he had written a pamphlet in fa vour of having two theatres, and he was of much too obstinate a disposition to retract an opinion so pub lickly given \u2014 Macklin, who was so fond of law him self, ought not to have reproached Mossop for being litigious \u2014 it was probably the consciousness of his own former habits, that restrained him from saying any thing about Mossop's gaming \u2014 Mossop, when he had a good house, instead of endeavouring to extricate himself by paying either performers or tradesmen, grew desperate, and flew to the fashion able gaming tables \u2014 he often left the theatre with a hundred guineas in his pocket, and returned home with an aching head and heart \u2014 the Countess of Brandon served him greatly it is true, but the money, she occasioned to be paid at the theatre, often went afterwards into her own pocket \u2014 such at least (as"], [502, "492 c. s. 1766-1767.
