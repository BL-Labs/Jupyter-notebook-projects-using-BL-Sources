OF the personal history of Robert Fabyan but few notices have reached us. There was nothing remarkable in his descent, and he made but little figure in public life. He was, however, an alderman of London, and presents us with the rare instance of a citizen and merchant, in the fifteenth century, devoting himself to the pleasures of Learning. From his Will it appears that his father's name was Iohn Fabyan ; and there is reason to believe that although he was apprenticed to a trade, his family were people of substantial respectability in Essex*. * Stephen Fabyan, one of his ancestors, held considerable property at Stisted in 1404 ; and afterwards became possessed of the manor of Ienkins. (See Morant's Hist, of Essex^ vol. ii. pp. 173, 392. A charter in the Harleian Collection, at the British Museum, (marked 85 D. 25.) mentions a Robert Fabyan of Concton in Surrey, in the tenth year of Henry IV. Another charter occurs in the same Collection (51 A. 9.) of the third year of Henry the Sixth, in which William Grouthous of Coggeshale in Essex, grants a messuage and its appurtenances to Stephen Fabyan, Robert Fabyan, Iohn Fabyan, Iohn Starlyng and others. There is also, in the Prerogative Office, the Will of Iohn Fabyan, citizen and draper, dated in 1477, in \\\\ Inch he speaks of his brethren Stephen and Robert Fabyan. His residence appears to have been at Coggeshall, where the first mentioned Stephen, according to IMorant, was a cordwainer. Another Will occurs, also, of a Thomas Fabyan early in the sixteenth century. Strype in his edition of Stowe's Survey, 1720, vol ii. b. iv. p. 113, mentions the will of Iohn Fabyan, gent. of the parish of St. Clement Danes, dated March 16, 1541 : in which he bequeaths to his sister Martha four nobles yearly, out of the lands he had purchased in Onngton, co. Essex, for her life. To the Lady Marney he bequeaths all his books of meditation, and his Chronicles ; and speaks of the lady Sperte as his sister, and of the earl of Southampton as his master. Strype, (who quotes Reg. Lavj. as his authority, in the margin,) mistook this for the will of the historian. Among the visitations in the Herald's College, four short pedigrees occur of the family of Fabyan, (C 24. 501. C 24. 424. 1 23. 73. Vin. 56. sol. 221.) bearing the same arms with the historian*, but all of them of the reign *f Charles the First. * Erm. Three fleurs-de-lis within a borJure Gu. MS. Coll. Arm. D. so]. 39. Bishop II"], [16, "11 PREFACE. Bishop Tanner says he was born in London*. At what period he became d, member of the Draper's Company cannot now be ascertained. Their registers would probably have furnished a clue to guess at the exact time of his birth. But the hall of that respectable body has been twice destroyed by fire, and they have no muniments which reach beyond the year 1602. From records in the City archives, however, it appears that he was alderman of the ward of Faringdon Without : in 1493 he served the office of sheriff: and, in the registers which go by the name of the Repertory, a few scattered memoranda are preserved of the part which he occasionally took, at a period somewhat later, in public transactions. On the 20th of September, 14>96, in the mayoralty of sir Henry Colet, we find him \" assigned and chosen,\" with Mr. Recorder and certain commoners, to ride to the king \" for redress of the new impositions raised and levied upon \" English cloths in the archduke's land.\" This probably alludes to the cir cumstance of Philip, to whom the emperor Maximilian had resigned the Low Countries the year before, exacting the duty of a florin upon every piece of English cloth imported into his dominions : but which he desisted from in the articles of agreement signed by his ambassadors in London, July 7th, 1497t\u00ab In the following year, when the Cornish rebels marched toward London, alderman Fabyan was appointed with Iohn Brooke, and Iohn Warner late sheriff, to keep the gates of Ludgate and Newgate, the postern of the house of Friars-preachers, and the Bar of the New Temple. A few months after, in the thirteenth of Henry VII. we find him an assessor upon the different wards of London, of the fifteenth which had been granted to the king for the Scottish war. In 1502, on the pretext of poverty, he resigned the alderman's gown ; not wishing to take the mayoralty : and probably retired to the mansion in Essex mentioned in his will. * Bibl. Brit. Hib. p. 272. t Compare Rapin, Hist. Eng. vol. i. p. 680. Act. Pub. xii. pp. 648, 654. That"], [17, "PREFACE, III That he was opulent at this period cannot be doubted. But he seems to have considered that the expences of the chief magistracy were too great, even at that time, to be sustained by a man who had a numerous family. He orders the figures, as will be seen in his will, of sixteen children, in brass, to be placed upon his monument. Stowe in his Survey of London*, gives the English part of the epitaph on Fabyan's tomb, from the church of Saint Michael Cornhill, and says he died in 151 IT\" adding that his monument was gone. Bale, who places Fabyan's death on February 28th, 1512, is probably nearest to the truth, as his will, though dated July 11th, 1511, was not proved till July 12th, 1513 ; which, according to the ecclesiastical computation, would be somewhat less than five months after the supposed time of his death. Fabyan's Will, of itself, affords a curious comment on the manners of the time of Henry the Eighth. A copy of it is here given from the Registry of the Prerogative Court of Canterbury.

No field, or plot of ground, however, in the parish, bears, at present, any similar appellation to Halsteds; nor could he find the marks of any ancient residence. No mention of any of the family occurs in the register : and though in a chest in the vestry he turned over several hundred deeds letters rent-rolls, &c. of the 13th, 14th, and 15th centuries, evidently muniments from the archives of the ancient lords of Theydon Gernon, not one contained a single reference even to the name.

From several passages in his History it is evident that Fabyan was conversant in French, and no layman of the age he lived in is said to have been better skilled in the Latin language. With these accomplishments, with great oppor tunities, and with a taste for poetry, he endeavoured to reconcile the discordant testimonies of historians : adding the fruits of personal observation in the latter and more interesting portion of his Chronicle. His poetry indeed, is not of a superior cast. Mr. Warton considered the \" Complaint of king Edward the Second\" to be the best of his metres : but observes that it is a translation from a Latin poem attributed to that monarch, but pro bably written by William of Wyrcestre. \" Our author's transitions/' he adds, \" from prose to verse, in the course of a prolix narrative, seem to be made with \" much ease, and when he begins to versify, the historian disappears only by \" the addition of rhyme and stanza*.\" The authorities which are cited in his Chronicle are numerous, and some of them but indistinctly named. Indeed he appears more than once to have quoted * Hist. Eng. Poet. vol. ii. p. 191. the"], [28, "PREFACE. XIV the same work by a diflerent appellation. The greater part of these could only have been known to him in manuscript. Such as were in print at the close ot the reign of Henry the seventh are noted in the margin.

The English edition is supposed to have been printed soon after 1471, when Caxton finished the translation. Fabyan, who understood no Greek, ascribes it to Homer. f And, in another place, Caxton's \" Boke called the Legeaunt of Seyntes.\" This was, no doubt, \" The Golden Legende,\" first printed by Caxton in 1483, a second time, according to Ames, without date ; and a third time in 1493. $ Whom he likewise quotes under two other denominations, \" Willielmus de Pontisicibus,\" and \" Willielmus de Regibus.\" See also Stow's Summarie of English Chronicles, edit. 8vo. 1570.

His \" Supplementum Chronicarum,\" was printed in sol. at Venice in 1483, 1486, 1490, and 1492 : _again, Brix. 1485. These earlier editions bring the history down to 1480.

Fabyan, like the old chroniclers in general, for fear of neglecting some impor tant facts, went beyond the age of historical certainty in his details. He divides his Chronicles into seven portions, giving a copy of verses as an epilogue to each, under the title of the Seven Joys of the Blessed Virgin. The six first portions bring his history from the landing of Brute to the Norman Conquest. The seventh extends from the Conquest to the conclusion. That he was a little tinged with superstition must be allowed : but he was no great favourer of the Monastic Institution!. His observations on some of the miracles related in his history are too pointed to be mistaken. On the preservation of the holy oil at Rheims from the time of St. Remigius, he remarks, \" to this report \" every man may give credence as hym Iyketh. For I fande not this wryten in \" the Gospell, nor yet in no booke of Holy Scriptures.\" He makes a similar observation on the supposed vision of Richard, the third Duke of Normandy, adding that \" Antonius archbishop of Florence, whan he reherseth any like nar \" racions which he thinketh somewhat doutefull, he ioyneth thyse wordes, and \" sayth pium est credere. \\\\\" In another place he says, at once, \" which is for \" folys to believes.\" Nor is he backward in pointing out the partiality of Ro- * \" Which he had seen or known.\" See p. 202. In the first folio of the second volume p. 293. he speaks of it as \" in Saxon tongue then used : but in later days, when the said laws and customs altered and changed, and for \" consideration also that the said book was of small hand, and sore defaced, it was the less set by, so that it was embezzled or lost.\" Fabyan says the names of the Portgreves of London before the time of Richard the First were entered in it. f Bishop Tanner has the following remark on this translation in his Bibliotheca Britannico-Hibernica, p. 321. \u00ab' At si extaret liber, quern Gallofridus primo cap. secundi libri Britannic\u00e6 Histori\u00e6 adfirmat Gild am de Victoria Aurelii Ambrosii scripsisse ; aut si rursus Leges Molmutiana, quas idem 18 cap. primi libri Histori\u00e6 Britannic\u00e6 asserit Gildam Latinitate donavisse, usquam comparerent ; sorsitan meliuscule de illo quantum ad antiquitatis pertinet cognitionem ; sentirem.\" Such a translation, he adds, in a note, is also mentroned by Castorius. \u00ab' Ita J, Castor, in Chronico MS.\" I See p. 305. \u00a7 p. 72.

A manuscript of the Second Volume of Fabyan's Chronicles, from which some valuable collations have been obtained for the present edition, is preserved in the library which formerly belonged to sir Robert Cotton, now in the British Museunvf-. It wants, unfortunately, several leaves toward the close : but having the Envoy which appears in the edition of 1533, is concluded originally to have been continued lower than the first printed copy. Stowe, in the Collections which he made for his Survey, speaks of a Continu ation by Fabyan himself, as low as the third year of Henry the Eighth ; ** which Boke (he adds) I have in writen hand;]:.\" It is not improbable that it might have gone from Stowe's Collection to Sir Robert Cotton's. There is another Manuscript, existing, in a private Library in Warwick shire. The edition of 1516, which forms the text of the present Work as far as P. 678, appears to have been edited by Pynson himself: who changed a Latin Table of Contents, at the beginning, to an English one. This, in the present Edition, has been superseded by an Index at the end. Instead of a Title it gives the Arms of Henry the Eighth crowned, sustained from below by a Dragon and a Greyhound. Above the Crown is a Rose supported by Angels with Scrolls. That on the left bears these words, Hec rosa Virtutis de Celo missa sereno. That on the right, Eternum forens regia sceptra feret. The same device is repeated on the other side of the leaf, and again at the beginning of the Second Volume.

Bale's assertion, it must be owned, is unsupported by any other writer. Certain, however, it is, that the second Edition did not appear till after the Cardinal's death. \" Fabyan's Cronycle newly prynted, wyth the Cronycle, Actes, and Dedes \" done in the tyme of the reygne of the moste excellent prynce Kynge Henry \" the VII. father vnto our most drad souerayne lord kynge Henry the \" VIII.

Within a year after the publication of the last Edition, in 1533, the papal authority in England had been abolished : and the very name of pope not only erased from the Service Books, but forbidden to be used. The changes of the times gave but little hope of security to any printer, even of an old work, if it contained facts or doctrines incompatible with the yiews of reformation. Among the more conspicuous of the omissions are \" the Seven Ioys of the \" blessed Virgin,\" with the Verses commending the persecution of one Badby a Lollard ; innumerable Miracles, particularly where they were taken from the \" Legend of Saints,\" or attributed to popes ; the Envoi/ at the close of the first Volume ; the whole of the twenty eighth year of Henry the Third ; all such passages as tended to encourage houses of religion, penance, pilgrimage, or the preservation of relics ; and whatever related to offences done to the \u2022 A few copies of this edition may be found with the name of William Bonham. But nothing was more usual^ at that period, than for a work to be printed for several publishers, each of whom had his single name to his own copies. c 2 Church"], [34, "PREFACE. XX Church of Rome, the shrines of Saints, the rejected sacraments, the burning of tapers, or the mass. Nor must the omission of such passages be forgotten in which any king, whether of England or France, is described as an \" Enemy to holy religious \" places.\" Henry the Second is no longer called the \"hammer of holy church :\" nor have we any notice of the repentance of Hugh bishop of Chester, for having expelled the monks of Coventry, who \" upon his death bed axed of God, that, for a due and convenient penance, he might redeem that offence by lying in the fire of purgatory from the day of his death to the general day of doom.\" But the most remarkable of all the passages altered or omitted are those which relate to the struggle between Henry the Second and archbishop Becket. The latter is no longer mentioned as a \" glorious martyr\" and a \" blessed saint,\" but as a \" traiterous bishop.\" The greater part of his History is silently omitted, and the rest accommodated to the changes which had taken place in religion. Among the more minute alterations the words \" holy\" and \" blessed\" are but rarely bestowed on saints or martyrs. In one place for '? martyred\" we have murdered ; and in another \" shewing that many virtues ben rehersed of the holy virgin Edyth,\" we have verses. The word \" pope\" is uniformly changed to bishop of Rome ; and Notes are occasionally inserted* not only against the papal authority, but against \" the readiness, Avickedness, and ambition,\" with which it was exerted. The Title to the fourth Edition of the Chronicles was as follows : \" The Chronicle of Fabian, whiche he nameth the Concordaunce of Histories, * newly perused. And continued from the beginnyng of king Henry the \" Seuenth, to thende of queene Mary, 1559- Mense Aprilis.

XXI and, at the back of it, was this Address, from \" THE PRINTER TO THE READER. \" \" Because the last printe of Fabian's Chronicle, was in many places altered from the first copie, I have caused it to be conferred with the first print of all, and set it foorthe in all pointes accordyng to the aucthour's meanyng. Also all through the stone of the Britons, wherein he followeth Geffrey of Monmouth, I haue caused, his storie to be conferred with Geffries, and noted the chapiters in the margine, where out the matter is taken, and such thynges as he (I wote not for what cause) omitted, I have caused to be translated, and duely placed vnder the perusers name. The like haue I doen for the moste parte, all the boke through, notyng the places of soche aucthours as be al- legeth. And bicause the controuersie and varieties, is greate emong writers, about the nomber of yeres, from Adams creation, to Christes incarnacion, therefore as master- Fabian followeth, the Septuaginta, and sainct Bede, so have I in the margine added the accompt of Ihon Functius and other, all through the Storie, till the beginnyng of our Sauiour, to the ende you maie knowe the diuersities of theim, and Iacke nothyng neces- sarie for the truthe.

GViderius, the firste Sone of Kymbalyne, beganne his reygne ouer the Brytons the yere of the worlde. v. M. CC. & xvi. And the yere after Christes Incarnacion the. xvii. yere. This1 was welthy and trusted moche in his strength, & for he thought the Romaynes had the forenamed tribute with wronge, he therfore of a knyghtly courage denyed to the Ro- maynes the said tribute, wherfore Claudius which was vncle vnto Caius Calligula the. iiii. Emperour of Rome, and this Claudius the fyste6 came into Brytayne with a great Army of Romaynes, and as wytnessyth Policronica, conqueryd and wanne agayne the sayd try- bute without great fight; and that done, he also subdued y lies of Orchades or Orkeis, whiche stande beyonde Scotlande within the great Occean, and after turned agayne to Rome the. vi. moneth after that he came thens. The Cronycle of Englade, and also Gaufride, say that in the Hoost of the Romaynes was a Capitayne named Hame or Hamon, the whiche entendynge hurte & destruccyon of the Brytons, chauged his Shelde or Armure and dydde vpon hym the Armoure of a Brytayne, and by that meane as a Bryton mysclad, and7 entred into the thyckest of the hoost, and lastly vnto the place where as kynge Guy- derius faught, and shortly after slewe the kynge. But Aruiragus seynge this sodayne Mys- chyef, to the ende y the Brytons shulde nat gyue backe, he hastely causyd hym8 to be Armed with the cognisaunce of the kynge, and so for kynge cotynued the fyght with suche man- hode that the Romaynes were put to flyght.

ARuiragus, the yongest sone of Kymbalyne, and brother to Guyderius before slayne, was ordeyned kynge of Brytons, in the yere of our Lorde. xliiii. This in the Englysshe booke is named Armager, the whiche, as there is shewed, well and knyghtly nraynteyned the warre agayne the Romaynes, and after slewe the forenamed Hamo nert vnto an Ha uen or port of the see, and hym, so slayne, threwe Gobetmeale into the same see. For this skyll was this Hauen longe tyme after called Hamons Hauen, which at this daye is call ed Southampton. Thenne it foloweth in the viii. Chapitre of the. iiii. Booke of Poli cronicon, that Claudius, after dyuers happes of Bataylle, toke Aruiragus to his grace, and brought his doughter, Genuissa' by name, from Rome, and Maryed her vnto Aruira gus ; and for he wolde make the place of the maryage more Solempne, he therfore called the Towne of maryage Claudiocestria after his name. The whiche before was called in Brettysshe tunge Caerleon, and aster Glouernia after a Duke of Demecia that hyght Glora, but nowe this Towne is named Glouceter. All otherwyse telleth the Englysshe Cronycle, and sayth, that Armager scomfitted Clau dius, and compelled hym to gyue his Doughter Genuissa or Gennen to the sayd Armager to wyfe, with condicion that the Romaynes shuld neuer after that day clayme any tribute of Brytayn, except alonely Feawte, whiche saying appereth doughtefull for dyuers causes. Wherof one is, that the sayd Armager shuld nat constreyne Claudius to gyue his dough ter to hym. For so moche as the sayd Armager had neuer seen the sayd Gennen before tyme, nor knewe nat of her Conuersacion. Thanne meruayl it were that he shuld force her Fader to gyue hym a wyfe that he hadde caste no loue vnto before tyme. One other reason is y the sayd Cronycle testyfyeth, that after he had maryed the sayde Gennen, he was at London Crowned kynge of Englande : For I wolde thynke if he hadde ouercomyn Claudius as there is surmytted1 he wolde firste haue crowned hymself kynge, and thenne haue maryed his Doughter, But by the same reason it certyfyeth more strenger the former sayinge of Policronica. For by all lykelyhod, Claudius wolde nat suffre hym to be Crowned kynge, tyll he hadde fully perfourmed his promyssein Mariyngeof his doughter. And albeit that myne Auctour Gaufride varyeth nat moch from the Englysshe Cronycle, I thynke in that doynge he tooke ensample of Homerus that wrote the dedys and Actes of the Grekes, the whiche shewed and put in Memorye all the noble Actes by theym doon. And specyally in the Recuyll or boke made by hym of y Siege of Troye. But the other dedys, concernynge theyr dishonoure, he hydde it as moche as he myght; and in lyke manere do many other wryters whiche I passe ouer : And so Gaufride, for he was a Bryton, he shewed the beste for Brytons. Thanne it foloweth after the Solempnyzacon of this Maryage, whiche was with all honoure fynysshed, Claudius sent certayne Legions of his knyghtes into Irlande to rule that Countre, and retoumed hym seise to Rome. Capitulum. lvi. IT was nat longe after the departynge of Claudius, but that Aruiragus rode aboute his Realme, and with great dilygence Repayred Cyties and Townes before decayed and broken with the strength of the Romaynes, and entreatyd his Subgettes with suche Ius tyce and good ordre that they loued & drade hym more thenne any of his progenytours. This in tracte of tyme made hym welthy, and by meane of this welthines ensued5 Pryde ; So that hym thought great shame to be vnder the rule or guydynge of the Romaynes: Wherfore lastly he denyed the tribute before graunted, wherof whanne knowleo-e came vnto the Senate of Rome, in all haste was sente a Duke of Rome called Vaspacian with a cerlayn of Legions to subdue Aruiragus.

Whenne Vaspacian hadde thus recoueryd the tribute, he than also made Subgette to the Empyre, an Ile in the see lyinge vpon the Sowthe syde of Brytayne, nowe called the Ile of Wyghte ; and after retoumed to Rome. Whenne Aruiragus was thus Secondly brought vnder y yoke of the Romaynes, he be came more myelde towarde theym. So that whyle he lyued after, he payde his tribute with lasse Grudge, and contynued hym in theyr fauoures, in such wyse that he was of theym wel beloued : And so lastly dyed whenne he hadde ruled the Brytons well and nobly, by the terme of. xxx. yeres, and was buryed at Caerglone, Caerleone, Claudiocestria or Glow ceter, leuynge after hym a sone named Manns*.

This, in the Cronycle of Englande, is named Westmer, whiche Alarms', as wytnessyth Gaufride, was an excellent wyse man, and guyded his Brytons moste honour ably, and in great prosperyte and welthe. In the tyme of the reygne of this Marins', a Duke or kynge of a nacion called Pictes, as* wytnessyth Virgilius, are descendyd of a People called of olde tymes Scytis', they also are named Gothis or Hunys. This fore sayd leder of Picts is named, of Gaufride, Rodris4, the whiche landed with a great Nauy, in the prouynce of Albania, now5 Scotlande, and it began to waste with Iron & with tyre. Wherof whanne Marins' was warned, he in all haste assembled his knyghtes, & made to warde his Enemyes and gaue vnto theym stronge batavll, in the which Rodris4 or after some Rodicus, was slayne, and a great parte of his people were slayne ; in remebrauce of whiche victory, kyng Marins' lette arrere a great stone, & I this he comauded to be gratien Marii victoria, which is to meane the victory of Marins'. Wylliam of Malmes bury sayth y this stone was arered in mynde of Manns' y Consull of Rome. The Eng lysshe Cronycle sayth that this batayll was foughtyn in a place, the whiche nowe is called Stanysmore. Butte where so this stone is sette, the Countre there aboute was logr after called West maria, and now Westmerlande : Then it foloweth in the Storye that when the resydue of the people of Rodicus6, whiche were fledde from the felde, vnderstode that theyr hedde and Capitayne was slayne, they made humble request to the kynge that he wolde accept theym vnto his grace, and that he wolde graunte to theym some Lande & Countre to dwell in * whiche graunted vnto theym a place in the ferre ende of Scotlande, whiche is named of myne Auctour Catenesey7, where the sayd Scytis8 or Pictes firste en habyte9 theym, and for somoche as the Brytons disdayned to gyue vnto theim theyr dough ters in Mariage, therfore they acqueynted them with the Irysshe men and maryed theyr doughters, and grewe in proces'0into a great people ; and for this Allyaunce attwene the Irysshe and them, theyr Countre as wytnessyth Policronico. xxxvii.

And whenne Marins1 had thus subdued his Enemyes, he attendyd and sette his mynde to the Comon wele of this lande and subgettes, and contynued the resydue of his lyt'e in great tranquyllyte and reste : And so lastly payde his naturall tribute and was buryed at Caerleyll, leuyng after hym a sone named Coilus or Coyll, whenne he had reygned after most wryters. lii. yeres. f Capitulum. lviii.

Of this is lytell or none acte no table put in memory, except that all wryters agree that this Lucius sent to Eleutherius, than pope' of Rome, certayne Pistles or letters, prayinge hym that he and his Britons myght be receyued to the sayth of crists Churche ; wherof the Pope* beynge very Ioyous and gladde, sent into Brytayne. ii. noble clerkes named Faganus and Damianus*, or af ter some Fugaeius and Dimianus; thyse. ii. good and vertuous clerkes were honourably receyued of Lucius, the whiche, by theyr good Doctryne k vertuous ensamples gyuynge, conuertyd the kynge and a great parte of the Brytons.

Thanne to pursue or contynewe the Story of this Constantyne, it foloweth that at the tyme of the decease of Constancius his Fader, he was occupied in warres in Gallia and those parties : after whose dethe he by a certayne Terme ruled Brytayne, and the other landes, the whiche his Fader before helde in due maner. And albeit that at that daye he was a Myscreant and pagan, yet he vsed no Tyrannyes, nor compelled not the Brytons to refuse the lawe and to worshyppe Idollys, as other Tyrauntes at those dayes vsed. In this whyle that Constantyne ruled thus the West parte of this Empyre, one Max encius, whiche was the sone of Herculeus Maxymyanus, somtyme felowe in the Empyre with Dioclesian, as before is shewed, was of the Knyghtes of the pretory declared Empe rour. This Maxencius was there worste of all men, and as testyfyeth Eusebius and other, he firste beganne mekely to wynne therby loue and fauoure; but whenne he was stab lysshed in Auctorytie, he excersysed all Tiranny, and pursued y Christen1 with all kynde of turment: Also he expulsed and put out from Rome and all honour, his fader Her culeus Maxymyanus y ententyd agayne to haue been Emperoure. Of the Tyranny of this Maxencius, whenne Constantyne hadde wyttynge, he assembled a great hoste of Brytons and Gallis, for to oppresse the malyce ofy- sayd Maxencius. And for to rule & guyde this Lande of Britayne in his absence, he deputed and or deyned a man of might called Octauius, the whiche Policronica nameth duke of Iewessis, that after were named west Saxons ; and whenne the sayd Constantyne had all preparyd for his voyage, he betoke y Lande of Britayne vnto the sayd Octauius, and after sped hym vpon his Iourney; and as he was towarde his sayde Iourney, he sawe in his slepe, the sygne of the Crosse shynynge in the Fyrmament, as it had ben a brennynge lyghte of Fyre, and an Aungell standynge therby and sayinge, \" Constantyne Toicanata,\" whiche is to meane, \" Constantyne by this token thou shalte wynne victory.\" Whenne he awoke he called this vicyon to mynde, and tolde vnto his Secretes, by whose Counsayll 1 wryter. \u2022 All Crystyens. lie"], [85, "QUARTA PARS CRONECARUM. 47 he comaunded the sygne of the Crosse to be peynted, and sette in his Baners and penons, and of all his knyghtes.

Trougthe it is that this Chilpericus, or after some Hilpericus toke to wyfe the doughter of the kynge of Spayne, called Atha nahildus, whose name was Golsanda, the whiche had to hir handemayden a mayde called Fredegunda, the whiche was of passynge beaute and shappe of body, but to hir was ioyned subtell wit & euyll codicions, contrary to hir lady & inastres, which was symple k of ver tuous condicions. To the yongest brother named Sigebert was cowpeled in maryage the syster of the sayde Golsanda, named Brunechieldis, or after the Frenshe Cronycle Bruneheuste, a wo man of peruers and wicked condicion, as after shall appere. Then it folowith, Chilperich within short tyme that he was thus maryed vnto Golsanda, caste vnlefull loue vnto hir woman Fredeguda, by reason wherof fell such vnkyndenesse atwene them, that lastly she was founden in her chambre dede and strangelyd w a corde, which was doone by the hande of hir husbande, as testyfyeth the Frenshe booke. Then secondly he maryed an other wyfe, named Audouera, a woma of great birth, how be it myn auctor, nor yet y Frensh Cronycle declarith not hir progeny, w the whiche he contynued, and kepte hir after hir honoure, but yet he withdrewe not his vnlefull loue from y forenamed Fredegunde.

IN this whyle the kyng with his brother occupyed I warre agayne the Swytezers, or men of Sweuy, bare them so knyghtly that they subdued theyr enemyes, & after re toumed into theyr coutreyes, wherof whan Fredegude was ware, she in secrete maner mette with y kynge, k shewyd to hym all the demeanure of his wyfe, but nothynge of hir owne crafty workyng, wherewith the kynge was greuously discorrtente in shewyng of his outewarde coutenauce, k sayde if y were true, she shuld frome hym be deuorcyd, and that she shuld be quene I hir stede. After this y kyng comyng to his paleys, y quene to thetent to be y more accepted in his presence, not knowynge of the malicious werkyng of Fredegud, brought I her armes the yonge baby, to the which she was moder bothe naturally, and spiritually, & welcomed f kynge hir lorde in right humble maner, salutynge hym w wordys of all comfort: but the'kynge beynge warnyd of hir symple demeanure, &, as some auctours wryte, glad that he had occasyo to fynde mater to hir of displeasure, blamed her 1 grieuous maner, & comaudyd hir but of his presence for y tyme, k after, by couceyll of spirituell men, caused hir frome hym to be deuorcid, & hir w hir yonge doughter to be put into an house of relygyon, to the which he gaue possessions forthe fyndyng of hir & of hir young doughter named Childeynda. And when Chilpericus had thus fynysshed this foresayd busynesse, he shortlye after tooke to wyfe y forenamed Fredegunde, not without grudge of some of his lordes and other. It was not longe after this maryage y stryfe & discencion fell atwene this Chilperich k Sigebert his brother, the whiche grewe for certayne lande y Chilperiche claymed to haue of his brother aforesayde. Then Chilperich assembled his knyghtes & made warre vpon the lande of his brother Sigebert, the which then was busyed in lyke warre agayne a people called Hunes, by reason wherof Chilperiche had y more fordell, & wan by strengthe the citie of Reynys. But it was not longe after or Sigebert was warnyd of his brothers vnkyndnes; wherfore he after his enemyes wer by hym sodele subdued, went with his army into the countrey of Soysons, belongyng to his brother Chilperich, & warred in lykewyse in y lande as his brother dyd in his, & at leyngth tooke the cytie of Soysons, & therein the eldest sone of Chilperich, named Theodobert, & held hym as his prysoner. Then Chilperich heryng of the scofiture of his people and takynge of his sone, was agayn his brother more feruently amouyd, & cast in his mynde all wayes & meanes howe he myght reuenge hym vpon his brother ; but it was in vayne, for his brother at y tyme had such auau tage of hym, that he well apperceyuyd y he had noo better meane than a treaty of peas, by meane wherof he shortly after opteyned his sone out of daunger, w other thynges con cernyng his profette, assurynge to his sayde brother by solempne othe that after y day he shuld neuer bere armes, nor yet warrey1 his brother.

Thus Chilperich was wrapped in wanes and trowbles of the worlde, sometyme w righte, and some whyle with wrong ; so that he some tyme wan worshyp, & otherwhyle he loste; whereof to tell all the circumstance I thynke it shuld be tedyous both to the reders & also to theherers; wherefore I passe ouer in abrydgynge and shortynge some deale of this Storye.

But lyke as often it happeneth that hote loue is soone colde, so this sodeyne deuocyon was soone aswaged, for lyke as his trowbles began to aswage, and his prosperyte to encreace, right so his olde eondicions began in hym to reuyue and quycken, soo that at length he re tournyd to his olde accustomed vycys.

It was not longe asterwarde, that Charlys had thus subduyd the foresayd people of Almayne, with also a great parte of Germayny, but that tydynges came to hym that Endo, duke of Gascoyne, rebellyd agayne the kyng of Fraunce; wherfore he in all goodly haste preparid his army, k sped hym \"into Gascoyne, where he made so ' defended * whom. cruell"], [171, "SEXTA PARS CRONICARUM. 133 Paganorwn crud.lit.js. truell warre, that he in shorte tyme damagid greatly the coutrey, & helde the duke Eudo so streygth, that he was compellyd to hy se hvm in secrete placis of the coutrey, where, after the' great serche he myght not be foiid. Wherfore he settynge the countrey in some restefulnes, retornyd hym into Fraunce. Whan Endo was sure of the retorne of Charlis into Fraunce, for so moche as he had prouyd the marciall knyghthode of hym, and knewe well he myght not of hymselfe witbstbde his knygbtlye powar, he therefore allyed hym with the kynge of Spayne, than beynge a pagan, or myscreaunt, & named Abyde - ramus, and excyted and styred hym to make warre vpon the lond of Fraunce, promys ynge to hym not all onely victory, but also the1 lond to hym and to his heyres for euer. Vpon comforte of whiche promyse, and also ayde of the sayde Endo, this fore named Arbideramus, thirstynge cristen nrannis bloode, k entendynge vtter desolacion and distruccion of the realme of Fraunce, assemblyd an excedynge hooste of people, and with theyr wyues and chyldren & catayll, entryd the londe of Fraunce, and what they wan they enioyed it as theyr owne ; and so in processe came vnto the cytie of Burdeaux, the whiche, after a certevne tyme of the cytesens defendyng, the sayde myscreauntis wan into theyr possessyon, and dystroyed the people therof, wyth all theyr churchys^ and temples of the same. And frome thens passynge the countrey in wastynge it with iron, and with fyre, lastlye came vnto Poytiers, which citie, as before ye haue harde in the story of the firste Dagobert, a C. and xxxii, chapter, was by hym subuertyd, and at this daye newely reedyfyed. This citie also of theym posscssyd, they in lyke maner as they had dalt with Burdeaux, soo dyd they with this, not sparinge that holy place of seynt Hyllary, but dyd vnto it great shame & vylany: and frome thens yode3 vnto Towers, wastynge and sleyng the people without mercy, by all the way that they passyd, \u201e banys shed4 that cytie as they had doon the other. In the which passe tyme, Charlys, heryng of the cruelte of this Arbideras, assemblyd his powar, k shortly met with hym nere vnto Towers, where he bare hym so knyghtly that he slewe of the Paganys an excedynge nombre6, to be actoi daunt with reason. But for I se it testyfyed of soo many wryters, it boldith me to expresse the nombre, whiche was. CCC. lxxx. and v. M. and odde. And of the Frenshmen were slayne but. xvC. oonly. For the which victoryous acte, the sayd Charlis obtevnyd a sur name, and was callyd after that day, Carolus Martellus, the which is to meane Charlis the hamer. For lyke as the hamer makyth all metallys plyable, so Charlis made his foos or enmyes plyable to his hestis ; & as the hamer cuttith, brekyth, or disseuerith iron and other harde metallys, so dyd this Charlis dismembre and cut or breke the enemyes of Fraunce throughe his hyghe prowesse. It is shewid in the Bookis callyd Cronyca Cronicarum, Supplementum Cronycarum, Polycronica, and other, that this victory was obteynyd by Charlis of the Sarasyns, but not as inhabytans or incolers of Spayne, but that they were issuyd out of Affryca, and than warryd and had wonne g, eat countreys in Spayne, the which is more accordaunt with hystoryes. For in the Plegys or Rehersayllvs of the names of kynges of Spayne, I fynde no kyng of that name.

But at that season he excusyd hym by sykenesse, & when he was recouerde, he feyned an other excuse. In this meane tyme, word was brought to the emperour, that his sone Lothayre had greuyd the Church of Rome, and takyn frome it certayne possessions, wherewith Lewys beynge before amoued, sent vnto his sone, commaundyng hym in sharpe wordes, that he shuld haue in mynde the othe before by hym made, & that he shulde, in exchewynge his displeasure, make restitucio of all thynges that he before had takyn from the churche ; the whiche comauudement Lothayre promysed to obey in all wyse. And where Lewys was determynyd to haue goon vnto Rome to haue seen the sayd promesse fulfylled, and also to haue spokyn with the pope', for dyuerse maters nedefull for y- church, he was let by occasyon of Danys or Normannys, f than had newely inuadyd the londys of Fraunce, the which he shortly after expellyd and droue out of his sayd londis. And that doon, the emperoure yode vnto Aquysgrany, where by the fredes of Indith & other of the nobles of Frauce, the emperour gaue vnto his yongest sone Charlys a porcion of y- empyre, which after shall more clerely appere. And soone after, at a cousayle holdyn at Carysyake before namyd, in the presence of his sone Lewys, he gaue to hym f ordre of knyghthode, & anournyd1 hym with kyngys clothynge, & ouer all this, in the presence of many lordes of Fraunce, he gaue to the sayd Charlys the hoole countrey of Nenstria5, that nowe is namyd Normandy. Of whiche honoure and gyftes, thoughe his moder were ioyous and glad, yet his brother Lewys was therewith no thynge contentyd, which of Indith and of hir fredys was well apperceyuyd and knowen : where- fore, as she beforetyme had don, tha of new she made requeste vnto hir lord & husbande y he wolde, of his moost especiall grace, graute vnto hyr, that Lothayre myght haue the gouernauce of hir sone Charlis, the whiche of hym was the seconde tyme grauntyd. Vpon whiche graunte thus to hyr made, the emperoure sent vnto his sone Lothayre plesaunt letters, wyllynge hym, in all goodly hast, to resorte vnto his courte : the whiche obeyinge his fathers comaundement, retornyd into Fraunce shortlye after the resayte of the sayd letters, and came vnto his father to the cytie of Vernayse, of whome he was ioyously reeeyuyd.

But whan he was de partyd from his father, & retorned to his owne lordshyp, gadered5 amyghty power, and bega to make warre vpon the dwellers nere about the Ryne, wherefore the emperoure with a conuenyent power approchyd vnto the citie of Dodaynge, and sent from thens vnto his sayd sone wordis of reconciliacion, by meane whereof the sayde Lewys put hym holy in the grace of his father, and was to hym reconsyled without shedynge of mannys blode.

Aster yet this, notwithstandynge, he lyke a stroge hartyd knyght, shewyd forthe a good and coufortable countenance; and after he had I knyghtly wyse preparyd all thynge necessarye to the warre, he sped hym towarde Almayne, and cotynued his iourney tyll he came vnto Thoryng, where a seaso he restid hym & his people tyll he might be better assurid where his sone Lewis restyd hym. But y sone hauynge knowlege of the great powar of his father, & also beynge in dispayre of pur chasyng of mercy, consyderynge his many offecis, fled by the country of Sclauony, and so by that costys retorned to Bayon, or Bauary, and so escaped the dauger of his father. Than the emperoure beynge surely enformyd of the scape of his sone, helde on his iour ney tyll he came to Magouce, and after came vnto the citie of Vermayse, where he called a a counsayll of his lordes spirituall & temporall, and ordeyned there dyuerse thynges for the state of the empyre, & more entedyd to haue doon ; but syknes increasyd so sore iu hym, y by the space of. xl. dayes he toke no temporall sustenaunce, but in that tyme he vsyd often to take the blessyd sacrament, the which, as he often sayde, strengthyd bothe the soule and the body.

The whiche fere & flyght of Frenshemen, as sayth myn auctoure, was sente to theym by dyuyne ;x foras moche as they so often before tyme had wonne thenne the pryce of theyr enemyes, and hadde nat therfore gyuen due thanke vnto God, but referred it to theyr owne strengthes and vertue. Than the Danys herynge of this disparblynge5 of the cristen hoost, reassembled theyr power, and prepayred theym to newe fyght. Wherfore the kynge called togyder his knyghtes, so, as before is sayd, disparbled', and mette with theym nere vnto y aboue named ryuer of Lyger ; but whan both hoostes were within a daye iourney, the kynge was aduysed by some of his counsayll that he shuld nat as than fyght with them, for the whiche cause he yode vnto Compeynge, and there kept the feest of Cristemas. And whyle the kynge was lodged in Compeynge, he delyuered his host vnto a noble ma of his lade, named Theodorych, wyllynge hym to go agayne the Danys, of whose exployt or spede myne auctour maketh no mensyon ; but sayth, that soone after the foresayd feest the kynge spedde hym to Turonne, where he sent to rayse theBrytons of lytell Brytaynne to withstande the foresayd enemyes. In the whiche passetyme he was there taken with a maledye, & from thens, in a lytter, caryed unto seynt Denys, where he dyed and was buryed, or, as sayth Maister Gagwyn, he died at Turonne, and was after conueyed vnto seynt Denys, and there buryed. But for al wryters ioyne the reygne of thyse. ii. brethernne in one, thereof4 I woll now shewe vnto you the syne or conclusyon of y other brother, called Charlys or Charlemaynne, the whiche all this whyle mayntayned the siege aboute Vyenne, where his brother, as before is touched, lefte him : to whome the lordes of Fraunce sent in all hast gyuynge to hym knowlege of the deth of his brother, and also of the grat daunger that the lande was in by reason of the Danys: wherof whan the sayde Charlys had thus wrytynge5, he lefte a parte of his people at the sayd siege, and with the other dele he sped hym towarde Champaynne, forsomoche as he was enfourmed that the Danys were drawen towarde that cost. And as he was in his iourney, worde was broughte vnto hym, that Vyenne was delyuered vnto suche persones as he hadde there left to mayntayne the siege: and after this came another messanger, whiche shewed to hym that the Danys had destroyed dyuers churches in'Champayne and other places, and howe the bysshop of Meaus, y agaynne them had lad an hoost of people, wasps them slayne, & his people chased : & ouer this, at the foresayd ryuer of Lyger, an other host of Danys, with theyr leder called Hastynges, was assembled, the which in y perties wasted y countre as y other in other places dyd, whiche somdele appalled the herte of thekynge Charlys ; howe be it, by the comforte that he dayly6 reseyued from the lordes of Frauce, he kepte on his iourney, & made towarde the nexte of his enemyes. But whan he drewe nere vnto theym, were it for his awne cowardyse, or of the coun seyll of his lordes, he fell to a comunycacion of pease; and fynally concluded, that Godfrey, y prynce of Danys, to confesse the sayth of Criste, and to be cristened, shulde enioye j hole prouynce of Fryse ; and within the same, he, with his Danys, to inhabyte theym.

But one myshap, amonges other, befell in Fraunce at thyse dayes : for Charles, their kynge, was taken from theym in suche wyse that no wryter leueth of hym any mensyon howe he dyed, nor whanne he dyed, nor mencyon' is made in the Frensche Cronycle, nor of myne auctour, howe longe whyle he and his brother Lowys reygned.

For where it is sayd that this Charles shuld leue asonne after hym, to me it semeth, that, consyderynge his youth, he shuld nat be of any lawfull age to get a chylde : for, by all lycklyhode of conuenyence of the storye, if all be veryfyed as it is before declared, he coude not pas the age of. viii. yeres, at y moste. Wherfore, it must folowe, of a congruence, that other they reygned lenger tyme, or ellys this childe, or heyre, Lowys aboue named, was y sone of some other man. \" But to folowe myne auctour, I shall precede as foloweth.

By meane of whiche promysses, this erle Hughe was ouercomen, & agreed with the kynge to warre vpon one parte of the coutre, whyle he warred vpon that other : and forthwith receyued an army of the kynge, and spedde hym to Bayonne, and made cruell warre vpon that countre: and kynge Lowys entrede vpon the prouynce of Caux, and wasted and spoyled that coste in all that he myght.

Of this message the kynge was ryght fayne, & forthwith sped hym tyll he came to Roan, wher he was, accordynge to his honoure, receyued. For the whiche cause he sent in all hast vnto Arnulfe erle of Flaunders, manassynge hym that he sease of his warres in Bayon tyll he receyued farther knowlege.

And ouer this, the foresayd Barnarde, ferynge the kynges retourne & other more greuous punysshement than they before had susteyned, sent his messagers vnto Grolle, kynge of Denmarke, thanne beynge at Chierbourc, wyllynge hym to assemble his people, and to make of them two hostes, wherof to sende that one by lande, and that other iourney. a Cosuy. 3 Cousy. by"], [227, "1$9 SEXTA PARS LODOUICI QUINTI. by water ; and so to enter the countre of Normandy in wastyng and spoylynge it, by reason wherof he myght brynge the kynge to some comunycacion, w hiche all was done as f said Barnarde had deuysed.

But the moder subtel of wyt, bethoHght her of a wyle, and sent a seruaut of hers, whiche was both comely and fayre, toy kynges bedde. In the mornynge, whan the daye began to wax clere, the woman began to styrre, & wolde haue departed from the kynge ; but the kyng refrayned her, and asked y cause of her so hasty departynge. For I muste be at my weike with my felowes, sayd y woman, at myn houre, to kepe my taske. And whan the kynge had questyoned with her further, he lerned that she was a bonde woman, and asked of the kynge fredam for that nyght ser uyce.

This wonder, with the other, caused sylence amonges theym that entended to mayntayne this foresayd quarell, so y Dunstanne had all his wyll. Thus passynge the tyme of the reygne of Edwarde the kynge, he came vpon a season from hunlynge in the forest or wodde, aster some wryters, nere to y casteil of Corse in y west countre, where he, losyng his company & seruauntes, resorted vnto the casteil be foresayd, where at that tyme his moder, with her sone Egelredus, kepte her howsholde.

And ouer that, the comon people were so of them oppressed, y for fere & drede, they called them, in euery such house as they had rule of, lord Dane. But in processe of tyme the Danys1 were voyded y lande. This worde lorde Dane was, in dyrision and despyte of the Danys, tourned by the Englysshemen into a name of opprobrie, and called Lurdayn, whiche, to our dayes, is nat forgoten; but whan one En glisshe man woll rebuke an other, he woll, for the more rebuke, call hym Lurdayn. Than to retourne to our firste matyer, truthe it is, that whanne the Danys were thus murdred thorugh Englande, tydynges therof sprange into Denmarke, whiche kyndeled in theym suche a fury, that the kynge therof, named Swanus, assembled shortly a great host and nauy of Danys, and, in short processe after, landed in Cornewayll; and by treason of a Norman, named Hugh, by3 fauour of y quene Emma, was made erle of Deuenshyre, the sayd Swanus toke Exetour, and after bette downe the walles. Than he entrede further into the lande. In whiche season the kynge sent vnto Edricus, chargynge hym to assemble the West Saxons, and to withstande y further entre of the Danys ; the which, accordynge to his comyssion, assembled the West Saxons, and made good countenaunce to withstande the sayd enemyes. But whan the hostes shulde ioyne, were it for fere or for treason, he fayned hym syke, and fled from his people. The whiche, for lacke of an hede, were fayne to gyue backe to their hurte, and to their enemyes great auauntage and coforte. Wherfore y Danys resorted than to Wyltonne and Shyrbornne, and anone spoyled both' those townes, and there refresshed theym. But for Swanus had wyttynge that the kynge was comynge towarde hym with the power of his lande, he therfore departed thens, and retoumed with great pyllage to his shyppes, and sayled aboute the lande, and lastly landed in Norfolke ; where he, wastyng and spoylynge the countre, came, in processe, vnto the cytie of Norwyche, 8c robbed & spoyled it, and after yode to Thetforde, and dyd lykewyse to that towne, and fyred it, and destroyed the countre nere there aboute. But soone after, a noble man of that countre, called duke Vskatell, mette with the hoost of Danys, and gaue vnto theym an harde and sharpe batayl, & slewe many of the enemyes, and put them backe. For this, and for hunger that than assayled this lande, Swanus retoumed este vnto his shyppes, and departed agayne into Denmarke, and taryed there all the wynter folowynge, in whiche season he made great prouysion to reenter the lande of Englande.

But whyle this was in doynge, the Danys destroyed a great parte of Baroke or Barkshyre. , Whanne this peace was thus made, Swanus with his company retoumed into Denmark, and that yere folowynge, the kynge made Edricus, forenamed, duke of Mercia. This Edricus was of lowe byrth, ryche of tunge, fake, and subtyll of wytte, soste and elo quent of speche, vntrusty and false of thought and promyse, as of hym some dele before is shewed, and after more shall apere. In the. xxvii. yere of Egelredus, a prynce of Danys, named Turkyllus, landed in Kent, the which so greuously warred in that countre, that the Kentysshmen were fayne to make theyr peace, and so departed.

Thus con tynuynge this misery, Swanus, or, after y Englysshe, Swayne, than beynge in Denmarke, and herynge of the encreace of his people within Englande, repented hym of his former couenauntes, and thought that the hole domynyon of Englande shulde belonge to hym of ryght : for the whiche he prepayred his armye and nauy in moost defensyble wyse, and spede hym in to Englande, & so into the ryuer of Humbre, and landed in Nortumberlande, where the erle or ruler of that coutre, with all the rulers of the same, sware feaute vnto the sayd Swanus, and promysed to kepe that countre vnto his vse. And whan he had done his wyll in that coste, he entred agaynne the water, and by the ryuer of Trent, he passed to Gaynysburghe, and so by North Watlyngstrete, 8c subdued the inhabytautes of that coutre, & forced theym to gyue vnto hym pledges, which pledges, vV also his nauy, he betoke vnto Canutus, his sone, whyle he went ferther into the lande ; and that done, he with his people kept on his iourney tyll he came into Mercia, kyllynge and sleynge the men of that prouynce, and reserued the wymen to vnclene lyuynge, aswell the relygyous as other ; and toke, by strength, Wynchester and Oxenforde, and dyd in theym what he lyked.

Whan Swanus was ascertayned of the departynge of Egelredus out of the lande, he wasenflamed with excedynge pryde, so that he arered excedynge inposicions of the people, & greued theym wonderfully, and amonges other of his tyranyes, he asked a great surne of money of seynt Edmundes landes, whiche the rulers denayed ; for somoche as they claymed to be free of all kynges trybute. For this he entred the terytory of seynt Ed munde, and wasted and spoyled the countree ; and ouer that, despysed that holy martyr with manassyng of the place of his sepulture. Wherfore the men of that countree, ferynge this tyraunt, gaue theym to fastyng and prayer : so that shortly after he was stycked in an euenynge, amonges his knyghtes, with the swerde of seynt Edmunde, in the towne of vindicta diuina.

But more verely, as before is touched in the aboue named story, and in y ende therof, this Hugh was stroge & myghty, and in the latter dayes of Lothair coueted y rule of y lande. Wherfore, after the deth of this Lowys, for so moche as he laste no childe after hym, he than hauynge the chief rule of Fraunce, by strengthe and power, made hym seise kynge. But for I promysed, in the story of Egelredus, somwhat to shewe of Richarde, the firste of that name, and thirde duke of Normandy, I shall somdele length this story, with the story of y sayd Richarde. This Richarde, as afferme all wryters, was named Richarde without fere, and for this cause1, as testyfieth the Frenshe boke, he vsed moche to byd his bedys for all Cristen soules.

And for this chaunce, he ordeyned aster, thorough his realme, that a corps shuld be watched the firste nyght orlenger, as men had deuocion; whiche gyse was somtyme vsed in Englande, and begon of' the Normans, as men may coniecture, after they had first conquered this lande.

This Robert, as sayth the Frensshe Boke, buylded firste the castle of Mountfort: he fouded also dyuers mo- nasteryes and temples, and at Orlyaunce, the temple of saynt Anyan, at Stamps, a churche of oure lady, and dyuers other in dyuers places of his realme.

M. xvi., and the. xix. yere of Robert, thanne kynge'of Fraunce. For the Londoners, with assystence of some of the lordes of Englande', but the more party of the lordes fauoured Canutus, and specyally the spyritualtie that, before tyme, had sworne feautie to his fader; and he, than beyng at Southampton, swore to theym to be vnto theym a good and trewe iustyce, and to entrete the people soberly & right wysely. Than Edmunde beynge of the arche bysshop of Yorke crowned at London, and the solempnytie fynysshed and ended, he sped hym into West Saxon, and subdued that countre. In whiche tyme Canutus, whiche, in the Englysshe story, is called Knough, drewe with his people to London, and wold there haue entrede; but that was hym forboden of the Londoners, for the whiche he layde his ordenaunce about the cytie, entendynge to haue entrede parforce : but it was nat longe or he was fayne to breke his siege, and to departe thens. Whanne Canutus was thus put of from London, he drewe Westwarde, and mette in processe with Edmunde in Dorset shyre, besyde Gyllyngham, where atwene theym wasfoughten a stronge and cruell batayll. But, in the ende, Canutus was ouercomen and compelled to forsake the felde. After this they mette agayne in Worcetour shyre, where they fought a more stronger batayl: for this was so strongly bydden by, that men coude nat iudge whiche parte had the better, or whiche y worse: but, as wytnesseth Polycronica, eyther of them departed frome other, outher for werynesse of fyght, or for lak of the daye. But vpon the mome folowynge, both hoostes ioyned agayne & fought egerly, contynu yng with1 fyght, Edricus espyinge Edmunde to be at auauntage of wynnynge of the felde, sodaynly pyght a deed miinys hede vpon a spere hede, and cryed to the hoost of En glysshemen, \" Fie, fle ye Englysshe men, and saue your seise : loo here is the hede of Ed munde your kynge.\" But Edmund therof beynge warned, sped hym towarde that parte of the felde, and behaued hym so comfortably amonges his men, that by his knyghtly courage his people recouered that they before had loste, and contynued the batayll tyll nyght, in suche wyse that he had rather the better than the worse, and caused Canutus to refuse that countre, and to retourne towarde London agayne. Than Edmunde beynge aduertysed that Canutus was retoumed towarde London, he folowed hym, and passed the ryuer of Thamys, and delyuered the cytie from dauger of the Danys; and afterwarde encountered the Danys at a place called Brentforde, where with theym he hadde a cruell fyghte, and scomfyted theym at length. In this passe tyme, Emma f wyfe of Egelredus, feryng the fortune of the warre, sent her. ii. sonnes, Alphrede and Edwarde, vnto her brother Richarde, the seconde of that name, and fourth duke of Normandy. Edricus than, whiche, as before is sayde, was euer sub tyle of wytte, consyderynge the good fortune of Edmunde and his knyghtly courage, thought that at length he shulde ouercome the Danys. Wherfore to saue his lande, and also to brynge aboute his malycyous treason, sought' the wayes and meanes how he might stande in his grace and fauoure ; and at length optayned his entente, and swore to hym to be his trewe subiecte.

Than the. ii. hoostes met soon after, at a place called Asshedowne, where after longe fight, Edricus with his retynewe fledde, to the comforte of the Danys, by meane wherof kynge Edmunde was put to the warse : for many noble men were slayne vpon his partie, amonges the whiche, the bysshop of Lyncolii and the abbot of Ramysey were two, that thyther were comen to treate a peace atwene both prynces.

Thus contynuynge this mortall warre bytwixt thyse. ii. marcyall prynces, to the great disolacion and mortalytie of the people, one of the knyghtes of the partye of Edmunde, gatte hym to an hyghe place where he myght be somwhat harde of the hoost, and spake in this wyse; \"Dayly we dye, and noo man hathe the victory; for Edmunde may nat be ouercome for his great strengthe, and Canutus may nat be ouer- verba mUitis. come for fauoure of fortune.

After whiche peace ended, were it by occasyon of thyse wordes or otherwyse, the sayd. ii. dukes, Edmunde & Canutus, agreed to trye theyr quarelles bytwene them two only, and for this was assygned, by theyr bothe agrementes, a lytell ile called than Olney nere vnto Glowcetour, or after some wryters, named Olenege, bycleped with the water of Seuarne; in whiche place, at the daye apoynted, the. ii. champyons mette, without company or assystence, within the sayd ile, but the hoostes of both parties standyng without the ile, and there abydynge the fortune of this batayll.

But the serpent Idre of enuy and false conspyracy, whiche euer burned in the harte of Edricus, was kyndeled so sore, that of pure force it must breke out vpon a lyght flambe. So what he myght nat accomplysshe by his owne persone, he fulfylled by his sone, as testyfyeth dyuers auctours. For, as affermeth Guydo, this sone of Edricus, awaytynge his tyme, espyed whan the kynge was at the withdraught to purge nature, and with a spere strake hym into the foundement, and so into the body ; wherof kyng Edmunde dyed shortly after at Oxin1.

Wherunto it was answered of the lordes, naye; affermynge farthermore with oth for the kynges pleasure, that they, to the vttermoste of theyr powers, wolde put of that blode of Edmude in all that they myght. By reason of whiche answere and promyse, they thought, many of theym, to haue standen in y great grace and fauoure of f kyng ; butit tourned all other wyse : for many of theym, jor the more partie, suche as Canutus apperceyued and knewe, that they before tyme were sworne to Edmunde and his heyres, and also were natyfe Englyssemen, he mystrust .ed and disdayned euer after ; in so moche, that some he exyled, and some were slayne, and some, by Goddes punysshement, dyed sodaynly. But among all, Edricus, with his sugred wordes, contynued in the kynges fauoure, as sayth Marianus, before mynded ; by whose cousayll and other, he shortly after outlawed the foresayd brother of Edmunde, surnamed kynge Charlys, as before is touched : but he afterwarde was reconcyled to the kynges fauoure, and lastly slayne of his owne ser uauntes. Canutus also, by the sayd counsayll, sent the. ii. sonnes of Edmunde, named, as before is sayd, Edmunde and Edwarde, vnto his brother Swanus, than kynge of Den marke, to be slayne, after the oppynyon of some wryters.

Wherof herynge, the Frenshe kynge, with his people, sped hym to warde Wyllyam, to reuenge the shame done to his men ; but in coclusion he wan ther no honour. Than peas was made atwene the kynge and the duke, and the Frenshe prysoners were delyuered.

Of this new warre duke Wyllyam beynge warned, in all haste assembled his Normeynes, and sped hym the next waye to mete the Frenshemen. In this meane whyle, y Frenshe kynge had passed the water-w certayne of his host, trustynge that the remenaunt shuld haue folowed, but soone after the water flowed so fast that his people myght nat passe, and in this whyle came the duke and sette vpon the kynges hoost, and bet theym downe cruelly; so that at lengthe the kynge was compelled to flee, &; loste great noumbre of his knyghtes : to consyder theim that were slayne with y other that were taken pry soners. Whanne kynge Henry had wele desgested in his mynde the wrongful trouble that he, by enuyous persons, hadde put the duke vnto, and remembred the ylle expedycion that he had in that warre, he reconsyled hym seise, and made meanes that the duke and he myght be agreed and accorded ; the whiche, by discrete solycitours, was shortly after brought to good effecte, so that they cotynued as frendes durynge theyr lyues after.

Thus1 Hardykynytus, aster some auctours, maryed his suster, named Gunylda, vnto the thirde Henry, emperour, the whiche was of passynge beaute, & was the doughter also of Emma, laste wyfe of Canutus. But, in processe of tyme, this Gunylda was falsely accused of spowsebrech, for tryall wherof she was put to her champion' ; wherfore she beynge in great agony, lastly trustynge to God, and knowynge herself without gylte of that offence, put a childe that she with her had brought out of Englande, instede of the champyon, the whiche faught with a man of gyauntes stature, and fynally hym slewe and brought vnto vtteraunce*.

This erle had many sonnes, as wytnesseth Policronicon, in y. xxv. Chapiter of his vi. boke. By his firste wyfe that was kynge Canutus suster and nat his doughter, as is abouesayd, he had one sone, the whiche, by vndyscrete strykynge of an horse, was throwyn into the Thamys, and drowned ; and the moder was lastly smytten with lyghtenynge, 8c so dyed : of whome it is there remebred that she was so vngracious and of vyle condycyons, that she sette yonge women to hore dome, for to gader by that vnlefull meane rychesse.

By whiche meanes he gatte auctorytie to order that matyer as to hym semed beste or of his owne power, because he was of moost myght next y kynge.

For Gerald us Cambrensis, in his boke called Itineranus3 sayth, that after Harolde had receiued many woundesr and lost his lefte iye, he fledde from that felde to the coutre of Chester, and lyued longe after an holy lyfe, as an ancre, in the selle of seynt lames, faste by seynt lohtis Ghurche, aud made there an holy ende, than the deth of Harolde was knowen to the erles of Mer cia and of Northumberlande, the whiche, for streytnesse of waye myght nat brynge theyr people to that felde, or els for that that they wylfully vVdrewe theym selfe from Harolde, byeause he none otherwyse departed the prayes amonges theym. and theyr knyghtes at the former felde of Norgaynes, than they drewe the next waye to London, and toke Agatha, Haroldes wyfe, and sente her to Chester, and they & Aldredus, bysshop of Yorke, with y Lodoners agreed and promysed, eyther vnto other, that they wolde make Edgare Athelynge kynge, and defende his ryght to the vtterrnoste of theyr powers.

M lxvii. and the. ix. yere of y firste Philyppe, than kynge of Fraunce : and was crowned kyng of the same, vpon Cristemas daye nexte folowynge, of Aldredus, archebysshop of Yorke; for so moche as at that tyme, Stigan dus, archebisshop of Caunterbury, was than absent or durst nat come in the presence of the kynge, to whom he ought no great fauoure, as in the sequele shall appere. Whan Wyllyam had set in quyet a great parte of this lande, he betoke the gydynge therof to his brother, the bysshop of Bayon, and in Lent folowynge, sayled into Normandy, and led with hym the chief rulers of England, for doute of sturrynge in tyme of his absence ; amonge the whiche, f. ij. erles Morcarus 8c Edwyn, rulers of Northumberlande and Mercya, were, ij., with also Stigandus, and Edgare Ethelynge. To the whiche Stigandus Wyllyam shewed great reuerence, and countenaunce of fa uoure, but all proued to great discymulacion after as was shewed by the depryuynge of the sayd Stigandus, & prysonement of hym in Wynchester towne, by a longe tyme & season. In the nexte wynter, when Wyllyam had spedhisbesynessein Normandye, he retoumed into Englande with great pompe, and sette a greuous trybute vpon the Englysshe men; by reason wherof some parlies of the lande rebelled agayne hym, and specially the cytie of Excetour, the whiche defended hym for a certayne of tyme : but lastly, by force, he wanne the sayde cytie, and punysshed the cytezeynsgreuously. For this, 8c other sterne dedes of Wyllyam, Morcharus, erle of Northumberlande, with Edgare Athelynge, and dyuers other, as his moder and. ii. susters, Margarete, and Crystyan, sayled into Scotlande: but another Cronicle telleth, that Edgare entendynge w Agatha, his moder, and his. ii. susters to haue sayled into Almayne, where he was borne, was, by tempest of y see, drvuen into Scot lande, wher of Malcolyne, than kynge of Scottes, they were ioyntly* receyued. And in processe of tyme the sayd Malcolyne caste suche loue vnto the sayd Margaret, that he toke her to wyfe, as before is touched, in the firste Chapitre of y story of Canutus; of the whiche Margaret, the sayd Malcolyne receyued. vi. sonnes1: thre, named Edgare, Alexaunder, and Dauyd, were kynges of Scotland next folowynge theyr fader ; and Molde, one of the foresayde doughters, was after maryed vnto the firste Henry, kynge of Englande, and other' Mary was maryed to Eustace, erie of Bolongii. Of Molde, the firste doughter, Henry receyued. ii. sonnes, named Wyllyam and Richarde, the whiche bothe dyed before theyr fader, as after in thestorye of the sayde Henry shall appere ; and he receyued also. ii. doughters, named Molde and Mary, whiche Molde or Mawde was maryed to the fyfte Henry, emperoure of Almayne ; after whose dethe she was agayne maryed to Godfley of4 Geoffrey Plantagenet, erle of Aungeowe, of whom dessended H;my, surnamed Shorte mantell, and kynge cf Englande, called Henry the seconde.

Than it foloweth, that this Wil lyam, after this foresayd trybute so leuyed of the Englysshemen, and knowynge of the depertynge of the lordes foresayd, kept the other the streyter. But it was nat longe after that Marcharus was reconsyled to the kynges grace, and sayled agayne, as folowyngly shalbe shewed. For this and other causes, whiche were tedyous to shewe, Wyllyam ex alted [the Normans, and gaue vnto theym]1 the chief possessyons of the lande, so that they dayly encreased in great honour and welth, and the Englysshemen as faste decayed. Kynge Wyllyam also made. iiii. stronge camelles, wherof. ii. be* sette at Yorke, the thirde at Lyndetyngham or Notyngham, and manned theym with Normayns, and the. iiii. at Lyncolne. Aboute the thirde yere of his reygne, Harolde and Canutus, sones of Swanus, kynge of Denmarke, came on lande in the Northe of Humber, with a stronge nauy, and in all haste drewe theym towarde Yorke. Than the Normayns, which hadde the rule of the towne and castelles, ferynge that the Englysshemen would haue eyded the5 Danys, and with the houses the* suburbes of the towne, haue fylled the towne dyches, sette the suburbes on fyre ; wherof y flame was so bygge, and with that5 wynde so stronge, that it toke into the cytie, and brente a parte therof with the mynster of seynt Peter. In tyme wherof the Danys, by fauour of some of the cytezeyns, entered the cytie, and slewe mo than. iii. M. of the Normayns. But it was nat longe or kynge Willyam chased the Danys to theyr shyppes, and toke so great displeasure with the inhabytauntes of that prouynce, that he destroyed the lande lyinge bytweene Yorke and Durham, in suche wyse, that. ix. yeres after or there aboute, the lande laye vnlabored and vntylled, oonly out taken seynt Iohfrs lande of Beuerley, [the whiche was forborne by reason of a wveche done by dyuyne power vpon one of kynge Wyllyams knyghtes, the whiche, as he was besyed in wastynge and spoylinge of the sayd countre, fyll scdeynly with his horse, so that his horse brake his necke, and the knyghtes face was turned to his backe.]1 And of the famyne that the people of that countre susteyned, wonders are reported that they shuld ete all maner of vermayne, as cattes, rattes, dogges, & other, so harde they were kepte by the warre of the kyng ; & in y yere also Molde or Mawde, the wyfe of kynge Wyllyam, was crowned quene of Englande, of Aldredus, archebysshop of Yorke. In the. iiii. yere of the reygne of this kynge, the Scottes, with Malcolyne theyr kynge, entred Northumberlande, & wasted & destroyed sore that countre, & slewe therin moche people, & many they toke prysoners, & helde theym as bonde men. But in the. vi. yere of his kyngdome, Wylliam made suche warre vpon the Scottes, that he lastly forced the sayd Malcolyne to swere to hym bothe homage and feautye, as it is wytnessed of Wyllyam of Malmesbury, and other wryters.

KYnge Wyllyam, by cousayll of the erle of Hertforde and other, caused the abbeys of Englande to be serched, and what money in theym at y season was founde, he caused it to be brought to his treasour ; [for the which dede, after the exposycion of some auctours, the sayd erle was punysshed, as aster shalbe shewed.]' So6 vpon this, in the tyme atwene Easter and Wytsontyde, was nolden a solempne counsayll at Wynchester, of the clergy of Englande, at the whiche counsayll were pre sent ii. cardynalles sent from the seconde Alexaunder, than pope.7 In this cousayll Stigandus, archebysshop of Cauterbury, was depryued from his dignytie, and that for. iii. skylles.

Than Stigandus proued y benyuolence of kyng Willyam : for where before he made to hym louyng & frendly countenaunce, & dyd vnto hym great reuerence, than he changed all his myldenesse into stemesse, and excused hym by the popes' auctoryte; so that in the ende, Stigandus was depryued of his dignytie, and kept in Wynchester, as a prysoner, terme* of his lyfe. It is recorded of hym, y he was so couetous & sparynge, that he wold take no thynge of his owne, and vsed to swere by Alhalowes, that he had nat one peny ; but y othe was proued vntrewe after his deth, by a lytell keye y was founde fastened aboute his necke, for by y keye was founden great trea sour vnder the erth, in moo places than one. In this counsayll also were put downe dyuers other bysshoppes, abbottes, and pryours, by the meanes of kynge Wyllyam, and also to1 thentent y he might preferre Normayns to the rule of y churche, as he had preferred his knyghtes to the rule of the temperaltie, that he myght stande in the more suertie of the lande. In this cousayll seynt Wolstane, than* was bysshop of Worcetour, axed besely of the kynge certayne possessyos, fallen Ito his hades by y deth of Aldredus, last archebys shop of Yorke, that were withholden by the sayd Aldredus ; but the kynge myght nat here than of any suche matyers, for hurtyng of f lybertye of y churche of Yorke. Than vpon Wytsondaye after, the kyng gaue the sayde archebysshopryche of Yorke vnto Thomas, a chanon of Bayon, & sent for Lamfranke, an other Normayn, than abbot of Cadomonency, and gaue vnto hym the archebysshopryche of Cauterbury. This Lamfranke was an Italyan borne, & was perfytely lerned in the scyence of theologie or holy wrytte, and ryght apte in gouemynge of thynges bothe spyrituall and temporall. Vpon our Lady daye the Assumption, the kynge made hym archebysshop of Caunterbury. Than Thomas, that was chosen archebysshop of Yorke, came vnto Lamfranke for to be sacred -any vsage wolde ; of whom Lamfranke axed an othe, and his profession in wry tynge concernynge his obedyence. Thomas answered and sayd, that he wolde neuer do that; but if he myght therof here suffycyent auctorytie and skylfull reasons & byndynge, by y whiche it myght be knowen thut he shuld so do without any preiudyce of his churche. Than Lainfrank shewed and proued skylfuliy that his askynge was reasonable and right full ; but yet Thomas wolde nat assent, but withsayd it, & went for that tyme from Lam franke vnsacred, Sc shewed vnto the kynge that Lamfranke entended to do wronge to hym, and to his churche of Yorke. Than the kynge callyng Lamfrank before hym said, that5 he trusted more in his cunnynge, than he dyd in good sayth or reason ; but he an swered so reasonably vnto y kynge, that in the ende, Thomas, by y comaundement of y kyng, was fayned to come agayne to Lamfranke to be sacred, and wrote his profession, with his owne hande, of his obedyence, and radde it : in the whiche was conleyned, that he shulde be obedyent in all that belongeth to the worshyp of God & all Cristen faith; whiche done, he was sacred, and so departed : and shortly aster Lamfrank axed and toke profession of ail y bysshoppes of Englande.

In the. vi. yere of his reygne, kyng Willyam, as before is touched, went with a great army into Scotlande, and subdued Malcolyne, theyr kynge, as before I haue shewed in the precedynge Chapiter. In the. vii. yere of kynge Wyllyam, Thomas, archebysshop of Yorke, nat beynge content to be vnder the rule and obedyence of Lamfranke, appealed to f courte of Rome; so that the sayde. ii. archebysshoppes ap pered bothe in proper persone, before pope\" Alexaunder, afore named, in whose presence Lamfranke was so well fauoured, that where Thomas, aboue named, and Rernigius, bysshop of Dorchester, were, for skylful causes, depryued of their croyses & rynges, he, by his fauoure and meanes, restored theym to theyr former dignyties. The cause of Thomas was for that he had holpen duke Wyllyam towarde his iourney into Englande, for the whiche, the sayd duke promyssed hym a bysshopryche ifheopteyned victory; and the other was pryued, for that he was proued a prestes sone. Thanne Thomas moued the cause of the prymacy of Caunterbury, & of subieccion that to hym shuld belonge ; & Dispuuu* sayd that those, ii. sees were farre asonder, that is to meane, Caunterbury & Yorke, and that nother of theym, by the constytucions of Gregory, shuld be subiecte Vnto other, but that the one is more worthy than the other, for somoche as he is of elder tyme. To this answere Lamfranke sayd*, y the Constitucions of Gregory made no mention of Caunterbury, but of Yorke and London. Than f pope1 remytted this matyer to be determyned before the kynge and the bysshoppes of Englande, and gaue the palle vnto Lamfrank ; but for this terme or worde palle is to many one vnknowen, I shall therfore here shewe vnto you what thyngeit is. This palle is an indument that euery archebysshop must haue, and is nat in full aucto ritie of an archhebysshop tyll he haue receyued his palle [of the pope,]* and is a thynge of whyte tyke to the bredeth of a stole ; but it is of an other fassion ; for where the stole is made in length, and is worne about the preestes necke, this is ioyned togyder aboue, so that it lyeth a parte therof vpon the shulders, and that one ende hangeth streyght downe to the grounde before, and that other behynde, gamysshed in dyuers places therof w crosses : and where the stole is worne nexte vnto the albe, whan the preest is reuestred to masse, this palle is worne vpon this vestyment, ouermest of all, whan an archebys shoppe syngeth his masse. Whan Lamfranke had thus sped his nedys at Rome, he, with the other, ii. bysshoppes, Diyitatio retoumed into Englande, where this matyer hangynge in varyaunce atwene y sayd. ii. cPlscoP\u00b0\u2122m' archebysshoppes, was had in comunycacion ; for tryall wherof Bedaes story was brought forthe, wherin it appered, that from the firste Augustynes tyme to Bedaes laste dayes, vpon the season of. C.xxxix. yeres, the archebysshop of Caunterbury had prymacy of all the bysshoppes of England, than called Brytayne, and of Irelande also : and that the archebysshoppes of Caunterbury had kept counsaylles neuer5 vnto Yorke, and cleped therunto the bysshoppes of Yorke, and made some bysshoppes, [and punysshed some bysshoppes of Yorke,]6 and depryued dyuers from theyr dignyties: & to this were ad ioyned certayn priuyleges y were grauted for this maner of doyng. Whan Thomas had harde all the alegacions, he denyed all, and layde for hym the pistle, in the which pope Gregory7 demed that f churche of Yorke and of London shuld be euyn perys, & ncyther of theym subgette to other. To this was answered by Lamfrank, that he was nat bysshop of London, nor this questyon was nat moued for the churche of London. But Thomas sayd that Gregory had graunted to Atigustyne power to haue vnder hym all the bysshoppes of Englande, and that London, at that daye, was the pryncypall see of all Englande.

And though Augustyne chaunged that see from London to Cauterbury, yet Gregory wolde' that Augustyne successours shuld be aboue the bysshoppes of Yorke. He wolde than haue sette in his epistle thyse wordes folowyng : \"I graute toy Augustyne, & to thy successours ;\" but for he wolde y no such power shuld stretche to his successours, therfore he made no mencyon of his successours. Lamfranke to this answered and sayd, if that auctoritie were graunted to Augustyne alone & nat to his suecessours, it was a symple gyfte that the pope1 gaue vnto Augustyne that was so famylyer with hym; and namely, whyle Augustyne ordeyned nor sacrede no bysshop of Yorke whyle he lyued, for that see was full duryng his lyfe : by reason wherof, he put nat his auctorite in execucion. But pryuyleges of popes1 cbfermeth this dignytie to Augustynes succes sours of Caunterbury, \"& demeth that it is skyll and good reason that all the churches of Englande shuld take lore and lyght of that place, [for of that welle or place proceded first y doctryne of Cristes sayth. And where thou sayest, Thomas, that Gregory myght, if he had wold, haue cofirmed all thinge vndowtably with this worde \" Successours,\" that is sothe ; but yet the lackynge of this worde dothe no preiudyce to the churche of Caunterbury : for whan that Criste sayd to Peter, \" I shal gyue to the the keyes of the kyngdome of heuyn,\" he myght haue also said if he wolde, \" I graunt the same power to thy successours ;\" and thoughe he sayd nat so, yet he mente the successours of Peter.

And if thou can discerne bytwene false & soth, loke what hath strength &* all, hath strengthe in the partie ; and what hath strengthe in the more, hathe also strength in y lasse. Than to certyfye ihis reason is as it were5 all of all churches, & other churches been as membres therof: lyke as one man is kynde6 of all synguler men, & in euery synguler man is y kynde of all mankynde ; so in some maner of wyse, the churche and the see of Rome is, as it were, the kynde, and conteyneth all in comparison to other churches : and yet in euery churche remayneth the full holynesse of Cristes sayth. And also the Churche of Rome in7 grettest of al churches : and what hath strength in y churche shall haue strengthe in lasse churches : so that the power, that is first gyuen to euery churche, shall sprynge into the successours of the same ; but if8 by specyall thynge be excepted and out taken : therfore I coclude, as Criste said to Peter, so he sayd to all the bysshoppes of Rome, and so consequently was sayde to Augustynes successours, of Gregory, as was sayd vnto Augustyne. Wherfore it muste apere, that lyke as Caunterbury is subgette to Rome, so muste Yorke be subgette to Caunterbury, whiche sent to Yorke prechoures to teche and preche vnto theym the ryght sayth. And where thou sayest that Gregory wolde that Augustyne shulde haue his see at Lodon, it may nat stande with reason : for who wolde trowe y so noble a disciple as Augustyne was, wolde withstande or do agayne his maisters wyll, or agayne holy decrees ; and if it were so as thou haste alleged, what is y to me, that am nat bysshop of London, as eft before I haue sayd ?

He was so couetous and so euyll disposed, y he wolde leuye. iii. taskys for two ; he pylled the ryche & bare downe the poore, and caused many men to lose theyr londis for small causes : therfore the kynge had hym in his synguler fa . uoure, and by his meanes bysshopryches were boughte and solde, as playnlye as other mar chaundyses. For that tyme clerkes vsed busshed and brayded hedys, longe tayled and blasynge clothes, shynynge golden gyrdellys, & rode with gylte spurres, with vsynge of dyuerse other enormytecs, all whiche vyces Anselme wolde haue corrected, but he lacked assys tece of his bretherne the bysshoppis, for the whiche cause & other, he departed the lode : wherewith the kyng beynge mysse contented, sent after hym such persones as robbed and spoyled hym, and entreted hym I moost cruell maner. For the which dede, Raufe, bisshop of Chichestre, blamed y kyng, and also rebuked all suche bisshoppys as had re- fused the partye of Anselme, & had fauored the kynge in causes concernynge the fore- sayde variauce : and farthermore he withstode the kynge & his officers, in takynge of fynes of preestis for cryme of fornycacion. For which causes, the kynge with y sayde Raufe, was sore amoued and discontented, and opteyned such fauoure, that he suspended many churches of his dyoses; but in y ende, Raufe demeaned hym I such wyse, that he had his owne wyll, & his churches enlarged & freed, that before were stopped w thornys, & the kyng gaue vnto hym the fynes of preestys within his dioses, & endued the see of Chichester with many great gyftes. Vpon* a tyme, kynge Wyllyam was rydynge towarde his disporte of hutynge, &sodenly amessynger came vnto hym & sayde, that the cytie of Cenemonya, in Normandye, was besyeged ; wherefore he without longe taryingeor aduysement, toke the streyght way to the see syde, and sent to his lordis chargynge them to folowe. Whan the sayd lordes came to his presence, they aduysed hym to tarye tyll his people were assemblyd ; but he wolde nothynge doo after theyr cou- sayll, but sayde, suche as hym loued he shortly wiste wdle wolde folowe hym, & so yode to shyppe.

And so he passed the see, & londed in Normandy, & gathered to hym ther his knyghtes.

Whan Lewys vnderstode y kynge Henry was londed in Normandy with so great power, he in all haste assembled a stronge power, & drewe hym towarde the kyng ; but there were so stronge holdes mannyd with Normans, & also suche depe & great ryuers, that the Frenshe kynge myght not wynne vnto kynge Henry.

This, of wryters, was reputed for a blessyd & holy woman, after the lyuynge of a worldly woma.

Whereof whan the kynge was enfourmed, he was passynge greuously discotent; wherefore in all haste he sped hym thyther, & compassed the casteil with a stronge syege, & those that were within defended them manfully.

In processe of tyme after, at a place called the Roche of Guy, whiche one Guy of olde tyme had buylded, dwellyd at this day one of y stocke, named also Guy; the whiche had to wyfe a fayre & good woma, the doughter of one Wyllyam, a Norman, which Wyllyam entendynge to dyseryte the sayd Guy, and to be lorde of that stroge place, vpon a tyme whan y- sayd Guy was in the churche, or cha- pell, to here his deuyne seruyce, entred the churche, with a serteyn of harnessed knyghtes vnder theyr mantelles, & fell vpon hym, and all to hewe hym : whereof herynge, the wyfe ran as a madde woma, and fell vpon her husbdde, to the entent to saue hym frome the strokys; but the tyrauntes were so cruell, that they sorbare no thynge of theyr cruel- tye, but wouded her with her husbonde, so that both were slayne, and that done, entred the casteil, and slewe all suche as they founde therm. Whan this Wyllyam, fader to y wyfe of Guy, or brother to her, as affermeth master Robert Gagwyne, was thus pos- sessed of y casteil of Guyo, he thought therby to rule all the countrey enuyron. But the gentyllys & commonnis, herynge of this mooste shamefull murder, assembled them togy- der, & of one mynde, whyle some of them yode to the kynge, to enfourme hym of y cruel dede, the other prepared abyllemetes of warre, & layde siege to the sayd casteil.

Whan the kynge wasenfourmed of y garnysshynge of the castle of Thorre, and of the dishobedyence of Hugh, he assembled a stronge hooste, and compassed the casteil of Puyssake \\v a siege, and set Thybaude, sone of the coutesse, vpon that syde that stoode towarde the prouynce of Charters; soy stronge assautys & cruell warre was made on euery parte.

Than the kynge caste downe the sayd casteil of Puysake to the grounde, excepte a lytle towre made of tyrnber, the which he reserued for a lodgynge ; and that done, some of the foresayde prysoners he put to deth, and some he dishereted, aster y grefe of theyr offense : & so this foresayd countesse of Charters, with her sone Thibaude, was in quyet of theyr countrey 8c casteil of Puyssake, belongynge to y sayd eriedome.

For this a grudge fell atwene the kynge and erle Thibaude, so that, in processe, dedely warre was made atwene them ; the whiche contynued in suche wyse to theyr bothe da mages, that fynally the warre that was agayne reuyued atwene this kyng Lewys & kyng Henry, as in the. xvii. yere of the reygne of the sayde Henry is declared, was by meane of this warre atwene the kynge and this erle Thibaude, whereof the syrcustaunce wolde axe a longe leysour &' reherce, as it is shewyd in the Frensh story.

It was not longe after that kynge Richarde was thos departed, but that kyng Phylyp, callynge to mynde the great losse Sc dishonour 'that he had resayuyd by that warre of kyng Richard, assembled a great army, and entryd the duchy of Normandy, and wasted the countrey, from Nuesbourth to Beawmont le Rogier ; and that done, he retornyd into Fraunce, and lycencyd his knyghtes to goo eche man into his owne countrey. Whan kynge Phylyp had thus fynysshed his warre in Normendy, kyng Richarde then, with his army, entryd the fore named countrey of Vnequecin, 8c also Beawnoyson2, and toke within them, as he before had done, ryche and many prayes, and with them departyd ; whom the bishop of Beawuays, beynge a good knyght and hardy of his handis, with a company of knyghtes and other, folowyd, to haue rescowyd the prysoners that kynge Richarde had takyn5, and acertayn of his company slayne. Then the erle of Flaunders, by the ayde of the En glysshemen, tooke the towne of seynt Omer from the Frenshe men. In this season, In nocent the pope*, before namyd, sent a legat into Fraunce, named Peter de Capis, to refourme the warre atwene these, ii. pryncis, the which, at that tyme, was in suche dis joynte, that he cowde not brynge it to any frame, and specyally, as sayth the Frenshe boke, because kynge Rycharde wolde not delyuer hostagys & gagis, as the Frenshe kynge wolde. Then kynge Rycharde, after Cristmas, besyegyd a casteil nere vnto Lymoges : this casteil, in the Frenshe Cronycle, is called Chalons, and in the Englysshe boke, it is named Gaillarde. The cause of this siege, as sayth most wryters, was for certayne ryche treasour foundyn within the lordeshyp, or sygnory, of kynge Rycharde ; the which one Wydomer, Vycount of Lemonke, had founden and with helde from kynge Richarde, and for his sauegarde fledde vnto the fore named casteil, and defendyd it manfully from the fyrste weke of Lent, tyll the. vi. day of Aprell : vpon the which day, kynge Rycharde, Walkyng vnwysely about the casteil to espye the feblenes therof, one named Bertrande Guedon, markyd the kynge, & woundyd hym in the hede, or after some wryters, in the arme, with a venemus quarell : aster which wound resauyd by the kynge, he comaundyd sharpe assaute to be made, in the whiche assaute the casteil was wonne. Than he made enquery who it was that so had woundid hym, the which was brought vnto the kinges presence, and named hym seise as aboue is sayde, or aster some wryters, Peter Basyle. Then the kynge demaundid of hym, why he shuld so lye in a wayte to hurt hym, rather than any of his felowes? \" For thou slew- my father and my bretherne5,\" sayde he, \" wherfore I entendyd to auenge theyr deth, what someuer became of me.\" Then the kynge forgaue hym his oifence, Sc sufferyd hym to goo at his lybertie, and the other of the souldvours takyn in that casteil, the kyng comaundyd to be hanged; but Polycronycon sayth, that after kynge Richarde was' dede, the duke of Braban, which than was present, causyd the sayd Bartrand to be takyn and flayne quycke Sc after hanged. Than kynge Richard dyed the. iii. day after, that is to say, the. ix. day of Aprell, and was buryed at Font Eborard, at the fete of his father; howe be it some wryters saye, that his hart was buryed at Roan, bis body as before is sayde, and his bowellys at Carleyll in Englande, when he had reygned. ix. yeres. ix. monthes and odde \"dayes, leuyng aster hym none issue.

I haue rehersed the more of this Cronycle of Fraunce, to theentent that the reders may wele apperceyue the pryde and boost5 of the Frenshe men ; for in all theyr wrytynge, when they come to any mater that soundyth any thynge to theyr honour, it is wrytten in the lengest and mooste shewynge manoure to theyr honoure and worshyp. But as I haue sayde before, in the. v. Chapytre of the story of the. ii.

In this yere also vnkyndenesse beganne to growe atwene the Londoners and the constable of the Toure ; for that he, cotrary the lybertye of the cytie, toke certayne shyppes passyng by the Toure with whete and other vytayll, and toke it into the sayd Toure, makynge the pryce at his pleasure ; wherfore great harme had ensued, had nat been the polyce of wyse men, which shewed vnto y kynges coun- sayll, by whose direction the matyer was comytted vnto syr Philip Basset, thenne chief iustyce, and other, to sette an order and rule atwene y said parties.

In this yere also many murmures & grudges were tolde in many places of the lande, sup- posyng that warre shuld, in short processe, haue ensued atwene the kynge & his lordes, for the bull of dispensacion before in that other yere shewed ; but by helpe and mediacion of good and wyse men, thise murmurres and grudges were so appeased, that the kynge agreed agayne to the mayntenauce of the sayd statutes, & sent his wrytles, wherin the sayd articles were comprysed, into all shyres of Englande, gyuynge streyght comaundement to all men to obserue & kepe y same, & suche other as were to theym ioyned by y discressyobof the erle marshall, the erle of Leycetour, syr Philip Basset, syr Hugh Bigot, & other : \u00a3 which shortly after"], [387, "4J40 SEPTIMA PARS HENRICI TERTII. after was reuoked' & denyed.

Thene, vpon Mydlent Sondaye, the mayre and the comons beynge present, at a folkmote holden at Paulys crosse before sir Philyp Basset and other of the kynges cou sayll, the mayre was sworne to be trewe to the kynge, and to his heyres kynges; and vpon the morowe at Guyldehalle, euery alderman in presence of the mayre toke the same othe : and vpon y Sondaye folowynge euery strypelyng of the age of. xii. yeres and aboue, before his alderman in his warde, was new-ely charged with the same othe. Thane the displeasure atwene the kynge 8c his barons began to appere and disclose, whiche longe whyle had ben kept secret; in somoche that dyuers of them assembled in the marches of Walys, and gaderyd vnto theym stronge power, and sente a letter vnto the kyng vnder the seale of syr Rogyer Clyfforde, besechynge hym to haue in remembraunce that othe & manyfolde promesse that he had made for the obseruynge of the statutes, made at his towne of Oxenforde, with other ordenaunces made to the honoure of God, for sayth and allegeauce to his persone, and weale and profyte of all his realme : wyllyng hym far ther to withstande and defye all suche persones as wylbe agayne the sayd actes, sauynge the quene & hyr childrene. After the which letter thus sent, and, receyuynge of it, none answere had, the sayd ba rons w baner displayed, went agayne such as they knewe that helde agayne the sayd actes : and firste at Herforde, they toke the bysshop of that see, & as many of his chanons as were alyauntes borne, and toke suche treasoure and catell as they there fande, and bare it with theym, and after yode & sent vnto suche maners as the sayd bysshop and chanons had, and theym spoyled and robbed, and some of theym threwe to the grounde, & con sumed with fyre, and put the sayd bysshop and chanons in suer kepynge, and sette other in their places ; and after went vnto y- other costes, where they supposed to fynde of theyr enemyes, kepynge theyr course towarde London, berynge before theym baner of the kynges armys : and so holdynge their iourney, moche people drewe vnto them. In which progresse, euer as they fande any that they knewe to be agayn the mayntenauce of the sayd actes, they enprysoned theym, & spoyled their places, were they spiritual men or tem porall men ; & in dyuers of the kynges castelles, they sette in suche persones as to theym lyked, and put out suche as there were sette in by the kynge, and gaue vnto them an othe that they shuld be trewe and faythfull to the kynge, and kepe those castelles to his vse & weale of the realme. Aboute Midsomer, when they drewe nere to London, they sent a letter vnto the mayre and aldermen, vnder the seale of syr Symonde Mounforde, wyllynge to knowe of theym whether they wolde obserue the actes and statutes made in the parlyamet of Oxenforde, or nat ; or ellys they wolde ayde and assyst suche persones as entended y breche of the same, and sent vnto theym a copye of the sayd actes, with a prouyso that if any that there were specifyed were to the hurte of f realme or comon weale of the same, that they than, by discrete persones of the lande, shuld be altered & amended : the whiche copye the mayre bare vnto the kynge, then beynge at y Toure accompanyed with f quene, the kyng of Almayne, whiche lately was retoumed from beyonde y see, & sir Ed^ warde his sone, with other of his counsayll.

Than shortly aster, for so moch as dyuerse noble men of the lande whiche helde agayne those statutes were ryden towarde Douer, and there entended to haue taken shyppynge for fere of the barons ; the kynge sent after theym dyuers persones of his housholde, and of the cytezyns of London, to refourme and enduce theym to retourne, and to tary with y kynge : and in that season, all alyauntes, the whiche were taken sus- pect of any fauour owynge to y one partie or to y other, were auoyded the cytie ; but it was nat longe aster that syr Edwarde the kynges sone, set them or many of theym in of- fyces within the casteil of Wyndesore.

After whiche sentence thus gyuen, y kynge retoumed into Englande, so that he came to Lodon the Xv. day of Februarii ; but y barons beyng sore amoued w this sentece, & notyng great parcialitie vnto y Frenshe kyng, departed from London westwarde, & so into y marchys of Walys; where they drewe to them great power, and warred vpon the landes & cas telles of sir Roger Mortymer, & threwe some of them vnto y\" groude, & spoyled of his what they might fynde, Sc ouer y brent of his manours Sc houses : in w hose ayde, sir Ed warde the kynges sone comyng, his people were distressed, Sc he almost taken. For redresse of whiche maters, a newe parliament was appoynted to be holden at Oxenforde, in the qurdena of Easter next folowing, which came neuer to effect. Albeit an other Cronycle sayth, that frome this parlyamet than holden at Oxenforde, the kynge & his lordes parted all discorded. Than the barons dreue towarde London, and the kynge remayned at Wood stok. And thenne new assuraunce by wrytynge endented, was made atwene the comi naltie of the cytie and the barons, without consent of many of the rulers of the sayd cytie : wherfore the comons, as men enraged, made of them self. ii. capytaynes, whiche they named constables of the cytie, that is to say, Thomas de Pyweldon, & Stephan Bukerell ; at whose comaundement, by tollyng of the great belle of Paules, all the cytie shuld be redy shortly I harneys, to gyue attendance vpon theyr sayd capytaynes. Aboute the begyiinyng of Lent, the constable of y Toure, sir Hughe le Spenser, came with a fayre company of men of armys' before hym into the cytie, & desyred assystence of the fore named constables, the which comauded the sayd belle to be tolled j by meane wherof the people shyt theyr shoppes, & came out in harneys in great multytude. The whiche, after proclamation made that they shuld folowe theyr capytaynes, wout knowlege what to do or whether to go, folowed theyr sayd capytaynes, & so yode vnto Thystilworth, vpon. ii. myles beyoirde Westmynster, & there spoyled the manou'r of the kynge of Ro mayns, & sette it after vpon a fyre : and y done, his water mylles and other comodytees that he there had, put theym to vtter ruyne ; and lister with great noyse Sc eiye retoumed vnto London.

And soone after the lewys were thus punysshed, many houses of religion within the cytie and nere there aboute, were serched for goodes of alyautes, and moche founde; wherof a parte was brought vnto y lordes, but y more part was stolen & brybed. In whiche season, the kynge passed by dyuers counties, and lastely came into Southsex with a stronge power ; wherof herynge, y lordes made preparacyon to go towardes hym.

In whiche meane tyme, the erle with his company made bulwerkes and barbycanys atwene the Toure and the cytie, and caste dykes & trenches in some places of the cytie, and fortyfyed it wonderously. Then many of the cytezeyns, ferynge a newe insurreccion, voyded the cytie as secrete ly as they myght, whose goodes the erle seased to his owne vse, or suffred his men to spoyle theym at theyr pleasure.

Then y kynges hoost made dayly assautes vpon the cytie, and gunnes & other ordynauces was shotte into the cytie, whiche lytell or no thyng hurte the towne, it was so strongly for tyfied. In this season the legat vpon his partye, and the kynge of Romayns vpon y other par tie, for allyaunce that was atwene hym and y erle of Glouceter, laboured so to the kynge that a reformacon of peas was spoken of; durynge whiche treaty, the souldyourrs Jyinge in Southwerke made many robboryes in Southerey and other places, & rowed ouer to West mynster, and spoyled there the kynges palays, and deuoured his wyne, 8c breke the glasse of the wyndowes, and all other necessaryes to that palayes they distroyed and wasted ; and somtymes came in lykewyse into London, and robbed there also.

Whan the Cristen host were comyn nere vnto the porte of Damasse, the kynge caused theim to be shypped in small vesselles, and so in ordre, to sayle or rowe towarde the cytie ; but the Sarazeyns beynge ware of theyr comynge, issued out of the cytie, and defended y porte vigorously: so that many a Cristen man was slayne at that recounter. But in the ende the discomfitur tourned vpon the Sarazeyns, for the chief capytayne of the towne, with. ii. admyralles, were there slayne, and many of theyr knyghtes. Then they gaue backe vnto y towne, and suffered the Cristen to lande. The kynge then pyght his pauylyons, and strengthed his felde, for sodayne brekynge out of the Turkes; and so restyd hym and his people the Sonday St Monday folowynge. As faste as f Cristen made prouycion to ordre for their suer lyeng in the felde, so fast the Turkes win the towne made purueyaunce, to conuey suche goodes as they myght out of the cytie; and lastly, sette the houses on fyre, and voyded vnknowynge to the Cristen hoOst. Anone as the flambe of the fyre appered, the Cristen men without resystence, entred the cytie and quenched y fyre, and after possessyd the cytie.

Then the temples and sinagoges of the cy tie were hallowed, and occupyed to Cristen mennes vse : and there y kynge with his boost restyd hym tyll the moneth of Noueber folowynge, in y whiche season came vnto hy the erle of Poytiers, with a fayre company.

In the. v. yere of the sayd Phylyp all the lazaris of the coutrey of Langadocke were brent, for so moche as they were accusyd of theyr owne consessyon prouyd, that they had poysonyd, and entendyd to haue poysoned all the wellys of that countrey; & for many lewys were vnto theym consentynge, therefore many of them suf feryd lyke iugemet.

About the myddell of August, the duke sent for the prouoste & Charlys Cusake with Iohh de la Ile, the which bare the pryncypall rule within the cytie, and also were great sayers & doers in the assembles of y. iii. astatys, & had taken vpo them moche rule in that busynesse, so that moche of y busynes was rulyd by the & theyr meanys ; to whom the duke gaue strayght comaundemet that they shulde cease of theyr auctoryties, and not to deale any more with the rule of y realme, but onely to y- good ruse and gouem auce of the cytie of Parys : & that done the duke rode aboute vnto dyuerse good townys and made requeste vnto them for ayde, and also to haue the money to be curraut amonge them, whiche as before is shewyd the. x. daye of Decembre, were at Parys proclaymed ; but he sped lytle of his purpose. In this meane whyle the cytezyns of Parys, [of one wylle and mynde, offeryd before seynt Remyge a taper of waxe of wonderfoll lengthe and greatnesse, the whych they ordeyned to brenne day and nyght whyle it wolde laste: & shortlye after they]' sent vnto the duke so plesaunt message, that he retournyd agayn vnto the cytie, whom they receyued \\V all honoure and reuerence. And vpon y morowe aster his retourne, the prouost with certayne other of the cytie, shewyd vnto the duke that they wolde make a great shyste for hym towarde the mayntenaunce of his warrys, and to brynge that mater to good conclusyon, they besought hym that he wolde assemble at Parys, shortly, a certayne personys of. xx. or. xxx. good townys there nexte adioynaunt, the whiche was vnto them grauted; so that shortlye after there asseblyd at Parys vpon. lxx. personys, the which helde theyr counceyll to gether by sundry dayes : howe be it in the ende they shewyd vnto the duke, that nothynge they myght brynge to effecte without assemble of the. iii. astatys, & besoughte hym that they myght be else reasseblyd, trust ynge that by theyr presence the dukys mynde shulde be content and satysfyed. Vpo which requeste, the duke sent his comyssyons, chargynge the sayd. iii. astatys to apere before hym at Parys, the Wednysday nexte folowynge y day of All Sayntys, and full fayne he was to do all thynge that the cytezyns of Parys hym requyred to do; for, as tes tyfyeth the Frenshe Cronycle, he was so bare of money that he had not suftycyent to de fende his cotidian charge. IN the viii. yere of kynge Iohn and Wednysday after Albalowen day, the. iii. astatys reasseblyd at Parys, and helde theyr counceyll within the Blacke Freris, duryn\u00abe which couceyll the kyng of Nauerne that longe had ben holden in pryson win the casteil of Alleux, was delyueryd by the meanys of syr Iohn Pyquygny, than gouernoure of the countrey of Arthoys, and after conueyed by the sayde Iohh vnto the towne of Amyas. Wha the kynge of Nauerne was thus set at large, anon his syster and other of his frendys made meanys vnto the duke of Normandye for an vnyte and a peace to be had atwene theym, and by them a mean was fotiden that the kyng with such as were in his company shuld come vnder safe conduyt to Parys to comon with the duke. Whan dyuerse of the. iii. astatys, as suche as were of Chapeyne and Burgoyne, knewe of the commyncre of the kynge of Nauerne vnto Parys, they without leue takyng departyd ; and vpon the euyn of seynt Andrew the sayde kynge entryd Parys with a great copany of men of armys, amoo-e the which was y bysshop of Parys, w many other of the sayd cytie.

Than it was agreed that vpon the Saterdaye folowynge, the kynge and the duke, whiche as yet had not spoken together, shulde mete at the place of the syster of the sayd kynge, where they mette with vnsrendely countenance, & after they had comyned there a longe season departyd with lytle loue or charyte ; and vpon the Monday folowynge were shewyd vnto the duke & his counceyle certeyne requestys desyred by the kyng of Nauerne, the which the duke was forsyd to graunt, whereof the substaunce was that the kynge shuld haue agayne and enioye all suche ladys, castellys, and townys, with all mouables to them belogynge, as be was in possessyon of the daye that kynge Iohh was takyn within the casteil of Roan, and ouer that he shulde be pardonyd of all offencys by hym done agayne the crowne of Fraunce before that daye, and all other his adherentys or suche as had takyn his partye before that tyme. And soone vpon this was ordeynyd that the erle of Harcourte and other, whiche kynge Iohn hadde causyd to be behedyd & after to be hangyd vpon the comon gibet of Roan, shuld be delyuered vnto theyr freendys to be buryed at theyr pleasures. After which conclusyons takyn, and assurauncys made, as farre as the dukys auctoryte wolde extede vnto, syr Almary Menlene*, knyght, with. iii. or. iiii. men of honoure moo were sent into Normandye to repossesse the kynge of Nauerne in all suche landys, castellys, and townes as he before tyme was in possessyon of, with all mouables vnto the sayd ladys apperteynynge; and then the sayd kynge and duke helde famylyer company, & dyned & sowpyd together often sythes at f manoir or lodgynge of quene Iohan, syster vnto the sayd kynge, & other placys : also the sayde kynge delyuered out of prysone all prysoners as well spyrytuell as laye, suche as were thought any thyng fauourable vnto his cause, among the which some there were that for theyr demerytys were adiugyd to perpetuall prysone. In this tyme & season tydynges sprange within the cytye of Parys y the kynges of Englade and of Frauce were agreed, & that kyng Iohn shuld shortly returne into Frauce. By reason of whyche tydynges, the kyng of Nauerne made the more haste to dyspache hym out of Paris, so that he with his copany departyd from Parys y. xx. daye of December, k rode towarde the cytie of Maunte in Normandy. Soone after the kynge was thus departyd, dyuerse enemyes to y noubre of. x. or. xii.C. came within, iiii. or. v. mylys of Parys, whiche were demyd to be of the copany of syr Phylyp brother vnto the kynge of Nauerne : theyse robbyd Sc pylled the countrey thereabouts in so moche that the people of the countrey of Preauxand Trappys, and other there about, were costraynyd with theyr mouables to flee vnto Parys. Wher fore the duke sent out his letters and comyssyons for to assemble his knyghtys to withstade the sayde enemyes ; but the sayde cytezyns of Parys caste an other way, and thought it to be done to the greuauce or correccyon of theym : for dowte whereof the prouost with other that had the gouernauce of the cytie, causyd the gatys to be kepte, & none shulde entre but such as lyked theym. In this passe tyme the kynge of Nauerne beynge in Normandye, requyred delyueree of the castellys of Bretnell, of Enroux, & other, f which to hym by the capitaynys were denyed.

This also was one of the chefe rulers of the assemble of j. iii. astatis, and after lefte them, & fell by his great dowble nesse & dyssymylacyon in the dukis fauoure, and so became chefe of his counceyll, for the whiche of the comon people he was named the beste with. ii. mouthes. The the cytezyns of Parys herynge of the denayinge of the sayd castellys vnto the kynge, knewe well that mortall warre shuld growe atwene hym and the duke, and for they wolde haue the cytezyns knowen from other straugers, therfore they ordeyned them hodys partyd of rede and' blewe, chargynge euery man that he shuld not passe his lodgynge without that hood and conysaunce. Vpon the. viii. daye of Ianuarii the kyng of Nauerne entryd the cytie of Roan with a great c5pany of men of armys, and drewe vnto hym many En glysshemen, & suche as were enemyes vnto the Frenshe kyng ; and vpon the. xii. daye of Ianuarii the sayde kynge assemblyd the people of that cytie, and made a lyke sermon vnto theym as before he had done vnto y comynaltye of Parys, & dyd a solempne obsequy to be done for the erle of Harcourt and the other with hym put to deth, as aboue is sayd, by kynge Iohh. In this whyle the duke of Normandy, y longe whyle had taryed in Parys I hope & ayde of y cytezyns, & was euyr by the prouoste & other dryuen of from daye to daye, it was aduysyd hym by hys counceyll y he shulde shewe his mynde vnto the co mynaltye of the cytye : wherof when y bysshop of Laon and y prouost were ware, anon they shewyd vnto hym many doughtys and impedymentys, Sc also parellys for to treate vV a comynaltye.

Vpon the morowe, beynge Frydaye k. xii. day of Ianuarii, f prouost and other of his affynyte herynge of the fauoure that many of y edmons bare vnto the duke, and ferynge lest the duke shuld by his1, meanys turne the comons vpon theym, assemblyd a great parte of the cytie at a place callyd seynt Iamys hospytall, and specyallye such as they knewe welt fauoured theyr partye. Whan the duke was ware of y assemble, anon he sped hym thyther, hauynge with hym the bysshop of Laon, where by the moufh of his chaunceller he causyd to be shewyd a parte of the mater whiche he hymselfe had shewyd the daye before vnto the comynaltye, with more that where as such as ought vnto hym no good wylle, reportyd hym that he kept not promyse made with y kyng of Nauerne, he shewyd there the contrary, & if any thynge were not to hym parfourmyd, it was contrary to his mynde and pleasure, and that that I his power lay not to fulfyll. And so soone as the chaueeller hadde endyd his tale, Charlys Cusake stode vp to the entente to haue shewyd his mynde, but there was suche a rumoure and noyse amonge y people, that he myght not be harde, so that than the duke partyd2, with suche companye as he broughte, excepte the bysshop of Laon which taryed there with the prouost and other : and whit the duke was * this. edit. 1559. * departid.

After whiche processe endyd by the sayde Iohn, Charlys Cusake agayne began to speke, and made a longe comedacion of the prouydece and good dysposycion of the prouoste, which had takyn vpon hym great peyne and dyspleasure, and spent largely of his owne for the comon weale of the cytie ; wherfore if he myght knowe that the comyn altie wolde not ayde and stande by hym for the furtheraunce of the same, he wolde be content to leue of and gete hym there as he shuld be quyte of all trowble, and also out of the daunger of all his enemyes : whereunto was anon made a great exclamacyon by the people, sayinge they wolde lyue and dye with hym in that quarell. VPon the. xiii. day of Ianuary y duke sent for dyuerse personys of the. iii. astatys, and exortyd them by goodlye and amyable wordis y they wolde demeane theym agayne his father and hym as feythfull & louynge subiectys, & he shulde so reporte them vnto the kynge that they of hym shulde haue great thankys; and as touchynge hymselfe, he wolde be so good lorde vnto them y they shuld thynke theyr kyndenesse and fydelyte well be stowed : the which graunted vnto hym theyr trothe and seruyce to y vttermoste of theyr powars, aduysynge hym to take vpo hym the gouernauce of the realme, for they thought he taryed to longe or he toke y rule thereof.

Of whiche offence to be gyltie, they accusyd the foresayd duke of Suffolke, the lorde Saye, the bysshop of Salisbury, and one Danyell a gentylman, w Treuylyan and other. Than to appease the comon hous, the duke was exiled for. v. yeres, and the lorde Saye, as tresorer of England, and the other were put apart for a whyle, & were promysed to be sent vnto the kynges gayoll or warde. Than the duke, in obeying the sentence foresayd, sped hym towarde y sees syde in y moneth of Apryll, and toke his shyppynge in Norsolke, entendyng to haue sayled into Fraunce.

Than the kynge, aster the sayd rebellys had holden theyr felde vpon Blak Heth. vii. dayes, made towarde theym. Wherof herynge, the capitayne drewe backe w his people to a vyllage called Seuenok, and there enbataylled. Then it was agreed by the kynges counsayl, that sir Hunfrey Stafforde, knyght, with Wyllyam his brother, and other certayne gentylmen, shulde folowe the chase, and the kynge with his lordes shulde retourne vnto Grenewyche, wenynge to theym that the re bellys were fledde and gone. But as before I haue shewyd, whefie sir Humfrey with his company drewe nere vnto Seuenok, he was warnyd of the capitayne y there abode with his people.

But fynally, whan worde came of the ouerthrowe of the Staffbrdes, they sayd playnly boldly\", that except the lorde Saye and other before reherced were comytted to warde, they wolde take the capitaynes partye. For the appeasynge of whiche rumour, the lorde Saye was put into y Tower ; but that other as then were nat at hande. Then y kynge hauynge knowlege of the scomfyture of his men, and also of y rumour of his osteyng people, remouyd frome Grenewyche to London, and there with his hoost restyd hym a whyle. And so soon as Iak Cade had thus ouer comyn the Staffordes, he anone apparaylled hy with the knyghtes apparayll, and dyd on hym his bryganders set with gylt nayle, and his salet and gylt sporis ; and after he had refresshid his people, he retoumed agayne to Blak Heth, & there pyght agayne his felde, as here tofore he had done, & laye there from the. xxix. daye of Iuny, beynge seynt Peters day, tyll the firste day of Iuly. In whiche season came vnto hy the archebysshop of Caunterbury, and the duke of Bukkyngham, with whom they had longe comunycacion, and fande hym right discrete in his answerys: how be it they coude nat cause hym to lay downe his people, and to submyt hym vnto f kynges grace. In this whyle, the kynge and the quene herynge of the encreasynge of his rebellys, and also the lordes ferynge theyr owne seruauntes, lest they wolde take the capitaynes partye, remoued from Lotion to Kyllyngworth, leuynge the cytie without ayde, except oonlv the lorde Scalys, whiche was left to kepe the Tower, and with hym a manly and warly man named Mathewe Gowth1. Thafie the capitayne of Kent thus houynge at Blakheth, to y ende to blynde the more the people', and to bryng hym in fame that he kept \"ood iustyce, behedyd there a pety capitayne of his named Parys, for somoche as he had offendyd agayne such ordnauce as he had stablisshed in his hoste.

For which cause, or for he hadde fauouryd the lorde Saye, by reason f he hadde maryed his doughter, he was haryed to Myles Ende, and there, in the capitaynes presence, byhedyd. And the same tyme was there also behedyd an other man, called Baylly, the cause of whose dethe was this, as I haue berde some men reporte. Then' Baylly was of the famylyer & olde acquayntaunce of Iak Cade, wherfore so soon as he espyed hym comynge to hym warde, he caste in his mynde that he wolde dyscouer his lyuynge & olde maners and shewe of his vyle kynne and lynage.

Thus chtynuynge this cruell fyght, to y distruccion of moche people on both sydes, lastly, after the Kentysshme put' to y worse, a trewe was agreed for certayne houres; durynge y which trew, y archebysshop of Cauterbury, than chauceller of Englade, sent a generall pardon to y capitayn for hymselfe, and an other for his people : by reason wherof he and his company departyd the same nyght out of Southwarke, and so retoumed euery ma to his owne. But it was nat longe after that y capitayne w his company was thus departed, that proclamacons were made in dyuers places of Kent, of Southsex, & Sowtherey, that who myght take f foresayd Iak Cade, other on lyue or dede, shuld haue a.

Wha this was knowen vnto the duke of Yorke and to the other lordys of this party, they knewe and vnderstode, that if they prouydyd not shortlye for remedy for themselfe, they shulde all be destroyed. And for that, they by one assent gatheryd to them a stroge hoost of men, as of Marchemen and other, .and in the moneth of Octobre, that was in the begyfiynge of the. xxxviii. yere of y- reygne of kynge Henrye, and the later ende of this mayers yere, they drewe them towarde the kynge, to the entent to remoue from hym suche persones as they thought were enemyes vnto the comon weale of Englonde.

Whereof the sayde Charlis beyng asserteynyd, thougth he wolde vse some meane to knowe the vertue of this wenche ; & for he had perfyght expcryence y before tymes this woman had neuer seen his persone, he thought he wolde chaunge his rome & babyte, to see whether she by hyr vertue coulde knowe hym from other. And that done, he standynge amonge other of hir' famylyers as one of them, she was callyd into the chaumber, and demaundyd if eier before tyme she had seen the kyng, and after she hadde answeryd nay, she was bydden to espye out the kyn<*e, whiche there stode amonge that companye ; the whiche anon without dyffyculte hvm fande, and salutyd as kynge. And albe it that he refusyd hyr reuerence, & sayde that she erryd in hyr choyse, yet she parseueryd knelynge at his feete, and sayde, that by Goddys purueyaunce she was taught that he was hir very soueraygne prynce & none FoLCCxH, other.

By meane whereof, after this vnkyndly warre had duryd by the space of. vi. monethes or more, a peace and vnyte atwene the father and sone was treatid, & by meanys of the erle of Ewe a concorde and. vnyte atwene them was fynally concludyd, & he the sayd Lewys, and all such as with hym were reteynyd or allyed, were for this offence, by the sayd Charlys clerely pardoned, one persone all onlye ex ceptyd, namyd Iaket or Iakys, by whose treason the casteil of Maxent was loste and taken ; for whiche offence he was after drawen, hanged, & also quarterid. Tha in processe of tyme folowynge, the Flemynges of Gaunt rebellyd agayn theyr duke or erle namyd Phylyp, cause of which rebellyon was, for that he areryd a greuouse taske vpon salte, and. put the people therby to greuouse charge.

In the whiche passe tyme kynge Lowys comynge out of Normandye, was re- ceyued into the cytie, where, after his comynge, he put in execucion. v. persones named Iohfi Worter, Eustace and Arnolde Worter, Iohfi Coart, and Fraunceys Hasle ; the which persones were accusyd to hym to be chief occacioners of y legation made vnto the lordes. Of whiche sayd. v. persones, thre, as Iohfi Coart, Fraunceys Hasle, & Arnolde Worter, were messangers assygned in the said legation for the consuls of Parys, and the forenamed Eustace Worter was one of y thre assygned for the clergye.

(for her brother and sister died issutlesse) beganne her raigne ouer this realme of Englande and her other dominions tire xvii. day of Nouember : her grace being then at Hatfielde in Hartfordeshire ; who shortly after came to London, and was most ioyfully receiued of all sortes'of her subiectes: and passinge through the citie to the Tower, behaued herself to like a louing soucraigne, that neuer princes could haue greater signes of loue shewed by subiectes then she had. The. xviii. day of Nouember died cardinall Poole, at Lambeth, where he longe had lyen sicke ; and, shortly after, diuers other bisshoppes. Shortly after was the corps of quene Mary, with greate solempnitie and funerall rites, conueyed to Westminster, and there buried honourable. And while prouision was making for quene Elizabethes coronation, her highnes was lodged in the Tower, accompanied with the whole nobilitie and clergy of the realme who were abiding then at London, by the meanes of a parliamet, which queene Mary had called not long before her death. The portes & hauens were stopped, & none suffered to passe out of the realm vVoute licence. \u2022 , , The quenes highnes, by proclamation, forbadde all men to preache, saue such as she shulde appoynt ;\u00b0also to alter any rites or ceremonies vsed in y church, saue as it was in her graces chappell, where the Englishe procession was songe, and the epistle and ghos petrat masse read in English, without anye liftinge vp or shewinge of the sacrament The. xiiii. day of Ianuarye the queene, accompanied with the nobilitie and clergie, and her whole familie, departed fro the Tower, and passed through London to West minster, there to bee crowned ; in whiche passage she behaued herselfe moste humbly towarde God and her people : for at her graces firste comming out of the Tower, before she entered into her chariote, she lifted vp her handes to heauen and said, \" O Lorde Almightie and euer liuing God, I giue thee moste heartie thankes that thou hnsl been so mercifoll vnto me, as to spare me to see this ioyfull daye. And I ac knowledge that thou hast dett as wonderfollye and as mercifully with me as thou didst & with \u00a3"], [758, "QUENE ELIZABETH. 720 with thy true fe faithfull seruaunt Daniel thy prophet, who thou dehueredst out of the dene from the crueltie of the gredy & raging lions : euen so was I ouerwhehned, & only by thee deliuered. To thee therefore onely be thankes, honour, and praise for euer. Amen.\" This was her graces praier. Then her grace passed on forth vntill she came to *an churche, the people on eche side ioyously beholding the viewe of so gracious a lady their quene, and her grace no lesse gladly noting and obseruing the same. Nere vnto Fanchurch was erected a scaffolde, richelye furnished, whereon stoode a noyse of instruments, and a childe in costly apparell, whiche was appoincted to welcum the quenes maiestie in the whole cities behalf. Against which place, whe her grace came, of her own wil she commaunded the chariot to be staied, fe that the noise might be appeased, til the child had vttered his welcomming oration ; at which words of the last litie the whole people gaue a great shoute, wishing with one assent as the childe had saied, and the quenes maiestie \"thanked most heartly, bothe the citie for this her gentle receyuing at the first, and also the people for confirming the same. Then her grace marched forward toward Gracious strete, where was erected a goodly pageant and a sumptuous, which was the vnitinge of the twoo houses of Yorke and Lan caster. This pageant was grounded vppon the queenes maiesties name-; but when her grace had vnderstode the meaning thereof, she thanked the citie, and promised that she would do her noble endeuour for the continual preseruatio of concorde, as the pageant did emporte. Then her grace went forward till she came to Comehill, wher was another goodly pageant, which was named the seate of worthy gouernemet, wher her grace staied, fe caused her chariot to be drawen nigli vnto it, y her grace might heare the childes oration, whiche when she hadde hard, and vnderstode the meaning of the pageant at ful, gaue f citie also thankes there ; and moste graciously promised her good endeuour for the main tenaunce of the saied vertues, and suppression of the vices, as the saied pageant did emport. And so went forth till she came to the nexte pageant, whiche was against Soper lane ende. Whiche pageante was of the eyght beatitudes, expressed in the. v. Chap, of the Ghospell of S. Mathew, wherof euery one, vppon iust considerations, was applied vnto her highnes ; whiche when her grace had moste attentiuelye heard what was pronounced vnto her by the child, al the people wished that God w-oulde strength her grace against al her aduersaries, whd the queenes maiestie moste heartelye thanked for their so louing wishe. Then her grace passed forwarde throughe Cheapesyde, which was dressed faire, and at the standerd was placed a nois of trumpets, and banners and other furniture. Soone after ber grace passed the crosse, she espied the pageant at the litle conduit at Cheape, and it was tolde her grace that there was placed Time. \" Time,\" quod she, \" and time bath broughte me hither.\" And as the whole matter was in declaring to her o-race, and that she vnderstode that the Bible in Englishe should be deliuered \"her, she thanked the citie for that gift, and saied that she would often times reade ouer that booke, com maunding syr Iohn Parat, one of the knightes which helde vp the canapye, to go before and receyue the booke ; but learning that it should be deliuered her grace downe by a sylken lace, she caused him to stay, and so passed on till she came against the aldermen in the high end of Cheape. And there by appointment, the right worshipf'ull maister Ranulph Cholmeley, recorder of the citie, presented to the quenes maiestie a purse of crimosyn satin, richelye wroughte with golde, wherein the citie gaue vnto the queenes maiestie a thousande markes in golde, as maister recorder did declare bresely vnto the queenes maiestie, whose wordes tended to this ende ; that the lorde maior, his brethren and comminaltie of the citie, to declare their gladnes and good wil towardes the queenes maiestie, did present her grace w that golde, desiring her grace to continue their <?ood and"], [759, "QUENE ELIZABETH. 721 and gracious queene, and not to esteme the value of the giste, but the minde of the geuers. The quenes maiestie vV bothe her handes tooke the purse, and answered to him merueylous pithily; and so pithilye that the standers by, as they embraced entirely her gracious answere, so thei merueyled at the couching therof, whiche was in wordes truely reported these : \" I thanke my lorde Maior, his brethren, and you all. And where as your request is that I shoulde continue your good lady & queene, be ye sure that I wil be as good vnto you as euer was queene to her people. No wyll ,n me can Iacke, neither dooe I truste there shall Iacke any power; and perswade your selues, that for the safetie and quietnes of you all, I will not spare, if nede bee, to spende my bloud.\" Which an swere of so noble an hearted princesse, if it moued a merueylous shoute and reioysing', it is nothynge to bee feared, sence both the hartinesse therof was so wonderfull, and the wordes thereof so ioyntly knitte. When her grace had thus answered the recorder, she marched towarde the litle conduit, where she staied also to heare the child whiche stoode to interprete the pageant ; whiche childe declared vnto her grace the whole meaning of the saied pageant, as in a booke, which is set forth more plainlye, dooeth appeare. When the childe had ended his speache, he reached a booke towardes y quenes maiestie, whiche by syr Ihon Parat was receiued, & deliuered to the quene ; but she, as soone as she had receyued the boke, kissed it, and \\v bothe her handes helde vp the same, & so laied it vpon her brest, with great thankes to the citie therfore ; and so wet forwardes towarde Pauses church yarde. And whe she came ouer against Pauses schole, a childe, appointed by the scholemaister thereof, pronounced an oration and certaine verses in Latyn; vnto the whiche her grace moste attentiuely harkened. And when the childe had pronounced he did kisse the oration, whiche he had there faire written in paper, and deliuered it vnto the queenes maiestie, which most gently receyued the same. And when her grace had herd all that was there offered to be spoken, she marched towarde Ludgate, where she was receyued with a noise of instrumentes, the forfront of the gate being finely trimmed against her maiesties comming. From thence by the waye as she went downe toward Fletebridge, one about her grace noted that there was no coste spared. Her grace answered that she did well consider the same, and that it should be remebred. An honorable answere worthy a noble prince; which may comforte all subiectes, consideryng that there can bee no point of gentlenes or obeidient loue shewed towarde her grace, which she dooeth not most entierly accept, and graciously waye. In this maner, the people on either side reioysing, her grace went forward toward the condite in Fletestrete, where was y fiste and last pageant. The historie was of Debora, the iudge and restorer of the house of Israeli, Iud. 4. When the quenes maiestie drewe nere vnto this pageant, and perceyued as in y other a child ready to speake, her grace required silence, and commaunded her chariot to be remoued nigher that she might plainly heare the child speake. When the quenes msiestie had passed this pageant she marched towarde Temple Barre ; but at sainct Dunstons churche, where the children of the hospitall were appointed to stand with their gouernours, her grace perceyuinge a childe offered to make an oration vnto her, staied her chariot, & did cast vp her eyes to heauen, as who woulde say, I here see this merciful worke towarde the poore, whom I muste, in the mydest of my royaltie, needes remebre ; and so tourned her face toward the childe, whiche in Latyn pronounced an oration to this effect, that after the quenes highnes hadde passed thorough the citie, and had sene so suptuous, riche, and notable spectacles of the citezins, whiche declared their moste heartie re ceiuing & ioyous welcoming of her grace into the same, this one spectacle yet rested and remained, which was the euerlastinge spectacle of mercie, vnto the pore membres of. almightie God, furthered by that famous and moste noble prince kynge Henrye the. viii., her graces father, erected by the citie of London, aduauced by the most godly, ver- 4.Z. tuous,,"], [760, "4 MM QUENE ELIZABETH. tuous, & gracious prince king Edwarde the. vi., her graces dere fe louing brother, doubting nothing of the mercie of y quenes most gracious clemecie, by the which thei may not onely be releued and helped, but also staied fe defended ; & therefore inces sauntly thei would pray & crie to God for the long life and raigne of her hyghnes, vV most prosperous victorie against her enemies. The child, after he had ended his oration, kissed the paper wherin the same was written, & reached jt to the queenes maiestie, whiche receyued it graciously, both with wordes and countenauce, declaring her gracious mind toward their relief. From thence her grace came to Temple Barre, whiche was dressed finely with the twoo images of Gogmagog the Albion, and Corius y Britton, two giauntes bigge in stature, furnished accordingly, which held in their hands, euen aboue the gate, a table, wherin was written in Latyn verses, the effecte of all the pageauntes whiche the citie before had erected. On the South side was appointed by the citie a noyse of singinge children, and one childe richely attyred as a poet, which gaue the queenes maiestie her farewell, in the name of the whole citie ; wherin while he repealed certaine wishes, for mainte naunce of trueth, and rootinge out of erroure, she now & than helde vp her handes to heauenwarde, and willed the people to saye, Amen. Whe the childe had ended, she saied, \" Be ye well assured I wyll stande youre good queene.\" At whiche saying her grace departed forthe through the Temple Bar towarde Westminster, with no lesse shouting and criyng of the people, then she entred the citie, with a noyse of ordinance whiche the Tower shot of at her first entrauce into Tower strete. Thus the queenes hyghnes passed through the citie, which, without any foraein person, of itself beautified itselse, and receyued her grace at al places, as hath beene before mentioned, with moste tender obedience & loue, due to so gracious a quene and soue raigne lady ; and her grace likewise on her side, in al her graces passage, shewed herselfe generallye an image of a worthy lady and gouernour. The next day, which was the. xv. day of Ianuary, her grace was moste honorably crowned at Westminster, where y seruice was in such sort celebrated as was vsed in her graces cbappel. Then for a while were scates of armes practised by the nobilitie, as running at the tilte, & fightinge at barriers, wherein the duke of Norfolk was much commended. The. xx. day of Ianuary, her highnes began a parliament, before the estates whereof, in Westminster churche, doctour Coxe, late come fro beyonde the seas, made a learned and fruitefull sermon. In this parliament the first smites and tenthes were restored to the crowne; and also the supremacie, which quene Mary had alienated to the pope. At the feast of Easter was the parliament respited for a season. During which time was begon a conference at Westminster abbey, betwene the clergie, cocernynae matters disputable ; but tooke none effecte, because certaine bishoppes vvoulde not obey the order which thei themselues had desired & appointed. At the time appoynted, the parliament began againe ; by the authoritie whereof, al re ligious houses, as of monkes, freers, and nunnes, whiche wer reedified in quene Maries time, were geuen to the quene, to be at her highnes dispositio. AJso the. vii. day of April, during yet the parliament, was proclaimed peace betwene England, Fraunce, and Scotland, to y great reioysing of the people, whiche with the late warres had been sore impouerished. In the foresaied parliament also, was the booke of seruice fe ministration of sacra mentes, vsed in king Edward the sixtes time, reestablished, and al other fourmes and rites forbidden. During this parliament, the lorde Wentworth, lord deputie of Caleys, whiche had 2 lien"], [761, "QUENE ELIZABETH. 723 lien prisoner in Fraunce euer since the losse ofy towne, came to Westminster, and before the iudges so cleared him seise of all suche treasons and crimes as were layed against him, that he was restored to his fame and liuing, which till that time had been kept from him.
