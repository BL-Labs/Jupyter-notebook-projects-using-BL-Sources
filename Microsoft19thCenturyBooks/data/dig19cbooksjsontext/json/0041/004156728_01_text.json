To enter into some considerations of the utility of a Topographical Dictionary of England. II. To take a Review of former Books of the same kind. 'III. To state shortly the materials from whence additional intelligence ha\u00bb been procured for the present Work ; And to furnish introductory Explanations of tlie method observed,, and of the information to be expected by the Reader. d. On the first Topic, the acknowledged Utility and favourable reception of other works of the same kind render it unnecessary to enter into many \u2022Observations: a summary view may, however, be taken of the several very extensive Descriptions of Persons, to whom the Author flatters himself this Work will be found eminently useful, J. To Magistrates in the Removal of Paupers, in the Direotion of \"Warrants, and all Parochial and County Business. 2. To the Nobility and Gentry of extensive Landed Property. .3. To the Clergy, and all Persons in any manner connected with Eccle- siastical Benefices, local rights, and other objects appertaining \u2022to the Establishment,"], [16, "tux PREFACE. II 4. To all Persons in the various Public Offices under Government, and particularly in the Post-Office Department. i. To Conveyancers, Solicitors, Buyers and Sellers of Estates and Prop- erty b) Commission, Gentlemen desirous of purchasing, and to those who may have occasion to consult the Public Advertisements of Sales and Auctions. 6. To Students, Authors, and generally to all Persons of Research, who may require authentic Information respecting the local, statistical, and other facts and circumstances relating to the Kingdom of England. In taking a Review of former Books, which have been compiled for the same purposes, the first worthy of notice is John Speed's -popular Work, intituled, '* A Prospect of the most famous Parts of the World, fye \"\" Together with all the Provinces, Counties, and Shires, contained \"' in that large Theator of Great Brittaines Empire. Performed \" by John Speed. London, 1631. Folio.\" Previously to this, Speed had published a Book of County Maps in 1608, and another Edition in 1610; and the greater part of the. Volume of which the Title is given above, consists of Impressions of the same Maps improved ; And at the Back of each Map is printed an Alphabetical Table of all the Places represented therein, and a short Description of the County. This laborious Work has been found accurate beyond expectation. But, as has been observed by Adams in the Preface to his Index Villaris, ( Edition, 1690, ) \" by making <s an Alphabet to each single County, (Speed) rendered it useless to all \" those who were to seek for any Place, that knew not the County in which \" it was situate.\" In the Year 1656, Twenty-five Years after the Publication of Speed's Work, appeared \" Villare Anglicum : Or, A View of the Townes Tr of England. Collected -by the Appointment of Sir Henry Spel \" man. Knight. London, 1656, 4to.\" At Page 2, of the Preface to the Seeond Edition, in 1678, it is stated, that the '' Eye may safely travel in a *f few hours over all England, this Book pre senting the Towns and Villages \" thereof, alphabetically methodized, with the Addition ef their respective \"\u25a0 Counties, Hundreds, Rapes, Wapentakes, fye., wherein they are. Also the \" Bishopricks and Counties under their several Jurisdictions, and number of \" Parishes in each Diocess; The Names of the Shires, and Shire-Towns, \" the Number of Parishes in each County, with the several Places that \u00ab'\u2022 send Memb#rs to Parliament, and the number each sends.\" This Work,"], [17, "HC PREFACE. which thus endeavours to recommend itself under the great name of Spelman, is indeed no more than the Incorporation of Speed's Tables into one Alphabet, and as such must have been of considerable use, though it unfairly lays claim to Originality. In the Year 1668, appeared a small Quarto under the following Title, \" A Book, of the Names of all Parishes, Market Towns, Villages, \" Hamlets, and smallest Places, in England and Wales. Alphabeti \" cally set down, as they be in every shire, wlth the names ofthe \" Hundreds in which they are, and how many Towns there are in \" every Hundred, fye. London.\" But as this is only a Copy of Speed's County Tables, it is not worth further Notice. In the Year 1680, Twenty-four Years after the Publication of the Villare Anglicum, appeared a Work, under the Title of \" Index Vil laris: Or, An Alphabetical Table of all the Cities, Market \" Towns, Parishes, Villages, and Private Seats, in England and \" Wales. By Mr. John Adams of the Inner Temple. London. 1680. \" Folio. \" In the Preface it appears, that this Index Villaris was originally intended to obviate the Objections which had been made to a Map of England previously constructed by the Author, and which did not, indeed could not, contain the Villages: Having noticed this, Mr. Adams proceeds to say, \" I have used all possible Care, Industry, and Pains, in comparing \" the Villare Anglicum of Sir Henry Spelman, and the printed Tables of \" Speed's Maps, with the Maps themselves, as well as those of Saxton and \" others, and regulating the whole by an Abstract taken from the Books of \" the Hearth Office, and other private Accompts returned me from several \" Counties. But the Imperfections and ill Position of those Maps, in Respect \" of the Bearings of the Compass, and the Want of sufficient Information \" for the Placing in their true Latitude and Longitude such Additional \" Villages and Private Seats, as the said Hearth Books, and other private \" Accompts, furnished me with, has rendered this Work so imperfect that \" nothing but an Actual Survey of all England and Wales can compleat \" the same, which, by God's Assistance, I will accomplish by the 25th of \" March, 1685.\" This candid Acknowledgement deserves Praise : and the Value, which the Public have put upon Mr. Adams's Work, is shown by the Publication of a Second Edition in 1690, and a Third in 1700. In the Year 1751, Seventy-one Years after the first Edition of Adams's Index Villaris, appeared a Work, intituled, \" England's Gazetteer; Or, \" An Accurate Description of all the Cities, Towns, and Village* vol. i. b"], [18, "I III. A PREFACE. \" of the Kingdom. In three Volumes. Vol. I. and II. contain h \" Dictionary of the Cities, Corporations, Market-Towns, and the \"most noted Villages, &c. Vol. III. A New Index Villaris, or, \" Alphabetical Register of the less noted Villages ; With their \" Distance, or Bearing, from the next Market-Town, or well-known \" Place. By Stephen Whatley. London. 1751. 12mo.\" After noticing the deficiencies and impel sections of former Books of the same kind, Mr. Whatley, in his Preface, says, that \" The Variety of Improvements \" this Age has produced, both in geographical Descriptions of England, \" and in the Maps of its several Counties, many of which, within these \" few Years, have been done by actual Surveys, and on a large Size and \" Scale, have given the Compiler of this Work opportunity to add above a \" thousand Villages omitted by Mr. Adams; and the extraordinary pains \" he has been at, in the frequent Inspection of these useful Maps, and the \" great number of Books he has diligently and repeatedly consulted for \" this purpose, besides Informations from Correspondents in different Parts \"\u25a0 of the Kingdom, have enabled him to bring this Performance to a degree \" of perfection, beyond his most sanguine hopes.\" Mr. Whatley dedicates his Work to The Right Hon. Arthur Onslow, Speaker of the House of Commons, and certainly appears to have possessed very valuable materials. The Work is executed with great accuracy; and is evidently the Basis of the several Gazetteers, which have since been published as original com positions. Most of them indeed (even the most recent, ) are mere Copies of Mr. Whatley 's Book. i large quantity of information, more authentic than any to be procured from the several works already mentioned, has been afforded by the Returns to the several Parliamentary Inquiries of 1776 and 1786 respecting the Poor's Rate; that of 1801 for enumerating the Population; and finally, a third Inquiry respecting the Poor and Poor's Rate in 1803. To the Accident of the Author's employment in the Office, where these last Returns were arranged, may indeed be ascribed the production of the Work now offered to the Public. The difficulty and frequent delay, which occurred in that Office, from the want of some general Directory,. at once led him to perceive, that an amended Index Villaris was become necessary, and enabled him by experience to execute it in a manner satis factory to himself. In explanation of the Information to be expected, the Author requests his Readers to observe that ( 1) the Orthography of every name has been"], [19, "PREFACE. XI (1) determined with the utmost attention; (2) after the name appears the Hundred or other Subdivision, and County, in which the place is situate; (3) if a Parish, the Valuation in the King's Books, and other Eccle siastical Information, is next given; (4) then the Population; (5) Poor's Rate; (6) and the Distance and Bearing of each place from the nearest Post-Office Town, from the County Town, or the Metropolis. Other Information, applicable only to places of some Importance, ii then given in the following Order; (7) Markets and Fairs; (8) Members of Parliament and Corporations; (9) Free Schools; (10) Petty Sessions, and Assizes. Finally (11) is given miscellaneous Information of Monastic Foundations, and other matters of local History, not reducible to any head of the above classification. The Orthography of the name of each Parish, Township, and Hamlet, is given from an Examination ofthe Returns made to Parliament in the Years 1776, 1786, 1801, compared with those of the Abstract in 1803. Where-ever the Spelling of 1776, 1786, and 1801, agreed with that of the Returns of 1803, that Mode of Spelling has invariably been adopted. When the Spelling of the several Returns did not accord, recourse was had to Mr. Speed's \" Theatre of the Empire of Great Britain,\" and that manner of Spelling, adopted by the Officer who made the Return, which coincided with Mr. Speed, has generally been used. Where-ever the Orthograplrv, herein adopted, differs materially from the ancient Mode, both are inserted, the ancient being distinguished by Italics. But, where-ever the ancient Name is totally unlike the modern, then both are entered in Alphabetical Order, and reference is made to that Name, which is in modern use. As a clear and determinate manner of Spelling in the Names of Places is of some importance, great care has been taken to render this part of the Work accurate. Neither the Spelling of the Returning Officer, nor that of more ancient Date, has been implicitly adhered to : and that all due correctness in this particular might be acquired, the Orthography of each name has been collated with the Spelling in every County Historv, or other Topographical Work, and a uniformity attempted as exact as the modern Pronunciation and the Ety- mology seemed to admit. As many Villages, and Towns, are called by the same name, an Adjunct was in early Times given to distinguish thtm, either by their relative Situation, or their Magnitude, or from their ancient Possessors In this b2"], [20, "XII PREFACE. case, the Adjunct has been placed after the Proper Name, as least likely to occasion disappointment in searching the Alphabet for the place wanted. (3.) The Hundred, Wapentake, Lathe, Rape, Ward, Soke, or other Jurisdiction, to which each Parish belongs, is taken from the Endorsement upon the Poor Returns, made to the Office of the Secretary of State in 1803, compared also with the various County Histories and Mr. Speed. In case a City, or Town, enjoys the Privilege of electing its own Magistrates, and being governed by them separately and distinctly from the Jurisdiction of the Justices of the County at large, this Privilege is ascribed to them from the Answers of the Clerks* of the Peace of the several Counties, to a Circular printed Letter, requesting, (for the purpose of distri- buting the Single Sheet Abstract of the Poor Returns,) among other particulars, to know, \" whether there any Corporations, or other Liber- \" ties, with which the County Magistrates have no Connection or \"Interference:\" And if the Justices of the County have concurrent Jurisdiction, it is so specified from the same Answers of the Clerks of the Peace. If a Parish be under the Jurisdiction of particular Magistrates, though locally situate in a distant Subdivision of the same County, or in another County, this distinction is noticed. Or, if a Parish, situate upon the confines of two Counties, makes distinct Parochial Returns separately, or collectively, this peculiarity is also remarked. Where-ever a single place constitutes an entire Parish, it is so expressed; but, where it is only part of a Parish, then the Parish, to which it belongs, is specified. No Name of a place mentioned in the Returns to Government is omitted ; on the contrary, where the component parts of a Parish are not specified by the Overseer, such deficiencies have been supplied from the County Histories. And, in those Counties, of which there is no regular Description or History, the omissions have been supplied from the Answers to Circular Questions, addressed to- the Clergy, or Parochial Officers, in the neighbourhood. The Labour and Expence of procuring Information in this manner has not been inconsiderable, upwards of twelve hundred Letters having been written and received in this kind of Inquiry. (3.) The Valuations of the Ecclesiastical Benefices are taken from Mr. Bacon's Liber Regis, Edition of 1786. But, it is incumbent upon the Author to mention, that implicit reliance must not be placed upon his statement of"], [21, "PREFACE. XIII the Patrons of all the Benefices. This he has felt to be the most difficult part in the execution of his Plan; and is sensible, that his attempts at accuracy have not been attended with success. There are, however, so many Benefices in the Patronage of the Crown, the Archbishops and Bishops, the Universities, the Nobility, and other old Families, that the useful Information, really conveyed, seemed too valuable to be omitted, from the apprehension of partial inaccuracy in other eases, where the- Advowson is liable to frequent transfers. Where Ancient Parishes have been united with the neighbouring Benefices, such Unions are carefully noticed. (4.) The Resident Population is taken from the Abstract of the Answers and Returns made pursuant to an Act, passed in the 41\u00b0 Geo. III., \" for \" taking an Account of the Population of Great Britain, and the Increase \" or Diminution thereof.\" ( 5. ) The Amount of Money raised by the Parish Rates, and at what Rate in the Pound,* for the Year ending Easter 1803, is taken from the Returns made by the Overseers pursuant to an Act, passed in the 43\u00b0 Geo. III., \" for pro- \" curing Returns relative to the Expenee and Maintenance of the Poor in \" England.\" The Parish Rate includes the Poor's Rate, Church Rate, County Rate, Highways, Militia, &c. Where-ever the Assessments are entered without specifying the Rate in the Pound, this has arisen gen- erally from an Omission of the Overseer. Where-ever the Parish Rate is \" levied by the Plough-land, Yard-land, or Ox-gang, it is so mentioned : Or, if the Rate is levied upon the Rack Rental, that also is noticed. (6.) The Post-Office Towns are according to the List printed for the \" General \" Post-Office, Sth April, 1801.\" The Towns and Villages within the Limits of the Two-penny Post- Office are according to the List printed for the \" Two-penny Post-Office, \"4th December, 1801.\" * It is evident, that if the Rate in the Pound was uniformly levied on the Rack Rental, the amount of such Rental might be deduced by an easy arithmetical operation. If (for instance) 4s. (in the gg.) produce s\u00a3lO0, what would 20s. produce? The Answer of course is ,\u00a7\u00a3j00. (4: 100:: 20:: 500.) It happens, however, in most cases, that the Poor's Rate is levied ou an ancient Rental, not surpassing (on an average throughout England,) three fourths of the real or Rack Rental ; so that any conclusion drawn from the Rate in the Pound must be in a considerable degree uncertain, except where it is specified to b\u00bb levied on the Rack Rental, See Abstract of Poor Returns of 1803, p. 7l6."], [22, "PREFACE. X1T The Maps, which have been used for ascertaining the Distances and Bearings, are those published in 1804 by Mr. Smith, of the Strand, London : Reference being occasionally made to the Maps published by Mr. Cary, and many other County Maps. Hence the Geographical Bearings of the several Parishes, and Hamlets, from the nearest Post-Office Town, are inserted. The Post-Office Towns are noted by their Bearing from the County Towns, and also from London: the County Towns by their Bearing from London only. Those Towns, or Villages, which are situate within the limits of the Two-penny Post-Office, are set from St. Paul's Cathedral, London. If a Place is situate nearer to a Post-Office Town, in an adjoining County, than to the nearest in its own, in that case, its Distance and Bearing from both is inserted; the Post-Office Town of its own County being always placed first. If the Distance and Bearing of any Parish be omitted, (instances of which are few,) that Parish has not been inserted in the County Maps. But, where the Distance ancl Bearing of any Township, or Hamlet, is not inserted, those Places are generally so unimportant as not to require particular Distinction, especially as the Parish, to which they belong, is always mentioned. Where-ever the Road, leading from a Post-Office Town, passes through any particular Town, or Village, the Number of Miles thereto has been copied from the Maps. But, in all the Cross-Roads, the direct distance has been mea sured on the Maps from the nearest Post-Office Town to the place in question, and to that distance, one seventh Part more has been added;* except in mountainous, or fenny Counties, when a greater proportion has occasionally been allowed. (7.) Tlie Markets and Fairs are taken generally from the best Books of Topo- graphy/ omitting those Fairs which have fallen into disuse. * In Major Rennell's Memoir of a Map of Hindoostan, there is a Disquisition of some length on the usual Difference of Distance as measured on a Road, and on a Map. Iii p. 5, he says, \" Seven Miles \" of Road measure are allowed to produce Six. Miles in a direct Line.\" In p. 6, he says, \" one in eight \" may be a pretty just general Proportion for Distances of about 100 Miles.\" Iu p. 7, he says, \" In \" England, as far as we can trust the Maps, 1 in II is the proportion, in Distances of about 100 Miles; \" and in very great Distances, such as Edinburgh, 1 in 7.\" In a Xote (p. 7,) he gives a general Rule; that the Distance is to be broken into portions of 100 or 150 Miles; then add one eighth Part. For the puqnoses of the present Work, experiment has proved, that it is proper to add one Seventh Part to the Rectilinear Distance; the Cross-Roads here to be computed, though short, being usually much. more crooked than the great Roads leading to the Metropolis, or any other large Town."], [23, "PREFACE. xr (8.) The Number of Members, which each City, or Borough Town, sends to Parliament, and the Title of the Returning Officer at Elections, together with the state of each Corporate Bod}', are taken from Mr. Browne Willis's Notitia Parliament aria, The History of Boroughs, and sundry Topo- graphical Histories. ( 9. ) Notices of Free Schools, Hospitals, and similar Foundations, are extracted from a Variety of Books of Topography, which have necessarily been consulted. (10.) The Names of those Places, at which Petty Sessions are siatedto be holden, are extracted from the Answers of the Clerks of the Peace to the Circular Letter before-mentioned, (p. xii) wherein a Request was made to be furnished with \" a correct List of the several Petty Sessions or Meetings \" of the Justices; describing each Petty Sessions or Meeting by its Place ' ' of Meeting, or other common Appellation.\" (11.) The miscellaneous Information, which appears in some Articles, if short, is usually given without Marks of Quotation; but, when considerable Quantity is extracted from any Book or other Authority, it is distin- guished by inverted Commas; and the Name of the Author, with a Refer- ence to his Work, immediately follows. A List of the most important Topographical Books, which have been consulted, is subjoined at the end of the Preface. This will show to literary men, in the best and shortest manner, the degree of Authority to which the Work is entitled, and whether the Author has been industrious in his researches, and judicious in his selection of such Information, as could be inserted in a Topographical Dictionary. If any of the Quotations, which are given, should seem to be irrelevant, it is to be considered, that these passages are introduced specially to exhibit the Style of certain rare and old Books; whilst other extracts of modern Date are occasionally inserted to denote where further Intelligence may be found, if the pursuits of the Reader incline him to particular Research. The Manuscripts, which are referred toy are preserved in that Noble Repository, The British Museum. In Addition to printed Books and Manuscripts, it remains to mention another species of Assistance; that which the Author has received from the kindn\u00abs* 3"], [24, "XVI PREFACE. of his Friends; and he ventures to hope that they will not be displeased at bis mentioning in terms of gratitude those, to whom he feels himself more particularly indebted for information. To The Right Hon. Loid Sheffield ; to The Right Hon. Sir Joseph Banks, whose Life and Fortune are devoted to the Improvement of every Kind of useful Literature and Science ; to his excellent Friend John Rickman, Esq., who was appointed by Government to digest, and reduce into Order, the Population Abstract; to Craven Ord, Esq., for h's frank and liberal Exertions; to Sir Richard Colt Hoare; to Sir Thomas Frankland; to The Rev. Samuel Partridge and his intelligent young Friend Mr. C. K. Tuniiard; to The Rev. Godfrey Egremont; to Henry Hobhouse, Esq.; to Charles Manners Sutton, Esq. ; and to the Officers of the British Museum, for their ready attention and assistance to his Researches; And to all the Clergy, and Gentry, in various Parts of the Kingdom, who have so readily answered his inquiries, the best Thanks of the Author are due. He offers them with the most unfeigned Gratitude and Respect ; And is proud to acknowledge the Attention, which has uniformly been given to the many Questions, which he has had occasion to ask of Persons strangers to himself, in aid of his other sources of 'Information. It would be improper to conclude this preface without informing the Reader, that the Dominion of Wales is not included in the present Dictionary. The Orthography of the Names and Appellatives in that part of the Kingdom, is so irregular, that the Author could not prevail on himself to throw them into Alpha betical form, without having attained some knowledge of the Language and of the Country. He hopes hereafter to acquire these advantages, and will then attempt to produce a Third Volume, which with Wales, may include Scotland, Ireland, and the Islands inthe British Seas; thus completing the whole of the United Kingdom.

ASTERLEY, or EASTERLEY, in the hund. of Chadlington, Co. of Oxford \". Among \" the Fields and Woods of this Parish, (Kiddington,) detached at almost half a Mile's \" Distance from Over Kiddington, to the South YVest, is a single Farm-House called Asterley, si which also denominates a Manour. Here was once the Parish of Asterley, of which the \" Memory now scarcely subsists in Tradition. But there is a large Field, called Chapelbreke, \" now covered with Bushes and high Trees, in which the Church, long since decayed or \" destroyed, may probably be supposed to have stood. The Inequalities of the Ground seem \" also to denote the Site of an antient and considerable Mansion-house. Here have been dug \" up, pieces of the Mouldings of lancet Windows, and other Fragments of antique Masonry \" in Stone. Other Buildings, or Houses, seem also to have been once standing hereabout. \" The Church, called the Parochial Church of Asterley in the Registers of Lincoln, was t( dedicated to St. Peter. It was a Rectory, and was valued in 1291, at seven Marcs and a \" half, and is recited under the Deanery of Cheping-Norton. \u2014 In the Year 1466, and on the <s22d October, John Chedworth Bishop of Lincoln, judicially seated in the Monastery of f* the Dominican Friers at Oxford, united and incorporated the Church of Asterley with that of \" Kiddington, on the Petition of Sir Richard I lling worth, &c, and with the Consent of Fulk \" Burmyngham, Archdeacon of Oxford. Among the Reasons for this Measure, the Bishop, \" having first stated the Convicinity and Contiguity of the two Parishes, represents, that the \" Tenths, Oblations, Rents, and Emoluments, of the Rectory of Asterley were so diminished, \" as to be insufficient to support a Rector, or even a competent parochial Chaplain, on Account \" of Paucity of Parishioners, Barrenness of Land, Defects of Husbandry, and an unusual \" Prevalence of Pestilences and epidemic Sicknesses. AU which Evils, he adds, are perpetually \" encreasing, nor can ever be removed, on this deplorable Principle, quoniam mundus semper (i ad deteriora se declinet, because the World is always naturally growing worse. He therefore \"transfers all Parochial Rights, spiritual Jurisdictions, and Obventions, from the Church of \" Asterley to that of Kiddington, and to its present Rector Richard Wodeand his Successours, \" thus reducing and consolidating both Churches into one Body. Rivers were antiently the \" Boundaries of Parishes ; and there is great Reason to suppose, that the whole of Upgei VOL. I. K"], [98, "AST \u00ab Kiddington, separated from Lower Kiddington by the River Glym, and which is not mthe \" same Hundred with Lower Kiddington, was originally Part of the Parish of Asterley. To \" this it may be objected, that in a Presentation to Kiddington, above cited, Nether Cudington \" is mentioned in the Year 1380. And Mr. Astle has pointed out to me a Fine-Roll of King \" Hen. III., of the Year 1241, in which Francis de Punchard claims Right against Ralph de \" Salcey, of common Pasture in a Moor of the said Ralph at Upper-Cudingtbn. However, I \" am of Opinion, that the Lords of Asterley and Kiddington, two Manours which' have \" constantly gone together, antiently lived at Asterley : but that at length they removed their \" capital Seat to Kiddington, a Situation less exposed, and nearer the AVater. This Circum \" stance soon occasioned the Desertion of Asterley, and at last the Incorporation of its Parish \" into that of Kiddington. Asterley Farm-house claims the Privilege of being Extra-Parochial. \" Hence we may conclude, that, beside the Church, there was a domestic or manenal Chapel \" belonging to the old Family-seat at Asterley, of which the Farm-house is now the Reprc \" sentative.\" \u2014 Warton's Hist, of Kiddington, p. 17, et. seq.

D. 690. The industrious Mr. Joseph Hooker alias \" Vowell, the first Restorer of the Antiquities of this City (whereof he was Chamberlain,) \"saith, 'That in ancient Times, within the Precincts ofthe Close, 'were three Religious \" Houses ; the first was a Nunnery, which is now the Dean's House, (or as Mr. Risdon \" will have it, the Kalendar Hay,) ; the other was a House of Monks, reported to have ** been built by Kin<r Etbelred, A.

For this last there fe a pretty good Authority, and that it was \" dedicated to tbe Blessed Virgin and St. Peter, and endowed by tbe Munificence of that King \" with twenty-six Villages, and filled Avith Benedictine Monks, who not long after forsook the \" same for fear of the Danes : But King Edgar, that great Restorer of Monasteries, A.

D. 1019, \" But upon the Union of the Episcopal Sees of St. Germans and Crediton, and their Trans \" lation hither, A.

In the 2d vol. plate 7, of the Vctusta Monumenta, published by The Society of Antiquaries of London, there are Views of this Church, drawn in 1748, to which the following Description is subjoined, \" The Nave or Body of (his Church, which \" renders it so remarkable, is intirely composed ofthe Trunks of large Oaks, split and roughly \" hewed on both Sides. Tbey are set upright, and close to each other ; being let info a Sill at \" the Bottom, and a Plate at the Top, where they are fastened with wooden Pins. This was tbe \" whole of tbe original Fabric, which yet remains infire, ibo' much corroded and worn by \" Length of Time. It is 29 Feet 9 Inches\" long, 14 beet wide, and 5 Feet 6 Inches high, on the \" Sides which supported the primitive Roof. The Inhabitants have a Tradition, that the Corps rt of a dead King once rested in this Church ; which seems to have been founded upon the \" Accounts given vis by some of our old AVriters. For in a MS. intitled, Vita ct Passio vol. i. 4q"], [698, "G R E \" Sti. Edmundi, there is this Passage : A. D. AIX. et anno regis Ethelredi XXX. \" S. Edmundus propter infestationem Turkilli, comitis Danorum,. Londoniam est ab \" Ailwino translatus ; sed tertio anno sequente ad Bedricesworthe est reversus.. And soon \" after it is said : Quidam apud Stapleford hospitio recepit corpus ejus in redeundo de \" London. And in another MS. cited in the Alonasticon, and infitled,. Registrum c\u0153nobii \" S. Edmundi, if is further added : Idem apud Aung re hospitabatur, ubi in ejus memoria. \" lignea capella permanet usque hodie. Now the Parish of Aungre, or Ongar, adjoins to \" that of Greensted, where this Church is situated. And that the antient Road' from London \" info Suffolk lay thro' Olds ord, Abridge, Stapleford, Greensted, Dunmow, ancl Clare, we \" learn not only from Tradition, but likewise from several Remains of it,, which are still visible. \" It seems not improbable therefore, (hat this rough and unpolished Fabric was first erected, as \" a Sort of Shrine, for the Reception of the Corps of St. Edmund, which in its Return from \" London to Bedrieesicorth, or Bury, as Lydgate sais,- was carried iii a Chest. And as we tc are told by the if egister above mentioned, that it remained afterwards in Memory of that \" Transaction ; so it might in Process of Time, with proper Additions made so it, be converted \"into a Parish Church. For we find by New court, that Simon Feverel! succeeded John \" Lodet, as Rector of Grinsted juxta Ongar> in 1328.

His splendid work is executed with equal taste and care, and the end proposed seems to have been fully attained.\" An. Rex,. 2. A DESCRIPTION OF LATIUM; or, LA CAMPAGNA DI ROMA.

Journ. \" The materials have been well employed, and evidently directed by personal observations.\" Ann. Rev. \" The world is indebted for this volume, we believe, to Miss Knight, the author of Marcus Flaminius ; and it will be considered at another honourable proof of her abilities and assiduity. The plates, in number twenty, are touched with spirit, and add much to the interest of the work.\" Eel. Rev. \" It is not our fortune often to meet with a volume, where more information and entertainment are combined. Twenty etchings, by the author, are introduced in the volume. These are slight, but executed with remarkable neatness and precision. A map also of the Campagna is prefixed. The work is confidently, and we believe rightly, attributed to a lady already celebrated as a writer, the accomplished Cornelia Knight.\" Brit. Crit. 5.

No subject at all connected with the undertaking seems to have escaped the author's notice. The work is full of biographical notices, curious Anecdotes, local peculiarities, charters, presentments, &c. &c. and what is not less deserv ng piaise, the extracts from Registers are so various, that certificates may be obtained if necessary, of upwards of a thousand eminent names, exclusive of inscriptions on monuments. The labour of such an undertaking is so manifest, and its utility al the same time so obvious, that it seems a sort of public duty to promote it by all possible accommodation. We have no doubt that when finished this will be the most comprehensive account of London that has ever been published.\" Brit. Crit. The Three first Volumes may be had either separately or together.
