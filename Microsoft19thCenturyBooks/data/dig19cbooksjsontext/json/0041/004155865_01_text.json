OHROPSIIIRE, beautiful in scenery, ancl rich withal in mineral wealth, has a history which, in its earlier phases at least, is inferior in interest to that of no other county in England. Upon its soil, the last great battle for British independence is said to have been fought; and the extensive remains of British earthworks and fortifications which, in a connected chain, extending over the whole southern and western portions of the county, concentrate in the vast military works, Caer Caradoc and Oswestry, indicate the fierce nature of that struggle which Caractacus made, to stay the declining fate of his country. The ruins of the city of Uriconium or Wroxeter, and of their highway, Watling Street, as well as numerous vestiges of other Roman settlements and roads scattered throughout Shropshire, attest how futile, after all, had been the efforts of the heroic Briton to resist the victorious progress of the Latin invader ; whilst, at the same time, the study of these in teresting memorials tends to enlarge our acquaintance with the history of our country during that period of nearly 400 years in wliich it remained subject to the Romans. After the departure of the Romans came the Saxons, when the history of Shropshire, including Pengwern or Shrewsbury, the capital of the old British Kings of Powis, whose wattled halls the fair- haired heathen fired ; the early history of the county of Shrop shire, we say, Avill be found to contribute towards the elucidation of the question as to how the German invaders eventually made themselves masters of England. It was \" Offa the Terrible,\" of Mercia, who finally annexed Shropshire to the land of the Angles or England ; and he it was who, to secure his acquisition, cast up that remarkable entrenchment known as Offa's Dyke. This great earthwork traverses the border for upwards of a hundred miles over mountain and plain, in its course northwards, forming the boundary between Shropshire and Montgomeryshire."], [10, "IV Next came the descent upon the shores of our country of the dread sea-king rovers of the North \u2014 the Danes ; to stay whose destruc tive ravages, King Alfred's high-spirited daughter Ethelfleda, Lady of the , Mercians, reared fortresses both at Chirbury and Brugge or Bridgnorth: Danesford by Severn, in its name, imply ing that the grisly worshippers of Odin were no strangers to Shropshire. Finally occurred the advent of the Normans ; and if a perusal of the history of Shropshire is in any degree calculated to enlarge the reader's acquaintance with the knowledge of his country's history during the British, Roman, Saxon, and Danish epochs, surely this work may claim to contribute something to the general fund of information relating to the Norman Conquest of England, and that Anglo-Norman era, concerning which our general his tories, it may truly be said, are miserably scanty in the amount of accurate information they convey. Among the movers in that great social revolution which eventually laid our country prostrate at the feet of William the Conqueror \u2014 a revolution the influences of which to this day are powerfully felt, not only in our political constitution, but in our laws, language, and manners ; among the leading actors in that great drama, the Saxon Earl Godwin was a Shropshire landowner. Sweyn, his out-lawed eldest son ; Earl Harold, who afterwards disputed the succession to the English throne with \"the Bastard \" count ofthe Normans; Edith, the Lady, the Confessor's lovely yet unhonoured Saxon Queen, as well as her husband King Edward, the last legitimate Anglo-Saxon Monarch ; Edwin and Morcar, the brother Mercian earls, whose sad fate affords a lively comment on the Norman rule ; and Edric, the Forester, who, long after William's victory at Hastings, and his coronation in Westminster Abbey had become accomplished facts, continued, in his western haunts, to baffle every effort of the Conqueror to reduce him ; \u2014 Domesday Book reveals the fact, that these Saxons were all more or less connected with Shropshire. On the Norman side again, we have William the Conqueror him self, and Roger de Montgomery the palatine Earl of Shrewsbury, ranking as chiefs among the Shropshire proprietors. Beneath one or other of these held Warin the Bald, and his successor Rainald the Sheriff, the Corbets, William Pantulf, Ralph de Mortemer, Roger de Laci, Picot de Say, Gerard de Tornai, William de Warrene, Norman Venator, Richard Fitz Osbern, Helgot, and a host of other vassals and retainers of more or less note, who, having"], [11, "V drawn their long-swords at Hastings, or else contributed to extend and consolidate the Norman Duke's victory over the north-western border, received as the meed of their service some portion of Shropshire ; when, transferring themselves and their families thither, innumerable Saxon holders were dispossessed of their respective patrimonies, and their lands apportioned out among the iron-clad strangers. To the unhappy conquered was left life only; and this upon the hard condition of being mere hewers of wood and drawers of water, as it were, to their oppressors. No one could conceive what spoliations and sufferings our vanquished Saxon countrymen endured at the hands of their Norman conquerors, unless he had access to such sources of information as Domesday Book. Yet that venerable aud authentic record is a sealed docu ment to the majority of those who desire to learn more concerning the history of their country. To supply a felt deficiency in this respect, the reader is herewith furnished with the entire Domesday survey of the county of Shropshire, resolved from the obscure Latin contractions of the original into our own language. There is no controverting facts ; and he who will look carefully over the Tables of the Domesday Hundreds of Shropshire, inserted in this book, comparing, as his eye scans their contents, the third columns, in which are entered the names of the Saxon owners of each respec tive estate in Shropshire in the time of the Saxon King Edward, with the fourth, fifth, and sixth columns, which give the names of the chief-tenant, the mesne or next tenant, and that of the sub or under-tenant of the same estate in 10<S6, just twenty years after the battle of Hastings had been fought ; \u2014he who will do this may learn how wholesale that eviction was which attended the conquest of England by the Normans. The principle upon which these Tables of the respective Domes day Hundreds to which they refer have been constructed is this: \u2014 In the first column will be found the modern name of the place alluded to ; by way of contrast, the second column furnishes the reader with the name by which that place was known eight hun dred years ago, or, in other words, when William the Conqueror's Commissioners surveyed Shropshire. The third column gives, as we observed, the name or names of the Saxon owner or owners of the place described in the time of King Edward. The fourth column gives the name of the Domesday tenant in capite ; the fifth column exhibits that of the Domesday mesne or next tenant ; the sixth column gives the name of the Domesday sub-tenant ; whilst"], [12, "VI the seventh and last column gives, in opposition to the title of the Table, the name of the modern Hundred in which the place is now included. With respect to the order in which the various places are entered on these Tables, as a general rule, the estates which the Norman Earl himself retained are entered first ; then follow those which belonged to the largest holder in the particular Hundred in question under the Earl, given as the places are entered in the original record ; and so, gradually down the scale until we arrive at the lesser holders. Glancing at the pre-Norman history of Shropshire then, yet making Domesday Book the great basis of local investigation, it has been our study, as nearly as possible, to furnish the reader with a literal translation of that majestic record. Each place spoken of in the following work is treated separately under a distinct headine:, and throus'hout the book described in the same order as it is entered on the Tables. By adhering to this simple arrangement, we avoid giving offence to our local sub scribers ; whilst, at the same time, the general reader has presented to him a sac-simile almost of the Shropshire Domesday, and other wise becomes possessed of much valuable matter very closely connected with the history of his countiy. Besides the complete Domesday survey of Shropshire, it may be mentioned that this work embraces the three great Ecclesiastical surveys of the county : namely, Pope Nicholas' Taxation, taken about A.D. 1291 ; the Inquisitiones Nonarum, or Inquests of the Ninths, taken about A D. 1341 ; and King Henry the Eighth's Valor Ecclesiusticus, of the year 1 534. A border county, with the earl)' history of Shropshire, is inter woven that protracted struggle, made by the brave Welsh against the asserted supremacy of the Anglo-Saxon and Anglo-Norman kings ; a struggle which terminated only when the Principality was conquered by Edward the First. To treat of the great primeval forests of Shropshire, and its highly interesting British and Roman remains : of the Saxon, Danish, Anglo-Norman and Welsh reminiscences minfflins with, and involved in a description of Oswestry, Wroxeter, Shrewsbury, Bridgcnorth, Ludlow, and its other towns; \u2014 to show how these towns originally acquired their charters of freedom, some from kings, others from the fostering hand of the church, or from their feudal lord ; and, emerging from the darkness and tyranny of the"], [13, "VII middle ages, gradually' became the important municipalities they now are ; \u2014 to give the histories of its rich abbeys and other eccle siastical foundations ; to trace the line of their succession from the conquest of England by the Norman of the Mortemers, and those other Shropshire potentates, whose time appears to have been divided between rebelling against their sovereign, in bloody fray with the Welsh, or else in hunting around those gloomy border fortresses through whose grated donjons scarce penetrated the light of day ; in short, to produce a work, which, within the com. pass of an ordinary volume, shall present the reader with the essential outline of the early history of Shropshire \u2014 such has been the endeavour of the author. How much of history is comprehended in the knowledge of topography ! How much of history is involved in the mere names of places ! Works of this nature supply the reader with the necessary facts from which he arrives at his conclusion respecting the past. It is only through the medium of such minute details, dry and fatiguing as their examination may appear to some, that the economy of the middle ages can be clearly understood ; and we venture to assert, that one perusal of a book of this kind will give the reader a more accurate notion of the Norman Conquest of England and the feudal period, than he could possibly derive from any general history, however ably written. A word now, in reference to those works relating to Shropshire and its antiquities, which have preceded this one, and to the labours of whose authors I must acknowledge myself very deeply indebted. First, there is Hartshorne's \" Salopia Antiqua, or an enquiry, from personal survey, into the Druidical, military, and other early remains in Shropshire and the North-western Borders,\" a work of distinguished merit. Next follows Owen and Blakeway's \" History of Shrewsbury,\" of the very highest order of excellence. Then Blakeway's \" Sheriffs of Shropshire ;\" Dukes' \" Antiquities of Shropshire ;\" Wright's admirable \" History of Ludlow ;\" and last, yet greatest of all, Eyton's \"Antiquities of Shropshire,\" which, commencing at Domesday, strictly speaking, is a manorial history of the county. Concerning this work, the erudite Thomas Wright has pronounced that it is, \" in its limits, the best local history that this country possesses.\" To this laborious and valuable undertaking, the author is specially indebted. In fact, the present book owes its existence to the circumstance of its publisher having become possessed of the wood-engravings which"], [14, "VIII adorned Eyton's pages. As only 300 copies were printed ol Eyton's \" Antiquities of Shropshire,\" it seemed a pity that cuts of such merit should lie idle, \u2014 hence the present publication, which, although largely indebted to Eyton's work, nevertheless, both in its system of arrangement, its rendering of Domesday, and in its subject-matter, assumes the form of an original production, as any one who will be at the trouble to compare the two works may convince himself of. Being foreign to the purpose of his under taking, the learned Eyton omits in his volumes all mention either of the Roman Wroxeter or the town of Shrewsbury. Recent investigations made on the site of the former, however, having concentrated public attention on this great Roman settlement on the Welsh border, it seemed essential that a page or two should be devoted to Uriconium or Wroxeter ; whilst the early history of the capital of Shropshire is so interesting and instructive, that a description of Shrewsbury forms an important feature in the present work. With respect to the notices of early Incumbents of the Churches of Shi opshire, the rule is to notice one only, and that one the earliest mentioned. Finally, to advert to the system of spelling names adopted in these pages. The names used are those of the original documents quoted, a variation of spelling is thus introduced, but the gradual changes which have occurred in our nomenclature are laid before the reader."], [15, "SHROPSHIRE.

It is supposed that we owe to the administrative abilities of Henry I. that reform, which, re-arranging the divisional system of Shropshire, swept away Alnodestreu Ilundred, with all its confusions, and assigned its various manors to the then newly created Hundreds of Stottesden, Brimstree, and Munslow. In Richard L's time, however, the Liberty of Wenlock sprang into existence, when that portion of Alnodestreu Hundred, which had been given to Munslow Hundred, and one manor out of Brimstree Hundred, viz., Badger, were retransferred to Wenlock. Membrefelde or Morville used to be caput or centre of the Hundred of Alnodestreu ; and here, consequently, was exercised that local jurisdiction which, together with the manor, realised \u00a3T0 annuals. Two-thirds of the curial income went, in Saxon times, to the Crown, and the remaining third to the Earl of Mercia. After the Conquest, the Norman earl took the whole profits of the Hundred Court. oPlOrUUlC, According to Domesday Book,1 the Norman Earl Roger de Montgomery held of the Crown the Manor of Membre felde, with its eighteen berewicks, or hamlets. King Edward had held it in Saxon times. Here were twelve hides. Of these hides, we are informed, that the Norman earl held four in demesne. A supplementary note indicates, however, that1 two out of the said four hides were held by Richard Pincerna, under the earl. The remaining eight hides had, in Edward the Confessor's time, con stituted the endowment of the collegiate church of St. Gregory of Membrefelde, in which ministered eight canons. But this church with five hides of its territory, had been given by the Norman earl to his newly founded monastery of St Peter, at Shrews bury. The other three hides, Earl Roger had given to his own chaplains. 1 \" Ipse Comes tenet Membrefelde cum xviii berewichis. Rex Edwardus tenuit. Ibi xii hid\u00e6.

Of the manor, he retained two hides in demesne ; two hides were held under him by Richard Pincerna ; five by the monks of Shrewsbury ; and three by his own chaplains. Domesday supplies us with certain facts as to the relative value, cultivation, and occupation, of these respective portions. In demesne (two hides) there were two ox-teams, and work for six more. Here were nine villains and six boors, with three teams ; and there was room for two more teams. Here were four neat herds. The annual value of this portion, including the revenue of the Hundred Court, was \u00a33. St. Peter's five hides employed in demesne two ox-teams, and totum reddebat x libros.

He says, \" After this, the king had a great consultation, and spoke very deeply with his witan concerning this land, how it was held, and what were its tenantry. He then sent his men over all England, into every shire, and caused them to ascertain how many hundred hides of landit contained, and what lands the king possessed therein; what cattle there were in the several counties, and how much re venue he ought to receive yearly from each. He also caused them to write down how much land belonged to his arch bishops, to his bishops, his abbots, and his earls; and, that I may be brief, what property every inhabitant of all England possessed, in land or in cattle, and how much money this was worth. So very narrowdy did he cause the survey to be made, that there was not a single hide nor a rood of land, nor \u2014 it is shameful to relate, that which he thought no shame to do \u2014 was there an ox, or a cow, or a pig passed by, and that was not set down in the accounts; and then all these writ ings were brought to him. \" \u2014 Anglo-Saxon Chron. p. 45S, Bonn's Ed. This work on the early history of Shrop shire embraces the entire Domesday sur vey of the county. The reader, therefore, has an opportunity of judging, so far as Shropshire is concerned, whether or not the Saxon writer of the foregoing was justified in his severe stricture on the Conqueror's great undertaking. \" Ecclesia hujus Manerii est in honore Sancti Gregorii, qu\u00e6 tempore Regis Ed wardi habebat de hac terra viii hidas, et ibi serviebant viii canonici.

(Cotton, MSS., Tib. A. xiij.) As the Commissioners travelled through the country, taking the survey, they examined sheriffs, barons, reeves of hundreds, priests, bailiffs, and even villains \u2014 in short, whoever they liked; but the de tailed information seems generally to have been derived from the answers of jurors empanneled from each Hundred. The result is the famous Domesday Booh,\\\\hich, as Hume has justly observed, is \" the most valuable piece of antiquity possessed"], [18, "4 might employ four more ; here were nine villains, one boor, and three priests, with nine teams among them ; here were also four neat-herds, and a knight who held a whole hide under the monks, at a rent of four shillings (per annum).

The total annual value was \u00a33 Is. 6d. Upon the two hides of land of this manor held by Richard Pincerna were one ox-team ; and two serfs, and seven villains had another team ; but the land was capable of employing nine more teams.

The church spoken of in Domesday, in connection with this Manor had been originally a Saxon Collegiate Church, attached to which was a parish of Aast extent ; but before the survey was taken, the Norman earl had given it to Shrewsbury Abbey. In 1118, the monks of Shrewsbury built a new church at Morville, and Geoffrey (de Clive), Bishop of Hereford consecrated it. As the day was remarkably fine, numbers flocked to the ceremonial. But, after the company had broken up, a tremendous thunderstorm suddenly arose. A party of five, two of whom were females, were overtaken by it on their way homewards, when a flash of lightning struck the two women and the five horses belonging to the party, and killed them.1 About 1138, Bishop Robert de Bctun granted an appropriation of Momerfeulde (Morville) Church to Shrewsbury Abbey, enjoining, at the same time, that it should be colonized with monks- from Shrewsbury, changeable at the abbot's discretion. Thus Morville became a priory subject to Salop Abbey, and not only it, but its chapels also ; for within eighty years after Domesday, no less than seven chapels had been built and endowed by the barons and knights of Shropshire, in the great parish of St. Gregory, These the bishop consecrated, as a \" protection for the poor, and having respect to the warlike troubles of the time \" \u2014 for it was the stormy and disastrous reign of the usurper Stephen. Shorn of its original influence, Morville remained a cell or priory of Shrewsbury Abbey until the Reformation. 1 Contin. of Florence of Wore.

Much difficulty has been experienced in identifying those eighteen berewicks or members, which, according to the Conqueror's survey, belonged to the Manor of Morville. The one mentioned in Domesday (supposed to be erroneously), described as Calvestone in Worcestershire, is believed to be Cold Weston, far to the south of Morville. We learn, from Salop Abbey Chartulary, the names of eight more of these berewicks. They were as follows : \u2014 Astley Abbots, a township which, at a very early period, engrossed to itself the manorial dignity of Morville, and the church of which, about 1138, styled the \" chapel of Estleya,\" yielded a pension of 8s. to Salop Abbey: Astley Parva ; Norley; Croft; Haughton; Ringslow, held, under the abbey, by a family of wealth and im portance, in the thirteenth century ; Harpswood, and Billingsley ; all of which were granted by the Norman earl Roger to Shrews bury Abbey. The latter then spelt Biligesleaye, according to some authorities is the place where, in 1055, Earl Harold, Edward the Confessor's vicegerent, held the Peace Conference with Griffin, Prince of Wales, and Algar, the rebel Earl of Mercia.

Quatford derives its name from the Saxon, epatpopb, Cwatford, in allusion to the neighbouring ford over the Severn. Under date 896, the Saxon Chronicle informs us, that, when King Alfred and the Londoners compelled the Danes to evacuate their stronghold by the River Lea, abandoning their ships, the bold Northmen traversed England until they came to Cwatbricge, by Severn, where they went into winter quarters. Florence of Worcester corroborates this account, when he describes the pagans as placing their wives for security in East Anglia, leaving those ships behind which the Anglo-Saxon King had contrived to obstruct the passage of into the Thames ; and making a forced march, on foot, as far as a place called Quattbrycge ; where, having built them selves a fortress, they passed the winter. \"In the summer season,\" continues this authority, \"part ofthe pagan army, which had wintered at Quattbrycge, went into East Anglia, and the other parts as far as Northumbria ;\" 3 committing dreadful ravages, doubtless, as they marched. 1 Salop Ckartulary, No. 334. 2 Domesday, so. 254, a 1. 3 Florence of Worcester.

About a quarter of a mile below the village, upon a rock pre cipitously overhanging the Severn, there are indications of a keep having formerly stood. Upon the side next the river, the rock rises nearly 100 feet perpendicularly above the Severn : where the rock slopes on the other sides, the fortress was surrounded by a curvilinear ditch, cut for nearly two hundred yards through the solid rock. This huge fosse, according to Hartshorne's measure ment, is three yards wide at the bottom, and at least four in depth below the average level of the meadow above it, whilst the summit of the keep upon the top of the rock is about twenty-five feet above the same level. There are indications of an inferior keep a little nearer the ford. Judging from existing remains, if this was the site of the Danish fortress alluded to by the chron icler, it is certain that the Normans afterwards occupied the same spot. The appearance is essentially Norman, and when, some years ago, by the directions of Mr. Smallman, of Quatford Castle, the semicircular fosse was cleared out, there were found embedded in the rubbish great quantities of red-deer bones and boar tusks, (trophies of its former Norman proprietors' hunting prowess), two small horse-shoes, and an iron spur of Norman character. Who, then, was the Norman proprietor of Quatford Castle ? undoubtedly, Roger de Montgomery, the Earl of Shrewsbury, who built it probably as a hunting residence ; for around Quatford then stretched the remains of the great prim\u00e6val forest. The Conqueror's survey speaks of a new house at Quatford,1 which expression clearly referred to Earl Roger's Castle, then, perhaps, in the course of erection. Ordericus Vitalis informs us,2 that, after Earl Roger's death, his son Robert de Belesme built a very strong castle at Bridgenorth, on the River Severn, and transferred the town and people of Quatford to the new fortress. Quatford Church. After the murder of his first Countess, Roger de Montgomery married Adelais, daughter of Ebrard de Pusey, one of the chief nobles of France. In contrast to his former wife, this lady, we are told, \" excelled in understanding and in piety, and oft per- 1 \"Nova Domus.\" '\u25a0> Eccl. Hist, of England and Normandy, Bk.

The Countess Adelais arrived in England in 1083-4. On her voyage to England, according to the legend, a storm shook the vessel in which she sailed to such a degree, that the mariners despaired of reaching land. It happened that a certain priest who was in her retinue, wearied by over- watching, fell into a slumber ; and as he slept, he dreamt that he s_tfw a matron standing before him, and thus addressing him ; \" If your mistress and her suite desire to be liberated from the instant danger of horrible shipwreck, let her make a vow to God, and promise faithfully to build a church in honour of the blessed Mary Magdalene, on the spot where it happens that she first meets the earl, her husband, and exactly where a hollow oak tree grows by a pigstye.\" The priest awoke, and told the particulars of his vision to the Lady Adelais, who, when she had heard them, vowed to perform everything fully. The storm ceased, and the lady reached the shore. Travelling inland to rejoin her lord, after many days she first met Earl Roger at Quatford, at the very spot where the oak tree, indicated in the vision, grew. She at once entreated her husband to aid her in carrying into execution the vow she had made when in danger of shipwreck. Earl Roger concurred ; and thus, according to the legend, Quatford Church was built and amply endowed. It is interesting to learn, that this romantic story l, credible in itself, has been found to be minutely consistent with other ascer tained facts. Originally collegiate, Quatford Church ceased to be such after Robert de Belesme transferred the castle and borough of Quatford to Bridgenorth. There remained for Quatford Church a parish identical with the Domesday Manor of Eardington. In 1291, the church here was worth under \u00a34 per annum, and, consequently, not taxable. It is uncertain whether or not the village of Quat ford was assessed to the ninth. Quatford Church is not mentioned in the Valor, of 1535. The architectural features of Quatford Church are interesting. It is supposed that the present church preserves the ground plan 1 Narrated in the Chronicle of John Bromton, pp. 9S8-9."], [30, "10 of the Norman earl's original found ation; although, with the exception of a small window on the north side of the chancel, and the chancel arch, which belong to the late Norman or transitional period ; there are no details earlier than the fourteenth century.

Between Quatford and the larger portion of the old Manor of Eardington flowed the Severn. We learn, from the cotemporary foundation-charter, that Eardington was included among those lands which the Norman earl gave to his collegiate church of Quatford. \" In time of King William,\" says this charter, \" Roger the earl and Adelaysa the countess built a church in Quatford, in honour of Our Lord Jesus Christ, and St. Mary Magdalene, and all the saints of God.

Only a small tenement in Eardington remained in lay hands ; it was the Moor 2 (the More Ridding), which was held in capite of the crown by the following curious kind oi petit serjeantry : \u2014 1 Salopia Antigua, p. 232. 2 It is supposed that the following entry in Domesday relates to this tene ment : \u2014 \"The Earl himself holds Bole bee. Slcnulf held it in King Edward's time. Here is half a hide, geldable. The arable land is for one ox team.

It was during that dreadful period, when Eng land, from one end to the other, groaned under the attacks of the heathen Northmen, that Ethelfleda, Lady of the Mercians, cast up, to stay the destructive ravages of the Danes, on the \" western bank of the River Severn, at the place which is called Brige,1\" a fortress. Ethelfleda, the Mercian heroine, possessed a large share of her father King Alfred's spirit, ruling over the province of Mercia with much vigour after the decease of Ethelred her husband. She died A.D. 918. The Danish and the Saxon rule had both passed away, when, after the conquest of England by the 'Normans, Roger de Mont gomery obtained the Earldom of Shrewsbury. To him succeeded Earl Hugh, and then Robert de Belesme became third and last Norman Earl of Shrewsbury. In him we have presented to us the very worst type of the ferocious Anglo-Norman noble ; and if con temporary accounts can be relied on, Robert de Belesme was little better than a monster. Able, active, and singularly cruel, \"having usurped the vast estates of his ancestors in Normandie and Maine, to the disherison of his brothers,\" by payment of \u00a33000, Robert obtained from Rufus the Earldom of Shrewsbury, when he exer cised great severities. In fact, the more he acquired, the prouder and more cruel he became, so that \" the English and Welsh, who had long treated as idle tales the accounts they had heard of his making his cruelties a jest, now tortured in his iron grasp, felt, to their sorrow, that the reports were true.\" 2 1 Roger de Hovenden. Saxon Chron. Florence of Worcester. 5 Ordericus Vitahs. Eccles. Hist, of Norm, and Eng. Bk. X. ch. vii."], [32, "12 It was this man who reared upon the site of the Saxon burg, or fortress, which the Lady of Mercia had erected, a Norman castle. One of the most able engineers of his day, Robert de Belesme, says the contemporary writer, \" built a very strong castle at Brigge, on the River Severn.\" Bridgenorth Castle was a fortress of the first class. It was between the tenth and fourteenth centuries, the period in which De Belesme built this stronghold, that feudalism erected its most important fortresses. Unlike those castles and defences of an earlier period, which were simply adjusted to the situation of an already existing town, oftimes but ill adapted by nature for defensive arrangements, the Norman De Belesme's fortress was a true feudal structure. Reared upon the most favour able site that could be chosen, its military architect took advantage of every configuration of the country : and there, high overhanging the banks of the Severn, the Castle of Bruge, with outworks, and a moat of correspondingly vast proportion, in days of yore bade defiance to the surrounding neighbourhood. Its ruins, could they speak, might tell of pageantries and banquets, as of many a secret tragedy enacted in the damp, dark dungeon ; or these stones, had they a tongue, might boastfully recall the stirring time when the iron storm of war rattled ineffec tually upon the surface of the grey and massive walls of Bridge north. Its revels are over; the miserable captive too has had his release ; and a hoary fragment is all that remains of the once famous stronghold. Robert de Belesme, with other Anglo-Norman nobles, conspired to dethrone King Henry I., and place the English sceptre in the hands of his elder brother, Robert Curthose. But the astute Henry accommodated matters between himself and his brave but indolent brother ; when, having broken up the Confederacy, he summoned De Belesme before his court, to answer many accu sations against him. The rebellious peer sought refuge in flight, when the king, proclaiming him an outlaw, assembled his forces and leading them northwards, attacked Bridgenorth. It was towards the autumn of 1102 that King Henry I. laid siege to De Belesme's castle, the defence of which had been entrusted to Roger, son of Corbet, Robert de Neuville, Ulger the Hunter, and a garrison of eighty mercenaries. Earl Robert himself retired to Shrewsbury, from whence he sallied to annoy the king. Yet all to no purpose. Owing to William Pantulf, that vassal whom the Norman earl had formerly so unrighteously oppressed, the king"], [33, "13 refused to listen to the specious arguments adduced in Dc Belesme's favour by his brother peers. The siege of Bridgenorth was vigor ously pressed, and, at the end of three months, its governors sur rendered the fortress to the king. This they did according to a preconcerted arrangement with Pantulf, shutting up the mercenary men-at-arms in one part of the fortress, whilst, at another, they \" let in the king's troops with a royal ensign, amidst the cheers of the townsmen.\" ' The stipendaries, however, obtained leave to depart with horses and arms, when, marching out of the fallen stronghold, they bitterly complained that they had been outwitted by their chiefs, whom they charged with treachery. When Robert de Belesme heard that Bridgenorth had fallen, he became almost frantic. After the capture of the castle, the king issued orders for his army to march by \"Hunel-hege,\" the dangerous pass of Wenlock Edge, and besiege Shrewsbury. \"This road,\" says Ordericus, who probably remembered it when a child, \"was for a thousand paces full of holes, and the surface rough with large stones, and so narrow that two men on horseback could scarcely pass each other. It was overshadowed on both sides by a thick wood, in which bowmen were placed in ambush, ready to inflict sudden wounds with hissing bolts and arrows, on the troops on their march. There were more than 60,000 infantry in the expe dition ; and the king gave orders that they should clear a broad track, by cutting down the wood with axes, so that a road might be formed for his own passage, and a public highway for ever after wards. The royal command was promptly performed, and vast numbers of men being employed, the wood was felled, and a very broad road levelled through it.\" 2 At length, driven to despair, Robert de Belesme surrendered at discretion. After consulting with his friends, he went to meet the king as he approached Shrewsbury, when, confessing his treason, he humbly laid the keys of the town at the king's feet, and sued for mercy. Thus Beauclerk reduced the turbulent noble, who was permitted to retire unmolested to Normandy. A shout of tumul tuous joy rang throughout England when it became known that the monster was banished. Boiling with rage, de Belesme crossed over to Normandy, when, like the dragon in the Apocalypse, says the chronicler, cast out of heaven, cruelly vented his wrath on the dwellers of the earth, so the last Norman Earl of Shrewsbury, Ordericus Vitalis, Bk. XI. ch. iii. 2 Ibidem,"], [34, "14 driven from England, spent his fury upon Normandy. Sweep ing their farms of all that could be carried off, he devoted them to the flames, and inflicted the torments of death or mutilation on all who fell into his hands. There is something appalling in the spectacle presented to us in the conduct of this implacable villain. To return. Upon the fall of De Belesme, the palatine Earldom of Shropshire escheated to Henry L, who, now combining in his own person both the Palatine and Royal dignities, governed the province by a viceroy, indifferently called Dapifer, Seneschall, and sometimes Sheriff, an office which posterity has assimilated to the wardenry of the Western Marches. His jurisdiction was not con fined to Shropshire, or even to the Marches of Wales; but it extended into Staffordshire, and probably into Herefordshire. Presiding over all causes, both ecclesiastical and temporal, his decisions were afterwards recognised by the crown as irreversible. In short, he was to the district he presided over, what, in the absence of the sovereign, the justiciar, or chief justice of a later period was to England. Such was the power accorded to his representative by the king in the lately escheated palatine Earldom of Shropshire ; the ordinary Sheriff or Sheriffs of the counties included in his province, however, still remained. The first to represent King Henry I. in this new capacity, was Richard de Belmeis. As to Bridgenorth, maintained as a royal castle, it became a seat of provincial government. On his Welsh expedition in 1121, Henry I. halted here, several of his charters about that period being dated at Brug. Tenacious of office and power, at length De Belmeis' increasing maladies totally incapacitated him from discharging his vice-regal duties, and, retiring to the Priory of St. Osyth, in Essex, which he had founded, he died there. Pagan, or Pain Fitz John then held court at Bridgenorth, as the king's representative, in the earlier years of whose provincial power Bridgenorth became the temporary prison of Walleran, Earl of Mellent, whom Henry had brought over from Normandy. In 1128 this stronghold became the prison of Meredyth ap Lhywarch, who had been given up by Lhewelyn ap Owen. From the Pipe Roll of 1130, we learn, that Milo de Gloucester, Sheriff of that county, had sent a quantity of wine by the king's order to Brug. Sending of wine was a usual item of sheriff's accounts, and this was undoubtedly for the king's use."], [35, "TONG CHURCH,"], [36, ""], [37, "15 The close of Stephen's reign found Hugh de Mortimer, of Wig more, of the Usurper's party, seised of the Castle of Bridgenorth. Upon the accession of Henry IL, this proud baron refused to do homage, and, fortifying Bridgenorth, bad defiance to the king. But Henry quickly led his forces westward against the recusant noble, and, detaching from him his confederate, Roger, Earl of Hereford, who held the \" Tower of Gloucester,\" forthwith the active king laid siege to Mortimer's three Castles of Wigmore, Cleobury, and Brug. Cleobury, after a short siege, the king took and destroyed, when the crest-fallen Mortimer surrendered up Bridgenorth and Wigmore to his sovereign. Bridgenorth having been recovered, from this period it served both as a fortress, a prison, and a royal residence. We may infer what the castle originally was, from the following items, culled from the Shropshire Pipe Rolls, relative to its repairs in the respective years mentioned. At Michaelmas, 1166, the sheriff accounts 6s. 8d. for repairs of the \" Well of Brug ; \u2014 a good well was an indispensable requisite in every castle. In 1167, in obe dience to the king's writs, \u00a330 13s. 4d. was expended on the works of the \"Tower of Brug;\" in 1168, \u00a314 5s. 6d. ; and a further sum of \u00a326 6s. 4d. accounted for in the following year. In 1169, \u00a315 8s. 6d. for the same object, and so on, until during the thirty-four years Henry II. was in seisin of Bridgenorth, the recorded expenditure for repairs and additions amounted to \u00a3213, a sum equivalent to about \u00a310,000 of the present time. During the reign of Richard I., the expenditure was in pro portion. Among the expences connected with Bridgenorth Castle in the time of John, the work charged for in 1212, is specified to have been at the \"barbican and draw-bridge.\" Yet, as when, through the Anglo-Norman period, Bridgenorth frowned in its might, we have no direct evidence. The earliest description of this castle is supplied by John Leland, the antiquary, who visited it about the middle of the 16th century. \" The castle,\" he says, \" standeth on the south part of the towne, and is fortified by east with the profound valley (of the Severn) instead of a ditch. The walles of it be of a great height. There were two or three stronge wardes in the castle, that nowe goe totally to ruine. I count the castle to be more in compasse than the third part of the towne,\" then about a mile round. \" There is,\" he continues, \"one mighty gate by north in it, now stopped up, and a litle posterne made of force thereby through the wall, to enter into the castle."], [38, "16 The castle ground, and especially the base court, hath now many dwelling-houses of tymbre in it, newly erected.\"1 The sheriff of Shropshire was usually e\u00e6-officio keeper of the two castles of Bridgenorth and Shrewsbury, the constable or chief resident officer in each in ordinary times being appointed by him. Occasionally, however, the Crown immediately nominated the constable. Besides this officer, there was a porter or warder at Bridgenorth, whose office likewise was permanent, and, in time of peace, perhaps half-a-dozen castellans as a regular garrison. There was no necessity for a greater number, as, in war-time, castle-guard service was due from neighbouring tenants of the Crown. Bridgenorth Castle served also the purposes of a prison, and a palace. In June, 1163, Henry II. invaded South Wales, and, having ravaged Caermarthenshire, Rees, prince of South Wales, came to him at \" Pencadayr beside Brecknock, and did him homage and gave him pledges.\" Accordingly, both at Michael mas, 1163, and also in the two following years, the sheriff of Shropshire charges for the maintenance of hostages at Brug, in the latter year \u00a34 12s., being charged for the keep of twenty five hostages. In 1173-4, England, being greatly disturbed by the unnatural rebellion of Prince Henry, Guy le Strange, sheriff of Shropshire, charged for victualling the castle of Brug, for 92 horse loads of corn \u00a39 Os. 6d. ; for 120 hogs \u00a310 4s. ; for 120 cheeses \u00a32 6s. 8d. ; and for 20 horse-loads of salt 10s. Total outlay, \u00a322 5s. 2d. Having frustrated the machinations of his enemies, Henry II. made a progress throughout his kingdom, the ostensible object of which was the punishment of all those who, during the late troubles, had trespassed on the royal forests. It is presumed, that during the course of this progress, the king visited Bridgenorth. King John was at Bridgenorth Castle upon the 11th and 13th of November, 1200, with a noble retinue, such as none but a fortress of the first-class could have accommodated. John also stayed here on the 13th, 14th, and 15th of March, 1204. In the king's train were the Bishops of Lincoln and Hereford, the Earls of Essex, Pembroke, Chester, Salisbury, Warren, Leicester, Warwick, and Hereford ; also William de Braose, the provost of Beverley, Hugh de Nevill, and William de Briwere, with their respective suites. 1 Leland's Itinerary, Vol. IV. part ii. so. 182, a"], [39, "17 King John's writ is extant in which he orders his treasurer and chamberlains to deliver to Geoffrey Fitz-Piers (sheriff of Shrop shire) \u00a340, which said Geoffrey had paid in the King's Chamber, to discharge the king's expenses at Brug.\" Again, in 1212, King John visited Bridgenorth, and under the following circumstances. The disunited Welsh princes, soldering up their petty feuds for the moment, had laid siege to the castle of Mathraval in North Wales, defended by Robert de Vipont, one of John's most active lieutenants. Retribution for crimes of deepest dye at length had overtaken King John. He had been expelled from his French provinces ; his unhappy kingdom lay under an interdict ; his nobles openly defied his authority. Altogether the affairs of John were in a most desperate condition. Yet, sur rounded as he was with appalling difficulties, the following well attested facts will serve to dispel the too generally received notion that John was at all times a coward and incapable. On Thursday, July 26th, 1212, John passed from Bristol to Melkesham, Wilts, from whence he sent \u00a3300 to the sheriff of Herefordshire \" to succour Robert de Vipont, who was besieged in Wales.\" Next day the king was at Devizes and Ludgarshall, both in Wilts. On the 29th, he was at Winchester. It was Sun- day. That same day he passed back to Marlborough, AVilts ; reached Tewkesbury on the 30th, and was at Worcester on the 31st. On the 1st of August, he travelled from Worcester to Bridgenorth, upon which journey the sumpter-horse that carried the king's bed broke down and was left at Bridgenorth. We learn, also, that two of the king's valets, with their jaded horses and attendants, the king's falconer with his hawks, the two carters and four sumpterers who carried the king's wardrobe, with their nine horses, accompanied the king's march no further. Certain coffers, which contained relics, were also left by the king at Bridgenorth, over which, during the three nights they remained there, wax candles were burnt at the superstitious king's expense. On the following morning, Thursday, the 2nd of August, the king, in urgent need of both horse and knight, ordered 60s. to be given to Buchard de Gratelon, whose horse in pawn at Brug was forth- with redeemed ; when, that same day, spurring his slender troop more than fifty miles over bad roads, and in the dead heat of summer, right into Wales, John Plantagenet raised the siege of Mathraval, and levelled its castle to the ground. On the following day he returned to Bridgenorth. It was Friday ; but the king ate c"], [40, "18 meat twice, for which he atoned by feeding a hundred paupers with bread, fish, and beer.1 Notwithstanding tremendous exertions, the prospects of the king grew darker daily. Yet Shropshire and the western counties held fast their loyalty to the last ; the storm, meanwhile, closing over the devoted head of John. On the 14th and 15th of August, 1216, the king made his final sojourn with his faithful castellans of Bridgenorth. Bereft of the larger portion of his kingdom, deserted even by Longespee who, like the other barons, had at length done homage to the French Prince Louis ; a prey to anxiety ; an ill-timed and fatiguing march across the Wash of Lincolnshire, in which, by the sudden rising of the tide, he lost both baggage and regalia, as well as many valuable records, threw the unhappy king into a fever, of which he died at Newark, October 18th, 1216. His heart was deposited in a golden urn at Font Evraud ; but his body, by King John's dying request, was carried to Worcester, where a noble monument commemorates his unchanging attachment to the faithful city. Bridgenorth Castle was visited by Henry III. both in 1221 and in 1223. Among many notices connected with Bridgenorth, it may be observed, that, the Inquiries of the King's Commissioners in 1255 led to several statements relative to the castle. The Borough Jury reported, that when the king was at Brug, the lord of Albrighton was bound to find fuel for the castle, that being the service due on his fee of Little Brug, and the lord of Bobbington and Quat owed ward to the castle in time of war, \u2014 that, as long1 as the kino held in hand the Manor of Worfield, the produce of hay and of the mills there used to come to the castle, and the tenants of that Manor used to do Ilirson in time of war, ancl take up their quar ters in the castle for ward thereof if required. During the civil convulsions that characterised the close of the third Henry's reign, \" by Council of the Magnates,\" that is, by coercion of the Committee of Reform appointed by the \" Mad Parliament\" of Oxford, the imbecile Henry III. granted custody of the castle of Brug to Peter, son of the arch-rebel Simon de Montfort. The confederate barons, however, do not appear to have long retained possession of Bridgenorth, as we learn that James D'Audley, the royalist sheriff of Shropshire, on July, 1261, 1 Itinerary of King John, see preface to the patent Rolls of that King's reign, by T. Duffus Hardy, Esq."], [41, "19 laid out 100 merks in corn, and victualled the castle. Every ex ercise of the kingly prerogative being keenly contested by the con federates for some years about this time, it is difficult to decide who were the bond fide constables of Bridgenorth, or even the real sheriffs of Shropshire. Appointments and re-appointments succeeding each other in rapid succession, accordingly as either party obtained the ascendancy. Yet, from the records which have come down to us, it appears certain, that \" the goodmen and true \" of Shropshire were hearty royalists, assuming the offensive against Montfort's nominees. Hamo le Strange, a royalist, seems to have been in possession of Bridgenorth throughout this stormy period. After the battle of Evesham, which blasted the hopes of the confederates, and restored the king to his prerogative, the gratified Henry favoured Shropshire with a visit ; and great were the re joicings at Bridgenorth, the sheriff accounting no less a sum than \u00a330 8s. 4d. which he had paid for corn, oats, oxen, and sheep supplied on the occasion of the king's late visit to the castle. With respect to Bridgenorth Castle as a prison, a couple of notices will suffice ; and these will show what good old times they were in which our Anglo-Norman ancestors lived. To an enquiry made in 1274, as to the excesses of public officers, the Jurors of the Borough replied, that Robert Trillee, under-sheriff of Shropshire, maintained \"certain satellites, who wrongfully extorted money \" from messengers and other travellers on the king's highway.\" \" The same Robert had caused these satellites to seize Richard de Dodemonston at midnight and carry him about from one wood to another, threatening his life ; which Richard offered a fine of three merks payable to Trillee, if he might be taken to the castle prison of Brug, with his head on his shoulders.\" Hugh de Don vile, constable of Bridgenorth, and also bailiff of Stottesden in 1274, was accused of many excesses of power. Donvile, backed by his brother and others, kept an approver1 in the castle prison, \" who impeached many faithful subjects and harmless men for the sake of lucre.\" Nor did the scoundrel oppress the innocent only ; he allowed the guilty to escape. By his connivance, Henry le Pleidour, an outlaw, whom Donvile had arrested in Shropshire, got off by 1 The approver was a most formidable instrument of feudal oppression. He was a self-confessed felon, an informer, and a bravo.

Calling himself John de Womburne, the criminal appealed to a Stafford shire jury, who, knowing nothing about him, of course acquitted him. As to what money Donvile got for his connivance in the job none of the jurors could tell. So much for Bridgenorth Castle. The Borough of Bridgenorth. This is presumed to have been a foundation immediately consequent on the transfer of the castle from Quatford, in 1101. Speaking of De Belesme's succession to his brother's earldom, the Norman chronicler says, \" Having thus secured it, he exercised great cruelties on the Welsh, during four years. He built a very strong castle at Bridgenorth, on the River Severn, transferring the town and people of Quatford to the new fortress.\" 1 From the confirmation of its privileges by King Henry II. it appears that the new borough was recognised by Henry I. The following is the purport of a document which merits attention, from the circumstance, that it is the earliest written charter im plying royal recognition of any Shropshire borough : \u2014 \"Henry, King of England, and Duke of Normandy and Aquitaine, and Earl of Anjou, to his Justiciars, and Sheriffs, and Barons, and Ministers, and all his faithful of England, greeting. Know ye, that I have conceded to my Burgesses of Brugia, all their franchises, and customs, and rights, which they or their ancestors had in the time of King Henry, my grandfather. Wherefore, I will and strictly command that they have them, well and in peace, and honourably and fully ; within the Borough and without, in wood and in field, in meadows and pastures, and in all things, with such comparative fulness and honour as they held them in the time of King Henry, my grandfather. And I forbid any one to do them injury or insult, in regard to their tene ments. \u2014 Witnesses: T. Chancellor and Henry de Essex, Constable, and Wm. Fitz Alan : at Raddemore.\" Eyton assigns the year 1157 as the probable date of the fore going. The reader must not forget, however, that Shrewsbury was a much older borough than Bridgenorth, yet it has no charter earlier than that of Richard I. It may be added, that, according to a great authority, there are no examples of civil incorporations in England, except London, till the reign of Henry II. 2 1 Ordericus Vitalis, B.

According to Madox, \" The yearly Ferme of towns arose out of certain locata or demised things that yielded issues or profit. Insomuch that when a town was committed to a sheriff, fermer, or custos, such fermer or custos well knew how to raise the ferine out of the ordinary issues of the town, with an overplus of profit to himself.\" But Bridgenorth soon escaped out of the clutches of the sheriff, and obtained the privilege of paying its own ferme or chief rent directly to the crown, without being subject to the extortion of an intermediate officer ; as we learn, that at Michaelmas, 1170, the burgesses of Brug and Salop had fined with the Crown, in sums of twenty and eighteen merks respectively, \"for having the ferme of their vills \" \u2014 each had paid the said fine and was quit. The terms on which the burgesses of Brug obtained this privilege were, that they should pay 2^ merks per annum in addition to the quota of \u00a35, which for ten years previously they had contributed to the general ferme of the county.1 Yet not until the burgesses of Bridgenorth had again fined in a sum of thirty merks, and two coursers, \"to have their town at ferm,\" did they realize, to its full extent, their privilege. According to the Pipe Roll of the year ending Michaelmas, 1176, in that year the burgesses rendered their first annual account of the full ferme of their vill. It was 10 merks, namely, 7| (\u00a35) which they used to pay through the sheriff, and 1\\ merks the \" increment of their vill,\" which they had already paid for five years themselves. At this juncture, King Henry began to issue writs to the burgesses, which are in the nature of drafts on their annual debt ; the first of which in that very year directing them to make a payment \"in corrody (entertainment) of his sister, the wife of David ap Owen,\" which draft the burgesses duly respected and took credit for it in their own account with the Exchequer. Yet, besides the annual contribution to the royal revenue, this borough, as a demesne of the Crown, was subject to other imposts, and every now and then, under the title of a donum, Bridgenorth 1 Rot.

That Bridgenorth was a corporate town in 1180 may be inferred from the circumstance that Ranulph de Glanvill, the Justiciar visiting Shropshire in that year, left the burgesses of Brug subject to the heavy amercement of 20 merks. They had made a false aver ment, rerjorting a suit as compounded which was not compounded: the burgesses were amerced corporately for a return which could only have been made in their own Borough Court. It appears that this court took primary cognizance of certain legal matters beyond the usual routine of self-government, there fore the burgesses of Brug had special privileges. At the county assizes of 1203, the earliest of which we have detailed records, the Borough of Brug as being among those hundreds or boroughs claiming an exclusive jurisdiction was summoned to send its jury. From the report of it, we glean that the \" assize of cloth \" was not held in the borough.1 A second royal charter was obtained for this borough in 1215. About this time, the burgesses of Brug- began to encircle their town with a stockade or barrier of woodwork, a precaution ne cessitated by the disturbed character of the period, allowances of timber for the purpose being made out of the royal forest of Mors. Again, in May, and also in June, 1220, Henry III. granted timber to the loyal burgesses, out of the \"royal forest near Bruges,\" to assist them in the enclosure of their town. To enable them to complete their defences, the king also empowered the burgesses to charge on every cart bringing things into the town for sale, and if such cart came from another county Id. Other tolls were specified on pack-horses, cattle, and barges ; the right of enforcing all which was granted them from June 24th, 1220, until the end of four years following, the license constituting, says Eyton, an early instance of a royal grant to take \" customs \" or \" murage.\" In November, 1222, the Borough of Brug was among those whose bailiffs were addressed on the subject of the aid granted by the King in Council for the King of Jerusalem.2 It is the first 1 The Assize of Cloth was an ancient statute regulating the measure and price of such manufactures. Its non-obser- vance, in any borough, subjected the same to a fine. 3 It was the period of the 6th crusade."], [45, "23 positive recognition which occurs of the bailiffs or provosts of the town. We read, that on September 1st, 1226, King Henry III. having just left Bridgenorth, granted, until he came of age, to the men of Bruges, an annual fair of three days' duration, namely, \"the vigil, the day and the morrow of St. Luke the Evangelist, unless some neighbouring fair be thus interfered with \" It will be recollected, that Henry III. declared himself of age at the Council of Oxford, in February, 1227, and announced to all privileged bodies the necessity of having their charters renewed, by which he netted over a \u00a3100,000. Accordingly, the burgesses of Bridgenorth applied to the king to have theirs renewed, which Henry, for a consideration, graciously granted. Stephen de Segrave and his fellow justiciars, sitting at Glouces ter in 1227, amerced the vill of Brug in one merk \" for the flight of Osbert le Puleter,\" a felon, whose escape had not been prevented. This was demurred to, however, by the burgesses as an encroach ment on their liberties. They claimed exemption from making trace (pursuit, hue or cry), through their town after felons, and there is no notice taken of the liquidation of the item. On August 10th,' 1256, this borough obtained its fourth and fifth charters from the Crown. At loggerheads with his barons, the kino- confirmed and extended the liberties of his faithful burgesses of Bridgenorth, doubtless in anticipation of the aid he required and afterwards received from them. On the other hand, Simon de Montfort, the opponent of the lawless Henry III., out-bade the kino- for popularity by summoning two knights from each shire, and deputies from boroughs, to attend the National Council \u2014 the origin of the British House of Commons. This, the great leader of the barons in rebellion against Henry III., did in the year 1265 ; and thus, in the hands of Providence, a squabble between a worthless king and a band of selfish feudal lords, was the means of vastly extending the freedom of the down-trodden people. Upon the termination of the civil war, in recognition of their devotion to his cause, and \" for the losses which they had sustained in the time when the kingdom was disturbed, and because they faithfully- adhered to the king and to Edward his son,\" Henry III. renewed to the burgesses their long-expired licence to take customs or murage, and excused them various sums of money which they owed to the Crown. Enough, however, has been said respecting the Borough of Bridgenorth."], [46, "24 Among the first recorded Members of Parliament for this borough were Andrew Bolding (provost of Bridgenorth in 1294), and Fremund de Erdinton, who were summoned to the Parliament which met in November, 1295. Their manucaptors were Robert Tinctor, Robert Crowk, John Glydde, and Roger Bonamy. Roger Bonamy and Thomas de Isenham appear as burgesses of the Par liament which was summoned for May 25th, 1298, to York. Their manucaptors were John Glydde, Simon Dod, Roger de la More, and Andrew Bolding. Roger Bonamy, provost or chief bailiff of Bridgenorth, with Richard Robert, provost of Bridgenorth in 1299, were returned as burgesses for the Parliament which was summoned to meet at Lincoln on January 20th, 1301. These ex provosts were both returned as members for the Parliament which was summoned to London for September 29th, 1303. ' Church of St. Mary Magdalene. Associated with the. religious history of Bridgenorth and its suburbs, first in importance and antiquity stood this church. When Robert de Belesme transferred the castle and people of Quatford to the stronger fortress he had reared on the banks of the Severn, he removed also the collegiate church his father had so richly endowed ; henceforth, therefore, the dean and preben daries of St. Mary Magdalene performed their sacred offices in the chapel built within the precincts of Bridgenorth Castle. From the Sheriff's account, we learn that on the accession of Henry IL, the canons of Brug were entitled to a recognised com position or payment of 10s. per annum in lieu of the tithes of the king's demesne, which sum continued to be paid and charged in each annual account of the sheriff, .until the year 1176, when, the king ordered the burgesses of Brug to pay the 10s. to the canons of St. Mary. Henceforth, therefore, they made the payment annually, and took credit for it in their account with the Exche quer. The church of St. Mary Magdalene enjoyed all those privileo-es and immunities which attached to royal free-chapels. From a petition of the burgesses of Brug to the Parliament of Winchester in 1330, praying that they might have the use of the King's Chapel as a parish church, it would seem that originally no parochial cure had been attached to it. The collegiate body consisted of six prebendaries, generally non- 1 Parliamentary Writs, vol. I."], [47, "25 resident ; the superiority of the dean appearing nominal only. The immunities claimed by the church of St. Mary Magdalene extended to all the churches and chapels which belonged to its prebendaries. At the Salop Assizes, November, 1221, the jurors of the borough and hundred of Bruges returned the church of St. Mary of Brug as of the king's gift, and that there were six prebends therein, which six clerks held by gift of the king and his ancestors. In 1228, a precept issued to the sheriff .of Shropshire, commanding him to allow to this chapel all tithes of the king's demesnes of Brug in fairs and mills. By a patent of 1246, King Henry ordered the canons of Bruges to render obedience to their dean Peter de Rivallis, in the matter of remedying deficiencies in the decorations of their chapel : \u2014 the collegiate body sadly at variance, neglect of the sacred edifice appears to have been the consequence. In 1254, the dean of the King's Chapel of Brug was commis sioned by letters patent to assist Bernard de Nynipha to collect certain moneys from those who had vowed the crusade for the use of the Earl of Cornwall. This prince, brother of Henry III., was undoubtedly the hero of the seventh crusade, which took place in 1240-1. Dugdale1 says, that the earl went a second time to the Holy Land, accompanying William Longespee, and that he again returned thence in 1242. The statement, however, does not appear founded on fact. Yet, even if it were, it is admitted on all hands, that the Earl of Cornwall never afterwards went to Palestine. How comes it then, that, in 1254, the dean of Brug was commissioned to collect moneys from those who had vowed the crusade for his use ? The cruce signali, or those who vowed the crusade, were permitted to compound the obligation by money payments, which, collected under papal authority, were supposed to be allotted to those who personally fulfilled their vows. It was a common occurrence at this period for the Pope, by means of his emissaries, to proclaim a crusade ; in furtherance of which he was accustomed to furnish to the King of England a mandate, the purport of which was, that the Holy Father \" by virtue of the authority given him from God,\" granted to the king enormous tithes of the whole English church, to provide, as was said, necessaries for the king's pilgrimage. King Henry worked in concert with the Pope, and when our country had been well 1 Baronage."], [48, "26 drained of its gold, the Holy Father and the equally unscrupulous king, neither of whom had the most remote intention of applying the money to the purpose for which it had been collected, shared it between them. Or England was fleeced thus : \u2014 the Pope so arranged matters with the money-loving Earl of Gornwall, that, \" with averted eyes and closed ears,\" he stood by whilst the Holy Father \u2014 \"kisses to his blessed feet\" \u2014 riddled his country. It was a profitable speculation this for Earl Richard, who, although not intending to go on pilgrimage, from one archdeaconry alone is said to have carried off \u00a3600. Nor was the earl over particular as to the way in which his agents went to work to cash the Pope's order, for, under date of 1250, M. Paris observes, that Bernard de Nympha (the man alluded to), a clerk armed with the papal documents, collected a large sum of money from the crusaders for the use of Earl Richard, in such a dishonourable way, that it appeared robbery rather than justice. To return to the king's free chapel in the castle of Brug. Secure in its independence, it does not appear that the Bishops of Lichfield ever held ordinations there. The visit of Master Rigaud de Asserio, Clerk of the Papal Chamber, to England in 1317, however, threatened the rights of several royal free chapels, in cluding Bruges and St. Mary's, Salop. This agent of Pope John XXII. was authoritatively commanded, in spite of all cus toms, privileges, and indulgences, to enforce the neglected collec tion of Peter's Pence in England ; but King Edward II. interfered in defence of his free chapels, and forbade the nuncio to enforce his exactions against those establishments. The taxation of 1291 values the spiritualities of the church of Bruges and its members at \u00a354 13s. 4d. From the \" Inquisition of the Ninth,\" taken in 1341, the dean and canons of Brug were specially exempted. Among the Deans of St. Mary Magdalene, Alexander, clean of Brug, 1161-1171, appears the earliest. On the 13th Aprd, 1214, a Poictevin of the name of Hugo or Hugh de Tanney, was appointed to this deanery by John \u2014 the king's object being, as he avows in his grant, that the friends of the presentee \" who are very necessary to the king in the parts of Poictou, may be placed under obligation.\" Of the dean who succeeded this one a more lengthened notice is required. Appointed to the deanery of the chapel of Brug in 1223, Peter"], [49, "27 de Rivallis, a Poictevin by descent, was ostensibly the nephew, but in reality the son of, that Peter de Rupibus, Bishop of Win chester, the corrupt but powerful minister, first of King John, and afterwards of Henry III. Upon the downfall of the great Hubert de Burgh, in 1232, de Rivallis, through the influence of his rela tive, was appointed \" Treasurer of the Chamber,\" an office which gave, says Eyton, \" custody of all the Crown escheats and ward ships, and his success in replenishing the royal coffers was most unequivocal.\" By an extraordinary patent, dated July 2nd, 1232, this Poictevin dean of Brug was granted the custody ( shrievalty) of Shropshire and Staffordshire for life, and also that of the counties of York, Berks, Gloucester, Somerset, Dorset, Devon, Lancaster, Northumberland, Essex, Herts, Lincoln, Norfolk, Suffolk, and Kent.1 In fact, Henry the Third was infatuated, and having dismissed all his former counsellors, according to the cotemporary chronicler,2 the weak monarch \" put confidence in no one except the aforesaid Bishop of Winchester and his son Peter de Rivallis ; after which he ejected all the castellans throughout all England, and placed the castles under the charge of the said Peter.\" It was the misfortune both of Henry the Third and his mis guided father John, that they preferred to be surrounded with foreigners rather than be led by the counsels of their own subjects, who, born within the realm, had a great interest in its govern ment. King Henry's Poictevin and Gascon favourites were for the most part needy adventurers, who flourished by advising him to measures obnoxious to the great body of his barons. Those high-mettled potentates could ill-brook the indignity of seeing aliens whom they despised preferred before them to the highest offices, and still less were they inclined to submit to be arbitrarily taxed at the caprice of a tyrannical monarch to support the extravagance of a set of dissipated foreign courtiers. True, these very murmurers themselves were of foreign extraction, and scarce 200 years had yet passed since their ancestors had landed with Duke William on the English shore ; and the great separating line between the conquering Norman and the subject Saxon and Danish people was still distinctly visible. But time had begun to soften down those feelings of bitter animosity with which the opposing races had for so long a period regarded each other, and of late, 'Pat. 16 Hen. II I. - Roger de Wendover."], [50, "28 both bent on curbing the abuse of irresponsible power, and mutually needing assistance, had drawn nearer together. The Great Charter, won by their united exertions, and framed for their common benefit, was the first pledge of their reconcilia tion. Foremost among the haters of the system represented by the elevation of the alien Dean of Brug, was the chivalric Richard Marshal. He had suffered in person by the ascendancy of this man and his minions. His lands had been confiscated to them, and other indignities heaped on him through their advice, and accord ingly the baron bore them a mortal antipathy. Confederating, then, with Llewellyn, Prince of North Wales, Marshal attacked the king's troops, and defeating John de Monmouth, who ineffec tually endeavoured to oppose his progress, at length he laid waste Shropshire, the county in which De RivaUis was chiefly interested, and sacked and fired Shrewsbur}'. It was a dreadful sight, says the chronicler, to see in the lanes and meadows of England the corpses of the slain, whose naked and unburied bodies afforded car rion for the kites. At length, Peter de Rivallis and his alien uncle had recourse to guile, to do that which, by fair means, they could not accomplish. \" They wrote letters,\" says Roger de Wendover, \" and forced the king, although ignorant of their purport, to set his seal to them,\" These letters, addressed to Fitz-Gerald and other magnates in Ireland, announced the forfeiture and proscrip tion of the earl, and promised them that if they could bring Marshal, dead or alive, to the king, the earl's inheritance in Ireland shoidd be shared amongst them. The plot succeeded. To entice the earl over to Ireland, his lands were invaded by the treacherous lords of Ireland, of which no sooner had Marshal intelligence than he crossed the channel with only fifteen knights in his train. Notwithstanding the inferiority of Marshal's force, at first success attended his efforts, but at length he was entrapped into an engagement against fearful odds. Choosing, however, rather to die on the field with honour, than quit it in disgrace, the brave earl deliberately arranged his little band, and, exhorting them to quit themselves like men, he inspired them with the noble reflec tion, that if they fell, they died for justice and the sake of English laws ; then, lowering his lance into its rest, he heroically dashed into the thickest of his enemies. Determined to sell life dearly, desperate were his efforts ; but at length, hard driven, his horse"], [51, "29 being killed under him, and overwhelmed, Marshal was stabbed in the back, and carried prisoner to his own castle. There, as he lay wounded, his cruel enemies required of him his castles and lands ; and, whilst he hesitated, they produced the forged charter. At seeing it, Marshal became much excited, and neglecting his wounds, a physician whom his enemies had summoned, \" with a long heated instrument, laid his wounds open and probed them so often and deeply with it \" says the cotemporary historian, that his acute sufferings flung him into a fever, and clasping the cross deliriously to his bosom, Marshal died. Thus, through the cunning of the Dean of Bridgenorth and other aliens, fell, on April 16th, 1234, in the prime of his life, \" the flower of chivalry in that age.\" S Meanwhile, the high hand with wliich his Poictevin favourites were carrying affairs, had awakened a tempest that threatened to involve both Henry the Third ancl his ministers in a common de struction. At a council held at Westminster, in February previously, the Bishops, with Edmund elect of Canterbury at their head, had informed the King, that the counsel which \"Peter, Bishop of Winchester, and Peter de Rivallis\" gave him was neither wise or safe, but \"dangerous to the whole kingdom;\" and that Marshal's insurrection would not have occurred if his people had been governed by law and justice. Continuing to address the weak monarch, they warmly added: \"There is scarcely any business of importance in the kingdom transacted under your seal, or by your warrant, without being also under the seal and by the warrant of Peter de Rivallis, from which it is clear they (yoijr subjects) do not consider you in the light of a king.\" Henry III. preferred to sacrifice his favourites rather than him self; so, promising the prelates that he would yield to their coun sels, he ordered the Bishop of Winchester to his Bishopric, and dismissed the Poictevins. As to Peter de Rivallis, the facile Henry at once stripped him of his trusts, declaring, with an oath, \" that, if he were not a beneficed person, and admitted to the rights of the clergy, he would order his two eyes to be torn out.\" The king's indignation reached its climax on receipt of the news of \" the murder of the marshal,\" when, by the direction of his new council, Henry demanded of the late ministers not only an account of all moneys they had received, bjit also of their misuse of his seal. Upon this, overwhelmed with affright, Peter de Rivallis and his former colleague fled to the sanctuary at Winchester for refuge."], [52, "30 At length, under a safe conduct, they appeared before the king at Westminster. Peter de Rivallis was brought up for trial first. He came before the court \" in a clerical dress, with his head shaved, and wearing a broad chaplet, and reverently greeted the king, who was sitting on the bench with the justiciaries. The king, eyeing him with a scowling look, thus addressed him : ' Traitor,' said he, ' by your evil advice, I unknowingly affixed my seal to letters containing treacherous designs against the marshal. It was also by your evil counsel that I banished him and others of my natural subjects from my kingdom, and thus estranged their affections and regard from me ; and by your ill-advice was it, that I made war against them, and have wasted my own money, as well as that of my subjects.' He also demanded of him an account of his treasury, and of the wardship of youths of noble families entrusted to his care, as also of escheats, and several other revenues incident to the crown. When the king had thus accused him of these and many other offences, and charged him with treachery, he did not deny any of the charges brought against him, but, prostrating himself on the ground before the king, implored his mercy. ' My lord king,' he said, ' I was brought up and enriched in worldly pro perty by you ; therefore, do not destroy the man you have made, rather give me time for deliberation, that I may be able to give you a due account respecting the things demanded of me.' \" To this, the king replied : ' I will send you to the Tower of London, there to consider on the matter, in order to give me a proper account.' \" Peter replied : ' My lord, I am a priest, and ought not to be imprisoned or consigned to the custody of laymen.' \" The king then said: ' The archbishop is here, and if he will be come security for you, I will give you into his charge, in order that you may give me a proper answer to my demands.' \" \" To speak briefly,\" adds Roger de Wendover, \" the king sent him to the Tower, and took charge of all his lay possessions ; for, under his clerical habit, he was armed with a coat of mail, which was not befitting a clerk.\" Having been kept in the Tower two days, the archbishop then restored Peter to sanctuary at Winchester. King Henry's wrath, simulated probably to clear himself of the odium attaching itself to the foul murder of Marshal, lasted only a short time. In June, 1236,<1.Peter, Dean of Bridgenorth, with his alien relative, were restored to the royal favor, de Rivallis in 1249 appearing as joint custos of the Great Seal, during the tem-"], [53, "31 porary absence of the chancellor from Court ; and from November, 1256, to April, 1258, occupying his old office of Treasurer to the King's Wardrobe. Thus much for the alien Dean of Brug-. Among other presentees to the Deanery of Brug, occurs William de Montfort, March 2nd, 1265, whose name, coupled with the date at which he obtained the grant, indicate his relationship to Simon de Montfort. Under the diocese of Coventry and Lichfield, and the archdeaconry of Stafford, the following was returned in the Valor of 1535 : \" Thomas Magnus, Dean of the Collegiate Church of St. Mary Magdalene, holds the prebend of Ludston, which is worth, in glebe land, clear of deductions, \u00a34 per annum. He also holds the Rectory of Claverley, which is worth in tithes, offerings, etc., \u00a336 per annum.\" \u00a340 per annum, therefore, was the value of his Deanery. Among the Prebendaries of this once great Collegiate establish ment, occurs John Mansel, who, Chancellor of England from November, 1246, to October, 1249, through a period of twenty-five years was employed in various offices by King Henry III. This 'man was reputed to be the richest clerk in the world! The enor mities of the principles of plurality and non-residence, which prevailed in the days of Henry III., may be inferred from the circumstance, that, no less than 700 l ecclesiastical livings are computed to have been held by Mansel, the king's chaplain, at one and the same time. When such intolerable abuses prevailed, is it any wonder that our Anglo-Norman forefathers kicked at the mis.-rule of the Third Henry ? A Chantry in the Church of St. Mary Magdalene, was founded by Richard Dammas about 1294, which remained till the Dissolution. Church of St. Leonard. \u2014 When, in the time of Henry VIII., Leland, the antiquary, visited Bridgenorth, he wrote: \" There is but one Paroch Church in the towne, a very fayre one, and dedicated to St. Leonard.\"2 Eyton supposes its foundation to be coeval with that of the borough, although described as the \" Cemetery of St. Leonard \" the first notice relating to it is not older than the middle of the 13th century. It was in the king's gift. Unnoticed, either in the Taxation of 1291, or the Inquest of the Ninths, the Valor of 1535, however, recognised two Chantries 2 Itinerary, Vol. IV. part ii, so. 182 a. 1 Hume, Hist, of Eng. Ch. 12."], [54, "32 in St. Leonard's Church, namely, those of \"St. Thomas,\" and \" St. Mary the Virgin.\" The founders of these Chantries were Burgesses of the Town ; their revenues were derived from borough property. These Chantries remained till the Dissolution. The Hospital of the Holy Trinity, dedicated also to the Virgin Mary and St. John the Baptist, is reputed to have been founded by Ralph le Strange, Lord of Alveley, in the time of Richard I. Usually called St. John's, this foundation was doubtless originally designed for the relief of poor impotent people, and for the entertainment of travellers on the road; and, like others of its class, was placed by the road-side. The hospital alluded to, stood in the Low Town of Bridgenorth, within the angle formed by Mill Street and St. John Street, and, thus placed, it commanded every highway by which travellers could approach the town from the eastern end of the bridge over the Severn. It had a Master, or Prior, a Chaplain probably, and a certain number of regular brethren. According to the Valor ol 1535, this House was a dependency of Lilleshall Abbey, which long before had obtained custody of it. The Leper House of St. James, intended as a refuge for persons afflicted with formidable, and perhaps contagious, diseases, stood without the town, not far off from the Hospital of the Holy Trinity, ancl probably owed its foundation to the sanitary precaution of the community of the borough of Brug. Founded previously to 1224. Connected with Bridgenorth, appears to have been a \" mala dreric,\" of still older date than the Leper House of St. James. It lay on the Oldbury side of the town. \" The language used in certain early charters of these Leper-Houses, would seem to indi cate that the term 'leprosy,' was applicable only to contagious disease, or what was believed to be so. On the other hand, it is well known that paralytic affections were classified under the same term ' leprosy,' in the middle ages ; and, whereas, paralysis can scarcely have been accounted infectious even then, it would appear that the term was used to denote severe disease, in a much more general sense than modern notions can at once apprehend.\"1 Among the ancient religious foundations of Bridgenorth, was The Monastery of St. Francis, belonging to the Franciscan, or Grey Friars, known also as the order of Friars 1 Eyton's Antiquities of Shropshire, note Vol. I. p. 347."], [55, "33 Minors, a monastic fraternity, introduced into England early in the 13th century.1 Founded during the reign of Henry III., this House at Bridgenorth was one of nine subject to the custody of Worcester, the English province of the order of Franciscans being subdivided into seven custodies, or districts, over the convents in each of which presided a separate custos, or keeper. The House in question lay to the west of the Severn, under the Church of St. Leonard's, adjoining which are some vaults known as the \" Friars' Caves.\" Their great hall, or refectory, is still, or was but lately, in tolerable condition. It is not known who founded this establishment, although the brethren claimed Ralph le Strange for founder; yet this could not have been, as Ralph died twenty four years before the order was introduced into England. Unac counted for in the Valor of 1535, the revenues of this House fell into lay hands at the Dissolution. Hewn out of the red sandstone hilly formation that faces Bridge north on the east, the road which led through Mors Forest towards Worfield, passed under a cave, \"The Hermitage,\" where, says tradition, a brother of King Athelstane Far in a wild, unknown to public view, From youth to age, a reverend hermit grew. Yet, whether it existed in the Anglo-Saxon era, or not, certain it is, that anciently there was a hermitage in this suburb of Bridge north; for we read, that in 1328 John Oxindon was presented by King Edward III. to the \"Hermitage of Athelwildston, near Bridgnorth.\"2 Among early tenures in Bridgenorth, \" The Fee of Little Brug,\" held of the Crown by petit sergeantry, deserves mention. Sometimes called Southbridge, this suburb of Little Brug consisted of two short continuations of Hungary Street or St. Mary's Street, and of Whitburn or Raven Street. These lying outside of St. Mary's and Whitburn gates, unite in a road, which, leading north west at first, afterwards branches off towards Shrewsbury. The angle formed by these streets (one of which is still called Little Bridge Street), and subtended by the town wall, will represent the Fee of Little Brug. There is a legend, that during the siege of Brug by Henry I. in 1102, \"Sir Ralph de Pitchford, one of the 1 St. Francis, founder of the order of Minorites, died and within ten years afterwards, his followers obtained a footing in England. 1226; 2 Pat. 2 Ed. III. p. I, m.33. D"], [56, "34 king's commanders, behaved himself so gallantly, that Henry granted him an estate in the neighbourhood, called the Little Brugge, to hold by the service of finding dry wood for the king's great chamber in the castle, as often as he should come there.\"1 From a fragmentary Roll in the Testa de Nevill, drawn up about 1212, we learn, that Ralph, son of Hugh de Pichford, held Little Brug by gift of King Henry, grandfather of King John, by service of finding dry wood for the chamber in the castle of Brug, at the King's coming there. This family of Pitchford is pre sumed to have descended from the Domesday \" Norman Venator.\" Now Ulger the Hunter (Ulger Venator) , according to the contem porary chronicler,2 whose connection with the family of the Earl of Shrewsbury would give him access to precise information on the subject, was one of the three knights concerned in the sur render to Henry I. of de Belesme's stronghold of Bridgenorth ; yet, in what way the Sir Ralph de Pitchford of the legend, and Ulger the Hunter, were connected, is the question. Singularly enough, however, the representatives of each, under a writ of \" mort d' ancestre,\" contested certain property in Lee Brockhirst. The De Pitchfords held Little Brug in capite, having tenants under them. Haughmond Abbey also, from ancient time, held in Little Brug, having acquired, previously to 1172, the mill of Pichefort and half a virgate of land from Richard de Pichforte, who, \" for the health of his soul,\" gave them to the monks. Among other religious commmiities which had property in Bridgenorth, Lilleshall Abbey, by grant of Sibil de Linley about 1195, acquired all her lands in Brocton and in Brug. Sibil further bestowed her body for burial in that house. In 1255, 30s. rent in Bridgenorth accrued to Lilleshall, whose possessions in this borough were largely increased in the reign of Edward IV. by the acquisition of the hospital of St. John. Besides Haughmond and Lilleshall, Buildwas Abbey and the White Nuns of Brewood had estates here. Finally, the famous Knights Templars derived an income from Bridgenorth. Undoubtedly, the family of greatest wealth and importance in ancient Brug, was that of Le Palmer, whose interest in messuages, Grose, Antiquities of England and Wales, Vol. V. p. 3. 8 Ordericus Vitalis, Bk. XI. ch. iii."], [57, "35 streets, \"shops,\" and the \"fields,\" about old Brug are attested by numbers of ancient deeds. Robert and Walter le Palmer, the latter of whom was founder of two great families in the borough, occur between 1176 and 1205. The family of Le Palmer furnished a provost to Bridgenorth no less than eighteen times between 1220 and 1331 : the names of members of it also frequently appear on the earliest list of burgesses of Parliament returned by Bridge north. About 1250, a silver drinking cup value 12s. is specified as being in the possession of Walter le Palmer of Brug. The house in High Street, of Edmund le Palmer, who died about 1331, was dignified with the appellation \"a hall,\" Aula Edmundi le Palmer. Another family, which probably derived its surname of De Cas tello or De Castro, from residing in or near the castle ; and also the Fitz-Roberts, early acquired prominence in Bridgenorth.

She married a royal favourite, Ranulf de Broc, who acquired notoriety by the part he took in Henry the Second's contest with the famous Thomas a Becket. After the king had confiscated the see of Canterbury, and pro nounced sentence of banishment on the numerous relatives of the Archbishop, it was to Ranulf de Broc, that Henry entrusted the execution of his orders, who discharged the office committed to him 1 Ancill\u0153. is the expression ofthe origi- nal record. a Leuua. or Leuga as Domesday has it. 3 Domesday, so. 254, a. 1."], [58, "36 with such severity, that he called down upon his head a special excommunication from a Becket. \" Ranulph de Broc,\" wrote the exiled Archbishop, \" has taken possession of the property of the church of Canterbury, which by right is a provision for the poor, ancl withholds the same, and has arrested our men as though they were laymen, and detains them in his custody.\" ' For nearly a hundred years after his decease, Ranulf 's descen dants retained an interest in Chetton ; but by 1284 Roger Corbet had acquired the manor, which he held directly of the Crown by the following extraordinary service.

The mention of a priest in the Dotnesday survey of Chetton, implies the existence of a church here in 1086. It was probably founded by the Countess Godeva. The church of Chetynton with the chapel of Lustone, in 1291, were returned as worth \u00a316 per annum ; the rector of Cound had a portion therein of 4s., and the abbot of Wigmore one of 10s. In 1341, the parish was taxed only \u00a37 4s. 4d. to the ninth, because much land lay uncultivated on account of the poverty of tenants, etc. The Valor of 1534 represents the rectory of Chetton as worth \u00a310 19s. 7d. net value.

In the time of Henry II. , Richard de Belmeis, representing that collateral branch whose ancestor had been enfeoffed in Donington, held this manor under the Lords of Tong, the elder house. Of this man or his son we read, that in 1189, Aaron, the rich Jew of Lincoln, having died, his chattels and securities escheated to the Crown, when, among others, it was found that Richard de Belmeis had owed the deceased Israelite \u00a34 8s. 6d., to which accordingly the Crown laid claim ; and Richard paid the amount into the Exchequer, through the sheriff of Shropshire, by succes sive instalments, the last of which is entered on the Pipe Roll of 1200. The reader hardly requires to be reminded, that through out the Anglo-Norman period, the once renowned chosen people of God were subject to the most iniquitous oppressions and indig nities at the hands of all classes. Abandoned to the rapacity of the king and his unscrupulous ministers, the revenue arising from Jewish exactions was so considerable, that a particular Court of Exchequer was set apart for managing it.2 Walter de Belmeis next became Lord of Donington, who, in 1221, having been challenged by Geoffrey de Es well for breach of the king's peace and for robbery, his accuser, although bound over to prosecute, did not appear before the justices in Eyre, and so was to be arrested \u2014 the jury meanwhile acquitted Walter. To Walter succeeded Roger his son. In 1284, John de Beaumes, occurs as holding the manor of Donington, under Roger la Zouch, by one knight's fee. John left two sons, Hugh and John, the latter of whom, resigning his interest in this place to his elder brother, Hugh de Beaunieys, in 1316, was accordingly returned as lord of the manor of Donington. Hugh was returned as a \" man-at-arms,\" liable to attend the Great Council summoned to meet at Westminster on May 30th, 1324. Neachley, Shakerley, Kilsall, and Humphreston, the last of which is presumed to derive its name from some earl}-- tenant, were all in Donington manor, and each had its under-tenants. A word now as to those salt-pits which, Domesday says, were 1 Domesday, so. 253, b. 2. 2 MMadox, History ofthe Exchequer."], [60, "38 attached to this manor. Wherever, in the Conqueror's record, salinae, salt-works, or salt-pans, are mentioned in connection with any manor, some local advantage, a salt spring, or the sea near at hand is indicated. We read in Domesday that \" In Wich there are v salt-pits, which render xx shillings.\" Wich appears to have been a generic term, applicable to any place where salt was pro duced. We are not to suppose that in Donington there was a district called Wich wherein were five salt-pits, any more than that Donington lay on the sea-coast where marine salt was manu factured. Eyton's explanation seems the correct one, namely, that five salinae in Wich, that is, in one of the large salt districts of Cheshire or Worcestershire, were adjuncts of this manor, and had been so in Saxon times. Donington Church. The Norman earl, Roger, who founded this church, bestowed it on Shrewsbury Abbey. Bishop Roger de Belmeis wrung the advow son from the monks ; but on his death-bed he was careful to restore it. This was in 1127. In 1291 the annual value of the church of Doni ton, in the deanery of Newport, was \u00a32 13s. 4d. The Commissioners for the Ninth of corn, wool, and lamb, in 1341, taxed the parish of Dunynton only \u00a31 3s. 4d. In 1534 Donyng ton Rectory was valued at \u00a314 per annum, less 13s. 4d. for Syno dals and Procurations, and a pension of 6s. 8d. to the Abbot of Shrewsbury.

Domesday thus records the fact : \u2014 \" The same Earl holds Tuange. Earl Morcar held it. Here iii hides geldable.

In King Edward's time [the manor] was worth \u00a311 [per annum] ; now it is worth \u00a36.\" l Doubtless the earl honoured both Donington and this manor occasionally by his presence. Near were woods in which the Nor man seigneur might hunt, and trout-abounding streams, such as a devout catholic would prize ; so Earl Roger built him a church here in token of his special regard. Upon the forfeiture of De Belesme, Tong became a royal demesne, when Henry I. granted it with Donington to Richard de Belmeis, who, from being a confidential clerk in the service of Earl Roger de Montgomery, rose to be Sheriff or Viceroy of Shropshire, and ultimately Bishop of London. De Belmeis stood high in favour with the Norman Earl \u2014 attesting his charters fre quently. He also figures as a witness to the charters of Earl Hugh. His non-participation in the rebellion of Robert de Be lesme probably recommended this able scholar to the notice of King Henry I. \"The said Richard,\" says Eadmer, \"was a most able man in secular affairs.\" The post, however, to which he was assigned, that of \" warden of the marches,\" owing to the unsettled state of the border, re quired all De Belmeis' tact to manage ; the Welsh, ever ready to assert their freedom, were constantly making irruptions on the lands of their neighbouring Anglo-Norman oppressors ; assassin ations and disorders were rife. Surrounded by such circumstances, there is but too much reason to fear, that \" Richard, Bishop of London, whom the king had appointed warden of the marches,\" lent himself to schemes of the grossest treachery, and that more than one Welsh chieftain lost his life at the hands of assassins in the pay of this prelatic viceroy of the Anglo-Norman king. The great Christian Church of St. Paul's, which Sebert, the tributary king of the East Saxons, had reared upon the site of the Roman temple of Diana in London, was destroyed by fire in the year 1087, when the Norman bishop, Maurice, began the foundation of a new church, to be erected on a much larger and 1 Domesday, so. 253, b. 2."], [62, "40 more splendid scale. To this great work, both he and his suc cessor De Belmeis, each of whom presided twenty years over the diocese, devoted the principal portion of their episcopal revenues ; yet St. Paul's Cathedral was not finished until long afterwards. Besides his princely donations to St. Paul's, Richard de Bel meis was a great benefactor to the Priory of St. Osyth, and also to the Nunnery of Clerkenwell. Struck with paralysis, it is sup posed that this Anglo-Nonnan prelate retired to St. Osyth's, and died there. At any rate, there he was buried, and a marble tomb within the Priory Church long bore the following inscription : \u2014 \" Hie jacet Richardus Beauveis, cognomine Rufus, London : Episcopus, vir probus et grand\u00e6vus, per totam vitarn laboriosus, fundator noster religiosus, et qui multa bona nobis et mimstris ecclesi\u00e6 su\u00e6 Sancti Pauli contulit. Obiit xvi Januarii, mcxxvii. Cujus anim\u00e6 propitietur altissimus.\" 1 Upon the decease of the prelate, his nephew, Philip de Belmeis, became Lord of Tong and Donington ; and he, upon the breaking out of the civil war, took part with the usurper, [Stephen, with whom he was at the siege of Shrewsbury. Like other great men of his day, the Lord of Tong was liberal in gifts to the Church. He gave lands to Buildwas Abbey, and, some years afterwards, sounded, near Tong, that Augustine institution, the germ of the afterwards magnificent abbey of Lilleshall. The piece of land which Philip de Belmeis granted, \" for the foundation of a church in honour of the Holy Mary, Mother of God,\" bounded by the ancient Roman Watling Street on the north, and eastwards by the rivulet, which, flowing from north to south, supplies Tong Mere, is still called \" the Grange.\" Seised of lands in Shropshire, Sussex, Leicestershire, Staffordshire, Cheshire, and probably other counties, Philip did not long survive this grant, when to him succeeded another Philip, and afterwards Ranulph, his brother, who was employed by Henry II. in Wales. Ranulph, dying without issue, about 1167, with him terminated the elder male line of De Belmeis. The manor of Tong, with Ranulph's other possessions, now devolved to Alice, his sister, who, having married Alan la Zouche son of Geoffrey, Vicomte of Rohan, in Brittany, upon his death, Tong passed to the La Zouche's descendants of this heiress. 1 Weever's Sepulchral Monuments, p. 607."], [63, "41 The accession of King John to the Anglo-Norman throne, in accordance, it is true, with King Richard's last will, nevertheless was contrary to the law of primogeniture, and manifestly an in justice to his nephew Arthur, son of his elder brother Geoffrey, Count of Brittany, in favour of whose superior claims to the suc cession, a large body of trans-marine nobles had declared them selves. It is not improbable, that, descended as he was from the reigning earls or dukes of Brittany, Roger la Zouche, Lord of Tong in 1199, entertained similar sentiments. But when John added to his other crimes that of the murder of young Prince Arthur, the Bretons, determining to avenge it, arose against the parricidal tyrant, and Roger la Zouche joined them. Hence, when summoned to the Salop assizes of October, 1203, Roger essoigned his attendance, his excuse being that he had gone beyond sea. It was never to a certainty known that John did murder his nephew ; yet, as Horace says, \" All the footmarks led to the lion's cave, but none led back again.\" The Bretons, joining themselves to Philip Augustus of France, the English monarch's barbarous act led, as is well known, to his expulsion from his French pro vinces. On the other side, La Zouche's chivalric sympathies involved the forfeiture of his English possessions. Tong now was given to William de Braose, the same whose wife and heir the fickle tyrant John afterwards starved to death in Windsor Castle. De Braose had held the Manor but a short while, however, when Roger la Zouche, returning to his allegiance, paid a hundred merks for seisin of his lands, and recovered possession of Tong. Roger accompanied the English king in his expedition into Ireland, in 1210, and in 1214 he attended him into Poictou. Adhering to King John, that sovereign gave La Zouche many valuable manors which had become forfeit to the Crown. Upon the death of John, La Zouche assisted the Earl of Pembroke and other loyal nobles to retain the throne of England for his son, young Henry III. La Zouche's loyal services were rewarded by fresh grants. He had license to hold a fair at his Devonshire Manor of Northmolton, and, in the same year, namely 1218, the Sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk received orders to give him lands which had belonged to the \" Vicomte of Roain,\" who, a collateral descendant of the house from whence La Zouche himself sprang, appears to have inherited considerable estates in England."], [64, "42 When the English king lost his continental possessions, every man who held land by feudal tenure, that is military service, on both sides of the channel, was constrained to elect between two allegiances. He could not personally fight for opposite suzerains. He was compelled to elect on which side he would remain, when, the decision arrived at, the suzerain of his choice doubtless rewarded him, whilst the other deprived him of his estates. Such would appear to have been the circumstances under which Roger la Zouche obtained possession of the Enghsh lordship of the Vicomte de Rohan. This vicomte, representing, as we said, an elder branch of that house from which La Zouche sprang, adhered to the French suzerain, and forfeited his Enghsh fief ; on the con trary, La Zouche, from motives best known to himself, elected for the English allegiance, and parted with his foreign possessions : as we learn that, on January 22, 1219, the sheriff of Devonshire was ordered to give Roger the lands which had once been Joel de Maine's, the grant being, as is expressed, in recompense of lands which Roger \" had lost in Brittany in the king's service.\" At the Salop assizes of Nov. 1221, Roger la Zouche sued the Abbot of Shrewsbury for the advowson of Tong, without success. Roger also had a quarrel with the Abbot of Buildwas. On April 2, 1230, Roger la Zouche has the king's letters-patent of protection, dated at Portsmouth, \" so long as he should be with the king in foreign parts \" ; from which it appears that he was one of those nobles who accompanied Henry III. in his expedition into Brittany, being with the king all the while that he \" was lying with his army at the City of Nantes, doing nothing except spending his money.\" Enfeoffing Henry de Hugford in lands at Tong, in a curious deed noticed by Dugdale in his Baronage, the only acknowledg ment Roger la Zouche reserved was \" a chaplet of roses, payable to the grantor and his heirs upon the feast day of the Nativity of St. John the Baptist (June 24), in case he or they should be at Tong ; if not, then to be put upon the image of the Blessed Virgin hi the Church of Tonge.\" Roger died at an advanced age, about 1238, when Alan la Zouche, the eminent justiciar, became Lord of Tong. The finale of this eminent baron is briefly indicated by M. Paris, under date 1269, when, \"about the same time,\" says the chronicler, \"John de Warenne, Earl of Surrey, slew with his own hand, in Westminster Hall, Alan de la Zouch, the king's justiciary, in consequence of"], [65, "43 some words which passed between them.\" Long previously, how ever, Alan had given the Manor of Tong with his sister Alice, in frank marriage to William de Harcourt. Alice la Zouche, wife of William de Harcourt died, after having borne him two daughters, whereupon the Lord of Tong espoused Hillaria, the sister of Henry de Hastings. This was in 1256. A few years later, and his barons rebelled against the mis-rule of Henry III., when William de Harcourt, joining de Hastings and the confederates, ranged him self against Alan la Zouche, his brother-in-law, and the royalists. It was Harcourt's error to miscalculate the signs of his time. He had chosen the losing side, and, in 1265, his estates became forfeit. Yet, notwithstanding this, Alan LaZouch's powerful interest secured for his nieces, Orabel and Margery de Harcourt, Tong, and other lands which were theirs in right of their mother. Orabel, the elder of these ladies, married Henry, son of Henry de Pembruge ; Margery, marrying John de Cantilupe, both she and her husband died without issue. Henry de Pembruge, therefore, in right of his wife, became Lord of Tong. He, the grandson of Henry de Pembruge, of Pembruge, Here fordshire, represented a house with which many Shropshire families claim affinity. It was alleged, that Henry, his father, an adhe rent of Simon Montfort, even after the battle of Evesham, had insulted Prince Edmund, second son of Henry III., and set fire to Warwick, where, however, being taken prisoner, he was handed over to the keeping of Roger de Mortimer, under whom he held his Manor of Pembruge, who clapped him into the dungeon at Wig more. Instead of striving to reclaim the unsteady faith of his vassal, Mortimer was intent rather on extorting from his prisoner his lands, in which nefarious scheme he succeeded to a considerable extent. Upon his accession, however, the Lord of Tong strenu ously set himself to recover the fallen fortunes of his house, and apprising the justices of his readiness to redeem his father's lands, according to the Dictum de Kenilworth, upon the refusal of Mortimer to surrender them, Henry de Pembruge sued him before the Justices Itinerant, and also before the king, at Westminster. Owing to the gigantic influences opposed to him, the Lord of Tong, however, experienced but partial redress. Inquisitions, taken after the decease of Henry de Pembruge, in 1279, report him to have held land in Worcestershire, Wiltshire, Herefordshire, Leicestershire, and Tong in Shropshire ; and Fulk, his son, then a minor, the juries found to be his heir. Soon after"], [66, "44 attaining his majority, Fulk died, when, on June 20, 1296, the king's writ of diem clausit extremum, issued to the escheator citra Trent, and the inquests which followed found, among other par ticulars, that the deceased held the Manor of Tong under Sir Alan La Zouche, ancl that he owed no service thereon. The Tong jurors valued the capital messuage at 5s., the fishery of the vivary at 2s. 8d., the dovecote at Is. 8d., the water-mill at 2s. per annum. They enumerated various rents 'due from the free tenants of the manor, among which was one of a chaplet of roses. The whole manor and income they estimated as worth \u00a320 19s. 8|d., yearly. They found Fulk, infant son of the deceased, to be his heir. The lands of this heir were entrusted by King Edward II. to Oliver de Bordeaux, until he should attain his majority, which happened hi 1312. Fulk de Pembruge was included among those adherents of Thomas Earl of Lancaster, who, having participated in the death of Piers Gaveston, had the king's pardon. This Lord of Tong served as a knight of the shire of Salop, at the parliament of York, in 1322. Indeed, to judge from his various employments, as a commissioner of array, inspector of levies, etc., and his frequent summonses to councils at home, and military service abroad, the Lord of Tong was not only a very active, but a useful and im portant personage in his time. About 1334, Fulk Pembruge III. died, when it is supposed Robert, his brother became his heir, who was father of Fulk Pembruge IV. This Fulk was twice married, first to Margaret, daughter and eventual sole heir of William Trussel, of Cublesdon. She died without issue. Fulk then married Isabel (or Elizabeth) Lingen, and, dying without issue, about 1308, thus ended the male line of his succession at Tong. Isabel, widow of Fulk Pembruge, remarried twice afterwards, namely, to Sir Thomas Peytevine ancl Sir John Ludlow. The heir of Sir Fulk Pembruge of Tong was his grand-nephew, Sir Richard de Vernon, who died in 1451, seised of various Vernon and Pembruo;e estates in Bucking-ham shire, Derbyshire, Staffordshire, and Shropshire. A succession of knights and nobles continued to possess the Lordship of Tong, con spicuous among whom was Stanley. A younger branch of the De Belmeis family, distinct from that which furnished lords to Donington, appears among the under tenants in Tong. Thus, Robert de Beaumcs occurs, in 1255, as a"], [67, "45 vassal of the Lords of Tong, whose son, again, Hugh de Belmeis, loyally adhering to Henry III. throughout the civil war, as one of that monarch's valets, attended him at the siege of Kenilworth Castle, where he lost two horses. Being with the king, at Cam bridge, on March 15, 1267, Hugh obtained the royal licence to hunt the fox, the badger, and the wild cat, anywhere in the royal forests of Shropshire or Staffordshire. Towards the latter end of the same year, being at Salop with King Henry, that monarch, \"in recompense of the long and laudable service which his beloved valet, Hugh de Beaumeys, had rendered him, granted to said Hugh the marriage of Isabella, widow of Robert de Beysyn, lately de ceased, or, at least, the fine which belonged to the king for the said marriage\" ; and again, on July 5, 1270, the king, by letters patent, granted him \" the marriage of Hillaria, widow of William de Harecut, deceased, or else such fine as said Hillaria might be about to make with the king for her own marriage ; or, in the last place, such forfeit as would be coming to the king if Hillaria married to any other, without licence of the king or of said Hugh.\" ' Unhonoured, however, with the hand of either lady, although probably enriched with the fines of both, the king's favourite valet found a rich wife elsewhere. And thus it was, that, in the feudal times, the suzerain concocted the marriages of our Anglo-Norman ancestors. In Albrighton Parish, is a messuage still known as Beamish Hall. Perhaps it was once the seat of this branch of the Belmeis family. In a note, Eyton remarks, \" The name Beamish is yet to be found among the poorer classes of Tong or its neighbourhood.\" Does it rest, then, with the poor alone to represent the lordly De Belmeis or Beaumes, in the place where once they held such high state ? Alas ! how are the mighty fallen ! Ruckley, an ancient member of Tong, was, excepting its wood, given by Philip de Belmeis, in 1138-9, to Buildwas Abbey. Tong Church. Like that of Donington, Tong Church was founded, endowed, and bestowed on Shrewsbury Abbey by Earl Roger de Montgomery, previously to 1094. When he induced the monks to consign to him the advowson of Donington, Richard de Belmeis, Bishop of London, also compelled them to part with Tong Church ; yet, as he lay dying at St. Osyth's, the remorseful prelate, by a formal 1 Patent 54, Hen. III."], [68, "46 act of restitution, took care to restore both churches to Shrewsbury Abbey. Pope Nicholas's taxation in 1291, valued the Church of Tonge, in the Deanery of Newport, the Archdeaconry of Salop, and Diocese of Coventry, at \u00a34, besides the Abbot of Shrewsbury's pension of 6s. 8d. therein. In 1341, Tong parish was assessed only \u00a33 6s. 8d. to the ninth, because the Abbots of Buildwas and Lilleshall held lands here, etc. Preparatory to founding the Col legiate Church of Tong, Isabel, widow of Sir Fulk de Pembruge, purchased in 1410 the advowson from Salop Abbey ; reserving to the abbot, however, that pension which his predecessors had been wont to receive from the church of St. Bartholomew the Apostle. Accordingly, in 1534, the Abbot of Salop returned 6s. 8d., as paid by the College of Tong. In 1535, the value of the parochial church annexed to the said college was stated by the Master of Tong College to be \u00a36 13s. 4d., less 14s. to the bishop and arch- deacon. Early Incumbent \u2014 Ernulf, Canon of Lichfield, instituted to this church about 1190. Although parts of its south aisle may be referred to the 13th century, by far the larger portion of Tong Church was erected at the commencement of the 15th century. Consisting of a nave with aisles, a chancel, and central octagonal tower with a low spire, it is a fine example of the early perpendicu lar. All the roofs are of timber, excepting the fan vaulting of the corbel, socth aisle, tong. chapel on the south side, which chapel, by the way, belongs to the latest period of Gothic. Within the walls of this sacred edifice are several splendid monuments, the oldest of which is thus noticed by Sir William Dugdale, who visited Tong Church in Sept., 1663 :\u2014\" Towards"], [69, "(supposld) .MONUMENT OF SIR RICHARD VERNON AND WIFE IN TONCJ CHURCH. p. 4G."], [70, ""], [71, "47 the north side of the church stands a faire tombe of alabaster, whereon do lye the figures of a man in armour (partly mail and partly plate armour), and of his wife on his right hand, and on her chin a wimpler. Upon the helm whereon the man resteth his head is this crest (upon a wreath), viz., a Turkish woman's head with a wreath about her temples, her haire platted and hanging below her shoulders, with a tassel at the end of the platting. This is sayde to be the monument of Sir Fowke Pembrugge, knight, sometime Lord of Tong Castle.\" 1 Sir Fulk Pembruge, the last of his line, died 1408-9. It was his widow, Isabella, who founded the collegiate church of Tong. As in Dugdale's time, the popular notion still is that this monument commemorates Sir Fulk Pem bruge ; yet, from the half-effaced heraldic insignia it displays, the learned Eyton concludes that this is the tomb of Sir Richard Vernon, treasurer of Calais, who, the first to inherit the estates and arms of Pembruge, died in 1451. The reader will remember Roger la Zouche enfeoffing Henry de Hugford in lands at Tong, and reserving to himself only \" a chap let of roses, payable to the grantor and his heirs upon the feast day of the nativity of St. John the Baptist (June 24), in case he or they should be at Tong ; if not, then to be put upon the image of the Blessed Virgin in the Church of Tong.\" And it will also be remembered that, on the death of Fulk de Pembruge, Lord of Tong, in 1296, a quit-rent of a chaplet of roses was enumerated among his dues. Towards the close of the eighteenth century, a writer in the Gentleman's Magazine, when visiting Tong Church, among the other monuments, observed \" one of alabaster, to the memory of a Vernon,\" the tomb in question. \" The effigies,\" he continues, \" lie on an altar-tomb, and had the remains of a gar land of flowers (then nearly reduced to dust) round the neck and breast. The sexton told me that on every Midsummer-day (June 24), a new garland was put on, and remained so until the follow ing, when it was annually renewed. As this is a singular custom, I could not forbear noticing it, and wish to be informed what was the origin of it.\"2 The custom alluded to, without doubt, had its origin in the earlier part of the thirteenth century, when Roger La Zouche enfeoffed Henry de Hugford in lands at Tong. The old lords of Tong, with their knightly successors, have long since been numbered with the things that were, and \" the image of the 1 Dugdale's Visitation cf Shropshire, at the Herald's College, Church Notes, p.i8. 2 Gentleman's Magazine, Vol. MLXX. p. 934."], [72, "48 Blessed Virgin \" has disappeared before a purer faith ; yet still, for hundreds of years afterwards, the quit-rent of the \" chaplet of roses \" continued to be paid\u2014 aye, even until the nineteenth cen tury ; with this difference only, that the garland, no longer at tached to an image that had ceased to exist, was hung around the \" neck and breast \" of the effigy of an old lord of the manor. An epitaph upon another monument in Tong Church is, by an eminent authority,1 asserted to have been written by Shakspeare. The verse in question runs as follows : \u2014 Not monumental stone preserves our fame, Nor sky-aspiring pyramids our name; The memory of him for whom this stands Shall outlive marble and defacer's hands. When all to Time's consumption shall be given, Stanley, for whom this stands, shall stand in heaven. It is to be observed, that Shakspeare was not yet thirteen years old when Sir Thomas Stanley, whom these lines commemorate, died ; yet monuments were not always erected immediately upon the decease of the parties they are intended to commemorate. Formerly, the windows of Tong Church were enriched with many brilliant coats of arms illustrative of the history and alliances of the Pembruge's and Vernons. Although no mention is made of it in King William's record, yet at the time of the Conqueror, and for generations afterwards, an extensive forest, formerly known as the Royal Forest of Brewood, existed in the part of Shropshire we are describing. Weston and Bishop's Wood bounded it on the north, Brewood and Chillington to the east, whilst Albrighton, Donington, and Tong formed its southern and western limits. By one grant after another, King John surrendered the more imperative rights of the Crown in this district. In the Anglo-Norman period, the forest laws, as my readers are aware, were very stringent and oppressive. According to Spelman, sixty-eight forests, thirteen chases, and seven hundred and eighty one parks, in different parts of England, were retained by the king, the slightest trespass on any one of which sometimes occa sioned the ruin of the offender. Considering the passion evinced by both Norman and Saxon for the pleasures of the chase, these royal forests were little better than so many traps set to allure 1 Sir William Ducdale."], [73, "WHITE-LADIES."], [74, ""], [75, "49 people into heavy and oppressive fines, which went to swell the King's Exchequer. Within the boundaries of Brewood Forest, at the beginning of the thirteenth century, existed two rival religious establishments, \u2014 St. Leonard's, known as White Ladies, a convent of Cistercian nuns, which was in Shropshire, and St. Mary's, a convent of Black or Benedictine nuns, in Staffordshire. It is a singular circumstance, that no chartulary, or even legend, exists to throw a light upon the origin of the former of these con vents. Supposed to have been founded in the time of King Richard, or John, the charter of the latter monarch calls the sisterhood \" Nuns of St. Leonard of Brewud.\" The property of this sisterhood, acquired by gradual instalments, each representing the consignment of some female member of a wealthy or powerful family to the service of religion, in time came to be represented by a large aggregate. Their House was parochially and manorially independent. The sisterhood elected their own superior. In 1535-6, the Prioress of St. Leonard returned \u00a331 Is. 4d. as the gross annual income of this House, derivable from demesne lands at White Ladies, and from various rents in Nottinghamshire, Staffordshire, and Shropshire. White Ladies was a Norman structure. A wood-cut representa tion of this interesting ruin is appended. (DuluUni. Situated in the Manor of Oldbury, and fronting the castle-hill of Bridgenorth to the south, is a large artificial conical mound of earth. This earthwork, which still goes by the name of \" The Old Castle,\" is supposed by an authority,1 to be the site of that fortress which, according to the Saxon Chronicle and Florence of Worcester, Ethelfleda, Lady of the Mercians, built on the western side of the Severn, in the year 913. If such be the case, then Oldbury, literally Old Borough, once possessed a castle which had an existence antecedent to that at Bridgenorth. When William the Conqueror's commissioners surveyed Shrop shire, they found that Rainald, the sheriff of the county, held eight manors under the Norman Earl of Shrewsbury, in the Hundred of Alnodestreu ; and a part of Hatton. Oldbury, one of the sheriff's manors, is thus described in Domesday Book: \u2014 \" The same Rainald [Vicecomes] holds Aldeberie,. and Radulf [holds it] ' Eyton, Antiq. of Shrop. vol. i. p. 13s. v"], [76, "50 of him.

The Church of Holdebury, in the Deanery of Stottesden, in 1291, was valued at \u00a34 18s. 4d. In 1341, the parish was assessed at \u00a31 5s. to the ninth.

Hence it came, that upon the forfeiture of Earl Robert de Be lesme, Alcher's descendants became tenants in capite of the Crown. Alcher gave his lordship of Albrighton to the then just founded Abbey of Shrewsbury, and was succeeded by his son, Robert Fitz Aer, who founded and endowed Aston Church about 1138.

Eston was among the number, the bishop expressly mentioning, that the \" defence of the poor \" was one of the objects he had in view in consecrating these chapels. It was thus that the church in the middle ages often became a stronghold for the people, it being nothing uncommon for both church and church-yard to be crowded with the effects of those in the neighbourhood, who placed them there for protection. During the horrors of those 15 years which succeeded the pious act of Fitz Aer, even the churches afforded, however, but an uncertain protection ; Mahnesbury, who witnessed the scenes he has described under date of 1140, adding, that \" the legate repeatedly excommunicated all violators of church-yards, and plunderers of churches,\" but that little atten tion was paid to his ecclesiastical thunderings.

The remonstrances of the founder's heir proved unavailing ; the diocesan bishop awarded the right of advowson to the abbey, when, about 1230, the \"Lord of Eston\" formally quitted to Salop Abbey all claim in the chapel his ancestor had erected and endowed. In the Taxation of 1291, the chapel of Astone Aer, described as an adjunct of the church of Morville, no separate valuation is given ; but the annual value of the Vicarage is stated to be under \u00a34. In the Valor of 1534-5, this chapel is not mentioned; the curate of Wheaten Aston, however, had a salary of \u00a35 16s. O^d. chargeable on the cell or grange of Morville.

Now, 20s.\"1 Thus, Eluuard the Saxon's free manor of Gleslei, wrenched, like Oldbury and Eudon from him, was given to the Norman, when all three devolved to the fief of Rainald the Sheriff. Respecting Azo, who held Glazeley under Rainald at the time of the survey, his interest in this, as in other manors, in time came to be represented by the elder house of Le Strange. Accordingly, in 1165, we find John le Strange holding Glazeley of the Barony of Fitz Alan. About 1175, Simon and William de Perepunt,2 of Norman extraction, their grandfather probably having fought at Hastings, as the name spelt Perepond appears on the Roll of Battle Abbey, figure as witnesses to a curious deed, in which John le Strange I. notifies his remembrance of Fitz Alan's grant of Wroxeter Church to Haughmond Abbey. Alan succeeded Simon at Glazeley, after whom came Guy de Pierrepoint, otherwise called Wydo de Gleseleg. Guy had three sons, the eldest of whom, Alan, in 1255, was reported by the Stottesden Jurors, Lord of Glasele, holding its hide of land of John le Strange for half a knight's fee. Alan did no suit, excepting twice a year at the sheriff's tourn, nor did he pay stretward, or motfee. Sir Alan was succeeded by another Wydo; and so, until far into the reign of Edward III., the descendants of the Norman de Pierpont from time to time figure in old charters, the Escheat Rolls,3 or other national records, as lords of the manor of Glazeley.

The monks had founded a chapel there ; hence the dispute. But De Belmeis, Bishop of London, then Viceroy of Shropshire, presiding judicially in the Chapter in which the claim was preferred, rejected it on the ground that all St. Milburg's lands constituted but one parish. According to Pope Nicholas' taxation in 1291, the church of Glasleye was worth \u00a34, the Prior of Wenlock having a portion of 6s. 8d. therein. The church of Glaseley, in Stottesden Deanery, in 1341, is entered at \u00a34 6s. 8d., yet the assessors of the ninth taxed the parish only 19s. in consequence of a want of sheep and lambs, non-cultivation of one virgate through poverty of its tenants, etc. In 1535, the joint value of Deuxhill and Glazeley was \u00a34 13s. 4d., out of which a pension of 8s. went to Wenlock Priory. Doubtless, very early in the 12th century, there were Incum bents of Glazeley ; the Hereford registers, which commence 1275, however, take no notice of the circumstance ; nor is it known when the combination with Deuxhill, which existed in 1534, commenced. is thus noticed in Domesday :\u2014 \" The same Rainald holds Estone, and Tochil [holds it] imder him.

Although more than one person is represented by the Saxon name Aluric, Alric, \u00c6lric, or Elric, which so often occurs in Domesday as connected with Shropshire, it is probable that the Aluric who held Udecote [Woodcote] in Recordin Hundred, and the Elric who similarly held Estone in Edward the Confessor's time, were one and the same person ; and for this reason : in 1085 the successor to both these manors was Tochil\u2014 the name is Saxon \u2014 who, it is not unreasonable to suppose, was one of those favoured 1 Domesday, so 255, a 2."], [85, "57 but unpatriotic few, that, by a sufferance rarely exercised, was permitted to hold, under Norman Lords two manors which, widely apart, were his by descent.

Tochil, degenerate scion of the conquered race, early in the twelfth century gave land to the Norman Abbey of Shrewsbury. It is not very clear how the family of Botterell, from whom this place acquired its distinctive title, succeeded to Aston ; yet it is certain that among the fines offered to the Crown at Michaelmas, 1202, was one by Robert de Wudecot of 10 merks, that he might have trial concerning one knight's fee in Eston against AVilliam Boterell.

Of Robert, sub-tenant here in 1085, nothing further is known than Domesday relates. Thomas de Beggesoure became sub-tenant here about 1224, to whom his younger brother Philip, having taken the cross, surrendered up his tenancy in the following terms : \u2014 \" Know all men that I, Philip de Beggesoure, have rendered and quit-claimed to Thomas de Beggesoure, my brother, his heirs and assigns, all my land in Bechebiri, which I held of him (that namely, which Reginald and Wdliam le Sage held under me), for five merks of silver, which the said Thomas hath given me for mv journey to Jerusalem.

He fought in the sixth crusade, which, first proclaimed in 1215 by Innocent the Third, and afterwards by succeeding Popes, may be compared to a drama having three acts, namely, the expedition of the King of Hungary, the war in Egypt, and the campaign of Frederick the Second in the Holy Land. The Christian army, under Andrew of Hungary, most gallantly commenced its conflict with the Moslems ; but, by dis cord, its forces were disunited and eventually fell before the Saracens. The war in Egypt was signalised by the capture and re-capture from the Christian forces, after a bloody contest, of the city of Damietta. The expedition under Frederick the Second of Germany, whose conduct at first was vacillating, notwith standing that monarch was exposed to the anathemas of the tyrannical Gregory IX., left Palestine in a more favourable con dition than it had known since the days of Saladin ; a treaty which was entered into between the German monarch and the Saracens, securing to the Christians the possession of their king dom for ten years.

Alluding to this memorable Iter, the monk of St. Albans x observes, that the Commissioners of Henry III. \" cunningly, wantonly, and forcibly extorted such an immense sum of money, especially from the nobles of the northern parts of England, that the amount collected exceeded the belief of all who heard it.

He [Osbern] found it waste.\" 2 Osbern's interest in Ryton does not appear to have passed to his descendants ; yet we have no means of judging how this happened, as there are no hints of any forfeiture having befallen the early barons of Richard's castle. It might have been that a baron, the bulk of whose fief lay in distant parts of this or in other counties, finding an outlying manor a mere incumbrance, and that the services with wliich it was charged were more than it was worth to him, neglected to comply with the terms of his tenure, and the manor reverted to the suzerain. However, it came to pass, Ryton appears to have become subject to the re-disposal of the Norman earl, or, upon the forfeiture of De Belesme, of the Crown. Engelard, a man of importance in his day, was tenant in capite of Ryton, in the time of Henry I.: being made castellan of Stretton, hence his name of De Stretton. In 1165-6, the return ofthe tenants in capite of the kingdom, known as the Liber Niger,3 was made, when Engelard de Stretton, being one of the king's vassals, returned that he \" has only one knight, viz., Richard Fitz Odo, and that he has no knight of the new feoffment,\" which means that he held only one knight's fee in capite, and that the knight then holding it under Engelard was Richard Fitz Odo. Ofthe knight, Richard Fitz Odo, returned in 1165 as holding 1 Dugdale's Warwickshire. a list before the first Sunday of Lent (March 17, 1 166) of all who held under him by knight's service; stating whether such tenure was of old or of new feoff ment: that is, whether it had existed from the days of Henry I., or had arisen since. It is a valuable national record. 2 Domesday, so. 257, b 2. 3 The record called the Liber Niger or Black Book of the Exchequer, is mainly the result of an order made in the year 1 165 or beginning of 1166, on every ten ant in capite of the Crown, to return"], [89, "61 this manor under Engelard de Stretton, styled simply Richard de Ruiton, either this man or his son appears as witness to various deeds affecting land in the neighbourhood, between the years 1190 and 1230. In 1211, Richard de Ruiton is entered as one of the king's tenants by serjeantry, in the count)' of Salop, his service being to find one serving foot-soldier with a lance, for the ward of the king's castle of Shrawardin*. His successor was John de Ruiton, after whom came William de Ruiton, who gave lands to Wombridge Priory. But Buildwas Abbey profited to a much greater extent by the grants and alienations of this William. He had sold Ryton Mill to Hugh, Lord of Weston, who gave it to Buildwas Abbey, the lord of the fee confirming the grant in the following terms : \" I William, Lord of Ritton, have granted and confirmed to God and Saint Mary, and the monks of Bildewas, a certain mill in the vill of Ritton, which the monks have of the gift of Sir Hugh de Weston. I have granted it free from all earthly service, with easements, and free pasturage for their horses and beasts of burden coming to the mill in places nearest thereunto, except corn-fields, and meadows under crop ; also I grant that the miller for the time being may have around the same mill, cocks, hens, capons, geese, ganders, chickens, and ducks ; also, I quit the whole by let at the back of the said mill, as on all sides the water bounds it ; also a certain meadow in the vill of Ritton, which the monks have of the gift of Thomas de Mar- ham, near the meadow called the Moremede, which they have of my gift ; witnesses, Sir Hugh Weston, etc. By another deed, similarly attested, the Lord of Ryton granted to Buildwas \" a certain plat of ground in the territory of Ruton, thus bounded, viz., from a certain cross which stands on the boundary between Cospeford [Cosford] and Archesleg [Atchley] along a road to Crassitismere [Crasset's mere], and thence along a made fence to a certain white thorn, and thence to the headland of a certain culture, which extends to Trendelleswallemerch, and thence to a place called Munebehatch, and thence along the highroad, as far as the first-named cross.\" He grants to the monks also \" common pasture for all their animals in their granges of Gospesford and of Hatton, without number, taxation, or count, through his whole Fee of Ruton, except in a tract of land fenced by a footpath, which passes from his greater Stew to the highroad outside his court-house at Atchley, towards Ryton, and so along the said road to Calvercroft, and thence to Cecilie's Meadow. If the monks' cattle happen to"], [90, "62 stray within this boundary, they shall not be impounded, but restored without trouble; but if they be found there with a keeper, surety shall be taken from said keeper for reasonable damages, to be settled by two umpires, within eight days after the trespass. The monks may also make a bridge across the water of Wergh [Worse] over which they can drive their cattle to said pasture from Hatton.\" Such, and so extensive, were the privileges conferred by the Lord of Ryton on Buildwas Abbey, which, passing subsequently to the statute of mortmain,1 required a royal licence ; and such was granted, after an inquisition held in 1285 had reported in favour of the monks. Does the reader of the present day ask what had the monks to do with agriculture ; we answer, more than is generally supposed, for they were the first systematic farmers, and, to this day the broad acres of England bear the impress stamped upon them hj their former monastic possessors. Better was it for the community at large, including the great subject population, in that period of oppression which succeeded the Conquest, that the land should be intrusted to the keeping of a set of harmless and industrious monks, than that it should continue to lie comparatively neglected in the hands of the iron-clad Norman nobles. Yet Edward was right in passing the statute of mortmain. It was high time ; otherwise the wily men of the cloister would have relieved the thick-headed superstitious lay lords of every acre. Ryton Church. Ryton Church is inferred to have existed in 1186, from the circumstance that the priest of Ryton attested a charter of that date. According to Pope Nicholas' taxation, in 1291, the church of Ryton, in the diocese of Lichfield and Coventry, the archdeaconry of Salop, and deanery of Newport, was valued at \u00a32 per annum. In 1341, the parish was taxed 10s. only to the ninth, because much land lay untilled by reason of the poverty and _ ' The statute of mortmain (mortmain signifies such a state of possession as makes it inalienable), passed in the year 1279, during the reign of King Edward I. It prevented the clergy from making new acquisitions of lands, which, by the eccle siastical canons, they were for ever pro hibited from alienating. King Edward's object was to maintain the number of knight's fees, and, as a consequence, the military force of the kingdom, and also to prevent the superiors from being de frauded of the profits of wardship, mar riage, livery, and other emoluments arising from the feudal tenures. So great a check did this enactment give to the acquisition of lands by the monks, that they specially entitled it, ''Hie statute.''"], [91, "63 quitting of the occupiers, etc. The Valor of 1534 returns \u00a36 as the value of this benefice, less 6s. 8d. for procurations, and Is. 5d. for synodals.

He [Osbern] found it waste.\" 2 As in Ryton, and, probably from a similar cause, Osbern Fitz Richard's seig neury in Brockton reverted to the crown some fifty years after Domesday. On the re-arrangement of the divisional system of Shropshire, in the time of Henry I., Brockton became involved with the neighbouring manor of Sutton. The Broctone of the Conqueror's time, says Eyton \" was possibly represented by a tenement of two virgates, held, subsequently, under the Crown by petit sergeantry. The immediate tenants bore the name of Russel, and their service was that of castle guard at Shrawardine.\" In 1211, a William Russel was the king's tenant in Brockton, holding it by service of \" the finding of one serving foot-soldier, with a bow for ward of the king's castle of Srawrthin.\" 3 The Feodary of 1284 gives Alexander le Cold as holding half a virgate in the vill ol Brocton in capite, by service of going with the king into Wales in time of war, with one lance, for a week.

The church of Bold, in Stottesden Deanery, in 1291, was valued at \u00a34 6s. 8d. ; but the parish was taxed only \u00a32 6s. 8d. to the ninth in 1341, because two virgates lay unfilled, the tenants having quitted through poverty ; there were no sheep in it, etc. No mention is made of either church or chapel here in 1534. It is conjectured, that the following entry in Domesday refers to Broseley. \" The same Helgot holds Bosle. Gethne held it, and was a free man. Here is i hide geldable.

No cure of souls went with the new foundation, whose Incumbent was usually beneficed else where.

In demesne are ii teams and vi serfs, and xii villains, and iiii boors with vii teams ; and a certain knight has here i team and ii serfs. In the time of King Edward it was worth 40s. [per annum], now it is worth the same.\" ' Manorially associated from earliest time with Iteshale or Shiffnal, it is supposed that Sudtone was so named from its position in the southern quarter of that great Saxon parish. With Tong and Do nington, these had constituted an estate of the Earls of Mercia. In the desperate attempt which, in 1068, the English made to liberate themselves from the yoke of their oppressors, the brothers Edwin and Morcar, joint tenants of the earldom of Mercia, as is well known, took a part. The Conqueror's vigor was too great for the patriots, however ; sanguinary vengeance and devastation, 1 Domesday, so. 259, a 1. F"], [94, "66 accompanied by a wholesale spoliation, followed, when in 1071, among the remnant of scattered Saxons who sought that camp of refuge, the marsh-environed Isle of Ely, were Edwin and Morcar. Here, in the last refuge of Anglo-Saxon independence, the Mer cian earls might have smiled at the futile efforts of William's heavy-clad Norman men-at-arms to dispossess them ; but the' Englishman foolishly suffered himself to be duped by the false protestations of \"the Bastard,\" and quitting the camp of refuge for the Court, as he had been persuaded, scarce had Morcar set, foot beyond the patriot entrenchments, than seized, he was loaded with irons, and cast into a dungeon. Edwin then left the Isle of Ely, to make another grand effort for the deliverance of his country and captured brother. Yet no sooner was he in a position to make the attempt, when some of his attendants betrayed him to the Normans. At the head of twenty of his knights, Edwin made a heroic defence against enormous odds, retreating back wards as he fought. At length, stopped by a swollen brook, he fell, overcome by numbers. His enemies cut off his head, and carried it to the Conqueror, who wept, it is said, over the fate of one whom he woidd fain have attached to his fortune. Committed to the custody of Roger de Beaumont, who probably guarded him in one of his castles of Beaumont, Brionne, or Pon taudemcr, some sixteen years afterwards, as the Conqueror lay on bis death-bed, he was reminded of Morcar, the Saxon noble, who still languished in prison. Full of remorse at the remembrance of his many atrocities, the dying Conqueror released him. Imme diately upon the death of his father, the hard Rufus, however, again sent back to a prison the unfortunate Earl of Mercia, out of which it does not appear that he ever returned. Such was the end of the Saxon earls Edwin and Morcar, \u2014 such the calamities inflicted by the Norman Conquest on \" two bro thers,\" who, even according to Norman author^,1 once \"were zealous in the worship of God, and respected good men. Thev were remarkably handsome, their relations were of high birth and very numerous, their estates were vast and gave them immense power, and their popularity was great. The clergy and monks offered continual prayers on their behalf, and crowds of poor daily supplications.\" Upon the re-distribution of the conquered province of Mercia, 1 Ordericus Vitalis, B. IV. ch. iv."], [95, "67 Earl Roger de Montgomery entered Shropshire to possess and rule, when Gerard de Tornai, one of his followers, received as the meed of service, eighteen valuable Saxon manors, of which the largest was Sutton. Gerard was one of those western magnates who, upon the acces sion of Rufus, rebelled against him. At any rate, de Tornai's career in Shropshire terminated, about 1088, in a total and abso lute forfeiture. The disinherited baron had a daughter, Sibil, wife of Hamo Peverel, who, by special favor of the suzerain, king, or earl under whom Gerard de Tornai had held, acquired a succession to the forfeited estate, under a title from the first ambiguous. Some1 say that the Peverels descended from a Saxon ancestress, who, first concubine of William, Duke of Normandy, afterwards married Ranulf Peverel, of Hatfield. There is much mystery about the matter, yet certain it is, that the Shropshire Peverels attended the Court and enjoyed the favor of Henry I. Of this branch, Hamo Peverel undoubtedly held Sutton during the reign of that king. Some twenty years after the death of Hamo, Jorwerth Goch, a Welsh prince, the \" Red Edward \" of border traditions, was associated with the Fief of Gerard de Tornai. This Cymrian renegade was one of those tools used by the Anglo- Norman kings to disintegrate the national unity of North Wales. Whether Jorwerth acquired Sutton by marriage or as a bribe, is unknown. His elder brother, Madoc, was in the pay of Henry II. The following, from the Pipe Roll, may illustrate the policy of the Anglo-Norman kings with respect to their attempts at the acqui sition of Wales. William Fitz Alan, Sheriff of Shropshire, in 1157 rendered account of a sum of \u00a37 6s. 4d., being the current year's Ferm of the land of Gerard de Tornai. Of this sum he had paid \u00a33 6s. into the King's treasury ; the balance of \u00a34 Os. 3d. he had handed over to Gerverd Coch, by orders of Becket, the Chancellor, and Leicester, Chief Justice of England. At the same time, by order of the King, he had made presents of \u00a38 10s. to Maddoch, and \u00a32 to Gervase. The year 1157 was the one in which Henry II. undertook his Welsh campaign. It was a failure ; and the Anglo-Norman sove reign sought by trusty agents to accomplish that which he was unable to do by more open means. Intrigue and bribery accord- Dugdale, Baronage.

The services of Gervase were therefore no longer needed, and we hear no more of him. In 1186-7, Madoc, son of Gervase Ghoc, granted to Wombridge Priory the advowson of his church at Sutton. To Madoc succeeded his brother Griffith de Sutton, the peculiarity of whose serjeantry is explained by a return of the year 1211. \" He holds,\" says the record,1 \" Sutton and Brocton, of the gift of King Henry II. , by service of being Lotimarius (or King's Interpreter), between Eng land and Wales.\" Griffin, the Welshman, gave land to the monks, one of his grants to Wombridge Priory being a rent of 24 cocks and hens, which he received for an assart in Sutton. To Griffin succeeded another Madoc as Lord of Sutton, and from him it was that the manor acquired the distinctive appellation Sutton Mad dock. He held it forty years, a chief among the knights who constituted the Court of the County of Shropshire. Madoc sold Sutton to John le Strange, who thereupon became lord of this manor. The aged \" Latimarius \" fell, it is supposed, in one of the many conflicts that took place between the English and the Welsh towards the close of Henry III.'s reign. Madoc's end is en shrouded in uncertainty ; yet the probability is, representing as he did a house that, connected with the English king, had caused an immense deal of injury to be inflicted on Wales, he fell at the hands of his enraged fellow-countrymen. Sutton Maddock abounded in sub-infeudations and tenancies, the principal of wliich granted by Griffin Goch, Lord of Sutton to Ralph de Sandford, may be termed the Sandford Fee. Ralph, by purchasing, largely extended his footing in Sutton, when, worldly wise, he sub-let his acquisitions to the utmost advantage.

Yet both they and the shorn occupants of Wombridge Priory likewise have long since passed away, and a few half-obliterated mouldering parchments are all that survive to remind us that they once lived. Sutton Church. This church, about 1186-7, was given, as we have said, by Madoc, son of Jorwerth Goch, to Wombridge Priory. In 1206, the Bishop of Coventry sanctioned an appropriation thereof by Wombridge Priory. In 1291, the church of Sutton Madok was valued at \u00a34 13s. 4d. In 1341, the parish was rated at only \u00a33 to the ninth, because four virgates of land lay unfilled, etc. The Valor of 1534-5 omits to notice this church under the deanery of Newport.

It appearing that persons throughout the kingdom holding lands of the king by serjeantry, having wholly or in part alienated the same without license of the Crown, a commission issued in 1246 1 Domesday, so. 259, a I."], [98, "70 to Henry de Wingeham Escheator citra Trent, appointing him with an associate knight in each county and a jury if he pleased, to make inquest into the state of all serjeantries. Shortly after, a similar commission, issued to Robert Passelewe, treasurer of King Henry III, in virtue of which he visited many counties to \" take fines\" and \"make arrentations\" of serjeantries, that is, to provide for the clue fulfilment of the services attached to the tenures, and exact a certain annual rent in money by way of composition for every alienation without license of the Crown. One of the results of Passelewe's visit to Shropshire was to find that the \" serjeantry of John le Bret, which was formerly Henry de Stockton's, in Stockton, for which he was bound to provide for the lord king one serving foot-soldier, with bow and arrows, for fifteen days, at his own cost, in garrison of Shrawardine Castle in time of war, etc.,\" had become in part the subject of alienation. The vill of Ewdness, a member of the Domesday, Stockton pro bably became detached when, after the forfeiture of De Tornai, both were in the king's hands. It then constituted a distinct serjeantry, the service being that its tenant should accompany the sheriff of Shropshire when, twice every year, the latter conveyed the ferm or revenue of the county to the Exchequer, the king paying all charges. Stockton Church. This is supposed to have been founded by one of the De Laci's, seigneural lords of Highford, shortly after Domesday. According to the taxation of 1291, the church of Stockton, with its chapel (Boningale), was worth \u00a34 13s. 4d. ; the Prior of St. Guthlac, Hereford, also receiving a pension of 6s. 8d. therefrom. In 1341, the parish was assessed only \u00a33 6s. 8d., because a recent murrain had destroyed the sheep, etc. In 1534 the rectory of Stoketon, with the chapel of Bonynghal, in the deanery of Newport, was valued at \u00a314, less 6s. 8d. for procurations, and 2s. 3d. for synodals. is twice alluded to in Domesday. In one part of the Conqueror's record we are told that : \u2014 \" The same Gerard holds Etone, and William [holds] of him. Turgod held it and was a free man. Here half a hide geldable. There is land enough for iii ox-teams. In demesne is i [team] and i serf and iiii boors ; also, there is i guest [liospes~] paying a rent of 2s. In time of"], [99, "71 King Edward its value was 12s. ; now it is worth 11s. He [Gerard] found it waste.\" ' In another place, Domesday says, that : \u2014 \" The same Rainald [the sheriff] holds in Etone half a hide. Turgot held it for a single manor and paid geld.\"2 The Etone of Domesday is identical with the modern Hatton. A small stream called Tuy Brook, of which traces remain, coursed through the original manor, dividing it into two equal parts, one of which lying to the eastward of the stream, Adam de Hetune gave to Buildwas Abbey in 1189. The monks now had an eye to the land on the west of Tuy Brook. A footing they acquired here when John de Hemes gave to Buildwas a virgate and 12 acres of his demesne in Hettun. They obtained a further hold, when Walter, son of this John, with assent of his mother, his heirs, and his friends, added to his father's donation \" all the land which is between the road of Hyvelith [Evelith] and Tinbroc,\" for which the monks received the grantor, his mother and his heirs, into their fraternity. About 1248, Robert Traynel, Lord of Hattone, for the health of his soul gave them the remaining portion ; and thus, at length, the monks of Buildwas Abbey acquired complete possession of this manor, which continued in their hands until the Dissolution. derived its name apparently from having been founded or owned by some Anglo-Saxon Alberic or Albrecht. According to Domesday : \u2014 \" The same Normannus holds Al bricstone. Algar and Godhit held it for two manors. Here one hide and a half geldable. There is land for iiii ox-teams. In demesne are iii such teams ; and xiii serfs and iii villains, and hi boors with i team. The wood here will fatten 100 swine ; but at present it is in the king's hand. In time of King Edward the manor was worth 21s. [per annum] ; now it is worth 16s. He [Norman] found it waste.\"3 It is not unlikely that the Algar alluded to above was Algar, Earl of Mercia, whose extensive possessions included Pattingham, a manor not far distant from Albrighton. \" Normannus Venator,\" or Norman hunter \u2014for such was his name \u2014 held six other manors 1 Domesday, so. 259, a I. 2 Ibidem, so. 255, a 2. 3 Ibidem, so. 259, a 2."], [100, "72 besides Albrighton under Roger de Montgomery, the Norman Earl of Shrewsbury ; the service by which he held them probably being implied in his name. The locality of two of his manors cannot be determined ; but in the other five he appears to have been succeeded by the Pichfords, who, for two centuries, held the fief of Norman Venator of the Crown. Albrighton was the reputed caput or centre of this fief, the whole being held by ser vice of one knight's fee. The gallant services of Ralph de Pichford, at the siege of Brug in 1102, have been alluded to.1 Upon Ralph's decease, his son Richard de Pichford became Lord of Albrighton, who again was succeeded by Hugh. In 1194, this Hugh de Pichford paid 20s. scutage, or shield-tax, the sum assessed on every knight's fee held in capite for King Richard's redemption. In 1195 and in 1197 De Pichford's scutage was assessed at the same rate in support of Richard's war with France ; but, in the years 1199, 1201, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6 successively, from some cause' or other, King John charged him scutage enormously in excess of the current assess ment on a single knight's fee. Thus, in 1199, he was charged 40s., although \u00a31 6s. 8cl. was the current rate ; in 1204 he was charged six merks, the rate being only two-and-a-half. These facts indicate one of the causes that alienated from King John his impoverished feudatories. To Hugh succeeded Ralph de Pichford II. , who assessed to various scutages and aids in 1235, was charged two merks for the aid levied on marriage of the sister of King Henry III., and in 1245 \u00a31 to the aid for marriage of the king's daughter. Besides their stated service according to feudal custom, the king was entitled to scutage or aid from his tenants in these three cases ; the king's captivity, the knighting of his eldest son, and the marrying of his eldest daughter. It was one of the points stipu lated for in Magna Charta that the king should impose no scutage or aid upon his subjects without the consent of the barons. The King's Exchequer, in the Anglo-Norman time, was also largely recruited by the system of fines and gifts. Thus, this very Ralph de Pichford, in 1232 fined 40s. with the Crown, for the privilege of holding a market and fair at his manor of Albrighton, for which he obtained the king's charter ; and we read, that, in 1234, he gave the king the large sum of 300 merks to have 1 Page 33-"], [101, "73 marriage of the heirs, and custody of the lands in Ireland, of John Fitz-Dermot, deceased. In 1252, Ralph himself was dead, as, that year, Fitz-Nicholas fined 100 merks with the king for custody of his land, and heir, including the marriage of the latter. De Pichford's estate, in 1254, was charged 40s. to the aid for knighting Prince Edward, the king's eldest son ; 40s. in 1260, for the scutage of Wales; and, when the army destined by the ambitious Edward I. for the con quest of that country, stood summoned to meet at Worcester on July 1st, 1277, John de Pychford, knight, acknowledged his service clue on a knight's fee at Albrighton, and was ready to discharge it in person. Ralph de Picheford, son of John, suc ceeded him as lord of Albrighton. He was the last of his line who had an interest here, as he sold the manor to Sir John de Tregoz, upon whose decease, Albrighton fell to his grandson, Sir John de la Warre. There were various under-tenants in Albrighton. Albrighton Church. This church has a western tower, the lower part of which belongs to the 12th century, which tallies with the mention of Nicholas, priest of Albrighton in 1186-7. The church of Al bryton, in the deanery of Newport and archdeaconry of Salop, in 1291 stood at \u00a35 6s. 8d. When Ralph de Pichford sold the manor of Albrighton to Sir John de Tregoz, he sold the advowson of this church to Walter de Langton, bishop of Lichfield and Coventry, upon which sale a fine was levied by special order of the king. Bishop Langton retained the advowson but a short time. In 1341, the parish was rated only \u00a33 6s. 8d. to the ninth, because the abbot of Buildwas had three carucates of land in the parish, etc. The Valor of 1534 gives the vicarage of Albrighton as worth \u00a36 per annum, less 8s. for procurations and 2s. for synodals ; but the honest abbot of Dore returned it as worth \u00a36 13s. 4d. Durino- the alterations which a few years since were made in Albrighton church, in lowering the floor of the south aisle, a very ancient stone altar tomb was discovered lying about eighteen inches below the surface. In the early Enghsh style, it is orna mented by a number of coats of arms relating to the Pichford, the Despencer, and other families. From the circumstance, that neither Sandford in his Church-notes of 1660, nor Johnson in 1699, mention this tomb, it is inferred, that it had lain under the ground"], [102, "74 for over 200 years. This relic of the past has been carefully placed outside the church. Early Incumbent. \u2014 Nicholas, priest of Albriton, 1186-7. We read of John de Aston being admitted to the \" newly founded\" vicarage of Albrighton in 1329, on presentation of abbot and convent of Dore. Johnson particularly noted in 1699, in the south aisle of Al brighton church a marble tomb, which is now nowhere to be found. He adds that the windows of the south aisle contained twelve coats of arms in \" very old glass.\" These associated the names of Lang ton, De Burgh, Montford, Pichford, Giffard, and Davenant with this house, which, many ages ago, was set apart for the public worship of God. JjifiluOlT, originally Bishops-ton at some period anterior to existing records, doubtless, was attached to some episcopal see. Domesday informs us that : \u2014 \" Normannus [Venator] holds Bispetone. Turgod held it and was a free man. Here i hide geldable. The land is [capable of employing] vi ox-teams. Here two Frenchmen with iiii villains and ii boors have iii teams. There is a wood which will fatten x swine. In time of King Edward the manor was worth 30s. [per annum] ; now it is worth 10s.\" ' Like Norman Venator's other manors, Bishton descended to De Pichford, when it gradually became a mere member of Albrighton. now a township in the parish of Chetton is men tioned in D.omesday Book. From that record we learn, that : \u2014 \" Walcheline holds Faventrei. Ulchetel, Archetel, Uluiet, \u00c6lwi, Ordwi, and Ordric held it, and those thanes were free. Here are ii hides geldable. There is land enough for v ox-teams. In demesne is one team' and a half ; and i serf, ii villains, and v boors, with ii teams. In time of King Edward it was worth 27s. ; now 20s. He [Walcheline] found it waste.\"2 (i^llllCU, in 1086, was a member of the fief held by Turold de Verity, under the Norman earl.

The arable land is for ii ox-teams. Here those teams are, together with ii villains and ii boors. Its value was and is 5s.\"1 It is a disputed point, whether Turold, the Domesday lord of Willey was a Saxon or Norman. Blakeway says he was a Saxon. Eyton argues that he was a Norman. The latter, however, shows that the name occurs in Normandy before the Conquest, and was borne by several who profited by the Norman invasion. Assuming that he was a Norman, this man then held thirteen manors under Earl Roger de Montgomery. Exhibiting a partizanship, although it was but slight, with the wicked De Belesme, Turold managed to escape summary forfeiture upon the fall of his suzerain ; and, granting lands to Shrewsbury Abbey, he died before 1121. Robert, his son, succeeded, of whom nothing further is known than that, like his father, he also gave lands to the monks. By the close of the 12th century, Fitz-Turold's interest in Willey had passed to Chetwynd, who held under Fitz-Alan. As to Hunnit, who held under Turold at the time of the survey, he doubtless was one of those few who were suffered by the con querors to retain an interest in a soil that had been their fathers'. \" This continuous Saxon interest in the manor,\" says Eyton, \"was probably the cause of its non-diminution of value since the time of Edward the Confessor, as well of its being cultivated to its full capability when the Domesday Commissioners took their account of it.\" The Norman genlile-hommes, better at wielding lance or long sword than at handling the plough, affected to despise such homely but useful avocations. Yet, when they permitted any of the sub ject race to hold lands, it was not the policy of their oppressors to suffer them to retain them in places where, old associations awa kening, might lead to a spirit of resistance ; and there is a strong presumption that Hunnit was eventually thus dealt with. At any rate, a new feoffee, in no w=ay related to Hunnit or his heirs, Warnerius by name, it is supposed became lord of Willey, whose family inheriting other estates of the fee of Chetwynd, per haps acquired Willey by favour of its chief lord. This War nerius, or Warner, was ancestor of a family which took its surname from the Manor of Willey. Third in succession from Warnerius, occurs Warner de Willeley, 1 Domesday, so. 25s, a 1"], [106, "76 who, marrying the daughter of Roger Fitz Odo, with her acquired much property. Not satisfied with such increase, however, this man was convicted of an act of treacherous oppression, which, even in a period when oppression was rife, brought down on him the censure of the law. Coveting the land of one whom feudal law bound him to protect, Warner de Willeley and his wife contrived that his vassal, by a false information, should appear guilty of a capital crime. The assumed felon was arrested, and his chattels sold by a king's bailiff. Should he be finally outlawed, his lands of course became forfeit to the lord of the fee. It was a deeply planned scheme ; yet, cunning although it was, there remained for the unfortunate victim a chance of obtaining, at the hands of the king's justices, that equity which a local court denied him. The case was gone into at the assizes of November, 1221, when the innocency of the accused being fully established, the oppressing lord, with his satellite, the king's bailiff, in their turn were com mitted to prison. It was a characteristic of that dark age that no crime was without its fiscal equivalent. The culprit who could pay, got off, and, accordingly, a fine of five merks released the scoundrel, Warner de Willeley, who shortly afterwards figured as one of the principal personages in Shropshire. Leagued with others as desperate as himself, Andrew de Wille ley, the grandson of this man, terminated a turbulent career upon the field of Evesham. He left an infant daughter to inherit his forfeited estate \u2014 forfeit, that is, until such time as, according to the dictum de Kenilworth, it was, by payment of a heavy sum of money, redeemed. Burga, for that was her name, years after ward marrying Richard de Harley, to her posterity bv him was transmitted the splendid, and, at length disencumbered, domain of De Willeley. ' Willey Church. Probably founded and endowed by the lords of the manor, this church appears as the subject of litigation in 1214. In 1291, the church or chapel of Wyleleye, in the deanery of Wenlock, was valued at \u00a35 6s. 8d. per annum, a pension of 7s. beino- annually payable to the priory kitchen, under the title of, \" The Chapel of Welyley.\" The parish was assessed only 40s. in 1341, because of tempests and murrain, etc. In 1534, the value of this benefice was \u00a35 6s. 8d. per annum, less 6d. for synodals. The rectors of Willey without cure were probably non-resident. Early Incumbent. \u2014 Adam de Wetenhale, 1276"], [107, "77 Willey, like Broseley, in the time of Richard I. was transferred to the then newly-created Liberty of Wenlock, in which it has ever since remained. cCtyltfllill \"It is often doubtful,\" says Eyton, \"whether places with this termination owe it to the Saxon heall, a hall, or hul, a hill.\" The manor is thus noticed in Domesday: \u2014 \"The same church [St. Milburg] held, and still holds, Dehocsele. Here half a hide geldable. In demesne is i ox-team ; and ii boors, and i cottar with i team and i serf is here. [In time of King Ed ward] it was worth 10s. [per annum] ; now it is worth 20s.\" ' From Saxon times until the Reformation, the monastery of Wenlock possessed the manor of Deuxhill ; yet, the chartularies of this once renowned priory being either lost or destroyed, un fortunately we know but little of its dependencies. The Church Alluded to under Glazeley, the chapel of Deuxhill, was founded as early as 1115. According to the taxation of 1291, the annual value of the church of Deukeshull, with the chapel of Mitletone, was under \u00a34. Singularly enough, it is not mentioned in the Inquisition of 1341. In 1535, Deuxhill was united to Glazeley, of which the then value has been given. Early Incumbent. \u2014 Sir Robert de Mudle, chaplain, 1278, was presented by the prior and convent of Wenlock to the chapels of Middleton Priors, and Deuxhill. During the war with France, in the 14th century, the king presented to Deuxhill ; and, for the same reason, viz., because the king held in his hands the alien priory of Wenlock, in 1388, the Crown was still presenting to this church. Yet the hero of Crecy and Poictiers had long since sunk into a premature grave ; the broken-hearted Edward III. had followed : and now that great war, which for fifty long years the English kings had waged for the crown of France, lingering in the hands of the weak Richard II. , drew to a close. fjiljIUhOni.

It may have been then, that this name originated from a prevalence of some such plant in the locality, and that in the Domesday Pichetorne, we have another proof of the wide-spreading hold the Vikings of the North once had over the midland counties of England. Not many miles distant from Pickthorn is Danesford. Chester and Derby, as is well known, were \"Danish Burghs.\" We read, in Domesday Book, that, \" The same church [St. Milburg] held [in Saxon times], and still holds, Pichetorne.

Of this family, whose surname has been variously traced to Basqueville in the Pays de Caux, or to Boscherville in the forest of Roumare, near Rouen, the Norman localities whence issued, probably to take part in Duke William's adventure, the founder of the Anglo-Norman Baskervilles, whose branches, early in the 13th century, spread wide over Shropshire, Herefordshire, Northamptonshire, War wickshire, Norfolk, Bucks, and Wilts ; Radulf de Basker vill, in 1165, held land in Herefordshire under Adam de Port. His tenure was of old feoff ment : that is, he held or inherited his land from a period antecedent to the death of Henry I. in 1135. There is reason to believe that this man became lord of Pickthorn. Ralph Baskerville was murdered, in Northampton shire, previously to 1194, and his son had succeeded him, as at that date the Escheator accounts 8d. for the ferm of \" Piketorn Tom\u00e6,\" which means, for Thomas de Baskerville's land of Pick thorn. Roger de Baskerville was returned in 1316 as lord of Pikethorn, in Shropshire.2 Cadets of the family of Baskerville figure among the under tenants in Pickthorn.

From Roger de Montgomery, the Norman Robert Fitz-Tetbald then received the ruined manor, and he restored it to its former worth. This Robert Fitz-Tetbald, who, besides Idsall, held three other Shropshire Manors, appears not only a witness, but a coadjutor in Earl Roger's endowment of Shrewsbury Abbey. \"Robert, son of Theobald, gave them [the monks,]\" says the earl, \" the Church of Iteshale, with the tithes of the same vill.\" 2 From the survey of Sussex, he appears to have been by far the greatest feoffee in Roger de Montgomery's earldom of Arundel and Chiehester ; and, although his shrievalty is nowhere noticed in Domesday, doubtless it was in relation to his great southern fief, rather than to any connection with Shropshire, that Robert Fitz-Tetbald acquired his title of Vicecomes. Robert, Yicecomes, does not appear to have been involved in the fall of De Belesme. During the reign of Henry I., both his Shropshire and Sussex fiefs, however, lapsed to. the Crown; yet, whether by surrender, forfeiture, or failure of heirs, cannot be determined.

Who then was Alan de Dunstanvill ? Yet let us first speak of Walter de Pinkney. The year 1139 saw an insurrection break out, which, speedily spreading, at length the whole kingdom was enveloped in the flames of a civil war. Then was witnessed in its direst form the most horrid of all kinds of war, that in which two parties of equal strength in the same country close in deadly strife ; when, amid the opposing ranks are seen brother fighting against brother, and the father against the son ; and when all ties of kindred and neighbourhood being fatally severed, their former friendship tends only to embitter and lend a keenness to the swords of the en sanguined combatants. England, peaceful and happy, has yet more than once since the Norman conquest been the theatre of civil war. We might point to the reigns of John and the weak Henry III., to the bloody wars of the roses, or, nearer our own clay, to the tiine of Charles I. Yet it may be questioned whether the confused and bloody drama was ever enacted amid circumstances of greater barbarity than during the nineteen long years that succeeded to the usurpation of Stephen. During that dark and unhappy period, England was literally in a state of anarchy. The ferocious Anglo-Norman nobility, unrestrained by any considerations, gave a full vent to their implacable rage against each other ; or, sallying from their turretted dens of infamy, trampled down, without remorse, the Saxons whom they detested. Cruelty, robbery, and lust, were the order of the day, for the punishment of which no power existed in the disjointed realm. Towns and villages were burned, the fields remained unploughed, and the rude implements of our forefather's industry were destroyed, or turned to purposes of self-defence by an oppressed and dejected peasantry. The cattle, beins. neglected, died ; and, as the inevitable result of all this sanguinary confusion, gaunt famine combined with crimson war to decimate the miserable inhabitants. It was amid the convulsions of this unhappy period, that Walter de Pinkney became possessed of the vast Wiltshire domains of his mother, Adeliza de Dunstanvill, widow of Reginald de Dunstan vill, alias Fitz Roy, one of the numerous illegitimate children of Henry I. De Pinkney was a staunch adherent of the usurper G"], [112, "82 The unknown, but contemporaneous author of the Acts of Stephen, tells us that as this Walter made a sortie from Malmesbury Castle, over which he kept ward for the usurper, William de Dover adroitly captured him, when the Empress Maude, \" having now in her power the man whom of all others she most hated, strove, both by her blandishments, and by threats of torture or death, to induce him to surrender Malmesbury Castle ; but he, resisting with constancy all the seductions of female influence and regardless of her menaces, could not be induced to comply with her demands.\" Hearing that his favourite had fallen into the empress's hands, the active Stephen hastened to reinforce the beleagured garrison, when, having relieved it, he turned his attention to other affairs. Meanwhile, annoyed at losing the castle through De Pinkney 's obstinacy, Maude loaded him with chains, and threw him into a loathsome dungeon, where he appears to have remained some years. At length, released from prison, through the assistance of Roger, Earl of Hereford, De Pinkney again flew to arms, and, surprising Christchurch Castle, Hants, then held for the empress, he put the garrison to the sword, and entered on the lordship of a wide district. But his sacrileges and cruelties, it is said, led to the formation of a conspiracy between the men of the lordship and the soldiers of the castle. One day, as Walter and his suite, passed from castle to church, he was waylaid b}' the conspirators, who, in the guise of suppliants, affected hunibly to implore him to cease his exactions. More im perious than ever, De Pinkney was in the act of replying, when one of the assassins sprang forward, and severed his head from his neck by a blow of his axe. The following is a translation of a curious charter which this man gave to Eewes Priory : \u2014 \" To the Yenerable Lord Prior of Lewes, etc., Walter de Pencheni greeting. Know ye that I give ye the church of Wintreburne, which my mother, Adeliza, gave ye. I give it after the decease of the clerk, my kinsman, to whom I granted it ; and as long as that clerk shall live he shall hold it of ye, and he shall pay ye every year, whilst the war shall last, 10s., and when God shall have given peace, he shall pay one merk of silver. But, after his decease, ye shall have it wholly and freely. Hugo de Cumbrevilla and his two brothers, Roger and Reinald de Insula being witnesses. This [I do] that I may par take in all the benefits of your Church.\" l 1 Lewes Chartuhry."], [113, "83 The deceased Walter de Pinkney had adhered to Stephen ; on the other side, his brother Robert, and that Alan de Dunstan vill to whom Henry I. gave Idsall, fought for the empress. Alan granted to Wombridge Priory half a virgate of land, which Eilric held in Leies (afterwards Prior's Lee), with all the children of the said Eilric : a grant which, by the way, proves him to have been lord of Idsall, for Lee was then a member of that manor. Alan also gave to Lewes Priory, Newtimber, Sussex. Dying about 1156, Walter de Dunstanvill, Alan's eldest son, became lord of Idsall, who, heir also of his uncle Robert, succeeded to vast estates in Wiltshire and Surrey, besides a large possession in Normandy. Of this man we have many notices. From the first, which occurs in 1156, we learn, that, by writ of Henry II., Walter's quota of the Danegeld, assessed on the county of Sussex* was excused. The sum excused was \u00a33. Again, in 1158, he was excused 14s. 6d\". his share of the dunum of the said county. In 1156, having been assessed \u00a31 6s. 3d. for the Danegeld of Shrop shire, being in arrear, Henry II. excused Walter ; and the king further excused him 16s., his proportion of the donum of Shrop shire.1 When the Danegeld was levied again in 1162, Walter de Dun stanvill was assessed at, and excused \u00a31 7s. 6d. in Shropshire, and \u00a32 8s. in Sussex. About 1168, having become heir to his uncle, Walter de Dun stanvill appears accordingly entered on the Pipe Roll among the Wiltshire grantees of the crown as having the manor and hun dred of Heytesbury, of \u00a340 annual value. Yet Walter had not long held his Wiltshire domains, when a break of two years and a half, which ended March 1173, in the otherwise uniform sheriff's account, appears to indicate a temporary forfeiture. Perhaps Walter was associated with the rebellion of Prince Henry .( At any rate, he does not seem to have been much of a favourite with Henry II. ; for, at Michaelmas, 1177, that monarch, sitting him self in judgment on those who were accused of trespassing on the royal forests, amerced Walter in \u00a3100, a sum enormously in excess of amercements inflicted on other great holders in Shropshire. Nor did King Richard show this baron greater favour, for one of the retinue of John, Earl of Moreton, and probably implicated in 1 Pot. Pip., 2, 3, and 4 Henry II."], [114, "84 the treason of that base prince, there is reason to believe that De Dunstanvill suffered forfeiture during the reign of the lion hearted. He certainly experienced either the civil death implied by for feiture, or that other decease, besides physical dissolution, which was wont to happen to men in those superstitious days, namely. the abandonment of the world and retirement into a monastery. It is most likely that, in 1194, this baron died all the three deaths, and was buried, according to his desire, in Wombridge Priory, to which, with other religious establishments, he had been a bene factor. Within the present century, an ancient effigy of a cross-legged knight, in mail armour, with surcoat, sword in scabbard by his side, left hand holding the scabbard, the right on the hilt of, as if about to draw the sword (a martial attitude), spurs on heels, head resting on a cushion, and the feet on a lion, was removed from Wombridge, where it had lain in the churchyard ever since the demolition of the old church, to the south aisle of the abbey church of ShrewsburjT. It was the monumental relic of Walter de Dun stanvill. Walter de Dunstanvill II. then became lord of the manor of Idsall, and heir to his father's other possessions, who, long a minor, about April, 1201, William Briwerr proffered to King John a fine of 300 merks to have custody of the lands and marriage of the heir of the deceased Walter de Dunstanvill. The fine was accepted, but afterwards cancelled ; for Gilbert Basset proffering 600 merks, double the amount Briwerr had offered for the same wardship, he got it. According to feudal practice, if the heir were a minor, the king retained the whole profit of the estate till his majority, giving what he chose for the maintenance and education of the young baron. Hy granting the wardship of a rich heir to any one, the sovereign could enrich a favourite ; or, by selling it, as John did the wardship of young Walter de Dunstanvill, large sums accrued thereby to the Anglo- Norman king's exchequer. Having attained his majority, styled the king's \" faithful and beloved,\" Walter de Dunstanvill II. , in 1215, had a grant of market and fair to be held in his Wiltshire manor of Heytesbury ; but, wavering, he finally seceded from King John's allegiance, when his lands were given to another. Among the number of those who gave in their allegiance to"], [115, "p. 84. TOM1! IN THE ABBEY CHURCH, SHREWSBURY.

Dying in 1241, King Henry III. received at Chester the homage of his son ancl heir, Walter de Dunstanvill III., when, having paid his relief of \u00a3100, the heir had seisin of his lands. This baron, in 1245, was assessed 20s. in respect of one fee in Ideshal, to the aid for marriage of the king's daughter ; and nine years later, he paid a similar amount towards making Prince Edward, the king's eldest son, a knight. He had a grant of market and fair in his manor of Hydeshale, and the subject of many cotemporary notices ; as one of the lord marchers, he had military summons to meet the king at Chester on July 1st, 1258, to oppose the incursions of the Welsh. Although he -fought against the king at Lewes, yet no permanent forfeiture was the result ; and, dying in 1270, numerous charters which Walter left behind, prove him to have been more friendly to the monks than his father had been. Indeed, except granting to the abbey of Haughmond a right of road through his land when going to or returning from Wiche, in Cheshire, where they had some salt pits, Walter's father does not appear to have conferred upon the monks any material benefits whatever ; yet, whether this indicated a lack of piety in him, as some averred ; or, whether it arose from his being of a less superstitious turn than his neighbours, we cannot determine. The customary inquisitions having been held as to the estate of the deceased baron, and his heir having been found to be Petro nilla, \u2022 wife of Robert de Montfort ; forthwith the king's writ issued to the escheator citra Trent, ordering him to give seisin of all Dunstanvill's lands to \" Robert de Montfort, who had married Petronilla, daughter and heir of the deceased \"; and he, accord ingly, in right of his wife, became lord of Idsall and other great estates. William, this man's son, sold Idsall to Bartholomew de Badlesmere, when, the race of Dunstanvill no longer connected with it, the place henceforth appears described by its other name of Shiffnal. The manor of Idsall involved many townships or members held by tenants of various rank and importance. Of these, Hunning ton or Hinnington was undoubtedly a member of the Domesday"], [118, "86 \" Iteshale,\" deriving its name, perhaps, from the Saxon Hunnit or Hunnine, who might have held it in the days of the Confessor. Alan de Dunstanvill, in the reign of Stephen, granted, as we have seen, to Wombridge Priory the land which Eilric held in Lees ; when the canons, having obtained a footing in Idsall, they gradually improved their position, until their estate, afterwards known as Prior's Lee, yielded them at the period of the dissolu tion \u00a314 9s. 2d. Hem, Wyke, and Leonard's Lee were also members of Idsall, the latter taking its name from Leonard, its early possessor, tenant of Dunstanvill. The tenement formerly named The Castle, the situation of which is still indicated by the \" castle farm,\" was not the residence of the lords of Idsall, being simply a minor member of their manor. Woodhouse, Haughton, and Knowi.e, also were formerly members of Idsall. About 1185, Roger, Walter de Dunstanvill's vassal at Haughton, being dead, the baron, in a charter singularly illustrative of feudal tenures and customs, granted, according to the following terms, to \" Oliver, his harper, custody of the land of the deceased, for his life, together with the widow of the said Roger, whom Oliver had already espoused, with Dunstanvill's consent. Also, Oliver was to have custody of the heir of Roger, and was to take order concerning the said heir according to his own will ; and this ward ship was to be free of tac and toi to Oliver and his men, and free of all services, except that Oliver was to mew one sparrow-hawk annually at his own cost, or to mew a goshawk at the cost of his lord ; in which case, the lord's men were to provide a cage wherein the bird should be placed.\" \"And, together with the aforesaid ward ship, I have given and conceded to the aforesaid Oliver, for his homage and service, and as a forestalment of his release from office, that reputed virgate of land which Achi and Swein of Knoll, have held, and all the assarts which I have given him in Long Rudigg, up to Sumerlone, as Smelebroc divides them ; and quittance of tac and of toi for him and his men ; and of all services and customs ; in fee and inheritance ; with all the appur tenances ; in wood and in field ; to hold of me and my heirs, by him and his heirs ; rendering therefore yearly, he or his heirs, to me or my heirs, on Easter-day, certain spurs or sixpence.\" ' Thus did the lord of Idsall provide for his harper, who became not only l A copy of this instructive Charter in the original Latin is given by Eyton.

The situation of Knowle may be identified by a small coppice still called \" The Knowle Wood.\" Drayton, Stanton, and Upton were also held under the lords of Idsall. Yet, besides the tenants who held all these various members of the ancient Idsall, its seigneur had other tenants in his manor of equal standing, whose interests were associated with the town itself. Thus, John de Stevinton, hereditary \"seneschal of the manor of Ideshal,\" attests a manorial deed in 1316 ; and Deve reux, whose name is spelt with all those varieties to which Norman names were subject, occurs as a juror in Idsall somewhat later. Shiffnal Church. This large structure has been erected at various dates. It con sists of a nave, with aisles and a south porch, north and south transept, central tower having large stair-turret at north-west angle, and the Moreton chancel or south aisle. Parts of the south transept, north wall of chancel, and also the chancel arch, in which latter the dog-tooth ornament appears, belong to the transitional period between the Norman and early English, say end of 12th century. The south porch is early English, latter half of 13th century ; the nave, the central tower, and parts of the chancel, belong to the decorated style, commence ment of 14th century ; the north transept is entirely of perpendi cular work, 15th century ; whilst the south aisle appears to be the work of the 16th century. Although Domesday does not mention the circumstance, a colle giate church doubtless existed at Itesale in Saxon times, which, re-established by Robert Fitz Tetbald, soon after the survey, was given by him to Shrewsbury Abbey. The Normans first restored the Saxon collegiate churches, and then disposed of them in such a way, as that they should eventually lose their collegiate charac ter. Thus, whilst repeating his donations to Shrewsbury, the Norman lord of the manor directed, that, as fast as the clerks or canons of Iteshale should die off, this church should come into the demesne of St. Peter. The collegiate character of the church, therefore, became gradually extinct, and its revenues absorbed in the treasury of a distant monastery. Thus the spiritual interests of the rural districts of the extensive Saxon parish of Iteshale, as in those other cases where great Saxon churches had been assigned"], [120, "88 to monasteries of Norman foundation, were utterly neglected. But in 1219, the Abbot of Shrewsbury and Walter de Dunstan vill II. were at issue respecting this church, when the advowson of Idsall returned to the lord of the manor. The church of Ydesale, in 1291, was valued at \u00a320 per annum ; besides a pension of 30s. which the Abbot of Salop received therefrom. In 1341, the parish was assessed only \u00a312 9s. to the ninth, because the corn had been destroyed by. storms, etc., and because Hatton Grange belonged to the Abbot of Buildwas. The Yalor of 1534 represents this vicarage as worth \u00a316 5s. 10d., less 16s. 8d. for procurations, and 2s. 6d. for synodals. The abbot's pension of 30s. out of Idsall church is duly returned among his receipts for the same year.

The possessions of this \" Eothbert Yicecomes\" reverted, from some cause or other, as we said, to the crown ; when the king re-granted them in such a way that his Shropshire manors, of which Kemberton was one, became associated with the earldom of Arundel and county of Sussex, rather than with the earldom of Shrewsbury and the county in which they lay.

Sir William de Hugford, one of Berner's descendants, fought for Henry III. in that civil war which beclouded the latter end of his reign. At the battle of Lewes, the king's power was shattered, himself and son being taken prisoners, when, masters of the realm, the rebellious barons compelled the king, their prisoner, to affix his seal to whatever documents they chose. Thus, on May 20, 1265, Henry III., then a captive at Hereford, was constrained by the rebels to mention Sir William de Hugford (his devoted ad herent) as one of those lords marchers who were to leave the kingdom for the peace thereof, as it was ironically expressed. But the lords marchers of Shropshire held fast their loyal principles, until, soon afterwards, at Evesham, the king regained his pre rogative. It appears that Sir William held his manor of Hugford, includ ing the vills of Norton, Apley, and Astall, under the suzerainty of Richard Fitz Alan, by the service of two knights for forty days, in war time, at his own charges. The latest notice of him is that of 1297, when he was summoned as holding lands of \u00a320 annual value, to prepare himself with horses and arms for foreign service. ' Sir Walter de Hugford IY., his son and successor, sat as a knight of the shire in the Parliament which met at Westminster, on January 20, 1315 ; and also in the one summoned to meet at York, on May 2, 1322. He was succeeded by several generations in the male line, until, eventually, Alice de Hugford carried the estate into the family of Lucy of Charlcote.

Florence of Worcester, under date 1006, says, \"the crafty and treacherous Edric Streon, insidiously plotting against the noble Ealdorman \u00c6lf helm, prepared a great entertainment at Shrews bury, to which he invited him. \u00c6lfhelm, accepting the invitation, was welcomed by Edric Streon as his intimate friend ; but, on the third or fourth day of the feast, he took him to hunt in a wood, where he had laid an ambuscade ; and, when all were engaged in the chase, a ruffian of Shrewsbury, called Godwin Port-Hund, which signifies, the town's hound, who had been long before bribed by the profuse gifts and promises of Edric to commit the crime, suddenly sprung from his ambush, and basely assassinated the earldorman.\" A short time afterwards, his sons, Wulfheag and Ufgeat, were, by King Ethelred's orders, deprived of sight at Corfham. In the following year, continues this accurate chroni cler, \"the king made the before-mentioned Edric, son of Ethelric, ealdorman of Mercia. He was a man, indeed, of low origin, but his smooth tongue gained him wealth and high rank ; and, gifted with a subtle genius and persuasive eloquence, he surpassed all his contemporaries in malice and perfidy, as well as in pride and cruelty\" : assertions amply borne out by the contemporary writer in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. It would be difficult to point out a baser or more contemptible villain than this renegade Saxon, or one who has obtained a more unenviable notoriety in the chronicles of his country. To his traitorous counsel and action, it had been mainly owing that the English finally succumbed to the Dane. Amid the horrors of that strife which raged between the Saxons and the Danes, Ethelred the Unready departed this life, A.D. 1016. \" The Etheling,\" a resolute man of extraordinary strength, natural son of Ethelred, was then chosen king by the Anglo-Saxons. He raised the fortunes of the English , and took London from King Knut. But Edmund \" Ironside's \" glorious reign was but of a brief year's duration. Harassed by a sanguinary conflict with the Dane, this brave Saxon monarch had but barely terminated a hopeless struggle, by consenting to divide England with the invader, when he was murdered by emissaries of his kinsman, the execrable Duke Edric. Satisfactory it is to know that this traitor to his country ulti mately met his deserts. Knut the Great, or Canute, as he is"], [128, "92 generally but incorrectly named, had been crowned king of all England, when, one day, Edric and the Conqueror had words. King Knut despised the man, and knowing how unpopular he was, only waited for a pretext to rid his presence of him. The quarrel went on. Edric, presuming on the credit of his perfidious service to the Dane, had got the length of reproaching the king by saying) \" I first deserted Edmund for your sake, and afterwards even de- spatched him, in consequence of my engagements to you,\" when, all of a sudden, King Knut's countenance changing, \"thou shalt die,\" said he, to Edric, \" and justly, since thou art guilty of treason both to God and me, by having killed thy own sovereign and my sworn brother : thy blood be upon thy head.\" And Knut ordered the traitor to be strangled then and there, in the chamber where he sat, and his body thrown out of the window into the Thames.1 Such was the end of the wretch. When we read of the Anglo- Saxon army and navy being entrusted to such as this low-born scoundrel, whose mere gift of gab enabled Edric Streone to obtain the greatest influence in the councils of the nation, and even the hand of the daughter of King Ethelred, is it any wonder that England became the spoil of the Dane ? To return to the more immediate subject of our enquiry. Perhaps it was owing to his uncle Edric Streone having had the earldom of Mercia, that Edric the Forester came to possess considerable estates in that province. This powerful western Saxon thane long disdained to submit to the Conqueror. Richard Fitz Scrobi and the Norman garrison of Hereford, had orders to invade his lands, but as often as they made an inroad on his territories they lost mail clad knights and squires. Confederating with Blethyn and Rhy wallon, the princes of North Wales and Powis, Edric then retaliated on the Normans by devastating Hereford, as far as the bridge of Lugg, carrying off great booty. At length, in 1070, even the resolute Forester made his peace with the Conqueror, whom, in 1072, he accompanied into Scotland, in that expedition in which Malcolm, king of Scots, is said to have done homage to William. It will be seen, therefore, that Edric \" Sylvaticus \" neither shared in the rebellion or forfeiture of Edwin and Morcar, the brother Earls of Mercia. Disunion amon\" their chiefs then, as it had ever been, was the bane of the Anglo- Saxons.

Yet Edric soon forsook his allegiance to \" the Bastard.\" Ralph de Mortimer was deputed by William to reduce him, and succeeded in doing so ; when, if reliance can be placed on a monastic annalist,1 the .Forester expiated his treason, as the Nor mans called it, in a dungeon. As a reward for the services he had rendered his sovereign, King' William then bestowed upon Mortimer many forfeited estates of the unfortunate Saxon, of which Eudon, the manor in question, was among the number. In the time of King Stephen or Henry II. , Eudon was held under Mortimer of Wigmore by William le Salvage, a name singularly coincident with that of the Saxon proprietor, yet it does not appear that they were in any way related. Le Savage holding also Neen and Walton under the same baron, thus these acquired the names Eudon Savage, Neen Savage, and Walton Savage.

Afterwards, this powerful baron re-assumed his manor, when, having founded Wigmore Abbey, among other gifts he granted to it the advowson of Chel marsh. Hugh, second Baron of Wigmore, dying in 1185, left four sons ; Ro^er, the eldest of whom, succeeded him in the baronv, whilst Hugh de Mortimer, one of the others, became lord of Chelmarsh and Sidbury. Hugh was killed in a tournament at Worcester, when his widow surrendered Chelmarsh to the lord of the fee, who then enfeoffed his own son Hugh in this manor. Upon his father's decease, becoming fourth Baron Mortimer of Wio-more, Huo-h transferred Chelmarsh to his brother Ralph, who ' Monasticon, vi. p. 349, No. iii. i Domesday, so. 257, a 1.

Ralph married Gladuse, daughter of Llewellyn, Prince of Wales, and by her had several sons ; Roger, the eldest of whom, succeeded him in the barony : Chelmarsh, as usual, going to a younger son. But Hugh de Mortimer, who now became lord of this manor, transmitted it to his descendants ; hence these acquired the distinctive appellation of the line of Mortimer of Chelmarsh. The male line of Mortimer of Chelmarsh expired when Hugh de Mortimer fell at the battle of Shrewsbury in 1403. Chelmarsh Church.

Sweyn, the eldest son of the great Earl Godwin, ruling over Oxford, Gloucester, and Hereford, in 1046 led the English a successful expedition into Wales. \" As he was on his way homewards,\" says the Anglo- Saxon Chronicle, \" then commanded he to be brought unto him the Abbess of Leominster ; and he had her as long as he listed ; and after that he let her go home.\" The monk of Worcester, whose testimony is not to be doubted in a matter upon which he must have had the best opportunities of being correctly informed, says, that Earl Sweyn left England and went to Denmark, \" because he was not permitted to marry Edgiva, Abbess of the Monastery of Leominster, whom he had debauched.\"1 We learn from another authority,2 that Sweyn was compelled to put away the abbess by the threats of Eadsige, Archbishop of Canterbury, and Lyfing, Bishop of Worcester ; and that, in revenge, the son of Godwin procured that the church of Worcester should be deprived of Ufere Cleobrig and many other Shropshire lands. To sum this story, and Sweyn's sad history up in a few words. He, the passionate representative of the noblest Anglo-Saxon house, violated Algiva, Abbess of Leominster, with whom he had fallen in love ; when, enraged that the laws of holy mother church forbade him to retain her as his wife, all his mother's Danish heathen blood fired up in him, and Sweyn betook himself to the piratical ways of his viking ancestors. His cousin Bruno or Beorn, also, upon some pretence having forced on ship-board, Sweyn murdered with his axe. Thus did this earl tarnish the lustre of Godwin's house. To satisfy justice for these crimes, and appease, as he vainly thought, his conscience, the outlawed Sweyn condemned himself to make a pilgrimage to Jerusalem bare-footed. 1 Florence of Worcester, p. 148.

But very shortly afterwards it passed from the fief of Lacy to that of Bernard de Newmarch, the conqueror of Brecknockshire, and from him to De Bohun, Earl of Hereford. Respecting the Saxon tenant, Uluuard, who held Cleberie under De Laci at the time of Domesday, as had been the case with his fair-haired countrymen in general, he was speedily relieved of his holding. The Norman Walter de Cropus then held this manor until 1130 ; an:l he appears to have been ancestor of that family of Le Wafre who continued to hold Cleobury North, Hopton Wafre, and other lands of the Honour of Brecknock, until Lucia le Wafre carried them to her husband Roger de Mortimer of Chirk. The Church. As a monument of his conquest of Brecknockshire, Bernard de Newmarch, with consent of King Henry I., founded Brecknock Priory, to which this Norman scourge of the Cymrians gave \" the church of Cliberia, and whatever belongeth thereto.\" : In 1291, the church of Cleobury North, in Stottesden deanery, was worth \u00a38 13s. 4d. per annum. In 1341, the parish was assessed at only \u00a32 6s. 8d., because two virgates lay untilled, the tenants having been forced to quit from poverty ; there were no sheep in it, etc. The church of Clybery North, in 1534, was valued at \u00a35 19s. 4d. per annum, less 6s. 8d. for procurations, and 6d. for synodals.

Claverley, Worfield, Nordley, and Alveley, consisting of 23,000 modern acres, in cluding the forest of Mors, in the days of Edward the Confessor, formed one continuous and magnificent estate, whose western boundary was the broad and navigable Severn. It belonged to the Mercian Earl Algar, from whose Saxon children it was reft by the Conqueror, and given to the first Norman Earl of Shrews bury. And the Norman earl gave Claverley church, doubtless his own erection, with its tithes, to Quatford collegiate church ; for the iron-clad seigneurs, who fleshed their long swords upon the field of Scnlac, were devout. The ungrateful son of the Norman earl, however, rebelled against the successor of that suzerain whose hand had enriched his father, when King Henry I. expelled the fierce De Belesme from his earldom, and his vast estates became forfeit to the Crown. Then it was, that Beauclerk retained Claverley in demesne, not granting it to any subject ; and thus, as forming part of the king's personal estates, it came into the hands of his grandson Henry II. The sheriff of Shropshire, as Fermor of the county, accounted at 1 Earl Algar died in 1059, when his sons Edwin and Morcar succeeded to his Mercian earldom. As William the Con queror's Commissioners for Staffordshire in their notes mainly allude to the period when Algar was Earl of Mercia, whilst the Domesday Commissioners for Shrop shire refer to the time when his sons, Edwin and Morcar, had succeeded him ; it is clear, that different eras of King Edward's reign are alluded to. It would seem that theConqueror'sCommissioners, when they compiled Domesday Book, consulted an anterior record or records, as well as admitted oral testimony. 2 Domesday, so. 248, a 1 ."], [138, "100 the Exchequer for the rents of those particular manors described as \"ancient demesne of the Crown,\" of which Claverley may be re garded as a type. The fiscal or reputed ferm of the county of Salop stood, in the ninth year of Henry II. , at the sum of \u00a3265 15s. ; which ferm remained technically unaltered for more than a hundred years afterwards. This \u00a3265 15s. then, was summarily, the rent or income of the king's demesnes or other prerogatives in the county, which the sheriff received. He received a good deal more, but for this amount he was obliged to account to the king. Of the \u00a3265 15s. assessed on Shropshire, \u00a315 was about the ferm of the king's manor of Claverley. Very interesting and instructive is it to observe the effect which the commotions of those unsettled times had upon the king's returns. We learn from the Pipe Roll that William Fitz-Alan, sheriff of Shropshire, expended in 1156, the year succeeding the demise of the Usurper, no less than \u00a3145 8s. 8d. \u2014 an enormous sum in those days \u2014 in re-stocking the king's manors throughout the county. He also charges \u00a317 6s. 4d. for waste of the county. The disorder consequent on Richard C\u0153ur de Leon's continued absence from his dominions, also, appears to have told upon the king's demesnes in Shropshire ; for, in the earlier years of his successor, not only was it found that the late king had been grossly cheated by his sheriffs, but that the royal manors were otherwise seriously affected. As an example, take the Shropshire manor of Worfield, which, like Claverley, was also a royal manor. The Pipe Roll of 1202 represents this manor as deficient in 6 ox teams, 600 sheep, 32 bee-stalls, 30 sows, and 24 cows, involving an annual loss of \u00a36, \u00a36, 32s., 30s., and 24s. on each item. The king's manor consequently had to be re-stocked, and the Pipe Roll which embraces the years 1208 and 1209, states that, 8 oxen necessary to make up 6 teams at Worfield had cost 4 merks, or 6s. 8d. a head ; 180 sheep necessary to make up 600 in the same manor, had cost \u00a39, or Is. each ; and similar expense was King John put to in Claverley, and throughout all his other Shropshire manors. Again, young Henry III. experienced the consequences of the barons' coalition against his father. In 1220 (4th Hen. III.) the sheriff of Shropshire claimed an allowance of \u00a3135 17s. from the Crown, in respect of a loss of \u00a345 5s. 8d. per annum, which, as fermor of the county, he had incurred during the three past years of his shrievalty : he also claimed at the same rate for three sue-"], [139, "101 ceeding years\u2014 significant witness of the extensive waste that had befallen the royal demesnes of Shropshire during the national disturbances in the time of Kins: John. Like other demesnes of the Crown, Claverley enjoyed peculiar privileges. Its tenants were free from toll and other duties throughout the realm. At home they constituted a manorial court, adequate both in matters civil and criminal for almost all purposes of self-government. In short, Claverley was e\u00e6tra- Hundredal, being a hundred as it were in itself; owing no suit to, nor having any concern in other hundredal courts ; yet, like the latter, it was controlled by the county court, and responsible to the king's justiciars in those criminal matters which came under the head of \"Pleas of the Crown.\" Whenever the king's justices visited Shropshire, the manors of ancient demesne were obliged to appear before them by their representatives or juries, who reported every graver offence which had been committed within their respective liberties since the last Iter of the justices, and how the same had been dealt with by the county court. Royal demesnes were assessable to tallages. The sheriff of the county continued to be the fermor of Claver ley, from the accession of Henry II. to the death of Henry III. Various other parties, however, participated in the revenues of this manor. In 1155, King Henry II. made a grant in fee to Robert de Girros, of Broughton a portion thereof, fiscally reputed to be worth 35s. annually, for which the sheriff claimed his exemption on the Pipe Roll, thus \u2014 \" In terris datis. Et Roberto de Girros xx\u00e6vj in Claverlai.\" Again, upon the marriage of Lewellyn with the daughter of King John, lands in this manor were assigned to Madoc, son of Griffin ; hence, the sheriff of Shropshire, in his account of the ferm of the county at Michael mas, 1207, discharges himself of a sum equivalent to \u00a35 Is. per annum to \" Madoc, son of Griffin, in Claverlei.\" But, in 1229, Henry III. granted this manor in fee-farm to John Fitz Philip, to hold for life, at an annual rental of \u00a315 payable at the Exche quer, the king reserving to himself all Tallages and aids arising from it. In 1292, the Claverley jurors reported Roger Careless and Nicholas de Warrewyk, as joint fermors of this manor, paying to the king a rent of \u00a316. About 1311, Ingelard de Warle held it, but at his decease the king reseized Claverley. The manor of Claverley comprehended numerous townships, namely, Broughton, Beobridge, Gatacre, Sutton, Aston, Farmcott,"], [140, "102 Heathton, Hopstone, Woundale, Dallicot, and Ludstone, besides the hamlets of Draycott, Gravenor, Bulwardine, and Wystanes mere ; all of which, as appears from various tenure rolls, were held of the Crown by tenants, ecclesiastical or secular. Lee Farm adjacent to Hopstone, was also a member of this manor. The family of Brooke had its origin in Claverley, where its elder branch continued to be resident for many centuries. Claverley Church. A prominent feature among the various endowments of the deanery of Bridgenorth, the succession of its rectors is involved with the list of dignitaries of that establishment. (_.(_iOTJlC((l. The particulars of this extensive manor are given in the Staffordshire Domesday, under the title of \" Terra Hugonis de Montgumeri \" ; thus : \u2014 \" Hugh de Montgumeri holds of the king Wrfeld.

When, however, Hugh succeeded to the earldom of Shrewsbury, his seigneury over Worfield became massed with his other palatine honours, and thus descending to his brother, Earl Robert de Belcsme, upon his forfeiture the whole came into the hands of Henry I. Accounted ancient demesne of the Crown, King Henry IL, and also Richard I., held Worfield strictly in demesne ; that is, these Kings kept the manor in their own hands. Its fiscal value was \u00a332 Os. 5|d.; or, nearly an eighth of the Sheriff's reputed ferm of Shropshire. In the time of King John, however, Wrenock Fitz Meuric, 1 Domesday, so. 248, b.

He lost it, when, in 1238, Henry III. assigned this manor to Ada, youngest sister and co-heir of John Scott, Earl of Huntingdon and Chester, and to her husband, Henry de Hastings, in partial satisfaction of their claims on the Honour of Chester : accordingly, this royal manor passed to subjects, who transmitted it to their descendants. Worfield Church. From the mention of a priest, it is clear that a church existed here at Domesday. It was probably founded by the great Mercian Earl Leofric. Pope Nicholas's taxation values this church at \u00a333 6s. 8d. The advowson of Worfield remained in the Crown until, in 1318, King Edward II. gave it to Walter de Langton, Bishop of Lichfield, who appropriated it to his own cathedral. In 1341, Worfield Parish was assessed at only \u00a313 6s. 8d.; because the growing corn was destroyed by storms ; there were fewer sheep in the parish than formerly ; tenants had quitted, through po vert j, and their lands lay untilled ; and because the small tithes, etc., were not reckoned to the ninth. The Valor of 1534-5 represents the receipts of Dean and Chapter of Lichfield, as parsons of this church, to amount to \u00a351 per ann. The benefice was valued at \u00a316 16s. 10d., less 2s. per ann. for synodals. Early Incumbents. \u2014 Henry, Archdeacon of Stafford, presented to this church by King John, in 1205. Being made Archbishop of Dublin, in 1213, he vacated this preferment ; when, in 1215, Walter, son of William de Cantelupe, an adherent of John's, was presented to the rectory, by the same monarch. On August 30, 1236, Walter was elected Bishop of Worcester, yet he was not consecrated until May 3, 1237 ; having only been ordained deacon on April 4, 1237, and priest fourteen days afterwards. William de Kilkenny, presented by King Henry III. Con cerning this eminent personage, Matthew of Westminster, under date 1254, observes : \" Master William of Kilkenny filled the office of Chancellor with great modesty and virtue ;\u2014 not long afterwards the same Master William was elected Bishop of Ely.\" Henry de Wengham was William de Kilkenny's successor at Worfield ; and also succeeded him as Lord Chancellor of England. In 1259, says the chronicler just quoted, \" the Lord Henry de Wengham, the Chancellor of the Lord the King, was by the unanimous consent of them all (namely the Canons of St. Paul's)"], [144, "104 elected Bishop of London ; a thorough courtier, but what is better still, a man of morality and discretion, prudence and circum spection.\" The last rector of Worfield was Sir William de Kyrkeby, 1325\u20141345. Thomas Kirkby appears as the first vicar, between 1345 and 1369, the appropriation of this church having been effected in the interval. Formerly there was a chantry, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, in Worfield Church. (-AlUClCl), under Staffordshire in Domesday, is thus noticed: \u2014 \" The same earl [Roger de Montgomery] holds Alvidelege. Earl Algar held it [in Saxon times]. Here i hide. The [arable] land is [enough] for ix ox-teams. In demesne are ii [such teams] ; and [there are] viii villains with a priest, and iiii boors, with vi teams. Here vi acres of meadow, and a wood two leagues long and half a league wide. In time of King Edward [the manor] was worth \u00a36 [per annum]. Now it is worth 100s.\" l Reputed to be a manor of ancient demesne, Alveley came intact into the hands of Henry II. , by precisely the same process as Claverley and Worfield, when Henry Plantagenet, soon after his accession, granted it to Guy le Strange. Who then was Le Strange, to whom, so shortly after regaining his grandfather's throne, young Henry gave this fine manor ? Had this feoffee rendered some important service to royalty during its late fearful struggle against the Usurper ? The only account we have of the origin of the family of Le Strange we owe to tradition. The Fitz-Warine Chronicle relates, how William Peverel had two beautiful nieces, of whom the one, named Melette, had resolved never to marry, excepting to a knight of great prowess. To give the lady a choice, her uncle caused to be proclaimed through many lands a tournament, to be held at his castle in the Peak ; at which, whoever should display the greatest dexterity, was to have his niece, with the castle of AVhittington. Among the crowd of nobles and distin guished knights, who hastened to that brilliant passage of arms, 1 Domesday, so. 248, a. 1."], [145, "105 were ten sons of the Duke of Britany, the younger of whom, being named Guy, was called Guy l'Estrange, and from him the several families of the Stranges did descend. Does the reader curiously enquire, was it he who won the lady ? Guy did not win her. To that gay gathering, \"Where throngs of knights and barons bold, Iu weeds of peace, high triumphs hold,\" speeded also Guarin de Metz, with a silver shield and peacock for crest. This knight tilted first against a son of the king of Scots, and then with a baron from Burgundy ; and, as he vanquished them both, he claimed and obtained as his prize, the willing and beautiful Melette. Seated, therefore, at Whittington, between Guarin and the Prince of Wales fierce animosities reigned. To descend from romance to sober truth. Rodland Extraneous, namely, Roland le Estrange, appears as first lay witness to a deed, which, passing in the reign of Henry I., secured to the Norfolk Priory of Castle- Acre an extensive donation. It is conjectured, that Guy, from whom, according to the legend, \"came all the great lords of England, who have the surname of Estrange,\" was a son of this Roland ; and it is probable that the Guy le Strange, to whom Henry II. granted Alveley, acquired the manor by way of recompense for services which either he or his family had rendered to the cause of legitimacy. Guy le Strange, Lord of Alveley, not only succeeded William Fitz-Alan, as sheriff of Shropshire, but had custody of his barony during the long minority of his son. In 1170, Guy a second time became sheriff of Shropshire, and in that capacity he rendered good service to Henry II. , when his sons rebelled against him. One of those who attended the great court and council, which King Henry II. , in January, 1177, held at Northampton, Guy appears at Michael mas, 1179, to have rendered his last account as sheriff of Shropshire, when Alveley became in manu Regis, until livery should be given to the heir. That heir, Ralph le Strange, a minor at the time of his father's decease, obtained livery in 1182, when the sheriff, by special order of the king, made over to him two years' revenue of Alveley. Mary le Strange, widow of Guy, and mother of Ralph, descended from knights and barons, appears as a widow in the Kino-'s gift, in 1186. She was forty years old, therefore, she could not have been more than sixteen years old when Ralph was"], [146, "106 born ; and, as Guy le Strange was her third husband, she must have been married when very young. She had her dower in various counties. Ralph le Strange, castellan at Carrechova, guarding the silver mines there that be longed to the Crown, died on that service, in the prime of his life. It was this man who founded the Hospital of the Holy Trinity, at Bridgnorth, endowing it with lands in Alveley. Like his father, he also was a liberal benefactor to Haughmond Abbey. Ralph's heirs were his three sisters : \u2014 Margaret, wife of Thomas Noel ; Joan, wife of Richard de Wapenburi ; and PILLAI AND CAPITAL, ALVELEY. Matilda, wife of Griffin de Sutton ; which husbands, in the year 1196, conjointly fined 200 merks with the king, \"for having all the land which was before Ralph le Strange's, together with the fortress which is called Cnukin.\" Thomas Noel, who married le Strange's eldest sister, appears to have been a man of high influence and trust. Sheriff of Staffordshire, Thomas, with his asso ciates, acted as Justices in Eyre for that county, in 1187. He figures also in various other capacities and public em ployments. In 1199, he proffered the large sum of 200 merks, that he might \" freely and without hindrance marry his daughters, Johanna and Alice, to whom he would.\" This offer was not accepted by King John, however. Eighteen months afterwards, Thomas Noel fined at the rate CAPITAL, ALVELEY. of 300 merks and three palfreys with the Crown, for license to marry his youngest daughter to Thomas Fitz-Eustace Stephen ;"], [147, "107 which fine being accepted, in addition, Noel promised to give the king \" a better Goshawk than Geoffrey Fitz-Piers had.\" Thomas Noel's daughters survived him, the former of whom, Alice, married William de Harcourt ; the latter, Thomas Fitz- Eustace. De Harcourt's descendants long continued to be con nected with Alveley. Fitz-Eustace's son Ralph, who adopted his mother's maiden name of Noel, in 1255, sold his quarter of a hide in Alveley to William de Hampton ; the same, or one of that family, of whose former interest in this neighbourhood, Hempton, or Hampton's Load, originally a ford over the Severn, is a reminiscence. To return to Joan, second sister and co-heir of Ralph le Strange. wife of Richard de Wapenburi. It does not appear that any portion of Alveley descended to his heir. As for Matilda, the third sister and co-heir of Ralph le Strange, surviving Griffin, her husband, she manifested a partiality for Haughmond Abbey, by granting it lands, with mill, and a third of her fishery. Madoc de Sutton, her son, succeeding her, gave his share of Alveley, with Isabel, his daughter, in frank marriage to Henry de Mors. Accordingly, in 1284, Henry de Mors was said to hold one-sixth of a knight's fee in Alveley, of the heirs of Madoc de Sutton, who held the same of the King, in capite. The most important under-tenant here, appears to have been Simon de Alvitheleg. Included in the deanery of Stottesden, the parish of Alveley, in 1341, was assessed at \u00a37 13s. to the ninth. The church has been alluded to before. \u00c6OnllCIJ-JglCrjtfi, so called, perhaps, with reference to Alveley, to the north of which it lies, Domesday mentions as follows : \u2014 \" The same earl [Roger de Montgomery] holds Nordlege. Earl Algar held it. Here ii hides. The land is for xii ox-teams. In demesne are iii teams ; and vii villains and ii boors have v teams. Here is a mill of 2s. [annual value] ; a wood I-1- leagues long, by i a league wide. In time of King Edward [the manor] was worth \u00a38 [per annum], now \u00a34.\" ' Domesday, so. 248, a. 1."], [148, "108 Like the three last manors we have described, Nordley was held by the Norman earls in demesne, and in that condition, along with them, it came into the hands of Henry I. This monarch granted a hide here in fee-farm to a tenant of the name of Fitz- Ulky or Fulky, who was to pay for the same \u00a38 10s. annually, at the exchequer ; and Fitz - Ulky's descendants, deriving a name from the vill of Astley, anciently a member of Nordley, continued for many succeeding generations to hold this land in capite, of the king. Astlej7, although originally a member of Nordley, and held by the same tenants in capite, was a tenure, not in fee-farm, but by serjeantry. The serjeantry by which it was held frequently changed. Thus we read, that, in 1211, \"John, son of Robert de Estleg, holds Estleg from ancient time, from the conquest ; and he owes of his service, one serving horseman, with a hauberk, to accompany the lord the king, when he goes on any military expedition into Wales. The costs of the said horseman were to be paid by the king.\" ' Again, in 1221, the Stottesden Jurors represented the son of the foregoing as holding this vill \"by serjeantry of the lord king, and by service that he shall be custos of the king's pavilion, when the king goes into Wales.\"2 Nordley, Astley, and Alveley possessed a manorial court in common, which had the jurisdiction usual to manors of ancient demesne.

Here is i acre of meadow, a wood two leagues long and one wide, and a mill of 2s. [annual value]. [In King Edward's time the manor] was worth \u00a36 ; now 100s. The same Outi held it freely [in Saxon times].\"1 It will be noticed how this redundantly- stocked manor, in the same Saxon hands both before and after the Conquest, became deteriorated in value after it was 'held under the Norman seigneur. Nothing further is known of Outi \u2014 the once free Saxon owner, but, after the Conquest, subservient holder of this manor, under the Norman Earl \u2014 than is related in the above extract. As neither he or any of his kin are heard of afterwards, it would seem that, like the rest of his race, he was eventually dispossessed. Upon the forfeiture of de Belesme, Quat came into the hands of Henry I., who, dividing it into three parts, as is supposed, granted half a hide, represented by the present manor of Dudmaston, to Herbert, spn of Helgot, the Domesday Lord of Stanton ; and two other hides, one of which is represented by the township of Quat Malvern, and the other by the collective townships of Quat Jarvis, Mose, and Wooton, to his younger brothers. Herbert Fitz Helgot, to whom Henry I. granted the manor of Dudmaston, succeeding his father as lord of Castle Holgate, hence forth Dudmaston became a member of that barony. The lord of Castle Holgate, by a charter still extant, enfeoffed Herlwyn de Butailles, one of his Norman retainers in this manor ; either he or his successor, transformed into Herelewin de Dudemaneston, hold ing it in 1165. \"Thus were Norman names, and the proof of Norman origin, forgotten and buried, on acquisition of English estates.\" Wydo Fitz Helgot, to whom Henry I. granted the hide of land, now identified with the township of Quat Malvern, gave this estate, Domesday, so. 239, a"], [150, "110 together with another, to the Priory of Great Malvern, as appears from the Charter of Henry I. to Malvern, dated at Winchester, in 1127. \"I give them\" [the monks], says the king, \" two hides of land, which Wydo Fitz Holgod surrendered into my hand, whereof one is in Worcestershire, and the other in Staffordshire, by name Quat, \u2014 quit [of all gelds and assessments], and to hold of me and my successors in capite.\" ' It is necessary to explain, that, when a tenant wished to make any transfer of property, the formal mode of doing so at that period was, to surrender it to his suzerain, when the suzerain re-granted it according to the tenant's wish. In 1534-5, the income receivable by the Priory from Great Malvern was \u00a33 Os. 9d. The hide of the Domesday Quat, now represented by the collec tive townships of Quat Jarvis, Wooton, and Mose, Henry I. gave, as we said, to a third son of Helgot, Lord of Castle Holgate, to be held by serjeantry ; namely, to provide one knight to do service for xl days at the royal castle of Shrawardine. Castle guard else where, however, afterwards came to be substituted for this service. Thus, in 1255, \" John Fitz Philip,\" a descendant of the first grantee, it was said, \" holds in Quat and Mose one hide of land, by service of providing two men at his own cost [to go] with the king into Wales, in time of war, for 40 days, one with a bow and arrows, the other with a lance. And he [John] does suit to the Hundred of Brug.\" Quat Church. The first notice we have of this church is in 1255, when, valued at 10 merks per annum, it was in the gift of the Prior of Malvern. Pope Nicholas's taxation gives the same valuation in 1291. The Staffordshire Inquisition for the ninth, a mere fragment, scarcely alludes to this parish. In 1534, the preferment of the parson of Quat was valued at \u00a315 18s. 6d., whereof a pension of 20s. was payable to the Prior of Malvern, 2s. triennially to the Bishop of Chester, and 11s. 8d., for procurations, to the Archdeacon of Stafford.

[The manor formerly] was worth 30s. [per annum] ; now 40s. Achi held it freely [in King Edward's time].\" ' The Saxons, who loved agriculture and husbandry, were wont' to attach to localities names savouring of farming ideas. Thus, the manor in question derives its title from the Saxon Rammer-lea;^ the district of the Ram. But little is known concerning Walter, the Norman earl's tenant here. Suffice it to observe, that his position was afterwards occu pied by the barons of Richard's castle, when the manor of Romsley became attached to the fief which these barons held in capite of the Crown. Remains of Romsley chapel, and of the encaustic tiling of its floor, are still visible. Two stones from its old doorway, carved with zodiacal signs, Leo and Sagittarius, once perhaps belonging to a set of twelve such, are also to be seen, built into the wall of an adjacent stable. at the time of William the Conqueror's survey, was another of Earl Roger's manors in Stanlei Hundred, Warwickshire. Domesday thus notices it : \u2014 \" Radulphus holds of the Earl v hides in Rigge. The land is for vii ox-teams. In demesne is one team, wish i serf, and iii villains and iv boors with ii teams. [Formerly] it was worth 60s. [per annum] ; now 40s. Edric [once] held it freely of Earl Leuric.\"2 Domesday says Edric held this manor of Earl Leuric or Leofric, the Saxon Earl of Mercia, who died August 31st, 1057. It is clear, therefore, that in this Warwickshire portion of the Survey, the accounts given of a previous state of things, refer to the period when Leofric was living. Leofric was succeeded in his Mercian earldom by his son, Algar, who figures as earl in the Staffordshire portion of Domesday. Leofric was grandfather of Edwin and Morcar 1 Domesday, so. 239, a 2. 2 Ibidem."], [152, "112 represented as earls of Mercia in the Shropshire Domesday. In their allusions to the bygone Saxon era, the Conqueror's Commis sioners evidently, therefore, refer to various periods of the reign of Edward the Confessor. Edric, alluded to above, was Sylvaticus, the Forester, of whom and in what way his estates, of which Rudge was one, came afterwards to be possessed by the Norman Radulphus or Ralph de Mortimer, we have spoken. The Mortimers of Wigmore long continued to hold their seig neury over Rudge. J^ltiplClJ* The word is another reminiscence of Saxon farm ing, being originally SceJ'er-leaj, the district of the sheep. It is thus described in the Warwickshire Domesday : \u2014 \" The same Radulphus holds of the earl [Roger de Montgomery] i hide in Sciplei. The land is [enough] for iii ox-teams. Here are ii villains, and there is one quarentine \u25a0 of oaks in length and in breadth. [The manor] is worth 5s. [annually]. Alsi held it freely in the time of King Edward. \" 2 Lands in Remesleage, Sciplea, and Suthtune, identical probably with the Shropshire Romsley, Shipley, and Sutton by Claverley, were included by Wulfric Spott, the Saxon, in his magnificent endowment of Burton Abbey, at the commencement of the 11th century ; yet, excepting the mention in his will, not a trace can be discovered of this remote Shropshire interest of Burton Abbey. Concerning Alsi, the unlucky Saxon wight displaced by the Norman Radulphus de Mortimer, nothing further is heard. Stretching away for miles eastward and westward of the valley of the Severn, in ancient times, flourished a forest. It occupied all that district where now the counties of Shropshire, Stafford shire, and Worcestershire converge \u2014 a densely wooded pathless tract, where roamed at will those four-footed denizens of the \u00b0-rcen cover which own not the dominion of man. Here, ever since vegetable life first budded, had it run riot in the excess of luxu riancy. It was a primeval forest ; sublime in the grey and solemn twilight of its hoary antiquity. The quarentine was equivalent to the furlong, or 40 percli.es. - Domesday, so. 239, a 2."], [153, "113 Through this leafy region, known to our early British ancestors as Coed the forest, struggled against the various hindrances opposed to its onward course, the sluggish Severn. One while, some huge tree, levelled by lightning or the wind, blocked up the passage of its waters ; which, then deserting their wonted channel, would transgress into neighbouring hollows, and there stagnate into reedy and niephitic pools. At another time, swollen with wintry rains, the angry torrent impetuously burst its bonds and flooded the surrounding country, carrying all before it. The extent of the wild uncultivated tract in question may be inferred from the relative positions of Mors, Kinver, and Wyre forests, so often alluded to in the Anglo-Norman period ; all of which were included in the ancient Coed. But civilization gradually obtained the ascendancy over nature ; large patches of the parent forest were reclaimed, and these, ever widening, at length, smiling and cultivated distances intervened between Mors, Kinver, and Wyre. It is with the former of these Boses or woods that we have now more particularly to deal. More Forest lay to the east of the Severn. Not only have traces of our early British ancestors, in the shape of tumuli, been found within the precincts of Mors forest, but reminiscences of each successive race that obtained the ascendancy in this island have also been discovered there. Thus Chesterton, formerly within its regard, implies a Roman encampment ; and the Saxon Cl\u00e6pep-leaj, or Claverley, the clover district, bespeak the fostering supervision of the agriculture-loving Saxon earls of Mercia. Again, the Danes, when out-generalled by Alfred, sought refuge in Mors forest, and, entrenching themselves there one winter, endeavoured by the aid of the timber it yielded, to construct a fleet that would float them, down the Severn, that so the Viking rovers might regain their element, the main, from which the Anglo- Saxon king had cut them off. Starved out of the forest, the gristy worshippers of Odin made their dread forage westward over the Severn, when Danes-ford recalls to memory the pagan host. Finally, Quat Castle frowning over the surrounding neighbour hood, marked the epoch of Norman supremacy. Yes ! Briton, Saxon, Dane, and Norman, each left their impress on this wood : they had their day, and passed away ; and now we, the men of the 19 th century, erect our schools and run our rail roads through the valley, where haunted of yore the antlered monarch of Mors. i"], [154, "114 Domesday Hundred of Recordin.

Their interest here, however, was temporary, for in the year 1200, Hamo le Strange, younger brother of John le Strange II. , of Ness and Cheswardine, fined 60 merks with the Crown, that he, \" Hamo, might have the Manor of Wrocwrthin, late held by Meuric de Powis.\" Hamo le Strange accordingly became Lord of Wrockwardine, with its members \u2014 Admaston, Allscot, Leaton, Burcote, Nesse, Clotley, and Walcott ; and his descendants continued to hold the manor in capite of the king. The Nomina Villarum of 1316 duty enters Fulco Extraneus as Lord of Wrockwardine. The le Stranges claimed to exercise Free-warren ; Free-court, with its pleas of bloodshed, hue and cry, and gallows ; and the Assize of Bread and Beer, in their Manor of Wrockwardine. The Church. Wrockwardine Church was a Saxon foundation, the mother church of a district. \" The Church of St. Peter,\" says Domesday, \" holds the church of this manor with one hide.\" The Norman earl, it appears, had given the church, and Oilerius the priest, the hide to Shrewsbury Abbey. In 1291, the church of Wrocwor thin, in the deanery of Salop, was valued at \u00a310 per ann. In 1341, the parish was rated only \u00a36 13s. 4d. to the ninth, because there were few sheep in it, etc. A patent of King Ed. III., dated July 26, 1329, gave the Abbot of Shrewsbury license to appro priate this church.

Early Incumbent. \u2014 Oilerius, the priest who, according to Earl Roger's Charter, gave one hide of land in Cherlton, a member of Wrockwardine, to Shrewsbury Abbey, is supposed to have been Rector of Wrockwardine in 1086. This Oilerius, or \" Odelirius, of Orleans, son of Constantius, a man of talent and eloquence, as well as of great learning,\" was one of the Norman earl's chief counsellors. He was father of Ordericus Vitalis, the celebrated Norman chronicler. Ji.UJU (Sn[a.l.

High Ercall is thus described in the Domesday Book :\u2014 \" The Earl himself holds Archelou. Earl Eduin held it, with v Bere wicks. Here vii hides. In demesne are vi ox-teams and xii neat herds.

In later times, Ercall was the caput of those vast estates which formed the heritage of the Newports \u2014 a heritage than which none greater has accrued to any single Shropshire family since the advent of the Normans.\"4 High Ercall came into the hands of Henry I. upon the forfeiture of Earl Robert, when the king invested Hamo Peverel in this manor, which descended to his collateral heirs. The de Hadleys, otherwise the de Ercalls, descending from William de Hadley I., and Seburga, natural daughter of Hamo Peverel, continued, for two hundred years, to be the vassals of the mesne lords of High Ercall.

From Wrockwardine and Wellington the great Norman could view the Wrekin tower in solitary gran deur upwards into the sky. Hard by Earl Roger's manors ran the Watling Street, to remind him of a former conqueror. Like the rest of the Norman earl's manors, Wellington became forfeit to the king by the rebellion of Robert de Belesme, when at length it appears that King John gave Wellington to Thomas de Erdinton, in reward for the services rendered by the latter in the Court of Rome at the time of the Interdict.2 The jurors who made this statement in 1284 added, that in King John's time there were only 14 hearths in Wellington, and 24 hearths in Arleston. Changes have since taken place in respect to Wellington, which is now a populous and thriving town. Wellington Church. As we glean from the Domesday report of the manor, this church was existent in 1086. From Roger de Montgomery's charter to Shrewsbury Abbey we learn, that soon afterwards, the Norman earl gave it to his newly-founded abbey.

Apley, now Apley Castle, Arleston, Aston under the Wrekin, Dothill, and Walcot, were all appurtenances of the manor of Wellington. Around the Wrekin, in ancient times, stretched the Forest of the Wrekin, or Forest of Mount Gilbert, as it was afterwards called. Gradually this forest was encroached upon, until, in the year 1300, the Haye of Welinton was all that remained to the lord king. . That forester whose hereditary office it was to take charge of Wellington Haye, the locality of which is still indicated by Hay-gate, there is little doubt was ancestor of the present Lord Forrester, who now holds the very land which his ancestor held 700 j'ears ago. That, in days gone by, a hermit dwelt amidst the solitudes of the Wrekin, is proved by the fact, that King Henry III., by his patent of September 17, 1267, granted to \" Nicolas de Denton, Heremite of Mount Gilbert, six quarters of corn ; to be paid him by the sheriff of Shropshire, out of the issues of Pendleston Mill,\" in order, as it was expressed, \" to give the Hermit greater leisure for holy exercises, and to support him during his life, so long as he shall be a Heremite on the aforesaid mountain.\" (rtUiniOnU is noticed in Domesday, thus :\u2014 \" The Earl him self holds Edmendune.

Successive sheriffs continued to farm its revenues until the year 1227, when King Henry III., by his charter, dated at Westminster, granted the Manor of Eg mundon-cum- Novo TBurgo to Henry de Audley and his heirs, to hold of the Crown, by the service of one sore sparrow-hawk, payable yearly at the Exchequer.2 And the Pipe Roll, of the same year informs us, that \" Henry de xlldithele accounts one mewed sparrow-hawk for the ferm of Egmendon-cum-Novo Burgo, according as the king had given the manor to him at such a ferm. The hawk had been paid to the king himself; and Audley was quit.\" The barons Audlev, of whom a notice is- given under Ford, thus became lords of Edgmond and Newport. The Bradford Tenure-Roll of 1285, says, that, \" Nicholas de Audeley holds the manor of Egemond, with its members, viz : \u2014 Adeney, Great Aston, Little Aston, Little Halis, Pickestoke, with the vill of Neuporte, of the king in capite by charter ; rendering yearly a mewed sparrow-hawk, in lieu of all services. The said manor was a demesne-manor of the king. Of the said members, William Eyssely holds Great Aston of the said Nicholas ; the Abbot of Crokesden holds Adeney ; John de Halis holds Little Halis ; and the Burgesses of Neuport hold Neuport as a free borough, of the said Nicholas. And here the said Nicholas has his free court, and pleas of bloodshed, and hue-and-cry, and gallows, warren, market, and fair ; and these he has used.\" The Church. Edgmond Church, founded apparently by Earl Roger de Mont gomery, was, with its subject chapels, by him given to Shrewsbury Abbey.

Founded within the royal manor of Edgmond, Novus Burgus, or Newport, belonged to that class of boroughs which had kings for their founders. Newport appears to have been founded by the Anglo-Norman king, Henry I., in whose time the burgesses of Newport enjoyed franchises and had customs. King Henry II. by his charter, dated at Brewood, between the years 1163 and 1166 confirms to the Burgesses of Novo Bur go all those liberties and rights which they had in the time of King Henry his grandfather. At the assizes of 1203, the new borough was represented by its own community. It was alleged against them that the assize of Bread was not kept in their town. The earliest instance which occurs of the name Neuport being substituted for New Borough is in 1221, when Matilda de Stafford was named at the assizes as complainant against Nicholas de Neuport and others. On January 23, 1287, King Edward I. at Shrewsbury, inspected and confirmed Henry the Second's charter to the burgesses of of Novus Burgus. At the assizes of 1292, the \"Vill of Neuport\" was represented by William Noblet, its chief bailiff, William Rondulf, Richard Alemond, Robert de Morton, Richard de la Loue, John Rondulf, and Roger Priest, jurors. Under the head, De Libertibus, it was presented at these assizes, that the burgesses of Novus Burgus claimed to have a court, to assize bread and beer, and to have a merchant-guild. Appearing, the burgesses explained that they had exercised these franchises from time immemorial. They adduced Henry the Second's charter, and said that both before and after that charter, they had exercised these franchises. Involved with that of Edgmond, and subject to the same lords, the early history of Newport is meagre and unsatisfactory.

On March 29, 1442, King Henry VI. empowered the Abbot of Salop to alienate Newport Church, with its tithes and oblations, and the tithes of Littel and Muchel Astone, to Thomas Draper and his heirs, so that the said Thomas might found a college in the said church, to the praise of God and the Virgin Mary, and also a chantry of two chaplains, who were to perform Divine service in a chapel of the said church daily. The College was to consist of a Warden, in priest's orders, and four Chaplains or Fellows, who were to pray for the king and royal family, for the soul of Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, and for the brethren and sisters of the fraternity of St. Mary's Guild, in the said church of Newport, as the said Thomas Draper should order. The Fellows were to elect their Warden, and present him to the Abbot of Salop.

When William the Conqueror's Com missioners surveyed Shropshire, they found that the largest holder in Recordin Hundred, under the Norman Earl of Shrews bury, was Rainald, successor to Guarin the sheriff. This Guarin, or Warin the Bald, who had been selected by Earl Roger from among his barons to fill the responsible office of vicomte, or sheriff of Shropshire, was, as Ordericus tells us, \" a man of small stature but great courage, who bravely encountered the earl's enemies, and maintained tranquillity throughout the district entrusted to his government.\" With the shrievalty, which, in Norman times, was a hereditary office, the earl conferred upon Warin the hand of Amieria or Emerie, his niece, and attaching no less than seventy different manors in Shropshire, besides several in other counties, to the sheriff's fief, Earl Roger's prime minister, Warin the Bald, stood the second man in the county of Shropshire. Leaving a son named Hugh, a minor, Warin died before Domesday was compiled, when Rainald, who held the fief of Bailleul, in Normandy, under Earl Roger de Montgomery, marrying the widow of Warin, became second Norman sheriff of Shropshire, and lord over those eleven manors in Recordin Hundred, of which Upton Magna was the most important. This place is thus noticed in Domesday Book: \u2014 \"The same Rainald holds Uptune. Seuuard held it in King Edward's time. Here v hides geldable. In demesne are iii ox-teams, and vii serfs, xxv villains, and one free man with xii ox-teams ; and there might be viii more teams here besides. Here is a mill of 16s.

In King Edward's time the manor was worth \u00a310 [per annuin\\ ; now \u00a37.\" ' Little is known concerning Rainald, the Domesday lord of Upton Magna. He continued sheriff of Shropshire during both Earl Hugh's and Earl Robert's times, and from the circumstance that he was confidentially employed by Henry I. in the affairs of the Border at the close of the year 1102, we judge that he escaped the ruin which befell the latter. Immediately afterwards, however, Rainald's connection with Shropshire ceased. Hugh, son of Warin, being old enough as it seems to succeed to his paternal inheritance, now stept into his fief, whilst the king, causing the shrievalty to 1 Domesday, so 2,14, b 2."], [169, "125 merge into the vice-royalty of Richard de Belmeis, Rainald re turned to Normandy. We next hear of Rainald de Bailleul taking part in that Norman expedition which the Comte de Perche brilliantly led against the Moors of Spain. Finally, we have Rainald's loyalty suspected by Henry I. in 1119, when the baron haughtily refusing to surrender Le Chateau Renouard, the king destroyed his stronghold. Meanwhile, Hugh, son of Warin, having deceased without issue, Alan Fitz-Flaald received by grant of Henry I. the honour of the sheriff of Shropshire. It is a question who the new lord of Upton Magna was ; but that Alan Fitz-Flaald was progenitor not only of the great house of Fitz-Alan, but also of the royal line of Stuart, the representative of which now sits upon the throne of England, is beyond a doubt. We do not intend to weary our reader with an intricate gene alogical investigation ; let it suffice to note, that, when Macbeth, King of Scotland, sought about the year 1050, to secure the succession in his own line, by putting to death, and confiscating the estates of those whom he suspected of plotting the restoration of Malcolm Canmore, the eldest son of Duncan ; amongst those who fled from his reach was Fleance, son of Banquo, the murdered Thane of Lochaber. He fled to the Prince of North Wales, Gruffyth ap Lewellyn, with whose daughter, Guenta, becoming enamoured, the Welsh princess bore to Fleance a son \u2014 Alan Fitz- Flaald \u2014 the party in question. At least, such is the opinion of Eyton, who has examined the question with much learning and critical sagacity. The change from Fleanchus to Flaadus is certainly not very great, especially when we bear in mind that the nomenclature of that period was far from fixed. According to this, then, Alan Fitz-Flaald was grandson of Gruffyth ap Lewellyn, Prince of North Wales. Now, as Gruffyth married Alditha, daughter of Algar, Earl of Mercia, by whom he had Guenta, it follows that Alan Fitz-Flaald, legitimate or illegitimate, was the greatgrandson of the Saxon Earl of Mercia. Henry I., who, be it remembered, married a Scoto-Saxon princess, therefore, in giving Alan Fitz-Flaald the specific fief of the sheriff of Shrop shire, may be supposed to have been actuated by a variety of motives. In the first place, he was planting in the very van of border warfare a chieftain who sprang from the native princes of North Wales. Secondly, descending as Alan Fitz-Flaald did from the Saxon Mercian Earl, Henry I., it may be presumed, acted in"], [170, "126 accordance with his well-known policy of conciliating the English. Again, he who now became lord of Upton Magna, represented a house illustrious in that land of Scots from whence Henry I. had married his queen. Alan Fitz-Flaald married Avelina de Hesding, by whom he had issue three sons, William, Walter, Jordan, and a daughter named Sibil. It was Walter Fitz-Alan, Alan Fitz-Flaald's second son, who was the undoubted ancestor of the royal house of Stuart. A partizan of the daughter of that king who had enriched his family, Walter, during the stormy period of Stephen's usurpation, sought a shelter at the Court of David, King of Scots, the empress' uncle, where he became steward or seneschal to the King of Scots. The charter is yet in existence that proves how William Fitz-Alan, seneschal of the King of Scotland benefitted the monks of Melrose abbey. Its seal presents on one side the figure of an \"armed knight on horseback, at full speed ; a lance with pennon, couched in his right hand, and a shield on his left arm : \" the legend is \u2014 Sigillum Walteri Jilii Alani Dapiferi Rey.1 It was Alexander, the great-grandson of this Walter, who, abandoning his patronymic, in allusion to his hereditary office styled himself sinrply Alexander Stuart. Alan Fitz-Flaald dying about 1114, was succeeded in his Shrop shire fief by his eldest son, William Fitz-Alan, who, in early manhood, founded Haugh mond Abbey. This illustrious character married a niece of Robert, Earl of Gloucester, and joining heart and soul the league against the Usurper, defended Shrewsbury castle against Stephen. But the active king took Fitz- Alan's stronghold by assault, and cruelly and ignominiously hanged no less than ninety-three of his knightly captives.2 \" In no way inferior to the great earls who supported her cause, neither in fidelity, merit, valour, nor high repute,\" William Fitz-Alan outlived King Stephen's stormy reign, when, Henry II. having succeeded to his grandfather's throne reinstated Fitz-Alan in his estates, and conferred on him the sheriffdom of Shropshire. Now, too, it was that the king conferred upon Fitz- Alan in second marriage Isabel de Say, Baroness of Clun, the wealthiest heiress in Shropshire. Fitz-Alan enjoyed his restored estates but five years, and dying in 1160, he received sepulture in Shrewsbury abbey, as he had given land in Iseham together with his body, to that house. ' Laing's Scottish Seals. s See page 1 73."], [171, "127 Fitz-Alan's son and heir by Isabel de Say was very young at the time of his father's decease. During his long minority, Guy le Strange, Geoffrey de Vere, and afterwards Hugh Pantulf, suc cessively acted as sheriffs of Shropshire, the former being appointed also custos of the Fitz-Alan estates. In 1175, however, William Fitz-Alan II, had livery of his Shropshire baronry ; and about the same time he married the infant daughter of Hugh de Lacy, of Ludlow and Ewyas. More frequently associated with monastic charters than with political life, this Shropshire sheriff and baron-marcher died in 1210, and was buried at Haughmond Abbey, to which he had been a benefactor. A minor at the period of his father's decease, at length, on March 3rd, 1215, King John received at the Tower of London the homage of William Fitz-Alan III., when the king, addressing letters patent to all the knights and tenants of the young baron, ordered them to do homage and fealty to their lord. Yet scarcely had the young noble arrived at his honours ere he was cut off. John Fitz-Alan, William's brother, who next became lord of Oswestry and Fitz-Alan's fief, immediately upon his brother's death rebelled against King John, and confederating with the barons, the furious king burned his town, if not his castle, of Oswestry, to the ground. King John's career now closed ; yet not immediately did the indignant rebel give in his adherence to young Henry III., but, in October, 1217, becoming reconciled, the king empowered him to collect the scutage of his tenants in War wickshire, Wiltshire, Norfolk, Suffolk, Oxfordshire, and Shrop shire. To this baron succeeded his son, John Fitz-Alan II., in 1243, who fined \u00a31,000 for livery and seizin of his father's lands and castles. In right of his mother Isabel, sister of Earl Hugh de Albini, John Fitz-Alan acquired Arundel castle and the Honour of Petworth, Sussex. Fighting: on the side of the king at the disastrous battle of Lewes, this so-called Earl of Arundel was taken prisoner by the victorious barons. Towards the close of the year 1267, the greatest of the lords-marchers was laid with his ancestors in that abbey of Haughmond they had founded, when John Fitz-Alan III, son and heir of John Fitz-Alan II. and Matilda de Verdon, became lord of Upton Magna. The enormous privileges which the lords of the marches occasionally asserted, were strikingly exemplified in the conduct of this man. In defiance of the king's oft-repeated mandate to pay \u00a3200 to his father's"], [172, "128 widow, the Shropshire noble still delayed ; asserting, in contempt of the king-, that, \" in the Parts of the March where he now resided he was obliged to do nothing at the king's mandate, and that nothing would he do :\" at which the king is said to have been \"surprised and greatly moved.\" The proud noble, however, passed away in the prime of his life, leaving an infant son by Isabel de Mortimer. Richard Fitz-Alan, Earl of Arundel, the heir in question, is described in the Feodary of 1284, as holding many manors in capite, and amongst the number that of Upton cum Membris. He married an Italian lady, by whom he had Edmund Fitz-Alan, who again marrying Alice Plantagenet, his descendants became entitled to the earldom of Warren and Surrey. The career of Edmund Fitz-Alan was cut short by the executioner.1 Upton Magna Church.

We may infer that this was existent in 1086, from the mention of a priest in the Domesday account of the manor. In 1282, Richard de Leighton conveyed the advowson of Leighton to Robert Bur nell, Bishop of Bath and Wells, who, within two years after, gave it to Buildwas abbey. Pope Nicholas' Taxation in 1291, represented the church of Lehton, in the archdeaconry and deanery of Salop, as worth \u00a34 per annum.

The return upon the death of Saer Mauveysin in 1283, states, that the deceased had held one carucate in Berewyk, under Richard Fitz-Alan, for a whole knight's fee ; and, by service of castle- guard at Oswestry, with one horseman, not heavily armed, for forty days in time of war.2 WH XSfUitX. A little to the west of the remarkable Shrop shire mountain, the Wrekin, which, rearing froni a vast plain its solitary crest upwards to an altitude of 1,370 feet is visible from various points of a radius of seventy miles round it, the Roman conquerors built the city of Uriconium, or Wroxeter. The Celtic Bre or Wre, Wrc, signifies a hill, high or rotund. The Romans Latinized Wre into Uri ; for it is most likely that this station of theirs took its name from the very conspicuous natural land-mark near it. The terminative conium seems to be a Latinized edition of the Celtic cond, signifying an embouchure, which also exactly agrees with the situation of Uriconium, or Wroxeter. The contemplation of the remains of this Roman city is fraught with interest to every student of the ancient history of his country ; it is to be regretted, however, that we are in possession of so little information respecting its history. Planted on the north or north east side of the Severn, near where the streamlet called Bell Brook empties itself into that river, from vestiges of its circumference that can be traced, the Uriconium of Roman times appears to have been a very large and fortified town, encircled by a vallum and fosse. Its walls were about three miles in circuit.3 Hartshorne4 estimates the vallum to have been fifteen feet in height, and the fosse the same in width. A piece of the \" Old Wall \" that 1 Domesday, so. 254, b 2. 3 The walls of Pompeii are less than two 2 Inquisitions, 12 MEdw. I.

Standing in a field to his left, this huge fragment, seventy-two feet long by twenty high, presents to the eye of the lover of antiquities a genuine sample of Roman construction, being faced with small quarried stones six inches by four, with bondings of Roman tile after a certain num ber of courses. The interior of the wall, which is three feet two inches thick, is filled up with rubbish and pebbles. Uriconium \u2014 Oviponovtov is mentioned by Ptolemy,1 from whom we learn that it was situated in the country of the Cornavii whose chief city probably it was. It is alluded to also in the second and twelfth Iter of Antoninus, and by Richard of Cirencester in his first, second, and thirteenth Iter. Direct lines of roads connected the Roman city with Watling Street and those other great cause ways with which the Latin conquerors networked Britain. Various antiquities of the Roman period have been found here. In 1701, a hypocaust, or sweating bath, was uncovered, \"walled about and floored, under and over,\" with flues and all complete. Mr. Dukes, in his manuscript,2 gives a drawing of a tesselated floor found at Wroxeter in 1734 ; the form is oblong and semi-circular at one extremity ; it is composed of green, red, white, and blue tessera., the green forming the outside border. In 1747, a paper was read before the Royal Society relative to a quantity of clay moulds for forging- Roman coins which were found at Wroxeter. \u00a9 \u00a9 They had on them the head of Julia, the wife of Severus, and the inscription Jvlia Avgvsta. In 1752, three sepulchral stones, having Latin inscriptions on them, were found in a field about two hundred yards north-east of the old wall.3 The inscription od one of these ran as follows :-^MPETRONIVSLFMENVIC- ANN \u25a0 XXXVIII \u2022 MIL \u25a0 LEG \u2022 XIIII \u2022 GEM \u25a0 MILITAVIT ANN \u25a0 XVIII-SIGN-FVIT-H-S-E- \" Marcus Petronius, son of Lucius, of the tribe Menenia, lived thirty-eight years.

These consisted of coins, both of the Upper and Lower Empire, fragments of earthen vessels of various sizes and shapes, pieces of glass, a piece of leaden pipe, not soldered but hammered together, and the seam or juncture secured by a kind of mortar, tesselated floors of rooms, baths, and hypocausts. In one of the latter pieces of painted stucco, were found some striped crimson on a yellow ground, others intersecting chequer work of one colour, red or blue. The following notice of a discovery made February Sth, 1798, is preserved in Mr. Parkes' manuscripts in the British Museum.2 \" Between Tern Bridge and the Severn, at Attingham, in a ploughed field, at a little more than plough depth, an enclosure of large stones was come upon, within which were ranged three large glass urns of very elegant workmanship, one large earthen urn, and two small ones of fine red earth. Each of the urns had one handle, and the handles of the glass urns were elegantly ribbed. The glass urns were 12 inches high, by 10 inches in diameter. The large earthen urn was so much broken that its size could not be ascertained. On the handle were the letters spah. The small urns were about 9 inches high. Within the glass urns were burnt bones and fine mould, and in each a fine glass lachrymatory ; these had a most beautiful hght green tint. Near one of them was part of a jaw-bone, an earthen lamp, and a few Roman coins of the Lower Empire, of little value. The whole was covered with large flat stones, covered with a quantity of coarse rock-stone.\" As noticed in the manuscript, this was probably the burial-place of some family of Uriconium. These remains lay probably by the side of the Roman road, which is conjectured to have communicated with Deva or Chester, as we have sepulchral remains marking the line of the other two well-ascertained roads which led through Uri conium. A very curious relic was found at Wroxeter whilst ploughing near the \" Old Wall \" in 1808, namely, a small stamp, such as were used by Roman empirics and ocularii. It is formed of fine grained green schist ; on it is an inscription which, rendered into English, is believed by Professor Simpson, of Edinburgh, to 1 Arch\u00e6ological Journal, 1859, p. 63. a Add.

The discovery is recorded of a singular altar upon which is inscribed BONO REI PVBLIC\u00c6 NATVS. It is sup posed to be of the time of Constantine.1 In 1827 a bronze statuette of Apollo holding the lyre was found. A bronze figure of Diana, and one of Mercury were discovered in 1848. Considerable explorations have been made of late on the site of this ancient Roman city. Fragments of columns which appear to have, been disposed in rows ; baths, and Basilica, Temple or Hall of Justice ; and a space considered to be the Forum, have been dis covered. The inner sides of the walls of some of the buildings were covered with a thick layer of mortar, painted in fresco, the colours of which still preserved their freshness. Roofing tiles also were found. Various streets of the ancient Roman city have been carefully examined, and the roadway is found to be composed of small stones from the bed of the river Severn ; on either side is a causeway for foot-passengers, terminated by a kerb-stone ; the width of the road, including the foot-ways, being 18 feet. A water-course of wrought stone, very well made, little more than a foot deep, and a foot wide, has been opened, which runs in front of the ruins of some houses. The stones found in this water-course, and which in places block it up, are supposed ta have been step ping-stones ; fallen during the demolition of the adjoining build ings, or before the city was wholly deserted. The site of the ancient burial-ground was, as is invariably the case in Roman cities, without the gates; and, from discoveries of numerous urns, lachrymatories, and other sepulchral vessels, in earth and glass, it would appear that the ancient cemetery of the city of Uriconium at Wroxeter, lay without the Roman city, on its eastern side, extending along the sides of the Watling Street.

The remains of what is supposed to have been a chariot- wheel, have been found, also spear-heads, the head of a pick or adze, as well as other implements of iron, clamps, rivets, and nails. Lead and tin also have been discovered in the recent excavations. A painter's palette was turned up ; also inta glios or engraved stones, bronze and bone hair-pins, combs, fibulae, bracelets, finger-rings, glass beads, and bone needles. These, with other interesting discoveries, full details of which have been duly recorded in the journals of those learned societies whose special province it is to extend our knowledge of antiquities, have resulted in a very considerable insight into the condition of the inhabitants of Roman Britain.1 Uriconium or Wroxeter owed its foundation, it is conjectured, to the campaigns of Ostorius, about a.d. 50. In the absence of any certain information, it is impossible to determine whether it was ruined by accidental fire, by the inroads of the Picts and Scots before the arrival of the Saxons, by some irruption from the Britons of \\North AVales, or, lastly, as some suppose, the Danes at length burnt Wroxeter. From the recent explorations, it is cer tain that it was burnt to the ground, whoever fired it. Among the most remarkable of the discoveries lately made at Wroxeter, was the finding of a number of skeletons and human bones. The position in which they were found was very peculiar. In one of the smaller hypocausts were three skeletons, one of which was seated or crouching in a corner, the other two were lying extended by the side of the wall. It appeared from the skull and jaw of the former that these were the remains of a very old man ; the others seemed to be females. At a short distance from the old man lay, in a small heap, 132 copper coins, extending from Claudius to Valens, or from about a.d. 52 to 379. With 1 The reader will find a good deal re lating to Wroxeter in Hartshorne's Sa lopia Antiqua, pp. 90, 91, 117 \u2014 133 ; in Wright's 'Guide to the Ruins of the Roman City of Uriconium'; in the Journal of the British Arch\u00e6ological Association, vols. xv., xvi , xvii., and xix.; in the March and September numbers 1859, and September number 1860, ofthe Arch\u00e6ological Jour nal; in the Arch\u00e6ologia Cambrensis; and in the Gentleman's Magazine. In the Museum of the Shropshire Natural His tory and Antiquarian Society, as well as in the Library of King Edward's Free Grammar School at Shrewsbury, various relics from Uriconium are deposited."], [185, "137 these were found small iron nails and deeayed wood \u2014 the remains of the box in wliich the= coins had been enclosed. It seemed as if, in the suddenness of their surprise, and the fierceness of the conflict in which the city was destroyed, the persons of whom these were the skele'tons, had sought safety by hiding themselves in the hypocaust, and had there met their fate. Besides the skeletons in the hypocaust, numerous skulls, many of which were distorted in form, were found near the fortifications which secured the passage across the Severn, as if there had been a conflict just at this point. Now the discovery of the coins with the old skeleton in the hypocaust has a two-fold significance. In the first place, it shows what was the current money at the time in Britain ; secondly, and more important still, it presents us, it may be, with a clue to the date of the destruction of Uriconium ; for it was in the year 382, just three years after the date of the latest coin discovered, that Maximus, assuming the imperial purple, withdrew the garrisons from the cities of Roman Britain, and left the enervated conquered population of this country at the mercy of their more hardy high land brethren. It is a historical fact, that in the year a.d. 396 the Britons sent ambassadors to Rome for succour against the Picts and Scots. The Saxons called this place Wreaken- Ceaster. From its being mentioned, at the close of the seventh century, in the Chorography of Ravennas, as the chief city of the Cornavii, Baxter supposes that Uriconium flourished till the time of the Danes, and that perhaps even here, at one period, the Mercians fixed their capital. The kingdom of Mercia, the March or boundary bordering on the lands of the British tribes, foimded by Cridda, a.d. 585, embraced Shropshire and the midland counties. But when Domesday Book was written, eight hundred years ago, the famous Roman city of Uriconium had long been numbered with the dead. The varied evidences which it supplies of the pro gress of art and civilization in this distant province of the Roman empire \u2014 this extensive settlement of that wonderful race on the borders of Wales, had been overlooked and forgotten amid the confusion and barbarism of the succeeding middle ages. In silence profound as the grave, deep lay the charred and blackened ruins of Uriconium, beneath the accumulations of ages !

Little Buildwas, parochially and manorially, was an isolated member of Wroxeter; but in 1175 this ancient status was done away with by William Fitz Alan granting it to Buildwas Abbey. In 1302, Edmund de Lenham and his wife held Little Buildwas under the Abbot. Their services were as follows : \u2014 Edmund and his wife were to place the first dish on the Abbot's table at Build was every Christmas-day, and were to ride with the Abbot any whither within the four seas, at the Abbot's charges.2 (=1) (1(11(1) is noticed in Domesday Book thus : \u2014 \" The same Rainald holds Hatlege, and Goisfrid [holds it] of him.

Respecting Dawley, whose mineral wealth and great iron- works were undreamt of in 1086, Domesday adds, by way of supplement to its notice of Wellington : \u2014 \"Of the land of this manor William [Pantulf] holds of the earl i hide, Dalelie for a manor.

Roger held Uppington and Harrington on condition that he procured the king a sore sparrow haw'c annually: an appropriate serjeantry to attach to the tenure of lands so close to the hawk eyries of Mount Gilbert (the Wrekin.) Roger Mussun, \" for the soul's health of his lord, K ing Henry the Second, and himself and his wife,\" gave land and \"the chapel of Uppington,\" to Wombridge Priory; and by various grants from Roger's successive descendants, eventually that Priory was enabled to establish a clear title to the whole of the manor. To Roger Mussun's charter to Wombridge was attached a round white waxen seal, charged with the figure of a bird, probably a hawk, stretching out its head and whigs. On July 1, 1346, this charter was sent to Lichfield, and exhibited in the course of some legal proceedings affecting Wombridge Priory, when, by some accident, the seal happened to get so fractured that only the letters Rog' i Mussun of the legend remained. A Notary Public then present, upon this was employed to draw up a certificate of the disaster, and of what the seal had been, which curious certificate the canons of Wombridge carefully embodied in their chartulary, so essential was it then deemed to the validity of a document that its seal should be preserved. Uppington parish originally formed part of the Saxon parish of Wroxeter.

That tenant's name was Robert Fitz-Nigel, the same who, \" for the soul's health of himself, his father, mother, and all his friends [gave] the advowson of the church of St. Mary of Schawgesbury \" to Haugh mond Abbey. Robert Fitz-Nigel's son, Wido Fitz-Robert, lord of Shawbury about the year 1200, was waylaid and murdered in the forest of Haughmond. Upon this, deceased's brothers Nigel and Richard successively became lords of the manor ; but the latter, in 1206, having murdered Maurice de Shawbury, suffered out lawry and forfeiture. King John then conferred the manor of Shawbury upon his favourite, Thomas de Erdinton, whose heirs retained it. Henry de Erdington II. is duly returned in the Nomina Villarum of 1316 as Lord of Shawbury. The Church. The Church of St. Mary of Shawbury, which is alluded to in the Domesday notice of the manor, was probably a Saxon foun dation. It included in its parish the afterwards distinct chapelries of Acton Reynald, Moreton Corbet, Grinsill, and Great Withy ford, in each of which vills the lords of the fee founded chapels and cemeteries during the reign of Stephen or Henry II.

They were held by various feoffees under the seigneural lord of the central manor. The Church. The church of St. Peter, at Stoke-upon-Tern, is alluded to in the Domesday notice of the manor. In all likelihood it was one of the original Saxon churches of the district. In 1291, the church of Stokesay, as it was then called, in the deanery of Newport, was valued at \u00a36 13s. 4d. In 1341, the parish of Stoke-super-Teym was rated \u00a35 6s. 8d. to the ninth.

In 1 341, the chapelry of Upton Parva was assessed 16s. to the ninth ; there had been a murrain among the sheep, and the corn crops had failed.

The duty of the tenant was to provide a knight who should conduct the Welshmen of Powis land, whenever they had to visit the English Court. In other words, Robert de Haughton, the lord of Withington's charge, was to provide safe conduct for Welsh embassies between Montford bridge and Shrewsbury, whether going to or returning from the English Court : a service appropriate to the great feudal position which the Haughtons formerly occupied on the Shropshire border. In process of time the Withington serjeantry became extinct, and the whole manor was held for half a knight's fee, under Fitz- Alan, the service due thereon being to provide one esquire, with a barbed horse, etc., at Oswestry, for 40 days.2 Concerning Withington church, although existent so early as 1159, those national records which treat of parish churches are silent ; the reason is, that, originally a chapel of Upton Magna, it belonged to Shrewsbury Abbey. |l{CSf0n-0n-Mcal(lll100rB. Upon arriving at his palatine earldom, Roger de Montgomery conferred upon his vassal, Ralph de Mortemer, three manors in Recordin Hundred ; one of the three, Preston-on-Wealdmoors, is thus described in Domesday Book : \u2014 \" Radulf holds Prestune of Earl Roger.

These roads extended from Spain and Barbary in the east to Assyria in the west, and from Great Britain in the north to Arabia and Egypt in the south. The difficulties that must have been encountered, and the perseverance required, in the completion of such stupendous works, are calculated to impress us with a very high estimate of Roman energy. The Roman Watling Street enters Shropshire close to Weston under-Lizard, south-east of Woodcote. From Weston-under- Lizard, a branch shoots out in a north-westerly direction, which, midway between Woodcote and Newport, bears the name of Pave Lane. This particular line is characterised by that great feature of a Roman road, namely, the direct course it takes from one point to another. The line once chosen, every natural impediment, were it mountain or morass, yielded to the inflexible determination of that great people. Woodcote, situate on the eastern verge of Shropshire in 1086, was held under the Norman earl by Roger Fitz Tetbald.

His eldest son, Geoffrey, even in his father's life- time, attained a high position as a burgess of Shrewsbury. He served the office of bailiff of Shrews bury no less than six times between the years 1290 and 1323 ; and was returned as a burgess of Parliament for that town nine times between 1295 and 1318, his brother, Simon Rondulf, being one of his manucaptors on the last occasion.

A contemporary royal precept granted the canons an exemption from toll and passage throughout the king's dominions, under a penalty of \u00a310, recoverable from any one who should charge them with such dues ; and thus, within four years of its founder's consecration as Bishop of London, the Augustine abbey of Lilleshall was firmly established. Papal privileges and archiepiscopal and regal confirmations, full and remarkable, were not wanting to the monks of Lilleshall. King John's charter, which cost the abbot 30 merks, gives to the canons these extra ordinary franchises : namely, soc, sac, toi, them, infengenthef, and utfengenthef ; also it acquits them of geld, Dangeld, suits of counties, and hundreds, waste, forest regard, army aids, aids to sheriffs, or their serjeants, of stretward, hidage, pleas, and plaints pertain ing to county, and of all secular services, saving such as might be reserved in the charters of any of the canon's suzerains. They were also to be quit of toll, passage, tolls of bridges, ways, ferries, or sea voyages, and of all tolls at fairs throughout the kingdom, except in the city of London, and in respect of such goods as could be proved to belong to themselves, or to have been purchased for their uses. Pope Nicholas's taxation, in 1291, took into account only a few of the sources from whence the abbot of LilleshalPs income was derived ; this computation, therefore, gives no accurate idea of the wealth of the abbey. King Henry VIII.'s Valor in 1535-6, how ever, represents the abbot of Lilleshull as returning the gross income of his monastery in temporalities and spiritualities at \u00a3326 Os. lOd. The abbot was in receipt of rents from the counties of Shropshire, Staffordshire, Cheshire, Derbyshire, Northampton shire, Leicestershire, Yorkshire, and Warwickshire. He was also impropriator of eight churches, three of which were in Shropshire, the others were in the counties of Warwickshire, Leicestershire, Norfolk, Gloucestershire, and Devonshire respectively. On October 16, 1538, the abbot of Lilleshall surrendered up his charge to the king, when Henry VIII., on November 28, 1538, granted the site of the house, etc., in fee farm, to William Caven dish, Esq. In the following year, it was granted to James Lcveson, Esq. William, apparently first abbot of Lilleshall, occurs about 1 148.

The present liberties of Shrewsbury involve all that was contained in the Domesday Hundred, and a great deal more beside.

Surrounded at that early period, as undoubtedly it was, by morasses, the site of Pengwern presented one of eminent natural strength to the fugitives, and if the supposition of the learned authors of the history of Shrewsbury be correct, this town was founded by the Britons about the year 570, one hundred and fifty years after the Romans abandoned Britain. The blue-eyed heathen followed the Britons, however, to their new position. Attacking them, they fired their habitations ; when the royal palace of Pengwern having become enveloped in flames, the unfortunate Britons in despair sought the western mountains. The next authentic notice we have respecting Pengwern or Shrewsbury, is, as forming the capital of the British kingdom of Powis, of which kingdom the portion of Shropshire that was un- occupied by the Saxons constituted the fairest portion, the \" Para- dise of the Cymry,\" as it is enthusiastically called by the ancient British poet Llywarc.1 Obscurity, however, prevails respecting those kings who wielded the sceptre of old Powis in the wattled halls of Pengwern.2 Suffice it to observe, that they were patrioti- cally engaged in perpetual hostilities against the Saxons, who nevertheless continued to encroach upon them, until, after a bloody and exterminating struggle of two centuries' duration, Offa the Terrible, of Mercia, permanently annexed Shropshire to the land of the Angles, or England. To secure his acquisition, the Mercian conqueror cast up the vast entrenchment known as Offa's Dyke, which, extending from the river Wye, six and a half miles north- west of Hereford, boldly traverses for upwards of a hundred miles mountain and plain, until it terminates in the parish of Mold, Elintshire, sixteen miles from the estuary of the Dee. In its course northwards, this stupendous work forms the boundary between Shropshire and Montgomeryshire, in the former of which counties it is still very complete for a distance of twenty miles.3 Pengwern, then, with its palace and houses of wattled twigs and clay, no longer the capital of British Powis, became the abode of the fair-haired Saxons, who gave it the title of bcjiobbef-byjiig, or Shrewsbury, a name which it has ever since retained. Scrobbes- 1 Llywarc Hen, Prince of the Cum brian Britons, whose poems, still extant, prove that he was well acquainted with the mountains, streams, and towns of Shropshire. 2 The domestic architecture of our British ancestors was in the lowest state of rudeness, regal mansions even being constructed of peeled rods. 3 Hartshorne's Salopia Antiqua."], [226, "168 byrig signifies a bury or fenced eminence, overgrown with shrubs. During the Anglo-Saxon era, if Shrewsbury was degraded from its position as the metropolis of a kingdom, on the other hand, it gained in substantial importance. Included now within the king dom of Mercia, whose capital was London, nevertheless Shrewsbury may have been the seat of a subordinate governor. When Ethel fleda, Lady of the Mercians, succeeded in 912 to the government of her deceased husband's province, which had been shorn of London and much of its territory, the heroic daughter of King Alfred, in her frequent contests with the Welsh, must have visited Shrewsbury, for there she founded St. Alcmund's collegiate church. Indeed, the warlike Ethelfleda appears to have devoted much of her attention to Shropshire, in which county she built castles both at Chirbury and Brugge. In the time of the great Anglo-Saxon King Athelstane, who reigned from the year 924 till 940, Shrewsbury was a borough, considered sufficiently important to have the privilege of a mint, and several pennies stamped Scrob, and bearing the name of that monarch have been found. Coins, also, were minted in Shrews bury of the reigns of the Anglo-Saxon Kings Edgar and Ethelred ; Canute, the Anglo-Danish king ; Edward the Confessor ; and Harold II. After the Norman Conquest, coins were struck at Shrewsbury of the reigns of William L, William II. , Henry I., Henry II. , and Henry III. ; after whose time no coins appear to have been minted at Shrewsbury, until the reign of Charles I. We learn from the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle,1 that whilst the pagan host of Danes afflicted his kingdom with their dreadful visitations, Ethelred the Unready, in 1006 passed \"over Thames into Shropshire, and there took his abode during the mid-winter's tide.\" \" Meanwhile,\" adds Henry of Huntingdon, \u2122 King Ethel red lay in sorrow and perplexity at his manor in Shropshire, where he was often sharply wounded with rumours of these disas ters.\"2 Learned men have supposed, from the foregoing, that our Saxon kings had a settled residence in Shrewsbury. Scrobbes-byrig, or Shrewsbury, was the occasional residence of King Ethelred's son-in-law and vicegerent, the infamous Edric Streone, Earl of Mercia ; for here it was that he caused \u00c6hhelm the Ealdorman, to bo treacherously assassinated.3 1 Anglo-Saxon Chron p. 398. Bohn's Ed. 2 Henry of Huntingdon Chron. p. 186, Bohn's Ed. 3 See page 91."], [227, "169 When, in 1015, Edric deserted his imbecile father-in-law and went over to the conquering Anglo-Danish King Knut, or Canute, the men of Shropshire followed the traitorous example of their earl, and made peace with the invader ; for which, in the foUowing year, they were severely punished by Edmund Ironsides.1 Under the Saxon rule, no less than five opulent ecclesiastical foundations sprang up in Shrewsbury. Domesday furnishes us with a very good description of the state of Shrewsbury in the reign of Edward the Confessor. From that venerable record we learn that : \u2014 \" In the town of Shrewsbury, there were 252 houses in the time of King Edward, with a burgess residing in each house ; these altogether paid an annual rent of \u00a37 16s. 8d. King Edward enjoyed the following branches of revenue in this town : \u2014 \" If any person wilfully infringed a protection given under the king's own hand, he was outlawed. He who violated the royal protection given by the sheriff, forfeited 100s. ; and the same sum was exacted for an assault committed on the highway, and for a burglary. These three forfeitures were paid to King Edward in all his demesne lands throughout England, over and above the reserved rents. \" When the king resided in this town, twelve of the better sort of citizens kept watch over him ; and when he went out a hunting, such of them as had horses guarded him. The sheriff used to send thirty-six footmen to the stand, when the king was present ; and at Marsetelie park that officer was bound by custom to find the same number of men for eight days. When he made a progress into Wales, every person who did not obey his summons to accompany him forfeited 40s. \"A widow paid the king 20s. for a license to marry ; a maiden 10s. for the same permission. If a house was burnt by accident without negligence, the burgess who inhabited it paid a fine of 40s. to the king, and 2s. each to his two next neighbours. The king had 10s. for a relief upon the death of every burgess dwelling within the royal demesne ; and if it was not paid by the time which the sheriff appointed, a fine of 10s. more was exacted. If a man wounded another so as to draw blood, he paid 40s. for this offence. When the king departed from the town, if he went south wards, the sheriff sent twenty-four horses with him as far as 1 Simeon Dunelm, p. 172."], [228, "170 Leintwardine ; and he furnished the sovereign with the same number also to the first stage in Staffordshire, when he travelled that way. \" The king had three moneyers in this town, who, after they had purchased their money dies in the same manner as the other nioneyers of the country, were bound, within fifteen days after, to pay the king 20s. each, whilst the new coinage was in progress. Upon the whole, the town paid an annual rent of \u00a330, two-thirds of which went to the king, and the remainder to the sheriff. \" In the reign of King Edward, this town was assessed to the Danegeld at the rate of an hundred hides ; of which \u2014 \" The church of St. Alcniund held ii hides. \" St. Julian half a hide. \" St. Milburg i hide. \" St. Chad a hide and a half. \"St. Mary i virgate (or one-fourth of a hide). ' ' The Bishop of Chester i hide. \"Ediet iii hides.1 \" The bishop of Chester possessed, in Shrewsbury, sixteen masures, each inhabited by a burgess ; he also possessed other bur gesses. He had also sixteen canons in tho town, who were exempt from the payment of Danegeld.\" Allowing a wife and three children for each of the 252 above mentioned burgesses, this would give a population of 1260 souls ; and as, at that unsettled period, it would have been unsafe to have conducted the operations of husbandry at too great a distance from fenced towns, it is probable that, when the Conqueror's survey was taken, Shrewsbury was encircled by an earthen rampart, which included much arable land now covered with the streets, alleys, and gardens of modern Shrewsbury. Excepting the latter clause of the above extract relating to the burgesses possessed by the bishop of Chester, the Shrewsbury bur gesses do not appear in the same degraded aspect as those of many other towns mentioned in Domesday. We are perpetually reminded, in other parts of that record, of villains, slaves, labourers, and, in some towns, burgesses, confined to the soil, and transmitting hereditary and hopeless bondage to their children, but, with the exception alluded to, we read of nothing of the kind in connexion with Shrewsbury. 1 Domesday, so. 252, al."], [229, "171 The Norman Conquest, which subverted the English constitution and produced a total revolution in the ownership of landed pro perty throughout the kingdom, of necessity brought changes to Shrewsbury. When England was invaded by the Normans, in 1066, Edwin and Morcar were joint earls of Mercia. Although opposed to the Norman duke, it nevertheless does not appear that either of them assisted their brother-in-law, King Harold, at the battle of Hastings ; after which great event, one account represents these earls as concurring in placing the youthful Edgar Atheling on the vacant throne, another as aspiring themselves to the crown. At length, perceiving their inability to resist the victorious pro gress of William, Edwin and Morcar swore fealty to the Conqueror, who, in return, confirmed them in their possessions. The reader has already been made acquainted with the details of their revolt and subsequent hard fate.1 Meanwhile the Welsh, who never ceased to scan with envious glance their former fertile province, acting in concert with Edric the forester, invaded Shropshire, and laid siege to the king's castle of Scrobesbury,2 in which they were assisted by the Saxon townsmen. King William lost no time in despatching two earls, William and Brien, to the rehef of the beleaguered stronghold ; yet, ere they could arrive, the com bined Saxon and Welsh host had decamped, after having burnt the town ; at wliich the king was so enraged, that, early in the spring of 1069, he marched at the head of his forces to punish the rebels of Mercia. Then it was, that the Conqueror abolished the old Anglo-Saxon earldom of Mercia, and giving to his kinsman, Roger de Montgomery, nearly the whole of Shropshire, including a grant of the town of Shrewsbury, he conferred on him also the title of Earl of Shrewsbury. In Shrewsbury, then, this Norman seigneur held high court. He pulled down the old castle which had previously existed here, and in its stead erected a Norman fortress on that narrow neck of land by which alone Shrewsbury could be approached. From this stately castle Earl Roger could overawe the Saxon burgesses, or issue forth at the head of chosen counsellors and mail clad warriors, to quiet and govern his province, and repress the Welsh. The condition of Shrewsbury under its first Norman ruler, may be inferred from the following passages-' in Domesday : \u2014 \" In 1 See pp. 65 and 66. 2 Ordericus, B. IV. ch. v"], [230, "172 the year preceding this survey,\" says that record, \" earl Roger received a rent of \u00a340 from the town [which was \u00a310 more than the burgesses had paid in Edward the Confessor's time, whilst their means of payment, as appears from what follows, were much diminished]. The Saxon burgesses complain that they pay the same Danegeld as they did in King Edward's days, although the castle erected by the earl occupies the site of fifty-one houses, while fifty houses lie waste, and forty-three, which paid to the taxes at that time, are now holden by Normans. Besides which, the earl himself has given thirty-nine burgesses to his abbey, who are, therefore, freed from the tax ; and there are now two hundred houses, save seven, which pay nothing.\" Over the burgesses the Norman earl set a pr\u0153positus, or provost: in plain English, a rent-collector, who doubtless extorted from the unhappy Saxons as much as he could, both for his proud master and himself. The sufferings which the English experienced at the hands of their Norman oppressors are, however, too generally known to require comment. It is not to be imagined, and indeed the extract from Domesday just given precludes the supposition that the English burgesses of Shrewsbury, with their families, were exempt from what was the common lot of their down-trodden countrymen. Our Anglo-Saxon forefathers experienced, in its dread reality, the fate of a conquered country. A retributive justice then inflicted on them a similar measure of misery to that which, five centuries before, they had so cruelly dealt out to the unfortunate Britons. Far advanced in years, Roger de Montgomery, the first earl of Shrewsbury, died on July 17, 1094, and was honourably interred, says Ordericus, in the new church which he had founded at Shrews bury. Hugh de Montgomery succeeded his father Roger as Earl of Shrewsbury, who, much engaged in hostilities with his Welsh neighbours, eventually lost his life, in the year 1098, at the straits of Anglesey, whilst endeavouring to repel the invasion of Magnus Barefoot, King of Norway. Pierced by a Norwegian arrow, earl Hugh fell from his horse into the sea, when, his body having been with difficulty recovered, after the lapse of seventeen days, it was buried in the cloister of Shrewsbury abbey. To the earldom of Shrewsbury then succeeded his brother, Robert de Belesme, that monster of whom we have treated.1 In 1 See pp. ii \u2014 14."], [231, "173 concert with many other Anglo-Norman nobles, de Belcsme pre ferred the claim of the indolent Robert Curthose to the English throne to that of Henry I. Beauclerc, however, broke up the hostile confederacy, and, crushing as we have related, his turbulent vassal, banished him to Normandy. Upon the fall of its third and last Norman earl, Shrewsbury, with the lands in Shropshire of those of Robert de Belcsme's vassals who had sided with their suzerain against Henry, reverted to the king ; and henceforth, the earldom of Shrewsbury being vested in the Crown, the king governed the province by a succes sion of Viceroys or stewards, who resided in Shrewsbury castle. The first of these was Richard de Belmeis, in whose time, doubt less, the condition of Shrewsbury was improved ; for good sense, and his position as the occupant of a disputed throne, alike inclined de Belmeis' royal master to court the affections of his Enghsh subjects. Indeed, we learn that such was the case from the charter of King John, which expressly confirms to the burgesses of Shrewbury, all liberties and free customs, and quittances as they held them in the time of King Henry, our great grandfather : \" Omnes libertates, et liberas consuetudines, et quietaneias, sicut eas habue runt tempore regis Henrici proavi nostri,\" are the identical words of John's charter. . Richard de Belmeis was succeeded in his viceregency by Pain Fitz-John, during whose period of office Henry I. visited Shrop shire, and, it is supposed, Shrewsbury. That monarch, however, at London, amidst the solemn festival of Christmas in the year 1126, summoning around him his barons, spiritual ancl lay, in their presence \" gave,\" says William of Malmesbury,1 \" the county of Salop to his wife, the daughter of the Earl of Louvain, whom he had married after the death of Matilda,\" when she appointed as her sheriff William Fitz Alan. When the civil war, consequent on the usurpation of Stephen broke out, Fitz Alan loyally adhered to the cause of the Empress Maude. In July, 1138, the active usurper laid siege to Shrews bury Castle, which, in the following month, he stormed and took. Ordericus2 has furnished us with the following particulars of what occurred after the capture of Shrewsbury Castle. \"Arnulf de Hesdin, the uncle of this young man (Fitz Alan), a beUicose and venturesome soldier, arrogantly refused the peace which the king Modem History, b. I. 2 B. XIII. ch. xxxvii."], [232, "174 offered him on several occasions, and obstinately forced others who wished to surrender themselves, to persist in their rebellion. At last, when the fortress was reduced, he was taken amongst many others, and brought into the presence of the king, whom he had treated with contempt. The king, however, finding that his gentleness had lowered him in the eyes of the revolters, and that in consequence many of the nobles summoned to his court had disdained to appear, was so incensed that he ordered Arnulf and nearly ninety-three others of those who had resisted him, to be hung on the gallows, or immediately executed in other ways. Arnulf now repenting too late, and many others on his behalf, supplicated the king, offering a large sum of money for his ran som. But the king preferring vengeance on his enemies to any amount of money, they were put to death without delay. Their haughty accomphces were greatly terrified when they heard of the king's severity, and came in haste three days afterwards to the king, offering various excuses for having so long delayed their submission. Some of them brought the keys of their fortresses, and humbly offered their services to the king.\" Escaping from Shrewsbury Castle, Fitz Alan remained an exile until, in 1152, young Prince Henry having landed in England, among his brilliant successes, according to some,.1 was the re-capture of Shrewsbury Castle. At any rate, shortly afterwards the usurper died, when Henry II. mounting his grandfather's throne, restored to William Fitz Alan his vast possessions and the sheriffdom of Shropshire. During the reign of Henry II. the burgesses of Shrewsbury probably enjoyed many of those privileges possessed by their fore fathers in the days of Edward the Confessor. They were hable, however, to be taxed arbitrarily at the will of the Crown. Thus, in 1155, the year after Henry II. had ascended his throne, the burgesses of Salopesberie paid an aid of ten merks into the king's Exchequer \u2014 a sum equivalent to \u00a3350 of our present money. Again, in 1159, Shrewsbury paid through the sheriff of Shropshire into the king's Exchequer, a sum of five merks by way of a donum ; but, in 1170, the burgesses of Shrewsbury, hke those of Bridge north, made an effort to escape out of the clutches ofthe sheriff by fining with the Crown that, in lieu of the several payments and 1 Caradoc of Llancarvan, a cotemporary Welsh Chronicler quoted by Dr. Powell in his History of Wales, p. 1 72."], [233, "175 forfeitures for which they were continually hable, they might be permitted to pay a certain fixed rent. In 1185, they paid \u00a320 and two coursers, pro firma burgi, that henceforth, they might pay their own ferm or chief rent direct into the Exchequer, without being subject to the extortions of the sheriff or any other intermediate officer. King Henry II. , it would appear, visited Shrewsbury more than once ; and as that monarch engaged in frequent contests with the Welsh, although history has not recorded the circumstances, doubt less this town was the scene, during that unsettled period, of many a negociation and contest. There can be no doubt that a written charter of hberties, granted to Shrewsbury by Henry II. once existed, as it is expressly referred to in King John's charter ; yet the earliest charter now preserved in the archives of the corporation is that of Richard I. This, dated the 11th of November, in the first year of Richard's reign, grants the town of Salopesbiri to be holden by the burgesses thereof for forty merks of silver of annual rent \u2014 a sum equivalent to \u00a31,104 of modern currency. Ten of these merks were a com mutation for the two horses (pro duobus fugatoribus) due in the reign of Henry II. ; from whence we ascertain the fact, that a hunter in that age cost as much as would purchase more than a score of oxen. King John had not been a fortnight on the throne (1199) ere the Shrewsbury burgesses obtained from him two charters. \"The first of these,\" say the historians of Shrewsbury,1 \" is a mere recital of the free customs of Henry I., and a confirmation of the charter of Henry II. ; but the second, dated a week after the first, introduces several new privileges of very great importance to the welfare of the town. \" It sanctions the formation (if it does not suppose the existence) of a ' common council of the town,' in which it authorises the burgesses to elect two of the most loyal and discreet burgesses, and to present them to the sheriff of the county : one of these the sheriff is to present to the chief justiciary at Westminster, when he delivers in his accounts ; 2 and these two burgesses, thus chosen, are well and faithfully to keep the pr\u00e6positure (i.e., the office of 1 Owen and Blakeway, Hist, of the chief magistrates of Shrewsbury Shrews., vol. i, p. 83. Have always been elected about, that 2 Which was at Michaelmas, hence season."], [234, "176 provost or reeve), of the town, and shall not be removed as long as they behave themselves well in that bailiwick, except by the common council of the town. He also grants that, by the same common council, they may elect four of the more loyal and dis creet burgesses to keep the pleas of the Crown,1 and other things which belong to the Crown in the said burgh, and to take care that the provosts treat both rich and poor in a lawful manner.\" Thus, King John's charter abolished for ever the odious and tyrranical office of the reeve, or provost, appointed first by the Norman earl, and afterwards by the king ; henceforth the burgesses of Shrewsbury elected their own provosts in their own common council. Yet, because they were permitted to elect their chief magistrate, it must not be imagined that the burgesses of Shrews bury at once stept into the enjoyment of that enlarged hberty which their descendants enjoy \u2014 the precious boon of constitutional freedom which Englishmen of the nineteenth century enjoy is the result of many centuries' struggle. As a borough belonging to the king, Shrewsbury for the present remained subject to arbitrary talliages. On February 24th, 1204-5, John gave a third charter to Shrewsbury, the last clause of which granted to the burgesses liberty to hold a fair for three days on the 1st and two following days of June. In accordance with the practice of that age, John mulcted the honest burgesses of Shrewsbury of a very heavy sum for his various charters. The reign of King John was one of stirring interest for Shrews bury. Impelled by that noble and invincible love of freedom which has ever inspired them, the Welsh had always been restless and uneasy neighbours to the English. Llewellyn the Great now wielded the sceptre of North Wales \u2014 a prince whose enterprising spirit the Anglo-Norman monarch judged it expedient to con ciliate, and John gave him in marriage his natural daughter Johanna, by Agatha, daughter of Robert Earl of Ferrars ; for this base king did not scruple to pollute the noblest families of the realm by his hcentious amours. With his daughter, John gave to Llewellyn the lordship of Ellesmere. The king also endeavoured 1 The Pleas ofthe Crown here alluded to, were certain forfeitures due from the burgesses of Shrewsbury to the king, on the commission of offences ; such as theft, arson, etc. These penalties had formerly been exacted by the provost or reeve of the town, who, having generally abused his office, the power he exercised was now taken from him, and vested in four of the most respectable burgesses."], [235, "177 to gain the prince to his side, by chiming in with his scheme of reviving the obsolete claims of his ancestors to a supremacy over aU the Welsh princes ; in accordance with which, John insidiously invited Gwenwynwyn, Prince of Powis, to Shrewsbury, where he threw him into prison. Yet Llewellyn, whose darling object was the independence of his principality, was not to be diverted from his project by the advances of the English king, and, taking advantage of the embroiled state of his father-in-law's affairs, he commenced hostilities. Upon this, John assembled an army at Whitchurch, on July 8th, 121 1,1 and marching into Wales, pene trated as far as Snowdon, and laid waste the surrounding country. Unable to resist, the Welsh submitted to the English king, who, taking with him twenty-eight hostages from among the most dis tinguished families of Wales, then withdrew. In the very next year, the Welsh broke their engagement, and advanced into England ; when John, with savage ferocity, caused every one of his twenty-eight hostages to be hung, nor would the inhuman king take any refreshment until his horrid command had been obeyed. At this all Wales was flung into mourning. Meanwhile, the Anglo-Norman lords fell out with their king, and civil war swept over the fair realm of England. Grateful, it may have been, for favours conferred upon them by King John, the Shrewsbury burgesses adhered to the king. On the other hand, the exasperated Welsh eagerly espoused the cause of the barons; and, headed by Llewellyn, in 1215, they marched to attack the town of Shrewsbury. Avoiding the Welsh bridge, where the burgesses awaited his approach, Llewellyn the Great suddenly appeared before the gates of the stone bridge ; when, having set fire to the abbot's premises, he stormed the town, and took from the hated king of England, Pengwern, the seat of his ancestors. Notwithstanding the extravagant strains of his bards, who now tuned their harps in notes of triumph to Llewellyn's well-pleased ear, Pengwern did not long continue in the hands of the victorious Welshman. In the year 1216, the last of his inglorious reign and life, John had recovered Shrewsbury, for he was here on August 14th of that year. We have many notices of Shrewsbury in the time of Henry III.

In his second year, a royal mandate directed the good men of Salop to bestow all their diligence and care in strengthening and closing their town, lest the king's enemies should enter the same ; ] and to aid them in their loyal undertaking, a patent in the fourth year of his reign grants to the burgesses of Salop the privilege of taking once a week the following tolls : \u2014 Of every cart bringing things for sale into the town, one half penny. If the cart belong to another county, one penny. Of every horse-load of things brought for sale (wood excepted), one farthing. Of every horse, marc, cow, or ox, exposed for sale, one half penny. Of ten sheep, goats, or pigs, one penny. Of every vessel coming into the town by Severn, laden with goods for sale, fourpence.

Henry III. paid no less than six different visits to Shrewsbury ; twice he was here in the year 1220, once in 1226, 1232, 1241, and 1267. These repeated visits appear to have been undertaken by the English king for the purpose either of making treaties with the Welsh, or chastising them for infractions of the truce. A com plication of skirmishing and negotiating, as the reader may sup pose, was not conducive to the prosperity of the fertile plains of Shropshire. At the beginning of 1234, Llewellyn, with his ally, the famous Richard Marshal,3 entered this county with a powerful army, and they \"spread fire,\" says Roger of Wendover, \"wher ever they went ; so that, from the confines of Wales, as far. as the town of Shrewsbury, there was not a place that escaped their ravages ; they then burned the town of Shrewsbury, and then returned home with valuable booty.\" 4 Shrewsbury was destined also to share in the sufferings consequent on the civil war of the ' Pat. 2 Hen. iii. m. i. 2 Pat. 4 Hen. iii. m. 4. 3 Seepage 28.

In fact, the \" incurable loyalty \" of this district well-nigh caused a severance of Shropshire and its county town from the crown ot England; for Simon Montfort, in the name of the captive king of England, appears to have actually ceded them to his ally, the Welsh prince.1 The royalist victory of Evesham, however, hindered the projected annexation. After recovering his freedom, King Henry III., \" for the fidelity and constancy with which the said burgesses (of Shrewsbury) have heretofore adhered to us, and our son Edward, and also for the losses which they have sustained on the same account during the disturbance of late had in the realm,\" granted to the men of Shrewsbury sundry privileges.2 From such deplorable pictures of the state of our country in the good old times, it is jileasant l0 turn and witness the gradual approach of the burgesses of Shrewsbury towards a better era. They obtained from Henry III., in the eleventh year of his reign, a charter which manifests, say the historians of Shrewsbury, \" a spirit unusually humane and enlightened, for the age in which it was issued, towards an unhappy race, of whom we know nothing but from books, and to the extinction of whose servitude in Shrop shire this royal grant first opened the way.\" 3 The sixteenth clause of this charter stipulates, \" That none of the king's sheriffs shall intermeddle with the burgesses in any plea, or quarrel, or claim, or in aught belonging to the said borough,\" etc. The eighteenth clause recognises and establishes the authority of the merchant gild at Shrewsbury, by providing that : \u2014 \" The said burgesses and their heirs, may have a merchant gild, with a hanse,4 1 T. Wikes, p. 69, quoted by. Owen and BLAKEWAY, Hist, of Shrews., vol. i. p. 128. 2 Charter of Hen.

Gilds are traceable to a remote antiquity, and were known in this country in Saxon times. From a set of nine parchment rolls, sewed together (the earliest preserved amongst the archives of the corporation), it is clear that the Gild of Shrewsbury existed antecedent to this charter of 1227. The first roll commences as follows : \u2014 \"May the Haly Spirit be present with us! \" The names of those who are in Gild Merchant in the burgh of Salop, and whose fathers were not before in the liberties of the Gild in the eleventh year of King John, and whose fine is 5s. $d.\" Then follow thirty names, etc., from whence it would appear, that there were persons in the merchant gild of this town in the eleventh year of King John (1209) whose fathers were before in the liberties of the gild. Henry III.'s charter, then,"], [238, "180 and other customs and liberties belonging to such gild ; and no one who does not belong to that gild shall exercise merchandize in the borough, without the consent of the burgesses.\" The nineteenth clause of Henry's charter relates to the enfran chisement of serfs, a very numerous class in this country in the 13th century : \u2014 \" If any native (born in villeinage or slavery) of any person shall remain in the said borough, and hold himself in the same gild and hanse, and in lot and scot with the said bur gesses for one year and one day without challenge (i.e., without being claimed by his lord), he may not be again demanded by his lord, if he freely continue in the said borough.\" Finally, the twentieth clause grants, that \"the burgesses of Shrewsbury, and their heirs, shall be free of toll, lestage, passage, pontage, stallage, lene, Danegelds, gaywite, and aU other customs and exactions, both in England and all other the king's territories, saving the liberty of the city of London.\" As if it had been overlooked when this passed the great seal, a second charter, consisting of a single clause, and dated the same day, also granted to the men of Shrewsbury, \" that no person may purchase raw hides or undressed cloth within the borough, unless he be in lott and scott, and in assessments and talliages with the burgesses \" : that is, unless he contributed to the pubhc burdens. In accordance with the narrow-minded commercial notions of that period, this clause had for its object the securing to the burgesses the advantage of preparing those commodities for sale. On the 10th of August, 1256, Henry III. granted two more charters to the loyal burgesses of Shrewsbury. One of the privi leges conferred by these gave the burgesses the right \" to answer by their own hand at the king's exchequer, for all their debts and summons issuing out of that court, and affecting their town.\" Again, \" If any of their servants commit any offence which in duces a forfeiture of goods, the goods of the burgesses, their masters, either found in the hands of the servants, or deposited by them anywhere, are saved from forfeiture, on proof that the goods are really the property ofthe burgesses.\" These charters likewise conferred upon the burgesses of Shrews bury the two following important privileges : 1st, that \"if any of compelled every one who would carry on member of this gild, which formerly was business in Shrewsbury to become a a voluntary association."], [239, "181 them died, with or without a will, their goods should not be confiscated by the crown, but that their heirs should enjoy the whole ;\" 2ndly, that \" burgesses shall be convicted only by their peers, burgesses of the town ; and shall be tried according to their liberties used and approved.\" In the age of which we are writing, if a burgess of one town owed money in another, it was lawful for the creditor to detain any of the debtor's fellow-townsmen who might be travelling, in the ordinary course of business, that way with goods. King Henry III.'s charter, however, expressly confers upon the burgesses of Shrewsbury the privilege \" that neither they nor their goods shall be arrested for any debt in which they are neither principal debtors nor sureties.\" Thus a better day gradually dawned upon the men of Shrewsbury. Having returned from Palestine, Edward I. determined to carry out the ambitious project of annexing Wales to England. With this object in view, he summoned Llewellyn to meet him at Shrews- bury, and do him homage there. The brave Welsh prince, how- ever, was in no hurry to comply with the English monarch's order, when Edward peremptorily summoned him to Westminster. As Llewellyn still continued refractory, he was condemned as a rebel, and military operations were commenced forthwith against him. Regardless of the inconvenience to which he put his subjects, and in violation of the terms of Magna Charta, which direct that the Court of Common Pleas was always to sit in the same place, in order to convince Llewellyn of his determination not to give up the contest until he had gained his end, Edward I. now transferred the seat of government to Shrewsbury. \"A.D., 1277. In the fortnight after Easter,\" says the contemporary chronicler, \" the king withdrew from Westminster, and hastened towards Wales with all the military force of the kingdom of England, taking with him his barons of the exchequer, and his justices of the king's bench, as far as Shrewsbury, who remained there some time, hearing suits according to the customs of the kingdom of England. Therefore the Welsh, fearing the arrival of the king and his army, fled to their accustomed refuge of Snowdon.\" ' That Edward I. was in person at Shrewsbury in the autumn of that year, we know from certain writs which he expedited for the conveyance of stores to the army. He left it on the 16th of October, after which the 1 Matt.

Having effected a reconciliation with his brother David, impelled by a sense of national ardour, the indignant Welsh prince, however, in 1282, again flew to arms, when Edward, upbraiding him with ingratitude, reassembled his army at Shrewsbury, and again re moved his courts thither.1 But death released Llewellyn from the grasp of Edward. The Welsh prince fell near Buelht by the hands of assassins, when, his head having been sent to London, it was derisively encircled by a wreath of ivy, and fixed upon the Tower. Animated with the prospect of for ever crushing the British dynasty, King Edward now prosecuted the war with vigour, and having got Llewellyn's brother into his hands, he determined to make of him an example such as he judged might deter Welshmen in future from disputing his supremacy. For this purpose, Prince David was sent in chains to Shrewsbury, where a parliament was summoned to meet on September 30, 1283. \"It was the first national convention in which the Commons had any share by legal authority; for that summoned by De Montfort cannot be called such. Besides one hundred and ten earls and barons, here were two knights from each county, and two deputies from certain of the principal cities and towns 2 of the kingdom, probably that they might witness the rigid justice of their monarch : so that Shrews bury witnessed the earliest legitimate traces of that popular repre sentation in the constitution to which, under God, Englishmen have been indebted for all their subsequent prosperity.\"3 Tradition has it, tbat the lords sat in the castle, and the commons in a barn 1 Journeying backwards and forwards so great a distance over bad roads, and by the awkward system of conveyance in vogue at that early period, could not be otherwise than productive of injury to our national records.

Tlie omission of writs to the bishops and ab bots, commanding their attendance at thjs solemn convention is remarkable. The spiritual peers have no votes in cases of blood. Their not having been summoned on this occasion, therefore, looks very like as if the King of England anticipated the condemnation of the Welsh prince from the Parliament. Dr. Brady, in his treatise on boroughs, speaks of 23 Ed. I. (1295) as being the first time that citizens or burgesses were summoned to Parlia ment. From the above, however, it is certain that he is wrong."], [241, "183 belonging to the Abbot of Shrewsbury. From the circumstance, however, that Shrewsbury Castle was then probably being rebuilt (for Edward I. reconstructed this fortress) it is more likely that this Parliament sat either in the chapter house or the refectory of Shrewsbury Abbey. Prince David was tried by the Lords, his presumed peers ; the Commons therefore, having no concern in his trial, meanwhile may have assembled for some unrecorded purpose in a barn within the precincts of the Abbey. That both Lords and Commons afterwards adjourned to Acton Burnell is however certain. Llewellyn's brother, after a short trial, was condemned, when Shrewsbury witnessed a horrible spectacle. The unfortunate prince, after having been dragged by horses through the streets and lanes of this town, was hung up for a short time, and then cut down alive. His heart and bowels were afterwards torn out and literally burned before his eyes ; he was next be headed, and his body having been cut into four parts, his head was sent to London, to be stuck up along with that of his brother, whilst the quarters meanwhile were fixed in four principal cities of the kingdom. Thus did the conqueror, according to the shock ing practice of that age, seek to strike terror into the hearts of all opposed to his authority. After the conquest of Wales, Shrewsbury lost that importance it had acquired in consequence of occupying a frontier position on a hostile territory, and henceforth it ranked as an ordinary pro vincial town. The condition of the burgesses of Shrewsbury in the reign of Edward II. may be inferred from a taxation-roll of the liberty of the town of Salop, of a fifteenth part of all moveable goods granted to the king in 1313. At this date, the Shrewsbury burgesses, in addition to their ordinary trade or handicraft, appear to have been somewhat in the condition of little farmers, for most of them had some hve stock : the produce of their little plot of land probably went to supply the necessities of their own household. \\Ye may judge how inquisitorial and oppressive this taxation must have been, from the circumstance that the assessors descended to the most minute particulars. Thus we learn from this roll, that : \u2014 \" Isabel, widow of Eoger the Locksmith : [was possessed of] malt [to the value of] 6s. ; a small heifer, 3s. ; four pigs, 3s. ; a pot, 4s. ; Us . ; household utensils, 12d. ;\" [upon all which this widow had to pay to Edward II. the fifteenth part of their value]."], [242, "184 \" The Prior of St. John, three draught horses, 9s. ; a cart and har ness, 4s. 3d. ; a quarter and a half of wheat, 6s. ; a quarter of rye, 40d. ; three quarters of oats, 6s. ; three bushels of pease, 9d. ; utensils, 8d. \"Nicholas de Bakelare : ten sheep, 10s.; an heifer, 3s.; a silver brooch, 20d. ; wood, lOd. ; flesh, 18d. \" Nicholas Ive : three draught horses, 10s. ; flesh, 6s. ; a mazer cup, [i. e. one of mixed metal], 4s. ; two silver cups, 6s. ; six silver spoons, 6s. \"Eichard de Hultone : in money, 21s.; malt, 20s.; wheat 26s.; oats, ; rye, ; pledges, 6s.; a horse, 13s; flesh, 11s. ; silk and sindon, 13s. ; boots and gloves, 6s. \" Adam the Blacksmith, upon the Wyle : iron and coals, 15s.\" [out of this, which was the whole of his property, Adam had to pay 12d.]. \" John MFisher : a boat, 3s.; nets, 2s.; wood, 12d. ; two Httle pigs, 8d. ; a calf, 6d. ; utensils, 4d. \" Eoger le Parmenter, opposite the Castle : washed sMkins, 13s. 4d. ; lamb, fox, and rabbit sMkins, 13s. 4d. ; furs, 20s. ; malt, 6s. ; wood, 4s. ; household utensils, 3s.\"1 Edward II. was loyally received by the inhabitants of Shrews- bury when, assembling his forces, he marched through the west in pursuit of Lord Badlesmere. Clad in armour, the burgesses went out to meet the king, and conveying him into their fortified town, there he remained from the 15th to the 23rd of January, 1322, busily engaged in devising measures against his own antagonists, and those of his favourites, the Despencers. From Shrewsbury, the king issued a proclamation of general amnesty to all his sub jects, Badlesmere excepted, of which when Roger de Mortimer of Wigmore and his uncle Mortimer of Chirk heard, they proceeded thither, and threw themselves at the king's feet. No sooner, however, did Edward II. find these barons in his power than, oblivious of his solemn assurance, he consigned them to the Tower of London. The disgraceful arrest of these two nobles within the walls of Shrewsbury, in the neighbourhood of which they had large possessions, appears to have disgusted the burgesses, and upon the subsequent revolution which terminated in the murder of Ed- ward II. , they actively assisted the king's enemies. With the exception of a new charter which its burgesses ob- tained from the king, and a considerable relaxation of good order among the inhabitants of this town, owing to the great pestilence that twice during the reign of Edward III. swept with fearful 1 From time immemorial there has been a skinner's yard under the castle."], [243, "185 violence over England, there is nothing of special interest con nected with the history of Shrewsbury during that monarch's long and glorious reign.

Occupying a low spot in the eastern suburb, at the confluence of Meole brook with the Severn, are the remains of Shrewsbury Abbey. We learn from Ordericus that Siward erected in Shrews bury a chapel in honour of St. Peter. That it was a small wooden structure we glean from other good sources of information,1 and in this condition it remained until Earl Roger de Montgomery gave it to his counsellor Ordelirius, the father of Ordericus, the monkish historian. In 1082, Ordelirius went on' pilgrimage to Rome, where he vowed that if he should return in safety to Shrewsbury he woidd, in place of the wooden church, build a more imposing edifice of stone in honour of St. Peter and St. Paul. Returning to Shropshire, the Norman earl concurred in the design, and convening Warin the sheriff, Picot de Say, and others of his nobles, on Saturday, the 3rd of March, 1083, explained to them his intention, when Roger's vassals applauded the resolution. After the assembly had broken up, the earl repaired to St. Peter's, where, in the presence of many witnesses, he vowed that he would found an abbey, and, granting thereto the whole suburb lying without the eastern gate, he confirmed his donation by laying his gloves upon the altar. Rainald and Frode, two monks skilled in architecture, now came over from Normandy to superintend the erection of the proposed abbey, which gradually arose. At the time of Domesday the building was still going on ; and we learn from that record that the earl had conferred upon the monastery \" as many of his burgesses [39 was the pumber] and mills as brought in an annual rent to the monks of \u00a312.\" At the period of the survey, the abbey also held four manors, and seven churches ; the greater part of the produce of whose glebe the monks appro priated to themselves.

Rich although Shrewsbury Abbey once was, doubtless there were ample calls upon its income. The decoration and repair of their church and build ings, charity to the poor, hospitality to the stranger, besides the taking care of themselves, seldom left the monks much ready money. As a Baron and Peer of Parliament, the Abbot of Shrewsbury sat in the House of Lords until the Dissolution. In common with the shorn fraternity of other medi\u00e6val estab lishments, the monks of Shrewsbur}' studied to raise their house in public esteem by the acquisition of various relics. With this object in view, at no little trouble and cost, they acquired the bones of \" the blessed virgin Wenefrede,\" the odour of whose sanctity was such, that, according to monkish authority, \" a little dust out of the virgin's skull mixed with holy water \" immediately cured a sick man. By the end of Henry II.'s reign, the abbey treasury reckoned amongst a long hst of miracle-performing stores, besides the body of St. AVenefrede, bones, hair, and vestments of various apostles and martyrs ; some of the milk, the chemise, couch, and tomb of the Yirgin ; some cloth stained with the blood of Thomas (a Bec ket), the martyr, etc. The site of the abbey comprises about ten acres. Surrounded by an embattled wall, which still encloses its north and eastern side, this stately abbey, with its refectory, kitchen, dormitory, infirmary, chapter-house, treasury, library, and abbot's lodging, above all of which towered its great church, must have once pre sented the appearance of a fortified town, and doubtless displayed a majestic group of architecture to the traveller as he approached the ancient capital of Shropshire. Alas ! devastation has befallen every part of the conventual buildings. The present parochial church of the Holy Cross embraces within its walls the nave, side aisles, porch, and western tower of the abbey church. Although barbarously mutilated and its fair pro-"], [245, "187 f portions curtailed, a certain solemn dignity still clings to the venerable fabric. What, then, must have been the effect produced on the mind of the devotee in dajrs of yore, when the setting sun shot his emblazoning rays through its stained windows upon the taper columns, and lofty fretted roof, richly dight mosaic pave ment, and gorgeous high altar, and lit up the splendidly-attired sacerdotal procession, which was wont, on high festival days, with crosses and banners, to sweep chaunting along its solemn aisles ! The present remnant of the abbey church displays two distinct styles of ecclesiastical architecture. The whole basement of the fabric, the three plain semi-circular arches, and thick low round columns of the eastern portion of the nave, the west door as well as other parts distinguished for their massive solidity, were erected in the eleventh century. The western division of the nave, the magnificent west window, and whole superstructure of the tower, belong to the fourteenth century. Fulchered was first abbot of Shrewsbury, appointed in 1087. We read that, indignant at King William the Second's irreligious appropriation of ecclesiastical benefices, \" Fulchered, Abbot of Shrewsbury, a powerful preacher and eloquent expounder of God's law, ascended the pulpit \" at Gloucester, and denounced the im- pending wrath of heaven. \"Behold!\" he exclaimed, \"the bow of celestial anger is bent against the reprobate ; and an arrow, swift to wound, is drawn out of the quiver ;\" on the very next day, Rufus was slain by Tyrrel's arrow, in the New Forest. Ful- chered died in 1120, when, according to Ordericus, \" Godefred succeeded, in the reign of Henry. Both were literate and religious pastors, and studied to educate the Lord's flock diligently for nearly forty years.\" After Godefred, Herbert \" usurped the rudder of the infant establishment.\" The last abbot was Thomas Boteler, who, surrendering in 1539-40, had a liberal pension assigned him. Notwithstanding the efforts of the Corporation of Shrewsbury, who petitioned the king \" to erect the house of the late abbey into a college or free school,\" Henry VIII. granted the house and site of the dissolved abbey, with its appurtenances, \" houses, barns, stables, dovecotes, gardens, orchards, pools, lands, etc., and all profits,\" woods, etc., in the premises to Edward Watson and Henry Herdson, two speculators in land, who, on the 23rd of July, 1546 (the very next day) conveyed their acquisition to William Langley of Salop, who transmitted the abbey estate to his descendants for five generations."], [246, "188 The Manor of the Foregate over which, undoubtedly, the abbots once were lords, was granted by Queen Ehzabeth to Robert Newdigate and Arthur Fountayne, who, the day following, con veyed it to Richard Prynce, Thomas Hatton, and Thomas Rock, gentlemen, and the heirs of the survivor. Hatton proved to be this survivor, in whose family the manor continued till the 10th of February, 1654, when it was conveyed to Sir Richard Prynce, knight, son of the original joint-grantee, whose descendant, the Earl of Tankerville, is now lord of this manor. Yicarage of the Holy Cross. \u2014 The endowment of this must have taken place at a very early period. Early Incumbents. \u2014 William, Clerk of the Cross, supposed to have been vicar here, attested a deed in the chartulary of the abbey previously to 1228 ; Henry, vicar of the altar of the Holy Cross, about 1240. The Abbot and Convent of Shrewsbury presented to this vicar age until the Dissolution. In the abbey church of the Holy Cross is the mutilated effigy of a warrior, represented in the act of unsheathing his sword. This cumbent figure is said to represent Roger de Montgomery, founder of Shrewsbury Abbey ; yet, if it is intended to commemo rate the great Norman earl, judging from the costume, it must have been executed at least a hundred years after his decease. There is an interesting statue of Edward III. over the west window of the abbey church. On the fall of St. Chad's church, and demolition of old St. Alkmund's, several curious ancient monuments were removed to the abbey church, in the ample side aisles of which they are now to be seen. Church of St. Giles. Those who were afflicted with that dreadful scourge of former times, the leprosy, used to consider St. Giles their patron saint ; he was, in fact, the patron of cripples in general. Among the various hospitals erected in England for lepers, this at Shrewsbury appears to have been founded as early as most of them, for un questionably it was existent in the reign of Henry II., who, among other indications of his bounty towards the infirm of Shrewsbury, granted the lepers of St. Giles \" a handful of two hands of every sack of corn, and a handful of one hand of every sack of flour, exposed to sale in Salopesbiri market.\" The church of St. Giles appears to have been originally intended"], [247, "189 for the service of the hospital, which formerly adjoined it on the west. It consists of a nave, chancel, north aisle, and small turret. The north aisle is divided from the nave by three pointed arches, resting on plain round pillars. A handsome pointed arch separates the nave from the chancel. The south door is as old as the time of Henry I. St. Giles is a vicarage in the gift of the vicar of Holy Cross. St. Chad's Church. Offa, who reigned from 758 to 796, is said to have converted the palace of the Kings of Powis into a church, and founded St. Chad's. Ceadda or Chad, \" that true and gentle servant of God,\" became Bishop of Lichfield, and died on the 2nd of March, 672. He was canonised in 779, and chosen by Offa for patron of the first Saxon church erected in Scrobbesbyrig. At that early period, churches were thinly scattered over the country, and, wherever they existed, a body of clergy lived together collegiate fashion. St. Chad's, then, was originally a Saxon collegiate church, and its secular priests or canons were presided over by a dean. The canons of St. Chad's were not useless members of society, for, diligently clearing and tilling the lands which had been assigned them, at the period of the Conqueror's Survey their estate comprised twenty- three carucates and a half, or 2,820 acres of arable land. After Domesday, St. Chad's estate became still greater ; and King Edward III. claimed it as a royal free chapel, independent of all ecclesiastical jurisdiction, episcopal or even papal. That St. Chad's was a stone church before the Conquest is proved by the fragments of Saxon sculpture discovered on the rebuilding of the present church. After the Conquest, a spacious Anglo- Norman structure, in which, however, the early English style was visible, crowned the summit of the southern eminence which Shrewsbury now covers. It was a heavy-looking conventual fabric' of a cruciform shape. An unadorned low tower of two stories rose from its centre. The interior was majestic. Five boldly-moulded semi-circular arches springing from well propor- tioned round columns separated the nave and aisles. Above was the clerestory. Its choir presented a beautiful specimen of early English. The only portion of this fabric that remains is the Lady Chapel, most of which is of later work. On the morning of July 9th, 1788, just as four o'clock had been chimed, the tower of St. Chad's fell with a tremendous crash upon the roof of the nave and transept, and hurled the greater portion"], [248, "190 of the venerable fabric to the ground. The first stone of the present Grecian-looking church of St. Chad's was laid, upon a new site, on the 2nd of March, 1790. Deans of St. Chad's. \u2014 The earliest which occur are \u2014 I. William de Colenham ; II. William de Sewksworth ; III. Robert Peet of Worcester, 1296. \" The collegiate church of St. Chad fell by the Act of 1 Edward VI., 1547. The parish of St. Chad's was and still is of great extent. In Queen Elizabeth's time, and afterwards, the right of nomi nating to St. Chad's was considered to be vested in the Corporation, who repeatedly presented ; but in 1637, the Crown claimed the presentation, with whom it now remains. In 1674, Nathaniel Tench, Esq., of London, largely augmented this living by restor ing to St. Chad's the tithes of corn and hay of the grange of Crow Meole. Early Incumbents. \u2014 Sir John Beget, vicar, 1334 : Sir Philip Lanley, vicar in St. Chad's, 1354 ; Sir John SaUowe occurs as vicar ofthe collegiate church of St. Chad, 1369. ' The College of St. Chad, of which scarcely a vestige remains, adjoined the south-western end of the old church. St. Mary's Church. Comprising the greatest portion of the town after St. Chad's, and probably second in antiquity to it, was the foundation of St. Mary's Collegiate Church. \" The collegiate or parish church of St. Mary was founded by King Edgar for the maintenance of a dean, seven prebendaries, and a parish priest,\" said Henry the Eighth's com missioners. As the learned historians of Shrewsbury, however, have observed, under the influence of St. Dunstan, as Edgar was, \" nothing is more improbable than that he should have any con cern in the foundation of a church which consisted of secular clergy.\" 2 All we know concerning this church in Saxon times is, that it held lands amounting in the aggregate to not quite 1,300 acres. When the Conqueror's survey was taken, it held the same property, which had then, however, become diminished in value. Yet, humble although its possessions were, in the latter half of the eleventh century, the fabric was considered the most important in Shrewsbury. The dean, three of the prebendaries, and Horm or Orm, vicar 1 lichfield Reg. 2 Owen and Blakeway's Hist, of Shrews., Vol. 2, p. 302."], [249, "191 of St. Mary's, occur as witnesses to a deed of the time of Henry II. The Hundred Rolls of 1255 say, that \" the church of St. Mary is a free chapel of our lord the king, and there are there ten pre bends,\" etc. ; and Edward IL, when master Rigaud de Asserio was sent to England by Pope John XXII, in 1317, for the purpose of enforcing the payment of Peter's Pence, stood up for the rights of his free chapel of St. Mary, and by writ close addressed to the papal agent, forbade him to \" exact certain intolerable imposi tions\" from its dean and prebendaries.1 In 1332, St. Mary's church was selected as the place where the Pope's legates held their court for the adjustment of the differences existing between the English king and AVelsh prince. St. Mary's church stands on an eminence on the north-eastern side of Shrewsbury. Of a cruciform shape, this venerable fabric consists of a nave, north and south aisles, transept, chancel, and two chantry chapels. A clerestory crowns the fabric, at the west ern end of which is a spire visible for miles around. Of the original Saxon foundation there exists no indication, unless it may be the low level of the floor. The church that now exists presents work of the mixed Anglo-Norman and early English styles, and is one of the finest in the county of Salop. One of St. Mary's windows contains stained glass, formerly in the east window of old St. Chad's, of unrivalled antiquity, beauty, and curiosity. The insertion conjures the spectator to \" Pray for Monsieur John de Charlton, who caused this glazing to be made, and for Dame Hawis his companion.\" Sir John de Charlton married Hawise Gadarn, the heiress of Powis, and died in 1353, before which date this glass must have been executed. In this church, there is an interesting monumental effigy of a cross-legged knight. Tradition says it is the tomb of the cele brated Hotspur, who fell at the battle of Shrewsbury, fought 20th July, 1403. Yet Churchyard 2 informs us that it belonged to one of the Leybournes, formerly lords of Berwick, in the parish of St. Mary. This warrior-like effigy formerly reposed under an arch in the north wall of the south chapel, which chapel in 1447 was called the Leybourne Chappell.

The Fraternity of the Trinity, a species of charitable and pious institution, was existent in the parish of St. Mary in 1336. In 1461, this society was incorporated by King Edward IV, by the name of \"A Fraternity or Gild of the Holy Trinity ofthe men of the mystery of drapers of the town of Salop,\" and the poor of St. Mary's almshouses were to pray for the said fraternity. St. Alkmund's. Alkmund, the last descendant of the Northumbrian line of Ida, appears to have perished in the bloody confusion attendant on the invasion of his country by the fierce heathen Northmen. In con sequence of this his Saxon countrymen had him canonized. St. Alkmund's church is supposed to have been founded by Ethelfleda, Lady of the Mercians before the year 915. Her great great-grandfather bore the name Alkmund ; and this circumstance may have induced the daughter of King Alfred to select the martyred Saxon prince as the patron saint of her new church. Like St. Chad's, this was of a collegiate character. AVe learn from Domesday, that St. Alkmund's held eleven manors in Edward the Confessor's time, and when the survey was taken, this church held in Sciropesberie twenty-one burgesses, besides the twelve houses of its canons ; and two of the one hundred hides, for which the city paid Danegeld. Two of its manors had, however, been wrested from St. Alkmund's after the Conquest. In short, its estate then consisted of 4,020 acres. Of these, the canons held 660 in de mesne, that is, in their own hands, and farming the rest out, they received for it a rent of \u00a38 11s. 8d., or nearly three farthings an acre. But early in the twelfth century, St. Alkmund's prebendal estates went to found Lilleshall Abbey ; and this once opulent college sunk into a vicarage. The old church of St. Alkmund was a large cruciform-shaped fabric, exhibiting a mixed style of architecture. Some parts of it were of Anglo-Norman work, whilst others belonged to the sixteenth century : it had also, a Grecian altar screen, which,"], [251, "193 handsome although it was, yet was quite out of character with the original structure. With the exception of its tower, this venerable fabric was ruth lessly demolished, when the present church was erected upon its ruins. This was opened for divine service on November Sth, 1795. Early Incumbents. \u2014 Sir Godefrid occurs in a deed without date ; Hugh Ive, 1287 ; 1313, 8 non. Jul., AArilliam Pope, chaplain. In 1318, he was admitted a burgess of the town ; and, on the ides of August, 1325, had licence from his diocesan to make a journey to Rome. He resigned this vicarage in 1349. St. Julian's including St. Michael's. That a church dedicated to St. Julian existed at Shrewsbury in the Saxon era is certain, since Domesday informs us, that, previously to the Conquest it had held half a hide of land in the city : and this is about all we know respecting its early history. It was a royal free cliapel, for the Hundred Rolls of 1255 represent it as of the donation of our lord the king : and there were two prebends, one of whom held the chapel of St. Michael in the castle. Re specting the latter, we have described the nature of the tenure by which Lower Poston was held of St. Michael's.1 Besides Poston and Soulton, which it held at Domesday, St. Michael's very early acquired two districts immediately contiguous to Shrewsbury, one of which was called Derfald, a deer-fold, or park for deer : the hunting district attached to the Norman earl's castle. A detached part of St. Julian's parish, now called Darville, before it was stripped of its trees, must, with its shade, pasture, water, and diversified surface, have presented just the conditions necessary for a park of deer. Like St. Julian's, St. Michael's was a royal free chapel. In 1410, Henry IV., in memory of his victory at Shrewsbury, founded the Abbey of Battlefield, and, amongst other things, gave it the royal chapel of St. Michael's in Shrewsbury Castle, with the chapel of St. Julian belonging thereto. St. Michael's stood on the east side of the castle, near the river. Not a vestige of it remains. Old St. Julian's church was an Anglo-Norman structure. The first stone of the present St. Julian's was laid February, 1749. Early Incumbents. \u2014 Peter the clerk appears to have been parish ' See Lower Poston : Index.

The Dominican, Preaching, or Black Friars, as they were called from their dress, very early in the reign of Henry III. built themselves a house in Shrewsbury, which, according to Leland, stood \"a little without the wall, on Severn side, at the end of Marwell Street ;\" probably St. Mary's, AVater Lane. The Franciscan or Grey Friars, also so called from the colour of their dress, must have had a house in Shrewsbury very early in the 13th century. Calling themselves Minorites, to denote their pretended humility, the supposed sanctity of the Friars Minors induced many in their last hours to select them for their con fessors, thus affording the friars an opportunity of which they were not slow to avail themselves to wring from their dying penitents their worldly substance. A portion of this Friary, con verted into houses, still remains. Lastly \u2014 The Austin Friars, or Friars Eremites of St. Austin, noted for their skill in disputation, were established in this town by 1254. Remains of their friary are still to be seen. Yet besides the monastery, parish churches, and friaries we have alluded to, Shrewsbury, in former times, contained the Chapel of St. Nicholas, that Norman structure in Castle Street, built by Earl Roger de Montgomery, for the accommodation of such of his retainers as resided in the outer court of the castle, and St. George's Hospital, situated in Frankwell, near the AVelsh Bridge, not a vestige of which, however, remains. Near to it for merly stood St. John's Hospital, a \" shelter for honest poverty and helpless old age.\" Cadogan's Cross was a preaching station, near to which was a chapel that in 1605 was converted into a pest house. The Chapel of St. Blase was situated somewhere in or near Murivance ; St. Catherine's Chapel, at Coton Hill ; St. Martin's Chapel, of which all we know is, that it was situated on the south side of High Street ; St. Mary Magdalene, and the Chapels of St. Romald and St. AVerberg, respecting the situ ations of which all is conjecture. (PlOltk cll^Oty. Situated in the Hundred of Shrewsbury, in William the Conqueror's time, Melam belonged to the Bishop of Chester, for we read in Domesday that, \" Isdem Episcopus habet"], [253, "195 unum Manerium : Melam. Non est neque suit hospitatus. Red debat xx solidos tempore Regis Edwardi. Modo [red dit] xvii solidos et iiii denarios.\" 1 Bishop Clinton granted the manor in question, \" with the bur gesses, and with all things pertaining to the said land,\" to the monks of Buildwas, and hence Monk-Meole acquired its distinctive name. cJ$U?0ll| Jlljafl?. We read in Domesday that, \" The said Church [of St. Mary, Shrewsbury] held [in Saxon times], and now holds one virgate of land in Melam, the manor of Ralph de Mortemer. The [annual] value [thereof] was and is 4s.\" 2 St. Mary's appears to have lost the estate alluded to, which can not now be identified. From another part of Domesday, we learn that, \" The same Radulf [de Mortemer] holds Melam. Eddid held it [in Saxon times]. Here iii hides geldable. In demesne are iii ox- teams, and [there are] vi serfs, iiii female serfs, vi villains, and iii boors, with in teams, and one radman with half a team.

Now it is worth \u00a313 5s. 6d.\" 3 This manor, then, had once belonged to the Saxon queen, Edith, and Ralph de Mortemer afterwards had obtained it from the Conqueror. Very early in the 13th century, a complicated liti gation took place between Ralph's descendant, Roger de Mortemer, and Audulf de Braci, respecting this manor :\u2014\" Roger de Mor timer seeks against Audulf de Bracy the Manor of Moles, with its appurtenances, as his right, and as a manor whereof his ancestors, from the Conquest of England were seized.\" \"Audulf appears, and denies the plaintiff's right to hold the manor in demesne, but he well acknowledges that the aforesaid Hugh [Roger de Morte mer's father] was once seized thereof in demesne, and that he [Hugh] gave the manor to a certain knight, AVilliam Martel to wit, for his homage and service, which AATUiarn took esplees thereof, as in his own right, for many years; and he [AVilliani 2 Ibidem, fo.252, b2. 3 Ibidem, so. 261, b 1. 1 Domesday, so. 252, a 2."], [254, "196 Martel] afterwards gave it to Audulf de Bracy, the defendant's father, for his homage and service ; which Audulf took esplees thereof, and died seized thereof; and from him the manor de scended to the defendant as his heir. And this [namely, that the land was so given] the defendant offers to try against the plaintiff, as he ought to try it ;\" ' in other words, the defendant offered to decide the matter by a duel. De Bracy named a free man of his own, of the name of Wigan, a low unprincipled bravo and professed duellist, as his champion ; and Mortemer, accepting the challenge, named as his champion his free man, Robert de Brocton. Owing, however, to some treachery on the part of AArilliam de Cantilupe, De Bracy's attorney, there was no occasion for the wager of battle having been proposed. A fine ended a series of cross suits, and Cantilupe, giving to Roger de Mortemer, the man whom he had been employed to oppose, 300 merks of silver, he became mesne lord of this manor, Audulf de Braci holding a moiety of it under him. The distinctive title, Meole Brace originated from this tenure of Audulf de Braci. The Church. The advowson of Meole Bracy church was given, before 1174, by Sir Hugh de Mortemer, to AVigmore Abbey. In 1291, the church of Molebracy, in the deanery of Pontesbury and the diocese of Hereford, or rather the rectory thereof, was worth \u00a312 per annum ; the vicar's jiortion was \u00a35. In 1341, the parish of Moely-Bracy was taxed \u00a35 6s. 8d. to the ninth. King Henry ATIII.'s Valor gives the vicar of Milbrace's preferment as \u00a34 13s. 4d. per annum, less 7s. 4d. for procurations and synodals. The Abbot of AATigmore's rectorial tithes appear to have been over \u00a35. (SNlf ItOlt, as well as Monk Meole, belonged to the Bishop of Chester ; for Domesday says that, \" The same bishop holds Saltone, and the church of St. Chad [holds it] of him.

In the 12th and 13th centuries, Condover sustained a further diminution of its territory. To give the general result in few words : the modern Hundred of Condover contains nothing which was not in the Domesday Condover ; yet, as will be seen by the Table, it has lost eleven manors. In the Anglo-Saxon King Edward's time, two-thirds of the profits of the Hundred-court belonged to the king, as lord of the manor of Condover. At the period of the survey, the whole profits of the Hundred went to Roger de Montgomery, a circumstance illustrative of that Palatine dignity he possessed, which combined the prerogatives of both king and earl. Moreover, the Norman earl appears to have been seigneural lord over forty-six out of the fifty manors of wliich Condover then consisted. Upon the forfeiture of Robert de Belesme, the revenues of Condover Hundred went to make up that \u00a3265 15s. for which the sheriff of Shropshire was annually responsible at the Exchequer. The sheriff, anxious to make as much out of his office as possible, sublet this and other hundreds to various fermors or bailiffs at as high a rent as he could get ; these subordinate officers, in turn, eagerly sought a profit, and the result of the system was much oppressive extortion. In 1292, Roger de Frodesley was chief-bailiff of Condover, that is, he farmed it for the sheriff, who accounted six merks a year to the crown as the proceeds of this Hundred. (I OlUlOUCr. The Celtic word Cond signifies a mouth, as of a river, hence Cound, the extremely ancient village near the mouth of the stream which traverses the Hundred of Condover. The fair haired Saxons came, and finding this village in existence, founded another further up the same stream, to which they gave, by way of distinction, the title of Conedovre, namely, Over or Upper Cound. Domesday says : \u2014 \" The earl himself holds Conendovre. King Edward held it. To this manor appertain ten berewicks. Here xiii hides are subject to geld, in demesne there are vii hides, and"], [259, "201 thereon are iiii ox-teams, and xii villains, and a priest with vii ox teams ; and yet there might be iii other teams here. There are viii neat-herds and a mill of 8s. 6d. [annual value]. \"To this manor [formerly] belonged two [out of every three] pence [arising] from the hundred of Conendoure. In time of King Edward, the manor yielded \u00a310 [annually]. Now, together with the hundred, it yields \u00a310. \" Of the land of this manor, Roger Venator holds i hide, Osbern i hide, and Eluuard iiii hides. Thereon is one team ; and iiii villains, ii boors, iii radmans, and ii neat-herds between them all have iii ox-teams ; and there might be viii additional teams. The whole is worth 41s. [per annum].\" ' From the above extract, we learn, then, that in Saxon times Condover was a royal manor, caput of the hundred to which it gave a name, and that at the period of the survey, Earl Roger de Montgomery retained more than half the manor in his own hands, and was lord of the hundred of Condover. The barons of Pulverbatch, Roger Venator's descendants, re tained an interest in the manor of Condover until the 13th century, but Osbern's and Eluuard's interest had ceased when Henry I. became seized in demesne ofthe whole manor, excepting the tene ment of Roger A^enator. The great Beauclerc visited Condover more than once ; and, as a manor of ancient demesne, Condover came into the hands of his grandson, Henry II. . Ofthe \u00a3265 15s. assessed upon Shropshire, \u00a312 13s. was the ferm which the sheriff accounted for at the Exchequer as arising from the king's manor of Condover ; and the fiscal value of this manor remained unaltered during the reigns of Richard and John. Like Claverley, AVorfield, and other manors of royal demesne, the affairs of Condover were managed by the sheriff ; it was his duty to keep the king's manor well stocked, and doubtless he participated in the profits. Condover was assessable to tallages ; but Henry III., being at Shrewsbury on August 29, 1226, notified to the sheriff of Shropshire that, \" he has committed to his beloved sister Joan, wife of his faithful and beloved Lewellyn, the royal manor of Cunedour, to be held by the said Joan so long as the king shall please :\" hence, for a time, it passed from the sheriff's hands. Lewellyn, prince of North AVales, however, was soon again in arms against his brother-in- 1 Domesday, so. 253, a 2."], [260, "202 law ; border warfare ensued, when, after a number of petty suc cesses on either side, a pacification was concluded. Condover, therefore, was restored to the princess Joan, who had suffered a temporary forfeiture of her manor. By 1231, Condover and Lewellyn's manor of Ellesmere were again seized into the king's hands, as fresh hostdities had broken out between the Welsh prince and his liege lord. Lewellyn devastated the marches, from Brecknockshire to Montgomery. On the other side, the Anglo- Norman king prosecuted the campaign of Elvein with peculiar ferocity. Condover now continued in the hands of Henry III. until the 11th of June, 1238, when the king gave it, with other manors, to Henry de Hastings and Ada his wife, in lieu of Ada's share in the inheritance of her brother, John Scot, the late earl of Chester. Hastings therefore became seigneural lord of the manor, and he transmitted it to his descendants, one of whom gave Condover to Bishop Burnell, in exchange for Woton, Northamptonshire. The inquisition taken in July, 1294, on the death of Philip Burnell, nephew and heir of the bishop, states him to have held the manor of Conedovere in capite, b}' service of finding twelve foot soldiers for the army of AArales.\" ' Condover Church. The collegiate Saxon church of St. Andrew, Condover, indicated in Domesday merely by the mention of a priest, had for its parish originally a district of great extent. We learn, that shortly after the survey, Earl Roger de Montgomery gave to Shrewsbury Abbey the \" Church of Chonedoura,\" with all things appertaining to it. Pope Nicholas' Taxation in 1291, valuing the church of Cone dovere, in the deanery of Salop, at \u00a323 6s. 8d., adds, that the abbot of Shrewsbury received \u00a31 therefrom. In 1341, the parish was taxed only _E16 13s. 4d. to the ninth, because the corn crop was deficient, etc. The Valor of 1534 gives the vicar of Con dover's preferment as \u00a35 13s. 4d., out of which 13s. 4d. went yearly for procurations and 6d. for synodals. The abbot's rectorial tithes, however, amounted to \u00a327 6s. 8d. of which he paid a pen sion of \u00a37 6s. 8d.to the Dean and Chapter of Lichfield, out of Con dover church. Thus the cathedral and the abbey divided the spoil.

From the notice in Domesday, that the \" Church and Priest \" of Berrington belonged to St. Peter's Abbey, Shrewsbury, we may infer that Berrington church was in existence at the period of the survey, if not in Saxon times. We learn also from Earl Roger's charter, that it had been granted to the abbey by AVarin, the first Norman sheriff of Shropshire. In 1291, the church of Byryhton, in Salop deanery, was valued at \u00a3b 9s. 4d., besides a pension of 24s. to Shrewsbury Abbey, and one of no less a sum than \u00a36 13s. 4d. to Lichfield Cathedral.

The whole in time of King Edward was worth \u00a38 [annually] ; afterwards 20s. Now it is worth 64s.\" 2 That the Domesday Lege was identical with the beautifully situated Longnor of the present day, we have the first indication in Azo Bigot's grant to Shrewsbury abbey of half a hide in Lan ganara. This Azo was the same as the Domesday lord of Lege. Another circumstance tending to show that Lege and Longnor are only two different names for the same manor, is the fact, that, like the rest of Azo's tenures under Rainald the sheriff, the manor in question afterwards came to be held by the elder house of le Strange under Fitz Alan. The Sprenghoses, a family who attained to great eminence, held Longnor for more than a hundred and fifty years under the Le Stranges. AAre read of Alric de Longenalra, alias Alric Spren cheaux, attesting one of the prior of AVenlock's charters about 1170. To Alric succeeded Roger Sprencheaux I. who, in 1185, gave with his body (when deceased) the mill of Langenore to Haughmond Abbey. Having served the office of coroner for Shropshire, this Roger was succeeded by a son, alluded to in the Forest Perambulation of 1235, as having had timber from \"the Bosc of AVimbrinton\" ( Womerton), wherewith to fortify his \" House at Langenalre.\" After Roger II. came Roger Sprenghose III., in whose time the house of Sprenghose became connected with the Princes of Powis. Roger lived in stirring times ; yet, following his liege lord, John le Strange III., in the path of loyalty, he drew his sword on behalf of the king, and after the battle of Evesham, Roger was rewarded by a grant of the forfeited lands of Sir Hugh Wrottesley, until they were redeemed under the Dictum de Kenilworth, when Sprenghose got 60 merks for surrendering them. As constable of Montgomery, we find this Roger writing to AValter de Merton, Chancellor of England, to say that he had duly directed certain of his people to attend the abbots of Haugh mond and Dore, on January 20th, 1273, when those commissioners were appointed to go to the Ford, beyond Montgomery, and there 1 The Haia was that enclosed part of haps, means that the fences were in good a wood into which beasts were driven ; repair. and the expression Firm Hayes, per- 3 Domesday, so. 254, b 1."], [266, "206 receive the oath of fealty due from Lewellyn ap Gruffyth, Prince of AVales to King Edward I. ; yet, added the constable, \" The commissioners waited at that ford till long past noon, but Lewellyn neither came nor sent any message.\" ' Sir Roger Sprenghose was sheriff of Shropshire and Stafford shire, from 1279, till May, 1286 ; and he was one of the knights of the shire returned for Shropshire in November, 1295, to the Parliament then held at Westminster. Sir Roger's successor at Longnor was Griffin de la Pole, otherwise Gruffith Vachan, fifth son of Griffin ap Gwenhunin, Prince of Powis, who, in 1310, was lord of this manor. He sold it to Sir Fulk le Strange. There appears to have been several under-tenants in Longnor. Longnor Chapel, as an affiliation of Condover church, belonged to Shrewsbury Abbey ; owing, therefore to this state of subjection, it is not noticed in early records. vUUtlMl was another of Rainald the sheriff's Condover manors. Domesday says of it, that \" The same Rainald holds Cuneet. Earl Morcar held it. Here are 4^ hides geldable. In demesne are ii ox-teams ; and [there are] vi male and iiii female serfs, vi vil lains, and vi boors with iiii teams. Here ii mills of 20s. [annual value], and a wood capable of fattening 50 swine. In time of King Edward, the manor was worth \u00a34 7s. [annually].

Har nage, the remaining hide, by 1291, had fallen into the hands of the monks of Buildwas, who retained it untd the dissolution. Cound Church. The ancient church of Cound appears to have been a Saxon foundation, although the first mention we find of it is in 1216. In 1291, the church of Conede, in the deanery of Salop, with its chapels, was valued at \u00a320 per annum. In 1341, the parish was rated at \u00a316 18s. 6d. to the ninth of wheat, wool, and lamb.

Of knightly degree, this man was pro bably a friend of that AValter Fitz Alan (brother to the seigneural lord of this manor) who, during Stephen's usurpation, became seneschal of Scotland, and eventually ancestor of the royal house of Stuart. Descendants of the Scotch knight for generations after wards continued to be lords over Eaton Mascott. WtOOlritafltOlt. There are two artificial mounds at Wool staston, one ten feet high by thirty-two across its centre ; the other, which adjoins it, has a descent on three sides. Na turally elevated above the adjacent land, this has its height further increased by an artificial raising of six feet, forming a figure in the shape of a parallelogram one hundred paces wide from north to east, and a hundred and fifty-two from north to south. These works resemble rather the remains of a Norman Keep and Baly than a Tumulus. After Rainald the sheriff, Robert Fitz Corbet was the next greatest holder under the earl in Condover Hundred. He held four manors, besides having an interest in Brompton. Domesday alludes to one of his manors thus : \u2014 \" Robert, son of Corbet, holds Ulestanestune under Earl Roger.

The camp is nearly oval. The gorge is at the east. The general height of the vallum seems to have been ten feet, and the work is encircled by one ditch only. There are indications of another camp due south of Castle Ring, between this place and Bilbitch Gutter ; and a British trackway appears to run between these two places, for the purpose of communication between the two posi tions.\" Domesday briefly alludes to this manor in the following terms : \u2014 \" The same Robert holds Rotelingehope. Seuuard held it [in Saxon times]. Here ii hides. Waste they are and were.\"2 Situated in a lonely country, the approach to which, from Church Stretton, across the Longmynd range of hills, is at times, in the winter season, impassable, Ratlinghope had become a priory or cell of AArigmore Abbey by 1209. 1 Salopia Antiqua, p. 87. 1 Domesday, so. :;6, a 1. r"], [272, "210 Ratlinghope Church.

Besides holding the four preceding manors, under Earl Roger de Montgomery, Robert Fitz Corbet held of him also a portion of Brompton. The fact is thus alluded to in Domesday : \u2014 \" Robert holds of the Earl, Brantune. Seuuard held it in [Saxon times]. Here is half a hide. It was and is waste.\" ' From another part of the Conqueror's record, however, we learn that by far the larger portion of Brompton was held by Picot de Say.

Hunine held it, and was free with this land. Here i hide geldable. In demesne is one ox-team, ii serfs, and ii boors. Here is a mill, which will grind in winter but not in summer. In the time of King Edward, the manor was worth 20s. [pet annum] ; now [it is worth] 5s.\"2 There is nothing of special interest attached to the early history of this small manor. Staplus, in low Latin, means a tomb : this points to something sepulchral. We are not surprised, therefore, at learning that some years ago a large Tumulus was opened at Staple ton, Salop. All that was discovered in it was a funeral urn, formed of clay baked in the sun, wliich it was supposed held the ashes ofthe person to whose memory the barrow was raised. AVe read in Domesday Book that : \u2014 \" The same Roger [Fitz Corbet holds] Hundeslit, a manor of one virgate and a half geld able ; and Rannulf holds it of him. Huning held it [in Saxon times], and was free. The land is for i ox-team. Here is one villain. The [manor formerly] was worth 16d.

This divided manor appears to have derived its name from some former Saxon lord, called Huni ; Huning, the patronymic of him who held the manor in Edward the Confessor's time, signifying the son or descendant of Huni. Roger Corbet and his tenant Ranulf, it seems, surrendered their interest here to King Henry I., who, having also acquired the Saxon Alward's share, annexed the whole to the Honour of Mont gomery. Henceforth, therefore, the successive lords of Mont gomery exercised a seigneury over this manor, under whom again it was held by a race of feoffees springing from that Norman Baldwin de Meisy, who, in the reign of Stephen, was lord of Stapleton and AVistanstow. Long after the troubled \"career of the Usurper had drawn to its close, the descendants of Baldwin main tained their position here. The Church. It was in King Stephen's time that Hundesht acquired the name Stepel-tun, owing to a church having been added to the manor. In 1291, the church of Stepelton, in the deanery of Salop, was valued at \u00a34 per annum. In 1341, the parish was rated only \u00a31 16s. 8d. to the ninth, on account of the low state of its cul tivation.

It is supposed, that Roger, the Domesday tenant of Actune, was ancestor of those Burnels from whom afterwards the manor took its distinctive title of Acton Burnell. The first Burnel we hear of is AVilham Burnel, who, previously to 1176, attested one of the Prior of AVenlock's charters. The family then appears as con sisting of two distinct branches, both of whom claimed to have an interest in Acton Burnel. Thomas Burnel was the representative of the supposed elder branch : the Burnels of Acton Burnel and of Langley. Gerin, or AVarin Burnel was the representative of the younger branch. It is with the latter that we have more par ticularly to do. To Gerin Burnel succeeded Hugh his son ; after whom came Gerin Burnel II. , who, with AViUiam Corbet and others, at the instigation of Thomas Corbet, robbed a monk of Buildwas. A list of Thomas Corbet's barony gives AVilliam and this Geryn Burnel as holding one knight's fee in Acton in 1240. AA^iUiam Burnel, here aUuded to, slew two men, for which sen tence of outlawry was pronounced against him, after which the king must have had his share of Acton Burnel for a year and a day, when, in the ordinary course, it would revert to the suzerain, Thomas Corbet of Caus. To Gerin succeeded Roger Burnel, after whom came Robert Burnel, who, purchasing, the fee simple of the whole manor, eventually became sole lord of Acton Burnell. This extraordinary man enjoyed, in a remarkable degree, the favour and confidence of Edward I., and was his chief adviser in all his measures. Early betaking himself to civil and ecclesiastical employments, then generally combined, Burnel soon distinguished himself. AVhile yet a young man, he was introduced to Prince Edward, who, pleased at his address, learning, and ability, made him his chaplain and private secretary. There is proof, that during the baron's wars, Robert Burnel was employed by the prince. It is uncertain whether or not he actually attended Edward to the Holy Land ; but, on June 18, 1272, Prince Edward, 1 Domesday, so. 255, b I."], [276, "214 then at Acre, in Palestine, made a will, in which he appointed Robert Burnel one of his executors. On September 21, 1274, King Edward, now on his father's throne, bestowed the Great Seal on Robert Burnel himself. When appointed to the office of chancellor of England, Burnel had reached no higher ecclesiastical dignity than that of Archdeacon of York. Four months after wards, however, he was raised to the see of Bath and Wells. He presided at the Parliament which met in May 1275, and passed \" the Statute of Westminster the First,\" the code rather than Act of Parliament which has obtained for Edward I. the title of \"the English Justinian.\" \" The chief merit of it,\" says Lord Campbell, \" may safely be ascribed to Lord- Chancellor Burnel, who brought it forward in Parliament. ' O ...... The advice which Burnel tendered his sovereign intimately connects him with the conquest of AArales. After the defeat of Lewellyn, the chancellor was employed to devise measures for the pacification and future government of the conquered principality. He held courts of justice at Bristol, for the southern counties, and, giving general directions for the introduction of English insti tutions among the AVelsh, he prepared a code under which AVales was governed till the reign of Henry VIII. In 1283, to gratify his faithful minister, King Edward sum moned a Parliament, to meet at Acton Burnel, in the mansion of his favourite. Speaking ofthe gable ends shown at Acton Burnell as those of the barn in which, according to tradition, the com mons met, whilst the lords sat in Burnel's mansion, the learned historians of Shrewsbury contend that these did not belong to a barn. They add, \" we have little doubt that they belonged to a great hall erected by the munificent prelate for the entertainment of his sovereign ; and it is in the highest degree probable that the three estates of the realm, the lords spiritual and temporal, and the commons, sat within its walls.\" x Here was passed the admir able statute, \" De Mercatoribus,\" otherwise known as the \" Statute of Acton Burnell,\" for the recovery of debts, \" shewing,\" says Lord Campbell, \" that this subject was as well understood in the time of Chancellor Burnel as in the time of Chancellor Eldon or Chancellor Lyndhurst.\" A patent of January 28, 1284, allows that \" Robert, Bishop of Bath and Wells, our chancellor, may, he or his heirs, strengthen 1 History of Shrewsbury, vol. t. p. 150."], [277, "215 with a wall of stone and lime, and also embattle their mansion of Acton Burnell.\" AATiile Burnel continued in office, the improvement of the law rapidly advanced. Various acts were jiassed, some of which have since become celebrated ; for instance, \" the Statute of Mortmain,\" and the \" Ordinatio pro Statu Hiberni\u00e6\" (17 Ed. I.), for effectually introducing the English law into Ireland, and for the protection of the natives from the rapacity and oppression of the king's officers, \" a statute framed in the spirit of justice and wisdom,\" says Campbell, \"which, if steadily enforced, would have saved Ireland from much suffering, and England from much disgrace.\" Nor was King Edward's favourite a statute-framer only. As head of the law, Burnel exercised a vigilant superintendence over the administration of justice, and in the Parliament held at AVest minster in 1290, the chancellor brought forward very serious charges against the judges, for taking bribes and altering the records, when, with two honourable exceptions, they were all convicted. Lord Chancellor Burnel conducted King Edward L's claim to the superiority over Scotland, and pronounced the sentence by which the crown of that country was disposed of to be held under an English liege lord. He accompanied the martial monarch of England and his powerful army to Norham, and there addressed the Norman derived nobility of Scotland in the French language. The prelates, barons, and knights of Scotland having mustered on the green sward to the left of the Tweed, opposite Norham castle, in pursuance of the leave given them to deliberate in their own country, Burnel went to them in his master's name, and asked them \" whether they would say anj'thing that could or ought to exclude the King of England from the right and ex ercise of the superiority and direct dominion over the kingdom of Scotland, which belonged to him,\" etc., to which the indignant but helpless Scots made no particular objection. Upon this, the chancellor recapitulated all that had been said at the last meeting relative to Edward's claim ; and, a public notary being present, the right of deciding the controversy between the several competitors for the crown of Scotland was entered in form for the King of England. Then Burnel, beginning with Robert Bruce, lord of Annandale, asked him, in the presence of all the bishops, earls, barons, etc., \"whether, in demanding his right, he would answer and receive justice from the King of England as superior and"], [278, "216 direct lord over the kingdom of Scotland ?\" Bruce answered, that \"he did acknowledge the King of England superior and direct lord of the kingdom of Scotland,\" and that he would before him, as such, demand, answer, and receive justice. The same question being put to all the other competitors, each and all of them ob sequiously replied as Bruce had done. Not satisfied, however with having obtained their verbal assent to Edward's ambitious proposal, the crafty English chancellor required the competitors to sign and seal a solemn instrument to the same effect, which they accordingly did, \" quickened by hints thrown out that the candidate who was the most complying would have the best chance of success.\" * One hundred and four Scottish and English commissioners were now appointed to take evidence and hear the arguments of all who were interested. They met at Berwick-upon-Tweed, and Burnel presided over them. King Edward having been obliged to return south to attend the funeral of his mother, left Burnel behind, to watch over the grand con troversy. It was Robert Burnel who gave judgment in favour of Baliol. Lord Chancellor Burnel never returned southward, as he died on October 25, 1292. Summing up the character of this remarkable man, Lord Camp .bell says of him, \"As a statesman and a legislator, he is worthy of the highest commendation. He ably seconded the ambitious pro ject of reducing the whole ofthe British isles to subjection under the crown of England. AVith respect to AVales, he succeeded, and Scotland retained her independance only by the unrivalled gal lantry of her poor and scattered population. His measures for the improvement of Ireland were frustrated by the incurable pride and prejudices of his countrymen. But England continued to enjoy the highest prosperity under the wise laws which he intro duced.\" 2 The inquisition taken after the decease of Robert Burnel shews that the deceased prelate had accumulated a vast possession in Shropshire ; nor had the minutest gains of territory in this his native county been beneath his notice. His tenure of Acton Burnell, under Sir Peter Corbet was by service of half a knight's fee. Philip Burnel, the bishop's nephew, was his heir, who, a spendthrift, among other manors, gave that of Acton Burnell to ' Par!.

Early in the reign of Henry II. , a family were seated here who, deriving a name from the place, afterwards became illustrious. The coronets of de Vere and Mortimer have been borne by the representatives of that house whose humble origin must be sought for in connection with this manor. In the first half of the twelfth century two successive lords of Harley, Edward and Ernulf by name, were concerned in granting easements and pasture in Harley wood to the monks of AVenlock ; one or other of these men was ancestor of the Harleys, and gene alogists labour in vain to prove a higher antiquity for that noble house. To Edward and Ernulf, succeeded Malcolm de Harley, who attested Bishop Novant's famous charter to Buildwas Abbey in 1192. After Malcolm, William became lord of Harley, to whom succeeded Richard de Harley, represented in 1240 as then holding a knight's fee in Harle, of the fief of Cantilupe, lord of Mont gomery. This man became one of the coroners of Shropshire, in which office he died.

The cause for this apparent clemency on the part of the conquerors, can be traced to the cir cumstance that Siward le Gros, the party in question, was, as Ordericus tells us, a kinsman of Earl Roger, whose own great grandmother was a Dane. Indeed, the Normans as a race, sprang from the sea-kings of the north, who, taking from Charles the Simple the northern province of France, at that time called Neu stria, abandoned their heathen habits, and, settling down in the territory they had conquered, founded a mighty state, which was called Normandy, the land of the north-men. Siward transmitted his interest in Frodesley to his son Aldred, after whom the succession cannot be traced. Eventually, this manor was annexed to the fief of Fitz Alan. The Church. Frodesley, included in the churches of Salop deanery and Lich field diocese, in 1291 was valued at \u00a32 per annum. In 1341, the parish was assessed 15s. to the ninth.

As for the terminative batch, it probably derives from the Mercio-Saxon word bach, signifying a bottom or valley. Besides the interest which he. had in Condover and Longnor, Roger Arenator held two manors in the Hundred of Condover, under the Norman Earl of Shrewsbury. One of these is thus alluded to in Domesday : \u2014 \" The same Roger holds Polrebec. Hunnic and Uluiet held it [in Saxon times] for iii manors. Here ii hides geldable.

[annually].\" ' The Conqueror's record shows how greatly diminished in value this manor had become since it had been torn from its Saxon owners. Pulverbatch was once the head of Roger Venator's barony, and here he erected his castle. In 1135, Venator's representative also bore the name Roger ; and genealogists say that this baron was ancestor, through females, of several Shropshire faihilies, the Constantines, of Eaton Constantine and Oldbury ; the Uptons, of Waters Upton ; the Stapletons, of Stapleton and AVistanstow, etc. Roger Venator's representative in the reign of Henry II. was Reginald de Pulverbatch, whose daughter and sole heir, Emma, carried the barony of Pulverbatch to her husband, Herbert de Castello. But Emma and her husband were dead without issue in 1193, when, as the Hereford Pipe Roll informs us, John de Kil peck proferred \u00a3100 for the Barony of Purbech, and obtained it. Of pure Norman descent, this John was great-grandson of that AVilliam Fitz Norman who figures in the Herefordshire Domesday as holding largely under the king. In the province of Arcenefelde he held the manor of Kilpec, hence his name.

Cantilupe, also, had the wardship of John de Kilpec's heir ; whose marriage, however, the king reserved to himself. Meanwhile, Juliana, widow of John de Kilpec, gave to the king 50 merks and a palfrey, that she might have her dower and be permitted to marry any one she chose, save to an enemy of the king, after giving the king due notice of her intention ; but, in 1207, William Fitz Warin taking a fancy to the lady or else her estate, fined a destrier and a good palfrey, that he might have her to wife, when King John sent her a letter urging her, without excuse or delay, to accept Fitz Warin as her husband. She did so, for the king's acknowledgement of the receipt of the destrier is still in existence. Upon obtaining his majority, Hugh de Kilpec II. succeeded to his hereditary office of custos of the royal forests of Herefordshire ; and, in August, 1223, he had letters entitling him to collect the scutage of Montgomery from his tenants in the counties of Salop, Staffordshire, Herefordshire, AVdts, and Gloucestershire. Being about to accompany Henry III. into Brittany, Hugh obtained on April 20th, 1230, a patent of protection during his absence in foreign parts. At Michaelmas, 1235, and again at Easter, 1236, he paid for the honour of Pulverbatch two merks to the aid on marriage of the king's sister. This baron left two daughters to share his inheritance ; the eldest of whom, Isabella, became wife of William AValeraund ; Johanna, the younger, married Philip Marmion ; these doing homage to the king, obtained their respective shares of Kilpec's estates. Pulverbatch, with the advowson of Pulverbatch, now went to Philip and Johanna Marmion, upon whose decease the manor fell to their widowed daughter, Joan de Morteyn. She held the manor in capite as a knight's fee until her death in 1295, when Ralph le Botiler, her nephew, succeeded to Pulverbatch. 1 Rot. Pip., i Rie.

From some cause or other, however, Langley quickly reverted to the suzerain, when, being transformed into a tenure by serjeantry, either Henry I. or Henry II. bestowed it on one of the Burnels, upon condition, that, \" every year the lord of Langley was to convey a goshawk from ,the gate of Shrewsbury castle to Stepney in Essex.\" It does not say who was to provide the bird, which was evidently to go to Stepney for the king's use whilst he sojourned at the royal palace of Havering. Langley with Ruckley now form a township in the parish of Acton Burnell. In 1341, the parish of Rokeley was taxed 16s to the ninth.

From Atcham, it stretched a distance of nearly three miles up to Shrewsbury Abbey Foregate, and, lying thus contiguous to his own foundation, the Norman earl gave this valu able estate to the monks of Shrewsbury. Accordingly, says Domesday, \" The same church [of St. Peter] holds Eiminstre. Earl Eduin held it. Here ix hides geldable.

Here is one villain with i ox-team, and there might be another [team] here. It is worth 3s. [annually].\" l The above must allude to Hughley, which is known to have belonged, from a very early period, to Wenlock Priory. From the 12th to the 16th century, Hughley was held under the prior by feoffees, who derived a surname from this place, which, subse quently to Domesday, was invariably written Lega or Lee. Its tenants, we say, took their surname of Lee from this place. On the contrary, the place, curiously enough, acquiring the Christian name of one of its early lords, Hugh, in process of time became known by its present name : Hughley. The Church. Hughley chapel, founded before 1176, was an affiliation of the church of AVenlock, until the lords of the manor obtained the advowson from the priory. In 1291, the church of Huley, in the deanery of Wenlock, and diocese of Hereford, was of less than \u00a34 annual value. In 1341, Hughley does not appear to have been considered a distinct parish, for it was not assessed to the ninth. In 1534-5, the rector of Hughlye's preferment was worth \u00a34 13s. 8d., less an ancient pension of 2s. to the prior of AVenlock, and 6d. for synodals.

Be this as it may, the abbots continued lords over Betton for some four hundred and fifty years, even until the dissolution. * Xjltlulma.).

Far from grim war's bloody confusion, then, or the turmod of cities, in this secluded spot, the Cistercian brethren reared a sacred fabric, and spent their days in prayer. Meanwhile, their founder, escaping from the internecine war that deluged England with blood, joined the crusade of 1147, and died at Antioch in the following year. Originally, Buddwas was an affiliation of the Norman house of Savigni, which, in turn, acknowledged the rule of the Cistercian Abbot of Citeaux. After the king and bishop, Philip de Belmeis was the next benefactor to this abbey ; he granted Ruckley to \"Saint Mary and Saint Chad,\" of Buildwas. AVdliam Fitz Alan I. was another very early benefactor to Buildwas, for he gave Little Buildwas to the monks : and thus the territorial acqui sitions of the abbey gradually extended. Arery early in the reign of Henry II. the abbot of Savigni com mitted to the abbot of Buddwas the cure and disposition, as it was expressed, of the Savigniac houses of St. Mary's, Dublin, and the Flintshire house of Basingwerk, which accordingly became subject to the abbot of Buildwas. We learn from the Staffordshire Pipe Roll, that, in 1157, the monks of Buildwas were excused their quota of the Danegeld, and of the Donum then assessed on that county. In the following year, they were again excused their quota of the donum then collected in Staffordshire and Shropshire ; and, in 1162, 2s. of the Danegeld of Staffordshire. Among various royal charters of privileges to this abbey, that of Edward I. deserves notice. It aUowed to St. Mary's of Budd was aU lands and tenements already granted thereto, that tie monks should hold not only these but aU lands which they might hereafter acquire, quit of geld, Danegeld, scutage, fines for murder and larceny ; also, of hidage, suits to shire or hundred, military services, sheriffs and all other aids ; also that this church was to be \" free of any amercement set upon the county or hundred, of toU, of passage and of pontage belonging to the king, of all work at castles, bridges, vivaries, walls, or parks, of fencings, of pleas, plaints, and all other customs ; of aU secular service, exaction, and servile work.\" ' This charter is dated September 14, 1290.

In 1535, the abbot of Buildwas declared the total temporalities and spiritualities of his house to be \u00a3129 6s. 10d., but the minister's accounts of the following year make it \u00a330 more. In 1538, Edward Grey, Lord Powis, obtained from Henry VIII. the site of Buildwas Abbey and all its possessions in Shropshire, Staffordshire, and Derbyshire. Ingenulf was the name of the first abbot of Buildwas. The Long Forest involved within its regard nearly the whole of the Domesday Hundred of Condover, besides a number of manors belonging to other Hundreds. Embracing a vast district bounded on the south-east by the mountainous range known as AVenlock Edge, which extends fifteen miles in a direct line north-east ; the Long Forest anciently included aU the country between Wenlock Edge and the Long Mynd and Lyth Hills. The extensive tract aUuded to contains much broken and sterile mountain land, unfitted for the purposes of agriculture. Hence the protracted existence of the Long Forest, which was very slowly disforested. In the Anglo-Norman period, the jurisdiction of the Long Forest was strictly maintained ; and the Forest Roll of 1180, proves that, excepting in the case of a few favoured vills, no concessions in the way of assart or imbladement had been allowed to the inha bitants of the district ; on the contrary, various amercements were inflicted for ivaste. In 1209, however, the regard of the Long Forest shows that indulgencies had been extended to the lords, or inhabitants, of a far greater number of vills within its jurisdiction, these having been suffered to increase the area of their cultivation, or permitted to compound for having so done. From the survey of Shropshire forests in 1235, we learn what were the woods or boses subject to the jurisdiction of the Long Forest ; these were the fragments, if it may be so expressed, of the once great pri meval forest. Lythwood, Bushmoor, and Haycrust were the only three hayes, or royal preserves, kept intact within the Long Forest. In 1250, the jurisdiction of the Long Forest was further relaxed, a sign of advancing civilization ; and this forest continued to be gradually encroached upon, until it was finally broken up in the reign of Edward I."], [308, "238 Domesday Hundred of Patinton.

Under a section, the heading of which is \" QUOD TENET ECCLESIA SANCT\u00c6 MILBURG\u00c6,\" Domesday treats of the possessions of the church of St. Milburg, thus: \u2014 \"Earl Eoger hath made the church of St. Milburg an abbey. The said church holdeth Wenloch, and held it in time of King Edward, Here are xx hides. Of these, iiii hides were free from geld [Danegeld] in time of King Chnut [Canute], and the rest were geldable. In demesne are nine and a half ox-teams ; and ix villains, iii radmans, and xlvi boors have between them all xvii ox-teams ; and other xvii [teams] might be here. Here are xv serfs and ii mills, providing for the monks. Here i fishery. The wood will fatten 300 swine ; therein are ii hayes. In time of King Edward [the manor] was worth \u00a315 [per annum] ; now =\u00a312.\" ' In speaking of this vast manor, a difficulty is experienced in determining what were its Domesday constituents. At no time, however, after the period of King William's survey, is it .alluded to in its original entireness. aaicnlxirk Wenlock priory, the oldest and wealthiest of the religious houses of Shropshire, according to Capgrave, was founded by St. Mdburg. Mdburg was daughter of Merewald, the Christian founder of Leominster priory, and granddaughter of Penda, the pagan King of the Mercians. It is added, that St. Mdburg her self presided over Llan Meilien, which was an older name for this nunnery, and that dying, she was buried here. But the heathen Danes, in their unrelenting hostdity to the faith, left nought of St. Mdburg's church but a charred and blackened ruin, and in this melancholy condition it remained, untd a hundred and fifty years afterwards Leofric, the Mercian earl, attracted to the spot by the veneration still chnging to the memory of St. Milburg, resounded Wenlock. The establishment which this munificent Saxon specially endowed here, partook of the usual character attached to the religious houses of the Saxons, and combined a college for secular clergy, with more or less of the monastic element. As appears from the Domesday notice of its lands, four hides of these, owing to an immunity granted to the church of St. Milburg by the Anglo-Danish King Knut, were not assessable to the Danegeld, for Knut the Great, although the son of an 1 Domesday, so. 252, b I."], [310, "240 apostate to Christianity, displayed great zeal for the church. As we gather also from Domesday, the possessions of St. Milburg, in the time of Edward the Confessor, comprehended 74 hides and a quarter, equivalent to nearly 18,000 acres of that time.1 Upon the forfeiture of Earls Morcar and Edwin, the grandsons of its great restorer, this magnificent Saxon foundation came, almost entirely deserted, into the hands of Roger de Montgomery, when the Norman earl, again restoring it, completely remodeUed the church of St. Mdburg at Wenlock. \"Earl Roger,\" says Domesday, \"hath made the church of St. Milburg an abbey\"; that is, he converted, according to Norman custom, the old Saxon college into a strictly monastic institution. This he did about the year 1080. Wenlock, therefore, was an older house than Shrewsbury, which was not founded until three years afterwards. Thus restored, the territories of St Milburg, at the period of the general survey, were nearly identical with those of Wenlock monastery in the time of Edward the Confessor ; but its value was far otherwise; for whereas, formerly there was arable land sufficient for the employment of 141 J teams of oxen, now, under the Norman, but 80| teams were employed ; a difference, doubtless, attributable to the disturbances of the period. Wenlock monastery was subject to the priory of La Charite in France, to which it paid an annual rent of 100s. \u2014 the priory of La Charite itself being one of the earliest affiliations of the great Benedictine abbey of Clugny, in Burgundy. The 26th of May, 1101 was a day to be had in reverence by the shorn fraternity of Wenlock, for on it St. Milburg's remams, which had been discovered by the ingenious monks, were translated, or removed to their final resting-place, in front of the high altar of the new church. Miraculous were the cures reported ; great the enthusiasm of the multitude. Wenlock had at length acquired the bones of its sainted Saxon foundress, a discovery fraught with pecuniary advantages to the foundation ; accordingly, in gratitude, the brethren made their rents payable upon that' day, and from thence dated their documents. In Henry L's time a question arose, which led the priory to assert that St. Milburg's wide-spreading lands constituted but one parish : that is, were parochially subject to none but the mother church of Wenlock. This spiritual claim, so dlustrative of the ' Our modern statute acre is much smaller than the acre of that period."], [311, "wenlock priory. the chapter-house. (as it stood a.d. 1793). p. 240."], [312, ""], [313, "241 growing influence of Wenlock priory was keenly contested, until, at length, two great synods having deliberated on the question, the claim of the priory was established by Bishop Richard de Belmeis, Viceroy of Shropshire. When the Shropshire Walter Fitz-Alan, steward of Scotland, conceived the idea, in 1163, of founding a Clugniac priory at Paisley, he bethought him of Wenlock Priory ; so, coming to an agreement on the subject with its Prior, thirteen monks from Wenlock accompanied their chief across the border, and colonized the house at Paisley, which, for fifty years afterwards, continued an affiliation of the great Shropshire monastery. Dudley priory was another affiliation of Wenlock, whose prior could place any of his own monks at Dudley, and appoint its prior. The ancient renown of the great Shropshire house also was attested by the circumstance of its possessing a colony in the distant Isle of Wight, the Clugniac priory of St. Helen's. Isabel de Say, baroness of Clun, largely augmented the patron- age of Wenlock by granting to it the church of St. George at Cluu with its seven subject chapels. But it was during the reign of Richard I. that the monks of Wenlock obtained the great aggran- dizement to their house comprehended in that monarch's charter, creative of a new franchise in Shropshire, of which the seigneury was conferred upon the prior of Wenlock. The new liberty, com- posed of manors taken from the old Hundreds of Munslow, Con- dover, and Brimstree, was almost identical with the modern fran- chise of Wenlock. It is not known what induced the lion-hearted to grant to St. Milburg's freedom from \" sac, soc, toll, team, and infangethef,\" with other franchises belonging to the crown, and a total exemption from all obligation to do suit at other Hundred Courts, or even at the greater court of the county ; it is not known, we say, what was the Anglo-Norman king's motive for conferring on the new franchise such extensive privileges. Richard's charters relating to the subject are dated Roche Andeley, in Normandy, from the keep of Chateau-Galliard, that renowned fortress, then just erected, concerning which, when he had com- pleted the whole system of its enormous works and defences, the delighted Richard with pride exclaimed, \" Is she not fair, my daughter of a year ?\" ' It is not improbable, therefore, that Richard granted these privileges in return for some large subsidy 1 Brompton, Hist.Angl. Scriplores Antiqui, col. 1276. R"], [314, "242 the prior had granted to the warlike monarch, in furtherance of his engineering chef-d'\u0153uvre on the banks of the Seine. On the 29th of August, 1226, Henry III. halted at Wenlock, on his way from Shrewsbury to Brug. That king stayed at this priory several times afterwards : on one occasion, namely June 7, 1233, receiving in his wardrobe at AVenlock a sum of \u00a3106, being an instalment of the tax of the fortieth assessed in the previous year on Staffordshire, from which tax, however, the lands of the prior of Wenlock were exempt. Yet heavy was the hand of Geoffrey de Langley, the justiciar, upon Imbert, the able prior of Wenlock, for, in his Iter of 1250, he mulcted Wenlock in extraordinary penalties. The prior, it would seem, had been assarting forest lands in all directions, with out licence, for which the severe justiciar not only fined him in the large sum of \u00a3126 13s. 4d., but subjected him to future rent charges. In 1252, the good prior of Wenlock owed \u00a36 for two purchases he had made of the king's wines. The hberty of Wenlock was the subject of a separate return in 1255, when its constituent manors, stated to be held under the prior, were said to owe suit to his court only.1 One of the commission appointed to treat with Llewellyn, Im bert, prior of Wenlock, was a party to the formal pacification agreed on between the Welsh prince and the English king, at Montgomery, on Sunday, August 22nd, 1260 ; but, shortly after wards dying, the royal escheator, contrary to precedent, seized into the king's hand the estates of the priory. So extortionate was the rigour with which this functionary executed his office, that the granges, vivaries, woods, and parks of the priory were damaged to the extent of upwards of 10 merks ; 20 merks also were wrenched from St. Mdburg's tenants, and at length the sub-prior and convent were forced to hand over to the escheator 100 merks before they coidd participate in any of its profits during the vacancy. But this did not last long, for, on April 8, 1261, King Henry III. en joined his escheator, Geoffrey de Northampton, custos of the priory, to give seizin thereof to Aymo de Montibus, formerly prior of Bermondsey, whom the king had admitted prior of Wenlock, on presentation of the prior of La Charite, when Wenlock recovered from the oppressions it had been subjected to by the king's justiciar 1 Rot. Hundred, ii. pp. 84\u201486."], [315, "243 and escheator. Upon the death of prior Aymo, in 1272, Wenlock was again seized by the crown ; yet not in the former harsh manner, a fine of 100 merks procuring for the convent custody of its house and lands during the vacancy, a vacancy filled up in the following year. As we learn from the inquest of 1274, Wenlock priory had gallows, and assize of bread and beer within its liberty ; and when, in 1283, a writ of King Edward I. exempted Cistercian houses from the tax of the thirtieth then collecting, Wenlock Priory was one of the very few Houses not of that order which had a similar reprieve. In short, contributing very rarely to the King of England's exchequer, and but moderately assessed in respect to its subjection to the foreign house of La Charite, Wenlock long continued to flourish ; its possessions gradually increased, and the prudence and sobriety of its Clugniac inmates steadily told upon their finances. Indeed, we may infer, from the extraordinary charter of privileges held by this priory, that every acre that belonged to it became doubly valuable, the tenants who held of this House being all privileged men. According to Pope Nicholas' Taxation, the temporalities of Wenlock, in 1291, realised an income of over \u00a3144 per annum, of which \u00a319 9s. 4d. arose from profits on farming stock. Its advowsons were worth \u00a3130 per annum, and it also had an income of \u00a36 or \u00a37 arising from various church pensions and portions. When in 1333, the prior of Wenlock contributed 10 merks to the aid on marriage of the sister of King Edward III., only nine Enghsh monasteries contributed a greater amount. In less than four years afterwards, however, the English monarch, anticipating war with France, forbade Wenlock and other alien priories to transmit any revenue to the foreign houses of which they were affiliations ; and when the war broke out Edward seized upon Wenlock, and appropriated to his own requirements the 100s. annually paid by the priory in Shropshire to the House of La Charite in France. Wenlock was one of the twenty-one Enghsh priories threatened in 1343 with utter confiscation, if, upon any pretext, they sent money to a foreign superior.\" ' In consideration of 600 merks, which this convent paid to 1 Claus. 17 Ed.

Times had become altered : the Enghsh kings no longer had foreign interests to care for. Yet nearly a century elapsed ere this separation was recognized either by the parent monastery or the pope. In 1534-5 the temporalities of Wenlock, valued at \u00a3333 16s. 10s, and the spiritualities at \u00a3100 4s. 4d., gave a total of \u00a3434 Is. 2|. Upon January 26, 1540, this religious house surrendered to Henry VIII., when the prior and convent were pensioned off upon \u00a3100 a year, divided between them. Of this sum the prior received \u00a330, the sub-prior and eleven monks sharing the remainder. Among Early Priors of Wenlock, Peter occurs first in 1120 : to whom succeeded Rainald, prior of Wenlock, 1138 \u2014 1150. Attend ing the council at Rheims, in 1148, in company with his friend, Robert de Bethun, bishop of Hereford, he waited on that prelate when he died there. To Rainald, accordingly, Wdliam of Wy cumbe appropriately addressed his life of the bishop.1 Humbald, 1155 \u2014 1170 : it was he who colonized the Scottish monastery of Paisley. To him succeeded Peter de Leia, who, in 1176, was pro moted to the see of St. David's. The Borough of Much Wenlock. \u2014 \" The corporate towns of the 13th century,\" says Eyton, \" were of three principal classes, viz., those which were held by royal charter, those which had arisen under sufferance of some feudal chief, and those which were of the patronage of the Church, that is, in corporated by the lords of a spiritual fief. Shropshire affords instances of each class. Shrewsbury and Bridgnorth were of the first ; Oswestry and Ludlow of the second ; Wenlock and the Abbey Foregate of Shrewsbury belonged to the third.\" Where now stands the corporate, market, and parliamentary town of Much Wenlock, in the time of the Conqueror existed a purely agricultural district. The town, however, gradually sprang up, under the auspices of the priory, when, at length, owing to suc cessive concessions of the priory, its burgesses acquired a corporate government. The first mention of a provost of Wenlock is in the year 1267, about which period it is probable, that the borough of Wenlock began to be governed by a corporate body. 1 Anglia Sacra, vol. ii. pp. 296 \u2014 318."], [317, "WENLOCK PRIORY, SOUTH SIDE OF CHAPTER-HOUSE.

The old Saxon parish of St. Milburg, of vast extent, involved, yet was immeasurably greater than, the Norman parish of the Holy Trinity that succeeded it. Again, the ancient parish of the Holy Trinity comprehended not only the modern parish of Much Wen lock, but eleven other places, in all of which there are now separate churches or chapels. Burton is the only one of these places within the modern parish of Much Wenlock. The church of the Holy Trinity, Wenlock parish church, was founded shortly after Domesday. It was originally a rectory in the gift of the prior and convent, when William de Vere, Bishop of Hereford, in 1186-1199, granting it to the priory, the church of the Holy Trinity became a vicarage. Pope Nicholas' Taxation values the church of Wenlock at \u00a334 13s. 4d. per annum. It is not clear what was the precise extent of that parish of Wenlock assessed to the ninth. Yet, whatever its extent, it was assessed only \u00a316, because, owing to tempests, the corn-lands had been unfruitful, there had been a murrain among the sheep, etc. The Valor of 1534-5 gives a total of \u00a335 4s. as the prior's rectorial income from the parish of the Holy Trinity. The vicarial income of Wenlock was \u00a313 3s. 4d., of which 13s. 8d. went for procurations and synodals. Early Incumbent. \u2014 Hervey occurs as vicar of Wenlock before 1238. Bradley, formerly West Bradley near Burton, Benthall, Barrow, The Marsh Manor one of the prior's principal Granges, with Atterley and Wenlock Walton, Bradley near Broseley formerly Bradley Grange, with its adjuncts Wyke, Far ley, Posenthal, Calloughton, and the vill of Prestenden which cannot now be identified, were all included in the 20 hides alluded to in Domesday as attached to the church of St. Milburg. Held under the prior by tenants of various rank and importance, these constituted so many distinct estates, members of the vast fief of the church of Wenlock. Contiguous to Wenlock, in former times, existed the forest of Shirlot. Compared with that of Mors, Shirlot Haye exercised not nearly so wide a regard or jurisdiction, yet this pervaded a district the length of which has been estimated at twelve miles, and its breadth at five. It is difficult to define the boundaries of"], [320, "246 Shirlot forest and its adjuncts, which lay generally to the west ward of the Severn. Suffice it to observe, that, the district in question was in close proximity to Morville and Chetton, manors where Saxon kings and Mercian earls once dispensed a rude, yet unbounded, hospitality : it was characteristic of the Norman earls who succeeded to their vacant seats, to reserve to themselves the right of hunting and fishing ; finally, as after the forfeiture of de Belesme, the Ang-lo-Norman kings themselves visited their own castle of Brug, and frequented, as guests, Wenlock priory ; it evidently was the interest of each of these parties to maintain Shirlot forest intact. Quite a number of \" vills and boses per taining to the Haye of Schirlet \" were disforested in the time of King Edward I., whose policy in respect to royal forests, by the way, was much more liberal than that of his Anglo-Norman pre decessors.

It was Tichel's loorthing, or village, from whence the transition to the more modern termination of ton or town is natural. Eaton-under-Heywood, originally merely one of its members, very early became the caput or centre of this manor, which was held chiefly in demesne by Wenlock priory. Hence, in 1255, the jurors of Wenlock liberty returned \" Eton, with its appurtenances, as the manor of the lord prior.\" And a very pretty picking did the lord prior of Wenlock get out of Eaton and its appurtenances. These were Herton (now Harton), Tycleworthin, Longefewd, (Longville), Lussekote (Lushcote), Wolverton, and Hatton ; the rents and ferms of the prior's manor of Eton being valued in ] 541-2 at \u00a330 9s. 4d. ; perquisites of court \u00a31 3s. 6d. more ; to say nothing of that large additional income which the prior received in the shape of eggs, Domesday \\ so. 252, b 1."], [321, "247 poultry, fish, venison, for the kitchen of the priory, and labour dues, concerning the latter of which we have a sample, under date 1237, when \" Imbert, prior of Wenlock, demanded that Robert de Hatton should provide ten men for one day in autumn, to carry the prior's hay at the said men's own cost.\" Church of Eaton-under-Heywood. Eaton church, contemporaneously with Wenlock church, was granted as an appropriation to Wenlock priory by William de Vere, Bishop of Hereford ; his reason for so doing being the ex cessive hospitality which he knew to be exercised by the monks. About 1225, however, the prior's right to Eaton was disputed, when Bishop Foliot, for reasons best known to himself, specially devoted Eaton church to the better provision of the monk's kitchen, saving the due maintenance of a vicar there. In 1290, Bishop Swinfield visited Etone, when the prior of Wenlock found forage for 36 horses of the prelate's train. Pope Nicholas' Taxation valued the church of Etone at \u00a310, and its vicarage at \u00a34 6s. 8d. The parish of Eton Priors was assessed \u00a36 8d. 4d. to the ninth in 1341. The Valor of 1534-5 returning the rectorial corn- tithes of Eton as among the spirit ualities of Wenlock priory, gives them as worth \u00a38 15s. 4d. per annum : the vicarage \u00a35, upon which 7s. 8d. was charged for pro curations and synodals. Early Incumbent. \u2014 Sir Osbert, called Godman the priest, 1289. JjJ.UlnCIf was another of the church of Wenlock's possessions. Domesday notices the manor thus : \u2014 \" The same church holds Madehe, and held it in time of King Edward. Here is i hide not geldable, and iii other hides geldable. In demesne are ii ox teams, and vi villains and iiii boors with iiii teams. Here iiii serfs ; and there might be vi other teams here besides. There is wood enough to fatten 400 swine.

The British lie signifies a place, the Saxon leas a district, whilst the Macs-brook, wliich takes its rise in this place, contributed to form the name Madeley. The etymology of stream and district, perhaps, are found in M\u00e6b, the Saxon for mead or meadow. Domesday, so. 252, b"], [322, "248 Respecting Madeley and its member Coalbrookdale, we read that, in 1322, Walter de Caldebrook fined 6s. to the prior as lord of the manor, to be allowed to have a man, for a year, to dig sea coal in Le Brocholes. The mineral treasures of this district were as yet, however, but slightly recognized. Madeley Church. This was taxed 12 merks in 1291. In 1341, the parish was assessed \u00a32 16s. to the ninth ; the causes of the low assessment being great storms, want of sheep stock, the surrender of six' tenants, etc. In 1343, Madeley church was granted as an appro priation to Wenlock priory, when it became a vicarage. In 1534-5, under the head of portions receivable from certain vills, the rec torial tithes of Madeley appear as \u00a32. The vicar's income was \u00a35 5s., less 7s. 2d. for procurations and synodals. Early Incumbent. \u2014 Richard de Castillion was rector of Madeley in 1267. JRftlC is easily distinguishable from Much Wen lock in the Conqueror's survey, by the comparative smallness of its extent.

These were held under Wenlock by three kinds of acknowledgments, ordinary rent ; a rent called wood-silver, which varied from 9d. to 4d. per tenure ; and rent of fowls in kind \u2014 generally one or two to each holding. The totals were, ordinary rents, \u00a314 16s. S^d. ; wood-sdver, 8s. 5d. ; fowls, twenty four. The receipts from Wenlock Parva and Huntington, includ ing ferm of coal mines, in 1541-2, amounted to \u00a323 15s. 5d. Little Wenlock Church and Parish. From the circumstance, that the parishes of Badger, Beckbury, 1 Aira accipitris. * Domesday, so. 252, b I."], [323, "249 Madeley, and Little AVenlock are included in the diocese of Here ford, the boundary of which in this quarter is very irregular, it is supposed, that the boundary of St. Milburg's lands determined that of the diocese. This is very hkely, since the see of Hereford was founded a.d. 676, an era coeval with that of the sainted Saxon foundress of AVenlock. Little AVenlock is a rectory to this day, it not having been subjected to appropriation by the priors. In 1291, it was returned at \u00a34 6s. 8d. In 1341, the parish was assessed only \u00a31 12s. to the ninth ; because the crops had been destroyed by the weather, there were no sheep, and much land lay uncultivated, and because the small tithes, etc., were not reckoned in estimating the ninth. In 1534-5, this preferment was valued at \u00a311 10s., of which 2s. 2d. went for procurations and synodals, and a pension of \u00a31 to the prior of AVenlock. Early Rector. \u2014 Peter de Langon, a Burgundian ; Peter de Aquablanca, Bishop of Hereford, also a Burgundian, being patron, although how he came to be so does not appear. This alien bishop dying, John le Breton, his successor, in 1269 ousted Langon from Little Wenlock, when Langon instituted proceedings in the papal court against his diocesan. The suit dragged its slow and tortuous existence through the expensive Roman chancery until, in 1290, more than twenty years afterwards, sentence was given in the Pope's Palace at Orvieto, for the restoration of Langon to all his preferments. This brief notice of an alien rector of Little AVenlock, recalls to memory not only the period when English disputes were accus tomed to be carried for decision to the foreign and corrupt papal court of Rome ; but it reveals to us that unendurable condition of affairs which, when Henry the Third was king, led our ancestors in bitterness to exclaim, that \" the natives of the country were as dirt in the sight of the foreigners.\" In the Parliament held in London in 1258, in reply to the urgent demand of Henry III. for pecuniary assistance, the Anglo-Norman nobles flatly told the king that they neither could nor would any longer submit to his mis rule. Long enough England had groaned under it, said they. Resuscitating, therefore, the celebrated league of former years, the guardians of the Great Charter once more extended to each other their mailed hands, and swore upon the Holy Gospels, that they would reform the kingdom, and, upon pain of losing their lands, purge the country of its alien enemies and disturbers.

In 1341, the parish was assessed only \u00a32 5s. to the ninth, because the corn was in great part destroyed ; there were no sheep here ; a third of the land lay unfilled from inability of the tenants, on account of poverty, etc. In 1534-5, the prior of AVenlock received corn tithes to the value of \u00a35 6s. 8d. per annum fi-om Shipton, and a portion of \u00a31 6s. 8d. from the vills of Larden and Brockton, whilst the unendowed chapel of Shipton is not even mentioned.

Nevertheless, in time, Burton passed wholly into the demesne of the foreignised monks of AVenlock, the locality being selected for holding the Hundred Courts of their franchise. These consisted of the greater and lesser Hundred Courts, the former of which were held twice a year, the latter every three weeks ; and numerous are the instances in which manors belonging to AVenlock liberty are said to owe suit to the greater or lesser Hundred Courts of Burton. j=?tolt\u00a3| S$t JJl.ItlUl(0. The Saxon word Scdc signifies an inhabited place or vdlage. Stoke St. Milburg was formerly called God-Stoke from its connection with St. Milburg, who it appears had lands here which she often visited. \" Stokes,\" therefore, became the scene of many of those miracles which its saintly Saxon proprietress was said to be in the habit of perform ing ; and for centuries afterwards St. Milburg's fields were believed to be supernaturally defended from the depredations of the wild fowl which infested the lands of her neighbours. The beauty of Milburg attracted many suitors, but she made a vow of chastity, and rejected them all. Once upon a time, one of her suitors, who was the son of a king (a Welsh one, probably) , determined to carry off Milburg by force, and he planned to sur prise her while she was on a visit to Stoke. St. Milburg, however, was informed of her danger, and in haste fled towards Wenlock. Her royal lover closely pursued, until the Saxon saint, having reached the Corve, which at that particular spot was a mere streamlet, no sooner had the fair one leaped over the rivulet than suddenly it swelled into a torrent, and thus the designs of her enamoured pursuer were baffled. This extensive manor is thus alluded to in AAhlliam the Con queror's survey :\u2014\" The same church held Godestoch [in Saxon Domesday, so. 252, b 2."], [326, "252 times].

Now \u00a39.\" l Stoke St. Milburg appears to have reverted to AVenlock priory as the earl's chaplains died off, when the early priors of AVenlock retained the bulk of the manor, partly in demesne, but chiefly leased out to life tenants. According to Pope Nicholas' Taxation, in 1291, the prior of AAenlock's interest in this manor consisted of six carucates of land [held in demesne, \u00a34] ; four acres of meadow, 8s. ; assized rents, \u00a39 6s. 8d. ; tallage, \u00a36 13s. 4d. ; pleas, perquisites [of Court], and labour dues, \u00a31 6s. 8d. ; total, \u00a321 14s. 8d. The AVenlock fine-roll of 1321-2 contains many entries relating to Stoke St. Milburg ; we give the following : \u2014 \" Stok, October 13th, 1321. The tenants of the manor fine 6s. 8d. with the lord [the prior] , that he will commute a certain rent of geese, hitherto payable by them in kind, for a rent in money, viz., at the rate of 3d. per goose.\" On the same day, \" two tenants give the lord twelve pullets for license to convey the one to the other some meadow land near St. Milburg's Cross.\" . \" Stok, April 19, 1322, a tenant fines for licence to marry.\" \" Stok, July 6, 1322.

From time immemorial, a church has existed here. Its parish included the manor of Stoke, and also that of Clee Stanton. In 1291, the rectory was valued at \u00a310 13s. 4d. per annum, besides a portion of \u00a33 which the prior of AVenlock derived therefrom. In 1341, the parish was assessed only \u00a34 10s. to the ninth, because the wheat had been destroyed by dreadful storms, there were no sheep, eleven tenants had quitted, etc. Soon afterwards, this church became subject to an appropriation by the prior of Wen lock.

The Domesday manor of Godestoch included Stoke, the Moor, Clee-Downton, Newtown, Bockleton, Kinson, Norncott, and the Heath. The architectural remains of the Heath chapel bespeak its an tiquity. Founded probably by some pious layman, yet parochially subject to the church of Stoke St. Mdburg, no record even mentions this chapel during the first four centuries of its existence. Hence we may infer, that its altar was unserved during the greater por tion of this long period ; for, jealous of the temporal interests of their church as they were, yet, httle, we fear, in a general way, did the rich lord abbots and priors of old concern themselves about the souls of the people around them. \u25a0$)ttt01t PriOl'S, held in demesne by the Norman Earl of Shrewsbury, was probably exempt from external jurisdiction, at the period of the survey. Hence its Hundred is not specified in the Conqueror's record. Ruthall, in the same parish, however, is described in Domesday as a Patinton manor. Ditton Priors, then called Dudinton from the Saxon Dubbinj tun, namely, the town of Dudding, is thus described in Domes clay : \u2014 \" The Earl himself holds Dodintone. [Formerly] Earl Eduin held it, with iiii berewicks. Here xii hides geldable.

Upon the forfeiture of Robert de Belesme, Ditton fell into the hands of Henry I., who granted Ashfield, one of its bere wicks alono- with other lands, to the ancestor of the Beysins, to be held in capite of the king, by service of keeping the king's hawks. Unshorn of any of its other members, Henry II. succeeded to Domesday, so. 253, b 2."], [330, "254 Ditton, when that king granted it, with Corfham and Culmington, to Hugh de Periers. That this Norman had drawn his sword on behalf of legitimacy against the usurper Stephen appears evident, from his attesting a charter of the Duke of Normandy, which passed at Coventry in 1153, the very year in which the successful campaign of the young duke in the midland counties took place, when, \" after a night of misery, peace dawned on the ruined realm of England.\" His service in the cause of royalty may also be in ferred from the circumstance, that within the first year of his reign Henry II. gave De Periers these manors. AVe are informed by the Pipe Roll, that Hugh's interest in Ditton Priors ceased at Christmas, 1175, shortly after which the monks of Wenlock acquired the whole of the manor. It would seem that De Periers, feeling his end drawing nigh, surrendered himself, according to the superstitious practice of that age, to the monks of Wenlock. He wished to die a member of their fraternity, and be buried within their walls. On this account, he gave them his manor of Ditton, subject to conditions which secured from the priory the same tenant-rights for his men as they had formerly enjoyed when holding under himself. Agreeably to which the \" verdict of the Liberty of AVenlock,\" in 1255, states the prior to be lord of the manor of Dodinton, and that it was once a king's manor ; that King Henry gave it to Hugh de Peres, and he gave it to the priory.1 Church of Ditton Priors. The right to this advowson, about 1196, was contested between the Dean of Brug and the prior of Wenlock, when the pope's arbitrators decided that Ditton church should remain with the priory ; but the dean and his successors were to receive an annual acknowledgment of two pieces of gold at Michaelmas from the priory. The church of Dodyton, in Stottesden deanery, in 1291, was valued at \u00a312, besides a portion for the vicar of \u00a34 6s. 8d. In 1341, this parish was assessed only \u00a35 4s. to the ninth, on account of storms, absence of sheep stock, and the surrender of nine im poverished tenants, etc. In the Valor of 1534-5, Ditton Priors vicarage is stated to be worth \u00a36 13s. 4d., less 10s. to the prior, and 7s. 8d. for procurations and synodals.

He, in Saxon, signifies an oak tree, tun, a town, and hence derive all Actons. AVith respect to the terminal, Round, by which this place is distinguished, its etymology is not so certain. Sir Thomas Boteler, vicar of Much AVenlock, about the middle ofthe 16th century, says, that, \"the chapell of Acton Round was sometyme round, hke a temple.\" Now it is certain, that the Templars were introduced into Shropshire by the Fitz- Alans, lords of Acton Round ; they are known to have built round churches ; it is not improbable, that the form of the chapel in question was suggested by some contemporary building of the Templars at Lidley ; and hence it may be the etymology of Acton Round. Rainald, the Norman sheriff of Shropshire, held, under the Earl of Shrewsbury, no less than eight manors in Patinton Hundred. Acton, one of these, is thus noticed in Domesday Book : \u2014 \" The same Rainald holds of the Earl, Achetune. Here iiii hides geld able. Uluiet held it, and was free, with this land. In demesne are ii ox-teams ; and vii serfs, ix villains, and iiii boors with iiii teams ; and there might be iii teams more besides. Here is a mdl of 32d. [annual value].

Rainald and his successors, the Fitz-Alans, continued to hold this manor, principahy in demesne, that is, as lords of the manor, they kept the greater portion of the land in their own hands ; yet they enfeoffed vassals in a part of it. Muckley, Upper Monk-Hall, and Lower Monk-Hall, were members of this manor. By 1496, Wenlock priory had acquired an interest in the former ; and, if their titles do not mislead, the shaven crowned brethren had also something to do with both of the latter. Church or Chapel of Acton Round. The chapel of \"Acton Rotunda \" was granted as an affiliation to AVenlock priory, by Bishop Swinfield, in 1284, simply because it was constructed on St. Milburg's land. Hence its occupant was deprived, and the future chaplains had to pay a pension of 2s. per annum to the mother church. As belonging to the prior of AATenlock, and in the deanery of Wenlock, Acton Round Chapel, in 1291, was valued at \u00a36 13s. 4d per annum.

The Titterstone mountain, near Abdon, doubtless originally derived its name from the Icelandic Titra, which sig nifies to tremble ; and Hartshorne, by a personal investigation, proved that there existed on this eminence a rocking stone. Abdon Burs is 1805 feet above the level of the sea at low water. Upon its summit are indications of upwards of forty circles of stone, enclosed within a huge vallum of basalt or du stone. The enclosed area is of an oval form, and measures 1317 feet from north to south, and 660 feet from east to west. Geologists fail to account satisfactorily for the appearances on Abdon Burs and the two other Clee Hdls, namely, Clee Burs and the Titterstone ; the summits of both of which, likewise, appear to have been surrounded with a vallum of stones, within which, again, are numbers of smaller circles. It has been conjectured, that these are artificial enclosures, which, at some period of remote antiquity, were devoted to idola trous or Druidical purposes : purposes, probably, partly devotional, partly sepulchral. It may have been, that Abdon Burs was one of those condemned high places set apart, in ancient times, for the mysterious worship of Baal, or the sun. Leland says, \" Cie Hills be holy in Shropshire ;\" ' and if it be true, that Abdon Burs and its neighbour eminences are vast monuments of an extinct hill worship, then the tradition acquires a remarkable significance. Betwixt Abdon Burs and the village of Clee St. Margaret is the Roman station, Nordy Bank, one of the most perfect remains in the kingdom of the Roman period. In shape, it is a parallelo gram, the angles rounded. A fosse, twelve feet wide, surrounds the whole. The vallum is twenty-six feet wide at its base, and six across its crest. The interior slope is twelve feet, the scarp eighteen, and the counterscarp, six. There arc four gorges or 1 Itinerary, vol. viii so. 89 b."], [333, "257 openings due north, the original ones being at the east and west. This important station gave the Roman general not only the com mand of Corve Dale, but it commanded also the valley on the southern side of the Burs. As it has already been pointed out by the great authority on matters relating to the earthworks and ante- Norman fortresses of Shropshire and the AVelsh border ; ' the ex istence of this very perfect Roman work immediately below Abdon Burs proves, that the enclosure on its summit was a religious, not a defensive one, since the Roman general would hardly have pitched his camp in a position which the Britons could have assaulted with so much advantage. Abdon is described in AVilliam the Conqueror's record as fol lows : \u2014 \"The same Rainald [the sheriff] holds Abetune [of the earl], and Azo [holds it] of him. Uluuinheld it [in Saxon times], and was free with this land. Here iii hides geldable. Here i ox team and iii serfs, one Frenchman, ii villains, one radman, and ii boors with i team ; and still there might be iii more teams [employed]. [In time of King Edward] it was worth 20s. [annually]. Now 12s.\" 2 Azo, the Domesday sub-tenant of this manor, held other lands in the fief of Rainald the sheriff. Under his Norman name, Azo Bigot, he granted lands in Abeton to Salop Abbey, before 1136, for untd so long after the survey did Azo continue lord of this manor. Azo's wife also, for the soul of Rainald her son, granted land to the monks in the town of Shrewsbury, which yielded them lOd. annually. Robert, the knight, another son of Azo, was also a benefactor to the Church, concerning whose gift we read that the seigneural lord, \" William Fitz-Alan, conceded the donation which Robert his knight made to the church of St. Peter at Salop, of the vill which is called Abbeton, which was of his (Fitz-Alan's) fee ; and this was at the request of the same Robert. But for this concession, which with his own hand he (Fitz-Alan) placed upon the altar, the monks conceded to him, for the soul of his mother who was lately deceased, one annual service ; and out of the slender means of their church, they gave him fifteen merks of silver and one palfrey. AVitnesses : Roger, archdeacon ; Richard and Heming, priests ; and many others of the men of the same AVilliam. \u2014 But when the same Robert, his lord allowing it, offered the said vill upon the altar of St. Peter, Richard, his nephew, 1 Hartshorne, Salopia Antiqua, p. 151.

In 1291, this church was returned as worth under \u00a34. The parish was rated only 11s. to the ninth, in 1341, non cultivation of the land, owing to poverty of the tenants, being the reason alleged.

Something like this is but too often indicated, when the term \" wasta suit \" is made use of in the Conqueror's survey. Of Aluric, its Saxon proprietor, it follows, that nothing further is heard. Odo de Bernieres, his Norman successor, was founder of the family of Fitz Odo. Holding other manors besides Stan way, Odo was a chief among the knights of Shropshire. The vills Upper Stanway, Lower Stanway, and Stone Acton, the bulk of the Domesday manor of Stanweie, passed in time from Odo's descendants to Herbert de Rushbury, who gave \" the whole of the land of the two Staneweys, with all their appurtenances,\" to Henry de Audley, about 1225. He again quitted aU his right in Stanway to Madoc de Sutton. Madoc, therefore, became mesne tenant at Stanway, holding it under Fitz Alan, a member of whose barony this manor continued to be. Stanway and Stone Acton are now in the parish of Rushbury. (!i)l'll|tt01T. Domesday thus describes this manor : \u2014 \" The same Rainald, with one Robert, holds Grotintune of the earl. Odo holds it of them. Alric and Otro held it [in Saxon times] for ii manors. Here ii hides geldable. Those thanes [Alric and Otro] were free. Here are v villains with ii ox-teams, and there might be other two teams here. In time of King Edward, the manor was worth 32s. ; now it is worth 10s. When they [namely Rainald and Robert] received it, it was waste.\" ' Here we have another case of waste. The fields they loved to cultivate, and those well -stocked Saxon homesteads, around which their wives and blue-eyed httle ones had fondly clung, were devastated and burnt by the ruthless oppressor ; and the free thanes Alric and Otro, if they perished not in the vain attempt to shield all that was dearest to them, at least had been driven from the estate which had been their father's. Odo, the Norman tenant of two different mesne-lords, appears to have par tially recovered this ruined manor, for, at the period of the survey it was worth 10s. : yet, how great the difference to its value in Saxon times.

The other moiety, namely, that hide which Odo held under the Norman mesne-lord Robert, had a various history. Upon the forfeiture of the Norman earls, of course Robert's tenure became a tenure in capite of the Crown, yet, as nothing further is heard of Robert, it is presumed, that, participating in de Belesme's rebellion, he also became involved in the ruin of his suzerain, when half the manor of Gretton became forfeit to the Crown. If such were the case, his tenant Odo, as was usual in similar circumstances, would become a tenant in capite, that is, he would hold the moiety of Gretton which Robert had held immediately of the Crown. Yet, whether it was so, or whether King Henry I. granted Robert's interest to his viceroy, Richard de Belmeis, is not known. Certain it is, however, that one moiety of Gretton did not leave the tenure in fee of Odo's eldest repre sentative, untd both moieties, being re-united late in the 13th century, the whole manor was enjoyed by his descendant. dfofitlW^ is described in Domesday Book as follows :\u2014 \" The same Rainald holds Stope of the earl, and Fulcher [holds it] of him.

Under the fostering care of Fulcher, its tenant, this waste manor had so recovered that it was actually worth more at the time of the survey than it had been in the time of Edward the Confessor. The Norman Fulcher held other manors besides this under Rain ald the sheriff. It is doubtful, however, whether his descendants continued to enjoy Easthope ; yet, the tenure of Roger, who, in 1165, held it, was of old feoffment, that is, it was existing before the death of King Henry I. Roger's successor, in 1255, was found to be John de Esthop, who, a man of repute, became coroner of Shropshire, an office ranking in importance only next to the sheriff.

The Valor of 1534-5 gives the rectory of Estope as worth \u00a33 6s. 8d. per annum, less a pension of 3s. 4d. payable to the church of Cound, and 4d. for synodals.

[Helgot] found it waste.\" ' The manors thus described, in time lost their Domes day appellation of Stantune, and, becoming one great manor, the name Holgate was given to it, after the baronial residence of its first Norman lord. AVhen Shropshire passed to the Norman Earl Roger, he con ferred upon Helgot, his follower, nineteen manors in the county. This knight who, doubtless, had seen service at Hastings, fixing therefore his seat at Stantune, reared his stronghold in the upper valley of the Corse, over the rich repose of which, in ancient times, it spread its gloomy shadow. Unlike, however, the gene rality of those fortresses with which its Norman Conquerors net worked England, the site of Helgot's castle presented no feature of natural strength, and, as it was far from the AVelsh border, it figures but little on the page of history. The first Norman lord of Stantune granted Monkmoor to Shrews bury abbey, and passed away. Herbert Fitz Helgot then succeeded to his barony, and, as appears from a charter of Beauclerk's, dated \" apud castrum Helgoti in Scalopecyra,\" 2 King Henry I. partook of Fitz Helgot's hospitality at Corse. Like his father, Fitz Helgot gave lands to the church. He gave to Shrewsbury Abbey \" the church of Stanton, with all the tithes of himself, and of his knights, and with all things which pertained to the same church.\" 3 Eutropius, his eldest son, does not appear to have lived to Domesday, so. 258, b I. 2 Monasticon I. 248, Num. xvii. 3 Salop Chartulary, No. 35."], [340, "264 succeed his father, and, dying without issue, Herbert, his brother, styled De Castello, became third baron of Castle Holgate. Her bert left no child, and the heir to his barony, after a dispute between the de Girros famdy and the descendants of Richard de la Mere, which lasted ten years, was found to be in de la Mere's line. Richard de la Mere was one of those Anglo-Normans, who fought under the banner of C\u0153ur de Leon, in Palestine. Upon the abandonment by the Christian forces of the third crusade, in journeying homewards, de la Mere was seized with mortal sickness in Benevento, Italy, when his last act was to grant his vill of Uffington to Haughmond abbey, by a deed in which the particulars of his illness being recited, is attested by the preceptor and one of the brethren of a house of Knights Hospitallers at Benevento. It was Thomas Mauduit, grandson of the deceased crusading knight, who, on coming of age in 1203, became lord of Castle Holgate. Accordingly, in regard to this Shropshire barony, he stands acquitted on the fifth, sixth, and seventh scutages of John, levied respectively in the years 1204-5-6. Thomas Mauduit, lord of a great fief in Hampshire, as well as Castle Holgate, accom panied King John over to Ireland in 1210. He served also in that unlucky French campaign, which terminated in Philip Augustus' victory at Bovines. In 1216, Mauduit joined the barons against John, when Castle Holgate was given to Hugh de Mortimer of Wigmore. Nor did Thomas, hke many, return to his allegiance on the accession of young Henry III , as we learn that on March 16th, 1217, all his lands in Shropshire and Hampshire were given to Robert de Ferrars during the king's pleasure ; but shortly afterwards the rebellious baron, doing homage, his lands were restored. To Thomas Mauduit, William his son succeeded in 1244, whose homage receiving, the king ordered the sheriffs of Shropshire, Hampshire, and AVdtshire to give him seizin of his inheritance in those counties. Styling himself \" Lord of Castle Holgate,\" this Wilham gave to Haughmond abbey that mill out of which, when he bequeathed them his body, his father had given to the monks 20s. rent to celebrate his anniversary. In 1254, this barony was assessed at five fees to the aid for knighting prince Edward. It was AArilliam Mauduit who ahenated this Shropshire barony to Richard Plantagenet, the rich but covetous king of the Romans.

Holgate Church. This, the remains of a Saxon foundation, was given as stated, by Herbert Fitz Helgot, in Henry the First's time, to Shrewsbury abbey. But a deed which passed in 1210, exhibits Holgate church as held by three portionists or prebendaries, the advowson of two of which pertained to Salop Abbey ; the lords of Holgate present ing to the other. Soon after 1280, the patronage of two of the Holgate prebends passed from Shrewsbury abbey to the see of Hereford ; eventually all three prebends were consolidated in a single rectory. Pope Nicholas' Taxation values the three portions in this church separately ; the first at \u00a36, the other two at \u00a34 13s. 4d. each. In 1341, the assessors taxed the parish only \u00a34 13s. 4d. to the ninth, because there were no sheep or lambs, four acres of land lay uncultivated, etc. The Valor of 1534 gives this preferment, including a pension of 4s. receivable from the rector of Aston Botterell, as worth \u00a313 7s. 4d. per annum, less 7s. 8d. for pro curations and synodals. The vicar of Leighton also paid a pension of 5s. to the rector of Holgate. Prebendaries of Holgate. \u2014 Hehas, a priest, was incumbent of the Presbytral prebend in 1210. At that time, the Diaconal prebend, to which the lord of Castle Holgate presented, was vacant ; but Osbern, a priest, had the sub-diaconal prebend.

Church of Clee St. Margaret. The first notice relating to it is in the Taxation of 1291, when, entered as the church of \"le Cleye St. Milburge,\" in the deanery of Ludlow, it is said to belong to the Hospitallers of Dinmore. Its value is not stated. This parish does not appear to have been assessed to the ninth in 1341, but in 1534-5, \" the chapel of St. Margaret de Lee Clee \" was valued at \u00a33 per annum, out of which an annual pension of 14s. was payable \" to the Commander of the Commandery of St. John of Dynmore.\" Early Incumbent. \u2014 The first we hear of in connection with this church, is Richard Rushton, parson, in 1546-7.

Early in the 12th century, however, Stephen, rector of Munslow, claimed the two Milinsopes to belong to his parish ; but Bishop Richard de Belmeis, viceroy of Shropshire, decided that all St. Milburg's lands were parochially subject to the mother church of Wenlock. \" There is, nevertheless,\" added the viceroy, \" conceded to Stephen, not in virtue of his claim, but for the sake of peace and for love of his lord (the lord of Munslow), the tithe and the sepulture of the rustics of Lower Milinsope, and the third garb of the tithe of the same lord \" ; \u2014 the result of which concession is, that to this day Lower Millicope is in Munslow parish, while Upper Mdlicope 1 Domesday, so. 258, b I."], [345, "267 and Hungerford are in St. Milburg's parish of Eaton.

There still exists at Upper Mdlichope a house, the architectural details of which belong to the 13th century. It is presumed to have been the lodge of the hereditary foresters of the Long Forest. The precautions against attack are elaborate. QitWllUOUl, This name appears to have agricultural ideas associated with it. We learn from Domesday, that : \u2014 \" The same Helgot holds Oxibola.

About 1244, Robert, a descendant of this man, granted Oxenbold to Wenlock priory, for which \" the prior re ceived the said Robert into all benefits, prayers, etc., which should be offered up in his house for ever.\" Wenlock retained the manor untd the harsh hand of bluff Harry the Eighth severed the accord. Yet the prior, foreseeing the impending storm, in order to subsist when he should be out of his house, raising the fines high, leased the manor out at a low rent, hence the minister's accounts of 1541-2 give only \u00a317 13s. 4d. as the ferm of Oxenbold. Monk-Hopton, Weston, and Far Monk-Hall or Priors Muchall, originally members of Oxenbold, also ah belonged to Wenlock priory.

One obtained from the king a portion of Long Stanton by sergeantry of acting as a \" constable of 200 foot-soldiers whenever any king of England invaded Wales.\" One of these constables granted whatever he had in Long Stanton to a tenant in fee, yet his right to do so being afterwards questioned, his descendants had to compound for the act by an annual payment to the Crown. The tenant's name was Simon de Stanton, and he, during the thirty-six years he held this estate, granted many subinfeudations thereof. The abbot of Haughmond acquired an interest here, so also did the Knights Templars : nor had Wen lock priory been forgotten. Church and Parish of Long Stanton. In 1081, the church of this parish was probably at Patton, with which it has always been connected. A century afterwards, we hear of Walter, chaplain of Stanton. Before 1275, the prior of AVenlock gave this advowson to the dean and chapter of Hereford, when it became a vicarage in their gift. In 1291, the church of Long Stanton, in the deanery of Wenlock, was valued at \u00a313 6s. 8d. per annum. Yet the parish, in 1341, was assessed only \u00a33 10s. to the ninth, because of destruction of corn by storms, murrain among sheep, surrender of eleven tenants, whose lands lay uncidtivated, etc. The Valor of 1534-5 gives the vicarage of Long Stanton as worth \u00a37 0s. 8d, less 7s. 8d. for procurations and synodals. \" iJattOlt is thus noticed in Domesday : \u2014 \" The same Roger holds of tlie Earl, Patintune.

Now [it is worth] 24s.\" ' Patton and Long Stanton have always been in the same parish. Roger de Lacy was Domesday lord of both. Herbert held them of him. Doubtless, also, Aluuin, the Saxon lord of Patintune, was identical with Eluuin the Saxon proprietor of Stantune : finally, when De Lacy lost his barony, both manors underwent a similar disintegration. Then half of Patton passed to the seigneury of Wenlock Priory, when, according to the custom of the priory, it was leased out to life tenants. In 1363, the prior of Wenlock obtained the king's licence to purchase the other moiety of this manor ; and so, at length, he reduced the whole, and his successors retained jurisdiction over Patton until the Dissolution. This place formerly was caput of the Domesday Hundred to which it gave a name. (ItUfmUlini was formerly a Roman station, the Devil's Cause way being the direct line of communication betwixt it and Nordy Bank. It is thus alluded to in that Anglo-Norman record, Domes day Book : \u2014 \" The same Roger holds Riseberie, and Odo [holds] of him. __Eluuin held it [in Saxon times] and was a free man.

Now [it is worth] 35s., and there might be ii more teams here.\" ' After Roger Fitz-Odo, Herbert de Rushbury was lord of this manor in 1200, holding it under AValter de Lacy, in whose Irish interests he participated, since we read of Herbert de Rissebiry and Elias de Say, another of Lacy's Shropshire feoffees, being joint claimants of land in Meath against AVdham Parvus. Herbert's interest in Rushbury eventually passed to his heirs, De Willey and De Bitterley, whose houses inheriting the manor, hence Rushbury came to be split up into no less than six manors, namely, Rush- 1 Domesday, so. 256, b 1."], [348, "270 bury proper, Eastwall, AVestwall, AVall-sub-Heywood, Coates, and AAriiderhope. It would serve, however, but to disgust and weary the reader to trace all the various sub-infeudations that sprung up in the manor of Rushbury. A single sample will suffice. In 1255, Eastwall, merely one of the six constituents of Rushbury, was held by Roger Sprenghose of Adam de Brinton, who held under the heir of Nicholas de Wdliley, the said heh under Margery de Lacy, the said Margery, in dower, under the heirs of AValter de Lacy, and the said heirs in capite of the crown. Rushbury Church. This church, the architectural remains of which bespeak its an tiquity, was probably founded by Roger de Laci, the Domesday baron, and by him given to that priory at Hereford in which both his father and himself took so much interest. In 1291, the church of Ryssebury, in the deanery of AVenlock was valued at \u00a313 6s. 8d., besides a portion of 13s. 4d., which the prior of Hereford had therein. In 1341, the parish was assessed only \u00a35 to the ninth; the reasons were, \" destruction of wheat by tempest, murrain of sheep, poverty and desertion of tenants,\" etc. The Valor of 1534-5 gives the church of Rusburye as worth \u00a319 15s. 4d. per annum, less 7s. 8d. for procurations and synodals. Early Incumbent. \u2014 Richard, rector of Rushbury in 1250. (\u25a0yltljhCihUfy in Patinton Hundred, is thus briefly noticed in Domesday : \u2014 \" Wilham [Pantulf] holds Buchehale. Elmer held it.

The collective tenure, at first, was by service of half a knight's fee, but afterwards by serjeantry of finding one horseman at Montgomery for forty days, in time of war, at the tenant's own cost. Ruthall, with'Ashfield, now constitutes a township in the parish of Priors Ditton. Unlike the rest of the parish, however, this township is in Munslow Hundred ; for the prior of AVenlock, although lord of Ditton, never succeeded in obtaining ingress into Ruthall or Ashfield.

In time of King Edward [the manor] was worth 12s.\" ' Azor, who held this manor in Saxon times, was lord also of Burwarton and Neenton. Scarcely anything is known of either Norman, Roger, or Ulger Venator. Roger Venator's manors, as a general rule, went to form the fief of Pulverbatch, yet not the one in question, which appears to have passed, if not wholljT, in greater part, to the prior of AATenlock. In 1255, Philip de Beckbury was lord of the vill, holding it of the prior at a rent of 25s. Exactly the same amount was receivable by the prior, in the shape of chief rent, from Beckbury, upwards of 260 years afterwards. At the forest assizes of March, 1209, the following charge was brought against the lord of this manor : \u2014 \" Richard de Preste wode (a forester, apparently), going through his badiwick of Morse, followed two men till he came up with them, viz., Hugh de Becte bury and Thomas, his brother.

Beckbury, and Badger formerly described, evidently both be longed to the great Saxon parish of St. Mdburg, a condition to this day evidenced by their forming detachments of the diocese of Hereford. The church of Beckbury, in the deanery of Wenlock and diocese of Hereford, was, in 1291, of less than \u00a34 annual value. There is no mention of an assessment to the ninth here. The Valor of 1534-5 gives the rectory of Beckburye, as worth \u00a35 6s. 8d. per annum, out of which the prior of AVenlock had his pension of 3s., and 4d. went for synodals.

Upon the rebellion of Bobert de Belesme, son of the first Norman earl, Stottesden reverted to the Crown, when Henry I., retaining the central manor in demesne, granted away, on various conditions, its berewicks or adjuncts. Reputed as of ancient demesne, this central manor of Stottesden came into the hands of Henry IL, who gave it to Godfrey de Gamages in 1159. Godfrey was a scion of that Norman famdy whose castle and vill of Gamache, from whence they derived their name, situated in the Norman Vexin, gave name to a deanery in the archdiocese of Rouen. The name Gamages figures on the roll of Battle abbey3 as that of one who contributed by his long sword to place the Conqueror upon the English throne ; hence, he to whom Henry II. gave Stottesden, inherited two knight's fees of old feoffment in the Herefordshire barony of de Lacy, the estate in question being the meed of that knightly service his ancestor had rendered at Hastings. From the circumstance that Godfrey received from Henry II. other gifts besides- that of Stottesden, it is inferred that he fought against the usurper Stephen ; yet, be this as it may, by 1176, Mathew, his son, had succeeded to his estates both in Normandy and England. As was the case generally with those who held lands on both sides of the channel, the situation of this Anglo-Norman noble now became critical. 1 \" Coliberli.\" These appear to have been serfs partially enfranchised. Like the villains, they were ascripti glelhr, they belonged to the land, and required fur ther manumission to make them free. 3 Domesday, so. 254,' a I. 3 Duchesne's List."], [355, "275 Richard C\u0153ur de Leon ceded to Philip Augustus of France, by the treaty of Issoudun in 1195, the Norman Vexin territory, including the castle of Gamache. It was a mistake on the part of the Anglo-Norman king, who, although a consummate warrior, was a bad politician. Upon the renewal of hostilities in the following year, the castle of Gamache was re-captured, when, as an outpost commanding a debateable frontier, it was immediately strongly fortified. Such was the position in which Mathew de Gamages stood, and such it continued to be, until, in 1203, not withstanding all the bribes lavished on him by the fratricidal king of England, Matthew, hke other Anglo-Norman nobles, preferred holding under the chivalrous French monarch to continuing a vassal of King John's. Stottesden accordingly became forfeit to the Crown : a temporary possession of it was then obtained by Ivo and Hugh Pantulf, but in 1222, this estate was restored to William de Gamages, brother of him who had forfeited it. He who now became lord of Stottesden doubtless fought for the king' in that civil war which closed John's career, and distinguished the earlier years of young Henry the Third's reign ; for we read that royalty conferred on AVilliam de Gamages various favours. Upon his decease, Henry III., in violation of hereditary rights, recovered Stottesden from Godfrey, son and heir of Wdliam, and bestowed it upon his favourite, John de Plessitis, sometime Earl of Warwick. Accordingly, the jurors in 1255, said that the manor of Stottesden \" was an escheat of the lord king of the Land of the Normans, which Sir John de Plessy holds in capite of the king, who is enfeoffed in the same vill by royal charter, and for service of half a knight's fee, etc.\" Upon the death of John de Plessitis, Hugh, his son, paid his relief of 100s. and had livery of this manor, which, in 1270, he gave in frank marriage with Christiana, his infant daughter, to John de Segrave, then 14 years of age ; consistently with which the Feodary of March, 1316, gives John de Segrave as lord of Stottesden. It was this John, who, at the head of his London brigade, made the onset against the Royalists at the famous battle of Lewes. The Church. Stottesden church appears to have been one of those Saxon foundations which had for its parish a very extensive district. It was given to Shrewsbury abbey by Earl Roger de Montgomery, previously to 1085 ; hence, as Domesday observes, \"the church of St. Peter holds the church of this manor, together with two hides"], [356, "276 and a half\"; its glebe, in fact. About 1283, this church became a vicarage, Bishop Swinfield having granted an appropriation of it to the abbot of Shrewsbury ; in return for which favour, when Swinfield afterwards visited this part of his diocese, the abbot found forage for 41 horses of his train. The abbot's rectorial income from Stottesden was valued in 1291 at \u00a326 13s. 4d. ; the vicarial portion was \u00a313 6s. 8d. ; besides which, the abbot of Wigmore had a portion of 13s. 4d., the rector of Cornley \u00a31, the precentor of Wenlock priory 13s. 4d., and the dean of Brug 6s. 8d. from Stottesden \"church. In 1341, the asses sors of the ninth rated the parish at only \u00a315 6s. 8d., because 500 acres lay unfilled ; there were no sheep or lambs, and the tenants had quitted on account of poverty, etc. The Valor of 1534 gives \u00a38 13s. 4d. as the amount of the abbot of Shrewsbury's tithes from Stottesden and Duddlewick. Stottesden vicarage was worth \u00a315 12s. 8d., less 10s. for procurations, and 2s. for synodals. Early Incumbent. \u2014 John Fitz Walter, 1100-35.

Yet beautiful in mind and in person as Edith was, the Confessor King cared not for her : she dwelt in his palace a wife only in name. And the king spent his days in visions of superstition.

STOTTESDEN CHURCn."], [358, ""], [359, "FONT, STOTTESDEN, p. 276."], [360, ""], [361, "279 Whether the circumstance that the unhonoured wife of King Edward is described as having singly held Claiberie during the life-time of her husband indicates the estrangement that existed between them, or whether this and other Shropshire and Here fordshire manors had been given Edith bj- her father is unknown ; yet, Domesday proves that after the death of her brother Harold, the last Anglo-Saxon king, Queen Edith was deprived, at least of Claiberie, if not of all her other estates. We infer from Domesday that the Conqueror had bestowed Claiberie and its adjuncts on William Fitz Osborn, Earl of Here ford; and that, in turn, he enfeoffed Turstin de Wigmore therein.1 Now Fitz Osborn was slain in Flanders, on February 20th, 1071 ; and as Edith died at Winchester on December 14th, 1074, it is clear that she had been bereft of Claiberie. The Saxon ex-lady of England died a sad-hearted woman, when, with much funereal pomp, King William assigned her a resting-place by the side of Edward the Confessor in Westminster Abbey. Upon the forfeiture, in 1074, of Ear? Roger de Britolio, Fitft Osborn's successor, Mortemer, the conqueror of Edric the forester, obtained Cleobury, Wigmore, and other estates that had formerly been Fitz Osborn's, from the king, when Turstin the niesne tenant having been removed, Mortemer made Cleobury his head quarters. Barony of Mortimer. Ralph de Mortemer, to whom William I. gave the manor of Cleobury, was son of Roger de Mortemer, of Castle Mortemer, in the Pays de Caux, who was cousin in the second degree of affinity to Robert the Devil, father pf William, the Conqueror. Ralph's brother Hue, Wace tells us, rendered an important service at Hastings. \" The English fell back upon a rising ground, and the Normans followed them across the valley, attacking them on foot and horseback. Then Hue de Mortemer, with the Sires d'Anviler, D'Onebac, and Saint-Cler, rode up and charged, overthrowing many.\" 2 The Domesday baron succeeded to his father's estates in Normandy, and, as stated, upon the forfeiture of Earl Roger de Britolio, and his nearly simultaneous reduction of Sylvaticus, Ralph de Mortemer acquired an extensive fief in Shropshire and Herefordshire, which he held in capite of the king. Ralph was related to Earl Roger de Montgomery, much in the same way as 2 W ACE's \"Roman de Rou,\" by Taylor, p. 239. 1 See Mawley, p. 282."], [362, "280 he was to the king : all three descended from Gunnora, wife of Richard I., count of the Normans, and her two sisters. Mortemer appears to have held the office of seneschal to the Norman earls, yet he shared neither in the rebellion nor subsequent forfeiture of Roo-er de Belesme. To the Domesday baron succeeded \u2014 Hugh de Mortemer, his son, who, upon the accession of Henry II. , fortified against that king Bridgnorth Castle, which Stephen had permitted him to hold, probably on account of his traditionary office of seneschal over the royal demesnes of Shropshire. As a general rule, the appointments of the usurper were reversed by Henry II. , hence the quarrel between Mortemer and the king. We have seen how Henry II. destroyed Cleobury castle, and reduced his turbulent vassal.1 Great consideration however, appears to have been shown to De Mortemer, who in regard to his Shropshire barony, had special immunities from scutages and aids allowed ; in this respect, Mortemer's standing alone among the Shropshire baronies. Hugh founded Wigmore abbey, and, dying in 1181, was succeeded by \u2014 Roger de Mortimer, his son, who having shortly before way laid and murdered Cadwallan, a prince of South Wales, as, under the king's guarantee of safe-conduct, he was returning from court, he suffered a two years' forfeiture and imprisonment for the offence. About 1195, this baron was signally defeated by Rees, prince of South Wales, under the walls of Radnor castle. Besides acqui sitions in Wales, Mortimer held estates in no less than thirteen English counties, and the vast hereditary fief in Normandy of St. Victor-en-Caux. Uniformly adhering to King John in his contest with the King of France, on the revolution that ensued, Roger lost his Norman barony. On the other side, his English estates were augmented ; for, owing to the disqualification of the lord of Fer rieres, her brother, consequent on his siding with Philip Augustus, Isabel, his wife, acquired the Gloucestershire manors of Lechlade and Longborough, and Oakham, Rutlandshire. In May, 1213, Roger de Mortimer was one of the twelve barons who stood sponsors for the good faith of King John, when, suc cumbing to the pope, he solicited the return of Archbishop Lang ton to England. About the same time, Mortimer, with his wife, proffered for the custody and lands of William de Beauchamp of Elmley, a fine, the enormous amount of which may be inferred 1 Pa_;e 1 <;"], [363, "281 from the circumstance, that, in June 1214, \u00a31011 of it still re mained unpaid. To Roger succeeded \u2014 Hugh de Mortimer IL, who, at the time of his father's death, was serving in Poitou, his wife, a daughter of the ill-fated Braose, remaining, meanwhde, the victim of John Plantagenet's cruelty. The king returned from Poitou hi October, 1214, when, in de ference to the prayer of the legate, he ordered the lady to be liberated. Notwithstanding the treatment which his wife had ex perienced at the hands of John, Hugh de Mortimer steadfastly adhered to that king throughout his troubles ; and Hugh's attesta tion to John's last charter, which passed at Lincoln on Sept. 28, 1216, but three short weeks before he was no more, proves his fidelity to the king, even in his extreme. In return for his ad hering to the cause of his father, young Henry III., by a patent dated Jan. 27, 1217, gave Hugh de Mortimer the lands of all the king's enemies which were of Mortimer's fee ; in other words, an authority to confiscate all the estates of his anti-royalist tenants. The first scutage of King Henry III. was about to be collected in October, 1217, when the sheriffs of seventeen counties were ordered to assist Hugh de Mortimer in enforcing payment on his tenants, the sheriffs of nine counties at the same time receiving orders to assist his wife to collect of her tenants. Hugh served in person at the siege of Biham, and on May 31, 1223, the king gave him 20 merks towards strengthening Wigmore castle. In 1226, Henry III. granted Hugh the privilege of holding an annual fair in his manor of Cleybiry, to last for three days, viz., September 13, 14, and 15. In the following year, Hugh died, leaving no issue, when Cleo bury, and the numerous estates of the deceased baron, devolved upon his brother \u2014 Ralph de Mortimer II. Heavy liabilities, however, attached to Mortimer's barony, the late noble, at the time of his decease, owing to the king a destrier, two hawks, and no less than \u00a31015 2s. 4d., the larger half of which sum had been contracted fourteen years before, and of the balance of the debt, not a farthing had the deceased baron paid to the king during thirteen years. It was a characteristic of the haughty Mortimers to be indifferent to their pecuniary obligations with the crown. He who now be came lord of Cleobury, married Gladuse Duy, daughter of Llewel lyn the Great, by Joan, the illegitimate daughter of King John,"], [364, "282 and by her Ralph de Mortimer acquired lands ; and on the failure, at a subsequent period, of ah other legitimate descendants of Llewellyn the Great, the Principality of North Wales was said to be in the representatives of Gladuse Duy. To Ralph succeeded\u2014 Roger de Mortimer IL, who, at the time of his father's de cease, was only seventeen years of age. He married the eldest daughter and co-heir of William de Braose, and she, bringing him a third ofthe Honour of Braose of Brecknock, and also a share in the Honour of the Earls Marshal, Baron Mortimer thus acquired large estates in England, Wales, and Ireland. On June 11, 1259, Mortimer was appointed a commissioner to demand satisfaction from Llewellyn ap Griffyth for breaches of truce, with power to prolong the truce and treat of peace, and a fortnight afterwards the commissioners concluded a year's truce at Montgomery. At that time the Marches were in a fearfully disturbed state. On July 17, 1260; the Welsh took Builth castle, which Mortimer had custody of on behalf of Prince Edward, and complaining to the Anglo-Norman king, in June 1262, of Mortimer's infraction of the truce, the enraged Llewellyn besieged and took his enemies' castles of Knoklas and Keuenches, when ensued a regular Welsh war. Upon the rupture between the Crown and the Barons, with other warlike lords-marchers, Roger Mortimer declared in favour of the royal cause, and, in December, 1263, with Prince Edward, he was on the king's side against the confederate lords, when both parties swore\" to defer to the arbitration of the king of France. Roger fought by the side of Henry III. when the barons were defeated at Northampton, and, according to some,1 was present at Lewes when the royalists met with that disastrous reverse which ended in King Henry III. and Prince Edward both being captured. Escaping from the battle-field, Roger, with other western barons, then stirred up war in the Marches against Llewelyn and Simon Montfort ; but the result is the subject of discordant accounts. It was Roger de Mortimer who, acting in concert with Roger de Clifford, contrived to effect the escape of Prince Edward from Hereford castle. It was managed in this way : on May 30, 1265, the prince obtained permission from his guards to take exercise in a field outside the city, and to amuse himself with trying the speed of their horses. At length, after tiring out all the others, 1 Matthew of Westminster, vol. ii. p.419, Bohn's Ed."], [365, "283 he mounted a fresh good steed, and giving him the spur, Prince Edward bade farewell to his guards. Accompanied by two knights and four esquires, his personal attendants, who had been made acquainted with his design, the prince, crossing the river Wear, directed his course to Mortimer's castle of Wigmore. Recovering from their surprise, his guards pursued ; but, on seeing the banners of Mortimer and De Clifford, who, by preconcerted appointment, now appeared, they saw that they had been out-man\u0153uvred, and returned to Hereford. Within ten weeks after, the battle of Evesham was fought, Simon Montfort, the leader of the rebels, was slain and the king restored to his prerogative. After that decisive victory, no reward was too great for Mortimer, whose steady loyalty and conspicuous valour had largely contributed to the grand re sult. Among other acknowledgments of his services, the baron obtained from the king a charter by which Cleobury and Chel marsh henceforth were to constitute a single manor, it, with its members, to remain independent of all suits to county or hundred. Taking advantage of a vaguely worded charter, the baron then pro ceeded to annex some twenty manors to the new franchise, and, setting up his central court at Cleobury, the royal Hundred of Stottesden lost the suit of many manors. This Roger was one of the trustees appointed by Prince Edward to take charge of his estates whilst he fought in Palestine. To Roger succeeded \u2014 Edmund de Mortimer, his son, who, doing homage, had livery of his lands, on November 24, 1282. It was he who commanded the detachment when Llewellyn fell at Builth. The unfortunate Welsh prince's head was cut off and carried to London, where, in mockery crowned with ivy, and fixed to a stake, his brutal enemies erected it upon the Tower of London. Edmund de Mortimer was sued under writs of quo warranto for the various franchises arro gated by his father. The king's writ of Diem clausit extremum, upon the decease of this baron, is dated Stirling, July 25, 1304, whither, doubtless, Mortimer had followed his sovereign, King Edward I., in his ambitious scheme against the liberties of Scot land. Roger de Mortimer III., son and heir of the deceased, now became lord of Cleobury, whose great power on the border sug gested his elevation to the earldom of March. His mad career ended on a scaffold. The lineal representatives of the haughty and powerful barons Mortimer in the seventh generation were Edward IV. and Richard III , two sceptred kings."], [366, "284 Owing to the exclusive nature of Mortimer's seigneury, little is known concerning the undertenants of Cleobury. Cleobury Mortimer Church. The church of Cleo bury, perhaps originally founded by Queen Edith, was, in 1179, given by Hugh de Mortimer to that abbey of Wigmore he founded. According ly, Pope Nicholas' Taxa tion in 1291, represents the church of Clebury Mortymer, in the dean ery of Burford, as be longing to the abbot of Wygmore, and ofthe an nual value of \u00a310 : the vicar's portion being less than \u00a34. In 1341, the parish was taxed \u00a36 13s. 4d. to the ninth. In 1534-5, the vicar of Clyberye Mortymer's income was \u00a312 18s. 6d., less 7s. 8d. for procur ations and synodals.

Unques tionably the Domesday Dodentone is represented by Earl's Ditton, and the Doddington liberty of Cleobury Mortimer. Ditton is simply a contraction for Dodentone, the prefix, \" Earl's \" attached, indi cating the former seigneury of the Mortimers, Earls of March. %\\it J^OUI, The Anglo-Saxon hlaw, lowe, signifies a tumulus, and generally speaking where the syllable low forms either singly or in combination the name of a place, we may expect to hear of a tumulus or place of burial.

In demesne is one team, and ii villains and i boor with i team. [In Edward the Confessor's time] it- was worth 5s.; now 10 s. He [Richard] found it waste.\" 2 The church of St. Peter alluded to above, was that Saxon parish church, in the eastern suburb of Shrewsbury, which, under the auspices of the first Norman earl, expanded into the Benedictine abbey of St. Peter and St. Paul. As Mortemer took no interest in Shrewsbury Abbey, he transmitted his seigneury over the Low to his descen dants, under whom, a family deriving their name from the place, held the estate for upwards of two centuries. rjfwlt is thus noticed in Domesday : \u2014 \" The same Ralph holds Nene, and Richard [holds] of him.

This was also bestowed upon Wigmore Abbey by Hugh dc Mortemer, and the abbot's rectorial income from it in 1291 amounted to \u00a36 13s. 4d. ; the vicar's portion being under \u00a34. In 1341, the parish was assessed only \u00a34 10s. to thewm.A, because there had been a murrain among the sheep, there were no lambs or wool in it ; eight acres lay unfilled, etc. The Valor of 1534-5 represents Nyende Savage vicarage as worth \u00a35 17s. 6d., less 13s. 4d. to the abbot of Wigmore, and 7s. 8d. for procurations and synodals. Early Incumbent. \u2014 John de Stepleton, 1317. formerly a manor in itself, is now a member of Neen Savage.

In King Edward's time, the manor was worth 60s. [annually] ; after wards 30s. ; now 40s.\" 2 Mortemer acquired this manor probably in the same way as he had done Cleobury. The successors of Richard the Domesday tenant, were the Bromp- tons, descending from a male ancestor cotemporary with, yet quite distinct from, Richard. Brian de Brompton, the last of the elder male line of his house, was dead on December 28th, 1294, as on that day a writ of Diem clausit extremum was issued by Edward I., when the jurors who reported the Shropshire tenures of the deceased said, that Brian had held twenty acres of the king in capite in Kinlet park, by service of a twentieth-part of a knight's fee, and that he had done homage to the king for the said tenure, which was worth 6s. per annum.3 Glancing at the wide-spreading domains of the Bromptons, it seems extraordinary that a single tenure in capite of twenty acres by knight's service, should have entitled the Crown to control the whole ; yet, such was the fact ; and, his having held this insignificant slip of land of the Crown, gave the king a right to dispose of the two daughters of Brian de Brompton in marriage. Accordingly, Edward I. gave Margaret de Brompton, then not three years of age, to \"his beloved clerk,\" , Malcolm de Harley, for his nephew Robert. Hence it came that, in the beginning of the present century, Brompton Bryan was in the hands of Edward Harley, Earl of Oxford and Mortimer, as the lineal descendant of Robert de Harley and Margaret de Brompton. Kinlet Church. From the French chronicle of Wigmore, we learn that Kinlet church was given by John de Brompton to that abbey (1179) ; the seigneural lord concurring.

As rector of Kinlet, the abbot of Wigmore found corn and fuel for baking bread to Swinfield's suite, besides forage for the thirty-six horses of his train. The Taxation of 1291 gives \u00a310 as the value of the rectory of Kynleth ; the vicar's portion being under \u00a3-1. In 1341, the parish was assessed only \u00a35 10s. for the ninth of its wheat, wool, and lamb, because the abbot had land here, etc. The Valor of 1534-5 gives the vicar of Kynlett's preferment as \u00a38 10s., less 7s. 8d. for procurations and synodals.

Besides the seven manors just described, which he held in capite of the Crown, Ralph de Mortemer held six others in Condetret Hundred under Roger de Montgomery, the Norman Earl of Shrewsbury. We proceed now to notice these latter places, in the order in which they are entered in Domesday Book, pre mising, however, that there is little connected with their early history of a nature to interest the reader. According to the Conqueror's record : \u2014 \" The same Radulf holds Hugelei [or, as it is now called, Higley]. The Countess Godeva held it [in Saxon times]. Here iii hides geldable.

It is not a little singular, however, that although four of these manors, namely, Overton, Walton Savage, Eudon George, and Rudge, belonged, in Saxon times, to Edric the Savage ; yet, between him and the family who afterwards held them, there was no blood relationship. By 1255, the Le Savages' interest in this manor had been transferred to Wigmore Abbey, hence the return of the Stottesden jurors, who said, that \" the abbot of Wygemore is lord of Walton Savage.\" The minister's accounts of 1539-40 enter a total of \u00a35 12s. 8d. as the interest of the late monastery in Walton.

There is a strong probability, however, that, within easy distance as it was of Cleobury and Kinlet, manors once belonging to the Saxon crown, as appurtenant to them, the Shropshire portion of Wyre Forest passed, with these manors to William Fitz-Osborn, Earl of Hereford. In process of time, vdls sprang up in Wyre Forest, one of which, Earnwood, namely, Eagle-wood, bears in its very name a con viction that the spot was so called before it was known as a habit ation of man.

Like Cleobury North, Hoptone passed from the fief of Lacy to that of Bernard de Newmarch, the conqueror of Brecknockshire, when the Le Wafres held both manors immediately under the lords of Brecknock.

Yet the evidence is pretty clear on the point. It was the only manor in Condetret Hundred which Roger de Laci held of the Norman earl. At the inquest on Stottesden Hundred, held in November, 1274, the Jurors reported how that John de la Watere, constable of Corfham, had extorted half a merk (a considerable sum) from Roger le Burger, of Wethul, for taking a bundle of thorns from the woods of the lord of Corfham ; and a simdar sum from Richard Fitz-Agnes, of Wethul, for taking one hazel rod from the same.

Burford was the caput of Osbern Fitz-Bichard's Shrop shire. Barony of Burford and Richard's Castle. \u2014 The father of Os bern Fitz Bichard who, according to Domesday, held Burford of the king, was the Bichard Scrob, alias Bichard Fitz Scrobi, just alluded to. Upon the rupture between the Norniandised Court of Edward the Confessor and Earl Godwin in 1052, when the potent Saxon, triumphing over his enemies, a decree of banishment was pro nounced against the foreigners, Fitz Scrobi was one of the few Norman favourites of the king suffered to remain in England. Another foreigner permitted to remain was Bobert the Deacon, whose daughter Fitz Scrobi had married. The meek Anglo-Saxon monarch had been extremely kind to these aliens, Fitz Scrobi, according to Domesday, having held in Saxon times four manors in Worcestershire and Burford in Shropshire ; besides an interest he had in Herefordshire, in which county, at the time of the survey, Osbern Fitz Bichard, Scrobi's son, was seized of no less than sixteen manors, the gift to him probably of his father. Upon the invasion of England by the Normans in 1066, Scrobi, or Scrupe as he is called in one part of Domesday, ungenerously lent his influence to crush the liberties of that people upon whose bounty he had for so long a time existed ; he, with the Norman garrison of Hereford, making frequent inroads upon the lands of Edric the forester, who still bravely held out in the west. Fitz Scrobi's efforts were not successful ; and we learn that, summoning to his aid Blethyn and Bhywallon, the princes of North Wales and Bowis, in retaliation Edric then laid waste the county of Hereford, as far as the bridge of Lugg, and carried off much booty.2 It is affirmed by some, that Bichard Scrupe built Bichard's Castle, Herefordshire, and that from him the stronghold derived its name. He died before the survey, at which period \u2014 Osbern Fitz Bichard, his son, held largely in Herefordshire, Shropshire, AVorcestershire, Warwickshire, and Bedfordshire, under the king or the Norman Earl of Shrewsbury. To Osbern succeeded Hugh, son of Osbern, or \u2014 Hugh Fitz Osbern, who lived in the reign of Henry I. He married Eustachia de Say, who left her surname with their s Florence ok Worcester, Sub. ann. 1067. 1 Domesday, so. 260, a 1."], [384, "296 descendants. She and her son founded the nunnery of Westwood, in Worcestershire. That son's name was \u2014 Osbern Fitz Hugh, who succeeded to the barony of Burford before 1140. He married Amicia, daughter of Walter de Clifford, and sister to Fair Bosamond. Fair Bosamond died in 1175 or 1176, when, for her soul's health and that of her mother, Osbern, at the request of her father,- Sir Walter de Clifford, gave to the nunnery of Godstow, where Bosamond was buried, his salt-pit in Wich; King Henry II. assenting to the grant. Osbern Fitz Hugh was also a benefactor to Haughmond Abbey, to which he gave a very valuable gold cup. In 1185, Osbern was deceased without issue, when his brother, Hugh de Say fined 200 merks for livery of his lands. To him succeeded \u2014 Hugh de Say II., his son, who was employed in the wars of Wales. We learn that at Michaelmas, 1191, the sheriff of Shrop shire had paid Hugh 25 merks for ward of Norton castle, Badnor shire, and \u00a36 8s. for 40 swine to victual it ; and, in 1195, the sheriff of Herefordshire paid him 100s. to fortify the castle of Blidewach, by order of Archbishop Hubert. De Say was killed in the Welsh wars. His daughter and sole heir marrying \u2014 Hugh de Ferrars, who had obtained her marriage by fining 800 merks with the Crown ; he next became baron of Bichard's Castle : yet he did not long enjoy it, for he died in 1204. Among others who then aspired to the hand of the rich Margaret de Say, who remained a child although a widow, was Thomas de Galwey, afterwards Earl of Athol, who, in 1205, furnished certain ships manned with mercenaries for King John's service, the king agree ing to go halves with the bravadoes in whatever they should pillage from his enemies.1 Galwey proffered to the king a fine of 1,000 merks \"that he might have the land of Hugh de Say,\" yet he never actually married Margaret; as, falling under the king's displeasure, about 1211 \u2014 Bobert de Mortimer fined for, and obtained the marriage of Margery de Say, and became baron of Bichard's Castle. Although bearing the name, it does not appear that this baron was related to Mortimer of Wigmore, the paternal inheritance of Mortimer of Richard's Castle lying in Essex. Faithfully adhering to King John, that sovereign, at Oswestry, on August 9th, 1216, gave him 1 Patent, p. 51."], [385, "297 all such lands in his Worcestershire fief as were held by tenants adverse to the king; and, three days afterwards, at Shrewsbury, King John granted him a right to hold a- weekly market on Thursdays, at Bichard's Castle, and a yearly fair at the feast of St. Owen (August 26th), to last for six days. Bobert died in 1219, and on July 5th of that year, young Henry III. received the homage of Margaret de Say at Gloucester, and ordered the sheriffs of Northamptonshire, Oxfordshire, Berkshire, Hereford shire, Worcestershire, Gloucestershire, Warwickshire, and Shrop shire, to give her seizin of Bichard's Castle, and all other lands of her inheritance. Only four months after the decease of Mortimer, Margaret married a third husband \u2014 William de Stutevill, who thereupon became lord of Richard's Castle. Assessed to various scutages and aids during the reign of Henry III., in 1255 this William was returned as holding Bureford in capite. He held his barony, however, merely by courtesy of England, as it was termed, in right of his wife who had long before died. The king's writ of Diem clausit extremum, issued on the decease of William de Stutevill in 1259, when the inquests that followed found that Margaret de Say's son was heir to the barony, and accordingly \u2014 Hugh de Mortimer, that son, did homage to the king, his relief being fixed at \u00a3100. This baron took an active part in the civil war that raged towards the close of the reign of Henry III., and suffered for his loyalty at the hands of Simon Montfort.1 He fought on behalf of the king at Evesham; after which victory, among other rewards the king bestowed on his faithful adherent, was a privilege to hunt the hare, fox, weasel, and wild cat in any of the king's forests in Shropshire. A charter, dated Kenilworth, November 16th, 1266, likewise granted Hugh a weekly market on Saturdays, ancl an annual fair of three days (March 24, 25, and 26) at Burford. At the inquest held at Burford, on December 15th, 1274, upon the decease of Hugh de Mortimer, the jurors found that he had held two carucates in demesne in Burford manor, that two out of the three portions of Burford church belonged to him as patron ; that the barony of Burford commanded no less than 32\u00a3 knights' fees in different counties ; and that Robert de Mortimer, son and heir of the deceased was 22i years old, etc. At an inquisition made at the same time by the justices at 1 See Dugdale's Baronage, i. p. 15.-153."], [386, "298 Shrewsbury as to the state of Overs Hundred, the jurors reported, that, after the battle of Evesham, the late Hugh de Mortimer had procured Burford to'be made a free borough by Henry III. J from which we may presume that about this period it became a corpo rate town. Robert de Mortimer, who now became baron of Burford, had summons to muster with horse and arms at Worcester, on July 1, 1277, to march against Lewellyn. Ten years afterwards he was dead, when succeeded \u2014 Hugh de Mortimer II. , last baron of his line, whose sum monses, both military and parliamentary, are numerous between 1297 and 1301, the dates inclusive of his public career. He left two daughters, Joan and Margaret. Upon the decease of her first husband, Joan de Mortimer became wife of Bichard Talbot. Margaret, before she had attained the age of twelve years, was married to Geoffrey de Cornwall. Be tween these co-heiresses, the manor of Burford, therefore, was divided, and among their descen dants the barony is still in abeyance. Burford Church. Alluded to in Domesday, this church probably ex isted in Saxon times. Dope Nicholas' Taxation in 1291, represents Bur ford church, in the deanery of Burford, as consisting of three por tions, valued respectively at \u00a316 13s. 4d., \u00a39, and \u00a35 6s. 8d.

Early Incumbents. \u2014 In 1278, Stephen de St. George was incum bent of the first portion : Master William de Mortimer had the second portion ; Geoffrey de Bureford was incumbent of the third portion. Nash and Boraston chapels were affiliations of Burford church, but, as if independent, the church of Grete, in Burford deanery, in 1291 was valued as under \u00a34. The inquisition of 1341 takes no notice of it ; but the Valor of 1535 represents Grete as a rectory worth \u00a35 per annum. Greet chapel appears to have been transferred to Whitton.

The highly interesting British fortification known as Cainham Camp, is situated on a gentle eminence about two miles and a half south-east of Ludlow. \" It is a double camp, fortified by a high vallum, and a fosse ; the latter is only at that end where the two camps join. The entrance is at the east, and is about six paces wide. Here a good section of the vallum is obtained. Its base is as much as thirty- four y7ards wide, and the relief of the wall rises nearly twenty feet above it. On three sides the land falls somewhat precipitously. The mound is highest on the eastern side, where the slope is easiest. , At the western end of the easterly camp, there are two openings into the other. The top of the vallum of both is planted.\" ' Concerning Cainham Domesday says : \u2014 \" The same Badulf holds Caiham. Earl Morcar held it. Here viii hides geldable.

Now, that which Radulf [de Mortemer] holds is worth 40s. That which his knights hold is worth 38s.\" ' Cainham was the only manor in Overs Hundred Ralph de Mortemer held of Roger de Montgomery. Respecting the moiety of Cainham, including its member Snitton, which, in the time of the Conqueror, Ralph de Mortemer held in demesne, we learn from the French Chronicle that \" Hugh de Mortimer gave Caynham to the said abbey [of Wigmore whicli he founded] with his body,\" in anticipation, doubtless, of his burial at Wigmore.2 But Roger, his successor, challenged the title of the monks to Caynham and took from them Snitton, it being a convenient halting-place between Wigmore and Cleobury. Upon a certain occasion, however, it hapjiened that whilst jour neying between these places, Mortimer's wife, Isabel, was suddenly seized with the pangs of child-birth at Snitton. The infant died. The mother's own danger was great. Superstitious dread mingled with solemn reflection. The circumstances presented exactly that opportunity which the churchman of the middle ages was so skilled in turning to profit. In short, Isabel was led to believe that she was suffering on account of the sacrilege of her husband, when, at his wife's earnest entreaty, the baron restored Snitton to the abbey, to hold with Caynham for ever. Then the abbot of Wigmore assumed the privileges of having a gallows, and of assizing bread and beer in the manor, and retained it until the dissolution. Cainham Church. In 1291, the church of Kayham, in the deanery of Ludlow, described as the abbot of Wigmore's (it probably having been in volved in Mortimer's gift to the abbey), yielded the abbot, as rector, \u00a33 6s. 8d. ; the vicar's portion being under \u00a34. The church of Bitter ley also had a pension from Kayham. The parish was assessed only \u00a33 Os. 8d. to the ninth in 1341, because two virgates lay unfilled, etc. The Valor of 1534-5 represents this vicarage as worth \u00a34 9s. per annum, less Is. for synodals.

In 1165, the national record, called the Liber Niger, represents Boger de Esketot, a cadet of the family of Esketot, or Scotot, as holding a knight's fee, by new feoffment, under De Lacy.2 That fee was Bitterley, for we learn, from the Chartulary, that shortly afterwards, Roger de Scotot gave 4s. rent out of his mill of Butter leg to Haughmond Abbey, Hugh de Lacy, seignoral lord, con firming the grant. The Scotots afterwards appear to have dropped their original surname, and to have taken a new one from the place over which they were mesne lords. Thus, in 1255, Sir Stephen de Buterleg \"held iii hides, in Bitterley, of Dame Mar gery de Lacy, by service of one knight, and did suit to Overs Hundred.\" Sir Stephen's descendants long continued to be lords of the vill, whilst under them held under-tenants. Bitterley Church and Barish. Doubtless this church was one of those Saxon foundations whose vast parishes comprehended more than can now be determined. Like other churches of Lacy's Shropshire fief, Bitterley was charged with a pension to St. Guthlac's Priory at Hereford. Pope Nicholas' Taxation, in 1291, returns the church of Buterleye, in the deanery of Ludlowe, as worth \u00a321 6s. 8d. per annum, which sum included pensions from Cainham and Hope Bagard. The prior of Hereford also had a portion of \u00a31 10s. in Bitterley church. In 1341, the parish was taxed only \u00a39 7s. 8d. to the ninth, because four virgates lay fallow, etc. In 1534-5, this rectory was worth \u00a322 11s. 8d., upon which the charges were 30s. to the prior of St. Guthlac, \u00a31 3s. 4d. to the prior of Wenlock ; 14s. 4d. for procurations and synodals, and an average of 17s. 9d. yearly for the bishops' triennial visitation.

It was waste, and so re mains.\" 2 This wasted half hide afterwards came to be called Ledwich. In the time of Henry III , the Brior of Bromfield with drew the suit of Ledwich from Overs Hundred, and hence it came to be annexed to that of Munslow. In the Conqueror's record, the church of St. Mary's Bromfield is confused with that of St. Mary's Shrewsbury. \"Domesday,\" say the historians of Shrewsbury,3 '' was put together in London from loose notes collected in the country ; and it is highly pro bable that the officers of the exchequer, finding two sets of entries of a church of St. Mary in Shropshire, erroneously classed them together.\" To which the author of \" Antiquities of Shropshire \" adds, \" I would here remark how Domesday, that unrivalled record of facts, is instructive even in its omissions. The officers of the exchequer unhesitatingly adopted a classification which took it for granted that more than one great church dedicated to St. Mary was not to be reckoned on in a single county.

Yet this was why he gave it : Aldred, the Saxon archbishop of York, going on a mission to Rome, early in 1061, was accompanied by many noble English men, Burchard, the son of Earl Algar, being among the number. The object of their joulmey accomplished, as they passed through Rheims, on their way back to England, Burchard was seized with mortal sickness. Before he died, he asked to be buried in the abbey of St. Remigius, promising, in return, that certain lands that belonged to him should be given to that house. The monks buried the illustrious youth according to his desire, when the sorrowing father, with consent of Edward the Confessor, fulfilled his son's dying promise. Hence it came, that, at the period of the survey, besides the manor above described, the great Benedictine abbey of St. Bemigius at Bheims owned four other estates in England, all of them being of Earl Algar's gift. Silvington Church. Dedicated to St. Nicholas, this was probably originally subject to Bitterley. The Taxation of 1291 represents the church of Silvyntone, in the deanery of Ludlow, as worth less than \u00a34 per annum.

Upon the forfeiture of Earl Robert de Belesme, his seigneuries reverted to King Henry I., when he, re-arranging the Hundreds of Shropshire, Corfham, combined with Siefton and Culmington, two adjacent manors, came into the hands of Henry II. In 1155, this estate was given by Henry II. to Hugh de Periers, who, dying in 1175, it reverted to the king, when the sheriff accounted at the rate of \u00a331 per annum for Corfham, Siefton, and Culmington, as if they again constituted an estate of royal demesne, rated at so much in the county ferm. At Michaelmas, 1178, however, the sheriff described the estate as the land of Corfham, and claimed quittance for him self of the \u00a331, saying that he had delivered it up according to the king's precept ; and for twelve years, namely until 1190, a similar entry was repeated on every Pipe-Roll. What could be the reason, then, for excluding from the Pipe-Roll the name of him to whom Henry II. had made the grant ? Shame dictated the concealment of a gift, which, in truth, was but the wages of dishonour \u2014 Walter de Clifford, father of fair Rosamond, King Henry's paramour, being the grantee in question, to whom rule, belonged to the great Mercian earl Leofric, Alger, his son, and Edwin, his grandson, successively. 2 Domesday, so. 253, b 1. 1 That is, _d. out of every 3d yielded by the pleas and perquisites of the Hun dred Courts, the third penny belonging, as usual, to the earl of the county: which office, during the last years of the Saxon"], [398, "308 the king had given this demesne \" for love of Rosamond, his daughter.\" Barony of Clifford. The second son of Richard Fitz-Ponce, Walter de Clifford, probably became heir to his uncles, Walter and Drogo Fitz-Ponce, who, at the time of the Domesday survey, held manors in the various counties of Oxfordshire, Berkshire, AViltshire, Gloucester shire, Worcestershire, and Herefordshire ; and, by 1138, he had succeeded his father. Upon the accession of Henry II, Walter de Clifford received various grants from the king. He seems, how ever, to have made no return of his tenures in capite. With respect to his daughter, Fair Rosamond, she appears to have been very young when Duke Henry seduced her. But lately married to the worthless Eleanor, divorced by Louis VII. of France, it is a historical fact that the births of William and Geoffrey, the sons of Henry and Rosamond, took place between the births of William and Henry, the two eldest children of Henry and Eleanor. King Henry's marriage took place on May 18, 1152 : Prince Henry, his second legitimate son, was born February 18, 1155. In March, 1173, began that grand domestic rebellion which embittered the later years of Henry II. Shortly afterwards, his jealous queen, who had planned the whole affair, being captured by her husband, Henry kept her a close prisoner for the remaining sixteen years of his life, when Rosamond Clifford, who previously had been domiciled at Woodstock, openly became the king's paramour. But Rosamond died 1175-6, and obtaining sepulture at Godstow, Walter de Clifford, for his soul's health, and for the souls of his wife Margaret and their daughter Rosamond, with consent ofthe king and his own heirs, gave to the nuns of God stow his mill of Framton, with a meadow near by, and also his salt-pit in Wich. Dying about 1190, it is a remarkable circumstance, that Richard de Clifford's second son succeeded to Corfham and his father's Shropshire estates, by paying a fine of 300 merks to King Richard. Why did the king permit the rights of the elder brother to be ignored by such an anomalous succession ? Eyton attributes it to the anger and disgust with- which King Richard associated De Clifford's name with his mother's wrongs, so that when called on to confirm his father's grant of one of the finest crown estates in Shropshire to the heir'of the first grantee, regarding it as con nected with his father's infamous passion, he refused, although"], [399, "309 he gave it to a younger brother. In support of this, Eyton refers to the circumstance, that about two years after King Richard's accession, the body of Rosamond Clifford was, by order of a bishop of Lincoln, ignominiously expelled from Godstow church, and re buried without its walls ; yet the view which this learned writer takes of the subject hardly agrees, we think, with that extraor dinary contrition for his undutiful conduct, known to have been manifested by Richard on the death of his father ; neither does it tally with the subsequent riches and honours the king lavished upon William Longespee, son of Fair Rosamond, who obtained from Richard, in preference to all her other suitors, the rich and beautiful Ela in marriage, and the earldom of Salisbury. To return : Walter, eldest son of De Clifford, was seized, during King Richard's reign, of other estates, although not of Corfham. He was one of the lords marchers of Herefordshire, having, in 1191, custody of Knighton castle. In 1196, and in 1199, he paid scutage for lands he held in Wiltshire and Berkshire respectively. This brings us to the reign of John, by whose\" charter, dated Chambrais, August 3rd, 1199, the manor of Corfham \"as King Richard, our brother, granted and confirmed the same to Richard de Clifford, the grantee's brother, whose heir the said Walter is,\" secured by a fine of 300 merks, was confirmed to Walter de Clif ford, the ' elder brother, and his heirs. Litigation ensued, upon the ground that King Richard's previous grant had made Corf ham the appanage of a younger brother ; the result was a fine, and Richard de Clifford, for a valuable consideration, renounced all claims in favour of Walter. Secure in the possession of these Shropshire estates, one of Walter's first acts was a grant to Haughmond Abbey. For the sustenance of their kitchen and their refections in fresh fish, the successful litigant gave to the canons his mills of Culmington and Siefton, half a virgate in Siefton, etc. A courtier and a favourite of John's, Walter's name frequently appears on the rolls of that king's reign, sometimes as custos of royal castles, at another time as sheriff of Herefordshire ; one while he figures as the recipient of presents of deer from the king's forest, at another hostages and escheated lands are entrusted to his keeping ; he meanwhile, know in \u00ab\u2022 well how to take care of himself, and -secure a continuance of his worthless master's favour, by fines ; paying upon one occasion as much as 1,000 merks to King John to stifle enquiry. Walter"], [400, "310 died January 1221, when his son, Walter de Clifford, junior, suc ceeded to his estates. Ao-nes de Cundy, lady of Cavenby and Glentham, the wife of Walter de Clifford the elder, by bringing him vast estates in Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire, Essex and Kent, materially increased the importance of his house. A steadfast adherent of John's throughout his troubled reign, at length, by writ of Henry III., Walter succeeded to his paternal inheritance, his relief being fixed at \u00a3100. Annoyed at the king's infatuated partiality to foreigners, he confederated with the gallant but unfortunate Richard Marshal, when, without judgment of his court or sentence of his peers, Henry III. ordered his arrest, and gave his lands to the Poictevins. Unlike Marshal's rebellion, however, de Clifford's was of short duration, as, in 1234, having previously made peace with the king, H. de Trubleville received orders to give up Clifford castle to its lord, to whom the king had restored it. Both in 1235, and in 1236, this baron was assessed in Shropshire for the aid due on marriage of the king's sister.1 Advanced in years, and father of an only daughter then twelve years of age, a patent of April 30th, 1244, informed de Clifford of the king's desire to match the young heiress with Longespee, great-grandson of Fair Rosamond. By this marriage, William Longespee became husband of his father's second cousin, Matilda de Clifford. Longespee was killed in a tournament at Blithe in 1256. Under date\" 1250, M. Paris observes : \" Walter de Clifford, who was one, not of the least importance amongst the barons of the Welsh borders, either in power, wealth, or liberties, was accused before the king of having, in contempt of the said king, violently and improperly treated his messenger, who bore his royal letters, and having forced him to eat the same, with the seal. Walter being proved guilty of this before the king, did not dare to stand trial, but threw himself on the king's mercy, whereby he, although with difficulty, escaped death or disinheritance, but lost his liberty, and all the money he possessed or could procure, amounting to about a 1,000 merks, and was then allowed to return home without being imprisoned, on the bail of some especial securities.\" Estimated to contain 7^ hides, the manor of Corfham, in 1255, including Culmington, Siefton, and Diddlebury, was held of the Testa de Nevill, pp. 60, 61."], [401, "311 king by Sir Walter de Clifford, by service of one knight. He had a franchise here, gallows, assize of bread and beer, and held pleas of bloodshed, hue and cry, with other lesser pleas. It was Roger, the nephew of this Walter, who, in concert with Morti mer, assisted Prince Edward to escape from Hereford castle. After the decease of Walter de Clifford and his second wife, Margaret, daughter of Llewellyn, Prince of Wales, Longespee's young widow, Matilda, succeeded to the whole barony of her father, when John Giffard, of Brimsfield, took her by force from her manor-house to his castle.1 A patent of 1271 legalizing the marriage, accordingly in the Feodary of 1284, it is said, that, \" John Giffard holds the manor of Corfham by right of Matilda de Longespeye, formerly daughter and heir of Walter de Clifford, for one knight's fee.\" Giffard died in 1299, when the heirs of his first wife, Matilda de Clifford, were found to be Margery, wife of the Earl of Lincoln (to whom she had been affianced by Longespee, her father, when she was five years old), and Matilda's three daughters by John Giffard. Between these four co-heiresses, therefore, the De Clifford estates were divided, when Corfham falling to Eleanor, Giffard's second daughter, and she afterwards marrying Fulk le Strange, hence the return of March, 1316, styles him lord of Corfham. But the old barony of Clifford had fallen into an abeyance. DlDDLEBURY CHURCH. By the Domesday entry, \" the church of St. Peter holds the church of this [Corfham] manor, with one hide,\" it is meant that Diddlebury church, with its hide of land, yielded 18s. annually to Shrewsbury Abbey, to which Earl Roger de Montgomery had granted it. In the words of his charter, \" I gave,\" says the Earl, \" the church of Dudclebury, with all things which pertain thereto.\" The dispute between the Norman abbey of Seez and Shrewsbury abbey, being soldered up about 1147, among the various transfers and concessions then agreed on, the abbot of Shrewsbury gave to the abbot of Seez the church of \" Dudenebury.\" About 1236, however, the abbot and convent of Seez having felt \" great dan ger,\" as it is expressed, \" inasmuch as living in foreign parts they could not, as was right and decent, provide a fitting pastor for this church,\" they besought the Bishop of Hereford to devise 1 Dcgdai.k's Baronage, p. 500."], [402, "312 some remedial plan ; accordingly, the bishop gave Diddlebury church to his own chapter. The church of Duddelebury, in the deanery of Ludlow, was valued in 1291 at the high rate of \u00a338 13s. 4d., a portion in the church of Alberbury amounting to \u00a31 6s. 8d. also belonging to its rectory. The vicarage was then worth \u00a37 6s. 8d. per annum. In 1341, the parish was assessed at only \u00a39 to the ninth, because six carucates lay unfilled on account of various taxes which oppressed the tenants, etc. In 1534-5, the rectories of Diddlebury and Long Staunton were returned as jointly worth \u00a340 per annum ; the vicarage of Diddlebury \u00a313 6s. 8d. Out of this latter sum, 7s. 8d. went for procurations and synodals, and 17s. 9d. the annual proportion of the bishop's triennial visitation charge.

Adjoining the last named manors, in ancient times flourished the great Clee Forest, a well-wooded expanse, which, in the Saxon era, was appurtenant either to the Mercian earl's manor of Ditton, or to the Anglo-Saxon king's manor of Corfham. At the Conquest, this wood became a palatine, and afterwards one of the royal forests of Shropshire, when Henry II. giving Corfham, Culming ton, and Siefton to Walter de Clifford, along with them he gave to him the Clee Forest. Here, therefore, the Anglo-Norman seigneur exercised those rights which ordinarily belonged to royal forests, and here the lordly de Cliffords, for generations afterwards, jealously maintained their forest rights. The Forestership of Clee was claimed as their hereditary right by the Wyards, a family descending from \" Wiard the Forester,\" who trod the green glade previously to 1199. Clee Forest flourished where Loughton, in the parish of"], [404, "314 Chetton, now stands. This manor consisted of reclaimed forest land. We read that Walter de Clifford, son of Walter de Clifford and Agnes de Cundy, \"grants to Salop Abbey, in pure almoign, 120 acres of the Bosc of the said monks of Luhtone, of which the Bosc and site were already theirs, to assart, fence, and dispose of as they liked ; provided the beasts of his forest should be able to pass in and out according to the custom of the Forest ; \" upon which, doubtless, the monks industriously set to work and reduced the land thereabouts to pretty nearly its present condition. <_2l(iOJ is thus minutely described in Domesday Book : \u2014 \" The same Roger [de Lacy] holds Stantone.

An approved warrior, lands were assigned him in the west, so that he might help to restrain the Welsh ; yet what was the extent of that territory he held under William Fitz-Osbern, the first Norman Earl of Hereford, is unknown. Upon the rebellion of Fitz-Osbern's successor Earl Roger de Britolio, a vast fief was placed at the Conqueror's disposal, who conferred it upon Walter de Lacy. Walter died on March 27, 1085, in consequence of a fall received whilst superintending the building ofthe \" Church of St. Peter,\" at Hereford. A monastic record informs us that Walter gave to that monastery ten villains in ten distinct vills, of his fief, that is, he gave as much land in each instance as was held in villainage by one tenant, which accounts for the statement Domesday makes in connection with Stantone, that \" St. Peter of Hereford has here one villain.\" To Walter succeeded his son and heir \u2014 Roger de Lacy; the Domesday Baron, who at the period of the survey held no less than a hundred different manors in Shropshire, Herefordshire, Worcestershire, Gloucestershire, and Berkshire, besides the Norman fief of Lassy, which descended to him from his father, and whence his family derived its name. But Roger rebelled against Rufus and was banished in 1095. The king gave Roger's forfeited estates to his brother \u2014 Hugh de Lacy, who thereupon became seignoral lord of Stanton. Of him little is known, excepting that he greatly enriched the famous monastery of Lanthony, in that Ewias-land which Hugh had acquired by conquest. Hugh de Lacy died without issue previously to 1122, and at his decease, his estates escheated to the crown. Pagan Fitz-John, the same who, as Viceroy of Shropshire, we described as holding court at Brug castle, then occupied a portion of De Lacy's fief, by gift of Henry I. Pagan fell in a Welsh foray, pierced through the head by a spear. After him, Joceas de Dynan, by gift of Stephen, 1 Roman de Rou (Taylor) p. 220."], [406, "316 held a large portion os the Honour of De Lacy; but, about 1143, the title of \u2014 Gilbert de Lacy, nephew of the deceased baron, was recog nised by Stephen, and accordingly he became lord of Ewias. Living in a time when all law and kingly authority were in abey ance, \"a prudent man, and one of great foresight ancl activity in any military undertaking,\" as Gilbert is described to have been, could readily turn his sword to good account. We hear of him first at the court of the Empress, whose charters he attested ; when she being either unwilling or unable to fulfil his expecta tions, Lacy changed his political faith, and went over to the Usurper. Upon this, the Empress deprived him of his Norman fief, which she granted to the Bishop of Bayeux : but Stephen amply compensated Gilbert for the loss he had sustained in changing sides, by conferring on him his uncle's estates in Eng land. After winning a reputation for valour, before his death Gilbert de Lacy took upon himself the habit of a Templar and retired from the world. Dying about 1163, his son \u2014 Hugh de Lacy II. , upon his succession, obtained from King Henry II. a charter confirming Stanton Lacy, Ludlow, Ewias and other estates to him. When the order was given, in 1165-6, for every tenant in capite of the crown to return a list of all who held under him by knight's service, Hugh de Laci complied, and accordingly we find in the record called the Liber Niger, or Black Book of the Exchequer, a statement of this Shropshire Barony. As the great chief probably compiled the document himself, it merits attention. Sir Hugh considered himself entitled to the services of 58J knights' fees, whereof 53| were of old feoffment that is, had existed from the days of Henry I., and 5| of new feoffment. He had besides nine tenants who held from 6 librates down to a virgate of land, yet without any specific knights' service assessed on their tenements. Some of these lived in Sir Hush's household, some were in his Welsh mansions; and he provided the necessaries of life to both the latter classes. The return does not allude to the long forfeiture which Sir Hugh's father had suffered. This baron figures in early Irish history, as one of its Anglo- Norman conquerors. - In October, 1172, Hugh de Lacy accom panied Henry II. in his expedition to Ireland. \"The King,\" says the contemporary historian,1 \"crossed over with four hundred 1 HOVEDEN, Vol. i. p. 350. Bonn's Ed."], [407, "317 large ships, laden -with warriors, horses, arms, and provisions.\" He crossed from Milford Haven, and landed near Waterford. Having received the homage of a number of its petty kings, circumstances arose which compelled Henry II. to return to England ; \" but before he left Ireland, he gave, and by his charter confirmed, to Hugh -de Lacy the whole of the lands of Meath, with all their appurtenances ; to hold in fee and hereditarily of himself and his heirs, bv a hundred knights' service, and a-ave in his charge the city of Dublin, and appointed him Justiciary (Viceroy) of Ireland.\" 1 Meanwhile, backed by the French monarch, Prince Henry had raised the standard of revolt in Normandy, against his father, when the king recalled Hugh de Lacy from Ireland, to aid him at this critical juncture. The important frontier town of Verneuil, entrusted to his charge, was invested on July 6, 1173, by King Louis VII. of France ; yet, under the governorship of De Lacy and Beauchamp, it gallantly held out until the English monarch relieved it in person, Throughout that crisis of the king's affairs, Hugh de Lacy chivalrously adhered to him. Revisiting Ireland, however, in 1177, Hugh married a daughter of the king of Connaught, without the royal license, when Henry II. suspect ing Lacy of an intention to found an independent kingdom for himself in Ireland, viewed the matter as nothing less than high treason. A temporary escheat therefore befell the house of Lacy. On the 25th of July, 1185, Hugh de Lacy was assassinated at Durrow, in Ireland. Walter de Lacy, the eldest of the deceased baron's four sons, in 1189 had his father's lands restored to him. He paid scutage in 1194 for King Richard's redemption from his Austrian prison, being assessed at the rate of \u00a31 per fee on 51^ fees. \" During this year,\" says Stapelton, \" the ravages committed by Walter de Lacy in conjunction with John de Courcy, lord of Ulster, upon the territory of the king in Ireland, caused a seizure of his lands into the king's hands;\" and we learn, from the Pipe Roll of 1198, that \"Walter de Lacy renders account of 3,100 merks [\u00a32,066 13s. 4d.] for having the king's good-will and seizin of his lands.\" Potent, indeed, was the Anglo-Norman Lacy. His Norman fief being as great as his English, and, perhaps, as his Irish possessions. Some notion of its magnitude may be gathered 1 Hoveden, Vol. i. p. 354. Bohn's Ed."], [408, "318 from the fact, that the king's escheator actually received there from in the year before it was restored to the heir, \u00a3750 in money, besides produce in kind\u2014 grain, wine, and fish.1 When Nor mandy was severed from England, however, Lacy lost his Norman fief. Unsteady in his allegiance to King John, Lacy confederated with Braose, his father-in-law, and arrayed Meath, Ulster, and Munster against the English king. At length, in the summer of 1210, John made a campaign against the rebels in Ireland, which, being successful, closed with the outlawry and banishment of Walter and Hugh de Lacy, and of the elder Braose. They retired to France. The wife and the eldest of Braose's sons fell into the king's hands ; and tradition has it that they were starved to death in the dungeons of Windsor. It is said that Walter de Lacy and his brother took refuge in the monastery of St. Taurin, at Evreux, where for some time they maintained themselves by servile em ployments ; but at length, the abbot, discovering who they were, interceded with King John on their behalf. Gratitude for the kindness they had received at the hands of the abbot then, may have been the reason why Walter and Hugh de Lacy afterwards founded and endowed the monastery of Foure, in Ireland, a cell to the Norman abbey of St. Taurin. By payment of an enormous fine, Walter de Lacy obtained the restoration of his estates ; and, in 1215, we have many instances of the good-will and trust with which King John at last regarded this influential but often disloyal baron. One while Walter de Lacy is charged with commissions of great import in Shropshire ; at other times he is found at court with the king. King John pre sents him with a Destrier, allows him to hunt in Dean forest, gives him custody of escheated lands, and prevents him being unduly taxed; releases his brother William from a four years' prison, Walter being one of the manucaptors for his future fidelity. Even after the kingdom had practically departed from him, like other barons of the west, unmindful of former grievances, de Lacy was found loyal to King John. Addressing Walter himself, on Octo ber 10th, 1216, the king gave a tract of land in Acornbury forest to Margaret de Lacy, Walter's wife, that she might found thereon a house of religion for the souls of William de Braose her father, Matilda her mother, and William her brother, the victims of 1 Rot. Scacc. Normannitt, A.D 1 198, m. 5 dorso."], [409, "319 John's former cruelty. Lacy was on his way to the king at the time, for he transacted business for him at Lincoln on the 17th of October. On the 19th King John died. An uninterrupted good understanding appears to have existed between the lord of Stanton Lacy and Henry III., who looked upon him with confidence and favour. In 1218, Lacy's Shrop shire fees were assessed to the first scutage of Henry III. In 1221, this noble had quittance of the scutage of Biham. In the following year, and again in 1224, de Lacy was in Ireland. His brother Hugh, lord of Ulster, in concert with the men of Meath, it seems had risen in rebellion against the Anglo-Norman kins-, and Henry III. sent Walter de Lacy to subdue his own brother, and' his own vassals. Hence the writ of March 30th, 1224, enjoining the viceroy of Ireland to provide accommodation in Trim Castle for Walter de Lacy and his followers, so long as he should be in that quarter levying war on the enemies of the king and of him self. Acquitted of the scutage of Brittany, a patent of April 20th, 1230, dated at Portsmouth, names Walter de Lacy among those whose property was to be protected while they were with the king in foreign parts. The arrangement thus indicated must have been reversed, however, as Roger de Wendover informs us that, in the following July, Walter de Lacy commanded one of the divisions of that army which inflicted such signal chastisement upon the King of Connaught,when, taking advantage of the Anglo-Norman king's absence on the continent, he sought to extirpate the English from Ireland. Pre-eminent among the nobles of Ireland, blind from old age, however, and otherwise bodily afflicted, Walter de Lacy died in 1241. Walter's granddaughters, Matilda and Margaret, were his heirs, the former of whom had been given in marriage to Peter de Geneva, a Provencal favourite of Henry III. ; the latter married John de Verdon. Between these co-heiresses the manor of Stanton Lacy, and the other lands of the deceased baron, therefore, were divided, when Ludlow castle, de Lacy's chief residence, fell to Peter de Geneva. The Provencal did not long enjoy the honour ; for, dying, Matilda de Lacy re-married to Geoffrey de Genevill or Joinville, who accordingly, in right of his wife, became lord of Ludlow and the Irish castle of Trim. John de Verdon, also, had military summonses as a baron marcher of Shropshire, who, loyally adhering to Henry III., when the confederate lords leagued against"], [410, "320 their king, his Warwickshire castle of Brandon was demolished by the barons. Upon the return of peace, John de Verdon accompanied Prince Edward, as a crusader to the Holy Land. He died in 1274. The Feodary of 1316 describes Roger de Mortimer, Earl of March, who married Johanna, granddaughter of Geoffrey de Genevill and Matilda de Lacy, as lord of Stanton juxta Ludlow.1 Stanton Lacy appears formerly to have been free from all hundredal subjection, hence the public records supply but scant information respecting this manor. Its seigneural lords claimed to have a gallows, to hold pleas of bloodshed and hue and cry, and to assize beer ; also to try, under writ of right, all civil causes within their jurisdiction. Stanton Lacy Church. Previously to 1084, Walter de Lacy gave two-thirds of the tithes of Stanton to his monastery of St. Peter, at Hereford, the remaining third was probably retained for the parochial church. Early in the 12th century, how ever, the advowson must have been given by Hugh de Lacy I. to Lanthony, in Monmouthshire, as in the Taxation of 1291, the prior of Lanthony is described as being rector of Stantone Lacy, in the deanery of Ludlow, his interest here amounting to no less a sum than \u00a336 13s. 4d. per annum ; the vicar's portion was \u00a311 extra. In 1341, the parish was taxed only \u00a310 to the ninth.

Theodoric de Say, living in the reign of Henry I., appears to have been a cadet of that baronial house, whose ancestor, Picot de Say, was lord of Clun at Domesday. To Theodoric succeeded Helias de Say, who attested Philip de Belmeis' grant to Buildwas Abbey in 1138-9. Helias is presumed to have been father of Hugh de Say, who, becoming Lacy's vassal in this manor, gave Stokesay Church to Haughmond Abbey, his seigneural lord confirming the grant. To him succeeded Helias de Say IL, who, previously to 1224, for the souls of Amicia his wife, Hugh de Say his father, and Olympias his mother, gave the mill of Stoke and Wetlington to Haughmond Abbey.

Upon his decease, Hugh de Say, his nephew, became lord of Stokesay, who gave the manor in exchange for property in Ireland to his suzerain, John de Verdon. In short, alienating all or nearly all his property, de Say settled in Ireland, and hence it arose that his descendants are not afterwards heard of in connec tion with this place. John de Verdon, then, was. lord of the fee-simple of Stokesay, being duly registered in the Inquisition of 1255 as lord of Stoke Say, Wetliton, and Neuton. This co-heir of Lacy held the manor of the general estate of Lacy. He held Stokesay by service of two knishts, due at Ludlow Castle. The manor also owed the service of one knight in ward of Montgomery castle, in time of war, for forty clays. Sir John de Verdon had for tenant here Reginald de Grey, whose son again, about 1281, conveyed the whole manor to Laurence de Ludlow, who thereupon came into full possession of Stokesay. In the feodary of 1284, Laurence de Ludlow is said to hold the vill of Stokesay, for one knight's fee, under John de Grey, which John held it under Theobald de Verdon, who, in turn, held of the king. It was Laurence de Ludlow who obtained licence from King Edward I., in 1290-1, to strengthen his mansion with a wall of stone, and lime, and to crenellate or embattle the same. The remains of this fortified manor-house are now known as Stokesay Castle, an extremely interesting relic. Stokesay Church.

Lawton. Not mentioned in Domesday, this place now forms one township with Little Sutton, with which from ancient times it has been associated. Like Little Sutton, Lawton, in the twelfth century had become a serjeantry, held in capite by the Basker villes, who held estates not only in Shropshire, but in Herefordshire and Northamptonshire. The serjeantry by which Lawton was held varied. In 1211, the duty of its tenant was to provide one serving-man, with a lance, for the king's army of Wales.2 Ac cording to the Munslow Jurors, Lawton was held in 1255 by serjeantry of the king ; the service due being to find one archer, with bow and arrows, for fifteen days, in time of any Welsh war, at the tenant's cost. dPtytBiOtt. \" The same William holds Merstun.

The lords of Castle Holgate, Herbert's successors, had lost the seig neury over this manor by 1165 ; as in that year, Herbert de Castellis, the then lord of Castle Holgate, is returned by Hugh de Lacy as holding two fees of new feoffment in his barony. Great Sutton, including Wichcott, constituted one of these fees which Herbert held by service at Ludlow castle. The lords of Castle Holgate continued to hold under the heirs of Lacy, until, about 1257, the Earl of Cornwall having purchased the Shropshire estates of the former, he alienated the whole to the Knights Templars, who accordingly became lords of Sutton and Wichcott.

Turstin, mentioned above, perhaps, was that Turstin de Wig more, whom Ralph de Mortemer removed from Cleobury, giving him, it is not unlikely, Huntington and other manors in exchange. If so, Turstin, as appears from Domesday, was a man of great connections and wealth. He took his distinctive appellation of de Wigmore probably from something which he held in the Chatellany of Wigmore. His wife's great uncle, Osbern, was one of those Norman favourites whom the weak Edward the Confessor enriched at the expense of his own English subjects. Alured de Merleberge, his father-in-law, figures in the Conqueror's survey as holding manors in Surrey, Hants, Somersetshire, Herefordshire, and Wiltshire ; and Turstin himself at the time of the survey, besides Huntington, had considerable tenures elsewhere ; one of them, Merchelai, being held by him under Turstin Fitz-Rolf, or Rollo, the same who bore Duke William's gonfalon at the battle of Hastings. Genealogists affirm that Turstin de Wigmore was ancestor of the great Herefordshire family of Lingen ; and it is certain that ' J'omesdav, so. ?6o, a?. rial record and Bovarii [neat-herds] 2 This word is underlined in the origi- written over it in correction. 3 Domesday, so. 256, b 2."], [425, "329 the Lingens held in the thirteenth century, under the Mortimers, the identical manors, Huntington among the number, which Turstin had held in the eleventh. The following apparently well-attested tale of female devotion is recorded of a member of the house of Lingen : \u2014 In the year 1253 a marriage took place between Grimbald, son and heir of Richard Pauncefort, and Constantia, daughter of John Lingayn, which was celebrated amid such circumstances as could only be expected between families of the first rank and opulence. Impelled by the general enthusiasm of the age, Grimbald joined in the expedition against the Mahommedans of Tunis, but being taken prisoner, a joint of his wife was demanded by the Moorish captor as the only price of his liberty. Possibly the fame of the lady's beauty may have suggested to the swarthy heathen this cruel ransom ; yet, urged by affection for her husband, and perhaps by zeal in what was deemed a sacred cause, Constantia did not hesi tate to comply with the proposed terms, and cutting off her left hand above the wrist, she sent it to her husband in Africa. Grimbald accordingly was released, and returned home to that wife whose heroic love had saved him. When they died, Grim bald and his lady were buried at the east end of the south aisle of Cowarne church, and an altar with their effigies erected over them. The crusader's monumental figure habited like that of an Anglo- Norman knight reposed cross-legged, whilst his lady's exhibited her left arm couped above the wrist. Only some dispersed frag ments of this sculptured record of woman's love now remain ; but the following is Mr. Silas Taylor's account of it, who examined it in the 16th century : \u2014 \" To gainsay the report about it, I dili gently viewed the accord which might have been between the two figures : the female laid next the wall of the south aisle, on her right side, by which means his left side might be contiguous to her right, the better to answer the figure ; also, the stump of the woman's arm is somewhat elevated, as if to attract notice ; and the hand and wrist,, cut off, are carved close to his left side, with the right hand on his armour, as if for note.\" : tlp^ Following its notice of Huntington, comes this entry in Domesday : \u2014 \" The same Radulf holds here- 1 MS.

To speak of Estune as repre sented by these manors ; Henry I. probably granted the manorial estate to Richard Banastre, a man who, standing high in provin cial importance, as lord of Munslow and Aston Munslow, appears to have held them in capite of the king. To him succeeded Thurstan Banaster, his son, in whom or else his successor of the same name ended the elder male line of this house (1154 \u2014 1189). Thurstan left as his co-heirs two daughters, Margery wife of Richard Fitz Roger, and Matilda wife of William de Hastings. Barony of Hastings. William de Hastings' uncle Ralph, steward (dapifer or dispen sator) in Queen Eleanor's household, appears to have enjoyed, in a high degree, the favour of Henry II. , and to Ralph's estate, and also the great domains in Leicestershire, Warwickshire, Bucks, and Middlesex, of Erneburga de Flamville his own mother, William became heir. Considered in respect to the lands he also acquired with his wife, the daughter of Banaster, de Hastings therefore was a great holder, and his descendants heirs to a large inherit ance. Yet, notwithstanding his riches, William was cut off in his prime. Matilda, his wife, survived him forty years. Of this noble's eldest son Henry, it is told by Brakelond, how, on the 1st of April, 1182, the youth, led by his uncle,2 who had him under his protection, and surrounded by a brilliant retinue of knights, proudly appeared before the abbot and monks of St. Edmundsbury, to claim that hereditary office of seneschalcy held by his ancestors ; but the good abbot objecting to the incompetency of the youth, a 1 Domesday, so. 255, a 1.

In 1190, the young baron followed King Richard to Palestine ; a scutage on the fees he held under St. Edmundsbury in 1191 excusing him on that account. De Hastings fell a victim to crusading zeal ; at any rate, he was dead without issue in 1194, as in that year his brother William offered 100 merks for his relief of the lands and serjeantry of said Henry. It was this William de Hastings III. who married Margery, daughter of Roger Bigod, the great Earl of Norfolk. De Hast ings attended the parliament at Lincoln in November, 1200, when William, King of Scots, did homage to King John for the territory he held in England of the English king. A Feodary of St. Ed mundsbury ofthe same 3rear gives William de Hastings as holding five knight's fees under the abbey, but as he sided with the barons against King John, a writ, of April 10th, 1216, ordered the con stable of Norwich to destroy William's castles and lay waste his lands, whilst Another writ gave up to the abbot of St. Edmund's all lands the rebel held in his fee. Dying on January 28th, 1226, the deceased baron's son and heir, Henry, had livery for a fine of 50 merks of his lands. Under 1240, we find Henry de Hastings enrolled as tenant in capite of one-fourth of a knight's fee in Eston and Mosselawe, and cotemporary notices of his tenures under the Crown, the Earls Ferrars, the Lords Marmion, and others in different counties ; some of which lands descended to him from his father, whilst others accrued to him by his marriage with Ada, youngest sister and co-heir of John Scot, the great Earl of Huntingdon. To treat more particularly of Munslow and Aston : \u2014 In 1167, being then held under Matilda Banaster and her husband by Robert Fitz Walkeline, these vills were amerced half a merk and one merk respectively by Alan de Nevill, justice of the forest. In 1255, William de Venables was mesne-lord of Munslow, holding it of Henry de Hastings. In 1316, Robert de Beek, enrolled as lord of Munslow and Aston, appears to have been Hastings, immediate tenant in Munslow. The Hertwalls were Hastings' tenants at Aston ; whilst John de Aston, Thomas de Munslow, and others of a lower degree, held under one or other of the greater tenants of Munslow and Aston.

Among the tenants were Inard the priest and his wise, who, curiously enough, are both entered as participating in the privileges of this monastic and military order, being charged 6d. aud 4d. respectively. In 1187, and again in 1200, the vill of Cardington was amerced for waste by the justices of the forest, but, acting on their charter in the following year, the Templars obtained a king's writ ordering their acquittance. Immunities which, for 150 years, the Templars enjoyed in the manor of Cardington, however, came to an end on the suppression of that corrupted order by the Council of Vienna in ,1311, when the farms and manors it possessed throughout Europe, by an edict of Pope Clement V., passed to the Hospitallers, excepting those estates which reverted to the heirs of the donors. Of such, many were in England, and among them Cardington, as we read that \" the knights [Hospitallers] granted it to Edmund Fitz Alan, Earl of Arundel,\" the heir in question, who accordingly figures in the territorial survey of 1316 as \" lord of the vill of Cardington.\" Cardington Church and Parish. Cardington, even in the time of the Conqueror, was an extensive parish. Its church, very ancient, was held by the Templars, who had the rectory, as well as the advowson of its vicarage, to whom as belonging, in 1291, the church of Cardynton, in the deanery of Wenlock, was valued at \u00a313 6s. 8d., the vicar's portion being \u00a34 per annum additional ; and it was exempt from the tenths paid by English parochial churches, at that period, to the Roman see. In 1341, the parish was taxed only \u00a35 to the ninth, owing to non cultivation of lands, murrain among sheep, etc. The rectorial value of this church is not mentioned in the Valor of 1534-5, but the vicarage was then worth \u00a36 10s., less 7s. 8d. for procurations and synodals.

As the palm did not grow in England, branches of box-tree were invariably used as a substitute.

One of them, Spirtes by name, had alone x hides. But when he was banished from England, King Edward gave these x hides to Robert Fitz-Wimarch, as to a canon. But Robert gave the same land to a certain son-in-law of his, which thing, when the [other] canons had shown td the king, forthwith [the king] ordered that the land should revert to the church, only delaying till, at the court of the then approaching Christmas, he should be able to order Robert to provide other land for his son-in-law.

This land Robert now holds under Earl Roger, and it is wraste and was found waste. One part with another, the arable land is sufficient to employ liiii ox-teams.\" Nigel or Nihel, the clerk alluded to in this interesting extract, was physician to Earl Roger de Mont gomery. Spirtes lived in the reigns of two Anglo-Danish kings, namely, Harold and Hardacanute, and also in the time of the Anglo-Saxon king, Edward the Confessor. Whether the circum stance that Spirtes had been a favourite with the sons of Canute ' Domesday, so. 2J2, b 2."], [435, "337 indicates a Danish descent in him or not, we cannot tell ; but, for some cause or other, Edward the Confessor banished him. Robert Fitz-Wimarch, to whom, upon the banishment of Spirtes, King Edward gave the ten hides of Bromfield, is presumed to have been identical with Robert the deacon, that Norman eccle siastic whose daughter Richard Scrob married; and doubtless the un-named son-in-law of the Domesday entry just quoted w=as Scrob. When, in 1052, the English, at the instigation of Earl Godwin, insisted upon the banishment of the Norman favourites of Edward the Confessor, exceptions were made in favour both of Robert, the deacon and his son-in-law, who were indulgently suffered to re main in the land that had enriched them. The canons of St. Mary objecting, as it seems, to the alienation by Robert Fitz-Wimarch of half this, their manor, laid the matter before Edward the Confessor, when the Basileus \" ordered that the land should revert to the Church, only delaying till, at the court of the then approaching Christmas, he should be able to order Robert to provide other land for his son-in-law. \" But the king himself,\" continues Domesday, \" died during those very festal days.\" At reading these words, the circumstances attending the demise of the king alluded to are recalled to memory. Edward the Confessor wore, as was his wont, his crown, on the solemn festival of Christmas, at London, in the year 1065, when, attacked by more than ordinary ailment, the king ordered that church which, some years previously, in performance of a vow he had commenced to build in the \" Isle of Thorns,\" at once to be dedi cated to St. Peter, for he felt that he was dying. Three days after wards, on the 28th of December, 1065, accordingly, Westminster Abbey was consecrated. As he drew near his end, weakly in mind as in body, strange visions appeared to the sick Edward. Singular premonitions of hostile invasions scared the distraught intellect of the Confessor. \" The Lord has bent His bow ; the Lord has prepared His sword ; He brandishes it like unto a warrior ; He manifests His anger in steel ancl flame,\" exclaimed involuntarily the king, and Edward's pale face, upon which now fast settled the death-dew, flushed with unwonted excitement, as, with sightless eyes and relaxed grasp, he sank back on his pillow exhausted. The archbishop Stigand smiled at what he considered merely the ravings of dotage ; yet many who stood around were apprehensive of the truth of the dying monarch's predictions : fears and alarms being then un- z"], [436, "338 accountably rife throughout England. Who may tell what anxious what remorseful thoughts pressed upon the brain of the expiring Edward, in that hour of Nature's weakness ? Conscious of having aroused the hyena passions of the warlike Norman, who indeed shall unravel the entangled skein of his reflections, as, perturbed for the future of his unfortunate kingdom, the childless Confessor king fast hastened to his account. After having reigned twenty three years, six months, and twrenty days, he died on Twelfth-Day Eve, January 5th, 1066, and on Twelfth-Day, in the Minster which so recently he had caused to be hallowed, amid \" bitter grief,\" they buried the last legitimate Anglo-Saxon king. So much for what passed in \"those very festal days\" spoken of in the Domesday entry relating to Bromfield. iSromfidtr priori) The Saxon and collegiate church of St. Mary of Bromfield after the conquest became a regular monastic institution ; and the fact that Osbert, Prior of Bromfield, attested about 1115 an ordinance of the Viceroy de Belmeis, proves that a change had taken place in the Saxon constitution of this church by that date. Owing to the non-existence of any Bromfield Chartulary, little is known concerning the history of this religious establishment ; yet certain it is, that very early in the reign of Henry II. Bromfield had become a Benedictine Priory, subject to Gloucester Abbey, and so it continued until the dissolution. The manor of Bromfield and its members, Burway, Clay Felton, Rye Felton, Whitbatch, Halford, and Dinechope, appear to have been held in demesne by the monks. Pope Nicholas' Taxation, in 1291, gives the following estimate of the Prior of Bromfield's income, as lord of this manor : \u2014 Eight carucates of land yielded \u00a34 per ann.

Little Bromfield, Little Halton, Hill Halton, and Oak ley, appear to have been members of Bromfield, alienated how ever by very early feoffment. The interesting chapel of Halford bespeaks great antiquity, yet the first recorded notice of it is in the Valor of 1534-5, where its chaplain is described as receiving \u00a32 from the prior of Bromfield for his services. Shropshire, at the time of the Conqueror's survejT, contained several members which are now in Herefordshire : on the contrary, the Domesday Herefordshire included some places which are now in Shropshire. The latter applies to the greater part of the territory once attached to Richard's Castle, that stronghold which Richard Scrupe founded in Herefordshire, where the vill of Richard's Castle to this day remains. The Shropshire constituent of the honour of Richard's Castle in 1255 contained five hides, which, collectively called the Franchalimot of fVollerton,'was divisible into the following distinct estates : \u2014 Wollerton, Overton, Ashford Bowdler, Batchcott, Mora now Moor Park, Turford, and White broc, all of which were held by different tenants of the ancient lords of Richard's Castle. Jfltd.OUI. As being situated also in Cutestorn Hundred, Herefordshire, a manor is described in Domesday as follows : \u2014 \" The same Osbern [Fitz Richard] holds [of the king] Lude, and Roger de Laci [holds it] of him. Saisi held it [in Saxon times]. Here ii hides geldable. In demesne are ii ox-teams, and one villain, a bailiff [prepositus], and a smith with ii teams. [The manor] was worth 25s. [annually in Saxon times] ; now 30s,\" ' 1 Domesday, so. iSsi, b 2"], [440, "340 4 The mention of a provost and a smith, coupled with the improved value of the manor, although they might not suggest, vet they tally with the notion of an existent borough, or intended residence of a great feudal chief. At any rate, the above is the only entry in Domesday likely to refer to the now parliamentary. borough of Ludlow. Authorities of note ' interpret the name Ludlow as Leobe-hl\u00e6f, Leode-hl\u00e6w, the tumulus, grave or hill of the people. Eyton2 supposes rather that the original vill was called Lude from some adjacent ford of the river Teme, and that after Domesday Ludlow got its distinctive name from the low or tumulus which was a pro minent feature of the town. Osbern Fitz Richard's seigneury over Lude was soon transferred to his potent tenant Roger de Lacy, who built Ludlow Castle. The foundation of Ludlow has been ascribed to Earl Roger de Montgomery ; 3 jet it can be shown from Domesday that the territory upon which that fortress was erected, did not belong to him. Considering, therefore, that close to Ludlow, on the north west, lay Lacy's enormous manor of Stanton, in whose hundred of Culvestan this baron also had other great interests ; add, that Roger de Lacy had no castle in Shropshire, and that Ludlow became the seat of his successors, and it will appear extremely probable that this baron reared Ludlow castle. This first-class Anglo-Norman fortress would appear to have sprung into existence between the years 1086, when Domesday does not mention it, and the year 1095, when Roger de Lacy was banished. Ludlow castle then had for its lord, Hugh de Lacy, brother of the exiled baron, and afterwards it appears to have been entrusted by Henry I. to the keeping of Pagan Fitz- John, in whose time it is probable that its bulwarks had more than once to withstand the attack of the exasperated Welsh. The Welsh managed to kill the \"Lord of Ewias \" at last, when King Stephen, seizing Lud low7, appointed Joceas de Dynan to be its castellan. But Joceas rebelled against his benefactor ; and Stephen, after his visit to Worcester in state on April 30th, 1139, diverged to Ludlow, when, rearing two counter-forts against the castle, he laid siege to it.4 The generally accurate Norman chronicler tells how the Scottish Prince Henry, then with the usurper, riding under the walls of 1 Wright's /arf/cro, p.13- 2 Antiq. of Shropshire, vol. 5, p. 238. 3 Hist, of Fulk Fitz Ifariue (Walton Club, 1855), p.3. * * Florence of Worcester, p. 267. Bohn's Ed'"], [441, "341 Ludlow was seized by an iron grapple, which the besieged flung out, and being dragged from his horse, would have been hauled into the castle had not Stephen daringly rescued him. It does not appear that the brave usurper succeeded in reducing Ludlow. . The early history of Ludlow, meagre and unsatisfactory, is somewhat relieved by the following : \u2014 \" War arose between Sir Hugh de Mortimer and Sir Joce de Dinan, then lord of Ludlow, insomuch that this same Joce could not freely or at pleasure enter or quit his castle of Ludlow for fear of Sir Hugh, so pertinaciously the latter pursued the war. And because Joce could prevail nothing against Sir Hugh by force ; he set spies along the roads where he heard that Sir Hugh was to pass unattended, and took him and held him in his castle in prison, until he had paid his ransom of three thousand merks of silver, besides all his plate and his horses and birds (hawks).\" 1 The Fitz AVarine chronicle con firms the truth of this story when it speaks of Sir Joce de Dynan, lord of Ludlow, \" mounting the highest tower in the third bail of the castle, which is now called by many Mortimer. And it has the name of Mortimer for this reason, that one of the Morti mers was in it a good while imprisoned.\" 2 The circumstance alluded to took place before the accession of Henry II. in 1154, more than seven hundred years ago ; yet still, Mortimer's tower, is pointed out among the ruins of Ludlow castle. Tradition dwells also upon a sanguinary feud between the lord of Ludlow and the lord of Ewias, \" for which discord many a good knight and many a brave man lost his life ; for each invaded the other, burnt their lands, plundered and robbed their people, and did much other damage One summer's day, sir Joce rose early in the morning, and ascended a tower in the middle of his castle, to survey the country ; and he looked towards the hill which is called Whitcliff, and saw the fields covered with knights, squires, sergeants, and valets, some armed on their steeds, some on foot ; and he heard the horses neigh, and saw the helms glittering. Among whom he saw the banner of Sir Walter de Lacy, blazing new with gold, with a fess of gules across. Then he called his knights, and ordered them to arm and mount their steeds, and take their arblasters and their archers, and go to the bridge below the town of Dynan, and defend the bridge and the ford that none passed it. Sir Walter and his people thought to pass safely ; but 1 Wrights History of Lu dime, p.113. ! History of Fulk Fitz Warine, p.34."], [442, "342 the people of Sir Joce drove them back, and many on both sides were wounded and killed. At length came Sir Joce and his banner, all white with silver, with three lions passant, of azure, crowned with gold; with five hundred with him, knights and servants on horse and foot, besides the burgesses and their servants who were good. Then, with great force, Joce passed the bridge, and the hosts encountered body to body. Joce struck Godebrand, who carried the banner of Lacy, through the body with a spear. Then the Lacy lost his banner. Then the people exchanged blows, and many on both sides were slain. But the Lacy had the worst ; for he went off flying and discomfited, and took his way beside the river of Teme. The lady, with her daughters and her other damsels, had ascended a tower, whence they saw all the battle, and prayed God devoutly, to save their lord and his people from hurt and defeat.\" Distinguishing De Lacy by his coat-of-arms, flying all alone, Joce struck spurs into his steed and overtook him, when Lacy, seeing nobody but Joce, turned, and fought him. Partizans of both soon joined in the fray. At length, after a desperate encounter, in which the Lacy bravely defended himself, he was taken, and led over the river to Ludlow. The knight's wounds were seen to, and Lacy being carried \" into a tower which is called Pendover,\" there he was guarded with great honour. De Lacy, however, escaped from his prison, and captured by stratagem the stronghold in which he had been imprisoned ; when a savage struggle ensuing, Dynan or Ludlow was burnt, half destroyed, and so forth.1 Upon the suspected treason of Hugh de Lacy in 1181, Henry II. laid hands on Ludlow Castle, and it continued to remain in manu regis until after 1190, as in that year the sheriff of Shropshire charged \u00a310 9s. 8d. for storing it with corn, oats, bacon, and wine, ancl had paid, under authority of the Chancellor Longchamp, to Gilbert de Essartis 100s. for custody of the castle. Walter, son of Hugh de Lacy, had not long recovered possession of Ludlow when King Richard, and afterwards King John, held in their hands both Ludlow town and castle, apparently as a security for the fealty of their potent lord. In 1212, \" the castle and vill of Luddellawe, with their appurtenances,\" were still in the hands of King John, but upon November 2nd, 1214, John sent to the sheriff of Herefordshire the following characteristic writ : \u2014 \" The King to 1 History of Fulk Fitz Warine, p. 24 and following."], [443, "p 342 LUDLOW CASTLE"], [444, ""], [445, "343 Engelard de Cygon, greeting. What thou reportest thyself to have done in the matter of the swine is well done ; and, although it may be better worth while to restore the castle of Ludelawe [to Lacy] than to pay 40 merks per annum for its custody, yet keep you the said castle in our hand, and let Walter de Lacy have the vill according to the agreement between him and us, because we don't wish to flinch from the said agreement.\" ' At length, on April 12th, 1215, King John ordered Engelard to deliver up to \"our faithful and beloved Walter de Lacy his castle of Ludlow,\" ancl the leal-hearted western lord- marcher stood by the ill-fated king to the last. A patent of Henry III., dated at Worcester 5th of July, 1223, offers safe conduct to Lewellyn, Prince of Wales, if he will meet the king at Ludlow, but the Cymrian prince rejected the offer. Eyton draws attention to a charter 2 of Walter de Lacy, dated at Trim, Ireland, 1st August, 1234, in which that great Irish lord concedes to Wdliam de Lucy, for his homage and service, the sene schalship of his English possessions, and in consideration of certain land which the baron gave him, \" William and his heirs were to be constables of Lodelawe castle, which they should keep, or cause to be kept, at their own cost for ever. They were further to maintain a chaplain, a porter, and two sentinels there, as they had been maintained aforetime. This was to be the rule when the grantor or his heirs proposed to make any short stay at Ludlow castle ; but in time of hostility, the grantor and his heirs should garrison the castle, and the grantee and his heirs should remain in the outer bailey, so long as such garrison should be there. The grantee and his heirs were further to take, in the grantor's absence, such rates, taxed upon bread and beer, in the vill of Lude lawe, as the grantor had been accustomed to take, or could lawfully take, when present. The repairs which William de Lucy and his heirs were to do at the wails and dwellings of the castle were to be at the grantor's cost, under view (i.e. valuation) of two lawful men of the vill. The grantee and his heirs should have fuel from the same bosc, as former constables. If William or his heirs, by command of the grantor or his heirs, should go any whither on the grantor's territory to hold a court, to audit accounts, or expedite other of the grantor's affairs, they should be provided in all neces saries of food and drink for themselves and five horses. Further, 2 Dugdale's MSS., K. so. 19. 1 Claus. I., 173.\""], [446, "344 the grantor would provide, for the grantee and his heirs male, all garments and accoutrements as for a knight of his own house hold,\" etc. Among the witnesses to this charter were Sir Richard, Bishop of Meath, Sir Geoffrey de Marisco (late viceroy of Ireland), Symon and Almeric de Lascy, Hugh de Stanton then chancellor to Walter de Lacy, and William de Ponte, clerk, the notary who drew up the deed. It was attested by the grantor's seal, charged with a simple fesse, the well-known cognizance of his house. As in the case of Bridgnorth and other fortresses, services of castle- guard were due at Ludlow from neighbouring manors ; for instance, two virgates in Wigley were held by Robert Duvile by service of fifteen days' ward in the tower of Ludlow castle in war time. About 1264-5, Simon de Montfort, backed by Lewellyn, is said to have reduced Ludlow castle ; but ere Evesham was fought the royalists had recaptured it. The donjon or keep of Ludlow, the oldest part of the castle, was built, says Wright, probably soon after the year 1090. \"This massive tower, which rises to the height of 110 feet, is a very fine example of the style which was introduced by Bishop Gundulf, as it is seen at Rochester.\" i The keep of Ludlow has, however, sustained several alterations since it was first erected. The original entrance was on the first floor at the east turret, and as a precau tionary measure it was probably approached by a flight of steep steps running down by the side of the tower. The old entrance still exists, but its inconvenience being felt in the 15th century, the steps were taken away and a hew entrance worked in the mass of the wall, with a doorway of the time of Henry VIII., leading by a flight of steps to the first floor, and opening into the chief room of the keep-, at the foot of the newel staircase, which rims up the northern turret, and formed the communication between the different floors and the top of the tower. Under neath was the great dungeon or vault, which appears originally to have been approached by a passage descending in the mass of the wall from the old entrance. In later times, a door was made in the north-east side, on a level with the ground. Most of the windows and doorways of the keep of Ludlow, display the round Norman arch. The castle appears to have been completed by Joce de Dynan, in the reign of Henry I., when it 1 Wright's History of Ludlow, p.86."], [447, "LUDLOW CASTLE, INTERIOR. p. 344,"], [448, ""], [449, "345 probably covered the same ground as at present. It consisted of three wards : first, the keep, or last stronghold in case of extremity ; secondly, the castle properly so-called, or the mass of buildings within the inner moat round what is now popularly termed the inner court ; thirdly, the large court without, also surrounded by strong walls and towers, and a moat. Into this court it was that the townsmen, with their property, the cattle, and the neighbour ing peasantry were w*ont to hurry for shelter whenever a hostile invasion took place. The place of one of the fosses or moats is now occupied by walks on the side of the town. The opposite side of the castle being reared upon the verge of a precipitous rock, was not so liable to attack, consequently it did not require the protection of a moat. The chapel of St. Mary Magdalene, Ludlow Castle, seems to have been built in the reign of Henry I. All that now remains of it is the nave, a circular building, similar to the round church at Cambridge, and the Temple church, London. Ludlow chapel is entered from the west by a richly-decorated Norman doorway. Opposite is a large and beautifully-ornamented Norman arch, which once formed the entrance into the choir, now, alas ! entirely destroyed. The circular structure still existing has three senii circularly headed Norman windows : the arcade within is formed by round arches, having alternate plain and zigzag mouldings resting on small pillars with indented capitals. This chapel is a very noble monument of the period at which it was erected. The Borough or town of Ludlow, existent long before the Conquest, in point of antiquity ranks second only to Shrewsbury. This can be proved by a very satisfactory species of historical evidence, namely, the evidence of coins. Coins stamped Lud, Luda, or Lude, were struck by authorised Ludlow moneyers in the reigns of Edgar (A.D. 959), Edward IL, Ethelred IL, Canute, Harold I., and Edward the Confessor. Shrewsbury had its moneyers as early as the reign of the Anglo-Saxon King Athel stane (A.D. 925). Excepting the notice in Domesday of the prepositus reeve or bailiff resident at Lude, no further allusion is made to the borough of Ludlow until the reign of Henry III., when there is more than one notice of it. The insignificance of Ludlow during the 12th century is evident from the circumstance, that it possessed no religious house before the reign of King John. In 1187, Robert Marmion and his associates visiting Shropshire"], [450, "346 amerced Herbert, provost of Ludelaw, \u00a35, because he had not produced before the justices a certain money-forger who had lodo-ed in his borough. Licensed minting in Ludlow ceased about the reign of William I. : to judge, however, from the number of cases of monej^forging connected with the early history of Lud low, some of its former inhabitants appear to have been loth to part with their ancient craft.- At the assize of 1203, the vill of Ludelawe appeared as an inde pendent liberty. In the reign of John, there was a bridge at Ludford, which is mentioned in charters of Henry III. : it was known by the name (pontem de Temede) Teme bridge. A patent, issued on December 17th, 1232, conferring facilities for a plan of enclosing the town of Ludlow with a wall, and in 1260, Geoffrey de Genevill was empowered to levy customs or murage for five years towards walling Ludlow. Patents for murage at Ludlow also occur in 1267, 1272, 1280, 1285, 1290, 1294, 1301, and 1304. Ludlow appears to have enjoyed the usual privileges of free boroughs. Its corporate body of themselves discharged certain responsibilities which, in unchartered towns, presented an excuse for the interference of the sheriff, escheator, or other officers of the crown. The men of Ludlow had the privilege of buying and selling at Montgomery without paying any toll. We search in vain, however, for any detailed account of the customs and privi leges formerly exercised by the municipality of Ludlow. One of the first things that engaged the attention of Edward I. after his return from Palestine, was to put a check upon that spirit of lawlessness which had been fostered by the weak rule of his father Henry III. For this purpose, King Edward caused inquisitions to be made throughout the hundreds in every county ; and the results which have been preserved in the Hundred Rolls present us with numerous instances of the insecurity of person as well as property at that period. The jealousies between the feudal lords and the towns, and even between one town and another, gave rise to frequent scenes of violence. The townsmen of Ludlow appear to have been freqtiently ill-treated by the retainers of the lords of Wigmore and Corfham. One day, the foresters of Wig more seized on Elias Millar of Ludlow on the highway between Ludlow and the Sheet, and took from him his sword and bow, and having tied his hands behind him, led him thus to Steventon, where they further extorted two shillings from him and then let"], [451, "347 him go.1 On another occasion, as the bailiffs of Castle Holgate were bringing six quarters of oats towards Ludlow, as they passed by Corfham, they were attacked on the high road by the bailiff's of John Giffard of Corfham, who, leading the horses into the demesne of their lord, sowed the oats and harrowed the ground with the horses that had carried them. We read also that at another time, as a cart of John Giffard, lord of Corfham, was passing through Ludlow, it smashed a chaldron belonging to Richard de Olreton, one of the burgesses, when the carter, not having wherewith to pay for the damage, left one of his horses in pledge. No sooner did the constable of Corfham hear of this, however, than he ordered the cattle of dame Sibd de Olreton to be seized, and he detained them eight days till Richard de Olreton (who was probably her husband), not only gave up the horse but consented to pay a fine of 60s., 45s. 7d. of which he was obliged to pay down, apparently all the ready money he could procure. Again, we are told by these rolls, that the constable of Wigmore seized forty head of cattle belonging to burgesses of Ludlow, as they were passing through the barony of Clun from Montgomery fair ; and, driving them to Wigmore castle, he detained for a piece of cloth of a woman of Wigmore, which he pretended had been cut and sold in the town of Ludlow. SuGh was the state of justice at the period alluded to on the border. Foremost among the wealthy burgesses of Ludlow, stood Laurence de Ludlow, founder of the prosperous family of Ludlow. He flourished towards the close of the 13th century. Acquiring enormous wealth, as a Ludlow clothier, Laurence then exchanged his mercantile for a territorial importance, and became lord of the castle and manor of Stokesay. The following names occur as burgesses of Ludlow in Edward the First's time. Robertus Clericus (the clerk) ; Rogerius Mone tarius (the coiner or money-dealer) ; Reginaldus le Ftilur (the fowler) ; Elyas Miolendarius (the miller) ; Stephanus le Grindar (the grinder) ; Thomas Cyrothecarius (the glover) ; Galfridus Aurifaber (the goldsmith) ; Willelmus Pistor (the baker) ; Regi naldus Tinctor (the dyer) ; Hugo le Mercer (the mercer). These names belonged to the persons exercising the trades and callings alluded to, and at the present would be represented by the titles \u2014 Robert Clark, Roger Coiner, Reginald Fowler, Elias Miller, Stephen 1 Rot. Hundred, II, 99."], [452, "348 Grinder, Thomas Glover, Geoffrey Goldsmith, William Baker, Reginald Dyer, and Hugh Mercer. We glean from these names the number and character of the trades exercised at Ludlow in the reign of Edward I. 1C'8\" \"* AAIA.\u201eUA^. A.. Numerous are the notices of shops and messuages in ancient Ludlow. At the period of which we write, premises were let after this fashion : \u2014 \" October, 1277. Hugh Brayn and Alice, his wife, enfeoff Philip Fitz-Stephen in a messuage, for 40s. paid, and a rent.\" Or, as in this case : \u2014 \" November, 1285. Peter Furbet, and Oldeburgh, his wife, enfeoff Laurence de Ludlow in a mes suage and shop in Ludlow, to hold of the grantors and the heirs of Oldeburgh, at a rent of one, rose. One sore sparrow-hawk is said to be paid for this grant.\" Church of St. Laurence. Existent, perhaps, in the time of King Athelstane, the church or chapel at Lude, at that remote period, was probably a depen dence of the Saxon church of St. Mary's, Bromfield. Generally speaking, our parochial and ecclesiastical boundaries have been preserved far more intact than our civd and manorial boundaries ; as therefore Ludlow is represented as giving name to a deanery in even the earliest written records, the great ecclesiastical antiquity of Ludlow may be hence inferred. In 1199, the people of Ludelau, finding their church too small for the growing necessities of their town, determined on enlarging it by lengthening it towards the east. The lowe or tumulus, from whence originated the name of the town, presented, however, an obstacle to their undertaking. It was levelled, when, as a matter of course, it was found to contain human remains. This was a notable discovery for the slenderly-paid clerks officiating at Lud low, who, forthwith transforming stinking bones into relics of saints, collected them carefulby, placed them in a coffer, and, on the 11th of April, with great reverence, deposited them in Ludlow church. A scroll, well preserved, inwardly by wax and outwardly by lead, which the Ludlow clerks said they had also found, con veniently explained all about the disentombed skeletons : they were no other than the remains of three Irish saints, namely, St. Fer cher, father of St. Brendan ; St. Corona, St. Brendan's mother, and St. \u2014 Cochel, brother of St. Corona. By way of explanation as to how three Irish saints came to be found in that out-of-the way place, the scroll added that these worthies had \" lived on the spot for fifteen years, what time they adopted the protection of"], [453, "LUDLOW CHUECH. p. 348."], [454, ""], [455, "349 the saints of Britain, distrustful [of their own country], after the death of Luda.\" Clerks, living under the shadow of the castle of a great Irish lord, would find small difficulty in learning somewhat concerning Irish saintship. The easy-minded, superstitious, good folk of Ludlow failed to detect the pious fraud that was being palmed off on them ; and, for many a long year afterwards, these precious bones yielded a goodly income to the formerly poor clerks of Ludlow. , Among the Harleian MSS. in the British Museum ' is a book which, at the end of the 13th century, or beginning of the 14th, belonged to St Laurence's, Ludlow. The greater portion of the volume is written in the Anglo-Norman language. Its contents are of a mixed theological and literary kind, and illustrate the class of reading then fashionable with a man of taste of the clerical order. At the commencement of the book is a calendar, which informs us that the church of St. Laurence was dedicated on the 13th of February, but the year is not stated. Next follows a copy of the early Anglo-Norman prose version of the Psalms. Thirdly, a metrical Anglo-Norman version of some parts of the Psalms ; fourthly, the Bestiaire d' Amours, a poetical description of ani mals, etc., with curious moralisations ; fifthly, the rules given by Robert Grosteste for regulating the household and lands of a nobleman ; sixthly, the French version of Turpin's History of Charlemagne ; seventhly, a French treatise on confession ; eighthly, various fragments, among which are many charms, and a treatise on chiromancy ; ninth, the \" Manuel des Peches,\" a well-known religious poem, attributed to Robert Grosteste ; tenth, an account of St. Patrick's purgatory, in French verse ; eleventh, a French poem, entitled La Pleinte d' Amour ; twelfth, various religious matters, in Latin. In its present shape, St. Laurence's, Lwdlow, was built either in the reign of Edward IL, or early in that of Edward III. Pope Nicholas' Taxation values the church of Lodelawe, in the deanery of Lodelawe, at \u00a313 6s. 8d. per annum. In 1341, a special jury taxed Ludlow, as a mercantile town, to the current assessment, when the great sum of \u00a372 12s. lid. was returned as the ninth of the moveable goods of its burgesses.

Situated on the north side of the Teme, near the bridge, formerly stood the Hospital of St. John the Baptist, which Peter Undergod, a rich burgess of Ludlow, founded about 1225. The establishment in question ceased to exist about 1535. The St. Augustine Frtars once had an establishment at Ludlow. We are assured by the annals of Worcester, that, in 1282, the prior of the Augustine Friars of Ludlow, along with a number of knights and others, saw three suns at Kinlet, one in the east, one in the west, and one (the real one probably) in the south.1 The Carmelite, or White Friars' House, stood in Corvegate Street.

The name denotes in Norman-French a raven ; whether in allusion to the famous Danish standard (the Reafan), of which their ancestor might have been the bearer from Scandinavia under Rollo, the movement of which portended to that people the event of their expeditions ; or whether, from a less noble source\" cannot be determined. It is certain that Corbet came, with his second and fourth sons, Roger and Robert, to the invasion of England by Duke William of Normandy. Besides the two sons, who settled in Shropshire, the eldest and third sons, Hugh and Renaud, stayed behind. Hugh Corbet, like his father, a knight, is mentioned in some charters of the abbey of Bee, in Normandy. Renaud Corbet, the third son, was in Palestine in 1096, with his two sons, Robert and Guy. From the last of these descended five generations, all of them men of eminent rank in France, distinguished crusa ders in the Holy Land, arid castellans or viscounts of St. Pol, wliich the Corbets continued to hold until Hugh Corbet, knight, fourth descendant of Guy, sold his viscount}r to the Count de St. Pol, in order to raise money that he might follow St. Louis on hia crusading expedition against the Moors of Africa with greater splendour. Robert, son of Hugh, accompanied his father to Tunis, and was drowned there in 1270. Hugh, his. son, settled near Cambray ; and his descendants for four generations lived at various places in the Netherlands, till James Corbet, sixth in descent from the last-named Robert, removed to Antwerp ; and Robert, grand son of James, migrated to Spain, where he left a fair posterity. 2 Domesday, so. 253, b I. I.ahorantes."], [459, "353 These Corbets of France and Flanders bore three ravens for their arms, in token of their descent from the third brother. A branch also of the Corbet family settled in Scotland, and were even allied to the royal family there ; for, in 1255, the Archbishop of St. Andrew's writes a letter to the English chancellor, Walter de Merton, on behalf of his \" beloved and especial friend, Nicholas Corbet, cousin of my lord the king,\" ' who had then certain affairs pending at the court of Heniy III. To return to the Shropshire Corbets. Soon after Domesday, building himself a castle at Alreton, Roger named it Caus in honour of his birth-place. The castle of Caux was one of those border fortresses which, throughout the Anglo-Norman period, was called on alternately to serve the purposes of aggression and defence. Planted in a position of inherent strength, it commanded a wide extent of country ; and from its battlements the warder might descry from afar every danger that approached by way of the valley of the Rea. But a fragment of it now remains ; yet the site of its massy keep, and the situation of its enormous well, can be traced, and these enable the imagination to picture the frequently-enacted scene of old, when, to escape the fierce irrup tion of the AVelsh, men, women, and children hurried to seek refuge within its walls. Exposed to the turmoil of a hostile frontier, this oft-assailed fortress served as a home for the barons of Caus. We learn from Ordericus that Earl Roger de Montgomery, who probably organised the frontier defences of Shropshire, was ably seconded in the government of his province by Corbet ancl his sous Roger and Rodbert. Roger Corbet is mentioned as the first of the three commanders to whom the Norman Earl Robert de Belesme entrusted the castle of Bridgenorth, when it was besieged by King Henry I. in 1102. Roger Fitz-Corbet, the Domesday baron, gave the Vill of Wineslega (Winsley) to Shrewsbury Abbey, and, dying about 1121, was succeeded by \u2014 Wii.lI am Corbet, his eldest son, in whose time Caus Castle was taken and burnt by the Welsh. It is probable that William died childless, and was succeeded in the barony of Caus by his brother\u2014 Ebrarii Corbet. To Ebrard succeeded\u2014 Roger Corbet IL, who was in attendance on Henry II. at the Rymer, sub ann., i|iioLed by BLAKEWAY in Sheriffs of Shropshire, p. 38. A A"], [460, "354 siege of Brug in the summer of 1155. The period during which he held Caus Castle, was by no means a peaceful one on the border ; and we learn from the sheriff of Worcestershire's account, that in 1165, he had paid \u00a314 11s. 8d. to the soldiers or garrison of Chaus. To Roger succeeded his nephew \u2014 Robert Corbet, who, in 1176, was amerced 20 merks for tres passing on the royal forests. It has been stated, that this baron fought by the side of King Richard at the siege of Acre ; such, however, is not the fact, and it may be accepted as a general truth, that a lord-marcher usually had his hands full enough at home, without requiring to go so far as Palestine to find scope for his valour. When the scutage for King Richard's redemption was levied in Shropshire, Robert Corbet was charged and paid \u00a34, his quota in that county. He was also assessed to various other scutages in the reigns of Richard and John : his barony being reputed, as far as scutages and military service were concerned, to consist of five knights' fees : Robertus Corbet, Baro, tenet in capite, et debet servicium v militum, says a Feodary of the year 1211. Among various notices relative to this baron, we find that in 1196 the sheriff of Shropshire paid Robert Corbet 10 merks : it was a present from King Richard \" to support Corbet in the king's ser vice in the parts of Wales.\" Wenunwin de Kevelloc, Prince of Powis, married Robert Corbet's daughter. Robert loyally adhered to King John throughout his troubled reign ; but his eldest son, Thomas, took a different course, and young Henry III. for a time seized the castle of the loyal father, as a precaution against the malpractices of the son. \" For the love of God, for the health of of the grantor's soul, and of all his progeny,\" Robert Corbet gave liberally to the monks of Shrewsbury and Buildwas Abbey ; and, dying in 1222 \u2014 Thomas Corbet, his son, fined \u00a3100 for his relief, and doing homage to the king, the sheriff of Shropshire was certified accord ingly. That this baron was fond of the chase, appears from the king's writ close, dated at Montgomery, October 4th, 1224, ordering the sheriff to allow Corbet to pursue any three boars through the forests of Shropshire, which he might unkennel in his own forest. In 1236, Henry III. confirmed by charter to his faithful and beloved Thomas Corbet the whole forest of Teynfrestanes (Sti perstones), quit of all foresterage and exaction, with such right of hunting and venison, as Roger, his uncle, had had in the time of Henry II. In 1248, this baron marcher was appointed sheriff of Shropshire and Staffordshire."], [461, "355 We gain an insight into the immunities claimed by the barons of Caus by the statement which Thomas Corbet made in 1250-1, before the barons of Exchequer. Corbet said, that, \" He had had five antecessors since the Conquest of England, and that none of them had rendered any relief to the king or to his antecessors for those five knight's fees which he (Corbet) now held of the king in capite.\" It is certain that he was the first recorded lord of Caus who had paid the baronial fine of \u00a3100. Thomas Corbet was one of those vassals of the crown who, when the news reached the King of England that the Welsh had stormed Builth castle, and put its garrison to the sword, received summons to muster, with horses and arms, at Shrewsbury, on September 8, 1260. The details of border history at this period would furnish a stormy chapter for the page of history. Throughout this troubled time, Corbet adhered to Henry III., yet his loyalty does not' appear to have partaken of an active character ; old age, per haps, or a peculiarity of temper, which involved him in quarrels with his vassals, his kinsmen, his compatriots of the Marches, and even in a lawsuit against his own son, were the reasons why he did not. co-operate more actively with the members of his party. Having completed his foundation of the chapel of St. Margaret at Caus (the castle chapel), this baron died in 1274. The Inquest which was held on the 23rd of October following found that his barony consisted of 8| knight's fees, and that he owed thereon the service of 5 knight's fees in time of war. His whole income had amounted to \u00a3101 11s. 9d. per annum. In Caus itself he had had four carucates in demesne. Twenty-eight burgages, there paid a rent of Is. each. The garden was worth 6s. 8d., and the dove-cote 5s. per annum. Peter, his son and heir, would hold his estates ofthe Icing, etc. Upon the 2nd of November, 1274, King Edward I. accepted the homage of \u2014 Peter Corbet, who, accordingly, now became Baron of Caus. Peter, whose summonses, military and parliamentary, are numer ous, served in the campaign which closed the career of Lewellyn. He also fought in King Edward's Scottish wars. Like his father, being a \" mighty hunter,\" a patent, dated May 4th, 1281, com missioned Peter Corbet to destroy all wolves, wherever they could be found, in the counties of Salop, Stafford, Gloucester, Worcester, and Hereford, using men, dogs, and other devices for the purpose : from which it appears that the Anglo-Saxon King, Edgar, had"], [462, "356 not so completely extirpated this ferocious animal from England as is generally supposed. The baron of Caus arrogated rights of haut justice, or the power of inflicting capital punishment, and imprisoning and releasing at his pleasure, and pleading immemorial usage of his ancestors. Corbet claimed that no sheriff, coroner, or other officer of the crown could enter his vills. But the king's attorney replied, that Caus, etc. were in Shropshire ; that the king was King of England, Shropshire included ; and that these very franchises constituted the essence of sovereignty. It does not apjiear, however, that Edward I. recovered all those rights, which, as he alleged, his vassal had usurped. Peter Corbet died in 1300, leaving his second son \u2014 Peter Corbet II. , to succeed him. As Dominus de Cauz, he joined in the famous letter of the barons to Pope Boniface VIII., asserting King Edward's right to the crown of Scotland. Lord of numerous estates in Shropshire and Devonshire, the heir of Peter Corbet II. was his brother, John Corbet, who spent his life in ineffectually prosecuting a claim on the Valletort estates, of which he was the co-heir in right of life grandmother, Isabel, sister of Reginald de Valletort, of Trematon, Cornwall. Reduced in cir cumstances by the joint artifices of his own kindred and the king's injustice, John Corbet, the last baron of Caus, if such he can be called, died without issue in 1347, whilst Beatrix, his sister-in-law, was yet seized of his barony. With respect to Beatrix, wife of Peter Corbet II. , she was sister of John, Baron Beauchamp of Hache. After Peter Corbet's decease, she remarried with Sir John de Leybourne, who accordingly presented to Caus chapel, in 1346. Beatrix died in 1347, seized in tail of the whole Shropshire manor of the Corbets, which then passed to the great-grandchildren of her first husband's aunts, Alice and Emma, daughters of Thomas Corbet. Alice, the eldest, had married Robert, Baron Stafford ; accordingly, one moiety of the barony of Caus was annexed to the barony of Staf ford. The other moiety was subdivided, and the share of Emma, youngest daughter of Tliomas Corbet, and wife of Brian de Bromp ton, is now in the heirs of Harley, and in the heirs of Cornwall of Kinlet. The Corbets of Leigh and Sundorne, according to Blakeway,1 1 BLAKEWAY'S Sheriffs of Shropshire, pp. 42, si;."], [463, "357 are descended from John, the last male Corbet of the elder line. The said John, however, died without lawful issue. Eyton says that the Roger Corbet of Legh juvta Caus, knight, who, by writ of May 9th, 1324, was summoned to attend the great council of Westminster, \"was assuredly ancestor of the Corbets of Leigh.\" \" Of Corbets which have branched off from the house of Caus,\" .says the same authority, \" none of them can be descended from any later baron than he who died in 1222.\" 3$tm8terk]J. \" The camp on Callow Hill, near Minsterley, is rectangular, and surrounded by a fosse, four yards wide. This form favours the supposition of its having been thrown up by the\" Romans. It is eighty-six paces from east to west, and fifty-eight from north-west to south-east. The corners are gently rounded ; that at the east-north-east more so than the rest.\" J This camp commands the beautiful valley of Minsterley, the neighbourhood of which is rich in lead mines. The name Minsterley seems to indicate that this place was for merly the site of one of those Saxon collegiate churches whose parishes were so extensive. Of the manor, Domesday says : \u2014 \" The earl himself holds Menistrelie, and Roger [Fitz Corbet holds it] of him. King Edward held it. Here vi hides geldable. In demesne are ii ox-teams, and other ii might be here. Here viii villains and iiii boors, with viii teams. Here iiii neat-herds. There are two leagues of wood. In time of King Edward, it was worth 60s. [annually]. Now 5s. more.\"2 From the above, it appears that the Saxon king had been lord of Minsterley, which probably included Habberley. We have seen how it is recorded as one of the ancient customs of Shrewsbury, that when the king resided there the sheriff used to send thirty-six footmen to his [hunting] stand, but \" at Marsetelie Park, that officer was bound by custom to find the same number of men for eight days.\" 3 Minsterley Chapel. Instead of being, as in Saxon times, the mother-church of Westbury, Minsterley is now dependant on Westbury. The first notice we have of this chapel is in 1694. 4 Habberley Church.

[annually] .\" ' Corbet's first feoffee in Alberbury was Ralph the Vd\u00a3, who, in the reign of Stephen, gave the church of Alberberie to Shrewsbury abbey. Whether he was heir to Ralph or not, is unknown, yet Fulk Fitz- Warin, lord of the castle of Whittington, was Corbet's vassal in Alberbury, in Hemy II. 's time, and the lordly Fitz-Warins for many generations afterwards continued to do homage to the barons of Caus for this manor. A feodary of Thomas Corbet's barony, of the year 1240, gives Fulk Fitz- Warin as holding one knight's fee in Aldeburi. He it was who was deputed by the assembly of angry nobles which met at Dun stable on June 30, 1245, to proceed to London, and give the pope's nuncio formal notice to quit the kingdom. The nuncio obeyed the peremptory order. On November 22, 1248, a fine was levied between Thomas Corbet and Fulk Fitz-Warin, concerning the customs and service required by Corbet on a knight's fee held by Fitz-Warin in Alber bury. Corbet required that Fitz-Warin should do him homage and service of one knight, and do suit every three weeks at the court of Caus, and find one knight or two servientes for ward of Caus castle, at his [Fitz-Warin's] cost, for forty days, whenever there was war between the English king and the Welsh. Fitz- Warin now acknowledged all these obligations. It was this Fulk Fitz-Warin III. who founded Alberbury priory. The following entry, so illustrative of the feudal system, is on the Salop Assize Roll, of January, 1256 : \u2014 \" An Assize comes on, to make recognition whether Thomas Corbet hath disseized Fulk 1 Domesday, so. 253, b I."], [465, "359 Fitz-Warin, junior, of his free tenement in Albebyr, viz., of about 120 acres. \" Thomas says that the land is of his fief, and that the plaintiff, before many magnates and lieges of the king, rendered back his homage and the said land to the defendant, and positively declared that he never would hold either that or any other land of the defendant. For this reason, the defendant put himself in seizin of the said land, as it was lawful for him to do, the moment that Fulk abandoned it to him.\" \" Fulk says [in reply] that he never rendered back land nor homage, and asks judgment on this special point : whether, even if it were true that under anger and excitement he had verbally rendered back his homage, yet had not subsequently changed his state, but had continuously remained in seizin ; whether it was competent to the defendant to dis-seize him on the ground of a mere word. As to his never having spontaneously and of good will surrendered the land, he puts himself on an assize \" (i.e., appeals to a jury) . \" The jury declares that a certain day of reconciliation was fixed upon between Thomas Corbet and Griffin ap Wennonwyn, touching several matters of contention ; that many magnates met together on the occasion, and that Fulk, the present plaintiff, was of the number ; that Fulk and Thomas Corbet quarrelled together ; that Corbet called Fulk [Fulk's father] a traitor ; that Fulk announced to Corbet, that, seeing he charged his father with such a crime, he [Fulk junior] would render back his homage to Corbet, and would never hold land of him again.\" \" The jurors, being asked [by the Court] whether Fulk, in his own person, made the said surrender, say that he did not ; indeed, that he made the surrender through Hamo le Strange.\" \" The jurors, being further asked whether Fulk, after he had sent that message, returned to his seizin, say ' Yes ;' and that Fulk is still in seizin of the castle of Alberbyr, which is the capital manor pertaining to the said land ; and that Fulk caused eight days' ploughing to be done on the land, in the interval before Corbet ejected him.\" Judgment was given in favour of Fitz-Warin. \"The court decides that Fulk do recover his seizin.\" ' About eight years afterwards the Fulk Fitz-Warin of the above entry fought for 1 Assizes, 4o Hen.

This was originally a Saxon collegiate church. When Fulk Fitz-Warin III. founded Alberbury Priory, he doubtless gave up the patronage of Alberbury church and its prebends to the Priory ; the Barons of Caus concurred, when, the friars having procured an appropriation of the church, it's prebends were suppressed, and a vicarage only remained, of which the friars were patrons. In 1291, the rectorial income of the church of Alberbury, in Pontesbury Deanery, was valued at \u00a325 per ann. ; the vicar's portion was \u00a36 13s 4d. We learn from the Assize Roll of 1292, that a Welsh murderer, some time previously, had taken Sanctuary in Alberbury church, where he remained five weeks, till he was rescued by his countrymen. Here we have a remarkable illustra tion of the superstitious awe for the precincts of a shrine, which prevailed during those lawless ages in which our Anglo-Norman ancestors lived. In 1341, Alberbury Parish was assessed -only \u00a310 4s. to the ninth, because the greater portion of it was in the parts of Wales; three virgates of land lay uncultivated on account of poverty of tenants, etc. In 1534-5, the Vicar of Alberbury's preferment was valued at \u00a35, less Is. for archdeacon's synodals, and 13s. 4d. for bishop's procurations. Early Incumbent. \u2014 Gregory de Clon, 1284. aitotluttg ilriorg. Although its foundation charter is lost, there is reason to believe that Alberbury Priory was founded by Fulk Fitz- Warin III., between the years 1220 and 1230. \" Fulk,\" says the Fitz-Warin Chronicle, \" in remission of his sins, founded a priory, in the honour of our Lady, St. Mary, of the Order of Grandmont, near Alberbury, in a wood, on the river Severn.\" 2 The French House of Grandmont, in Limousin, of which, strictly speaking, Alberbury was a mere cell, adopted the Benedictine rule. We learn that, \" Fulk Fitz-Warin gave his 1 Matthew Paris, vol. iii. p. 348, Bohn's Ed. 'Hist of Fulk Filz-Wartne. T.Wright, p. 176."], [467, "3C0. ALBERBURY CHURCH AND CASTLE."], [468, ""], [469, "361 body to the Priory [of Alberbury] to be buried there ; and that therewith he gave [besides his former donations] a certain messuage in Wytmere, in pure and perpetual alms.\" The pos sessions of this priory were soon increased by various other benefactors. \"There was formerly,\" says an MS. authority,1 \"a chapel dedicated to St. Stephen, within the site of the Monastery, in which was buried Fulk Warin, its founder, with many other benefactors of the priory;\" and therein a priest performed services for the souls of the said founder and benefactors. Pope Nicholas' Taxation represents the Prior of Alberbury's annual income to be, in temporalities, \u00a32 7s.; in moveables, \u00a31 9s. The former item was derived from lands and assized rents : 9s. of the latter arose from 6 cows, and \u00a31 from 60 sheep. Upon the breaking out of the great war with France, Edward III. seized into his hands the alien Priory of Alberbury, which con tinued an escheat of the crown until Henry VI. 's time. This king, at the request of Chicheley, Archbishop of Canterbury, on May 11, 1441, granted this suppressed priory, with all \"its tithes, advowsons of churches and chapels, etc., in free and perpetual alms to All Souls' College, Oxford, then recently founded by Chicheley. Peter de Corcellis, apparently a foreigner, was Prior of Alber bury, 1289-90. He is the only one whose name has been preserved. M'l UlSllJll. Roger Fitz-Corbet held this manor of the Norman earl in the year 1086; for Domesday says that, \u2014 \" The same Roger holds Wineslei. Seuuard, a free man held it [in Saxon times]. Here ii hides geldable. In demesne are ii ox- teams; and one villain and one radman with i team and a half. [The manor] was and is worth 15s.

Here are two Welsh with i ox-team. [The manor] was and is worth 2s. and yet it is at. ferm for 6s. 8d.\" ' The Do mesday Commissioners appear to have received conflicting evidence respecting the value of Bauseley, and they have left on record the paradox they were unable to account for. In process of time the Corbets of Caus withdrew this manor into their jurisdiction of Walcheria, where it remained until after the conquest of Wales. Bauseley is now in the Mont gomeryshire hundred of Deythur. With the Leightons, as co-heirs of Robert and Matilda Corbet, Bauseley remained till 1711, when it passed to a younger branch of the Leightons, who now possess it. \u00a9111011, near Alberbury, is the subject of two entries in Domes day Book.

The lead mines of the Ponsert [Pontesford] hill were worked, and perhaps originally discovered, by the Romans. Some lead, partially fused, was found a few years since, nearly on the summit of Ponsert hill, in which were embedded pieces of charcoal. The fragment alluded to evidently belonged to the Roman period. Indeed, the names Pontesbury (the former part of which is derived from the Latin Pontes), Stoney Stretton, and Watlesborough, sufficiently indicate that this locality was known to the Romans. Under date A.D. 661, the Anglo-Saxon chronicle informs us that : \u2014 \" This year, during Easter, Kenwalk fought at Pontesbury, and Wulfhere, the son of Penda, laid the country waste as far as Ashdown.\" The camp upon the summit of Pontesford hill is British, and 1 Domesday, so. 255, b 1 . !

They held it until, in 1305, Rese ap Howel purchased the manor. Very shortly afterwards he gave Pontesbury to the king in exchange for other lands. Upon this, Edward II. gave the manor to his beloved valet John de Cherlton, who thereupon became lord of Pontesbury, and as such he is duly entered in the Nomina Villarum of 1316. Pontesbury Church. This was originally a Saxon collegiate church, and gave name to the deanery in which it is situated. At all recorded periods, down to the present day, St. George's, Pontesbury, has consisted of three portions, rectories or prebends. In 1291, two of these portions were valued at \u00a310 13s. 4d. per annum each. The remaining one at \u00a35 6s 8d. In 1341, the parish was assessed \u00a317 15s. 8d. to the ninth.

Westbury Church. The mention of two priests in the Domesday entry relating to Westbury, indicates the existence of a collegiate church in this place. Minsterley collegiate church then appears to have been transferred to Westbury by the year 1086. The two priests of Domesday were types of the two prebendaries or rectors, who, in all later records, appear as sharing the emoluments of this church. In 1291, the church of Westbury, in the deanery of Pontesbury, was valued at \u00a320 per annum. In 1341, the parish was taxed \u00a313 6s. 8d. to the ninth ; a great part of it then lay untilled, the tenants being poor.

Already divergent, in Henry the Second's time the connecting link between the baronial and the knightly Corbets has been lost ; and all we are certain of is, that Richard Corbet entered on the Shropshire Pipe Roll of 1179-80 as a vassal of the barony, is the first of his line who can be named as holding Wattlesborough under the barons of Caus. A century later, and we have this Richard's grandson, Sir Robert Corbet, prepared to do full military service under his suzerain Peter Corbet of Caus against Lewellyn. The flat Norman buttress of the tower of Wattlesborough castle, the lower part of which still exists, bespeak a high antiquity for this monument of the past. The moat can still be partially traced.

The fief which Robert held was less than that of his elder brother. In 1121, the brothers appear together, attesting Henry L's charter to Shrewsbury abbey. Yet Robert's relationship with that king was not reputable ; for Sibil, or, as she is otherwise called, Adela Corbet, his eldest daughter, was one of the numerous mistresses of Henry I., by whom she had at least two sons, and probably a daughter. Roger, the elder of these illegitimate offshoots of royalty, was surnamed De Dunstanville. Sibil Corbet afterwards became the lawrful wife of Herbert, son of Herbert, the king's chamberlain, and her descen dants by him eventually acquiring a share in Robert Fitz-Corbet's barony, they exercised the seigneury over Woodcote. The Hor tons and the De Woodcotes held Woodcote under the baronial Fitz-Herberts. % OlUJltylt. Robert Fitz-Corbet held also Longden of the Norman earl, for Domesday says: \u2014 \"The same Robert holds Languedune. Leuric held it, and was a free man. Here iii hides geldable. In demesne are ii ox-teams, and iiii serfs, one villain, ix boors, iii radmans, and vi cottars between them all have ii ox teams, and there might be iii additional teams here.

Now it is worth 40s.\" ' Robert Fitz-Corbet, the Domesday baron, had two daughters, viz., Sibil and Alice, who eventually became his heirs. Of Sibil Corbet, the elder sister, we have just spoken. Alice, youngest daughter and co-heir of Robert Fitz-Corbet, marrying William Boterell of Corn wall, upon the death of Reginald, earl of Cornwall, the Boterells obtained, like the Fitz-Herberts, their moiety of Robert Corbet's barony, and thenceforth Longden was reputed to be caput of the Shropshire barony of Boterell or Botreaux. Sir William de Boterell IV. alienated Longden to Robert Burnel, bishop of Bath and Wells, in exchange for lands in Somersetshire. Accordingly, the feodary of 1284 states, that \" the bishop holds Langedon of the 1 Domesday, so. 256, a 1.

(-JUllllfitOll and Rowton, joint townships in the lower quarter of the parish of Alberbury, are both noticed in King William's record.

Upon the forfeiture of Earl Robert de Belesme, Ford devolved to King Henry I., whose grandson, Henry IL, in 1155-6 granted it to his uncle Reginald, Earl of Cornwall.

Styled \" Regi nald, son of King Henry,\" this illegitimate magnate figured in the court of the usurper Stephen in March, 1136, but quickly changing sides, he afterwards materially aided the cause of his half-sister, the Empress. That Reginald Fitz Roy should take an interest in Shropshire, the county of his mother's family, was natural. In 1141 he attested the Empress' charter to Shrewsbury Abbey, and in 1155 he accompanied his nephew, Henry IL, to the siege of Bridge north. Under such circumstances, it is not to be wondered at, that Reginald should seek to obtain from the young king Ford, which occupied a central position with respect to the bulk of his grandfather Corbet's manors \u2014 lands over which Earl Reginald held the seigneury during his life. At the time Henry II. granted Ford to his uncle, it was reputed to pay an annual ferm of \u00a35 13s. 4d. to the king's exchequer ; and, from 1156 to 1175, the sheriff of Shropshire deducted that amount from his own liabilities, and assigns it under the head of Terra dat\u00e6 to Earl Reginald. Yet, besides his Shropshire estates, Earl Reginald held lands in Wiltshire, Northamptonshire, Devonshire, Herefordshire, Somersetshire, and Dorsetshire, to say nothing of that vast Cornish fief which yielded to the son of King Henry a princely revenue. Ford having returned into the king's hand at the death of Earl Reginald in 1175, it continued in the crown during the reigns of Richard, John, and the earlier part of the reign of Henry III. in which period the manor was subject to a wholesale destruction of fire and sword at the hands of the Welsh. On August 5, 1230, however, the king, then at Bordeaux, grants to Henry de Audley the manor of Ford, \" to hold in fee-farm of the king and his heirs, to the grantee and his heirs, for an annual rent of \u00a312, payable at the Exchequer, in lieu of all services. The grantee is to be quit of suits to county or hundred, and his men are to be quit of all talliage for the king's use ; but the grantee may talliate the manor for his own use, as often as the king talliatedthe royal demesnes.\" ' Henry de Audley, who now became lord of Ford, was of a Staffordshire family of knightly degree. Sheriff of Shropshire and Staffordshire in 1229, skilful and loyal, Henry amassed a barony. His commissions as a lord-marcher are numerous.

As loyalist sheriff of Shropshire, Audley did good service to the cause of Henry III. during that eventful period which preceded the battle of Evesham, when, in 1272, having broken his neck \u2014 \u00bb James de Audley IL, his son, did homage to the king, and forthwith had livery of his inheritance. He held the barony but a short while ; for dying \u2014 Henry de Audley II. succeeded his brother as lord of Ford in November, 1273. On April 22, 1276, the king's writ of Diem clausit announced the decease of this baron, when \u2014 William de Audley-, his brother, succeeding, he soon after fell in the wars of Wales. Nicholas de Audley, brother and heir to AVilliam, succeeded to Ford in 1282, who, dying in 1299\u2014 Thomas de Audley, his son, a youth ten years old, became his heir. This young noble died in 1308, whilst in ward to the king. Nicholas de Audley II. , who then succeeded his brother, is returned in the Nomina Villarum of March, 1316, as lord of the vill of Forde. In December following, he also died, making, singularly enough, seven successive lords of this barony, all of whom had been cut off within the short space of forty years. To Nicholas succeeded \u2014 James de Audley III., who, present at the famous battle of Poictiers, according to Walsingham, \" broke through the French army and caused much slaughter that day to the enemy.\" \" The lord James Audley,\" says Froissart, \"with the assistance of his four squires, was always engaged in the heat of the battle. He was severely wounded in the body, head, and face ; and, as long as his strength and breath permitted him, he maintained the fight, and advanced forward : he continued to do so until he was covered with blood ; then, towards the close of the engagement, his four squires, who were as his body-guard, took him, and led him out of the engagement, very weak and wounded, towards a hedge, that he might cool and take breath. - They disarmed him as gently as they could, in order to examine his wounds, dress them, and sew up the most dangerous.\" After the battle was won, the 1 Baronage, p. 748."], [486, "374 Black Prince enquired from those knights who were about him, of Lord James Audley, and asked if any one knew what was become of him. \" Yes, sir,\" replied some ofthe company ; \" he is very badly wounded, and is lying in a litter hard by.\" \" By my troth,\" replied the Prince, \"I am sore vexed that he is so wounded. See, I beg of you, if he be able to bear being carried hither; otherwise I will come and visit him.\" Two knights directly left the prince, and coming to Lord James, told him howr desirous the prince was of seeing him. \"A thousand thanks to the prince,\" answered Lord James, \" for condescending to remem ber so poor a knight as myself.\" He then called eight of his servants, and had himself borne in his litter to where the prince was. When he was come into his presence, the prince bent down over him and embraced him, say ing : \" My Lord James, I am bound to honour you very much ; for by your valour this day, you have acquired glory and renown above us all, and your prowess has proved you the bravest knight.\" Lord James replied, \" My lord, you have a right to say whatever you please, but I wish it were as you have said.

Arrived at his tent, Lord James then sent for his brother, Sir Peter Audley, the Lord Bar tholomew Burghersh, Sir Stephen Cossington, Lord Willoughby of Eresby, and Lord William Ferrers of Groby ; they were all his relatives. He then sent for his four squires that had attended upon him that day, and, addressing himself to the knights, said : \" Gentlemen, it has pleased my lord the prince to give me five hundred marcs as a yearly inheritance ; for which gift I have done him very trifling bodily service. You see here these four squires, who have always served me most loyally, and especially in this day's engagement.

I should like to know if this be true, why you did so, and if the gift were not agreeable to you.\" \" Yes, my lord,\" answered Lord James, \"it was most agreeable to me, and I will tell you the reasons which induced me to bestow it on my squires. These four squires, who are here, have long and loyally served me, in many great and dangerous occasions, and until the day that I made them this present, I had not any way rewarded them for all their services ; and never, in this life, were they of such help to me as on that day. I hold myself much bound to them for what they did at the battle of Poictiers ; for, dear sir, I am but a single man, and can do no more than my powers admit, but, through their aid and assistance, I have accomplished my vow, which for a long time I had made, and by their means was the first combatant, and should have paid for it with my life, if they had not been near to me. When, there fore, I consider their courage, and the love they bear to me, I should not have been courteous nor grateful, if I had not rewarded them. Thank God, my lord, I have a sufficiency for my life to maintain my state ; and wealth has never yet failed me, nor do I believe it ever will. If, therefore, I have in this acted contrary to your wishes, I beseech you, dear sir, to pardon me ; for you will be ever as loyally served by me and my squires, to whom I gave your present, as heretofore.\" The prince answered, \" Sir James, I do not in the least blame you for what you have done, but, on the contrary, acknowledge your bounty to your squires whom you praise so much. I readily confirm your gift to them ; but I shall insist upon your accepting of six hundred marcs, upon the same"], [488, "376 terms and conditions as the former gift.\" ' Surviving his wounds, the chivalrous James de Audley, lord of Ford, died at the age of 71.

He also gave,\" etc. : \u2014 \"all this, William Pantulf, and Lesceline, his wife, freely gave to God, for the repose of their souls, and of those of their friends, and they ratified the gift in the chapter of the monks of St. Evroult, convened generally, before many witnesses.\" \" Afterwards, Abbot Mainier and Fulk the Prior, with William Pantulf, went to Earl Roger, who was then residing at Belesme, and humbly petitioned him to confirm the said knight's grants by his own charter. He, being pious and liberal, received favourably their lawful petition, and ratified all their demands, in the presence of those who, on various affairs, were then attending his court. The feast of St. Leonard was then being celebrated at Belesme ; to pay due honour to which, the count, with his usual munificence, had assembled a great number of guests,\" \"bishops and abbots,\" \" clerks and laymen, who were witnesses to the above-mentioned charter.\" In the year 1077, \" the illustrious Robert [de Grantmesnil, ex abbot of St. Evroult, but then abbot of St. Euphemia, in Apulia] , having assisted at the consecration of the churches of Caen, Bayeux, and Bee, which took place that year, and having had friendly intercourse with King William [the Conqueror], and others his friends and relations, whom he had, not seen for many 1 Ordericus Vitalis, Bk. IV. ch. vii."], [495, "381 years, went back to Apulia, taking with him William Pantoul, and Robert de Cordai, his nephew, with many other gallant knights. At that time Robert Guiscard (the celebrated Norman), commanded in Apulia, and had acquired the dukedom of Gisulf, Duke of Salerno. He was the son of Tancred de Hauteville, a person of moderate station, who, by his bravery and good fortune, had succeeded in acquiring great power in Italy. With the aid of his brothers and others of his countrymen who joined him, he imposed his yoke on the people of .Apulia ; and having most un expectedly risen to great eminence, he was exalted above all his neighbours, amassed great wealth, and was continually enlarging his territories. He received William Pantoul with distinguished honours, and making him great promises, tried to retain him in his service on account of his merit. He made him sit by his side at dinner on the feast of Easter, and offered him three towns if he would remain in Italy. \"Meanwhile (that is, on the 5th December, 1082), the Countess Mabel (Earl Roger Montgomery's tyrannical wife) had perished by the sword of Hugh D'lge, the revengeful knight ; and this murder was the cause of great troubles after AVilliam Pantoul's return from Apulia. For he was accused of treason, and the charge was prosecuted with great animosity by some of his rivals. The deceased lady had (unjustly) taken possession of the castle of Perai, which had been given to William ; on which account there had long existed a violent hostility between them. It was hence suspected that AVilliam had contrived her death, particularly as he was on terms of intimacy and frequent communication with Hugh. Earl Roger, therefore, and his sons seized his whole estate, and sought an opportunity of putting him to death. In consequence, William and his wife took refuge at St. Evroult, where they remained for a long time under the protection of the monks, but in the greatest alarm. The knight boldly denied the crime of which he was accused ; and no one was able to convict him of it by certain proof ; but while he asserted his innocence, no oppor tunity was allowed him of lawfully clearing himself ofthe charge, as he offered to do. At length, however, by the interference of many of the nobles, it was determined by the king's court that the accused should purge himself from the stain attached to him, by undergoing the ordeal of hot-iron at Rouen, in the presence of the clergy, which was done ; for having carried the flaming iron in his naked hand, by God's judgment, there was no appearance"], [496, "382 of its being bur ut, so that the clergy and all the people gave praise to God. His malicious enemies attended the trial in arms, intend ing, if he was declared guilty by the ordeal of fire, to have immediately beheaded him. During the troubles to which AVilliam Pantoul and his family were exposed, he was much comforted by abbot -Mainier and the monks of St. Evroult, who rendered him all the help they could both with God and man. This increased their mutual regard, and AVilliam offered to St. Evroult four of the richest palls he had brought from Apulia (the produce doubtless of the silk looms of Southern Italy), out of which were made four copes for the chanters in the church, which are preserved there to this day, and used in the solemn services of divine worship.\" ' To judge from the Domesday record of 1085-6, William Pan tulf, at -that date, had been reinstated by tthe Norman earl in all his possessions. \" William Pantoul betook himself [again] to Apulia, and having a great respect for St. Nicholas, made diligent enquiries after his relics. By God's blessing on his endeavour (continues the monk) he obtained from those who had translated the body, one tooth, and two fragments of the marble urn. William Pantoul was a gallant soldier, endowed with great talents, and well-known among the nobles of England and Italy, as one of the wisest and richest among his neighbours. Having obtained the tooth of so great a man, he returned to Normandy, and, on an appointed day, called together a number of persons at his own domain called Noron, to receive the relics in a worthy manner. Accordingly, in the year of our Lord 1092, the tooth of the blessed confessor Nicholas, with other relics of the saints brought by AVilliam Pantulf from Apulia, was deposited with great reverence in the church of Noron, erected in ancient times in honour of St. Peter. He in vited Roger, abbot of St. Evroult, and Ralph, who was at that time abbot of Seez, but who afterwards became Archbishop of Canterbury, to be present at the ceremony ; and, in the month of June, they received the holy relics amid great devotion of the monks and rejoicings of the laity, carefully placing them in a silver coffer, liberally provided by the before-mentioned knight. The deposit so often spoken of became in frequent request by persons suffering from fevers and other maladies, whose devout 1 Ordericus. B. V. ch. xvi."], [497, "383 prayers, aided by the merits of the good bishop Nicholas, obtained what they desired in the recovery of their health.\" ' There is no evidence to show how Pantulf was treated by Earl Hugh after the decease of Roger de Montgomery ; but Robert de Belesme, the third earl of Shrewsbury, and Pantulf, could not agree at all. \"He,\" (namely, Robert de Belesme), \" had disin herited AVilliam Pantoul, a brave and experienced knight,\" says Ordericus, 2 \" and had even given him a sharp repulse when he proffered his valuable services at the time they were urgently needed. Being thus rejected with disdain, AVilliam Pantulf went over to the king [Henry I., at that time engaged in the siege of the turbulent De Belesme's stronghold of Bridgnorth], who, having already proved his vigour of mind, received him graciously. He gave him [Pantulf] the command of two hundred men, and entrusted to him the custody of Stafford Castle, in the same neighbourhood. This knight proved Robert de Belesme's worst enemy, never ceasing from persecuting him both byr his counsels and his arms, till his ruin was completed.\" It was by Pantulf 's negotiation with his neighbours, the defenders of Bridgenorth, that that fortress was surrendered, and King Henry I. succeeded in crushing the terrible earl. On account of the important services he had rendered to his king, Henry I. restored Pantulf to his lost possessions, and further rewarded him. \" In the year of our Lord 1112, that is to say, the twelfth year of the reign of Henry, King of England, and the fourth of that of Lewes King of France, William Pantoul came to St. Evroult, it being the fortieth year after he founded the cell for monks at Noron,3 and mindful of his former friendship and the grants which, as we have already related, he before made, he recapitulated them, and, with his wife Lesceline, confirmed them all in a general chapter of the monks. At the same time, Philip, Ivo, and Arnulph, his sons, confirmed all the grants of their father to the monks of St. Evroult ; and they all, that is to say, AVilliam and Lesceline, and their three sons, Philip, Ivo, and Arnulph, laid the grant on the altar together.\" \" AVilliam Pantoul, so often mentioned, lived long, respecting Ham Pantulf enriched the monks of that place, he gave them the manor of Tradi ton (Market Drayton, in Shropshire) with the church and mill of that village. 1 Ordericus.

His sons succeeded to his estates \u2014 Philip in Normandy, Robert in England \u2014 but they have failed of prosecuting their father's enter prises with equal spirit.\" l So much for the account which Ordericus has given us of AVilliam Pantulf. AVe have preferred allowing the honest monk of St. Evroult to tell his own tale, for two reasons ; first, on account of the insight which the reader thereby gains into the history of that period in which the writer lived and moved ; secondly, because Ordericus Vitalis, born, as we have seen, in Shropshire, was personally acquainted both with the Norman earl and AVilliam Pantulf, one of the greatest of his feudatories. Such was William Pantulf, from whom the barons of AVem descended ; such the first Norman lord of the dispossessed Saxon's manor of Wem. It was this man's descendants who, in after times, acquired by charter of King Henry III. the right to have a market and fair at Wem. There also they held their free court twice in the yrear ; and had pleas of bloodshed, hue and cry, and the grim privilege of a gallows. AVem Castle was reported to be in a ruinous condition on April 7th, 1290. Wem Church. The manorial lords were probably the founders, as they con tinued the patrons, of Wem church.

The English interests of St. Evroult were attended to by the Prior of AVare, a cell of St. Evroult, in Hert fordshire. About 1133, however, the Abbey of Combermere was founded, when it having become the interest of the Combermere monks to have Drayton ; accordingly, the Prior of AVare, with Consent of his principal, the Abbot of St. Evroult, granted them a perpetual lease of the Manor. The monks of Combermere therefore became lords of Drayton ; who, obtaining from Henry III. the privilege of holding a weekly market here, hence the place acquired that distinctive title by which it is now known. The following are the authorities upon which the foregoing state ment is based : \u2014 \" On November 8, 1245, King Henry7 III., being at AVorcester, grants to Simon, Abbot of Combermere, the privilege of holding a weekly market, on Tuesdays, at his manor of Draiton; \u2014 also, of holding an annual fair on the eve, the day, and the morrow of the Nativity of the Virgin (Sept. 7, 8, 9); also Blodwite and Infangthef ; \u2014 also quittance of suits to county and hundred, of AVapentak, and of toll throughout the kingdom ; \u2014 and such other franchises as were usually sought for a projected borough.\" Henry and James AudleyT, successive lords of the neighbouring town of Newport, attested the foregoing charter.1 The Bradford Hundred Roll of 1255, says, that\u2014\" The Abbot of Cumbermere holds Draiton of the Prior of Ware, with the church of Draiton, of the fee of Hugh Pounton [Pantulf]. And the abbot renders 20 merks per annum to the Prior of Ware, and has here a market by Royal Charter.\" Again King Henry III., on April 4th, 1266, confirmed to the monks of Combermere the \" Manor of Magna Dray ton-in -Hales, by concession of the Abbot and Convent of St. Ebrulf, with all its franchises and appurtenances.\" Under the fostering care of the Abbot of Combermere, Drayton steadily increased in trading importance ; until the dissolution severed the connection between the abbot and the town of his creation.

Pope Nicholas' Taxation, in 1291, makes mention of an epis copal estate at Prees, and a prebend of Prees worth \u00a326 13s. 4d. per annum, but says nothing about a vicarage. In 1341, the parish was taxed 20 merks to the ninth of its wheat, wool and lamb.

This was an extraordinary work in the eyes of the natives, who, abandoning that old title of AVeston, by which the town had here tofore been known, henceforth distinguished it by the new name of Album Monastcriuni, Blancminster, or, in plain English, AA^hite church. As appears, then, from the above extract, AATiitchurcb, in Anglo- Saxon times, belonged to the great Earl Harold, second son of Godwin, earl of AVessex. After the sudden demise of his father, Harold became the right hand, as it were, of his indolent and superstitious brother-in-law, Edward the Confessor. He fought his battles, and drove back to Nature's niisty strongholds, Gruffith, dread chief of the Cymri : and hence, no doubt, it came to pass, that the reputed conqueror of AVales acquired Whitchurch. King Edward loved Harold very much. He was \" the king's darling,\" anddearest to him in all service. Not only to his infirm brother-in-law, the Confessor, was the name of Earl Harold dear ; it was dear to all, save to the out-land men, the Normans. Upon Edward the Confessor's decease, Harold was chosen by a majority of the Witan, or English national council, to mount the vacant throne. \" Harold, the earl, succeeded to the kingdom of England, even as the king had granted it to him, and men also had chosen him thereto,\" says the cotemporary writer in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. Crowned King of England, Harold II. 's brief reign of forty weeks and one day was characterised by vigor and a complete return to those old Saxon usages which had been despised by the late king and his Norman courtly favourites. Yet King Harold \" with little quiet abode therein, the while that he wielded the realm ;\" for the bastard count of the Normans, deeming that he had a better title to the throne of England than he who now sat upon it : hence the Norman invasion. The bold English king, after a forced march from York, whither he had gone to crush the hostile attempt of his unnatural brother Tosti, and his ally, the Norwegian giant, Hardraade ; after an exhausting march of 250 miles, King Harold confronted, with a very inadequate force, that incongruous but magnificent mail-clad host which Duke AArilliam had mustered upon the field of Hastings. A great battle ensued, in the midst of which, pierced with an arrow in the eye Domesday, so. 257, a 2"], [520, "404 the regal lord of AVhitchurch paid the penalty of his ambition with his life, and AVilliam the Conqueror extended his iron sway over our country. William de AVarren, who succeeded Harold in# this, his only Shropshire estate, was distantly related both to the Norman earl of Shrewsbury and to the Conqueror. By accepting an isolated feoffment in Shropshire, De Warren chivalrously entailed upon himself the warlike cares of a lord-marcher, and AVeston castle became one of a series of strongholds that guarded the marches. Under the earls, AVarren and Surrey, AVhitchurch was held by vassals, descending from William de AATarren, alias Fitz-Ranulf, who was related to the elder line. He was the earliest known lord of AVhitchurch, under the earls. His first appearance is on the Shropshire Pipe Roll of 1176, when he was security for his neighbour, the lord of Ightfield. The service by which the manor was formerly held, was this: the lord of AVhitchurch was to do duty as Earl AVarren's huntsman, at the will and at the charges of the said earl. The Church. AATilliam de AVarren, to whom the Conqueror assigned AVeston or AA'hitchurch, a lover of the church, having founded Lewes and Castle xlcre Priories, it is most likely also caused St.Alkmond's church to be built here. This church contains the monumental effigy of John Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury, who, surnamed the English Achilles, fell at the battle of Bordeaux in 1453. His bones were removed from France, and interred in the old church at AVhitchurch. AA7hen the present edifice was being erected, an urn was discovered in which the old warrior's heart was found, embalmed and covered up with a crimson velvet cloth. In 1291, the church of Album Monasterium, in the deanery and archdeaconry of Salop, was valued at \u00a313 6s. 8d. per annum. In 1341, the parish was taxed only \u00a312 to the ninth, because a third of it was in Cheshire and a part in Flintshire, counties not included in the current assessment.

The tenure in capite of Le Strange of Ness and Cheswardine was by service of H knight's fees, of which Cheswar dine constituted the half fee. The lord of the manor had his free court, in which he held pleas of bloodshed and hue and cry. He did suit to the county, but not to the hundred. He exercised free warren, and had a castle and park at Cheswardine.

This must have been founded before the year 1178, about which time John le Strange granted the advowson thereof to Haughmond Abbey. It is dedicated to St. Swithin. Fairs and wakes were usually sought to be held on the anniversary of the patron saint of the parish church; and accordingly, Roger le Strange, in 1304, obtained the king's charter for holding a yearly fair at Cheswar dine, of three days' duration, namely, the eve, the day, and the morrow of the translation of St. Swithin.

Although still mainly represented by Pimhill, yet 18 manors, which at Domesday were included in the Hundred of Bas cherch, are now involved in the Liberties of Shrewsbury. Other minor changes have taken place, as the reader can see by glancing at the annexed Table. Respecting its jurisdiction : \u2014 In Edward the Confessor's time, the Hundred Court was held at Baschurch, and two-thirds of its revenues went to the king ; the remaining third to the Earl of Mercia. After the conquest, the palatine Earls of Shrewsbury took the whole profits of the Hundred. When, however, upon the forfeiture of the third earl, Henry I. hecanie lord of the Hun dred, inasmuch as Shrewsbury Abbey had acquired the manor of Baschurch, the Hundred Court was henceforth held at Pimhill. The Hundred of Pemhull is entered as attending by its jury at the Shropshire assizes, held in the autumn of 1203, the earliest of which detailed records remain. The British poet Llywarc Hen, who lived in the 6th century, bore a distinguished part in defending his unfor tunate country against the Saxon invader, and consequently, was an eye-witness of the actions he records. After being driven from his principality of Cumbria, Llywarc sought shelter in the court of Cynddylan, the British Prince of Powis, at Pengwern (Shrews bury). But the fierce Saxons compelled the Britons to retire still further, before their superior force ; when it is supposed by some,' 1 Blakeway. Modem Name. Domesday Name. Saxon Ovmer or Owners, T. R. E.

The British term berth, signifies a violent thrust, which tallies with the event for which this spot is venerable. \" The works at the Berth,\" says Hartshorne, \" consist of two distinct fortresses, lying in a morass, but which are con nected with each other by an artificially-raised causeway, one hundred and fifty yards long and twelve feet wide, formed with vast labour, of small stones.\" Another causeway, the communica tion between the camps and the main land, takes a sinuous line across the bog towards the higher ground at Marton. Both these causeways are built of stones brought from a gravel-pit a quarter of a mile distant. \" The upper work occupies a circular eminence of three acres, and rises about forty-five feet above the level of the land at its base. It is strengthened on three sides by a morass ; upon the south, or fourth side, by a deep pool of water, covering eight acres. A concentric trench and vallum encircle the whole work ; in some parts this is still tolerably perfect, chiefly so on the north side, but having been formed of stones according to the British method of construction, the greater portion of it is destroyed, and what remains is dail}7 growing less conspicuous, in consequence of the materials being used for draining the surrounding wet land. The fosse was at first as much as ten feet wide. The crest of the vallum is at present about twenty feet above the level of the marsh. On the north-north-east side are remains of the original entrance. The gorge or gangway is seven feet wide. It had a tower on either side, or some erection which answered the same purpose, for there are two great heaps of stones still on the surface, notwith standing the thousands of loads that \" have been carried away. \"A stream runs round this side of the work, that cuts off the cause way from reaching to the very entrance. There is no doubt that this 1 Heroic Elegies of Llywarc Hen, translated by \\V. Owen.

The inferior fortress is of an elliptical form. It was defended by a morass on all sides, and even inter sected by a ditch that was supplied with wrater to render all access to it still more difficult. The works on the side next the superior fortress are 'considerably higher than those in the other quarters.\" \" In whatever way we look at these two fortifications,\" concludes the intelligent writer just quoted, \" they cannot fail to strike us as most remarkable examples of castrametation for the age when they were constructed. They evince a degree of military know ledge that is highly curious and surprising ; whilst they furnish us with a connecting link in the history of martial tactics, that is well deserving the attention of the antiquary and the soldier.\" ' The Domesday notice of Baschurch is as follows : \u2014 \" The Earl himself holds Bascberche. King Edward held it. Here are iii hides and a half. Of this one [hide] is in demesne, and there are iiii ox-teams, vi villains, and ii boors, with ii teams.

The [arable] land is capable of employing v ox-teams, and here are [v teams] with xiii boors.

From these two sources the king received \u00a37 per annum. In 1086, the hide, with the whole profits of the Hundred Court, yielded to the Norman Earl Roger \u00a36. The remaining 2| hides belonged to Shrewsbury Abbey ; and like good farmers, as they were, the monks it appears had taken care to keep their land well stocked with team-power.

A charter of December 28, 1339, informs us, that \u2014 \" With the unanimous consent of his convent, Adam, Abbot of Salop, gives and concedes to his tenants and burgesses of the New Vill1 of Baschirche (natives excepted) that they may hold their Burgages, recently built, or thereafter to be built, for 100 years, each such Burgage paying to the abbey an annual rent of 2s. in lieu of all services, except suit of the Manor-Court, and a heriot of 2s. at the decease of any burgess. The abbot further imparts to his burgesses his own franchise of selling free of toll throughout England. He gives them rights of common throughout the manor, and liberty to assize bread and beer, and to elect their own bailiff.\" So the Baschurch people acquired from the Abbot of Shrewsbury a corporate- government, and a position superior in some respects to the inhabitants of a royal borough. The Minis ter's Accounts of 1541-2 give a total of \u00a326 19s. as the Abbot's late income from Baschurch and its members, Newton, Prescott, Acton, (now Boreaton), Byrche, Nonyley, and Bageley. The Church. The Church of All Saints at Baschurch, originally a Saxon collegiate church, was given by Earl Roger de Montgomery to Shrewsbury Abbey. Bishop Novant, about 1190, allowed the monks to appropriate this Rectory. In 1291, the church of Bascherch, i.e. the rectory, was valued at \u00a316 per annum, and the vicarage at \u00a35. In 1341, the parish was assessed only \u00a312 to the ninth, \" because \"the usual stock of sheep was not kept up in the parish, and because all the lambs produced in the current year had been sold for two quarters of oats. Moreover,, the wheat crop had failed in a great measure, and the community were pauperised by different taxes of constant occurrence.\" In 1534, the abbot represented his tithes of Baschurch, includ ing Bagley and Noneley, to be \u00a316 15s. 4d., but the Minister's Accounts of 1541-2 give them as _\u00a339 4s. 4d.

After the forfeiture of Robert de Belesme, Ness came into the hands of Henry II., as a manor of royal demesne, when it acquired the title of King's Ness. King Henry made a tenqjorary grant of the manor to Cadwallader, one of those renegade Welsh princes, whom the English sovereigns used as tools to disintegrate the unity of North Wales ; but by 1157-8, as we learn from the Shrop shire Pipe Roll, the English king had taken Ness from the Welsh prince and given it to John le Strange. Henceforth, therefore, the baronial and powerful Le Stranges, distinguished as a race for their abilities in the field and at the council, and yet more so for their steady loyalty,, exercised the seigneury over Ness ; and from them it was that the manor acquired the distinctive appellation of Ness-Strange.

Of English origin, the town derives its name from the extensive mere or lake on its eastern side. This fine sheet of water covers some 116 acres, and is well stocked with fish. The meres, six in number, form a peculiar and attractive feature in the neighbourhood. They present, also a good field for the botanist, as fifteen or sixteen species of fern are to be found ; and, in one of the meres, namely, Colemere, moss-balls, conserves, are also found. Ellesmere is noticed in Domesday Book as follows : \u2014 \" The earl himself holds Ellesmeles. Earl Eduin held it [formerly]. Here iiii hides and a half. In demesne are v ox-teams, and x neat herds, xxxvi villains, and xiiii boors, with ii priests, have xiiii teams [among them]. Here a mill.

Upon the forfeiture of Robert de Belesme, third and last Norman earl of Shrewsbury, Ellesmere came into the hands of King Henry I., who granted it, along with several border manors of less importance, to William Peverel of Dover, one of that family concerning whose origin there is so much mystery. After the death of his royal benefactor, Peverel, in concert w=ith Fitz-Alan and other Shropshire adherents of the empress, in 1138, raised the standard of revolt against Stephen the usurper. \"The young William, surnamed Peverel,\" says Ordericus, \" had four castles, namely, Bryn, Ellesmere, Overton, and Geddington, and, elated at this, he augmented the force of the rebels.\" ' But Ste phen resisted the rebel lords, and, marching to Shrewsbury, stormed and took by assault its castle ; yet, whether or not Elles mere castle then jdelded to the usurper is a point upon which we have no information. Suffice it to observe, that, sickened with the internecine strife that caused his unhappy country to mourn, William Peverel dedicated himself to the service of the cross, and eventually found his grave in Palestine. Upon the restoration of Henry II. , the coheirs of Peverel were excluded from Ellesmere, which, as a manor of ancient demesne, came into the hands of that king. David-ap-Owen, prince of North Wales, married Emma, sister of Henry II. : accordingly, the English king, in 1177, conferred \"the land of Ellesmare on David Fitz-Owain, who had married his sister.\" 2 But David now suffered a lengthened imprisonment at the hands of his nephew, Lewellyn, of which King John, taking advantage, seized Ellesmere, and retained it. At Michaelmas, 1203, the sheriff of Shropshire charged that king 100s., which he had ex pended in repairs at Ellesmere castle ; again, the Michaelmas Pipe Roll of 1204 shows that Ellesmere castle had been repaired at the king's expense. The policy of the English monarch evidently was to conciliate the prince who wielded the sceptre of North Wales. John there fore gave in marriage to Lewellyn the Great, Joan, his natural daughter, and ordered the sheriff of Shropshire to assign 20 librates of lands as her marriage portion, which assignment took place 1 Ordericus Vitalis, B. XIII. ch xxxvii. 2 Hales was afterwards called Hales-Owen, from Owen, son of this princess."], [535, "415 partly in Ellesmere. A patent of March 23rd, 1205, also instructed Tliomas de Erdinton, then custos of Ellesmere castle, to give the same up to Lewellyn. Yet, notwithstanding that title of endear ment, \" our beloved son,\" by which the English king styled the Welsh prince, amity did not long endure between them, and Lewellyn, rebelling against his father-in-law, forfeited Elles mere. In 1212, the justices of the sorest amerced the town of Elles mere 20s. for some fault. Young Henry III. had not been long upon the throne, when, entering into negotiations with the Welsh prince, he restored Ellesmere to Lewellyn, who retained it until in 1231, hostilities having again broken out between the Welsh and English, Lewellyii for ever lost his grant. The castle and manor of Ellesmere now remained in the custody of successive sheriffs of Shropshire until 1253, when a patent of July 20th announced that the king had demised the manor and Hundred of Ellesmere to John de Grey, for a term of fifteen years, at an annual rent of \u00a320. Guilty of abridging the king's prerogatives at Ellesmere, however, long before his lease had expired, De Grey had forfeited Ellesmere by judg ment of the barons of exchequer, and, in 1256, Henry III. granted the manor to Prince Edward for a term of ten years, at a rent of \u00a330 per annum. Meanwhile, in anticipation of its becoming the residence of the king's son, and doubtless also in anticipation of the stormy period at hand, the sheriff had expended a large sum in the repair of Ellesmere castle, and the king's house in it. As difficulties, pro voked by his own weak misrule, multiplied around the throne of the third Henry, the barons grew bolder ; and it appears that the Parliament of Oxford, known as the mad Parliament, thrust upon the king Peter de Montfort as custos of the castle and manor of Ellesmere. Something of the sort certainly happened, and a patent of June 30th, 1258, empowers Peter de Montfort to levy customs for five years, to enable him to wall the town of Elles- mere. A patent of December 16th, 1263, gives Hamo le Strange, the royalist sheriff of Shropshire, seizin of the manor, castle, and Hundred of Ellesmere, with all appurtenances ; and these, it is probable Le Strange held for the king throughout the civil war which immediately succeeded. The barons, as is well known, de feated the king, and took him prisoner at Lewes, on the 14th of"], [536, "416 May, 1264, when, among other pseudo-patents which Simon Montfort issued, there is one of June 18th, 1265, which reveals the fact that Montfort offered to Lewellyn, for the sum of 30,000 merks, among other things, the Hundred of Ellesmere. Thus he who ranks as one of the great founders of the English consti tution, did not scruple at dismembering from England this im portant possession. The event of the battle of Evesham, however, liberated the king, when Henry III., in recognition of his loyal services, conceded the manor, castle, and Hundred of Ellesmere to Hamo le Strange, until he could be otherwise provided for. It is supposed that, soon afterwards, this great royalist accompanied Prince Edward to the Holy Land, and, like a previous lord of Ellesmere had done, perished fighting against the Mahommedans. In 1276, Ellesmere was settled by Edward I. on Hamo's brother, Sir Roger le Strange, for life, with remainder to the crown. Sir Roger died in 1311, when Ellesmere reverted to the crown. King Edward III., in 1330, gave the manor ancl castle of Ellesmere to his valued servant, Eubolo le Strange, and his wife Alice. In 1335, Eubolo died without issue, when Ellesmere went to his nephew, Roger le Strange, Baron of Knokin, who accord ingly became Baron Knokin and of Ellesmere. He held the fortalice and Hundred of Ellesmere in capite of the king, by service of one twentieth of a knight's fee, and, dying in 1349, was suc ceeded by Roger le Strange IL, his son. Ellesmere continued with the barons Strange of Knokyn until their heir general carried it to the Stanleys. \" Now, the baronies of Knokyn and of Elles mere, as well as that of Stanley,\" says Eyton, \" are in abeyance between the descendants and representatives of the three daughters and co-heirs of Ferdinando Stanley, fifth earl of Derby of his line.\" There is little of interest connected with the early history of the numerous members of Ellesmere. The Church That Ellesmere was originally a Saxon collegiate church is evident from the mention of two priests in the Domesday descrip tion of the manor. When Lewellyn was lord of Ellesmere, in the earlier half of the thirteenth century, he granted this advowson to the Knights Hospitallers located at Dongelwal, North Wales, who having, at some unknown period, obtained an appropriation of this rich benefice, the collegiate status of the church vanished.

The four hamlets alluded to, however, were taxed \u00a34 6s. 8d. to the current assessment, not more, as a general murrain had devastated the sheep-folds. In 1534-5, the vicar of Ellesmere's income was \u00a319, less 12s. for procurations, and 10s. for synodals.

Upon their forfeiture, Berwick came into the hands of Henry I., who, adopting a policy calculated to qualify the ascendancy of the Norman aristocracy, enfeoffed here William de Gorram, an emigrant from Maine. De Turnham and the Leybournes, descen- dants of this William, continued for 250 years afterwards to hold in capite of the Crown the manor of Berwick. They held it by the following curious service. In war-time, whenever the king passed into Wales, the lord of Berwick was to provide one horse- man, one man, and one greyhound, carrying with them one gammon of bacon ; these were to follow the king till the gammon of bacon was consumed, after which, if they remained, it was to be at the king's charges.

Although founded in Fitz Alan's fief, it would appear that Shrawardine was originally built and garri soned by the Crown.

Hence it happened that those lands, over which this magnate once had exercised the seigneury, afterwards were held under the successive lords of Montgomery. In 1240, Philip de Hugford was holding Walford under the lords of Montgomery; and he again had a tenant here who held a virgate of land under him upon these conditions : \u2014 He was, when ordered, to ride in the company of his suzerain at any time of the year, and to any part of Shropshire, at his own charges ; but if he went out of the county, his expenses were to be paid.

Aldiet held it. Here ii hides geldable. The land is for iiii ox-teams and a half. In demesne is one [such team] ; and ii villains and ii boors with half a team : and ii'ii strangers here pay [a rent of] xl pence. In King Ed ward's time it was worth 10s. : now 30s.

Domesday says : \u2014 \" Roger Venator holds of Earl Roger Slacheberie. Aluiet held it. Here i hide geldable. [The manor] was worth 5s. in the time of King Edward. Now it is waste.\" ' Slacheberie doubtless w=as absorbed into Ellesmere. gljOlllCf. By way of supplement to the notice of Slacheberie, Domesday has the following entry : \u2014 \" In this hundred lies Bruina of i hide, and it belongs to Hantone [Welch Hampton], Albert's manor. From thence a lawsuit is pending between the earl's vassals.\" 2 Bruma is now represented by Broom Farm, in the township of Tetchill, about two miles south-west of Ellesmere. IjOnlckll. \"Odo,\" says Domesday, \"holds of Earl Roger Hordelei. Algar and Dunniht held it [in Saxon times] for ii manors and were free. Here ii hides geldable. There is land for iii ox-teams. Here v villains and v boors with ii teams. The wood will fatten lx swine. In time of King Edward, [the manor] was waste. Now it yields 15s.

St. Mary's, Hordeley, was originally a dependency of Baschurch. In 1291, the church of Ordeleye, in Salop deanery and archdea conry, was valued at \u00a32 13s. 4d., besides a pension of 2s. therefrom to Shrewsbury Abbey. In 1341, the assessors to the ninth treated \" Hordel\" as a chapelry, and taxed the parish only 20s., because there were no sheep in it, etc. In 1535, the income of the rector of Hordeley was \u00a34 2s., less 2s. for procurations, and 11s. for synodals. Early Incumbent. \u2014 Richard de Derynton was rector of Hordyleg chapel in 1310. juxta Baschurch, or Ruyton-of-the-eleven-towns, a name acquired from the eleven towns which at some period, per haps, constituted the manor, is thus described in the Conqueror's record : \u2014 \" The same Odo holds Udeford and Ruitone. Leuenot held them for ii manors. There i hide and a half geldable. The land is for iiii ox-teams. Here iiii villains and ii boors have ii teams. In demesne is one team ancl ii neat-herds. There is a wood which will fatten xl swine, and v fisheries in the estate of [or underlet to] the villains.1 In the time of King Edward [the land] was waste, and afterwards it was worth 13s. ; now 20s.\" The Saxon Leuenot having been displaced, his manors were given by the Norman earl to his vassal, Odo. The fisheries spoken of as being here, were doubtless on the river Perry. Early annexed to Fitz Alan's barony, through the influence of this great chieftain doubtless it was, that Ruyton came to be annexed to the Hundred of Oswestry, over which Fitz Alan's interest was paramount. Appropriated thus to his exclusive jurisdiction in the marches ; a district where the baron suffered neither sheriff or king to interfere in matters appertaining to its civil jurisdiction : Ruyton became almost lost to English records. Ruyton was part of that fief which the le Stranges held under the Fitz Alans ; but about the year 1300, John Le Strange (V.) sold Ruyton, with all its homages and fees, to his suzerain, Edmund, Earl of Arundel. In ancient times, there were three mills connected with the manor of Ruyton. One of these was very early acquired by Haughmond Abbey ; \" the Pla.tt Mill \" was given to Shrewsbury \" Et v piscari\u00e6 in censu villanorum.\" Domesday, so. 257. b 2"], [550, "428 Abbey. Concerning the third mill, we read that Johannes exlraneus quartus [John le Strange IV.] gave and confirmed, for the souls of himself ancl his wife Johanna, his mill of Heath, with its fishery and appurtenances, and with timber to repair the same out of his wood of Rednall, and with a place near the mill convenient for winnowing. One nioiety of the profits of this mill was to go to the canons themselves ; with the other moiety, the monks were to provide two candles, to burn at the head and foot of the tomb of the aforesaid Johanna, the grantor's wife. ' Ruyton Church. Originally this was an affiliation of Baschurch, and as such was in the advowson of the abbot of Shrewsbury. In 1291, the church of Ruyton, in the archdeaconry and deanery of Salop, was valued at \u00a38 per annum. Under the fostering care of the lords of the fee, Ruyton had grown into an independent rectory, when, having been consigned to monastic patronage, the result as usual was, appropriation ; and the spoils of Ruyton rectory went to the kit nen of the convent. The Pope's Bull, giving his holiness' consent to the transaction, was recited by Roger Northburgh, Bishop of Lichfield, on February 27th, 1331, and on January 4th, 1332, William de Tykelwardyn was admitted the first vicar of Ruyton, at presentation of Haughmond Abbey. Ruyton was not assessed as a distinct parish to the ninth in 1341, it being in Oswestry Hundred. In 1535, the vicar of Ryton's income was \u00a36 per annum, less 2s. for synodals : the abbot's rectorial tithes were \u00a37 2s. Early Incumbent \u2014 Walter, parson of Ruton about 1235. C^tlOlltjOrd, pleasantly situated some five miles from Shrews bury, on the northern bank of the Severn, is thus noticed in Domesday Book : \u2014 \"Roger holds of the earl Maneford. Elmer held it [in Saxon times]. Here are iii hides. In demesne is one ox-team and a half, and xiii villains with vi teams ; and there might be iii teams and a half besides. Here is half a fishery, and a wood which will fatten xxiiii swine. In the time of King Edward [the manor] was worth \u00a34 [annually], and afterwards 20s. ; now it is worth \u00a34 10s.

From the circumstance, that two centuries afterwards, descendants of the latter are found holding the manor, we should infer it was Roger de Lacy's tenure. Montford bridge is famous in history as the scene of many a parley between the ambassadors of England and North Wales. The Church. The advowson of Montford was granted to the White Nuns of Brewood, in the 13th century. In 1291, the church of Moneford, in the deanery and archdeaconry of Salop, was valued at \u00a35 6s. 8d. per annum. In 1341, the parish was taxed only \u00a34 to the ninth, because 6 carucates of land in it lay waste, there had been a murrain among the sheep, and a Severn flood had destroyed most of the growing corn, etc. The Valor of 1535 represents the vicar of Monsforde's income as \u00a35 6s. 8d., less 6s. 8d. for procurations, and Is. 6d. for synodals. The rectory produced the White Nuns \u00a38, less a pension of 10s. to the prior of St. Guthlac, at Hereford.

Associated sometimes under the common name of Fitz, Fitz and Gulidone came, in due course, to Isabel de Say, baroness of Clun, and passed from her to her descendants by the first William Fitz Alan. Fitz Alan's feoffee here was Robert de Girros, who, partial to Haughmond, between the years 1239 \u2014 42, gave to that abbey his lands in Fittesho and Gulidon, including \"appurtenances, ease ments, natives [that is, men], and their chattels.\" The prayers and good offices of the abbey were the consideration. Fitz Chapel. Originally a dependence of St. Mary's, Shrewsbury, Fitz chapel was the subject of litigation between that church and Haughmond Abbey in the year 1200. Robert de Girros, claiming the advow son, had alienated it to Haughmond Abbey, hence the angry dispute. At length, the protracted suit between the abbot of Haughmond and the Dean and Chapter of \"St. Mary was actually settled by wager of battle, and the abbot's champion came off vic torious. A writ of King Henry III., dated at Westminster, October 18th, 1256, addressed to the Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, then informed that prelate of the recent suit, and how a duel had been armed and foughten between the parties ; since which the Dean and Chapter (the defendants) had come into court and renounced their right ; the bishop was, therefore, to admit the abbot's presentee to the said parsonage. In 1341, the parish of Fittos was taxed 20s. to the ninth.

The actual hoar stones that now exist are few. The lovely scenery amid which Oswestry stands, doubtless wit nessed in ancient times many a bloody conflict\u2014 dark episodes in border history ; yet there is no proof that the Romans ever occupied the distriot. Llanymynech hill, six miles to the south, appears to have been the nearest point to which the Latin invader carried his arms ; the unconquered Cymri, therefore, still defiantly manned the crest of their vast earthwork Hen Dinas. Fortifica tions of British origin generally have but a couple of ditches drawn round the quarter most liable to attack ; in the extraordin ary fortress of Hen Dinas, at Old Oswestry, however, there are four or five concentric ditches. Maes, Maesdir, signifies the open field or champaign ; the name probably by which the Cymrian occupants of Hen Dinas denomi nated the surrounding country. In the vicinity of Maesbury was fought the great battle in which King Oswald was killed. Oswald, the Christian king of the North-Humbrians \u2014 -Bretwalda, of Britain, who ruled supreme over all the kings of the Angles, the Picts, the Cymri, and the Scots \u2014 that powerful yet lowly-minded Saxon, upon whom even the jealous Britons bestowed the epithet of \"Bounteous-hand\" \u2014 Oswald was slain in battle at \" Maserfeld,\" iu the year 642, by Penda \" the Strong.\" A terrible -fellow was this restless pagan head of the South-Humbrians. He savagely caused his fallen Christian opponent's body to be cut into pieces, and the spot where Oswald's mangled remains had been suspended, the Saxons called Oswald's treoiv, Oswald's tree, afterwards Oswestry. The Welsh named it Croes Oswalt, Oswald's Cross. The place where the pious Christian king parted with life, continued for many years to receive an extraordinary amount of superstitious reverence at the hands of his Saxon countrymen. Venerable Bede, speaking of Oswald and Maserfeld, observes :\u2014 \" How great his faith was towards God, and how remarkable his devotion, has been made evident by miracles since his death ; for, in the place where he was killed by the pagans, fighting for his country, infirm men and cattle are healed to this day. Whereupon many took up the very dust of the place where his body fell, and, putting it into water, did much good with it to their friends who were sick. This cus tom came so much into use, that the earth being carried away by"], [570, "440 degrees, there remained a hole as deep as the height of a man.\" ' The writer of the foregoing died in 735, nearly a hundred years after Oswald had been slain. To restrain the incessant inroads of his Welsh neighbours, apparently about the year 765, Offa, King of Mercia, caused Watts dyke to be erected. It runs hard by to the east of Maesbury. But when, after twenty years' fighting, the \" Terrible \" Mercian had succeeded in driving his Cymrian foes further back towards their mountain fastnesses, he cast up in a parallel line some two miles westward of Watts dyke, that vast entrenchment which still bears his name. Maesbury lay between those two remarkable earthwork barriers, Offa's dyke and Watts dyke, and thus, essen tially a border settlement, its position must have entailed on its ancient inhabitants all the stirring vicissitudes of border life. Unfortunately, however, we are in possession of but few of the facts relating to its early history. Domesday says that : \u2014 \" The earl himself holds Meresberie with v berewicks, and Rainald [holds the manor] of him. King Edward held it [formerly] . Here vii hides geldable ; and here Rainald has built Luure castle. In demesne [Rainald] has ii ox-teams, and x Welsh with a priest have viii teams ; and there might be vi more teams [employed]. Here a church. Here iiii neat-herds. There is a wood worth little or nothing. Of the same land Robert holds half a hide, and Hengebaldus ii hides ; and they have ii teams. To this manor belongs Mersste Hundred. In the time of King Edward it was waste. Now it is worth 40s. [annually].\" 2 From the Conqueror's record, then, we learn that iu King Edward's time the important manor of Maesbury was waste ; in other words, it yielded no revenue to its royal owner : a condition doubtless to be attributed to that alliance between Algar, the rebel Earl of Mercia, and Gryffyth ap Llewellyn, Prince of North Wales, which caused his enemies to harry the Confessor's manor. But the Saxon king's vicegerent, Harold, marched against the Welsh and subdued them. Upon the forfeiture of the earls Edwin and Morcar in 1071, William the Conqueror conferred the palatinate of Shropshire on his kinsman, Roger de Montgomery. The Norman Earl of Shrews bury, politic as strong, with the assistance of Warin his sheriff and other wise warriors, succeeded in gaining the ascendancy over 1 Bede, Eccles. Hist. MB. III., ch. 9. 2 Domesday, so. 253, b 1."], [571, "441 the Welsh border, when, giving Maesbury to Warin, it descended to his successor Rainald, who held the manor when the Domesday Commissioners made their report. Instead, however, of its beinc* good for nothing as it had been in King Edward's time, the manor, with the jurisdiction of the hundred attached, yielded 40s. annually to its Norman lord ; moreover, it was peacefully occupied in part by the Welsh. The church spoken of in Domesday as connected with this manor, doubtless had been erected over that sacred spot where stood Oswald's tree. As we learn from Earl Roger's charter to Shrewsbury Abbey, this church was called \" ecclesiam Sancti Os waldi,\" the church of St. Oswald : around the sacred edifice a vill gradually sprang up. To it Rainald the sheriff, for strategic reasons, added a castle, that great military work emphatically styled Luure or L'\u0152uvre in Domesday ; ancl the town which thus arose under Norman influences in the manor of Maesbury, named Oswestry, soon became caput of the manor. Oswestry was either recovered by, or ceded to, the Welsh in the reign of Stephen, as we learn from good authority ' that \" at the close of the year 1148, Madoc, the son of Meredith ap Blethyn, did build the castle of Oswestrie, and gave his nephewes, Owen and Meyric, the sonnes of Gruffyth ap Meredyth, his part of Cyvelioc.\" Amid the hostilities of Stephen's reign, it is not unlikely that the Welsh, having succeeded in gaining a temporary ascendancy over the border, may have rebuilt the castle of Oswes- try, which had been destroyed. It is certain, however, that the Anglo-Norman William Fitz-Alan died in 1160, lord of Oswestry. Called Blancminster, the sheriff, Guy le Strange, had custody of the castle here from 1161 till 1175. It was an unsettled period, and from his accounts we glean that one knight, two watchmen, two porters, and twenty men-at-arms \u2014 the ordinary garrison of Oswestry castle \u2014 cost \u00a348 13s. 4d., or something like \u00a32,000 per annum modern currency. This was independent of the outlay caused by sinking a new well, war stores, castle-palisades, and in frequently providing a large body of Servientes, as a temporary addition to the garrison ; all of which expenses the sheriff, by direction of the Crown, had incurred in order that he might hand over Oswestry castle in a state of efficiency to its young lord. Upon the death of William Fitz-Alan II. in 1210, Oswestry, by reason of the minority of his heir, again was placed at the disposal 1 Powel, p. 147. (Ed. 1811)."], [572, "442 of the Crown, and King John made it a rendezvous for his invasion of Wales. John Fitz Alan sided with the barons in rebellion against his liege lord, when the king, concentrating his fury against the west, appeared before Oswestry on the 6th of August, 1216, and by the 10th the town was reduced to ashes. It does not appear, however, that the infuriated John succeeded in capturing Fitz Alan's stronghold. Oswestry, in 1226, was appointed by King Henry III. and Prince Lewellyn as the place of conference between the latter and certain lords-marchers to whom he owed restitution. A writ-close of September 19th, 1233, enjoins the bailiffs of Shrewsbury to allow merchants to carry their merchandize as far as Album Monasterium (Oswestry). John Fitz-Alan III. died in 1272, when an Extent, or general valuation, of his Shropshire estates being made, it was found that the net annual income which the deceased baron had received from Arundel, Clun, Shrawardine, Blancminster, and the Walcheria of Blancminster, amounted to \u00a3506 8s. Id., a sum equal to \u00a325,000 of our modern money. Out of this total, Oswestry, with its demesnes, manor-court, mills, tolls, rents of burgages and other tenements, yielded \u00a388 17s. 3d., whilst the tenants of the Wal cheria of Oswestry, paid further rents or services amounting to \u00a342 2s. 9|d., and were subject besides to an assessment, the object of which was to supply the drink (poturam) of certain serjeants of the peace appointed for the district. The burgages within and without the bailey of the castle are distinguished. One of the obligations of the lord of Oswestry 's tenants related to the keep and conveyance of his hounds. We may be sure that the Welsh border was subject to disturb ances of no ordinary character during the reign of Edward I. Accordingly, we find that on December 6th, 1283, the king being then at Acton Burnell, expedited a patent whereby the bailiffs and burgesses of Oswaldestre were permitted to take a Id. for every measure of corn exposed for sale, and to levy, for a period of twenty years, similar duties in aid of the repair and completion of their town wall. King Edward I. was in person at Oswestry on the 16th of January, 1284. That warlike and ambitious monarch again visited Oswestry on June 24th, 1295 : within two months after \"Madoc, son of Llewellyn\" was captured on the long mountain near Caus, when the Welsh, despairing of attaining their aim, abandoned war and quietly settled down to more"], [573, "443 profitable speculations. We need scarcely add, that the pacifica tion of Wales and the border was fraught with prosperity to Oswestry. Church of St. Mary, Oswestry. This, a Saxon foundation, first of all dedicated to St. Oswald, before 1085 had been given by Warin, the sheriff, to Shrewsbury Abbey. It is alluded to in the Domesday notice relating to the manor of Maesbury. Originally of a collegiate character, it was the mother church of an extensive district. The abbot and con vent of Salop obtained the appropriation of Oswestry church about the year 1222, when it became a vicarage. In 1291, the rectory of the church of Oswalstra, in the deanery of Marchia, aad diocese of St. Asaph, was valued at \u00a326 13s. 4d., and its vicarage at \u00a38 13s. 4d. The Valor of 1534 represents the vicarage of Oswestre, in the deanery of Marchia, as worth \u00a326 13s. 4d., less 40s. for lactualia,1 15s. for procurations, and 2s. lOd. for the annual average payable at a bishop's visitation. The abbot of Shrewsbury's rectorial tithes, at the same time, amounted to \u00a366 13s. 4d. per annum. Nothing is known respecting the early incumbents of Oswestry, or any other church in the diocese of St. Asaph. In former times an hospital existed at Oswestry, which, founded about the yTear 1205, was endowed with great liberality. Largely populated by the Welsh, it is difficult to define the extent of, or to say what were the various members of that vast jurisdiction that owned Fitz-Alan's sway in the Marches. The baron rendered no acknowledgment, except homage and fealty for the exercise of his prerogative, which was of a most exclusive character. Hence the materials for the history of this district are but scant}'. Yet, if the greatest of the lords-marchers of Shrop shire enjoyed unbounded privileges, his feudal obligation also was great \u2014 he had to maintain Oswestry castle in efficiency, and to guard the Welsh border. is thus noticed in Domesday :\u2014 \" The earl himself holds Wititone, with viii berewicks and a half. __ King Edward held it.

What a corrective to loose historical assertion such an invaluable record as Domesday Book is. We have seen it gravely stated, that in the year 843, Whittington castle was built by a British chieftain, whose descendants possessed it till the Conquest, when it was given to Peverel, the founder ofthe family of Peverels of the Peak. From Domesday, however, we learn that Wititone belonged to the Anglo-Saxon kings before the Conquest, and that when the Conqueror's commissioners made their report, the Norman earl himself was holding the manor. The real history of Whittington has indeed been surrounded with so much that is romantic, yet utterly false, that to present the sober truth to the reader may, perchance, turn out rather an unthankful office. The matter may be summed up in a few lines. From Roger, the first Norman Earl of Shrewsbury, Whitting ton descended to his son, Robert de Belesme, upon whose forfeiture it probably came into the hands of Henry I. It is certain that William Peverel was lord of Whittington in Henry the First's time, and it is most likely that he received it from that king. Nobody has ever yet found out who was father of the brothers, William, Hamo, and Pagan Peverel ; but William Peverel of Dover, to whom Henry I. gave Whittington, being childless, his nephew, William Peverel, succeeded to Whittington, and fortified it against the usurper Stephen, in 1138. Upon the decease of the younger William Peverel, it does not appear that his sisters and co-heirs were permitted by Henry II. to establish their claim upon Whittington, but as is proved by a series of payments made by the sheriffs of Shropshire, in the 1 \" Dimidium firman, noctis.\" Domesday, so. 253, b 1."], [575, "p. 414. WHITTINGTON CASTLE."], [576, ""], [577, "445 years 1160-1-2-3-4, resuming it in demesne, that king in 1165 gave Whittington to the Welshman, Roger de Powis. From various entries on the Pipe Rolls, it is certain that Roger continued to hold Whittington, and to remain in the pay of the English king, until his death, when Mereduch, his son, and after wards Mereduch Fitz Roger's brother, Meurich, successively became lords of Whittington. The following from the Shropshire Pipe Roll, shows that the lord. of Whittington, with a contingent, accompanied Richard the Lion-hearted, into Normandy in 1194 : \u2014 \" Et Meurich, filio Rogeri et vi servientibus, cum duobus equis et lx servientibus peditibus, 108 solidos, pro liberacionibus suis de octo diebus ad eundum in servitio Regis in Normanniam, per breve Regis.\" Again, we have it from the most unquestionable authority, that towards April, of the year 1200, \" Meuricde Powis, of AVittinton, fined 50 merks with King John, to have the king's confirmation of Wittinton and Overton, which Henry II. did confirm to Roger, his father\"; and that the king accepted the fine. ' Succeeding his father, in the following May, Wrennoc, son of Meuric de Powis, \" proffered a fine of 80 merks and two coursers to King John, for possession of the vills and castles of Hilinton [Whittingtcn]- and Overton,\" which John, accepting, confirmed him in the possession of; but, in 1204, Fulk Fitz-Warin III. established his right to the manor and castle of Whittington. It is uncertain what con stituted Fitz-Warin's right to Whittington, whether relationship to the Pevercls, the old lords of Whittington, or from one of Fitz Warin's ancestors having been enfeoffed by one of the Peverels in the greater part of the manor. There is, and probably ever will be, obscurity surrounding the question. The first Fulk Fitz Warin is known to have been connected by ties of vas salage to the second William Peverel in Cambridgeshire. There is no reason why he might not have been his vassal also at Whittington. Be it as it may, Fulk Fitz Warin III. got a judicial decision in his favour, and on October 17th, 1204, obtained from King John Whittington castle and estate, as his right and inheritance. The lordship of Whittington continued with the baronial Fitz-Warins until the extinction of the elder male line in 1420. 1 -Rot.Chartarum, I John, p. 2, n..i6."], [578, "446 Whittington Church.

This archi tectural feature agrees with the circumstance that, about 1190-95, Ralph le Strange gave the chapel of Knokyn to Haughmond Abbey. Formerly included in Kinnerley, after the erection of this chapel, Knokyn became an independent parish.

Probably it was upon the forfeiture of the earls of Shrewsbury, that Chirbury reverted to the king ; at any rate, when Henry I. re-arranged the hundreds of Shropshire, the seigneury of Chirbury Hundred, and every manor in it that was at the king's disposal, went to form the honour of Montgomery, which honour the king bestowed upon Baldwin de Boilers, when he married Sibil de Faleise, the king's niece.

The claimants were Vitalis Engaine, Thomas de Erdinton, Stephen de Stanton, Giles de Erdinton, Robert Wafre, and lastly, AVilliam de Cantilupe, who ultimately obtained everything belong ing to the honour in Shropshire or the Marches. Meanwhile, King John, and afterwards Henry III., affecting to treat the castle and honour of Montgomery as an escheat since the death of AVilliam de Courtenay, had retained the castle of Mont gomery in their own hands.

About two miles to the west of Clun the celebrated Saxon earthwork, Ossa's Dyke, is to be seen, in an excellent state of preservation. Clun is the subject of the following entry in Domesday Book: \u2014 \" The same Picot holds Clune. Edric held it [in Saxon times] and was ' a free man. Here xv hides geldable.

The vill of Saium or Sai, from whence he derived his distinctive appellation of De Say was situated about nine miles west of Exmes the caput of Roger de Montgomery's Norman Viscomte. With his wife, Adeloya, and his two sons, Robert and Henry, Picot occurs in 1060 as a benefactor to the house of St. Martin, at Seez. Six years later and he fought under the banner of the Duke of Normandy at Hastings, for his name figures on the Battle Abbey Roll.5 The historian Ordericus mentions, that besides entrusting the command of Shrewsbury to Warin the Bald (the sheriff), \" Roger de Mont gomery also gave commands in his earldom to William, surnamed Pantoul, Picot de Say, and Corbet, with his sons, Roger and Robert, as well as other brave and faithful knights, supported by whose 1 A scribal error in Domesday has sub stituted the word tenuit fox suit, which is evidently meant. 2 itReddunt ii auimalia de censuX 4 Domesday, so 258, a 2. 5 The name Pigot appears in the list published by Duchesne; Pygot in that published by Leland. 3 An enormous depreciation."], [597, "L'LL'N CHURCH FONT, CLUN. p. 464"], [598, ""], [599, "465 wisdom and courage, he ranked high among the greatest nobles.\" ' Thus figuring as one of Earl Roger's chief vassals, Clun was the largest of the twenty-nine manors which the Norman Picot de Say held under the Earl of Shrewsburv. After Picot, Henry his son, became lord of Clun, to whom suc ceeded Helias de Sa)', whose era was nearly co-equal with Stephen's usurpation. It was probably during this period of civil convulsion, that the baron of Clun converted Clun into an independent juris diction. Isabel de Say, daughter and sole heir of Helias, married William Fitz-Alan I. ; and thus the two privileged franchises of Oswestry and Clun became united in the house of Fitz-Alan. Clun castle, after a long siege and many a fierce assault, was stormed by the Welsh Prince, Rees, about 1196 and committed to the flames. Upon the decease of John Fitz-Alan III. in 1272, an extent of his barony was taken, when the jurors found that \u2014 \" Clun castle was small but pretty well built. The roof of the tower wanted covering with lead, and the bridge wanted repairing. Outside the castle was a bailey, enclosed with a foss, and a certain gate in the castle-wall thereabouts, had been begun [but not finished]. The buildings in the said bailey, viz., a grange, a stable, and a bake house, were in a weak state. In the town of Clun there were 183 burgages, and 22 burgages had tenements in the assarts of the manor. Clun market, held on Saturdays, produced \u00a310- per annum. Two fairs of three days each were held at Martinmas (November 11th), and at the feast of Pancrace, Nereus, and Achilles (May 12th). They realized \u00a36 per annum.

Among others who imagined that they had been cured of their maladies by a visit to the shrine of St. Ethelbert, was Egwin Shakehead, the wealthy but paralytic owner of Lydbury, who, in return, offered to the Saxon saint his vast manor. Offa hearing of the cure, repented, it is said, of his evil deeds, and largely increasing the endowment of St. Ethelbert, over the spot where a thousand vears ago the murdered Saxon King of East Anglia's bones reposed in the little vill of Fernley, now stands the stately cathedral of Hereford. The reader will, therefore, understand how it came to pass that in 1086, William the Conqueror's com missioners reported that Lydbury belonged to the bishop of Hero ford. \" The bishop of Hereford,\" says Domesday, \"holds of the king Lideberie, and he held it in the time of King Edward.

The land is for two ox teams. It pays 5s.\" Leintwardine Church. This was originally the Saxon mother-church of a parish of very great extent. Approaching his end, Hugh de Mortimer, about 1184, gave the church of Lyntwardyn to Wigmore Abbey. In 1291, the church of Leynthwardyn, in the deanery of Clun, with the chapels of Boriton and Dunton, was worth \u00a320 per annum ; this was the rectory : the vicar of Leynthwardyn's portion was =\u00a34 13s. 4d. \" In the 14th century, nine chaplains chanted daily mass at the altars of Leintwardine church for the souls of Edward III., of Isabella his mother, and Philippa his queen, of Henry, Bishop of Lincoln, the Earl of Lincoln, his Countess Joan, and others, with all the faithful departed. The lands assigned for these comprehensive services were granted by Roger, Earl of Mor timer, and were exempted by royal favour from the Statute of Mortmain.

A few yards to the north-east of Clungunford church, is a large circular mound, which, 15 feet high, measures 103 feet across its base, and 49 across its summit. This tumulus was carefully opened some years ago,1 and, from discoveries then made, it is clear that this mound furnishes us with an instance of interment by cremation. There can be no doubt that, when this barrow was constructed, the ancient custom of burning the dead prevailed in this country. An interesting account of the opening of this tumulus is given in Hartshorne's Salopia Antiqua.2 The following notices in Domesday Book relate to Clungunford : \u2014 \" The same Picot [de Say] holds Clone.
